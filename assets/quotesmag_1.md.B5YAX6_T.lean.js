Located adjacent to a bridge over the River Brett on the B1115 between Hadleigh and Stowmarket, it is part of Babergh district. The parish also contains the hamlets of Ash Street and Drakestone Green. The parish was recorded in the 2011 census as having a population of 130, down from 158 in the previous census. History Semer is recorded in the Domesday Book as belonging to Bury St Edmunds Abbey in both 1066 and 1086. The abbey acted as both Lord of the Manor and Tenant-In-Chief. The village is recorded as home to 20 households: six villagers, 13 small holders and one slave. It is recorded as having enough ploughland for 3 lord's plough teams and 3 men's plough teems; and the village also had 12 acres of meadow, a mill, a church, 0.25 acres of church land, 16 cattle, 2 cobs, 24 pigs and 97 sheep. In 1086 the village is valued as worth £6 a year to its lord, Bury St Edmunds Abbey, a £1 increase on its value in 1066. Its taxable value is recorded as 3.8 geld units and 2.5 villtax.  All Saints Church  The small church is set a few hundred yards off of a minor road across a meadow beside the River Brett, It is almost entirely Victorianised with a chancel that was rebuilt in 1870. One notable feature of the graveyard, to the east of the church, is a marble Edwardian angel scattering roses. The church has a plain square-cut font which is thought to be 14th-century, as is the nave. There is also a Royal Arms of King George III, painted before the union with Ireland. The church has three bells. The bell nearest to Church Lane is dated 1621 but is unused; the other two working bells, nearest to the East end, are used weekly; the middle one dated 1618 and cast at Bury. The bells seem to originally have swung, but the clappers are now tied to the rope and swing against the interior of the bell. The inscriptions on the bells are: * 1st Bell Johannes me fecit, T.G. 1618 (\\"John made me\\") * 2nd Bell Meritis Edmundi scimus a crimine mundi (\\"Through the merits of Edmund may we be clean from guilt\\") * 3rd Bell Thomas Cheese me fecit, 1621 (\\"Thomas Cheese made me\\") Hamlets =Ash Street= The small hamlet of Ash Street is centred approximately east of Semer church; it is located to the north of a bridge over the River Brett. Ash Street is recorded in the Domesday Book as a very small settlement of just five smallholders, with of meadow and a mill; the hamlet had a taxable value of 1.5 geld units. Prior to the Norman Conquest of 1066, the hamlet was owned by an unnamed \\"Free Woman\\". After the Conquest it is recorded as under the Lordship of William the Conqueror's half-brother: Robert, Count of Mortain. =Drakestone Green= The small hamlet of Drakestone Green is centred approximately south of Semer church.

Based on the 1946 play L'Aigle à deux têtes by Jean Cocteau, the film is about a man who breaks into the castle at Oberwald to kill the queen but faints before doing so. The man's physical resemblance to the murdered king leads to a strange turn of events. The Mystery of Oberwald received the Italian National Syndicate of Film Journalists Silver Ribbon in 1982. Plot During the nineteenth century, a young radical poet named Sebastian (Franco Branciaroli) breaks into an old dilapidated castle in Oberwald on a dark stormy night intending to kill the queen and free his country. The queen (Monica Vitti) has been in mourning for ten years for her husband the king who was assassinated on their wedding day. Sebastian, who faints before he can kill the queen, is the spitting image of the assassinated king. Sebastian and the queen talk, and the queen discovers that Sebastian once wrote a subversive poem that she liked, even though it was attacking her. The queen dares Sebastian to kill her, otherwise she vows to kill him. Cast * Monica Vitti as The Queen * Paolo Bonacelli as Count of Foehn * Franco Branciaroli as Sebastian * Elisabetta Pozzi as Edith de Berg * Luigi Diberti as Willenstein * Amad Saha Alan as Tony, the manservant Music In the soundtrack are included some famous classical music pieces: * An Alpine Symphony. * Death and Transfiguration. * Don Quixote (Strauss). * Symphony No. 1 (Brahms). * Verklärte Nacht. Reception Upon its theatrical release, The Mystery of Oberwald received generally negative reviews. In his review in The New York Times, Vincent Canby called it \\"a movie that probably wouldn't last five minutes in front of an audience in control of its wits and with no more than a passing interest in Art for its own sake.\\" Canby concluded, \\"The only thing that makes The Mystery of Oberwald bearable is watching the Italian director's attempts to use video color techniques that are supposed to make more dramatic a fairly conventional narrative.\\" On the review aggregator web site Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 57% positive rating from critics based on 7 reviews.

He was for some time a pupil of the Jesuit Fathers seminary at Rouen, which he left at the end of two years to enter the Capuchin Order. His health was greatly impaired by his austerities there, and his family, alarmed, obtained permission for him to join the Premonstratensian Canons. Afterwards he was appointed pastor to several small parishes in Normandy. In 1690, at the suggestion of Fontenelle and the Abbé de Saint-Pierre, he wrote his Histoire de la conjuration de Portugal. The book was received with favour, and in 1695 appeared the Histoire des révolutions de Suède (History of the Swedish revolutions). In 1703 Vertot was made a member of the Académie des inscriptions. Besides contributions to the Mémoires of the Académie and other minor works, he wrote the Révolutions romains (1719) and Histoire des chevaliers hospitaliers de Saint-Jean de Jérusalem (History of the Knights Hospitallers), also known as Histoire de Malte (History of Malta). It is related, in connection with the latter, that in answer to an offer of additional data about the great siege by the Ottomans in 1565, he said, \\"Mon siège est fait\\" (\\"My siege is finished\\"), a phrase construed by some of his critics as an expression of his disregard for historical accuracy. Another interpretation of the comment is that he simply wished to get rid of an intruder who was trying to force upon him documents whose authenticity was very doubtful.

This resolution differed from the earlier Resolution 282, which was only voluntary. The embargo was subsequently tightened and extended by Resolution 591. The embargo was lifted by Resolution 919 following democratic elections in South Africa in 1994.  Impact  The embargo had a direct impact on South Africa in a number of ways: * Last-minute cancellation of the sale of D'Estienne d'Orves-class avisos and Agosta-class submarines by France. * The cancelation of the purchase of Saar 4 class missile boat from Israel, some of which had to be built covertly in South Africa instead. * South Africa's inability to purchase modern fighter aircraft to counter Cuban MiG-23s over the SAAF in the South African Border War. * The growth of the modern day multibillion-dollar South African arms industry. * The end of shipments by the United States of enriched uranium fuel for South Africa's SAFARI-1 research nuclear reactor.  Circumvention of the embargo  The South African government devised a number of strategies to bypass the embargo to obtain military technology and components that it was unable to procure openly. United Nations Security Council Resolution 591 was passed in 1986 to extend the embargo and to tightened some of the loopholes. = Local production = Many armaments were wholly designed and manufactured in South Africa, as reflected by the growth and export business of Armscor. = Smuggling = Notable operations that came to light were: * The 1984 case of the Coventry Four. Four South African businessmen in the UK were found to be operating a front company on the behalf of Kentron that was sourcing materiel in defiance of the ban. * The arrest and imprisonment of Gerald Bull for developing the G5 howitzer for Armscor. * The nuclear weapons program reached its peak during the embargo. According to David Albright, components for the program were imported without the knowledge of the international community, or put to ingenious uses that had not been envisaged by the enforcers of the embargo. = Dual purpose equipment = Computer and air traffic control radar systems ostensibly destined for civilian use were diverted to the military. = Use of foreign specialists = The South African government was able to hire the services of foreign technicians, for example Israeli specialists who had worked on the Lavi fighter aircraft were recruited by Atlas Aircraft Corporation to work on the Atlas Cheetah and Atlas CAVA. = Licensed production = In somes cases, foreign armaments were simply produced under license in South Africa, as in the case of the Warrior class strike craft, the R4 assault rifle and Atlantis Diesel Engines. = Co-operation with other states = South Africa exchanged military technology with other states in a similar position to itself, notably through the Israel–South Africa Agreement, as well as with Taiwan, Morocco, Indonesia, Argentina, and Iran. Between 1977 and 1991, Morocco was involved in transfer of French technology, French armaments and designs to South Africa, and in return South African Forces and specialists went to train the Moroccan Armed Forces and Police  See also  * Armscor (South Africa) * Denel * History of South Africa in the Apartheid era * List of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 401 to 500 (1976–1982) * United Nations Security Council Resolution 181  References  External links * *Text of the Resolution at undocs.org 0418 United Nations Security Council Resolution 418 Category:United Nations Security Council sanctions regimes 0418 Category:Boycotts of apartheid South Africa Category:Embargoes Category:November 1977 events mzn:قطعنومه ۴۱۷ امنیت شورا ckb:بڕیارنامەی ٤١٧ی ئەنجومەنی ئاسایش ","title":"United Nations Security Council Resolution 418"},{"id":"14969566","text":"Casino Theatre, 1900 The Casino Theatre was a Broadway theatre located at 1404 Broadway and West 39th Street in New York City.

The redesigned Casino seated 1,300. The theatre opened with productions by the McCaull Comic Opera Company. It was first managed by producer and composer Rudolph Aronson, and later by Canary & Lederer from 1894 to 1903, and from 1903 by the Shuberts. As the center of the Broadway theatre district moved uptown, north of 42nd Street, the Casino closed in 1930. It was demolished the same year, along with the nearby Knickerbocker Theatre, to make way for the expanding Garment District. The Casino hosted a series of successful operettas and other musical theatre pieces in the 1880s and 1890s, including the extraordinarily successful Erminie.IBDB entry for the original New York run, accessed October 21, 2014.

In 1898, it was host to the premiere of Clorindy, or The Origin of the Cake Walk, the first African-American musical to be presented before a white audience. The theatre is perhaps best remembered, however, as having been the home of the 1900 production of the Edwardian musical comedy, Florodora. In that show, it became the first theatre in New York to feature a chorus line, the \\"Florodora Sextet\\". The sextet's original lineup included a number of ladies who would later achieve fame and fortune. The production \\"elevated the chorus girl into ... an attraction in its own right.\\" Evelyn Nesbit was a chorus girl in the show in 1901. Over the decades, the theatre also became known for its free Christmas presentations for New York children. Over the next decade, the theatre continued to present musicals and operettas, some of the most successful being A Chinese Honeymoon (1902), The Earl and the Girl (1905) and The Chocolate Soldier (1909). During World War I, it hosted transfers of several of the Princess Theatre musicals, among other musicals, such as The Blue Paradise (1915) and Sometime (1918). In the 1920s, the theatre was the home of several hit operettas, particularly The Vagabond King and The Desert Song. Although the Casino had led the move uptown by the Broadway theatre district, by 1930, most of the theatres had moved even further north, to the West 40s.

It is based on the novel of the same name by Elizabeth Taylor, about the life of a fiery and passionate young writer. The protagonist was portrayed by Romola Garai; other characters were played by Sam Neill, Michael Fassbender and Charlotte Rampling. Plot Angel Deverell (Romola Garai) is considered an outsider in the town of Norley. She has a fanciful imagination and prefers to be alone, writing. Her mother, a shopkeeper, and her aunt, who works for the family that lives in the grand house called Paradise, don't understand her. She finishes writing her novel, Lady Irania, and sends it off. Theo Gilbright (Sam Neill) offers to publish her novel, but he requires that she make some changes. Angel refuses and leaves in tears. Theo comes after her and offers to publish the novel as it is. That evening, they dine at Theo's house, where Theo's wife, Hermione (Charlotte Rampling), takes an immediate dislike to Angel. Angel becomes a success, publishing several novels. At an event, she meets Nora (Lucy Russell), who is a great admirer of Angel, and her brother, Esmé (Michael Fassbender), an artist. Angel buys Paradise and hires Nora as her personal secretary. She marries Esmé. The Great War breaks out. Esmé enlists and Angel is heartbroken.

Corelli was one of the first writers to become a star, writing bestsellers for an adoring public. Today she has been totally forgotten, even in England.\\" He also mentioned that he considered Olivier Martinez for the role of Esmé, Angel's love interest, and when talking about Lucy Russell, who played Nora, he stated: \\"I saw a lot of actresses for the role of Nora. During the screen tests, I realized that many of them actually wanted to be Angel. As soon as they'd finish reading, they'd say to me \\"I could play Angel too, I am Angel!\\" They had no desire to play a supporting role, whereas Lucy Russell didn't mind. She showed up for her screen test dressed like an old maid, with thick glasses and her hair in a strict bun. She was actually there to play Nora! Of course the role is far less glamorous than that of Angel, but Lucy was smart enough to know that it is often the person in the shadows who gets noticed, even if she's not the one wearing the beautiful dresses. And like Charlotte, Lucy speaks fluent French, so she was my second crutch on the set!\\" Reportedly, the outdoor scenes were shot in bitterly cold weather, and the camera would freeze after a few minutes of shooting, and had to be taken inside and warmed up with hot towels before taken outside again. The actors did not mind this as they too got the chance to warm up.  Reception  Angel received mixed reviews, with a 50% Fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes. However, Matthew Turner of View London called it an \\"Enjoyable, impressively directed melodrama that stays just the right side of kitsch and features a superb performance by Romola Garai.\\" Whilst also stating that \\"The film's biggest problem is that Angel is such a thoroughly obnoxious character that it's impossible to engage with her on an emotional level\\", he ended saying that \\"Ozon's films are always worth watching and Angel is no exception, thanks to great direction and a committed performance from Garai.\\" References External links * Category:2007 films Category:2007 romantic drama films Category:British films Category:British romantic drama films Category:Films based on British novels Category:Films about writers Category:Romantic period films Category:Films directed by François Ozon Category:Films shot in Belgium Category:2007 drama films ","title":"Angel (2007 film)"},{"id":"14969680","text":"Pierce is an unincorporated community in Green County, Kentucky, United States.

Ship history The ship was built in Norway by Kaldnes Mekaniske Verksted of Tønsberg, and delivered in September 1914 to the whaling company A/S Tønsberg Hvalfangeri as the Viking II. In 1925 she was sold to Cia Ballenera del Peru of Callao, Peru, and renamed Río Chira. In January 1928 the ship returned to Norwegian ownership when she was sold to Knutsen O.A.S. Shipping AS and renamed Angola to sail from Praia Amelia near Mossamedes in Angola. In August 1929 she was renamed Suderøy III. In January 1937 she was taken out of whaling service, fitted with a new 160 bhp Wichmann engine, and converted to a seiner under the name Landanes. In 1938 a new 300 bhp 3-cylinder Wichmann engine was installed, and from 1939 she was used to transport the crews of the company's ships calling at Scandinavian ports. During the German occupation of Norway in World War II the ship was requisitioned by the Kriegsmarine and as NS 09 Sindbad was stationed as a patrol boat in Stavanger, serving as part of 51. Vorpostenflottille (\\"51st Guard Flotilla\\"). The ship was returned to Knutsens after the war. By early 1946 she was being operated by Haugesund Dampskibsselskap (\\"Haugesund Steamship Company\\"), as a replacement ship. In 1947 she was converted to a passenger and cargo ship, and under a bareboat charter served with Haugesund Dampskibsselskab on the regular service between Haugesund and Bergen. She also served on the Haugesund-Ryfylke and Haugesund- Stavanger routes. The ship was rebuilt at Frederikshavn in Denmark in 1955, increasing from 199 to , and being fitted with a 420 bhp 6-cylinder Vølund engine. From 1964, as newer ships came into service, Landanes was mostly used as a reserve ship, and was eventually sold in January 1968 to A/S Haugesund Slip, converted into a freighter and renamed Fraktfem. In December 1969 she was sold to Gudmund & Hansen of Svolvær for coastal service, and renamed Eva Karin. However the company went bankrupt, and in November 1972 she was returned to Haugesund Slip, and reverted to the name Fraktfem. In February 1974 she was sold to Fraktsenter A/S of Haugesund, renamed Transport, and employed in the local sand trade. She was sold in May 1976 to Nils Nilsen of Bodø, to serve in the sand trade in Nordland. In 1977 she ran aground at Godøystraumen, but suffered no major damage. However, the elderly ship was finally condemned in late 1981 and laid up. She was sold in May 1982 to Julius Solnes of Borkenes, and towed to Harstad where her engines were stripped out for use in another ship, and the hull was sunk near Svartskjær off Harstad on 6 April 1983.

The screenplay was written by Bertolucci, based on the story Theme of the Traitor and the Hero by Jorge Luis Borges. Plot At the request of his father's mistress, Draifa, Athos Magnani arrives by train in the (fictional) town of Tara, where his father, also named Athos Magnani, was killed before his birth. The father, remembered as a resistance hero and whom his son greatly resembles, was killed by unknown fascists in 1936—or so says Draifa, the statue in the square, and everyone in the town. Draifa contacted Athos after seeing his picture in a newspaper and expects him to solve or avenge his father's murder. He hears that a few days before his father's death, a fortune teller had predicted his death, as in Macbeth, and on his corpse was an unopened letter warning him not to go ahead, as in Julius Caesar. His enquiries about his father's death are met with evasion or hostility. Eventually three acquaintances of his father tell him that he planned to blow up Benito Mussolini in the local theatre, during a performance of Rigoletto. The plot failed and his father died after being betrayed to the police. Athos does not believe this tale. Unsure whether to stay in this claustrophobic town where the truth is never told, he hears the sound of Rigoletto coming from the theatre. Entering, he is told that his father failed to carry out the bombing out of fear, and himself tipped off the police. For this, his fellow conspirators killed him, with his agreement, and ascribed the death to unknown fascists. At a ceremony in front of his father's statue, Athos starts to tell this story but stops. Whether it was through betrayal or cowardice that his father had become a hero, the town, in his view, needs its myth. Resolving to leave, at the railway station he hears announcements that trains are increasingly late and, looking at the tracks, sees they are rusted and overgrown. He, too, is caught in the web. Production The film was co- produced by the Italian television monopoly RAI. Locations included Sabbioneta for most scenes in Tara. The theater's exterior is Sabbioneta's Palazzo Ducale, and its interior is Fidenza's Teatro Magnani. The square of the hotel is in Pomponesco, with a levee in the background. Draifa's villa is the Villa Longari Ponzoni in Rivarolo del Re ed Uniti.

The road provides a direct link from the Trans- Canada Highway (TCH) to downtown St. John's, Newfoundland, which was previously accessible only via city streets such as Topsail Road or Kenmount Road (which was part of the TCH until the Outer Ring Road was built). Initially called the Harbour Arterial, construction began in the early 1970s and was completed in 1979. The $52-million project was funded by the federal and provincial governments. It was renamed by the city council in 1984 after local businessman James Stewart Pitt (1847-1914). The road bypasses Mount Pearl to the south and then runs parallel to the Waterford River on an embankment/cutting along the Southside Hills. It enters the downtown on a concrete viaduct that carries it over the Waterford River valley and the terminus of the former Newfoundland Railway. At the end of the viaduct, it meets New Gower Street which continues into downtown St. John's. As a major route into and out of the city, the road is subject to heavy traffic and has had its share of unfortunate incidents and shutdowns. Route description Route 2 begins as Peacekeeper's Way in Conception Bay South (locally known as C.B.S.) at an at-grade intersection with Route 60 (Conception Bay Highway) in the Seal Cove portion of town. It immediately heads northeast as a two-lane Freeway (super-two) to bypass the town along its southern edge while having interchanges with several local roads, including Route 61 (Foxtrap Access Road) and the Manuels Access Road, where Route 2 wides to a divided four-lane as it enters the town of Paradise. The highway now passes through mainly rural areas before following the Mount Pearl-St. John's city at a large interchange with Route 1 (Trans-Canada Highway). Route 2 now becomes Pitts Memorial Drive and passes through Mount Pearl's southernmost neighbourhoods, where it has an interchange with Route 3 (Robert E Howlett Memorial Drive/Goulds Bypass). This interchange is also proposed to be the eventual southern terminus of Route 3A (Team Gushue Highway). Route 2 now fully enters the St. John's city limits as it passes through farmland just north of Goulds for a few kilometres before entering neighbourhoods at an interchange between Route 10 (Bay Bulls Road) and The Parkway (Columbus Drive) in Kilbride. The highway begins following a ridge overlooking the city as it passes through St. John's southernmost neighbourhoods, crossing over Route 11 (Blackhead Road) without an interchange, before crossing the Waterford River along a concrete viaduct and coming to an end at interchange/at-grade intersection between Water Street, Hamilton Avenue, and New Gower Street in downtown.

(Photo taken in Sweden) Drainage gradient (DG) is a term in road design, defined as the combined slope due to road surface cross slope (CS) and longitudinal slope (hilliness). Although the term may not be used, the concept is also used in roof design and landscape architecture. If the drainage gradient is too low, rain and melt water drainage will be insufficient. This results in water pooling on the road surface, thereby increasing the risk for hydroplaning and wet-pavement vehicle crashes.  Minimum drainage gradient  Most road design manuals require drainage gradient to exceed 0.5%, in order to drain water and prevent excessive skid accidents.[AASHTO \\"A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets\\" (AASHTO Green Book)] One exception to the minimum 0.5% DG limit can be found in the Norwegian road design manual, where the minimum drainage gradient is 2% instead of 0.5%.Håndbok 017 Veg- og Gateutforming  Typical values of drainage gradient  Typically on straight road sections, the drainage gradient is at least 1–3% due to the normal cross slope of 1–3%. In curved sections the drainage gradient is higher, and may often reach 5–12% due to superelevated CS that may reach 5–8% in areas with icy roads and up to 12% in areas without icy roads. The road's longitudinal slope contributes to a high drainage gradient. However, longitudinal highway slopes steeper than 0.5% are surprisingly rare outside hilly or mountainous areas.  Effect of insufficient gradient  Due to the normal cross slope and the interaction with grade, road sections with insufficient drainage gradient are few and short. Still, they account for an unacceptable number of skid accidents. These hot spots are found at the entrances and exits of banked curves, where the cross slope changes direction in order to create superelevation. As the outside edge of the curve is raised (or superelevated) to create the bank, it passes through a point where the cross slope is absolutely flat. If there is not enough longitudinal grade, water will collect at these spots. This takes place at the beginnings and ends of curves to the left in countries with right hand traffic, and curves to the right in countries with left hand traffic. A large study in Sweden has shown that the lanes on the outside of the curve (outercurves) average five times more crashes than lanes on the inner side (innercurves).Analysis of fatal single crashes on Swedish State Highways except expressways 1997-2000, Swedish Road Administration publ 2002:109 This finding can partially be explained by the entrances and exits of banked outercurves having insufficient DG.Roadex III report on \\"Health issues related to poorly maintained road networks\\"  Minimizing insufficient drainage gradient  Roads should be designed so that sections where the cross slope change direction (and sign), are located where the road is going uphill or downhill. Otherwise the pavement will get an area with too little drainage gradient (< 0.5%), resulting in unacceptable skid accident risk. When designing road curves in a flat landscape, it may be necessary to design long wave undulations on purpose. These \\"synthetic\\" longitudinal gradients can then be used to reach a sufficient drainage gradient, in sections where the cross slope is close to zero. Another option to minimize crash risk due to low DG at entrance or exit of banked outercurves, is to move the superelevation further from the curve and out to a straight road section. This results in a banked straight lane. This design can yield another risk, since the water film (when raining) on an adjacent lane may become thicker. However, this is on a straight section where the lack of road curvature minimize the lateral forces and thus keep the skid risk low. Yet an option is to – within the superelevation transition section – increase the cross slope \\"tilt rate\\" within the zone where the cross slope is between −0.5 to +0.5%.  Maintenance  As roads are worn down by tire wear, wheelpath rutting often interrupts the DG, and water will collect in the wheelpaths. This is more prevalent on asphalt pavement, but concrete pavements are not immune. Before wet pavement crashes reach unacceptable levels, maintenance actions such as resurfacing or diamond grinding should be taken, even if other pavement distress such as cracking is still low.

It belonged to the Beaumont-Bressuire family until the start of the 16th century.Le château de Bressuire, Histoire et Patrimoine du Bressuirais The castle is a fine example of medieval military architecture. In 1190, the castle consisted of an enceinte almost 700 metres around, with 38 towers circling the first fortress, itself defended by eight towers. The visible remains date essentially from the end of the 12th and the start of the 13th century. The fortress included three enceintes, of which the outermost has now disappeared. The castle was broken up during the first half of the 18th century. In 1441, Jacques de Beaumont became Seigneur de Bressuire. He converted the castle into a beautiful residence. From this time date the large building closing off the courtyard, that has mullion windows, splendid granite chimneys in the private rooms and an elegant gallery, all intended to show the refinement of the owner. The castle subsequently belonged to a number of families but its maintenance was ignored. In 1876, the building partly collapsed. The Bernard family bought the castle the same year.

Lupus was born at Ypres (Flanders). He joined the Augustinian Order at the age of fifteen, and on the completion of his studies, was appointed lecturer in theology, to the younger members of the order in Cologne. While occupying this position he won the confidence of the nuncio at Cologne, Fabio Chigi (later Pope Alexander VII). In 1640 Lupus was appointed professor of theology at the University of Leuven (French: Louvain), but, owing to his zeal for the teaching of St. Augustine, was suspected of Jansenism. The nuncio at Brussels accused him of it, and would not permit the University of Leuven to confer a doctor's degree upon him; only after the pope's mediation was it given to him. When the accusation was renewed, Alexander VII called him to Rome, where for the next five years he devoted himself under papal protection to the study of ecclesiastical history. He returned to Leuven in 1660, and was elected provincial of the province; in 1667 he returned to Rome, accompanied by several professors of the theological faculty of Leuven. Innocent XI condemned sixty-five of the propositions denounced by him. On his return to Leuven he was appointed Regius Professor of theology, the first time a religious had ever held this office. He remained there until his death. His writings were published in thirteen parts, the first twelve in Venice, 1724–1729, in six folio volumes, the thirteenth in Bologna, in 1742. The first six under the title Synodorum generalium et provincialium statuta et canones cum notis et historicis dissertationibus (1665–1673) contain a detailed history of the councils, with many dissertations. The seventh part contains: Ad Ephesinum concilium variorum patrum epistolas, item commonitorium Coelestini papae, titulos decretorum Hilarii papae (Louvain, 1682).

During World War II, LST-247 was assigned to the Pacific theater and participated in the following operations: * Bougainville – February 1944 * Invasion of Hollandia – April 1944 * Invasion of Guam – July 1944 * Invasion of Iwo Jima – February 1945 LST-247 beached at Kukum Beach, on the US-held island of Guadalcanal on 21 January 1944 accompanied by LSTs 399 and 200. She delivered over 500 tons of deck cargo, 170 tons of rolling cargo, 14 officers, and 235 enlisted men from the 106th Reconnaissance Squadron. Immediately following this, LST-247 then headed for Bougainville, where she delivered additional troops and equipment. In February the crew shot down a Japanese Betty Bomber. In late March, the crew received orders to sail for Milne Bay, New Guinea, where they began preparations for the Hollandia invasion at Aitape. The ship beached at Aitape at sunrise on 23 April but damaged her anchor winch. She managed to retract from the beach by sunset. LST-247 set sail for Saipan in June 1944, where there were run-ins with the Japanese. The task group came under attack by torpedo planes on two separate occasions, and during one incident, shot down friendly aircraft when it approached unexpectedly. The ship's task during the Guam invasion was in picking up casualties and bringing them to Pearl Harbor, where she arrived in August 1944. She underwent maintenance and resumed sail in January 1945, where she participated in the February amphibious assault on the Japanese stronghold island of Iwo Jima. She retracted from Iwo Jima after spending nearly a month on the beach. By April 1945, LST-247 was back at Pearl Harbor. She set sail for Seattle to undergo extensive repairs. In August, she arrived at Pearl Harbor, where she was redesignated as a Landing Ship Tank (Hospital) LST(H)-247 on 15 September 1945.

Constructed by the Works Progress Administration, it was completed in 1937 and is owned by Belknap County. Activities include alpine and cross-country skiing, snow tubing, ski jumping, snowshoeing, hiking, and swimming. History Lake Winnipesaukee, with Mount Washington and the snow-capped Presidential Range on the horizon Originally known as Belknap Mountain Recreation Area, Gunstock Mountain Resort was built by the Works Progress Administration, a New Deal agency that provided employment and created public works projects throughout the United States during the Great Depression. Hussey Manufacturing Company of North Berwick, Maine, led hundreds of previously unemployed laborers in the development of the recreation area, which transformed the economy of the region. The resort had the first chairlift in the eastern United States. After the completion of the 60-meter ski jump, the first meet was held in February 1937. The original Gunstock chairlift development was located on Mount Rowe. This single-chairlift- serviced ski area was eventually phased out when two double chairlifts were installed to the Gunstock Mountain summit. Some of the old trails are still visible today. In keeping with the gun theme, most of the trails are named for guns (i.e. Pistol, Musket, and Flintlock) or gun parts (i.e. Ramrod and Trigger). Gunstock underwent a significant capital improvement plan in the 1980s with the installation of the Tiger Triple, the Summit Triple (replacing the two summit double chairlifts), and the Ramrod Quad. 61% of the resort's 55 trails are designated Intermediate in difficulty. In the summer of 2003, the Summit Triple Chairlift was moved to the Pistol Complex to replace the Pistol Double. A brand-new detachable quad chairlift manufactured by Doppelmayr CTEC, Panorama, was built in its place. This was the first UNI-GS chairlift in the entire world, and cut the ride to the summit in half, making it a six-minute trip. In the summer of 2009, Gunstock underwent a $4 million expansion effort to make the mountain more family-friendly and easier for learners. The biggest project was the installation of a new fixed-grip, quad chairlift placed near the Gunshy Double Chairlift. This chairlift now has access to the new beginner-friendly complex that was constructed as part of the expansion effort. There are four new trails, and existing trails were lengthened and made wider. In addition, the mountain expanded their snow-making capabilities by 66% over the entire mountain. The top terminal of Gunstock's Panorama High Speed Quad At the Pistol complex side of the mountain, two trails gained snow- making capabilities.

The Magnuson M80 range was available from the late 1970s and was successful when IBM struggled to ship machines. The company declared bankruptcy in March 1983 after IBM introduced new models and reduced prices. The Magnuson processors were aimed at the lower end of IBM's product line. They had a number of unique design features. Perhaps the most notable was the voting logic on each processor card. (This needs to be verified, we don't think this is correct about voting logic) All of the slots in the main chassis were interchangeable. All slots were filled on only the high end model. (the following may be incorrect about any such capability on the M80/30-32 or M80/42-43) If a card was suspected of having a problem, you could test it by adding two more copies of the same card and they would \\"vote\\" before putting any data onto the system bus.

It is a shrub with yellow flowers which change colour through red to almost black as they age. There are two varieties which vary in their leaf shape, their flower colour and some of the structures in the flower. Description Verticordia acerosa is a shrub which grows to a height of about and has a single, branching stem. The leaves on the lower part of the stem are linear in shape, pointed, long and dished or almost circular in cross-section. The leaves near the flowers are lance-shaped to egg-shaped or almost circular. The flower-cup is top-shaped, long, glabrous, covered with small lumps and has 10 ribs. The petals are shaped like fingers on a hand, and yellow, turning to red. Flowering time is from August to November, from September in southern parts of the plant's range. Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described by John Lindley in 1839 and the description was published in A Sketch of the Vegetation of the Swan River Colony. The specific epithet (acerosa) is a Latin word meaning \\"full of chaff\\". There are two varieties: * V. acerosa Lindl. var. acerosa which has its staminodes fringed with hairs, upper leaves that are lance-shaped to egg- shaped and bright yellow young flowers; * V. acerosa var. preissii (Schauer) A.S.George which has staminodes with toothed margins, elliptic to almost circular upper leaves and lemon-yellow young flowers. When Alex George reviewed the genus Verticordia in 1991, he placed this species in subgenus Chrysoma, section Chrysoma along with V. citrella, V. subulata, V. endlicheriana. Distribution and habitat The variety acerosa grows in lateritic soils in Jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) and Marri (Corymbia calophylla) forest or in sand in heath along the Darling Scarp or at the foot of the range between Forrestfield and Cannington. The variety preissii is more widely distributed across the south-west of Western Australia between Coorow and the Fitzgerald River National Park. It grows in a wide range of soils and vegetation associations, often with other species of verticordias in the Avon Wheatbelt, Jarrah Forest and Mallee biogeographic regions. Conservation status Verticordia acerosa is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture This verticordia was first grown in gardens in England in 1842. It can be propagated from cuttings and by seed, some garden specimens having self-sown. Its foliage, red young stems and bright yellow, perfumed flowers make this an attractive garden specimen. The variety preissii is often a more striking, compact small shrub with larger heads of flowers than the type variety. Both varieties need to be grown in light soils in a sunny location. They are usually frost tolerant but sometimes suffer from fungal infections.

An example of this is: :What the guests need for breakfast is an omelette. Here, the theme—the grammatical point of departure—is in bold text; it announces at the start to the listener or reader what the message will be about—the writer's or speaker's angle (\\"I'm going to tell you what they need for breakfast\\"). The rheme (the rest of the clause) is in regular text. This type of clause sets up the theme-plus-rheme structure in the form of an equation, where theme = rheme. The equation is always expressed by some form of the verb be.Halliday MAK (1967/8) Notes on transitivity and theme in English 1–3, Journal of Linguistics, 3.1, 3.2 and 4.2:3–4 A thematic equative allows for all possible parts of a clause to be shifted to the start, to be the theme, so that the message can be structured in whatever way the speaker or writer wants. For example: :An omelette is what the guests need for breakfast. [I'm going to tell you something about an omelette.] Many common expressions are what are known as marked thematic equatives; these expressions include those that start with \\"That's why ...\\" and \\"That's what ...\\" (\\"That's why you can't do it,\\" \\"That's what I meant\\").Halliday MAK, revised by Matthiesson CM (2004), An introduction to functional grammar, 3rd ed., Hodder Arnold: London, 70 A unique feature of the thematic equative is its conveying of a meaning of exclusiveness in the rheme.Halliday MAK, revised by Matthiesson CM (2004), An introduction to functional grammar, 3rd ed., Hodder Arnold: London, 71 In all of these examples, the meaning is that the only thing the guests need for breakfast is an omelet. This is in contrast with \\"The guests need an omelette for breakfast,\\" which leaves open the possibility that they also need other things for breakfast.

It is a small, densely- branched shrub with cylinder shaped stem leaves that differ from those near the flowers, and small yellow flowers in groups near the ends of the branches. Description Verticordia citrella is a shrub with a single stem at the base but highly branched, growing to a height of up to and a width of up to . The leaves on the stems are linear in shape, round in cross-section, long and taper to a point. Those near the flowers are broad elliptic to almost circular and long. The flowers are faintly scented, arranged in round or corymb-like groups on erect stalks long. The floral cup is top-shaped, about long, glabrous and slightly warty. The sepals are yellow, long, with 5 or 6 lobes with hairy fringes. The petals are also yellow, and have long, spreading finger-like lobes. The style is long, straight and glabrous. Flowering time is from October to November. The species V. acerosa is closely related and similar but it has larger leaves and larger flowers, and the flowers turn red or darker colours as they age. Taxonomy and naming Verticordia citrella was first formally described by Alex George in 1991 from specimens collected between Perth and Toodyay by Alex and Elizabeth George. The description was published in Nuytsia. The specific epithet (citrella) is derived from the Latin adjective citreus meaning \\"of lemon-yellow colour\\" with the suffix -ella making the adjective diminutive, referring to the colour and small size of the flowers. George placed this species in subgenus Chrysoma, section Chrysoma along with V. acerosa, V. subulata, V. endlicheriana. Distribution and habitat This verticordia usually grows in sand that is damp in winter, in open shrubland. It only occurs in a single nature reserve between Perth and Toodyay. Conservation Verticordia citrella is classified as \\"Priority Two\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife meaning that it is poorly known and from only one or a few locations. Use in horticulture Verticordia citrella has been grown in Western Australia in well-drained soil and has flowered prolifically in sunny positions. It has been more difficult to grow in eastern Australia but has survived in containers for 3 or 4 years. It has been propagated from cuttings but plants grown in deep sand have sometimes self-sown from seed.

There was a spur to the factory.Sørensen (1995): 49 The line formerly continued past Dalen Station () through the Trosvik Tunnel before terminating at Brevik Station (). In Brevik there was a spur which ran down to the port. History =Planning= The first public meeting for planning a railway in the Grenland region was conducted on 19 January 1874. At a second meeting on 28 January a planning committee was appointed, with representatives from the various municipalities in the area. It proposed three alternative routes for a railway: a continuation of the proposed Vestfold Line from Larvik, a railway down the valley of Lågendalen from Kongsberg, or a link from the Kongsberg–Drammen Line via Siljan to Skien. The Vestfold alternative was the cheapest and was thus preferred.Sørensen (1995): 9 The committee's proposals called for a branch from the Vestfold Line to Brevik, although it would run from Porsgrunn via Roligheten and Kleveland.Sørensen (1995): 10 The branch was estimated to cost 226,000 Norwegian speciedaler. Two thirds would be financed by the state and the remaining 70,000 speciedaler would have to be financed through local purchase of shares in the railway company. Brevik Municipality bought half the shares, but it was not possible to fill up the quota with private sales. When Parliament voted over the construction of the Vestfold Line in 1875, the branch to Brevik was dismissed. Discussion of a branch to Brevik resumed in 1887, when parliamentarian Livius Smitt proposed for Parliament a line from Eidanger to Brevik on behalf of the municipal council. It was considered by the legislature in 1888, but only 39 parliamentarians supported it, compared to the 68 who voted the proposal down. Thus the following year detailed planning commenced to better the political support for a line. Funding for the Brevik Line was dismissed by Parliament again in 1890, but the following year, on 4 July 1890, a majority voted in favor of the line. The condition was that 30,000 Norwegian krone (NOK) be funded locally. Most of the railway would be located in the former Eidanger Municipality. Eidanger Municipal Council was not particularly interested in the railway, and was not willing to pay for expropriation in their own municipality. Thus Brevik Municipality was forced to pay for all expropriation along the line and limited their support for the entire project to NOK 16,000. Brevik Municipal Council passed the plans and their financing on 31 March 1893. However, there was not community consensus as to the location of Brevik Station, with large camps each preferring Strømtangen and Setretangen.Sørensen (1995): 11 The municipal council voted in favor of Strømtangen on 25 June.Sørensen (1995): 12 =Construction= Built by the Norwegian State Railways, construction commenced in 1892 and was initially estimated to take one year. However, it took three years, largely because of inferior geological conditions, in part caused by clay in the ground. Construction did fall within the NOK 750,000 budget. Of this, Brevik Municipality ended up paying NOK 90,000, which would stand as a major burden for them for years. Export of ice for cooling was a major industry in Eidanger from the 1850s to the 1970s. There were several small dammed-up ice lakes, and four of these had to be expropriated to give way for the railway.Sørensen (1995): 27 The construction work was initially led by S. H. Strøm, and from January 1894 by M. Olsen. Surveying started in May 1894 and allowed negotiations for expropriation to commence in the fall, which lasted a half year. Earthwork hauling started in the spring of 1893, first with 100 men and by the summer increasing to 200.Sørensen (1995): 24 Spurs of the Brevik Line at Dalen Portland Cement in the late 1910s All wages were paid as piece work. Work was conducted for ten hours, six days a week and paid an average NOK 3.05 per hour. A labor union was established on 28 July 1893. Most of the workers were nomadic navvies which moved to the area for the period they worked on the line, and then moved onwards to a new project. A significant portion of the works were Swedish.Sørensen (1995): 26 Earthwork was dug using spades and picks. Horses were only used for hauling heavy stones. Most of the work was conducted in clay, limestone and Disambiguated: dolomite. The telegraph cables were laid in early 1895. To match Vestfold Line, the railway was built with narrow gauge ().Sørensen (1995): 71 The official opening took place on 15 October 1895, officiated by King Oscar II.Sørensen (1995): 29 =Operational history= An important function of the line was that it allowed correspondence with the coastal ferry route onwards to Kristiansand, which commenced in 1896 because Brevik at the time was the furthest along the coast the railway had reached.Sørensen (1995): 40 A daily night train with direct service to Oslo was offered, initially with a travel time of six hours and seven minutes. Tickets for the two could be purchased together and the ferry would wait up to an hour for a delayed train. This was supplemented with a direct commuter service to Porsgrunn, initially bringing the number of daily trains to 20. The exact number varied throughout the years, but did not exceed 26 until the 1950s.Sørensen (1995): 35 The arrival of the railway led to growth in Brevik, as it created numerous jobs both in the railway and shipping industry. Although the passenger service first and foremost served commuters into Porsgrunn and Skien, it also saw a large reverse traffic of city-dwellers travel to the Eidangerfjord to recreate. In July and August NSB sold 9,600 tickets to the segment. This further resulted in the growth in summer cabins in the area built by the affluent.Sørensen (1995): 59 A section of the railway next to the Eidangerfjord Plans for a railway ferry service to Continental Europe were launched in 1912, when representatives from market towns along the coast from Vestfold to Agder were called to discuss the matter. Council Carl Stousland was the main initiator, and visited various ports in Denmark searching for a suitable site. By 1915 he had settled on Frederikshavn and stated that it would provide the fastest service from Norway to Hamburg, Germany. Two ferries would be required, each using seven hours on a crossing and allowing for two return services per day. However, Stousland never succeeded at realizing the plans.Sørensen (1995): 53 Plans to drop the night service were articulated in 1903, but discarded. However, the poor timing for passengers from Drammen and Vestfold, in addition to surplus cost of keeping sleeping cars, forced the night service to a halt from 1918. Instead a late evening service was run, terminating at Brevik at 01:25.Sørensen (1995): 37 To secure compatibility with the Bratsberg Line, which had been opened in 1917, the section of track past Grenland to Eidanger and onwards to Brevik was converted to standard gauge in 1921. When it opened on 16 June it succeeded a period of four years where the segment from Eidanger to Skien had dual gauge. From the same year the Oslo service was re-routed via the Bratsberg Line and Kongsvinger to Oslo.Sørensen (1995): 38 A spur to the cement factory at Dalen was built in the early 1920s, but removed again during the late 1940s. In general the local trains to Skien were hauled using a NSB Class 32 steam locomotives, and the express train by NSB Class 30. With the extension of the Sørlandet Line to Kragerø with the 1927 opening of the Kragerø Line, Brevik was no longer the outermost railway station along the southern coast. Long- haul and postal traffic was lost, and by 1934 the coastal ferry service was terminated. In cooperation with commercial interests, NSB ran a summer service from Kongsberg marketed as the \\"bathing train\\" to attract inlanders to the coast. Ridership peaked in 1920, when 362,384 passengers traveled on the line. Initially the freight traffic was minimal, with between three and four thousand tonnes in the early 1920. This was soon boosted and hit 25,000 tonnes in the 1930s.Aspenberg (1994): 158 A halt at Ørvik opened on 26 June 1923 and on 27 July 1933 halts were opened at Prestealléen, Mule, Valen and Dalen.Sørensen (1995): 72–74 A spur to Heistad Fabrikker opened in 1936. Brevik Station with the Brevik Bridge in the background The Brevik Line opened with electric traction from 19 June 1949, along with the Bratsberg Line through Grenland. Thus electric trains from Oslo could reach Brevik via that route. The Vestfold Line would not be electrified until the mid-1950s.Norwegian National Rail Administration (2009): 34 With the electrification the line saw a major increase in traffic—by 1951 there were eighteen round trips and nineteen from 1957, operating at a fixed, hourly headway. Following the 1962 opening of the Brevik Bridge the railway saw a sharp decline in patronage as the bus service was rerouted, capturing more of the traffic. Thus NSB decided to terminate the commuter trains to Skien from 1 February 1964. The express trains followed suit and since 26 May 1968 there has only been freight trains on the line. A spur line to Isola Fabrikker opened on 1966 and a new spur line to the cement factory opened on 30 September 1974, replacing an aerial tramway. Norcem has since been the main customer for freight trains on the line, with 900,000 tonnes of limestone hauled in 1998. Proposals for reopening the line were launched in 1989, but never materialized. Grenland Harbour upgraded the port terminal at Tangen during the late 1980s and a branch to the Grenland Terminal was opened in 1993, with the port authority hoping that an international ferry service would be started. However, the plans never materialized. Two El 13 locomotives collided at Norcem on 18 September 1998, although neither motorman was seriously injured. CargoNet started a weekly container train service each from Brevik to Oslo and Bergen in 2014, allowing for transit from ship traffic.

Diehl (January 29, 1847 - April 7, 1913) was a German-American mechanical engineer and inventor who held several U.S. patents, including electric incandescent lamps, electric motors for sewing machines and other uses, and ceiling fans. Diehl was a contemporary of Thomas Edison and his inventions caused Edison to reduce the price of his incandescent bulb. He occasionally spelled his first name 'Phillip'.Diehl spelled and signed his first name 'Phillip' in his US patent 208838, awarded 8 October 1878 In July 1868, he immigrated to New York City where he worked in several machine shops before finding work as an apprentice with the Singer Manufacturing Company. In 1870 or 1871 he was transferred to Chicago, Illinois and worked at Remington Machine Company until 1875. He lost all of his possessions in the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. In 1873, Diehl married Emilie Loos in Chicago.\\"Diehl's Lamp Hit Edison Monopoly,\\" Elizabeth Daily Journal, Friday Evening, October 25, 1929 In 1875, Diehl moved to Elizabeth, New Jersey and took charge of experimental work improving sewing machines at the Singer plant. His daughter, Clara Elvira, was born April 2, 1876. Inventions While working at Singer in Elizabeth, Diehl experimented at work and at his home. This resulted in several inventions. =Electric light= Working in the basement of his home on Orchard Street in Elizabeth, New Jersey, Diehl invented a lamp that was different from Thomas Edison's incandescent electric lamp, which was patented in 1879. Diehl's lamp had no lead-in wires. In 1882 Diehl obtained the first patent on this induction incandescent lamp. The base of the lamp contained a wire coil that coupled with a primary coil in the lamp socket, causing current to flow through the lamp without the need for lead-in wires. Two additional patents were granted in 1883, followed by patents for electrical lighting systems in 1885 and 1886. Following is a partial list of lamp or lighting related patents issued to Philip Diehl: *U.S. No. 255,497, Incandescent Electric Lamp, March 28, 1882 *U.S. No. 272,125, Electric Incandescent Lamp, February 13, 1883 *U.S. No. 276,571, Incandescent Electric Lamp, May 1, 1883 *U.S. No. 314,567, Electric Arc Lamp, March 31, 1885 *U.S. No. 350,482, Electric Lighting System, October 12, 1886 Diehl erected the city's first arc light in front of the Corey Building in Elizabeth, which still stands at 109 Broad Street. Diehl's invention of the induction lamp was used by George Westinghouse to force royalty concessions from Thomas Edison. The Westinghouse Company bought Diehl's patent rights for $25,000. Although Diehl's lamp could not be made and sold at a price to compete with the Edison lamp, the Westinghouse Company used the Diehl bulb to force the holders of the Edison patent to charge a more reasonable rate for the use of the Edison patent rights. =Electric engines= Diehl's work at Singer to improve the sewing machine led to developments in electric motors, first to power sewing machines and later for other uses as well. In 1884 at the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania he demonstrated a dynamo, modeled after his smaller motor, which generated a current for arc lamps, sewing machine motors and incandescent lamps, all covered by his patents. The judicial committee at the exhibition judged it to be one of the best dynamos exhibited.\\"Philip Diehl\\", History of Union County, New Jersey, Vol 2, A. Van Doren Honeyman, 1923, pp 117-118. =Ceiling fan= The fan was invented in 1882 by Schuyler Skaats Wheeler. A few years later, Philip Diehl mounted a fan blade on a sewing machine motor and attached it to the ceiling, inventing the ceiling fan, which he applied for patent in August which was granted on November 12th, 1889. (; ) Later, he added a light fixture to the ceiling fan. Later in 1904, Diehl and Co. added a split-ball joint, allowing it to be redirected; three years later, this developed into the first oscillating fan. Death Philip Diehl died on April 7, 1913 in Elizabeth, New Jersey.Obituary Notes, Philip H. Diehl, The New York Times, Tuesday, April 8, 1913, page 13, column 6.

Use and definition  Military sexual trauma is used by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and defined in federal lawCounseling and treatment for sexual trauma, 38 U.S.C. § 1720D(a)(1), https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/38/1720D (defining \\"sexual trauma\\"). as \\"psychological trauma, which in the judgment of a VA mental health professional, resulted from a physical assault of a sexual nature, battery of a sexual nature, or sexual harassment which occurred while the Veteran was serving on active duty, active duty for training, or inactive duty training\\". Sexual harassment \\"... means repeated, unsolicited verbal or physical contact of a sexual nature which is threatening in character\\".38 U.S.C. § 1720D(f), https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/38/1720D#f The behavior may include physical force, threats of negative consequences, implied promotion, promises of favored treatment, or intoxication of either the perpetrator or the victim or both. Sexual assault Military Sexual Assault (MSA) is a subset of MST that does not include sexual harassment. MSA adversely affects thousands of service members during active military duty. Gross et al. (2018) defines MSA as \\"[i]ntentional sexual contact characterized by the use of force, threats, intimidation, or abuse of authority or when the victim does not or cannot consent that has occurred at any point during active-duty military.\\" MSA frequently causes survivors—both men and women—to develop mental disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety disorders, and depressive disorders. PTSD is a mental health diagnosis that can occur after a traumatic event including combat. Factors related to higher risk of MSA are; \\"younger age, enlisted rank, being nonmarried, and low educational achievement\\". 15%-49% of women and 1.5%-22.5% of men experience sexual trauma prior to military service which has been shown to increase one's risk of sexual assault later on. MSA occurs more often in sexual and gender minorities. MSA occurs within an institution which may perpetuate trauma symptoms. = Institutional betrayal = Survivors of MSA often work alongside their perpetrators which accounts for the Institutional Betrayal that survivors experience in the military. Institutional Betrayal is defined as \\"an organization's action (or inactions) are complicit in a person's trauma, especially when the traumatized person depends on the institution\\". Institutional Betrayal can occur to anyone who trusts or depends on an organization. Distrust among service members can increase when finding out about another person's MSA. Research suggests that female veterans are less likely to trust their institution after MSA than male veterans. MSA has been shown to occur more in the Navy and Marines than in other branches of the military. = Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression = Research has shown that sexual assault can contribute to PTSD, substance use, and depression. Experiencing MSA has been connected to developing PTSD and depression at a higher rate than if an individual does not experience MSA. However, MSA is connected to PTSD in female and male veterans while depression just among female veterans. MSA, in combinations with other military stressors, can cause mental health problems. MSA in transgender veterans resulted in PTSD, depression, and personality disorders. = Substance Use Disorder (SUD) = Female veterans who experience MST are at an increased risk for SUD. The prevalence of AUD doubled in female veterans suffering from MST (10.2% positive for MST vs. 4.7% negative for MST). Additionally, SUD commonly occurs alongside Posttraumatic Stress (PTS) and PTSD. In female veterans, research shows that MSA survivors with high PTS symptomatology are more likely to report SUD. The increases in SUD diagnosis and MST calls for trauma- informed treatment. = Male veterans = Sexual assault happens to men within the military as well. Men who experience sexual assault may have issues with reporting based on stigma. Male veterans who experienced sexual assault were twice as likely to attempt suicide than male veterans who had not been sexually assaulted. Research has shown that Iraqi/Afghanistan-era male veterans reporting MSA displayed higher negative functional and psychiatric outcomes. Studies have also shown that MSA in male veterans did not result in significant problems with controlling violent behavior, incarceration, or lower social support. 3-12% of men have experienced MSA. = Female veterans = In females, harassment in the military is associated with higher rates of PTSD. Research suggests that female veterans experience MSA more than male veterans. For female veterans in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Iraqi Freedom, MSA is a significant predictor of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). These female veterans all experienced combat and therefore MSA was not a significant predictor of PTSD whereas combat stress was. 9-41% of female veterans have experienced MSA. = Gender and sexual minorities =  Lesbian, gay, bisexual (LGB) veterans  LGB veterans are more likely to have PTSD symptoms than heterosexual individuals after being exposed to combat stress and other factors. PTSD symptomatology, in LGB Veterans, is linked to depression and substance use. LGB veterans have a higher rate of lifetime sexual assault some of which can occur during military service. Research suggests that LGB veterans experience MSA at a higher rate than non- LGB veterans. Gay and Bisexual male veterans are more likely to experience MSA than non-LGB male veterans. There is a significantly higher rate of PTSD in LGB female veterans than non-LGB female veterans. Regarding prevalence: *15.5% of gay, bisexual male veterans compared to 3.5% non-LGB male veterans report MSA. *41.2% PTSD rate in LGB female veterans compared to 29.8% non-LGB female veterans.  Transgender veterans  At this point, there is very little research done on MST and/or MSA with transgender veterans. The Minority Stress Model has been used to explain the impact of MSA and other stressors on the mental health of transgender veterans. Minority stress refers to chronic stress experienced by individuals within a stigmatized group. Distal Minority Stressors have been defined as; \\"external events of prejudice and discrimination\\". Whereas Proximal Minority Stressors have been defined as; \\"internal processes, such as feelings of stress, anxiety, and concern, regarding concealment of true gender identity\\". Studies have found that MSA is associated with minority stress and should be processed with transgender veterans along with the trauma of MSA. Regarding prevalence: *17.2% of transgender veterans reported MSA. *30% of transgender men serving as women reported MSA. *15.2% of transgender women serving as men reported MSA. Prevalence Military sexual trauma is a serious issue faced by the United States armed forces. In 2012, 13,900 men and 12,100 women who were active duty service members reported unwanted sexual contactDepartment of Defense (2012) http://www.ncdsv.org/images/DoD_Active-duty-service-members-reporting- unwanted-sexual-contact.pdf while in 2016, 10,600 men and 9,600 women reported being sexually assaulted.Department of Defense Annual Report on Sexual Assault in the Military Fiscal Year 2015 (2016). Retrieved from http://www.sapr.mil/public/docs/reports/FY15_Annual/FY15_Annual_Report_on_Sexual_Assault_in_the_Military.pdf Further, there were 5,240 official reports of sexual assault involving service members as victims in 2016; however, it is estimated that 77% of service member sexual assaults go unreported. More specifically, prevalence of MST among veterans returning from Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) in Afghanistan and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) in Iraq, was reported to be as high as 15.1% among females and 0.7% among males.Department of Defense Task Force on Sexual Violence. (2004) Sexual Harassment Survey of Reserve Component Members. Available at http://www.ncdsv.org/images/DOD_SexualHarassmentSurveyReserveComponentMembers_2004.pdf In a study conducted in 2014, 196 female veterans who had deployed to OIF and/or OEF were interviewed and 41% of them reported experiencing MST.Department of Defense (2014). Demographics. Profile of the Military Community. Retrieved from http://download.militaryonesource.mil/12038/MOS/Reports/2014-Demographics- Report.pdf As a result of these and similar findings, 17 former service members filed a lawsuit in 2010 accusing the Department of Defense of allowing a military culture that fails to prevent rapes and sexual assaults. According to the Department of Defense Task Force on Sexual Violence (2004) perpetrators of sexual assault were often male, serving in the military, and knew the victim well. Reporting Currently, the U.S. military allows victims of MST to make either restricted or unrestricted reports of sexual assault. This two tier system includes restricted (anonymous) and unrestricted reporting. A restricted report, allows victims to receive access to counseling and medical resources without disclosing their assault to authorities or seeking litigation against the perpetrator(s). This is different from an unrestricted report which involves seeking criminal charges against the perpetrator, eliminating anonymity.Conrad, P.L., Young, C., Hogan, L., & Armstrong, M.L. (2014). Encountering women veterans with military sexual trauma. Perspectives in Psychiatric Care, 50, 280-286 The restricted reporting option is meant to reduce negative social consequences suffered by MST survivors, increase MST reporting and in doing so improve the accuracy of information concerning MST prevalence. According to the DOD Annual Report on Sexual Assault in the Military (2016) in 2015, there were 4,584 Unrestricted Reports involving Service members as either victims or subjects and 1,900 Restricted Reports involving Service members as either victims or subjects. The Services do not investigate Restricted Reports and do not record the identities of alleged perpetrators. Service members who experience MST are eligible for medical care, mental healthcare, legal services, and spiritual support related to MST through the VA. U.S. military members appear to fear repercussions, retaliation, and the stigma associated with reporting MST. The reasons service members do not report military sexual assaults include concerns about confidentiality, wanting to \\"move on\\", not wanting to seem \\"weak\\", fear about career repercussions, fear of stigmatization, and worry about retaliation by superiors and fellow service members.Greene-Shortridge, T.M., Britt, T..W., & Castro, C.A. (2007). The stigma of mental health problems in the military. Military Medicine, 172(2), 157-161 Additionally, survivors of MST may believe that nothing will be done if they report a sexual assault, they may blame themselves, and/or they may fear for their reputation. =Effects of stigma on reporting rates= Stigma is a significant deterrent to reporting MST. Many military service members do not report sexual abuse due to fear about not being believed, worry about career impact, fear of retribution, or because their victimization will be minimized with comments such as \\"suck it up\\".Valente, S. & Wright, C. (2007). Military Sexual Trauma: Violence and Sexual Abuse. Military Medicine, 172 (3), 259-265 Additionally, perceived stigma associated with seeking mental health treatment after experiencing MST affects reporting. Service members often do not disclose any type of trauma (sexual assault or battlefield trauma) until asked specifically by a mental health professional due to mental health stigma, worry about career difficulties, or because they wish to preserve their masculine image.Brown, N. B., & Bruce, S. E. (2015). Stigma, Career Worry, and Mental Illness Symptomatology: Factors Influencing Treatment-Seeking for Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom Soldiers and Veterans. Psychological Trauma: Theory, Research, Practice, And Policy, doi:10.1037/tra0000082. Additionally, reporting MST sometimes results in an individual being diagnosed with a personality disorder, resulting in a discharge other than honorable, and reducing access to benefits from the VA or state.Human Rights Watch. Booted. Lack of Recourse for wrongfully discharged US military rape survivors. (2016). https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/report_pdf/us0516_militaryweb_1.pdf A diagnosis of a personality disorder also discounts or minimizes the credibility of the victim and may result in stigmatization by the civilian community. Many survivors of MST report that they experience rejection from the military and feel incompetent after an Unrestricted Report.Northcut, T.B., & Kienow, A. (2014). The trauma trifecta of military sexual trauma: A case study illustrating the integration of mind and body in clinical work with survivors of MST. Clinical Social Work, 42, 247-259. DOI 10.1007/s10615-014-0479-0 =Consequences of reporting= In spite of increased access to medical and mental health resources there are also important drawbacks to unrestricted reports of MST. MST survivors often report a loss of professional and personal identity. They are also at increased risk of re-traumatization and retaliation through the process of getting help. Service members may experience re-traumatization through blame, misdiagnosis, and being questioned about the validity of their experience. Retaliation from reporting a sexual complaint may have distressing consequences for the victim and weakens the respectful culture of the military. Retaliation can refer to reprisal, ostracism, maltreatment or abusive behavior by co-workers, exclusion by peers, or disruption of their career. The Department of Defense Task Force on Sexual Violence (2004) reported that unkind gossip was the most common problem that members experienced at work in response to a MST report. In 2015, 68% of survivors reported at least one negative experience associated with their report of sexual assault. The Department of Defense Annual Report on Sexual Assault in the Military (2016) indicates that approximately 61% of retaliation reports involved a man or multiple men as alleged retaliators, while nearly 27% of reports included multiple men and women as retaliators. The majority (73%) of retaliators were not the alleged perpetrator of the associated sexual assault or sexual harassment. More than half (58%) of the alleged retaliators were in the chain of command of the reporter, followed by peers, co-workers, friends, or family members of the reporter, or a superior not in the reporters chain of command. Infrequently (7%), the alleged sexual perpetrator was also the alleged retaliator. 85% of the members of the military are active duty and male. Although more men than women in the military experience sexual assault, a larger proportion of female victims report their assault to military authorities. In 2004, of service members who said they reported their experiences, 33% of women and 28% of men were satisfied with the complaint outcome, meaning approximately two thirds of women and men were dissatisfied. Service members who felt satisfied with the outcome of their report indicated that the situation was corrected, the outcome of the report was explained to them, and some action was taken against the offender. Service members who were dissatisfied with the outcome reported that nothing was done about their complaint. Since changes in reporting standards were implemented in 2012, military sexual assault reporting has increased significantly. Since this change, most service members report instances of MST to their direct supervisor, another person in their chain of command, or the offender's supervisor, rather than to a military special office or civilian authority. Individuals who make a report and deny mental health evaluations could be given a dishonorable discharge for making false allegations. Therefore, victims are sent the message to \\"keep quiet and deal with it\\" rather than reporting the assault and possibly losing their career and military benefits. In fact, 23% of women and 15% of men reported that action was taken against them because of their complaint. Additionally, according to an investigation by the Human Rights Watch in 2016, many survivors reported they received more disciplinary notices, were seen as \\"troublemakers\\", assigned undesirable shift assignments, were intimidated by drill sergeants, were threatened by peers with comments such as \\"you got what you deserved\\", and were socially isolated and further assaulted due to fear of more retaliation after an initial report. Psychological/physiological difficulties =General= Service members who experiencing a MST may experience increased emotional and physical distress as well as feelings of shame, hopelessness, and betrayal. Some of the psychological experiences of both male and female survivors include: depression, symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), mood disorders, dissociative reactions, isolation from others, and self-harm. Medical symptoms survivors have experienced include sexual difficulties, chronic pain, weight gain, and gastrointestinal problems.U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs National Center for PTSD. (2015). Military Sexual Trauma. Retrieved from http://www.ptsd.va.gov/public/types/violence/military-sexual-trauma- general.asp =Sexual minorities= According to research, reports of MST have been shown to be higher among veteran populations compared to current active duty personnel and DoD estimates. Specifically within the lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) veteran community, who are significantly more likely to have experienced military sexual assault (MSA) (32.7% of combined female and male veterans) than non-LGB veterans (16.4%). Individuals identifying as a sexual minority are at a greater risk for MSA, than their heterosexual counterparts (32% vs. 16.4%). Suffering from MSA causes psychological effects on veterans, often identified as PTSD, depression, anxiety, and substance abuse. The disparity between heterosexual and non-heterosexual individuals’ exposure to MSA creates a divide in likelihood of psychological effects. LGB veterans reported more likely to have PTSD after leaving the military (41.2% vs. Non- LGB 29.8%). Veterans identifying with a sexual minority have reported to suffer from depression at a higher percentage than their heterosexual counterparts (49.7% vs. 36.0%). After enduring MSA, many victims experience feelings of shame and disgrace, causing individuals of sexual minorities who suffered MSA to project hatred inwards because of the norms placed upon them by the heterosexual society. The military has released LGB people from the branches of service based on their sexual orientation. The military has prohibited, openly LGB individuals from enlisting in the military through the use of,“Don’t Ask, Don’t tell”. According to “American Psychologist”, the creation of a negative sexual stigma regarding homosexuality in the military has caused aggression against sexual minorities. The increased risk of sexual assault that LGB service members are exposed to causes victims to be more likely exposed to the physical post-MSA side effects, which includes weight gain, weight loss, and HIV. Interpersonal difficulties MST is a significant predictor of interpersonal difficulties post-deployment.Mondragon, S.A., Wang, D., Pritchett, L., Graham, D.P., Plasencia, M.L., Teng, E.J. (2015). The influence of military sexual trauma on returning OEF/OIF male veterans. Psychological Services, 12(4), 402-411 Holland and colleagues (2015)Holland, K.J., Rabelo, V.C., & Cortina, L.M. (2015). Collateral damage: Military sexual trauma and help-seeking barriers. Psychology of Violence, 1-9. doi: https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0039467 found that survivors who perceived greater logistical barriers to obtaining mental health care reported more symptoms of depression and PTSD. Particularly for women veterans, PTSD and suicide are major concerns. Males experiencing MST are associated with greater PTSD symptom severity, greater depression symptom severity, higher suicidality, and higher outpatient mental health treatment.Schry, A.R., Hibberd, R., Wagner, H.R., Turchik, J.A., Kimbrel, N.A., Wong, M.,…& Strauss, J.L. (2015). Veterans Affairs Mid-Atlantic Mental Illness Research, Education and Clinical Center Workgroup, & Brancu, M In general, male veterans who report experiencing MST are younger, less likely to be currently married, more likely to be diagnosed with a mood disorder, and more likely to have experienced non-MST sexual abuse either as children or adults than military members who have not been victimized. However, the strongest predictor of any of these negative mental health outcomes, for either gender, includes anticipating public stigma (i.e., worrying about being blamed for the assault).  Treatment services  The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) provides medical and mental health services free of charge to enrolled veterans who report MST and has implemented universal screening for MST among all veterans receiving VA health care.Veterans Health Admin., Dep't Veterans Aff., Top 10 Things All Healthcare & Service Professionals Should Know About VA Services for Survivors of Military Sexual Trauma. The Military Sexual Trauma Movement (MSTM) advocates for legislative and social reforms that would offer greater protections and resources to veterans who have experience MST, such as extending state veterans benefits to veterans who received \\"bad paper\\" discharges as a consequence of reporting MST. The MSTM also allows servicemembers to report sexual harassment and abuse online.  Disability benefits  The Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), a component of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), manages claims and the provision of disability benefits, including tax-free cash compensation, for veterans with service-connected injuries and disorders.Principles relating to service connection, 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (\\"Service connection connotes many factors but basically it means that the facts, shown by evidence, establish that a particular injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred coincident with service in the Armed Forces, or if preexisting such service, was aggravated therein.\\") Veterans who endured military sexual trauma are eligible for VA disability benefits if MST was \\"at least as likely as not\\" the cause of a mental disorder (or aggravated a pre-existing mental disorder).Benefit of the Doubt, 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b), (\\"... When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.\\")Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 54 (1990) (\\"... when a veteran seeks benefits and the evidence is in relative equipoise, the law dictates that the veteran prevails.\\").Veterans Benefits Admin., Dep't Veterans Aff., M21-1 Adjudication Procedures Manual, pt.

A, no. 1, subchap. j., Reasonable Doubt Rule, (\\"The reasonable doubt rule means that the evidence provided by the claimant/beneficiary [or obtained on his/her behalf] must only persuade the decision maker that each factual matter is at least as likely as not....\\"). A special provision in federal regulations lessens the burden of proof for veterans with MST-related posttraumatic stress disorder.Posttraumatic stress disorder, 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f)(5).

Research Yannakakis is known for his contributions to computer science in the areas of computational complexity theory, database theory, computer aided verification and testing, and algorithmic graph theory. Among his contributions to complexity theory are two papers about the PCP theory and about hardness of approximation. In the Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing of 1988, Yannakakis and Christos Papadimitriou introduced the definitions of the complexity classes Max-NP and Max-SNP. Max-NP and Max- SNP (which is a subclass of Max-NP) contain a number of interesting optimization problems, and it was shown by Yannakakis and Papadimitriou that these problems have some bounded error. These findings were able to explain the lack of progress that had been seen in the research community on the approximability of a number of optimization problems, including 3SAT, the Independent Set problem, and the Travelling Salesman Problem.Christos Papadimitriou , Mihalis Yannakakis, Optimization, approximation, and complexity classes, Proceedings of the twentieth annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing, p.229-234, 2–4 May 1988. Yannakakis and Carsten Lund presented a number of findings regarding the hardness of computing approximations at the Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing of 1993. These findings demonstrated the difficulty of efficiently computing approximate solutions to a number of minimization problems such as Graph coloring and Set covering. Given the unlikely scenario that NP-hard problems such as Graph coloring and Set covering would be solved optimally in polynomial time, there had been many attempts to develop efficient approximation solutions for them; the results obtained by Yannakakis and Carsten proved the unlikelihood of achieving this task.Carsten Lund , Mihalis Yannakakis, On the hardness of approximating minimization problems, Proceedings of the twenty-fifth annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing, p.286-293, 16–18 May 1993. In the area of database theory, his contributions include the initiation of the study of acyclic databases and of non-two-phase locking. Acyclic database schemes are schemes that contain a single acyclic join dependency (a join dependency is a relationship governing the joining of tables of the database ) and a collection of functional dependencies;Catriel Beeri , Ronald Fagin , David Maier , Alberto Mendelzon , Jeffrey Ullman , Mihalis Yannakakis, Properties of acyclic database schemes, Proceedings of the thirteenth annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing, p.355-362, 11–13 May 1981. a number of researchers, including Yannakakis, pointed out the usefulness of these schemes by demonstrating the many useful properties they had: for example, the ability to solve many acyclic-scheme based problems in polynomial time, whereas the problem could easily have been NP-complete for other schemes.Catriel Beeri , Ronald Fagin , David Maier , Mihalis Yannakakis, On the Desirability of Acyclic Database Schemes, Journal of the ACM, v.30 n.3, p.479-513, July 1983. With regard to non two-phase locking, Yannakakis demonstrated how knowledge about the structure of a database and the forms of various transactions executed on them could be used to establish whether a particular locking policy is safe or not. The commonly used two phase locking (2PL) policies consist of two stages - for locking and unlocking entities respectively - and to avoid such a policy it is necessary to impose some structure on the entities of a database; Yannakakis’ results show how, by choosing a hypergraph resembling the consistency constraint-structure of a database, a locking policy that visits entities along the paths of this hypergraph will be safe. Such a policy need not be two-phase and these policies can be classified according to the connectivity of the above- mentioned hypergraph, 2PL policies being only one particular instance of these.Mihalis Yannakakis, A Theory of Safe Locking Policies in Database Systems, Journal of the ACM, v.29 n.3, p.718-740, July 1982. Yannakakis went on to show that for the natural class of safe locking policies (L-policies), freedom from deadlocks is determined solely on the order in which entities are accessed by transactions, and from this derived simple conditions that would guarantee freedom from deadlocks for an L-policy.Mihalis Yannakakis, Freedom from deadlocks of safe locking policies, SIAM J. on Computing 11 (1982), 391-408. He has also contributed to the area of computer aided verification and testing, where he laid the rigorous algorithmic and complexity-theoretic foundations of the field. Some of his contributions include the designing of memory efficient algorithms for the verification of temporal properties of finite-state programs,C. Courcoubetis , M. Vardi , P. Wolper , M. Yannakakis, Memory-efficient algorithms for the verification of temporal properties, Formal Methods in System Design, v.1 n.2-3, p.275-288, Oct. 1992. determining the complexity of testing whether programs satisfy their specifications expressed in linear-time temporal logic,Costas Courcoubetis , Mihalis Yannakakis, The complexity of probabilistic verification, Journal of the ACM, v.42 n.4, p.857-907, July 1995. and verifying that a model with timing constraints satisfies a given temporal property.R. Alur , A. Itai , R. P. Kurshan , M. Yannakakis, Timing verification by successive approximation, Information and Computation, v.118 n.1, p.142-157, April 1995. Along with Alex Groce and Doron Peled, he introduced Adaptive Model Checking, showing that when inconsistencies are present between a system and the corresponding model, the results of the verification can be used to improve the model.Groce, A., Peled, D., and Yannakakis, M. 2002.

He has also contributed to research on Message Sequence Charts(MSC), where it was shown that weak realizability is undecidable for bounded MSC- graphs and that safe-realizability is in EXPSPACE, along with other interesting results related to the verification of MSC-graphs.Rajeev Alur , Kousha Etessami , Mihalis Yannakakis, Realizability and verification of MSC graphs, Theoretical Computer Science, v.331 n.1, p.97-114, 15 February 2005.

It is an erect, open shrub with almost circular leaves and scented, pink and white flowers. It usually grows in sand and is found near Eneabba. Description Verticordia argentea is an erect, usually open, spindly shrub which grows to a height of with a single main stem. The leaves are broadly egg-shaped to almost circular, long and have a slightly bluish tinge. The flowers are scented, in spike-like groups each with a short stalk about long. Persistent, pointed bracteoles surround the flower. The floral cup is top-shaped, about long and has 5 ribs. The sepals are pale pink, occasionally cream-coloured, long, with 5 to 7 feather-like lobes with a silvery fringe. The petals are pale pink, rarely creamy-white and have fine lines and scattered spots. They are about long and have deeply divided lobes. The style is about long, straight and bearded in its upper part. Flowering time is from October to March or April. Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described by Alex George in 1991 and the description was published in Nuytsia from specimens collected near Eneabba. The specific epithet (argentea) is derived from the Latin word argentum meaning \\"silver\\" referring to the silvery fringe on the sepals. George placed this species in subgenus Eperephes, section Pennuligera along with V. comosa, V. lepidophylla, V. chrysostachys, V. aereiflora, V. dichroma, V. x eurardyensis, V. muelleriana, V. albida, V. fragrans, V. venusta, V. forrestii, V. serotina, V. oculata, V. etheliana and V. grandis. Distribution and habitat This verticordia grows in white, grey, or yellow sand, usually in association with other verticordias, in shrubland or Eucalyptus todtiana woodland. It is only known from areas south of Eneabba in the Geraldton Sandplains biogeographic region. Ecology The native bee, Dasyhesma argentea has been recorded on this species of verticordia and the insect's name is derived from the plant's name. Conservation Verticordia argentea is classified as \\"Priority Two\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife, meaning that it is poorly known and known from only one or a few locations. Use in horticulture In cultivation, V. argentea is generally a bushier shrub than in the wild. Although difficult to establish, plants are generally hardy in well-drained soils in full sun. It is difficult to propagate from cuttings but relatively easy from seed, although seed is hard to obtain. Attempts at grafting onto other species' rootstock has not been successful.

Life The great-nephew of Sir Thomas More's friend, Dr. John Clement, he was a student at the English College, Douai when in 1578 the college moved to Reims; but was shortly sent to the English College, Rome, where he was admitted 5 September 1579. He was ordained priest in 1585, but remained in Rome till October 1587. He took the degree of Doctor of Theology in Italy, probably in Rome itself. Though originally destined for the English mission, Clement never went to England, but held the major positions of Dean of St. Gudule's, Brussels, and Vicar general of the King of Spain's army in Flanders. He was a generous benefactor to English Catholic exiles, especially the Augustinian Canonesses of Louvain. In 1612 he, with the Rev. Robert Chambers was commissioned from Rome to make a visit to Douai College so as to put an end to the dissatisfaction with the administration there. Clement died in Brussels, on 28 August 1626.

Description Verticordia aurea is a slender, sometimes bushy shrub with a single main stem and which grows to a height of and wide. The leaves are linear in shape, almost circular in cross-section and long, with those low on the branchlets longer than those nearer the flowers. The leaves have a pointed end. The flowers are scented and arranged in a corymb on the ends of the branches, each flower on a stalk long. The floral cup is shaped like half a sphere, long, has 10 ribs and a warty surface. The sepals are golden-yellow in colour, long, with 6 to 9 feather-like lobes. The petals are also golden- yellow, long and almost circular in shape with a serrated edge. The style is about long, straight and glabrous. Flowering time is from September to December. The species is closely allied to Verticordia nitens and V. patens, the three members of Verticordia sect. Chrysorhoe, from which it is most easily distinguished by its larger, more deeply yellow or golden flowers. Taxonomy and naming Verticordia aurea was first formally described by Alex George in 1991 and the description was published in Nuytsia from specimens collected south of Eneabba. The specific epithet (aurea) is derived from the Latin word aurum meaning \\"gold\\" referring to the colour of the flowers. George placed this species in subgenus Chrysoma, section Chrysorhoe along with V. patens and V. nitens. Distribution and habitat This verticordia grows in deep sand, usually in association with other verticordias, in heath, shrubland or woodland with Eucalyptus todtiana, Banksia menziesii and Xylomelum angustifolium. It is known from scattered areas between Eneabba, Lake Indoon and the Green Head - Coorow Road, within of Eneabba in the Geraldton Sandplains biogeographic region. Ecology The flowers are not attractive to typical insect pollinators, except for a single species of solitary bee Euryglossa aureophila (Colletidae), previously Euhesma aureophila, which feeds on nectar, pollen, and the oil released from the anthers. Conservation Verticordia argentea is classified as \\"Priority Four\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife, meaning that is rare or near threatened. Use in horticulture In cultivation V. aurea is a bushy shrub with colourful flowers, making it an attractive garden plant, but it has proven difficult to grow, except in Western Australia in deep sand in an open sunny location.

Family Both Margaret and Mary were daughters of Sir John Shelton and his wife Anne, the sister of Thomas Boleyn, 1st Earl of Wiltshire, the father of King Henry VIII's second Queen consort, Anne Boleyn. Margaret and Mary were thus first cousins of the Queen.; . Margaret was the youngest of Sir John Shelton's daughters. She was an attendant of her cousin, Queen Anne Boleyn, and was present when she made her first appearance as queen on Easter Eve, 12 April 1533.Weir, Henry VIII, p.335 King's mistress One of the Shelton sisters is believed to have been King Henry's mistress for a six-month period beginning in February 1535, according to statements about mistresses made by the Imperial ambassador, Eustace Chapuys, who referred to Mistress Shelton.Kelly Hart, The Mistresses of Henry VIII, The History Press, 2009CSP Spanish, V, pt.2, p.126 According to biographer Antonia Fraser, this was Margaret Shelton..Antonia Fraser The Six Wives of Henry VIII Chapuys was always at court when in England, more frequently so than most contemporaneous writers. Hugh Latimer identified Madge Shelton as the woman attendant on Anne when she miscarried within hours of Queen Katherine of Aragon's death. Madge was the \\"concubine's\\" closest companion in waiting owing to her familial ties, yet would be dismissed at the end.Spanish Calendar of Letters, Despatches and State Papers relating to Negotiations between England and Spain; Weir, p.15 However, more recent research has suggested that it was Margaret's sister Mary who was Henry's mistress, and was rumoured to have been selected to become his fourth wife. Supposedly, the confusion of earlier historians arose from the label \\"Marg Shelton\\", in which the \\"y\\" resembled a \\"g\\", a common confusion in sixteenth-century writing. Other relationships Once arrested, Anne Boleyn was attended by four unsympathetic ladies, who had been instructed by the King's chief minister Thomas Cromwell to report on the Queen's actions. Anne told one of these ladies, Mrs Coffin, that she had reprimanded Francis Weston for flirting with Madge Shelton, who was betrothed to Henry Norris. Anne wondered aloud to Weston why Norris had not married Shelton yet. Weston replied, \\"[Norris] came more to her [Anne's] chamber for her than for Madge.\\" Both Norris, Madge Shelton's betrothed, and her supposed lover Weston, were executed on charge of having been Anne Boleyn's lovers. In fiction Margaret Shelton is the narrator in Jean Bruller (Vercors)' 1985 book Anne Boleyn (originally written in French), in which Anne Boleyn is presented as a far-sighted English patriot, who strove to make England strong and independent by ending its dependence on the Catholic Church and building up its navy. As depicted in the book, Margaret Shelton was Anne Boleyn's closest and most loyal companion throughout her life, shared her vision for England, and lived to impart it to her daughter, the future Queen Elizabeth I. Madge Shelton appears in The Tudors - she is put forward by Anne herself (though it upsets her), in an attempt to control who Henry beds. It fails.

He was later completely vindicated. Life His father, William Tylden, was able to provide a liberal education for his son and Thomas was sent first to a private school in Holborogh, conducted by a Mr. Gill, and in his fifteenth year entered Queen's College, Oxford. The next year found him at St John's College, Cambridge, and in 1640 he was made a Billingsley scholar. He received a B.A. in 1641, but the influence of John Sargeant, with whom he became acquainted during his college course, had induced him to enter the Catholic Church, and in 1642 the two set out for the English College, Lisbon. In due course Godden was ordained, and so distinguished himself by his scholarship and controversial ability that in 1650 we find him lecturing in philosophy in the college. He rapidly ascended the ladder of academic distinction, and after being successively professor of theology, prefect of studies, and vice-president, succeeded Dr. Clayton as president of the college in 1655. Five years later he was thought worthy of the degree of Doctor of Divinity, and had established such a reputation for eloquence and piety that Princess Catherine of Braganza, about to marry Charles II, brought Godden to England with her, as her private chaplain. He was well received in his native country and enjoyed every evidence of royal favour. Popish Plot The disturbances caused by Oates' fabricated Popish plot, however, affected Godden very seriously. The informer and perjurer Miles Prance, (who was by trade a silversmith with close connections to the Court) who had been arrested and imprisoned on suspicion of complicity in the Plot, upon being examined about the murder of Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey, swore that Godden and his servant Lawrence Hill had been concerned in the crime, and that Godfrey's corpse had been concealed for a time in Godden's apartments. Prance could suggest no plausible motive for the crime, merely saying vaguely that Godden had taken the side of two Irish priests, Fr. Kelly and Fr. Fitzgerald, in a quarrel with Godfrey, and that the quarrel for no clear reason led to murder. Why Prance named Godden and Hill as the assassins has never been clear, but he had been seriously ill-treated in prison (he was put in chains, denied a fire and almost frozen to death) and threatened with torture. He was desperate to give the authorities information which might gain him his freedom, and possibly (as was the case with the earlier informers) secure for some financial reward. He may have named the first Catholics who came to his mind, or acted out of personal spite against Godden. Fr. Kelly, of whom nothing is known, may have been a figment of Prance's imagination, although Godden and Hill did know an Irish priest called Fitzgerald, who was employed in the household of the Venetian envoy. Fearing that public indignation against everything Catholic would render an impartial investigation impossible, Godden managed to escape to the Continent, and took refuge in Paris. His lodgings in Somerset House were searched and Hill, despite the testimony of several witnesses (who included Godden's niece, Mary Tylden) who swore he was elsewhere at the time of the murder, and that Godden's apartments were too small to conceal a body anyway, was convicted and executed at Tyburn, 21 Feb., 1679, along with Henry Green and Robert Berry, his supposed co- conspirators. Mrs. Hill, at the trial, courageously accused Prance of perjury-\\"he knows all of this is as false as God is true\\"- and prophesied correctly that he would recant, but only when it was too late. Later years Later evidence, showing that Godden was in no way connected with Godfrey's death, altered public feeling: in 1686, just as Mrs. Hill had prophesied at her husband's trial, Miles Prance admitted that his charges against Hill, Berry, Green, FitzGerald and Godden had been a pure fabrication. In the reign of James II, he returned to his former post as almoner to the Queen Dowager. From this time until his death he took a prominent part in the religious controversies in England, and in 1686, with Bonaventure Giffard, defended the doctrine of the Real Presence, before the king, against Dr. William Jane and Dr. Simon Patrick. He was buried under the royal chapel in Somerset House.

Pen drawing by Wenzel Hollar, 1631. St. Alban's Abbey, Mainz (Stift St. Alban vor Mainz) originated as a Benedictine abbey, founded in 787 or 796 by Archbishop Richulf (787–813) in honour of Saint Alban of Mainz, located to the south of Mainz on the hill later called the Albansberg. It was turned into a collegiate foundation (Herrenstift) in 1442. The buildings were entirely destroyed in 1552, although the foundation retained a legal existence until its formal dissolution in 1802. The abbey was initially renowned for its school, \\"famous for its teaching and its piety\\" (pietate doctrinaque inclinitum) and for its beautiful church. The school was the origin of the Carolingian court school. One of its famous teachers was Rabanus Maurus, born c 780 in Mainz. The importance of the place was reflected in the extraordinary size of the hall. The church was inaugurated on 1 December 805 by Richulf and remained the largest church of Mainz until construction of Mainz Cathedral was begun by Willigis. History The abbey was founded near the basilica of Saint Alban founded in 413 and developed as part of the Carolingian Renaissance. The oldest church on the site was erected during the late Roman period and was a building with a single nave, with an area of exactly 50 by 100 Roman feet. In 805 the Carolingian basilica was consecrated, comprising three naves, but possibly originally without the transept and the two apses. At the western end was a hall the same size as the main nave, above which was a chapel of St. Michael. The two western towers, known from later illustrations, were added in the Romanesque period. The Gothic choir, erected between 1300 and 1500, was extraordinarily large. The floor plan of Schloss Johannisberg, originally built as a monastery, reflects a similar construction, because St. Alban's was its mother house. Seventh and eighth centuries The existence of a monastic community here since the seventh century is proved by gravestones. In 794, even before the completion of the buildings, Fastrada, one of the wives of Charlemagne, was buried here. Charlemagne co-financed the construction. Later the Archbishops of Mainz had their last resting-place here, which was previously, until the time of Saint Boniface, at St. Hilarius's. Archeological excavations during the years 1907 to 1911 indicated that as early as the Roman period and late antiquity a graveyard with a church existed here. It may be assumed that Saint Alban's grave was among the discoveries. During an earthquake in 858 parts of the church were destroyed. Fortification  Mainz with St. Alban's Abbey to the east (on the left side), engraved by Matthäus Merian, 1655. The later Archbishop of Mainz (1328–1336) Baldwin of Luxembourg fortified the abbeys of St. Alban's, St. Jakob's and St. Victor's, which at that period were located outside the town walls. Destruction St. Alban's was sacked and burnt down on the evening of 28 August 1552 during the Second Margrave War by Albert Alcibiades, Margrave of Brandenburg-Kulmbach. It was not rebuilt. A chapel was constructed from the ruins of the church , which was in its turn severely damaged in the Thirty Years' War and completely destroyed during the siege of Mainz in 1793. In 1802 St. Alban's Abbey, which until then had retained a nominal existence, was formally dissolved under Napoleon. Today 130 years after its termination the veneration of Saint Alban was revived by the construction of the new St. Alban's parish church, the first church to be built in the Diocese of Mainz after World War I. Nothing remains of the buildings on the original abbey site in the present Oberstadt of Mainz on the Albansberg, but the modern street Auf dem Albansberg approximately follows the foundations of the church. The precious sacramentary from the abbey's scriptorium is preserved in the collection of valuables in the Martinus- Bibliothek, also in Mainz.

History The airstrip was constructed in 1994 by Rod Anders, known as \\"Ramblin' Rod\\" to Portland TV viewers, for his private airplane alongside his log cabin home. In 2004, Mike and Jennie Applebee purchased the property and airstrip from the estate of Anders. In 2005, the owner announced plans to convert the airstrip into a commercial operation and include services such as flight training. Owner Jim Applebee was issued citations by the county in June 2005 for operations at the airport. Neighbors formed a group to oppose the conversion and hired an attorney. The application failed as incomplete and the citations were dismissed by the court. In 2006, the owners filed again with the county to expand the use of the airport, which was to include commercial use and the basing of ten aircraft with usage to total 3,016 departures each year. A land- use meeting was held in September 2006, with the county denying the application for commercial use at the airport. In 2007, the Applebees appealed the county's decision to the Oregon Land Use Board of Appeals (LUBA), but lost the decision in June. Later LUBA sent part of the case back to the county and the Applebees were allowed to have agricultural operations at the airstrip, but they dropped an appeal to the Oregon Court of Appeals in November 2007 and announced plans to sell the property. In October 2008, the Applebees received initial approval to expand the airport grounds by adding a hangar, parking lot, and helipad.

George placed this species in subgenus Eperephes, section Verticordella along with V. pennigera, V. halophila, V. blepharophylla, V. lindleyi, V. carinata, V. drummondii, V. wonganensis,V. paludosa, V. luteola, V. attenuata, V. tumida, V. mitodes, V. centipeda, V. auriculata, V. pholidophylla, V. spicata and V. hughanii. Distribution and habitat V. bifimbriata grows in sand, often over a substrate of laterite, sometimes in areas near granite that are wet in winter, in heath, shrubland or Eucalyptus woodland. It is found in areas between Mogumber, New Norcia, Bindoon and the Dryandra Woodland, in the Avon Wheatbelt, Jarrah Forest and Swan Coastal Plain biogeographic regions. Conservation Verticordia bifimbriata is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture In cultivation V. bifimbriata is a slender to bushy shrub with delicately perfumed flowers, making it an attractive garden plant. It is usually propagated from seed and the plants have flowered within 18 months of germinating. Sometimes slow to establish at first, they often then grow vigorously. It will grow in well-drained soil in Sydney with its wet summers and is tolerant of light frosts.

Because the timing of the invention of writing per culture and region, the term \\"prehistoric medicine\\" encompasses a wide range of time periods and dates. The study of prehistoric medicine relies heavily on artifacts and human remains, and on anthropology. Previously uncontacted peoples and certain indigenous peoples who live in a traditional way have been the subject of anthropological studies in order to gain insight into both contemporary and ancient practices.  Disease and mortality  Some diseases and ailments were more common in prehistory than they are today; there is evidence that many people suffered from osteoarthritis, probably caused by the lifting of heavy objects which would have been a daily and necessary task in their societies. For example, the transport of latte stones, though this practice only started during the neolithic era which involved hyper extension and torque of the lower back, while dragging the stones, may have contributed to the development of micro fractures in the spine and subsequent spondylolysis. Things such as cuts, bruises, and breakages of bone, without antiseptics, proper facilities, or knowledge of germs, would become very serious if infected, as they did not have sufficient ways to treat infection. There is also evidence of rickets, bone deformity and bone wastage (Osteomalacia), which is caused by a lack of Vitamin D. The life expectancy in prehistoric times was low, 25-40 years, with men living longer than women; archaeological evidence of women and babies found together suggests that many women would have died in childbirth, perhaps accounting for the lower life expectancy in women than men. Another possible explanation for the shorter life spans of prehistoric humans may be malnutrition; also, men as hunters may have sometimes received better food than the woman, who would consequently have been less resistant to disease.  Treatments for disease  = Plant materials = Herbs such as rosemary may have been used for medical purposes by prehistoric people. Plant materials (herbs and substances derived from natural sources) Mentions spices being used by some prehistoric cultures were among the treatments for diseases in prehistoric cultures. Since plant materials quickly rot under most conditions, historians are unlikely to fully understand which species were used in prehistoric medicine. A speculative view can be obtained by researching the climate of the respective society and then checking which species continue to grow in similar conditions today and through anthropological studies of existing indigenous peoples. Unlike the ancient civilisations which could source plant materials internationally, prehistoric societies would have been restricted to localised areas, though nomadic tribes may have had a greater variety of plant materials at their disposal than more stationary societies. The effects of different plant materials could have been found through trial and error. Gathering and dispensing of plant materials was in most cultures handled by women, who cared for the health of their family. Plant materials were an important cure for diseases throughout history. This fund of knowledge would have been passed down orally through the generations. The birch polypore fungus, commonly found in alpine environments, may have been used as a laxative by prehistoric people living in Northern Europe, since it is known to bring on short bouts of diarrhoea when ingested, and was found among the possessions of a mummified man. =The use of earth and clays= Earths and clays may have provided prehistoric peoples with some of their first medicines. This is related to geophagy, which is extremely widespread among animals in the wild as well as among domesticated animals. In particular, geophagy is widespread among contemporary non-human primates. Also, early humans could have learned about the use of various healing clays by observing animal behaviour. Such clay is used both internally and externally, such as for treating wounds, and after surgery (see below). Geophagy, and the external use of clay are both still quite widespread among aboriginal peoples around the world, as well as among pre-industrial populations. = Surgery = Trepanning (sometimes Trephining) was a basic surgical operation carried out in prehistoric societies across the world, A small but informative text although evidence shows a concentration of the practice in Peru. Several theories question the reasoning behind trepanning; it could have been used to cure certain conditions such as headaches and epilepsy. See the section \\"Origin Of Medicine\\". There is evidence discovered of bone tissue surrounding the surgical hole partially grown back, so therefore survival of the procedure did occur at least on occasion. Many prehistoric peoples, where applicable (geographically and technologically), were able to set broken or fractured bones using clay materials. An injured area was covered in clay, which then set hard so that the bone could heal properly without interference. Also, primarily in the Americas, the pincers of certain ant species were used to close up wounds from infection; the ant was held above the wound until it bit, where its head would be removed allowing the pincers to remain and hold closed the wound. = Magic and medicine men = Yup'ik shaman exorcising evil spirits from a sick boy. Medicine men (also witch-doctors, shamans) maintained the health of their tribe by gathering and distributing herbs, performing minor surgical procedures, Stories of Medicine Men in Africa providing medical advice, and supernatural treatments such as charms, spells, and amulets to ward off evil spirits. In Apache society, as would likely have been the case in many others, the medicine men initiate a ceremony over the patient, which is attended by family and friends. It consists of magic formulas, prayers, and drumming. The medicine man then, from patients' recalling of their past and possible offenses against their religion or tribal rules, reveals the nature of the disease and how to treat it. They were believed by the tribe to be able to contact spirits or gods and use their supernatural powers to cure the patient, and, in the process, remove evil spirits. If neither this method nor trepanning worked, the spirit was considered too powerful to be driven out of the person. Medicine men would likely have been central figures in the tribal system, because of their medical knowledge and because they could seemingly contact the gods. Their religious and medical training were, necessarily, passed down orally.  Dentistry  Archaeologists in Mehrgarh in Balochistan province in the present day Pakistan discovered that the people of Indus Valley Civilization from the early Harappan periods (c. 3300 BC) had knowledge of medicine and dentistry. The physical anthropologist who carried out the examinations, Professor Andrea Cucina from the University of Missouri, made the discovery when he was cleaning the teeth from one of the men. Later research in the same area found evidence of teeth having been drilled dating to 7,000 B.C.E.  The problem of evidence  There is no written evidence which can be used for investigation into the prehistoric period of history by definition. Historians must use other sources such as human remains and anthropological studies of societies living under similar conditions. A variety of problems arise when the aforementioned sources are used. Human remains from this period are rare and many have undoubtedly been destroyed by burial rituals or made useless by damage.WP:CIRCULAR Wikipedia's Ötzi the Iceman Article '..three or four of his right ribs had been squashed when he had been lying face down after death, or where the ice had crushed his body.' The most informative archaeological evidence are mummies, remains which have been preserved by either freezing or in peat bogs; no evidence exists to suggest that prehistoric people mummified the dead for religious reasons, as Ancient Egyptians did. These bodies can provide scientists with subjects' (at the time of death): weight, illnesses, height, diet, age, and bone conditions,WP:CIRCULAR Wikipedia's Article on the Mummy Juanita which grant vital indications of how developed prehistoric medicine was. Not technically classed as 'written evidence', prehistoric people left many kinds of paintings, using paints made of minerals such as lime, clay and charcoal, and brushes made from feathers, animal fur, or twigs on the walls caves. Although many of these paintings are thought to have a spiritual or religious purpose, there have been some, such as a man with antlers (thought to be a medicine man), which have revealed some part of prehistoric medicine. Many cave paintings of human hands have shown missing fingers (none have been shown without thumbs), which suggests that these were cut off for sacrificial or practical purposes, as is the case among the Pygmies and Khoikhoi. Pages 318–21 are of particular interest in this subject The writings of certain cultures (such as the Romans) can be used as evidence in discovering how their contemporary prehistoric cultures practiced medicine. People who live a similar nomadic existence today have been used as a source of evidence too, but obviously there are distinct differences in the environments in which nomadic people lived; prehistoric people who once lived in Britain for example, cannot be effectively compared to aboriginal peoples in Australia, because of the geographical differences.

It is an irregularly branched shrub with narrow leaves crowded on side-branches, and cream-coloured or white flowers with pink, cream or white centres. Description Verticordia brachypoda is an irregularly branched shrub with a single stem at the base and which grows to a height of and a width of . Its leaves are mostly crowded on short side branches, long, linear to lance-shaped, almost circular in cross-section and have a blunt end. Leaves near the flowers are slightly wider than those further down the branches. The flowers are scented and arranged in rounded groups near the ends of the branches, each flower on a stalk long. The floral cup is shaped like half a sphere, long, and has 10 ribs, is more or less smooth but hairy near the top. The sepals are white, cream or pale pink, long, and have 2 to 4 lobes with long, thread-like edges. The petals are broadly egg-shaped, pink, cream-coloured or white, long, with a fringe of long, thread-like hairs. The style is long and covered with hairs over most of its length. Flowering time is from October to December. Taxonomy and naming Verticordia brachypoda was first formally described by Nikolai Turczaninow in 1847. The description was published in Bulletin de la Société impériale des naturalistes de Moscou from specimens collected by James Drummond. In 1904, Ludwig Diels described Verticordia stylotricha but that is now described as a taxonomic synonym.

Fifteen years later it was making 45,000 bicycles, 1,500 motorcycles and 1,000 cars a year. In 1935 Bianchi sponsored Costante Girardengo, one of the first Italian stars on the road, and its bicycle sales rose to 70,000 a year.L'Equipe, France, 26 July 2003 In 1950 Fausto Coppi won the Paris–Roubaix on a Bianchi equipped with what was later named the Campagnolo Paris–Roubaix derailleur gear, for which Bianchi bicycles featured the necessary special drop-outs until 1954. He won the race by two and a half minutes on a bicycle equipped with Universal brakes, Bianchi steel handlebars and stem, a Regina chain and a four-speed freewheel with shaped teeth. It also had Nisi rims, Campagnolo hubs and Pirelli tyres. It was made for sale only in 57 and 59 cm, smaller than the bike that Coppi used. A variation known as the Campione Del Mondo followed Coppi's win in the 1953 world championship. Riders of different eras have been associated with Bianchi including Felice Gimondi, who continues his association with the company. Recent riders include Danilo Di Luca, Mario Cipollini, Gianni Bugno, Laurent Fignon, Marco Pantani, Moreno Argentin and Jan Ullrich. Until 2007, Bianchi was a cosponsor of the UCI ProTour team, .

In 2015, the latter became and Bianchi's only UCI Pro Continental sponsored road team. The most demanding rider may have been Pantani. Sara Mercante, head of Bianchi's research and development, said: \\"Pantani had very specific ideas about what he wanted. He had 30 different frames a year from us—with different angles and weights on each one. He changed his bike after every ride. I'd go and meet him during the Giro d'Italia and the Tour and discuss improvements with him. He'd ask to have the geometry changed by, say, half a degree, just to make sure the bike was absolutely perfect. He'd want different angles for different races. He's ask us to tweak the length of the top tube by a millimetre or by half a degree. Pantani was quite obsessive.\\"Framemakers' guide, Procycling, UK, undated cutting Bianchi is currently headed up by CEO Bob Ippolito, who before joining Bianchi was the Executive Vice President and General Manager of Pacific Cycle, headquartered in Madison, Wisconsin. Colour Bianchi bicycles are traditionally painted Celeste, a turquoise also known as Bianchi Green, (and sometimes, incorrectly Tiffany Blue, a trademarked colour). Contradictory myths say Celeste is the colour of the Milan sky, the eye colour of a former queen of Italy for whom Edoardo Bianchi made a bicycle (the crowned eagle of the company logo is an adaptation of the former royal crest) and that it was a mixture of surplus military paint. The shade has changed over the years, sometimes more blue, then more green.

It was that that brought the end of production shortly after peace returned because the factory had been so heavily bombed. Bianchi continued with motorcycles, particularly the 125cc Bianchina and the Aquilotto, an auxiliary motor for a conventional bicycles. Bianchi took on Lino Tonti as its research engineer in 1959. It produced 250, 350 and 500cc machines and took part in grands prix in 1960. The company also produced a model for the Italian army and a civilian scooter, the Orsetto 80. Piaggio bought out Bianchi Motorcycles in 1967. In 1955, Bianchi created a car brand, Autobianchi, in collaboration with Pirelli and Fiat. The three turned out only a handful of models, almost exclusively small cars, the biggest being the short-lived Autobianchi A111. Traditionally, Autobianchi motor vehicles cost more than equivalent Fiat models. Fiat used Autobianchi to test new production concepts such as glass fibre and front-wheel drive. Eventually, Fiat bought out Autobianchi and integrated it with Lancia. Autobianchi are no longer in production beginning from 1995 when, everywhere except Italy, its Y10 hatchback was rebranded a Lancia.

She has been listed as one of the winners of the Fellowship of Reconciliation peace awards, where she was called \\"outspoken peace activist\\" and the \\"first young woman of Middle Eastern descent\\" to engage in advocacy relating to illicit trade of small arms and light weapons, gender-based violence, chemical and biological disarmament, conventional disarmament and international security. In 2013, Akreyi was awarded the \\"Special Prize for bridging the gap between civilisations\\" by the National Organisation for Future Generations for making valuable contributions to humanity through the creation of a culture of coexistence. When she received the International Pfeffer Peace Award in 2014, she dedicated it to the residents of Kobane and Sinjar and the persecuted Christians in the Middle East. In 2017, she was presented with the Davenport mayor medal and the Pacem in Terris Award for \\"her selfless commitment to human rights for all.\\" Biography Akreyi was born into a secular family in Kurdistan region, Iraq. In her early and her teenage years, she resisted every effort made by members of the Baath Party to induce her to gain her trust and become a member, which caused her to be blacklisted for a period of time. In 1986, she moved to Erbil where she studied civil engineering with a focus on designing roads and bridges at the Salahaddin University. In 1988 she was secretly involved in documenting torture and other violations of human rights throughout Iraq. The following year, she became politically involved in various struggles for human rights, peace, social justice, democratic governance and ethnic reconciliation. Her advocacy of anti-authoritarianism and her criticism of the use of excessive force against civilians were not without risk and threat to her life and the lives of her family members. Her involvement in these issues became more intense after the Al-Anfal Campaign, also known as the Kurdish Genocide. Despite difficult times, she managed to complete her B.Sc. in 1990. After the first Gulf War, when the Iraqi regime regained control of the Kurdistan region through an offensive in spring 1991, she was forced to leave her country. In the diaspora, Akreyi earned a master's degree in genetics and genomics and a PhD degree in global health and cancer epidemiology. She has served as a clinical geneticist, researching inherited diseases. Dr Akreyi is the co-founder of Defend International, an NGO whose mission is \\"to respond to grave violations of human rights and of International Humanitarian Law, monitor the implementation of preventive measures that are designed to end impunity for the perpetrators of these crimes, conduct medical research that may either directly or indirectly improve the health standard of communities, and to promote peace and democracy through cultural relations and diplomacy.\\" Dedication to human rights Akreyi's passion for human rights started many years ago when she advocated for her classmates at her school. As she grew up, she helped to establish a secret working group against torture in Iraq, dedicated to collecting evidence of torture and other human rights abuses. In 1987, she was secretly interviewing the victims and their families. She raised awareness about the impacts of torture and other violations of human rights on civilians. In 1990, she was engaged in advocating for gender equality and women’s empowerment in the Middle East and North Africa region. She then co- founded a regional Women’s Working Group and organised programs to enhance women’s participation in peace-building and post-conflict reconstruction. =Continuing Activism= In the diaspora, Akreyi launched campaigns, wrote articles and spoke in panel discussions on human rights, international conventions and peace. In 2005, she was elected, among Arabic-speaking bloggers from around the world, as the MENA region’s most prominent blogger. She was awarded the prestigious title of \\"Queen Blogger\\" for two years until she resigned. Her first involvement with Amnesty International was in 1994, when she started to do volunteer work. In March 2006, the International Secretariat of Amnesty International thanked her for her efforts in support of Amnesty’s campaigns, especially her effective use of the internet as a tool for human rights education and mobilisation. In February 2006, she was appointed as \\"Stop Torture\\" ambassador for Amnesty International. She was elected in the executive committee of Amnesty International in April 2006. In June 2006, Akreyi co-chaired the first regional conference on control arms held in Cairo and was part of a delegation of high-profile activists who met with policy-makers at the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Egyptian Parliament. In June 2007, she quit Amnesty International and co- founded Defend International. Same year, she was elected as a co-chair of the Women’s Working Group on MENA Region. It is observed that Akreyi has created partner agreements with leading NGOs like the International Action Network on Small Arms, Cluster Munition Coalition and the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves. She has launched campaigns to defend the rights of writers, civil society activists, children (child/forced marriages), girls, women's rights defenders, students, professors, prisoners on death row and prisoners on hunger strikes. She has over 20 years of experiences in the areas of human rights, gender equality, women's empowerment, grassroots organising, intercultural communication, strategic planning, international security, peace and international conventions. =Pfeffer Peace Prize= Dr. Widad Akreyi received the 2014 International Pfeffer Peace Award in October 2014 Dr. Akreyi has been awarded the 2014 International Pfeffer Peace Award for \\"creating momentum in favor of a UN resolution on a strong and an effective Arms Trade Treaty to prevent the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons that might be used for acts of genocide, crimes against humanity, or terrorism,\\" as well as for lobbying for the \\"UN Declaration of Commitment to End Sexual Violence in Conflict and the UN Resolution 2117 dedicated to halting illicit transfer, destabilizing accumulation, and misuse of small arms and light weapons\\" around the world. Following the announcement by the US Fellowship of Reconciliation on 18 September 2014, the award was presented to her on 13 October 2014 by Rev. Lucas Johnson, International Coordinator for the International Fellowship of Reconciliation. Dr. Akreyi dedicated the award to the 50 million refugees who have been displaced as a direct result of conflict, persecution or the irresponsible transfer of conventional arms, and particularly mentioned the Yazidis, Christians, and all residents of Kobanê region. =Pacem in Terris Pace and Freedom Award= Widad received the Pacem in Terris Award in 2017 for committing her life's mission to peace and justice, advocating \\"for human dignity for all in the Middle East,\\" alleviating \\"suffering and promoting peace and equal rights and opportunities for all,\\" and for documenting crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing, torture and other human rights violations, as well as for her \\"pursuit of justice through medical research and the monitoring of peace initiatives.\\" The Quad-City Times stated that she \\"earned her place among the world’s brightest brokers of peace.\\" The 47th Pacem in Terris (Peace on Earth) Peace and Freedom Award was presented to Dr. Akreyi on 22 October 2017 by Bishop Thomas Zinkula of the Diocese of Davenport during a ceremony in Christ the King Chapel on the St. Ambrose University. Following her acceptance of the award she gave a speech about what she has witnessed, \\"moving some in the audience to tears.\\" She cautioned the audience that easy solutions to the crises around the globe are not possible and said that \\"We must remember compassion is contagious. The more we spread it the more people will cherish it and share it.\\" The mayor of Davenport, Iowa has presented Dr. Akreyi with the Davenport medal. Humanitarian initiatives and peace and security efforts = Arms Trade Treaty = In 2005, Akreyi began advocating for a UN resolution on a strong and an effective Arms Trade Treaty to prevent the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons that might be used for acts of genocide, crimes against humanity, or terrorism. The Clarion Project has pointed out that she has helped pioneer the global arms-control treaty, and that in 2008 Dr. Akreyi was \\"hand-picked to be part of the prestigious UN Group of Governmental Experts to examine the feasibility, scope and draft parameters of an Arms Trade Treaty.\\" = Prohibition Against Torture = In 2005, she joined a campaign to require a prohibition against torture in the Danish Criminal Code. She has served as ambassador of Amnesty International’s \\"Stop Torture\\" campaign. = Created Bridges to Arabic Speaking Audiences = Since 2005 she has been engaged in online discussions, blogging and other interactive techniques through which she was able to create online bridges to Arabic speaking audiences by becoming part of online dialogue and debate. In 2006, the International Secretariat of Amnesty International praised her activities in support of Amnesty’s campaigns, noting that her involvement boosted Amnesty's \\"chances of success.\\" In 2008, Akreyi joined an international campaign against Eid aerial firing. = Gender-based Violence = In March 2008, she joined the international campaign to end gender-based violence at gunpoint. In a press release published in February 2013, Akreyi called on UN negotiators of the Arms Trade Treaty to include a legally-binding provision to prevent armed gender-based violence, noting the importance of maintaining the \\"momentum created over the last seven years\\" in favor of a strong and an effective Arms Trade Treaty. \\"We aim to provide new directions to assist in developing policy measures that counter the harmful impacts that illicit trade in small arms and light weapons have on vulnerable populations, especially on women and children\\" said Akreyi. In December 2014, Dr Akreyi joined the Everywoman Everywhere Coalition at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government’s Carr Center for Human Rights Policy. This \\"highly diverse coalition is driven by survivors and practitioners, with more than 50 active working group members from more than 44 countries including every continent and major geographic area\\" and has \\"come together with a singular goal: Mobilization and execution of a global, grassroots-up campaign for a universal legal tool, such as a UN Convention or Additional Protocol, that empowers every woman and girl access to legal remedy should her rights to personal security be violated.\\" In her statement released by the EEC, she had pointed out that \\"violence against females is a worldwide pandemic that devastates victims, threatens families, intensifies inequality, weakens societies and undermines global efforts to combat poverty through sustainable development,\\" and she was listed as a policy advisor. = Peace Initiatives = In June 2010, she addressed the UN Fourth Biennial Meeting of States, in New York to consider the implementation of the Programme of Action to prevent, combat, and eradicate the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects. She shared her views on the importance of investing in a \\"Culture of Peace,\\" expressing her concerns about the proliferation of illicit trade in SALW around the world, which has significantly \\"intensified armed conflicts and made the proliferation of peace difficult\\" to achieve. In a press release published in March 2013, she welcomed the Kurdish leader's call for cease- fire; she urged the Turkish authorities not to waste a historic opportunity and called on Scandinavian countries to take the lead in negotiating a peace deal in Turkey. In a statement released two days after the 2015 Ankara bombings, she asked President Barack Obama to urge the Turkish Prime Minister to show respect for the victims of the peace rally and declare a ceasefire with the Kurdistan Workers' Party, which had already declared a unilateral ceasefire. She also asked Federica Mogherini to help end the armed violence between Turkey and the Kurds. When the Syrian crisis first erupted, she decided to advocate for a peaceful solution to the conflict. In an interview conducted in October 2013, she emphasised the massive human cost of the prevailing crisis in Syria and underlined that the conflict has radically influenced regional security and the proliferation of small arms and light weapons, making any global attempt to regulate the illicit trade in conventional weapons out of reach. She characterised the crisis as a \\"humanitarian tragedy of historic proportions,\\" before urging the international community to do whatever possible to bring the crisis to an end in a peaceful and diplomatic manner. = Global Refugee Crisis = On the occasion of the World Refugee Day 2013, she underscored the significant contributions of resettled refugees to their new communities while expressing concern about the safety and well-being of all displaced populations. \\"Their challenges are many, but common for all refugees, asylum seekers, and internally displaced persons is that they have either limited or no control over their own lives... Although the world is possibly facing the worst economic crisis in its history, we must not forget the plight of refugees around the world. The international community has a responsibility to protect the rights of vulnerable asylum seekers, refugees, and returnees. We call on Member States, humanitarian agencies, and other stakeholders involved in refugee protection to ensure high standards of protection for displaced persons in neighboring countries,\\" said Akreyi. Dr. Widad Akreyi during a beach event held by Defend International in September 2015 to remember the victims of the global refugee crisis On 4 September 2015, Dr. Akreyi organized moments of silence or prayer to honor the victims of the global refugee crisis unfolding on the shores of Europe and elsewhere. People worldwide paid tribute in memory of Alan Kurdi, his brother, his mother, their loved-ones, thousands of children who had lost their lives fleeing armed conflicts and over 2,500 refugees who had died in summer 2015 attempting to cross the Mediterranean to Europe. During a beach memorial, Dr. Akreyi expressed condolences to the families and friends of victims and called on the international community to share equitably the responsibility for protecting, assisting and hosting refugees in accordance with principles of international solidarity and human rights. She thanked volunteers and humanitarian workers for their efforts in aiding refugees. = Toxic Remnants of War = In July 2014, Dr Akreyi joined a global civil society initiative launched by Toxic Remnants of War Project to help strengthen protection for the environment and those who depend on it during and after conflict. In the preface she wrote for the publication \\"Pollution Politics: power, accountability and toxic remnants of war\\" she pointed out that toxic remnants of war may likely be \\"associated with the risk of birth defects, the risk of developing certain forms of cancer, or may adversely affect the neurological development of children and the reproductive processes of humans and animals. They may also impair the function of the respiratory and immune systems, thereby compromising the ability to respond to pathogens and other harmful organisms.\\" = Defending Victims of ISIL = In September 2014, Dr Akreyi launched a worldwide campaign entitled \\"Save The Yazidis: The World Has To Act Now\\" to raise awareness about the tragedy of the Yazidis in Northern Iraq and the humanitarian emergency that continued to unfold. \\"The plight of the Yazidis is a humanitarian tragedy, and we want to make sure that the victims are not forgotten, protected legally, fully assisted and compensated fairly,\\" said Akreyi. She paid tribute to all countries that had supported any minorities during the Iraqi crisis and reiterated her call for the International community to urgently intervene. Dr. Akreyi was quoted in the 2015 Annual Report of The US Commission on International Religious Freedom about the persecution of religious communities in Iraq, Syria and the surrounding region. In October 2014, she dedicated her International Pfeffer Peace Award to the Yazidis, Christians and all residents of Kobane because, she said, facts on the ground demonstrate that these peaceful people are not safe in their enclaves, partly because of their ethnic origin and/or religion and they are therefore in urgent need for immediate attention from the global community. On 4 November 2014, Dr. Akreyi said that \\"the international community should define what’s happening to the Yezidis as a crime against humanity, crime against cultural heritage of the region and ethnic cleansing,\\" adding that Yazidi females are being \\"subjected to as systematic gender-based violence and the use of slavery and rape as a weapon of war.\\" When the horrifying \\"price list\\" for Yazidi and Christian females was issued by ISIS on 3 August 2015, Dr. Akreyi and her team were the first to verify the document's authenticity and publish a translation. The document was later confirmed to be genuine by UN official Zainab Bangura. = Executions = In 2014, she joined an international campaign launched by Child Rights International Network to end all executions of juvenile offenders and to protect the rights of child domestic workers. = Human Trafficking = In 2008, she joined the project \\"Stop Trafficking Worldwide\\", a campaign to stop human trafficking worldwide.

It is a small shrub with shortly cylindrical leaves and bright yellow flowers which turn red as they age. There are two subspecies, both of which have limited distributions and a priority conservation rating. Description Verticordia brevifolia is a shrub which grows to a height of and which usually has more than one main stem at its base. Its leaves are linear in shape, circular in cross-section, long, mostly crowded on short upper branches and have a short, sometimes hooked point on their end. The flowers are usually scented and arranged in rounded groups near the ends of the branches, each flower on an erect stalk long. The floral cup is shaped like half a sphere, about long and has a slightly warty surface. The sepals are bright yellow fading to red, long, with 6 or 7 feathery lobes. The petals are also bright yellow, , with long, spreading, finger-like projections. The style is straight, long, and glabrous. Flowering time is from September to November. Taxonomy and naming Verticordia brevifolia was first formally described by Alex George in 1991 and the description was published in Nuytsia from specimens collected near Nyabing by Alex and Elizabeth George. The specific epithet (brevifolia) is derived from the Latin words brevis meaning \\"short\\" and folium meaning \\"leaf\\". There are two subspecies: *Verticordia brevifolia A.S.George subsp. brevifolia which has sepals and petals long and occurs in the Nyabing area; *Verticordia brevifolia subsp. stirlingensis A.S.George which has sepals and petals long and is only found in the Stirling Range area. George placed this species in subgenus Chrysoma, section Jugata along with V. chrysanthella, V. chrysantha, V. galeata, V. coronata, V. amphigia and V. laciniata. Distribution and habitat All the known populations of subspecies brevifolia occur in gravelly clay on roadsides between Nyabing, Dumbleyung and Ongerup in the Avon Wheatbelt, Jarrah Forest and Mallee biogeographic regions. Subspecies stirlingensis is mostly only found in the Stirling Range National Park in the Esperance Plains and Mallee biogeographic regions where it grows in gravel, sand or loam in heath, shrubland or woodland. Conservation Subspecies brevifolia is classified as \\"Priority Three\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife because all the known populations occur on roadsides. Subspecies stirlingensis is classified as Priority Two because there are only a few known populations of this plant. Use in horticulture Subspecies brevifolia has proven to be easier to propagate and grow than stirlingensis and has been cultivated for more than eight years where it is a small shrub with brightly coloured flowers. Propagation from cuttings is usual, and the plants are tolerant of light frosts.

In 2011, Mæland was appointed director of the National Police Directorate, a position he retained until August 2012 when he resigned in the wake of the Gjørv Report. He has since 2014 been director of Akershus University Hospital.  Early life and education  Mæland was born in Rjukan in Telemark county in 1960 to parents Einar and Bjørg Mæland, but grew up in the neighborhood of Hoff in the borough of Ullern in Oslo. His father was a plant foreman at Ringnes brewery, his mother attended to the office of the Norwegian Union of Municipal Employees. Both of his parents were active in the Workers' Youth League and Mæland states that \\"political debate around the dinner-table\\" became part of his upbringing. He attended medical school at the University of Oslo and took the cand.med. degree in 1986.  Career  = Early career = After completing his mandatory residency, he was between 1989 and 1990 employed as the prison doctor at Ullersmo Prison. He worked as a physician from 1989 to 1994 and 1997 to 2000, and was chief physician at Aker University Hospital before becoming head of the psychiatric division at Ullevål University Hospital between 2004 and 2009. = Political career = Mæland led the Oslo chapter of the Workers' Youth League from 1979 to 1982, and was a central board member from 1983 to 1989. During this period he met and made friends with a number of youth politicians, among them were future prime minister Jens Stoltenberg, future bankier and CEO of Norway's largest bank Rune Bjerke, as well as future ministers Hanne Harlem, Turid Birkeland and Espen Barth Eide. He was a member of Oslo city council from 1983 to 1986. During Brundtland's Second Cabinet, he was a personal secretary both in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (1988–89) and the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy (1988). In 1994, during the Brundtland's Third Cabinet, Mælend was a State Secretary in the Ministry of Justice. He held the position for the remainder of Brundtland's tenure, and then a year into Jagland's Cabinet under two different Ministers of Justice Anne Holt and Gerd-Liv Valla. In 2000, when another Labour cabinet Stoltenberg 1 took over, Mæland was again appointed State Secretary in the Ministry of Justice. He held that position until after the 2001 elections, which caused the cabinet to fall. He was also a member of the Norwegian Criminal Cases Review Commission. = Director of National Police and resignation = In 2011, Mæland was one of two applicants to the position as director of the National Police Directorate replacing outgoing Ingelin Killengreen. The other applicant was Christine Fossen, then Chief of Police in the Southern Buskerud Police District. In the end, Mæland was selected. He was appointed on 27 May 2011, mere weeks before the 2011 Norway attacks. During most of the period following the attacks, Mæland was away on paternity leave On 13 August 2012 the Gjørv Report was released. It found that the authorities in general, and the police in particular, failed massively in protecting the public during the 2011 Norway attacks.http://www.dagbladet.no/2012/08/16/nyheter/innenriks/politiet/terror/22_juli_kommisjonen/22989726/ \\"Politidirektør Øystein Mæland og landets 27 politimestre aksepterer 22. juli- kommisjonens flengende kritikk.\\" In the aftermath, Mæland stated that he fully accepted the criticism of the commission's findings and intended to remain in his post, there were calls for his immediate resignation which were repeatedly rejected. The same evening the report was released, Mæland himself appeared on television saying he would not resign. Three days later on 16 August 2012, Minister of Justice Grete Faremo, which was Mæland's immediate superior, announced during a live television debate that she would henceforth recuse herself from all matters relating to him, as to avoid a conflict of interest. This was allegedly due to the close professional relationship the two had when Mæland was state secretary for Faremo during the 90's. This was interpreted by the media as a sign that the minister lacked confidence in Mæland, and that it was a step in the process of removing him from the post altogether. One scholar described it as a \\"humiliation\\" and a \\"sacking\\". 25 minutes after the ministers announcement, Mæland publicly informed the Minister of his immediate resignation. = Later career = He became assisting director of the Norwegian Directorate for Health, then in 2014 director of the Akershus University Hospital. Personal life Mæland is openly gay, and is married to psychotherapist and relationship counsellor Rolf Nicolay Aspestrand. The couple have two children, both of which were born through surrogacy in the United States and subsequently adopted. Mæland and his family currently resides in the borough of Nordberg in Oslo.

It is an erect, spindly shrub with small, well-spaced leaves and pink and red flowers. It is a rarely seen plant, not known between its description in 1849 and its rediscovery in 1990. Description Verticordia carinata is a slender, spindly shrub which grows to a height of and has a single, branching stem at its base. The leaves are well spaced along the branches, elliptic to oblong in shape, dished, long and have fine, short hairs on their edges. The flowers are scented, arranged in a double-sided spike with one flower per leaf axil, held horizontally on a stalk long. The flowers open gradually from the bottom of the spike and superficially resemble pea flowers. The floral cup is top-shaped, long and glabrous. The sepals are magenta to pink, fading as they age, long, with 5 or 6 feathery lobes. The petals are the same colour as the sepals, egg-shaped and . The style is long, extending beyond the petals, curved with hairs near the tip. Flowering time is mainly from late November to May but flowers are often present at other times. Taxonomy and naming Verticordia carinata was first formally described by Nikolai Turczaninow in 1849. The description was published in Bulletin de la Société impériale des naturalistes de Moscou from specimens collected by James Drummond. The specific epithet (carinata) is derived from the Latin word carinatus meaning \\"keeled\\" possibly referring to the lower two petals which, before the flower opens, resemble the keel of a pea flower. When Alex George reviewed the genus Verticordia in 1991, he placed this species in subgenus Eperephes, section Verticordella along with V. pennigera, V. halophila, V. bifimbriata, V. lindleyi, V. blepharophylla, V. drummondii, V. wonganensis,V. paludosa, V. luteola, V. attenuata, V. tumida, V. mitodes, V. centipeda, V. auriculata, V. pholidophylla, V. spicata and V. hughanii. Distribution and habitat This verticordia grows in sandy loam over sandstone in tall shrubland and woodland in the Stirling Range. It is not known where Drummond made the collection of the type specimen and the species was not seen again until rediscovered by a park ranger in 1990 in the Stirling Range National Park. It is only known from three populations - two in the national park and one near Trigwell in the Shire of West Arthur in the Esperance Plains and Jarrah Forest biogeographic regions. Conservation Verticordia acerosa is classified as \\"Threatened Flora (Declared Rare Flora — Extant)\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife and it has also been listed as \\"Vulnerable\\" (VU) under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act). The total number of plants has been estimated to be 260, with the main threat being grazing by kangaroos. Use in horticulture Verticordia carinata has shown horticultural potential, having been grown in Kings Park in Perth and the Australian National Botanic Gardens in Canberra where it has shown tolerance to frost and drought. It has usually been propagated from cuttings but tissue culture has also been successful. The use of smoke water has been shown to improve the rate of germination of seeds of V. carinata.

He was one of the outstanding specialist sprinters of the twentieth century and one of the best horses trained in the North of England. After winning four times as a two-year-old in 1954 he was the dominant European sprinter of 1955 when he was undefeated in eight races including the King's Stand Stakes, July Cup and Diadem Stakes. He was retired to stud in the United States where he had modest success as a sire of winners. Background Pappa Fourway was a powerfully built bay horse standing 16 hands high bred in County Tipperary, Ireland by the Ballykisteen Stud. He was sired by Pappageno, a stallion best known as a sire of stayers and National Hunt horses including the Scottish Grand National winner Pappageno's Cottage. His dam was a mare named Oola Hills, who was the ancestor of Park Top, Lyric Fantasy and Royal Applause. As a yearling, Pappa Fourway was sent to the sales, where he was purchased for 150 guineas and entered into the ownership of Mrs Elaine Goldson. The colt went into training at William Parker \\"Bill\\" Dutton's Grove Cottage stable at Malton, North Yorkshire. Dutton (1901-1958) had been a successful amateur jockey, winning the 1928 Grand National on Tipperary Tim before training major winners in both flat and jump racing. He trained another outstanding sprinter in Right Boy and won the Cheltenham Gold Cup with Limber Hill. Racing career =1954:two-year-old career= Pappa Fourway won four times from seven starts as a two-year-old. He won the Moulton Stakes, finished second in the Lavant Stakes at Goodwood, and was third in the Malton Stakes. =1955:three-year-old career= Pappa Fourway began his 1955 by running in handicap races. He made his first appearance as a three-year-old in the Prince of Wales's Handicap at Chester on 3 May. Carrying a weight of 132 pounds he won by three lengths from thirteen opponents. Three weeks later, he was assigned a weight of 133 pounds in the Stewards' Stakes at Epsom and won by six lengths in a time of 55.4 seconds. On 31 May, Pappa Fourway won the Festival Stakes at Birmingham Racecourse by three lengths. On 24 June, he carried a weight of 133 pounds in the Gosforth Park Cup at Newcastle Racecourse and won by three lengths from ten opponents. Five days later, Pappa Fourway was moved into top level weight-for-age competition in the July Cup at Newmarket. Such was the impression he had made in handicap races that only two horses appeared to oppose him and he won \\"easily\\" by two lengths from the 1954 winner Vilmoray and Royal Palm. In July, Pappa Fourway contested the King's Stand Stakes at Ascot and won by two lengths from Democratic, to whom he conceded fourteen pounds in weight. Pappa Fourway contracted a respiratory infection which affected many Yorkshire-trained horses in the summer of 1955, forcing him to miss the Nunthorpe Stakes which was won in his absence by Royal Palm. In autumn, Pappa Fourway returned to Ascot for the Diadem Stakes on 8 October. Only Trouville, the French-trained winner of the Cork and Orrery Stakes, opposed him and was beaten by six lengths. On his final racecourse appearance, Pappa Fourway won the Tetrarch Stakes at Manchester by two lengths. He had won 12 races worth £9,889 when he was exported to the United States in 1956. Assessment Timeform awarded Pappa Fourway a rating of 139, the highest for any horse in 1955. The rating places Pappa Fourway as one of the best twenty horses of the last sixty years. A rating of 130 is considered the mark of an above average European Group One winner. In their book A Century of Champions, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Pappa Fourway the third best British sprinter and the thirty-ninth best British racehorse of the 20th Century. Stud career Pappa Fourway stood as a stallion in America with limited success, siring twenty stakes winners including Pappas All (Arlington-Washington Futurity Stakes, Hollywood Juvenile Championship Stakes) and Dancing Pappa (runner-up in the Strub Stakes).

It is a sprawling shrub with crowded, cylinder-shaped leaves with small, yellow flowers that are almost hidden by the leaves but with a style which extends well beyond the petals. The plant looks superficially like a miniature pine tree. Description Verticordia crebra is a sprawling, open-branched shrub with a single main stem and which grows to a height of about and a width of . Its leaves are crowded over the entire plant, linear in shape and round in cross-section, long with a stalk long, giving the plant the appearance of a small pine tree. The flowers are scattered, appearing in a few upper leaf axils on erect or spreading stalks long, and apart from the styles are almost hidden by the foliage. The floral cup is shaped like half a sphere, about long, smooth and densely hairy. The sepals are pale yellow, long with 6 to 8 feathery lobes. The petals are roughly circular in shape, pale yellow, about long with irregularly toothed margins. The style is long, gently curved, hairy and extends well beyond the flower and the foliage. Flowering time is from May to October. Taxonomy and naming Verticordia crebra was first formally described by Alex George in 1991 from specimens collected in the Fitzgerald River National Park and the description was published in Nuytsia. The specific epithet (crebra) is derived from the Latin word creber meaning \\"close\\", \\"pressed together\\" or \\"frequent\\", referring to the crowded leaves. George placed this species in subgenus Verticordia, section Verticordia along with V. helichrysantha, V. plumosa, V. stenopetala, V. sieberi, V. harveyi, V. pityrhops, and V. fimbrilepis. Distribution and habitat This verticordia grows on rocky spongolite and in pockets of soil on laterite in low, open heath. It is only known from small areas in the Fitzgerald River National Park in the Esperance Plains and Mallee biogeographic regions. Conservation Verticordia crebra is classified as \\"Threatened Flora (Declared Rare Flora — Extant)\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife and has been listed as \\"Vulnerable\\" (VU) under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act). The population size was estimated to be 7,000 mature plants in 4 populations in 2011. The main threat to the species is too-frequent fires. Use in horticulture While probably not an attractive garden plant, research is being done to determine the best methods of propagation and cultivation so that the species may be conserved in the event of loss of wild populations.

Day, a former Olympic equestrian show jumping Gold medallist. Racing career Based at Woodbine Racetrack in Toronto, at age two the colt made eight starts, winning three including the Kingarvie Stakes. His main rival, Regal Classic, would be voted Canadian Champion 2-Yr-Old-Colt. In 1988, Regal Intention was the dominant three-year- old horse in Canada. He won seven of his twelve starts, capturing the British Columbia Derby at Hastings Racecourse in Vancouver and important stakes races at Woodbine Racetrack in Toronto including a win over Regal Classic in Canada's most prestigious race, the Queen's Plate. In the Prince of Wales Stakes at Fort Erie Racetrack, the two colts ran one-two again but this time Regal Classic came out on top by a nose. Nonetheless, Regal Intention's 1988 performances earned him Canadian Champion 3-year-old Colt honors. Sent back to the track to compete at age four, Windfields Farm acquired an interest in Regal Intention. He raced thirteen times in 1989, frequently running in sprint races. He won three races, including the Nearctic Stakes at Woodbine, but in the Breeders' Cup Sprint at Gulfstream Park the colt Sam Who was disqualified to last after he angled in causing considerable difficulty for several horses that forced another horse to run into Regal Intention. He never recovered and finished eleventh in the thirteen-horse field behind upset winner, Dancing Spree. At age five, Regal Intention made eight starts with his single win coming in the Jacques Cartier Stakes at Woodbine Racetrack.

Written in the first person narrative, the introductory biography of the protagonist is closely patterned after that of the author. Plot introduction Peter Halloran, a migrant to South Africa after the end of World War II has established himself as a successful and profitable designer and builder of yachts and small watercraft. Life is good – business is good, and he has a beautiful wife and daughter. One day, in the local yacht club bar, he meets Walker, an alcoholic ex-soldier, who tells him an improbable tale of a hidden treasure. When Walker was a prisoner of war in Fascist Italy, he managed to escape with a small band of Allied prisoners, including an Afrikaner named Coertze and some Italian partisans, and waged a guerilla campaign for several months in the hills of Liguria against the Nazi Germans. Towards the end of the war, their band ambushed a truck convoy, which contained a massive treasure in gold bars, jewels and even the State Crown of Ethiopia. Rather than turn the treasure over to the authorities, they hid the trucks in an abandoned mine and sealed the entrance. Now that the war is over, the treasure is for the claiming, provided that they can think of some way to smuggle it past Italian customs. Halloran thinks little of the tale until several years later, when life has turned sour. His wife having been killed in a traffic accident, he finds that he needs a change in life. A chance re- encounter with Walker leads to a meeting with Coertze, and with the three men agreeing to a partnership to recover the treasure. Walker and Coertze know where it is, and Halloran has the perfect solution to getting it out of the country. But questions start to worry Halloran – such as why only Walker and Coertze survived out of the much larger group of guerillas, and why Walker is so terrified of Coertze? The mystery deepens as the men travel to Tangiers, and from thence to ports around the Mediterranean and find their steps dogged by unsavory characters. It is soon clear that they are not the only ones after the treasure.

Its loss required an even longer detour for freight trains coming to New York City from the southwest. New York Central Railroad map from 1929 shows the Water Level Route avoids major elevation changes The Selkirk Hurdle is the term used by urban planners, railroad employees, politicians, and others to describe the route that must be taken by freight trains traveling between New York City and other points in downstate New York that are east of the Hudson River, and locations in the United States to the south and west. There are no rail freight bridges or tunnels that cross the Hudson River south of Selkirk, which is 10 miles (16 km) south of Albany and the home of Selkirk Yard, a major CSX classification yard. As a result, trains from Long Island and New York City (except for the borough of Staten Island which has a rail bridge to New Jersey) must travel north to cross at Selkirk before continuing on their way.\\"USING BARGES TO REVIVE A RAIL ROUTE\\", The New York Times, May 4, 1986. Accessed January 3, 2008. \\"That is because in recent years virtually all rail traffic between Brooklyn, Queens, and Long Island, at one end, and points south, at the other, has traveled over the Selkirk Hurdle, a loop that extends up the eastern bank of the Hudson River to a bridge at Selkirk, New York, near Albany, then down the western side of the river.\\" Advocates claim that this detour and the inefficiencies that result force New York City to rely more heavily on relatively inefficient trucks than most parts of the United States, where freight trains are more common. However, at least for traffic to and from the west, this route was touted for its efficiency as the \\"Water Level Route\\" by the New York Central Railroad because trains using it did not have to climb over the Appalachian Mountains, and it is still used by the New York Central's successor, CSX, for traffic to both sides of the Hudson River. To cross the Hudson, trains must use the Alfred H. Smith Memorial Bridge or another bridge further north near Mechanicville, New York, operated by Pan Am Southern railroad. A 1974 fire ended service across a railroad bridge at Poughkeepsie, north of New York City.The Beacon Line by Pierce Haviland Because of the height of the bridge, trains still had to travel west to Maybrook, New York and back, limiting its use when it was in service. Although the bridge at Poughkeepsie still stands, the rails have been removed and it became a New York State park in 2009. The only alternative to the Selkirk Hurdle is for rail cars to be floated across Upper New York Bay, an operation run until 2006 by the New York Cross Harbor Railroad, and currently by New York New Jersey Rail, LLC, now owned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The Port Authority is investing in improvements to its decayed infrastructure, much of which was washed away by Hurricane Sandy.

Listed at , 210 lb., Howell batted left-handed and threw right-handed. A native of Bowman (or Harold), Kentucky, he grew up in Dehue, West Virginia. Career Howell spent three years in the Cleveland Indians' minor league system (1937–39) before joining the big team in 1940. While in the minors, he set a record in the Eastern League by striking out 20 batters in a single game (1939). In three relief appearances for the Indians, he posted a 1.80 earned run average in five innings pitched and did not have a decision. Despite being regarded as one of the finest prospects in the Cleveland organization, recurring illness and sore arm problems kept him from reaching his full potential. In 1943, Howell was purchased by the Cincinnati Reds and assigned to the International League. He helped the Syracuse Chiefs clinch the league pennant with a 13–9 mark and was promoted to the major league roster for the next season. But in November 1943, he entered military service with the U.S. Army. He served in France and Belgium during World War II and was taken prisoner by the German troops in September 1944, being liberated by advancing Allied forces six months later. He returned to the United States and was discharged from military service late in 1945. Howell went to spring training with Cincinnati in 1946, playing for Syracuse for the next four years. He had a 17–12 record with the Chiefs in 1948, and appeared in five games with the Reds in 1949. In 1950, Howell was purchased by the New York Giants and assigned to the Minneapolis Millers of the American Association. He enjoyed a fine season with the Millers, going 14–2 during the regular season and pitching a no-hitter against Columbus on August 10. Recurring arm problems made him consider retiring before returning to Minneapolis in 1952, but he decided to keep playing. Nevertheless, he was sold to Philadelphia Phillies on January 20, returned to the Giants on May 15, purchased by the Chicago White Sox a week later, and assigned to the Memphis Chicks of the Southern Association, where his timely relief pitching led Memphis to the Dixie Series title. Howell remained with the Chicks in 1953 and 1954, before returning to major league action in 1955 with the White Sox as an experienced relief specialist, and for the next four years. His most productive season came in 1955, when he recorded career-highs in wins (8), earned run average (2.93), saves (9), games finished (25) and innings (). In a six-season career, Howell posted a 19–15 record with a 3.78 earned run average and 19 saves in 115 appearances, including 99 strikeouts, 103 walks, two starts, 68 games finished and innings of work. He also helped himself with the bat, hitting a .243 average (18-for-74) with five home runs and nine run batted in in 124 games, including two doubles, one triple, eight runs, and a .500 slugging percentage. After that, Howell pitched for the Indianapolis Indians of the American Association in 1958 and 1959. He died at age 40 after suffering a heart attack while running at the Indians' 1960 spring training camp in Hollywood, Florida. Records Howell holds two of the most unusual records in major league history: * the longest time (16 years) between his first major league pitching appearance (1940) and his first win (1955) * the all-time regular-season record for most hits (5) without collecting a single (3 home runs, double, triple in 27 at-bats in 1957). As of 2019, he is the only player ever to have a season where his singles total was less than any of the other three totals (doubles, triples, home runs).

The house and seven other properties by Wright were inscribed on the World Heritage List under the title \\"The 20th-Century Architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright\\" in July 2019. Description Living room of the Herbert and Katherine Jacobs First House, commonly referred to as Jacobs I, June 2015 The Jacobs House is located in a residential area southwest of downtown Madison, on the east side of Toepfer Avenue between Birch and Euclid Avenues. It is a modest single-story structure, its exterior finished in a combination of brick, horizontal boarding, and glass doors, the latter opening from the rear of the house. It is covered by a flat roof and rests on a concrete pad foundation. Its interior space is , and has two bedrooms. The house's original heating system consisted of steam heating pipes laid in the sand base that underlies the main concrete pad. The furnace that provided the steam heat was located in a small basement space under the kitchen. History Exterior of the Herbert and Katherine Jacobs First House, commonly referred to as Jacobs I, June 2015 Madison newspaperman Herbert Jacobs, a Wright acquaintance, challenged the architect to design and build a home for $5,000 ().Heinz, Thomas A., The Vision of Frank Lloyd Wright, Regency House Publishing, 2000 Wright designed an L-shaped structure with an open floor plan and two bedrooms. To economize construction costs Wright developed a plywood sandwich wall for use on this house. Rumor maintains that redirected bricks from the Johnson Wax Building ultimately helped keep final construction costs at $5,500.Heinz, Thomas A., Frank Lloyd Wright Field Guide, Vol 1., Academy Editions, 1996 Jacobs First House , 2017 The Jacobs family moved into the house after construction but quickly outgrew the two-bedroom ranch. Herbert Jacobs commissioned Wright to build a second home, Jacobs II. The family moved there in the late 1940s. Over the following decades the house passed ownership and was exposed to modifications and maintenance techniques of variable historical value. A multi-year restoration project began in 1983, restoring the house to its 1937 appearance and updating worn and inefficient building systems.

The feature vector's homomorphic encryption allows search and match to be conducted in polynomial time on an encrypted dataset and the search result is returned as an encrypted match. One or more computing devices may use an encrypted feature vector to verify an individual person (1:1 verify) or identify an individual in a datastore (1:many identify) without storing, sending or receiving plaintext biometric data within or between computing devices or any other entity. The purpose of private biometrics is to allow a person to be identified or authenticated while guaranteeing individual privacy and fundamental human rights by only operating on biometric data in the encrypted space. __TOC__  Background  Biometric security strengthens user authentication but, until recently, also implied important risks to personal privacy. Indeed, while compromised passwords can be easily replaced and are not personally identifiable information(PII), biometric data is considered highly sensitive due to its personal nature, unique association with users, and the fact that compromised biometrics (biometric templates) cannot be revoked or replaced. Private biometrics have been developed to address this challenge. Private Biometrics provide the necessary biometric authentication while simultaneously minimizing user's privacy exposure through the use of one-way, fully homomorphic encryption. The Biometric Open Protocol Standard, IEEE 2410-2018, was updated in 2018 to include private biometrics and stated that the one-way fully homomorphic encrypted feature vectors, “...bring a new level of consumer privacy assurance by keeping biometric data encrypted both at rest and in transit.” The Biometric Open Protocol Standard (BOPS III) also noted a key benefit of private biometrics was the new standard allowed for simplification of the API since the biometric payload was always one-way encrypted and therefore had no need for key management. Biometrics Open Protocol (BOPS) III. IEEE 2410-2018, IEEE Standards Association. 2018. Accessed 7/22/2018.  Fully homomorphic cryptosystems for biometrics  Historically, biometric matching techniques have been unable to operate in the encrypted space and have required the biometric to be visible (unencrypted) at specific points during search and match operations. This decrypt requirement made large-scale search across encrypted biometrics (“1:many identify”) infeasible due to both significant overhead issues (e.g. complex key management and significant data storage and processing requirements) and the substantial risk that the biometrics were vulnerable to loss when processed in plaintext within the application or operating system (see FIDO Alliance, for example). Biometric security vendors complying with data privacy laws and regulations (including Apple FaceID, Samsung, Google) therefore focused their efforts on the simpler 1:1 verify problem and were unable to overcome the large computational demands required for linear scan to solve the 1:many identify problem.Selleck, Evan. “Craig Federighi Says Apple is ‘Focusing Face ID on Single User Authentication.’” Phone Hacks. 12-01-2017. Accessed 7-15-2018. Today, private biometric cryptosystems overcome these limitations and risks through the use of one-way, fully homomorphic encryption. This form of encryption allows computations to be carried out on ciphertext, allows the match to be conducted on an encrypted dataset without decrypting the reference biometric, and returns an encrypted match result. Matching in the encrypted space offers the highest levels of accuracy, speed and privacy and eliminates the risks associated with decrypting biometrics. = Accuracy: same as plaintext (99%) = The private biometric feature vector is much smaller (0.05% the size of the original biometric template) but yet maintains the same accuracy as the original plaintext reference biometric. In testing using Google's unified embedding for face recognition and clustering CNN (“Facenet”),Florian Schroff, Dmitry Kalenichenko, James Philbin. “FaceNet: A unified embedding for face recognition and clustering.” CVPR 2015: 815-823 Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) (source), and other open source faces, private biometric feature vectors returned the same accuracy as plaintext facial recognition. Using an 8MB facial biometric, one vendor reported an accuracy rate of 98.7%. The same vendor reported accuracy increased to 99.99% when using three 8MB facial biometrics and a vote algorithm (best two out of 3) to predict.Private.id As the quality of the facial biometric image declined, accuracy degraded very slowly. For 256kB facial images (3% the quality of an 8MB picture), the same vendor reported 96.3% accuracy and that the neural network was able to maintain similar accuracy through boundary conditions including extreme cases of light or background.Unpublished 2018 white paper, Private Identity, LLC. = Speed: polynomial search (same as plaintext) = The private biometric feature vector is 4kB and contains 128 floating point numbers. In contrast, plaintext biometric security instances (including Apple Face IDEvans, Johnny. “iPhone X & Face ID: Everything you need to know.” ComputerWorld. 9/13/2017. Accessed 7/22/2018) currently use 7MB to 8MB reference facial biometrics (templates). By using the much smaller feature vector, the resulting search performance is less than one second per prediction using a datastore of 100 million open source faces (“polynomial search”).Ben Shneiderman. 1973. Polynomial search. Softw. Pract. Exper. 3, 1 (January 1973), 5-8. The private biometric test model used for these results was Google's unified embedding for face recognition and clustering CNN (“Facenet”), Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) (source), and other open source faces. = Privacy: full compliance with privacy regulations worldwide = As with all ideal one-way cryptographic hash functions, decrypt keys do not exist for private biometrics so it is infeasible to generate the original biometric message from the private biometric feature vector (its hash value) except by trying all possible messages. Unlike passwords, however, no two instances of a biometric are exactly the same or, stated in another way, there is no constant biometric value, so a brute force attack using all possible faces would only produce an approximate (fuzzy) match. Privacy and fundamental human rights are therefore guaranteed. Specifically, the private biometric feature vector is produced by a one-way cryptographic hash algorithm that maps plaintext biometric data of arbitrary size to a small feature vector of a fixed size (4kB) that is mathematically impossible to invert. The one-way encryption algorithm is typically achieved using a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN), which takes a vector of arbitrary real-valued scores and squashes it to a 4kB vector of values between zero and one that sum to one.Karn, Ujjwal. “An Intuitive Explanation of Convolutional Neural Networks.” The Data Science Blog. 8/11/2016, Accessed 7/22/2018. It is mathematically impossible to reconstruct the original plaintext image from a private biometric feature vector of 128 floating point numbers.Lian, Shiguo, Jinsheng Sun, and Zhiquan Wang. \\"One-way hash function based on neural network.\\"  One-way encryption, history and modern use  One-way encryptions offer unlimited privacy by containing no mechanism to reverse the encryption and disclose the original data. Once a value is processed through a one-way hash, it is not possible to discover to the original value (hence the name “one- way”). = History = The first one-way encryptions were likely developed by James H. Ellis, Clifford Cocks, and Malcolm Williamson at the UK intelligence agency GCHQ during the 1960s and 1970s and were published independently by Diffie and Hellman in 1976 (History of cryptography). Common modern one-way encryption algorithms, including MD5 (message digest) and SHA-512 (secure hash algorithm) are similar to the first such algorithms in that they also contain no mechanism to disclose the original data. The output of these modern one-way encryptions offer high privacy but are not homomorphic, meaning that the results of the one-way encryptions do not allow high order math operations (such as match). For example, we cannot use two SHA-512 sums to compare the closeness of two encrypted documents. This limitation makes it impossible for these one-way encryptions to be used to support classifying models in machine learning—or nearly anything else. = Modern use = The first one-way, homomorphically encrypted, Euclidean-measurable feature vector for biometric processing was proposed in a paper by Streit, Streit and Suffian in 2017. Streit, S. Streit, B and Suffian S. “Privacy-Enabled Biometric Search.” CoRR. 1708.04726 (2017). In this paper, the authors theorized and also demonstrated using a small sample size (n=256 faces) that (1) it was possible to use neural networks to build a cryptosystem for biometrics that produced one-way, fully homomorphic feature vectors composed of normalized floating-point values; (2) the same neural network would also be useful for 1:1 verification (matching); and (3) the same neural network would not be useful in 1:many identification tasks since search would occur in linear time (i.e. non polynomial). The paper's first point was (in theory) later shown to be true, and the papers first, second and third points were later shown to be true only for small samples but not for larger samples. A later tutorial (blog posting) by Mandel in 2018 demonstrated a similar approach to Streit, Streit and Suffian and confirmed using a Frobenius 2 distance function to determine the closeness of two feature vectors. In this posting, Mandel used a Frobenius 2 distance function to determine the closeness of two feature vectors and also demonstrated successful 1:1 verification. Mandel did not offer a scheme for 1:many identification as this method would have required a non polynomial full linear scan of the entire database. The Streit, Streit and Suffian paper attempted a novel “banding” approach for 1:many identification in order to mitigate the full linear scan requirement, but it is now understood that this approach produced too much overlap to help in identification.Mandal, Arun. “MTCNN Face Detection and Matching using Facenet Tensorflow.” Python 3.6. Posted: 2018-02-16. Accessed 2018-07-15  First production implementation  The first claimed commercial implementation of private biometrics, Private.id, was published by Private Identity, LLC in May 2018 by using the same method to provide 1:many identification in polynomial time across a large biometrics database (100 million faces). On the client device, Private.id transforms each reference biometric (template) into a one-way, fully homomorphic, Euclidean-measurable feature vector using matrix multiplication from the neural network that may then be stored locally or transmitted. The original biometric is deleted immediately after the feature vector is computed or, if the solution is embedded in firmware, the biometric is transient and never stored. Once the biometric is deleted, it is no longer possible to lose or compromise the biometric. The Private.id feature vector can be used in one of two ways. If the feature vector is stored locally, it may be used to compute 1:1 verification with high accuracy (99% or greater) using linear mathematics. If the feature vector is also stored in a Cloud, the feature vector may also be used as input for a neural network to perform 1:many identification with the same accuracy, speed and privacy as the original plaintext reference biometric (template). = Compliance = Private biometrics use the following two properties in deriving compliance with biometric data privacy laws and regulations worldwide. First, the private biometrics encryption is a one-way encryption, so loss of privacy by decryption is mathematically impossible and privacy is therefore guaranteed. Second, since no two instances of a biometric are exactly the same or, stated in another way, there is no constant biometric value, the private biometrics one-way encrypted feature vector is Euclidean Measureable in order to provide a mechanism to determine a fuzzy match in which two instances of the same identity are “closer” than two instances of a different identity.  IEEE Biometric Open Protocol Standard (BOPS III)  The IEEE 2410-2018 Biometric Open Protocol Standard was updated in 2018 to include private biometrics. The specification stated that one-way fully homomorphic encrypted feature vectors, “bring a new level of consumer privacy assurance by keeping biometric data encrypted both at rest and in transit.” IEEE 2410-2018 also noted a key benefit of private biometrics is that the new standard allows for simplification of the API since the biometric payload is always one-way encrypted and there is no need for key management.  Discussion: passive encryption and data security compliance  Private biometrics enables passive encryption (encryption at rest), the most difficult requirement of the US Department of Defense Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC). No other cryptosystem or method provides operations on rested encrypted data, so passive encryption—an unfulfilled requirement of the TCSEC since 1983, is no longer an issue. Private biometrics technology is an enabling technology for applications and operating systems—but itself does not directly address—the auditing and constant protection concepts introduced in the TCSEC.  US DoD Standard Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC)  Private biometrics, as implemented in a system that conforms to IEEE 2410-2018 BOPS III, satisfies the privacy requirements of the US Department of Defense Standard Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC). The TCSEC sets the basic requirements for assessing the effectiveness of computer security controls built into a computer system (“Orange Book, section B1”). Today, the applications and operating systems contain features that comply with TCSEC levels C2 and B1 except they lack homomorphic encryption and so do not process data encrypted at rest. We typically, if not always, obtained waivers, because there was not a known work around. Adding private biometrics to these operating systems and applications resolves this issue. For example, consider the case of a typical MySQL database. To query MySQL in a reasonable period of time, we need data that maps to indexes that maps to queries that maps to end user data. To do this, we work with plaintext. The only way to encrypt this is to encrypt the entire data store, and to decrypt the entire data store, prior to use. Since data use is constant, the data is never encrypted. Thus, in the past we would apply for waivers because there was no known work around. Now using private biometrics, we can match and do operations on data that is always encrypted. = Multiple Independent Levels of Security/Safety (MILS) architecture = Private biometrics, as implemented in a system that conforms to IEEE 2410-2018 BOPS III, comply with the standards of the Multiple Independent Levels of Security/Safety (MILS) architecture. MILS builds on the Bell and La Padula theories on secure systems that represent the foundational theories of the US DoD Standard Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC), or the DoD “Orange Book.” (See paragraphs above.) Private biometrics’ high-assurance security architecture is based on the concepts of separation and controlled information flow and implemented using only mechanisms that support trustworthy components, thus the security solution is non-bypassable, evaluable, always invoked and tamper proof. This is achieved using the one-way encrypted feature vector, which elegantly allows only encrypted data (and never stores or processes plaintext) between security domains and through trustworthy security monitors. Specifically, private biometrics systems are: * Non-bypassable, as plaintext biometrics cannot use another communication path, including lower level mechanisms, to bypass the security monitor since the original biometric is transient at inception (e.g. the biometric template acquired by the client device exists only for a few seconds at inception and then is deleted or never stored). * Evaluable in that the feature vectors are modular, well designed, well specified, well implemented, small and of low complexity. * Always-invoked, in that each and every message is always one-way encrypted independent of security monitors. * Tamperproof in that the feature vector's one-way encryption prevents unauthorized changes and does not use systems that control rights to the security monitor code, configuration and data. History = Implicit authentication and private equality testing = Unsecure biometric data are sensitive due to their nature and how they can be used. Implicit authentication is a common practice when using passwords, as a user may prove knowledge of a password without actually revealing it. However, two biometric measurements of the same person may differ, and this fuzziness of biometric measurements renders implicit authentication protocols useless in the biometrics domain. Similarly, private equality testing, where two devices or entities want to check whether the values that they hold are the same without presenting them to each other or to any other device or entity, is well practiced and detailed solutions have been published. However, since two biometrics of the same person may not be equal, these protocols are also ineffective in the biometrics domain. For instance, if the two values differ in τ bits, then one of the parties may need to present 2τ candidate values for checking. Privacy-Preserving Biometric Authentication and Matching via Lattice-Based Encryption Constantinos Patsakis, Jeroen van Rest, Michal Choras and M´elanie Bouroche = Homomorphic encryption = Prior to the introduction of private biometrics, biometric techniques required the use of plaintext search for matching so each biometric was required to be visible (unencrypted) at some point in the search process. It was recognized that it would be beneficial to instead conduct matching on an encrypted dataset. Encrypt match is typically accomplished using one-way encryption algorithms, meaning that given the encrypted data, there is no mechanism to get to the original data. Common one-way encryption algorithms are MD5 and SHA-512. However, these algorithms are not homomorphic, meaning that there is no way to compare the closeness of two samples of encrypted data, and thus no means to compare. The inability to compare renders any form of classifying model in machine learning untenable. Homomorphic encryption is a form of encryption that allows computations to be carried out on ciphertext, thus generating an encrypted match result. Matching in the encrypted space using a one-way encryption offers the highest level of privacy. With a payload of feature vectors one-way encrypted, there is no need to decrypt and no need for key management. A promising method of homomorphic encryption on biometric data is the use of machine learning models to generate feature vectors. For black-box models, such as neural networks, these vectors can not by themselves be used to recreate the initial input data and are therefore a form of one-way encryption. However, the vectors are euclidean measurable, so similarity between vectors can be calculated. This process allows for biometric data to be homomorphically encrypted. For instance if we consider facial recognition performed with the Euclidean Distance, when we match two face images using a neural network, first each face is converted to a float vector, which in the case of Google's FaceNet, is of size 128. The representation of this float vector is arbitrary and cannot be reverse-engineered back to the original face. Indeed, the matrix multiplication from the neural network then becomes the vector of the face, is Euclidean measurable but unrecognizable, and cannot map back to any image. = Prior approaches used to solve private biometrics = Prior to the availability of private biometrics, research focused on ensuring the prover's biometric would be protected against misuse by a dishonest verifier through the use of partially homomorphic data or decrypted(plaintext) data coupled with a private verification function intended to shield private data from the verifier. This method introduced a computational and communication overhead which was computationally inexpensive for 1:1 verification but proved infeasible for large 1:many identification requirements. From 1998 to 2018 cryptographic researchers pursued four independent approaches to solve the problem: cancelable biometrics, BioHashing, Biometric Cryptosystems, and two-way partially homomorphic encryption.

Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg.  Feature transformation approach  The feature transformation approach “transformed” biometric feature data to random data through the use of a client-specific key or password. Examples of this approach included biohashing and cancelable biometrics. The approach offered reasonable performance but was found to be insecure if the client-specific key was compromised. Cancelable Biometrics The first use of indirect biometric templates (later called cancelable biometrics) was proposed in 1998 by Davida, Frankel and Matt.G. Davida, Y. Frankel, B.J. Matt, On enabling secure applications through off-line biometrics identification, in: Proceeding Symposium on Privacy and Security, 1998, pp. 148–157 Three years later, Ruud Bolle, Nilini Ratha and Jonathan Connell, working in IBM's Exploratory Computer Vision Group, proposed the first concrete idea of cancelable biometrics. N. Ratha, J. Connell, R.M. Bolle, Enhancing security and privacy in biometrics-based authentication systems, IBM Syst. J. 40 (3) (2001) 614–634 R.M. Bolle, J.H. Connell, N.K. Ratha, Biometrics perils and patches, Pattern Recognition 35 (2002) 2727–2738. Cancelable biometrics were defined in these communications as biometric templates that were unique for every application and that, if lost, could be easily cancelled and replaced. The solution was (at the time) thought to provide higher privacy levels by allowing multiple templates to be associated with the same biometric data by storing only the transformed (hashed) version of the biometric template. The solution was also promoted for its ability to prevent linkage of the user's biometric data across various databases since only a transformed version of the biometric template (and not the unencrypted (plaintext) biometric template) was stored for later use.

Ratha, Biometrics perils and patches, Pattern Recognition 35 (2002) 2727–2738. Cancelable biometrics were deemed useful because of their diversity, reusability and one-way encryption (which, at the time, was referred to as a one-way transformation). Specifically, no cancellable template could be used in two different applications (diversity); it was straightforward to revoke and reissuance a cancellable template in the event of compromise (reusability); and the one-way hash of the template prevented recovery of sensitive biometric data. Finally, it was postulated that the transformation would not deteriorate accuracy. B.J. Andrew Teoh, A. Goh, C.L. David Ngo, Random multispace quantisation as an analytic mechanism for biohashing of biometric and random identity inputs, IEEE Trans. Pattern Anal. Mach. Intell. 28 (12) (2006) 1892–1901. * BioHashing Research into cancelable biometrics moved into BioHashing by 2004. The BioHashing feature transformation technique was first published by Jin, Ling and Goh and combined biometric features and a tokenized (pseudo-) random number (TRN). Specifically, BioHash combined the biometric template with a user-specific TRN to produce a set of non-invertible binary bit strings that were thought to be irreproducible if both the biometric and the TRN were not presented simultaneously. ATB Jin, DNC Ling, A Goh. “Biohashing: two factor authentication featuring fingerprint data and tokenised random number.” Pattern recognition 37 (11), 2245-2255. (2004) Indeed, it was first claimed that the BioHashing technique had achieved perfect accuracy (equal error rates) for faces, fingerprints and palm prints, and the method gained further traction when its extremely low error rates were combined with the claim that its biometric data was secure against loss because factoring the inner products of biometrics feature and TRN was an intractable problem. By 2005, however, researchers Cheung and Kong (Hong Kong Polytechnic and University of Waterloo) asserted in two journal articles that BioHashing performance was actually based on the sole use of TRN and conjectured that the introduction of any form of biometric become meaningless since the system could be used only with the tokens.

Biometric cryptosystem approach  Biometric cryptosystems were originally developed to either secure cryptographic keys using biometric features (“key-biometrics binding”) or to directly generate cryptographic keys from biometric features. Ann Cavoukian and Alex Stoianov Biometric Encryption Chapter from the Encyclopedia of Biometrics. Biometric cryptosystems used cryptography to provide the system with cryptographic keys protection and biometrics to provide the system with dynamically generate keys to secure the template and biometric system. Jisha Nair.b.j., Ranjitha Kumari.s, \\"A review on biometric cryptosystems.\\" International Journal Of Latest Trends In Engineering And Technology. Volume 6 Issue 1 - September 2015 The acceptance and deployment of biometric cryptosystem solutions was constrained, however, by the fuzziness related with biometric data. Hence, error correction codes (ECCs), including includes fuzzy vault and fuzzy commitment, were adopted to alleviate the fuzziness of the biometric data. This overall approach proved impractical, however, due to the need for accurate authentication and suffered from security issues due to its need for strong restriction to support authentication accuracy. Teoh, Andrew & Kim, Jaihie. (2015). Error Correction Codes for Biometric Cryptosystem. 한국통신학회지 (정보와통신). 32. 39-49. Future research on biometric cryptosystems is likely to focus on a number of remaining implementation challenges and security issues involving both the fuzzy representations of biometric identifiers and the imperfect nature of biometric feature extraction and matching algorithms. And, unfortunately, since biometric cryptosystems can, at the current time, be defeated using relatively simple strategies leveraging both weaknesses of the current systems (the fuzzy representations of biometric identifiers and the imperfect nature of biometric feature extraction and matching algorithms), it is unlikely that these systems will be able to deliver acceptable end-to-end system performance until suitable advances are achieved.  Two-way partially homomorphic encryption approach  The two-way partially homomorphic encryption method for private biometrics was similar to the today's private biometrics in that it offered protection of biometric feature data through the use of homomorphic encryption and measured the similarity of encrypted feature data by metrics such as the Hamming and the Euclidean distances. However, the method was vulnerable to data loss due to the existence of secret keys that were to be managed by trusted parties. Widespread adoption of the approach also suffered from the encryption schemes’ complex key management and large computational and data storage requirements.

Vol. 13. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 12 Jan. 2013 Life Risby was born in the parish of St. Lawrence, Reading, in 1489, and entered Winchester College in 1500. He was subsequently a fellow of New College, Oxford, taking his degree in 1510. He resigned in 1513 to enter the Franciscan Order, and eventually became guardian of the Observant friary at Canterbury. Memorial in St Elizabeth of Portugal Church, Richmond, Surrey Risby became a supporter of Dame Elizabeth Barton, O.S.B., widely known as the \\"Holy Maid of Kent\\", who had the reputation of being a visionary. When she declared that King Henry would soon die if he continued his actions against the papacy, a prophecy that failed to come to pass within the time she predicted, the king turned against her and she was condemned to death by an Act of Attainder (25 Henry VIII, c. 12), together with several of her supporters: Hugh Rich, O.F.M., guardian of the Observant friary at Richmond, Edward Bocking and John Dering, B.D. (Oxon.), both Benedictine monks of Christ Church, Canterbury, Henry Gold, M.A. (St. John's College, Cambridge), Parson of St. Mary Aldermanbury, London, and Vicar of Hayes, Middlesex, and Richard Master, M.A. (King's College, Oxon), Rector of Aldington, Kent, who was pardoned; but by some oversight Master's name was included and Risby's omitted in the catalogue of praetermissi. Friar Thomas Bourchier, who took the Franciscan habit at Greenwich about 1557, wrote a work chronicling the lives of the Observant friars who were executed under the Tudors, In it he wrote that Risby and Rich had been offered their freedom twice, if they would accept the king's supremacy. Risby was executed by hanging along with the others, including Barton, at Tyburn, London, on 20 April 1534.

Plot introduction David Wyatt is a white West Indian, originally from St Kitts by way of Grenada, and is a meteorologist working with the United States Navy's “Hurricane hunter” flights researching storms and severe weather patterns. He is based out of San Fernandez, a fictional Caribbean island nation with a history and political background strikingly similar to Haiti. Wyatt is convinced that Hurricane Mabel will strike San Fernandez head-on, with a storm surge that will flood its capital of St Pierre, potentially killing thousands. The United States Navy is not convinced, as their computer models indicate that the hurricane will pass by, and the paranoid, megalomaniacal dictator of San Fernandez, General Serrurier, will hear nothing of it. A hurricane has not struck San Fernandez in over fifty years, and he has much more important things to worry about – such as an armed revolt against his rule.

Built in 1946-48, the house was the second of two designed by Frank Lloyd Wright for journalist Herbert Jacobs and his wife Katherine. The house's design is unique among Wright's works; he called the style the \\"Solar Hemicycle\\" due to its semicircular layout and use of natural materials to conserve solar energy. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974 and declared a National Historic Landmark in 2003. History and architecture Wright was a close personal friend of the Jacobs couple. He designed his first house for them in 1936 and that house was Wright's first experiment with a Usonian design, his vision for affordable housing in the United States. The Jacobses moved to a more rural part of the Madison area in 1942 to become part-time farmers; as they had to give up their original home, they asked Wright to design a new one for them. After initially proposing an existing plan that another client had not completed, Wright proposed another experimental plan for the new house in 1944. Due to delays on Wright's part, construction did not begin until 1946, and most of the work did not take place until 1948. By this point, Wright had become offended by a comment Herbert had made in We Chose the Country, one of his works, and he left the couple to build the house themselves without his guidance. The house's garage Wright gave the house a unique design which he called a \\"Solar Hemicycle\\". The house's plan is a segment of a circle, a design which Wright borrowed from an unbuilt plan he made for Lloyd Burlingham in 1942. Circular rooms and elements, such as the house's bathroom, fireplace, and pools, came from a 1938 design which was later built on the grounds of Taliesin West. Wright had the house built from stone, concrete, and wood, materials which would allow the house to retain solar energy; the design represents an early attempt at energy-efficient architecture. The house's north berm was originally proposed as an easily built stone wall for a community in Detroit; in the Jacobs house, it serves as a windbreak which prevents strong winds from damaging the glass windows. Due to their weight, the house's stone walls were not built on the concrete floor, as was common in other Wright houses; rather, deep foundations filled with crushed stone supported the walls. Unlike many of Wright's works, the design was never reused or modified for later clients; while two clients purchased plans which were effectively reflections of the house, they were never constructed.

After completing his obligatory military service in Spain, he toured with the best known companies at the time (including Vicente Escudero, Jose Greco and Carmen Amaya). Eventually, his lifetime childhood friend, Juan Antonio Aguero, married Carmen Amaya, and Mario married her sister Maria, with whom he had a son (Juan Antonio Jesus). He soon travelled to the US as first soloist. Along with others such as Sabicas, Carlos Montoya and Juan Serrano, Escudero helped forge the viability of solo flamenco guitar as a concert instrument with lauded performances at New York's Carnegie Hall, Town Hall, and other venues. Invited to perform at the White House for President John F. Kennedy, Escudero was counted among the best in his era; Ramón Montoya called him \\"the best flamenco guitarist of this new generation.\\" Family background and biography Mario Escudero was born in Alicante, Spain on October 11, 1928. His mother was Alfonsa Josefina Valero Valverde (d. 1947, when he was 19), a Spanish singer, native of Villanueva de los Infantes, Ciudad Real (although the family had migrated there from Camas, Sevilla), and his father was Jesus Escudero Jiménez (d. 1966), a gypsy \\"por los cuatro costados\\" as it is commonly said in Spain. His family originally came from Navarra, Spain, although they also settled in Huesca and Zaragoza (Aragón), where Jesus was born. Mario was an only child. Emigrating to San Sebastian, the family opened and ran a very successful tailor shop close to \\"La Concha\\" beach. The breakout of the civil war, however, forced them to emigrate to southern France. While in France, the Escudero family formed a flamenco group with family members and performed with artists like Maurice Chevalier and Mistinguette. His first performance, at the age of 9, was with Maurice Chevalier at the Cinema Galia in Bordeaux, France. In France, he received his first schooling and became fluent in French, as he also did in English later in life. After the war, the family settled in Madrid, where they lived on a side street off Gran Vía (San Marcos #4). While his first teacher was his father, he took classical guitar and music lessons with Daniel Fortea (a pupil of Francisco Tárrega), and flamenco guitar lessons with Ramón Montoya. Notwithstanding, his influences also include Niño Ricardo and other contemporaries. In 1944, he debuted in Madrid at the Teatro Español with Vicente Escudero and Carmita García. In later years, he expanded his musical training studying harmony and counterpoint with Walter Piston's well known texts, and wrote down most of his best known pieces. He recorded three albums of duets with Sabicas (see below). He also recorded several other recording with Sabicas, his brother Diego Castellon, Enrique Montoya, Domingo Alvarado. In total, his discography includes more than 30 long play records. He often performed with flamenco dancer Anita Ramos, who played castanets and zapateados on the recordings, and the two eventually married and had three children. In fact, Sabicas and Mario Escudero were not only \\"compadres\\" (Sabicas was the godfather of one of Mario's children, Agustín Mario Manuel), but were related through family ties through Jiménez, Carbonell and Gabarre. Both had several common ancestors, the best known being Agustina Escudero Heredia (known as the \\"Queen of the Gypsies\\"), married to Benigno García Gabarre, and one of Ignacio Zuloaga's (well known Spanish painter) main models. Agustina was also the mother of the bullfighter Rafael Albaicín and the dancers Miguel and Maria Albaicín. Praise and standing ovations from critics and public paved the way for more work, with Escudero touring throughout Europe, South America, and eventually the US. His first two solo Carnegie Hall concerts sold out, and garnered acclaim and praise, leading to several television appearances. Escudero first settled in San Gabriel, California, performing at El Poche while continuing with a busy national and international concert schedule and many recording engagements. Becoming a US citizen in 1969, he was the first flamenco guitarist to tour the Soviet Union (1973) to perform as a flamenco guitar soloist and as a private citizen - the only condition the State owned Gosconcert imposed for the concerts is that he had to perform in the typical \\"traje corto\\" outfit (which he did regularly anyway). He was invited again on a second tour in 1979. In 1965, he established his US residence in New York City (midtown-Manhattan/58th & 6th Avenue) and his Spanish residence in the \\"barrio\\" Heliopolis where he owned a home. After 1981, he lived mostly in Sevilla and returned to the US for concert tours and recordings. In 1994, a victim of acute Alzheimer's disease, he sought advanced treatment of this disease in Miami, Florida where he received excellent compassionate care. He died on November 19, 2004 and is buried in the Cemetery of Fuencarral, Madrid, in the family tomb with his mother Alfonsa Valero Valverde, his aunt Carmen Valero Valverde and cousin Juan Alvarez Valero.

It is operated by Line 13 from Grefsen to Bekkestua of the Oslo Tramway, operated by Oslo Sporvognsdrift. The line continues on the Oslo Metro west of Jar as part of the Kolsås Line, and as a street tramway on the Oslo tramway system at Skøyen as the Skøyen Line. Route SL95 tram at Lilleaker The Lilleaker Line runs from Skøyen to Jar. The line is a standard gauge, double track light rail line with 750 volt overhead wire. At Skøyen it connects with the Skøyen Line of the Oslo Tramway and at Jar to the Kolsås Line of the Oslo Metro. Most of the route is dominated by housing. At Skøyen, there is a short walk to Skøyen Station on the mainline Drammen Line. It serves all west-bound trains of the Oslo Commuter Rail, some regional trains and the Airport Express Train. The station is also an important bus hub serving several routes. The route continues via Hoff and Abbdediengen and Ullern. Previously a station was located at Bestum, but this was closed due to the vicinity to Ullern. The line then passes Furulund and Sollerud before reaching Lilleaker. The latter serves the northern parts of Lysaker as well as the shopping center CC Vest. Service The line is owned by Kollektivtransportproduksjon and operated by Oslo Sporvognsdrift on contract with Ruter. The line is served using a mix of SL79 and SL95 trams, operating at a ten-minute headway. The services terminate at Bekkestua. The line is served by no. 13, that continues from Skøyen along the Skøyen line to the city center and onwards along the Sinsen Line to Grefsen. History Construction of the extension from Bekkestua to Haslum in 1922 In 1912, Kristiania Elektriske Sporvei started working on plans to extend the street tram Skøyen Line towards Bestum or Øraker. The application for the section from Skøyen to Lilleaker was sent in 1913 and concession was granted in July 1915. Construction began immediately, trial runs were made on 8 May 1919 and the line opened the following day. In 1917, two proposals were made for a suburban tram line further north. The southern proposal was to build the line as an extension of the Lilleaker Line. The line would go from Lilleaker and extend towards Jar and Nadderud to Haslum. The northern proposal was for an extension of the Røa Line (at the time called the Smestad Line) via Røa to Hosle, Haslum and Fleskum to Kolsås. The latter was essentially a combination of the current Røa and Kolsås Line. The two proposals caused local debate with people in western Bærum in general supporting the northern line and people in eastern Bærum supporting the southern line. An agreement was quickly reached with Kristiania Elektriske Sporvei (KES), that owned the Lilleaker Line. In 1921, the municipal council voted in favor of the southern line after rejecting a proposal to negotiate trackage rights with Holmenkolbanen. The main argument for the southern alternative was that the municipality would not have to pay any of the investment costs for the section of the line that would be localed within Aker. Class SS trams during trial runs in 1919 In 1924, KES' operations in Oslo were expropriated and became Oslo Sporveier. However, the Lilleaker Line was kept outside the expropriation. The expansion to Bærum was financed in part by the cash from the sale and in part from free land from the municipality. Concession from Lilleaker to Bekkestua was granted in 1922, and on 28 December the municipality voted to extend the line from Bekkestua to Haslum. The line to Bekkestua opened on 1 July 1924 and the extension to Hslum on 4 November. KES rebranded itself and became Bærumsbanen. The company bought twelve Class A trams with twelve trailers from Zypen & Charlier of Germany. After running along the Bærum Line to Skøyen, the trams continued along the Oslo Sporveier-owned Skøyen Line to Athenæum in the center of Oslo. The stations had a small building where there was a kiosk, telephone, ticket sale and freight handling. Class A tram on the line in 1935 The Bærum Line was extended to Kolsås on 1 January 1930. In 1924, one of the conditions for the concession was that the line was to be connected to the Common Tunnel of the Holenkollen Line. Oslo Municipality demanded that the company either turn its trams at Skøyen or allow the municipality to purchase the company cheap. On 1 October 1934, Bærumsbanen was bought by Oslo Sporveier and made a subsidiary. The two companies had a common executive management, but retained separate operations. At the same time, Aker Municipality's tram company Akersbanerne was left operating a single line east of the city center. In 1936, it was decided that Bærumsbanen would take over operation of this line, by operating the trams from the Kolsås Line through the city center to connect to the Østensjø Line. Operations started on 4 January 1937, and the line was marketed as the Østensjø–Bærum Line. Although Bærumsbanen took over Akersbanerne's three Class A trams, up to three units from Ekebergbanen were also leased. Gullfisk tram at Lilleaker in 1975 From 1937 to 1939, Oslo Sporveier received 46 Class B trams (the Gullfisk), of which half were transferred to Bærumsbanen and set to supplement the Class A. In 1939, construction of a connection from Jar to Sørbyhaugen on the Røa Line was started. When it opened on 15 June 1942, the section from Sørbyhaugen to Kolsås was designated the Kolsås Line, and the section from Jar to Skøyen was designated as the Lilleaker Line. A balloon loop was built at Jar, and the Lilleaker Line trams that served the Lilleaker Line could start turning there. This allowed for transfer between the two lines. In 1944, the ownership of rolling stock and all but two employees in Bærumsbanen were transferred to Oslo Sporveier. However, the ownership of the tracks and the formal operation rights remained with Bærumsbanen. At the end of the war in 1945, the line was in need of a major overhaul, in particular the overhead wires. Lack of materials and money caused the extraordinary maintenance to take four years. Limitations of freight were imposed in 1946, and were terminated the following year. At the same time, the Kolsås Line services were internally numbered 9, but it was first many years later that the number appeared on the destination signs and schedules. Until 1951, the line had had constant fares since 1939; a 27% fare increase in 1951 was not sufficient to cover the 170% cost increase in the same period. The following year, Oslo Sporveier's Gullfisk were transferred to Bærumsbanen and designated Class E. SL79 tram at Ullern in 2000 The Østensjø Line was closed to be converted to the metro standard on 18 June 1967, and from that day Line 9 only went from Jar to Oslo Central Station. From 1 July 1970, the conductors were gradually removed on the Class B and E trams. In 1971, Bærumsbanen was liquidated and ownership and all aspects of operation of the line was transferred to Oslo Sporveier. The Lilleaker Line was connected to the Ekeberg Line from 29 September 1974. Class B and E were used during regular operation, but supplemented with SM53 trams during rush hour. The section of the Skøyen Line from Skøyen to Thune was moved on 17 November 1981, and upgraded to light rail. This caused Skøyen Station to be moved a few blocks from the Norwegian State Railways' Skøyen Station. From 1982, the articulated SL79 trams were taken into use. Regular services during the 1980s and 1990s terminated at Jar, but night services operated all the way to Kolsås. In February 2009, the part of the line west of Lilleaker was closed due to upgrades on the Kolsås Line. A balloon loop was constructed at Lilleaker to allow all trams to turn there. During construction, only the bi-directional SL95 trams could operate on the Skøyen–Lilleaker section. During the high-frequency (10-minute) schedule, Skøyen–Lilleaker is served by a shuttle tram with a transfer at Skøyen. During the low-frequency (20 minute) schedule, SL95 trams operate the entire Line 13 without any transfers needed. The curtailing of the line temporarily closed eliminated Øraker Station, despite local protests. The tram company indicated that reopening of the station might be possible if funds are available.

Founded in October 1983 as quattro GmbH, it primarily specialises in producing high performance Audi cars and components, along with purchaser specified customisations. The company's former name was an homage to Audi's original four-wheel drive rally-inspired road car—the Audi Quattro. In 2016, the company was renamed Audi Sport GmbH. It is located in a site at Neckarsulm, near Stuttgart, in the German State of Baden-Württemberg. With over twenty years experience, their own development and manufacturing factories are based within the larger site of the now defunct German automotive maker (and Wankel pistonless rotary engine pioneer) NSU Motorenwerke AG (NSU), on what is now known as Audi's \\"aluminium plant\\", or aluminium site. Although \\"quattro GmbH\\" as a company may be relatively unknown, compared to its parent, Audi, its core products include the Audi RS4, the Audi RS6 and the Audi R8. Furthermore, it is a 'closed company', in that it does not sell its automobiles directly to the public via franchised outlets under its own brand name; instead, they are sold under the Audi marque. However, it does now sell 'quattro GmbH' branded lifestyle products and accessories via Audi franchised outlets and Audi Forum such as that located in the Allianz Arena on the northern outskirts of Munich, Germany. Business areas Audi Sport GmbH specialises in four 'key' areas, including the design, testing and production of specialist and high performance Audi automobiles, such as the Audi RS3, Audi RS4, Audi RS5, Audi RS6, Audi RS7, Audi RS Q3, Audi TTRS and the Audi R8. They also design and specify roadwheels, and design and produce sports suspension, and the specialist car body parts (such as front bumpers and splitters, side skirts, rear bumpers and diffusers, and rear spoilers) which are mainly used on the Audi \\"S line\\" trim specification available on most of the model range. =RS cars= The Audi RS cars have technology and performance comparable with high performance sports cars such as the Porsche 911. Being based on conventional saloon (sedan) or estate (station wagon) cars, RS models also retain the everyday comfort and practicality of regular mainstream models. They are some of the most powerful vehicles ever offered by Audi. quattro GmbH create, design, develop and produce all RS models in conjunction with parent, AUDI AG. The \\"RS\\" initials are taken from the – literally translated as \\"racing sport\\". RS is Audi's highest trim level, positioned above the \\"S\\" (\\"Sport\\") specification level of Audi's regular model range. RS cars are usually produced in limited numbers over a limited time scale (historically, nearing the end of the production run of a certain model, before a new evolution or generation of the same model), and pioneer some of Audi's latest and most advanced technology and engineering prowess; therefore, \\"RS\\" cars could be described as (and are often marketed via television advertising as) \\"halo vehicles\\". Whilst RS cars generally command a much higher purchase price, compared to their 'lesser' brethren, they also retain very high residual values too. =S line= \\"S line\\" badge in front grille S line is a trim specification that is offered on many Audi models. Whilst the individual S line parts and components are designed and manufactured by quattro GmbH, Audi \\"S line\\" cars are still manufactured in the same AUDI AG factories, on the same production lines as their related models with differing trim levels. Cars with \\"S line\\" trim should not be confused with high performance \\"S\\" and \\"RS\\" models. Audi cars with S line trim bear identical performance figures to their counterparts with SE or base trim levels, with the exception of the Audi Q7 S line with the 3.0 V6 TFSI petrol engines ( for standard, for S line). =Audi exclusive= quattro GmbH offers potential purchasers of new Audi cars the possibility of customising their new car beyond the scope of \\"conventional\\" options, to their own personal desires during the initial manufacturing process. This facility is called Audi exclusive, and extends to virtually all areas of the car. The customer may choose unique exterior paint, in any colour, as well as alloy wheels originally developed by quattro GmbH. For the interior, the upholstery can be finished in various grades and grains of leathers (including Nappa), in a choice of colours. These coloured leathers may also be applied to interior door coverings and rear parcel shelves. Headlining fabrics can be customised in colour, along with seat belt webbing. The interior can be finished with a wide selection of wooden trims, sourced from around the world, along with colour coordinated piping on the edges of tailored floor carpet mats. A range of in-car office equipment is also available. quattro GmbH first offered this service at the 1995 Frankfurt International Motor Show. =Audi lifestyle / Audi Accessories= From 1985, quattro GmbH have developed a range of Audi lifestyle products, known as Audi Accessories. These include mountain bikes and personal leather goods, such as briefcases, handbags, purses and wallets. Car production Audi A4 B7 DTM Edition, one of the cars produced by quattro GmbH quattro GmbH has historically only been able to produce one specific model at a time at its sole plant at Neckarsulm. Chronologically, the first quattro GmbH model produced was the Audi RS2 Avant, a joint venture between Porsche and quattro GmbH, from 1994–1996 (and actually built at Porsche's Zuffenhausen plant). After this initial joint venture, all subsequent cars have been solely (with the exception of the Audi TT RS) produced at Neckarsulm by quattro GmbH. The second car was the C4 S6 Plus, produced from April 1996 to July 1997. Third was the 2000–2001 B5 RS4 Avant quattro; fourth was the 2003 C5 RS6 quattro; fifth was the 2005 B7 A4 DTM Edition saloon. Sixth out of quattro GmbH was the 2006 B7 RS4 quattro, seventh out of quattro GmbH was the 2006 B7 S4 25 Quattro, the eighth was a special edition A4 S-Line with and additional options for local markets – for example the UK 'Special Edition' with black optics pack, ventilated cross-drilled front disc brakes, black exhaust pipes, two tone leather interior – and the Swedish 'TS' designation with ventilated cross-drilled front disc brakes, S4 chassis, sport seats and aluminum interior detailing, and as of 2009, the ninth and latest offering is the 2008 C6 RS6 5.0 TFSI quattro. In 2005 they built an Audi TT quattro sport with 176 kW The Audi R8 is built in a new and totally separate quattro GmbH plant at Neckarsulm. The latest Audi TT RS and the Audi RS3 are both notable departures from this Neckarsulm-only production tradition. Whilst the TT RS and RS3 were wholly designed, developed and engineered at Neckarsulm by quattro GmbH, they are manufactured alongside the non RS Audi models, with the TT RS being manufactured at Győr, Hungary, by AUDI AG subsidiary Audi Hungaria Motor Kft.ETKA quattro GmbH-produced cars from Neckarsulm can be identified by their specific 2nd and 3rd digit of the World Manufacturer Identifier section of the vehicles' Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) – quattro GmbH manufactured cars begin with 'WUA....', whereas cars produced by AUDI AG in Germany begin with 'WAU....'. =Audi R8= The Audi R8 two-seat mid-engined sports car was exclusively designed and developed and is produced by quattro GmbH. An old factory on the Audi Neckarsulm site was redeveloped, and €28millon was invested in the new R8 production line. Around 250 employees work on this car. The longitudinally orientated 4.2 litre Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI) V8 engine used in the R8, rated at and of torque, is shared from the B7 RS4 quattro, but modified to use a dry sump lubrication system and induction system. A subsequent V10 engined version of the R8 is also available, using a de-tuned version of their sister company's 5.2-litre FSI V10, used in the Lamborghini Gallardo LP560-4. This variant produces and of torque. Furthermore, quattro GmbH unveiled a diesel engined R8 concept, the \\"R8 V12 TDI\\" (later renamed \\"R8 TDI Le Mans\\"). This was to use a 6.0-litre V12 engine, utilising Volkswagen Group's long-established Turbocharged Direct Injection (TDI) turbodiesel technology. This engine was rated at and of torque. =Audi Q7 V12 TDI quattro= quattro GmbH has developed the most powerful diesel powered sport utility vehicle (SUV) in its class. The Audi Q7 V12 TDI quattro is fitted with a V12 Turbocharged Direct Injection (TDI) internal combustion engine. A world first, this all new diesel engine displaces 6.0 litres, generating a motive power output of (measured according to Directive 80/1269/EEC) at 4,000 rpm, and of torque at 1,750–3,000 rpm. This allows it to accelerate from in 5.5 seconds. Top speed is electronically limited to . quattro GmbH have developed this new engine using existing technology from Audi's Le Mans endurance racing programme – the Audi R15 TDI. Comparisons to other brands Audi Sport GmbH is related to Audi in a similar manner to other German car manufacturers' \\"performance divisions\\" – such as \\"Mercedes-AMG GmbH\\" and Mercedes-Benz, \\"BMW M GmbH\\" and BMW, \\"Volkswagen R GmbH\\" and Volkswagen, or \\"Opel Performance Center GmbH\\" and Opel. A similar operation called \\"Volkswagen Individual GmbH\\", founded February 2003, is provided for Audi's Volkswagen Group sister company Volkswagen Passenger Cars at Wolfsburg. Volkswagen Individual GmbH produce the Volkswagen \\"R\\" series of cars, including the Golf R32 and the latest Passat R36, and are also able to provide purchaser requested customisations under the \\"Volkswagen Individual\\" label, similar to \\"Audi exclusive\\", during the initial factory manufacturing process. This service is also offered routinely to purchasers of Volkswagen Passenger Cars 'flagship' models – the Phaeton and the Touareg, at their respective production plants.

Pedro de Oña grew up amid this ongoing conflict; he was born in what was then a small military post, in a territory largely controlled by Chile's indigenous peoples. His mother remarried with a man of considerable influence, thus allowing Pedro de Oña to study in Lima at the Real Colegio de San Martín and later, at the Universidad de San Marcos. He received his degree from the viceroy García Hurtado de Mendoza, 5th Marquis of Cañete, and in 1596 received his bachelor's degree in Lima. He studied various baroque and classical writers, and worked at various jobs in Peru.Pedro De Oña In 1596 he published Arauco domado. This epic poem, written in rhymed couplets, praises the military deeds of Hurtado de Mendoza. It appears that Hurtado de Mendoza, dissatisfied with how he was portrayed in La Araucana by Alonso de Ercilla y Zúñiga, commissioned a new work: De Oña’s.Memoria Chilena - Pedro de Oña: Arauco Domado - Presentación His models were Virgil’s Aeneid as well as Ercilla's work, although, while Ercilla praised the courage of the indigenous people, De Oña praises the courage of his patron Hurtado de Mendoza. The Arauco domado is a poem of 20 cantos that contain dramatic episodes, which include the Battle of Bío-Bío, the rebellion in Quito against the royal tax collectors, and the naval victory of the pirate Richarte Aquines (i.e. Richard Hawkins) over Don Beltrán de Castro y de la Cueva.Roberto González Echevarría, Enrique Pupo-Walker, The Cambridge History of Latin American Literature (Cambridge University Press, 1996), 139. Other cantos refer to dreams and prophecies, while some contain pastoral and erotic elements, such as the passage concerning Caupolicán and Fresia bathing in a fountain in a glade. In the poem, De Oña characterizes the Mapuches as savage and terrifying. Nevertheless, he provides information on their rites and customs, and those of other indigenous peoples. When his patron Hurtado de Mendoza departed from Peru, the viceroy’s enemies decided to harm Pedro de Oña’s career by banning Arauco domado and denouncing the writer for various writings that the archbishop of Lima, Pedro Muñiz, considered defamatory. De Oña also wrote the Temblor de Lima de 1609 (Lima, 1609), El Vasauro (Cuzco, 1635), and a sacred epic, the Ignacio de Cantabria (Seville, 1639). In his Apologético en favor de Don Luis de Góngora, Príncipe de los poetas lyricos de España: contra Manuel de Faria y Sousa, Cavallero portugués (1662), Juan de Espinosa Medrano refers to Pedro de Oña, among others, in his defense of Góngora.El Lunarejo: Identidad mestiza y crítica literaria When De Oña’s wife died, the poet was left with five children in his care and lived in poverty for the rest of his life.

He was a founder of Concord, Massachusetts and served it as clerk from 1635 to 1653 and helped negotiate its purchase from the Native American owners. Willard represented Concord in the Massachusetts General Court from 1636 to 1654, and was assistant and councillor from 1654 to 1676. Willard served as an advisor to the Nashaway Company which founded Lancaster, Massachusetts in the 1640s and 1650s, and he settled in Lancaster by 1660.https://yipp.yale.edu/bio/bibliography/willard-simon-1605-1676Lisa Brooks, Our Beloved Kin: A New History of King Philip's WarLisa Brooks (2018), pg. 110 https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0300196733 In 1651 Willard laid out 1,000 acres for settlement along the Assabet River which may have included parts of what is now Maynard, Massachusetts when a Native American leader, Tantamous (Old Jethro), defaulted on a mortgage for a debt due to Concord gunsmith, Herman Garrett, for an unpaid debt.

Also, when referring to laughter or a smile, it is \\"bitter, scornful, mocking\\". Hence, when referring to a person or a personal attribute, it is with bitterness, scorn or mockery. A form of wit or humour, being sardonic often involves expressing an uncomfortable truth in a clever and not necessarily malicious way, commonly with a degree of cynicism. Origin Both the concept and the etymology of the word, while being of uncertain origin, appear to stem from the Mediterranean island of Sardinia. The 10th-century Byzantine Greek encyclopedia Suda traces the word's earliest roots to the notion of grinning () in the face of danger, or curling one's lips back at evil. One explanation for the later alteration to its more familiar form and connection to laughter (supported by the Oxford English Dictionary) appears to stem from an ancient belief that ingesting the sardonion (σαρδόνιον) plant from Sardinia (Σαρδώ) would result in convulsions resembling laughter and, ultimately, death. In Theory and History of Folklore, Vladimir Propp discusses alleged examples of ritual laughter accompanying death and killing, all involving groups. These he characterized as sardonic laughter: > Among the very ancient people of Sardinia, who were called Sardi or Sardoni, > it was customary to kill old people. While killing their old people, the > Sardi laughed loudly. This is the origin of notorious sardonic laughter > (Eugen Fehrle, 1930). In light of our findings things begin to look > different. Laughter accompanies the passage from death to life; it creates > life and accompanies birth. Consequently, laughter accompanying killing > transforms death into a new birth, nullifies murder as such, and is an act > of piety that transforms death into a new life.Vladimir Propp, Theory and > History of Folklore: Ritual laughter in folklore, pp. 134-35. Anthology > edited by Anatoly Liberman (1984). A root form may first appear in Homer's Odyssey as the Ancient Greek sardánios, altered by influence of the word Sardonios (Σαρδονιος, \\"Sardinian\\"), originated from a Greek phrase which meant \\"to be sneered\\", \\"tearing of flesh\\" or for scornful laughter. From the evolved the , thence the , and ultimately the familiar English adjectival form, sardonic. In the English vernacular, it was recorded and utilized in the 1579 \\"The Shepheard’s Calendar\\". Risus sardonicus Risus sardonicus is an apparent smile on the face of those who are convulsing because of tetanus, or strychnine poisoning. From the Oxford English Dictionary, \\"A fixed, grin-like expression resulting from spasm of facial muscles, esp. in tetanus.\\" Also: > [Convulsion of the] facial muscles may cause a characteristic expression > called Risus sardonicus (from the Latin for scornful laughter) or Risus > caninus (from the Latin for doglike laughter or grinning). This facial > expression has also been observed among patients with tetanus. Risus > sardonicus causes a patient's eyebrows to rise, eyes to bulge, and mouth to > retract dramatically, resulting in what has been described as an evil- > looking grin.Holstege, C. et al., Criminal Poisoning: Clinical and Forensic > Perspectives, by Christopher Holstege, Thomas Neer, Gregory Saathoff, and > Brent Furbee, Jones & Bartlett Learning, 2010, p. 161. = Hemlock water dropwort = In 2009, scientists at the University of Eastern Piedmont in Italy claimed to have identified hemlock water dropwort (Oenanthe crocata) as the plant responsible for producing the sardonic grin. This plant is the candidate for the \\"sardonic herb\\", which was a neurotoxic plant used for the ritual killing of elderly people in pre-Roman Sardinia. When these people were unable to support themselves, they were intoxicated with this herb and then dropped from a high rock or beaten to death.News Scan Briefs: Killer Smile, Scientific American, August 2009 Ideas and usage Frank Herbert, from his first book of the series Dune, remarked:  See also  * Bittersweet * Euphemisms * Irony * Rapport * Roasting * Sarcasm * Schadenfreude * Self-parody  References  Definition, meaning, and social examples of the word Sardonic Sardonic meaning and usage example  External links  * Category:Greek words and phrases Category:Humour Category:Rhetoric ","title":"Sardonicism"},{"id":"14972355","text":"The United Left Front was an electoral alliance in West Bengal, India, formed ahead of the 1957 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election.

History Radio 702's success in Johannesburg, South Africa – in Primedia Broadcasting's stable of four radio stations – led Issie Kirsh, the founder and first chairperson, to seek to emulate this winning formula in Israel and Palestine. In 2004, Issie Kirsh met Raf Gangat, the former South African Representative to the Palestinian Authority, and the seed was planted. Three years later, after much research, groundwork and implementation, 93.6 RAM FM was born – a licensed radio station, broadcasting from Palestine into Israel and Jordan, with studios in Ramallah and Jerusalem with Gangat hosting one of the main shows 9@9 which gained popularity thanks to Raf's diplomatic experience and knowledge in the region. The Talk@10 was the main segment of the show and Palestinian and Israeli officials were hosted to discuss contentious issues. The Hot AC Music Format created a listenership of Palestinians, Israelis and Jordanians as well as a substantial number of foreign nationals who worked for Embassies, UN and international organizations and foreign press in the region. 93.6 RAM FM’s format comprised music, Middle East news on the hour, presenters from South Africa, Palestine, England and Australia. Its intent was to create a bridge between Palestinians and Israelis, providing a platform for both sides to discuss and listen to the other’s narrative and thereby create meaningful understanding. With Studios in Ramallah and Jerusalem, connected by microwave link, it employed state-of-the- art technology which is used by modern media today. Middle East Eyewitness News was ‘in touch, in tune and independent’. In order to maintain neutrality, the station played only English music and opted to air only commercials from multinational brands. Awards RAM FM was awarded two international prizes for the significant role it played in the region. The owner and chairman of the station in South Africa applauded the management's role in making the station a success which was reflected in the unprecedented increase in its listenership within a short period of time.

Originally established in 1948 as a single journal called Acta Crystallographica, there are now six independent Acta Crystallographica titles: *Acta Crystallographica Section A: Foundations and Advances *Acta Crystallographica Section B: Structural Science, Crystal Engineering and Materials *Acta Crystallographica Section C: Structural Chemistry *Acta Crystallographica Section D: Structural Biology *Acta Crystallographica Section E: Crystallographic Communications *Acta Crystallographica Section F: Structural Biology Communications Acta Crystallographica has been noted for the high quality of the papers that it produces, as well as the large impact that its papers have had on the field of crystallography. The current six journals form part of the journal portfolio of the IUCr, which is completed by the Journal of Applied Crystallography, the Journal of Synchrotron Radiation, the open-access IUCrJ and the open-access data publication IUCr Data. History Acta Crystallographica was established in conjunction with the foundation of the International Union of Crystallography in 1948. Both were established to maintain an international forum for crystallography after the Second World War had led to a loss of international subscription to, and the eventual nine-year closure of, the main pre-war crystallography journal, Zeitschrift für Kristallographie. The founding editor of Acta Crystallographica was P. P. Ewald, who wrote in the preface to the first issue A steady increase in the number of submitted papers led to the journal being split into Section A, covering fundamental and theoretical studies, and Section B, dedicated to reports of structures, in 1968, together with a new journal, the Journal of Applied Crystallography. In 1983, Section C, devoted to the crystal structures of small molecules, was added, with Section B now focusing on biological, chemical, mineralogical and metallurgical crystallography. The rapid expansion in biological crystallography led to the launch of Section D in 1993. The journals launched online versions in 1999, and in 2000 the journals began to provide electronic article submission and subscription access online. This was followed by the launch of an online-only journal, Section E, for brief reports of new small- molecule structures, in 2001; this journal became fully open access in 2008. A second online-only journal, Section F, dedicated to short reports of macromolecular structures and reports on their crystallization, followed in 2005. The IUCr moved to online-only publication for all its journals from 2014. Journals =Acta Crystallographica Section A: Foundations and Advances= Acta Crystallographica Section A: Foundations and Advances is the foundation on which the whole suite of IUCr crystallography journals are built, containing papers describing fundamental developments in crystallographic theory and practice.

Neuron. H-current: properties of a neuronal and network pacemaker. Vol. 21. pp 9-12. HCN channels are sometimes referred to as pacemaker channels because they help to generate rhythmic activity within groups of heart and brain cells. HCN channels are encoded by four genes (HCN1, 2, 3, 4) and are widely expressed throughout the heart and the central nervous system.Kaupp UB, Seifert R. Molecular diversity of pacemaker ion channels (2001) Annu Rev Physiol. 63:235-57. Review. The current through HCN channels, designated If or Ih, plays a key role in the control of cardiac and neuronal rhythmicity and is called the pacemaker current or \\"funny\\" current. Expression of single isoforms in heterologous systems such as human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and Xenopus oocytes yield homotetrameric channels able to generate ion currents with properties similar to those of the native If/Ih current, but with quantitative differences in the voltage-dependence, activation/deactivation kinetics and sensitivity to the nucleotide cyclic AMP (cAMP): HCN1 channels have a more positive threshold for activation, faster activation kinetics, and a lower sensitivity to cAMP, while HCN4 channels are slowly gating and strongly sensitive to cAMP. HCN2 and HCN3 have intermediate properties.  Structure  Human HCN1 channel tetramer Hyperpolarization- activated and cyclic nucleotide–gated (HCN) channels belong to the superfamily of voltage-gated K+ (Kv) and cyclic nucleotide–gated (CNG) channels. HCN channels are thought to consist of four either identical or non-identical subunits that are integrally embedded in the cell membrane to create an ion- conducting pore. Each subunit comprises six membrane-spanning (S1–6) domains which include a putative voltage sensor (S4) and a pore region between S5 and S6 carrying the GYG triplet signature of K+-permeable channels, and a cyclic nucleotide-binding domain (CNBD) in the C-terminus. HCN isoforms are highly conserved in their core transmembrane regions and cyclic nucleotide binding domain (80–90% identical), but diverge in their amino- and carboxy-terminal cytoplasmic regions. HCN channels are regulated by both intracellular and extracellular molecules, but most importantly, by cyclic nucleotides (cAMP, cGMP, cCMP). Binding of cyclic nucleotides lowers the threshold potential of HCN channels, thus activating them. cAMP is a primary agonist of HCN2 while cGMP and cCMP may also bind to it. All three, however, are potent agonists.  Cardiac function  HCN4 is the main isoform expressed in the sinoatrial node, but low levels of HCN1 and HCN2 have also been reported. The current through HCN channels, called the pacemaker current (If), plays a key role in the generation and modulation of cardiac rhythmicity, as they are responsible for the spontaneous depolarization in pacemaker action potentials in the heart. HCN4 isoforms are regulated by cCMP and cAMP and these molecules are agonists at If.  Function in the nervous system  All four HCN subunits are expressed in the brain. In addition to their proposed roles in pacemaking rhythmic or oscillatory activity, HCN channels may control the way that neurons respond to synaptic input. Initial studies suggest roles for HCN channels in sour taste, coordinated motor behavior and aspects of learning and memory. Clinically, there is evidence that HCN channels play roles in epilepsy and neuropathic pain. HCN channels have been shown to be important for activity-dependent mechanisms for olfactory sensory neuron growth. HCN1 and 2 channels have been found in dorsal root ganglia, basal ganglia, and the dendrites of neurons in the hippocampus. It has been found that human cortical neurons have particularly high amount of HCN1 channel expression in all layers. HCN channel trafficking along dendrites in the hippocampus of rats has shown that HCN channels are quickly shuttled to the surface in response to neural activity. HCN channels have also been observed in the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN), a respiratory control center that responds to chemical signals such as CO2 (reference needed). When HCN is inhibited, serotonin fails to stimulate chemoreceptors in the RTN, thus increasing respiratory activity. This illustrates a connection between HCN channels and respiratory regulation. Due to the complex nature of HCN channel regulation, as well as the complex interactions between multiple ion channels, HCN channels are fine-tuned to respond to certain thresholds and agonists. This complexity is believed to affect neural plasticity.

It was built by James Brydges, 1st Duke of Chandos, between 1713 and 1724 at a cost of £200,000 (equivalent to £ today). The house was razed in 1747 and its contents dispersed. The name \\"Cannons\\" is an obsolete spelling of \\"canons\\" and refers to the Augustinian canons of St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, which owned the estate before the English Reformation. Cannons was the focus of the first Duke's artistic patronage – patronage which led to his nickname \\"The Apollo of the Arts\\". Brydges filled Cannons with Old Masters and Grand Tour acquisitions, and also appointed Handel as resident house composer from 1717 to 1718. Such was the fame of Cannons that members of the public flocked to visit the estate in great numbers and Alexander Pope was unjustly accused of having represented the house as \\"Timon's Villa\\" in his Epistle of Taste (1731).Pope confided to Lord Burlington \\"that character of Timon is collected from twenty different absurditys and improprieties: and never was the picture of any one human creature\\"; quoted in James Lees-Milne, The Earls of Creation, :148. The error was compounded in William Hogarth's satirical engraving of Lord Burlington, as a mason's apprentice, carrying a hod to Alexander Pope, whitewashing a bust of Kent and incidentally bespattering Chandos (Lees-Milne, 108). The Cannons estate was acquired by Chandos in 1713 from the uncle of his first wife, Mary Lake. Mary's great-grandfather Sir Thomas Lake had acquired the manor of Great Stanmore in 1604. Following the first Duke's death in 1744, Cannons passed to his son Henry Brydges, 2nd Duke of Chandos. Due to the cost of building Cannons and significant losses to the family fortune in the South Sea Bubble there was little liquid capital in Henry's inheritance, so in 1747 he held a twelve-day demolition sale at Cannons which saw both the contents and the very structure of the house itself sold piecemeal leaving little more than a ruin barely thirty years after its inception. The subsequent villa built by William Hallett is now occupied by North London Collegiate School.  History  There is archaeological evidence the site was used in Roman times for brick and tile making. In mediaeval times the site was a part of the endowment of the Priory of St Bartholomew's which operated St Bartholomew's Hospital in London. This gave it the name Cannons, canon was an archaic term for certain orders of monks including the Augustinians of St Bartholomew's Priory. At the Dissolution of the Monasteries the land was sold into private hands in 1543. A large house was built during the 16th and 17th centuries at one point owned by Thomas Lake, James I's Chancellor of the Exchequer. James Brydges was an MP for Hereford who achieved the post of Paymaster General to the Forces. He retired in 1713 with a fortune of £600,000, worth £58,000,000 today, he had gained by speculation with the money in his care. Brydges had inherited Cannons from his first wife Mary who died in 1712. In 1713 he married his cousin Cassandra Willoughby and began to enlarge the house. Brydges took personal control of the project and it was the work of a string of architects and landscape gardeners, who changed as they fell into and out of favour. He used the house as a setting for his patronage of the arts stocking it with paintings, sculpture and holding opera performances. It was completed by 1720. Chesterfield House, London in 1747, itself demolished in 1937 Brydges was made Earl of Caernavon in 1714 and later became duke of Chandos. His fortunes were damaged by financial losses in the South Sea Bubble of 1720. However, when his wife died in 1735, he remarried a wealthy 43-year- old widow, Lady Lydia Davall, who had £40,000 to her name. Chandos died in 1744 and his debts were by then so great that his heirs had no choice but to sell the house and contents in a demolition auction of 1747. The architectural building adornments were sold off to other grand projects. The Palladian columns form the portico of the National Gallery in London. A more modest house was built on the site in 1760 by William Hallett who had acquired wealth through his skill at cabinet making. This was itself enlarged by a succession of owners, notably Dennis O’Kelly owner of the outstanding racehorse Eclipse. By 1896 the parkland had begun to be sold off as building plots. Sir Arthur du Cros of Dunlop Rubber became tenant in 1902 and bought it in 1911. He engaged the celebrated Arts and Crafts architect Charles Mallows to remodel and enlarge the building between 1905-1908. The exterior of the current building is largely his work. In 1929 the house was bought by the North London Collegiate School who still occupy it today. Part of the gardens remain as Canons Park in the care of the London Borough of Harrow.Canons Park, Friends of Canons Park, Harrow Council , 2016. Accessed 2016 The house gives its name to the modern local district, Canon's Park , which is largely built upon its parkland and is a wealthy north London suburb. This in turn gave its name to the Underground station of Canons Park on the Jubilee line. Architecture James Brydges (later 1st Duke of Chandos) and his family, 1713. Artist, Godfrey Kneller. Chandos remodelled the pre-existing Jacobean house built by Thomas Lake (which is believed to have been designed by John Thorpe). The new three-storey house took 10 years to complete and was designed as a square block with four new pedimented facades and a large internal courtyard. The Duke went through several architects beginning with William Talman in 1713 who produced twelve plans but was dismissed in 1714 before starting any building on the main house. Next was John James who designed the north and west ranges (and also rebuilt the local parish church, St Lawrence, Whitchurch, with a baroque interior). On advice from Sir John Vanbrugh the Duke appointed James Gibbs in 1715. Gibbs is known as an architect who worked in a baroque idiom but incorporated palladian elements. He designed the chapel (consecrated 29 August 1720) as well as the final designs for the four new facades. The designs for the interiors did not meet with approval from Vanbrugh who commented \\"The fronts v.fine... But the inside is of poor Invention\\" and Gibbs was dismissed in 1719. Cannons was completed under the supervision of the Duke's surveyors John Price and latterly Edward Shepard. A contemporary account from a 1722 visitor at the time that the finishing touches were being made to the interiors records: The Duke's constantly changing vision brought five different architects to it and though one of the last great Baroque houses Cannons also contributed to the development of Palladianism in England. Gardens The grounds of Cannons extended to and were renowned for their magnificence. There was a pleasure garden an orchard and a grand terrace opening on to a parterre containing gilded statues. The Basin, Canons Park Estate, today. When the Duke of Chandos developed the estate in the early part of the 18th century, this ornamental pond was constructed along the approach drive from the south-east so that visitors caught their first sight of the Canons Park mansion once they had negotiated it. James Brydges, 1st Duke of Chandos (1673-1744), portrait by John Vanderbank, painted in 1722 and showing the newly constructed Basin at Cannons in the background. Chandos had a water engineer of international fame in his household – his chaplain, the Rev John Theophilus Desaguliers, FRS. Desaguliers created a system of pipes of different materials and bores to feed the water features. In fact, he was better-known for his scientific expertise than his interest in his parishioners.http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucypanp/desaguliersletters.htm The letters of James Brydges Earl of Carnarvon and later Duke of Chandos (1674–1744) to John Theophilus Desaguliers (1683–1744) correspondence preserved at The Huntington Library, California The water gardens, which included a great basin, a canal and numerous ornamental fountains led Nicholas Hawksmoor to comment \\"I cannot but own that the water at Cannon's... is the main beauty of that situation and it cost him dear\\". Another FRS associated with the Cannons garden was Richard Bradley, a horticulturalist who was to become the first professor of botany at the University of Cambridge. Bradley, who dedicated a gardening book to the Duke, supplied plants for the gardens. Chandos, together with his head gardener Tilleman Bobart, oversaw changes at Cannons reflecting the eighteenth-century movement towards a more naturalistic style of landscape gardening. Some features from the original park survive, including two lakes, the Basin Lake and the Seven Acre Lake. English Heritage has included Canons Park on the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.This recognition is in spite of the fact that the eighteenth-century park survives in a fragmented and partial state – the register includes parks and gardens with a main phase of development prior to 1750 even when only a small part is still evident. Art and music Antonio Bellucci's ceiling paintings from the Cannons chapel, now in Great Witley Church, Worcestershire Chandos began collecting paintings before Cannons was built. Chandos, who had good contacts in the art market in the Netherlands, sometimes bought works unseen, relying on the judgement of his agents. One of the difficulties he faced in acquiring the best continental art was that the War of the Spanish Succession (1701–1714), which was a key factor in his great wealth, also made it more difficult to import art directly from Italy. Even so, his collection of Italian paintings included some of the great masters. Chandos also commissioned painters directly, for example, the portraitists Michael Dahl, Sir Godfrey Kneller and John Vanderbank, and the decorative painters Antonio Bellucci, Louis Laguerre and William Kent who worked on the interiors of the house. Chandos was a patron of the sculptors Grinling Gibbons and John Nost. Chandos maintained a musical establishment; some of the musicians are known to have doubled as household servants but even so, musical standards were very high. The music director for twenty years was the German composer Johann Christoph Pepusch. He wrote a number of pieces of church music for the Cannons chapel. The size of the musical establishment at Cannons declined in the 1720s in response to the family's losses in the South Sea Bubble, a financial crash which took place in 1720.The Cambridge Companion to Handel, Donald Burrows By far the most famous musician associated with Cannons is George Frideric Handel. He attracted the patronage of noblemen such as Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington, and he was based at Burlington House before becoming Cannons' resident composer from 1717 to 1718. It has been suggested that the move to Cannons was related to the fact that in 1717 there was reduced demand for his services in central London because operatic productions were experiencing a downturn. Chandos had a taste for Italianate music and in 1719 became a patron of Handel's opera company in London. At Cannons, as well as employing continental musicians as composers, he also engaged continental instrumentalists. The singers, on the other hand, seem to have been mainly English, rather than the highly trained and expensive Italians who were the stars of the London opera scene. Demolition and dispersal Grinling Gibbons' The Stoning of St Stephen The Brydges lost a significant part of their fortune when the South Sea Bubble burst and their finances never recovered. Following the death of the first Duke, the very fabric of Cannons, all its contents and every fixture and fitting were auctioned to satisfy debts. A twelve-day sale began on 16 June 1747 and the sale catalogue included works by Titian, Giorgione, Raphael and Guercino. Amongst the most notable paintings were Caravaggio's Boy Bitten by a Lizard (wrongly attributed to Guercino in the catalogue) which the National Gallery in London acquired in 1986, and Nicolas Poussin's The Choice of Hercules which was purchased at the sale by Henry Hoare for Stourhead, his house in Wiltshire, where it still hangs. Of the sculptures Grinling Gibbons' carved panel The Stoning of St Stephen is now in the Victoria and Albert Museum, and a statue claiming to be of George II by John van Nost is in Golden Square. Survey of London The portico, railings and marble staircase with bronze balustrade were bought by the 4th Earl of Chesterfield for his new London home, Chesterfield House, South Audley Street, which was built in 1749 but like Cannons is no longer standing having been demolished in 1937. Another statue modelled by C. Burchard in about 1716 and cast by John Van Nost, of George I, was moved to Leicester Square, where, after frequent vandalism, it was removed in 1872., p. 870. The rest of the house and contents were dispersed across the country and the location of much has been lost, however some substantial elements can still be seen, including the Ionic columns from the colonnade which some sources now place in front of the National Gallery in London. Elements of the chapel, in particular stained glass windows designed by Sebastiano Ricci and made by glass painter Joshua Price, along with Bellucci's ceiling paintingsTim Bridges Churches of Worcestershire Logaston Press, Herefordshire 2000 rev ed. 2005 p107 were purchased by Thomas, Lord Foley and installed by James Gibbs in the Church of Saint Michael and All Angels, Great Witley, Worcestershire. The chapel's organ was built by Abraham Jordan Jr, who with his father is credited with the invention of the swell box. There is some dispute as to where the instrument was moved, as some sources say it is identifiable as the organ in the church at Great Witley, whereas Holy Trinity, Gosport, claims to have some of the pipework. There is a tradition that the gates were removed to Trinity College, Oxford, but this is incorrect, for the College's two sets of gates both predate the demolition of Cannons and are well documented.Clare Hopkins, Trinity: 450 Years of an Oxford College Community (OUP, 2005), 170, 173. The estate itself was purchased by the cabinet maker William Hallett who in 1760 built a large villa on the site which today houses the North London Collegiate School, where part of the original temple can still be seen, and is known by the modern spelling, Canons. Hallett's villa was mentioned by John Byng, 5th Viscount Torrington, in 1788 as being of a more appropriate size for the location than Cannons: \\"the situation is too near London for such [former] display; being better suited for this present villa, sprung from the former demolition\\". In popular culture Caravaggio: Boy bitten by a lizard Such was the fame of the house that the Duke had to introduce crowd control measures – including a one-way system – to manage the large numbers of visitors who flocked to the estate. Cannons was featured in early travel guides including a 1725 travelogue by Daniel Defoe where he described Cannons' extravagance thus: A few years later Alexander Pope was seen as satirising Cannons in his poem Of Taste (1731), which ridicules the villa of an aristocrat called \\"Timon\\" and includes the lines: Timon, like Chandos, is a patron of the painter Louis Laguerre and listens to elaborate music in his chapel. After adverse comment, including a caricature by William Hogarth of Pope splattering Chandos' carriage, the poet apologised to the Duke, denying that any comparison with Cannons was intended, but it has been suggested that Pope could have anticipated that some people would see a connection. Within a few years another point of comparison had emerged – Pope had prophesied the demolition of Timon's villa.

M. Fields price label attached to a purseJ.M. Fields was a discount department store chain based in Salem, Massachusetts. The chain expanded rapidly in the early 1960s from a regional New England enterprise, opening stores along the entire eastern seaboard from Maine to Florida. Food Fair Corporation purchased the growing J.M. Fields business in 1961, and in 1965 the home office was moved from Boston to Food Fair corporate headquarters in Philadelphia. The original name of these stores was Enterprise Stores in the early 1900s. The chain was founded by Phillip Feldman of Massachusetts and his partner Samuel Glass. The name J. M. Fields came about when his son, Joseph M. Feldman, decided to use a name not aligned with any political, cultural, religious, or country culture. Joseph took over the stores in the early 1950s along with Hy Glass and George Glass. They saw the need for expansion. By 1961, there were approximately fifty stores. Most of these newer stores were built around large parking lots, among the first of their kind, similar to today's popular shopping configurations. Most new J.M. Fields stores were built adjacent to Food Fair stores, and the two were in fact connected, making J.M. Fields the first true \\"supercenter\\" of its time. Customers could walk from the department store directly into the grocery store without having to go outside. J.M.

The album marks a radical stylistic change, with the band abandoning their previous hardcore punk style for a softer, and more accessible glam metal sound. The band split up in 1986, shortly after the album's release, but would end up reforming in 1990. Content The album sees the band move away from their previous style, by turning towards heavy metal, and particularly to a softer and more accessible glam metal sound. Vocalist Kelvin \\"Cal\\" Morris also switched from his previous shouting vocals to falsetto ones for this album. Morris later blamed his rediscovery of Led Zeppelin for this decision. The tempos also became much slower, and a higher-quality sound took place in the recording. In order to promote the album, Discharge started the Grave New World tour in the UK, USA and Canada, but it would soon prove to be unsuccessful, and even disastrous for the band. By the time the group were playing in New York City, the fans were so outraged that the concert nearly turned into a riot. For instance, Bad Brains frontman H.R., got onto a balcony and started dumping ice on the musicians while they were playing. The album soon turned out to be a commercial failure. Discharge disbanded shortly after the tour. Critical reception The album received mostly mixed to negative reviews from professional music critics; AllMusic's Eduardo Rivadavia called it a \\"baffling and disheartening fall from grace\\" for the band, and also remarked that \\"it really might as well been credited to a different band.\\" Track listing #\\"Grave New World\\" - 4:10 #\\"In Love Believe\\" - 4:54 #\\"D.Y.T. / A.Y.F.\\" - 4:08 #\\"We Dare Speak (A Moment Only)\\" - 5:42 #\\"Time Is Kind\\" - 4:17 #\\"Sleep in Hope\\" - 5:54 #\\"The Downward Spiral\\" - 15:09 Personnel *Kelvin \\"Cal\\" Morris – vocals *Garry Moloney – drums *Roy Rainy Wainright - Bass *Stephen \\"Fish\\" Brookes – rhythm guitar References Category:1986 albums Category:Discharge (band) albums Category:Glam metal albums ","title":"Grave New World (Discharge album)"},{"id":"14972990","text":"Kilberry () is a village in County Kildare, Ireland.

Carmen Electra hosted the show, while other celebrities to appear on the program included pro-wrestling manager Jimmy \\"Mouth of the South\\" Hart, as well as adult entertainment star Mary Carey. Pay-per-views feature female wrestlers wrestling both clothed and in the nude. In November 2007, Electra announced a lawsuit against the NWWL for, among other things, breach of contract and failure to pay money that she claimed was still due to her. In response, NWWL owner Howard Mann revealed that he would seek damages for defamation, slander and malicious persecution. In late 2007, the NWWL launched a website where their nude wrestling matches were available for download.

The Medical Renaissance, from 1400 to 1700 CE, is the period of progress in European medical knowledge, and a renewed interest in the ideas of the ancient Greek and Roman civilizations, along with Arabic-Persian medicine, after the Latin translation movement. Such medical discoveries during the Medical Renaissance are credited with paving the way for modern medicine.  Background  De Re Anatomica by Realdo Colombo, 1572 The Medical Renaissance began just as the original Renaissance did, in the early 16th century. Medical researchers continued their Renaissance-evoked practices into the late 17th century. Progress made during the Medical Renaissance depended on several factors.OCR GCSE: Medicine Through TimeParragon, World History Encyclopedia Printed books based on movable type, adopted in Europe from the middle of the 15th century, allowed the diffusion of medical ideas and anatomical diagrams. Linacre, Erasmus, Leonicello and Sylvius are among the list of the first scholars most credited for the starting of the Medical Renaissance. Following after is Andreas Vesalius's publication of De humani corporis fabrica (On the Fabric of the Human body) in 1543. Better knowledge of the original writings of Galen in particular, developed into the learned medicine tradition through the more open attitudes of Renaissance humanism. Church control of the teachings of the medical profession and universities diminished, and dissection was more often possible.  Individuals  = Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519) = This drawing by Leonardo da Vinci of a foetus in the womb is one of many detailed anatomical drawings by the artist Leonardo da Vinci made many contributions in the fields of science and technology. His research centered around his desire to learn more about how the human brain processes visual and sensory information and how that connects to the soul. Though his artwork was widely observed before, some of his original research was not made public until the 20th century. Some of da Vinci's research involved studying vision. He believed that visual information entered the body through the eye, then continued by sending nerve impulses through the optic nerve, and eventually reaching the soul. Da Vinci subscribed to the ancient notion that the soul was housed in the brain. He did research on the role of the spinal cord in humans by studying frogs. He noted that as soon as the frogs medulla of the spine is broken, the frog would die. This led him to believe that the spine is the basis for the sense of touch, cause of movement, and the origin of nerves. As a result of his studies on the spinal cord, he also came to the conclusion that all peripheral nerves begin from the spinal cord. Da Vinci also did some research on the sense of smell. He is credited with being the first to define the olfactory nerve as one of the cranial nerves. Leonardo da Vinci made his anatomical sketches based on observing and dissecting 30 cadavers. His sketches were very detailed and included organs, muscles of superior extremity, the hand, and the skull. Leonardo was well known for his three- dimensional drawings. His anatomical drawings were not found until 380 years after his death. = Ambroise Paré (1510–1590) = Paré was a French surgeon, anatomist and an inventor of surgical instruments. He was a military surgeon during the French campaigns in Italy of 1533–36. It was here that, having run out of boiling oil (which was the accepted way of treating firearm wounds), Paré turned to an ancient Roman remedy: turpentine, egg yolk and oil of roses. He applied it to the wounds and found that it relieved pain and sealed the wound effectively. Paré also introduced the ligatures of arteries; silk threads would be used to tie up the arteries of amputated limbs to try to stop the bleeding. As antiseptics had not yet been invented this method led to an increased fatality rate and was abandoned by medical professionals of the time. Additionally, Paré set up a school for midwives in Paris and designed artificial limbs. = Andreas Vesalius (1514–1564) = Illustration of the structure of the nervous system from De humani corporis fabrica by Vesalius Vesalius was a Flemish-born anatomist whose dissections of the human body helped to rectify the misconceptions made in Ancient Times, particularly by Galen, who (for religious reasons) had been able only to study animals such as dogs and monkeys. He wrote many books on anatomy from his observations; his best-known work was De humani corporis fabrica, published in 1543, which contained detailed drawings of the human body posed as if alive.BBC - History - Andreas Vesalius ( 1514–1564) This book contained many different anatomic sketches that he made upon examining and dissecting cadavers. These sketches were a combination of Italian and Gothic art. Vesalius identified the anatomical errors in Galen's findings and challenged the academic world. He changed how human anatomy was viewed and researched and is considered a legacy in the medical world. Nicolaus Copernicus published his book on planetary motion in 1543, one month before Vesalius published his work on anatomy. The work by Copernicus overturned the medieval belief that the earth lay at the center of the universe, and the work by Vesalius overturned the old authorities about the structure of the human body. In 1543, these two separate books fostered a change in understanding of the place of mankind within the macrocosmic structure of the universe and the microcosmic structure of the human body. = William Harvey (1578–1657) = William Harvey was an English medical doctor-physicist, known for his contributions in heart and blood movement. William Harvey fully believed all medical knowledge should be universal, and he made this his works goal. Accomplished historians credit him for his boldness in his experimental work and his everlasting eagerness to implement modern practice. Although not the first to propose pulmonary circulation (Ibn al-Nafis, Michael Servetus and Realdo Colombo preceded him), he is credited as the first person in the Western world to give quantitative arguments for the circulation of blood around the body.Spotlight Science 9 (GCSE Science Text Book) William Harvey's extensive work on the body's circulation can be found in the written work titles, \\"The Motu Cordis\\".This work opens up with clear definitions of anatomy as well as types of anatomy which clearly outlined a universal meaning of these words for various Renaissance physicians. Anatomy, as defined by William Harvey is, \\"the faculty that by ocular inspection and dissection [grasps] the uses and actions of the parts.\\" In other words, to be able to identify the actions or roles each part of the body plays in the overall function of the body by dissection, followed by visual identification. These were the foundation for the further research on the heart and blood vessels.Kids Work! > History of Medicine = Hieronymus Fabricius (1537–1619) = Hieronymus Fabricius is an anatomist and surgeon that prepared a human and animal anatomy atlas and these illustrations were used in his work, Tabulae Pictae. This work includes illustrations from many different artists and Fabricius is credited for providing a turning point in anatomical illustration. Fabricius' illustrations were of natural size and natural colors. After Fabricius' death, Tabulae Pictae disappeared and wasn't again discovered until 1909. Fabricus focused on the human brain and the fissures that are inside of the brain. In Tabulae Pictae, he described the cerebral fissure that separates the temporal lobe from the frontal lobe. He also studied veins and was the first to discover the valves inside of veins.

COMPASS uses pairs of in-road sensors to detect the speed and density of traffic flow. This data is fed to a central computer at the MTO Downsview office and analyzed by operators, who also view the feeds of traffic cameras placed along the highways. Changeable Message Signs (CMS) then display messages to motorists on the highways, advising them of upcoming collisions, closures, detours and traffic flow. Algorithms The primary algorithm used by the Ministry is known as the McMaster algorithm, designed by Professor Fred Hall of McMaster University, in Hamilton, Ontario. Incident Detection algorithms have also been widely used throughout the COMPASS-enabled area. Research on new algorithm developments and evaluations is performed at the ITS Centre and Testbed (ICAT), at the Civil Engineering department of the University of Toronto.

False alarms A false alarm for incident detection is not only highly undesirable, but seriously damages the confidence in the detection system. Therefore, a near 100% alarm accuracy is needed. This does not mean that 100% traffic parameter accuracy is required from the traffic sensors; however, the logical commands that analyze the change in traffic parameters need to be selected carefully in order to minimize the probability of false alarms yet detect all major incidents as well as a high percentage of all other incidents. Most importantly, confirmation of incident and evaluation of incident type by manual inspection of a video camera screen is probably the most significant incident detection technique.

In mathematics, a toroid is a surface of revolution with a hole in the middle, like a doughnut, forming a solid body. The axis of revolution passes through the hole and so does not intersect the surface. For example, when a rectangle is rotated around an axis parallel to one of its edges, then a hollow rectangle-section ring is produced. If the revolved figure is a circle, then the object is called a torus. The term toroid is also used to describe a toroidal polyhedron. In this context a toroid need not be circular and may have any number of holes. A g-holed toroid can be seen as approximating the surface of a torus having a topological genus, g, of 1 or greater.

The PIFRC led one of the most massive and militant political campaigns in the history of West Bengal. The PIFRC demanded total price controls, immediate redistribution of state lands and confiscations without compensation of excessive private lands owned by landlords. The tactics of PIFRC included scouting for hidden rice storages and forced sales of confiscated rice.M.V.S. Koteswara Rao. Communist Parties and United Front — Experience in Kerala and West Bengal. Hyderabad: Prajasakti Book House, 2003. p. 219. August–September 1959 The PIFRC stepped up its agitations in August 1959. The organization put forward August 20, 1959 as the date to initiate mass resistance to force the state government either to accept these demands or to resign. In mid-1959, 35 prominent organisers of PIFRC were put under preventive detention. The detainees includes seven members of the legislative assembly.Bayley, David H.. The Indian Experience with Preventive Detention, in Pacific Affairs, Vol. 35, No. 2. (Summer, 1962), pp. 99-115. The movement reached its peak as a general strike was organised in Calcutta and surrounding districts in August–September 1959. The strike paralysed the entire city and its adjoining districts. On August 31, 1959, more than 20 demonstrators were killed by police bullets. Aftermath When the state government accepted the demands of PIFRC, the campaign was called off. In total, 39 people were killed during the agitations. 12 845 persons had been arrested, out of them 200 CPI leaders and 50 leaders of other left parties. Prominent communist leaders, like Jyoti Basu, had gone underground to escape arrest. In memory of those killed on August 31, 1959, left parties in Kolkata commemorate August 31 as 'Martyr's Day'. Impact inside CPI Marcus Franda claims that the 1959 food movement affected the internal debates with the CPI in West Bengal. According to him, the militant campaign against the Congress state government was used by the leftist, anti-Congress sectors within the party to subdue those sectors that sought tactical cooperation with Congress. The thesis that the food movement was divisive to the party was also put forward by The Statesman at the time.M.V.S. Koteswara Rao.

Poor graduated at Phillips Academy, Andover in 1805 and Dartmouth in 1811, and at Andover Theological Seminary in 1814 at the age of twenty-five. He was ordained in the Presbyterian Church at Newburyport, Massachusetts in June 1815. He married Susan Bulfinch of Salem, Massachusetts on October 9, 1815 and two weeks after their wedding left for Ceylon on October 23, 1815. He visited with Rev. William Bentley of Salem, a great linguist, who was not impressed with Poor's intentions or abilities. The Poors were accompanied by two more missionary couples James Richards and his wife, as well as Benjamin C. Meigs and his wife and a young bachelor clergyman named Edward Warren. They arrived in Colombo on March 22, 1816 and moved to the Jaffna Peninsula thereafter. The Poors and Edward Warren settled in Tellippalai on 16 October 1816.

Though the American missionaries came with dedication and fanaticism to spread Christianity, they did not confine themselves strictly and fully to evangelism alone; they were keen to impart a liberal education. Immediately after landing in Colombo in 1813 Rev. Samuel Newell got a charter from the British governor to impart a primary education service to the public in the parched north. They were forbidden to engage in higher education. But, in contrast to the American missionaries, the Methodist missionaries, stationed in the Jaffna fort, took about four years to comprehend that they could not convert natives to Christianity without schools and in 1817 Rev. James Lynch applied for permissionIn 1817, the Chairman, Rev James Lynch reported that \\"it would not be easy to find congregations without schools\\". There was a good deal of anxiety among supporters at home about the plan proposed by Mr. Lynch. However, the Home Committee gave its blessings to this project and soon schools were established in many places. to their Head Office in England to establish schools. But Poor was able to commence his education service at Tellippalai without any impediment in 1816. On 9 December 1816, Poor founded the ‘Common Free School’ which is currently known as Union College, Tellippalai in the ‘Dutch Hall’ that had been infested with poisonous serpents when Rev. Samuel Newel stepped into the compound in 1813. ‘The Common Free School’ was the first English school \\"At Tillipally [Tellippalai], the repairs were in such forwardness that Messrs.

The school started with six students. The first student Samuel Lochester completed his studies in 1828 and got an appointment as a teacher in the same school. Also, Poor was the first principal to admit girls and dalith students to a school. Among the five girls first admitted to the school, one Miranda Sellathurai was from the dalith class. In 1821 the total number on roll was 11 boys and 3 girls. Poor began to preach through an interpreter, but his progress in Tamil was so rapid that he spoke the language freely in less than a year. His wife Susan died at Tellippalai on May 7, 1821, after giving birth to one son and two daughters. Of the other three missionary colleagues, Edward Warren who was of fragile health, died in South Africa after leaving Colombo in April 1818. While at Tellippalai , he treated sick people and taught not only English but also the Tamil language to the natives. James Richard, who accompanied Warren to Cape Town, remained there until Nov.25, 1818 and returned to Jaffna. He survived for three more years, and died on August 3, 1822. Poor then married Ann Knight of England, on January 21, 1823. Poor moved to Vaddukoddai where he founded a boarding school for boys. This school became an important educational centre for the entire region, and succeeded in sending out well-trained teachers and Bishops to schools and churches which is currently known as Jaffna College . He was given the degree of D. D. by Dartmouth in 1835. He was transferred to Madurai, India in 1836, where he founded thirty-seven schools that he visited in succession, and frequently addressed from horse-back to crowds of adult natives. He returned to his original station at Tellippalai in 1841. In 1848 he visited the United States where he created a profound impression with his able and eloquent advocacy of the cause of missions. Poor returned to Jaffna again in 1850 and continued his work at Manipay until he fell a victim to the cholera epidemic which struck the peninsula disastrously in 1855. Poor had performed a noble service to Tellippalai in the fields of English education, the Tamil language and social advancement; he deserves to be celebrated in a grand way, if not possible annually, at least once a century.

The magnetic field tended to escape from the core at the sharp bends. Toroidal inductors and transformers are inductors and transformers which use magnetic cores with a toroidal (ring or donut) shape. They are passive electronic components, consisting of a circular ring or donut shaped magnetic core of ferromagnetic material such as laminated iron, iron powder, or ferrite, around which wire is wound. Although in the past, closed-core inductors and transformers often used cores with a square shape, the use of toroidal-shaped cores has increased greatly because of their superior electrical performance. The advantage of the toroidal shape is that, due to its symmetry, the amount of magnetic flux that escapes outside the core (leakage flux) is low, therefore it is more efficient and thus radiates less electromagnetic interference (EMI). Toroidal inductors and transformers are used in a wide range of electronic circuits: power supplies, inverters, and amplifiers, which in turn are used in the vast majority of electrical equipment: TVs, radios, computers, and audio systems. Advantages of toroidal windings In general, a toroidal inductor/transformer is more compact than other shaped cores because they are made of fewer materials and include a centering washer, nuts, and bolts resulting in up to a 50% lighter weight design. This is especially the case for power devices. Because the toroid is a closed-loop core it will have a higher magnetic field and thus higher inductance and Q factor than an inductor of the same mass with a straight core (solenoid coils). This is because most of the magnetic field is contained within the core. By comparison, with an inductor with a straight core, the magnetic field emerging from one end of the core has a long path through air to enter the other end. In addition, because the windings are relatively short and wound in a closed magnetic field, a toroidal transformer will have a lower secondary impedance which will increase efficiency, electrical performance and reduce effects such as distortion and fringing. Due to the symmetry of a toroid, little magnetic flux escapes from the core (leakage flux). Thus a toroidal inductor/transformer, radiates less electromagnetic interference (EMI) to adjacent circuits and is an ideal choice for highly concentrated environments. Manufacturers have adopted toroidal coils in recent years to comply with increasingly strict international standards limiting the amount of electromagnetic field consumer electronics can produce. Total B field confinement by toroidal inductors In some circumstance, the current in the winding of a toroidal inductor contributes only to the B field inside the windings and makes no contribution to the magnetic B field outside of the windings. This is a consequence of symmetry and Ampère's circuital law. =Sufficient conditions for total internal confinement of the B field= {  thumb400pxFig. 1. Coordinate system. The Z axis is the nominal axis of symmetry. The X axis chosen arbitrarily to line up with the starting point of the winding. ρ is called the radial direction. θ is called the circumferential direction.  Fig. 2. An axially symmetric toroidal inductor with no circumferential current. } The absence of circumferential current (the path of circumferential current is indicated by the red arrow in figure 3 of this section) and the axially symmetric layout of the conductors and magnetic materials are sufficient conditions for total internal confinement of the B field. (Some authors prefer to use the H field). Because of the symmetry, the lines of B flux must form circles of constant intensity centered on the axis of symmetry. The only lines of B flux that encircle any current are those that are inside the toroidal winding. Therefore, from Ampere's circuital law, the intensity of the B field must be zero outside the windings. Fig. 3. Toroidal inductor with circumferential current Figure 3 of this section shows the most common toroidal winding. It fails both requirements for total B field confinement. Looking out from the axis, sometimes the winding is on the inside of the core and sometimes it is on the outside of the core. It is not axially symmetric in the near region. However, at points a distance of several times the winding spacing, the toroid does look symmetric. There is still the problem of the circumferential current. No matter how many times the winding encircles the core and no matter how thin the wire, this toroidal inductor will still include a one coil loop in the plane of the toroid. This winding will also produce and be susceptible to an E field in the plane of the inductor. Figures 4-6 show different ways to neutralize the circumferential current. Figure 4 is the simplest and has the advantage that the return wire can be added after the inductor is bought or built. {  Fig. 4. Circumferential current countered with a return wire. The wire is white and runs between the outer rim of the inductor and the outer portion of the winding.  Fig. 5. Circumferential current countered with a return winding.  Fig. 6. Circumferential current countered with a split return winding. } =E field in the plane of the toroid= {  Fig. 7. Simple toroid and the E-field produced. ±100 Volt excitation assumed.  Fig. 8. Voltage distribution with return winding. ±100 Volt excitation assumed. } There will be a distribution of potential along the winding. This can lead to an E-Field in the plane of the toroid and also a susceptibility to an E field in the plane of the toroid as shown in figure 7. This can be mitigated by using a return winding as shown on figure 8. With this winding, each place the winding crosses itself, the two parts will be at equal and opposite polarity which substantially reduces the E field generated in the plane. =Toroidal inductor/transformer and magnetic vector potential= Showing the development of the magnetic vector potential around a symmetric toroidal inductor. See Feynman chapter 14 and 15 for a general discussion of magnetic vector potential. See Feynman page 15-11 for a diagram of the magnetic vector potential around a long thin solenoid which also exhibits total internal confinement of the B field, at least in the infinite limit. The A field is accurate when using the assumption bf{A} = 0. This would be true under the following assumptions: * 1. the Coulomb gauge is used * 2. the Lorenz gauge is used and there is no distribution of charge, \\\\rho = 0 \\\\, * 3. the Lorenz gauge is used and zero frequency is assumed * 4. the Lorenz gauge is used and a non-zero frequency that is low enough to neglect \\\\frac{1}{c^2}\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\phi}{\\\\partial t} is assumed. Number 4 will be presumed for the rest of this section and may be referred to the \\"quasi-static condition\\". Although the axially symmetric toroidal inductor with no circumferential current totally confines the B field within the windings, the A field (magnetic vector potential) is not confined. Arrow #1 in the picture depicts the vector potential on the axis of symmetry. Radial current sections a and b are equal distances from the axis but pointed in opposite directions, so they will cancel. Likewise segments c and d cancel. In fact all the radial current segments cancel. The situation for axial currents is different. The axial current on the outside of the toroid is pointed down and the axial current on the inside of the toroid is pointed up. Each axial current segment on the outside of the toroid can be matched with an equal but oppositely directed segment on the inside of the toroid. The segments on the inside are closer than the segments on the outside to the axis, therefore there is a net upward component of the A field along the axis of symmetry. Representing the magnetic vector potential (A), magnetic flux (B), and current density (j) fields around a toroidal inductor of circular cross section. Thicker lines indicate field lines of higher average intensity. Circles in cross section of the core represent B flux coming out of the picture. Plus signs on the other cross section of the core represent B flux going into the picture. Div A = 0 has been assumed. Since the equations abla \\\\times \\\\mathbf{A} = \\\\mathbf{B} \\\\ , and abla \\\\times \\\\mathbf{B} = \\\\mu_0\\\\mathbf{j} \\\\ (assuming quasi-static conditions, i.e. \\\\frac{\\\\partial E}{\\\\partial t}\\\\rightarrow 0 ) have the same form, then the lines and contours of A relate to B like the lines and contours of B relate to j. Thus, a depiction of the A field around a loop of B flux (as would be produced in a toroidal inductor) is qualitatively the same as the B field around a loop of current. The figure to the left is an artist's depiction of the A field around a toroidal inductor. The thicker lines indicate paths of higher average intensity (shorter paths have higher intensity so that the path integral is the same). The lines are just drawn to look good and impart general look of the A field. =Toroidal transformer action in the presence of total B field confinement= The E and B fields can be computed from the A and \\\\phi \\\\, (scalar electric potential) fields :\\\\mathbf{B} = abla \\\\times \\\\mathbf{A}. and :\\\\mathbf{E} = - abla \\\\phi - \\\\frac { \\\\partial \\\\mathbf{A} } { \\\\partial t } and so even if the region outside the windings is devoid of B field, it is filled with non-zero E field. : The quantity \\\\frac { \\\\partial \\\\mathbf{A} } { \\\\partial t } is responsible for the desirable magnetic field coupling between primary and secondary while the quantity abla \\\\phi \\\\, is responsible for the undesirable electric field coupling between primary and secondary. Transformer designers attempt to minimize the electric field coupling. For the rest of this section, abla \\\\phi \\\\, will assumed to be zero unless otherwise specified. Stokes theorem applies, so that the path integral of A is equal to the enclosed B flux, just as the path integral B is equal to a constant times the enclosed current The path integral of E along the secondary winding gives the secondary's induced EMF (Electro-Motive Force). ::\\\\mathbf{EMF} = \\\\oint_{path} \\\\mathbf{E} \\\\cdot {\\\\rm d}l = -\\\\oint_{path} \\\\frac { \\\\partial \\\\mathbf{A} } { \\\\partial t } \\\\cdot {\\\\rm d}l = -\\\\frac { \\\\partial } { \\\\partial t } \\\\oint_{path} \\\\mathbf{A}\\\\cdot {\\\\rm d}l = -\\\\frac { \\\\partial } { \\\\partial t } \\\\int_{surface} \\\\mathbf{B}\\\\cdot {\\\\rm d}s which says the EMF is equal to the time rate of change of the B flux enclosed by the winding, which is the usual result. =Toroidal transformer Poynting vector coupling from primary to secondary in the presence of total B field confinement= In this figure, blue dots indicate where B flux from the primary current comes out of the picture and plus signs indicate where it goes into the picture. Explanation of the figure This figure shows the half section of a toroidal transformer. Quasi-static conditions are assumed, so the phase of each field is everywhere the same. The transformer, its windings and all things are distributed symmetrically about the axis of symmetry. The windings are such that there is no circumferential current. The requirements are met for full internal confinement of the B field due to the primary current. The core and primary winding are represented by the gray-brown torus. The primary winding is not shown, but the current in the winding at the cross section surface is shown as gold (or orange) ellipses. The B field caused by the primary current is entirely confined to the region enclosed by the primary winding (i.e. the core). Blue dots on the left hand cross section indicate that lines of B flux in the core come out of the left hand cross section. On the other cross section, blue plus signs indicate that the B flux enters there. The E field sourced from the primary currents is shown as green ellipses. The secondary winding is shown as a brown line coming directly down the axis of symmetry. In normal practice, the two ends of the secondary are connected together with a long wire that stays well away from the torus, but to maintain the absolute axial symmetry, the entire apparatus is envisioned as being inside a perfectly conductive sphere with the secondary wire \\"grounded\\" to the inside of the sphere at each end. The secondary is made of resistance wire, so there is no separate load. The E field along the secondary causes current in the secondary (yellow arrows) which causes a B field around the secondary (shown as blue ellipses). This B field fills space, including inside the transformer core, so in the end, there is continuous non-zero B field from the primary to the secondary, if the secondary is not open circuited. The cross product of the E field (sourced from primary currents) and the B field (sourced from the secondary currents) forms the Poynting vector which points from the primary toward the secondary.

Its church is across the road from Tri-Valley Central School. In 1979 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. Five buildings are located on its 20 acres (8 ha). The centerpiece of the district is the Grahamsville Reformed Church, which dates originally to the 1840s. In 1874 it was expanded and a cemetery was added. An 1847 boarding house, also within the district, now serves as a gallery for a local artist. History The area of today's Grahamsville had initially been settled during the colonial era, but raids by Loyalists and their Indian allies killed or drove them away during the Revolution. So, after independence, the landowners of the Hardenbergh Patent invited tenants to settle in the area, named after an officer who led a unit massacred in the area, once again. Note: This includes and Accompanying six photographs The first known house in Grahamsville dates to 1788. The minimal farming opportunities in the region were supplemented by lumber, which the Catskills had in abundance, and soon that business picked up. In 1813 the town of Neversink raised taxes to build a road (now Route 55) from the Neversink River (now dammed to create Neversink Reservoir) to more-established routes at Wawarsing in Ulster County, to the east. The Marenius Dayton House, an impressive Greek Revival building in the district, was an inn and official stagecoach stop during this era Lumbering gave way to tanning, as the Catskills' vast Eastern hemlock stands had plenty of tannin in their bark. Judge Stoddard Hammond became rich through this industry, building a tannery complex along nearby Chestnut Creek and a Gothic Revival cottage overlooking it in 1857. Like many Catskill tanners, he did extremely well during the Civil War, supplying the Union Army with all its leather. He sold the tannery and its associated properties, including a Greek Revival company store that still survives, to his partner John Reynolds New York City after the war. Reynolds kept the tannery going, even after the Panic of 1873, and the citizens of Grahamsville were able to build their church, meeting house and cemetery at the east end of the district the following year. But in 1878 he finally closed it, and the hamlet's tanning days were ended. With the pollution from the tanneries gone, Sullivan County became a summer resort destination in the late 19th century. The Italian villa-style Southwick House, dating to 1882, is representative of this period. That business either faded or shifted southwards after the 1920s, and Grahamsville reverted to its farming and lumbering days. The center of the hamlet is now to the west of the district, near the junction of routes 42 and 55, in the wake of the construction of Tri-Valley Central School and Rondout Reservoir to the east. The buildings from Grahamsville's early years are still mostly intact. Contributing properties The six elements of the district are: *The Marenius Dayton House, *The 1857 House, a Gothic revival cottage, *The Southwick House, *Tannery Store, now a private residence, *The Grahamsville Rural Cemetery, and *the Grahamsville Reformed Church and its accompanying Memorial Hall References Category:National Register of Historic Places in Sullivan County, New York Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in New York (state) Category:Historic districts in Sullivan County, New York ","title":"Grahamsville Historic District"},{"id":"14973508","text":"International Community for the Relief of Suffering and Starvation (ICROSS) is an international non-governmental organisation that provides health and development services for pastoral communities in East Africa. The organisation (ICROSS), was formerly known as CROSS between 1979–82, standing for Community for the Relief of Suffering and Starvation. ICROSS, a Kenya-based international non-governmental organization, INGO, charity, and private voluntary organization founded by Dr Michael Elmore-Meegan and Dr Joseph Barnes. The organisation was formally established in Kenya, East Africa with the support of the Irish priests Paul Cunningham and John Hughes, both C.S.Sp. ICROSS specialises in long term primary health, community healthcare and public health programmes. The organisation's headquarters are in Ngong, Rift Valley, Kenya. ICROSS has an established research programme ( for 40 years ) with a number of different partners and research collaborators. According to the ICROSS Annual Report 2014, Dr. Elmore-Meegan is the International Director. ICROSS closed in Ireland in 2010. The Board of Directors include: Sally Mukwana, Dr Allan Soita MB ,D.Ngwiri Ndwaru, P.NgaNga, Edwin Chege, LLB, with Dr E.Sequeira M D, Emeritus Chairman, Ex Officio Dr Elmore-Meegan D.Med. ICROSS areas of programming ICROSS is as an International development NGO, registered under the Kenyan NGO act and regulated by the Kenyan Government, with a focus in the field of health, with key international lectures including the Red Future shocks lecture. ICROSS has most recently lectured at International conferences in the Nordic countries, Cambodia and Nepal. ICROSS is responsible for a large terminal care programme and a series of public health programmes. One of ICROSS's key research streams has been investigating means of solar disinfection (SODIS) of contaminated drinking water, and has helped conduct a number of control trials of SODIS. ICROSS stresses traditional tribal values, building development programmes through the existing decision systems and creating locally driven agendas. In 2015-16 the key areas of ICROSS programming are: *Community-based primary health care *Training traditional birth attendants, reduction of maternal deaths, gender rights awareness, commercial sex workers support, female circumcision harm reduction, safe motherhood education and girls. *Poverty reduction *Training health workers in desert areas, trachoma blindness control, diarrhoea control, tribal community health programmes, surgical training, desertification projects. *Children’s rights and gender and development *Child-to-child sanitation and hygiene, pediatric disease control, child survival, immunisation, primary health care, infant mortality control, AIDS orphans and vulnerable children’s rights, child health promotion. *Community strengthening *Disease surveillance, women group developments, technical support to small organisations, legal and material support, water and sanitation projects, ICROSS resource leverage, partnership development and networking. *HIV/AIDS, TB and Malaria prevention *Homecare of terminally ill, AIDS orphans and vulnerable children, TB awareness, detection and control, malaria control, maternal transmission education, voluntary counseling and testing, training in disease control. International profile ICROSS campaigns since 1979 have included Africa awakes which tries to change the stereotypes and negative perceptions of Africa. These exhibitions have received wide media coverage in Italy and France. ICROSS public health work has been cited internationally, medical work has appeared in key scientific journals since 1981. ([Elmore- Meegan]), currently International Director, was featured in BBC's Hardtalk current affair's programme for his work for ICROSS while in 2006 the organisation was the subject of an award-winning documentary by Irish Television. ICROSS and its Founders have received widespread recognition for their work, especially in long term public health and creating lasting community development programmes. In 2013 ICROSS extended its programmes internationally building on over three decades of disease control experience. It established a new Overseas Internship programme extending its 25-year history of Internship support. In May 2013 it extended its localisation strategy and began a radical low cost innovation plan with local tribal communities. In Fall 2014 ICROSS launched its radical Strategic plan 2015–20 that has seen dynamic changes in its Global direction. ICROSS work is widely cited and the administration is entirely Africanized since August 2000. The International Director Dr ([Michael Elmore-Meegan]), a specialist in International health, has supervised the Public health Research programme publishing in major Peer review journals since 1983. Together with Dr E Sequeira, Dr A. Soita and D.Ngwiri, ICROSS continues to implement long term public health innovations.

The route begins at the intersection of Route 1 (The Trans Canada Highway) in Deer Lake and ends in St. Anthony. Officially known as the Great Northern Peninsula Highway, it has been designated as the Viking Trail since it is the main auto route to L'Anse aux Meadows, the only proven Viking era settlement in North America. It is the primary travel route in the Great Northern Peninsula and the only improved highway between Deer Lake and St. Anthony. It is the main access route to the Labrador Ferry terminal in St. Barbe. The route passes along the western coast of Newfoundland with views of the Gulf of St. Lawrence and Strait of Belle Isle to the west and the Long Range Mountains to the east. It passes through or near several towns and villages including Rocky Harbour, Port au Choix, and St. Barbe as well as Gros Morne National Park. Route 430 is the longest provincial route on the island portion of the province that branches out from Route 1. Route description Route 430 begins at an interchange with Route 1 (Trans-Canada Highway, Exit 16) in Deer Lake and it heads northwest to immediately cross the Humber River and have intersections with local roads leading to the Nicholsville neighbourhood and the town of Reidville. The highway now leaves Deer Lake and continues northwest through rural areas to have an intersection with Route 422 (Cormack Road) before it begins winding its way through the Long Range Mountains. Route 430 passes through Jack Ladder, Bonne Bay Pond, and Wiltondale, where it has an intersection with Route 431 (Bonne Bay Road), before passing through Gros Morne National Park. The highway now exits both the National Park and the mountain range as it passes through Rocky Harbour, where it meets a local road to Norris Point, before passing through neighbouring Lobster Cove, where it passes by the Lobster Cove Head Lighthouse. Route 430 begins heading up the western coastline of the Great Northern Peninsula (the Strait of Belle Isle side), passing through Bakers Brook, the Green Point portion of Gros Morne National Park, Sally's Cove (where it crosses the Western Brook), and Gulls Marsh. The highway now passes Gros Morne National Park's Western Brook Pond trailhead before passing through St. Pauls (where it crosses St. Paul's Bay). Route 430 has intersections with two local roads leading to Cow Head before passing through Three Mile Rock, Parson's Pond (where it crosses the Parson's Pond River), Portland Creek (where it crosses the creek of the same name), Daniel's Harbour, Bellburns, and River of Ponds (where it crosses the river of the same name) before the road turns more inland. The highway now passes through Hawke's Bay (where it crosses the Torrent River and Big East River) to meet a local road leading to Port Saunders and Port au Choix before Route 430 rejoins the coastline at Eddies Cove West. Route 430 passes through Barr'd Harbour and turns more inland again to pass through Castor River South (where it crosses the Castors River) to have intersections with local roads leading to the neighbouring settlements of Castor River North, Bartlett's Harbour, Reefs Harbour, Shoal Cove West, and New Ferolle before having an intersection with Route 432 (Main Point Highway/Grenfell Loop).

Conquered by Prussia in 1742, it was enfeoffed to the Welf dukes of Brunswick-Lüneburg from 1792 until its dissolution in 1884. History Oleśnica Castle Initially part of the Piast Duchy of Silesia, the Oleśnica area became part of the Duchy of Głogów in 1294, following an armed conflict between Duke Henry III of Głogów and his cousin Henry V the Fat, Duke of Wrocław. After the death of Duke Henry III in 1309, it gained significant autonomy during the division of the Głogów lands and the creation of the Duchy of Oleśnica for Henry's son Bolesław in 1313, succeeded by his brother Konrad I in 1321. Konrad sought protection from the inheritance claims raised by his Piast cousins and King Władysław I the Elbow-high of Poland at the Bohemian crown and in 1329 swore allegiance to the Luxembourg king John of Bohemia. On good terms with King John and his son Emperor Charles IV, Duke Konrad I was able to acquire the Koźle area upon the death of Duke Bolesław of Bytom in 1355. His son Duke Konrad II the Gray further purchased the town of Kąty and half of the Duchy of Ścinawa from Duke Henry VIII the Sparrow. He bequested considerable possessions to his successor Konrad III the Old in 1403. Oleśnica remained a Bohemian fief, which from 1413 was ruled by the sons of Duke Konrad III. While Konrad IV the Older acquired the title of a Duke of Bernstadt (Bierutów) and became Bishop of Wrocław in 1417, while his younger brothers Konrad V Kantner and Konrad VII the White in 1437 reached their renewed enfeoffment by Emperor Sigismund. The sons of Konrad V, Konrad IX the Black and Konrad X the White assumed the rule in 1450 and again paid homage to the Bohemian king George of Poděbrady. Thus, after the local branch of the Silesian Piasts had died out with the death of Duke Konrad X in 1492, Duke Henry of Münsterberg, son of the predeceased Bohemian King George of Poděbrady, claimed the ceased fief for him and his descendants. His claims were finally acknowledged by George's successor King Vladislav II Jagellonský in 1495, after the state countries Syców (Groß Wartenberg), Żmigród (Trachenberg), and Milicz (Militsch) had been split off. Ducatus in Silesia Inferiore Olsnensis, engraving by Pieter Schenk the Younger, about 1720 When the Poděbrad dynasty became extinct in 1647, the Habsburg emperor Ferdinand III, King of Bohemia, enfeoffed Silvius I Nimrod of Württemberg with Oleśnica, who had married the daughter of the last Podiěbrad duke. The duchy remained under the Crown of Bohemia until in 1742 it was conquered by the Kingdom of Prussia in the course of the Silesian Wars. The Württemberg dukes remained landowners until in 1792 the duchy was inherited by Frederick Augustus of Brunswick-Lüneburg, son of Charles I, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel. From 1815 Oleśnica was ruled in personal union with the Duchy of Brunswick until its dissolution after Duke William had died without issue in 1884.

He is especially known for staging performances of plays with the Children of Paul's. Life Westcott was a chorister, under John Redford, at St. Paul's Cathedral, London, and in 1550 became organist and almoner of the cathedral. In 1557 he became master of Children of Paul's, the boys of that cathedral. He retained his post at St. Paul's, under Edward VI, Queen Mary, and Queen Elizabeth I, from 1550 to 1582, notwithstanding the fact that he was an avowed Catholic. Westcott is chiefly known for the many plays and pageants, with music, which he produced for the English Court during a period of 32 years, these plays being performed by the boys of the cathedral school. So celebrated was he in this respect that he was generally referred to as \\"Master Sebastian\\". Under Queen Mary he had the honour of arranging the music for the formal restoration of Catholicism at St. Paul's, in November 1553. He also composed the Te Deum which was sung on 9 February 1554, on the suppression of Wyatt's rebellion. He conducted the service for the reception of Cardinal Reginald Pole on the first Sunday of Advent, 1554, when the motet Te spectant Reginalde Pole, by Orlande de Lassus, was sung. Di Lassus was in England at this time, as was also Philippe de Monte, and both were probably present. Under Elizabeth I, in 1559, Westcott refused to subscribe to the Thirty-Nine Articles, yet official documents from 1559 to 1561 prove that \\"Master Sebastian\\" was well paid for his musical and dramatic performances. In May 1561 the Catholic propagandist Nicholas Sander, in a report to Cardinal Morone, highly praised Westcott. In 1561 Bishop Edmund Grindal summoned him for refusing to take part in the Anglican Communion, and in July 1563 excommunicated him. Lord Robert Dudley, the Queen's favourite, intervened for him, however, and Bishop Grindal answered at length, apologizing, and explaining his action, though declining to suspend his verdict, only to suspend it for a while.Rosenberg p. 302 14 years later, in December 1577, Westcott was deprived by Bishop John Aylmer and imprisoned in the Marshalsea as a recusant. Apparently, Queen Elizabeth missed her customary Christmas plays by the choristers of St. Paul's, and so Westcott was released on 19 March 1578. Westcott died in 1582, leaving assets of considerable value.

It is located in the North West of France. Geography The towns nearby are Montfort-sur-Meu, La Nouaye, Bédée, Pleumeleuc, Saint-Gonlay, Talensac and Breteil. By its surface, Iffendic is at the third rank of the towns in the department, after Paimpont and Martigné-Ferchaud. The Meu river goes through the town. Population Inhabitants of Iffendic are called Iffendicois in French.Ille-et-Vilaine, www.habitants.fr History Iffendic was located on the crossroad of two Roman ways; the North/South way from Corseul to Nantes and the East/West way from Rennes to Carhaix. We can also mention other older traces from the Gallo-Roman period with the menhir of Pierre Longue (Neolithic) near the villages of La Barre and Vau-Savelin. Normans devastated the district during the 10th century and the church changed of place, it was not at the edge of the Meu river anymore. The church was rebuilt in 1122 by a certain Jacob, at the place where the church is now. In 1189, the church of Iffendic was given to Noirmoutier en Touraine abbey which founded then a priory in the region. After the settlement of the Benedictines, the diocese of Saint-Malo kept sizeable rights on the parish of Iffendic. The parish was divided into 11 sections, in particular to collect taxes: the town centre, Allansac, la Barre, Boutavent, Canlou, Couacurel, Pintillac, Tréez, Tréhieuc, Trévit, and Vaubeuzet. During the Middle Ages, Iffendic had many buildings on its own territory, like castles and manors. The castle of Boutavent (12th century) accommodated the Lords of Montfort when the castle of Montfort had been destroyed. They stayed in Boutavent during nearly two centuries before settling back to their former castle: the one in Montfort. After that, the site seemed to be abandoned but nothing proves that it hasn't been inhabited then. The population of the town is in favour of the changes brought by the French Revolution, above all after the end of the reign of the Terror. The major revolutionary event is the one celebrating the execution of Louis XVI, accompanied by a hatred oath to the royalty and to the anarchy. It is celebrated since 1795.Louis Dubreuil, « Fêtes révolutionnaires en Ille-et- Vilaine », in Annales de Bretagne, volume 21, tome 4, 1905, p. 398-399 Tourism Tourism management in Montfort-sur-Meu is entrusted by Montfort Community to the Tourist Office of the district of Montfort.

Located at 2 km from the land of Trémelin, the valley of the Chambre au loup offers a beautiful landscape. This valley has been dug by a subsidence due to rifts which appeared in the fold of the schist, and to the erosion caused by the river. It has 70 hectares of wooded moors, high cliffs in which the dizziest is 35m high. This \\"small canyon\\" also offers pedestrian hikes in a pleasant and natural environment. This site is so called because it is said that in one of the cliff’s caves is where the last wolf of the region lived. * The land of Trémelin () is a natural site stretching over more than 220 hectares. The site has a big forest, moors, and areas classified as a natural area of ecological, faunistic and floristic interest, but also one of the principal \\"oligodystrophes\\" ponds (pond with very slow plant dynamics) in Ille-et-Vilaine. Many trails (including the one going around the pond) allow exploration of site. Trémelin leisure base also offers diversified leisure activities. Since May 2010, on the land of Trémelin, can be found a place for contemporary art called L'Aparté. * The land of Careil. Departmental natural area of 96 hectares, it gathers many birds of many different species. An ornithological observatory is at the disposal of the public, in particular to observe migratory or winter birds.Nous-Vous-Ille, Milieux humides - Un passeport vous en dit plus, Mars-avril-mai 2009, p. 46. It is a land which has a pond called the pond of Careil. The pond, dried up during the 19th century, was rebuilt. * The land of Boutavent. Located near the land of Trémelin and the Chambre au loup, the land of Boutavent is marked with the imprint of an old feudal castle built by the Lords of Montfort (From the 12th to the 14th century). Interpreting boards allow visitors to understand the history of the site. It also constitutes a \\"conservatory\\" of landscapes where forests, moors and hedged farmlands are next to each other. * Forest of Iffendic. It stretches over more than 300 hectares and is principally located around the land of Trémelin, the Chambre au Loup, and the mill of Le Casse. The trees we can find in the forest are mostly oaks, beeches and pines. Many paths are accessible by foot, by bike and for some people, by horse. * Arboretum. Created in 2003, the arboretum offers a place for a walk in the heart of the town of Iffendic. Indeed, a marked path allows to walk through the sculptures of local artists on the edge of the Meu river. * Valley of Le Casse. Adorned of rocky puddingstone blockfield, big cracks cut the rock.

Its site, formerly a prominent hill-top overlooking the Euphrates Valley, is now an island in Lake Assad that can only be reached by an artificial causeway. Although the hilltop on which the castle sits was possibly already fortified in the 7th century, the current structures are primarily the work of Nur ad-Din, who rebuilt the castle from 1168 onwards. Since 1965, several excavations have been carried out in and around the castle, as well as restoration works of the walls and towers. The castle was a Turkish exclave between 1921 and 1973. History =Before the castle= It is not exactly known when the hilltop of Qal'at Ja'bar was first fortified. The site was already known as \\"Dawsar\\" in pre-Islamic times and was located along a route connecting Raqqa with the west. =11th century and later= The castle may have been built by the Banu Numayr tribe in the 11th century. Historical sources mention that the castle was given by Malik-Shah I to descendants of the Uqaylid dynasty in 1086. They held the castle almost continuously until the late 12th century, except for a brief occupation by Crusaders in 1102. In 1146, Zengi besieged the castle, but he was murdered there by one of his own slaves. In 1168, Qal'at Ja'bar passed into the hands of Zengi's son Nur ad-Din, who undertook major construction works at the castle. Most of what can be seen today dates to this period. The castle was heavily damaged during the Mongol invasions of Syria. Restoration works were carried out in the 14th century. =Tomb of Suleyman Shah= Suleyman Shah, the grandfather of Osman I (progenitor of the Ottoman Empire), reputedly drowned in the Euphrates near Qal'at Ja'bar, and was buried near the castle. However, it is probable that this story resulted from a confusion between Suleyman Shah, and Sulayman bin Kutalmish, the founder of the Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm. It is however not certain whether the actual tomb, known as Mezār-i Türk, related to either of these two rulers. The Ottoman sultan Hamid II had the tomb reconstructed. By article 9 of the Treaty of Ankara of 1921, the area was accepted as Turkish territory and Turkish soldiers were allowed to guard the tomb after Syria's establishment as a French mandate and eventual independence. In 1973, in response to the rising water level of the newly created Lake Assad, the reputed tomb of Suleyman Shah and the associated exclave were moved to a new location north of Qal'at Ja'bar and the castle itself became Syrian territory. =Syrian Civil War= SDF fighters examine Qal'at Ja'bar following their capture of the castle in January 2017. ISIL had built tunnels and weapons depots into the castle grounds. During the Syrian Civil War, Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant captured the castle in its 2014 offensive in Syria. The castle grounds were suspected to have been subsequently repurposed by ISIL as a training ground, with tunnels and weapons depots built into the site. Syrian Democratic Forces captured the site on 6 January 2017 as part of its Raqqa offensive, seizing it after killing 22 ISIL fighters. Architecture Qal'at Ja'bar measures . The castle consists of a stone-built wall with 35 bastions around a rock core, and is partially surrounded by a dry moat. The layout of the castle is very reminiscent of the much better preserved citadel of Aleppo. The upper parts of the castle are built from baked bricks. The entrance to the inner parts of the castle consists of a gatehouse and a winding ramp cut out of the rock. Inside the castle are the remains of a vaulted hall, as well as minaret that was probably built by Nur ad-Din, and that is the highest part of the castle. The brickwork that is currently visible is mainly the result of extensive restoration works by the Syrian Directorate-General of Antiquities and Museums (DGAM). Restoration and excavation In 1968, construction of the Tabqa Dam commenced, as a result of which the area upstream would eventually be flooded by the dam's reservoir. In anticipation of the filling of the reservoir, excavations and restoration works were carried out at numerous sites in the region, including Qal'at Ja'bar. Although the location of Qal'at Ja'bar on a prominent hilltop ensured that it would not be flooded, the eventual lake level would turn the castle into an island. It was therefore surrounded by a protective glacis, and it was connected to the mainland by a causeway. These works were carried out between 1965 and 1974 by the Architectural Service of the DGAM, the Directorate General of the Dam and UNESCO at a cost of 4 million Syrian pounds. The restoration focused primarily on the eastern walls and towers. In addition, parts of the western ramparts were restored, as well as the donjon Alia, which was intended to house a museum for the finds of the excavations at the castle. To facilitate the restoration, a small brickworks was established at the castle. Finds from the castle are now on display in the National Museum of Aleppo and Raqqa Museum.

They have released five full-length albums, which includes a re-release of their debut album Shine Honesty, multiple EPs, a live DVD, and Christmas- themed offerings. They were the first band signed by Grooveshark, which folded in 2015, as part of their Artist Development Program. Their latest full-length album Transgressor was released February 24, 2015. History =2000 - 2008: Formation and early success= Muse started his musical aspirations as part of the East Texas indie music boom with his participation in several projects at the time, which included Uncle Andrew, Neckpunch, The Lonely Hearts and a short stint as bass fill-in for Eisley. A key contributor in the songwriting process for Eisley's debut album for Warner Bros. Records, Muse also gave the band a new name that, if only in part, would stick, MossEisley. After an unsuccessful year with the Connotations in Nashville, Muse returned to Austin to begin writing and recording what would become the band's first full-length release Shine Honesty under the name Quiet Company. The record was quickly picked up for online distribution by the boutique Christian label Northern Records. Recording Shine Honesty mostly by himself, Muse was in need of band mates to play live shows, providing the pretext for Quiet Company's first permanent addition, Tommy Blank, via a Craigslist ad, in 2005. The band embarked on a number of small national tours in the subsequent the years. Shortly after, the band left their label in order to exert more self control over their content. The band's next offerings were decidedly more festive, with 2007 bringing a recording of \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\\" as part of Peace on Earth: A Holiday Album, in which proceeds from sales went to the Toys for Tots charity, as well as their own release A Merry Little Christmas EP. =2009 - Present: New additions and continued success= In 2009, the band recorded and self-released their second full-length album, Everyone You Love Will Be Happy Soon, with local producers Charlie Vela and Louie Lino of Nada Surf fame, and mixed by Tim Palmer, who had worked previously with U2 and Pearl Jam. Following the release, Jeff Weathers (drums) and Matthew Parmenter (bass guitar) joined the group as permanent members, with Parmenter's addition to the group the result of another Craigslist ad. While filming their music video for the single, \\"On Modern Men\\", the band added their fifth member, Cody Ackors on trombone. In 2010, Quiet Company released Songs for Staying In, a 6-song EP, produced by Quiet Company and recorded by bass player Matt Parmenter in his apartment studio, Ice Cream Factory Studios. Continuing to be recognized, 2011 began with the band being nominated for the 10th Annual Independent Music Awards under the Pop/Rock Song category for \\"It’s Better To Spend Money Like There’s No Tomorrow Than Spend Tonight Like There’s No Money\\". By mid-2011, Quiet Company joined forces via an Artist Development deal with the former music-streaming service Grooveshark. The band's partnership with the service helped to encourage a global audience by increasing exposure on platforms like Facebook and increasing overall listenership on the steaming site, making the band's offerings available to a wider audience. The band spent most of 2011 promoting their new album around Texas, in addition to scoring slots at CMJ and DeLuna Festival. Songs from the new album have peaked on popular blog-aggregator websites such as Hype Machine and We Are Hunted (#49 Most Hyped and #5 on Rock Charts, respectively), in addition to receiving attention on websites such as NPR and the TV show Last Call with Carson Daly. In a dominant showing, Quiet Company and its members won a total of ten awards at the Austin Chronicle's 30th Annual Austin Music Awards in 2012, including Best Band and Album of the Year, with Muse receiving Musician of the Year honors. Returning to the studio in 2014, Quiet Company recorded its fifth full-length album Transgressor at Orb Recording Studio in Austin, with producer Matt Noveskey. The album was released February 24, 2015 on Modern Outsider Records. 2016 proved to be a year of transitions for the group – with existing members exiting the group and new ones taking their places. The following years have proceeded with three EP-length releases by Quiet Company with themes centering around Muse’s divorce from his wife, which took place after the release of Transgressor. =Religious influences, criticism= Though Muse's Quiet Company was initially signed to a Christian label Northern Records, played the Christian rock oriented Cornerstone Festival and Muse himself repeatedly drawing heavy religious comparisons in his lyrics, he has stated that he is no longer a Christian and has posited that Quiet Company has never been a Christian band: \\"I've always fallen back on religious imagery as a songwriting tool, just because it was familiar to me and I liked the aesthetic of it,\\" says Muse in a recent interview with the Austin Chronicle. Early efforts by the band include heavy use of Christian themes and iconography, but have shifted over time, with the meaning behind the metaphor's usage evoking something much different than it did previously for the band. Speaking specifically about the 2011 release We Are All Where We Belong, Muse states, \\"It's easily the most personal thing I've ever written. It is, essentially, a break up record, only the romance that's ending was between myself and religion.\\" The album left most of the band's pre-existing Christian fan base confused. Muse says he receives e-mails frequently from fans who \\"love the record\\" but are \\"concerned\\" about his departure from religion. =Exposure and touring= Quiet Company's music has been and continues to be featured by various Austin rock-oriented radio stations such as KUTX, KSGR, KROX, KUT, KOOP and KLBJ. Expanding exposure outside the local scene, a sampling of the band's songs have been used in television shows such as E!'s Keeping Up With the Kardashians, MTV's The Real World: New Orleans, The CW’s Hart of Dixie, ABC’s My Generation, USA’s Royal Pains and in The Sims 3: Showtime expansion pack for The Sims 3. Quiet Company has done several national tours but plays predominantly in and around their home state, Texas. They have played with many notable acts, such as Blue October, Rooney, Stoney, Ghostland Observatory, What Made Milwaukee Famous, Deadbeat Darling, Alpha Rev, The Rocketboys, Dear and the Headlights, Third Eye Blind, Dashboard Confessional, Cheap Trick, Eisley, Evan Dando, Bob Schneider, Old 97's and The Toadies.

His personality and business practices angered many Toronto capitalists leading one of the bank's directors, Senator William McMaster, to found the Canadian Bank of Commerce. Taking advantage of the instability caused by the American Civil War, he positioned the Bank of Montreal to be the leading bank in the New York gold market. The Bank became the primary fiscal agent for the government of Canada. King advocated for a new banking system which would have benefited larger, more stable banks like the Bank of Montreal triggering a political backlash that led to the passage of the Bank Act in 1871. Historian Oscar Douglas Skelton called him \\"the most striking figure in Canadian banking history\\".

The Plaza Mayor (English: \\"Main Square\\") is a central plaza in the city of Valladolid, Spain. It is located only a few blocks away from another famous plaza, the Plaza Zorrilla. History Plaza Mayor The Plaza Mayor (\\"Main Square\\") in the present. The Main Square in the 1950s. Main view of the square and the town hall. Its existence became defined in the mid-thirteenth century when the market moved from the Plaza de Santa Maria to Market Square, which since the early sixteenth century has been called Plaza Mayor. Individual unions were installed around it, as was the Convent of San Francisco, until 1499 the most important building in the vicinity. After that date, as mandated by the Catholic Monarchs it was the House of the Municipality who presided over the life of the city. After its destruction in 1561 because of a serious fire at the old Market Square and thanks to the direct intervention of Philip II, it became urbanized as a meeting place and marketplace of traders who came from all parts of the Kingdom. The reconstruction project was the work of Francisco de Salamanca, royal architect. He gave birth to the modern town square in urban planning — a milestone for Spain and the Americas that it is a great contribution of the Spanish Baroque architecture. The Plaza Mayor of Valladolid is the first great plaza in Spain, and closed with arcades, is a space intended for use as a market and as a backdrop to the public celebrations so dear to the Habsburg monarchy. It had been designed with large balconies to facilitate the viewing of the shows, and served as a model, since the seventeenth century, for many others in Spain (such as Madrid, 1617 or Salamanca, 1729) and South America, even having an impact in Italy. Details General Procession of Holy Week in Valladolid at Good Friday. The plaza has a rectangular plan with completely arcaded porches which rest on columns or square granite pillars and is of the open type, i.e. the streets leading to it have no hindrance or screen. It is surrounded by narrow streets reminiscent of the past and is one of the largest in Spain. Clock tower of the town hall Traditionally, the houses of the square had a height of three storeys. The distribution of voids was hierarchical. The first floor had balconies, the second railings, and the third, simple windows. This original appearance was changed over time until all floors had balconies. The Plaza Mayor is presided over by a statue of the founder of the city, Pedro Ansúrez designed by Aurelio Carretero and unveiled in 1903. On the northern flank of its rectangular layout, stands the Casa Consistorial, seat of the Town Hall of Valladolid. The previous building, dating from the sixteenth century survived until 1879, but had been reformed over time. For example, in the mid-nineteenth century, a tower for a clock was built in the center of the facade. The existing building had a long beginning. First there was a design contest for the new Consistory, a project won by the local architect Antonio Iturralde, who presented a draft that, while the winner, not well liked. Iturralde died in 1897 and Enrique Repullés and Vargas took over the work. The Iturralde draft was discarded and a new building of Beaux-Arts architecture was constructed and completed in 1908. Facing this building is Zorrilla Theater, opened in 1884. It is situated on the original site of the Convent of San Francisco, the immense monastery, totally demolished between 1835 and 1850. Lately there have been efforts to return to the original homogeneity through certain mechanisms (such as the red paint on all facades of the buildings) though some are historically and aesthetically questionable.

History After the fragmentation of the Polish kingdom upon the 1138 Testament of Bolesław III Krzywousty the lands around the castellany of Pszczyna belonged to the Seniorate Province of Lesser Poland (Małopolska), until in 1177 Duke Casimir II the Just granted them to the Silesian duke Mieszko I Tanglefoot. Mieszko attached Pszczyna to his Duchy of Racibórz. The Racibórz branch of the Silesian Piasts became extinct with the death of Duke Leszek in 1336. Before his death, Leszek together with several other Dukes of Silesia had accepted vassalization by King John of Bohemia in 1327, putting his duchy in the Bohemian Crown, acknowledged by King Casimir III the Great of Poland in the 1335 Treaty of Trentschin. In 1336, King John gave the Duchy of Racibórz with Pszczyna to the Přemyslid duke Nicholas II of Opava, who had married late Duke Leszek's sister Anna of Racibórz and ruled both duchies in personal union. In 1407 Nicholas's grandson John II, Duke of Opava and Racibórz, gave the territories of Pszczyna, Bieruń, Mysłowice, and Mikołów as a dowry to his wife Helena, a niece of the Polish king Jogaila. After the acquisition of several villages south of Żory in 1412, Helena, upon the death of her husband in 1424 ruled as a Duchess of Pless, succeeded in 1452 by her daughter-in-law, Barbara Rockenberg, wife of Helena's son, Nicholas V, Duke of Ratibor-Jägerndorf, and the duchy was downgraded to a state country within the Lands of the Bohemian Crown. From 1462 onwards, Pless was held by the sons of the Bohemian king George of Poděbrady, until Victor, Duke of Münsterberg in 1480 sold it to his son-in-law the Silesian duke Casimir II of Cieszyn. In 1517 it was acquired by the Hungarian magnates of the Thurzó family. In the accompanying sales document issued in the Czech language on 21 February 1517 apart from a castle and city of Pless mentions also 3 towns (Bieruń, Mysłowice, Mikołów) and 50 villages belonging to Pless: Jankowice, Woszczyce, Międzyrzecze, Bojszowy, Brzozówka, v Wieze, Wola, Miedźna, Grzawa, Rudołtowice, Goczałkowice, Łąka, Wisła Wielka, Pawłowice, Zgoń, Brzeźce, Poręba, Stara Wieś, Czarków, Radostowice, Piasek, Studzionka, Szeroka, Krzyżowice, Warszowice, Kryry, Suszec, Kobiór, Wyry, Łaziska Dolne, Łaziska Górne, Smiłowice, Ligota, Stara Kuźnica, Zarzecze, Podlesie, Piotrowice, Tychy, Wilkowyje, Paprocany, Cielmice, Lędziny, Brzęczkowice, Brzezinka, Zabrzeg, Porąbka, Studzienice, Roździeń, Bogucice, Jaźwce, Dziećkowice. Thurzó again sold it (with the approval of Emperor Ferdinand I, King of Bohemia) in 1548 to the Prince-Bishop of Wrocław, Balthasar von Promnitz. The Promnitz family held the duchy as a state country until 1765. =Principality of Pless= Hans Heinrich XV (1916) Książ (Fürstenstein) Castle, since 1509 owned by the counts of Hochberg Pszczyna (Pless) Palace In the War of the Austrian Succession most of Silesia was conquered by the kingdom of Prussia; but the Dukes, and later Princes, of Pless would remain the rulers of the territory. Since 1742 Pless was a state country within Brandenburg-Prussia. The Dukes of Anhalt-Köthen-Pless inherited it in 1765 (being descended from the earlier dukes in the female line), the last of them died in 1847, and was succeeded by his nephew, Hans Heinrich X, Count of Hochberg, and first president of the Prussian House of Lords. The Hochbergs, from Fürstenstein near Waldenburg (in Lower Silesia), were father, son and grandson: Hans Heinrich X, XI, and XV;The dynastic numbering was, as in other princely families, given to all males of the House. they were among the wealthiest families in the Holy Roman Empire, in part because of the mines of Pless.Editor's introduction to Daisy, Princess of Pless; for the wealth of the Hochbergs and the mines, see also Anderson,loc. cit.. The incumbents of state countries (Standesherren) had no sovereignty over their possessions, but held the privileges to supervise religion, charitable endowments, school education, and lower jurisdiction. In 1830 the Prussian state stripped all Standesherren of their juridical competences and subjected their remaining privileges to state supervision. The Prince's power over his land, since 1807 constituted as alienable allodial property, and thus his influence on its tenants was very great; for example, when the Duke of Ratibor,Victor Moritz Karl, Prince of Hohenlohe-Waldenburg-Schillingsfürst, also Prince of Corvey; younger brother of Chlodwig, Prince of Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst, later Chancellor, who had given up the family estates. Half of the real estate in the district belonged to the Prince of Pless; the Hohenlohes owned much of the rest. who had represented the constituency of the districts of Pless and Rybnik in the North German parliament of the North German Confederation, ran in the first election to the Imperial German Reichstag in 1871, Hans Heinrich XI, Prince of Pless, endorsed him, and was able to enlist even the constabulary, servants of the Prussian state, as election workers; he also threatened the economic well- being of those who opposed his candidate. But the Prince's power was not absolute; the opposition candidate, the \\"already semi-canonized\\" Father Eduard Müller, a priest born in Quilitz near Glogau who was active as Catholic missionary in Protestant Berlin, won anyway. This electoral surprise was one of the first great successes of the German Catholic Centre Party which Müller had co-founded; they retained the seat until 1903, when much of the Centre Party's delegation from Upper Silesia was replaced, although by very thin majorities, by the Polish National Democrats.Anderson, p.1464-68; which contains contemporary accounts of Müller, his charisma, and his charity; \\"half-saintly\\" is a quotation from the minutes of the Reichstag, Anderson, p.165. Her analysis is that the land proprietors of 1871 could indeed suppress any secular opposition; opposition candidates had to hand out ballots to voters, and this could be prevented - but the pulpit was relatively free. The Princes of Pless regarded themselves as benevolent lords. Hans Heinrich XI introduced a pension scheme in 1879, before Bismarck's social legislation; also company housing and other social measures. But worker discontent under his son reached the point of a public petition to the Imperial Reichstag.Koch, pp. 99, 105,109 Alexander II of Russia gave the Hochbergs a herd of wisents in 1864 or 1865, the herd was broken up and reduced to three survivors by poaching at the time of the German Revolution in the aftermath of the First World War.Ahrens, p.61. The Hochbergs were Princes of Pless in the Prussian peerage; however, in 1905, Hans Heinrich XI was created Duke of Pless, for his lifetime only - in part because he had been a Prince for fifty years;Daisy, Princess of Pless, Better Left Unsaid, p.177 in Germany, dukes outranked princes (Fürsten). Hans Heinrich XV succeeded in 1907; he had married Mary Theresa Cornwallis-West, better known as Daisy, Princess of Pless. He was one of the Kaiser's adjutants during the First World War; several important planning conferences were held at Pless itself during the war; and when the Central powers decided to create a Kingdom of Poland as a German-Austrian protectorate, Hans Heinrich (and, according to his wife, his two elder sons) were among the many to be considered for (and decline) the vacant throne, in part because of their Polish descent.The submarine warfare conferences of August 1916 and January 1917; also the conference of October 1917, which both issued a general invitation to discuss peace terms and invited a Polish delegation to discuss the settlement of Poland. Daisy, Princess of Pless, 420-2; Koch, p. 240; Heinz Lemke, Allianz und Rivaltät, die Mittelmächte und Polen im ersten Weltkrieg (Bis zur Februarrevolution) Vienna (1977), pp. 142, 357; Brunauer, op. cit., pp. 55l, 553f., 568. Princess Daisy wrote that Prince Hans declined for his sons, who were not then of age; the other Hochbergs have not confirmed those offers, but Koch considers them plausible: Alexander, the second son, became a Polish citizen after the war, and was fairly popular in Poland. The Prussian Government attempted to Germanize or assimilate the ethnic Poles on its conquered territories, culminating in the Polish Expropriation Act of 1908, which Hans Heinrich XV opposed.Princess Daisy of Pless. pp. 147-151, and note to p. 151; Koch, p. 154; because of the Parliamentary opposition to it, it remained largely unenforced. - Imanuel Geiss Die Polnische Grenzstreifen, 1914-18, Lübeck, 1960, p.20, which also notes four expulsions in 1911. The policy of moving ethnic Poles out was delayed until the war. The greatest efforts in defence against Germanisation were made by regional newspaper called \\"Tygodnik Polski Poświęcony Włościanom\\" (\\"Polish Weekly for Estate Owners\\"), which was the first newspaper printed in Polish language in Upper Silesia.About Polish-Silesian \\"Tygodnik Polski Poświęcony Włościanom\\" (Polish Weekly for Farmers) , University of Bielsko- Biała.

After 1918, with the end of monarchy in Prussia, the state country privileges were abolished. The noble titles were abolished in Germany in 1919 by the Weimar constitution, but transformed into parts of the family names, thus until 1919 the family name was of Hochberg and of Pless and the title count and prince, respectively, the family name became Graf von Hochberg and Fürst von Pleß,In German usage the citation and addressing of members of noble families changed, before 1919 Prince, the title replacing the else usual Herr (Mr.) first name of Pless to Herr first name Fürst von Pleß. only conveniently, but legally incorrectly, still translated as Count of Hochberg, Prince of Pless into English.For example, see Berry; Hans Heinrich XVII, son of Hans Heinrich XV, applied to become a denizen of England in 1933; Berry cites the Times of London referring to him as Prince of Pless, for December 18, 1943. For the more recent history of the house, see Hansel Pless: Prisoner of History : a Life of H.S.H. Hans Heinrich XVII, 4th Prince of Pless by Michael Luke and Patrick Scrivenor. (2002) In the plebiscite of March 20, 1921 in accordance with the Treaty of Versailles about 75% of the voters in the Pless lands voted to join Poland;Koch, p.279 and the principality was awarded to Poland after the Third Silesian Uprising. The voters in the city of Pless (), however, voted to remain within Germany, with a 67% majority. The Pless land therefore became part of Second Polish Republic in 1922. The Hochberg family owned Książ (Fürstenstein) Castle until 1944. The castle and the lands were then seized by the Nazi government because the Prince of Pless, Hans Heinrich XVII moved to England in 1932 and became a British citizen and his brother Count Alexander of Hochberg, owner of Pszczyna Castle and a Polish citizen, had joined the Polish army. Fürstenstein castle was a part of the Project Riese until 1945 when it was occupied by the Red army.

It was an ancient city and former bishopric known as Zenobia and a Latin Catholic titular see. Halabiye was fortified in the 3rd century CE by Zenobia, Queen of Palmyra, after whom the site was named in Antiquity. After her revolt against the Roman Empire in 273, Halabiye was captured by the Romans and subsequently refortified as part of the Limes Arabicus, a defensive frontier of Roman Syria to protect the region mainly from Persia. The site occupies an area of , protected by massive city walls and a citadel on top of a hill. Remains of two churches, a public bath complex and two streets have been excavated. These all date to the reign of Byzantine Emperor Justinian I, who refortified the city in the 6th century AD.  History  Outer façade of the northern city wall, looking west toward the thumb =Ancient era and Middle Ages= alt=A room with well-built masonry walls and arches Halabiye site was already mentioned in the 24th century BCE archives found at Ebla. At that time, the site was known as Halabit. Zalabiye, on the oppose bank of the Euphrates, may have been known as Šalbatu. Halabit appeared on a list of cities that delivered tribute to Ebla. Given that it was the most southern city on this list, it has been suggested that the fortress may have been on Ebla's territorial boundary with its primary rival, Mari. In Neo-Assyrian sources, the toponym Birtu appears, which may be synonymous to the Birtha of the classical period, suggesting that the site was also occupied during the Neo-Assyrian period (934–608 BCE). Halabiye experienced its heyday during the Roman and Byzantine periods. Before the site was incorporated into the Palmyrene Empire, it was a Roman garrison town known as Birtha. It was taken over by Palmyra in the 3rd century CE because of its strategic location on the river where it flows through a narrow gap. According to Procopius, the city was named after the Palmyrene queen Zenobia (240–274). Halabiye was captured by the Romans in 273 CE during the war that broke out after Palmyra had asserted its independence from Rome. The fortress may have been repaired under Emperor Diocletian (244–311), who tried to strengthen the Limes Arabicus north of Palmyra, and again during the reign of Anastasius I (430–518). Emperor Justinian I (483–565) refortified Halabiye toward the end of his reign as part of his program to strengthen the border with the Sassanid Empire in the east. The earliest description is found in the De Aedificiis (\\"On Buildings\\") by Procopius, who described the fortress in the 6th century CE. Upon archaeological investigation of the site, Procopius’ description turned out to be highly accurate, suggesting that he knew the site from personal observation. Sasanian general Shahrbaraz captured the city in 610 during the Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628. After the Muslim conquest of northern Mesopotamia, the need to maintain a well-defended border along the Euphrates disappeared. The citadel on top of the hill continued to be in use to control movement in the middle Euphrates area, and was heavily modified. =Modern era= Halabiye has drawn the attention of European travelers and scholars since the mid-19th century. The English explorer Gertrude Bell passed the site on her travels in northern Mesopotamia and it was photographed by the French aerial archaeology pioneer Antoine Poidebard in the 1930s. In 1944 and 1945, the site was investigated by the French archaeologist Jean Lauffray, who drew maps and studied the ramparts and the public buildings. His team included 45 workers who were hired from a local Bedouin tribe. The team was allowed to use the tents and other necessary equipment from the German archaeological mission to Tell Halaf under Max von Oppenheim, which were placed in storage in 1939. In 1945, the excavation ended abruptly after unrest among the Bedouin workers, and the foreign team members left for Aleppo. Some of Lauffray's results were further corroborated during investigations at the site in 1987. A joint Syrian–French mission was initiated in 2006 by the Syrian Directorate- General of Antiquities and Museums (DGAM) and the Paul Valéry University from Montpellier in France. The mission was led by Sylvie Blétry. After an initial survey mission in 2006, three excavation and restoration seasons took place between 2007 and 2009. Apart from a renewed investigation and mapping of the public buildings and ramparts, the Syrian–French mission also excavated areas with residential architecture. During the 2009 season, the necropolis was also mapped, resulting in the discovery of more than 100 new tombs.  Description  Halabiye is located on the right bank of the Euphrates upstream from Deir ez-Zor at a strategic location where basalt outcrops force the river through a narrow gap. These outcrops are locally known as al-khanuqa or \\"the strangler\\". The Wadi Bishri runs along the south side of Halabiye and this route toward the desert in the west is therefore also controlled by the fortress. Some downstream lies the contemporary but smaller fortress of Zalabiye. The currently visible remains primarily date from the Byzantine occupation of the site. Halabiye is shaped like a crooked triangle with the east side parallel to the river bank of the Euphrates and the west corner on top of a hill with deep wadis on its north and south sides. The site is protected by massive walls that enclose an area of . The walls on the north and south sides are largely intact, while only remnants of the east wall are still visible. The east and west walls are still standing to elevations between . The east wall facing the river, also built to protect the town against flooding, is long and was pierced by three gates. The north wall runs from the river to the citadel on the top of a hill. It is long, protected by five towers and pierced by a gate with two towers close to the river bank. Halfway up the slope of the hill lies the praetorium, a massive, square, three-storey building incorporated in the city wall that served as barracks. The south wall runs from the citadel down to the river. It is long, guarded by ten towers and pierced by a gate similar to that in the north wall. All towers were built according to the same plan: square and with two storeys. They were accessible through covered galleries in the curtain walls and through stairways. The citadel occupies an east–west orientated, elongated area of on the top of a rocky hill. The citadel consists of two different parts: a polygonal curtain wall with flanking towers in the east and a massive rectangular building in the east. The second structure is similar to the praetorium lower on the slope of the hill. In both parts, Roman, Byzantine and Arabic masonry has been identified. The site is divided in quarters by a colonnaded north–south street connecting the gates in the north and south walls and by a second street running east–west. Northwest of where the streets cross was the forum; northeast of this crossing was a public bath complex. Two churches have been located: a large church located in the northwest quarter of the town built during Byzantine Emperor Justinian I's reign and a smaller one located in the southwest quarter that was built slightly earlier. In the area north of Halabiye, along the Euphrates, is a cemetery with numerous tower tombs and rock-cut tombs. These structures date to the late Roman period and show clear cultural influences from Palmyra. Another necropolis was located south of the city. In the absence of a nearby community that could quarry Halabiye for building materials after it was deserted, the site has primarily suffered from earthquakes and its fortifications have survived largely intact. The proposed construction of the Halabiye Dam on the Euphrates south of Halabiye will lead to the partial flooding of the site by the dam's reservoir. The Syrian government works together with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and UNESCO to reduce the impact of these construction works on the site.  Ecclesiastical history  View of wall and Euphrates. Zenobia was important enough in the Late Roman province of Syria Euphratensis Secunda to become a suffragan of its capital Sergiopolis's Metropolitan Archbishop, yet was to fade. The diocese was nominally restored in 1933 as a Latin Catholic titular bishopric Zenobia(s). The titular see was filled until 2010.

Biography Born in Quebec City, Anne Vallée completed in 1979 a bachelor's degree in biology at Laval University and took graduate studies at the University of British Columbia supported by a scholarship from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council. She chose tufted puffins as a research subject and, starting in 1980, spent her summers on Triangle Island, an ecological reserve located in the Pacific Ocean west of the north tip of Vancouver Island. She died accidentally on Triangle Island during the summer of 1982. Her work was included in the paper of Gjerdrum et al. (2003). Following her death, her family and friends created the Anne Vallée Ecological Fund, with the objective to Support field research highlighting the problems of animal ecology in relation to human settlements and activities such as agriculture, forestry, fishing and tourism. From 1983 to 2011, 45 scholarships have been awarded to student researchers from Quebec and British Columbia universities. In 1983, the British Columbia government renamed the Triangle Island Ecological reserve the Anne Vallée Triangle Island Ecological Reserve. In 2002, Alison Watt published the book The Last Island, A Naturalist's Sojourn on Triangle Island, where she recalled her experience in the summer of 1980 when she assisted Anne Vallée in her research on tufted puffins. In 2003, this book won the Edna Staebler Award for creative non-fiction. In 2006, in the process of street name harmonization following the fusion of suburbs with Quebec City, the Quebec City administration accepted the proposal of a group of citizens to rename rue Quatre-Saisons in the Sainte-Foy–Sillery borough to rue Anne-Vallée.

He served a church mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the Hawaiian Islands as a young man. He married Barbara about 1957, when he started the cleaning business. They have six children and, while they were growing up, he was a scoutmaster. The Asletts have had a ranch in McCammon, Idaho, about to the southeast of Pocatello, and a house in Hawaii, which was designed for energy conservation and to be low-maintenance. The house was photographed by the U.S. army to learn ways to create housing and barracks that are easy to maintain. Aslett is a devout Mormon, and was a bishop in the Marsh Creek Ward in the McCammon Idaho Stake. He is on the Idaho State University Museum board. Career =Varsity Facility Services= While studying at Idaho State College (now Idaho State University), Aslett formed Varsity House Cleaning Company, a janitorial service in Pocatello, Idaho, with and Arlo Luke in 1957 to help pay his college tuition. Aslett described his role as \\"crazy entrepreneur\\" and Luke as the \\"strong facilitator\\". What began as a part-time business grew to employ 30 to 50 people. One of their first business clients was Mountain State Telephone and Telegraph, now CenturyLink. Before they graduated, both men had a house and four children. The name of the organization became Varsity Contractors at some point. Aslett received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Physical Education from Idaho State in 1963. He continued to operate the business, which employed 500 people, including college students. At that time, it operated in three states and was a janitorial, facilities services, and construction company. The company also offered landscaping services. The company had 2,500 employees and operated in 14 states in 1990. It was a full- service janitorial contractor with total revenues $190 million in 2006. Arlo Luke, who had been the president and CEO for 28 years stepped down in 2011. Aslett was also not involved in the daily management of the organization by 2013. In 2011, the company changed its name to Varsity Facility Services. Arlo's son, Eric became the company's president and CEO. Now, it operates in the United States and Canada as a \\"huge building service contractor specializing in regional and national facility portfolios\\", according to Lisa Ridgely of CleanLink. In 2013, it had offices in Canada and all 50 states and stores that sell their green products in 6 states. They employed 4,000 people at that time. Varsity is now headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah. Aslett was inducted into the Idaho's Hall of Fame in 2010. Three years later, both Luke and Aslett received awards from the International Sanitary Supply Association. =Author= Aslett, considered a cleaning expert, has written 40 books on the subject, which have been published in 10 languages. Michael Boyer states that he is one of the most prolific writers of cleaning books, which cover a wide range of topics like removing clutter, caring for specific materials, eliminating spots, and establishing processes for cleaning. There are books for household and professional cleaning. Aslett says that the amount of time spent cleaning can be reduced 75% by if the homeowner were to reduce clutter, get the right cleaning tools, and make them accessible. One of his approaches is to develop a self-cleaning house, through the use of household items and flooring that are easy to maintain, and eliminating most of the dirt that comes into a house by taking one's shoes off at the door. Another way to manage cleanliness is to make each person responsible for cleaning up their own mess. He says that \\"even if President Bush stayed at my house, he'd know where the vacuum is.\\" He has acquired the nicknames of the Sultan of Shine, Don Juan of the John, and the Dean of Clean. =Museum of Clean= In November 2011, Aslett opened the Museum of Clean in a six-story building in Pocatello, Idaho, in what had been a warehouse built in 1915. It has an art gallery, 88-seat theater, and a gift shop. The museum features 6,000 historical artifacts related to cleanliness. Some of the unique items include a horse-drawn vacuum cleaner (1902), an early washing machine (1945), and a 1,600-year-old bronze toothpick. Interactive exhibits teach children how to recycle, clean their room, make their bed, and sweep. In addition to teaching recycling, the museum also has information about how to reduce waste. It cost $6 million to establish the museum and six years to assemble its collection. It was featured in a CBS News story in its \\"On the Road\\" series in 2012. During an interview, Aslett states that \\"This is not a cleaning museum, it's the museum of clean.\\" He believes that not being clean leads to depression, while removing clutter from ones' life means letting go of junk and a lifestyle of excess. He says, \\"nothing will change your life faster than when you throw away your junk. You have more time, you have more space, you feel better, you're healthier.\\" In preparation for its opening, the building was renovated to be environmentally friendly. During the renovation, 80% of the materials that were removed were recycled. The landscaping was designed to require little water. The museum has non-reflective windows and exterior LED lights, which are energy-saving. Its electric bill is about 25% of what it would have been without the modifications. A rainwater collection system supplies water for landscaping and toilets and some of the building's energy is supplied from its passive solar system. In 2013, he received the Pollution Prevention Champion Award from the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality for the environmental-friendly building. Due to a grant from Monsanto, and in partnership with the Pocatello High School, a hydroponic greenhouse will be installed on the roof of the museum by 2017. It will teach students about green energy and how plants grow. Wind turbines and solar panels will generate power, such as to provide electricity for lights during the nighttime. =Other= By the mid-1990s, Aslett was appearing on a number of television shows, like The Oprah Winfrey Show, and made 5,000 appearances to talk about cleaning. To make his talks more interesting, he seeks to entertain, covering topics such as \\"Make Your House Do the Housework\\" and \\"Clean in a Minute\\". He has also served as a motivational speaker.

Its capital was Głogów in Lower Silesia. History In 1177, under the rule of Konrad Spindleshanks, the youngest son of High Duke Władysław II the Exile of Poland, the town of Głogów had already become the capital of a duchy in its own right. However, when Konrad died between 1180 and 1190, his duchy was again inherited by his elder brother Bolesław I the Tall, Duke of Wrocław. After the death of Bolesław's grandson Duke Henry II the Pious at the 1241 Battle of Legnica his sons in 1248 divided the Lower Silesian Duchy of Wrocław among themselves. Konrad I, a child when his father died, claimed his rights too and in 1251 and received the northern Głogów territory from his elder brother Bolesław II the Bald, then Duke of Legnica. gord; brick walls were built after 1291) Under the rule of Konrad's son Henry III the principality became smaller, as fragmentation and division continued, and other, smaller duchies were split from it like Ścinawa (Steinau, Stínava) and Żagań (Sagan, Zaháň) in 1273 as well as the duchies of Oleśnica (Oels, Olešnice) and Wołów (Wohlau, Volov) in 1312. After Henry's son Przemko II had died without heirs in 1331, King John the Blind was able to seize the duchy as a fiefdom of the Kingdom of Bohemia and granted it to the Piast Duke Henry I of Jawor six years later. As Henry I left no issue, King John's son, Charles IV incorporated one half of Głogów into Crown of Bohemia, granting the remaining half to Duke Henry V of Iron of Żagań in 1349. When in 1476 the Głogów line of the Piast dynasty became extinct with the death of Henry XI, fights over his succession broke out between his cousin Duke Jan II the Mad of Żagań and Elector Albert III Achilles of Brandenburg, the father of Henry's widow Barbara of Brandenburg. In consequence the duchy's northern part of Krosno Odrzańskie (Crossen an der Oder) was incorporated by the Margraviate of Brandenburg in 1482. The truce however was broken by Duke Jan II, who continued his attacks on the neighbouring territories and in 1480 even invaded the royal Bohemian half of the Głogów duchy. This action finally brought the Bohemian antiking Matthias Corvinus to the scene, who in 1488 conquered Głogów, deposed Jan II and made his son János the duke. Upon Matthias' death in 1490 his territories were reacquired by Bohemian king Vladislaus II Jagiellon, who granted the fief of Głogów to his brothers John I Albert in 1491 and later Sigismund I the Old in 1499, both future kings of Poland. In 1506 the duchy finally became an immediate dominion of the Bohemian Crown, which, after Vladislaus' son Louis II Jagiellon had died in 1526, were inherited by Archduke Ferdinand I of Austria and became part of the Habsburg Monarchy. Głogów remained part of the Crown of Bohemia within the province of Silesia until the end of the First Silesian War in 1742 when, like the majority of Silesia, it became part of Frederick the Great's Kingdom of Prussia (which was definitively confirmed by the Treaty of Aachen in 1748). Even the Seven Years' Wardid not change this status. In 1815 the Duchy (along with other Silesian duchies) ceased to exist due to radical administrative reform. All of Silesia was unified into a single administrative unit, Province of Silesia (Provinz Schlesien). Finally, after World War II the territories of Prussian Silesia east of the Oder-Neisse line were granted to Poland by the Allied Powers under the Potsdam Agreement.

Origins The origins of the town of Roberton are intertwined with those of the Robertons of that Ilk, Earnock, Bedlay and Lauchope. Black 1965 describes the etymology as literally 'the Town of Robert'. This Robert was brother of Lambin Asa, who was the progenitor of the Earls of Loddon and Lamington. Ritchie 1954, Reid 1928 and Grant 2007 assert the origins of Robert as a Flemish feudal vassal of Baldwin of Biggar. It is first mentioned in a charter by Wice of Wiston tything it to Malcolm IV (Reid 1928). Grant dates ‘Robert, brother of Lambin’ as the first lord c.1157. = Brother of Lambin Asa = The Chartulary of Kelso gives Robert as the brother of Lambyn Asa who was the Laird of Lesmahagow. Lambyn appears to have held lands in and around Lesmahagow (the regal barony), including what became the barony of Lamington, alongside William Comyn at or around the time the grant of Lesmahagow was made to the Abbey of Kelso by David I. As a consequence Lambyn became the Laird of Lesmahagow and the minor baronies were then divided up between his family and associates with terms based on the original grant of the lands of Draffan to Lambyn and then to his son James. It seems Lambyn had previously been in Yorkshire, as were Theobald and Baldwin, where his family had become Lords of Multon under the Earl of Richmond. Theobald took the grant of Douglas (from whom descends the famous Douglas family), Baldwin became Sheriff of Biggar and subsequently married the widow of Reginald, illegitimate son of Alan, Earl of Richmond, who had taken land which subsequently became the barony of CrawfordJohn in the possession of John son of Reginald and stepson of Baldwin. The precise family relationship of Theobald and Baldwin to Lambyn Asa is not clear, especially as Robert is specifically stated to be his brother and Eustace of Ardoch to be a member of his family. For reference, consult the Cartulary of Kelso from the Bannatyne Club (Liber S Marie de Calchou), Annals of Lesmahagow (J B Greenshields) and Burkes Commoners. The Barony It became the seat of the Robertons of that ilk until their dispossession by Robert I for Stephen de Robertoun's signing of the 1296 Ragman Roll. It was subsequently bestowed upon Sir James Douglas, ancestor of the Earls of Morton (Beverage n.d.). The Parish Roberton was a parish town chartered by Kelso Abbey (Reid 1928),(Beverage). Historically it was an Established Church of Scotland. It merged with Wiston in 1772, and became a United Presybterian Church in 1847. In 1843 a Free Church was established that dwindled, ultimately belonging to the Presbytery of Jedburgh by 1880 (Familysearch) alt= The Roberton church and graveyard from the street below In the mid 1990s the church was purchased by musician John Martyn, who converted it into a recording studio, and recorded his 1998 album \\"The Church With One Bell\\" there.

In 1654 he was sent to the court as confessor of Louis XIV, and, after the faithful discharge of the duties of his office, he felt compelled to resign, owing to the King's extramarital relationship with the Duchess de la Vallière. He became known to the academic world in 1632, by a publication of a defense of the Jesuit doctrine of Divine grace against the Oratorian Gibieuf. In 1644 he began a series of more lengthy contributions of the famous controversy that sought to reconcile human freedom with Divine efficacious grace.

It was established in 1889 in order to gain basic legal status, during the period when the New Hebrides was a neutral territory under the loose jurisdiction of a joint Anglo-French naval commission. In 1878, the United Kingdom and France declared all of the New Hebrides to be neutral territory. For the protection of the French and British citizens in New Hebrides, a joint naval commission was established under the Convention of 16 October 1887. However, the convention claimed no jurisdiction over internal native affairs. The lack of a functional government led to rising discontent among the colonists. The French were especially inconvenienced because French law only recognized marriages when contracted under a civil authority (the nearest one being in New Caledonia), whereas British law recognized marriages conducted by local clergy.

He made contribution to economic botany and helped shape American scientific policy of the time on plant and exploration research. Biography Coville was born in 1867 in Preston, New York to bank director Joseph Addison Coville and his wife Lydia. He went to Cornell University, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1887. He briefly taught botany before joining the USDA and participating to the Geological Survey of Arkansas as assistant botanist in 1888. He would remain with the department until his death, succeeding to George Vasey as Chief botanist in 1893, a title accompanied with that of Honorary Curator of the National Herbarium (at the time conserved at the Smithsonian Institution, but funded by the USDA). Coville married his wife, Elizabeth Harwood Boyton, in 1890; they had five children, four of which, three sons and a daughter, survived their father. Over the course of his life, he published approximately 170 papers and books; he also contributed to botany entries of the Century Dictionary. A tall man who had enjoyed success in college sports, he was described as helpful, perceptive, clear-thinking and curious, as well as greatly enthusiastic in his outdoor expeditions. Coville participated in the 1891 Death Valley Expedition led by C. Hart Merriam and T. S. Palmer, his resulting Botany of the Death Valley Expedition (1893) is an important work on desert plants. He traveled a lot in the Western United States and grew an interest for desert and medicinal plants, leading to his 1897-1898 Medicinal Plants Survey. Gifford Pinchot called a report of Coville's on effects of grazing on forest \\"the essentials of a sound and farsighted grazing policy\\". Coville also participated in and wrote on the 1899 Harriman Alaska Expedition, although he never completed his Flora of Alaska. He was involved with the establishment of the Carnegie Institution's Desert Botanical Laboratory in 1903, the USDA Seed Laboratory, and spearheaded efforts that lead to the foundation of the United States National Arboretum in 1927. Former Washington, D.C. residence of Frederick Vernon Coville Coville was considered the American authority on Juncaceae and Grossulariaceae. After 1910 he began to work on blueberry, and was the first to discover the importance of soil acidity (blueberries need highly acidic soil), that blueberries do not self-pollinate, and the effects of cold on blueberries and other plant. In 1911, he began a program of research in conjunction with Elizabeth White, daughter of the owner of the extensive cranberry bogs at Whitesbog in the New Jersey Pine Barrens. His work doubled the size of some strains' fruit, and by 1916, he had succeeded in cultivating blueberries, making them a valuable crop in the Northeastern United States. For this work he received the George Roberts White Medal of Honor from the Massachusetts Horticultural Society. In 1919, Coville played an instrumental role in drawing attention to the threatened state of the only known box huckleberry colony, sparking a revival of interest that led to the discovery of many new specimens of the plant. From 1920 to his death, he was chairman of the National Geographic Society' Research Committee and was very influential in deciding areas of exploration. At the time of his death he was working on a revision of Botany of the Death Valley Expedition as a flora of the Valley. Coville's papers are split between several archives. Many (including his revision notes for Botany of the Death Valley Expedition) are kept at the Smithsonian Institution, Others at the National Arboretum. His personal library is now part of the University of Wyoming's special collections library, while his Death Valley Expedition field diary is kept at UC Berkeley. Amongst several plants named after him are Eriogonum covilleanum, Amelanchier covillei, Cheilanthes covillei, Sidalcea covillei, Enceliopsis covillei, Juncus covillei and Lupinus covillei. A genus Covillea was also named after him, but is now considered a synonym of Larrea.

History On 17 September 1806, when The Netherlands were under the rule of King Louis Napoleon, he decided that the striking and distribution of coins should be by a single, national body.By Royal decree no. 18 This was in contrast to the Middle Ages custom of large trading cities having their own mint and coins, which resulted in several coins circulating within the country, and many levels of controlling bureaucracy. Originally it was the intention to found the mint in the capital city of Amsterdam but, since there was insufficient finance available, it was decided to locate the National Mint seat in Utrecht. After Napoleon was defeated in 1813, and the Kingdom of the Netherlands was founded with William I as King, the Mint was renamed as 's Rijks Munt.

Relations with Mozart and Beethoven It is possible that Countess Thun first met Mozart in 1762, when she was 18 and he was seven; this was during an early concert tour of the Mozart family, carried out to display their children as musical prodigies; the young Mozart performed in her father's home. In 1781, when the 25-year-old Mozart moved permanently to Vienna to pursue his career, he and Thun became friends (they ate lunch together frequently).Keefe Mozart wrote of her to his father Leopold (24 March 1781), \\"[she is] the most charming and lovable lady I have ever met; and I am very high in her favor.\\"Irving 1997, 166 He frequently performed in her home, and she lent him her excellent Stein piano when Mozart performed before the Emperor in competition with Muzio Clementi on 24 December 1781. Thun may have played an essential role in Mozart's career when she arranged for him to perform extracts from his recent (1780) opera Idomeneo in her home before a set of guests that included Count Orsini-Rosenberg, the manager of the Imperial Theater. The Count \\"applauded warmly\\",Source: Abert 2007. Gottfried van Swieten, an important future patron of Mozart, was also in the audience. and not long thereafter gave his agreement to the plans to commission Mozart for the opera Die Entführung aus dem Serail, which turned out (1782) to be his first great success in Vienna. As Mozart composed the work, Countess Thun listened with encouragement to each of three acts of the opera, performed on the piano by Mozart in her home, as he completed them.

The current structure was built in 1593 by Clan Barclay. The site was given to the Clan in the 11th century by Malcolm III of Scotland. Following Clan Barclay's pillage of a nunnery in the 12th century, Thomas the Rhymer proclaimed: \\"Towie Barclay of the Glen/Happy to the maids/But never to the men.\\", which was interpreted as a curse on the male line. Belief in the curse was strong enough that it was given as a reason by Mr. Barclay Maitland for the sale of Towie Barclay Castle in 1753 to the Earl of Findlater, who, after \\"dreeing the weird,\\" (the weird, meaning the curse) and after his son also died, sold it to Gordon's Hospital in Aberdeen in 1792. The building was sold to the governors of Robert Gordon's hospital in Aberdeen for £21,000. Despite a reroofing project in 1874, Towie Barclay Castle had fallen into a state of neglect by the mid-20th century. Nineteenth Century Description and History An excellent description of the castle was written in 1887, published in volume two of the book The Castellated and Domestic Architecture of Scotland from the Twelfth to the Eighteenth Century by David MacGibbon and Thomas Ross, published by D. Douglas: > This interesting house is in the southern part of the parish of Turriff, and > not far from the Auchterless railway station. > > The family of Tollie de Berkley, to whom it belonged, is very ancient, and > the following inscription on a stone built into the wall has given the > impression that the castle is also of very old date, viz., “Sir Alexander > Barclay of Tolly, foundator, deceisit anno domini 1186.” On the same stone > is carved the following inscription: “In tim of Valth al men semis friendly > and frindis not knauin but in adversity, 1593.” > > There can be no doubt that the first part of the above inscription is a > mere record of what had happened long before, and was inserted at the date > last quoted, “1593.” In 1792 the turrets and embrasures were removed and two > stories taken off the height of the keep, and the fosse filled up. > > The family suffered from espousing Queen Mary’s cause. From 1558 to 1624 > the estate was held by Patrick Barclay, who was the author of the moral > reflection above quoted,--the result of his unfortunate experience. > > The plan of this castle is a slight modification of the plain quadrangular > keep, a small break being made in the wall adjoining the entrance door. This > gives room for the passage to the staircase, and also admits of a loophole > commanding the entrance. The ingoing of this loophole is defended internally > with a stone pillar, so placed as to permit those inside to see out, and at > the same time os designed as to intercept missiles from without. > > The basement is all vaulted, and the vault over the small entrance lobby is > ornamented with ribbed and groined vaulting. The latter peculiarity seems to > be local. A similar loop next the doorway, and groined vault in the entrance > lobby, exists at Gight, and a corresponding ribbed vault at the original > entrance still remains at Delgaty. > > The basement contains the usually cellars, with small loopholes, one cellar > having a private stair to the hall. > > The principal staircase leading to the first floor is partly straight, with > a wheel round the corner of the tower and a good landing at the door to the > hall. The hall is of the usual form, but is much more ornate than in most > castles. It is 30 feet by 20 feet, and is vaulted in two compartments, with > a groined and ribbed vault, springing from corbels carved with foliage. > There is also a small and carefully finished and vaulted gallery in the > thickness of the wall over the door to the hall, with a wide opening towards > the hall. The gallery has ribbed vaulting, and the bosses are carved with > the monogram I.H.S., and with a heart and the pierced hands and feet of our > Savior. The corvels from which the ribs spring have shields containing the > emblems of the four Evangelists. On each side of the opening towards the > hall are canopied niches for statues. Everything seems to point to this > gallery having been an oratory or chapel. It is entered by a small stair > from the floor above, so that the baron and his family might use it > privately, or by drawing a curtain it might be opened to the hall, when all > assembled there might witness the service. > > Billings’ view of the interior gives a good idea of these features, which > all seem to point to the work having been designed by some one accustomed to > ecclesiastical architecture. Groined vaulting of the kind here adopted is > rare in the castles of Scotland, but one other example occurs at Balbegno in > Kincardineshire, which is of the same period. The hall of Auchendoun was > also vaulted in a similar manner, but it belongs to an earlier period. From > the ecclesiastical features of the building Mr. Billings infers that it is > at least a century earlier than the date upon it (1593). But from the > similarity of the vaulting at Balbegno, the date of which is 1569, and from > the correspondence of the plan, and the little ribbed vault at the entrance, > with such castles as Gight and Delgaty, we have no hesitation in assigning > it to the middle of the sixteenth century. At Edzell too we find ribbed and > groined vaulting in the summer-house, along with features which are > undoubtedly of the latter half of the sixteenth century. > > There is a small private room over the entrance lobby. As already > mentioned, the upper floors have been altered or removed. (pages 51-52) Restoration The castle was bought in the 1970s by the Musician Marc Ellington and his wife, Karen. A programme of restoration was funded by Marc Ellington's music career while his wife project-managed the extensive restorative work on the building, which took over 7 years to complete. While the lower story contains sixteenth century masonry, the upper floors are a modern reconstruction. The restoration project was of a sufficiently high standard to win a Saltire Society Award in 1973. As of 2008, the castle remains in the ownership of the Ellington Family. In addition to owning Towie Barclay, the Ellingtons are also Lairds of Gardenstown and Crovie. Bibliography MacGibbon, David and Thomas Ross.

Precedents :See also Govern d'Euzkadi (in Catalan). During the Spanish Civil War, the Second Spanish Republic had allowed an autonomous government in those Basque areas of Spain that had not been taken by the Nationalist (later Francoist) side, i.e., Biscay and parts of Gipuzkoa. This government was formed by Basque nationalists (EAJ-PNV and Acción Nacionalista Vasca) and leftists (the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party and Communist Party). In 1937, the Basque Army surrendered in Santoña to the Italian Corpo Truppe Volontari and the Basque leaders who managed to escape went to Catalonia or France. After the defeat of the Republican side (1 April 1939), the free Basque leaders were refuged in Europe and the Americas. Later in 1939, the German invasion of Poland unleashed the Second World War. France quickly fell before the Wehrmacht. Under a false identity, the Basque President José Antonio Aguirre traveled north from France trying to sail to the United States. The plan At this time, Irujo promoted a Basque National Council (Consejo Nacional de Euzkadi/Euzkadi'ko Batzar Nagusia, formally established on 11 July 1940) inspired by the exile governments and committees forming among European refugees in Britain. Expecting that Francoist Spain would join the Axis in the war, Irujo bet on an Allied victory and tried to establish a provisional authority capable of negotiating a new status for the Basque Country with the British government, the Free French and the eventual Spanish government. He established an alliance with Catalan nationalists in Britain who had formed their own Catalan National Council. He planned to have the south of the Pyrenees divided between a Basque state and a Catalan one and so presented a joint declaration on 18 January 1941 before the British Minister of State. He redacted a \\"foreproject for a Constitution of the Basque Republic\\". It would be an independent state as a democratic republic. Its territory would cover that of the Kingdom of Navarre under Sancho the Greater, excluding the French Basque country to gain the support of Charles de Gaulle. Its limits would be: Domains of Sancho III the Greater. The Basque Republic would cover most of the red area and some of the pink areas. :...on the North the Pyrenees and the Bay of Biscay, on the Easte the Gállego river, on the South the Ebro river until Gallur and the water divisory between the Ebro and the Duero basins from Moncayo on the whole extension of both vertients, and on the West cape Ajo (Peña Cantábrica). :Title I, Article 5. This would include areas of Burgos, Cantabria, Rioja and Aragon whose Basqueness was at most historic and where Basque nationalism was inexistent. The Basque state would be relatively interventionist, protectionist and paternalist, following the social doctrine of the Catholic Church as assumed by the Basque Nationalist Party. Article 52 of Title V marked the requirements for the President of the Republic: :...male, citizen of the state, son of parents of Basque nature and ancestry, counting at least thirty years of age and being in the full enjoyment of his civil and political rights. An additional chapter opened a chance to join other territories: :The Cortes are authorized to stipulate with democratic state representations of the continental Basque Country and the peninsular nations, the agreed regime of a confederal character que suits the right of the Basque Nation... Irujo would later try to negotiate with the Free French the creation of a Basque Battalion, dissolved formally on 23 May 1942. Criticism In October 1942, the news of the safe arrival of Aguirre in Uruguay reached London. At the Basque World Congress of Paris (1956), he would thank the labour of the Basque National Council, but his politics would not follow Irujo's Constitution. It would be the Socialist Indalecio Prieto who would harshly criticize Irujo's irredentism.Imperialismo vasco. El nuevo mapa de Euzkadi, Indalecio Prieto, Excélsior, 20 July 1943. Quoted in HGdPV and Jiménez de Aberasturi. Reproduced at the weblog of Iñaki Anasagasti. He remarks that the Cantabrian ports of Castro-Urdiales, Laredo, and Santoña, along with the industry of Reinosa, would be part of Euzkadi. He likens Irujo's map to Hitler's and shows his surprise because Laburdi and Zuberoa, areas of the French Basses Pyrenees where Basque is spoken, are left out of the new state. In the same Mexican newspaper, Julio Jauregui denies the accusations of separatism, interpreting Irujo's foreproject as a confederal blueprint. Jauregui remarks that the democratic will of the newly annexed citizens would be necessary, just as some people in Logroño are showing interest in the Basque autonomy projects. After the dissolution of the BNC by Aguirre, Irujo would dedicate himself to literature and a project for an Iberian Community of Nations, including Portugal, that did not have much echo.

Starring Nino Manfredi, it was not released in USA until 1986. The score was composed by Armando Trovajoli. Plot In October 1867, the papal Rome, led by Pius IX, is shaken by a bomb attack carried out in the sewers of the barracks of Palazzo Serristori, which kills twenty-three French Papal Zouaves. A countess, the secret mother of revolutionary Cesare Costa, who is accused with friends Giuseppe Monti and Gaetano Tognetti of having organised this massacre, goes to a judge of the Holy See, Bishop of Priverno Colombo, asking him to help her. To overcome the resistance of the Prelate, she tells him that he is the father of the accused, born during their short affair in 1849. The prelate is able to release him, hiding him in his house along with his girlfriend, but he is not able to intervene in favor of the other two arrested to be sentenced to death by the ecclesiastical court, despite an eloquent speech pronounced in front of the court. This speech causes a severe reprimand by the Pope and the General of the Jesuits, at that time called \\"the Black Pope\\" (il Papa Nero) due to the strong power exercised by this Order on the papacy. At the end, however, Cesare Costa is shot in an ambush by the husband of the countess who believed him to be his wife's lover. Finally, Colombo cites a letter full of bitterness and resentment that he would like to write to the Pope, but to no avail, because of his perpetual cry for sorrow. The movie ends when Colombo breaks with the general of the Society of Jesus, since during a holy Mass he is celebrating, Colombo refuses to administer the Holy Eucharist (communion) to the Jesuit's General, who appears in Church to arrest Colombo. The film describes how advanced the decrepitude of the temporal power and its laws in papal Rome. As an example, after the above-mentioned speech of Monsignor Colombo, one of the old cardinals is awakened from his deep sleep, just to vote in favour of the death penalty of Monti and Tognetti. This power will fall three years later with the Breach of Porta Pia.

Life Salomea was the daughter of the Swabian count Henry of Berg Castle near Ehingen (not to be confused with the Rhenish County of Berg) by his wife Adelaide of Mochental (d. 1125/27), probably a sister of Margrave Diepold III of Vohburg. According to some sources, her paternal grandmother was Princess Sophia, only daughter of King Solomon of Hungary by his wife Judith of Swabia (by her second marriage stepmother of Salome's husband), but this hypothesis has been rejected by modern historiographers. The marriage of Salome's sister Richeza with Duke Vladislav I of Bohemia in 1110 had changed the status of the relative obscure Count Henry of Berg in political affairs. Another sister, Sophia, was married to a Moravian member of the Přemyslid dynasty, Duke Otto II the Black of Olomouc, in 1113. =Marriage= The Polish ruler Bolesław III Wrymouth, after he had begun to expand his domains in the Pomerelian region, decided to normalize his relations with his southern Bohemian neighbors. This took place in 1114 at a great convention on the border river Nysa Kłodzka. Participants included Bolesław III himself, as well as the Bohemian and Moravian Dukes of the Přemyslid line: Vladislav I, Otto II the Black and Vladislav's younger brother Soběslav I. It was decided that the Duke of Poland (a widower since 1112) should secondly marry the Swabian noblewoman Salomea, sister of the Duchesses of Bohemia and Olomouc. The marriage negotiations, led by Bishop Otto of Bamberg, ended successfully, and between March and July 1115 the wedding of Bolesław III Wrymouth and Salomea of Berg took place. By the end of that year, the new Duchess gave birth to a son named Leszek (d. 1131), the first of the thirteen children who she bore to her husband. Salomea began to participate actively in the Polish politics on behalf of her children; she feared that according to the primogeniture principle her stepson Władysław II, Bolesław III's first-born son from his marriage with Zbyslava of Kiev, would succeed his father as sole ruler and her sons would be at the mercy of their elder half-brother. In 1125 the powerful Piotr Włostowic was forced to resign his post of a Polish Voivode (Count palatine); the main instigator of this decision was probably Salomea, who replaced him with Wszebor, a man she considered more likely to support herself and her sons against Władysław. =Bolesław III's Testament= Bolesław III died on 28 October 1138. In his will he had divided the country between his sons according to the principle of agnatic seniority, giving the Seniorate Province of Kraków to his eldest son Władysław II. In addition Salomea received the town of Łęczyca, several castles and towns throughout Poland (including Pajęczno, Małogoszcz, Radziejów, Kwieciszewo) as her ' (Widow's seat or wittum); this was the first documented case where a Polish ruler left his widow her own piece of land. The terms of the stated that the beneficiary could obtain the full sovereignty over the land for her life, and could lose it in two cases: if she remarried or became a nun (abdication would not count). The youngest child of the couple, Casimir II, was not assigned a province; it is speculated that he was born after Bolesław III's death. =Later Years= From her domains in Łęczyca, the now Dowager Duchess continue her intrigues against her stepson High Duke Władysław II. However, the hostilities only began openly in 1141, when Salomea, without the knowledge and consent of the High Duke, commenced to divide Łęczyca between her sons. Also, she tried to resolve the marriage of her youngest daughter Agnes and thus to find a suitable ally for her sons. The most appropriate candidate for a son-in-law had to be Sviatoslav III, the son of Grand Prince Vsevolod II of Kiev. After hearing the news about the events in Łęczyca, Władysław II decided to make a quick response, as a result of which the Grand Prince of Kiev not only broke all his pacts with the Junior Dukes, but also arranged the betrothal of his daughter Zvenislava to Władysław's eldest son Bolesław I the Tall. The wedding took place one year later, in 1142. Salomea died at her mansion in Łęczyca on 27 July 1144. In accordance with the will of Boleslaw III, her province of Łęczyca reverted to the Senoriate. Unexpectedly, her bitter enemy Piotr Włostowic allied with her sons against High Duke Władysław II, who, after having captured and blinded Włostowic in 1145, was defeated and deposed by his half-brothers. Salomea's oldest surviving son, Bolesław IV the Curly became the new High Duke of Poland in 1146.

J. Alhabeeb) (born مصدق جميل آل حبيب on in southern Iraq) is an Iraqi American contemporary calligrapher who follows the original traditions in Arabic-Islamic calligraphy. He is self-taught, and never studied under any master calligrapher, according to the traditional norm. Biography Alhabeeb's interest in the Arabic and Islamic calligraphy started early on when he was a child. Before he attended school at age five, he started to imitate the letters penned by his older brother who was interested in calligraphy too. He received great encouragement and praise from his second grade art teacher, who after discovering the child's early talent, started to ask him to show other students the right shape of letters on the blackboard. Alhabeeb soon discovered the famous instructional book in calligraphy by Iraq's prominent calligrapher Hashim Muhammad Al-Baghdadi. He started to repeatedly imitate Al-Baghdadi's letters and follow his method in perfecting the shapes and movements of many Arabic script. He continued to practice this regular routine for many years. Despite the fact that he chose economics as a field of study, and went to become a full professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, he has been practicing calligraphy for more than four decades. Personal Style Although he practices classic calligraphy, his own style has been distinguished by a contemporary flare. The most notable aspect of his artistic style is the striking use of color, which has been scarcely used in the classic tradition, as calligraphy work remained dominated by black and white, with occasional use of gold and turquoise. Alhabeeb's extensive web site which includes a history of the development of Arabic script, has also an artist's statement, which highlights the major aspects of Alhabeeb's own style. In this statement, Alhabeeb states: “I tend to describe my work of calligraphy as \\"neo-classical\\" for maintaining the methods, manners, and techniques of the classic calligraphers since the 8th century, but I also follow a quasi-modern and personal approach,hdfhjv which could be characterized by: * The utilization of Arabesque (Az-Zakhrafah Al- Arabia) as an integrative element of calligraphy, compared to its traditional employment. I define the traditional employment of Arabesque as either an occasional and partial use in a decorative framework out of the calligraphy space, or a full Deco art, unconnected to calligraphy, but standing by its own merit. In my integrative approach, I believe only a minimum use of selected motifs of arabesque is needed for my calligraphy projects to be functional and attuned. These motifs involve intricate ornamental patterns of interlaced lines and forms, often in botanical shapes such as stems, foliage and buds. They can perfectly lend themselves to the structural subtlety of lines and space of the written words, adding grace and luster, and allowing for the use of color. Colors of the calligraphy background are mostly dark, specifically the traditional solid black, and the foreground are mostly white or other light colors. Bright colors are also sporadically and carefully used, especially in the internal spacious frames, small motifs, and in the grammatical dots (An-Nuqat). All of these components are harmonized in a single integrative structure to present the calligraphy work as one unit. I believe that the major purpose for employing colors is to enhance the visual sensory and illuminate the fundamental cohesiveness of the image. Moreover, a modified minimum use of arabesque and color is essential to help emphasize the artistic abstract form of the epigraphical composition, without forcing the stylistic piece into becoming a mere decorative art. * Another supporting element to this approach is the minimization of the text, which is deliberately sought to maximize the effectiveness of using the words as single components in a whole image. One justification for using a minimal text stems from my view that as the text becomes longer, the fragmentation of the image increases, and the control and manageability of the creative process become increasingly limited. * The innovative use of image repetition, symmetry, and the mirror effect. While these techniques are not new, reinvigorating and combining them with other methods and techniques is, and it is evident in my work. Influences On his influences, Alhabeeb states: “My strong influences and inspirations were the towering talents of several generations of magnificent calligraphers and their distinct styles. The most important of these influences have been the calligraphers of the contemporary Baghdadi School spearheaded by Hashim Muhammad Al-Khattat Al-Baghdadi, and the earlier Ottoman School, represented by Sheikh Hamadullah Al-Amasi and a bunch of innovative star calligraphers who followed him. Painting vs. Calligraphy In addition to being a classic calligrapher, Alhabeeb is a contemporary painter. Unlike many of his colleagues; painters who utilize the shape and style of the Arabic letters and words, and calligraphers who borrow some of the painting methods and styles, Alhabeeb does not mix calligraphy with painting. He treats them separately as independent genres, each with its own tradition and style. His calligraphy stays close to the classic Arabic and Islamic old school, which is free of any painting techniques. On the other hand, His painting has been described as Neo-cubism for borrowing and utilizing many of the cubists’ techniques. He worked as a graphic designer for many years, and won the first prize in three different national contests for designing postal stamps. He has published numerous articles on art theory and philosophy, and recently released a book in Arabic entitled “Art, Creativity, and Freedom”. Publications *Alhabeeb, M.J. (2009).

The Kandhamal district contains several tribal reservations where only tribal people can own land. The largest community in Kandhamal is the Kandha tribe. Most Kandha tribal people follow tribal and animistic forms of Hinduism. However, the socio- economic and political landscape of Kandhamal is dominated by its second- largest community, the non-tribal Pana caste. The region is also home to the Maoist guerrillas, a revolutionary communist movement. Maoist leader Sabyasachi Panda stated groups tend to recruit most of their leaders and cadre insurgents from tribal communities. He reiterated the Maoists's religious position: \\"We do not believe in any religion or are attached to any religious groups. We are not in favour of any religion.\\"'Majority of Maoist supporters in Odisha are Christians' The Hindu - 5 October 2008 Major issues in Kandhamal that have led to tensions are claims that \\"The Scheduled Caste and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act\\" is violated. Such claims include the forcible occupation of tribal land, fake issuance of tribal certificates, illegal building of places of worship (mostly churches) on tribal land, religious conversions, and exploiting tribals for insurgent activities. This previously resulted in civil unrest and communal tensions in 1986, 1994 and 2001. Background =Historical background of conversions= Franciscan missionary Friar Odoric visited India in the 14th century and wrote about his visit to Puri in a journal which he later published in Europe. In the journal, Odoric wrote in detail about a huge chariot containing idols of Hindu deities from the grand and famous Jagannath temple which is taken out annually in a procession known as the rath yatra. Odoric's account of the ceremony spread throughout Europe and by the 19th century the word juggernaut began to be associated with an unstoppable force of such proportions that is capable of destroying everything in its path. Subsequently, Baptist missionaries came to Odisha in 1822 during the British Empire's colonial rule over India.A Narrative of the Mission to Orissa: (the Site of the Temple of Jugurnath): Supported by the New Connexion of General Baptists in England By Amos Sutton, Published by David Marks for the Free-will Baptist Connexion, 1833 =After India's independence= The communal disharmony arose even before Indian independence in 1947 on aforementioned issue of religious conversion. Conversions have been legislated by the provisions of the Freedom of Religion Acts (acts replicated in numerous other parts through India). Odisha was the first provinces of independent India to enact legislation in regards to religious conversions. The Orissa Freedom of Religion Act, 1967, mentions that no person shall \\"convert or attempt to convert, either directly or otherwise, any person from one religious faith to another by the use of force or by inducement or by any fraudulent means\\". Christian missions have been active in Odisha among the tribals and backward Hindu castes from the early years of the twentieth century.Right-wing Hindus have alleged that the increase in the number of Christians in Odisha has been a result of exploitation of illiteracy and impoverishment by the missionaries in contravention of the law, instead of free will. =Conversion controversy= Behind the clashes are long-simmering tensions between equally impoverished groups: the Kandha tribe, who are 80% of the population, and the Pana. Both are original inhabitants of the land. There has been an Indian tradition of untouchability. Dalits, considered lower caste people, are subject to social and economic discrimination. This is outlawed in the Indian constitution. The prejudices remain. Conversion from untouchability has encouraged millions of such people to escape from their circumstances through joining other religions. The Panas have converted to Christianity in large numbers and prospered financially . Over the past several decades, most of the Panas have become Dalit Christians. Hindu nationalist groups have blamed the violence on the issue of religious conversion. Conversions have been legislated by the provisions of the Freedom of Religion Acts, replicated in some of the states in India. Odisha was the first state of independent India to enact legislation on religious conversions. The Orissa Freedom of Religion Act, 1967, stipulates that 'no person shall \\"convert or attempt to convert, either directly or otherwise, any person from one religious faith to another by the use of force or by inducement or by any fraudulent means\\"'. Hindus claim the Christian missionaries were converting poor tribal people by feeding them beef, which is taboo in Hinduism. The missionaries would upgrade the mud houses of the converts into brick-lime. Hindus have further alleged that the increase in the number of Christians in Odisha has been a result of exploitation of illiteracy and impoverishment by the missionaries. The Census of India shows that Christian population in Kandhamal grew from around 43,000 in 1981 to 117,950 in 2001.Basic Data Sheet District Kandhamal (21), Orissa (21) Census of India 2001 Staines killing Graham Staines was an Australian Christian missionary working with the Evangelical Missionary Society of Mayurbhanj, an Australian missionary society that was engaged in the education of poor and illiterate Hindu tribes in Odisha. He also worked among the leprosy patients in the region. On the night of 22 January 1999, he was sleeping in his station wagon when it was set afire. Graham and his two sons, ten-year-old Philip and six- year-old Timothy, were killed. Dara Singh, a Hindu fundamentalist from Etawah in Uttar Pradesh, was arrested for the crime. On 22 September 2003 a court appointed by the Central Bureau of Investigation sentenced Dara Singh to death and 12 others to life imprisonment for the murders. Dara Singh, as an active Bajrang Dal follower, was suspected of being involved in a larger conspiracy. However, the Wadhwa Commission ruled out the involvement of any organization in the killings. In May 2005, the Odisha High Court commuted Singh's sentence to life imprisonment. The murders were widely condemned by religious and civic leaders, politicians, and journalists. The US-based Human Rights Watch accused the then Indian Government of failing to prevent violence against Christians, and of exploiting sectarian tensions for political ends. The organisation said attacks against Christians increased \\"significantly\\" since the \\"Hindu Nationalist\\" BJP came to power. Then-Prime Minister of India, Atal Behari Vajpayee, a leader of BJP, condemned the \\"ghastly attack\\" and called for swift action to catch the killers. Published reports stated that church leaders alleged the attacks were carried out at the behest of hardline Hindu organisations. Hindu hardliners accused Christian missionaries of forcibly converting poor and low-caste Hindus and tribals. The convicted killer Dara Singh was treated as a hero by hardline Hindus and reportedly protected by some villagers. In an interview with the Hindustan Times, one of the accused killers, Mahendra Hembram, stated that the killers \\"were provoked by the \\"corruption of tribal culture\\" by the missionaries, who they claimed fed villagers beef and gave women brassieres and sanitary towels.\\" In her affidavit before the Commission on the death of her husband and two sons, Gladys Staines stated: \\"The Lord God is always with me to guide me and help me to try to accomplish the work of Graham, but I sometimes wonder why Graham was killed and also what made his assassins behave in such a brutal manner on the night of 22nd/23rd January 1999. It is far from my mind to punish the persons who were responsible for the death of my husband Graham and my two children. But it is my desire and hope that they would repent and would be reformed.\\" Ranalai incident On 16 March 1999 a Hindu mob of 5,000 attacked Ranalai (PIN – 761 017) in Gajapati District and set houses on fire Tehelka magazine Vol 5, Issue 36, Dated Sept 13, 2008Volume 16 – Issue 8, 10 – 23 Apr 1999, India’s National Magazine from the publishers of THE HINDU and engaged in looting. Three Christian people were injured. The then Chief Minister of Odisha, Sri Giridhar Gamang, visited the village the next day. December 2007 = Incident at Brahmanigaon, Phulbani on 24 December = In December 2007, Christians had installed a Christmas arch across the road in the town of Brahmanigaon, Kandhamal district, having first received a permit from the police and sub-collector to do so. On 24 December 2007 a group of 150–200 Hindus arrived at the town market and demanded that the arch be removed. The protesters argued that the arch along with a tent set up was erected on the very site used by the Hindus to celebrate the Durga Puja festival in October. Protesters then sought to close the weekly market and attempted to close all the shops in the area. The Christian shopkeepers refused to comply with this, leading to an outbreak of violence. More than 20 shops were looted and destroyed. Three persons were killed. =Attack on Swami Laxmanananda= The violence escalated after news spread about Hindu monk Swami Laxmanananda Saraswati being attacked by Christian fundamentalist mob en route to the spot of the confrontation. Saraswati stated that he had left for Brahmanigaon to boost the \\"morale of the majority community\\". The National Commission for Minorities, in its report, stated that this was \\"indicative of his desire to exacerbate communal tensions\\". Swami supporters, however, claimed that Christians at Brahmanigoan village wanted to install a Christmas gate in front of a Hindu temple. This was protested by the local Hindus questioning the motive of Christians in building a second gate near temple while one gate being already present at the place. In his statement, Swami blamed Radhakant Nayak, a recent Christian convert and Congress Member of Parliament (Upper House) that allegedly led to further clashes between Hindus and Christians. The authorities imposed a curfew in order to control the situation. Concerned with rising violence, after the assault on Saraswati, some Dalit Christian leaders lodged a complaint with the Police for protection. =Intervention by CRPF= By 30 December, rioting was brought under control by the security forces such as the CRPF. The total number of security personnel deployed was about 2,500 police and paramilitary. The total number of people taking shelter in relief camps increased to 1200.  2007 Christmas violence in Kandhamal  The 2007 Christmas violence in Kandhamal started during December 24, 2007 and ended after 4 days between groups led by Sangh Parivar together with the Sangh-affiliated Kui Samaj and the local Christians, which resulted in more than 100 churches, over 100 church institutions and about 700 houses and other structures were burnt down or damaged and at least three people killed. 2008 Kandhamal violence A Christian girl who was bruised and burnt during the anti Christian violence in Orissa in August 2008. It occurred when a bomb was thrown into her house by extremists. During the 2008 Kandhamal violence, violence occurred from 25 August 2008 to 28 August 2008 between groups led by Sangh Parivar organizations and Christians in the Kandhamal district of Orissa. The started after the murder of Vishva Hindu Parishad leader Lakshmanananda Saraswati. It is estimated that more than 395 churches, 5600 homes and 13 educational institutes set on fire, demolised or vandalized during the attacks and more than 90 killed (largely Christians) and 18,000 injured and 54,000 displaced. Another report said that around 11,000 people were still living in relief camps, as of October 2008. Some tribals even fled away to border districts in neighbouring states and 310 villages were affected. On October 2008, a senior Maoist leader claimed responsibility for the murder of Laxmanananda and police officials also confirmed that the Maoists trained youth in the tribal community to murder Laxmanananda. Post-2008 According to the news agency Agenzia Fides, other Christians were tortured and killed in 2012. In February 2019, a Christian evangelical who had converted to Christianity nine months earlier was murdered. It is believed that the 'Hindu fanatics' of the village incited Maoists to carry out the killing.

In their seventh year under head coach Frank Broyles, the Razorbacks compiled an undefeated 11–0 record (7–0 against SWC opponents), won the SWC championship, closed the regular season with five consecutive shutouts, outscored all opponents by a combined total of 231 to 64, and defeated Nebraska in the Cotton Bowl. The Razorbacks finished the season as the only major team with an undefeated and untied record after No. 1 Alabama lost to Texas in the Orange Bowl. However, the AP and UPI Coaches Polls became final before the bowl games were played, leaving one-loss Alabama as the AP and UPI national champion. The Football Writers Association of America (FWAA) conducted its final polling after the bowl games and selected Arkansas as the national champion. Arkansas was also selected as national champion by six other selectors, including the Billingsley Report and the Helms Athletic Foundation. Schedule Statistical leaders and award winners The team's statistical leaders included Fred Marshall with 787 passing yards, Jack Brasuell with 551 rushing yards, Jim Lindsey with 385 receiving yards, and Bobby Burnett with 54 points scored (9 touchdowns). Arkansas linebacker Ronnie Caveness was selected by the Associated Press (AP), Newspaper Enterprise Association, Football Writers Association of America, Time magazine, and the Sporting News as a first-team player on the 1964 College Football All-America Team. Caveness was later inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. Eight Arkansas players were selected by the AP or United Press International (UPI) as first-team players on the 1964 All-Southwest Conference football team: Caveness (AP-1, UPI-1); quarterback Fred Marshall (AP-1, UPI-1); offensive end Jerry Lamb (AP-1, UPI-1), offensive tackle Glen Ray Hines (AP-1, UPI-1), defensive halfback Ken Hatfield (AP-1), defensive guard Jim Johnson (AP-1), and defensive tackles Lloyd Phillips (AP-1) and Jim Williams (AP-1).https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3071138/1964_ap_all_swc/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3071043/1964_upi_all_swc/ 1965 Cotton Bowl Classic Arkansas was invited to play in the 1965 Cotton Bowl Classic on January 1, 1965, against the Nebraska Cornhuskers. Arkansas' number-one rated defense was giving up only 5.7 points per game, while No. 7 Nebraska's scoring offense was averaging 24.9 points per contest. Playing before a capacity crowd of 75,504 in Dallas, Arkansas opened the scoring with a field goal by Tom McKnelly in the first quarter. Nebraska took the lead in the second quarter on a one-yard touchdown run by Harry Wilson. Neither team scored in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, fifth-year quarterback Fred Marshall, whose fumbles had stalled Arkansas in the first half, led the Razorbacks on a nine-play, 80-yard touchdown drive. The drive featured a scramble by Marshall for a first down after it appeared he would be sacked and two passes from Marshall to Jim Lindsey, the second taking the ball to the Nebraska five-yard line. Two plays later, junior tailback Bobby Burnett ran one yard for the game-winning touchdown with less than five minutes remaining in the game. Source: Razorback Bowl History – 1965 Cotton Bowl Split national championship and controversy With its victory in the Cotton Bowl and Alabama's loss to Texas (a team Arkansas had defeated in Austin) in the Orange Bowl, Arkanas finished the 1964 season as the only major team with an undefeated and untied record. On January 6, 1965, a five-man committee of the Football Writers Association of America (FWAA) selected Arkansas as the winner of Look magazine's Grantland Rice Trophy as the top college football team in the country. Arkansas received four of five first-place votes, with Texas receiving the fifth vote. Alabama did not receive a single vote for first, second, or third place. The five members of the FWAA committee were Si Burick, Dayton Daily News; Fred Russell, Nashville Banner; Blackie Sherrod, Dallas Times Herald; Steve Weller, Buffalo Evening News; and Paul Zimmerman, Los Angeles Times. Arkansas is also recognized as the 1964 national champion by Billingsley Report, College Football Researchers Association, Helms Athletic Foundation, National Championship Foundation, Poling System, Sagarin, and Sagarin (ELO-Chess). However, the final AP and UPI Coaches polls were released before bowl games were played, and Alabama therefore remained as the national champion in the AP and UPI Coaches' Polls. Because of the controversy, the AP Poll experimented with a voting model that took the final vote to select their champion after the bowl games in the 1965 season. In 1966, the AP Poll went back to taking the final vote at the conclusion of the regular season before finally adopting the post-bowl season model in 1968. The UPI Coaches' Poll adopted the post-bowl season model in 1974 after the controversies surrounding the 1964, 1965, 1970, and 1973 national championships, seasons in which the winner of the Coaches' Poll went on to lose their bowl game.

Mulla Effendi was born into a respected and intellectual family of Islamic scholars who settled in Arbil in the 16th century and spent most of their life learning and teaching Islamic studies at the Great Mosque at the Citadel of Arbil. His family was well known for their piety and learning and influential throughout Kurdistan for hundred years before him. After being educated at the Great Mosque, Mulla Effendi like his ancestors spent most of his time teaching and learning there. During his life he granted more than hundred scientific licenses for scholars from different parts of Iraq, Iran, and the Middle East in general, and sponsored the daily living and study costs of his students. He also contributed to establishing many schools and mosques in Arbil and in many different villages. He became one of the most influential figures in Kurdistan in the late 19th century and until his death. He had an important role in disengaging tribal conflicts during the Ottoman rule where he received the highest recognition by the Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II. Throughout the British Mandate and after the creation of Iraq, he played a prominent role in inspiring and directing public opinion, as well as being deeply involved in the political process of the region. In 1924, he strongly urged appending Mosul Wilayah to Iraq in his meeting with the members of the League of Nations commission. He also advocated for the rights of the Christian inhabitants of Ankawa. In the events of 1941, the Iraqi royal family chose his house as the most suitable and safe for their stay, and when King Faisal II returned, he awarded him \\"Wisam al-Rafidain\\" of the first order as a reward for his services for his country. He also received many honors and tributes both during and after his life.  Early life and family  Mulla Abu Bakr Effendi's family is traced back to a known family that emigrated from Iran along with other families during the 16th century at the time of Shah Ismail I Safawi of Iran and settled in Arbil. The reason for the emigration was due to differences between the chief leader of the family and the ruling Shah. For several generations before him, his ancestors were famous scholars teaching Islamic studies at the Great Mosque at the Citadel of Arbil. They were widely known and respected throughout Kurdistan for their piety and knowledge. He was named \\"Küçük Mulla\\" or \\"Malla i Gichka\\" (that means \\"Little Mulla\\") after his grandfather Abu Bakr III Effendi (1778–1855) who was known by that name because he completed his study of Islamic sciences in a record period as no one had done before in that age. Mulla Effendi received his education from his father, Hajji Omer Effendi, who was the speaker of the Great Mosque. Mulla Effendi's passion for study and learning led him to start teaching and writing when he was young. He was only twenty eight years when he took his father's place after his father's death in 1891. In 1908, Mulla Effendi renovated the Great Mosque. He taught Islamic philosophy, Islamic history, science, mathematics, astronomy and ethics. Only he could issue Fatwas in Arbil and for nearby tribes and villages where he granted more than hundred scientific licenses for scholars from different parts of Iraq, Iran, and the Middle East in general. Mulla Effendi's whole family were consumptive, and he lost two wives and three daughters through this complaint. He was married four times during his life, and left two sons and three daughters. In 1913, he moved from his house at the citadel to his new house in Badawa (3 km southeast of the citadel, at (), after its completion.  Works  = Ottoman Empire = During the Ottoman Empire, Mulla Effendi's family had a significant role in disengaging public conflicts and settling disputes between Kurdish tribes. At one time, Sultan Abdul Hamid II requested Mulla Effendi's help to settle a conflict between two large Kurdish tribes. Mulla Effendi used his influence to reconcile the two tribes. For his achievement, Sultan Abdul Hamid II granted him the \\"Servant of the Two Shrines\\" medal. It was considered the second highest rank Order of the Ottoman Empire. = British mandate = During the beginning of the British mandate, following the arrival of the British troops into Iraq, the country was in a state of anarchy. Mulla Effendi gathered the tribal leaders and urged them to refrain from taking any action that would compromise the stability of the country. Lieut.-Colonel Sir Rupert Hay, the British Political Officer of Arbil, and author of \\"Two Years in Kurdistan, Experiences of a Political Officer 1918-1920\\", described Mulla Effendi's role in inspiring and directing the public opinion, and in talking to the tribal chiefs over to a reasonable attitude. He described Mulla Effendi in his book as the following: Also, in his book, he wrote: An aerial view of Citadel of Arbil on January 2008 shows the Great Mosque at the center. The Great Mosque is considered to be the oldest mosque in Arbil. It is also known as the White Mosque, Citadel Mosque, or Mulla Effendi Mosque. Gertrude Bell had often visited Mulla Effendi at his house in Badawa, and mentioned him in her letters to her father published in 1927, a year after her death by her stepmother in two volumes.The Gertrude Bell Project, Letters, A.M. Hamilton, who was notable for building the Hamilton Road through Kurdistan, described him in his book published in 1937 \\"Road through Kurdistan\\". Also, Lieut.-Colonel Sir Wallace A. Lyon, the predecessor of Lieut.-Colonel Sir William Rupert Hay, described Mulla Effendi's status in his autobiography (1918–44): In 1924 at the time when the dispute between Iraq and Turkey over the control of the former Ottoman province of Mosul was under discussion by the League of Nations, the members of the League of Nations Commission visited Mulla Effendi at his house in Badawa to discuss the issue with him. At the meeting, he strongly supported annexing Mosul to Iraq and stressed the rights of the Kurdish population. In December 1924 and June 1931, King Faisal I visited Mulla Effendi in his house in Badawa in Arbil and thanked him for his efforts and his calls for reconciliation and peace to the different groups in the region. King Faisal I was quoted as describing Mulla Effendi to his brother by saying: = Ankawa Christians = In the early 1920s, a few groups threatened to take over the lands of the indigenous Christian inhabitants of Ankawa. The Archbishop and town chiefs went to meet Mulla Effendi at the Great Mosque to explain the situation to him and make him aware of rising tensions in Ankawa. Mulla Effendi immediately gathered the tribal leaders in Arbil and informed tribesmen that he would consider any attack against Christians as an attack against him. With those words, he prevented any further attempts of taking over Christian lands in Ankawa. = 1941 Coup d'etat = During the last days of the Anglo-Iraqi War, before British troops entered Baghdad, and before the collapse of Rashid Ali Al-Gaylani government, Rashid Ali phoned Mulla Effendi and informed him that he had chosen his house as a safe haven for the royal family to stay until the conflict ended. King Faisal II, Queen Alia, members of the royal family, and court escorts and servants left Baghdad on May 28, 1941 to stay at Mulla Effendi's house at Badawa. He opened his house to them and moved his family to another house at the citadel. He invited tribal leaders to Badawa to express solidarity with the royal family. On June 3, 1941, two days after the return of Regent Abd al-Ilah from Habbaniyah to Baghdad, the royal family left Badawa and returned to Baghdad. On his return to Baghdad, King Faisal II decorated Mulla Effendi with Wisam al-Rafidain \\"the Medal of the Two Rivers\\" in recognition of his work for the country.  Death and legacy  Abu Bakr Mulla Effendi died on Thursday December 31, 1942. He was buried in the family's private cemetery in Badawa. His death was a sad loss to many. Highest-ranking members of the government and others such as Deputy Chief of Royal Protocol on behalf of Regent Abd al-Ilah, the Iraqi Premier then Nuri as-Said, the British Ambassador to Iraq in Baghdad Sir Kinahan Cornwallis, the President of the Senate Sayyid Muhammad al-Sadr, Mutasarrif of Mosul Abdul-Majeed al-Yaqubi, Jamil al-Midfai (served five times as Prime Minister of Iraq), Dawud al-Haidary (well-known Iraqi statesman), paid tribute to his family. Well-known scholars who studied from Mulla Effendi included: Sheikh Mustafa al-Naqishbandi, Mulla Taaeb Ahmed Mohammad Jaff, Mulla Sharif Ahmed Mohammad Jaff, Wahbatallah Effendi, Mulla Abdullah Mariwani, Sayyid Abdullah Effendi Mukiryani, Abdulfattah Effendi Shwani, Sheikh Muhammad al-Khal, al-Haj Mulla Muhammad al-Sudani, Sheikh Arif Ashnawi, Muhammad Tajaddin al-Talshi, Mulla Muhammad al-Sawij Bolaqi, Mulla Muhammad al-Saqzi, Mulla Abdullah al-Burhani, al-Mulla Abdullfattah al-Khati, al-Haj Mulla Salih Koza Banka, and other well-known scholars. His scientific and religious works are well-known and available in the schools of Arbil. He contributed to establishing many schools and mosques in Arbil and in many villages. He also sponsored the costs of living and studying of his students at the Great Mosque. Each year, he had the right to send two students to al- Azhar in Cairo to pursue their studies. He maintained strong relationships with senior scholars from Egypt, Turkey, Afghanistan, and other places. = Library = He had two large libraries. One of them was at the Great Mosque, and the other was at Badawa. The libraries were full of references, valuable and rare manuscripts and printed materials. The libraries contained books on language, science, grammar, morphology, rhetoric, Tafsir (Commentary on the Quran), Hadith (Traditions of the Prophet), linguistics, doctrine, logic, literature. In the mid 1960s, a fire destroyed the library at Badawa and a lot of the books in that library were lost. The books that were at the citadel library of and some at the Badawa library are preserved to this day, while the majority of manuscripts are at Dar al-Makhtutat al-Iraqiyya / the Iraqi House of Manuscripts (formerly Dar Saddam lil-Makhtutat / Saddam House of Manuscripts).

He was an alumnus of Santa Sabina studium conventuale, the first studium of the Dominican Order at Rome, and the progenitor of the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, Angelicum. Later he was sent to the studium generale at Paris c. 1255 to become a master.\\"D'altra parte, fonti anche antiche affermano che l'A., entrato ancor giovane tra i domenicani nel convento romano di S.

After teaching in Paris for some years, he was called to Rome in 1246 by Innocent IV to fill the post of Master of the Sacred Palace. He served in this capacity under Popes Alexander IV and Urban IV, the latter of whom created him Cardinal in 1262. When Clement IV, in 1265, handed over the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies to Charles I of Anjou, Annibale was put at the head of the commission empowered to treat with the monarch and register his agreement to the papal stipulations. The King received the insignia of investiture in Rome from the hands of the Cardinal. On 6 January 1266, Annibale anointed and solemnly crowned Charles I in the Lateran Church in Rome, the Pope being detained in Perugia. During the vacancy succeeding the death of Clement IV, Annibale received and treated with Philip III of France and Charles I at Viterbo (1270). During a papal mission at Orvieto, the Cardinal died, and, by his own request, was buried in the Church of San Domenico. He was held in high esteem during life for his learning and virtues. Aquinas dedicated his Catena Aurea to him. Annibale, besides several small theological treatises now lost, wrote a commentary on the \\"Sentences\\", and \\"Quod libeta\\", which has been ascribed to St. Thomas, and published with his works even as recently as the Paris edition of 1889, by Frette. A manuscript in the Carmelite monastery in Paris calls Annibale a Carmelite who later became a Cistercian abbot.

Since its founding in 1872, Jackson & Perkins has grown to sell other products including live plants, garden accessories, holiday gifts, and home decor. History =Early history= The company's name came from the two partners who started the business, Charles H. Perkins (1840–1924) and his father-in-law, Albert E. Jackson (1807–1895). The company began in 1872, in Newark, New York, as a truck farm selling strawberries, raspberries, and grapes. Perkins became interested in the wholesale nursery business and he began selling vines and shrubs to nearby retail nurseries. In 1882, Charles became fascinated with rose propagation. In 1884, he hired Alvin Miller as foreman of his newly evolving rose business. Miller, a hybridizer, was directed to develop a special rose new to the rose market. His first success, introduced in 1901, was the Dorothy Perkins rose, named for Charles Perkins' granddaughter Dorothy. In 1908, this rose won top honors at the Royal National Rose Society. It also started a long tradition of naming roses for people. This rose has been mentioned by several authors in their works including F. Scott Fitzgerald. Jackson & Perkins stopped marketing the original Dorothy Perkins rose because the plant was prone to mildew and disease. It is still available from specialty nurseries. To this day the Dorothy Perkins climbing rose adorns the walls of Windsor Castle. Jackson & Perkins remained a family affair when, in 1928, Charles \\"Charlie\\" Perkins, nephew of the founder, succeeded his cousin George C. Perkins as President. He furthered the company's involvement in rose hybridization by hiring Jean Henri Nicolas, an internationally known French hybridizer, to head the new, expanded rose hybridization department. The family home at Newark, known as the Jackson-Perkins House, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006. After Nicolas's death in 1937, Eugene Boerner, his understudy, became J&P;'s head hybridizer. Boerner made great strides in the floribunda class of rose, a classification name coined by C.H. Perkins, a cousin of Charles. In 1939, Boerner increased J&P;'s stock of roses by collecting 10,000 cuttings from growers in Europe. These cuttings were instrumental in the successful propagation of new varieties. J&P;, along with other innovative growers, wanted protection for the plants they launched. The United States Congress, in 1931, extended plant patent protection to nurseries that developed and introduced new plants to the nursery trade. This law gives patent-holders seven years of competition-free production. =World's Fair rose= The 1939 New York World's Fair proved to be the perfect venue for introducing Jackson & Perkins roses to the nation. Charlie Perkins participated in the fair with a garden display holding 8,000 roses. World's Fair, a red floribunda rose, was the star attraction. Approximately 40,000 people signed up to have information or the World's Fair rose shipped. This gave the company a ready-made customer list. Catalogs were developed, and the Jackson & Perkins mail order business, the first mail order rose nursery in the nation, was launched. World's Fair was the winner of the first All-America Rose Selection competition, followed by a string of winners. Katherine T. Marshall won in 1944. Fashion, a coral- peach rose, won the AARS competition in 1950. The following years brought a string of champions: Vogue, Ma Perkins, Jiminy Cricket, White Bouquet, Gold Cup, and Ivory Fashion. Eugene Boerner won fourteen All-America rose honors, including three more awarded after his death. Jackson & Perkins roses became the stars of the rose world, not just because of the development of hybrids, but also because of the attention given to naming the new introductions. Blaze and Fashion have lasting appeal. Star-struck names, such as Cary Grant, Dolly Parton, Kate Smith, and Arlene Francis could help propel a rose to popularity. Many of these roses are still in production. =Post Perkins-family= Harry and David CEO Bill Williams and First Lady Laura Bush in the White House Rose Garden during the unveiling of Jackson & Perkins' \\"Rosa 'Laura Bush'\\" in 2006 Charlie Perkins died in 1963, followed by Gene Boerner four years later. In 1966, Jackson & Perkins Company was purchased by Harry and David, the world's largest mail order fruit business. Bear Creek Corporation, an umbrella organization, was formed over Harry and David and Jackson & Perkins companies in 1972. Jackson & Perkins focused their business on mail order sales while Bear Creek Gardens oversaw garden center, mass market, and greenhouse sales. Harry and David moved the rose hybridizing facility to Tustin, California, and hired William Warriner to continue the hybridizing work of Boerner. He introduced three hybrids, developed by Gene Boerner, which won AARS awards: \\"Gay Princess\\" in 1967, \\"Gene Boerner\\" in 1969, and \\"First Prize\\" in 1970. He went on to win nineteen All-America awards for his rose introductions while working on J&P; hybrids. In 1984, the corporation was sold to R.J. Reynolds Development Corporation. Dr. Keith Zary succeeded Bill Warriner as Director of Research for J&P; roses in 1985. He and his team continued the AARS award winning tradition with nine more AARS awards including Mardi Gras, the 2008 AARS award winner. Bear Creek Corporation purchased Armstrong Nurseries in 1987. This old J&P; rival in the rose industry had been a family-owned company. They were a charter member of AARS and held many awards for their roses. Patented varieties included Double Delight, Olympiad, Fire 'N' Ice, and Crystalline. In 1986, Bear Creek Corporation, which included Jackson & Perkins, was purchased by Shaklee Corporation, which in turn was purchased by Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd of Japan in 1989. In 1997, Jackson & Perkins began internet sales of roses. What once was Bear Creek Gardens became Jackson & Perkins Wholesale. Over 300,000 seedlings are grown and evaluated every year at the research facility outside Somis, California. Jackson & Perkins wholesale (JPW) was created to sell to local garden centers as well as mass retailers. On April 10, 2007, Harry and David Holdings sold most of the assets of Jackson & Perkins to an investment group headed by Donald and Glenda Hachenberger.

Ramogi was known for his spur of the good life and his notable appearances at bars and clubs in western Kenya-Nyanza region. During the beginning of his career. Ramogi is believed to have been the real force behind “benga” as a genre.  Biography It was in 1965 that Ramogi and colleagues started the Luo Sweet Band, later changed to Continental Kilo Jazz Band (or C.K. Jazz). The nucleus of this group had been performing together, on and off, right up to Ramogi’s death at the age of 52 in 1997. Ramogi married Rosalia Kiayi, and later on a second wife, Bellah Ajode. In 1994, a small group of Kenyans in the United States pooled their resources to bring Ramogi and band to the US to perform. The \\"Safari\\" CD, recorded in the US, is an outgrowth of that tour and, in fact, contains praise songs (as is common) for several of the individuals who organised the tour. Although not a very polished production, it’s certainly authentic benga and it has its moments of greatness. The cassette contains more songs from the same recording session and somewhat better audio quality. Ramogi was a vivid story teller. In 'Ajali ya Sondu', he recounts a road accident in which a lorry killed many. In 1969, Argwings- Kodhek died in a road accident and Ramogi immortalized him in 'Argwings-Kodhek Onindo'. When a group of fishermen perished in Lake Victoria, he immortalized them in 'Rapar Jonam'. Ramogi has also been recognised through his recordings with other Kenyan musicians such as Were Carey, Ochieng Kabaselleh, Daniel Owino Misiani and Tom Kodiyo. He created C.K Dumbe Dumbe Jazz band in response to the popular Zairean group Orchestre Lipua Lipua. Dumbe Dumbe is a Luo word for the children playing in the rain (nyithindo go dumbe dumbe).

The ACSO is a nationally accredited law enforcement agency servicing and a population of 75,300. History The Allegany County was created in 1789 when Allegany County was created from a portion of Washington County by the Acts of 1789. The Allegany County Sheriff's Office began when John C. Beatty was elected the first Sheriff in 1791. The current sheriff is Craig Robertson Who was elected in November 2010 after the retirement of longtime Sheriff David A. Goad.Office of the Sheriff - Allegany County Maryland Organization The ACSO is divided into four divisions: *The Patrol Division - Is currently only responsible for the service of court orders (e.g., Protective Orders, Peace Orders, Criminal Summons, Warrants, etc.) However full patrol duties are expected to be returned to the Patrol Division after the Allegany County Bureau of Police is dissolved by the Allegany County Commissioners sometime during 2011. *The Correctional Division - Responsible for housing offenders and transportation. *The Judicial Division - Responsible for lesser offenses, offenders not deemed a threat to public safety. Monitors community service programs. *The Court Security Division - Responsible for the security of the courthouse and all personnel. Allegany County Bureau of Police Created in 2008 and disbanded in 2011, the \\"Bureau of Police\\" (BOP) was created by the Allegany County Board of Commissioners who were largely in disagreement with then-Sheriff Goad as to how to police the county. Patrol and detective services were taken from the Sheriff and given to the BOP. The Sheriff's Office continued court security, court order service, and jail duties. The creation of the BOP and their relationship with the Sheriff's Office were subjects of discontent with the citizens of the county, who in turn, voted out of office the three commissioners who voted in favor of the creation of the BOP. Subsequently, all patrol and detective services were returned to the Sheriff's Office in 2011.http://times-news.com/local/x976268608/Plan-to-reunify-county-police- deputies-unveiled Administration Sheriff-Craig Robertson Major Randy Cutter Administration Supervisor Captain David Morgan Administrative and Judicial Supervisor Lieutenant Israel Sibley Patrol Administrator/Shift Supervisor Lieutenant Brett Lysinger Patrol Administrator/Shift Supervisor Sergeant Michael Beal Criminal & Civil Process Supervisor Sergeant Chris Hill K-9 Sergeant Wade Sibley K-9 Corporal Shawn McBee Road Supervisor Corporal John Dowden Road Supervisor Patrol Administrative Assistants: Rhonda Twigg Donna Hovatter Detention Center - Assistant Administrator Captain: Daniel B.

He was one of the earliest poets to publish in Canada. He is known for his critically acclaimed play Saul.\\"Charles Heavysege,\\" Gale Encyclopedia of Biography, Answers.com. Web, Mar. 12, 2011. Life and writing Heavysege was born in Huddersfield, Yorkshire, England. Heavysege emigrated to Montreal in 1853 where he worked as a wood carver. In 1860 he became a reporter for the Montreal Transcript, and later for the Montreal Daily Witness, where he eventually became city editor.\\"Heavysege, Charles.\\" Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online. Web, Mar. 12, 2011. As a poet, Heavysege was mainly influenced by \\"Milton, Shakespeare, and the Bible.\\" Rota Herzberg Lister, \\"Heavysege, Charles.\\" The Canadian Encyclopedia (Edmonton: Hurtig, 1988), 974. His first published work was The revolt of Tartarus, a poem in six parts, published in two editions: one under his own name in London in 1852, and a second, heavily edited and published anonymously in Montreal, in 1855.Sandra Djwa, \\"Charles Heavysege Biography,\\" Encyclopedia of Literature, 7989, JRank.org, Web, Apr. 28, 2011. He published Sonnets in 1855, Saul: a drama in three parts in 1857, Count Filippo; or, the unequal marriage in 1860, The Owl (an imitation of Poe's \\"The Raven\\") and The Huntsman in 1864, The Advocate (a prose work) and Jephthah's daughter in 1865, and Jezebel in 1867. During his lifetime, Saul was Heavysege's best-known work. Nathaniel Hawthorne passed on a copy to the North British Review, where it was given a laudatory (unsigned) review by Coventry Patmore, who called it \\"indubitably the best poem ever written out of Great Britain.\\" That was followed by further favorable reviews in the Atlantic Monthly, Galaxy, and New York Evening Post. Saul was published in two further editions, in 1859 (also in Montreal) and 1869 (in Boston). (The Boston edition was reprinted in 1876 and again in 1967.) Other admirers of Saul were Canadian Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald and American poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. Heavysege was internationally known by the 1860s and 1870s, paving the way for later Anglo-Canadian poets, including Charles Sangster and Charles G.D. Roberts. W.D. Lighthall, who included Heavysege's work in his 1889 anthology Songs of the Great Dominion, wrote that Heavysege's poetry was not particularly Canadian, and that he didn't have a large readership in Canada. Nonetheless, he declared that Canadian critics \\"claim him as perhaps their greatest, most original writer.\\" He believed that Heavysege's poetry was worth appreciating and would continue to be popular.William Douw Lighthall, Songs of the Great Dominion: Voices from the Forests and Waters, the Settlements and Cities of Canada (Walter Scott [Windsor Series], 1889), Google Books, Web, Apr. 30, 2011. However, his reputation declined in later decades; as national pride grew in the 1920s, he was criticized for not really being a \\"Canadian writer\\". He continued to be supported by poets W.W.E. Ross, Ralph Gustafson, and A.J.M. Smith.\\"Charles Heavysege,\\" Dictionary of Literary Biography, Bookrags.com. Web, Mar. 12, 2011. In 1956, while dismissing Saul and Count Filippo as \\"Victorian dinosaurs,\\" Canadian literary critic Northrop Frye acknowledged Heavysege as the \\"first poet who really came to grips with\\" what Frye considered to be \\"the central Canadian tragic theme\\" (that being \\"the indifference of nature to human values\\"): \\"His third poem, Jephthah's Daughter, seems to me to reflect more directly the influence of his Canadian environment, as its main themes are loneliness, the indifference of nature, and the conception of God as a force of nature.\\" Northrop Frye, \\"Preface to an Uncollected Anthology,\\" The Bush Garden (Toronto: Anansi, 1971), 171. Saul was produced as a radio drama by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in 1974. In fiction Solly Bridgetower, a character in Robertson Davies' The Salterton Trilogy, is an associate professor of English at the fictional Waverley University, and is urged by his department chair, Dr. Sengreen, to stake out a claim in the emerging field of \\"Amcan\\" (American-Canadian literature) by editing a scholarly edition of Heavysege's collected works, in order to earn tenure and make a name for himself (Leaven of Malice, 1954).

It was a large single-engine biplane with single-bay unstaggered wings, the design conventional in all respects other than that the lower wing was of greater span than the upper. The CS was built to allow its undercarriage to be quickly and easily interchangeable between wheeled, tailskid undercarriage, and twin pontoons for operation from water. Provision for the carriage of a torpedo was semi-recessed into the underside of the fuselage, blended in behind an aerodynamic fairing. The pilot and gunner sat in tandem open cockpits, while accommodation inside the fuselage was provided for a third crewmember who served as bombardier and radio operator. This station was also provided with a dorsal hatch aft of the gunner's position, and a ventral blister aft of the torpedo recess, which was used for aiming bombs or torpedoes. Development Curtiss produced six CS-1 prototypes for the Navy in 1923, which were mostly used for engine tests. Two examples of the improved CS-2 were built the following year and set a number of world speed, distance, and endurance records for seaplanes in its class. The Navy ordered both the CS-1 and CS-2 into production, but when Curtiss tendered with a price of $32,000 per aircraft, Martin undercut them with a tender of $25,200 for each CS-1 and $19,863 for each CS-2 and won the contract. Curtiss refused to provide full sets of drawings and data to Martin, so Martin-built machines were in part reverse-engineered from a Curtiss-built CS-1 provided by the Navy. By the time the Martin-produced aircraft were delivered in 1925–26, the Navy's designation system had changed, and they entered service as the SC-1 and SC-2. Martin- built SC-2s suffered from poor handling characteristics and soon earned the nickname \\"Sea Cow\\". Meanwhile, the Naval Aircraft Factory made extensive modifications to the two Curtiss CS-2s leading them to be redesignated CS-3. Further development of the design was carried out by Martin as the T3M and T4M, and eventually by Great Lakes as the TG. Operational history In 1924, the CS-2 was used to break numerous world records for seaplanes in its class in three long-range flights. The first of these took place overnight between 22 and 23 June, when Lt Frank Wead and Lt John D. Price set five records – distance (963.123 mi, 1,544.753 km), duration (13 hours, 23 minutes, 15 seconds), speed over 500 km (73.41 mph, 117.74 km/h), speed over 1,000 km (74.27 mph, 119.12 km/h) and speed over 1,500 km (74.17 mph/118.96 km/h). p. 13 Between 11 and 12 July, the same pilots would break the distance and duration records again (994.19 mi/1,594.58 km over 14 hours, 53 minutes, 44 seconds). On October 10, these same two records would be exceeded by Lt Andrew Crinkley and Lt Rossmore Lyon in a flight of 1,460 mi (2,342 km) in 20 hours, 28 minutes. While these would have been new world records, the flight was not officially timed, and was therefore not recognized as such. On September 23, 1925, the U.S. Navy flew 23 Curtiss CS-1 floatplanes to Bay Shore Park on the Chesapeake Bay, 14 miles SE of Baltimore, Maryland, on a Friday with the intention of an air show demonstration before the 1925 Schneider Cup Race on Saturday, but that night gale-force winds broke three-inch mooring and anchor ropes on 17 of the biplanes and they were blown onto shore or dashed against seawalls, destroying seven and damaging ten. The next afternoon's Baltimore Evening Sun had the headline \\"Plane Disaster in Harbor Called Hard Blow to Navy\\" and quoted General William \\"Billy\\" Mitchell, who called the loss of the CS-1s \\"staggering\\" and blamed it on Navy mismanagement of its aviation program.Gough, Michael, \\"Doolittle Wins In Baltimore\\", Airpower, November 2005, Volume 35, Number 11, page 50.

Features Its new all-steel cab, designed by Ogle of London, replaced the older fibreglass and wood construction of the previous appliances it succeeded, such as the Dennis D and Dennis R. The cab design was part of a collaboration between Dennis and Shelvoke and Drewry (SD), to produce a common cab architecture for both companies' ranges of fire engines and dustcarts, which could be economically produced at low production volumes. The first of the Dennis RS (Rigid Steel), referring to the cab which was fixed and had access panels inside to access the engine) fire appliances were fitted with Perkins V8 diesel engines, either the V8-540 (8.8 litre) or the V8-640 (10.6 litre), with or without turbochargers. The all-welded steel cab provided the maximum protection possible to the crew, and had an edge over other commercial trucks, as the RS was a purpose built fire appliance and was not used for any other application. The Dennis RS could be fitted with a variety of bodies by Dennis/JDC, Carmichael, Fulton Wylie, etc. Even though the cab design of the RS dates from 1978, they are seen to this day in fire brigades all over the world, with many still in front-line use to this day. In the later years the RS and SS series appliances (as did the rival Shelvoke SPV appliances) were dogged with door corrosion, aptly known as \\"Dennis Disease\\" as almost every single RS appliance suffered from rotten cab doors at some stage in their lives.

It has been in business for over forty years, and has been in its present location in the heart of downtown London for over 20 years.The Dundas Street used-book store celebrates its 30th anniversary this week. London Free Press' Ian Gillespie's Blog 2006-11-16 Specializing in used and antiquarian books, along with maps, prints, and ephemera, Attic Books draws a large variety of customers. Marvin Post Marvin Post is the owner of Attic Books. He is a member of the International League of Antiquarian Booksellers (ILAB), the Antiquarian Booksellers Association of Canada (ABAC), and the Canadian Booksellers Association (CBA). He \\"appraises a variety of archives, books and related material for a number of public institutions for insurance and tax purposes\\".The Canadian Antique Roadshow from the company's website Post was a stamp dealer in 1969. He owned a record store in the early 1970s called B-side Records, which used the label from an antiquarian book press for its symbol, a triad of bumblebees. He established Attic Books in 1976. He joined the Antiquarian Booksellers Association of Canada (ABAC) and the International League of Antiquarian Booksellers (ILAB) in 1981. He is a regular attendee at the Ottawa Book Fair, the Toronto Antiquarian Book Fair and the Toronto Paper Show.Marvin Post Curriculum Vitae Attic Books' story The store originally opened in 1976 on the top floor of a building at 428 Richmond Street, which currently houses Bob Burke Jewellers. It then moved to the second floor space at 388 Clarence Street. These locations lent themselves well to the shop's name. In the 1980s, development in downtown London forced Attic Books out of its location, and it reopened in Parkhill, Ontario. In 1996, mayor Diane Haskett worked with proprietor Marvin Post to bring Attic Books back to London, Ontario. It is now one of the few longstanding destination businesses in downtown London. Recent history Attic Books in 2006 opened the second floor, which is specialized in antiquarian books, maps and prints, along with sections of collectibles, antiques and books on books. It was previously only available to dealers and known collectors. Now it is open to the public. Attic Books sells maps and prints. Branching out into the online world of book retail, Attic Books now sells online stock at both ABE, Biblio, and Alibris.History of Attic Books from the company's website Attic Books also is becoming known for selling curiosities and unusual antiques in addition to books. Other information Attic Books is one of the very few places where Charles van Sandwyk's fine art and fantasy cards and books can be purchased. Where to Buy Charles van Sandwyk Involved in the community, Attic Books often sponsors and hosts awards and events in London, Ontario.The Brickenden Awards 2005 It is also the only local supplier of Brodart mylar jackets. Attic Books also participates in large tradeshows in Toronto and Ottawa. History of the building The building at 240 Dundas Street is late Victorian red brick commercial in style. Originally, the building was a single floor and only about 20' long. It was not expanded until the 1880s, when the second and third floor were added. The second floor was attached to 242 Dundas, creating a large space that accommodated Somerset Hall. Doorways on the main floor also allowed access to the adjacent building. A hoist existed where the current elevator can be found.The London Room, London Public Library Archives During a major renovation in 1919, arts and crafts elements were added to the façade. The back end of the store was extended and a mezzanine was added to the third floor. This renovation was designed and executed by famous London architect J. M. Moore. Before 1919, the building matched the three structures that surround it, two to the west and one to the east. The elevator was installed in 1919, and was made by the Roelofsen Machine and Tool Co. in Galt, Ontario.Cambridge Public Library The large pane glass windows overlooking the street were installed by McPhillips & Co. in the 1930s. The outer two window panes on each of the upper picture windows pivoted to open like doors. These windows facilitated the movement of pianos from the street to the upper floors for display. They have since been replaced with more energy efficient windows Marvin Post purchased the building from the Thompson family, owners of Supertest, in 1996. The Thompsons had owned it since the early 1930s. When repainting the elevator, Post removed 35 lbs. of lead paint from the car, unveiling a rainbow of colours that had been added over the years. The alternating dark and light wood on the second level flooring is called a \\"wedding floor\\", made of walnut and maple, and can also be found in 242 Dundas next door. When Post took possession of the building in 1996, the toilets had not been updated, although the plumbing had been. The toilet tanks were still made of wood, and have since been replaced. The gargoyle overlooking Dundas Street was added by the current owner. It was designed by Florin Musta, and acquired through Tony O'Callaghan of Studio Celtia, former business at 242 Dundas.Marvin Post, Interview, 2009 Other businesses at 240 Dundas St. 1875 Abraham Spry, merchant tailor 1876 - 1880 Various small businesses 1880 Vacant 1881–1886 Reid Brothers & Co., stationers 1887–1892 Empire Tea Company (Main Floor) Somerset Hall (Second Floor – London Temperance League) 1892–1907 Anderson & Nelles Drug Store (Main Floor) Somerset Hall (Second Floor – London Temperance League) 1892 First electricity 1893 First telephone 1907–1919 People's Outfitting Company, furniture 1919–1927 Thomas Furniture Company, furniture 1927 Gray's Music, subsidiary of Eaton's 1930–1965 McPhillips Company, pianos, radios, appliances 1965–1995 Robert Holmes Stationery, stationery and books 1996 – Present Attic Books, rare and fine used books The ghost of Attic Books In 2009, the Paranormal Knights of Londonhttp://www.pklondon.ca performed an investigation at 240 Dundas Street into the possible presence of a ghost.

The warship joined the Pacific Fleet in 1990 and was listed as having only a caretaker crew up to 2002. While in transit to her permanent base Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky from 27 September to 5 November 1990, she visited the Vietnamese port of Kampan between 22 and 24 October.https://wiki.wargaming.net/ru/Navy:Варяг_(1983)#.D0.98.D1.81.D1.82.D0.BE.D1.80.D0.B8.D1.8F_.D1.81.D0.BE.D0.B7.D0.B4.D0.B0.D0.BD.D0.B8.D1.8F Between 9 and 13 February 1997 she paid a friendly visit to the South Korean port of Incheon. The rocket cruiser visited Shanghai, China between 2 and 6 October 1999 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the founding of the state. Between 10 and 15 October 2002 she visited the Japanese city of Yokosuka to honor the 50th anniversary of the Japanese navy. Between 10 and 15 February 2004 Varyag visited the South Korean port of Incheon. Between September and December 2005 she led a ship detachment on visits to Visakhpatnam (India), Singapore, Jakarta (Indonesia), Sttahip (Thailand), and Haiphong (Vietnam). The cruiser re-entered service with the Pacific Fleet in May 2008 after an overhaul. In April 2009 she paid a visit to the Chinese city of Qingdon to honor the 60th anniversary of the Chinese Navy. In October/November the same year, the ship also visited Singapore. In 2009 Varyag led a fleet of foreign warships participating in a . In June 2010, Varyag, under the command of Captain Eduard Moskalenko and with the Commander Northern Fleet Combined Forces Rear-Admiral Vladimir L. Kasatonov embarked, made a port call to San Francisco. The visit, the first by a Russian navy surface combatant in 147 years, featured a plaque dedication ceremony to commemorate six Russian Imperial Navy sailors who died fighting a fire in San Francisco in 1863. This visit also coincided with President Medvedev visiting Silicon Valley and he once again visited Varyag as he had in Singapore in 2009. From 8 to 11 November 2011 Varyag, accompanied by the tanker Irkut, made a port visit to Vancouver, British Columbia, to commemorate servicemen killed in armed conflicts. Varyag was escorted into Vancouver by the Royal Canadian Navy destroyer , and Varyags crew engaged in friendly sports matches with their Canadian counterparts from Algonquin. In 2012, she participated in the yearly exercise with the Chinese navy off Qingdao. In 2013 she departed on a long voyage to the Mediterranean, visiting Trinkomali (Sri Lanka), Salala (Oman), and Alexandria (Egypt). In November 2014, Varyag led a deployment of four Russian naval vessels to international waters off Australia. The deployment was believed to be linked to the 2014 G-20 Brisbane summit and growing tensions between the two nations. In early January 2016, after a visit to India, Varyag entered the Mediterranean Sea through the Suez Canal to be deployed off Syria′s shore replacing sister ship ,Крейсер \\"Варяг\\" вышел в Средиземное море, где сменит у берегов Сирии крейсер \\"Москва\\" TASS, 3 Jan 2016. in support of Russia's air operation in Syria that had begun in autumn 2015. The ship was named flagship of the Russian naval task force positioned in the eastern Mediterranean. On 21 April 2017, she visited Manila (Philippines), Kampan (Vietnam), Sattahil (Thailand), and Singapore. In late 2018 Varyag completed another long voyage to India.

The Rabinowitsch trick goes as follows. Let K be an algebraically closed field. Suppose the polynomial f in K[x1,...xn] vanishes whenever all polynomials f1,....,fm vanish. Then the polynomials f1,....,fm, 1 − x0f have no common zeros (where we have introduced a new variable x0), so by the weak Nullstellensatz for K[x0, ..., xn] they generate the unit ideal of K[x0 ,..., xn]. Spelt out, this means there are polynomials g_0,g_1,\\\\dots,g_m \\\\in K[x_0,x_1,\\\\dots,x_n] such that : 1 = g_0(x_0,x_1,\\\\dots,x_n) (1 - x_0 f(x_1,\\\\dots,x_n)) + \\\\sum_{i=1}^m g_i(x_0,x_1,\\\\dots,x_n) f_i(x_1,\\\\dots,x_n) as an equality of elements of the polynomial ring K[x_0,x_1,\\\\dots,x_n]. Since x_0,x_1,\\\\dots,x_n are free variables, this equality continues to hold if expressions are substituted for some of the variables; in particular, it follows from substituting x_0 = 1/f(x_1,\\\\dots,x_n) that : 1 = \\\\sum_{i=1}^m g_i(1/f(x_1,\\\\dots,x_n),x_1,\\\\dots,x_n) f_i(x_1,\\\\dots,x_n) as elements of the field of rational functions K(x_1,\\\\dots,x_n), the field of fractions of the polynomial ring K[x_1,\\\\dots,x_n]. Moreover, the only expressions that occur in the denominators of the right hand side are f and powers of f, so rewriting that right hand side to have a common denominator results in an equality on the form : 1 = \\\\frac{ \\\\sum_{i=1}^m h_i(x_1,\\\\dots,x_n) f_i(x_1,\\\\dots,x_n) }{f(x_1,\\\\dots,x_n)^r} for some natural number r and polynomials h_1,\\\\dots,h_m \\\\in K[x_1,\\\\dots,x_n]. Hence : f(x_1,\\\\dots,x_n)^r = \\\\sum_{i=1}^m h_i(x_1,\\\\dots,x_n) f_i(x_1,\\\\dots,x_n) , which literally states that f^r lies in the ideal generated by f1,....,fm. This is the full version of the Nullstellensatz for K[x1,...,xn].

It is the first book of the Millennium series. Background Larsson spoke of an incident which he said occurred when he was 15: he stood by as three men gang raped an acquaintance of his named Lisbeth. Days later, racked with guilt for having done nothing to help her, he begged her forgiveness—which she refused to grant. The incident, he said, haunted him for years afterward and in part inspired him to create a character named Lisbeth who was also a rape survivor. The veracity of this story has been questioned since Larsson's death, after a colleague from Expo magazine reported to Rolling Stone that Larsson had told him he had heard the story secondhand and retold it as his own. The murder of Catrine da Costa was also an inspiration when he wrote the book. With the exception of the fictional Hedestad, the novel takes place in actual Swedish towns. The magazine Millennium in the books has characteristics similar to that of Larsson's magazine, Expo, such as its socio-political leanings and its financial difficulties. Both Larsson's longtime partner Eva Gabrielsson and English translator Steven T. Murray have said that Christopher MacLehose (who works for British publisher Quercus) \\"needlessly prettified\\" the English translation; as such, Murray requested he be credited under the pseudonym \\"Reg Keeland\\". The English release also changed the title, even though Larsson specifically refused to allow the Swedish publisher to do so, and the size of Salander's dragon tattoo; from a large piece covering her entire back, to a small shoulder tattoo.  Plot  Every year for the past 36 years, Henrik Vanger receives an anonymous dried flower in a picture frame on November 1, his birthday. He has all of the frames displayed on a wall in his house. Every year, he phones his friend, a retired detective-superintendent, who shares his birthday and his age, and tells him about the latest flower. They can only wonder who sent it and why. In December 2002, Mikael Blomkvist, publisher of the Swedish political magazine Millennium, loses a libel case involving allegations about billionaire industrialist Hans-Erik Wennerström. Blomkvist is sentenced to three months (deferred) in prison, and ordered to pay hefty damages and costs. Soon afterwards, he is invited to meet Henrik Vanger, the retired CEO of the Vanger Corporation, unaware that Vanger has checked into his personal and professional history; the investigation of Blomkvist's circumstances has been carried out by Lisbeth Salander, a brilliant but deeply troubled researcher and computer hacker. Vanger promises to provide Blomkvist with evidence against Wennerström in return for discovering what happened to Vanger's grandniece, Harriet, who disappeared in 1966 during a family gathering at the Vanger estate on Hedeby Island the same day that a traffic accident on a bridge temporarily cut off the island from the mainland. Blomkvist stays on the island while researching the Vanger family history and Harriet's disappearance. He meets several members of the Vanger clan, including Harriet's brother, Martin, current CEO of the company; Isabella, Martin and Harriet's mother; and Cecilia, a headmistress who was Harriet's younger aunt and friend, who seduces Blomkvist later in the novel. Meanwhile, Salander's state-appointed legal guardian Holger Palmgren suffers a stroke. He is replaced by Nils Bjurman, who extorts sexual acts from Salander and eventually rapes her. After secretly recording her assault, Salander takes her revenge, torturing Bjurman and threatening to ruin him unless he gives her full control over her life and finances. She then uses a tattoo machine to brand him as a rapist. On Hedeby Island, Blomkvist pursues new evidence in Harriet's disappearance. A key piece of evidence is a series of photographs taken of Harriet at a parade shortly before she disappeared. These show her reacting with discomfort to something she sees. Blomkvist tracks down a photograph taken by someone who had been standing next to Harriet. He concludes that she was reacting to a young man standing across the street, but the image is too indistinct to identify him. Blomkvist also discovers a set of names and numbers believed to be old telephone numbers in Harriet's journal; however, his daughter Pernilla identifies them as quotes from the Book of Leviticus, which describe rules about violent punishment of women. Blomkvist correlates one of them with the grotesque murder of a Vanger Corporation secretary in 1949, and realizes that he may be on the trail of an old serial killer. Vanger's lawyer suggests Salander as a research assistant. Blomkvist realises that Salander hacked into his computer for the initial report, and confronts her to ask her for help with the investigation, to which she agrees. The two eventually become casual lovers. Meanwhile, Salander uncovers the remaining four murders corresponding to the Bible quotes in Harriet's journal, as well as several more that fit the profile. However, they realize this is more than just an old cold case when a local cat is left dismembered on their porch, and Blomkvist is shot at from a distance during an afternoon jog. Convinced that there must be a connection between the murders and the Vanger family, Salander searches through the Vanger Corporation archives. She notices that most of the murders occurred in locations where the corporation did business. She begins to suspect that the murderer was Gottfried Vanger, Martin and Harriet's deceased father, but she finds out that he died prior to the last murder. While Salander continues to hunt through the archives, Blomkvist identifies the young man in the photograph by matching the shirt he wore to the uniform of boys at Martin Vanger's school. However, before he can do anything, Martin takes Blomkvist prisoner, revealing that Gottfried \\"initiated\\" him into the ritual rape and murder of women before his own death, and implies that Gottfried sexually abused both him and Harriet. After Gottfried's death, Martin continued murdering women, but abandoned the religious themes which motivated his father. Martin questions Blomkvist about what he's discovered about Harriet and Blomkvist realizes that Martin did not murder his sister. Martin attempts to kill Blomkvist, but Salander — who had made the connection with Martin independently — arrives and attacks him. Martin flees by car, pursued by Salander, and commits suicide by purposely colliding with an oncoming truck. Believing that Cecilia's sister Anita, who now lives in London, is the only relative who might know something about Harriet's fate, Blomkvist and Salander tap her phone and learn that Harriet is still alive and living under Anita's name in Australia. When Blomkvist flies there to meet her, Harriet tells him the truth about her disappearance: her father Gottfried had repeatedly raped her, until she killed him in self-defense. That did not solve the problem however, as Martin took his father's role and continued to rape her. Harriet found some peace when Martin was sent away to preparatory school, but he returned the day of her disappearance. Harriet realized she would never be free of him unless she ran away, so she found a place to hide during the traffic accident, and Anita smuggled her to the mainland the next morning. Blomkvist persuades Harriet to return to Sweden, where she reunites with Henrik. Blomkvist then accompanies Salander to her mother's funeral. Back in Sweden, Blomkvist learns that the evidence against Wennerström that Vanger promised him is useless. However, Salander hacked Wennerström's computer and discovered that his crimes went far beyond what Blomkvist documented. Using her evidence, Blomkvist prints an exposé and a book which ruin Wennerström and catapult Millennium to national prominence. Salander, using her hacking skills, succeeds in stealing some 2.6 billion kr (about $260 million USD) from Wennerström's secret bank account. Blomkvist and Salander spend Christmas together in his holiday retreat. Shortly after, she goes to Blomkvist's home, intending to declare her love for him and give him a Christmas present, but when she sees him with his long-time lover and business partner Erika Berger, she throws the present in a dumpster and leaves. As a postscript, Salander continues to monitor Wennerström and after six months, anonymously informs a lawyer in Miami of his whereabouts. Four days later the body of Wennerström is found in Marbella, Spain, shot three times in the head.

Reviewer Robert Dessaix writes, \\"His favourite targets are violence against women, the incompetence and cowardice of investigative journalists, the moral bankruptcy of big capital and the virulent strain of Nazism still festering away ... in Swedish society.\\" Cecilia Ovesdotter Alm and Anna Westerstahl Stenport write that the novel \\"reflects—implicitly and explicitly—gaps between rhetoric and practice in Swedish policy and public discourse about complex relations between welfare state retrenchment, neoliberal corporate and economic practices, and politicised gender construction. The novel, according to one article, endorses a pragmatic acceptance of a neoliberal world order that is delocalized, dehumanized and misogynistic.\\" Alm and Stenport add, \\"What most international (and Swedish) reviewers overlook is that the financial and moral corruptibility at the heart of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is so profound as to indict most attributes associated with contemporary Sweden as democratic and gender-equal. The novel is in fact far from what American critic Maureen Corrigan calls an \\"unflinching ... commonsense feminist social commentary\\". (Corrigan's article was \\"Super-Smart Noir With a Feminist Jolt,\\" National Public Radio, 23 September 2008.) Larsson further enters the debate as to how responsible criminals are for their crimes, and how much is blamed on upbringing or society. For instance, Salander has a strong will and assumes that everyone else does, too. She is portrayed as having suffered every kind of abuse in her young life, including an unnecessary ordered commitment to a psychiatric clinic and subsequent instances of sexual assault suffered at the hands of her court-appointed guardian. Maria de Lurdes Sampaio, in the journal Cross-Cultural Communication, asserts that, \\"Blomkvist, a modern Theseus, leads us to the labyrinth of the globalized world, while the series' protagonist, Lisbeth Salander, modeled on the Amazon, is an example of the empowerment of women in crime fiction by playing the role of the 'tough guy' detective, while also personifying the popular roles of the victim, the outcast and the avenger.\\" In this context, she discusses \\"Dialogues with Greek tragedy... namely Salander's struggles with strong father figures.\\" Sampaio also argues, =Locked-room mystery= Larsson writes within the novel, in Chapter 12, \\"It's actually a fascinating case. What I believe is known as a locked-room mystery, on an island. And nothing in the investigation seems to follow normal logic. Every question remains unanswered, every clue leads to a dead end.\\" He supplies a family tree delineating the relationships of five generations of the Vanger family. Reception and awards The novel was released to great acclaim in Sweden and later, on its publication in many other European countries. In the original language, it won Sweden's Glass Key Award in 2006 for best crime novel of the year. It also won the 2008 Boeke Prize, and in 2009 the Galaxy British Book Awards for Books Direct Crime Thriller of the Year, and the prestigious Anthony Award for Best First Novel. The Guardian ranked The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo #98 in its list of 100 Best Books of the 21st Century. Larsson was awarded the ITV3 Crime Thriller Award for International Author of the Year in 2008. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo received mixed reviews from American critics. It debuted at number four on The New York Times Best Seller list. Alex Berenson wrote in The New York Times, \\"The novel offers a thoroughly ugly view of human nature\\"; while it \\"opens with an intriguing mystery\\" and the \\"middle section of Girl is a treat, the rest of the novel doesn't quite measure up. The book's original Swedish title was Men Who Hate Women, a label that just about captures the subtlety of the novel's sexual politics.\\" The Los Angeles Times said \\"the book takes off, in the fourth chapter: From there, it becomes classic parlor crime fiction with many modern twists....The writing is not beautiful, clipped at times (though that could be the translation by Reg Keeland) and with a few too many falsely dramatic endings to sections or chapters. But it is a compelling, well-woven tale that succeeds in transporting the reader to rural Sweden for a good crime story.\\" Several months later, Matt Selman said the book \\"rings false with piles of easy super-victories and far-fetched one-in-a-million clue-findings.\\" Richard Alleva, in Commonweal, wrote that the novel is marred by \\"its inept backstory, banal characterizations, flavorless prose, surfeit of themes (Swedish Nazism, uncaring bureaucracy, corporate malfeasance, abuse of women, etc.), and—worst of all—author Larsson's penchant for always telling us exactly what we should be feeling.\\" On the other hand, Dr. Abdallah Daar, writing for Nature, said, \\"The events surrounding the great-niece's disappearance are meticulously and ingeniously pieced together, with plenty of scientific insight.\\" The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette wrote, \\"It's a big, intricately plotted, darkly humorous work, rich with ironies, quirky but believable characters and a literary playfulness that only a master of the genre and its history could bring off.\\" The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo sold over 30 million copies by 2010.Winnipeg Free Press on The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo: \\"The first book sold 30 million copies and is available in 44 languages.\\" (15 April 2010) In the United States, it sold over 3.4 million copies in hardcover or ebook formats, and 15 million total by June 2011.

Career Ellis Island The American Seamen's Friend Society Sailors' Home and Institute, now \\"The Jane\\", a boutique hotel Boring studied first at the University of Illinois, then spent an additional year (1885) as a student at Columbia University. In 1886, he maintained a partnership in Los Angeles with architects Solomon I. Haas (1857–1945) and E.L. Caukins. From 1887 to 1890 Boring studied architecture at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris along with his friend Edward Lippincott Tilton. Boring and Tilton returned to New York in 1890 to work in the office of McKim, Mead, and White. In 1891 Boring and Tilton left McKim, Mead, and White to form their own architectural partnership. Among their notable works were the Casino in Belle Haven, Connecticut (1891) and the Hotel Colorado in the resort town of Glenwood Springs, Colorado (1891). The partnership's work culminated in the 1897 design for the new federal Immigration Station at Ellis Island. This work was honored with a gold medal for Architecture at the Exposition Universelle, Paris (1900); a gold medal at the Pan-American Exposition, Buffalo (1901); and a silver medal at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, St. Louis (1904). The partnership of Boring & Tilton ended in 1904. The men started working independently of one another but continued to share offices and equipment until 1915. In 1913, Boring was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member. In 1916, Boring joined the faculty of the Columbia School of Architecture, where he eventually became Director in 1919 and Dean from 1931 to 1932. As dean of architecture at Columbia Boring, and especially his successor Joseph Hudnut, encouraged the then-nascent modernism and incorporated studies in town planning.

He is not to be confused with his middleweight namesake, who is actually his son. Inspired by his compatriots Roberto Caminero \\"Chocolatico\\" Pérez, Enrique Regüeiferos, Félix Betancourt and Rolando Garbey who also hail from Santiago de Cuba, he started boxing in 1966. At the PanAm Games in Cali, Colombia (1971) he won gold against American Larry Carlisle, but it was not until he beat Betancourt at the national championships in 1972 that he was able to secure his ticket to the Olympics. There he knocked out defending champion Manfred Wolke and beat the rest on points to win the first Cuban welterweight gold. 1972 Olympic results Below is the record of Emilio Correa, a Cuban welterweight boxer who competed at the 1972 Munich Olympics: *Round of 64: bye *Round of 32: Defeated Damiano Lassandro (Italy) by decision, 5-0 *Round of 16: Defeated Manfred Wolke (East Germany) by technical knockout in the second round *Quarterfinal: Defeated Günther Meier (West Germany) by decision, 3-2 *Semifinal: Defeated Jesse Valdez (United States) by decision, 3-2 *Final: Defeated János Kajdi (Hungary) by decision, 5-0 (won gold medal) In 1974 Correa became the inaugural world champion at welterweight by knocking out American Clinton Jackson. From 1973 to 1976 he defended his national title and in 1977 won the national junior middleweight title. Internationally Correa didn't have much success after 1974. At the PanAm Games in Ciudad de México (1975) he lost a decision to Jackson. At the Olympics 1976 he lost inside the distance to Venezuelan Pedro Gamarro. *1st round bye *Defeated Plamen Yankov (Bulgaria) RSC 2 *Lost to Pedro Gamarro (Venezuela) RSC 3 He fought his last fight winning the junior middleweight title in 1979.

Four types of morphological adaptations include atrophy, hypertrophy, hyperplasia, and metaplasia. Atrophy Atrophy is a decrease in cell size. If enough cells in an organ undergo atrophy the entire organ will decrease in size. Thymus atrophy during early human development (childhood) is an example of physiologic atrophy. Skeletal muscle atrophy is a common pathologic adaptation to skeletal muscle disuse (commonly called \\"disuse atrophy\\"). Tissue and organs especially susceptible to atrophy include skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, secondary sex organs, and the brain. Hypertrophy Illustration of adipocytes of different sizes. In response to dietary excess energy intake, adipocytes adapt by increased storage of lipids, resulting in cellular hypertrophy. Hypertrophy is an increase in cell size and volume. If enough cells of an organ hypertrophy the whole organ will increase in size. Hypertrophy may involve an increase in intracellular protein as well as cytosol (intracellular fluid) and other cytoplasmic components. For example, adipocytes (fat cells) may expand in size by depositing more lipid within cytoplasmic vesicles. Thus in human adults, increases in body fat tissue occurs mostly by increases in the size of adipocytes, not by increases in the number of adipocytes. Hypertrophy may be caused by mechanical signals (e.g., stretch) or trophic signals (e.g., growth factors). An example of physiologic hypertrophy is in skeletal muscle with sustained weight bearing exercise. An example of pathologic hypertrophy is in cardiac muscle as a result of hypertension. Hyperplasia Hyperplasia is an increase in the number of cells. It is the result of increased cell mitosis or division (also referred to as cell proliferation). The two types of physiologic hyperplasia are compensatory and hormonal. Compensatory hyperplasia permits tissue and organ regeneration. It is common in epithelial cells of the epidermis and intestine, liver hepatocytes, bone marrow cells, and fibroblasts. It occurs to a lesser extent in bone, cartilage, and smooth muscle cells. Hormonal hyperplasia occurs mainly in organs that depend on estrogen. For example, the estrogen- dependent uterine cells undergo hyperplasia and hypertrophy following pregnancy. Pathologic hyperplasia is an abnormal increase in cell division. A common pathologic hyperplasia in women occurs in the endometrium and is called endometriosis. Metaplasia Metaplasia occurs when a cell of a certain type is replaced by another cell type, which may be less differentiated. It is a reversible process thought to be caused by stem cell reprogramming. Stem cells are found in epithelia and embryonic mesenchyme of connective tissue. A prominent example of metaplasia involves the changes associated with the respiratory tract in response to inhalation of irritants, such as smog or smoke. The bronchial cells convert from mucus-secreting, ciliated, columnar epithelium to non-ciliated, squamous epithelium incapable of secreting mucus. These transformed cells may become dysplastic or cancerous if the stimulus (e.g., cigarette smoking) is not removed. The most common example of metaplasia is Barrett's esophagus, when the non-keratinizing squamous epithelium of the esophagus undergoes metaplasia to become mucinous columnar cells, ultimately protecting the esophagus from acid reflux originating in the stomach. If stress persists, metaplasia can progress to dysplasia and eventually carcinoma; Barrett's esophagus, for example, can eventually progress to adenocarcinoma. Dysplasia Dysplasia refers to abnormal changes in cellular shape, size, and/or organization. Dysplasia is not considered a true adaptation; rather, it is thought to be related to hyperplasia and is sometimes called \\"atypical hyperplasia\\". Tissues prone to dysplasia include cervical and respiratory epithelium, where it is strongly associated with the development of cancer; it may also be involved in the development of breast cancer. Although dysplasia is reversible, if stress persists, then dysplasia progresses to irreversible carcinoma.

Her books include Wigan Pier Revisited (1984), Goliath: Britain's Dangerous Places (1993) and Diana, Princess of Wales: How Sexual Politics Shook the Monarchy (1998). She has also made films, including Listen to the Children (1990), a documentary about child abuse. Early life Campbell was born in Carlisle, Cumbria, England. She was educated at Harraby Secondary Modern School and Carlisle and County High School for Girls (grammar school), since 2008 the Richard Rose Central Academy. Her parents, Jim and Catherine Barnes, were Communist Party members. She had two younger siblings. Personal life Beatrix Barnes took the name Beatrix Campbell on her marriage to Bobby Campbell, a former Glasgow shipyard fitter and fiddle player, who was part of the renaissance of radical politics and music in Scotland in the early 1960s. They met in London at the end of 1966 and lived in a commune in Tower Hamlets. They divorced in 1978 but remained close friends until his death in 1998. Bobby encouraged Beatrix to get a job in journalism, and she joined him at the communist daily The Morning Star, formerly The Daily Worker, where he was the boxing correspondent. She became a sub-editor and later a reporter. She became deeply committed to the women's liberation movement in 1970, and from that time was oriented towards women and women's issues. Having come out as a lesbian aged 23, Campbell subsequently married a woman, with no thought given, she stated, to the distinction between 'civil partnership' and 'marriage'. Working and political life Campbell was fourteen when, in 1961, she took part in the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament's march from Aldermaston to London in protest against nuclear weapons, and was still a teenager when she joined the Communist Party. At that time the party was deeply divided over its relationship with the Soviet Union. She belonged to the party's anti-Stalinist wing that opposed the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. In London, she and Bobby Campbell joined a dissident group within the Communist Party founded by university lecturer Bill WarrenGeoff Andrews Endgames and New Times, p. 63 that produced a critique of both Stalinism and the party's economic policy. From the early 1970s Campbell's engagement with the Communist Party was increasingly as that of a feminist: from this perspective she challenged the tenets of the Communist Party, both its political approach to organising among women and its overall strategy. Geoff Andrews wrote of her opinions in his book End Games and New Times: The Final Years of British Communism 1964–1991Geoff Andrews Endgames and New Times,p. 224-243 feminism now \\"became a priority, not subordinate to some higher goal. It was a crucial part of redefining socialism\\". Campbell was one of a group of journalists on The Morning Star who in the early 1970s challenged the editor to break the paper's exclusive ties to the Communist Party and the trade union movement, and open a dialogue with newly emerging social movements. After the appointment of Tony Chater as editor in 1976 Campbell felt the struggle to reform the Star had been lost, and resigned, joining the journal Marxism Today and the Gramscian New Times. By the end of the 1970s Campbell was working principally for Time Out, whose staff were involved in a long strike and occupation in 1981 over equal pay for all and for the right of staff to be consulted about major investments. Ultimately, she and the majority of the staff left and started the cooperatively-owned London magazine City Limits. The emergence of the women's liberation movement changed Campbell's life. With Nell Myers, she set up a women's liberation movement group in Stratford, East London and in 1972 was in the group of women Communist Party members that founded Red Rag. It immediately opened itself up to women in the wider women's movement, describing itself not only as a Marxist but as a \\"feminist journal\\", and defining feminism as \\"the political movement which emerges as women's response to their own oppression\\". When the Communist Party banned Red Rag, the editorial collective's response was \\"it's not yours to ban\\", and the journal continued to flourish for ten years.Geoff Andrews Endgames and New Times,p. 66-69 In the 1980s, Campbell's writing focused on the transformation of Britain by Thatcherism. She set off on a six- month journey around England and wrote a polemical critique of George Orwell's book The Road to Wigan Pier (1937) and what she saw as the myopia of sexist socialism. She investigated the Conservative Party's appeal to women. She also became associated politically and professionally with the emergence of radical municipalism, particularly in London, under the leadership of Labour's Ken Livingstone. In 1998 Campbell reported on a Newcastle City Council report into allegations of child abuse at the Shieldfield Nursery in the city in 1993. She claimed the council inquiry was \\"stringent\\" and had found \\"persuasive evidence of sadistic and sexual abuse of up to 350 children\\". The alleged perpetrators were workers at the nursery, Dawn Reed and Christopher Lillie, who had already been cleared of multiple charges in a criminal trial in 1994. They subsequently successfully sued the Council, the \\"Independent Review Team\\" who produced the report, and the local Evening Chronicle newspaper for libel. Awarding Reed and Lillie the maximum possible damages of £200,000 each, the judge in the case made a \\"very rare\\" finding of \\"malice\\" on the part of the Independent Review Team, in that \\"they included in their report a number of fundamental claims which they must have known to be untrue and which cannot be explained on the basis of incompetence or mere carelessness.\\" One of the four people on the Independent Review Team was Campbell's close working partner Judith Jones.The Honourable Mr Justice Eady's judgement: Part 1 , Part 2 , Part 3 Campbell also wrote in favour of now discredited allegations raised in the Cleveland Child sex abuse Scandal as well as similar discredited allegations in Nottingham. On 9 February 1991 Campbell appeared on television discussion programme After DarkTV company website, accessed 4 May 2009 together with the then deputy director of Nottinghamshire social services Andy Croall and others. Campbell stood twice as a Green Party candidate in local elections, (in the London Borough of Camden) and in the 2010 parliamentary election (in Hampstead and Kilburn constituency), where she obtained only 1.4% of the votes, the seat being held by Labour's Glenda Jackson. She also co- authored several plays with Judith Jones, including And All the Children Cried, commissioned by West Yorkshire Playhouse, and Blame, performed in the Arcola Theatre, London. Honours and citations Campbell has received several academic honours including honorary doctorates conferred by Salford University, Oxford Brookes University and The Open University. Her work has gained her several awards, including the Cheltenham Literature Festival Prize in 1984 for the book Wigan Pier Revisited, the Fawcett Society Prize in 1987 for the book The Iron Ladies and the First Time Producers' Award in 1990 for her Dispatches documentary film Listen to the Children. In June 2009 Campbell was offered and accepted an OBE for 'services to equal opportunities'. Writing in The Guardian, she self-defined herself as a \\"republican with politics rooted in Marxism and feminism\\" and explained the apparent contradiction in accepting the award as: > By clinging to symbols and rituals that belong to a cruel imperial order the > government compromises the gonged.

This WEHC was the first station to go into operation in Virginia outside of Richmond and Norfolk. The station was programmed mostly by students and represented to the FCC by faculty member W. Byron Brown. After three years of operation, the Great Depression prompted the college to sell to Brown for $5,000 () in the fall of 1932. The station went off the air that December as Brown moved the physical facilities to Charlottesville, Virginia, where it is still in operation as WCHV. The current WEHC, which is legally unrelated to the original station, was founded in 1992. The original station kept the WEHC callsign until 1935, but it was never reused and remained available for the new station. =New transmitter and tower= WEHC worked with US Representative Rick Boucher (D-VA) to raise the $187,932 needed to build a brand new 199 foot tower and increase the station's power from 500 watts to nearly 10,000. On October 27, 2009, WEHC turned on their new transmitter, dramatically increasing their power from 500 to 8,700 watts.

It won the William Allen White Children's Book Award. The title character of the book would eventually become the name for Socks Clinton, the cat of U.S. President Bill Clinton and family.  Plot summary  The story is told from the perspective of a tabby cat with four white paws who lives with a young married couple, Bill and Marilyn Bricker. Initially, Socks and the Bricker couple are alone, and Socks receives a great deal of love and attention as a result. However, the Brickers soon have a baby son and Socks begins to feel as though he has been forgotten. Socks receives less attention than he normally would as the Brickers now spend most of their time caring for baby Charles William; he even ends up living in the garage for a short time when his behavior is misinterpreted as changed from the sweet cat the Brickers had adopted. The only person who seems to understand that Socks is lonely and is simply curious about Charles William is the kind Mrs. Risby, who comes to babysit and lavishes Socks with attention. Socks has several misadventures in the course of the book, culminating in a fight with another, more aggressive, neighborhood cat that leaves Socks bleeding; the Brickers are very frightened that he has been hurt. After this takes place, the Brickers realize they have been so wrapped up with the new baby that they have neglected Socks, and they resolve this by petting and hugging Socks to remind him they love him. They willingly bring him back into the house but are still cautious with letting him near the baby until Socks accidentally is locked in Charles William's room. Marilyn peers through the window and sees Socks curled up by him, purring, and Charles William sleeping peacefully. Socks discovers that he has a new friend in little Charles William and a new way to be part of the family. The book ends with Socks sleeping next to Charles William in his crib, Marilyn leaving them alone.

Established as a naturalist, he turned his attention to microlepidoptera and established contact with Philipp Christoph Zeller. In 1856, his parents and siblings travelled to Texas and joined the La Réunion socialist utopian community. The Bolls left the commune after the first year and established a farm in Dallas near the current Baylor Medical Center. Jacob visited his family in Texas circa 1867, and then returned to Switzerland. In 1869 he met with Louis Agassiz at Harvard, proceeding to Texas to collect animals for the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology. Returning to Switzerland he became a professional collector, working for Eduard Dämle and the Swiss government. Similar arrangements were made with Agassiz and in 1870 he collected insects in New England. Boll settled permanently in the U.S.A. after his wife Henriette (Humbel)s' death in 1873. He lived in Dallas. In 1878 he collected Permian vertebrate fossils in northwest Texas for Edward Drinker Cope of Philadelphia. These collections are now in the American Museum of Natural History.

She is portrayed by Beverley Callard. She made her first appearance on 27 October 1989 until Callard opted to leave and Liz departed on 13 November 1998. Callard reprised the role for a short stint with Liz appearing between 6 October 2000 and 12 January 2001. Callard reprised the role for two separate stints between 19 November and 30 November 2003 and between 13 February and 22 March 2004. She returned on a permanent basis on 22 June 2004. Callard quit the role once again with Liz's final episode airing on 14 April 2011. Callard reprised the role once again on a permanent basis and Liz returned on 14 October 2013. Callard quit the show in November 2019 and will make her final appearance in 2021. Her storylines have seen her embark on a series of failed romances, including marriages to Jim McDonald (Charles Lawson), which became abusive, and Vernon Tomlin (Ian Reddington). She has also had many feuds, notably with son Steve's (Simon Gregson) wives Karen Philips (Suranne Jones) and Becky Granger (Katherine Kelly). Her other feuds include Teresa Bryant (Karen Henthorn), Jenny Bradley (Sally Ann Matthews), Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford), Pat Phelan (Connor McIntyre) and Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne). Liz's emotional affair with Johnny Connor (Richard Hawley) eventually leads to Johnny's wife, Jenny, hitting Liz with her car in a hit-and-run storyline over Christmas 2018. Callard has claimed Liz's unique fashion sense stems from Alec Gilroy (Roy Barraclough) telling her that she could \\"aerate the space under her chin a bit more\\" in an episode early on in Liz's time on the Street. Storylines Liz first appears on Coronation Street in October 1989 with her husband, former army sergeant Jim (Charles Lawson), and their teenage twin sons, Steve (Simon Gregson) and Andy (Nicholas Cochrane). Liz makes friends with Deirdre Barlow (Anne Kirkbride), whose daughter Tracy (Dawn Acton) is slightly younger than Steve and Andy. Liz and Jim split up after Jim punches Steve during an argument, moving into the flat above the pub. Liz works as a barmaid at The Rovers Return Inn before being given her own pub, The Queens, to run. She moves into the flat above the pub and runs it with Jim, until he accuses her of cheating and causes a scene. Jim is then barred from the pub by the brewery. Liz and Jim split up and Liz runs the pub on her own. Shortly after, she begins a relationship with Colin (Ian Embleton), who is the brother of Des Barnes (Philip Middlemiss), but is not as invested in the relationship as he is. She later reconciles with Jim and they agree to work on their marriage but it doesn't last. Liz, now separated, was working for Sean Skinner in the bookie's. They flirted but it was ended by a criminal called Fraser Henderson. He noticed her when she was visiting Steve in prison and contacted her upon his release. He had Sean beaten but Liz gets involved with him regardless and he gives her a job in a wine bar he owns. Fiona Middleton's fiancé, police detective Alan McKenna (Glen Hugill) persuades Liz to get some inside information on Fraser, who leaves town when he discovers this. His henchman captures Liz and holds her and her sons captive in Number 11, where Liz manages to use her stiletto on the thug and the police arrest him. In 1998, after Jim is badly injured after falling from scaffolding following a fight with Steve on a building site, he becomes temporarily paralysed, needing physiotherapy and Liz, taking pity on him, moves back in to help take care of him. They grow closer but Liz soon becomes distracted by Jim's physiotherapist, Michael Wall (Dominic Rickhards) and starts an affair with him. Jim, who gradually learns to walk again, is planning to propose but throws Liz out after catching her in bed with Michael, and the two agree to a divorce. Liz and Michael leave Weatherfield for a new life together in Milton Keynes. Liz returns two years later when Jim is in prison for manslaughter after violently beating Jez Quigley (Lee Boardman) as revenge for Jez beating Steve. She is no longer with Michael. During this time she and Jim reconcile and remarry in the prison chapel. Liz leaves the Street again, following Jim around as he is transferred from one to another prison, getting jobs nearby so that she can visit. Liz returns for son Steve's marriage to Karen (Suranne Jones) wedding. Liz meets Vernon Tomlin (Ian Reddington), a workshy drummer. He is very laid-back and totally unlike Jim, but they have fun and Liz feels like a teenager again. The pair split when Liz, tired of being taken for granted and his roving eye, throws him out. He returns, begging her to take him back and they get engaged. When Jim is released Liz is wary of allowing him into her life. However, impressed by how he has changed, they stay friends, but when Jim corners her on her wedding day, her initial fears are justified. He tells her he loves her and will not allow the marriage to take place, launching a violent attack when Vernon intervenes. Liz suppresses her doubts about marrying Vernon and, determined not to let Jim win, goes ahead. The couple go on honeymoon to Nashville. Vernon and Liz go to view a bar, possibly intending to buy it. Liz admits to Vernon that she would not be happy and no longer loves him, ending their marriage. A devastated Vernon moves out of the Rovers that day. Liz finds herself attracted to builder Owen Armstrong (Ian Puleston-Davies), who is new to the area and openly flirts with him across the bar. She is disgruntled when he takes Eileen Grimshaw (Sue Cleaver) on several dates, but tries to hide it. Eventually she and Owen begin dating. In early December 2010, Liz hears rumours that Owen arranged for former husband Jim to be beaten up. She packs her bags and heads for Andy's home in Spain, leaving Steve to reveal to Owen that the relationship is over. Liz returns to discover that Steve and Becky bought Becky's nephew Max Turner (Harry McDermott) for £20,000, from Becky's sister Kylie (Paula Lane). She is further stunned when she learns that Becky looted from the corner shop, on the night of the tram crash three months previously, in order to give Kylie more cash. With the pub now under severe financial pressure, due to Steve and Becky buying Max, Liz is devastated. She makes her contempt for Becky clear from the outset, who responds by kicking Liz out of the pub. A desperate Liz then bumps into Jim at a hotel she is staying at. She seeks his support as she tells him of the situation that Becky and Steve have got themselves into. He suggests that she buy the pub but the bank manager refuses to give Liz a loan. Jim then suggests that he could buy the pub for Liz, as Steve and Becky decide to leave Weatherfield with Max and Amy. Liz makes her peace with the couple after they agree to the sale. Liz is now convinced that her dreams of owning The Rovers is going to come true and soon realises that she wants Jim to run it with her. The estranged couple soon reconcile. The date for the sale is set for 11 April 2011. Liz and Steve wait patiently at the Rovers, with the solicitor, for Jim to come in with the money for the sale. Liz is astonished when the police suddenly arrive at the pub to tell her that Jim has been caught robbing a bank and now has a number of hostages. Over the phone, Liz and Jim (from inside the bank) speak, he explains that he never had the money but wanted to buy The Rovers to make her happy. A frightened Liz convinces Jim to let the hostages go, discard his firearm and surrender to the police officers waiting outside the building. The day after his arrest, Liz visits Jim in prison and promises to wait for him. However, later that evening she decides to leave without telling Steve and Becky. After they have gone to bed, she leaves the pub and gets a taxi to the airport and flies out to Spain to live with Andy. Liz returns to the street again in October 2013. It transpires that both Steve and Liz have bought back The Rovers from former landlady, Stella Price (Michelle Collins), owning 50% each. She reveals she has remained in Spain since she was last in Weatherfield where she owned a villa and a health spa business but sold the health spa to invest in the Rovers when she learnt it was once again up for sale. Liz is stunned when she walks into The Rovers and finds Kylie and Tina McIntyre (Michelle Keegan) sharing a catfight in front of the bar. Liz and Kylie's friend Eva Price (Catherine Tyldesley) attempt to step in, but Liz watches in horror as Kylie accidentally slaps Eva. After throwing both Kylie and Tina out of the pub, Liz discovers that Steve hasn't told his girlfriend Michelle Connor (Kym Marsh) that she was co-owner. She is further surprised to learn that Michelle is co-landlady. Following a confrontation with Steve, Michelle resumes her friendship with Liz. Liz begins dating Tony Stewart (Terence Maynard). Later on, Steve sees that Tony isn't the nice man he pretends to be and tries to warn Liz, but she is having none of it and continues her relationship with Tony. Steve is diagnosed with depression and him and Michelle break up, until she declares her love for after he feels guilty when he crashes a bus. Michelle and Steve get engaged and they sell their share of the pub to an unknown company named Travis Limited. On Steve and Michelle's wedding day, however, Tracy Barlow (now portrayed by Kate Ford) tells her that her and Tony have been embarking on an affair and Travis Limited is actually Tony in a bid for them both to own the pub. Tony told Liz to sell the pub to move to Spain, but was actually going to make her sell her share as well to Travis Limited. Carla Connor (Alison King) decides go instead wrecking Tracy and Tony's plans causing Tracy to plot revenge against Carla. In July 2015 Liz is saddened when she discovers that her best friend Deirdre died whilst staying with her friend Bev Unwin (Susie Blake). In 2017, Steve had to sell his share of the Rovers as part of his divorce to Michelle so Liz decided to also sell her share and leave her pub. Off-screen in 2020, Liz decided to leave Weatherfield to live with Andy in Spain. Characterisation Liz as she appeared in 1991. In 1989, Beverley Callard was cast in the show as matriarch of the new McDonald family, after having previously played the part of June Dewhurst in 1984. Liz first appeared in October 1989 with her husband, ex-army sergeant Jim McDonald (Charles Lawson), and their twin sons Steve (Simon Gregson) and Andy (Nicholas Cochrane). Liz and Jim were married very young when Liz got pregnant. When asked in a 2010 interview with The Mirror what her favourite scenes were, Callard replied, \\"when Jim beat up Liz. I knew those scenes would have a huge impact. There were protests outside the studios and I had sacks of letters from battered wives. The scenes were so well written that one week viewers would have sympathy for Liz, the next Jim, then Liz. Opening those scripts gave me a buzz. And the viewing figures, 24 million, were massive.\\" Development =Reintroduction (2003)= On 14 August 2003, BBC News reported that Callard, along with Julie Goodyear (Bet Lynch) and Charles Lawson (Jim McDonald) would be returning for 10 episodes filmed in Blackpool with Callard and Lawson's return storyline being separate to Goodyear's storyline. A spokeswoman for the show said: \\"It's great news - they are all popular characters.\\" Viewers would also see Liz meet daughter-in-law Karen (Suranne Jones) for the first time. The pair have met before but only off- screen. The spokeswoman said: \\"It will be interesting to see how Karen and Liz get on - sparks are bound to fly.\\" The storylines were woven into the usual four-weekly episodes rather than being dedicated special programmes. It was reported that Liz would reunite with her family in episodes set in Blackpool, speaking of the storyline a Coronation Street spokeswomen said: \\"Fans will be on the edge of their seats when the week-long Blackpool adventure reaches an extraordinary finale involving a dramatic sea rescue and a tragic death.\\" In December 2003, Callard revealed that she would be returning again for Liz's son Steve (Simon Gregson)'s wedding to Karen, she said to the News of the World: \\"I'm definitely coming back, I've just worked for four weeks and I had such a great time there's no way I can turn down a chance to come back\\". On 4 February 2004, it was reported alongside the return of Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson) that Liz would return later that year. =Relationship with Lloyd Mullaney= In November 2008, it was revealed that Liz would embark on a relationship with Lloyd Mullaney played by Craig Charles. Speaking of his reaction when he was told about the relationship, Charles revealed: \\"Bev's a friend of me and my wife's, so it's all quite comfortable really. We get on really well, too. The relationship just opens up the whole scenario of Lloyd going out with his best mate's mum – and Steve definitely doesn't like it!\\" Charles also revealed that Steve McDonald's reaction to the relationship is that he is not impressed. Liz has had an on and off relationship with Lloyd Mullaney played by Craig Charles (pictured). Liz and Lloyd's relationship was revisited in August 2015 when Lloyd sleeps with Liz in the wake of his split from Andrea Beckett (Hayley Tamaddon). Lloyd immediately regrets spending the night with Liz, but he is backed into a corner when she explains to a horrified Steve that they have a future together. Asked in an interview with Digital Spy if he would ever put Liz and Lloyd together, Craig Charles replied: \\"Well they do have a history of course. On paper it is not the most obvious of matches but they do get on really well. This is probably not the best thing for either of them at the moment so it is no doubt doomed!\\" Charles later went on to reveal that Lloyd is the one who regrets it the most as he is very wry of upsetting both Liz and Steve (Simon Gregson). Lloyd and Liz are caught out the next morning by Steve and Michelle (Kym Marsh). Asked how Steve react to the news that Lloyd has slept with his mum, Charles replied: \\"Steve is horrified but Liz insists to Steve they have done nothing wrong and that they have a future together. This was not what Lloyd was thinking but he now has to go along with it.\\" Charles went on to say: \\"Steve is the person Lloyd is most worried about upsetting - they have only just got their friendship back on an even keel and now he is risking it again. But really he would be better being up front now, dragging it on is only going to make it worse in the end.\\" =Departure (2011)= On 20 October 2010, it was announced that Liz was to leave. Discussing her departure, Callard said \\"I've loved every minute of my second stint on the street - it's always a difficult decision to make the leap but I returned for the 40th, so leaving for the 50th feels like perfect timing. I'll miss everyone on the show but I'm looking forward to some new challenges and to see what life has to offer beyond Liz's famous mini skirts!\\" Producer Phil Collinson commented: \\"Bev has created an iconic and much-loved character in Liz. She will be greatly missed behind the bar of The Rovers by the viewers of the show. She's a lovely lady and is such a talented actress. We all wish her well in whatever she does next and we hope to see the character of Liz return sometime in the future. Plans are now being made for an exciting exit storyline for her departure next year.\\" In February 2011, it was announced that Lawson would be returning again to be a part of Liz's exit storyline. Speaking of the exit storyline, Callard said: \\"It's a fantastic exit and it's absolutely massive, but Liz may not be leaving on her own!\\" In March 2011, rumours of Liz's exit started. According to The Sun, poignant scenes on the ITV1 soap will see the landlady complete one final shift at her beloved pub before putting on her coat, walking to the door and taking in her surroundings for the last time as she turns off the lights. It is thought that bosses want the scenes to mirror the way iconic Rovers favourite Bet Lynch (Julie Goodyear) departed the cobbles in 1995. Liz leaves after ex-husband Jim (Charles Lawson) staged an armed robbery at Weatherfield's building society; he does so as part of a desperate attempt to raise funds in order to buy The Rovers. His plan goes wrong, and Jim is expected to be jailed for 10 years - leaving Liz heartbroken. She agrees to wait for him, but with little keeping her in Weatherfield and after reminiscing on good and bad times she decides to leaves the country without telling him or her family. She leaves for the airport with her last words being, \\"Go for it\\". =Reintroduction (2013)= On 30 May 2013, it was confirmed that Callard would be returning as Liz later that year; her return scenes aired in October 2013. Speaking of her return, Callard told itv.com: \\"I am coming home and I can't wait. I am so excited to be back, I have missed Liz so it will be great to play her again. Hopefully her skirts will have got a little bit longer, but we will see!\\" In October 2013, Beverley Callard revealed that Liz would have a boyfriend in an upcoming plot, she said: \\"She [Liz] is telling everyone she's single, but there is someone coming in for Liz. My God, it's so exciting, but I can't reveal anything else yet.\\" Tabloids reported that Liz's boyfriend would be portrayed by Jimi Mistry but this was later proved to be false. It was later revealed that Liz would embark on a romance with Tony Stewart portrayed by Terrance Maynard in an upcoming storyline. Speaking of the plot Maynard said; \\"It was always going to be the case that they'd get together, so I knew that from the start. What the writers weren't sure about was what would develop between Tony and Eileen and whether there'd be any tensions there. Liz and Tony are a bit of a double act and I think that could go further. I think at the moment Tony's really genuine with Liz - I don't think he's trying to deceive her in any way. I don't know who is 'the one' for Tony, but he's definitely happy with Liz!\\" On 31 March 2016, it was reported that Callard would be taking a break from the serial due to her battle with depression a show source confirmed this \\"She is taking some time off whilst her doctors look for a suitable alternative\\". On 29 April 2016, it was confirmed that she would resume filming the following week, with Callard writing on Twitter, \\"Oh thank you so much for all your fab messages! I’m much better! Back to work next week!!! Hurray, watch out Weatherfield!! Xxx.\\" =Departure (2021)= On 18 November 2019, it was announced that Callard had quit. In an interview with OK! magazine, Callard revealed that she informed ITV bosses of her plans to leave earlier that month. Recalling the moment, she said: \\"I was in shock, I felt totally numb,\\" before adding: \\"I’ve been told Liz is going to go with one hell of a bang. I can't wait!\\". MD of Continuing Drama and Head of ITV in the North John Whiston said: “With the character of Liz, Beverley Callard has gifted to Coronation Street 30 years of brilliant drama, comedy and everything in between. Whether it’s sharing a wicked joke with Eileen, raising an arch eyebrow behind the bar of the Rovers or giving some feckless man the full force of her tongue, Liz is a true Coronation Street icon, and while we wish Bev well when she leaves to take on new challenges mid next year, hopefully Weatherfield hasn’t seen the last of Liz!” It was reported that Callard filmed her final scenes in July 2020, but it was later announced that due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on television, Callard was unable to film her exit storyline, and her character was instead written out as having gone to Spain. Speaking to The Mirror, Callard commented \\"I'm due to film my final Corrie scenes in July and I have no idea what will happen. The only thing I've been guaranteed is that Liz is not going to die. It would be really good if she found love and happiness, but I can't see that happening. I'll miss the failed romances and the feuds, but not the fashion. On my last day I'll set fire to Liz's wardrobe.\\" On 30 August 2020 Callard announced that she would remain with the soap for another year and will return sometime in 2021 to film Liz's exit storyline. Her last appearance was Episode 10076 which was filmed in March 2020 which aired on 17 June 2020, as Callard underwent a routine hip operation which lead to complications. Callard declined an offer to return in a wheelchair for Liz when filming resumed after lockdown restrictions were eased.

The war ended when an alliance was signed between Great Britain and Spain, which was now under French invasion. Background In the War of the First Coalition, Spain declared war on the newly formed French Republic, joined the Coalition in attempting to restore the Bourbon Monarchy. The main Spanish general was Antonio Ricardos, who failed to secure a decisive victory, despite initial successes. French forces elsewhere quickly overran the Austrian Netherlands after the Battle of Fleurus, and the Dutch Republic collapsed under huge pressure. The Spanish were having similarly bad times. The Spanish navy did little, with the exception of combining with the British and participating in the Siege of Toulon. Following the Battle of the Black Mountain, the French Republic gained a huge advantage, and by 1795, the Peace of Basel was signed, forcing the Kingdom of Spain and the Kingdom of Prussia to exit the Coalition. In 1796, encouraged by massive French gains in the Rhine Campaign and the Italian Campaign, Spanish prime minister Manuel Godoy signed the Second Treaty of San Ildefonso, establishing a Franco-Spanish alliance and common war against Great Britain. The hope was that victorious France would also win over land and money for Spain.Allan J. Kuethe, and Kenneth J. Andrien, The Spanish Atlantic world in the eighteenth century: War and the Bourbon Reforms, 1713–1796 (Cambridge University Press, 2014). Paticularily against Spain's then main naval threat, Britain. The alliance continued the one hundred years of cooperation between France and Spain, broken only by the French Revolution. War =1796-1802= The war was damaging for Spain and for the Spanish Crown's revenues, with the British blockade greatly reducing the amount of wealth arriving from the colonies. A main Spanish fleet, under Jose de Cordoba y Ramos, had 27 ships of the line, however, and planned to link with the French and protect coveys of valuable goods. The British Mediterranean fleet had 15 ships of the line - heavily outnumbered by Franco-Spanish threats, forcing a retreat from Corsica and Elba by 1797. However, the Spanish Navy proved incapable of coordinating with its French Republican allies, and was heavily defeated at the Battle of Cape St Vincent. This left Spain in a disadvantaged position at sea for the rest of the war, even if they repulsed two British assaults on Cádiz and Tenerife and a later British expedition to Ferrol. = 1804-1808 = The Treaty of Amiens in 1802 provided for a temporary truce in hostilities, only to be broken in 1804 when, by surprise and without declaration of war, British ships attacked a Spanish squadron of frigates that was carrying gold and silver bullion to Cádiz. Spanish frigate Nuestra Señora de las Mercedes blew up and the others were captured by the British. The French planned an invasion of Britain in the coming year; the Spanish fleet was to be an integral part in assisting this invasion. At the Battle of Trafalgar, in 1805, a combined Franco-Spanish fleet, attempting to join forces with the French fleets in the north for the invasion, were attacked by a British fleet and lost in a decisive engagement. The British victory ended the immediate threat of an invasion of Britain by Napoleon. It also seriously shook the resolve of the unpopular Godoy-led Spanish government, which began to doubt the utility of its uncertain alliance with Napoleon. Meanwhile, a British campaign (1806–1807) to conquer the strategically important Rio de la Plata region in Spanish South America met with failure. Godoy withdrew from the Continental System that Napoleon had devised to combat Britain, only to join it again in 1807, after Napoleon had defeated the Prussians. Napoleon, however, had lost his faith in Godoy and Spanish King Charles IV. There was also growing support in Spain for the king's son, Ferdinand, who opposed the widely despised Godoy. Ferdinand, however, favoured an alliance with Britain, and Napoleon had always doubted the trustworthiness of any Bourbon royalty. Aftermath In 1807, France and Spain invaded Portugal, and, on 1 December, Lisbon was captured with no military opposition. In the beginning of 1808, the French presence in Spain was so predominant that it led to revolt. Napoleon then removed King Charles and his son Ferdinand to Bayonne and forced them both to abdicate on 5 May, giving the throne to his brother Joseph. This led to the Peninsular War and the de facto end of the Anglo-Spanish War, as George Canning, foreign secretary of His Majesty's Government, declared: :\\"No longer remember that war has existed between Spain and Great Britain. Every nation which resists the exorbitant power of France becomes immediately, and whatever may have been its previous relations with us, the natural ally of Great Britain.\\" Foy, p. 213 With this, the Bourbon Government of Spain, along with any Juntas claiming to represent it, became allies of Britain, as the Peninsular War embroiled.

It is used by South Shore Line trains. Ogden Dunes is a semi-gated community with one major access road off of U.S. Highway 12, and the station is located adjacent to where this road accesses the community. Portage/Ogden Dunes is a comparatively new station, built in 1998–1999 to replace the South Shore's former flag stop located about a hundred feet west. The new station also serves new residential subdivisions in and around Portage, Indiana. The Portage/Ogden Dunes station is close to the Inland Marsh and West Beach units of the Indiana Dunes National Park. The station has a single ground-level platform north of the tracks. Three small passenger shelters are positioned at the beginning, middle and end of the platform. South Bend bound riders are discharged in the space between inbound and outbound tracks, right over the wooden walkways that connect them to the platform. The station is accessible thanks to recently built ramp structures located on both sides of the track. They are designed to sync up to the first car of the train. Renovation As part of a larger project to double-track the South Shore Line, Portage/Ogden Dunes will see a renovation. Since the station is already double-tracked, it will not see a new track. However, a new high-level platform will be built adjacent to the southern (eastbound) track, with a gauntlet track to allow freight trains to pass. The existing platform adjacent to the northern (westbound) track will remain unchanged and is already accessible to passengers with disabilities due to the ramp structure. The renovation will also add a new parking lot with 354 spaces to the south of the station and a signalized pedestrian crossing of the Dune Highway to connect the station to the lot.

The movement is prominent outside Senegal as well, in places such as New York, Paris and Rome. Bara Mbacké became Grand Marabout of the Mouride movement after the death of his uncle, Serigne Saliou Mbacké, on 28 December 2007. He died of natural causes at the age of 85. His death was mourned by millions of people, and Senegal declared an eight-day period of national mourning. Biography Sheikh Bara Mbacké was the grandson of the founder of the Mouride. He was the sixth caliph of Mouridism. As the nephew of the fifth caliph Serigne Saliou Mbacké, he was the first caliph who was not a son of Sheikh Amadou Bamba, the founder of the Mouride movement. Bara Mbacké succeeded Serigne Saliou Mbacke as Shaykh who was credited for his transformation of the village of Touba into Senegal's second largest city,\\"Senegalese Islamic leader dies\\". Aljazeera. December 30, 2007. and for the enormous growth in popular devotion and political power of the brotherhood both throughout West Africa and (through the diaspora) the world. It has been reported that Serigne Saliou Mbacke personally chose his successor, and that the grandsons of Amadou Bamba (including Serigne Saliou Mbacke's son, Serigne Cheikh Saliou Mbacké) have all pledged their loyalty to the new caliph, and that Bara Mbacké was visited by both President Abdoulaye Wade and Senegalese opposition leaders within 48 hours of his uncle's death.ATTITUDE - Présentation de condoléances : Serigne Moustapha Saliou boude Wade, LeQuotidien: 31 Dec 2007. and MANOEUVRES POLITIQUES A TOUBA : Ayant boudé le Président Wade, Serigne Moustapha Saliou reçoit Macky Sall, Nettali: 31 Dec 2007. Bara Mbacké was one of the sons of Mouhamadou Fallilou Mbacké, himself the second caliph and son of Sheikh Amadou Bamba. At 85 he was the oldest man to be appointed caliph of the Mouride. He was reported to have been trained by his father while caliph (1945-1968), and was said to speak a number of languages, including Arabic, French and English. Death Bara Mbacké had been ill for months before his death in Touba on June 30, 2010. Just before his death he had been hospitalised at a clinic in the Senegalese capital, Dakar. Bara Mbacké's successor as Grand Marabout was his cousin, Cheikh Maty Leye Mbacke. President of Senegal Abdoulaye Wade took a helicopter ride from Dakar to Touba to swear allegiance to the new leader. Senegalese Prime Minister Souleymane Ndéné Ndiaye announced his death on state radio that morning. His said Bara Mbacké's death was a \\"very great loss for all the nation\\", and praised his \\"erudite wisdom\\". President Wade, a Mouride himself, joined the people of Senegal in mourning events. Other officials, including the prime minister, Senate president and several government ministers joined him. Senegal entered an eight-day period of national mourning. Hundreds of thousands to even millions of people mourned his death. Traffic in Dakar was noticeably lighter as people went to Touba to mourn. Hymns and readings from the Koran, as well as images of mourning crowds were aired on state television. He was buried at Touba's main mosque.

Primarily within the Plumas National Forest, its course extends from Paxton (north of Quincy) to Belden. Course The East Branch is formed by the confluence of Indian Creek and Spanish Creek just upstream of Paxton. Indian Creek and Spanish Creek drain an extensive watershed along about of the Sierra Crest in eastern Plumas County, along its border with Lassen County. Indian Creek is long, but is long measured to the head of its tributary Last Chance Creek. Spanish Creek, the smaller of the two, is about long. From the confluence, the East Branch winds west for through a steep and narrow canyon until its confluence with the North Fork near Belden, about northeast of Oroville. The river canyon is an important transportation corridor, forming route for SR 70, which parallels the north bank of the river, and for the Union Pacific Railroad's Feather River Route on the south bank. The Feather River Route was originally constructed between 1906 and 1909 while the highway was built in the 1920s. There are several large alluvial valleys in the East Branch watershed. Indian Creek flows through Indian Valley, which includes the communities of Greenville and Taylorsville. Spanish Creek flows through the American Valley, which includes Quincy, the county seat of Plumas County. Settlers drained the valley's wet meadows for cattle and hay production, and its stream channels are deeply incised (beavers were nearly eliminated).

The convergence of several streams there creates the Sierra Valley Channels, the largest of which is Little Last Chance Creek, flowing out of Frenchman Lake across the northeast side of the valley. Flowing west, it is joined by Big Grizzly Creek, with waters from Lake Davis. The river continues west, passing Portola and turning northwest at Clio, where it is joined by Sulphur Creek.

Born into a prominent political family in the colonial Province of North Carolina, he was one of only five generals from North Carolina to serve in the Continental Army. Moore spent much of his childhood and youth on his family's estates in the lower Cape Fear River area, but soon became active in the colonial military structure in North Carolina. Moore served in the colonial militia during the French and Indian War, and commanded the colonial governor's artillery at the Battle of Alamance, which ended the War of the Regulation. In addition to his military involvement, he was active in the independence movement, despite having been a supporter of the colonial government during his early career. Moore played a prominent role in the local Sons of Liberty organizations, and assisted in organizing the colony-wide extra-legal Provincial Congress. In 1775, he was elected the first commander of a Continental Line regiment in North Carolina, which had been raised following the instructions of the Continental Congress. After distinguishing himself in the campaign that led to the Patriot victory at the Battle of Moore's Creek Bridge, and the battle's aftermath on February 27, 1776, Moore was promoted to brigadier general in the Continental Army. He maintained his headquarters in North Carolina during early 1776 to thwart a threatened British invasion of the state but, in the latter part of the year, received orders to move his command to South Carolina. Moore briefly held de facto command of the Southern Department before his death due to illness in April 1777. He is remembered as a competent military commander whose early death ended a promising career.  Early life and family  alt=A map depicting a stretch of the Cape Fear River approximately 18 miles long between its mouth and where the river divides into two branches James Moore was born in New Hanover Precinct in the Cape Fear region of the Carolinas in about 1737., though other sources claim 1729 as his birth year (see ), 1737 appears most frequently in his biographies. His family had extensive landholdings at Rocky Point, located at a bend in the Cape Fear River about north of Wilmington. He was the son of Maurice Moore, I and his second wife, Mary Porter. His older brother, also named Maurice Moore, II, would go on to become a Patriot political leader in North Carolina during the American Revolution. His sister, Rebecca Moore, would marry a Revolutionary War leader, militia General John Ashe.See Moore family (Carolinas) for a short description of the Moore family in the Carolinas Moore was, through his father's side, a grandson of Governor James Moore, who was governor of the Province of Carolina when North and South Carolina were a single colony. Maurice Moore had championed settlement of the Cape Fear region under Governor George Burrington. Additionally, Moore's uncle, Colonel James Moore, was a military leader during the Yamasee War. Moore's nephew, Alfred Moore, served in the Continental Army under Moore's command and would go on to become an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Moore's niece, Mary, would later marry Moore's Continental Army colleague Francis Nash. Moore's extended relatives constituted the single most powerful family in the region, and were known by local settlers simply as \\"the Family\\". His nine aunts and uncles, and seventeen siblings and cousins on his father's side, married into other affluent families, developing a strong network in the region that perpetuated their wealth and influence, and increased their slaveholdings in each successive generation. By the time of the American Revolution, six of the ten largest slaveholders in the lower Cape Fear region were in some way related to Moore. The Moore family relied on the production of naval stores and lumber, as the lower Cape Fear was unsuited to mass cultivation of more profitable products and crops like rice and indigo. One early description of Moore states that he spent his early years on his father's plantation until that tract sold in 1761. In his adulthood, Moore married Anna Ivey, with whom he had two sons and two daughters, all of whom survived him at his death. One son, James Moore Jr., would serve in the American Revolutionary War as a lieutenant before being permanently disabled by wounds received at the Battle of Eutaw Springs.  Colonial political and military service  James Moore had experience as a military officer before the American Revolution. In 1758, Governor Arthur Dobbs appointed him as the captain of a provincial garrison company at Fort Johnston, and Moore remained in command of that unit during the French and Indian War. During that conflict, Moore was captain of a company he led to South Carolina to defend that colony against Cherokee attacks brought on by the Anglo-Cherokee War. By 1759, he was appointed a justice of the peace. In protest of the Stamp Act, in 1766 Moore led an armed mob that occupied the de facto capital town of Brunswick, North Carolina. The mob appointed Moore as its delegate to confront Governor William Tryon and the royal comptroller of customs, William Pennington, who had taken refuge at Tryon's home. Pennington gave in to the demands of the mob, and resigned his post, swearing that he would not enforce the provisions of the Stamp Act. Moore served as a colonel of an artillery company in the colonial militia during the War of the Regulation, a revolt by western settlers against perceived injustices in the colonial government of North Carolina in the decade immediately preceding the American Revolution. At the Battle of Alamance, Moore served as the commander of Governor Tryon's artillery company. Moore's orders in that engagement were to fire his cannons once Tryon had determined the Regulators would not surrender, thus signaling the beginning of the battle. During the conflict, however, the governor's artillery functioned poorly, and the Regulators were able to gain an initial advantage by fighting in an irregular fashion. The governor's forces eventually succeeded in crushing the armed farmers, thus ending the Regulator rebellion. Moore went on to serve in the North Carolina House of Commons from 1764 to 1771 and again in 1773, representing his home county of New Hanover. In 1772, he purchased a plantation of on the Cape Fear River several miles upriver from Wilmington.  American Revolution  = Revolutionary activities = Moore participated in the Wilmington chapter of the Sons of Liberty beginning in 1770, and through them organized a boycott of imported British goods on the Cape Fear River. On July 21, 1774, Moore was elected to a Wilmington-based committee tasked with organizing the First North Carolina Provincial Congress with other counties. Moore also participated in the New Hanover Committee of Safety, and worked with other local citizens to raise supplies for Boston, whose port had been closed to all commerce in 1774 by the Boston Port Act. In August 1775, he was elected to the Third Provincial Congress, which organized the colonial militia and placed Moore in command of the first regiment raised to be trained as regular soldiers. At the time, Loyalist-sympathizer and Cape Fear-area diarist Janet Schaw described her fear of Moore as the commander of the Patriot militia, stating: Moore's appointment as commander of the first regiment of what would become the North Carolina Line came at the expense of his brother-in-law, John Ashe, who actively sought the appointment. Moore bested Ashe by only a single vote in the Provincial Congress. His service dates were: * Colonel over the New Hanover County Regiment of the North Carolina militia (1775) * Colonel over the 1st North Carolina Regiment (17751776) * Brigadier General over the 1st Brigade (4th, 5th and 6th Regiments) of the North Carolina Line (1776) * Brigadier General of the Southern Department of the Continental Army (17761777) = Moore's Creek Bridge campaign = thumbrightMap depicting movements before the Battle of Moore's Creek Bridge: A: James Moore moves north toward Cross Creek, to confront the Loyalists B: Loyalists move south towards Wilmington C: Caswell moves from New Bern confront the Loyalists alt=Moore moves from Wilmington, in the southeast of the state, northwest toward Cross Creek in the south-central part of the state. Caswell moves south from New Bern, inland from the middle of the North Carolina coast, toward Corbett's Ferry. MacDonald moves over the Cape Fear River and then southeast toward Corbett's Ferry. On February 15, 1776, Moore was given command of the 1st North Carolina Regiment raised at the direction of the Second Continental Congress, and placed in charge of the defense of the Cape Fear region. At the same time, the colonial government in New Bern organized militia units under Colonel Richard Caswell, and sent this force south to meet up with Moore's regiment of regulars and several other units of militia. A force of approximately 1,400 Highland Scots denizens of North Carolina who remained loyal to Britain was organized shortly after the outbreak of hostilities in 1775. This force, concentrated around the Loyalist hotbed of Cross Creek (near modern-day Fayetteville), alarmed the Patriot government, who dispatched Moore and Caswell to contain the growing army. The British Army and Royal Navy, in cooperation with the Loyalist elements of the colonial government under Governor Josiah Martin, planned an invasion of North Carolina near Wilmington, a burgeoning and strategically located seaport in the Cape Fear region. The Highlander units at Cross Creek were directed to join up with British Army units, which General Thomas Gage intended to land in North Carolina. Moore led his command upriver along the south bank of the Cape Fear and fortified a river crossing at Rockfish Creek, which would have been the Loyalists' most direct path to Wilmington. At this site, Moore continued to gather reinforcements, eventually commanding approximately 1,100 men. Brigadier General Donald MacDonald, who commanded the militia of approximately 1,500 Highlanders, sent an envoy to Moore, demanding that he join the Loyalist cause or be faced with an attack. Moore, delaying in his reply to buy time, eventually declined that demand, essentially calling MacDonald's bluff. MacDonald, whose men lacked the morale for an immediate confrontation, received word that Caswell's militia had been ordered to join with Moore. Sensing that time was of the essence, MacDonald withdrew, and led the Loyalist contingent away from Moore toward a crossing further downriver. Moore next set about devising a trap for MacDonald's Loyalist contingent. He positioned a detachment of men at Cross Creek, and ordered the regiments of Colonels Caswell and Alexander Lillington to a location downriver in the path of the Loyalist militia. The Loyalist force managed to slip past Caswell, at which point Moore ordered Caswell to join up with Lillington at a location known as Moore's Creek Bridge. Simultaneously with Caswell's corrective maneuver, Moore floated his troops downriver, where they disembarked and joined in the pursuit of MacDonald's force. In the Battle of Moore's Creek Bridge, the Loyalists attempted to cross over the creek in the early morning hours of February 27, 1776, where they were met with fierce resistance from Caswell and Lillington's united forces. The Patriots routed the Loyalists in less than three minutes, inflicting severe casualties on MacDonald's men and capturing 850 loyalist soldiers and officers, while themselves suffering only a single casualty. Moore did not participate directly in the battle, but arrived shortly after it was decided, and pursued the remaining Loyalist units. Moore's Creek Bridge stopped the British plan for the conquest of North Carolina and was celebrated by Patriots throughout the colonies. The British press of the time downplayed the victory as a defeat of Loyalist forces rather than of regular British Army units. On March 4, 1776, the Provincial Congress in New Bern passed a resolution thanking Moore for his service in suppressing the Loyalists. = Continental Army general = alt=A cartouched black-and- white portrait of General Henry Clinton from the chest up in uniform On March 1, 1776, the Continental Congress voted to give Moore a commission as a brigadier general in the Continental Army, and placed him in command of all of the regular army forces in North Carolina. Moore was one of only five North Carolinians to achieve the rank of brigadier general or higher in the Continental Army. As a brigadier, he served under General Charles Lee, commander of the army's Southern Department, and was tasked with guarding Wilmington from attacks by British ships lurking in the Cape Fear area after the Battle of Moore's Creek Bridge. In that capacity, Moore alternately harassed and observed the British and their Loyalist auxiliaries while simultaneously improving Wilmington's defenses by erecting two new coastal batteries, and by sinking ships in the main channel of the Cape Fear River south of the city to bar passage by larger vessels. In April and May 1776, some British units from the approximately 7,000-strong force of General Henry Clinton disembarked near Wilmington, and threatened to confront Moore's garrison of 1,847 men. Clinton soon decided that North Carolina was not an ideal objective, and the majority of the British fleet and army made its way south to Charleston on May 30, 1776. After the near-engagement at Wilmington, Moore devised a plan by which the Provincial Congress raised five additional companies of men to defend North Carolina's coast. He saw this as necessary because the Continental Army units in North Carolina could be ordered out of the state, which would have left North Carolina relatively defenseless. Lee was recalled to the north to aid in the defense of New York in September 1776, and Moore was placed in command of the Southern Department. Initially, the Continental Congress ordered Moore to join General George Washington in the north, but owing to the continued threat of a British attack in North or South Carolina, Congress suspended Moore's orders and gave North Carolina's Provincial Council discretion over his disposition. On October 23, 1776, the Council ordered Moore to remain in North Carolina and winter his troops in New Bern and Wilmington. This order was confirmed by the Continental Congress on November 16, along with instructions for Moore to assist in repelling any invasion attempts in South Carolina or Georgia, if necessary. Moore then led his command of about 2,035 men south to Charleston, South Carolina in November to assist the Patriot forces there after the attempted British assault at Sullivan's Island. Moore's brigade arrived in January, but Moore spent most of his time traveling between Charleston and North Carolina, lobbying for funds and clothing for his poorly equipped soldiers, and recruiting more men. He went so far as to obtain a private loan from Thomas Polk, a planter in Mecklenburg County, for $6,250 in South Carolina currency to pay for rations for his command. Moore's unit engaged in daily drills under his supervision and that of Colonel Francis Nash. Despite these efforts, the North Carolinians suffered from rampant colds and pneumonia, and many of the enlisted men deserted to join the South Carolina line because of the high bounty being offered by that state for service. In February 1777, the Continental Congress commanded Moore to bring North Carolina's Continental Army troops north to aid Washington, but a lack of supplies and provisions stalled that plan. Moore himself had returned to North Carolina on January 8, 1777, in an attempt to alleviate the poor conditions in which his soldiers found themselves, and to raise funds to pay his men, leaving the Southern Department under the command of Brigadier General Robert Howe. Howe countermanded Moore's instructions to bring the Continental Army units north by refusing to permit the North Carolina brigade to leave Charleston out of fear of a British attack in the south. Because of Moore's failing health, Francis Nash was promoted to brigadier general, and assumed command of the brigade on its march north.  Death and legacy  While preparing to march north in early 1777, Moore became ill. He died of what was called \\"a fit of gout in his stomach\\" on about April 15, 1777., n.b. that other sources state Moore's death as occurring in January 1777 (see ), or on April 9 (see \\"Marker: D-26 – JAMES MOORE\\", supra) or April 22, 1777 (see ), but the latter date in April is incorrect, given that Moore's death was discussed in correspondence as early as April 19 (see ); April 15 is the most frequently given date, and conforms with the recollection of James Walker, who was Moore's executor, that he died in April (see ). Oral tradition holds that Moore died on the same day and in the same house as his brother, Maurice. Anne, Moore's wife, died a few months thereafter. Moore, who had not been directly involved in any military engagement during the Revolutionary War, was nonetheless able to construct a working military force out of the disparate parts provided for him by North Carolina. Samuel A'Court Ashe, an early North Carolina historian, described Moore as \\"perhaps the most masterful military man furnished by North Carolina to the war of independence.\\" Another historian speculated that Moore's \\"actions had held the promise of greatness.\\" Moore's strategic command before and during the Battle of Moore's Creek Bridge has been acclaimed as a major factor in the Patriot victory there. The Wake Forest, North Carolina chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution and a U.S. Army battery at the now defunct Fort Casey in Washington state were named in his honor. In 1940, the North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources erected a North Carolina highway historical marker in Pender County near Moore's former home at Rocky Point commemorating his life and Revolutionary War service.

It is a woody shrub or small tree with relatively long, linear leaves arranged in whorls, and with irregular groups of creamy-white flowers in spring. Description Verticordia verticillata is an openly branched shrub or small tree possessing a lignotuber and which grows to a height of up to and a width of . The leaves are arranged in whorls of three or four and are linear in shape, semi-circular to triangular in cross-section, long, wide with a pointed end. The flowers are faintly scented and arranged in irregular groups in leaf axils on stalks long. The floral cup is shaped like a hemisphere, long, glabrous and more or less smooth. The sepals are spreading and creamy-white, long, with about 6 hairy lobes. The petals are a similar colour to the sepals, egg-shaped, long, joined for about of that length and have irregular teeth around their edge. The style is long, straight with hairs just below its tip. Flowering time is mainly from August to October, sometimes in other months following rainfall. This species can be distinguished from Verticordia cunninghamii and Verticordia decussata, which sometimes occur in the same area, by its whorled leaves and much longer style. Taxonomy and naming Verticordia verticillata was first formally described in 1977 by Norman Byrnes from a specimen collected on Eva Valley Station in the Northern Territory. The description was published in the journal Austrobaileya. The specific epithet (verticillata) is derived from the Latin word verticillus meaning \\"a whorl\\" referring to the leaf arrangement of this species. Distribution and habitat Tropical featherflower is widespread in the Kimberley region in Western Australia, and in the north of the Northern Territory, including some of the offshore islands. It grows in sand, often with loam or gravel in open shrubland and woodland. Conservation This verticordia is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife and as \\"of least concern\\" in the Northern Territory.

The mall originally opened on October 29, 1986 with J. C. Penney and Shopko as anchor tenants. Today, the mall is anchored by J. C. Penney, Hobby Lobby, Kohl's, and Magic Valley Cinema 13. History =Development and opening= In February 1979, Lewis Douglas Co. proposed plans for a shopping mall in Twin Falls on land owned by farmer Oren Boone located at the northeast corner of Blue Lakes Boulevard and Pole Line Road. In March 1980, General Growth Properties purchased the site from Lewis Douglas Co. and announced plans for Canyon Ridge Mall. The proposed 512,000 to 700,000 square-foot mall would consist of four department stores and 90 specialty stores with a completion date of fall 1982 or early 1983. At the same time, Woodbury Corporation announced plans to separate shopping mall across from Canyon Ridge Mall on the west side of Blue Lakes Boulevard. By May 1980, zoning changes were approved to allow construction of both shopping malls. In February 1981, a third mall, developed by Price Development Corporation, received zoning change to construct on a 30 acre site south of the Canyon Ridge Mall site on Pole Line Road. After facing opposition from the nearby Green Acres housing subdivision, Twin Falls City Council denied the zoning change, which triggered a two-year court battle between the city and Price. In September 1983, Price abandoned its original plan and acquired the Canyon River Mall site from General Growth Properties. Price's new plans called for a smaller 450,000 square-feet mall with four department stores. Twin Falls City Council approved the development in February 1984. In May 1984, a spokesman for Price confirmed it was courting The Bon Marché, J. C. Penney, and ZCMI to anchor the shopping mall. ZCMI was ruled out as a potential anchor in March 1985. Two months later, Shopko announced plans to anchor the new mall, now named Magic Valley Mall, as part of a plan to open six stores in Idaho. The Bon Marché and J. C. Penney were later confirmed to relocate from downtown Twin Falls to the mall. J. C. Penney also announced the closure of a store in Jerome as part of its plan to open at the mall. Price Development broke ground on Magic Valley Mall on August 21, 1985. The mall's first tenant, Shopko, opened on October 13, 1986, with J. C. Penney and other smaller tenants opening on October 29. The Bon Marché opened on July 30, 1987. =Later additions= In November 1988, Sears announced plans to relocate from downtown Twin Falls to the mall. The store opened on August 2, 1989. A fifth anchor tenant, Lamonts, was added to the mall in February 1992, but closed in December 1996. In 1995, a strip mall was built next to the mall with Barnes & Noble as an anchor. In September 1998, Reel Theaters opened a six-screen discount movie theater in the space formerly occupied by Lamonts. The theater was sold to Interstate Amusements in May 2000 and renamed Odyssey Theater. In August 2003, The Bon Marché was renamed Bon- Macy's and became a full-fledged Macy's in January 2005. In March 2011, Cinema West announced to plans replace the Odyssey Theater with a new, larger cinema complex. Odyssey Theater was shut down in September 2011, with the new Magic Valley Cinema 13 opening in May 2012. On August 1, 2017, Macy's announced it would not renew its lease at the mall and shut down in early 2018. On January 4, 2018, Sears announced it would close its store at the mall in April. The Macy's store was replaced by Hobby Lobby in September 2018. On February 6, 2019, Shopko announced it would close on May 12, 2019. On August 5, 2019, Kohl's confirmed it will open a store in the former Sears building. The store opened on May 11, 2020.

Crossfire was originally designed to allow for company-sized battles and World War II scenarios. It employs an innovative rules system eliminating the need for a ruler.  Game Mechanics  The game needs neither a ruler nor fixed game turns. Essentially, CF knows only two ranges, point blank (in close assaults) and everything else, the basic assumption being that everything on the map is within rifle range - in other words, everything that can be seen can be hit. As a consequence, CF works only properly on tables where much terrain is used in order to allow movement unseen by the opponent. In order to overcome traditional turn-based systems CF operates with \\"initiatives\\". A player can order his troops in any way (movement, fire or rally actions) and in any order during his initiative, and keeps on doing so until one of his actions fails; then the initiative passes on to his opponent. CF in its basic form is mainly concerned with infantry combat, leaving not much room for the employment for AFVs. Nevertheless using AFVs in scenarios has become very popular with wargamers; therefore a number of different unofficial \\"home rules\\" have been published on fan sites, allowing the inclusion of AFVs in battles.  Figure and Ground Scale  CF uses an abstract figure scale - a basic infantry stand (usually holding three figures) represents a squad of infantrymen while single heavy infantry weapons are represented by single models; it is also playable on a 1/1 figure scale, though this is unsupported by the official rules and only a minority of gamers seem to prefer this. The ground scale is a matter of discussion among CF wargamers; many see the ground scale at 1/300, though other ground scales up to 1/72 are in use as well.

The system is a department of the city of Mobile and receives funding from Mobile County and the city of Saraland. History The Mobile Public Library has roots going back to the 1850s, when it was started as a subscription organization by the Franklin Society. The library was officially established as the Mobile Public Library in 1902 and was originally housed in an antebellum structure at the corner of Conti and Hamilton Street.Thomason, Michael. Mobile : the new history of Alabama's first city,pages 201-202. Tuscaloosa : University of Alabama Press, 2001. The library association appealed to city leaders in the late 1910s to provide operating funds for the library, and it offered to give the city the library property if it would build a new building to house the collections. The city declined to finance the construction of a new building, but did approve operating funds on 2 April 1918. Due to increasing public demand for a library, on 15 December 1925, the city commissioners voted to schedule a special election on a $250,000 bond issue. The voters approved the bond and, along with a gift of $30,000 from Eli H. Bernheim of New York City, the new library building was constructed. Noted Mobile architect George Bigelow Rogers designed the building in the Classical Revival style. The new structure, now known as the Ben May Main Library, was opened on 15 September 1928. The state had passed racial segregation laws at the turn of the century after disenfranchising most blacks and many poor whites in the state, excluding them from politics. Mobile's African-American community did not have access to a public library until one was completed for them in 1931; it was known as the Davis Avenue Branch. It was also designed by George Bigelow Rogers. It was funded by a city bond issue and the city's sale of the old library property on Conti Street. The Ben May Main Library building is a contributing building to the Church Street East Historic District, which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on 16 December 1971. The system opened a new branch, the West Regional Branch, in 2002, with First Lady Laura Bush making an address. Beginning in 2006, the Ben May Main Library building was restored and expanded by . It was reopened on 31 May 2007.

Plot James Murphy (Brian Krause) is a rugged cryptozoologist, who thirty years earlier, during a trip to Loch Ness, Scotland, was attacked by the fabled \\"Nessie\\" creature that killed his father, research assistants, and left James with a deep facial scar. Thirty years later, James is hunting for Nessie, when his search leads him to the sleepy town of Pike Island, Ashburn, on Lake Superior. He encounters Josh Riley (Niall Matter), owner of a bait shop. Josh's ex-girlfriend, Zoe, is going camping along with Brody and two others on a small deserted island on the lake. Josh's uncle, Sean, attempts to prove Nessie's existence but is eaten instead. James hires Josh as a guide while his mother, Sheriff Karen Riley, eventually finds Sean's remains. She begins to suspect that an underwater predator is on the loose. The creature attacks and kills her deputy's sister when she was out grocery shopping. When one of the campers disappears (after being eaten by the creature), the others are unable to escape and one is killed while Brody is injured. Hearing about James, Karen warns him to stay away from Josh, but the pair still work together. They find a corpse and James takes the head before Karen's deputy, Neil Chapman, arrives. James reveals that Sean has contacted him prior about Nessie and, seeing the corpse, believes there might be a nest somewhere. Before the two set off, James is arrested, leaving Josh to go alone. James manages to convince Karen that a 40-foot Plesiosaurus is behind the killings, after they send a skin sample to the Zoological Institute on the mainland that matches no known species of reptile. Josh arrives on the island and encounters packs of baby Plesiosaurus. He is rescued by Zoe and Brody and he leaves them at a magnetite mine for safety, not knowing it is the nest. Brody is killed by a pack of baby Plesiosaurus. Sheriff Riley, Murphy and Deputy Neil Chapman spot Josh's flare and track the creature and her offspring to the magnetite mine on the island. Sheriff Riley and Josh manage to kill some of the offspring, Neil dies after running out of ammunition and being attacked by the babies. Josh lures Nessie away from Zoe and traps her in a container filled with magnetite. James stabs the creature with a cyanide-filled syringe, then helps Josh by getting him out of harm's way and throws his cigarette lighter into the container, igniting the explosive magnetite and destroying the creature and her remaining offspring. Josh and Zoe are reunited and Sheriff Riley asks if James will now start \\"hunt for Bigfoot\\", to which he replies that he will instead probably find a nice small town to call home. Josh asks if he means Ashburn, to which he laughingly replies \\"yeah.\\" Cast * Brian Krause as James Murphy: A rugged cryptozoologist, during a trip to Loch Ness, Scotland, had a fatal encounter with the fabled \\"Nessie\\" creature that killed his father, and left James with a deep facial scar.

It consists of an upland forest on steeply rolling topography, various wooded swamps, and minor wetland areas (wet meadows, thickets and cattail swamps). A few small kettle ponds are also present. Located on Ordovician bedrock over the Oak Ridges Moraine, the forest attains elevations between 122 and 152 m, increasing westward. The majority of the area is composed of overburden of ice-contract stratified drift of sand, gravel and silt of varying origin (kame, outwash or collapse). Soil types in the forests are predominantly pontytool sandy loam; Brighton sandy loam, King clay loam (southern and western steep areas), and bottomland (along stream banks) are present in small areas. The upland forest is dominated by sugar maple in most areas, and sugar maple and American beech in others, though species such as paper birch, white ash, eastern hemlock, black cherry and red oak are found throughout. The eastern portion is instead dominated by red maple and red oak, interspersed by American beech, paper birch, eastern hemlock and largetooth aspen. In the valleys of this forest can be found largetooth aspen with white birch, red maple and occasional beech, red oak and trembling aspen. Moreover, several kettle depressions and small kettle ponds are present in the area. Supporting over 100 bird species, and numerous other wildlife species, the Happy Valley Forest is recognized for its size and the presence of various rare species. Native and rare species include: * Acadian flycatcher (endangered) * Hooded warbler (threatened) * Jefferson salamander * Cerulean warbler The red-shouldered hawk was a vulnerable species, but as a result of conservation efforts, was reclassified in 2006 and is no longer at risk. Note that the status of the species listed above is for Canada only. None of these species is currently facing global extinction. The forest is also home to the northern flying squirrel and the southern flying squirrel, which depend on trees with holes for nesting and food storage. The southern flying squirrel is at the northern extent of its range in Happy Valley Forest. Happy Valley Infiltration Area The Happy Valley Infiltration Area is the source for the Happy Valley Tributary, which merges with the Schomberg River. It has an area of 9.45 km². Politics In addition to the politics of the Oak Ridges Moraine, Happy Valley Forest faces a number of political and social issues. Since the late 1990s, ATV use throughout the forest became a concern, both because the vehicles create noise, and because they cause damage to various plants; some indigenous plants are in danger of extirpation, while similar, hardier invasive species take over their habitat. To address the issue, in 2007 the township passed a bylaw mandating that all concession roads in the forest be closed, and erected fences around the property to eliminate access to ATVs.

Antoine was born at Lunéville. At the age of fifteen he applied for admission into the Society of Jesus, and was received 9 October 1693. On the completion of his studies, he taught humanities for several years, first in Pont-à-Mousson, and then in Colmar. Returning to the former town, he occupied the chair of philosophy, and later that of theology, the first edition of his Dogmatic Theology appearing in 1723, and three years later his Moral Theology in three volumes. Afterwards he was rector of the College of Pont-à-Mousson, where he died in his sixty-fifth year. His Theologia universa, speculativa et dogmatica, embracing the whole field of scholastic inquiry, met with an enthusiastic reception, and at once stamped the author as one of the leading Catholic theologians of the age. It went through nine editions during his lifetime, and ten after his death. Still more flattering was the reception accorded his Theologia moralis universa, first published in Nancy in 1726, in duodecimo. It has since gone through sixty editions in different countries. The Roman edition of 1747, published by Philip Carbognano, O.M., contained several additions to the original, among them chapters on Condemned Propositions, Reserved Cases, decrees of Benedict XIV, etc. Antoine's Moral Theology was so highly esteemed by Benedict XIV that he prescribed its use by the students of the College of Propaganda, and it was likewise received by many of the bishops throughout France and Italy. In the opinion of Jean-Pierre Gury and St. Alphonsus Liguori, Antoine inclines too much toward the side of severity. Besides his theological works, Antoine published also several ascetical and devotional treatises. References ;Attribution * cites Sommervogel, Bibliotheque de la c. de J., s. v.

Plot Protagonist Optimus Yarnspinner (Hildegunst von Mythenmetz in the German text) is a Lindworm (dinosaur) who inherits his authorial godfather's possessions, including a perfect story written by an unknown author, in search of whom he travels to Bookholm, a city devoted to literature above labyrinthine catacombs containing many valuable books, among various monsters and perils. There, a publisher directs him to antagonist Pfistomel Smyke, who possesses the most valuable books on the market and controls the book trade by musical hypnosis. At his house, Smyke reveals his plan to eradicate all forms of art in Zamonia; drugs Yarnspinner; and transfers him to the catacombs. Waking, Yarnspinner attempts to reach the surface, but falls victim to a trap and re-appears in Unholm, the monster- infested rubbish dump of the catacombs. Wandering out, he falls victim to a Spinxxx, a spider-like monster, but is rescued by a Bookhunter (one of the murderous mercenaries who explore the catacombs in search of ancient books), who thereafter tries to eat Yarnspinner, but is killed by an unknown force. Yarnspinner then finds the Booklings, friendly gnomes devoted to memorizing books, tending to the dying Colophonius Regenschein, the only good Bookhunter. They are attacked by evil Bookhunters led by Regenschein's mortal enemy, Rongkong Koma; and Yarnspinner escapes to Shadowhall Castle, home of the 'Shadow King', the mysterious author sought by Yarnspinner: a human surgically altered by Smyke, to be taller, stronger, and possessed of impenetrable paper skin, that bursts into flame in contact with sunlight or moonlight, who tutors Yarnspinner in the art of writing. After the Shadow King frees the Booklings' library and gains entrance to Smyke's personal library, they are ambushed by the Bookhunters, who are hypnotized into killing each other by the Booklings.

Having previously set up a diamond transaction, he hired a diamond merchant to pick up in diamonds from the Soviet Trading company, which he had purchased for USD 8.1 million. Rifkin then hired a diamond merchant to buy the diamonds from the Soviet trading company in Switzerland. Rifkin then played the role of diamond courier, picked up the diamonds at the airport, put them in his checked luggage, and returned to Los Angeles. He then asked his former lawyer to negotiate giving the diamonds (then worth more than in Switzerland) to the Bank in exchange for a consulting contract to help solve the security problem he identified by his fraud. It was his former lawyer (not under client/lawyer privilege) who reported him to the FBI.

Design and characteristics The No. 2 was a modified Golden Flyer (also known as the Curtiss No. 1), and was an open-framework biplane with two-bay unstaggered wings of equal span. It had an all-moving cruciform tail unit comprising a small elevator surface plus a rudder for directional control, but larger elevators were carried forward of the pilot as a biplane canard unit. The landing gear was in a tricycle configuration, with three individual wheels. Large ailerons were carried in the interplane gap. Curtiss had modified the Golden Flyer into the Reims Racer by adding a covered stabilizer unit at the canard position, increasing the wing size, modifying the interplane ailerons and replacing the 25 hp four cylinder inline Curtiss OX engine with a 63 hp Curtiss OX V8 that had been stripped down and specially lightened for the race. A new, lighter fuel tank was exchanged for the older, heavier one. A transverse-rocking, metal framework \\"shoulder cradle\\", hinged longitudinally on either side of the pilot's seat, achieved the connection between the pilot and aileron control cabling. This apparatus required the pilot to \\"lean-into\\" the turn to operate the ailerons and thus turn the aircraft in the same direction. This system was later used again in the Curtiss Model D. Operational history Curtiss' participation in the race was sponsored by the Aero Club of America, which had offered to back him after a similar offer was turned down by the Wright brothers. While not as fast as its European competitors, the Reims Racer was more maneuverable, and Curtiss, who piloted the machine himself, was able to take advantage of this by paying special attention to his turns. The first competitor to fly, Curtiss recorded a time of 15 minutes 50.4 seconds for the two 10 km circuits required. When Louis Bleriot made the final flight of the competition, he recorded a time 5.8 seconds longer, leaving Curtiss to claim the FF 25,000 prize. Curtiss's flight, at an average speed of 47.06 mph (75.48 km/h) was also a new airspeed record for the distance.\\"Tabulated Performances &c; of Rheims Meeting\\", Flight 4 September 1909. After Reims, Curtiss took the aircraft to Italy, where he won events at a competition at the Air Show in Brescia in September 1909. There, he won the overall grand prize by flying the required five 10 km circuits in 49 minutes 24 seconds. He also won the quick starting prize, starting his engine in 8.2 seconds, and took second place to Henri Rougier in the altitude prize, climbing to 165 ft (51 m). While at Brescia, Curtiss gave Italian poet Gabriele d'Annunzio a short joyride, but declined a similar request by Princess Laetitia on the grounds that the seat would be unsuitable. Returning to the United States, Curtiss flew the Reims Racer in the country's first air meet at Dominguez Hills in October 1909, setting a new airspeed record of 55 mph (88 km/h). Curtiss sold the Reims Racer to Charles Hamilton, who crashed it in Seattle on 12 March 1910. The book \\"How to Fly\\" – or The Conquest of the Air – published in 1910 by Thomas Nelson & Sons has a description of how to fly this aircraft (pp 157 to 162) as follows: \\"There is a diversity of design in the arrangement of the means of control. We shall describe that of the Curtiss biplane, as largely typical of them all. In general, the biplane consists of two large sustaining planes, one above the other. Between the planes is the motor which operates a propeller located in the rear of the planes. Projecting behind the planes, and held by a framework of bamboo rods, is a small horizontal plane, called the tail. The rudder which guides the aeroplane to the right or the left is partially bisected by the tail. This rudder is worked by wires which run to a steering wheel located in front of the pilot's seat. This wheel is similar in size and appearance to the steering wheel of an automobile, and is used in the same way for guiding the aeroplane to the right or left. In front of the planes, supported on a shorter projecting framework, is the altitude rudder, a pair of planes hinged horizontally, so that their front edges may tip up or down. When they tilt up, the air through which the machine is passing catches on the under sides and lifts them up, thus elevating the front of the whole aeroplane and causing it to glide upward. The opposite action takes place when these altitude planes are tilted downward. This altitude rudder is controlled by a long rod which runs to the steering wheel. By pushing on the wheel the rod is shoved forward and turns the altitude planes downward. Pulling the wheel turns the rudder planes upward. This rod has a backward and forward thrust of over two feet, but the usual movement in ordinary wind currents is rarely more than an inch. In climbing to high levels or swooping down rapidly the extreme play of the rod is about four or five inches. Thus the steering wheel controls both the horizontal and vertical movements of the aeroplane. More than this, it is a feeler to the aviator, warning him of the condition of the air currents, and for this reason must not be grasped too firmly. It is to be held steady, yet loosely enough to transmit any wavering force in the air to the sensitive touch of the pilot, enabling him instinctively to rise or dip as the current compels. Reims Air Show August 1909 The preserving of an even keel is accomplished in the Curtiss machine by small planes hinged between the main planes at the outer ends. They serve to prevent the machine from tipping over sideways. They are operated by arms, projecting from the back of the aviator's seat, which embrace his shoulders on each side, and are moved by the swaying of his body. In a measure, they are automatic in action, for when the aeroplane sags downward on one side, the pilot naturally leans the other way to preserve his balance, and that motion swings the ailerons (as these small stabilizing planes are called) in such a way that the pressure of the wind restores the aeroplane to an even keel. The wires which connect them with the back of the seat are so arranged that when one aileron is being pulled down at its rear edge the rear of the other one is being raised, thus doubling the effect. As the machine is righted the aviator comes back to an upright position, and the ailerons become level once more. There are other controls which the pilot must operate consciously. In the Curtiss machine these are levers moved by the feet. With a pressure of the right foot he short-circuits the magneto, thus cutting off the spark in the engine cylinders and stopping the motor. This lever also puts a brake on the forward landing wheels, and checks the speed of the machine as it touches the ground. The right foot also controls the pump which forces the lubricating oil faster or slower to the points where it is needed. The left foot operates the lever which controls the throttle by which the aviator can regulate the flow of gas to the engine cylinders. The average speed of the 7-foot propeller is 1,100 revolutions per minute. With the throttle it may be cut down to 100 revolutions per minute, which is not fast enough to keep afloat, but will help along when gliding.\\" Specifications References ; Citations ; Bibliography * Casey, Louis S.

Most of the species have inconspicuous lichenized thalli that consist of scattered, small, loose, nearly microscopic green balls or foliose small flakes containing single-celled green algae in the genus Coccomyxa, all interconnected by a loose network of hyphae. The agaric fruit bodies themselves are nonlichenized and resemble other types of omphalinoid mushrooms. These agarics lack clamp connections and do not form hymenial cystidia. The basidiospores are hyaline, smooth, thin-walled, and nonamyloid. Most of the species were originally classified in the genera Omphalina or Gerronema. Historically the species were classified with those other genera in the family, the Tricholomataceae together with the nonlichenized species. Lichenomphalia species can be grouped into brightly colored taxa, with vivid yellow and orange colors, versus the grey brown group, depending upon the microscopic pigmentation deposits. Molecular research comparing DNA sequences now place Lichenomphalia close to the redefined genus Arrhenia, which together with several other genera not traditionally considered to be related, fall within the newly redefined Hygrophoraceae. Etymology Lichenomphalia is derived from the word lichen combined with the old, shorter, generic name Omphalia from whence the more familiar, longer, diminutive generic name Omphalina was derived. Basically it means the lichen omphalias. Thallus names and nomenclature Long before the connection was made between the nonlichenized agaric fruitbodies and the lichenized thalli, botanists and lichenologists named the asexual lichen thalli of Lichenomphalia species several times in a number of genera. Linnaeus in 1753 described the lichen thallus of L. umbellifera as an 'alga' named Byssus botryoides while simultaneously including the fruitbodies of L. umbellifera within his concept of Agaricus umbelliferus, the basionym for the name L. umbellifera. Byssus botryoides is the type species of the now officially rejected generic names Phytoconis and Botrydina. Acharius in 1810 described the thalli of L. hudsoniana as a lichen, Endocarpon viride, which is the type of another officially rejected name, Coriscium. The names 'Botrydina' and 'Coriscium' are often used to describe the thalli of different Lichenomphalia even though they are rejected names listed in the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (Appendix V). Prior to officially rejecting these names, the names Botrydina and Phytoconis were both applied to describe Lichenomphalia species. Hence literature on these lichenized agarics appears under a myriad of names, such as Omphalina, Gerronema, Phytoconis, Botrydina and Coriscium.

History V/Line P12 at North Melbourne in August 2007 Freight Australia P22 at North Melbourne in April 2010 The P class were rebuilt from 1950s T class locomotives by Clyde Engineering. The rebuild involved a new cab and carbody, replacing the EMD 8-567C engine with an EMD 8-645E, replacement of the main generator and traction motors, and provision of a separate head end power generator. Only first-series T Class locomotives were suitable for upgrading because their frames were designed for EMD 12-567 engines, with only 2/3rds of the length used to cut down on weight (and allow a Bo-Bo, instead of A1A-A1A or Co-Co wheel arrangement). When rebuilt, the 8-645 engine took the place formerly occupied by the 8-567, and the remaining space was utilised for the head-end power unit. The first eight of the class were in service with V/Line; Pacific National has one engine stored, and Ettamogah Rail Hub has four. In passenger usage they were most commonly used in push-pull mode with H type carriages, but also operated as single locomotives if required. In freight service the head end power was occasionally used for the powering of refrigerated containers.P Class diesel electric locomotives Mark Bau's VR websiteP Class RailpageP Class Vicsig When first introduced, it was hoped to allow push-pull operations with one locomotive permanently allocated to a single three- or four-car H set, with a driving cab installed in the non-locomotive end of that set. This failed because while the Harris motor cabs were sufficient for 1950s standards of comfort and visibility, the conversion cost any application of the grandfather clause and so visibility of signals etc. was deemed insufficient. By September 2017, all of V/Line's P class locomotives had been withdrawn from regular passenger service, having been replaced by the VLocity diesel multiple units. A single unit, P13, which had been converted to standard gauge was retained.

It is common in wetlands and grassland in Africa south of the Equator. North of the Equator, it is replaced by the northern red bishop or orange bishop (E. franciscanus) which was formerly regarded as a subspecies of this species. Description It is 10–11 centimetres long and has a thick conical bill. Breeding males are brightly coloured with red (occasionally orange) and black plumage. The forehead, face and throat are black and the rest of the head is red. The upperparts are red apart from the brown wings and tail. The upper breast and under tail-coverts are red while the lower breast and belly are black. The non-breeding male and female have streaky brown plumage, paler below. Females are smaller than the males. It has various twittering calls and a nasal contact call. The male has a buzzing song. Breeding males of the northern red bishop have a red throat, black extending further back on the crown and long tail-coverts which almost cover the tail. The females and non-breeding males are almost identical to those of the southern red bishop. Distribution and habitat It occurs from South Africa north to Angola, southern and eastern parts of the Democratic Republic of Congo,northern Zambia southern Uganda north-east Nigeria and south-west Kenya. It is largely absent from the Namib Desert and Kalahari. In the breeding season it is found near water among grass, reeds, sedges or crops such as sugar cane. Outside the breeding season it will venture into drier grassland and savanna habitats. Behaviour Male weaving a nest in Pretoria, South Africa It is a fairly gregarious bird, nesting in colonies and foraging in flocks. It feeds on seeds and some insects. It often roosts in mixed flocks with other members of the weaver family. At the start of the breeding season, the males build several nests to attract females. They perform a display flight with their feathers fluffed up. They are polygynous and mate with several females. The nest is most commonly built among reeds and is made of grasses and other plant materials woven together. Two to four eggs are laid. References * Craig, A.J.F.K. Red Bishop. Avian Demography Unit.

It is located in the municipality of La Unión de Isidoro Montes de Oca and has a population of about 593 people (2005 census). Hammocks and palm trees are in most yards, chickens roam the streets and loud nightlife is limited to very few weekly events, making for quiet nights. Some local hotels and restaurants offer special events such as Movie Nights and Dance Parties, mostly during the Oct- May high season. On Sundays, El Burro Boracho has shows of Mexican folkdance. Troncones has not been well-known until only recently. It was “discovered” by a North American sports fisherman who bought land here and convinced some of his compatriots to do the same. These property owners set up private homes or small hotels and guesthouses. Over the last 20 years, the population has grown as the local ejido benefits from increased tourism income, while maintaining a small-town aesthetic, in stark contrast to the high-rise hotels of nearby Ixtapa. On the of beach, exist these houses, a few restaurants, a couple of grocery stores, and a growing number of eco-hostels, campgrounds, and surf schools. Even in the high season in the winter and spring it is possible to walk along the beach and not run into anyone. Release of baby sea turtles atTroncones Beach on 25 December 2007 The major surfing area is called Troncones Point, a steady left break, where Troncones Beach meets Manzanillo Bay just to the north. Waves tend to be smaller in the winter, as the Point needs a southern swell to break well, and it is recommended for confident surfers because it is a rock bottom with some coral. Many hotels offer surfing classes. There is only one surf shop, but several of the hotels have basic equipment for ding repair, waxing, fin replacement, and other emergencies. There is also a professional surfboard shaper in town who offers repair services. There are many breaks and few surfers, especially in the low season of June - October when the swell is from the south and the breaks at Troncones Point and El Rancho can hit . Breaks in Troncones tend to be gentler in the \\"shoulder seasons\\" of spring and fall, and some spots are better suited to long boarders. Near the beach are two sea caves called Troncones and Majahua as well as a waterfall called Cascadas Artesianas. Sportsfishing trips to the open ocean are available as well. In 2008, two surfers were attacked and killed by sharks in the waters off Troncones and nearby Zihuatanejo. They were the first fatal shark attacks in these waters in thirty years. Bull sharks gathered in large numbers for unknown reasons. Many have contended the reason were historically cold currents, drawing the sharks much nearer to the shore than usual. Two surfers were killed and a third was injured. The attacks occurred during a three-week period causing a “Jaws-like mania” and the construction of lifeguard towers and the establishment of a shark patrol for the beaches of Zihuatanejo and north. It was a rare phenomenon that subsided after the sharks dispersed.

In 1923, when his teachers there became aware of his striking musical gifts, they registered him at the Milan Conservatory to study music. Following his graduation, Alemshah joined the faculty of the Paris branch of the Murat-Raphaelian school, where he organized the Giligia choir, performing not only in Paris, but also traveling to Venice, directing the choir in an all-Komitas program at St. Mark's Square. Alemshah continued to introduce the Armenian song to all music lovers: he presented Tchouhadjian's popular comic opera Leblebidji Hor-Hor Agha (The Chickpea Vendor), and Haygagan harsanik (The Armenian Wedding), a composition put together by combining Alemshah's own melodies with popular songs. In 1937, Haygagan harsanik received second prize in an international competition to which twenty nations participated. Concurrently, Alemshah conducted the Alakyaz Choir on a number of occasions, initially to mark the establishment of the Soviet regime in Armenia, and later to benefit the Armenian War Relief efforts. In 1939, he was appointed conductor of the Sipan-Komitas Chorus. He conducted Tigranian's opera Anush and performed the Armenian Divine Liturgy in a number of French cathedrals.

Life on Mars  The character of Chris Skelton has been described as a \\"dogsbody\\" who is a \\"cheeky but likeable character\\" by the BBC's Life on Mars website.https://www.bbc.co.uk/lifeonmars/characters/chris.shtml Throughout both series of Life on Mars, Skelton finds himself torn between the \\"old and the new ways of policing\\", represented by Gene Hunt (Philip Glenister) and Sam Tyler (John Simm) respectively. He is generally regarded as a waste of space by Hunt throughout both series and plays only minor roles in the storylines that unfold. Skelton finally proves himself in series 2 episode 6, saving Hunt, Tyler and Annie Cartwright (Liz White) from death when he shoots Big Bird. Unlike Ray Carling (Dean Andrews), Skelton eventually comes to respect Tyler and begins to emulate his modern policing methods, such as tape-recording interviews years before it became standard procedure. Tyler also helps Skelton overcome his clumsiness, nervousness and naivety. During the finale of Life on Mars, Skelton informs Tyler: \\"I don't underestimate you Boss, I just don't understand you\\". Ashes to Ashes Alongside Gene Hunt and Ray Carling, Chris moved from Manchester to London and joined the Metropolitan Police shortly after the death of Sam Tyler in 1980. By the time in which Ashes to Ashes is set in 1981, eight years since that of Life on Mars set in 1973, Chris' confidence, maturity and policing skills are displayed to have improved. During one episode, he described himself as \\"cautious rather than nervous\\" (as opposed to his demeanour in Life on Mars). During the programme, Chris enters into a relationship with fellow officer, Sharon Granger (Montserrat Lombard). Chris proposes to her in the second episode of season two and they become engaged. Series two of Ashes to Ashes follows Gene Hunt and Alex Drake battling to put an end to police corruption and searching for an officer who is fabricating and disposing of evidence within Fenchurch East CID. During the penultimate episode of the second series, Chris is revealed to be the mole in CID, explaining that to pay for an engagement ring for Shaz he accepted money from corrupt officers. Chris initially thought that he could infiltrate the group and learn who was involved, but the more tasks he performed, the more involved he became, and he found it impossible to tell either Hunt or Drake about what was happening to him. Ashamed, Chris quietly attempts to resign from CID. A disgusted Hunt views the resignation as cowardice and refuses, telling him that although he won't go to prison, he has no choice but to stay on and bear the consequences of his betrayal. The revelation of his betrayal ostracizes him within CID and casts serious doubts on his relationship with Shaz. However, in the final episode of the second series, Chris puts himself in danger by agreeing to go along with the corrupt officers' robbery plan; this eases tensions between Chris and the other characters and his relationship with Shaz recovers, as she admits that she still loves him because \\"he cares when he gets it wrong\\". During episode one of the third series, it is revealed that Chris and Shaz have split-up, though the details are undisclosed; however, in episode 6 series 3, when he and Ray believe they are about to die, he says that if he doesn't make it, Ray should tell Shaz that Chris still loves her. In episode 7 series 3, Chris's working relationship with Hunt is strained due to him laughing at a mishap at Viv James's funeral and spilling his drink at the wake. Chris then disobeys an order from Hunt and the two fight in the office. Later on, Chris refers to Hunt as \\"the best DCI I've ever had\\" and says he is \\"proud to have worked under [him]\\"; however, he also tells Hunt, \\"I'm not going to be your doormat any longer. Those days are over.\\" After this, the two of them make up. Throughout the third season, Chris, Shaz, and Ray all have disturbing and intrusive visions of a sky of stars, and at times hear strange voices, like those heard in a pub. In episode seven, following the resolution of his argument with Hunt, Chris says he recognises the voice as that of Nelson (Tony Marshall), the landlord of The Railway Arms from Life on Mars, asking him what is he having to drink. Finale During the finale it is revealed that, in reality, Skelton was dead. On 14 February 1975, whilst serving as a uniformed constable, his Sergeant told him to \\"do as he is told\\", which was for Chris to move out into the open at the blow of his Sergeant's whistle, resulting in him being gunned down and killed. Chris ponders on how he acted as a dogsbody for the Sergeant and did absolutely whatever he asked, just like his relationship with DCI Hunt, which he changes after standing up to Hunt in series three, episode seven. He reunites with Shaz when she kisses him before entering The Railway Arms and crossing over to the other side. She tells him that she loves him \\"forever and a day\\", to which he responds: \\"Fab.\\" References External links * BBC Site character profile * Bravo site character profile Category:Life on Mars (TV series) characters Category:Fictional British police detectives Category:Television characters introduced in 2006 ","title":"Chris Skelton"},{"id":"14977799","text":"The Palestinian people (, ash-sha'ab il-filastini) are an Arabic-speaking people with family origins in the region of Palestine. Since 1964, they have been referred to as Palestinians (, al-filastiniyyin), but before that they were usually referred to as Palestinian Arabs (, al-'arabi il-filastini). During the period of the British Mandate, the term Palestinian was also used to describe the Jewish community living in Palestine. The Arabic-language newspaper Falastin (Palestine) was founded in 1911 by Palestinian Christians.  During Ottoman times (1834–1917)  = Birth of the nationalist feeling = Under the Ottomans, Palestine's Arab population mostly saw themselves as Ottoman subjects. Kimmerling and Migdal consider the revolt in 1834 of the Arabs in Palestine as the first formative event of the Palestinian people. In the 1830s, Palestine was occupied by the Egyptian vassal of the Ottomans, Muhammad Ali and his son Ibrahim Pasha. The revolt was precipitated by popular resistance against heavy demands for conscripts. Peasants were well aware that conscription was nothing less than a death sentence. Starting in May 1834, the rebels took many cities, among them Jerusalem, Hebron and Nablus. In response, Ibrahim Pasha sent in his army, finally defeating the last rebels on 4 August in Hebron.Kimmerling & Migdal, 2003, 'The Palestinian people', p. 6-11 Nevertheless, the Arabs in Palestine remained part of a Pan-Islamist or Pan- Arab national movement.Benny Morris, Righteous Victims, pp.40–42 in the French edition. In 1882 the population numbered approximately 320,000 people, 25,000 of whom were Jewish.Kimmerling, 2003, p. 214. Many of these were Arab Jews and in the narrative works of Arabs in Palestine in the late Ottoman period – as evidenced in the autobiographies and diaries of Khalil Sakakini and Wasif Jawhariyyeh – \\"native\\" Jews were often referred to as abnaa al-balad (sons of the country), 'compatriots', or Yahud awlad Arab (\\"Jews, sons of Arabs\\"). At the beginning of the 20th century, a \\"local and specific Palestinian patriotism\\" emerged. The Palestinian identity grew progressively. In 1911, a newspaper named Falastin was established in Jaffa by Palestinian Christians and the first Palestinian nationalist organisations appeared at the end of the World War IBenny Morris, Righteous Victims, p.48 in the French edition. Two political factions emerged. al-Muntada al-Adabi, dominated by the Nashashibi family, militated for the promotion of the Arab language and culture, for the defense of Islamic values and for an independent Syria and Palestine.

When the First Palestinian Congress of February 1919 issued its anti-Zionist manifesto rejecting Zionist immigration, it extended a welcome to those Jews \\"among us who have been Arabicized, who have been living in our province since before the war; they are as we are, and their loyalties are our own.\\" According to Benny Morris, Palestinian Arab nationalism as a distinct movement appeared between April and July 1920, after the Nebi Musa riots, the San Remo conference and the failure of Faisal to establish the Kingdom of Greater Syria.Benny Morris, Righteous Victims, pp.49–50 in the French edition.Tom Segev, One Palestine, Complete, p.139n. = Zionism = When Zionism began taking root among Jewish communities in Europe, many Jews emigrated to Palestine and established settlements there. When Palestinian Arabs concerned themselves with Zionists, they generally assumed the movement would fail. After the Young Turk revolution in 1908, Arab Nationalism grew rapidly in the area and most Arab Nationalists regarded Zionism as a threat, although a minority perceived Zionism as providing a path to modernity.Mohammed Muslih, The Origins of Palestinian Nationalism, New York 1988, chapter 3, See also Yehoshua Porath, The Emergence of the Palestinian-Arab National Movement 1918–1929, introduction. Though there had already been Arab protests to the Ottoman authorities in the 1880s against land sales to foreign Jews, the most serious opposition began in the 1890s after the full scope of the Zionist enterprise became known. There was a general sense of threat. This sense was heightened in the early years of the 20th century by Zionist attempts to develop an economy from which Arab people were largely excluded, such as the \\"Hebrew labor\\" movement which campaigned against the employment of cheap Arab labour. The creation of the British Mandate of Palestine in 1918 and the Balfour Declaration greatly increased Arab fears. = Contemporary writing = The Outline of History, by H.G.Wells (1920), notes the following about this geographic region and the turmoil of the times: > It was clearly a source of strength to them [Turks], rather than weakness, > that they were cut off altogether from their age-long ineffective conflict > with the Arab. Syria, Mesopotamia, were entirely detached from Turkish rule. > Palestine was made a separate state within the British sphere, earmarked as > a national home for the Jews. A flood of poor Jewish immigrants poured into > the promised land and was speedily involved in serious conflicts with the > Arab population. The Arabs had been consolidated against the Turks and > inspired with a conception of national unity through the exertions of a > young Oxford scholar, Colonel Lawrence. His dream of an Arab kingdom with > its capital at Damascus was speedily shattered by the hunger of the French > and British for mandatory territory, and in the end his Arab kingdom shrank > to the desert kingdom of the Hedjaz and various other small and insecure > imamates, emirates and sultanates. If ever they are united, and struggle > into civilization, it will not be under Western auspices.H.G.Wells, 1920, > Outline of History, pp. 1122–24  Arab Revolt and conquest of Palestine by the British army   During the British Mandate (1920–1947)  = Palestinian Arabs' political rights = The Palestinian Arabs felt ignored by the terms of the Mandate. Though at the beginning of the Mandate they constituted a 90 percent majority of the population, the text only referred to them as \\"non-Jewish communities\\" that, though having civil and religious rights, were not given any national or political rights. As far as the League of Nations and the British were concerned the Palestinian Arabs were not a distinct people. In contrast the text included six articles (2, 4, 6, 7, 11 and 22) with obligations for the mandatory power to foster and support a \\"national home\\" for the Jewish people. Moreover, a representative body of the Jewish people, the Jewish Agency, was recognised.Khalidi (2006), pp. 32-33. The Palestinian Arab leadership repeatedly pressed the British to grant them national and political rights like representative government, reminding the British of president Wilson's Fourteen Points, the Covenant of the League of Nations and British promises during World War I. The British however made acceptance of the terms of the Mandate a precondition for any change in the constitutional position of the Palestinian Arabs. For the Palestinian Arabs this was unacceptable, as they felt that this would be \\"self murder\\".Khalidi (2006), pp. 33, 34. During the whole interwar period the British, appealing to the terms of the Mandate, which they had designed themselves, rejected the principle of majority rule or any other measure that would give a Palestinian Arab majority control over the government of Palestine.Khalidi (2006), pp. 32,36. There was also a contrast with other Class A Mandates. By 1932 Iraq was independent, and Syria, Lebanon and Transjordan had national parliaments, Arab government officials up to the rank of minister, and substantial power in Arabs hands. In other Arab countries there were also indigenous state structures, except in some countries like Libya and Algeria, which, like Palestine, were subject to large-scale settlement programmes.Khalidi (2006), pp. 38-40. Not having a recognized body of representatives was a severe handicap for the Palestinian Arabs compared to the Zionists. The Jewish Agency was entitled to diplomatic representation e.g. in Geneva before the League of Nations Permanent Mandates Commission, while the Palestinian Arabs had to be represented by the British.Khalidi (2006), pp. 43,44. = Development = Rashid Khalidi made a comparison between the Yishuv, the Jewish community in Palestine, and the Palestinian Arabs on the one hand, and between the Palestinian Arabs and other Arabs on the other hand. From 1922 to 1947 the annual growth rate of the Jewish sector of the economy was 13.2%, mainly due to immigration and foreign capital, while that of the Arab was 6.5%. Per capita these figures were 4.8% and 3.6% respectively. By 1936 the Jewish sector had eclipsed the Arab one, and Jewish individuals earned 2.6 times as much as Arabs.Khalidi (2006), pp. 13–14. Compared to other Arab countries the Palestinian Arab individuals earned slightly better.Khalidi (2006), p. 27. In terms of human capital there was a huge difference. For instance the literacy rates in 1932 were 86% for the Jews against 22% for the Palestinian Arabs, but Arab literacy was steadily increasing. In this respect the Palestinian Arabs compared favorably to Egypt and Turkey, but unfavorably to Lebanon.Khalidi (2006), pp. 14, 24. On the scale of the UN Human Development Index determined for around 1939, of 36 countries, Palestinian Jews were placed 15th, Palestinian Arabs 30th, Egypt 33rd and Turkey 35th.Khalidi (2006), p. 16. The Jews in Palestine were mainly urban, 76.2% in 1942, while the Arabs were mainly rural, 68,3% in 1942.Khalidi (2006), p. 17. Overall Khalidi concludes that the Palestinian Arab society, while being overmatched by the Yishuv, was as advanced as any other Arab society in the region and considerably more as several.Khalidi (2006), pp. 29-30. = Palestinian leadership = The Palestinian Arabs were led by two main camps. The Nashashibis, led by Raghib al-Nashashibi, who was Mayor of Jerusalem from 1920 to 1934, were moderates who sought dialogue with the British and the Jews. The Nashashibis were overshadowed by the al-Husaynis who came to dominate Palestinian-Arab politics in the years before 1948. The al- Husaynis, like most Arab Nationalists, denied that Jews had any national rights in Palestine. The British granted the Palestinian Arabs a religious leadership, but they always kept it dependent.Khalidi (2006), p. 63. The office of Mufti of Jerusalem, traditionally limited in authority and geographical scope, was refashioned into that of Grand Mufti of Palestine. Furthermore, a Supreme Muslim Council (SMC) was established and given various duties like the administration of religious endowments and the appointment of religious judges and local muftis. In Ottoman times these duties had been fulfilled by the bureaucracy in Istanbul. In ruling the Palestinian Arabs the British preferred to deal with elites, rather than with political formations rooted in the middle or lower classes.Khalidi (2006), pp. 52. For instance they ignored the Palestine Arab Congress. The British also tried to create divisions among these elites. For instance they chose Hajj Amin al-Husayni to become Grand Mufti, although he was young and had received the fewest votes from Jerusalem's Islamic leaders.Khalidi (2006), pp. 46-57. Hajj Amin was a distant cousin of Musa Kazim al-Husainy, the leader of the Palestine Arab Congress. According to Khalidi, by appointing a younger relative, the British hoped to undermine the position of Musa Kazim.Khalidi (2006), p. 59. Indeed, they stayed rivals until the death of Musa Kazim in 1934. Another of the mufti's rivals, Raghib Bey al-Nashashibi, had already been appointed mayor of Jerusalem in 1920, replacing Musa Kazim whom the British removed after the Nabi Musa riots of 1920,Khalidi (2006), pp. 63, 69.Tom Segev, One Palestine, Complete, 2000, ch. Nebi Musa. during which he exhorted the crowd to give their blood for Palestine.B. Morris, 1999, Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist–Arab Conflict 1881–2001, p. 112 During the entire Mandate period, but especially during the latter half the rivalry between the mufti and al- Nashashibi dominated Palestinian politics. Many notables were dependent on the British for their income. In return for their support of the notables the British required them to appease the population. According to Khalidi this worked admirably well until the mid-1930s, when the mufti was pushed into serious opposition by a popular explosion.Khalidi (2006), pp. 63, 64, 72–73, 85 After that the mufti became the deadly foe of the British and the Zionists. According to Khalidi before the mid-1930s the notables from both the al- Husayni and the al-Nashashibi factions acted as though by simply continuing to negotiate with the British they could convince them to grant the Palestinians their political rights.Khalidi (2006), p. 78. The Arab population considered both factions as ineffective in their national struggle, and linked to and dependent on the British administration. Khalidi ascribes the failure of the Palestinian leaders to enroll mass support to their experience during the Ottoman period, when they were part of the ruling elite and were accustomed to command. The idea of mobilising the masses was thoroughly alien to them.Khalidi (2006), p. 81. There had already been rioting and attacks on and massacres of Jews in 1921 and 1929. During the 1930s Palestinian Arab popular discontent with Jewish immigration and increasing Arab landlessness grew. In the late 1920s and early 1930s several factions of Palestinian society, especially from the younger generation, became impatient with the internecine divisions and ineffectiveness of the Palestinian elite and engaged in grass- roots anti-British and anti-Zionist activism organized by groups such as the Young Men's Muslim Association. There was also support for the growth in influence of the radical nationalist Independence Party (Hizb al-Istiqlal), which called for a boycott of the British in the manner of the Indian Congress Party. Some even took to the hills to fight the British and the Zionists. Most of these initiatives were contained and defeated by notables in the pay of the Mandatory Administration, particularly the mufti and his cousin Jamal al- Husayni. The younger generation also formed the backbone of the organisation of the six-month general strike of 1936, which marked the start of the great Palestinian Revolt.Khalidi (2006), pp. 87, 90. According to Khalidi this was a grass-roots uprising, which was eventually adopted by the old Palestinian leadership, whose 'inept leadership helped to doom these movements as well'. = The Great Arab Revolt (1936–1939) = The death of the Shaykh Izz ad-Din al-Qassam at the hands of the British police near Jenin in November 1935 generated widespread outrage and huge crowds accompanied Qassam's body to his grave in Haifa. A few months later, in April 1936, an Arab national general strike broke out. This lasted until October 1936. During the summer of that year thousands of Jewish-farmed acres and orchards were destroyed, Jews were attacked and killed and some Jewish communities, such as those in Beisan and Acre, fled to safer areas.Gilbert, 1998, p. 80. After the strike, one of the longest ever anticolonial strikes, the violence abated for about a year while the British sent the Peel Commission to investigate. In 1937, the Peel Commission proposed a partition between a small Jewish state, with a proposal to transfer its Arab population to the neighboring Arab state, and an Arab state to be attached to Jordan. The proposal was rejected by the Arabs. The 2 main Jewish leaders, Chaim Weizmann and Ben-Gurion had convinced the Zionist Congress to approve equivocally the Peel recommendations as a basis for more negotiation.William Roger Louis, Ends of British Imperialism: The Scramble for Empire, Suez, and Decolonization, 2006, p.391Benny Morris, One state, two states:resolving the Israel/Palestine conflict, 2009, p. 66Benny Morris, The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem Revisited, p. 48; p. 11 \\"while the Zionist movement, after much agonising, accepted the principle of partition and the proposals as a basis for negotiation\\"; p. 49 \\"In the end, after bitter debate, the Congress equivocally approved –by a vote of 299 to 160 – the Peel recommendations as a basis for further negotiation.\\"'Zionists Ready To Negotiate British Plan As Basis', The Times Thursday, August 12, 1937; pg. 10; Issue 47761; col B.Eran, Oded. \\"Arab-Israel Peacemaking.\\" The Continuum Political Encyclopedia of the Middle East. Ed. Avraham Sela. New York: Continuum, 2002, page 122. In the wake of the Peel Commission recommendation an armed uprising spread through the country. Over the next 18 months the British lost control of Jerusalem, Nablus, and Hebron. British forces, supported by 6,000 armed Jewish auxiliary police,Gilbert, 1998, p. 85. The Jewish Settlement Police were set up and equipped with trucks and armored cars by the British working with the Jewish Agency. suppressed the widespread riots with overwhelming force. The British officer Charles Orde Wingate (who supported a Zionist revival for religious reasonsvan Creveld, 2004, p. 45.) organized Special Night Squads composed of British soldiers and Jewish volunteers such as Yigal Alon, which \\"scored significant successes against the Arab rebels in the lower Galilee and in the Jezreel valley\\"Black, 1992, p. 14. by conducting raids on Arab villages. The British mobilised up to 20,000 Jews (policemen, field troops and night squads). The Jewish militias the Stern Gang and Irgun used violence also against civilians, attacking marketplaces and buses. The Revolt resulted in the deaths of 5,000 Palestinians and the wounding of 10,000. In total 10 percent of the adult male population was killed, wounded, imprisoned, or exiled.(see Khalidi, 2001) The Jewish population had 400 killed; the British 200. Significantly, from 1936 to 1945, whilst establishing collaborative security arrangements with the Jewish Agency, the British confiscated 13,200 firearms from Arabs and 521 weapons from Jews.Khalidi, 1987, p. 845 (cited in Khalidi, 2001). The attacks on the Jewish population by Arabs had three lasting effects: First, they led to the formation and development of Jewish underground militias, primarily the Haganah (\\"The Defense\\"), which were to prove decisive in 1948. Secondly, it became clear that the two communities could not be reconciled, and the idea of partition was born. Thirdly, the British responded to Arab opposition with the White Paper of 1939, which severely restricted Jewish land purchase and immigration. However, with the advent of World War II, even this reduced immigration quota was not reached. The White Paper policy also radicalized segments of the Jewish population, who after the war would no longer cooperate with the British. The revolt had a negative effect on Palestinian national leadership, social cohesion and military capabilities and contributed to the outcome of the 1948 War because \\"when the Palestinians faced their most fateful challenge in 1947–49, they were still suffering from the British repression of 1936–39, and were in effect without a unified leadership. Indeed, it might be argued that they were virtually without any leadership at all\\".R. Khalidi, 2001, p. 29. = Arab nationalism = Throughout the Mandatory period, some Arab residents of Palestine preferred a future as part of a broader Arab nation, usually concretized either as a nation of Greater Syria (to include what are now Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Israel, the West Bank and Gaza,) or a unified Arab state including what are now Jordan, Israel, Gaza and the West Bank.Army of Shadows, Palestinian Collaboration with Zionism, 1917–1948, Hillel Cohen, Translated by Haim Watzman, University of California Press, 2008, p. 264  1948 Palestinian Exodus (1948–1949)  thumb The 1948 Palestinian exodus refers to the refugee flight of Palestinian Arabs during and after the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. It is referred to by most Palestinians and Arabs as the Nakba (), meaning \\"disaster\\", \\"catastrophe\\", or \\"cataclysm\\". _A History of the Modern Middle East_ by William L. Cleaveland, 2004, p. 270 The term \\"Nakba\\" emerged after an influential Arab commentary on the self- examination of the social and political bases of Arab life in the wake of the 1948 War by Constantine Zureiq. The term became quite popular and widespread that it made the term \\"disaster\\" synonymous with the Arab defeat in that war. The United Nations (UN) final estimate of the number of Palestinian refugees outside Israel after the 1948 War was placed at 711,000 in 1951. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East defines a Palestine refugee as a person \\"whose normal place of residence was Palestine during the period 1 June 1946 to 15 May 1948\\". About a quarter of the estimated 160,000 Arab Palestinians remaining in Israel were internal refugees. Today, Palestinian refugees and their descendants are estimated to number over 4 million people.

In its 2007 report, the Presidential Commission for the Study of the Communist Dictatorship in Romania identified her as one of the two main agents of the Communist regime involved in policies pertaining to external affairs. Born in Iași, Vass went through seven years of elementary school, later attending the Ștefan Gheorghiu Academy. A seamstress by trade, she joined the textile workers’ union in 1930 and was part of International Red Aid Chișinău from 1931 to 1933. She joined the Romanian Communist Party, then illegal, in 1933.

Licensed to Portland, Indiana, United States. The station is currently owned by Wpgw, Inc. and features programing from CNN Radio and Westwood One. Early history 1951-1974 Glenn West, a local electronics engineer founded the AM station in 1950 with its initial sign-on that took place January 14, 1951. From that point until the summer of 1974, West (owner/operator/original licensee) and his wife ran the station with a potpourri of big band nostalgia, middle of the road, polka and adult standards. Much of its programming was geared to older adults past the age of 50...some of the 15-inch transcription LPs were still in use in addition to public service programs produced by Armed Forces recruiters on 12 inch LPs. West anchored all local news (obits, hospital report and weather) at 12 noon and before sign-off at local sunset well into his later years when his voice aged. ABC Radio news aired at the top and bottom of the hour and again at five minutes before the top of the hour. This practice continued well into the late 1960s and early 1970s when ABC diversified its radio network into its \\"demographic\\" networks (American Information, American Entertainment and American Contemporary). Only the American FM Network was not used. At the time WPGW was only a daytime station. An FM grant from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) was given to West as a construction permit in 1973 but due to West's advancing age and health concerns, the station was put up for sale. At the time the station was sold to new owners, the control room studio was still equipped with the original Gates transmitter, audio console, two 15 inch transcription turntables and a reel-to reel tape recorder/playback deck. There were no audio cartridge playback machines used as most commercials were done either live by West and his wife or played directly on reel-to-reel.The adjacent on-air studio included a piano and microphone (but no audio production facilities since nearly all local programming was done live)in addition to a home-built EBS \\"air alert\\" receiver system located near the station's office. WPGW was one of the last stations in Indiana still using the original vintage equipment since its initial 1951 sign-on. PG-14 Radio 1974-present In the summer of 1974. West and his wife retired and sold the daytime station to Bob Brandon (previously with WOWO in Fort Wayne) who replaced the musical potpourri with a mix of adult contemporary and oldies under the new corporate name and licensee WPGW Inc. incorporating a \\"new look\\" for the station using the nickname \\"PG-14\\" with ABC Contemporary news at five minutes before the hour. Top of the hour news was later provided by the now defunct Mutual Broadcasting System in the 1980s, 1990s and now by CNN Radio. Since PG-14's directional signal also covers into neighboring counties in West Central Ohio, the station in addition aired farm programming from Ohio-based Agri Broadcasting Network and its founder/director, the late Ed Johnson. WPGW-FM signed on under Brandon's ownership on May 19, 1975. At first as a simulcast and continuation of PG-14's programming in the evening hours before WPGW-FM switched to \\"Jay Country 101\\" a country music format in 1980. Both AM and FM formats remain in place. Contrary to popular belief, the MPAA \\"PG-13\\" rating (which was not incorporated until 1984) was not the inspiration for the \\"PG-14\\" branding. Instead it is an acronym for the call letters and frequency without having to use the \\"W\\" portions of the call sign at the beginning and end...exemplified by Buffalo, New York's WKBW nickname \\"KB\\"...hence it was one of the first brandings of its kind used in Indiana radio ...possibly a later inspiration for WFBQ \\"Q-95\\" in 1975 and WZWZ \\"Z-93\\" in 1978.

He rose from private soldier in World War I to air marshal in World War II. Drummond enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force in 1914 and the following year saw service as a medical orderly during the Gallipoli Campaign. He joined the Royal Flying Corps in 1916 and became a fighter ace in the Middle Eastern theatre, where he was awarded the Military Cross and the Distinguished Service Order and Bar. Transferring to the RAF on its formation in 1918, he remained in the British armed forces for the rest of his life. Between the wars, Drummond saw action in the Sudan—earning appointment as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire—and was posted to Australia on secondment to the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) as Director of Operations and Intelligence. In Britain, he commanded RAF stations Tangmere and Northolt. Ranked air commodore at the outbreak of World War II, he was Air Marshal Sir Arthur Tedder's Deputy Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief RAF Middle East from 1941 to 1943. Drummond was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1941 for his services in the Middle East, and knighted in the same order two years later. He was twice offered command of the RAAF during the war but the RAF was unwilling to release him to take up the position. Britain's Air Member for Training from 1943, Drummond was killed in a plane crash at sea in 1945. Early life Drummond was born on 2 June 1894 in Perth, Western Australia, to merchant John Maxwell Drummond and his wife Caroline (née Lockhart). Registered as Roy Maxwell Drummond, he acquired the nickname \\"Peter\\" during his schooling at Scotch College, and formally adopted it as his first name in 1943.McCarthy, Australian Dictionary of Biography, pp. 39–40 He served in the cadets and worked as a bank clerk before enlisting in the Australian Imperial Force on 10 September 1914. World War I =Soldier and pilot= Lieutenant Drummond (far right) with Captain alt=Informal portrait of six men standing in the desert, wearing military uniforms and flying gear At 5 ft 7in (171 cm) in height, Drummond was judged too slight of build for the infantry and was instead assigned to the 2nd Stationary Hospital of the Australian Army Medical Corps as an orderly. By December 1914, when his unit sailed for Egypt, Drummond was ranked corporal. He was sent to Gallipoli in April 1915 and served on a hospital ship, assisting surgeons in operations on the wounded. Drummond was evacuated to England later that year, suffering from dysentery. In December, he applied for a transfer to the British Royal Flying Corps (RFC) and was discharged from the Australian Army in April 1916. Following pilot training in the United Kingdom, Drummond received the rank of temporary second lieutenant and was posted to Egypt, where he was assigned to No. 1 Squadron, Australian Flying Corps (numbered 67 Squadron RFC by the British).Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, p. 9 During the Sinai and Palestine Campaign, he took part in the air assaults that preceded the Battle of Magdhaba on 23 December 1916. He later wrote, \\"The day before the Magdhaba battle, the whole crowd of us with all the bombs we could carry, went out. You couldn't see the place for smoke after we had left ... The Turks were retreating all the time and we had great sport coming down to about 50 feet and peppering them with machine guns ...\\"MacDougall, Australians at War, p. 100 On 20 March 1917, Drummond, flying a Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2, was one of two pilots who strafed enemy troops threatening Lieutenant Frank McNamara as he rescued a downed Australian airman, the action for which McNamara was awarded his Victoria Cross.Wilson, The Brotherhood of Airmen, pp. 11–13 =Flight commander and ace= Drummond was awarded the Military Cross for \\"conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty\\" on 20 April 1917, when he and Lieutenant Adrian Cole engaged and drove off six enemy aircraft that were attempting to bomb Allied cavalry; the award was promulgated in The London Gazette on 16 August. Drummond was promoted to temporary lieutenant on 1 May 1917. Later that month he was appointed a flight commander in No. 1 Squadron, with the temporary rank of captain.Australian Encyclopaedia, p. 295 He joined No. 111 Squadron RFC as a flight commander and temporary captain in October.Cutlack, The Australian Flying Corps, pp. 87–91 On 12 December, he and his observer were escorting two Australian aircraft in a Bristol Fighter near Tul Karem, Palestine, when they were spotted by three German Albatros scouts. Drummond attacked and destroyed all three of the enemy aircraft. This achievement earned him the Distinguished Service Order for his \\"great skill and daring\\"; the award was promulgated on 26 March 1918. On 27 March 1918, again near Tul Karem, Drummond and another pilot scrambled to attack a German scout. As his wingman dealt with the intruder, Drummond, flying a Nieuport, single-handedly engaged six other German aircraft that had suddenly appeared. According to his own account, after he had destroyed one and \\"sent another down in a spin\\", Drummond developed engine trouble and had to land behind enemy lines. Finding his engine firing again, he took off before he could be captured by Turkish troops and gained a start over the four still-circling German scouts, \\"who had also concluded that the fight was over\\". He was forced to land three more times in enemy territory—once in a cavalry camp where he \\"carried away a line full of washing\\" with his undercarriage in his escape—before he shook off all but one of the pursuing fighters and landed safely behind Allied lines. He was awarded a Bar to his DSO on 26 July for his \\"gallant and successful\\" actions. The RFC merged with the Royal Naval Air Service to form the Royal Air Force (RAF) on 1 April 1918.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, p. 25Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force, p. 1 Drummond was given command of No. 145 Squadron RAF, which operated Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5 fighters, in July 1918, and was made an acting major on 2 September. He finished the war an ace, credited with eight victories,Helson, The Private Air Marshal, p. 154Guttman, Bristol F.2 Fighter Aces of World War I, pp. 76–78Newton, Australian Air Aces, pp. 35, 60 and was mentioned in despatches on 5 June 1919. Inter-war years Drummond remained in the RAF following World War I, holding command of No. 111 Squadron in 1919, and receiving his permanent commission as an acting captain on 1 August that year. He was based in the Sudan from January to July 1920, as part of Britain's system of \\"control without occupation\\", using aircraft instead of armies to put down local rebellions. As acting squadron leader, Drummond commanded \\"H\\" Unit, the entire complement of which consisted of two aircraft.Herington, Air War Against Germany and Italy, p. 52 Returning to Britain, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire on 22 July 1921 in recognition of his \\"excellent work\\" in the face of \\"adverse conditions\\", conducting a successful reconnaissance and bombing campaign against Garjak Nuer tribesmen. He entered RAF Staff College, Andover, in 1922. On 1 January 1923, Drummond was promoted to squadron leader; he graduated from Andover the same year. Also in 1923, he proposed an officer exchange scheme for the RAF and the newly formed Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). Following a staff posting to the Air Ministry, he was seconded to the RAAF in 1925, serving four years as Director of Operations and Intelligence at Air Force Headquarters, Melbourne.Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force, p. 712 He married Isabel Drake-Brockman, cousin of Brigadier General Edmund Drake- Brockman, at St John's Anglican Church in Toorak, Victoria, on 17 July 1929; the couple had a son and two daughters. Drummond returned to the UK in November that year. He studied at the Imperial Defence College, London, in 1930, and was promoted wing commander on 1 July 1931. From November 1931 to June 1933, he commanded RAF Tangmere, a fighter base. After Tangmere, Drummond spent three years at the Air Ministry. In September 1936 he assumed command of RAF Northolt. While in charge of Northolt he was promoted to group captain on 1 January 1937. That November, Drummond was appointed senior air staff officer (SASO) at RAF Middle East in Cairo. He was raised to air commodore on 1 July 1939. World War II =Deputy Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief Middle East= At the outbreak of World War II, Drummond was still SASO RAF Middle East. In early 1940 he became involved in preparations for Operation Pike, an Anglo-French plan to bomb oil fields in the Caucasus; the Soviet Union was at this time seen as allied to Nazi Germany, in the wake of the invasion of Poland and the Winter War. Drummond led a delegation to Aleppo, Syria, to discuss Turkey's defence again possible German or Russian attack. He planned to operate British aircraft out of French bases in northern Syria if Pike went ahead.Osborn, Operation Pike, pp. x, 109, 189, 254 Drummond was made an acting air vice-marshal on 19 June 1940, and temporary air vice-marshal on 10 January the next year. On 1 June 1941, he was raised to acting air marshal and appointed Deputy Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief (AOC-in-C) RAF Middle East, following Air Marshal Sir Arthur Tedder's elevation to AOC-in-C. The Australian Dictionary of Biography credits Tedder and Drummond with developing their command as \\"a mobile strike-force capable of co-operating fully with the other two services\\", and Tedder later remarked on the importance of his deputy's contribution to the Allied victory in North Africa. Tedder's biographer, Vincent Orange, contended that \\"Tedder's growing eminence ... owes a great deal to Drummond's wise and dedicated support\\".Orange, Tedder, p. 123 Richard Casey (centre) and Air Marshal Sir Arthur Tedder (right) in May 1942alt=Mustachioed man in business suit flanked by two men in military uniforms Drummond considered the Middle East a \\"Battle for Airfields\\", as whichever side held the Mediterranean landing grounds could protect its shipping at the expense of the enemy's.Orange, Coningham, pp. 78, 125 Admiral Sir Andrew Cunningham found Drummond \\"a thorough non-cooperator\\" but Drummond's assistant, Arthur Lee, described him as \\"a refreshing man to work with ... without pose or frills, serious, but with a sense of humour nearly as irreverent and sarcastic as Tedder's\\".Orange, Tedder, p. 144 Drummond was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 24 September 1941 \\"in recognition of distinguished services rendered in operational commands of the Royal Air Force\\" from 1 October 1940 to 31 March 1941. His temporary rank of air vice-marshal was made substantive on 14 April 1942. In early 1942 the Australian government sought Drummond for the position of Chief of the Air Staff (CAS) of the RAAF, to succeed Air Chief Marshal Sir Charles Burnett, RAF, at the completion of the latter's two-year term.Helson, The Private Air Marshal, pp. 153–154Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, p. 117 Australia's High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, Stanley Bruce, had recommended Drummond in a cable to Prime Minister John Curtin on 5 February. Although the British government was initially supportive of the plan, the Air Ministry eventually declined to release Drummond from his role in the Middle East, partly to avoid disruption to the region's command and also because it did not believe that Drummond's operational abilities would be put to sufficient use in the largely administrative role of CAS.Helson, The Private Air Marshal, pp. 159–163 Drummond himself was reportedly dubious about the appointment because of the division of authority between RAAF Headquarters and Allied Air Force Headquarters, South West Pacific Area (SWPA).Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 474–475 Burnett had recommended his deputy, Air Vice-Marshal William Bostock, for CAS but in May 1942 the position went to acting Air Commodore George Jones. Bostock in turn became Air Officer Commanding RAAF Command, Australia's main operational organisation under SWPA. An ongoing conflict between Jones (now promoted air vice-marshal) and Bostock led to moves in April 1943 to bring in an officer senior to both men to head the RAAF in a unified command structure, and Drummond was once more approached by the Australian government. Drummond had indicated that he was happy to serve in Australia but the Air Ministry again refused to release him, having selected him for a seat on the Air Council as Air Member for Training.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 116–120Odgers, Air War Against Japan, pp. 15–17 =Final posting and loss at sea= Unfinished sketch of Drummond by alt=Half-portrait of seated man in military uniform Drummond succeeded Air Marshal Sir Guy Garrod as Air Member for Training on 27 April 1943. He was raised to temporary air marshal on 1 June 1943, and appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the King's Birthday Honours the following day. Drummond's position on the Air Council included administering the Empire Air Training Scheme, making him partly responsible for the serious oversupply of aircrew that was apparent by 1944; Drummond believed that the situation would be counteracted only if the upcoming invasion of Europe led to heavy casualties. He remained an advocate of close cooperation between the RAF and Dominion air forces; the Adelaide Advertiser quoted him as saying, \\"Daily journeying to my London office ... I make a point of passing the Boomerang Club at Australia House just for the pleasure and gratification of swapping a salute and a 'good day' with some of the best air crew in the world—the RAAF.\\" On 27 March 1945, Drummond was en route to Canada with other dignitaries to attend a ceremony marking the closure of the Empire Air Training Scheme. His plane, a B-24 Liberator nicknamed Commando that was formerly the personal transport of Winston Churchill, disappeared near the Azores and all aboard were presumed killed.Coulthard-Clark, McNamara VC, p. 104 Frank McNamara, now an RAAF air vice-marshal based in England and a close friend, broke the news to Drummond's widow.Coulthard-Clark, McNamara VC, pp. 105, 108 Air Marshal Sir Roderic Hill succeeded Drummond as Air Member for Training. Drummond was survived by his wife and three children. A memorial service for the victims of the Azores flight was held at St Martin-in-the-Fields on 8 May 1945. Drummond was twice mentioned in despatches for his service in World War II, on 11 June 1942, and on 19 September 1946 (for his performance as SASO RAF Middle East in 1940–41). On 3 May 1946, he was posthumously granted permission to wear the award of Commander of the Order of the Phoenix, conferred by the Kingdom of Greece. Tedder wrote in 1948 that Drummond as Deputy AOC-in-C Middle East \\"bore so much of the burden and took so little of the credit\\"; Vincent Orange observed that the two commanders remained friends and that Drummond \\"might well have succeeded Tedder as Chief of the Air Staff\\" but for his early death. He is commemorated on Panel 264 of the Runnymede Memorial in Surrey.

The Barbary Coast The Barbary slave trade refers to slave markets on the Barbary Coast of North Africa, which included the Ottoman provinces of Algeria, Tunisia and Tripolitania and the independent sultanate of Morocco, between the 16th and middle of the 18th century. The Ottoman provinces in North Africa were nominally under Ottoman suzerainty, but in reality they were mostly autonomous. European slaves were acquired by Barbary pirates in slave raids on ships and by raids on coastal towns from Italy to the Netherlands, Ireland and the Southwest of Britain, as far north as Iceland and into the eastern Mediterranean. The Ottoman eastern Mediterranean was the scene of intense piracy. As late as the 18th century, piracy continued to be a \\"consistent threat to maritime traffic in the Aegean\\".  Extent  Turk and clergyman with Christian slaves, Jan Luyken, 1684 In his 2003 book Christian Slaves, Muslim Masters: White Slavery in the Mediterranean, the Barbary Coast and Italy, 1500–1800, Ohio State University history professor Robert Davis states that most modern historians minimize the white slave trade. Davis estimates that slave traders from Tunis, Algiers, and Tripoli alone enslaved 1 million to 1.25 million Europeans in North Africa, from the beginning of the 16th century to the middle of the 18th (these numbers do not include the European people who were enslaved by Morocco and by other raiders and traders of the Mediterranean Sea coast). Roughly 700 Americans were held captive in this region as slaves between 1785 and 1815. However, to extrapolate his numbers, Davis assumes the number of European slaves captured by Barbary pirates remained roughly constant for a 250-year period, stating: Other historians have challenged Davis' numbers. Peter Earle cautions that the picture of Europeans slaves is clouded by the fact the corsairs also seized non-Christian whites from eastern Europe and black people from western Africa. Christian prisoners are sold as slaves on a square in Algiers, Jan Luyken, 1684 Middle East expert and researcher John Wright cautions that modern estimates are based on back-calculations from human observation. A second book by Davis, Holy War and Human Bondage: Tales of Christian-Muslim Slavery in the Early-Modern Mediterranean, widened its focus to related slavery.Robert Davis, Holy War and Human Bondage: Tales of Christian-Muslim Slavery in the Early- Modern Mediterranean, Praeger Series on the Early Modern World (2010). The authorities of Ottoman and pre-Ottoman times kept no relevant official records, but observers in the late 1500s and early 1600s estimated that around 35,000 European slaves were held throughout this period on the Barbary Coast, across Tripoli and Tunis, but mostly in Algiers. The majority were sailors (particularly those who were English), taken with their ships, but others were fishermen and coastal villagers. However, most of these captives were people from lands close to Africa, particularly Italy. From bases on the Barbary coast, North Africa, the Barbary pirates raided ships traveling through the Mediterranean and along the northern and western coasts of Africa, plundering their cargo and enslaving the people they captured. From at least 1500, the pirates also conducted raids on seaside towns of Italy, Spain, France, England, the Netherlands and as far away as Iceland, capturing men, women and children. On some occasions, settlements such as Baltimore in Ireland were abandoned following a raid, only being resettled many years later. Between 1609 and 1616, England alone lost 466 merchant ships to Barbary pirates.Rees Davies, \\"British Slaves on the Barbary Coast\\", BBC, 1 July 2003 While Barbary corsairs looted the cargo of ships they captured, their primary goal was to capture non-Muslim people for sale as slaves or for ransom. Those who had family or friends who might ransom them were held captive; the most famous of these was the author Miguel de Cervantes, who was held for almost five years - from 1575 to 1580. Others were sold into various types of servitude. Captives who converted to Islam were generally freed, since enslavement of Muslims was prohibited; but this meant that they could never return to their native countries.Diego de Haedo, Topografía e historia general de Argel, 3 vols., Madrid, 1927-29.Daniel Eisenberg, \\"¿Por qué volvió Cervantes de Argel?\\", in Ingeniosa invención: Essays on Golden Age Spanish Literature for Geoffrey L.

Sixteenth- and 17th-century customs statistics suggest that Istanbul's additional slave imports from the Black Sea may have totaled around 2.5 million from 1450 to 1700. The markets declined after Sweden and the United States defeated the Barbary States in the Barbary Wars (1800-1815). A US Navy expedition under Commodore Edward Preble engaged gunboats and fortifications in Tripoli in 1804. A British diplomatic mission led to some confused orders and a massacre; UK and Dutch ships delivered a punishing nine-hour bombardment of Algiers in 1816 leading to an acceptance of terms. The trade ended with the French conquest of Algeria (1830-1847). The Kingdom of Morocco had already suppressed piracy and recognized the United States as an independent country in 1776.  Origins  The slave trade had existed in North Africa since antiquity, with a supply of African slaves arriving through trans-Saharan trade routes. The towns on the North African coast were recorded in Roman times for their slave markets, and this trend continued into the medieval age. The Barbary Coast increased in influence in the 15th century, when the Ottoman Empire took over as rulers of the area. Coupled with this was an influx of Sephardi Jews and Moorish refugees, newly expelled from Spain after the Reconquista. With Ottoman protection and a host of destitute immigrants, the coastline soon became reputed for piracy. Crews from the seized ships were either enslaved or ransomed. Between 1580 and 1680, there were in Barbary around 15,000 renegades, Christian Europeans who converted to Islam, and half of the corsair captains were in fact renegades. Some of them were slaves that converted to Islam but most had probably never been slaves and had come to North Africa looking for opportunity.  Rise of the Barbary Pirates  The bombardment of Algiers in 1682, by Abraham Duquesne. After a revolt in the mid-17th century reduced the ruling Ottoman Pashas to little more than figureheads in the region, the towns of Tripoli, Algiers, Tunis, and others became independent in all but name. Without a large central authority and its laws, the pirates themselves started to gain much influence. In 1785 when Thomas Jefferson and John Adams went to London to negotiate with Tripoli's envoy, Ambassador Sidi Haji Abdrahaman, they asked him what right he had to take slaves in this way. He replied that the \\"right\\" was \\"founded on the Laws of the Prophet, that it was written in their Koran that all nations who should not have answered their authority were sinners, that it was their right and duty to make war upon them wherever they could be found, and to make slaves of all they could take as prisoners, and that every Mussulman who should be slain in battle was sure to go to Paradise\\". Pirate raids for the acquisition of slaves occurred in towns and villages on the African Atlantic seaboard, as well as in Europe. Reports of Barbary raids and kidnappings of those in Italy, Spain, France, Portugal, England, Netherlands, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, and as far north as Iceland exist from between the 16th to the 19th centuries. It is estimated that between 1 million and 1.25 million Europeans were captured by pirates and sold as slaves in Tunis, Algiers and Tripoli during this time period. The slave trade in Europeans in other parts of the Mediterranean is not included in this estimation. Famous accounts of Barbary slave raids include a mention in the diary of Samuel Pepys and a raid on the coastal village of Baltimore, Ireland, during which pirates left with the entire populace of the settlement. The attack was led by a Dutch captain, Jan Janszoon van Haarlem, also known as Murad Reis the Younger. Janszoon also led the 1627 raid on Iceland. Such raids in the Mediterranean were so frequent and devastating that the coastline between Venice and Málaga suffered widespread depopulation, and settlement there was discouraged. In fact, it was said that \\"there was no one left to capture any longer.\\" The power and influence of these pirates during this time was such that nations including the United States paid tribute in order to stave off their attacks. Supplies from the Black Sea appear to have been even larger. A compilation of partial statistics and patchy estimates indicates that almost 2 million Russians, Ukrainians, and Poles were seized from 1468 to 1694. Additionally, there were slaves from the Caucasus obtained by a mixture of raiding and trading. 16th- and 17th-century customs statistics suggest that Istanbul's slave import from the Black Sea may have totaled around 2.5 million from 1450 to 1700.  Decline  A US Navy expedition under Commodore Edward Preble engaging gunboats and fortifications in Tripoli, 1804. In the first years of the 19th century, the United States and some European nations fought and won the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War against the pirates. The Barbary Wars were a direct response of the UK, French and the Dutch states to the raids and the slave trade by the Barbary pirates, which ended in the 1830s when the region was conquered by France. The white slave trade and markets in the Mediterranean declined and eventually disappeared after the European occupations. After an Anglo-Dutch raid in 1816 on 27 August on Algiers lead by Admiral Edward Pellew, 1st Viscount Exmouth immobilized most of the Pirate fleet, the Dey of Algiers was forced to agree to terms which included the release of the surviving 1,200 Christian slaves and the cessation of the practice of enslaving Christians, although slave trading in non- Europeans could still continue. After losing in this period of formal hostilities with European and American powers, the Barbary states went into decline. The Barbary pirates did not cease their operations, and another raid by the UK on Algiers took place in 1824. France invaded Algiers in 1830, placing it under colonial rule. Tunis was similarly invaded by France in 1881. Tripoli returned to direct Ottoman control in 1835, before falling into Italian hands in the 1911 Italo-Turkish War. As such, the slave traders now found that they had to work in accordance with the laws of their governors, and could no longer look to self-regulation. The slave trade ceased on the Barbary coast in the 19th and 20th centuries or when European governments passed laws granting emancipation to slaves. The word razzia was borrowed via Italian and French from Maghrebi Arabic ghaziya (غزية \\"raiding\\"), originally referring to slave raids conducted by Barbary pirates.

Early life Duff was born Monek Prager to a Jewish family in Tarnów, Poland on 7 June 1929. His father, a rabbi, helped the family flee the Nazis and emigrate to England in the late 1930s. Career in boxing =Four-year career as boxer= Duff became a professional boxer aged fifteen, and boxed for four years. According to Mickey, he chose the name Duff from the character, \\"Jackie-Boy Duffy\\" from the movie Cash and Carry, though the character actually came from the 1941 boxing movie, Ringside Maisie. The ring name hid his boxing career from his disapproving father, with whom he would have a strained relationship for life, though for other reasons.Got his name from a boxing movie in \\"Square Ring Turns Full Circle\\", The Observer, London, England, pg. 53, 8 December 1996 Starting his career after WWII, from September, 1945, to May, 1946, Duff fought fourteen bouts in the greater London area, winning twelve, with only one loss and one draw. He eventually achieved a 75% winning boxing record in a career that included around fifty fights, but lost his last professional bout on December 7, 1948, against Scottish boxer Neil McCearn, in West Ham, in an eight round points decision. BoxRec, the online boxing record site, lists 46 of his better- publicized bouts. =Achievements as boxing promoter, match-maker, and manager= After briefly working selling sewing machines, Duff returned to boxing to make matches across the UK. In the late 1950s Jack Solomons was England's greatest boxing promoter. As Solomons' ironclad control of British boxing waned, a new team began to form with Duff as match maker, Jarvis Astaire as manager, and friend and mentor Harry Levene, as promoter. He also had as partners Terry Lawless, Mike Barrett, and the British Broadcasting Company (BBC).\\"Square Ring Turns Full Circle\\", The Observer, London, England, pg. 53, 8 December 1996 One publication described Duff and his partners's ascendancy in the boxing world, as \\"an efficient cartel which broke one monopoly and established another.\\" Duff become vastly more famous as a manager, matchmaker, and promoter than he was as a London area boxer. His participation and strong position in the sport as a promoter and matchmaker would extend over four decades from 1953 through 1997. Top boxers in his stable During his strong position as a promoter and manager, he was involved with at least 16 world champions and many leading British fighters, including: * Terry Downes (1961) * Frank Bruno * Joe Calzaghe * Howard Winstone (1968) * John Conteh (1974) * Barry McGuigan (1984) * Lloyd Honeyghan (1986) * Maurice Hope * Charlie Magri * Alan Minter * John H Stracey * Jim Watt * John \\"The Beast\\" Mugabi * Cornelius Boza Edwards. The clout and connections that Duff could bring to bear from his media contacts, wealth, and professional associations could fast channel a competitors rise to a championship bout. Duff's participation and then dominant place in British boxing lasted through the sixty's, seventies, and most of the eighties. Widely credited media roles Duff became widely known in the media, particularly for the awards he received for his work on HBO Boxing (1973), ESPN Top Rank Boxing (1980), and as a consultant with the movie Triumph of the Spirit (1990). ESPN and HBO, however, would not remain the exclusive, or dominant line to the world and British boxing market. =Frank Warren's rise and Duff's fall from prominence= By the 1990s, Duff's primary competitor, promoter Frank Warren, had seventy-five boxers in his stable, and could be described accurately by London's Observer as \\"the only show in town\\". Equally significant was Warren's 50,000,000 pound deal with Britain's largest pay tv network, Sky TV, British commercial television network, ITV and his direct line to the American TV market through promoter Don King. Duff, who was once the major player in London, saw three of his top fighters, Frank Bruno, Joe Calzaghe, and Henry Akinwande leave him for more profitable deals with Warren, sapping both Duff's financial position and market share. Eventually giving in to diminishing health, loss of his boxing stable, and Frank Warren's dominance through his partnership with ITV and Sky TV, Duff retired.

Detachment Kuhlmey () was a temporary unit of Nazi Germany's Luftwaffe during World War II. The unit was commanded by Oberstleutnant Kurt Kuhlmey and the detachment was built around the unit Schlachtgeschwader 3, which also was commanded by Kuhlmey. Operational history The unit participated in large battles in summer 1944, during the Finnish-Soviet Continuation War. When the Soviet Red Army launched its fourth strategic offensive on 9 June 1944 C. G. E. Mannerheim asked Nazi Germany for help. Among the help that arrived was a Luftwaffe unit that arrived in Finland on 12 June. The aircraft landed at the Immola Airfield on 17 June. The unit used the whole airfield from there on. The unit flew some 2,700 missions and dropped 770 tonnes of bombs. It destroyed over 150 Soviet aircraft, about 200 tanks, and dozens of bridges and transport vessels. Personnel losses included 23 pilots killed and 24 wounded in battle. The unit lost 41 of its aircraft.Bergström 2008, p. 59. The detachment consisted of some 70 airworthy aircraft to support the 200 strong Finnish force,Bergström 2008, p. 58–59. but its operational strength varied due to losses, additions and troop movements. The unclear structure is partly explained by the Luftwaffe replacement programs, where obsolete Junkers Ju 87 \\"Stuka\\" dive bombers were replaced by Focke-Wulf Fw 190 jabo's (fighter- bombers). According to this, II./SG 3 was training at Jēkabpils, I./SG 5 in Pori, and III and IV./JG 54 in Illesheim, and they could not participate in the fighting on the Karelian Isthmus. I./SG 3, which was in Finland, received new Fw 190 aircraft as soon as they left Finland for Tartu. Organisation The following units and aircraft in Finland belonged to Detachment Kuhlmey: * I./SG 3: 33 Junkers Ju 87 D-5 Stuka dive bombers *II./JG 54: 29-62 Focke-Wulf Fw 190 A-6 fighters *I./SG 5: 16 Focke-Wulf Fw 190 F-3 and F-8 jabos at Alakurtti. *I./NaGr 5: 1-8 Messerschmitt Bf 109 G-8 reconnaissance aircraft The transport squadron TGr.10 of German aligned Italy's air force that operated in the theater also supported the unit, and it consisted of 35 Savoia Marchetti SM.81/AR transport aircraft and a number of transport, liaison and reconnaissance aircraft. The majority of the aircraft of the unit left Finland on 23 July, but I/SG 5 who stayed until 13 August. A memorial was raised at the Immola Airfield on 23 July 1994 in gratitude and in memory of the unit.

Arrested for protesting during the Chinese invasion of Tibet, he spent 33 years in Chinese prisons and labor camps, where he was extensively tortured, and served the longest term of any Tibetan political prisoner. After his release in 1992 he fled to Dharamsala in North India, in exile. He was still a practicing monk and became a political activist, traveling the world publicizing the cause of Tibet up until his death in 2018. His autobiography Fire Under the Snow is also known as The Autobiography of a Tibetan Monk. He was the subject of the 2008 documentary film Fire Under the Snow. Life Palden Gyatso was born in 1933 in the Tibetan village of Panam, located on the Nyangchu River between Gyantse and Shigatse. A few days after his birth a search party of high lamas arrived from Drag Riwoche Monastery and announced that he was one of the candidates for the reincarnation of a high lama who had died the year before. In 1943, he entered Gadong Monastery as a novice monk. During the Chinese invasion, he became a fully ordained monk of the Gelug school. At the invitation of the 14th Dalai Lama, he moved to Drepung Monastery near Lhasa to complete his studies.Palden Gyatso bio at Free Tibet Campaign Palden Gyatso was arrested in June 1959 by Chinese officials for demonstrating during the 10 March 1959 Tibetan uprising.

The Autobiography of a Tibetan Monk was published in 1998. The Dalai Lama noted in the forward that \\"His sense of the justice of our cause and his indignation at what has been done to so many Tibetans are so urgent that he has not rested. Having for years resisted Communist Chinese efforts to conceal and distort it, he has seized the opportunity to tell the world the truth about Tibet.” During his visits to America and Europe, he became politically active as an opponent of the Chinese occupation in Tibet and as a witness of many years under Chinese confinement.3 Tibetans Continue Hunger Strike Washington Post, February 26, 2006, Page E18 In 1995, he was the first Tibetan political prisoner to address the United Nations Human Rights Council and also addressed the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Human Rights.

Career  Thomsen was a German diplomat for the Third Reich. Thomsen served as Chargé d'Affaires at the Embassy of Germany in Washington, representing the German government in the U.S. from November 1938 (after the recall of ambassador Hans-Heinrich Dieckhoff) to December 11, 1941 (termination of relations after declaration of war). In 1943 he replaced Victor zu Wied (the brother of William, Prince of Albania) at the German delegation in Stockholm, Sweden, remaining there to the end of the war. During late April 1943, he may have been involved in abortive peace negotiations with Alexandra Kollontai, his Soviet counterpart in Stockholm. Thomsen was interrogated prior to the Nuremberg tribunals but was not charged with any crime. In the early 1950s he served as head of the Hamburg chapter of the Red Cross.  Thomsen and the isolationists  Like Dieckhoff, Thomsen suffered no illusions about the U.S. administration's policy towards Nazi Germany, and he sent warnings to the German government advising them of President Roosevelt's hostility. Therefore, he was involved in several attempts to drum up American isolationist opinion, including efforts to get American authors to write in opposition to American involvement in the War. Thomsen also orchestrated a campaign to influence the 1940 Republican National Convention to pass an anti- war platform. Thomsen reported to the German foreign ministry on June 12, 1940 that a \\"well-known Republican congressman\\" had offered to take a group of fifty isolationists to the convention in exchange for $3,000 (). Thomsen asked for funds for this and for full page advertisements to be placed in newspapers during the convention. These ads were written by George Viereck, a German agent on the staff of Congressman Hamilton Fish, and appear to have been influential: the wording of the foreign policy plank, reported Thomsen, \\"was taken almost verbatim\\" from an ad which appeared in the New York Times and other papers. Fish does not appear to have been personally involved in these efforts, though he headed the National Committee to Keep America Out of Foreign Wars which sponsored the ads.  Purple cipher  Thomsen warned his government, in April 1941, that the Japanese diplomatic code (code-named Purple by the Americans) had been broken by the Americans, having been tipped off by the Soviet ambassador to the US, Konstantin Umansky. These warnings were passed on to the Japanese government, but in the end they were not acted upon, and American cryptographers continued to read Japanese messages through the war. Text from excerpt of first chapter on WNYC website  Thomsen and Donovan  Just before the Pearl Harbor attack, Thomsen was involved in a curious attempt by William Donovan, the United States Coordinator of Information, to recruit him entirely to the American side. Thomsen had been supplying information on German military strength and movements to Malcolm Lovell, a real estate developer involved in Quaker anti-war efforts. Lovell understood himself to be an intermediary and passed the information on to Donovan. These messages included various warnings about Japanese actions and their consequences, including warnings that the Japanese Empire was compelled by its position to attack the United States; on November 13, 1940, he also passed through a message that Germany would join with Japan if the latter were to declare war on the United States. Donovan and Roosevelt were not entirely sure what to make of this information; nonetheless, just before the attack, Donovan offered Thomsen a million dollars in exchange for a public statement distancing himself from the Nazi regime.

William Raspberry, Washington Post columnist called the strategies outlined in the book, \\"the plan to save America.\\" In 1997, Austin founded the Village Foundation, an organization dedicated to \\"repairing the breach\\" between African-American males and the rest of society. Its mission was to engage African-American young men and boys in American society, by reconnecting them first to their local communities and then to the larger society. One of the leading initiatives of the Village Foundation was the \\"Give a Boy a Book Day campaign.\\" The program was designed to encourage reading and literacy among young African-American men.

Luminaries and practitioners alike walked participants through the philosophical roots of the initiative, the future of developing grassroots leadership for African-American young men and their families, and explored the current groundswell of interest in African- American men among the philanthropic community. Austin is listed as one of the 50 African-Americans who forever changed academia.

He is remembered for the eponymous \\"Morison's pouch\\", also known as the hepatorenal recess, being described as an anatomical space between the under surface of the liver and the right kidney. His name is also associated with a surgical incision for access to sigmoid colon and pelvis, particularly used if the midline is very scarred from previous surgery (Rutherford Morison incision), and a medical instrument (Rutherford Morison tissue forceps). During World War I, he was stationed at the Northumberland War Hospital, where he introduced a paste for treatment of contaminated wounds.
