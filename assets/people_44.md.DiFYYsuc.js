It is operated by XTAR and Hisdesat Its launch short after the Spainsat is part of an effort to strengthen Spain's communication ties with allied countries around the globe, particularly in maters of national security (defense, disaster relief...).  Body  The satellite is based on the Space Systems/Loral LS-1300 model. Consequently it is shaped like a box (5.4 x 2.9 x 2.2 m) with a total weight of 1412 kg (3631 kg at launch). The sides of the box contain two retractable solar panels (providing up to 3.6 kW of power) while the lower base (facing anti-radial direction) holds the communication module. This module operates on the X band (compatible with SATCOM systems employed by NATO) and consists of 12 X-band transponders of 72 MHz broadband each (reserving 4 for usage by the Spanish Ministry of Defense while offering the other 8 for potential partners) and a 2.4 diameter antenna. The system allows both RHCP and LHCP polarization while covering an area of 6,3095 m2 RCS (2 global beams from Eastern Brazil and the Atlantic Ocean, across all of Africa and the Middle East to as far east as Singapore, 1 beam across the Mediterranean Sea and 4 steerable beams with the possibility of overlapping). Additional systems provide 3-axis inflight stability.

Background  On 25th of August 2001 Declan Gavin was killed on Crumlin Road, Dublin 12. There had been an altercation involving passengers in a Nissan Micra car outside an Abrakebabra. From this car a person jumped out wearing a balaclava and holding a knife. This person then stabbed Declan Gavin, Gavin ran inside the Abrakebabra followed by the man brandishing a knife. The man with the knife did not gain entrance to the fast food restaurant as the security guard closed the door. After multiple failed attempts of forcing entry to the Abrakebabra he ran back to the car and sped off. There was a palm print in what appeared to a blood like substance on the window of the fast food restaurant, this print was identified as Brian Rattigan's palm print. Subsequently, a finger print from the door of Abrekabara was also found to be Brian Rattigans. Rattigan was then arrested by the Garda√≠ and interviewed. Interviews were conducted and recorded on paper however Rattigan refused to sign any of these. Within these interviews Rattigan was \\"evasive and maintained that he had not been near Crumlin Shopping Centre for a considerable time.\\" Rattigan claimed that he was not in the vicinity of Crumlin Road on the 25th August 2001 nor was he near this place for several months. He made claims that he was having sexual relations with a married woman and refused to name the woman on the night of the attack on Gavin. However, this alibi was lacking any sufficient detail or supporting evidence. He then said that he was at his brother Joey's birthday party and that he did not leave this event all night. He made the comment that he will not admit anything and that it was the job of the Garda√≠ to prove it. When asked about his presence in the Nissan Micra car he said he could not remember. The many answers given by Rattigan were conflicting, at one stage he was at the party, then others he could not remember his whereabouts, other times when answering his affair with the married woman was his answer but when pressed on this issue he claimed not to be with her on the 25th August 2001. The glass window in Abrakebabra was replaced the previous week to the murder of Gavin and this window is cleaned around three times a week. Also of note the Nissan Micra which was at the scene of the stabbing was found burning in the Cookstown Industrial Estate shortly after the stabbing. This car was also stopped by a member of the Garda√≠ and it was confirmed that Shane Moloney and Joey Rattigan the brother of Brian Rattigan, were in the car. This case based on the facts above appeared before the High Court, however issues arose in the fact that there was extreme delay by the DPP in bringing proceedings against Rattigan. There were severe delays in the production to the court of a book of evidence. This along with the media coverage of the legal proceeding was a contentious matter as Rattigan argued.  Holding of the Supreme Court  Mr Justice Geoghan of the Supreme Court delivered the decision in this case of Rattigan's appeal of the decision of Mr. Justice O'Higgins in the High Court. Rattigan made an application for judicial review on multiple grounds. In the High Court the injunction was refused against the DPP. The injunction was requested on three grounds, prosecutorial delay in bringing the prosecution, the alleged prejudicial media coverage which was proposed to negatively impact on Rattigan's chances of receiving a fair trial and finally it was alleged that there was a lack of recording of interviews. In relation to the prosecutorial delay it was clear that there was significant time which elapsed in this case at all stages. In September 2001 Rattigan was arrested but was released days later. He was then rearrested in November 2001. The file on Rattigan's alleged murder of Gavin was given to the Chief Prosecution Solicitor in March 2002, it was then forwarded to the DPP at the end of the same month. It was not until September 2003 that Rattigan was to be charged with the murder. He was then charged and remanded in custody until November 2003. After appearing before the District Judge seven times the case was struck out, due to undue delay in December 2003. The 16 month delay before Rattigan was again charged was accompanied by various excuses. These excuses included the fact that changes had to be made to the book of evidence because of recent case law and the choice to rely on finger print evidence. The Supreme Court did not accept this argument. Whilst being critical of the DPP for the extensive delay the Court did not find that this was grounds for the injunction to be granted in favour of Rattigan and to dismiss the murder trial against him. A minor ground which was referred to in relation to the judicial review was the lack of electronic recording. This point was given little attention and was seen as irrelevant, the complaint in relation to this was lodged regarding the witness statements. This was irrelevant as these could not be entered into court but rather the witness would have to give evidence in Court. Furthermore, reference was made to the fact that there was no legal obligation in relation to recording the interviews at that time. These arguments were rejected by Justice Geoghegan The prejudicial media coverage was alleged to be occurring in relation to the murder trial but also the trial in the High Court for judicial review. Justice Geoghegan did state that there were newspaper articles which could have had the effect of creating an unfair trial. The right to a fair trial has been established in this case as a constitutional right which is superior. However, this right is being addressed in light of the right of the public to a fair prosecution especially in the case of a crime so severe as this case. The Court took the stance that the publicity had occurred before the trial and therefore had faded from the memory of persons and the length of the trial usually suggests that an unfair trial as a result of the media coverage will reduce. In this instance too the Supreme Court agreed with the decision reached by the High Court and found that the alleged prejudicial media coverage was not in fact a reason for this trial to be abandoned. There was reference made to further media coverage which had been published following the trial in the High Court which was assessed by the Supreme Court. An issue arose in relation to a Sunday Tribune and Daily Mail articles about which there were contempt of court proceedings issued. These cases remained unsettled until after the decision of the Court in the judicial review case brought by Rattigan. This material was apologised for and a confirmation that information similar to that which was contained in the article would not be reproduced. In this case it was understood that the independent evidence of the blood fingerprint was strong and to prohibit the trial on the risk of unfairness due to media courage would not be correct. In conclusion the appeal on the grounds of judicial review was not granted and the case was allowed to proceed even thought there was a delay by the DPP. The judgement issued by Justice Geoghegan was supported with concurring decisions by all other Judges in the case.

He inherited the Baronetcy at a late age after his cousin and two elder brothers died without issue. He inherited the family seat at Ayston, a village where he was already Rector, and near which he seems to have spent most of his life. He died at age 92, having been connected to the parish of Ayston for nearly 70 years.  Early life  John Henry Fludyer was born the youngest of seven children of George Fludyer MP and Lady Mary Fane, daughter of John Fane, 9th Earl of Westmorland. His two elder brothers had military careers, and while he was at school at Westminster, he wished to follow them. His father, however, had decided that the Church should be his career, and so he went up to St John's College, Cambridge, where he took his BA in 1826. He was appointed Curate to the parish of Ayston in 1826.  Marriage and family  In 1832 Fludyer married Augusta, daughter of Sir Richard Borough, Bart, and granddaughter of Viscount Lake. In 1834 he was appointed Rector of Thistleton and Ayston. (The living was in the gift of his father George.) His eldest three children of their seven children died of scarlet fever at the ages of 4, 6 and 8 years while the family were living in Thistleton In 1863, on the death of his second brother William the remaining family moved to Ayston Hall, whose grounds adjoin the church there, and in 1870 he resigned the living at Thistleton. In 1879-80 he and Augusta restored the church in the memory of their three eldest children.

Augusta died in 1889. Henry was reputed to be a devoted husband, and it was said that never once did she leave the room without his standing to open the door for her, and that every year he cut the first rose of the season for her, and placed it on her boudoir table. At his death, at the age of 93, his personal probate was ¬£9,810. He was buried beside her in Ayston.

Background  The Bank of Ireland Mortgage Bank (\\"Bank of Ireland\\") (the appellant in the appeal) brought a case in the High Court against Mr Coleman (the respondent in the appeal), a solicitor. The basis of Bank of Ireland's claim was that Mr Coleman had given a solicitor's undertaking (a commitment to do or not to do something) not to release ‚Ç¨250,500 advanced by Bank of Ireland to Mr Coleman (acting as solicitor for a borrower) until Mr Coleman had ensured that the borrower would obtain good marketable title to the relevant property and that Bank of Ireland would have first legal charge over the property. In breach of this undertaking, Mr Coleman released the money without having received a \\"duly executed mortgage by the borrower in favour of the Bank of Ireland over the property being purchased by the borrower\\". Following default on the loan by the borrower, Bank of Ireland sought compensation for Mr Coleman's breach by requesting that the High Court exercise its \\"inherent jurisdiction ... over solicitors as its officers\\" by ordering Mr Coleman to repay the full ‚Ç¨250,500, plus interest. Mr Coleman argued that it \\"was not a claim for debt nor a claim for damages for breach of contract nor a claim for conversion or money had and received or indeed for compensation or damages for breach of trust or breach of an agency agreement\\" and that any remedy that might be ordered was, therefore, discretionary. In the High Court, Laffoy J concluded that Mr Coleman's obligation was to ensure that Bank of Ireland had proper security over the mortgaged property, something that Mr Coleman had failed to do. If it were impossible to comply with Mr Coleman's \\"ultimate obligation\\", then the correct amount of compensation should relate to the value of the security that Bank of Ireland should have obtained, not simply the amount of the loan. The High Court judge went on to note, however, that it was still possible for Mr Coleman to comply with the \\"ultimate obligation‚Äù. As a result, she dismissed Bank of Ireland's claim. Bank of Ireland appealed.  Holding of the Supreme Court  In the Supreme Court, Geoghegan J provided the only written judgment, with which Fennelly J and Finnegan J concurred. The Supreme Court largely agreed with the reasoning of Laffoy J in the High Court. The Supreme Court confirmed the position as outlined in IPLG Limited v Stuart [1992] IEHC 372 that courts retain an inherent disciplinary jurisdiction over its officers. Geoghegan J noted the > ‚Äúclear affirmation that the inherent jurisdiction of the court in respect of > solicitors' misconduct still existed in Ireland notwithstanding that the > Solicitors Act 1960 did not provide that solicitors were officers of the > court but created the well known procedures of hearings by a disciplinary > committee of the Law Society followed by hearings by the President of the > High Court.‚Äù Geoghegan J also referred to the statement of Bowen LJ in Re GreyRe Grey [1892] 2 Q.B. 440 that, ‚Äú[I]f the jurisdiction of the court still exists, then it seems to me that, the matter being one of discretion, no hard and fast rules can be laid down whereby such discretion would be fettered‚Äù. The court went on to note that when deciding upon the solicitor's undertaking, the overall outcome should be taken into account rather than singular aspects of the undertaking. The Supreme Court agreed with Laffoy J in the High Court in that it would be inappropriate to order Mr Coleman to repay ‚Ç¨250,500 with or without interest when the Bank by its own negligence had \\"provided loan facilities on an overvaluation of the property.\\" However, the Supreme Court disagreed with Laffoy J's finding that, if it was still possible for the respondent to complete the undertaking, compensation should not be awarded. The Supreme Court concluded that the jurisdiction is not merely supervisory. \\"While the jurisdiction is compensatory rather than punitive, it still retains a disciplinary aspect.\\" Since the High Court hearing, Bank of Ireland's security interest had been correctly put in place. Despite this, \\"there was a serious and inexcusable breach of the defendant‚Äôs obligations not just in relation to the payment but in relation to the undertaking as a whole\\" and losses had been suffered. Therefore the appeal was allowed by the Supreme Court and remitted back to the High Court where the scale of Bank of Ireland's losses could be assessed.

He is famous for being a globe-trotter, with escapades in Israel, Egypt, Palestine, India, the United States, and elsewhere. His only published book, which covered his travel adventures, was titled An African Abroad published in 1963. His name, in Nigeria today, is synonymous with 'travel'.  Early life and education  Olabisi Ajala was born in Ghana in 1929 to a Nigerian family. It was a polygamous family, with about thirty children and four wives. Olabisi was the twenty-fifth. When he was a child, his family moved to Nigeria. There he attended Baptist Academy in Lagos and Ibadan Boys‚Äô High School in Ibadan. In 1952, he moved to the United States to study pre-medicine student at the University of Chicago. There he was the first black student in the Delta Upsilon Pi ‚Äòfratority‚Äô, a co-educational Greek-letter organization. He later moved to Roosevelt University (then called \\"Roosevelt College\\") to study Psychology.  Travel in the United States  In Chicago, √Äj√†l√° conceived of a cross-country trip to Los Angeles on a bicycle. The trip \\"covered about 2,280 miles in 28 days, ending in Los- Angeles on July 10.\\" The trip earned him many accolades, including coverage in the major newspapers of the time. Upon arrival in Los Angeles two days ahead of schedule, √Äj√†l√° was received by the city mayor Fletcher Bowron. He did not return to Chicago. In Los Angeles, he became a mini superstar, and gave a lot of interviews. He was later cast in a movie called White Witch Doctor, based on the 1950 novel by Louise A. Stinetorf, and produced by 20th century Fox. He had been given the recommendation by Ronald Reagan whom he had met three years earlier. He was also signed up to act in the movie \\"Killer Ape\\" but never started work on it. His celebrity was accompanied by many women. One of them was a Chicago nurse named Myrtle Basset who gave him his first child named ·ªål√°dip√∫p·ªçÃÅ Andrei Ajala (born on January 21, 1953). ·ªål√°dip√∫p·ªçÃÄ means \\"wealth has increased.\\" But √Äj√†l√° had first denied paternity of the child. He had to be forced by the courts to pay ten dollars per week to the mother when he refused to show up in court to take the blood test he had ordered. ·ªål√°b√≠s√≠ then disappeared and never saw ·ªål√°dip√∫p·ªçÃÄ again until 1976 when the latter had become a pianist. ·ªål√°dip√∫p·ªçÃÄ died on January 19, 2020.  Legal problems and deportation  Later that year, after a number of run-ins with the law for petty offenses like issuing false checks, he was sentenced to one-year suspended jail term. Also because he had abandoned his school work‚Äîhe had supposedly transferred to Santa Monica Junior College but was not keeping up with his studies‚Äîhe was ordered to be deported to Nigeria. He protested the deportation order, saying he would be executed by his father in a tribal tradition. First he climbed on an 80-foot radio tower, threatening to kill himself unless the order was rescinded. After about 24 hours, he jumped down from about fifteen feet and sustained a sprained back. He also then began a hunger strike that lasted thirty days. Eventually, he was deported, but to London instead.  Return to America  In December 1954, ·ªål√°b√≠s√≠ returned to the United States with another wife called Hermine Aileen, a New York model. They settled in Chicago. In 1955, she later divorced him on charges of philandering and adultery, a charge he did not contest. In December 1955, he remarried again, this time to a 19-year-old London actress named Joan Simons.  Trip around the world and \\"An African Abroad\\"  On April 27, 1957, √Äj√†l√° began a trip \\"around the world\\" from London. These would form the basis for his 1963 biography called \\"An African Abroad\\", with an introduction by Tom Mboya. He planned to visit forty countries. To write the book, √Äj√†l√° had visited India, Soviet Union, Iran, Jordan, Israel, Palestine, Egypt, and finally, Australia. He travelled round all of them on his Vespa scooter, which had famous autographs of the famous people he had met. On his journey around the world, he met many more, among whom were Jawaharlal Nehru, Golda Meir, Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, Gamal Abdel Nasser, The Shah of Iran,and Nikita Khrushchev. He also visited Poland, Germany, Prague, Czechoslovakia, Austria, Yugoslavia, Albania, Bulgaria, Rumani, Hungary, and Turkey. He also suffered encounters with law enforcement; once in the Soviet Union where he was accused of trying to assassinate Nikita Khrushchev by being too close to him in public, and at another time in the border between Israel and Palestine, where he was almost shot for speeding across without permission. All these were documented in his autobiography, which was published. The book was written as a travelogue and a piece of journalism. He expressed opinion on how people lived in the places he visited, opined on the political situation in Israel and Palestine, as well as on the world leaders he met. In Sydney, where the book was published, he married Joanne and had three children with her.  Return to Nigeria and more marriage  Afterwards, √Äj√†l√° returned to Nigeria and became a famous socialite. He also became an entertainment promoter and publicist, who worked with artistes like Sikiru Ayinde Barrister. They later had a falling out. He was praised in songs notably by Ebenezer Obey with the words \\"You have travelled all over the world. √Äj√†l√° travelled all over the world...\\". From then on, the words \\"√Äj√†l√° travels\\" became synonymous with wanderlust and extensive traveling. The album sold millions of copies. In Nigeria, he married Alhaja ·π¢ad√©, and was reputed to have children by a few other women.  Last days and death  While living in Lagos, √Äj√†l√° suffered a stroke in the early days of 1999, and did not receive adequate care. He died of stroke on February 2, 1999.  Legacy  √Äj√†l√° is known today as Nigeria's most famous traveller. His name is equated to travel and adventure. His work as a journalist is not as well known, and neither are his philandering ways. His children continue to live in many parts of the world. His autobiography \\"An African Abroad\\" is currently out of print.

Introduction  In 1965 when the Rockefeller Foundation moved to New Haven, Jordi Casals was appointed professor of epidemiology at Yale University (within the Rockefeller Foundation). Jordi Casals carried out noted studies on multiple diseases, including Lassa fever. He identified Lassa virus and a large number of other pathogens; among them, the Zika virus. Casals was a consultant for numerous health institutions and organizations, and was awarded the Kimble Methodology Award by the American Public Health Association for his scientific curriculum. He is considered a world authority in the field of viruses, especially arboviruses.  Career  After graduating medical school in Barcelona, Casals moved to New York in 1936, and worked in the Department of Pathology at Cornell University Medical College in New York. In 1938, he moved to the Rockefeller Institute of Medical Research (now Rockefeller University) in Manhattan. There he began his research on classifying viruses which later became one of his most important legacies.. In 1952, Casals joined the Rockefeller Foundation, where he worked on analysis of samples collected in the field. His collection of viral disease agents gathered during this period was the germ of the future reference collection at the World Health Organization. In 1964, the Rockefeller Foundation moved its insect-borne disease group to Yale University, and Casals became an epidemiologist there. In 1969 while investigating Lassa virus, he became deathly ill and barely survived; a technician fell ill several months later and died. Casals went on to investigate the Lassa outbreaks in West Africa. In 1973, biologists in Sierra Leone, with the help of teams from Yale and the CDC, determined that the Lassa virus was being passed to humans from wild rats. Casals also continued his sample collection, collaborating with the CDC to establish what eventually became the World Health Organization's reference collection of arboviruses. Casals left Yale in 1981 for Mount Sinai School of Medicine. His last paper was published in 1998 and remained there until his death. Casals collaborated with many institutions during his career, such as the WHO, the United States National Institute of Mental Health, and was elected to many U.S. and international societies. He worked with hundreds of scientists worldwide during his career, and was known for his scientific accuracy and professional ethics.  Lassa research and incidents  Discovery = In January 1969, missionary nurse Laura Wine fell ill with a mysterious disease she contracted from an obstetrical patient in the Lassa Mission Hospital where she worked in Lassa, Nigeria a village in Borno State. She was then airlifted to a better-equipped hospital Jos, Nigeria where she died the next day. Subsequently, two other nurses at the Jos hospital became infected, Charlotte Shaw, who died, and fifty-two-year-old nurse Lily Pinneo who had cared for Wine. Pinneo was flown to New York, along with tissues from other patients and victims, and treated for nine weeks at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, and survived. A specialist in tropical diseases at the Columbia Presbyterian provided samples from Pinneo to the Yale Arbovirus Research Unit. While at Yale, Casals and his team studied new viruses from Africa, and he identified an unknown virus in the blood of three American nurses who had been missionaries in Nigeria, in the village of Lassa in the Borno State in the northeastern part of the country. The newly isolated virus was named after the village. = Incidents = In June 1969, three months after Lassa fever reached Yale University, Casals fell ill with a fever and cold-like symptoms, with chills and severe muscle pain. On June 15, he was placed in an isolation unit. He had been tested for Lassa, but the results wouldn't be known for four days, and it was uncertain that he would survive that long. The decision was made for him to be inoculated with antibodies from nurse Lily Pinneo (convalescing at home in Rochester, New York), a decision researchers made according to Robert W. McCollum, chief of epidemiology. Casals recovered, and resumed his research. In December 1969, a technician at the laboratory was admitted to a hospital in Pennsylvania where he was visiting his family, with a fever of and in acute distress. Antibiotics and other courses of treatment were prescribed, but he died five days later. A blood test confirmed the presence of Lassa virus. Although he worked at the Yale Arbovirus Research Unit where researchers were investigating the Lassa virus, he did not work in the actual facility where the virus was present, and he had no known contact with the virus. After his death, forty-one hospital personnel who had been in contact with him and seven family members were put under intense surveillance for two weeks in Pennsylvania, and in Puerto Rico where he was buried, but all managed to escape the infection. Casals confirmed that Ramon had succumbed to Lassa Fever. This chilling information caused the group investigating the live virus to stop their investigation, and all samples were sent to a maximum security laboratory at the Center for Disease Control (CDC).  Biosafety  Although Casals and his coworkers recognized the dangerous nature of Lassa virus, and had implemented special safety protocols, Casals contracted Lassa fever in June 1969 nevertheless, and nearly died from it. A few months later, technician Juan Roman became ill and died, even though he never worked directly in the laboratory or dealt with the virus. It was never determined how the two of them contracted the virus, although one theory was dust kicked up by lab mice. The chilling effect of this caused the laboratory to halt work on the virus, and transfer the samples to the CDC maximum-security lab. According to Dr. Gregory Tignor, a retired Yale professor who worked with Dr. Casals, \\"It took great courage to work with viruses in those days because every worker knew that his or her life was in danger.\\" The events at the Yale laboratory had a major impact in the handling of dangerous viruses. Yale biological safety officer Ben Fontes gave credit to the \\"extremely careful\\" protocols Casals had designed for preventing a more serious outbreak, and said that \\"The incident forced changes to biosafety nationally, and was one of the seminal events in [bringing about modern] biosafety. Following the incidents at the Yale lab and other labs nationally, a classification system was developed to label the danger level of handling different viruses or other biological agents. As a result, pathogens like Lassa and unidentified new ones were sent to the most secure facilities.  Viral taxonomy  Casals helped identify and classify a thousand viruses. Lassa is one of many he discovered. He is considered an authority on viral taxonomy because of his landmark classification of pathogenic viruses, especially mosquito- and other insect- borne viruses, among which is the Zika virus. He also was the first to establish the fact that some viruses that cause infections in the same organ, such as polio, encephalitis, or rabies viruses in the central nervous system, are not from the same family but belong to different families.

The Kasbah of Marrakesh is a large walled district in the southern part of the medina of Marrakesh, Morocco, which historically served as the citadel (kasbah) and royal palace complex (Dar al-Makhzen) of the city. A large part of the district is still occupied by the official royal palace which serves as the residence of the King of Morocco when visiting the city, while the rest is occupied by other neighbourhoods and monuments.  History  Kasbah Mosque, built by the Almohad caliph Ya'qub al-Mansur in 1185‚Äì1190.alt=left alt= = The Almohad kasbah = The first citadel and royal residence of Marrakesh was the fortress and residence known as the Ksar el-Hajjar built by the Almoravid leader Abu Bakr ibn Umar when he founded the city in 1070. This fortress was located just north of the current Kutubiyya Mosque. The later Almoravid emir Ali ibn Yusuf (ruled 1106-1143) attached a palace to the south, on the site of what is now the mosque. Remains of these Almoravid structures have been excavated and the remains of a stone gate called Bab 'Ali, belonging to Ali's palace, are still visible today alongside the ruins of the first Kutubiyya Mosque. When the Almohad ruler Abd al-Mu'min conquered Marrakesh in 1147, he reportedly destroyed many Almoravid monuments (especially mosques) but the Ksar el-Hajjar and the palace of Ali ibn Yusuf were still used as the official residence of the new Almohad rulers for a time. The Almohad caliph Ya'qub al-Mansur (ruled 1184-1199), however, embarked on an ambitious construction project to create a vast new royal district attached to the south side of the city. This new citadel and extension of the city was known in historical sources as the Kasbah (or Qasaba), as well as Tamurakusht and al-Saliha. The construction of the kasbah was motivated in part by the rapid growth of the city's population and an urgent need for more space within the city. However it may also have been motivated by the Almohad caliph's desire to follow the example of other powerful Islamic rulers who built separate palace-cities from which to rule, such as the Umayyad construction of Madinat al-Zahra near Cordoba or the Abbasid construction of Samarra in Iraq. Construction of the Marrakesh kasbah began in 1185 and finished by 1190, though al-Mansur's successors continued to build more palaces until there were a total of twelve by the end of the Almohad period. Remains of an inner wall of the kasbah near the former gate of Bab al-Tubul, on the south side of Place Moulay al-Yazid (the square in front of the Kasbah Mosque). The Almohad kasbah was a vast self-contained district surrounded by ramparts and further subdivided by other walls within. It included not only the royal palace (known as the Dar al-Khalifa or Qasr al- Khilafa), but also its own great mosque (the Kasbah Mosque), its own markets and qaysariyya (bazaar), a madrasa, bathhouses (hammams), warehouses, stables, cemeteries, gardens, and squares. The expansion of the city also included the foundation of a hospital (maristan), though the location of this establishment (now disappeared) is unclear. The main public entrance to the kasbah was Bab Agnaou, located in the kasbah's northwestern corner and accessed from inside the city walls. Despite some modifications, it is still well-preserved today and features extensive stone-carved decoration. Another gate, Bab as-Sadat, allowed direct entrance into the kasbah from outside the city walls but was reserved for high officials and members of the royal dynasty. The Almohads also established vast pleasure gardens around the kasbah, such as the Agdal Gardens to the south which were surrounded by their own walls. A gate known as Bab al-Bustan allowed direct access between the caliph's palace and the gardens. The kasbah was divided into three parts by inner walls which each had their own gates. The largest section were the caliph's palaces, covering about 24 hectares and occupying the whole eastern side of the kasbah. The second division was in the southwest corner, taking up about 12 hectares, and contained the various services required by the palace and government. Notably, this district was centered around a large square or plaza known as the asaraq and which was the early equivalent of a mechouar. The third section, more publicly accessible, occupied 8 hectares in the northwestern corner of the kasbah and contained the Kasbah Mosque and its annexes, as well as another square in front of the mosque. This square was also known as the asaraq, but was smaller than the other one in the district to the south. A main street ran in a straight line from north to south and connected the two squares; though the larger asaraq has since disappeared. The street, which still exists today in the fabric of the neighbourhood, was lined with porticos and accessed at either end by two gates known as Bab at-Tubul (to the north) and Bab as- Saqa'if (to the south). Aside from the mosque and the main gate of Bab Agnaou, almost none of the Almohad structures have survived intact to this day. The current western and southern outline of the kasbah today, including its walls, most likely still date back essentially to the Almohad construction, but many other ramparts and gates have been changed since. = The Saadian period = Badi Palace today. It was built between 1578 and 1593 by the Saadian Sultan Ahmad al-Mansur.alt=left Following the demise of the Almohad regime, Marrakesh as a whole fell into decline as the following Marinid dynasty made Fes their capital and carried out few major constructions in the city. It wasn't until the Saadian Dynasty (16th century to early 17th century) established Marrakesh as their capital that the city and its kasbah saw a resurgence. The Saadians established themselves in the old Almohad kasbah and undertook their own renovations and reconstructions. Sultan Moulay Abdallah al-Ghalib constructed new palaces and annexes in the northern part of the kasbah and repaired the Kasbah Mosque after it was damaged in a gunpowder explosion in the 1560s or 1570s. He also began the Saadian Tombs on the south side of the mosque. Finally, it was he who transferred the Jewish population of the city to a new Mellah on the east side of the Royal Palace, thus expanding the eastern outline of the kasbah. The Jewish Cemetery of the Mellah Sultan Ahmad al-Mansur, who oversaw the apogee of Saadian power, undertook another series of constructions and renovations. He built the most elaborate mausoleums in the Saadian Tombs and, most of all, constructed a superlative palace known as El Badi. The palace was used for the reception of ambassadors and other guests and was designed as a showcase of al-Mansur's power and wealth, making use of the most lavish materials and decoration, such as imported Italian marble. The Saadian palace complex of this period was entered via a \\"Grand Mechouar\\", a vast ceremonial square or courtyard on the site of the former asaraq square, to the south of the Kasbah Mosque. The main gate of the royal palace was situated here and led to a smaller mechouar from which a long passage ran east to give access to the palace's various components. On the south side of this passage were most of the functional annexes of the palace, including kitchens, warehouses, the treasury, and stables. On the north side of the passage was the vast reception palace (the El Badi Palace), along with the private quarters of the sultan and his family, their bathhouses (hammams), a private mosque, and the mint. Finally, beyond these structures, occupying the whole eastern side of the kasbah, were a number of pleasure gardens. These included the Crystal Garden (az-zujaj), the royal garden known as al-Mustaha (\\"the Desired\\") with a grand water basin, and the Qasr Garden or inner garden for al-Mansur's private quarters. Ahmad al-Mansur also renovated the vast Agdal Gardens to the south of the kasbah. Lastly, sources from this period also describe and illustrate a tall tower rising out of the middle of the palaces and visible from afar. This tower is of uncertain origin and later disappeared during the Alaouite era, but may have been an observation tower built for the enjoyment of the sultan. An illustration of the Kasbah of Marrakech by Adriaen Matham, from 1640 (at the end of the Saadian period). Seen here probably from the east, the image shows the ramparts as well as a tall tower that once stood in the palace. = Alaouite period to present = Badi Palace. After the decline of the Saadian dynasty the kasbah was severely neglected in turn, as the Alaouite dynasty that followed them rarely used Marrakesh as their capital. Moulay Isma'il, in particular, plundered the Saadian palaces for materials (such as marble) to use in his own palace and kasbah that he was building in Meknes. The Badi Palace became a ruin, though the Saadian Tombs were still used as royal necropolis for some members of the Alaouite royal family. There were notable exceptions to this relative neglect such as the reign of Moulay Muhammad ibn Abdallah, who ruled Marrakesh as governor for his father from 1746 and then used it as his unofficial capital as sultan between 1757 and 1790. He undertook new construction of palaces and gardens, as well as building a new mosque, the Barrima Mosque. He also expanded or developed the Kasbah on its south side, creating a number of new mechouars (walled squares) as part of the approach to the royal palace, whose entrance was now reoriented to the south (as opposed to the west, as it was in Almohad and Saadian times). Up to the late 19th century and early 20th century, the kasbah was still the center of power in Marrakesh and wealthy government ministers also built their own palaces and mansions near it. The most famous of these is Bahia Palace, later turned into a royal palace. The Agdal Gardens were also maintained and occasionally replanted, with new royal pavilions constructed within them and even new fortifications constructed on their west side.  Geography  300x300px Today, the kasbah is no longer a closed district and much of it is accessible to the public. Its western sections are filled with residential structures. Most of its eastern section, however, is still being used as the Royal Palace for the King of Morocco and is off-limits to the public. The royal palace grounds, much modified under the Alaouite dynasty, contain vast gardens and plazas. At their northern end, however, the remains of the monumental El Badi Palace, built by the Saadian sultan Ahmad al-Mansour and subsequently ruined, are now a historic site accessible to tourists. In the northwest area of the kasbah is the citadel's original main mosque, the Kasbah Mosque (also known as the Mansuriyya Mosque and the Mosque of Moulay al- Yazid), still active today and accessible only to Muslims. Just west of the mosque, at the junction between the main city's walls and the outer walls of the kasbah, is the former main public gate of the kasbah, Bab Agnaou, built under the Almohad ruler Yaqub al-Mansur. Near the kasbah, to the north, past Place des Ferblantiers, is also the Bahia Palace. The kasbah is flanked to the east by the former Jewish district of the city, the Mellah, and to the west by largely open ground. At the southern end of the kasbah and of the city stretch out the vast Agdal Gardens, which are enclosed in their own set of walls connecting with the walls of the kasbah.

The CTS Observatory of the Organization of Ibero-American States has stated that Carlos Mallmann was ‚Äúone of the protagonists in the history of science and technology in Argentina and Latin America (...) He embodied the concepts, values, vocation and was an example of a true guardian of Argentine and Latin American science‚Äù.  Biography  Carlos Alberto Mallmann was born on December 24, 1928 in the Buenos Aires, the son of Arturo Jos√© Mallmann and Elsa Dreher. In 1954 he obtained his doctorate in Physics-Mathematics at the University of Buenos Aires, with his thesis of \\"Kofoed-Hansen Type Beta Spectroscopes: Electronic Optics\\". He then completed postgraduate studies in the Netherlands with the support of the National Atomic Energy Commission (CNEA) and also at the Argonne National Laboratory of the United States Atomic Commission ( Chicago, United States) where he was able to share the results of his research for the Nobel Prize in Physics, with Niels Bohr, who was doing a work stay in the same laboratory (1958). From 1958 to 1961 he was Director of Research for the CNEA, and from 1962 to 1966 Director of the Bariloche Atomic Center and the Balseiro Institute in Argentina. In turn, he was professor of the Physics Department of the Faculty of Exact and Natural Sciences of the University of Buenos Aires and of the National University of Cuyo, and made important contributions in low energy nuclear physics. In 1962 he was appointed Director of the Centro At√≥mico Bariloche and the Instituto Balseiro, carrying out pioneering studies of physics and nuclear energy in Argentina. In 1963, the Bariloche Foundation was inspired by his proposals to address the promotion and transversal development of the arts and sciences, with a focus on Human development. The Foundation was created with six departments: Biology, Social Sciences, Mathematics, Natural Resources and Energy, Extension and services, and music. The Camerata Bariloche symbolizes the artistic milestone of the Foundation. Between 1967 and 1985 he was the executive president of the Foundation, and during that time he was between 1973 and 1984 Program Director of the United Nations University in Tokyo, and between 1972 and 1985 of the Wissenschaft Zentrum in Berlin. He considered art and science as two sides of the same coin: creativity. During his years at the Bariloche Foundation, he began doing research in the field of science and technology policy, studies of quality of life, system of needs, human development, alternative models of development, and long-term societal dynamics. He has been a key figure of thought to start the realization of the Latin American World Model, who presented his results in 1975, proposing an international alternative to the neo-Malthusian model of The Limits to Growth through world development, and solidarity between countries. The model was pioneer, and contributed to the understanding of the concept of unmet basic needs, which was later adopted by the United Nations as a main criterion of evaluation of human development.

Early life and career Woodward was the eldest son of a tallow chandler in the borough of Southwark, London, and intended for his father's occupation. He attended Merchant Taylors' school from 1724 to 1728. After his father's failure in business, Woodward joined the troupe of John Rich, whose stage name was \\"Lun\\", at Lincoln's Inn Fields, playing in January 1729 in The Beggar's Opera as the Beggar and Ben Budge. During the season the performance was repeated fifteen times, and Woodward, thoroughly stage-struck, remained with Rich, who instructed him in harlequin and other characters. From October 1730 he appeared at Goodman's Fields Theatre, where he remained until 1736. After the company moved to Lincoln's Inn Fields, Woodward appeared in January 1737 as Harlequin Macheath in The Beggars' Pantomime, or the Contending Columbines. The authorship of this is ascribed to \\"Lun junior\\", i.e. Woodward, who dedicated to Kitty Clive and Susannah Maria Cibber the printed version of 1736. Drury Lane and Dublin Henry Woodward as Fine Gentleman in David Garrick's farce Lethe. Bow porcelain factory figure, 1750. \\"Henry Woodward\\" V & A. Retrieved 15 May 2020. In 1737, at the end of the season, the theatre was closed, and Woodward went to Drury Lane, appearing in January 1738 as Feeble in Henry IV Part 2. He remained at Drury Lane until 1747, playing many parts in comedy, and adding to his repertory some fifty characters. Engaged by Thomas Sheridan for Smock Alley Theatre, Dublin, Woodward made his first appearance there in September 1747 as Marplot in Susanna Centlivre's The Busie Body. As Marplot he came out again in September 1748 at Drury Lane. He repeated some of his Dublin successes, and gave in March 1749 his own unprinted interlude, Tit for Tat. Between 1751 and 1756 Woodward produced and probably acted in several unprinted pantomimes of his own. These all displayed gifts of construction and invention, and were highly popular. Some of them had previously been seen in Dublin. Marplot in Lisbon was produced at Drury Lane in March 1754. It was a compression, with some slight alterations by Woodward, of Susanna Centlivre's Marplot, a continuation of The Busie Body, and was seen again in Dublin and at Covent Garden. At Drury Lane he remained until 1758. At the end of the season of 1757‚Äì58 Woodward finally severed his connection with Drury Lane. His last engagement had been prodigal of interest and incident. He was David Garrick's right-hand man, and divided with him the empire over comedy. His Mercutio, when Garrick and Barry in Romeo and Juliet divided the town, had been an unsurpassable triumph. Arthur Murphy said, concerning the performance, that \\"no actor ever reached the vivacity of Woodward\\". His performance of Bobadill in Ben Jonson's Every Man in His Humour was pronounced \\"wonderful\\" by Tate Wilkinson. Crow Street Theatre, Dublin Woodward's inducement to leave Drury Lane had been a tempting but, as it proved, delusive, offer from Spranger Barry. Barry had counted on the support of Charles Macklin in opening a new theatre in Dublin. Macklin proving recalcitrant, he turned to Woodward, who had saved ¬£6,000, and Woodward, after some hesitation, entered on the scheme at the persuasion of Barry, whom Rich declared capable of \\"wheedling a bird from the tree and squeezing it to death in his hand\\". In October 1758 Crow Street Theatre, built by subscription, was opened under the new management, Woodward speaking a prologue but not acting. In January 1760 Samuel Foote's The Minor was produced. The Dublin management was not a success, and by 1762 Woodward had lost half his savings. In this year the joint-managers, who in 1761 had opened a new theatre in Cork, quarrelled, recriminated, and dissolved partnership, Woodward returning to London. Covent Garden On reappearing in London at Covent Garden in Marplot, in October 1763, Woodward, who had spoken in Dublin many prologues of his own writing, delivered one entitled \\"The Prodigal's Return\\"; this occasioned a vexatious charge of \\"ingratitude\\" when in 1764 he revisited Dublin. At Covent Garden he played some of the parts in which he had been seen in Ireland. In November 1770, as Marplot in The Busie Body he made under Samuel Foote his first appearance in Edinburgh, playing a round of characters. On his homeward journey he acted under Tate Wilkinson in York. Still under Foote, he was on 26 June 1771 at the Haymarket the first Sir Christopher Cripple in Foote's The Maid of Bath. Back at Covent Garden, where he remained, he was the first Tardy in An Hour before Marriage, in January 1772. He was also seen as Jodelet in his alteration of William Davenant's The Man's the Master. in November 1773. Woodward's last appearance was in January 1777, when he played Stephano in The Tempest. On 17 April he died at his house, Chapel Street, Grosvenor Place, and was buried in the vaults of St George's, Hanover Square. Mrs Woodward predeceased her husband, and Woodward spent the last ten years of his life with George Anne Bellamy. To her he left the bulk of his estate, which, however, she never succeeded in obtaining. Commentary John Joseph Knight wrote: \\"Woodward has had few equals in comedy. His figure was admirably formed and his expression so composed that he seemed qualified rather for tragedy or fine gentlemen than the brisk fops and pert coxcombs he ordinarily played. He was unable, however, to speak a serious line with effect, but so soon as he had to charge his face with levity, and to display simulated consequence, brisk impertinence, or affected gaiety, he was the most engaging, consequential, and laughable of actors.... He received the highest terms of any comic actor of the day. His claims to rank as a dramatist, except as regards his pantomimes, are trivial, his work containing next to nothing original.\\" References Attribution * Category:1714 births Category:1777 deaths Category:People from Southwark Category:People educated at Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood Category:18th-century English male actors ","title":"Henry Woodward (English actor)"},{"id":"63992630","text":"The mosque The Mosque of Omar Ibn al-Khattab () is a historic mosque in Dumat al-Jandal in northern Saudi Arabia, located adjacent to the Marid Castle. It one of the oldest mosques in the north of the Arabian Peninsula and is considered one of the important monuments in Al-Jawf and in Saudi Arabia in general. The mosque's architechure represents continuity of the pattern of the design of the first mosques, in particular the design of Prophet‚Äôs Mosque in Madina in its early stages.  Founding  The mosque is attributed to the caliph Umar ibn Al-Khattab, it is said that it was built by him in the year 16 AH while he was heading to Jerusalem.  Location  Omar Bin Al-Khattab Mosque is located in the center of the ancient town of Dumat Al-Jandal, next to the Marid Castle, adjacent to the Aldara‚Äôa neighborhood from the southern side. The town belongs to the Al-Jouf region in the north of Saudi Arabia.  Design  The importance of the Mosque of Omar Ibn al - Khattab is in its design because it represents a continuation of the pattern of the first mosques design in Islam. It reminds of the design of the Prophet mosque in Medina in its early stages. The shape of Omar‚Äôs mosque is almost rectangular and built of carved stone, and extends from west to east 32.5 meter of length and 18 meters wide. The mosque consists of the corridor of the qiblah, the mihrab, the minbar, the courtyard of the mosque and the prayarea. The mosque is known for its magnificent minaret that has 12.7 meter of height, and a square shape base and its walls start tilting inward as it goes up to form at the end a distinct pyramidal shape. The minaret is divided into four floors built on the roof of the corridor that leads to the external road, and entry to the minaret was through climbing to the ceiling of the mosque then to the first floor of it. The upper floors were connected to each other by a stone staircase, but some parts of it have collapsed, which made the climb to the minaret impossible now. The back of the mosque is a sanctum called for the place of prayer in the winter during the intense cold. The backpacker Wallin who visited the area more than 163 years ago stated: \\"The Saudi princes in the first Saudi state rebuilt the mosque on The same location‚Äù, and he continues his saying about the minaret of during his visit to the region in 1261 AH: ‚ÄúIt is the only minaret in the old Domat Al-Jandal.\\" And it was covered with stems of palm trees. It is said that Omar ordered the construction of the mosque, and then after that it was renewed with some additions. The minaret is such an old one, and no one at the present time can climb in it for fear of falling.  The minaret The famous minaret of the mosque is located in the southwestern corner and deviates from the level of the qibla wall. It is the first minaret built in the Islamic era, and it was built of stone with a height of 12.7 meters and a square base that its length is 3 meters. It narrows inward as it rises to form a semi-conical shape. The minaret has windows on each floor and the mosque has been recently restored. The Finnish backpacker has mentioned that the mosque‚Äôs market is where the Friday pray‚Äôs sermon is delivered.  Restoration  The restoration processes included all parts of the mosque, such as rebuilding the destroyed walls, restoring the entire roof, cleaning the floors and paving it by stones, filling the spaces between the stones, restoring the mosque's sanctum and repairing its doors.

One of the first charitable institutions in the Russian Empire. In 1820, it was renamed the Acceptable House. The buildings of the almshouse are an object of cultural heritage of federal significance. Current address: Moscow, Novaya Basmannaya, 4. History Prince Boris Ivanovich Kurakin (1676‚Äì1727), who had been the Russian ambassador in Paris since 1724, was so impressed with the House of Disabled People that he decided to create a similar charitable institution in Moscow. He failed to realize his idea in life. He bequeathed to his son Alexander to build \\"a spital for the charity of honored warriors who did not have a livelihood\\" and a church in honor of the icon of Nikolai Ugodnik. In 1731, Empress Anna Ioannovna, by her decree, donated to Prince Alexander Kurakin a land tenure in the Basmannaya Sloboda 50 meters long, 40 fathoms wide for the construction of a spital (hospital). The Empress's generous gift was due not only to respect for the merits of Boris Ivanovich Kurakin and his good intentions, but also to his interest in developing the territory of the Basmannaya Sloboda. Construction lasted more than 10 years. In 1742, the grand opening of the church and the spital took place, at which the new Empress Elizabeth Petrovna was already present. Spital was the first private charitable institution in Russia. The name of the author of the architectural project has not reached our days. As Boris Kurakin bequeathed, the complex was built \\"with good architecture\\", \\"with all beauty\\" and \\"according to foreign custom\\". There is an assumption that the project was developed by Parisian architects. Initially, the hospital building was one- story and had a U-shape. This architectural monument belongs to the style of \\"Anninsky Baroque\\". The spiritual book of Boris Kurakin contained a detailed regulation of the spital, which his descendants followed. The hospital accommodated only twelve patients and was intended for former officers who were injured. Each of them was allocated a furnished room. In the closets hung clothes for all seasons. Meat and poultry were served at the table on short days, and fish was served on fasting. Former warriors relied on wine every day and honey on holidays. Behind the house was a garden for walking. Residents had to adhere to only two basic rules ‚Äì to spend the night in a hospital and attend services in the temple. In the center of the ensemble was the church of Nikolai Ugodnik, connected to the premises of the hospital (demolished in Soviet times). According to one of the researchers, the temple had common architectural features with the famous church of San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane in Rome ‚Äì the creation of the famous Italian architect Francesco Borromini. The main facade of the temple with its curvature resembled an altar apse, but was facing north and served as a narthex. The facade was decorated with a portico facing the gate. The \\"simplified version\\" of the church of Nikolai Ugodnik has survived ‚Äì a church in the Kurakin Eldigino estate near Moscow. In the 1790s, the ensemble was replenished with a two-story manor built for his family by the great-grandson of Boris Ivanovich Kurakin ‚Äì Stepan Borisovich. In 1802, two service buildings were completed. In 1820, the \\"spital\\" was renamed the Hospice. During the holidays in honor of Nikolai Ugodnik, up to five hundred beggars were fed here for free. Later, feeding at the temple began to be replaced by the issuance of free tickets to folk canteens. During the Patriotic War of 1812, Napoleon arranged an infirmary for the French wounded in the Hospice House, and in the church of Nikolai Ugodnik he founded a stable. After the enemy was expelled from Moscow, Alexey Borisovich Kurakin (the younger brother of Stepan Borisovich) restored the church. The last trustee of the church and the Hospice was the great-grandson of Alexei Borisovich ‚Äì Fedor Alekseevich Kurakin. In 1902, he reconstructed the main building ‚Äì strengthened the foundation, built on the second floor, and widened the window openings so that the rooms became lighter and more comfortable. At the same time, the building lost its baroque features and was decorated in the spirit of neoclassicism. Then Mikhail Shutsman designed a new street fence. Soviet time After the Revolution of 1917, the almshouse was closed. In 1935, the church of Nikolai Ugodnik was demolished, other premises of the Odd House were used for housing until the 1980s. After the resettlement of communal apartments, the building stood abandoned for almost 20 years. Contemporary time In 1998, by decree of Yury Luzhkov, a state institution, the Moscow House of Nationalities, was created in the building of the former Hospice House. In 1999‚Äì2003, the reconstruction of the former Hospice House was carried out, thanks to which it was possible to recreate the appearance of the building, which it had in the 18th century. During the work, the masonry was renovated, vaulted ceilings were strengthened, destroyed columns made of white stone were restored, window openings were shifted, and stairs were restored. The fence with openwork gates found its former splendor. The interior and engineering systems were brought into line with the requirements of the time and the new tasks of the building. Today, concerts, music and art festivals, conferences and forums are held here, and national holidays are celebrated. ReferencesSources *Belozyorova T. A., Lazarev A. V., Solovyova Yu. N.

As an inventor, he has at least 89 patents to his name. Georgiev was born and raised in Bulgaria and went on to study quantum physics in the United States, where he received his doctoral degree in 1996. In the early 2000s, Georgiev created the Healing Brush, Photoshop's healing tool also known as Poisson image editing. The Healing Brush gives users the ability to correct an image's flaws by incorporating the texture, lighting, transparency, and shading of sampled pixels to the pixels being healed. The tool shipped with Photoshop 7.0 in 2002. Todor has also worked on a variety of Photoshop's tools including Match Color, Content Aware Scaling, and Content Aware Fill. In 2007, Georgiev developed the ‚Äúplenoptic light field‚Äù lens which attaches to a typical digital camera and captures several images at once, allowing you to refocus photos after they have been shot. One prototype has 19 lenses, each with a prism at a unique angle that allows the photographer to capture 19 pictures at once, each one capturing a different part of the scene in focus. Adobe software can then analyze the images, allowing for digital 3D photo editing. Georgiev was one of the first to incorporate plenoptics into modern software.

At the very least, one-third of the more than 9,250 vascular plant species native to the country are endemic. There are, however, no plant families endemic to the country. The families of gingers, begonias, gesneriads, orchids, pandans, palms, and dipterocarps are particularly high in endemic species. For example, two-thirds of the 150 species of palms present in the country are found nowhere else in the world. 700 of the 1,000 species of orchids found in the Philippines are unique to its wildlife. The broad lowland and hill rain forests of the Philippines, which are mostly gone today, were dominated by at least 45 species of dipterocarps. These massive trees were abundant to up to 1,000 meters above sea level.

More is a scholar of Sant Sahitya (saint literature) and is an authority on Sant Tukaram. He is currently serving as Head of the Philosophy Department at Savitribai Phule University, Pune, Maharashtra. He is a tenth-generation descendant of Sant Tukaram. More has authored and edited many books on saints and social issues. He received many awards for his literary works, such as the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1998 for his book Tukaram Darshan. More is considered a thinker who enriched the cultural heritage of Tukaram Maharaj through his multidisciplinary endeavors. Apart from his scholarly work specializing in reception on Tukaram, More is a career awardee from University Grants Commission (UGC), has written a doctoral dissertation titled Krsna: The Man and his Mission during 1986‚Äì89. He also wrote a two-volume Marathi book titled Lokamanya te Mahatma, which was translated into English by Abhay Datar. Historian Ramchandra Guha wrote the foreword, where he describes More's work as \\"... a colossal work of scholarship, at once very deep and extremely wide\\". Similarly in \\"Patriots and Partisans\\" authored by Guha, because of More's vast literary works, he describes him as a cult figure in Maharashtra and compares him to Partha Chaterjee of English writing. More also wrote some plays. While researching figures like Lokamanya and Gandhi, he learned more about theatre, and since childhood he was motivated by actor/singer Bal Gandharva. He went on to write a play on Bal Gandharva and his love life with Gauharbai, a classical singer from Karnataka. On December 10, 2014, More was elected the 88th president of ABMSS (Akila Bharatha Mahila Seva Samaja). He currently serves as a member of General Council and Advisory board on Marathi language at Sahitya Akademi. Politics When asked about the current caste politics in Maharashtra during an interview with Sakal Times, More responded by saying that instead of coining new terms, \\"we must realize that we are all ultimately concerned with our respective livelihoods, and we have figured that caste is a strong tool to further our economic gains and that‚Äôs at the root of it.\\" Similarly when asked about communism, his quick response was: \\"An experiment with Communism has failed in India and world over\\", but he asserted that it could come up with a new experiment in the future. In November 2013, he received threatening phone calls after making statements on Vallabhbhai Patel and BJP‚Äôs PM-designate Narendra Modi. He was provided with police protection following this incident. Earlier in 2013, More criticized NCERT, an apex body responsible for improving school education in India, for not providing adequate information on Maratha Ruler Chatrapati Shivaji in class VII textbooks and publishing a \\"derogatory\\" cartoon in class IX book. More said NCERT has only glorified Muslim rulers of the past and has not provided enough space to Shivaji.

David Petraeus (center) in July 2010. Munir Mohamad Mangal (1950 ‚Äì May 2, 2020) was an Afghan general whose professional military career spanned more than 40 years. Mangal served in high-level military and government positions, most latterly as the Commander of the Afghan National Police, before his retirement in 2016. Biography Mangal was born in Samkanay District, Paktia Province, Afghanistan, in 1950. He was sent to Kabul, where he attended primary and military school. Mangal then went to the Soviet Union, where he completed a master's degree in military affairs. In 1972, Mangal began his professional military career as a lieutenant in a Kabul-based artillery division. He rose to serve in both military positions under several Afghan governments over the course of his four decades as an officer in the Afghan Armed Forces, especially during the American-backed governments in the 2000s. Following the 2001 United States invasion of Afghanistan and the overthrow of the Taliban, Mangal helped to form the new Afghan National Army and served as a Corps Commander. He also became Deputy Minister of Interior for security. Most recently, General Mangal was appointed Commander of the Afghan National Police. He was noted for careful planning in order to keep casualties with the National Police as low as possible. In one instance, Mangal and his colleague, General Ghulam Mujtaba Patang, were traveling in helicopter from Kandahar to Kabul over portion of Ghazni province that was controlled by the Taliban, when the aircraft malfunctioned and began to lose stability and altitude. The pilot asked if they should land in a Taliban-controlled area, but Mangal refused and ordered him to continue flying to Kabul, despite the risk of a crash, saying, \\"It's better to die in a crash than be taken hostage by the Taliban,\\" according to Patang. Mangal retired from the National Police in 2016. General Munir Mangal died from COVID-19 at his home in Kabul on May 2, 2020, at the age of 70. He is the highest-profile victim of the COVID-19 pandemic in Afghanistan to date, as well as the second member of his immediate family to die from coronavirus during the pandemic. One of his sons, who was a doctor, also died from the virus. Mangal was survived by his wife, two daughters, four sons, and 13 grandchildren.

Members of the Delphibacteria phylum have been retroactively detected in a variety of environments.  Description  Delphibacteria is a bacterial phylum with candidate status, meaning it has no cultured representatives as of yet. It is part of the FCB group.  History  The phylum was first proposed following the recovery and analysis of two genomes, each from the mouth of a different bottlenose dolphin. These dolphins were part of the US Navy's Marine Mammal Program, although Delphibacteria 16S rRNA genes have also been detected in the mouths of wild dolphins living off the coast of Florida, U.S. The first characterized member of the Delphibacteria phylum was inferred to be a heterotrophic organism with the genomic potential for oxygen and most likely nitrate reduction. It was hypothesized that the ability to perform denitrification may have an impact on dolphin physiology and health, given that in humans denitrification by oral bacteria can affect oral and gastric blood flow, signalling in bacteria-bacteria and bacteria-host interactions, and mucus thickness in the stomach. The name \\"Dephibacteria\\" was proposed in recognition of the first genomic representatives having been recovered from the dolphin mouth (Family Delphinidae) and due to its ubiquity in dolphin mouths. Members of the Delphibacteria phylum have been detected (retroactively) in a variety of environments, including bottom water from the Northern Bering Sea (EU734960.1), marine sediment from the Logatchec hydrothermal vent (FN554086.1), and deep sea sediment from the Okinawa Trough (KX097792.1).

It would be the last season of soccer prior to what be a three year hiatus of soccer due to World War I in which approximately ninety percent of registered players were enlisted in the Australian Defence Force prior to the 1916 season, with at least forty percent of the players registering in April during the season. Two leagues were contested, being 'Victorian Division 1' and 'Victorian Division 2' that is now (as of 2020 season) recognized as the NPL & NPL 2 respectively. The calendar season also saw the seventh tournament of the Dockerty Cup, in which Melbourne Thistle were crowned winners. Overview There was no relegation at the conclusion of the 1914 season, with three more clubs joining the newly reformed first division that had been split into two sections (conferences). The three debutante clubs consisted of Sandringham who had been promoted from division two, along with the reformed Footscray Thistle, and temporary military sporting team H.M.A.S. Cerberus. Section A consisted of six teams, whereas Section B consisted of seven. A finals series was played between the premiers and runner's up of the two sections to determine the state champions, in which Melbourne Thistle of Section B defeated Albert Park of section A 1‚Äì0 to become champions. It is believed that the second division continued into the 1915 season but not in a section form, but of a single league form. As of May 2020, the official table is incomplete, however it is known that at least four clubs competed in what is now known as the National Premier Leagues Victoria 2. These clubs consisted of the 1914 runner's up Hawthorn, along with debutante clubs Brunswick, Cambrian United, and Windsor.

More than 400 senior politicians and business executives, as well as high-ranking military officials and security experts from 90 countries attended the event. This included over 90 delegations, a dozen heads of state, 70 foreign and defence ministers, ten US senators, five EU Commissioners, five German federal ministers and 60 members of the German Bundestag and an equal number of CEOs. Some 700 journalists were accredited for the event. The conference focused on the European debt crisis, transatlantic relations, the crisis regions of Mali and the Middle East, as well as energy security and cyber-terrorism.  Opening speech  Federal Defence Minister Thomas de Maizi√®re in his opening speech emphasized the role of the United States as a guarantor of European security. De Maizi√®re stated that Europe \\"might not be the best conceivable partner of the US but the best possible\\". He also called for better cooperation in the defence realm both within the EU as well as between EU and NATO.  European debt crisis  The Euro crisis and the future of the European Union were the themes of the opening debate. German Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch√§uble and Deutsche Bank CEO Anshu Jain expressed their conviction that the height of the crisis was over. Sch√§uble, however, warned against reducing the rescue efforts, and criticized the continuing insufficient regulation of the banking sector. Jain described the consequences of demographic change in Europe as a serious impediment to growth and called for a liberalization of the labour market and a reform of the pension system. In the debate, Spain's Foreign Minister Jos√© Garc√≠a-Margallo y Marfil considered growth and employment as key challenges for the future of Europe. An improvement to the competitiveness of EU states was suggested by Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaitƒó.  Transatlantic relations  The second day of the conference focused on transatlantic relations. US Vice President Joe Biden provided for the first time an outlook on the future foreign policy of the recently re-elected US President Barack Obama. Speaking about the importance of Europe, Biden stated that \\"Europe is the cornerstone of our commitment to the world and a catalyst for global cooperation\\" and called Europeans the \\"oldest friends and closest allies\\" of the US. In this context he strongly pushed for the creation of a transatlantic free trade zone. Biden also announced improvements in US relations with Russia. In his speech he emphasized the importance of cooperation between the two countries, but also noted existing differences on human rights, the Syrian conflict and the European Missile Defense System. Biden urged Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step down and called on the international community to intervene in the country. However, he refused a military intervention on the part of his country. The US Vice President offered direct negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program.  Syria  Moaz al-Khatib, president of Syrian opposition, at 49th MSC Unlike Biden, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov took an opposing position in regards to Syria. He stated that his government continues to stand by the Syrian ruler Assad, and said that there would be future Russian support. Despite the differences between the US and Russia on Syria, a first meeting between Lavrov and the head of the Syrian opposition, Moaz al- Khatib, came as a surprise during the conference. Lavrov also invited al- Khatib to visit Moscow. Moaz al-Khatib offered Bashar al-Assad and his aides safe passage out of the country in exchange for their resignations. Negotiations with Iran  In the debates on the final day of the conference, Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi expressed the willingness of his country to accept the US's negotiated bid on the Iranian nuclear program, but imposed certain conditions. Salehi's announcement was taken with skepticism, due to previous statements that had remained without concrete consequences. Unexpectedly fierce criticism of the Iranian policy was displayed throughout the conference debate by the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the German Bundestag, Ruprecht Polenz, including calling Iran a \\"nuclear policy wrong way driver\\". At the security conference, outgoing Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak warned about \\"nuclear terrorism\\" and an end to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in the event that Iran gained possession of the nuclear bomb. Barak reiterated his country's determination to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.  Cyber-security  A panel discussion on cyber-security was accompanied by reports of hacker attacks against Twitter and leading American newspapers. In the course of the debate, Federal Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich presented a bill on IT security stipulating operators of critical infrastructure to report hacker attacks. Friedrich stated that cyber-security had become a key issue of the 21st century. European Commissioner Neelie Kroes also advocated the reporting of cyber attacks and referred to a future EU directive. The Commissioner stressed the responsibility of each user to contribute to the security on the internet. Deutsche Telekom CEO Rene Obermann called upon affected companies to report cyber attacks, since the disclosure of security issues contributes significantly to their resolution. Obermann stated that there were an average of 300,000 to 400,000 attacks daily on his company's networks. Further topics  Further topics of the conference included the future of the responsibility to protect, digital diplomacy in the age of social media, European defence policy as well as security and stability in Southeast Europe and the Caucasus.

Yevdokimov ended the Russian Civil War as a junior commander and served with cavalry units in Transcaucasia during the 1920s and early 1930s. He moved to infantry units in the mid-1930s and was decorated for his command of a regiment during the Winter War. Commanding the 50th Rifle Division in Belarus on the outbreak of Operation Barbarossa, he suffered a mental breakdown in early July and was replaced in command. Yevdokimov was escorted to the rear and left in a hospital; his further fate being unknown, he was officially declared missing.  Early life and Russian Civil War  Yevdokimov was born to a Russian working-class family on 12 April 1898 in Bezzubskova, from Astrakhan, and completed primary school. Drafted into the Red Army in June 1918 during the Russian Civil War, he became a Red Army man in the guard company at Yenotayevka, Astrakhan Governorate, transferring to the Astrakhan Guard Detachment in May 1919. Yevdokimov completed the Astrakhan Machine Gun Commanders' Course between August 1919 and April 1920, fighting in battles against the Armed Forces of South Russia with a detachment from the course. In December 1919 he was concussed in an action at Mikhaylovka. After finishing the course, Yevdokimov became a platoon commander in the 180th Rifle Regiment of the 32nd Rifle Division before transferring to the 105th Cavalry Regiment of the 18th Cavalry Division of the 11th Army in July. With the latter, he fought in the suppression of the Ganja revolt. In November and December Yevdokimov commanded a platoon of the 1st Armenian Infantry Regiment in the invasion of Armenia, and in February and March 1921 participated in the invasion of Georgia, back with the 105th Cavalry Regiment.  Interwar period  After the end of the war, Yevdokimov completed the Advanced Course for the Command Personnel of the Separate Red Banner Caucasus Army in Tiflis from December 1922 to June 1923, after which he was sent to the 2nd Separate Caucasian Cavalry Brigade of the army. In the following years, Yevdokimov successively served as a platoon commander in the 4th Cavalry Regiment of the brigade and as a machine gun squadron commander in its 2nd Cavalry Regiment. Having completed the Novocherkassk Cavalry Officers Improvement Course between October 1925 and September 1926, he was posted to the 65th Caucasian Cavalry Regiment of the brigade, with which he served as chief of the regimental school and as a squadron commander and commissar. Transferred to the 3rd Caucasian Rifle Division in February 1930, he served with the latter as commander and commissar of its separate cavalry squadron before becoming assistant commander for supply of the 12th Rifle Regiment of the division in June 1932. Yevdokimov was transferred to the Volga Military District in June 1934, where he commanded the separate reconnaissance battalion of the 61st Rifle Division. Having completed the Intelligence Officers Improvement Course in Moscow between December of that year and November 1935, Yevdokimov rose to command the 182nd Rifle Regiment of the 51st Rifle Division in February 1938 and then its 526th Rifle Regiment from August 1939. Appointed chief of infantry of the 173rd Motor Rifle Division in January 1940, he fought in the Winter War with the division. By then a colonel, he took command of the 490th Motor Rifle Regiment on 10 March 1940, and for \\"personal heroism\\" displayed in the fulfillment of the unit objectives Yevdokimov was awarded the Order of the Red Banner. The latter and the Jubilee Medal \\"XX Years of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army\\" were his only awards. He became a major general on 4 June when the Red Army introduced general officer ranks. In August he was appointed commander of the 50th Rifle Division, stationed in Belarus as part of the Western Special Military District.  World War II  After Operation Barbarossa began on 22 June 1941, Yevdokimov's division was moved forward from the front reserve and assigned to the 13th Army on 24 June after the German breakthrough in the Molodechno region during the Battle of Bia≈Çystok‚ÄìMinsk. By 27 June his division was tasked with holding a defensive line along the Viliya River until reserves could come up. The 50th was the only organized division left in the region north of Minsk and conducted a fighting retreat to the Berezina in the following days. At the Berezina crossings, they came under air and tank attack on 5 and 6 July, suffering heavy losses. These experiences resulted in Yevdokimov experiencing a mental breakdown, described in a letter to his widow by regimental commander Colonel Andrey Pavlyga as increasing illogicality in orders and conversations. Pavlyga continued that \\"within three or four days he [Yevdokimov] became violently insane, getting worse and worse every day.\\" He wrote that Yevdokimov accused his subordinates of treason, brandished his pistol at them, and shot at but missed division chief of staff Colonel Aleksandr Pleshkov, while also wounding a Red Army man. Pavlyga disarmed Yevdokimov and Pleshkov assumed command of the division, detailing men to watch Yevdokimov. Pavlyga's regiment, with Yevdokimov, became separated from the rest of the division in the next several days. At some point between 15 and 18 July, Yevdokimov was left in a civilian hospital at a location between Tolochin and Senno, with Pavlyga writing that the former's behavior had \\"become unmanageable\\". Yevdokimov's further fate was unknown and he was officially declared as missing in July.

Its population was estimated at about 44,000 people in 2018.  Etymology  The word Ayyat comes from the arabic word \\"ÿπŸäÿßÿ∑\\" which means he who cries. According to Coptic tradition the city was called by that name because a criminal attacked during their stay in Egypt, however baby Jesus made him paralyzed so he was forced to stay with the holy family and they fed him. However, he was forced to eat like a dog, since he couldn't move his arms or legs and that made him cry and people usually went there to see this supernatural event with their eyes. Thus, this place was called after him. After, The Holy Family left the place however, the criminal was cured.  History  The ancient village of Lisht, the capital of Pharaonic Egypt during the Middle Kingdom, is located in Al- Ayat. It was called in the Pharaonic era ‚ÄúIt-Tawy,‚Äù meaning holding on the two lands. The region is an extension of the famous archeological cemetery of Memphis, located south of the Dahshur region, 50 km south of Cairo From the south of the Meidum region the last extension of the necropolis of Memphis. It was King Amenemhat I who established this City where he built his Funerary complex consisting of the Valley Temple, the Ascending Road and the funerary temple and the pyramid named in and around it. There are tombs dedicated to the senior statesmen of his era, some of which were revealed at the beginning of the last century by an American archaeological mission. After Amenemhat I, his son Senusret I came to power, and he also established his Funerary complex in parallel to the present Saudi village. The group consisted of the Valley Temple, the Ascending Road, and a funerary temple in addition to his pyramid. The high priest Senusret Ankh. And the project that the council is currently implementing includes reducing the percentage of groundwater to ensure that it does not affect the two royal burial chambers inside the two pyramids in particular, in addition to restoration of the inscriptions of Senusert Ankh cemetery which contain hundreds of spells and texts of the pyramids, which include the dogmatic history of the Egyptian religion along with restoration of The mortuary temple of Senusert I in which a royal life-sized statue of King Senusert I was found. Among the newly discovered tombs is that the grave of \\"Het Hatab\\" and the region is still has not been excavated for more than a century. The archaeologists emphasized that the history of the middle state is still buried in this region, and they see the solutions to the existing problems, the most important of which is to reduce the level of groundwater on the two burial chambers inside the two hills, which will lead to real beginning of archaeological excavation.  Location  El Ayyat is located to the south of Giza, and it is limited to four borders to the east, the Nile River, to the west, Faiyum Governorate, to the north, the Badrashein Center, and to the south, the Al-Wasta Center of the Governorate of Beni Suef.

History  Tolls usually had to be paid at strategic locations such as bridges (sometimes called a bridge toll) or gates. In Europe, the road toll goes back to the practice of the Germanic tribes, who charged fees to travellers if they wanted to cross over mountain passages. From that time, road tolls became commonplace in medieval times, especially in the Holy Roman Empire. The Empire had a \\"passage system\\" whereby a number of toll stations would be established on a route where small tolls were collected. Examples were the Ochsenweg in Schleswig-Holstein which had toll stations at K√∂nigsau and Rendsburg, Neum√ºnster, Bramstedt and Ulzburg,Klaus-Joachim Lorenzen-Schmidt, Ortwin Pelc (ed.): Das neue Schleswig-Holstein Lexikon. Wachholtz, Neum√ºnster, 2006, Lemma Zoll. as well as the Gabler Road with the Karlsfried Castle as its toll station. Another form of road tax was Liniengeld, which had to be paid when entering the city of Vienna from the beginning of the 18th century. A special form of road toll was the Pflasterzoll, which had to be paid to fund the initial cobbling of a road and its subsequent upkeep.  Electronic collection  Electronic toll collection is a wireless system to automatically collect the usage fee or toll charged to vehicles using toll roads, HOV lanes, toll bridges, and toll tunnels. It is a faster alternative which is replacing toll booths, where vehicles must stop and the driver manually pays the toll with cash or a card. In most systems, vehicles using the system are equipped with an automated radio transponder device. When the vehicle passes a roadside toll reader device, a radio signal from the reader triggers the transponder, which transmits back an identifying number which registers the vehicle's use of the road, and an electronic payment system charges the user the toll. A major advantage is the driver does not have to stop, reducing traffic delays. Electronic tolling is cheaper than a staffed toll booth, reducing transaction costs for government or private road owners. The ease of varying the amount of the toll makes it easy to implement road congestion pricing, including for high-occupancy lanes, toll lanes that bypass congestion, and city-wide congestion charges. The payment system usually requires users to sign up in advance and load money into a declining-balance account, which is debited each time they pass a toll point.

The phylum was first proposed in 2016 following the recovery of genomes from a large-scale effort to mine metagenomic and single-cell genomic datasets for novel bacterial diversity. Extensive analysis of 5.2 Tb of metagenomic data from around the world suggests members of Kryptonia are found exclusively in high-temperature pH-netural geothermal springs, such as the Jinze pool (Yunnan Province, China), Dewar Creek Spring (British Columbia, Canada), and Great Boiling Spring (Nevada, USA). Due to primer mismatches, members of this phylum have been widely under-detected in 16S rRNA sequencing- based surveys of community composition. Analysis of the first genomes recovered from this group (from four different genera) suggests that members of Kryptonia are heterotrophs with a putative capacity for iron respiration. They are inferred to be incapable of some producing key metabolic compounds on their own (e.g.: biotin, certain amino acids), and thus may be metabolically dependent on other microbes in their environment, although the nature of such a relationship is unknown.

It took place on August 28, 1999 at the Meiji Jingu Stadium in Tokyo, Japan and was televised live on TV Asahi. The main event was marketed as a \\"dream match\\", a No Rope Explosive Barbed Wire Barricade Explosive Land Mine Double Hell Deathmatch pitting Keiji Mutoh's alter ego The Great Muta against Atsushi Onita's alter ego The Great Nita. Muta won the match. Other major matches on the card featured Shinya Hashimoto versus Masahiro Chono, The Mad Dogs (Michiyoshi Ohara and Tatsutoshi Goto) defending the IWGP Tag Team Championship against Manabu Nakanishi and Yuji Nagata, Koji Kanemoto defending the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship against Kendo Kashin and Shinjiro Otani and Tatsuhito Takaiwa defending the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship against El Samurai and Jushin Liger. ProductionStorylines= The Great Muta wrestled The Great Nita in the main event of Jingu Climax. The event was centered around a No Rope Explosive Barbed Wire Barricade Explosive Land Mine Double Hell Deathmatch between Keiji Mutoh's alter ego The Great Muta and Atsushi Onita's alter ego The Great Nita. Mutoh began using the Great Muta character in World Championship Wrestling in 1989 and incorporated the character into NJPW in 1990. With the growing popularity of the Great Muta in Japanese wrestling, several wrestlers began imitating it. Onita imitated the character in Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling as the \\"Great Nita\\" in 1994. Years later, after Onita departed FMW in 1998, he began feuding with Muta under his Great Nita alter ego and claimed to be more sadistic than Muta, setting up a match between the Great Muta and the Great Nita under Onita's deathmatch speciality which he had popularized in his promotion FMW. On June 8, Kendo Kashin defeated the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Champion Koji Kanemoto in the tournament final to win the 1999 Best of the Super Juniors tournament, thus earning a future title shot against Kanemoto for the Junior Heavyweight Championship. This set up a title match between the two for the Junior Heavyweight Championship at Jingu Climax. EventPreliminary matches= The event kicked off with a singles match between Kazuyuki Fujita and Brian Johnston. Fujita won the match by making Johnston submit to the cross armbreaker. Next, Shinjiro Otani and Tatsuhito Takaiwa defended the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship against El Samurai and Jushin Liger in the first championship match of the event. Otani nailed a Spiral Bomb to Liger to retain the titles. Next, Koji Kanemoto defended the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship against Kendo Kashin. Kashin made Kanemoto submit to the cross armbreaker to win the Junior Heavyweight Championship. Next, nWo Japan members Ten-Koji (Hiroyoshi Tenzan and Satoshi Kojima) took on the team of Shiro Koshinaka and Tatsumi Fujinami. Tenzan hit a kneeling kick to Koshinaka for the win. The match was followed by the final championship match of the event in which The Mad Dogs (Michiyoshi Ohara and Tatsutoshi Goto) defended the IWGP Tag Team Championship against Manabu Nakanishi and Yuji Nagata. Nagata delivered a Backdrop Hold to Ohara to win the match and the Tag Team Championship. Later, Don Frye took on Scott Norton. Frye made Norton submit to the rear naked choke for the win. It was followed by the penultimate match of the event in which Shinya Hashimoto took on Masahiro Chono. Hashimoto passed out in Chono's STF submission hold, forcing the referee to stop the match and award the win to Chono. =Main event match= The main event was a No Rope Explosive Barbed Wire Barricade Explosive Land Mine Double Hell Deathmatch between Keiji Mutoh's alter ego \\"The Great Muta\\" and Atsushi Onita's alter ego \\"The Great Nita\\". After a back and forth match, Muta knocked out Nita with a Kama and Nita was unable to answer the referee's ten count, which resulted in Muta getting the win.

Recognition has been held to be a constructive response and a judgment made about a person's contribution, reflecting not just work performance but also personal dedication and engagement on a regular or ad hoc basis, and expressed formally or informally, individually or collectively, privately or publicly, and monetarily or non-monetarily (Brun & Dugas, 2008).  Theoretical foundation  The track of scientific research around employee recognition and motivation was constructed on the foundation of early theories of behavioral science and psychology. The earliest scientific papers on employee recognition have tended to draw upon a combination of needs-based motivation (for example, Hertzberg 1966; Maslow 1943) theories and reinforcement theory (Mainly Pavlov 1902; B.F. Skinner 1938) as a foundation for the effects of employee recognition. = Needs-based motivation = Needs-based motivation theories are based on the argument that humans have basic drives that motivate them to behave in ways that help them fulfill those needs. * Maslow's hierarchy of human needs: Maslow's model identifies five categories of needs: physiological, safety, belonging and love, esteem and self-actualization. These 'levels' of needs are arranged on the hierarchy in order of immediate effect on human development and subsequently, potency for influencing behavior. According to Maslow, individuals are never fully satisfied on any need level but once a class of needs is substantially met, it is no longer motivating for the individual. Human behavior is therefore presented as a rational activity directed at the satisfaction of successive levels of needs. Recognition schemes are based on the notion that individuals aim at the satisfaction of the esteem needs after fulfilling previous needs on the hierarchy. The esteem needs can be broken down into the need for self-esteem and the need for the esteem of others. The need for the esteem of others is required to be satisfied externally through status or prestige, recognition, and appreciation by others. The need for self-esteem is understood as the need to hold a high evaluation of oneself based upon real capacity, achievement, independence, and respect from others. * Hertzberg dual-level needs theory : During his research, Hertzberg interviewed several hundred US professionals, asking them to name work experiences that made them feel \\"exceptionally good\\" about their jobs, as well as those that made them feel \\"exceptionally bad\\" about their jobs. After categorizing the responses, Herzberg found that factors that caused negative feelings were quite different from those that caused positive feelings. Respondents who felt good about their work cited factors that largely correspond with Maslow's needs, which are positioned higher on the hierarchy. This included achievement, recognition for achievement, the work itself, responsibility and growth or advancement. On the other hand, dissatisfied respondents tended to cite factors extrinsic to the job such as pay, working conditions, supervision, security, relationships with colleagues and company policies. Most of these factors correspond to Maslow's physiological and safety needs. Herzberg's findings led him to conclude that there exist two different spectrums: one set of 'hygiene' factors that make up a continuum from dissatisfaction to no dissatisfaction, and a second set of 'motivator' factors that make up a continuum from no satisfaction to satisfaction (Hertzberg 1966). Recognition, according to Herzberg, is a motivator whilst monetary rewards such as pay are necessary to prevent dissatisfaction but don't promote job satisfaction and motivation. = Reinforcement theory = Reinforcement theory has its roots in the work of behavioral psychologists John Watson, Ivan Pavlov, E.L. Thorndike and B.F. Skinner. It argues that people can be conditioned through rewards, which can be intangible in nature, and punishments to repeat rewarded behaviors and cease unrewarded behaviors. Through this process of conditioning, an association is made between a behavior and the consequence for that behavior, either an incentive or a deterrent. The theory is based on Thorndike's (1911) law of effect, which states that people are likely to repeat behavior that produces a pleasurable outcome. Reinforcement theory has also been applied in an organizational setting. A version of reinforcement theory, organizational behavior modification theory (Bandura 1969, 1986; Luthans and Stajkovic 1999; Stajkovic and Luthans 1997) is concerned with modifying employee behavior on the job through the systematic implementation of reinforcement interventions. The central tenet of the theory is 'you get what you reinforce' (Luthans and Stajkovic 1999: 52) According to Stajkovic and Luthans (1997), there are three types of positive reinforcers that result in an increase in performance- related behaviors when contingently administered: pay, performance feedback and social recognition. Social recognition is defined as 'the use of verbal consequences, typically expressed by individuals, such as attention, recognition, commendations, compliments, and praise' (Stajkovic and Luthans 1997: ). Therefore, reinforcement theory provides a theoretical basis for the positive effect of recognition employee performance by demonstrating that individuals who are recognized or rewarded for their performance are motivated to keep performing activities for which they have been recognized.  Types of employee recognition programs  According to Punke (2013), recognition programs should be balanced between performance-based and value-based initiatives, but the programs should be composed of three methods: formal, informal and day-to-day recognition. = Formal recognition = It consists of structured recognition programs with clearly defined objectives, processes, and criteria linked to rewarding and recognizing individuals, teams, or departments on a company-wide level for achieving specific business targets, exemplifying specific organizational values, or performing actions that go above and beyond normal work expectations. According to Punke (2013), this approach is extremely organized recognition involving recognizing employees who have done so many years of service at the organization. = Informal recognition = It focuses primarily on performance achievements, goal accomplishments, and other milestones by individuals or teams that may occur monthly or quarterly. It may include low-cost awards, refreshments, point- value incentives, gift cards, and certificates. Informal recognition programs have been identified to point out employee value and contribution at the right moment as a result of its instantaneous nature and the continuous changing work environment. = Day-to-day recognition = It is a type of recognition practices that are frequent (daily or weekly), low or no cost, often intangible and often reliant on interpersonal skills for positive feedback that can be given to all employees. According to Harrison (2005), the day-to- day recognition brings the benefit of immediate and powerful reinforcement of desired behavior and sets an example to other employees of desired behavior that aligns with organizational objectives. To him, it gives individuals and teams at all levels the opportunity to recognize good work by other employees and teams, and it also gives the opportunity for them to be recognized on the spot for their own good work.  Benefits  Employee recognition has been identified to be a highly effective motivational instrument that can have significant positive impact on employee job satisfaction and performance as well as overall organisational performance (Rahim & Duad, 2013). When effective recognition is provided in the workplace, this contributes towards a favorable working environment, which can motivate employees to become committed to their work and excel in their performance. Highly motivated employees serve as the competitive advantage for an organisation because their performance leads an organization to well accomplishment of its goals and business strategy. By consistently and frequently applying formal, informal and everyday recognition programs, organisations are provided with a powerful tool for influencing employees to live the organisation's values and implement its focus (Herzberg, 1996 as cited in Luthans, 2000). It also affords the organisation opportunity to highlight desired actions and behavior thereby creating role models for other employees (Silverman, 2004). By specifically reinforcing expected behavior, organisations not only indicate to employees that their efforts are noticed and appreciated but also inculcate in them the organisational values, goals, objectives, priorities and their role in achieving them. As a motivational tool, employee recognition programs assist employees to see how they contribute to bottom-line results and how their contributions will be recognized and rewarded immediately. In any case formal, informal and every day recognition programs are able to satisfy both employees' and employers' needs as well as bring the maximum result and function for organizations.

The blue economy is also rooted in the green economy and the UN Sustainable Development Goals.Isaacs, M. (2019, July 23). Blue Justice for small-scale fisheries. Retrieved July 26, 2019, from Plaas website: https://www.plaas.org.za/blue-justice-for-small-scale-fisheries/ Blue Justice acknowledges the historical rights of small-scale fishing communities to marine and inland resources and coastal space; in some cases, communities have used these resources for thousands of years. Thus, as a concept, it seeks to investigate pressures on small-scale fisheries from other ocean uses promoted in blue economy and blue growth agendas, including industrial fisheries, coastal and marine tourism, aquaculture, and energy production, and how they may compromise the rights and the well-being of small-scale fisheries and their communities. Definition There is no one definition of Blue Justice. Below are definitions of Blue Justice offered by recent academic literature. Moeniba Isaacs, PLAAS 2019: Blue Justice has at its core a social justice principle that recognizes the need for small-scale fisheries to have equity, access, participation, and rights within the blue economy. The Blue Justice approach for small-scale fisheries, therefore, is to ‚Äúcritically examine the political, economic, and ecological processes of blue economy development initiatives.‚Äù Svein Jentoft, Life Above Water:Jentoft, S. (2019). Life Above Water: Essays on Human Experiences of Small-Scale Fisheries. St. John‚Äôs, N.L.: TBTI Global. Blue Justice for small-scale fisheries in the blue economy agenda means inclusion for small-scale fishers and community members as stakeholders with an eye towards power imbalances and equity. The basic tenets of social justice address who has a stake in the issue, and they focus on what needs to be done to restore justice for past wrongs in the marginalization of small-scale fisheries. Philippa Cohen et al., Securing a Just Space for Small-Scale Fisheries in the Blue Economy:Cohen, P. J., Allison, E. H., Andrew, N. L., Cinner, J., Evans, L. S., Fabinyi, M., ‚Ä¶ Ratner, B. D. (2019). Securing a Just Space for Small-Scale Fisheries in the Blue Economy. Frontiers in Marine Science, 6. https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2019.00171 Securing a ‚Äújust‚Äù space for small- scale fisheries in the blue economy means including human rights and the voices of the largest ocean users in the discussion. It also means that paying closer attention to the social dimensions of fisheries may allow for better governance in this arena. Origins To address these longstanding issues, international instruments that explicitly reference human rights principles have been adopted. The Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests in the Context of National Food Security and the Voluntary Guidelines for Securing Sustainable Small-Scale Fisheries in the context of Food Security and Poverty Eradication (SSF Guidelines) are instruments that have social justice backings with language that calls for ‚Äúresponsible governance of tenure because land, fisheries and forests are central for the realization of human rights‚Ä¶‚Äù (FAO 2012; Governance of Tenure, p. 6), and that ‚ÄúStates should ensure that effective fisheries management systems are in place to prevent overexploitation driven by market demand that can threaten the sustainability of fisheries resources, food security, and nutrition.‚Äù (FAO 2015; SSF Guidelines, p. 11). These instruments are necessary to secure the historical use rights and customary use rights of small-scale fisheries. Blue Justice has social justice and human rights principles at its foundation, and it has connections to environmental justice and climate justice due to the focus of those movements on the unequal distribution of harm exerted on marginalized communities. Rawls (1999) outlined his ‚Äòjustice as fairness‚Äô with two principles: that each person has the equal right to basic liberties, and that social and economic inequalities should be reasonable and attached to positions that are open to all.Rawls, J. (1999). A Theory of Justice (Revised). Harvard University Press.

Organization and mission  Based in India, Safetipin aims to make cities safer by providing data collected through technology tools and apps to its users. The data is collected and analysed on parameters that impact safety and walkability. Its end goal is to achieve movement without fear for women. It was co-founded by gender rights' activist Kalpana Viswanath and Ashish Basu in 2013.  How it works  Using apps, such as My Safetipin, Safetipin Nite and Safetipin Site, it maps the entire street network as well as key public spaces such as transport hubs, parks, markets etc., in a city. The nine parameters used by Safetipin to calculate safety are lighting, openness, visibility, people, security guards, walk path, public transport, gender usage, feeling, all pertaining to a certain area. Bus stops and metro stations are also included to review the safety status around them.  App features  Safetipin enables the users with some key features such as, selecting a place to stay based on the safety score of the neighbourhood, driving or walking using the safest route, finding the nearest safe place and heading there, asking a friend to track them and get notifications if there is a problem, receiving notifications when in an unsafe place.  Recent initiatives  Safetipin, in Delhi, has mapped low income areas and areas adjacent to metro stations since 2013, in order to find localities with poor lighting conditions. Based on its data the Delhi government fixed the existing streetlights and installed additional street lights and an increase in police patrolling. In 2018, the government approached the organization to do a fresh mapping to measure change as well as point out other safety concerns in the city. In 2016, Bogota city was mapped using the app on the 230 km of bike path. The resultant data was used by the local government to improve lighting along the street, identify the locations for CCTV cameras and bike stands so as to make women feel safer using the bike paths after dark. A symbolic event, ‚ÄòWomen Taking the Night‚Äô was also held in the city after the report by Safetipin, where women walkers were joined by top government officials to walk the reportedly unsafe areas together. The focus of the project by Safetipin in Hanoi was on mapping urban transport for Hanoi Metro Line 3.

Miller was childless, so upon his death in 1848, the execution of his will fell to a distant relative, Samuel Christy. The will contained instructions to bury Miller's body in a 20-foot-deep pit above which, The Scotsman reported, would be built a monument \\"in commemoration of the private virtues of the deceased, for, as a public character, he was unknown.\\" ¬£20,000 was allocated for construction. Although the monument would originally have been a solitary structure in a moorland half a mile east of Miller's house, it is now somewhat incongruously surrounded by 1930s bungalows on Craigentinny Crescent. The mausoleum itself was designed by David Rhind and completed in 1856, with two bas relief sculptures by Alfred Gatley depicting part of the biblical narrative of the Exodus added later. The relief on the north face, 'The Overthrow of Pharoah in the Red Sea', shows the destruction of Ramesses II's army during the crossing of the Red Sea.

Prehistory  Inside cave 13B at Pinnacle Point, an archeological site found on the coast of South Africa, paleoanthropologists in 2000 found evidence that, between 170,000 and 40,000 years ago, Late Stone Age people were scraping and grinding ochre, a clay colored red by iron oxide, probably with the intention of using it to color their bodies. Red hematite powder was also found scattered around the remains at a grave site in a Zhoukoudian cave complex near Beijing. The site has evidence of habitation as early as 700,000 years ago. The hematite might have been used to symbolize blood in an offering to the dead. Red, black and white were the first colors used by artists in the Upper Paleolithic age, probably because natural pigments such as red ochre and iron oxide were readily available where early people lived. Madder, a plant whose root could be made into a red dye, grew widely in Europe, Africa and Asia. The cave of Altamira in Spain has a painting of a bison colored with red ochre that dates to between 15,000 and 16,500 BC. A red dye called Kermes was made beginning in the Neolithic Period by drying and then crushing the bodies of the females of a tiny scale insect in the genus Kermes, primarily Kermes vermilio. The insects live on the sap of certain trees, especially Kermes oak trees near the Mediterranean region. Jars of kermes have been found in a Neolithic cave- burial at Adaoutse, Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne. Kermes from oak trees was later used by Romans, who imported it from Spain. A different variety of dye was made from Porphyrophora hamelii (Armenian cochineal) scale insects that lived on the roots and stems of certain herbs. It was mentioned in texts as early as the 8th century BC, and it was used by the ancient Assyrians and Persians. Kermes is also mentioned in the Bible. In the Book of Exodus, God instructs Moses to have the Israelites bring him an offering including cloth \\"of blue, and purple, and scarlet.\\" The term used for scarlet in the 4th-century Latin Vulgate version of the Bible passage is coccumque bis tinctum, meaning \\"colored twice with coccus.\\" Coccus, from the ancient Greek Kokkos, means a tiny grain and is the term that was used in ancient times for the Kermes vermilio insect used to make the Kermes dye. This was also the origin of the expression \\"dyed in the grain.\\"  Ancient history  In ancient Egypt, red was associated with life, health, and victory. Egyptians would color themselves with red ochre during celebrations. Egyptian women used red ochre as a cosmetic to redden cheeks and lips and also used henna to color their hair and paint their nails. But, like many colors, it also had a negative association, with heat, destruction and evil. A prayer to god Isis states: \\"Oh Isis, protect me from all things evil and red.\\" The ancient Egyptians began manufacturing pigments in about 4000 BC. Red ochre was widely used as a pigment for wall paintings, particularly as the skin color of men. An ivory painter's palette found inside the tomb of King Tutankhamun had small compartments with pigments of red ochre and five other colors. The Egyptians used the root of the rubia, or madder plant, to make a dye, later known as alizarin, and also used it as a pigment, which became known as madder lake, alizarin or alizarin crimson. In Ancient China, artisans were making red and black painted pottery as early as the Yangshao Culture period (5000‚Äì3000 BC). A red-painted wooden bowl was found at a Neolithic site in Yuyao, Zhejiang. Other red-painted ceremonial objects have been found at other sites dating to the Spring and Autumn period (770‚Äì221 BC). During the Han dynasty (200 BC‚Äì200 AD) Chinese craftsmen made a red pigment, lead tetroxide, which they called ch-ien tan, by heating lead white pigment. Like the Egyptians, they made a red dye from the madder plant to color silk fabric for gowns and used pigments colored with madder to make red lacquerware. Red lead or Lead tetroxide pigment was widely used as the red in Persian and Indian miniature paintings as well as in European art, where it was called minium. In India, the rubia plant has been used to make dye since ancient times. A piece of cotton dyed with rubia dated to the third millennium BC was found at an archaeological site at Mohenjo-daro. It has been used by Indian monks and hermits for centuries to dye their robes. The early inhabitants of America had their own vivid crimson dye, made from the cochineal, an insect of the same family as the Kermes of Europe and the Middle East, which feeds on the Opuntia, or prickly pear cactus plant. Red-dyed textiles from the Paracas culture (800‚Äì100 BC) have been found in tombs in Peru. Red also featured in the burials of royalty in the Maya city-states. In the Tomb of the Red Queen inside Temple XIII in the ruined Maya city of Palenque (600‚Äì700 AD), the skeleton and ceremonial items of a noble woman were completely covered with bright red powder made from cinnabar.

The Greeks began using red lead as a pigment. Romans wore togas with red stripes on holidays, and the bride at a wedding wore a red shawl, called a flammeum. Red was used to color statues and the skin of gladiators. Red was also the color associated with army; Roman soldiers wore red tunics, and officers wore a cloak called a paludamentum which, depending upon the quality of the dye, could be crimson, scarlet or purple. In Roman mythology red is associated with the god of war, Mars. The vexilloid of the Roman Empire had a red background with the letters SPQR in gold. A Roman general receiving a triumph had his entire body painted red in honor of his achievement. The Romans liked bright colors, and many Roman villas were decorated with vivid red murals. The pigment used for many of the murals was called vermilion, and it came from the mineral cinnabar, a common ore of mercury. It was one of the finest reds of ancient times ‚Äì the paintings have retained their brightness for more than twenty centuries. The source of cinnabar for the Romans was a group of mines near Almad√©n, southwest of Madrid, in Spain. Working in the mines was extremely dangerous, since mercury is highly toxic; the miners were slaves or prisoners, and being sent to the cinnabar mines was a virtual death sentence.

Dyed fabrics have been hung up to dry.  Postclassical history  In Europe = After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, red was adopted as a color of majesty and authority by the Byzantine Empire, the princes of Europe, and the Roman Catholic Church. It also played an important part in the rituals of the Catholic Church, symbolizing the blood of Christ and the Christian martyrs. Red was the color of the banner of the Byzantine emperors. In Western Europe, Emperor Charlemagne painted his palace red as a very visible symbol of his authority, and wore red shoes at his coronation. Kings, princes and, beginning in 1295, Roman Catholic cardinals began to wear red colored habitus. When Abbe Suger rebuilt Saint Denis Basilica outside Paris in the early 12th century, he added stained glass windows colored blue cobalt glass and red glass tinted with copper. Together they flooded the basilica with a mystical light. Soon stained glass windows were being added to cathedrals all across France, England and Germany. In medieval painting red was used to attract attention to the most important figures; both Christ and the Virgin Mary were commonly painted wearing red mantles. Red clothing was a sign of status and wealth. It was worn not only by cardinals and princes, but also by merchants, artisans and townspeople, particularly on holidays or special occasions. Red dye for the clothing of ordinary people was made from the roots of the rubia tinctorum, the madder plant. This color leaned toward brick-red, and faded easily in the sun or during washing. The wealthy and aristocrats wore scarlet clothing dyed with kermes, or carmine, made from the carminic acid in tiny female scale insects, which lived on the leaves of oak trees in Eastern Europe and around the Mediterranean. The insects were gathered, dried, crushed, and boiled with different ingredients in a long and complicated process, which produced a brilliant scarlet. Brazilin was another popular red dye in the Middle Ages. It came from the sapanwood tree, which grew in India, Malaysia and Sri Lanka. A similar tree, brazilwood, grew on the coast of South America. The red wood was ground into sawdust and mixed with an alkaline solution to make dye and pigment. It became one of the most profitable exports from the New World, and gave its name to the nation of Brazil.

Silk was woven and dyed as early as the Han Dynasty (25‚Äì220 BC). China had a monopoly on the manufacture of silk until the 6th century AD, when it was introduced into the Byzantine Empire. In the 12th century, it was introduced into Europe. At the time of the Han Dynasty, Chinese red was a light red, but during the Tang dynasty new dyes and pigments were discovered. The Chinese used several different plants to make red dyes, including the flowers of the safflour (Carthamus tinctorius), the thorns and stems of a variety of sorghum plant called Kao-liang, and the wood of the sappanwood tree. For pigments, they used cinnabar, which produced the famous vermillion or \\"Chinese red\\" of Chinese lacquerware. Red played an important role in Chinese philosophy. It was believed that the world was composed of five elements: metal, wood, water, fire and earth, and that each had a color. Red was associated with fire. Each Emperor chose the color that his fortune-tellers believed would bring the most prosperity and good fortune to his reign. During the Zhou, Han, Jin, Song and Ming Dynasties, red was considered a noble color, and it was featured in all court ceremonies, from coronations to sacrificial offerings, and weddings. Red was also a badge of rank. During the Song dynasty (906‚Äì1279), officials of the top three ranks wore purple clothes; those of the fourth and fifth wore bright red; those of the sixth and seventh wore green; and the eighth and ninth wore blue. Red was the color worn by the royal guards of honor, and the color of the carriages of the imperial family. When the imperial family traveled, their servants and accompanying officials carried red and purple umbrellas. Of an official who had talent and ambition, it was said \\"he is so red he becomes purple.\\" Red was also featured in Chinese Imperial architecture. In the Tang and Song Dynasties, gates of palaces were usually painted red, and nobles often painted their entire mansion red. One of the most famous works of Chinese literature, A Dream of Red Mansions by Cao Xueqin (1715‚Äì63), was about the lives of noble women who passed their lives out of public sight within the walls of such mansions. In later dynasties red was reserved for the walls of temples and imperial residences. When the Manchu rulers of the Qing Dynasty conquered the Ming and took over the Forbidden City and Imperial Palace in Beijing, all the walls, gates, beams and pillars were painted in red and gold. Red is not often used in traditional Chinese paintings, which are usually black ink on white paper with a little green sometimes added for trees or plants; but the round or square seals which contain the name of the artist are traditionally red.

In Venice, Titian was the master of fine reds, particularly vermilion; he used many layers of pigment mixed with a semi- transparent glaze, which let the light pass through, to create a more luminous color. During the Renaissance trade routes were opened to the New World, to Asia and the Middle East, and new varieties of red pigment and dye were imported into Europe, usually through Venice, Genoa or Seville, and Marseille. Venice was the major depot importing and manufacturing pigments for artists and dyers from the end of the 15th century; the catalog of a Venetian Vendecolori, or pigment seller, from 1534 included vermilion and kermes. There were guilds of dyers who specialized in red in Venice and other large Europeans cities. The Rubia plant was used to make the most common dye; it produced an orange-red or brick red color used to dye the clothes of merchants and artisans. For the wealthy, the dye used was kermes, made from a tiny scale insect which fed on the branches and leaves of the oak tree. For those with even more money there was Polish Cochineal; also known as Kermes vermilio or \\"Blood of Saint John\\", which was made from a related insect, the Margodes polonicus. It made a more vivid red than ordinary Kermes. The finest and most expensive variety of red made from insects was the \\"Kermes\\" of Armenia (Armenian cochineal, also known as Persian kirmiz), made by collecting and crushing Porphyophora hamelii, an insect which lived on the roots and stems of certain grasses. The pigment and dye merchants of Venice imported and sold all of these products and also manufactured their own color, called Venetian red, which was considered the most expensive and finest red in Europe. Its secret ingredient was arsenic, which brightened the color. But early in the 16th century, a brilliant new red appeared in Europe. When the Spanish conquistador Hern√°n Cort√©s and his soldiers conquered the Aztec Empire in 1519‚Äì21, they discovered slowly that the Aztecs had another treasure beside silver and gold; they had the tiny cochineal, a parasitic scale insect which lived on cactus plants, which, when dried and crushed, made a magnificent red. The cochineal in Mexico was closely related to the Kermes varieties of Europe, but unlike European Kermes, it could be harvested several times a year, and it was ten times stronger than the Kermes of Poland. It worked particularly well on silk, satin and other luxury textiles. In 1523 Cortes sent the first shipment to Spain. Soon cochineal began to arrive in European ports aboard convoys of Spanish galleons. At first the guilds of dyers in Venice and other cities banned cochineal to protect their local products, but the superior quality of cochineal dye made it impossible to resist. By the beginning of the 17th century it was the preferred luxury red for the clothing of cardinals, bankers, courtesans and aristocrats. The painters of the early Renaissance used two traditional lake pigments, made from mixing dye with either chalk or alum, kermes lake, made from kermes insects, and madder lake, made from the rubia tinctorum plant. With the arrival of cochineal, they had a third, carmine, which made a very fine crimson, though it had a tendency to change color if not used carefully. It was used by almost all the great painters of the 15th and 16th centuries, including Rembrandt, Vermeer, Rubens, Anthony van Dyck, Diego Vel√°zquez and Tintoretto. Later it was used by Thomas Gainsborough, Seurat and J.M.W. Turner. Tizian 041.jpgThe Assumption, by Titian (1516‚Äì18).

Elizabeth I Steven Van Der Meulen.jpgThe young Queen Elizabeth I (here in about 1563) liked to wear bright reds, before she adopted the more sober image of the \\"Virgin Queen\\". Her satin gown was probably dyed with kermes. The Wedding Dance.JPGThe Wedding Dance (1566), by Pieter Bruegel the Elder. In Renaissance Flanders, people of all social classes wore red at celebrations. The dye came from the root of the madder plant, which tended toward orange. Jan Vermeer van Delft 006.jpgWoman with a wine glass, by Johannes Vermeer (1659‚Äì60).

Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn - Portret van een paar als oudtestamentische figuren, genaamd 'Het Joodse bruidje' - Google Art Project.jpgRembrandt used carmine lake, made of cochineal, to paint the skirt of the bride in the painting known as The Jewish bride (1665‚Äì69). Louis XIV of France.jpgThe red heels of the shoes of King Louis XIV of France were discreet symbols of his royal status. = In the 18th and 19th centuries = During the French Revolution, the Jacobins and other more radical parties adopted the red flag; it was taken from red flags hoisted by the French government to declare a state of siege or emergency. Many of them wore a red Phrygian cap, or liberty cap, modeled after the caps worn by freed slaves in Ancient Rome. During the height of the Reign of Terror, Women wearing red caps gathered around the guillotine to celebrate each execution. They were called the \\"Furies of the guillotine\\". The guillotines used during the Reign of Terror in 1792 and 1793 were painted red, or made of red wood. During the Reign of Terror a statue of a woman titled liberty, painted red, was placed in the square in front of the guillotine. After the end of the Reign of Terror, France went back to the blue, white and red tricolor, whose red was taken from the red and blue colors of the city of Paris, and was the traditional color of Saint Denis, the Christian martyr and patron saint of Paris. In the mid-19th century, red became the color of a new political and social movement, socialism. It became the most common banner of the worker's movement, of the French Revolution of 1848, of the Paris Commune in 1870, and of socialist parties across Europe. (see red flags and revolution section below). As the Industrial Revolution spread across Europe, chemists and manufacturers sought new red dyes that could be used for large-scale manufacture of textiles. One popular color imported into Europe from Turkey and India in the 18th and early 19th century was Turkey red, known in France as rouge d'Adrinople. Beginning in the 1740s, this bright red color was used to dye or print cotton textiles in England, the Netherlands and France. Turkey red used madder as the colorant, but the process was longer and more complicated, involving multiple soaking of the fabrics in lye, olive oil, sheep's dung, and other ingredients. The fabric was more expensive but resulted in a fine bright and lasting red, similar to carmine, perfectly suited to cotton. The fabric was widely exported from Europe to Africa, the Middle East and America. In 19th-century America, it was widely used in making the traditional patchwork quilt. In 1826, the French chemist Pierre-Jean Robiquet discovered the organic compound alizarin, the powerful coloring ingredient of the madder root, the most popular red dye of the time. In 1868, German chemists Carl Graebe and Liebermann were able to synthesize alizarin, and to produce it from coal tar. The synthetic red was cheaper and more lasting than the natural dye, and the plantation of madder in Europe and import of cochineal from Latin America soon almost completely ceased. The 19th century also saw the use of red in art to create specific emotions, not just to imitate nature. It saw the systematic study of color theory, and particularly the study of how complementary colors such as red and green reinforced each other when they were placed next to each other. These studies were avidly followed by artists such as Vincent van Gogh. Describing his painting, The Night Cafe, to his brother Theo in 1888, Van Gogh wrote: \\"I sought to express with red and green the terrible human passions. The hall is blood red and pale yellow, with a green billiard table in the center, and four lamps of lemon yellow, with rays of orange and green. Everywhere it is a battle and antithesis of the most different reds and greens.\\"Vincent van Gogh, Corr√©spond√©nce general, number 533, cited by John Gage, Practice and Meaning from Antiquity to Abstraction.

Vincent Willem van Gogh 076.jpgThe Night Cafe, (1888), by Vincent van Gogh, used red and green to express what Van Gogh called \\"the terrible human passions.\\" = In the 20th and 21st centuries = In the 20th century, red was the color of Revolution; it was the color of the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917 and of the Chinese Revolution of 1949, and later of the Cultural Revolution. Red was the color of communist parties from Eastern Europe to Cuba to Vietnam. In the late 19th and early 20th century, the German chemical industry invented two new synthetic red pigments: cadmium red, which was the color of natural vermilion, and mars red, which was a synthetic red ochre, the color of the very first natural red pigment. The French painter Henri Matisse (1869‚Äì1954) was one of the first prominent painters to use the new cadmium red. He even tried, without success, to persuade the older and more traditional Renoir, his neighbor in the south of France, to switch from vermilion to cadmium red. Matisse was also one of the first 20th-century artists to make color the central element of the painting, chosen to evoke emotions. \\"A certain blue penetrates your soul\\", he wrote. \\"A certain red affects your blood pressure.\\" He also was familiar with the way that complementary colors, such as red and green, strengthened each other when they were placed next to each other. He wrote, \\"My choice of colors is not based on scientific theory; it is based on observation, upon feelings, upon the real nature of each experience ... I just try to find a color which corresponds to my feelings.\\" Later in the century, the American artist Mark Rothko (1903‚Äì70) also used red, in even simpler form, in blocks of dark, somber color on large canvases, to inspire deep emotions. Rothko observed that color was \\"only an instrument;\\" his interest was \\"in expressing human emotions tragedy, ecstasy, doom, and so on.\\" Rothko also began using the new synthetic pigments, but not always with happy results. In 1962 he donated to Harvard University a series of large murals of the Passion of Christ whose predominant colors were dark pink and deep crimson. He mixed mostly traditional colors to make the pink and crimson; synthetic ultramarine, cerulean blue, and titanium white, but he also used two new organic reds, Naphtol and Lithol. The Naphtol did well, but the Lithol slowly changed color when exposed to light. Within five years the deep pinks and reds had begun to turn light blue, and by 1979 the paintings were ruined and had to be taken down. Bathing of a Red Horse (Petrov-Vodkin).jpgBathing of a Red Horse, by the Russian symbolist painter Kuzma Petrov-Vodkin (1912), used a bright red horse to surprise and shock viewers. It provoked a furious discussion among Russian critics. References Category:Primary colors ","title":"History of red"},{"id":"63994260","text":"Ambassadors in Spain are also accredited to Andorra.

The School was founded by Katrin Adam, Ellen Perry Berkeley, Noel Phyllis Birkby, Bobbie Sue Hood, Marie I. Kennedy, Joan Forrester Sprague, and Leslie Kanes Weisman. Founding The founders met through professional organizations for women architects and planners (beginning in 1972) and attendance at the first U.S. conferences on women in architecture in 1974 and 1975. According to the 1975 WSPA brochure, these opportunities to meet and share experiences with other women professionals led them to a conviction that an alternative educational experience would be a valuable way to address the \\"shared common goals and interests not being met within the existing professional contexts.\\" The same brochure describes the founders goals: Mission and purpose WSPA was designed as a form of organization providing a style of educational experience that incorporated feminist principles in form as well as content. There was no set format for WSPA sessions, and the coordinators used feedback from participants to make adjustments and innovations designed to help the organization better meet its goals. Within a general set of criteria, the founders envisioned an ever-changing and evolving entity responsive to the needs of the participants. The School aimed to attract participants from diverse backgrounds and geographic locations by making an interest in environmental design the only admission \\"requirement\\" and by holding each session at a different location. Tuition was kept to a minimum and work-study scholarships were available. While the focus of the earlier sessions could be characterized as \\"consciousness raising, skill building, and [theoretical discussion]\\" among women who were primarily professionals and academics, in its latter years WSPA was moving toward involvement in political activism based on collaboration with \\"grassroots women.\\" According to co-founders Noel Phyllis Birkby and Leslie Kanes Weisman, all participants in WSPA were considered members of a peer group \\"equally responsible and equally capable of making a contribution\\". Sessions were planned by a group of Coordinators who were essentially self-selected, based on their willingness and ability to devote the time and energy necessary to bring off a successful session. The Coordinators were paid through income generated by tuition fees. Curriculum and sessions The curriculum was designed to offer subject matter unavailable in standard academic or professional settings and particularly emphasized skills that were not valued in male-dominated architectural firms. Courses were conducted by methods designed to \\"eliminate some of the effects of male- defined and identified educations.\\" Instructors emphasized \\"the active participation of all members of the group, minimizing the role of the coordinators as experts or authorities,\\" while maximizing their \\"roles as information sources and organizers\\". There were five WSPA sessions in all: at St. Joseph's College in Biddeford, Maine, in 1975; at Stephenson College in Santa Cruz, California, in 1976; at Roger Williams College in Bristol, Rhode Island, in 1978; at Regis College in Denver, Colorado, in 1979; and a weekend symposium in Washington, DC, in 1981. A session planned and advertised for 1980 at Hood College in Frederick, Maryland, was cancelled when registration targets were not met. WSPA hosted a national women's symposium \\"Community- Based Alternatives and Women in the Eighties,\\" on May 17‚Äì20, 1981, at American University, Washington, DC. The event focused on women in the areas of housing, employment, economic development, education and cooperative development. Despite ongoing efforts, WSPA's final project was a 1983-1984 Design Arts Grant from the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) for \\"Architectural Quality in Urban Homesteading,\\" a project with a stated aim to help urban homesteaders, many of whom where women, \\"achieve architectural quality in buildings rehabilitated and cooperatively owned and managed by homesteaders through a participatory design process.\\" WSPA programming focused on reforming the design professions to include women. Courses like \\"Demystification of Tools in Relation to Design\\" taught by Katrin Adam, emphasized practical skills, and courses such as \\"Women and the Built Environment: Personal, Social, and Professional Perceptions,\\" taught by Birkby and others, encouraging women to consider broader issues of significance to women in built and symbolic environments. The participants who brought children to the two-week program where provided with childcare arranged through a work study program on each campus. Legacy Though WSPA remained a legal corporation after the final session in 1981, no additional sessions came to fruition. Internal struggles developed, the School was perpetually short of money, and, probably most importantly, no group of Coordinators came forward to take on the challenge of planning a session. In a 1989 piece on WSPA for the book Architecture: A Place for Women, Leslie Kanes Weisman described it as a product of its time, ideal for \\"the consciousness-raising task of defining problems,\\" but less useful for \\"designing and implementing solutions.\\"  References  External links  * Women's School of Planning and Architecture records at the Sophia Smith Collection, Smith College Special Collections Category:Women architects Category:Women's education in the United States ","title":"Women's School of Planning and Architecture"},{"id":"63994271","text":"El≈ºbieta Wierniuk (16 March 1951 - 16 September 2017) was a Polish diver.

He served in the War of American Independence, earning membership in the Society of the Cincinnati.  Biography  Gras-Pr√©ville was born to an aristocratic family from Tarascon. He was uncle to Ren√© Louis Dominique de Gras-Pr√©ville. Gras-Pr√©ville joined the Navy as a Garde de l'√âtendard in 1746. He was promoted to Ensign in 1754, and to Lieutenant on 15 January 1762. Gras-Pr√©ville was promoted to Captain on 4 April 1777, in spite of a relative inexperience of command. In July 1778, he commanded the frigate Engageante, and on 6 July 1778 he captured the British 26-gun privateer frigate Rose, which surrendered only when she was so damaged that she had to be scuttled. D'Estaing tasked him to recruit volunteers in the Caribbean. In February, Engageante departed Toulon for America, where she arrived in late March, but had to be quaranteened. In April 1779, he escorted a convoy from Martinique to France, and earned himself a 800-livre pension when he defended it against the British. On 12 June 1779, Gras-Pr√©ville was promoted to the command of the 80-gun ship Triomphant. He captained her at the Battle of Martinique on 17 April 1780 as flag captain of the White-and-Blue squadron (van) under Sade, in the fleet under Guichen. He also took part in the actions of 15 May and 19 May 1780, before sailing Triomphant back to France. In 1781, he commanded the 74-gun Z√©l√© in the White squadron (centre) of the fleet under De Grasse. He took part in the Invasion of Tobago in May 1781 and in the Battle of the Chesapeake on 5 September 1781. In the night of 11 to 12 April 1782, Z√©l√© collided with Ville de Paris, damaging Z√©l√© which had to be taken in tow to repair at Martinique. Gras-Pr√©ville retired from the Navy on 1 October 1786. During the French Revolution, he joined the Royalist army and took part in the Siege of Lyon on 8 August 1793. He was captured by the Republicans and shot on 11 December 1793.

It is a candidate phylum, meaning there are no cultured representatives of this group. Members of the Modulibacteria phylum are known to cause fatal filament overgrowth (bulking) in high-rate industrial anaerobic wastewater treatment bioreactors. The Modulibacteria phylum was first proposed in 2006 by two independent research groups based on analyses of 16S rRNA gene sequences. One group recovered Modulibacteria sequences from the a hypersaline microbial mat from Guerrero Negro (Baja California Sur, Mexico) and used the provisional name GN06 for the novel phylum, while the other recovered sequences from sulfur-rich black mud marine sediments (CA, USA) and used the provisional name KSB3. The first genomic insights into the phylum were achieved in 2015, at which time the name \\"Modulibacteria\\" was proposed. Two genomes were recovered from methanogenic sludge samples of a full-scale upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor treating a high-strength organic wastewater discharged from a food-processing factory. Through a combination of genome-based metabolic reconstruction and microscopic observation, it was determined that the two studied Modulibacteria species (Moduliflexus flocculans and Vecturithrix granuli) produce filamentous structures and are Gram-negative, strictly anaerobic fermenters capable of non-flagellar based gliding motility. Both have an unusually large number of sensory and response regulator genes compared to other bacteria. Members of the Modulibacteria phylum have been detected in a variety of environments in addition to bioreactors and hypersaline mats, such as wetland sediments (FJ516883.1), the dolphin mouth, and a tubeworm from a coldseep (FM165273).

Furthermore, various applications of this color in different countries are explained.  In different cultures and traditions  In China, red () is the symbol of fire and the south (both south in general and Southern China specifically). It carries a largely positive connotation, being associated with courage, loyalty, honor, success, fortune, fertility, happiness, passion, and summer. In Chinese cultural traditions, red is associated with weddings (where brides traditionally wear red dresses) and red paper is frequently used to wrap gifts of money or other objects. Special red packets ( in Mandarin or lai see in Cantonese) are specifically used during Chinese New Year celebrations for giving monetary gifts. On the more negative side, obituaries are traditionally written in red ink, and to write someone's name in red signals either cutting them out of one's life, or that they have died. Red is also associated with either the feminine or the masculine (yin and yang respectively), depending on the source. The Little Red Book, a collection of quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung, founding father of the People's Republic of China (PRC), was published in 1966 and widely distributed thereafter. In Japan, red is a traditional color for a heroic figure. In the Indian subcontinent, red is the traditional color of bridal dresses, and is frequently represented in the media as a symbolic color for married women. The color is associated with purity, as well as with sexuality in marital relationships through its connection to heat and fertility. It is also the color of wealth, beauty, and the goddess Lakshmi. In Central Africa, Ndembu warriors rub themselves with red paint during celebrations. Since their culture sees the color as a symbol of life and health, sick people are also painted with it. Like most Central African cultures, the Ndembu see red as ambivalent, better than black but not as good as white. In other parts of Africa, however, red is a color of mourning, representing death. Because red bears are associated with death in many parts of Africa, the Red Cross has changed its colors to green and white in parts of the continent. The early Ottoman Turks led by the first Ottoman Sultan, Osman I, carried red banners symbolizing sovereignty, Ghazis and Sufism, until, according to legend, he saw a new red flag in his dream inlaid with a crescent. In Russian culture the color red plays a significant role since days of Old Russia. It is so significant in the Russian folk culture and history that in ancient Russian language the words for beautiful and red (Russian: –ö—Ä–∞—Å–Ω—ã, Krasny) were completely identical. But even in the modern Russian language, the terms for red and beautiful are strongly connected linguistically and are omnipresent in everyday usage. The color is perceived in Russia as the color of beauty, good and something honorable. Krasny (Russian: –ö—Ä–∞—Å–Ω—ã) means red and krasivyy (Russian:–∫—Ä–∞—Å–∏–≤—ã–π) means beautiful in modern Russian. The word for a beautiful girl or a beautiful woman in modern Russian language is kras√°vica (Russian: –∫—Ä–∞—Å–∞–≤–∏—Ü–∞), while a beautiful or good guy is called kras√°vƒçik (Russian: –∫—Ä–∞—Å–∞ÃÅ–≤—á–∏–∫). To describe a lovely girl or a woman the word prekrasnaya (Russian: –ø—Ä–µ–∫—Ä–∞—Å–Ω–∞—è) is used and prekrasnyy (Russian: –ø—Ä–µ–∫—Ä–∞—Å–Ω—ã–π) is used for guys. Many places in Russia are also associated with the color red, like for example the Red Square or the city Krasnodar. Red is a predominant color on Russian folk costumes like the Sarafan and handicrafts like the Rushnyk and Khokhloma. Red roses appear on women's folk costumes, on men's hats during folk dances and on traditional Russian shawls. Red berries like the Viburnum opulus are an important component of Russian folk culture which occur in many Russian folk songs, while Kalinka is the most famous of them. Also, Easter eggs in Russia are often colored in red and the color plays a big role in the Russian Orthodox Church, like for example on the Russian icons. In Russia the word color, to paint or to dye means kr√°sit π (Russian: –∫—Ä–∞ÃÅ—Å–∏—Ç—å) which is also connected to red (Krasny, Krasna, Russian: –ö—Ä–∞—Å–Ω—ã, –∫—Ä–∞ÃÅ—Å–Ω–∞).

Once married, the bride will wear a sari with a red border, changing it to a white sari if her husband dies. In Pakistan and India, some brides traditionally also have their hands and feet painted red with henna by the family of their new spouse, to bring happiness and signify their new status.

In religion  * In Christianity, red is associated with the blood of Christ and the sacrifice of martyrs. In the Roman Catholic Church it is also associated with pentecost and the Holy Spirit. Since 1295, it is the color worn by Cardinals, the senior clergy of the Roman Catholic Church. Red is the liturgical color for the feasts of martyrs, representing the blood of those who suffered death for their faith. It is sometimes used as the liturgical color for Holy Week, including Palm Sunday and Good Friday, although this is a modern (20th-century) development. In Catholic practice, it is also the liturgical color used to commemorate the Holy Spirit (for this reason it is worn at Pentecost and during Confirmation masses). Because of its association with martyrdom and the Spirit, it is also the color used to commemorate the Apostles (except for the Apostle St. John, who was not martyred, where white is used), and as such, it is used to commemorate bishops, who are the successors of the Apostles (for this reason, when funeral masses are held for bishops, cardinals, or popes, red is used instead of the white that would ordinarily be used). * In Buddhism, red is one of the five colors which are said to have emanated from the Buddha when he attained enlightenment, or nirvana. It is particularly associated with the benefits of the practice of Buddhism; achievement, wisdom, virtue, fortune and dignity. It was also believed to have the power to resist evil. In China red was commonly used for the walls, pillars, and gates of temples. * In the Shinto religion of Japan, the gateways of temples, called torii, are traditionally painted vermilion red and black. The torii symbolizes the passage from the profane world to a sacred place. The bridges in the gardens of Japanese temples are also painted red (and usually only temple bridges are red, not bridges in ordinary gardens), since they are also passages to sacred places. Red was also considered a color which could expel evil and disease.

Courtly love, the red rose, and Saint Valentine's Day  Red is the color most commonly associated with love, followed at a great distance by pink. It the symbolic color of the heart and the red rose, is closely associated with romantic love or courtly love and Saint Valentine's Day. Both the Greeks and the Hebrews considered red a symbol of love as well as sacrifice. The Roman de la Rose, the Romance of the Rose, a thirteenth-century French poem, was one of the most popular works of literature of the Middle Ages. It was the allegorical search by the author for a red rose in an enclosed garden, symbolizing the woman he loved, and was a description of love in all of its aspects. Later, in the 19th century, British and French authors described a specific language of flowers ‚Äì giving a single red rose meant 'I love you'. Saint Valentine, a Roman Catholic Bishop or priest who was martyred in about 296 AD, seems to have had no known connection with romantic love, but the day of his martyrdom on the Roman Catholic calendar, Saint Valentine's Day (February 14), became, in the 14th century, an occasion for lovers to send messages to each other. In recent years the celebration of Saint Valentine' s day has spread beyond Christian countries to Japan and China and other parts of the world. The celebration of Saint Valentine's Day is forbidden or strongly condemned in many Islamic countries, including Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Iran. In Saudi Arabia, in 2002 and 2011, religious police banned the sale of all Valentine's Day items, telling shop workers to remove any red items, as the day is considered a Christian holiday.

Happiness, celebration and ceremony  Red is the color most commonly associated with joy and well being. It is the color of celebration and ceremony. A red carpet is often used to welcome distinguished guests. Red is also the traditional color of seats in opera houses and theaters. Scarlet academic gowns are worn by new Doctors of Philosophy at degree ceremonies at Oxford University and other schools. In China, it is considered the color of good fortune and prosperity, and it is the color traditionally worn by brides. In Christian countries, it is the color traditionally worn at Christmas by Santa Claus, because in the 4th century the historic Saint Nicholas was the Greek Christian Bishop of Myra, in modern-day Turkey, and bishops then dressed in red.

Jonathan G Meath portrays Santa Claus.jpgSanta Claus traditionally wears red, because the original Saint Nicholas was a bishop of the Greek Christian church in the 4th century. = Courage and sacrifice = Surveys show that red is the color most associated with courage. In western countries red is a symbol of martyrs and sacrifice, particularly because of its association with blood. Beginning in the Middle Ages, the Pope and Cardinals of the Roman Catholic Church wore red to symbolize the blood of Christ and the Christian martyrs. The banner of the Christian soldiers in the First Crusade was a red cross on a white field, the St. George's Cross. According to Christian tradition, Saint George was a Roman soldier who was a member of the guards of the Emperor Diocletian, who refused to renounce his Christian faith and was martyred. The Saint George's Cross became the Flag of England in the 16th century, and now is part of the Union Flag of the United Kingdom, as well as the Flag of the Republic of Georgia. In 1587, Mary, Queen of Scots, accused of treason against Queen Elizabeth I, wore a red shirt at her execution, to proclaim that she was an innocent martyr. The Thin Red Line was a famous incident in the Battle of Balaclava (1854) during the Crimean War, when a thin line of Scottish Highlander infantry, assisted by Royal Marines and Turkish infantrymen, repulsed a Russian cavalry charge. It was widely reported in the British press as an example of courage in the face of overwhelming odds and became a British military legend. In the 19th-century novel The Red Badge of Courage by Stephen Crane, a story about the American Civil War, the red badge was the blood from a wound, by which a soldier could prove his courage.

History  The church is standing on top of a morainic hill called Bia≈Ça G√≥ra (en. White Mountain) which holds evidence of settlement since the Roman era.

The church was started being built most likely in the second half of the 12th century funded by duke Leszek, son of Boles≈Çaw IV the Curly, thanks to the salt mines profit. Rock nave and presbytery were built first. The foundations were intentionally laid on five symmetrical skeletons. Such undertaking was probably connected to the Christian relics cult intertwined with the contemporary pagan folk cult of a so-called 'building sacrifice'. Brick towers were built in the second phase of construction work at the beginning of the 13th century.

It is also called as ‡§ó‡§æ‡§®‡•ç‡§ß‡§æ‡§∞ or ‡§ó‡§Ç‡§ß‡§æ‡§∞. More information and importance of Gandhara The following is the information about Gandhara and its importance in Indian classical music: * Gandhara is the third svara in an octave or Saptak. * Gandhara is the immediate next svara of ·πöi·π£abha (Re). * The svara of Gandhara is Komal and Shuddha. * It is said that Sadja is the basic svara from which all the other 6 svaras are produced. When we break the word Sadja then we get, Shad And Ja. It means that Shad is 6 and ja is 'giving birth' in Marathi.https://saxonianfolkways.wordpress.com/2013/01/30/the-7-shadows-of- shadja So basically the translation is : ‡§∑‡§°‡•ç - 6, ‡§ú -‡§ú‡§®‡•ç‡§Æ . Therefore, it collectively means giving birth to the other 6 notes of the music. So the svara Ga is formed from Sadja. * The frequency of Gandhara is 300 Hz. The frequencies of the 7 svaras are also given below: Sa 240 Hz, Re 270 Hz, Ga 300 Hz, Ma 320 Hz, Pa 360 Hz, Dha 400 Hz, and Ni 450 Hz, Sa 480 Hz (Taar Saptak) ........ (and so on). Consequently, the Ga after the Re of 540 Hz (Taar Saptak) has a frequency of 600 Hz i.e. the double of the Lower octave Ga. * There are Shruti's of Gandhara. Previously the main Shruti, not only for Ga but for all the other svaras, was on the last Shruti but now it is considered to be on the 1st Shurti. For example, if these are the 2 Shruti's of Ga then, Previously this was the position of the main Shruti of Ga. ^ 1 2 ^ But now this position has become the main Shruti of Ga. * All the other svaras except Sadja(Sa) and Pancham (Pa) can be Komal or Tivra svaras but Sa and Pa are always Shuddha svaras. And hence svaras Sa and Pa are called Achal Svaras , since these svaras don't move from their original position. Svaras Ra, Ga, Ma, Dha, Ni are called Chal Svaras, since these svaras move from their original position. Sa, Re, Ga, Ma, Pa, Dha, Ni - Shuddha Svaras Re, Ga, Dha, Ni - Komal Svaras Ma - Tivra Svaras * Ragas from Kafi Thaat, Asavari Thaat, Todi Thaat and Bhairavi Thaat have Komal Gandhara. * Ragas where Ga is the Vadi svara - Raga Kafi (raga), raga Bageshri, raga Bhoopali etc. Ragas where Ga is the Samvadi svara - Raga Sohni, etc. * Hypothetically speaking, Ga is said to be the Gandharvas, Gandharvas as in, the three main gods, Bhrama, Vishnu and Shiva were first created i.e. Sakar Bhrama (Sa) and then these three gods created Rishimuni i.e. Re and then Gandharvas were created for singing.

The film stars Adama Niane, St√©phane Caillard and Paul Hamy in the lead roles. It was released in France on 6 November 2019 and received positive reviews from critics. It was later released on Netflix on 1 May 2020 coinciding with May Day. Plot Upon returning home from their motor-homing vacation, Paul (Adama Niane), his wife Chlo√© (St√©phane Caillard), and their son Louis (Matthieu Kacou), find their house occupied by squatters who refuse to leave, claiming that it is in fact their house (even having changed the names on the voicemail and mailbox). It is soon revealed that the squatters are Sabrina (Marie Bourin) (the family's regular childminder) and her partner Eric (Hubert Delattre), whom after recently being made homeless, had come to an informal agreement with the family to stay in their home whilst they were on holiday. With all parties having signed a document agreeing to the unspecific occupancy of the house, the police claim the family have no legal right to formally evict the squatters, and could be accused of assault should they enforce eviction themselves. Defeated, the family resort to living from their motorhome, in a local, largely abandoned, campsite owned by the insouciant Mickey (Paul Hamy) (an old school-friend of Chlo√©). After increasingly unhelpful meetings with their solicitor, and hopes of regaining their home dwindling with the ever-delayed court dates, Paul grows increasingly frustrated and seeks comfort in Mickey and his equally carefree friends. Feeling the threat of constant emasculation and insecurity regarding his race, at both work and home, Paul looks to Mickey for guidance in establishing dominance over his life. Mickey candidly tells Paul he believes he is \\"choosing to be a victim\\" of his predicament, and encourages him to start taking charge of his life. Following several wild late-night parties out with Mickey's friends, Paul grows accustomed to their anarchic, often male- chauvinistic, way of life, and follows their advice to take back control through increasingly severe means. In an attempt to intimidate, Paul permanently parks the motorhome in their backyard, claiming the squatters can't legally force them to leave either as they are still tenants too. Growing worried for her husband's stability, Chlo√© visits Mickey and warns him to stay away from Paul - wherein it is revealed that the pair previously shared an intimate relationship, and likely had an affair whilst Paul and Chlo√© have been married. Ignoring Chlo√©'s threats, Mickey takes Paul out one last time - however Paul becomes disgusted and overwhelmed when (in a drunken, drug-fuelled state) he accepts oral sex from a strange woman at a party, and tells Mickey he doesn't want to see him anymore. Mickey punches Paul, claiming \\"he is not man enough\\", and he and his friends leave Paul on the side of the road. Later that same night, sat quietly in their motorhome overlooking their house, Paul and Chlo√© are shocked to see Mickey and his friends storm the house, armed with Molotov cocktails and baseball bats. When confronted by Paul, Mickey simply tells him \\"I'll take your house...as you can't do it yourself.\\", and embracing his lawless nature, decides to smash and burn the entire house for recklessness' sake. After being confronted by Eric, Mickey viciously beats him with a baseball bat, to a bloody pulp, before he and his friends attack Paul and Chlo√© in a similar fashion. As Paul retains some consciousness, he watches helplessly as Mickey's friends proceed to gleefully destroy the family's belongings. Fully aware that Paul will not attempt to fight him, Mickey humiliates him by mounting and stripping the semi-conscious, bloodied Chlo√© - meanwhile Mickey's friends have proceeded to torture Sabrina and Eric by forcibly vacuum packing them, essentially slowly suffocating them. While the gang are distracted by Sabrina's torture, Paul manages to hide Chlo√© safely in a closet, and sneaks outside to the motorhome, wherein he drives at high-speed into the side of the house, successfully crashing through the wall and knocking down a few of Mickey's friends on the other side. Managing to ambush Franck (Eddy Leduc) from under the motorhome, Paul brutally smashes his skull with a brick. Now, faced only with Mickey, he is able to lure him inside the motorhome, where he has laid a trap. Having severed the main gas pipe, and with Mickey locked inside, Paul manages to throw a Molotov cocktail at the vehicle, causing it to explode. Miraculously, (although weak and severely burned) Mickey stumbles from the burning motorhome and attacks Paul. Chlo√© sneaks behind Mickey and is able to temporarily incapacitate him, using a pressure washer, before Paul mercilessly beats him with a baseball bat, as Chlo√© looks on horrified. As Paul looks down at Mickey's bloodied face, he sees a flash of his own face instead, before the body briefly springs back to life to utter, \\"There you are. You got your house back.\\", before falling down dead once more. The couple return, weeping, to the burning house to rescue Sabrina, only for Paul to glance back at Mickey's body to find he has completely vanished. Some time later, we see the family has successfully moved back into what remains of their home. After putting Louis to bed, the couple (both visually bruised and scarred) undress and engage in passionate sex, as the credits roll.

She separated from her spouse in 1763 and settled in Paris under the name and title . By the allowance and inheritance from her spouse, which was founded on diamond mines and slave plantations in Dutch Surinam, she was very rich. She was at one point the lover of minister √âtienne Fran√ßois, duc de Choiseul, who collaborated with the Emmanuel-Armand de Richelieu, duc d'Aiguillon to depose the king's mistress Madame Dubarry by arranging an affair between the king and Pater and suggest that he enter into a secret morganatic marriage with her. The plot failed but attracted attention and is documented in contemporary letters.

Republic of Sudan, 590 U.S. ___ (2020), was a United States Supreme Court case involving the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act with its 2008 amendments, whether plaintiffs in federal lawsuits against foreign countries may seek punitive damages for cause of actions prior to enactment of the amended law, with the specific case dealing with victims and their families from the 1998 United States embassy bombings. The Court ruled unanimously in May 2020 that punitive damages can be sought from foreign nations in such cases for preenactment conduct. Background The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) was first enacted in 1976, generally treating foreign nations as having sovereign immunity from lawsuits within the United States but establishing conditions when a foreign state can be subject to judicial actions within the courts. FSIA has been amended over time to specify such conditions; relevant to this case, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 and the Flatow Amendment allowed lawsuits to be taken against those countries that enabled acts of state-sponsored terrorism as designated by the State Department. On August 7, 1998, more than 200 people were killed in simultaneous truck bombings of United States embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, including 12 American citizens, and thousands of others wounded. It was the first major attack of the al-Qaeda terrorist group. Families and relatives of the killed Americans and those Americans injured in the attack filed a federal civil lawsuit against Sudan, who since 1993 had been listed by the State Department as a state sponsor of terrorism, and had since been linked to supporting al-Qaeda. The case Owens v. Republic of Sudan was filed in 2001 in the United States Circuit Court of the District of Columbia. As Owens progressed, legal questions of whether punitive damages could be sought for state-sponsored terrorism acts were raised from other similar cases, with the United States Circuit Court of the District of Columbia having ruled in Cicippio-Puleo v. Islamic Republic of Iran (353 F.3d 1024 (2004)) that even with the 1996 amended FSIA, there was no cause of action that could be brought under FSIA to foreign states, only to individuals of foreign states. Congress sought to rectify the Cicippio-Puleo decision in passing the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 (NDAA 2008) by including language to modify FSIA's terrorism exceptions. Among its major changes, the terrorism exceptions were moved a new section ¬ß1605A to make specific actions related to terrorism more explicit from other general FSIA provisions, defined that foreign states that sponsored terrorism could be taken to court on cause of action, and that these provisions could apply to prior lawsuits that had been \\"adversely affected\\" by the lack of these provisions as well as to new actions on related lawsuits. With the NDAA 2008's passage in January 2008, numerous victims and families of those killed in the embassy bombings joined in the Owens suit or filed similar suits that were joined into the same action; ultimately, over 700 plaintiffs were on the final suit now under Opati v. Republic of Sudan. By 2014, the District Court entered its final judgement, awarding a total of in total damages for the plaintiffs, among which included as punitive damages. During the case's history, Sudan had sent counsel to continue to challenge its position as a state-sponsor of terrorism or its ties to the embassy bombings. It appealed the District Court's ruling on grounds that the revived FSIA rules as changed by the NDAA 2008 did not allow for punitive damages to applied retroactively. The DC Circuit Court, in 2017, agreed with Sudan's position, and while still upholding Sudan's liability, reversed a portion of the District Court's ruling, reducing the total damages to about . Supreme Court The plaintiffs in Opati petitioned the Supreme Court to review the case, which the Court accepted in June 2019; Justice Brett Kavanaugh, as a member of the DC Circuit Court at the time the case was heard there before being appointed to the Supreme Court, was recused. Oral arguments were held on February 24, 2020. Court observers saw the Justices were focused primarily on the contradictions in Sudan's counsel's argument that punitive damages should not apply retroactively while compensatory damages should. The Court delivered its ruling on May 18, 2020. The unanimous ruling, written by Justice Neil Gorsuch, vacated the DC Circuit's ruling, restoring the punitive award vacated by the District Court decision, and remanded the case back to the lower court. Gorsuch wrote that while the amendments were not explicit, \\"Congress was as clear as it could have been when it authorized plaintiffs to seek and win punitive damages for past conduct\\" in the 2008 language.

Set in the Scottish Borders in 1685 it presents a sympathetic picture of the persecuted Covenanters and a harsh view of the Royalists led by Clavers (Claverhouse). It draws extensively on local superstitions. Background It is not known for certain when Hogg composed The Brownie of Bodsbeck. It may have been in existence, or at least in contemplation, as early as 1813.James Hogg, The Brownie of Bodsbeck, ed. Douglas S. Mack (Edinburgh and London, 1976), xv‚Äíxvi. The work was probably one of The Rural and Traditional Tales of Scotland that Hogg informed William Blackwood at the beginning of 1817 were ready to be printed.The Collected Letters of James Hogg: Volume 1 1800‚Äí1819, ed. Gillian Hughes (Edinburgh, 2004), 289: Hogg to Blackwood, 4 January 1817. Compare Hogg's further letter to Blackwood of 13 January 1818 on the same subject and specifically mentioning The Brownie: ibid., 325‚Äí26. The Brownie was making its way through the press in January 1818, and it is clear from Hogg's letters to Blackwood that the material he is providing in batches consists of a transcription of an earlier manuscript: the amount of revision is unspecified.Ibid., 325 (13 January 1818) and 329 (31 January 1818). The date of composition of The Brownie is particularly important because Hogg claimed that, contrary to popular assumption, his novel was composed before the very different treatment of the period by Walter Scott in Old Mortality, which appeared in December 1816 with a much less sympathetic view of the Covenanters and a distinctly less harsh depiction of Claverhouse.James Hogg, 'Memoir of the Author's Life' in Altrive Tales, ed. Gillian Hughes (Edinburgh, 2003), 45‚Äí46. Compare Familiar Anecdotes of Sir Walter Scott in James Hogg, Anedcotes of Scott, ed. Jill Rubenstein (Edinburgh, 1999), 51. Plot summary Compassion leads Walter Laidlaw, a man of no strong religious views, to assist a group of Covenanters in hiding near his farm of Chapelhope. Unknown to him, his daughter Katharine is also helping them, drawing on local superstition to cast their leader in the role of Brownie. She discovers a fellow Covenanting sympathiser in a recently engaged servant, old Nanny Elshinder. Taken into custody by Clavers, Walter witnesses the commander's harsh behaviour before himself escaping sentence of death by defying witnesses for the prosecution at his trial. On his return to Chapelhope he is introduced by his daughter to the Covenanters, their leader being John Brown of Caldwell who is revealed to be Nanny's long-lost husband. Editions The Brownie of Bodsbeck; and Other Tales. By James Hogg, Author of \\"The Queen's Wake,\\" &c.; &c.; was published in two volumes in 1818 by William Blackwood, Edinburgh and John Murray, London. The two other tales were short stories, or novellas: 'The Wood-gatherer', revised from its original publication as 'The Country Laird. A Tale by John Miller' in Hogg's periodical The Spy Nos 24‚Äí26 (February 1811); and 'The Hunt of Eildon', published for the first time. In 'The Wool-gatherer' a young modern laird befriends and eventually marries the secret wife of his late brother and mother of that brother's son. 'The Hunt of Eildon', a virtuoso display of medieval enchantment and shape-changing, centres on the beneficent actions of two innocent young women who have been changed into hounds with supernatural powers. The Brownie of Bodsbeck was included in the first volume of the posthumous Tales and Sketches, by The Ettrick Shepherd, 6 vols (Glasgow, 1837). 'The Wool-gatherer' also appeared in the first volume, and 'The Hunt of Eildon' was included in the third. It is likely that some of the substantive changes for The Brownie in this edition had been made by Hogg.The Collected Letters of James Hogg': Volume 3 1832 to 1835, ed. Gillian Hughes (Edinburgh, 2008), 193: Hogg to Blackie & Son, 11 November 1833); Mack, op. cit., xxiii‚Äíxxiv. The Brownie of Bodsbeck was edited by Douglas S. Mack in 1976 (Edinburgh and London), taking the first edition as copy-text but restoring manuscript readings and incorporating a small number of revisions from the 1837 edition so as to respect what are judged to have been Hogg's intentions. Chapter summary Ch. 1: Walter Laidlaw of Chapelhope is told by his wife Maron that their daughter Katharine has been ordering her Brownie to kill five of Clavers' Highland troopers. Ch. 2: (Chs 2‚Äí4 fill in the background to Ch. 1) The narrator indicates that Maron, unlike Walter, is much influenced by a local curate. Clavers loses five of his men sent to hunt down the Covenanters who had taken refuge in the area. Ch. 3: The reader is told, in Walter's own words, how he took compassion on a group of the Covenanters and provided them regularly with food. Ch. 4: Continuing Walter's story, the narrator tells how he persuaded the Covenanters to stay in the area when they declined to put him in danger by continuing to accept his bounty. Ch. 5: Katharine's Brownie scares most of the servants away from Chapelhope. Fearing her own expulsion she consults old Nanny Elshinder, a recently engaged servant, but finds her uncommunicative: Nanny waits till she thinks Katharine is out of hearing before singing an explicitly covenanting song. Ch. 6: Clavers and his men arrive and examine in turn Nanny, Katharine (defended physically by her father), and finally Maron who reveals the Covenanters' hiding-place. Ch. 7: Clavers arrests the Laidlaws and subjects a shepherd to harsh questioning about the deaths of the five Highland troopers. Ch. 8: Clavers stages a mock execution of the two Laidlaw boys to elicit information. Ch. 9: Walter's family is released but he is forced to accompany Clavers and witnesses a number of severe actions, including the execution of a number of Covenanters. Ch. 10: The Brownie saves Katharine from an assault by the curate. Preparing to leave Chapelhope to seek help for her father from the laird of Drumelzier she entrusts the house to Nanny, whose covenanting credentials are now made clear, with instructions to admit one or two Covenanters every night. Ch. 11: Katharine finds Drumelzier helpful, but on her return she discovers that Chapelhope has been deserted as haunted. Walter and his fellow-prisoners are transferred from the custody of a fair-minded Highlander Sergeant Daniel Roy Macpherson to less sympathetic officers to be taken to Edinburgh. Ch. 12: The vacation of Chapelhope is explained: Nanny had seen the curate confronted by the Brownie and attendant spirits, resulting in his disappearance. Katharine and Nanny engage in Covenanting discourse. At the neighbouring Riskinhope farm, where she has taken refuge, Nanny joins the inhabitants in prayer (led with peculiar eloquence by the shepherd Davie Tait) and sacred song, after the inadvertent raising of a spirit. Ch. 13: Davie Tait discovers that the Brownie has been carrying out part of the reaping, and a week later it is discovered that the job has been completed, and then that the dirty and laborious job of smearing the sheep has also been accomplished. Ch. 14: At the end of his trial in Edinburgh, Walter is released on bail, after he defies his accusers in the king's name, following advice given by Sergeant Macpherson who now happily maintains that the Laidlaws and Macphersons are related. Ch. 15: On Halloween Walter returns home, in spite of supernatural warnings, and looking in through a window sees Katharine and the Brownie with a fresh corpse. He takes refuge at Riskinhope with Davie Tait. Ch. 16: Katharine leads her father to a concealed cave where the Brownie and his companions are identified as John Brown of Caldwell and other Covenanters. Ch. 17: In the concluding explanations, John Brown is revealed to be Nanny's long- lost husband.

Bartholomew (or Barth√©lemy) d'Arabin fled France after the revocation of the edict of Nantes in 1685. He settled in Ireland, where his descendants remained until the mid-19th century. Other members of the Arabin family settled in Germany, where their descendants still live. In the 19th century many of the Irish and British Arabins moved to Australia.  French ancestry  Two sons of Jean Arabin, an innkeeper in the small town of Corps - Laurent (known as \\"Captain Arabin\\") and Salomon (known as \\"Captain Roure\\") - distinguished themselves fighting on the Protestant side in the 16th-century wars of religion in Provence. A third brother, Barth√©lemy, was probably the grandfather of Jean, a prosperous draper at Riez in the present- day Alpes-de-Haute region of Provence and father of the later Barth√©lemy.  Barth√©lemy d'Arabin  Bartholomew (or Barth√©lemy) d'Arabin de Barcelles (d. 20/1/1712 or 1713) fled to Switzerland and then the Netherlands after the revocation of the edict of Nantes in 1685. Barth√©lemy enrolled in the Duke of Schomberg's cavalry regiment and came to England with King William III in 1688. He fought at the Battle of the Boyne in Ireland, 1690, where the Duke of Schomberg was killed. Barth√©lemy then served under the Marquis of Ruvigny (created Earl of Galway by William III) in Flanders (1692-97) and in Piedmont, Italy, where he was aide-de-camp to Ruvigny. In 1699 his regiment was disbanded and on 15 July 1699, at St Andrew's Church, Dublin, he married Jeanne Ren√©e de St-Julien, a daughter of Pierre St-Julien de Malacar√©, another Huguenot refugee and former Lord of Malacar√©, near Bordeaux, and Vitr√© in Brittany. Bartholomew was associated with the Huguenot settlement of 1694 in Portarlington, County Laois.FAMILY HISTORY: ARABIN of CORKAGH & MOYGLARE  Irish and British Arabins  * Colonel John (or Jean) Arabin, (1703-1757), son of Bartholomew, raised the 57th (West Middlesex) Regiment of Foot in 1755 for service in the Seven Years' War.

Radiometric dating gives it an age of 1.85 million to 72 thousand years, corresponding to the Pleistocene epoch.

This has produced a long-lived volcanic field, with the earliest eruptions beginning at least 13 million years ago in both the northern (Polvadera Group) and southern (Keres Group) portions of the volcanic field.Heiken et al. 1990 High-silica eruptions of the Tewa Group began about 1.85 million years ago and continued almost to the present dayZimmerer et al. 2016 The Tewa Group is a sequence of mostly rhyolite pyroclastic flows and domes that underlies much of the Valles Caldera and forms extensive outflow sheets surrounding the caldera. It has a maximum thickness of . It overlies the Santa Fe, Keres, and Polvadera Groups to the east and south of the caldera and older rocks ranging in age from Paleoproterozoic to Permian to the west and north. It forms the upper surfaces of the Pajarito Plateau east of the caldera and the Jemez Plateau west of the caldera. There is geochemical evidence that the Tewa Group originated through rejuvenation of intrusions associated with the Paliza Canyon Formation of the Keres Group.Rowe et al. 2007 = Formations = From oldest to youngest, the formations recognized within the Polvadera Group are the Bandelier Tuff, the Cerro Toledo Formation, and the Valles Rhyolite. However, the Pueblo Canyon Member of the Cerro Toledo Formation was deposited between the Otowi Member and Tsherige Member of the Bandelier Tuff. The Bandelier Tuff is a sequence of rhyolitic pyroclastic flows erupted in three caldera eruptions, at 1.85 Ma (La Cueva Member), 1.62 Ma (Toledo event; Otowi Member), and 1.25 Ma (Valles event; Tsherige Member). These form a vast outflow sheet surrounding the Jemez Mountains.Dethier and Kampf, 2015 The Cerro Toledo Formation consists of rhyolitic domes erupted in the Toledo Embayment, a structural feature in the northeast caldera rim, between the Toledo and Valles events. It also includes ring fracture dome remnants of the Toledo event and mixed pumice and sediment beds separating the Otowi and Tsherige Members (Pueblo Canyon Member). Ages range from 1.54 Ma for the west Los Posos dome to 1.20 Ma at Pinnacle Peak.Dethier and Kampf, 2015Goff et al. 2011, pp.22-23 File:Pueblo Canyon Member.jpgPueblo Canyon Member north of Los Alamos The Valles Rhyolite consists of rhyolite domes and flows associated with caldera resurgence and with the ring fracture of the Valles event.Dethier and Kampf, 2015 It includes the most recent eruptions in the Jemez Mountains, ending with the Banco Bonito flow.Zimmerer et al. 2016 The earliest members, the Deer Canyon Member and Redondo Creek Member, are associated with resurgence, with argon-argon ages of 1.23 to 1.28 Ma. The Cerro del Medio Member (1.169-1.229 Ma), Cerros del Abrigo Member (0.973 Ma), Cerro Santa Rosa Member (0.787-0.936 Ma), Cerro San Luis Member (0.800 Ma), Cerro Seco Member (0.800 to 0.77 Ma), San Antonio Mountain Member (0.557 Ma), and South Mountain Member (0.52 to 0.53 Ma) are individual ring fracture dome complexes that show a progression in age counterclockwise along the presumed ring fracture of the Valles caldera.Goff et al. 2011, pp.19-20 The El Cajete, Battleship Rock, and Banco Bonito flows are the youngest flows in the Jemez volcanic field, erupting from 77.4 to 68.3 ka.Zimmerer et al. 2016 File:Deer Canyon Rhyolite.jpgExposures of Deer Canyon Member on the east flank of Redondo Peak File:El Cajete Bandelier Wilderness.jpgBeds of unconsolidated El Cajete Pumice in western Bandelier National Monument File:Banco Bonito.jpgthumbEast face of Banco Bonito flow at El Cajete vent File:Redondo Creek Rhyolite.jpgthumbRedondo Creek Member at Thompson Ridge The quartz latite of Cerro Rubio, originally included in the Tewa Group, has been reassigned to the Tschicoma Formation of the Polvadera Group based on radiometric dating and geochemisry.Gardner et al. 1986Goff et al. 2011, p.23 History of investigation The group was first defined by Griggs in 1964 his study of groundwater resources near the town of Los Alamos, New Mexico.

History  The 94th Separate Rifle Brigade (Second formation) was formed as part of the 13th Rifle Corps of the Transcaucasian Front between 24 February and 15 April 1943 at Sukhumi, from two separate mountain rifle detachments, and was brought up to strength with conscripts of the 1926 draft class. It included three rifle battalions and submachine gun, 107 mm mortar, anti-tank gun, and artillery battalions as well as smaller support units. Colonel Shalva Melkadze, the Georgian deputy commander of the nearby 406th Rifle Division, became commander on 5 March. The brigade was responsible for the defense of the Black Sea coast in the vicinity of Sukhumi from Primorskoye to the mouth of the Rion River, with elements based at Sukhumi, Novy Afon, Ochamchire, and Beslakhuba. In 1943, the brigade sent five march companies to provide replacements for units engaged in combat. By September of that year, the brigade was almost at full strength, though only 32% of its personnel had combat experience in the war. It was ethnically mixed, with 24% Russians, 21% Azerbaijanis, 20% Georgians, and 16.8% Armenians. Melkadze was transferred to serve as deputy commander of the neighbouring 392nd Rifle Division in February 1944, and was succeeded by Lieutenant Colonel Georgy Shchadin, the former chief of staff of a tank brigade, who was promoted to colonel on 3 February 1945. The 407th was ordered formed from the 94th Brigade on 21 August 1945, the first rifle division formed after the end of the war in Europe. The 407th included the 699th, 701st, and 704th Rifle Regiments, and the 607th Divisional Artillery Brigade with the 2333rd Gun Artillery Regiment, the 2334th Howitzer Artillery Regiment, and the 496th Mortar Regiment, in addition to smaller support units. Separate artillery battalions were the 876th Self-Propelled, the 873rd Anti-Tank Battalion, and the 1124th Anti-Aircraft. Shchadin continued in command of the division until September, when he became deputy commander after Major General Aleksandr Pykhtin, a combat experienced division commander, arrived to take command. The division was headquartered at Sukhumi and most of its units were also stationed there, excepting the 701st Regiment at Novy Afon on the coast to the northwest, the 496th Mortar Regiment at Ochamchire on the coast to the southeast, and the 699th Rifle Regiment and the 856th Separate Self-Propelled Artillery Battalion with SU-76 self-propelled guns at Beslakhuba inland to the northeast of Ochamchire. By late September, it had 5,139 officers and men out of an authorized peacetime strength of 5,500. It was disbanded by mid-1946 along with the other division of the corps, the 392nd. Two divisions were soon transferred to the corps to replace the 392nd and 407th. The 407th may have been disbanded as early as January and February, when both Shchadin and Pykhtin were reassigned.

Life Charles Forster Smith, the son of Pastor James F. Smith and his wife Julia Forster Smith, studied at Wofford College (A.B. 1872), Harvard University and then from 1874 to 1875 at the universities in Leipzig and Berlin. He then taught as a professor of Classical and German Philology at Wofford College (1875-1879) and again deepened his studies in Leipzig, where in 1881 he wrote a doctoral thesis in English for a Dr. Phil. which he was awarded. After completing his doctorate, Smith worked at various universities in the United States: from 1881 as Professor of Latin and Greek at Williams College, from 1882 as Professor of Modern Foreign Languages at Vanderbilt University and from 1884 as Professor of Greek (from 1894 of all classical philology) at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. He was a longstanding board member of the American Philological Association (president in 1902/03) and in 1905/06 he was co-editor of The Classical Journal. He retired in 1917, but remained scientifically and journalistically active. In 1919, his colleagues published a commemorative publication in his honor at the University of Wisconsin. In his research, Smith dealt with both ancient languages and modern language phenomena (for example, the dialect of the Southern States). Throughout his life, he endeavored to improve higher education in the United States, which had only enabled higher degrees in a few places during his own time as a student. Smith's research focus was the Greek historian Thucydides, about whom Smith published scientific essays, selected editions, and finally a bilingual (Greek-English) edition in the Loeb Classical Library (1919-1923), which remained in use for a long time.

Background  In 1974, Ms. Magazine decided that it could reach an even wider audience if they produced a television program.Liza Baskin. (31 January 2013). ‚ÄúWhen Ms. Had Its Own TV Show‚Äù. Ms. Magazine. The show was to celebrate women's empowerment by exploring a variety of subjects, including women in politics and sports, job discrimination, and gender differences. The format of the show was meant to mimic a magazine, and featured short documentaries, usually made by independent, women film makers, mixed with short commentaries by and about women, as well as entertainment features of women in the performing arts.O‚ÄôConnor, John. (22 October 1975). TV: ‚ÄòWoman Alive!‚Äô New York Times. Ms. collaborated with Dallas' public broadcast station to create one pilot episode of Woman Alive!, and went on to collaborate with New York City's public broadcast station, Channel 13, for the following two series produced in 1975 and 1977.Woman Alive!

Pilot Episode  The initial episode of Woman Alive! was a one-hour special produced in cooperation with KERA-TV Dallas in 1974. The executive producer was Joan Shigekawa with associate producers Susan Lester and Candida Harper, and field producer Joan Fiore. The pilot episode consisted of several short documentaries, comedy sketches, interviews, and entertainment pieces, including: A short documentary about Pat and Charles Sackrey, Texas natives interviewed at their new home in Haydenville, Massachusetts about their attempt to improve their relationship; A discussion amongst women in Des Moines, Iowa about the obstacles inherent to being an individual woman; An interview with Gloria Steinem at the offices of Ms. Magazine; A round-table discussion amongst members of the National Black Feminist Organization about their historic first convention; A satirical comedy sketch by feminist comedian Lily Tomlin wherein she plays a television psychologist addressing the case of a distraught husband; and Melissa Manchester performing the songs \\"Home to Myself\\" and \\"O Heaven.\\"‚ÄúFeminini-TV‚Äù.

The executive producer was Ronnie Eldridge, the producer was Joan Shigekawa, the coordinating producer was Jacqueline Donnet, and the associate producer was Janis Klein. The New York Times reviewed this series, remarking that it was not militantly feminist in nature but rather appealed to a broad audience of American women, and while the New York Times remarked that Woman Alive! was trite at times, it also praised the show for its \\"impressive level of effectiveness.\\" The first episode of the 1975 series featured a short documentary called Army Wives: Change of Command, filmed by Patricia Sides at the Army base in Fort Sill, Oklahoma. The documentary explored the new consciousnesses of Army wives.  1977 Series  In 1977 the show went back on the air in New York through WNET. This series consisted of five episodes, which were sixty-minutes long each. Joan Shigekawa served as both executive producer and producers, while Jacqueline Donnet was coordinating producer and Janis Klein was associate producer. This was the final series of the show, which then went off the air. In 1986, Joan Shigekawa gave the records of Woman Alive! to Schlesinger Library in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Jefferson College was a college located in Convent, Louisiana, operating under various names between 1830 and 1928. As of 2020, the site is a Jesuit retreat center called Manresa House of Retreats, which, along with several historic homes in Convent, are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Among the alumni of the college was Etienne J. Caire, who owned the E. J. Caire Store in Edgard and was the Republican gubernatorial nominee in 1928 against Huey Long. Caire founded the Manresa retreat center in 1922. Another was U.S. Senator from Louisiana Walter Guion. Louisiana Supreme Court justices Samuel A. LeBlanc and William Gillespie Wyly also attended the school. The institution was established as the College of Jefferson in 1830, and chartered in 1831. The first building was completed in 1833, and the inaugural class began studies in 1834. Operation of the institution was sporadic for a time. The building burned down in 1842, and a new building was erected on the same foundation. American diplomat Alexander Hill Everett briefly served as its head in the 1840s. The institution then closed in 1848 due to low enrollment. A new institution operated in the location as Louisiana College from 1853 to 1856. In 1860, when it experienced financial difficulties and was on the verge of total collapse, plantation owner Valcour Aime rescued the complex by purchasing it.Fortier, Alcee, A History of Louisiana Volume 3 (1904). From 1860 to 1862, the campus operated for the first time under the name Jefferson College, and a chapel was added. From 1862 to 1864, the buildings were occupied by Federal troops. In July 1864, the institution again reopened as St. Mary's College of Jefferson. Aime gave the entire college to the Marist Fathers. According to some accounts, his motivation in securing this transfer to a sectarian entity was to prevent the state from obligating the school to open its doors to freed blacks. Another source states, as an alternative explanation, that Aime was merely \\"anxious to see the college re-opened\\", and therefore \\"gave his shares to the [priests] that they might conduct the school\\".De Bow's Review Vol. XI, page 437. The school thereafter operated continuously until it again closed in 1928 due to low enrollment.

Early life and education Madeleine Zabriskie Doty was born in Bayonne, New Jersey, August 24, 1877 to Samuel and Charlotte Zabriskie Doty. She received a B.L. from Smith College in 1900, an L.L.B. from New York University in 1902, and a Ph.D. in International Relations from Geneva University in 1934. Advocacy for prisoners After practicing law for five years in New York City, her interest turned to children's courts and delinquency and for three years she was secretary of the Russell Sage Foundation Children's Court Committee. As a member of New York's Prison Reform Commission in 1913, she voluntarily spent a week in prison to investigate conditions, adopting Maggie Martin as her alias. She described inhumane conditions in women's prisons, and advocated dramatic changes relating to prison management, prisoner autonomy, and prison activities. In addition to recommending improvements in food and sanitation, she advocated for the prisoners having a say in the way that the prisons were run. To that end, she proposed a system of prisoner self-government. Out of this experience she published Society's Misfits (1916) about juvenile and women's prison reform. After the publication of this text, New York State prison administrators experimented with some of her recommendations. Journalism Doty's pacifist principles placed her among an international circle of pacifist women who believed that women's exclusion from war-making councils gave them an objective view which made them more natural peacemakers than men. In 1915, with Jane Addams and forty-three other women from the U.S., she attended the Women's Peace Congress at The Hague. On this journey, she represented the Women‚Äôs Lawyers Association and worked as a reporter for Century Magazine and a special correspondent for the New York Evening Post. She then became a correspondent for the New York Tribune and Good Housekeeping. She reported from Hamburg, Germany for the Tribune in 1916, and reported that it was \\"like a dying city\\" as the citizens were starving. For Good Housekeeping, she traveled around the world and was in Russia during the 1917-1918 revolution. She published Short Rations: An American Woman In Germany in 1917 and Behind The Battle Line in 1918. Pacifism On her return to the U.S. in 1917, Doty became an editor with her friend Crystal Eastman of Four Lights, the radical paper of the New York Woman‚Äôs Peace Party. In a letter on January 13, 1917, to Dr. Maria Montessori, Fannie May Witherspoon, a Christian socialist and another co-editor of Four Lights, described the purpose of the paper as ‚Äústriking what seems to us a much-needed note of internationalism in these days of universal warfare and national strife ... the contributors will be chiefly women, and the issues of feminism and peace will naturally go hand in hand.‚Äù Reporting war news from a feminist and pacifist lens, it published articles featuring a ‚Äúgender-based critique of American society and democracy.‚Äù Doty continued to play a part in the peace movement first as International Secretary for the WILPF in Geneva, where she moved in 1925, then as editor of Pax International for the League of Nations. Marriage to Roger Baldwin In 1919 she married pacifist Roger Baldwin, who later founded the ACLU. Doty had been Crystal Eastman's roommate, which is how she met Baldwin. Doty and Baldwin literally vowed to maintain a \\"free marriage,\\" with neither requiring monogamy of the other. Doty retained her maiden name, had an active public career, supported herself financially, and employed a domestic servant to manage the reproduction of the household. However, they were divorced in 1925. Teaching and higher education administration In 1936, foreseeing the collapse of the League, Doty decided that the only way to secure world peace was through education of the young. She created and organized the first Geneva Junior Year Abroad program for the University of Delaware, 1938-1939. Because it was impossible to continue during World War II, she studied at the University of Geneva, receiving a Ph.D in International Relations in 1945 at the age of 66. After the war she returned to the U.S. and between 1946 and 1949 she organized and ran another Geneva Junior Year Abroad program for Smith College. Beginning in 1950 Doty taught history at Miss Harris's School in Florida. She retired at the age of 75. She returned to Geneva and lectured on American history at the University of Geneva until 1962 when she moved to Greenfield, Massachusetts, where she died October 14, 1963.

Dickinson served as a Tory Member of Parliament and was affiliated with the interest of the Duke of Bedford during his time in Parliament. Early life and career Dickinson was the third son of John Dickinson, a London merchant and his wife Elizabeth, daughter of fellow merchant Thomas Powell and goddaughter of Francis Marshe. Dickinson was baptised at the parish church of St Peter le Poer on Broad Street in the City of London in June 1703. Dickinson was educated at Westminster School until the age of fifteen in 1718 and later entered the Inner Temple before being called in 1728 after which he became a city attorney, later being listed as a practicing lawyer. Marriage and family In 1726, aged 23, he married Mary Cleve, daughter of Alexander Cleeve and his wife Mary, both of London. Dickinson remained married to his wife until her death in 1732 at the age of 29, after which he does not appear to have remarried. From his marriage Dickinson would have two children, Mary Marsh Dickinson born in 1728, and John Marsh Dickinson born in 1730. Dickinson's son later served as Surveyor of the Gardens and sat on the Board of Green Cloth but was convinced to give up the position to Richard Vernon in favour of a pension despite his father's unease at the proposal.George Grenville, Additional Grenville Papers, 1763‚Äì1765, p.125, Manchester University Press, (1962) Through his daughter, who married Robert Ball in 1751, Dickinson was the grandfather of officer Ingram Ball and Sir Alexander Ball, later Civil Commissioner of Malta. Municipal politics Dickinson was elected a common councillor in the City of London in 1738 and served until 1743. From 1749 until his death he served as an alderman, later becoming a Sheriff of London between 1751 and 1752, and serving a term as Lord Mayor of London between 1756‚Äì7. In London politics Dickinson was considered a moderate Tory and aligned with fellow alderman and Member of Parliament for the City of London Robert Ladbroke.DICKINSON, History of Parliament Online Dickinson served as Lord Mayor between in the year from 1756 which fell at the same time as the loss of Minorca. Under him the City address presented by mainly Tory aldermen including Ladbroke and Dickinson to King George II asked for 'the authors of our late losses and disappointments to be inquired and punished' which the King informed the city would be the case.DICKINSON, History of Parliament Online In March 1757 at the time of Admiral John Byng's trial and execution a handful of Tory aldermen attempted to gain Dickinson's support for a petition to spare Byng's life, which the Lord Mayor considered to be too late.DICKINSON, History of Parliament Online Byng was executed less than a week later. Westminster politics Dickinson was recommended in 1753 by the Duke of Bedford to his nephew the Duke of Bridgewater as a candidate to be brought into the next Parliament.DICKINSON, History of Parliament Online In 1754 he contested the seat of Brackley in Northamptonshire, a pocket borough of Bridgewater managed by his uncle. Dickinson contested the seat along with Henry Vernon, an outgoing MP for Lichfield who was also patronised by Bedford. The contest occurred while the young Duke of Bridgewater was on his Grand Tour which enabled a strong local opposition to form and organise behind a hitherto unknown outsider, Thomas Humberston. Bedford, fearing the loss of his nephew's interest in the seat authorised his election agents to spend anywhere up to two-thousand pounds to secure the election of the two pledged candidates. This proved difficult as the local opposition interest was alert and spent equally heavily, thus ensuring its success. Dickinson was easily returned, while Humberston narrowly outpolled Vernon. Humberston desired to consolidate his support in the borough, yet he would die a year later, allowing the seat to revert to the Bedford interest. In the House of Commons Dickinson sat as both a Tory and a Bedfordite at the same time, thus demonstrating the increasing strain that partisan labels were coming under by the midpoint of the 18th- century. Dickinson, like other Tories who owed their seats to Bedford, such as Robert Henley-Ongley were obliged to vote as the Duke pleased, unless issues of party principle intervened.Linda Colley, In Defiance of Oligarchy: The Tory Party 1714‚Äì60, p.270, Cambridge University Press, (1982) He was proposed as a candidate in London at the 1761 general election, but withdrew after failing to receive sufficient support and was returned unopposed as a Member for Brackley with Robert Wood, an Anglo-Irish antiquarian and fellow Bedfordite.Brackley, History of Parliament Online Dickinson was among the over one-hundred Tories returned at the election, the last time a coherent Tory party was present at a general election during this period.Lewis Namier, England in the Age of the American Revolution, pp.487‚Äì90, Macmillan, (1930) At the reconvening of Parliament in October 1761 Dickinson was discussed as a potential candidate of Speaker of the House of Commons along with fellow Tory Thomas Prowse, Member for Prowse.DICKINSON, History of Parliament OnlineBrian W. Hill, British Parliamentary Parties, 1742‚Äì1832, pp.95‚Äì6, Allen & Unwin, (1985) Ultimately Sir John Cust was elected unanimously to serve as the new Speaker of the House after the resignation of long-serving Speaker Arthur Onslow. Dickinson was, however, elected as the Chairman of Ways and Means in November 1761, a position he was deemed suited to on account of his links to merchants and finance.Namier, England, p.295, Macmillan, (1930) From this post he was paid a ¬£500 per annum stipend courtesy of the government's secret service funds.Namier, Structure, p.228, Macmillan, (1973) In Parliament Dickinson was mostly interested in pedestrian matters, with him intervening in debates on the Insolvent Debtors' Act in November 1761, a toll on London Bridge in February 1762, a debate in March 1762 where Bedford's interests were involved, and a debate on a 'fish bill' with exemptions for Covent Garden Market later in March 1763. On the earlier March debate, Lewis Namier quotes James Harris who noted: > A bill had come to us from the Lords about certain trust lands at Tavistock, > relating to the Duke of Bedford‚Äôs affairs, and which he had brought in. > There was a clause in it to declare that those lands were to convey no right > of voting in that borough. This got among the Commons as a breach of their > privileges, and the bill had certainly been flung out had not Alderman > Dickinson moved that it be withdrawn. He was mistaken in the manner of doing > this, by beginning that he had authority from a noble duke, etc. We want no > authority from noble dukes, nor from those greater than dukes, to empower us > to do our acts.DICKINSON, History of Parliament Online Dickinson's political positions were often dictated by Bedford, as in the case of the aforementioned 'fish bill' where Dickinson reported that he was awaiting the Duke's direction on how to progress with the bill.DICKINSON, History of Parliament Online The 1760s was a period in British politics characterised by ministerial instability, with a succession of seven short- lived ministries. This also coincided with the dissipating of the old Tory and Whig parties in favour of a series of personal parties constructed around leading political figures.Lewis Namier & John Brooke, The House of Commons: I, Introductory Survey, Constituencies, Appendices, pp.197‚Äì9, Oxford University Press, (1964) Dickinson was among the Tories who aligned under the Bedfordite faction, among the smaller factions in Parliament during this period.Hill, British, pp.236‚Äì8, Allen & Unwin, (1985) Dickinson generally followed the Bedfordite line and supported the Bute and Grenville ministries, which both included the Duke of Bedford within their ranks. Dickinson was a supporter of the peace preliminaries negotiated and agreed to by Bedford in Paris which brought the Seven Years' War to an end. Dickinson did, however, break with Bedford on occasion when his Tory principles or personal pride came into conflict with the Bedfordite line. A notable occasion of this was when Bedford attempted to convince Dickinson's son John to vacate his position on the Board of the Green Cloth in favour of Richard Vernon, with an assurance of a pension. The elder Dickinson viewed this as a slur upon his family, requesting Bedford desist and even appealed to King George III for assistance.DICKINSON, History of Parliament Online Dickinson finally acquiesced upon receiving assurances that there would be no financial loss to his son and family. Dickinson would die while still in office on 6 February 1765 at the age of 61 in St Albans, Hertfordshire. He was survived by his two children in addition to their families. Dickinson was succeeded in a by-election in Brackley by John Montagu who likewise adhered to the Bedfordite line. =Electoral record=References Category:1765 deaths Category:British MPs 1761‚Äì1768 Category:1703 births Category:British MPs 1754‚Äì1761 Category:Members of the Parliament of Great Britain for English constituencies Category:Tory members of the Parliament of Great Britain Category:Lord mayors of London ","title":"Marshe Dickinson"},{"id":"63996078","text":"Kosta Vangjeli (born 21 July 2000) is a Greek‚Äìborn Albanian professional footballer who currently play as a right-back for Albanian club Sk√´nderbeu.

It is often measured by the increased amount of dissolved minerals than what is considered usual for the area being observed. Naturally occurring salinization is referred to as primary salinization and includes rainfall, rock weathering, seawater intrusion, and aerosol deposits. Human-induced salinization is termed as secondary salinization, with the use of de-icing road salts as the most common form of runoff. Approximately 37% of the drainage in the United States has been effected by salinization in the past century. The EPA has defined two thresholds for healthy salinity levels in freshwater ecosystems: 230 mg/L Cl‚àí for average salinity levels and 860 mg/L Cl‚àí for acute inputs.  Primary salinization  Salinity plays a major role in a freshwater organism's attempts to maintain an osmotic balance between ion concentration and their internal fluids. Salinization increases osmotic pressure, thus negatively affecting the chance of an organism's fitness and survival. Higher levels of salinity present in freshwater environments can lead to declining species richness in general observations, though toxicity varies among freshwater species and the identity of the ions that are causing the salinization. Excluding an organism's death, excess salinity may also lead to a decrease in both individual and population fitness via stunted growth during adolescence, decreased feeding ability, oxidative stress, and overall bodily disfigurement. Excess amounts of saline water in freshwater areas also play a significant role on larger population scales; they may alter trophic interactions within ecosystems and transform pre-existing biochemical cycles into 'new' ones by changing the flow of compound direction. = Effects of freshwater salinization on human health = Most of the water that humans use and consume everyday originate from freshwater sources. High salt concentrations within drinking water sources can result in many harmful effects on human health. A study on two coastal villages in Bangladesh showed that when freshwater contaminated with high salinity concentrations is consumed, it can result in health issues such as hair loss, skin diseases, gastric problems, diarrhea, and high blood pressure. High salinity levels in drinking water also has been found to be highly associated with cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Freshwaters that are alkaline and salty can also mobilize and release a variety of chemicals that travel together throughout watersheds, contaminate human water sources, and can cause a variety of negative health effects on humans if consumed. These toxic chemicals, often consisting of metals and nitrogen containing compounds, are either forced out of streambed soils by the salt ions, or the salinity within the water corrodes the pipes through passing, releasing the chemicals into the water source. An example of this occurring was in Flint, Michigan. Due to the high salt concentrations in the Flint River water source from nearby road salt runoffs, the water passing through the resident's pipes contributed to corrosion and the release of lead into their drinking water.  Secondary salinization  Human interaction accelerates rates of primary salinization. Land development, like construction and mining, causes compounds found in bedrock to be released and come to the surface, which are then exposed to accelerated rates of weathering, eventually leaching ions into nearby water sources. Agricultural practices also generate highly saline irrigation that may enter freshwater, and naturally saline groundwater can be brought to the surface via land clearing. Chloride in the form of chlorine is recognized as the most common type of anthropogenic salts exposed to an environment. In agricultural practices, chlorine is mixed together with other compounds to produce an antibacterial solvent used to treat water. This treated water moves from fields into watersheds where it may remain present for long periods of time. Aggregation of chlorine is especially prevalent where improper irrigation occurs. Raised chloride levels may lead to acidification, movement of metalloid compounds via ion exchange with the stream bed, tampering with lake mixing schedules, and modifications of freshwater biotic relationships. = Effects of salinization on freshwater organisms = Due to body permeability, the salinity of the organism‚Äôs aquatic environment can have a huge influence on cellular stability. Organisms residing in freshwater ecosystems need to maintain an osmotic balance between their body fluids and the ion concentrations within their cells. Changes in osmotic pressure requires large amounts of energy and can result in cellular damage and cellular death within the organisms. Changes within salinity levels affect organisms within freshwater ecosystems both directly and indirectly. The toxic levels of salt ions can directly result in physiological changes in species which can cause harmful effects to not only the individual, but also the species population. The various effects on these organisms can then indirectly affect the overall freshwater ecosystem by modifying the aquatic community structure and function. As salinity increases within a freshwater ecosystem, often this results in a decrease of biota diversity and richness. The extinction rate for freshwater organisms are among the highest worldwide, and as salinity levels in these aquatic ecosystems continue to increase, more species and their environments will become threatened. Freshwater salinization can negatively effect the species richness, diversity, and community composition across multiple trophic levels. Competitive interactions between zooplankton can change as salinity increases, leading species such as Simocephalus vetulus to outcompete the normally-dominant Daphnia galeata under high salinity treatments. Species richness and diversity declines as salinity increases for most macro-invertebrate species as well. Mayflies, stoneflies, and caddisflies, which are considered to be good indicators of stream health, exhibited particularly sharp declines due to increased salinity. Some fish species are negatively effected by salinization. In the lower Pecos River, 13 of the 44 native fish species have disappeared in areas of high salinization. However, some fish only exhibit declines when salinity reaches extreme levels. A study performed in Baltimore revealed that at low concentrations, increased levels of chloride hinders the denitrification process within lakes, which is crucial for removing nitrate, the byproduct of ammonia from fish and other aquatic organisms. Chloride levels in the Northeastern USA increase seasonally to around 5 grams a liter from street salt use in the winter. This vacillation causes freshwater communities closer to urban areas to have reduced biodiversity and trophic complexity. = Biomodification of salt toxicity = Due to numerous concurrent stressors present in freshwater communities, increased levels of salinization may have unforeseen effects caused by interactions with other compounds. Freshwater salinization syndrome (FSS) is cited to be a familiar threat to freshwater located in North America and Europe. The interactions between salt and pH, nutrients, metals, and base cations is not adequately known, though may exacerbate existing issues to negatively effect water quality, carbon dioxide concentrations, and biodiversity. The ion concentration of salt toxicity may change the level of reactivity a species will respond with. To be able to properly recognize the threat salinity plays requires the proper proportions of each ion present to be accounted for. Sensitivity also varies between species. Studies focusing on the abiotic interactions with freshwater organisms found that salinity had an additive effect on the detrimental compounds being observed for the majority of the time, but not always, which makes the prediction process difficult for scientists.

He is a writer, speaker, educator and campaigner on built environment issues.  Research and proposals  Manns has been described as a \\"pre-eminent British planner of his generation\\" and as \\"[one] of Britain's foremost urbanists\\". He has been involved with many of London's tall buildings and contributed extensively to discussions around the management of land for housing. His work has attracted international interest and he has proposed reforms to several key policy areas. =Housing crisis= In 2017 he established the \\"House Me Now\\" campaign which crowd-funded the distribution of 2000 pass-it-on pamphlets around London to raise awareness of solutions amongst ordinary Londoners of possible solutions and to begin a social media debate. In 2018, on behalf of the campaign, he signed an open letter, submitted by Siobhan McDonagh MP, to the UK Government, calling for the release of land close to transport nodes for development. =Green belt= Manns' work on Green Belts is cited widely. In 2014 he authored a history of the emergence of London's green belt, which said that it should not be treated as sacrosanct and set out the historical precedent for reform. He has subsequently supported work by the London School of Economics and in 2016 put forward the concept of a \\"Green Web\\" whereby new development would be accompanied by environmental enhancements and contribute to a net gain in biodiversity. Manns' commentary on Green Belts has at times attracted criticisms: both that property professionals make unconvincing champions for reform and that his varied public profile constitutes a form of lobbying (a criticism which has itself attracted attention ). He has always stated his view that \\"public policy should be adaptable and that the emphasis should be firmly on securing the best outcomes. It should be possible to consider both whether the overall effects are beneficial and whether there is scope for improvement. If opportunities exist to deliver development more sustainably, the ability to explore and realise this should not be prevented by dogmatic defence of the status quo. England's green belt should not be off the table for appraisal and, if appropriate, amendment.\\" =West London Orbital= Manns co-authored an analysis of growth options for the UK Government's All Party Parliamentary Group for London's Planning and Built Environment, in which he proposed new orbital rail links in West London, connecting existing communities and those which could accommodate additional growth. It encouraged West London Alliance to reconsider work it had commissioned in 2001 which flagged the scope to connect Old Oak Common and Brent Cross along the Dudding Hill line. This was agreed at the following meeting of the West London Economic Prosperity Board, in December 2016, and the Board voted to engage the Mayor of London around a West London Orbital in June 2017, which the Mayor committed himself to delivering in March 2018. =Land measurement= He has been commissioned by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors to prepare the first international guidance on the measurement of land and calculation of associated metrics such as density. On publication these new definitions will establish a global standard for all land measurements around the world. A draft was released for consultation in 2019.  Advocacy  In 2016 he was invited to co-launch the Open City \\"Green Sky Thinking\\" week. He teaches at UCL and is on the Editorial Board for the Journal of Urban Regeneration and Renewal. =Political advocacy= In 2015, Manns was Convenor of the UK Government's All Party Parliamentary Group for London's Planning and Built Environment. The purpose of the APPG is \\"to explore the social, economic and environmental issues affecting London at a strategic level and build consensus as to the ways in which these might be addressed.\\" The group, chaired by Rupa Huq MP, has since discussed matters from the Green Belt to the Grenfell Fire. In 2020 the APPG announced that it would provide the Secretariat for a cross-party \\"Suburbs Taskforce\\", with Manns later announced as Chair of the Advisory Board. =Public advocacy= Manns is a trustee of the London Society, which was founded in 1912 to promote debate around London's built environment with members of the public. He is on the Advisory Board for the Patchwork Foundation, which seeks to engage those from non-traditional backgrounds in politics and civil society. He also assisted with the Long Live Southbank campaign to protect and extend London's historic skate spot.

Described by the Italian entomologist Carlo Emery in 1893, the species is native to Central and South America.Emery, C. 1893. Studio monografico sul genere Azteca Forel. Mem. R. Accad. Sci. Ist. Bologna (5)3:119-152 It lives in colonies in the hollow trunk and branches of Cecropia trees. The specific name muelleri was given in honour of a German biologist Fritz M√ºller, who discovered that the small bodies at the petiole-bases of Cecropia are food bodies. Distribution and habitat This ant is found in Central America and as far south as southern Brazil and eastern Peru, at altitudes of up to . It occurs in rainforest and semi-deciduous forests where it is an obligate symbiont of Cecropia trees, often Cecropia glaziovii, Cecropia angustifolia, or Cecropia pachystachya. Ecology Azteca muelleri forms a spongy nest in cavities inside the trunk and branches of a Cecropia tree. This is a mutualistic arrangement as the ants defend the tree against herbivorous animals while the ants benefit from food bodies provided by the tree. A. muelleri is very aggressive. Another insect that also lives in the hollow twigs and branches of C. pachystachya is the beetle Coelomera ruficornis. This beetle can co-exist on a single host tree with the ant Azteca alfari, but A. muelleri removes or drives away the beetles on its host tree, with larger colonies of A muelleri able to locate and expel the beetles faster than small colonies can. There is competition for resources between A. alfari and A. muelleri. Typically, A. alfari is the first to colonise a young Cecropia sapling, perhaps by the roadside or in a clearing, as these trees are pioneering species. As the young tree grows, A. alfari tends to occupy the tips of the branches and abandons the cavities in the larger branches; the colonies have multiple queens and a number of separate colonies come to occupy the same tree. In contrast, A. muelleri may colonise the tree at a later stage in its growth; it has a central nest in the trunk of the tree, where the brood is reared, but maintains passageways to the branch tips. The tree provides M√ºllerian bodies on the leaf stalks, which provide food for the ants.

Hardly any members of this gens are mentioned in ancient writers, but a large number are known from inscriptions. Origin The nomen Stenius is simply a gentilicial form of the Oscan praenomen Sthenius, and is thus a patronymic surname.Dictionary of Greek and Latin Biography and Mythology, vol. III, p. 904 (\\"Stenius or Sthenius\\").PW, \\"Stenius\\". In a few inscriptions it occurs as Sthenius, but in most examples the 'h' is omitted. Many of the Stenii found in epigraphy came from Samnium and adjacent, Oscan-speaking regions of central and southern Italy. Praenomina The Stenii used a variety of common praenomina, chiefly Lucius, Gaius, Publius, and Gnaeus. At least two of them bore the more distinctive praenomen Numerius, which was common in gentes of Oscan origin, but relatively scarce at Rome.

Later, when Thermae was plundered by Verres, Sthenius intervened; Verres then charged him with various crimes, for which the punishment was death; but he was protected, and served as a witness at Verres' trial.Plutarch, \\"The Life of Pompeius\\", 5.Cicero, In Verrem, II. 83‚Äì118, 147, III. 18, 41, IV. 41, V. 109, 128.PW, \\"Stenius\\", No. 2. * Gaius Stenius, named in a sepulchral inscription from Aufinum in Sabinum, dating to the late first century.. * Numerius Stenius M. f., one of the magistri of Mercury, Apollo, and Neptune at Ortygia in Achaia, who made an offering to Hercules in 113 BC..PW, \\"Stenius\\", No. 3. * Lucius Stennius Anneius Africanus, a child buried at Beneventum in Samnium, aged eleven years, eight months, and eleven days, with a monument from his parents, dating from the second century, or the first half of the third.. * Quintus Stenius Augurinus, an eques at Patavium in Venetia and Histria.. * Stenius Callicras Gaudentius, buried at Clusium, aged seventy-two years, eight months, and ten days, along with his wife, Lucia Fonteia Concordia, aged seventy, in a tomb dedicated by their children, grandchildren, and freedmen.. * Publius Stennius Candidus, an infant buried at Carthage in Africa Proconsularis, aged eight months, eight days.ILAfr, 412,84. * Stenius Castelanius Aureolus, buried in a fourth-century tomb at Rome, along with his wife, Florentia.ICUR, i. 470. * Lucius Stennius Clementius, one of the patrons of a guild at Ostia in Latium, in AD 262.

He is Professor Emeritus of Biology at Duke University, where in 1966 he co-founded, with John Buettner- Janusch, the Duke Lemur Center (formerly Duke Primate Center). This facility houses the largest living collection of endangered primates in the world. Peter Klopfer is an Elected Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (1963) and the Animal Behavior Society (1968). In 1979‚Äì80 he received the Humboldt Research Award for his achievements in the field of Sensory and Behavioral Biology. As a scientist Klopfer has authored, co-authored or edited twenty-five volumes and more than 125 peer-reviewed articles, most in the field of animal behavior. Among other contributions, Klopfer's research helped to establish the link between oxytocin and maternal attachment behavior and to initiate study of neural processes involved in hibernation among primates As a civil rights advocate Klopfer was jailed in 1964 for protesting segregated restaurant facilities in Orange County, North Carolina. He subsequently became the plaintiff in the 1967 United States Supreme Court case, Klopfer v. North Carolina, which upheld that the Speedy Trial Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution applies to individual states in the same way as it does to the federal government. As an educator Klopfer and his wife, Martha Smith Klopfer, were among the Quakers who founded Carolina Friends School in 1962. CFS was one of the first schools in the modern South that welcomed children of all races.  Biography  Early life and education = Peter Hubert Klopfer was the elder of two sons born to German immigrant parents, Hubert Robert Klopfer (1900‚Äì1937) and Edith Brauer (1896‚Äì1977). Shortly after the end of World War I, Hubert Klopfer studied economics at Columbia University. There, in the 1940s (and later at UCLA), his brother, Bruno Klopfer, taught psychology and popularized use in the U. S. of the Rorschach test. Peter Klopfer was raised in the suburbs of Philadelphia and attended Abington Friends School. When his father became ill with Hodgkin lymphoma, young Peter lived for several years with Alice and Thomas Knight, Hicksite Quaker elders in Wyncote, Pennsylvania, who were close friends of his father. Late in 1937, after Hubert Klopfer's death, the brothers and their mother settled in southern California. Edith Brauer supported her family by taking in boarders, chiefly older German women with connections to the film industry. As a teenager Klopfer attended Windsor Mountain School, an international boarding school in Lenox, Massachusetts, before matriculating at the University of California, Los Angeles, from which he earned a B.A. (with honors) in Biology in 1952. Here Klopfer was especially inspired by the \\"personal but unassuming\\" pedagogical style and \\"wide-ranging studies\\" of George A. Bartholomew. While an undergraduate at UCLA Klopfer's Quaker convictions led him to refuse conscription for military service during the Korean War. Returning his draft card resulted in a prison sentence; however, Judge Leon Yankwich, then Chief Judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of California, released Klopfer on probation, on condition that he \\"obey all laws, State and Federal, so far as‚Ä¶conscience allows.\\" Klopfer proceeded to join a technical assistance training program (forerunner of the Peace Corps) that was based at Haverford College. At Haverford Klopfer came to know the herpetologist, Emmett Reid Dunn, who advanced the rigor of the young scientist's interest in animal behavior. While at Haverford Klopfer also discovered the work of Niko Tinbergen, in particular Tinbergen's 1952 paper, \\"Derived Activities: Their Causation, Biological Significance, Origin, and Emancipation during Evolution\\". Around the same time Klopfer became acquainted with the work of Eckhard Hess and his associate, A.O. Ramsay. Ramsay, who was both a researcher and a high school science teacher, offered a vocational model that Klopfer briefly followed (1952‚Äì53) when he returned to his former high school, Windsor Mountain School, as a science teacher. Through volunteering at an American Friends Service Committee weekend work camp in Claremont, California, Peter Klopfer became acquainted with Martha Smith. Friendship grew into engagement, and they married in 1955. Through more than six decades the couple has collaborated in many ways: as researchers, as founders of Carolina Friends School, as active members of Durham Monthly Meeting of Friends (NC) and board members of other Quaker organizations, as Masters runners, as equestrians, and as participants in Ride and Tie competitions. Peter and Martha Klopfer have three daughters and four grandchildren. Since 1958 the Klopfers have made their home in North Carolina, residing nearly all that time in Orange County, on land that now accommodates Carolina Friends School, located 5 miles from the Duke Lemur Center and 6 miles from Duke University's Biological Sciences Building. Peter Klopfer did his Ph.D. work at the Osborn Memorial Labs of Yale University, drawn there by the recommendation of George Bartholomew and the charisma of G. Evelyn Hutchinson and Frank A. Beach. Here Klopfer came to know a variety of faculty members and guest lecturers, including J.P. Trinkaus, Dillon Ripley, Don Griffin, Jos√© Delgado, Konrad Lorenz and Margaret Mead. His cohort of graduate students at Yale included Malcolm S. Gordon, Alan J. Kohn, Daniel A. Livingstone, Robert H. MacArthur, and Jane Van Zandt Brower. Klopfer's Ph.D. thesis studied imprinting in waterfowl; however, his interest in maternal attachment in goats also dates to these years. After a brief stint as head of the science department at Windsor Mountain School (1956), Klopfer's next stop in his formation as a scientist was a year (1957‚Äì58) as a postdoctoral fellow at W.H. Thorpe's Madingley Field Station for Animal Behaviour in Cambridge, England. In addition to Thorpe, Klopfer associated at Cambridge with Robert Hinde, Thelma Rowell, Malcolm Gordon, and Stephen Wainwright. Klopfer and Wainwright later became longtime colleagues at Duke University. = Academic career = Peter Klopfer's career in higher education began in 1958, when he accepted a position as Assistant Professor in Duke University's Department of Zoology. Apart from four Visiting Professor positions in German and Israeli universities, Klopfer has spent his entire career at Duke University. He attained the rank of Associate Professor in 1963 and Professor in 1967. Currently he is Professor Emeritus of Biology. Klopfer has held a variety of professional offices at Duke, including service on the Undergraduate Faculty Council (1959‚Äì64; 1988‚Äì89), the Neurosciences Curriculum Committee (1965‚Äì66), the Animal Care Committee (1966‚Äì68), the Academic Council (1967‚Äì71), and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (1997‚Äì2018). He was Duke's representative to the Board of Directors for the Organization for Tropical Studies (1967‚Äì82), Secretary of Duke's American Association of University Professors chapter (1967‚Äì69), and Director of its Field Station for Animal Behavior Studies (1968‚Äì73). An additional arena of Klopfer's service to Duke University was as its women's track coach, before Title IX (1972), when the team was a club (but did compete in ACC cross country meets). Klopfer was trained for this work by Duke's legendary and long-serving track coach, Al Buehler. Buehler also inspired Klopfer himself to become a Master's runner, a pursuit that he and his wife, Martha Klopfer, have participated in for decades. In the 1970s Peter and Martha Klopfer were among the founding members of the Carolina Godiva Track Club. In addition to his election to the AAAS, the Animal Behavior Society, and his Humboldt Award, other fellowships, awards, and honors Klopfer has received include a U.S. Public Health Service Special Postdoctoral Fellowship (1964), a Career Development Award from the National Institute of Mental Health (1965‚Äì70), the Duke University Student Association's \\"Outstanding Professor\\" Award (1968), and the \\"Distinguished Service Award\\" of the Cook Society, Duke University Office on Institutional Equity (2009). Klopfer was also named a \\"Distinguished Professor\\" by the UNCF (formerly the United Negro College Fund) in 1985‚Äì86. During his academic career Klopfer has held a variety of editorial positions with academic journals, including as Associate Editor, Journal of Experimental Zoology (1970‚Äì76), Editorial Advisor, Springer Verlag (1970‚Äì1990), and Co-Editor of the Plenum Press series, Perspectives in Ethology (1970‚Äì1990). Klopfer served as an Editorial Board member for The American Naturalist (1972‚Äì76) and the International Journal of Comparative Psychology (1995‚Äì2000). Peter Klopfer has traveled widely as an academic research scientist. He has been a Visiting Professor in Israel at Tel Aviv University (1970) and Hebrew University of Jerusalem (1987), and in Germany at the universities of T√ºbingen (1979‚Äì80) and Potsdam (1992). In Budapest, Hungary, he gave the Inaugural Lectures at Bolyai College of E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University (1995). Lemurs, both in Madagascar and at the Duke Lemur Center, are the focus of Klopfer's current research. A personal interview with Klopfer in August 2020 yielded the following list of previous animals and habitat locations he has studied: ducks in Manitoba; ducks and passerine birds in England; elephant seals in California; antelope in Israel, Jordan and Egypt; fish in Germany and Belize; horses on the Outer Banks of North Carolina; goats and giant tortoises on Aldabra; birds in Costa Rica, Panama, Guatemala, Jamaica, Cayman Brac and Puerto Rico; birds, ducks, goats and lemurs in North Carolina. = Activism and advocacy = Peter Klopfer has compiled a life-long record of activism and advocacy with respect to civil liberties and civil rights. That record is rooted in his membership in the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers), which dates to his youth and is briefly discussed above. It continued with the American Friends Service Committee, on whose Southwestern Region Executive Committee Klopfer served (1967‚Äì74; 2003‚Äì10). Perhaps the fullest manifestation of Peter (and Martha) Klopfer's Quaker commitments is the founding of Carolina Friends School (CFS) as a racially integrated school. The couple were not only founding and sustaining board members of CFS; they taught at it, raised funds for it, donated the land for it, sent their three daughters to it, and have provided continuous servant leadership to it for six decades. While a young professor at Duke, Klopfer chose to take an active role in the civil rights movement that swept across the American South from 1954‚Äì1968. Indeed, just days after arriving in Durham, North Carolina (from Cambridge, England, in 1958), Peter and Martha Klopfer behaved, at a segregated laundromat, in a manner that confounded both its black and its white patrons. They put their dark-colored laundry in machines designated \\"colored\\" and their light-colored laundry in ones designated \\"white.\\" As an extension of his Quaker pacifism Klopfer, when a young adult, had joined the American Civil Liberties Union, the Fellowship of Reconciliation and the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE). He supported non-violent sit-ins to segregate public accommodations that began in Durham and Orange Counties in 1960. As documented in detail by Daniel H. Pollitt in a 1965 article published in the North Carolina Law Review 43 (689‚Äì767), the national profile of this movement for justice became especially pronounced in early 1964. On January 3, 1964, Peter Klopfer was one of six professors (four from Duke and two from UNC-Chapel Hill) who were arrested as part of a multi- racial group that met to request service at Watts Motel and Restaurant in southern Chapel Hill. Before they could enter \\"Watts Grill,\\" the would-be protestors were \\"jumped on in the parking lot and beaten\\" Local police intervened in the bloodshed only after one of the UNC professors, Albert Halstead Amon, received serious head injuries. On February 24, 1964, Klopfer was indicted for the misdemeanor crime of criminal trespass by an Orange County grand jury. North Carolina Superior Court Judge Raymond B. Mallard presided over Klopfer's initial trials. A string of hung juries and legal appeals--some of them focused on Klopfer's refusal, as a Quaker, to swear on the Bible--ultimately led Klopfer, his attorney Wade H. Penny, and the American Civili Liberties Union to assert, first to the North Carolina Supreme Court and then to the United States Supreme Court, that Klopfer's Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial had been abridged. Ultimately, the U.S, Supreme Court voted by a margin of 6-3 to accept the case, which was argued on December 8, 1966, and decided unanimously in Klopfer's favor on March 13, 1967. Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote the opinion. Ten years later, when Peter Klopfer was a member of the Carolina Friends School board of directors, the school filed an amicus curiae brief in another legal case, arguing for repeal of legislation passed by the state of North Carolina in 1977 that required non-public schools to administer standardized tests. Don Wells, Carolina Friends School principal at that time, asserted in sworn testimony that a \\"standardized equivalent measure\\" of student success, which Carolina Friends School employed, was the Quaker process of \\"consensus,\\" which those in the judicial system should know well since it is what juries use \\"to decide, at times, matters of life and death.\\" Surely this same process should be \\"suitable for use in measuring student progress,\\" the school's argument concluded. Ultimately the North Carolina legislature concurred with this view. In 1979 \\"the General Assembly amended Chapter 115 of the General Statutes to include two new articles, Articles 32A and 32B, both of which have the effect of limiting the authority of the State Board of Education to regulate the educational programs of nonpublic schools providing instruction to children of compulsory attendance age.\\"  Major publications ReferencesExternal links *Faculty page Category:1930 births Category:20th-century American zoologists Category:21st-century American zoologists Category:Duke University faculty Category:German emigrants to the United States Category:Living people Category:University of California, Los Angeles alumni Category:Yale University alumni ","title":"Peter Klopfer"},{"id":"63996624","text":"Richard Graul (24 June 1862 ‚Äì 25 December 1944) was a German art historian and museum curator.

In 1881 he joined his father's pattern-drawing studio in Frankfurt, where he first became involved with industrial arts. In 1888 he received his doctorate in Zurich with a dissertation on the history of decorative sculpture in the Netherlands during the 16th century. From 1889 to 1892 he was secretary of the Society for Reproducing Art in Vienna and, in addition, editor of its journal Die graphischen K√ºnste until 1894. In 1892 he began as a trainee in the sculpture collection and the picture gallery of the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, where he became assistant at the Alte Nationalgalerie in 1894 and worked in 1896 at the Kunstgewerbemuseum Berlin with Julius Lessing.[Creator[]=Graul%2C+Richard Lettre autographe sign√©e de Richard Graul √† Andr√© Michel (1853-1925)] on Biblioth√®que de l'INHA In 1896 Graul left Berlin and went to the Leipzig Museum of Applied Arts of which he was director from 1896 to 1929. From 1924 he was also director of the Museum der bildenden K√ºnste in Leipzig. Graul developed the Leipzig Museum of Applied Arts into a museum of European standing, and his many activities had a lasting effect on the museum. In 1920 he founded the Grassimesse, a sales fair independent of the Leipzig Trade Fair. It took place in the rooms of the museum at the same time as the spring and autumn fairs. Graul initiated the construction of the new Grassimuseum, which took place from 1925 to 1929. Already from 1926 the house could be occupied depending on the progress of the construction. Thus the Grassimesse 1926 took place in the wing on Hospitalstra√üe (today Prager Stra√üe). Under Graul's management it developed into an arts and crafts fair with high quality standards. He attracted international attention with the large special exhibition \\"European Arts and Crafts 1927\\" in the new museum building. It made the Grassimuseum known throughout Europe. Graul was founder of the magazine The Museum (1886) and co- founder and temporary editor of the art magazine Pan (1894-1896). He was editor in 1898/1899 and from 1925 to 1931 publisher of the '. Graul was a member of several museum committees, including the Kunstgeschichtliche Gesellschaft Berlin, the Deutscher Werkbund and the Saxon Landesstelle f√ºr Kunstgewerbe in Dresden.

During World War I, she evacuated to Voronezh and taught at Lithuanian teachers' courses and girls' school established by Martynas Yƒças. Since there was a lack of Lithuanian textbooks, she prepared and published a collection of articles I≈° m≈´s≈≥ literat≈´ros (From Our Literature; 1913), textbook Lietuvi≈≥ literat≈´ros istorijos konspektas (Outline of the History of the Lithuanian Literature) and an accompanying anthology (both in 1918).

In Switzerland, she learned about the Union of Friends of Young Women () established in 1877 and founded its chapter in Lithuania (Mergaiƒçi≈≥ biƒçiuli≈≥ draugija) in 1929. The union sought to help young women who moved from villages to larger cities to avoid being exploited or trafficked. In 1935, ƒåiurlionienƒó returned to the League and became a member of the Fist Committee (legal and constitutional questions) and Sixth Committee (mandates, slavery and political questions), but returned to the Fifth Committee in 1936. In 1937, participated in the Second Congress of Lithuanian Women organized by the Lithuanian Women's Council where she read a paper on the causes for marriage failures. The Lithuanian Women's Council unsuccessfully suggested her to the State Council of Lithuania and to run as a candidate to the Fourth Seimas.

Frequent visitors included Vincas Mykolaitis-Putinas, Balys Sruoga, Salomƒója Nƒóris, . These gatherings resulted in the magazine Gimtoji kalba (Mother Tongue; 1933‚Äì1941) which was edited by ƒåiurlionienƒó for the first year. She also published numerous articles on language, education, and culture in various periodicals. =Later life= ƒåiurlionienƒó in 1932 Due to poor health, she resigned from her teaching position in 1938, but continued to be active delivering guest lectures. During World War II, together with her daughter and son-in-law, she helped rescue Esther, one-year old daughter of the Jewish writer . They worked with Petras Baublys, director of an orphanage, and saved children and others from the Kovno Ghetto. They were recognized as Righteous Among the Nations in 1991. In 1954, ƒåiurlionienƒó petitioned Justas Paleckis, Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR, on behalf of Juozas Urb≈°ys, the last Minister of Foreign Affairs of independent Lithuania, and his wife Marija Ma≈°iotaitƒó-Urb≈°ienƒó, childhood friend of ƒåiurlionienƒó and daughter of writer Pranas Ma≈°iotas. Urb≈°ys had served a prison sentence in Siberia but was not allowed to return to Lithuania. ƒåiurlionienƒó asked Paleckis to allow them to return and promised to house them at her home. They returned in 1956 and lived with ƒåiurlionienƒó. To earn some money, Urb≈°ys translated from French to Lithuanian. In public, these translations were attributed to ƒåiurlionienƒó. One of such translations was the novel Madame Bovary by Gustave Flaubert published in 1958. ƒåiurlionienƒó suffered two heart attacks and died in 1958. She was buried in the Petra≈°i≈´nai Cemetery. Works Her first literary works, a poem and an impression, was published in Gabija, the first Lithuanian almanac, dedicated to Antanas Baranauskas and published in 1907 in Krak√≥w. She later published her literary works and critical essays in various anthologies and periodicals, including Naujoji Romuva, Lietuva, Au≈°rinƒó. When her criticism of Sudrumsta ramybƒó (Disturbed Peace), a 1925 play by , was not well received, she stopped publishing her reviews. Her first book Lietuvoje (In Lithuania) was published in 1910. It contained seven essays by ƒåiurlionienƒó and one essay on music by ƒåiurlionis which she translated from Polish. The book provides a critical evaluation of Lithuanian culture and society. Influenced by ideas of fin de si√®cle and Young Poland movements, she was dissatisfied with realism which was prevalent at the time and supported symbolism that sought deeper and more significant meaning, explored spiritual life and longing. In her various essays on art and literature, she urged creators not to copy foreign examples but to look within oneself, to explore the national character and spirit embodied in the Lithuanian folklore, and to create more modern works. In this light, she praised plays by and Vid≈´nas. Most of her literary works are theater plays making her one of the first Lithuanian women playwrights. Her first play was Kalinys (Prisoner) about the escape of Grand Duke Vytautas from the Kreva Castle in 1382. Her most popular works were comedies Pinigƒóliai (Money; 1919; translated to Polish) and Vilos puo≈°mena (Decoration of a Villa; 1932). These comedies by contrasting idealism with materialism showed the society's flaws and poked fun at greed and desire for profit. Another comedy Did≈æioji mugƒó (The Great Fair; 1939) explored families of the new capitalist elite ‚Äì husbands chasing money and fame and their vain wives launching charitable initiatives and flirting with the Americans. Her drama Au≈°ros s≈´n≈´s (Sons of Au≈°ra; 1922) depicted the lives of book smugglers during the Lithuanian press ban. Her allegorical drama Riteris budƒótojas (Knight the Watchman; 1934) was staged but she was dissatisfied with the production and had it canceled. In 1941, she wrote drama Tie metai (That Year) about the first Soviet deportation from Lithuania; it was first published in 1992. She also wrote plays for school theaters; the first collection was published in 1918. Her works were highly influenced by the Lithuanian folklore. In particular, her poem dedicated to ƒåiurlionis Giria ≈æalioji (The Green Forest; 1915‚Äì1945), children's play Dvylika broli≈≥, juodvarniais laksƒçiusi≈≥ (Twelve Brothers Flying as Ravens; 1932), poem M≈´s≈≥ jauja (Our Barn; 1910‚Äì1954) borrowed plot, symbols, and myths from Lithuanian folktales. For example, in Giria ≈æalioji, a maiden searches for a fern flower. Her autobiographical novel ≈†ventmarƒó (1937) is an example of literary realism even though she criticized realism in her essays. It depicts one parish in Samogitia during the Lithuanian press ban and paints a picture of social and cultural life at the time. The main protagonist is a Catholic priest, but despite her upbringing in the household of her Catholic priest uncle, ƒåiurlionienƒó does not dwell on Catholic morality and paints the young priest as a herald of the Lithuanian National Revival. The novel was adapted to theater stage by Liucija Armonaitƒó and staged in Alytus in 2013. The National Revival is also explored in the novel Bundanti ≈æemƒó (Awakening Earth; 1913‚Äì1934) which depicts the lives of two young friends, one from the nobility, the other from the peasantry, and their paths to active cultural work. ƒåiurlionienƒó planned to continue the novel, but it was not written. A few of her works were written in the Samogitian dialect, including her last unfinished novel ≈Ωemaiti≈°ka poema (Samogitian Poem). She also translated French comedies Tartuffe and The Miser by Moli√®re (both in 1928) and, together with others, translated and edited Greek epic Iliad (1930). Legacy Three volumes of ƒåiurlionienƒó's selected works were published in 1956 on the occasion of her 70th birthday. A comprehensive collection of her works in eight volumes was published in 1986‚Äì2013 by the Institute of Lithuanian Literature and Folklore. Her life has been a subject of monographs published by Ramutis Karmalaviƒçius in 1992, Viktorija Daujotytƒó in 2016, and Nida Gaidauskienƒó in 2019. In 1996 and 2007, her only daughter published two volumes of memoirs about her. Her portraits were painted by Antanas ≈Ωmuidzinaviƒçius, , and others. ƒåiurlionienƒó burned her letters to her husband ƒåiurlionis; his letters to her were published in 1973 (57 letters) and 2011 (expanded edition with new letters, memoirs by contemporaries) ‚Äì both volumes were compiled and edited by Vytautas Landsbergis. A biographical film about their love story, Letters to Sofija directed by Robert Mullan, was released in 2013. She is also depicted in the theater play Svajoni≈≥ piligrimas (Pilgrim of Dreams; 1975) by Jonas Vaitkus and and film ≈Ωalƒçio kar≈´na (Crown of Grass Snake; 1986) directed by . In 2017, who played ƒåiurlionis in the 1986 film established an annual art and music festival named Sofija in her honor. In 1932, ƒåiurlionienƒó moved to her own house in Kaunas designed by architect Vytautas Landsbergis-≈Ωemkalnis. Financed by funds from the sale of ƒåiurlionis paintings in 1922, it is an example of the modernist architecture that has earned Kaunas the European Heritage Label and that is included on the tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Her room has been preserved as a memorial by her family. Officially opened in 1971, it displays original furniture, old books, photographs, personal belongings. The house where she and ƒåiurlionis stayed in while in Palanga was added to the Registry of Cultural Property; a memorial plaque was affixed in 1969. A street in Aleksotas, a district of Kaunas, was named in her honor in 1993. The house in Joni≈°kis where ƒåiurlionienƒó was born was identified in 2016. The house received some necessary repairs and photos of her were installed on its outside in 2019.

The difficulty in producing lab cultures may be linked to low growth rates and other limiting growth factors.. Methylomirabilis oxyfera, a member of the NC10 phylum, is the first organism discovered to couple methane oxidation to the reduction of nitrite to dinitrogen (N2). This is significant for several reasons. First, there are only three other biological pathways known to produce oxygen (photosynthesis, chlorate respiration, and the detoxification of reactive oxygen species). Second, anaerobic methane oxidation (AMO) coupled to nitrite reduction links the global carbon and nitrogen cycles, and thus denitrifying methanotrophs in the NC10 phylum may influence methane content in the atmosphere. Third, this finding opens the possibility that oxygen was available in the atmosphere prior to the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis and the Great Oxidation Event, which challenges certain aspects of modern theories regarding the evolution of early life on Earth. The NC10 phylum was first proposed in 2003 on the basis of highly divergent 16S rRNA gene sequences from aquatic microbial formations in flooded caves (Nullarbor caves, Australia).

It describes Syria's character to be Arab, democratic, and republican. Further, in line with pan-Arab ideology, it positions the country as a region of the wider Arab world and its people as an integral part of the Arab nation. It entrenched the power of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party, its Article 8 describing the party as \\"the leading party in the society and the state\\", even if Syria was not, as is often believed, a one-party system in formal terms. History The Constitution of 1973 replaced a Provisional Constitution of 1 May 1969. The constitution was amended in 2000 to change the minimum age of the President from 40 to 34. During the 2011‚Äì2012 Syrian uprising, a new constitution based on the 1973 constitution was put to a referendum, which resulted in its adoption. The new constitution came into force on 27 February 2012, thus superseding the Constitution of 1973. Overview The 1973 constitution begins with a Preamble and is then divided into four parts, called Chapters, which are in turn subdivided into Parts (and in some cases Sections) and Articles. =Preamble= The preamble contains the five main principles of the constitution. First, it defines the Arab nation's aspirations in unity, freedom and socialism and stipulates that the means to achieve these aspirations lie in the wider Arab revolution. Second, within the reality of a divided Arab nation, collective defense will be needed to counter the dangers of imperialism and Zionism. Third, affirms the nation's commitment to the march toward the establishment of socialist order. Forth, stipulates that individual freedom is a sacred right and that popular democracy is the \\"ideal formulation which insures for the citizen the exercise of his freedom.\\" Fifth, states that the Arab revolution is an integral part of the wider world liberation movement for freedom, independence and progress.Robbers, 2007, p.896. > This constitution serves as a guide for action to our people's masses so > that they will continue the battle for liberation and construction guided by > its principles and provisions in order to strengthen the positions of our > people's struggle and to drive their march toward the aspired future. =Chapter 1= Chapter 1 contains 49 articles in four parts and provides the political, economic, educational, and cultural principles and the fundamental rights. Political Principles The first article of the constitution states that \\"the Syrian Arab Republic is a democratic, popular, socialist, and sovereign state. No part of its territory can be ceded.\\" Article 3 stipulates that Islamic jurisprudence shall be a (not the) main source of legislation. The article was later amended to include that the president must be of the Islamic faith. The constitution does not declare Islam as the state religion.Robbers, 2007, p.899. Article 4 declares that Arabic is the official language of the Syrian Arab Republic and that Damascus is the capital of the nation. Article 8 of the constitution defines the Baath Party as the \\"leading party in the society and the state,\\" and presents the National Progressive Front as the only framework for legal political party participation for citizens.Robbers, 2007, p.898. Economic Principles The constitution defines the state economy as a planned socialist economy which aims to end all forms of exploitation. Three forms of property is presented by the constitution: public, collective and individual property. The constitution guarantees that private property shall not be expropriated except for the public interest and in return for fair compensation. Educational and Cultural Principles Article 21 of the constitution defines the goals of the educational and cultural system: > The educational and cultural system aims at creating a socialist nationalist > Arab generation which is scientifically minded and attached to its history > and land, proud of its heritage, and filled with the spirit of struggle to > achieve its nation's objectives of unity, freedom, and socialism, and to > serve humanity and its progress. Freedom, Rights and Public Duties The constitution distinguishes between universal human rights that apply to every human being and those that apply to Syrian citizens only. The constitution guarantees the freedom of expression, assembly and religion for all citizens. It stipulates that the state is the guarantor and protector of the citizen's personal freedom and dignity. The constitution guarantees that all citizens will be equal before the law in their rights and duties. It also states that work is a right and duty for every citizen and that the state will undertake to provide work for all citizens. =Chapter 2= Chapter 2 contains 81 articles in three parts. It discusses the powers of the Syrian state, including, the legislative authority, the executive authority and the Local People's Councils. Legislative Authority The constitution defines the People's Assembly as a unicameral legislature consisting of 250 members.Robbers, 2007, p.897 Members of the People's Assembly are elected to a 4-year term by general, secret, direct and equal ballot. The constitution provides a 50% quota of the People's Assembly to workers and peasants. The powers of the People's Assembly include, nomination of the president, debating cabinet policy, approving the budget and ratification of international treaties. The Assembly can not initiate laws but it has the right to amend and approve them. The president is only liable to the assembly in cases of high treason. Executive Authority=President of the Republic= The constitution stipulates that the President of the Republic is the head of the state, the chief executive officer of the executive authority and the commander-in-chief of the armed forces. The nomination for the presidency is proposed by the Ba'ath Party and approved by the parliament. According to the constitution, the nominee must be Arab Syrian, Muslim and over 34 years of age. The nominee is then confirmed through a referendum for a 7-year term. The constitution does not specify a term limit for the president. The constitution gives the office of the president great executive and legislative powers. The president is responsible for appointing and dismissing the Council of Ministers, the prime minister, and other top civil servants and military officers as well as members of the High Constitutional Court. The president may also dissolve the People's Assembly and appoint an unlimited number of vice presidents. =Cabinet and Council of Ministers= The constitution defines the cabinet as the highest executive and administrative body. It consists of the prime minister, the deputy prime minister and the ministers. The constitution states that the ministers are responsible to the president of the republic. Local People's Councils Article 129 of the constitution defines the Local People's Councils as follows: > The Local People's Councils are bodies which exercise their powers within > the administrative units in accordance with the law. =Chapter 3= Chapter 3 contains 19 articles in three parts. It discusses the structure and powers of the judiciary as well as the process for constitutional amendments. Court Judges and Public Prosecutors Article 131 of the constitution stipulates that the president of the republic shall guarantee the independence of the judiciary and the judges with the help of the High Judicial Council.Robbers, 2007, p.897 The president also presides over the High Judicial Council. The constitution states that verdicts in Syrian courts shall be issued \\"in the name of the Arab people of Syria.\\" It also stipulates that the Minister of Justice shall preside over the office of the public prosecutor. The Supreme Constitutional Court The constitution defines the Supreme Constitutional Court as the highest judicial body in the republic. It is composed by four judges appointed by the president by decree, and the president himself. Members of the court serve renewable four-year terms and may not combine their position with any other official capacity in the legislative or executive authorities. The court has power to examine the constitutionality of laws passed by the People's Assembly, but may not examine laws passed by a referendum. The court also handles electoral disputes and the trial of the president. Article 143 of the constitution defines the oath taken by members of the Supreme Constitutional Court as follows: > \\"I swear by the Almighty to respect the country's Constitution and laws and > to carry out my duty with impartiality and loyalty.\\" Amending the Constitution Proposals to amend the constitution can be submitted through the president or at least two-thirds of the People's Council. Amendments must be approved by both the president and a two-thirds majority in the People's Council. The Syrian constitution has seen very few amendments since it was adopted in 1973. Most notable of these was the amendment to require the president to be of the Muslim faith, and the one lowering the mandatory minimum age of the president from 40 to 34 years.Robbers, 2007, p.899. =Chapter 4= Chapter 4 contains 7 articles and includes general and transitional provisions.

Born in the Alsace, Zirnheld studied at the Christian Brothers' school in Saint-Thomas-d'Aquin, Paris, then became an accountant. He was enthusiastic about Catholic social works, and in 1892, he joined the Trade and Industry Employees' Union (SECI), a union of Catholic workers. In 1896, he attended a Christian workers' congress in Reims, and this inspired him to become more involved in the union, editing its journal. Zirnheld completed his military service in 1898/99, and then won election to his union's executive. In 1900, he passed an exam which secured him work at the Bank of France. He remained active in SECI, and attended the first international congress of Christian workers, in Paris. In 1902, the General Confederation of Labour (CGT), had SECI expelled from the Paris Trades Council. Zirnheld began speaking out against the CGT, and socialism more generally. In 1903, he defeated CGT efforts to exclude his union from the International Employees Congress. In 1906, he was elected as the union's president. As leader of SECI, Zirnheld tried to maintain a course independent of both the Catholic religious hierarchy, and the secular trade union movement. He was elected to the national industrial tribunal in 1911, and in 1913 he was the founder of the French Federation of Catholic Employees' Unions. Zirnheld served in the French Army during World War I, but was taken as a prisoner of war in 1916. He tried to smuggle information on the German military back into France, but he was informed upon, and was sentenced to 12 years hard labour. Three months later, the war ended, and he returned home. Back in France, Zirnheld led the move to form the French Confederation of Christian Workers (CFTC), becoming its first president, although against his objections, it admitted all Christians, not just Catholics. He chaired the conference which agreed to found the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions (IFCTU), and when it was set up, in 1920, he became vice president. He opposed the general strikes in France, led by the CGT. In 1933, with the IFCTU declining, Zirnheld was elected as its joint president, becoming sole president in 1937. That year, he was awarded the Grand Cross of the Order of St Sylvester. But from 1938, he began suffering with poor health. The CFTC was dissolved, along with the CGT, in 1940, and Zirnheld signed the Manifesto of the Twelve along with CGT leaders, in protest, but he died before the end of the year.

It was developed and operated by Citigroup Inc in London before it spun out in 2020 to become its own company.  History  Two Citi employees formulated the idea and started working on Proxymity as a digital proxy voting solution in 2017, and the concept was nurtured through Citi's D10X innovation program. In November of the same year, four key institutional investors Aviva Investors, Legal & General Investment Management, Aberdeen Standard Investments and Robeco agreed to pilot the platform at four AGMs including one meeting from a FTSE 100 company. In March 2018, Proxymity won the Global Custodian's award for Innovation in Securities Services Technology and would launch in the UK Market in that year and Australia the following year. Between 2019 and February 2020, Proxymity was used in 561 Australian companies' AGMs, and a total of 3,000 shareholder meetings in Europe and Australia by May 2020. In May 2020, Citigroup announced that it raised $20.5 million from eight investors including The Bank of New York Mellon, Citigroup, Clearstream, Computershare, Deutsche Bank AG, HSBC Holdings Plc, JPMorgan Chase, and State Street Corp. and that Proxymity became its own entity after raising the funds. Proxymity has launched its services fully in The UK and Australia, and has completed pilots in Germany, The Netherlands, Belgium, Austria and Spain. In May 2020, Citigroup has formally spun off the Proxymity shareholder services business into a stand-alone firm.  Description  Proxymity's core algorithm simplifies the flow of information by linking issuers, intermediaries and investors digitally. Through Proxymity, shareholders are instantly notified once a meeting has been announced, benefit from market deadlines for voting which can give an additional nine days research and vote, and real time confirmation that their votes were received and recorded in the meetings.

Human challenge studies may be ethically controversial because they involve exposing test subjects to dangers beyond those posed by potential side effects of the substance being tested. During the 21st century, the number of human challenge studies was increasing. A challenge study to test promising vaccines for prevention of COVID-19 disease is under consideration during 2020 by several vaccine developers, including the World Health Organization (WHO). Over the 20th and 21st centuries, vaccines for some 15 major pathogens have been fast- tracked in human challenge studies - involving about 30,000 participants who had no serious adverse effects - while contributing toward vaccine development to prevent cholera, typhoid, seasonal flu, and other infections. According to medical ethicists, methods of conducting clinical trials by human challenge testing have improved over the 21st century to satisfy ethical, safety, and regulatory requirements, becoming scientifically acceptable and ethically valid as long as participants are well-informed and volunteer freely, and the trials adhere to established rigor for conducting clinical research. Design The intent of a challenge study is to fast-track the timeline for providing evidence of safety and efficacy of a therapeutic drug or vaccine, especially by compressing (to a few months) the usually lengthy duration of PhaseII‚ÄìIII trials (typically, many years). Following preliminary proof of safety and efficacy of a candidate drug or vaccine in laboratory animals and healthy humans, controlled \\"challenge\\" studies may be implemented to bypass typical PhaseIII research, providing an accelerated path to regulatory approval of the test compound for widespread prevention against an infectious disease, such as COVID‚Äë19. The design of a challenge study involves first, simultaneously testing a vaccine candidate for immunogenicity and safety in laboratory animals and healthy adult volunteers (100 or fewer)which is usually a sequential process using animals firstand second, rapidly advancing its effective dose into a large-scale PhaseII‚ÄìIII trial in low-risk, healthy volunteers (such as young adults), who would then be deliberately infected with COVID‚Äë19 for comparison with a placebo control group. In a challenge study for a vaccine to prevent an infectious disease, participants would be closely monitored for signs of toxicity and adequate immune response, such as by producing substantial levels of antibodies against the virus causing the disease. Ethics Ethical issues arise when a wealthy country finances and organizes these clinical trials in a less wealthy country. Two commonly discussed general thresholds for risk to research participant are minimizing all risk after the infection and avoiding serious injury. Researchers typically customize other thresholds for each clinical trial. Vaccines for viral infections Challenge studies have been used to expedite evaluation of vaccines for several pandemic viral diseases, such as cholera, typhoid fever, malaria, influenza, Streptococcal pharyngitis, Tuberculosis, Shigella, Pertussis, Dengue, and Coronavirus disease 2019. Other than expediting clinical evaluation of vaccine properties, advantages of using challenge studies for vaccine candidates include minimizing bias which is inherently part of traditional cohort studies, as both the exposure (timing of infection, virus challenge dose) and outcome (assessment of blood biomarkers) are standardized. Disadvantages include high cost of conducting the trial at multiple locations and the complex management of infrastructure for a challenge trial, especially for obtaining national regulatory approval, organizing participants and trial personnel, and implementing laboratories with Good Clinical Laboratory Practice qualifications. Before beginning a challenge study, a vaccine sponsor must have demonstrated Good Manufacturing Practice standards for approval to use the candidate vaccine in humans, including expensive toxicology and immunogenicity testing. The vaccine sponsor may have required proof of safety and efficacy of adjuvants for delivering the vaccine, demonstrated what the effective vaccination schedule may be, and coordinated with international regulatory agencies and bioethicists for approval and eventual distribution, all requiring coordinated financing and planning. =COVID-19= Human challenge studies are under consideration to hasten the development of a COVID-19 vaccine,UK plan to be first to run human challenge Covid trials The BBC, 20 October 2020 including one proposal made by bioethicist Nir Eyal, and another by rubella vaccine inventor, Stanley Plotkin, with bioethicist Arthur Caplan. These authors propose that the multi- year duration and multinational location of a typical Phase III efficacy clinical trial will continue as usual, while people infected with COVID-19 will continue to suffer or die. As an alternative based on emerging results from COVID-19 vaccine challenge studies, regulatory agencies could allow early emergency use of the vaccine, while the challenge study continues collecting data for eventual licensure. A guidance document was issued by the WHO on criteria for conducting challenge clinical trials and providing clinical care for the participants. Following the challenge infection with or without the candidate vaccine, volunteers would be monitored closely in hospitals or clinics managed by physicians treating people with COVID-19 disease and with life-saving resources, if needed. Volunteering for a vaccine challenge study during the COVID‚Äë19 pandemic is likened to the emergency service of healthcare personnel for COVID‚Äë19-infected people, firefighters, or organ donors.

Life Sarah Cotter was possibly the sister or daughter of the bookseller Joseph Cotter, who died around 1751. She took over his business, operating under Dick's Coffee House, Skinner Row, Dublin since 1744 and under her auspices until 1774. Cotter is one of the few women to be admitted into the guild of St Luke the Evangelist as a quarter-brother in 1756, which was usually denied to women as they were not permitted full freedom. She paid quarterage to the guild until 1770. Cotter noticed there was a market for a publisher specialising in legal works, engaging in this work with other printers as she did with Oliver Nelson and Richard Watts (fl. 1745‚Äì1762) in the publication of Sir John Strange's Reports of adjudged cases in the courts of Chancery (1756). She established herself as a law publisher and bookseller, issuing a Sale catalogue of law books for 1766, and advertised regularly with newspapers including the Dublin Journal and Freeman's Journal. She fostered links with the book trade in London, importing books and appearing as the Dublin agent on London imprints. Other publications by Cotter included Poems by eminent ladies (1757), Shakespeare's Measure for measure (1761), Philosophical enquiry (4th ed. 1766) by Edmund Burke, and A collection of apothegms and maxims for the good conduct of life by Gorges Edmond Howard (1767). Cotter married Joseph Stringer (fl. 1754‚Äì1783) in 1768. He was a Dublin painter-stainer. Cotter continued to trade under her married name, printing The wonder! or a woman keeps a secret a play by Susanna Centlivre the same year. Her husband and former apprentice Charles Ingham (fl. 1747‚Äì1792) managed the business from 1768, with Cotter officially retiring in 1774. Cotter wrote to Philip Skelton on 21 September 1784 from Summerhill, Dublin, praising his book An appeal to commonsense on the subject of Christianity. To promote his ideas, she offered and paid for a cheaper edition to be printed to allow for a wider circulation. Later, he gave her permission to have his portrait drawn, on the proviso that no copies would be made and Cotter would destroy it before her death. She did so three months before her death in 1792, with her will proved at the Dublin prerogative court the same year.

Islamic Republic of Iran (353 F.3d 1024) was a 2004 case in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit related to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA). The DC Circuit Court ruled that while 1996 amendments in FSIA made exceptions from sovereign immunity for states known for supporting state-sponsored terrorism, as listed by the State Department, foreign nations were still immune from private cause of action, preventing lawsuits from private individuals levied at the state based on such terrorism. As a result of this ruling, Congress significantly amended FSIA in 2008 to greatly expand the exceptions from sovereign immunity for state-sponsored terrorism and specifically allowing for causes of actions against foreign countries. Background The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) was passed in 1976 and generally grants foreign countries sovereign immunity from lawsuits from private American individuals with limited exceptions. Those exceptions were expanded with the passage of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 and the Flatow Amendment to exempt countries that supported state-sponsored terrorism from immunity. The State Department maintains the list of countries that it has determined to support terrorism. The present case was initiated by Joe Cicippio, one of the hostages taken during the Lebanon hostage crisis by Hezbollah and held from 1986 to 1991. Iran had been determined by the State Department to have been financially backing Hezbollah at the time. Cicippio sued Iran in 1996 under terms of both FSIA and the Flatow Amendment, and as Iran did not send any counsel to defend themselves, the trial was held ex parte for Iran. The court ruled in Cicippio's favor, awarding him in compensatory damages alongside similar awards for other hostages and their families that had joined the suit. Case In 2001, Cicippio's children brought an additional suit against Iran, seeking punitive damages for emotional distress and loss of solatium during the hostage period of Cicippio under FSIA and the Flatow Amendment. Cicippio sought to consolidate his children's to his completed case, and subsequently seek summary judgement based on the prior ruling. In 2002 the United States District Court for the District of Columbia denied the motion for summary judgement, as well as consolidation, but further also dismissed the children's case as lacking standing, in that FSIA nor the Flatow Amendment does not create a private cause of action for cases of punitive damages. Cicippio's children appealed to the DC Circuit Court, which in 2004 upheld the District Court's ruling. In the 3-0 ruling written by Judge Harry T. Edwards, the court found that the Flatow Amendment \\"merely waives the immunity of a foreign state without creating a cause of action against it, and the Flatow Amendment only provides a private right of action against officials, employees, and agents of a foreign state, not against the foreign state itself\\". Further, the decision, though upholding the Flatow Amendment as the right direction for victims of terrorism to gain compensation, stated \\"it is for Congress, not the courts, to decide whether a cause of action should lie against foreign states.\\" Impact With numerous cases related to FSIA in the courts at the time, the DC Circuit's decision in Cicippio-Puleo filtered into other Circuit courts with civil FSIA cases that has been filed on wake of the Flatow Amendment. The other Circuit Courts adopted the DC Circuit's rational from Cicippio-Puleo, making it difficult for several of these cases to go forward. Congress took action to remedy this in passage of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, passed in January 2008, which among its budgetary features, specifically enhanced the terrorism exemptions of FSIA, addressing the ability for private cause of action cases to be taken against foreign countries that supported state-sponsored terrorism, and made such changes apply retroactive to any ongoing lawsuit that had been adversely affected by the decision of Cicippio-Puleo.

In typography, a fat face letterform is a serif typeface or piece of lettering in the Didone or modern style with an extremely bold design. Fat face typefaces appeared in London around 1805-10 and became widely popular; John Lewis describes the fat face as \\"the first real display typeface.\\" While decorated typefaces and lettering styles existed in the past, for instance inline and shadowed forms, the fat faces' extreme design and their issue in very large poster sizes had an immediate impact on display typography in the early nineteenth century. Historian James Mosley describes a fat face as \\"designed like a naval broadside to sock its commercial message...by sheer aggressive weight of heavy metal.\\" The same style of letters was also widely used executed as custom lettering rather than as a typeface in the nineteenth century, in architecture, on tombstones and on signage. Versions were executed as roman or upright, italics and with designs inside the main bold strokes of the letter, such as a white line, patterns or decorations such as flowers or harvest scenes. They are different in style to the slab serif typefaces which appeared shortly afterwards, in which the serifs themselves are also made bold in weight. Definition London poster, c. 1840s. Thomas Curson Hansard (1825) describes the then new \\"fat face, or fat letter\\" as \\"a broad-stemmed letter\\". Thomas Ford (1854) writes that \\"any type with a very bold face is so called. Such type is much used in jobbing offices.\\" Mosley explains that (unlike slab serif typefaces) \\"while the thick lines were very thick, the thin ones remained the same - or in proportion, very thin indeed.\\" Historical background Early theatre poster, Bristol 1808: all text is in fonts similar to body text faces 1818 poster, Wales; complete change in style. Fat face, or at least bold, letterforms used throughout; the main heading is in an inline italic design. Great changes took place in the style of printed letters available from type foundries in the hundred years after 1750. At the beginning of this period, fonts in Latin- alphabet printing were predominantly intended for book printing. The modern concept of text faces having companion bold fonts did not exist, although some titling capitals were quite bold; if a bolder effect was intended blackletter might be used. From the arrival of roman type around 1475 to the late eighteenth century, relatively little development in letter design took place, as most fonts of the period were intended for body text, and they stayed relatively similar in design, generally ignoring local styles of lettering or newer \\"pointed-pen\\" styles of calligraphy. Starting in the eighteenth century, typefounders developed what are now called transitional and then Didone types. These typefaces had daringly slender horizontals and serif details, catching up to the steely calligraphy and copperplate engraving styles of the period, that could show off the increasingly high quality of paper and printing technology of the period. In addition, these typefaces had a strictly vertical stress: without exception, the vertical lines were thicker than the horizontals, creating a much more geometric and modular design. A major development of the early nineteenth century was the arrival of the printed poster and increasing use of printing for publicity and advertising material. This presumably caused a desire to make eye-catching new types of letters available for printing. Typefaces clearly intended for poster use began to appear in London in the second half of the eighteenth century, introduced by the typefounders William Caslon II and Thomas Cottrell, although casting large metal type in sand for book titles was used for centuries before that. Caslon's were apparently marketed for use by stagecoach services, with lists of towns on the specimen sheets. Although influenced by a textbook on architectural lettering, they still remained similar to magnified body text forms, rather than a new departure, although they did establish one precedent later followed by both fat face typefaces and modern face types generally, that numerals were at a fixed height rather than the old text figures of variable height. First appearances According to Mosley,\\"the growth [of fat face letters] from existing models can be continuously traced. There is a clear parallel to it in contemporary architectural lettering...in printing types its fatness was steadily increased\\". Two contemporary sources concurred that fat face letters were popularised by the typefounder Robert Thorne. He had been an apprentice to Thomas Cottrell, who pioneered large-size poster types, before setting up his own company, often called the Fann Street Foundry, in North London. According to Hansard (1825), \\"the extremely bold and fat letter, now prevalent in job-printing, owes its introduction principally to Mr. Thorne, a spirited and successful letter-founder\\" and according to William Savage (1822) he \\"has been principally instrumental in the revolution that has taken place in Posting Bills by the introduction of fat types.\\" Unfortunately few typeface specimen books from the period survive, making it difficult to confirm this. As to the clients for these types, Mosley writes that \\"it is tempting to see\\" the lottery agent Thomas Bish as a force behind them: the two Thomas Bishes, a father and son who were famous lottery promoters, were well-known for brash, startling advertising; Mosley highlights as significant a fat face in a later specimen book simply showcased with the single specimen word \\"Bish\\", and notes that Bish's posters began with \\"heavy roman lettering in wood, for which fat-face types were substituted as they became available\\". =Increasing boldness= This style of 'W' was common in roundhand calligraphy. Writers on the history of printing have discussed the increasing boldness of fat face-style types in the early nineteenth century as a transition from bold designs to truly fat typefaces, although it is not clear that nineteenth-century printers made this distinction. According to Alfred F. Johnson, bold typefaces begin to appear in the 1800s with the more extreme fat face types appearing on advertisements for the state lottery from around 1810. The Fry Foundry's French Canon No. 2 of around 1806 has been described as a \\"semi-fat face\\"; in the opinion of Paul Barnes the letterforms in Thorne's specimen of 1803 are not yet true fat faces, only bold. Nicolete Gray in her book Nineteenth Century Ornamented Typefaces describes the Fry Foundry's as an early paradigm but not quite the \\"fully developed fat face\\": \\"a superb, wide, generous letter, magnificently roman, but with a good deal less of order and more of pomp than Trajan's classic. It is the same style as the best English architectural lettering...it is not a modern face...this noble letter is merely transitional; by 1815 it has entirely disappeared from the specimen books. It is replaced by the fully developed fat face.\\" Widespread use Carmarthen, 1838: variation of letterform from ultra-bold down to merely bolder than average in the extended text. Albany, 1829. The counters have been reduced to abrupt, tiny slits. Fat faces rapidly became popular, and were also used in the USA, where they were used on gravestones. In the United States Barnhurst and Nerone comment that fat face newspaper nameplates were in fashion in the 1810s; later they were often replaced by blackletter. Mosley has particularly praised those of Vincent Figgins' foundry (digitised by Matthew Carter as Elephant, above): \\"exaggeration puts a huge strain on the designer if the result is to retain any coherence at all. Whoever cut the fat-faces of Vincent Figgins...handled the problems with what can only be described as elegance.\\" Various varieties were made by different foundries, including condensed, wide and contra-italic versions. =Ornamented designs= Besides simple typefaces, variants were designed with patterns and decorations. These extended from simple inline designs to artwork such as flowers and harvest scenes. Decorated fat face typefaces were cut in wood and reproduced by dabbing or stereotype. Digital font designer Andy Clymer reports finding on engraved maps that it was more common for bold lettering to be decorated, leaving spaces not engraved out, than it was to be solid black: \\"whenever things would get heavier, they would often just get more ornamented‚Ä¶not filled in solid [but] with some kind of ornamentation or decoration.\\" This is seen in A Specimen of the Print Hands, an internal specimen of lettering styles used by the Ordnance Survey in the early nineteenth century, in which the boldest lettering is decorated. One type foundry particularly known for decorated designs was the London foundry of Louis John Pouch√©e. Pouch√©e was a Freemason, and some of his foundry's wood patterns, many of which survive, were inspired by Masonic emblems. Ultimately such large decorated metal types were only briefly popular, soon being replaced by lighter wood type. =Late nineteenth century= In 1863, printer H. Morgan in Madras wrote that fat-face letter \\"is seldom used now\\". The term \\"fat face\\" was not exclusively used for ultra-bold poster types. In the late nineteenth century it was used in the United States to describe bolder text faces; William E. MacKellar in 1893 showed a wide body text face described as a fat face in discussing pay scales for compositors. In 1901 printer Theodore Low De Vinne criticised the style as \\"an object lesson of absurdity\\". Twentieth century and later Mid-century poster for London Zoo, an example of the revival of fat faces in graphic design around this time. The 'f's are \\"non-kerning\\", a style that only became popular from the middle of the nineteenth century. Fat faces returned to some popularity in the twentieth century, in the UK as part of the Victoriana style promoted by John Betjeman and others in the 1930s. Post-nineteenth century fat face fonts include: * Ultra Bodoni by Morris Fuller Benton at American Type Founders. * Falstaff by Monotype * Normande by Berthold * Thorowgood by Linotype.

On the anniversary of Transnistria's founding in 2014, then-President Yevgeny Shevchuk awarded Khorzhan the medal \\"For Labor Valor\\". For his efforts in developing and strengthening relations between Transnistria and the other breakaway republic of South Ossetia, he was awarded an honorary diploma by the Parliament of South Ossetia. Khorzhan was also awarded the Order of Party Valor by the Communist Party of the Russian Federation for his work in Moscow. Khorzhan was elected again in the 2015 parliamentary elections, taking first place in the No. 40 constituency with 43.62% of the vote.

He placed third with 3.17% of the vote. = 2018 arrest and imprisonment = On 2 June 2018, Khorzhan held a rally in Tiraspol, at which, a number of attendees were detained by police. Later that day in the evening, Khorzhan went to the city's internal affairs building to meet with the director and vouch for the detainees' release. Police officers blocked him from entering the building and a physical altercation reportedly took place. Khorzhan wrote a statement to the police afterwards, denouncing the police's actions as a disproportionate use of force and a violation of his rights as a member of the Supreme Council. In turn, on the recommendation of head prosecutor Anatoly Guretsky, Khorzhan was stripped of his parliamentary immunity and arrested on 6 June 2018. Several other party members had been arrested by authorities prior to Khorzhan, including his wife, his son, and Tiraspol City Council deputy Alexander Samoniy. Khorzhan's arrest was immediately met with condemnation from members of the UPC‚ÄìCPSU, who denounced his detention as illegal and politically motivated.

The leader of Kilis had the title Mend and the main religion was Yazidism.  History  Origin = The rulers of Kilis are supposedly descendants of Caliph Abbas and it is claimed that they originate from around Hakk√¢ri and Amadiya. The progenitor is claimed to be a Prince named Mentesh which the title Mend derives from. =Rule= When the Ayyubid dynasty collapsed around 1260, the Mamluks appointed Mend Kasƒ±m as ruler of the emirate. The Mamluks ultimately changed their support to ƒ∞zzeddin, but he with Mamluk support failed at removing Kasƒ±m from power. When Ottoman Sultan Selim I expanded his empire and conquered the area, he received support from Mend Kasƒ±m. However, while visiting Constantinople, Kasƒ±m was executed by the Sultan after the latter had received a report from Karaca Beg, the Governor of Aleppo, and ƒ∞zzeddin on the possible disorder in the case of Kasƒ±m's return to Kilis. After years of servitude to the Sultan, Kasƒ±m's son, Canpolat succeeded in obtaining the right to govern Kilis in 1515 and governed until his death in 1572. His son H√ºseyin was able to expand the emirate towards Aleppo but was executed by the local pasha after being accused of murder. The emirate was subsequently governed by H√ºseyin's nephew Ali who went on a revenge campaign against his rivals for the death of his uncle. The Ottomans thus sent an army to remove Ali who had to flee to Constantinople where he was executed in 1610. Despite a paucity of information, the followers of Ali remained in the region and were a source of trouble between 1613 and the 1690s, notably the Ok√ßu ƒ∞zzeddinli tribe which was involved in banditry. = The Canbolatoƒüullarƒ± = The descendants of Canbolat are named 'Canbolatoƒüullarƒ±' and fled to Lebanon in 1630.

Set in Birmingham, Alabama, the story centers on a former Miss Alabama who decides to end her life rather than continue living an unfulfilling existence, and her friendships with idiosyncratic colleagues in a local real estate agency. The novel takes a light tone in describing the main character's failed attempts to kill herself, and provides a vivid look at Birmingham's history, its role in the civil rights movement, and typical Southern mores. Synopsis Margaret Anne \\"Maggie\\" Fortenberry has reached the age of 60 and feels she has nothing left to live for. A former Miss Alabama, Maggie never made anything of her life or married. She enjoys her work in a real estate agency and also her friendships with Hazel Whisenknott, a positive-thinking midget who founded the agency; her real estate partner Brenda Peoples, an overweight black woman who aspires to be the city's first black woman mayor; and Ethel Clipp, the 88-year-old purple-haired office manager who is disgruntled with the deterioration of modern society. The only thing Maggie thinks she will miss are spring and fall in her native city of Birmingham, and the view of the graceful historic home called Crestview perched atop Red Mountain. Maggie determines to kill herself in the most unobtrusive way possible so the news won't be splashed all over the headlines. But every time she sets off to do the deed she is interrupted, until she realizes that she really wants to continue living after all. Subplots involve the rivalry between Red Mountain Realty and Babs \\"The Beast\\" Bingington, a non-native of Birmingham with a fake name and a fake Southern accent who will do anything, legal or not, to get a listing; and the mystery surrounding the last owner of Crestview, Edward Crocker, whose skeleton Maggie and Brenda find in a steamer trunk in the home's locked attic. Themes Known as the \\"Magic City\\", Birmingham plays a prominent role in the novel. Flagg charts its history from the founding of the iron, steel, and mining industries in the late 1800s to the \\"bustling and alive\\" commercial center in the 1950s to the urban decay of the 1960s to the depressed housing market of the 2000s. Flagg also places Maggie in the center of the civil rights movement and the city's struggles over racial segregation. Development Flagg said in an interview in Southern Living that she set the novel in Birmingham because \\"I was trying to write a Valentine to my hometown\\". Flagg's father and grandfather had worked as motion picture machine operators in numerous theaters, just as the fictional Maggie's parents ran a movie house. Flagg had also competed in Junior Miss Alabama pageants in order to win school scholarships. Critical reception The Journal-Gazette states that the novel will more readily appeal to women than men, since women may have experienced some of the scenarios themselves while men \\"might have difficulty relating to them\\". These include Maggie's dissatisfaction with her life, though to the outside observer \\"she seems to have the perfect life: she lives in a luxury condo, she drives a lovely Mercedes, she has beautiful clothing, she has money to spend on what she might want to spend it on\\". BookPage writes: \\"Despite the dark opening, I Still Dream About You is a surprisingly light read, thanks to a cast of folksy, eccentric characters full of gumption and good judgment\\". The Washington Times agrees, adding that \\"there is a sly tongue-in-cheek quality to the plot and its cheerful tone\\". This review also commends the sentimental portrait Flagg paints of the city of Birmingham itself, saying, \\"For the reader, it is as much a pleasure to discover the charm of Miss Flagg's Birmingham as it is to be entertained by her witty plot machinations and her offbeat characters\\".

The sisters toured America and Australia where audiences were amazed at their strength. It was claimed that doctors had inspected their neck and facial muscles to check for trickery. After the death of Adelaide Macarte in New York in 1908 she was replaced by 1910 by the acrobat and circus performer Rosie Foote (1892-after 1945) but the act continued to be billed as the Sisters Macarte. In 1911 the sisters were performing at the Iowa State Fair.Ron Playle, The Iowa State Fair: In Vintage Postcards, Arcadia Publishing (2006) - Google Books In 1912 The Stage recorded that a new music hall organisation called The Ferrets had been launched in December 1911, the aim of which was 'to promote sociability and good fellowship among the ladies of the music hall profession and their friends.' Formed in December 1911, the group was structured along the lines of the Grand Order of Water Rats, the membership of which was and is restricted to men in the entertainment industry. The twelve founding Ferrets included Ida Rose as Queen Ferret, Julia Macarte as Princess Ferret, Mrs. Arthur Weir as Bank Ferret, Mabel Mavis as Musical Ferret and Mrs. N Alva as Scribe Ferret.'The Ferrets' - The Stage Year Book, (1912) Later career The Macarte Sisters in costume for their act 'The Land of the Lotus' (1912) Between 1910 in CanadaThe Three Macarte Sisters present The Land of the Lotus - The Vancouver Daily World, Vancouver, British Columbia, July 23, 1910, Page 9 and 1912 in Britain the Macarte Sisters were performing in a Japanese-style act billed as 'The Land of the Lotus', including at the London Pavilion - the costumes of which at least were influenced by the operetta The Mikado.

History The community is named for William Druecker, who opened the Druecker Stone Quarry in the area in 1873. The company was one of several limestone quarries that operated in Ozaukee County in the late 1800s and early 1900, and quarrying was Druecker's main economic activity from the 1870s until the 1920s. The quarry produced stone for Port Washington buildings, including St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church, and also operated lime kilns and a railway depot referred to as \\"Limekiln Station\\" on the Lake Shore Railway, which later became part of the Chicago and North Western Railway. A post office opened in Druecker in 1886. Limestone declined in popularity for construction in the 1920s and some of Ozaukee County's quarries closed. The Lake Shore Stone Company in the Town of Belgium closed in 1925, and the Milwaukee Falls Lime Company in the Village of Grafton closed in 1926.

The poem is often noted for its prose style, marxist perspectives, disappointment, anguish, and critic atmosphere. It centers partition of India after the British rule was ended in the Indian subcontinent, leading to rise different concerns and feelings associated with multi-ethnic origin. The poem primarily revolves around the poet's sentiments and emotions about those people who migrated from one sovereign state to another, leaving their native places. Subh-e-Azadi was written as an expression of solidarity with the people who was living either in India or Pakistan before the region split into two independent nations. The poem illustrates split of Indian subcontinent in an imaginary style, covering aftermath and its related events as personally felt or realized by the poet. The poem also illustrates displeasure of the poet which he claimed or saw across India‚ÄìPakistan borders. Faiz expresses his emotional pain, sadness or distress about the cost paid for sovereignty and suggests a degree of resignation. History Subh-e-Azadi was written on the first day of Pakistan, highlighting the issues encountered or experienced by the new sovereign state. In this poem, the author expresses his disappointments experienced during or after the partition. It is also claimed he wrote the poem in solidarity with people killed or displaced during 1947 intrastate war that saw religious as well as patriotic violences from the both sides such as India and Pakistan. Analysis Subh-e-Azadi is often recognized as a narrative poem. It reads naturally, conversationally or possibly emotionally and begins as a kind of cross-border depiction of partition. It consists of four to seven modern prose style stanzas of lines each. At some occurrences, the first line loosely rhymes with the third and fourth, and since it is an Urdu language poem, the second line doesn't rhymes with the next one. The rhythmic variation of the poem and its Urdu language naturalness affects the reader's sense of expectation. The poem is recognized one of the prominent writings of Faiz which was \\"praised\\" as well as \\"criticised\\" by the both nations. Reactions Subh-e-Azadi's lyricism associated with British political movement expresses the poet's sorrow about events occurred during or after partition. It was criticised by the notable authors, raising their concerns about its views and ideological style in which poet has opposed the sovereignty of the two nations (freedom/partition). Some writers criticised Faiz's sorrow over freedom and expressed their views citing \\"freedom had finally arrived\\". One of progressive poets Ali Sardar Jafri described the poem \\"half truth\\" citing \\"a poem like Subh-e-Azadi could be written by both an Islamist or a Hindu organization\\". A Pakistani scholar Fateh Mohammad Malik defended the poem citing \\"critics never managed to see in it his deep\\" and patriotic contribution made via poem.

S. Army Blackhawk Pilot. A paraplegic due to a motorcycle accident, Radetic competed during the 2014 and 2016 Invictus Games and is the winner of national and international extreme sports competitions.  Early career and education  Born in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, Radetic began pursuing a career as a fighter pilot at the age of 14. He attended a military boarding school, Florida Air Academy High School, in Melbourne, Florida. While there, an eyesight condition interrupted his plans to become a pilot. After graduating from high school in 1997, he attended Embry Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Florida, and majored in Aerospace Engineering. Two years later, Radetic changed pursuits and enlisted in the U. S. Army.  Career  U. S. Army = Radetic began his career in the Army as a parachute rigger in 2000. He became a Special Forces soldier after completing key training components including finishing airborne school in Fort Benning, GA, a station at Camp Mackall, and completion of the Army's Primary Leadership Development program in Fort Bragg, North Carolina. While serving as a Special Forces Sargeant, Radetic received surgery to correct his vision. He was selected for the Army Laser Surgery Program, which allowed soldiers with corrective eye surgery to attend flight school. After becoming a Warrant Officer 1, Radetic completed flight training and was eventually positioned as a Blackhawk VIP Pilot in Fort Benning, GA. He was training at Fort Rucker in Alabama when his accident occurred.  Injury  On February 17, 2004, a car pulled out in front of Radetic's motorcycle, and the impact left him paralyzed and unable to walk. He suffered a spinal cord injury at the C2, C3, T7, and T8 levels, and was placed in intensive care. Afterwards, Radetic spent six months at the Charlie Norwood VA Medical Center in Augusta, Georgia for treatment. During the first year post-injury, Radetic had to relearn basic life skills and a new way of living. He credits the personnel at the James A. Haley Veterans' Hospital in Tampa, Florida, and the Paralyzed Veterans of America for making the transition. Radetic was medically retired as a U.S. Army Blackhawk helicopter pilot in 2010. = Professional life = Handcycling  Radetic, 2016 United States Marines Corps Cycling Event Radetic's inability to walk led to three years of depression. To remain active while adventure seeking, adaptive sports became a choice beginning with hand cycling but further encompassing skiing and watercraft racing. Entering in monthly tournaments with abled bodied competitors was the next step. Initial wins included the Costa Rica Tamarindo Marathon in 2017 where he placed first and the Chicago marathon in 2018 where he placed second. The extreme sports of skiing and personal watercraft racing followed.  Skiing  In 2010, Radetic began his journey as an alpine skier at a clinic in West Virginia using a sit-ski. Two years later, he was preparing for global competitions in Aspen, Colorado as a part of the U. S. Development Ski Team. It was in Aspen that Radetic performed a now famous back-flip. He currently uses a mono-ski to navigate the slopes.  Personal watercraft racing  Radetic on a Sea-Doo preparing for a July 4, 2019 race Radetic competed in different adaptive sports at a professional level until he found what he describes as \\"the perfect fit.\\" Radetic's wife, Danielle, suggested Personal Watercraft Racing since it was the closest to riding a motorcycle. His competitive breakthrough came in 2013 when he participated in the Never Quit Challenge that included a 1,600 watercraft journey from Florida to New York. The next year, Radetic began a professional watercraft racing career in 2014 using a Sea-Doo vehicle. Competing in the first P1 AquaX tour in 2015, Radetic quickly became not only an inspiration but an American sporting legend. That year, he received the series \\"Athlete of the Year\\" award. A significant international accomplishment was achieved at the 5-day 2016 Russky Grand Prix in Vladivostok, Russia where Radetic was the sole USA entrant. There, as the only disabled racer, he placed 2nd. Radetic turned pro as a Personal Watercraft Racer in 2017 and as of 2020, he is ranked 31st in the world. For Sea-Doo, Radetic races in league with all other competitors, and there is no distinction made based upon his disability. The adaptive watercraft vehicle is manufactured by Sea-Doo RXPX, and designed by Riva,including a custom seat from BlackTip Jetsports. Radetic is a 2020 Rider for the Aquabike World Championship in the Runabout GP1. The event attracts the world's best riders and includes freestyle artistry and aerial acrobatics. Radetic's most recent adaptive sport endeavor is sailing, where he participates in outings organized by the Warrior Sailing Program.  Invictus games  Radetic, 2014 Invictus Games Radetic's performance at Paralympic-style sports led him to the 2014 and 2016 Invictus Games. He competed in the swimming and cycling races.

The founder of ≈ûirvan was Emir Hasan who was a relative of Emir Kor of the Soran Emirate. The emirate ultimately lost its autonomy due to the Ottoman centralization policies in the mid-1840s and its Kurdish leaders were driven out. At its peak, the emirate included much of the area from Bitlis to Hakk√¢ri including Kurtalan and its rulers were loyal to Bohtan Emirate to the south and its leader Bedir Khan Beg. Although removed from power, the descendants of the former rulers of ≈ûirvan still commanded respect in the area towards the end of the 19th century.  History  The ancestors of the rulers of ≈ûirvan were viziers for the Ayyubids and is said to either have originated from nearby Hasankeyf or from kings in ≈ûirvan which they inherited the principality from. Under Emir Hasan, the territory was divided into three feudal domains being ≈ûirvan (center), Kafra and Irvan. Hasan was succeeded by his son Emir Shah Mohammed while his four other sons were sent to different fortresses to govern Kafra and Irvan. After the death of all of Shah Mohammed's brothers and without any male heir to govern the two domains, they were handed over to Emir Shah Mohammed. When Timur swept the region in 1394, he also captured ≈ûirvan which he handed over to Qara Osman of the Aq Qoyunlu in 1402. After shortly being under Kara Koyunlu reign, Uzun Hasan recaptured the region for the Aq Qoyunlu again in 1468. The region was captured by the Ismail I 1508. After the Ottoman win in the Battle of Chaldiran in 1514 and the supportive stance among the local Kurds, Selim I chose to let Idris Bitlisi and Bƒ±yƒ±klƒ± Mehmed Pasha administer the area until Constatinople centralized its power in the mid 1840s.

Along with Praia Islet to its north, Baixo Islet is one of two main breeding places of Monteiro's storm petrel, an endemic marine bird of the Azores. Geography Baixo Islet is in fact two basaltic islets, one much larger than the other. The islets are the exposed remains of a Surtseyan cone composed of volcanic tuff rock, heavily eroded by the ocean and seismic activity. The larger main islet is located about southeastof Ponta da Restinga (Restinga Point), which is a small peninsula of Graciosa. It measures or in area, with a highest point of above sea level. =Biome= The islet and its exposed sea cliffs provide a habitat for flowering coastal plants endemic to the Azores, some of which are endangered, including Azorean forget-me-not (Myosotis azorica), Azorean spurge or erva-leiteira (Euphorbia azorica), bracel-da-rocha fescue grass (Festuca petraea), Spergularia azorica, and vid√°lia (Azorina vidalii). Thanks to limited human access and a lack of predatory mammals such as cats, rats, and ferrets, the islet shelters a variety of marine birds. Along with Praia Islet to its north, Baixo Islet is one of two main breeding places of Monteiro's storm petrel, an endemic marine bird of the Azores. Other marine birds present on the islet include band-rumped storm petrel, Barolo shearwater, black-headed gull, Bulwer's petrel, common tern, Cory's shearwater, Eurasian whimbrel, Fea's petrel, great black-backed gull, grey heron, Kentish plover, little egret, ruddy turnstone, sanderling, and yellow- legged gull. This biodiversity and abundance of endemic species led to the creation of a conservation area around the islet called the Zona Especial de Conserva√ß√£o do Ilh√©u de Baixo e Ponta da Restinga (Baixo Islet and Restinga Point Special Conservation Zone). The conservation zone is part of the Nature Park of Graciosa, one of the locally protected areas of the Azores. Since March 1990 the islet has been protected through the European Environment Agency's Natura 2000 initiative under the Habitats Directive and Birds Directive. History Human access to the islet is infrequent and only possible by small boat. Historically the islet was known as Ilh√©u dos Homiziados (Islet of the Fugitives). According to Azorean chronicler Gaspar Frutuoso in his publication Saudades da Terra, the moniker derived from a possibly apocryphal 1541 occurrence. Seven young men landed on the island for recreational purposes and were trapped overnight by rough seas. Five of their friends jocularly referred to them as os homiziados (the fugitives) and endeavored to rescue them. Unfortunately, en route to the islet the rescuers' boat capsized, killing four of them.

About a hundred Italian officers were shot on the commands of General Friedrich- Wilhelm M√ºller, after being considered traitors for resisting the German invasion of the island (known as the Battle of Kos, part of the Dodecanese campaign). Background Kos city castle Kos was occupied by Italy since the Italo-Turkish War of 1912, which ended the long Ottoman rule over the island. In the course of the Second World War, Kos became important because of an airfield near Antimachia. The armistice of Cassibile on 8 September 1943, which stipulated the surrender of Italy to the Allies, was greeted with enthusiasm both by the Italian army and the local population in the hope of an imminent conclusion of the war. The few Germans on the island were caught off guard and easily disarmed. Soon after, more than 1,500 British troops landed on Kos to assist the approximately 4,000 Italian soldiers in defending the island from a possible German invasion. In the dawn of 3 October, the German 22nd Air Landing Division (then stationed on Crete), led by General Friedrich- Wilhelm M√ºller, began Operation Polar Bear by landing in three different locations on the island, both from the sea and the air. During the battle there was no coordination between the Italians and the British, the RAF was unable to provide air cover, and the lack of sufficient anti-aircraft artillery allowed the Luftwaffe's Fliegerkorps X to carry out heavy air bombardments undisturbed. Thus, even though the ground forces defending Kos vastly outnumbered the Germans (about 5,500 Anglo-Italians vs. approximately 1,000 Germans), they surrendered on October 4. A total of 1,388 British and 3,145 Italians were captured and mustered in Neratzia Castle in the city of Kos. The massacre Between 4 and 6 October, 148 captured Italian officers (who belonged to the 10th Regiment, 50th Infantry Division Regina, commanded by Colonel Felice Leggio) underwent a summary trial ordered by M√ºller. It was concluded that all the officers who had remained loyal to King Vittorio Emanuele III and had resisted the Germans as a result, were to be shot. Eventually, of the 148 officers, seven switched sides joining the Germans, 28 managed to escape to Turkey, 10 were hospitalized and latter transferred to camps in Germany, whereas the remaining 103 were shot by M√ºller's men between the evening of October 4 and 7 near the Tigaki salt lake (Alyki). Aftermath In February 1945, 66 bodies were exhumed from eight mass graves near Linopotis and buried in the Catholic cemetery of Kos. In 1954, these bodies were transported to Italy and buried in a WW II memorial in Bari. Despite that many bodies were still missing in Kos, no research campaign to locate them was undertaken until 2015. Then, a group of Greek and Italian volunteers carried out excavations which unearthed human remains and personal objects. The recovered remains were placed in a marble urn at the ossuary of the Catholic cemetery of Kos. After the end of the war General M√ºller was captured in East Prussia by the Red Army and extradited to Greece, where he was sentenced to death by a military court for retaliatory atrocities against civilians in Crete (but not for the events on Kos). He was executed by firing squad in Athens on 20 May 1947 and was the only person among those responsible for the massacre that was ever punished. =The armoire of shame= In 1994, during the trial of former SS Erich Priebke, documents related to the Kos massacre were uncovered among many other files in an archive found in a wooden cabinet facing a wall (the armoire of shame) in the chancellery of the military attorney's office in Rome. In 2003, inquiries by a parliamentary commission revealed that in January 1960, the Italian military attorney general Gen. Enrico Santacroce had signed a filing order for almost 2,000 Nazi war crime files. In the context of the Cold War era, the military attorney general was under strong political pressure to cover up the material by ministers G. Martino and P. Taviani who feared that Germany, Italy's NATO ally, would be disturbed. See also *Massacre of the Acqui Division *SS Oria ReferencesExternal links *L'eccidio di Kos, ottobre 1943.

From 1991 to 1994 Koopmans completed a fellowship at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, where she studied enteric viruses. She joined the Virology Division, where she focussed on torovirus in cattle. She became increasingly interested in virology, and moved to the United States to specialise in viruses that can be transmitted between animals and humans.  Research and career  Koopmans joined the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), where she was appointed Chief of Virology. She was involved with restructuring the department, and translating their research out of the laboratory and into practical applications for the control of infectious diseases. In 2006 she was appointed as Professor of Public Health at the Erasmus MC hospital in Rotterdam, which allowed her to strengthen the evidence-base of infectious disease research. Her laboratory makes use of basic scientific studies and epidemiology to understand the pathogenesis of infectious diseases, to establish their transmission routes and to translate this research base into diagnostic tools. In 2003, when Influenza A virus subtype H7N7 spread around the Netherlands, Koopmans experienced her first infectious diseases outbreak. She was involved with the development of a coordinated public response, working with veterinarians and physicians to quickly develop public health policy. Her experiences in leading the response to the avian influenza outbreak prepared her for subsequent epidemics, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and Zika virus. During the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, Koopmans was responsible for the deployment of mobile laboratories in Sierra Leone, which trained local volunteers to run testing and treatment programmes. Koopmans is a member of the scientific advisory group (SAG) of the World Health Organization's R&D; Blueprint project. The project looks to understand what has gone wrong with epidemic and pandemic responses, and looks to build global disease preparedness. As part of this effort, Koopmans analysed the public health response to the Zika virus. She identified three significant bottlenecks to an efficient response; including delays in regulatory approvals, challenges in the logistics of laboratory support and the absence of a structured timeline for funding. Koopmans also leads the World Health Organization centre for Emerging Viral Diseases. She is the scientific coordinator of COMPARE, a Horizon 2020 project that looks to develop next generation sequencing techniques for outbreak identification and mapping. COMPARE look to contain and mitigate foodborne illnesses. In 2018 Koopmans was honoured by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) for her work on the transfer of viruses from animals to humans. She was awarded a $9 million NWO grant to establish a consortium, the Versatile Emerging infectious disease Observatory (VEO), that will study how changes in environmental and travel will impact the risk of infectious diseases. The diseases considered by VEO include vector-borne and zoonotic diseases, as well as hidden pathogens. In 2019, Koopmans wrote an article for Nature in which she called for a transformation in epidemic preparedness and response. In the article, she quoted the World Health Organization's leader on health emergencies, ‚ÄúWe are entering a very new phase of high-impact epidemics‚Ä¶ This is a new normal,‚Äù. In 2019 Koopmans was elected member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. From the start of 2020, Koopmans worked to understand SARS-CoV-2 and the spread of coronavirus disease. In the Netherlands, Koopmans made an effort to test healthcare workers, and identified that there were large numbers of asymptomatic carriers amongst the dutch population. With her team at the Erasmus MC, Koopmans looked to understand the efficacy of antibody tests. Alongside leading the scientific response, Koopmans was also involved with scientific communication about the virus, making use of social media and media interviews to share up-to-date research with the public. Koopmans said that as humans occupied more of planet earth, the number of dangerous diseases transmitted from animals to humans would increase. She was appointed to the coronavirus disease advisory panel of the European Commission. The panel served to develop public health recommendations to the member states during the pandemic.

Biography Ma Sik-yu and his younger brother Ma Sik-chun came from Chiu Chow, Guangdong. They eventually relocated to Hong Kong. The Ma brothers became associates of Ng Shek-ho, a major drug trafficker in Hong Kong. Ma Sik-yu was nicknamed \\"White Powder Ma\\". It was alleged that the Ma brothers began trafficking heroin from 1967 onward. They were able to procure heroin by having Ma Sik-yu personally traveled to the Golden Triangle in Burma, along with forging a political alliance with Laos general Ouane Rattikone. Ma Sik-yu was also involved in the activities of Chiu Chow triads in Thailand. The brothers founded the Oriental Daily News in 1969. In 1977, warrants were issued for the arrest of the brothers for the importation of 700 tonnes of opium into Hong Kong between 1968 and 1974. Ma Sik-yu, after being tipped off about the police, escaped to Taiwan, where there was no extradition treaty with Hong Kong. His brother followed one year later. He died in Taiwan in 1998. Legacy Oriental Daily News was run by Ma Sik-chun's son Ricky Ma Ching- fat. In 2010, Oriental Press sued the companies behind five websites, including Wikipedia, for publishing allegedly defamatory statements. The complaints were mainly about the drug trafficking history of its founder, the Ma brothers, found on the Chinese Wikipedia. The Wikimedia Foundation, as a company registered in California, had ignored the court summons and was absent from the trial. The Oriental Press Group therefore received a favorable ruling on paper, including damage claim and an injunction order in August 2010. The articles remained on Chinese Wikipedia.

Black Caucus pushed for the creation of an Office of Minority Affairs, which would include programs like BSU that dealt with minority students. On October 12, 1971, the Black Student Union merged with the Black Caucus and created a revised constitution to be reviewed by the USG.

Beginning as a mission in 1736, the parish would be one of the first to form the Episcopal Diocese of Georgia in 1823, along with Christ Church in Savannah, Georgia and Saint Paul's Church in Augusta, Georgia. The current building was built in 1884 and is adjacent to Fort Frederica National Monument.  History  On February 15, 1736, James Oglethorpe, founder of the Province of Georgia, established the town and fort of Frederica on St. Simons Island. Accompanying him was Reverend Charles Wesley, a priest within the Church of England who served as Oglethorpe's chaplain and was the brother of John Wesley, then- priest of Christ Church in Savannah, Georgia. Charles would hold religious service in a tabby structure on the island, serving in this missionary capacity until July of that year. Following Wesley's departure, other clergymen from the United Society Partners in the Gospel served on the island through the 1700s. In 1808, the state government incorporated the parish, which had been officially organized a year prior. William Best served as the first rector for this newly incorporated parish. In 1810, Edmund Matthews became the rector for the parish, a position he would hold until 1827. His tenure saw the construction of the first permanent church building on the island in 1820 and the creation of the Episcopal Diocese of Georgia in 1823. Christ Church Frederica was joined with Christ Church Savannah and Saint Paul's Church in Augusta, Georgia. In 1831, the church hosted its first convention for the diocese, and five years later, the church celebrated the centennial of the island's first religious service. In 1840, parishioners discovered a beehive in the church's steeple. Collecting and selling honey from this hive, the churchgoers raised money for necessary repairs to the church building. In 1862, this building would be destroyed as a result of the American Civil War. Following this, lay preachers and occasional visiting clergy held services until 1879, when Anson Greene Phelps Dodge Jr. reorganized the parish. In 1884, Dodge had the church rebuilt on the site of the previous building as a memorial to his wife, who had been buried on the church grounds. This structure still stands as the church's current place of worship. In 1886, Dodge established St. Ignatius as an outreach for freed slaves on the island. Dodge died in 1898, leaving an endowment for the diocese that funded much of the diocese's missionary work at that time. Anna Alexander served as deaconess of St. Ignatius, in doing so becoming the first black deaconess in the Episcopal Church. In 1998, she was named a saint by the diocese and in 2018 was added to the Episcopal Church's calendar of saints.

The debate was held two days before the 1975 referendum in which the electorate were asked if Britain should remain a member of European Economic Community (EEC) which it had joined in 1973. The statement debated was \\"that this House would say yes to Europe\\". Former prime minister Edward Heath and the leader of the Liberal Party Jeremy Thorpe spoke in favour of the motion and Labour ministers Barbara Castle and Peter Shore spoke against it. Heath judged that the audience were largely in favour of the motion anyway and in the vote after the debate the statement was approved by 493 votes to 92. The debate was broadcast live on BBC1 with an introduction by Robin Day and Ludovic Kennedy; at the end of the programme David Dimbleby provided an update on other developments in the referendum campaign. The result of the 5 June referendum was 67% in favour of remaining within the EEC.  Background  The EEC in 1975 The European Economic Community (EEC), a common market for Western European nations, was founded by the 1957 Treaty of Rome. In 1961 Conservative Prime Minister Harold Macmillan instructed the Lord Privy Seal, Edward Heath to enter negotiations to join the EEC. This was vetoed by French president Charles de Gaulle in 1963. Heath became prime minister in 1970 and, de Gaulle having resigned, resumed his application. Britain joined the EEC in 1973 after the ratification of the Treaty of Accession 1972. Harold Wilson's Labour Party won the October 1974 United Kingdom general election, with a manifesto promising a referendum on continued British membership of the EEC. Wilson negotiated a number of concessions from the EEC regarding the Common Agricultural Policy, the level of British contribution to the EEC budget, harmonisation of VAT regulations, ongoing Economic and Monetary Union and the maintenance of parliamentary sovereignty. Wilson announced a referendum on continued British membership of the EEC on 7 January 1975 to be held on 5 June. Edward Heath On 18 March Wilson's cabinet endorsed his renegotiation and the House of Commons voted to support them on 9 April. The Conservative Parliamentary Party largely supported continued membership. Heath was challenged for the leadership of the party in February and lost to future prime minister Margaret Thatcher. Thatcher deliberately played a low-key role in the referendum, regarding Europe as \\"Ted's issue\\", Heath therefore played a more prominent role in the pro-EEC Britain in Europe campaign. The Oxford Union is a debating society associated with Oxford University. It has held formal debates on contemporary and historic matters since the early 19th-century. The debates at this time were organised along formal lines, they followed a quasi-parliamentary procedure and all attendees wore dinner dress. A debate on EEC membership was chosen for 3 June, just two days prior to the referendum. The statement for the debate, that attendees would vote whether to approve, was \\"that this House would say yes to Europe\\". The BBC decided to cover the event live on BBC1 and a slot in the schedule was allocated between 9:35 pm and 11:50 pm. The programme, entitled A Question of Europe, was introduced by Robin Day (who was a former president of the Oxford Union) and Ludovic Kennedy. The event was anticipated as being one of the most historic to have been held by the Union.  Debate  Barbara Castle Heath and Liberal Party leader Jeremy Thorpe spoke in favour of the statement and Labour Secretary of State for Health and Social Services Barbara Castle and Secretary of State for Trade Peter Shore spoke against it. The debate was preceded by interviews of the speakers by Day and Kennedy and presided over by Oxford Union 1974/75 Trinity term president Victor van Amerongen. There were almost 600 attendees in the Union's debate chamber for the debate, amongst them was future Conservative minister Alistair Burt, then a student at Oxford who attended wearing the stereotyped French dress of a beret, striped shirt, and string of onions. Heath wrote afterwards that he thought that the audience was largely pro-yes. Heath recalled, at the start of his oratory, that he had taken part in a Union debate as a student in which he opposed the Munich Agreement in the lead up to the Second World War. Heath went on to argue that the EEC was a vital institution to demonstrate that Europe had progressed since the two World Wars and to ensure continued peace. He claimed that Britain would be better able to maintain its sovereignty from within the community than if it were apart from it and questioned how the anti-EEC campaign could claim to support parliamentary sovereignty yet oppose the result of the Commons vote on accession. Heath maintained that a no vote would lead to a \\"siege economy\\" with protectionist import and monetary controls. Thorpe questioned how Britain would obtain cheap food supplies if membership was not continued. He described anti-EEC campaigners as a \\"coalition of 19th- century imperialists and 20th-century Marxists\\". Thorpe asked that if membership was not continued from where else would the country source affordable food. Castle described the EEC as too exclusive and that it would compel Britain to provide favourable treatment to its members in all fields, not just trade. She said that the EEC was a step towards creating a European superstate that would be to the detriment of the poorer countries of the world. When Heath asked Castle if she would resign if the British public voted to remain a member, she replied that in such circumstances she considered that \\"my country will need me more than ever\\". This drew jeers from the crowd and seemed to displease Heath. Castle stated that she expected to lose the vote after the debate, as she considered the Union to be a part of The Establishment. During his speech Shore claimed that the sovereignty of parliament was central to British democracy. He stated that if it remained a member of the EEC the 1957 Treaty of Rome, which founded the organisation, would effectively become Britain's first written constitution and one to which no British citizen had contributed (Britain considered it had an unwritten constitution). Roger Berthoud, writing in The Times, commended the standard of Shore's oratory and noted that he received applause even though most of the audience disagreed with his views. In the post-debate vote the statement \\"that this House would say yes to Europe\\" was approved by 493 votes to 92. The speakers and others retired after the event to the Union's President's Room to have drinks with van Amerongen. The BBC programme was concluded with a summary of other recent events in the referendum campaign presented by David Dimbleby from London.  Subsequent events  It was generally considered that Heath and Thorpe, who had both previously been presidents of the Union and were familiar with its debates, had performed best. Heath claimed in his 1998 autobiography that he received letters of congratulations on his performance from actor Kenneth Williams and comedian Dave Allen. Heath also stated that he suspected Castle and Shore later regretted agreeing to take part in the debate. Castle herself wrote on the night of the debate that she thought her performance \\"a flop\\" and noted that she \\"sat down to the thinnest applause of the evening\\". She praised Heath for the strength of his oratory and genuineness. The debate was referred to as one of the most famous ever held at the Union by Latvian politician Valdis Dombrovskis during a 2018 Oxford Union debate on the statement that \\"the euro is stronger than ever\\". The EEC referendum took place on 5 June 1975 and, on a 64% turnout, returned a result of 67% in favour of continuing membership. The United Kingdom remained a member of the EEC and its successor, the European Union, until 31 January 2020 when it withdrew from the Union following the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum.

He was involved in the design and operation of the experimental Dragon reactor, which used helium as a coolant. He was also an advocate of space exploration, serving as the president of the British Interplanetary Society and the International Astronautical Federation. Early life Leslie Robert Shepherd was born on 23 November 1918, in Pontycymmer, Wales, where his father, William Shepherd, was a station master. Although his family moved to London when he was a teenager, he retained a Welsh accent. When he was six years old he suffered an infection that left him deaf in his left ear. He entered University College, London, where he studied physics. On the outbreak of the Second World War he drafted into the British Army, serving in the Royal Corps of Signals, but was allowed to return to University College to complete his degree. He graduated in 1940 with a BSc with first-class honours. During the war he worked at the Mond Laboratory at the University of Cambridge, where he was engaged in testing electronic fuses for naval guns. After the war ended Sir Arthur Vick persuaded him to remain at Cambridge and pursue postgraduate studies at St Catharine's College, Cambridge. He married Elsie Lodge in 1947; they had one son. He completed his PhD in 1948, writing his thesis on \\"Magnetic Spectrometer Studies on Radioactive Isotopes\\". Nuclear reactors In 1948, Shepherd joined the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell, Oxfordshire. In 1956, he was deputy head of the group that developed the Dragon reactor, an experimental high temperature gas- cooled reactor that investigated the use of helium as a coolant. Construction commenced in 1959 at Winfrith in Dorset, and the reactor became operational in 1965. In addition to the use of helium, Dragon incorporated many groundbreaking technologies. Efficiency was improved by omitting the metal cladding on the fuel elements, with the idea that gaseous fission products could be removed with filters. It was found that most were retained within the fuel elements, resulting in the development of a new coating for fuel pellets. It also investigated the thorium fuel cycle, which held great promise. Shepherd became the chief executive of the project three years later, and remained in the job until the project was cancelled in 1975. This came as a grave disappointment to Shepherd, who was convinced of the safety, efficiency and commercial viability of the helium-cooled reactor design. After a sabbatical in the United States, Shepherd returned to Winfrith in 1978, and remained there until he retired in 1983. Space travel Shepherd joined the British Interplanetary Society, a space advocacy organisation, in 1935, but had little involvement with it before the war. However, he was present at its first meeting after the war ended in 1945, and became a member of its governing council and its technical director in 1946. In 1950, he helped found the International Astronautical Federation (IAF), and organised its second annual conference in London in 1951. He served as its president from 1956 to 1957, and stepped in again in 1962 following the death of the IAF's president, the French mathematician Joseph P√©r√®s. He succeeded the science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke as the chairman of the British Interplanetary Society in 1953 and later served as chairman and president from 1957 to 1960, and 1966 to 1967. He also became one of the founding members of the International Academy of Astronautics in 1959. Unaware of earlier secret research carried out in the United States on nuclear rocket propulsion since 1946, Shepherd teamed up with British rocket scientist Val Cleaver to produce a series of groundbreaking scientific papers published in the Journal of the British Interplanetary Society in 1948 and 1949, that considered how nuclear technology might be applied to interplanetary travel. The papers examined both nuclear-thermal and nuclear-electric propulsion, methods that were subsequently proved to be practical.; ; ; Shepherd followed this with a 1952 paper on interstellar travel, the first scientific treatment of the problem. Here, the distances involved were orders of magnitude greater. Shepherd considered nuclear propulsion based on nuclear fission, nuclear fusion and antimatter. The existence of antimatter had been theorised by Paul Dirac, and the positron had been discovered in 1932, but the antiproton was not discovered until 1955 by Emilio Segr√®, and in 1952 many scientists doubted its existence. Shepherd noted that the effects of time dilation meant that interstellar voyages requiring centuries of travel could still be conducted in a human lifespan if sufficiently high speeds could be generated. He continued publishing papers on nuclear rocket technology, including one with Giovanni Vulpetti, into the 1990s. Personal life Shepherd's wife died in 1979, and in 1981 he married Ruth Margaret Howard, a co-worker at Winfrith. He died on 18 February 2012.

Elsa Gardner (9 January 1894 ‚Äì 8 February 1963) was an American aeronautical engineer. She was the first woman admitted as a full member of the Engineers Club of Dayton. Biography Maude Elsa Gardner was better known as Elsa Gardner. She was born in Brooklyn, New York on January 9, 1894, to Herbert, an Irish American draperies merchant, and Emily Maude Garner of Canadian extraction. When she was six she had an illness that left one leg shorter than the other which caused a long term limp.  Education and Career  Her family were well off and she went to St. Lawrence University where she studied mechanical engineering and mathematics, alongside Greek, Latin, French, German and English Literature. She felt her father intended her to become a teacher. After graduating from college in 1916 Gardner worked as a statistician until the outbreak of the First World War. She began to work for the British Ministry of Munitions of War in New York City as a gauge examiner. From there she began to work for Bliss Company Torpedo Works on behalf of the U.S. Navy. She worked on process improvement for the standards of torpedo gauges. Then she laid the testing range at Sag Harbor. She later described the experience as the \\"noise was deafening and the dirt pretty awful, but they were more than counterbalanced by the interesting things going on all round me.\\" Gardner decided she wanted a career in engineering and studied engineering further with New York University, and Pratt Institute. She worked during the day and studied at night, in direct opposition to her father who said \\"the more you learn, the less you earn\\" and refused to financially support her further study. Gardner then won a scholarship to study at the aeronautical engineering department of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and wrote and editied the Aero Digest magazine to top up her funds. She was a contemporary of aeronautical engineer Elsie MacGill, later known as \\"Queen of the Hurricanes\\". She encountered more issues at MIT when the shop work requirement involved working for the naval yard at Hartford, where the commander felt she would flirt with the men and distract them from their work. Gardner wrote him an indignant letter pointing out amongst other things that as a member of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers she would \\"hardly be likely to flirt with mechanics\\". She was allowed in and later commented \\"they were very meek about it\\" when she got there. Gardner was one of boarders in Manhattan's Panhellenic Tower. After the end of the war and during the Great Depression Gardner worked for various companies including Wright Aeronautical Corp. in Paterson, New Jersey and as a bibliographer, statistician, and civil engineering Project Examiner. Gardner also worked in New York City for the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) writing abstracts and reviewing literature. She created a card index system organising aeronautical, mechanical, and automotive subjects. She also worked as a review editor and contributor for Aero Digest Magazine. Gardner wrote the Technical Data Digest, a twice-monthly publication that contained around 300 article abstracts in each issue, from America, British, French, German and Italian technical magazines. It was also published in the Journal of Aeronautical Sciences. She was based in at Wright Field in Dayton, Ohio. Her work was instrumental in keeping the U.S. military and commercial sectors up to date and connected. Gardner continued to work for the military through the Second World War. Between 1941 and 1960, she worked as an aeronautical engineer in the US Navy Bureau of Aeronautics, then on the staff of the US Navy‚Äôs Bureau of Naval Weapons Technical Library until her retirement in the autumn of 1962.  Memberships  As a result of her work Garder was the first woman to be invited to join both the Institute of the Aeronautical Sciences (IAS) and the Institute of Aeronautical Sciences (later to become the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics). She joined the Engineers Club of Dayton in 1936 as their first woman member. Gardner joined the British Women's Engineering Society in 1929, going on to sit on the governing Council as the American representative and keeping up a lively cross Atlantic correspondence until the Seond World War. Her speech on Women Engineers to the Altrusa Club, a chain of American clubs for business and professional women, was published in their International Altrusan magazine and by the Women's Engineering Society in 1937. In this speech she explained that whilst engineering jobs for women were hard to find in her youth, she had made sure that she joined, and then attended the meetings of as many engineering organisations as possible so that she became a familiar figure and was harder to dismiss. She was a long term resident of Washington and a member of the New York Avenue Presbyterian Church.  Death  She was diagnosed with cancer in 1962 and died at Doctor's Hospital in Washington on 8 February 1963.

It is billed as the most literal translation of the Bible into the modern English language. The first edition was published on February 2, 2020.\\"Get the LSV\\" LSVBible.com. Retrieved May 18, 2020.  History  Work on the Literal Standard Version began in early 2018 with completion of the first edition shortly before its February 2020 publication. U.S. copyright was obtained in January 2020. The translation team made the digital version freely available shortly after release. The LSV became available on eBook platforms such as Kindle, Nook, and Kobo in May 2020, as well as on Bible apps e-Sword and MySword.  Translation philosophy  As expounded in the Preface, the translators have defined their translation philosophy as follows: \\"The goal of any good translation is to produce a readable text that preserves the original autographic meaning and comes as close as possible to translating, word-for- word, manuscripts that accurately represent the original writings.\\" Regarding Scripture in general, the translators have taken a conservative approach, adhering to both inerrancy and infallibility, while recognizing that this high view of Scripture ultimately applies only to the original Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek autographs.\\"The Preface to the Literal Standard Version\\" LSVBible.com. Retrieved May 18, 2020. The Introduction defines a threefold philosophy that undergirds the translation: \\"Since context and sentence structure are as vital to translation as capturing the proper meaning of each word, the translators of the LSV have used these three key principles in translation: 1. Preservation of verb tenses, 2. Consistent word-for-word translation, and 3. Preservation of word order when readability is unimpacted, but revised word order when necessary for readability.\\"  Textual basis  The LSV is a major revision of Robert Young's Literal Translation. The Old Testament is based upon the Masoretic Text (MT) with strong influence from the Septuagint (LXX). As an example, the LXX chronology in Genesis is set next to the MT. The Dead Sea Scrolls were consulted in places. The New Testament is based upon the Textus Receptus and Majority Text, although the translators consulted other manuscripts: \\"...in certain, specific instances other manuscript versions and text-types are used where the evidence seems incontrovertible (e.g., the LXX and DSS in the Hebrew and Aramaic; the Alexandrian in the Greek).\\"  Distinctive features  Like a growing number of translations, the LSV uses a name, rather than a title, in translating the Tetragrammaton. However, the transliterated Tetragrammaton (YHWH) is used instead of Yahweh out of respect for the differing bodies of research on the pronunciation of the unpointed name. Besides the Tetragrammaton, the two most distinctive features of the LSV include its use of justified text blocks throughout mimicking the style of the ancient manuscripts and as an attempt to regard the entirety of Scripture as equally important, and the use of the caesura mark to distinguish lines of poetic literature. Given its highly literal nature, the translation has been described as mechanically word-for-word, which inclines it towards a higher reading level, ideal for deeper research into the meaning of the original languages and the study of biblical idioms and intra-biblical cross references, although it is significantly easier to read than Robert Young's 1862 translation. Similar to the New King James Version, the LSV capitalizes all pronouns and most nouns referring to God, Christ, the Holy Spirit, and the Angel or Messenger of the Lord. The way in which the LSV handles verb tenses, particularly in regard to the Hebrew Old Testament, is best summarized by the arguments presented in Robert Young's original preface to his 1862 translation.  Formats  The LSV has been released in formats such as paperback, hardcover, Kindle, Nook, Kobo, Apple Book, PDF, EPUB, theWord, e-Sword, and MySword, with leather-bound and DBL Paratext-based publications forthcoming.

Operational history In a 1994 review Richard Sherwood wrote, \\"Worldcruiser feels that the sails on a boat over 40 feet should be small enough to handle without a large crew and that two-masted rigs are the answer. In light weather, flying a genoa instead of the headsails, and with a gollywobbler in place of the foresail and fisherman, the boat has a total sail area of over 2,000 square feet.\\" See also *List of sailing boat types Similar sailboats *Alden 44 *Nauticat 44 References Category:Keelboats Category:1980s sailboat type designs Category:Sailing yachts ","title":"Worldcruiser 44"},{"id":"63998408","text":"The entrance to the Camley Street Natural Park from Camley Street.

Biography Ma Sik-chun and his older brother Ma Sik-yu came from Chiu Chow, Guangdong. They eventually relocated to Hong Kong. The Ma brothers became associates of Ng Shek-ho, a major drug trafficker in Hong Kong. It was alleged that the Ma brothers began trafficking heroin from 1967 onward, with Ma Sik- chun earning the nickname \\"Golden Ma\\". At the time, Ma Sik-chun was in charge of street gangs and distribution. For their procurement of heroin, the Ma brothers aligned themselves with Laos general Ouane Rattikone. Ma Sik-chun was considered one of the biggest drug lords in Asia. The brothers founded the Oriental Daily News in 1969. In 1977, warrants were issued for the arrest of the brothers for the importation of 700 tonnes of opium into Hong Kong between 1968 and 1974. Ma Sik-chun's brother, Ma Sik-yu escaped to Taiwan, where there was no extradition treaty with Hong Kong. Ma Sik-chun stayed in Hong Kong, and was charged in August 1977. He was granted bail of HK$500,000 cash plus two sureties totaling HK$1 million. He escaped bail and was smuggled to Taiwan in 1978. A further warrant for his arrest was issued on September 25, 1978. On arrival in Taiwan, he was arrested for illegal entry but was freed one year later. The ownership of Oriental Daily News passed to his son Ma Ching-kwan. In 1998, the British Conservative Party was caught in a political scandal after it was revealed that Ma Ching-kwan donated ¬£1 million to the party in 1994. The scandal surfaced after Ma Ching-kwan demanded the donation back, and receipt of the donation, along with a picture of Prime Minister John Major meeting Ma Ching-kwan at 10 Downing Street, was published on the paper. Accounts emerged that the donation was made with the condition of the safe return of Ma Sik-chun to Hong Kong. The Conservative Party did not deny the donation, but denied that any conditions were attached. William Hague, then leader of the Conservative Party, agreed to hand the money back on the basis that it was foreign money. In 2010, Oriental Press sued the companies behind five websites, including Wikipedia, for publishing allegedly defamatory statements. The complaints were mainly about the drug trafficking history of its founder, the Ma brothers, found on the Chinese Wikipedia. The Wikimedia Foundation, as a company registered in California, had ignored the court summon and was absent from the trial. The Oriental Press Group therefore received a favorable ruling on paper, including damage claim and an injunction order in August 2010. The articles remained on Chinese Wikipedia. Multiple attempts to return Ma Sik-chun was made before his death, including one in 2014 where his lawyer claimed that it is his \\"dying wish\\" to return to Hong Kong, and that jumping bail was not an offence in Hong Kong until 1994. He died at the Taipei Veterans General Hospital in Taiwan at age 77.

Luis Nava promete acelerar la creacion del distrito de Mi Per√∫... - YouTube The investigative committee formed in Congress to investigate the alleged irregularities of the second Garc√≠a administration, said in a report, an alleged imbalance in their accounts (that is, a difference between their justified income and their expenses). Nava indicated in due course to the media that the aforementioned report was prepared in violation of his constitutional rights with erroneous information and without conforming to the truth, and that there was no imbalance. The prosecution agreed with the decision of July 2, 2018, ordering the filing of the investigation, indicating that the commission's report contained gross errors. Controversies Cited before the Lava Jato Commission in Congress, Nava acknowledged that the Nava & Huesa Law Firm and the Transportes Don Reyna company had commercial relations with Odebrecht. It is known that Transportes Don Reyna, whose manager since 2006 was his son Jos√© Antonio, received US$18 million for services rendered to Odebrecht, as a contractor for works such as the Interoce√°nica del Sur highway and Transvase Olmos. In April 2019, the prosecutor of the Lava Jato Case, Jos√© Domingo P√©rez, decided to expand the investigation of the case of Line 1 of the Lima Metro, including both Nava and his son Jos√© Antonio Nava Mendiola, investigated in the alleged money laundering offense. According to the investigation, Nava Guibert have received US$4 million from Box 2 of the Odebrecht company. Part of that money, according to documents published by IDL Reporters, would have been transferred to the account of Miguel Atala, former vice president of Petroper√∫, that was discovered in the Banca Privada d'Andorra. Her son, Jos√© Antonio Nava Mendiola, manager of Transportes Don Reyna, also reportedly received almost half a million dollars from Odebrecht. This information was provided by the same company Odebrecht, after doing a search on their computer system, in which those involved were given key names (codenames): Luis Nava's was CHALAN, and his son's was BANDIDO. The prosecution's thesis pointed out that both would be figureheads for someone in a higher position, who would be none other than president Alan Garc√≠a himself. The prosecution requested both of them to be prevented from leaving the country for 18 months (April 10, 2019), which was granted by the judge. In his defense, Nava strongly denied having received money from Odebrecht and threatened to sue the journalists who published the investigation. Then he went into a clinic, citing heart problems. As for her son, he left the country for the United States, on April 10, 2019, the same day that the prosecution requested his impediment to leave the country. According to his father, he did it for health reasons. On April 16, 2019, the preliminary detention was ordered for ten days for Luis Nava and his son. In the same court order was included former president Alan Garc√≠a, who would commit suicide the following morning, on April 17, 2019. Luis Nava would continue in the clinic under police custody. His son, who was still in the United States, tried to transfer all his accounts from Peru to an account opened in the northern country, as revealed by the prosecutor Rafael Vela Barba. The Financial Intelligence Unit (UIF), at the request of the prosecution, froze all the Nava accounts. Soon after, the prosecution announced that Jos√© Antonio Nava Mendiola, like Miguel Atala and his son Samir Atala, had accepted the sincere confession. Jos√© Antonio Nava, who was in Miami, told prosecutors of the Lava Jato case, that on several occasions, that Jorge Barata himself (Odebrecht representative in Peru) asked him to bring briefcases to his father, which he never opened, but who presumed they kept money. In other occasions, he simply took Barata to his father's house to leave the briefcases. At one point, his father confirmed that it was Odebrecht money. Based on his confession, Jos√© Antonio Nava Mendiola changed his legal situation for that of restricted appearance, and returned to Peru on May 7, 2019. Luis Nava was given preventive detention for 36 months, being admitted to the Castro Castro Prison on April 30, 2019.

An epidemiologist by profession, he directed a bilharzia research laboratory in Salisbury and later worked with the World Health Organization on parasitic disease projects.  Medical career  Alves was of Scottish origin. Alves earned his Bachelor of Arts from a South African university. He pursued his doctorate at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, but had to return to Southern Rhodesia in 1947 before completing his degree.

He also belonged to the department of parasitology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. He was considered an international authority on bilharzia, and during his tenure at the laboratory developed a treatment for the disease that was successfully tested on 25 patients. He served on the World Health Organization (WHO) expert committee on parasitic diseases. In 1958, he led a WHO project in the Philippines.

First mentioned there in the 15th century, family moved in the second half of the century towards northwest, where the members of the family gained new estates from the king Matthias Korvin in Graƒçac and Grab in the Lika Region. During the following centuries, they were appointed to various military and other services in the Habsburg Monarchy army. At the beginning of the 19th century some of the distinguished family members, being notable high-ranking army officers, moved to Meƒëimurje, the northernmost part of Croatia, where they acquired new possessions. The last of them, Ivo Kne≈æeviƒá, died in 1924 without leaving a successor.  Family history  Like many of old Croatian noble families from the southeastern part of the medieval Croatian Kingdom and other nearby states or territories (Kingdom of Bosnia, Zachlumia, Travunia), the Kne≈æeviƒás were forced, following the increasing Ottoman threat and territorial expansion, to withdraw and abandon their homes and to move northwestwards. After the medieval Kingdom of Bosnia was occupied by the Ottoman Empire in 1463, Croato-Hungarian king Matthias Corvinus confirmed the nobility status of Ivan/John Kne≈æeviƒá, a son of Filip/Phillip Kne≈æeviƒá, a nobleman who had fallen during the Siege of Jajce, and gave him estates in Lika (Graƒçac and Grab), per charter dated 2 July 1466. Ivan Kne≈æeviƒá's great-grandson Franjo/Francis Kne≈æeviƒá received acknowledgement of his possessions from the king Ferdinand II of Habsburg on 15 May 1628. Franjo was commander of defence of the Krbava area (eastern Lika), but lost almost all of his possessions following the Ottoman occupation. Only when the Ottomans were expelled from Lika by the end of the 17th century and the beginning of the 18th century, Kne≈æeviƒá family regained its old estates. At that time the head of the family was Juraj/George Kne≈æeviƒá, major of the Croatian Military Frontier Lika Infantry Regiment of the Habsburg imperial army, who married Katarina n√©e Stibor, a noble woman from Senj. Their son Martin (1708‚Äì1781) made further progress, being promoted to major-general on 11 February 1759. He took part in many battles and wars during his career, e. g. War of the Austrian Succession (1740‚Äì1748) and Seven Years' War (1756‚Äì1763). In 1762 Martin Kne≈æeviƒá was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresa for his extraordinary military merits. On 7 April 1763 he was given the hereditary title of baron. His wife Ur≈°ula/Ursula n√©e Vukasoviƒá (1717‚Äì1776) bore him a lot of children, among which were six sons: * Juraj/George (1733‚Äì1805), major-general * Antun/Anthony (1737‚Äì1809), lieutenant-colonel * Ivan/John (1743‚Äì1809), major-general * Petar/Peter (1746‚Äì1814), major-general * Lavoslav/Leopold (died 1788/89?), captain * Vinko/Vincent (1755‚Äì1832), General of the cavalry In 1802 some of the Kne≈æeviƒá brothers (Ivan, Petar and Vinko) moved to Meƒëimurje County, the northernmost part of Croatia. They bought (or exchanged for their possessions in Lika) the former estate of the Pauline monastery in Sveta Jelena, furthermore Maƒçkovec, Zasadbreg, Knezovec, ≈†trigova and Leskovec. At the same time they took the title of \\"Kne≈æeviƒás of Sveta Jelena\\" (Saint Helen, ). Only two of six brothers had children of their own, Petar and Vinko. Petar married Viktorija/Victoria n√©e Bender and fathered Maksimilijan Ivan/Maximilian John in 1804 and Aleksandar Franjo Kazimir/Alexander Francis Casimir in 1809. In Vinko's marriage with baroness Karolina/Caroline n√©e Hogger two sons were born as well: Aleksandar (1810) and Konstantin/Constantin (1811). When general Vinko Kne≈æeviƒá died in 1832, estates in Sveta Jelena were sold to the Fe≈°tetiƒá family, who already owned the largest part of the county. Estates in ≈†trigova and its surroundings remained in possession of the Kne≈æeviƒá family until 1924. It is known that Viktor/Victor Kne≈æeviƒá, a descendant of Petar Kne≈æeviƒá, who was retired and non-married Hussar captain, lived at his ≈†trigova estate in 1898. After the World War I, two descendant remained, living in Meƒëimurje: Aleksandar and Ivo/Johnny. The latter died in 1924, leaving a will according to which the whole collection of the family portraits were donated to the Croatian History Museum in Zagreb.

Stepanov rose from private to officer during World War I and held brigade command during the Russian Civil War. Between the wars, he held command and staff positions and was decorated for his actions in the Winter War. He commanded the 27th Rifle Division in Belarus during the Battle of Bia≈Çystok‚ÄìMinsk and was killed in action while escaping from encirclement.  Early life, World War I, and Russian Civil War  Stepanov was born on 30 August 1893 to a Russian peasant family in the village of Pepel, Soligalichsky Uyezd, Kostroma Governorate. He graduated from primary school and a city school before working at the Petrograd Post Office as a postal clerk. During World War I, Stepanov was mobilized into the Imperial Russian Army in September 1914 and sent to the Krasnoye Selo Reserve Rifle Battalion of the Petrograd Military District as a private. In April 1915 he became a junker at the Oranienbaum School of Praporshchiks, graduating as a praporshchik (ensign) in July of that year. Stepanov was sent to the Western Front, where he served as a junior officer and company commander with the 272nd Infantry Regiment of the 68th Infantry Division. He was awarded three orders for his actions and rose to the rank of staff captain. Due to illness, he was hospitalized for a year beginning in August 1917. After leaving the hospital, Stepanov joined the Red Army during the Russian Civil War on 2 September 1918 and was appointed a vsevobuch military training instructor of the Soligalichsky Uyezd military commissariat. From February 1919 he commanded the Communist Regiment of the 2nd Brigade of the 29th Rifle Division of the 3rd Army, leading it on fighting on the Eastern Front against the White forces of Alexander Kolchak in the areas of Tyumen, Ishim, Perm, and Glazov. After taking command of the brigade in August, he and the division where relocated to the Western Front for the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War. In the latter, they fought as part of the southern group of the 15th Army in the area of Lepel, Vileyka, Borisov, Molodechno, and Lida. After the end of the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War, Stepanov commanded the Separate Reserve Rifle Regiment of the 3rd Army at Vitebsk, then became assistant commander of the 5th Saratov Rifle Division. From January 1921 he served as chief of the junior advanced courses of the Western Front under the division, and in November became commander of its 37th Rifle Regiment. With the unit, Stepanov participated in the elimination of anti-Soviet forces in the border area.  Interwar period  After the end of the war, Stepanov continued to serve with the 5th Rifle Division, becoming assistant commander of its 13th RIfle Regiment in June 1922 and chief of staff of its 15th Rifle Regiment in August 1923. Appointed chief of the intelligence department of the staff of the 4th Rifle Corps in October 1925, Stepanov was sent to study at the Intelligence Courses of Improvement for Command Personnel under the Intelligence Directorate. After completing the courses in September 1927, he was sent to the Separate Red Banner Caucasus Army, being appointed commander of the 1st Caucasian Rifle Regiment of the 1st Caucasian Rifle Division in Batumi. His service there proved brief as he was transferred to the Moscow Military District in January 1928 to command the 54th Rifle Regiment of the 18th Rifle Division at Rostov. Having completed the Vystrel course in 1930, Stepanov served as assistant chief of staff of the 3rd Rifle Corps in Ivanovo from December 1931. He became chief of staff of the 14th Rifle Division at Vologda in July 1937 and commanded the division from May 1939, being awarded the Order of the Red Star in 1938 and promoted to kombrig on 19 April 1939. During the Winter War he fought with the 8th Army as assistant commander of the 1st Rifle Corps. For his performance, Stepanov was awarded the Order of the Red Banner on 22 May 1940. Appointed commander of the 27th Rifle Division in May, he became a major general on 4 June when the Red Army introduced general officer ranks, and was awarded a second Order of the Red Star in February 1941.  World War II  The division was assigned to the 4th Rifle Corps of the 3rd Army and stationed in the area of August√≥w. The day before Operation Barbarossa began on 22 June, Stepanov reluctantly agreed to the proposal of the commander of his 345th Rifle Regiment, Colonel V. K. Solodovnikov, that the latter be allowed to move his regiment forward to prepared defensive positions. After Operation Barbarossa began, Stepanov led the division in the Battle of Bia≈Çystok‚ÄìMinsk. On 22 and 23 June the division defended in the area of August√≥w against the attacks of the German 162nd Infantry Division. It was unable to hold its positions and on 23 June retreated to the south, where it attempted to hold positions. With the corps, the 27th was encircled near the Shchara and suffered heavy losses to German air and tank attacks. By 29 June both the division and corps were effectively destroyed. Stepanov led the remnants of the division out of the encirclement, escaping with General Ivan Boldin's group. As Boldin's group broke out of the encirclement near Yartsevo on 11 August, Stepanov was killed by a shell fragment. He was posthumously awarded the Order of Lenin on 15 August; Boldin's recommendation for the award read simply \\"for courage in the battles between 22 and 27 June [he] is deserving of the Order of Lenin\\". Stepanov was buried in the center of the Neyelovsky sovkhoz, Safonovsky District, Smolensk Oblast.  Awards and honors  Stepanov was a recipient of the following decorations, in addition to an honorary weapon: * Order of Lenin * Order of the Red Banner * Order of the Red Star (2) * Jubilee Medal \\"XX Years of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army\\"  References  Citations  Bibliography =  * * Category:1893 births Category:1941 deaths Category:People from Soligalichsky District Category:People from Kostroma Governorate Category:Soviet major generals Category:Russian military personnel of World War I Category:Soviet military personnel of the Russian Civil War Category:People of the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War Category:Soviet military personnel of the Winter War Category:Soviet military personnel killed in World War II Category:Recipients of the Order of Lenin Category:Recipients of the Order of the Red Banner ","title":"Aleksandr Stepanov (general)"},{"id":"63998966","text":"The 1895 Crescent Athletic Club football team was an American football team that represented the Crescent Athletic Club in the American Football Union (AFU) during the 1895 college football season.

Crescent was scheduled to play the Orange Athletic Club for the AFU championship on November 16, but Orange objected to Phil King playing for the Crescents on grounds that he had previously been paid to coach for Princeton and was therefore not an amateur. The Crescents denied the Orange contention that King was disqualified under the AFU rules. The Orange club scheduled a game with Yale on the day that had been set with the Crescents. On the date set for the game, the Crescents appeared on the field without an opponent, ran one play for a touchdown, and claimed a disputed UFA championship. W. D. Hotchkiss, a former player at Williams College, was the team captain and played at the center position. Other key players included Phil King and Harry Beecher at quarterback, Juan Smith at halfback, and Billy Ohl at fullback. During the season, most of the players lived at the Crescent Athletic Club's clubhouse and ate at the clubhouse's training table. The new clubhouse opened in mid-October 1985.

The inspectors general removed were Michael K. Atkinson, Intelligence, on April 3; Glenn Fine (acting), Defense, April 7; Christi Grimm (acting), Health and Human Services, May 1; Mitch Behm (acting), Transportation, May 15; and Steve Linick, State, May 15. In four of the cases the announcement was made late on a Friday night in a classic Friday news dump. In several cases the fired IGs had taken an action which Trump disliked, so that the dismissals were widely described as \\"retaliation\\". In two other cases, questions were raised about whether the dismissals related to ongoing IG investigations into the conduct of the cabinet secretary in charge of that department. The cumulative firings were often described as a \\"purge\\" or as a \\"war on watchdogs\\". Inspectors General Inspectors General are oversight officials assigned to various agencies within the executive branch of the US federal government, such as cabinet departments. Established by the Inspector General Act of 1978, the offices of inspectors general are responsible for identifying, auditing, and investigating fraud, waste, abuse, embezzlement and mismanagement of any kind within executive departments and agencies.Full text of the Inspector General Act of 1978 on wikisource.org IG investigations may come about through any of several sources: complaints from within the department, often anonymous and often through a \\"whistleblower\\" system or hotline for such reports; requests for an investigation from a Congress member or Congressional committee; and the IG's own initiative. IGs are appointed by the president and are supposed to be confirmed by the Senate, although many current IGs are in an acting capacity and have not been confirmed by the Senate. The president may dismiss an inspector general, but is supposed to give Congress 30 days' notice and an explanation of the reason for removing them. The 30 days' notice requirement was added to the 1978 law in 2008; its purpose was to re-emphasize the role of the IG as an independent watchdog and to dissuade presidents from retaliatory firings. Previously in 1981, Ronald Reagan fired 16 inspector generals when he became president, with his administration explaining that Reagan intended to hire his own people. After Congress objected, Reagan rehired 5 of the fired inspector generals. In 1989, George H. W. Bush also attempted to dismiss all the inspector generals upon becoming president, but after the inspector generals and Congress objected, Bush relented. In 2009, President Barack Obama dismissed Corporation for National and Community Service inspector general Gerald Walpin citing a lack of confidence in him. After Congress objected to the lack of explanation, the Obama administration cited that Walpin had shown \\"troubling and inappropriate conduct\\", and pointed to an incident that year where Walpin was \\"disoriented\\" during a board meeting of the Corporation, which led to the board asking for Walpin's dismissal. Walpin sued for a reinstatement, but the courts ruled against Walpin. Most of the Trump administration's announcements were made late on Friday nights, a very low-profile time, so that the dismissals have been referred to as a \\"Friday night massacre\\", a reference to Richard Nixon's Saturday Night Massacre firing of Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox. Dismissed inspectors generalIntelligence community= Michael K. Atkinson, the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community, was dismissed April 7, 2020 On Friday night, April 7, at 10 p.m., Trump sent a letter to Congress saying he intended to dismiss Michael K. Atkinson, the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community, giving as a reason only that he had \\"lost confidence\\" in the IG. Trump has described Atkinson as disloyal for his role in forwarding the whistleblower complaint which led to Trump's impeachment. The dismissal followed a pattern of retaliation against others Trump blamed for aiding the impeachment, including Gordon Sondland and Alexander Vindman. In theory the dismissal becomes effective 30 days after Congress is notified, but Trump placed Atkinson on administrative leave for the 30 days so that in effect the dismissal was immediate. When Trump was asked about the firing the next day, he criticized Atkinson as having done a \\"terrible job\\": \\"took a fake report and he brought it to Congress\\", in reference to the whistleblower complaint of the Trump‚ÄìUkraine scandal, which was actually largely verified by other testimony and evidence. Trump further complained that Atkinson \\"never even came in to see me. How can you [forward the complaint] without seeing the person?\\" Trump concluded that Atkinson was \\"not a big Trump fan\\". Atkinson said in a statement that he was fired for having \\"faithfully discharged my legal obligations as an independent and impartial Inspector General\\". =Department of Defense= Glenn Fine Glenn Fine was effectively removed from his position as acting inspector general for the Department of Defense on April 7 when Trump named another person to the acting inspector general post. Fine then resumed his role as principal deputy inspector general, a Senate-confirmed post. Fine had been appointed on March 30 to head the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee, an oversight body for funds voted by Congress to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, by the Chair of the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency, as mandated by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act. But only inspectors general can serve on the committee, so that Fine was in effect fired from that role eight days after assuming it. When Trump signed the coronavirus funding bill, he had issued a signing statement challenging the required oversight committee, and said that he personally would take the oversight role and would be in control of what information was sent to Congress about the use of the $2 trillion in relief funds authorized by the bill. Seven weeks later, on May 26, Fine submitted his resignation as principal deputy inspector general, effective June 1. A Pentagon official said Fine resigned voluntarily and was not pushed out. In a statement Fine gave no reason for resigning but said inspectors general \\"are a vital component of our system of checks and balances, and I am grateful to have been part of that system. After many years in the DoJ and DoD OIGs, I believe the time has come for me to step down and allow others to perform this vital role.\\" Former defense secretary James Mattis praised Fine, saying \\"It's regrettable seeing such a highly competent, non-partisan patriot and public servant leaving government service. Mr. Glenn Fine represents all that is noble in taking on the hard work of keeping government honest and responsive. He will be missed.\\" =Department of Health and Human Services= Christi Grimm Department of Health and Human Services IG report on test availability and response by Trump at the April 6 White House Coronavirus Task Force briefing At 8 p.m. on Friday, May 1, it was announced that the White House would nominate a permanent inspector general to replace Christi Grimm, the acting inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services. Grimm was to return to her regular position as principal deputy inspector general. Trump had earlier criticized Grimm for signing off on an April 6 report saying that the nation's hospitals were suffering from severe shortages of personal protective equipment and testing supplies. At the time Trump was asked by a reporter about the report, and he said \\"It's wrong. Did I hear the word 'inspector general'? It's wrong.\\" He also demanded to know the name and history of the IG who produced the report, saying it might have been influenced by politics. Trump continued to insist that there were no shortages. On Twitter, Trump stated that Grimm's report was \\"Another Fake Dossier\\", and stressed that Grimm had worked for the Obama administration, even though Grimm had worked for the health inspector general office's since 1999, for two more administrations before Obama's. He also stated at a press conference that the report was just Grimm's \\"opinion\\", even after being informed that Grimm's report was based on a survey of 323 hospitals. =Department of State= Steve Linick On Friday, May 15, at 10 p.m., the White House announced that State Department inspector general Steve Linick had been removed. Trump appointed Stephen Akard, the director of the State Department's Office of Foreign Missions, as acting inspector general. The White House said Trump had dismissed Linick at the request of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Linick had been investigating whether Pompeo had used government employees to run personal errands for him. In a separate, almost completed investigation, Linick was reportedly looking into whether Pompeo had evaded Congressional limitations on arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates by declaring an emergency, even though none existed. A third line of inquiry into Pompeo was his regular hosting of several dozen lavish, taxpayer-funded \\"Madison Dinners\\" at the State Department for hundreds of attendees, including many influential business and media figures; there were concerns that Pompeo had been using the dinners to further his own political career (assembling the names and contact information of possible future contributors and fundraisers), rather than for official diplomatic purposes, potentially violating the Hatch Act. Pompeo defended his recommendation to remove the IG, said he \\"should've done it some time ago\\", and dismissed the accusations as \\"crazy stuff\\", but he did not provide any justification for the IG removal. He initially said his action could not have been retaliatory because he had not been aware of any of the investigations; however, he later acknowledged that he had provided written responses to one of the IG probes. He faces calls to testify before Congress, even though the White House would likely block such an appearance. On May 22, the Houston Chronicle editorial board said that regarding Linick's dismissal, there is \\"growing concern it was engineered to derail ongoing investigations\\" into Pompeo. In a private interview on June 3 with the House Foreign Affairs Committee and House Oversight Committee, Linick confirmed that prior to his dismissal, he had been investigating allegations of misuse of government resources\\" against Pompeo and his wife, and had request documents from Pompeo's executive secretary. Linick said that shortly before he was fired, he had sought to interview Pompeo about an \\"emergency\\" arms deal with Saudi Arabia, and that that a senior State Department official, Stephen Biegun, had repeatedly attempted to \\"bully\\" him into stymieing inquiries.Kyle Cheney, Ex- State watchdog says he was fired after trying to interview Pompeo, Politico (June 3, 2020). Linick told congressional investigators, \\"I have not heard any valid reason that would justify my removal.\\" The House committees investigating the dismissal are seeking interviews with a number of other high-ranking officials in Trump's State Department. In August 2020 the three committees subpoenaed four State Department officials to testify about Linick's dismissal, saying that the subpoenas were necessary because the State Department had been \\"stonewalling\\" their investigation. In August 2020 Acting Inspector General Akard resigned after less than three months on the job. An internal email said that he was returning to the private sector, and that Deputy Inspector General Diana Shaw would become acting inspector general. On August 31 Pompeo appointed Matthew Klimow, the U.S. ambassador to Turkmenistan, to serve as acting inspector general until the end of 2020. He intends to eventually return to his post in Turkmenistan. The State Department did not announce his appointment but confirmed it after it was reported. =Department of Transportation= United States Department of Transportation Deputy Inspector General Mitch Behm Also on Friday night, May 15, it was announced that Mitch Behm, the acting inspector general for the Department of Transportation, would be replaced by another acting inspector general while a permanent inspector general is nominated. Behm returned to his position as deputy inspector general. As acting inspector general, Behm was a member of the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee. House Democrats opened an inquiry into whether Behm's dismissal was related to an ongoing IG investigation of Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, evaluating claims that she had been giving preferential treatment to the state of Kentucky, where her husband, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, is running for re-election. Howard \\"Skip\\" Elliot was named acting IG, while retaining his position as head of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), an agency within the Department of Transportation. The \\"dual-hat\\" arrangement was criticized by the chairs of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and Oversight Subcommittee on Government Operations (Carolyn B. Maloney, Peter A. DeFazio, and Gerald E. Connolly, respectively). Maloney, DeFazio, and Connolly wrote that Elliot had an \\"inherent conflict of interest\\" since he would simultaneously report to Chao in his capacity as PHMSA administrator while also being responsible for investigating and auditing Chao's office in his capacity as acting inspector general. Elliot said that he would \\"defer to Deputy Inspector General Behm\\" on matters involving PHMSA, but made no commitment to \\"recusing himself from the 13 current investigations and 11 ongoing audits involving the Office of the Secretary.\\" Maloney, DeFazio, and Connolly called upon Chao to reinstate Behm as acting IG and called upon Elliot to resign as PHMSA administration and recuse himself from any investigations involving the Office of the Secretary of Transportation. Reactions Democrats in Congress strongly condemned the removals, with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi decrying a \\"dangerous pattern of retaliation against the patriotic public servants charged with conducting oversight on behalf of the American people\\". In a letter to the White House, House Foreign Affairs Committee chair Eliot L. Engel and Senate Foreign Relations Committee ranking member Robert Menendez wrote, \\"We unalterably oppose the politically-motivated firing of inspectors general and the President's gutting of these critical positions.\\" In May 2020, House Democrats introduced a bill, the Inspector General Independence Act, that would protect against political retaliation and would provide that the president could only remove inspectors general for just cause. Republicans were mostly silent, although Senator Mitt Romney said on Twitter, \\"The firings of multiple Inspectors General is unprecedented; doing so without good cause chills the independence essential to their purpose. It is a threat to accountable democracy and a fissure in the constitutional balance of power.\\" A few Republicans, including senators Chuck Grassley and Susan Collins, said the president needed to provide Congress with a more detailed justification than just \\"lost confidence\\". Some expressed a desire for more information. Others defended the actions by pointing out that \\"It is the President's prerogative and within his authority to make decisions regarding the adequacy of performance and continued employment of the inspector general\\" and that the president has the right to \\"surround himself with people that he has confidence in\\". Trump gave no specific official reason for the firings but defended them. When asked if the dismissals were part of a pattern by the administration to avoid accountability, Trump replied, \\"I think we've been treated very unfairly by inspector generals.\\" He incorrectly stated that: \\"I think every president has gotten rid of probably more than I have; in fact, in the 16 years before Trump took office, only one IG had been fired by a previous president, although the report noted that some IGs may have resigned under threat of removal. In a May 18 piece after the dismissal of Linick, the Boston Globe editorial board said that \\"Congress should use its purse strings and investigative power to curb the Trump administration's firing of federal watchdogs\\", adding \\"Trump is now purging the federal government of the independent inspectors general who hold the executive branch accountable for carrying out the duties of public service with integrity and for acting within the confines of the law.\\" A few days later, the Des Moines Register editorial board challenged Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa to lead an inquiry into the firings, writing that Trump's dismissals of watchdog IGs \\"positions his administration for even less accountability.\\" The Los Angeles Times editorial board said the president was signaling contempt for oversight of his domain, writing: \\"Trump's warped notion that the executive branch exists to loyally serve his interests makes it especially important that these watchdogs don't lose their bite.... Trump's disdain for the role of inspectors general is part of his larger insistence that all departments of government, including the Justice Department, show fealty to him above all\\". The South Florida Sun- Sentinel editorial board noted that \\"Before signing the $2.2 trillion pandemic relief package late last month, Trump prepared a document revealing, in effect, his contempt for the provision intended to guard against waste and theft ‚Äî an oversight panel comprising several of the executive branch's inspectors general.... What is vital is that these government watchdogs have the confidence of the public and the Congress.\\" The White House on May 26 addressed the dismissals by claiming that Trump was following the law, but gave no additional reasons on why Trump had dismissed them. Senator Chuck Grassley responded that he would not allow two Trump nominees to be considered by the Senate until the dismissals are adequately explained.

The series is notable for being one of the earliest nationwide programs to feature Jack Webb. Production Webb, who had previously starred on the Mutual detective drama, Johnny Madero, Pier 23, played the title character, a private investigator working for Anthony J. Lyon at the International Detective Bureau. In the first incarnation of the series, Lyon was played by Wilms Herbert, while Webb's future Dragnet co-star, Barton Yarborough, played his co-worker, Joe Canto. This format continued until the end of the year, when Webb left the program. According to writer William Froug, Webb was fired for asking for too much money. The program remained on hiatus for almost a year before being brought back with voice actor Frank Graham portraying Regan. Graham, who was well known both as an announcer and for his versatility, had previously created and starred in his own detective series, The Adventures of Cosmo Jones. Lyon was also recast, with The Jack Benny Program regular Frank Nelson taking over the part. This remained the definitive lineup for the rest of the show's run, although for unknown reasons Paul Dubov filled in for Graham for several weeks. Cancellation The second version of Regan remained popular in the ratings and was expected to be renewed for another season. However, Graham committed suicide on September 2, 1950. At the time of his death, five more broadcasts were scheduled for Regan, but they were never completed. Graham had completed an episode scheduled to air the night after he died, but newspaper accounts indicated that CBS chose not to broadcast it. The role of Regan was not recast, resulting in the series ending production permanently.

Biography Ng, born in 1930, was of Teochew origin. Ng earned his nickname of \\"Crippled Ho\\" or \\"Limpy Ho\\" following a leg injury sustained in a street fight. He sneaked to Hong Kong from Mainland China during the Great Chinese Famine in the 1960s. From as early as 1967, Ng was involved in the illicit trade of opium and morphine. He was married to Cheng Yuet-ying (), who was also involved in the drug trade. Ng built a drug empire that, at the time of his arrest, was said to have covered Hong Kong, Macau, Thailand, Taiwan, Singapore, Britain and America. Ng was arrested in 12 November 1974 on charges of smuggling 20 tonnes of opium and morphine from Thailand and other countries into Hong Kong. Nicknamed \\"Mr. Big\\" by the media, Ng was convicted in May 1975 to 30 years of imprisonment, the longest sentence ever imposed by a Hong Kong court at that time. His wife was subsequently arrested and was convicted on 23 February to 16 years imprisonment and was fined 1 million yuan. Ng became a key witness in the case against Ma Sik-chun, Ng's former associate who was facing charges of heroin and opium trafficking. Ng became a Buddhist while in jail. In April 1991, his sentenced was reduced by the Governor of Hong Kong by four and a half year, and was scheduled to be released at the end of the year. In July, Ng was diagnosed with terminal liver cancer, and it was estimated that he would live no more than 6 weeks. His sentence was then further reduced. On 14 August 1991, after serving 16 years in jail, Ng was released on medical grounds . He was moved to a guarded hospital cell to a ward at the Queen Mary Hospital. He died a few weeks later on September 8, 1991 at age 61. His wife was eventually released from prison in 1992.

This law is unique and novel in its aim, because it targets existing buildings and requires owners to invest in renovation and retrofitting to make their buildings more energy efficient. Other similar laws have been passed worldwide, but target only new construction projects. The New York Post has called the law \\"one of the most ambitious climate legislations for buildings enacted by any city in the world.\\" This law reflects the city's aim to reduce overall emissions by 80% by 2050. All buildings (residential and non-residential) account for 71% of New York City greenhouse gas emissions, and the large existing buildings impacted by this law alone account for about 30% of citywide emissions. The law also aligns with and begins to implement plans laid out by New York US representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in the Green New Deal legislation co-sponsored by Senator Markey. The law is estimated to cost businesses about $4 billion USD, but some of those costs will likely create future energy savings. Some of the retrofits buildings can consider implementing to abide by the new law could include investing in better insulated windows, dimmable lights, more efficient air conditioners and heating systems. This law effects 50,000 of New York City's 1 million buildings.

The book tells the story of how Slovakian Jew Lale Sokolov, who was imprisoned at Auschwitz in 1942, fell in love with a girl he was tattooing at the concentration camp. The story is based on the real lives of Sokolov and his wife, Gita Furman. There has been mixed criticism towards the book, with some complimenting the novel‚Äôs compelling story based on real-life events, while claims of factual inaccuracies that bring into question miseducation around historical events has been critiqued by the Auschwitz Memorial Research Center. As of October 2019, the novel has sold more than three million copies around the world. 61,391 copies of The Tattooist of Auschwitz were sold in 2018 in Ireland. In 2018 it was the #1 New York Times Bestseller and #1 International Bestseller.  Background  The book, which was Morris‚Äô debut novel, was originally written as a screenplay. Morris was proposed the idea of telling the story of Lale Sokolov by Lale‚Äôs daughter ‚Äì a mutual friend of Morris, after Lale‚Äôs wife Gita died. Morris met with Lale for three years until his death in 2006, to hear his story about his time with Gita in Auschwitz and take notes for her screenplay. During those meetings with Lale, he told Morris about the trauma, pain and survivor guilt he experienced. 6 years after first meeting with Lale, Morris‚Äô sister-in-law suggested writing the story as a book.  Plot  Told from the perspective of Lale Sokolov, the story follows his journey as a prisoner of Auschwitz concentration camp during WWII. After being forcibly transported on a long journey on a livestock train with other Jewish prisoners, Lale arrives at Auschwitz II-Birkenau work camp where within his first night witnesses two men killed by the SS. Lale adjusts to his new life as a Jewish prisoner, which involves witnessing gassings of fellow prisoners, and becoming ill with typhus. While ill, the current tattooist of the camp, Pepan, takes interest in Lale and allows him to become his apprentice. Lale endures the labour of tattooing new prisoners to enable further survival. Lale briefly meets a beautiful, young woman while tattooing her arm upon her entry to the camp and he experiences love at first sight. Eventually, Lale becomes the main tattooist after Pepan disappears, indicating his probable execution. Lale asks the SS officer in charge of him, Baretksi, with whom he has built a trusted relationship with, for an assistant. He is given a young prisoner named Leon. Lale often risks his own life to exchange jewels, money, medicine, and items of clothing with other prisoners who are suffering. Lale uses his relationship with Baretski to gain increased privileges within the camp, including the ability to communicate with the beautiful woman he met earlier, Gita. Gita works in one of the camp warehouses that houses the confiscated belongings of prisoners, and often sneaks valuable items to Lale. While Gita is ill with typhus, Lale brings her medicine and promises to one day start a family with her once she is well again. The SS officers begin acting nervous and impulsive upon news that the Russian army is advancing. Many camp documents are destroyed. Many prisoners are transferred out of Auschwitz, including Gita who in the rush tells Lale her surname is Furman. Lale is transferred to a new camp called Mauthausen in Austria and then soon to a better camp in Vienna. Meanwhile, Gita escapes with three Polish women before making her way to Bratislava, Slovakia. Lale escapes from his camp in Vienna through a hole in the fence and upon being found by Russian soldiers, is forced to work at a Russian-owned chalet due to his experience speaking multiple languages. He eventually escapes and makes his way to his hometown to find his sister alive, his parents still missing, and that his older brother had died. He then heads to Bratislava to find Gita, knowing that many Slovakian prisoners were being sent there. He waits two weeks at a train station and then spots her in a street. The pair kneel down and tell each other they love each other. Lale asks if Gita will marry him and she agrees.  Characters  Lale Sokolov = The narrator of the book is 25-year-old Slovakian Jew from Krompachy Lale Sokolov, who meets a young woman while serving as the T√§towierer in Auschwitz II-Birkenau from 1942 until 1945. He falls in love with the woman, Gita, during his years of imprisonment, and vows to marry and start a family with her once they are free. Lale consistently puts himself in danger to help his friends and himself survive while in Auschwitz. = Gita = Gita is a young Jewish woman from Slovakia who meets Lale in Auschwitz II-Birkenau. She meets Lale as he tattoos her identification number on her arm. She and Lale meet with each other regularly and eventually agree they will remain together once they are free from imprisonment. Gita falls ill with typhus and is hidden from guards by her friends to save her from being sent to the gas chambers. Gita's friends, Ivana and Dana, and Lale keeps Gita alive using various tactics. = Cilka = Cilka is Gita‚Äôs friend who she meets while working in the Birkenau administration building. Unlike most other prisoners, Cilka is not made to shave her head. She is also forced to be a mistress to Schwarzhuber, a top commandant, and is regularly raped. The only favour Cilka ever asks of Schwarzhuber is to transfer Lale out of Block 31 where he was being tortured. This dangerous act saves Lale‚Äôs life. = Pepan = Pepan is the main tattooist at Auschwitz before Lale takes over, and aids Lale in regaining his health after seeing Aron plead with an officer to take Lale off the cart of dying prisoners. He believes Lale to be an extraordinary person and worthy of saving. He takes in Lale as his assistant tattooist and teaches him how to deal with and bargain with the officers to survive. It is suggested that when Pepan disappears he is been taken to be murdered. = Jakub = Jakub is an American-Jew who while visiting family in Poland was captured and taken to Auschwitz II-Birkenau. He meets Lale while being tattooed on his forearm, and signals he is starving. Lale is able to sneak Jakub rations of food. Later on, when Lale is taken to be tortured, and finds that Jakub is his delegated torturer, Jakub is able to return the favour and save Lale‚Äôs life. = Baretski = Baretski is the Nazi SS Officer in charge of Lale. They relationship grows with increased trust throughout the novel, with Baretski even giving Lale advice on how to stay safe. They share tips between each other on their own relationships with women, and risk their own lives to help each other on multiple occasions. Despite this relationship, Lale still deems Baretski a risk due to his random acts of murder and torture to other prisoners. = Aron = Aron is Lale‚Äôs bunkmate, whom he met while being transported to Auschwitz II-Birkenau. Aron helped save Lale‚Äôs life by pulling him from the cart of dying prisoners while Lale sick with Typhus. Because of his selfless act in saving Lale‚Äôs life and lying to SS officers, he is taken away and never seen again. = Doctor Mengele = Josef Mengele is the Doctor at Auschwitz who conducts torturous experiments on its prisoners. Mengele also castrated Leon, and often chose who was sent to the gas chambers. = Victor = Victor is a paid labourer from Poland who gives Lale rations of food in exchange for valuables while visiting Auschwitz II-Birkenau to build crematoriums. = Leon = Leon works with Lale as the assistant tattooer and is at one point taken by Doctor Mengele to be castrated.  Genre and Style  The Tattooist of Auschwitz fits into the genre of Holocaust fiction. Morris writes using simple, short sentences from a third- person point of view where Lale is the omniscient narrator and protagonist of the story. According to Steve Walker, Morris \\"welds the historical events ‚Äì and real people ‚Äì on to a fictional frame.\\" The novel utilises many elements of the Romantic genre, specifically through the key plot line of Lale and Gita's love story. The Tattooist of Auschwitz also fits into the Biographical genre. The novel is based on events in the real Lale Sokolov's life and represents the circumstances Lale and other characters in the story lived through.  Reception  Timonthy Niedermann, writing in The New York Journal of Books, calls the novel ‚Äúat once sobering and poignant, both weighted with unspeakable horrors and uplifted by the unique hope of love‚Äù. He felt that while the book lacks physical descriptions, and Morris is ‚Äúvague about the specifics of the extermination process‚Äù, her depiction of humanity in the characters is a strength. Wanda Witek-Malicka from the Auschwitz Memorial Research Center, writing in Memoria, offered historical criticism, questioning the novel‚Äôs factual inaccuracies and stating that the entire image of reality at Auschwitz displayed in the book is built on ‚Äúexaggerations, misinterpretations and understatements‚Äù. She warns that those who read the Czech translation of the book may take its stories as fact, which the Memorial Center believe is \\"dangerous and disrespectful to history\\". A key concern for the Auschwitz Memorial Research Center was Morris' claim that Gita's identification number tattooed on her arm was 34902, stating \\"we do not find any surviving documents with her personal data or relating to number 34902 issued in the women's series\\" and that a prisoner arriving at Auschwtiz at the time Gita did could not have received such a high number. Witek-Malicka states that according to Gita's own testimony, her identification number was 4562. Witek-Malicka also rejects Morris' claim that Doctor Mendele conducted sterilisation tests on men in Auschwitz, and that Lale gave Gita penicillin for her Typhus, because \\"this antibiotic became widely accessible only after the war.\\" Hirsh, L√°n√≠ƒçek, Mitschke & Shields, writing in the Australian Journal of Jewish Studies, state that creative license is common, but that ‚ÄúHeather Morris‚Äô steadfast reliance on conversations she shared with Lale Sokolov‚Äôs towards the end of his life have contributed to a simplification that narrows understanding of the reality of Auschwitz‚Äù. They note the flattening of the experiences of the character, Gita Furman, as an example of this simplification.  Television Adaptation  The Creative Director of Synchronicity Films, Claire Mundell secured the rights to The Tattooist of Auschwitz after making a deal with Bonnier Books UK in 2018. The novel was set to be turned into a multi-part television series to be released in January 2020. There have been no reports of this deal going ahead since September, 2018.  Translations  By November 2018, the book had been translated into 17 languages. By September 2019, official translations of the book had been published in 47 languages. One of these translations is in Slovak, Lale's native language. Morris celebrated the launch of the Slovak version of the book in Krompachy in Eastern Slovakia, which is where Lale was born.

Reception  Gantumoote received positive reviews from critics. Karthik Hebbar of The Hindu called it \\"a precious gem\\", further appreciating it by remarking \\"the real beauty of the film though is in the narrative. The unabashed, unapologetic journey of a girl finding passion and exploring it without inhibition. The camera here gazes at the male body through the female gaze. It is her stare, her pursuit and her passion in play here. The cinema understands and disrobes the real world through this very unique feminine gaze...\\" Baradwaj Rangan of Film Companion called it \\"exquisitely directed and enacted\\" and praised the director, saying that \\"Rao manages something very difficult. She holds a series of moods throughout, and the places she chooses to linger on are unusual. She is more interested in character than event, and she practically holds up an X-ray of Meera‚Äôs soul. Her framing is unfussy, and yet, there‚Äôs quiet beauty in the images of, say, Meera and Madhu against the backdrop of a stone wall. These are little snatches of visual poetry, as is Teju Belawadi‚Äôs face.\\" Theres Sudeep of Deccan Herald said, Gantumoote is a must-watch. It is not every day that you see a film getting a standing ovation as the end credits roll. Gantumoote is such a film.\\" A Shraddhaa of New Indian Express said the film \\"does justice to the film‚Äôs tag line ‚Äîbaggage ‚Äî and comes with its own sets of emotions and nostalgia, which take the audience to the good old days.\\" and reviewed, \\"The subject of innocence and romance requires a certain dose of boldness to be portrayed on screen, especially in Sandalwood, since there are only a few movies that have crossed the limit to project the feelings in a natural manner. Given an A certificate by the censor board, Roopa Rao‚Äôs romantic tale, Gantumoote, does cross the conventional barriers, and kisses and cuddles become an innocent part of the story, never becoming vulgar.\\" Harish Mallya of The News Minute called it, \\"a rare gem in Kannada cinema [...] Though it looks like a school romance story at the onset, the treatment is very fresh and unique for Kannada cinema.\\" He further noted, \\"The challenge in making a film like this is that you do not have anything new that can be told. It should turn out to be a collection of experiences. Watching the film, it clearly shows how carefully the team has chosen the moments and has captured those in the most realistic manner, devoid of any glorification and glamour. The charm lies in the simplicity which is apparent all over the film.\\"  Festival Selections  *Young Film Market ‚Äì Mercato Europeo Del Cinema Giovane E Indipendente *Nitte International Film Festival 2020 *New York Indian Film Festival 2019 *Ottawa Indian Film Festival and Awards 2019 *Indian Film Festival of Melbourne 2019 *Tasveer South Asian Film Festival 2019 *International Women‚Äôs Film Festival 2019  Nominations and Awards  *Nomination: Best Film in Critics Choice awards 2020 (Mumbai) *Nomination: Best Film Critics awards 2020 (Karnataka) *Best Screenplay: NYIFF 2019 *Nomination: Best Film in OIIFA 2019 *Finalist: International Women Film Festival 2019  Accolades  Gantumoote created history by becoming the First ever Kannada film to win the Best Screenplay Award at the New York Indian Film Festival.

The show is executive-produced by Leah Whitta, and is livestreamed entirely from a talk-show set built in Animal Crossing: New Horizons. Animal Talking premiered on April 25, 2020. It features Adam Nickerson as the bandleader.  Background  Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, Gary Whitta began streaming himself playing Animal Crossing: New Horizons daily a month before Animal Talking began, in the form of Animal Crossing Mornings. The show helped the channel gain a growing audience and identity. During his playthrough, Whitta came up with an idea to create a talk show set that paid homage to his favorite shows of the genre, such as The Tonight Show, The Larry Sanders Show, and Between Two Ferns. A pilot episode was livestreamed in the set on April 25 with his friend and internet personality Naomi Kyle, which was well regarded by viewers. The show would later produce four more shows that week, before settling into a Monday, Wednesday, Friday schedule, with a permanent schedule at 7PM PT every Wednesday starting from episode 16.  Production  The show is filmed in Animal Crossing: New Horizons on Gary's island of Kawaii. The set was put together with in-game furniture created by or gifted to the Whittas by viewers of the show. The in- game camera is utilized to film the show, although its limitations require the host avatar to move for better angles. Guests appear on the show as Animal Crossing avatars, with the wardrobe supervised by fellow Twitch streamer Kate Stark. On the occasion that a guest does not play Animal Crossing, executive producer and Gary's wife, Leah Whitta would customize her own avatar to match the appearance of the guest and puppeteer them live as they speak. The production and guests speak together through Discord. Additional staff members include Adam Nickerson, who serves as band leader and edits full episodes into ten minute highlight videos that can be accessed on the show's YouTube channel. The logo was designed by Chandana Ekanayake with Leah Whitta. The theme song was composed by Kenny Fong, and also credits Tom Young, Cameron Rose, Chris Petty, Desmond Splitter, Christian Lucy, and K.K. Slider. Due to the show's viral success, the show has been approached by potential sponsors, cable television networks, and advertisers. However, Whitta has rejected these opportunities, citing disinterest and stating \\"As soon as it becomes cynical, monetized, or corporatized, I think the whimsy and authenticity of it will disappear.\\" =Format= The show functions similarly to its real-life counterparts. Each episode starts with an opening sequence featuring Whitta's avatar performing various activities around his island, while Snowbike Mike announces that episode's guests. The theme song plays in the background as Mike introduces Gary Whitta as the host, who greets the audience, converses with Nickerson, and delivers any news about the show. Following the introduction, main segments include celebrity interviews, live musical performances, and stand-up comedy. While interviews have dived into the life of the guests, much of the conversation revolves around gaming and Animal Crossing. At the end of the show, each guest is invited to step up to a mic to deliver a joke, and the best joke among the guests is determined through chat poll votes from the live audience. A segment Danny's Diary featuring Danny Trejo first aired its debut episode on 8 June. The first episode follows Trejo's avatar giving Nickerson a tour of his own island.  Episodes Season 1Season 2= Reception  The show has been well received by viewers. Animal Talking was featured on the Twitch homepage, with its fourth episode reaching over 12,000 viewers and was number 14 on the site's most watched streams that day. Episode 10 pulled in a total of 339,000 individual viewers, while Episode 11 reached 18,000 concurrent viewers, a record for the show. The Verge proclaimed Animal Talking as \\"2020's Hottest Late-Night Talk Show\\". Touching on the uniqueness of the concept, Megan Farokhmanesh highlighted the pros of the show taking place in the video game: \\"On any other talk show, it would be an agonizing minute and a half of mistakes. Here, it's what makes Animal Talking so special.\\" Screen Rants Christopher Teuton commented that \\"while most (...) traditional late-night talk show hosts are currently filming (...) and holding interviews over live chat services like Zoom, it's refreshing and unique to see the same format translated so perfectly here inside of Animal Crossing: New Horizons.\\" He praised Whitta's skill as an interviewer and host, with \\"his conversations with Hollywood celebrities, musical geniuses, and video game enthusiasts are almost always just as enjoyable as those of his professional late night show counterparts, if not more so.\\"  References  Further reading   *  External links  * Animal Talking on Twitch * Animal Talking on YouTube Category:2020s American late-night television series Category:2020 American television series debuts Category:2020s American variety television series Category:American web series Category:Animal Crossing Category:English- language television shows Category:2020 web series debuts ","title":"Animal Talking with Gary Whitta"},{"id":"63999500","text":"Petros Bagalianis (; born 6 February 2001) is a Greek professional footballer who plays as a centre-back for Aris.

In 1804 he took part in the fighting, and from 1805 was a member of the Governing State Council for the Belgrade Nahiya and a member of the Grand Provincial Court (Supreme Court) from 1811. I'mPopoviƒá and other members of the Governing State Council became recipients of the coveted Order of St. Anna, 2nd degree, from Russian Tsar Aleksandar I in 1811. The decoration also included a title of the Russian hereditary court and free schooling for children in Russian military cadet schools for all the recipients of the honour. Pavle Popoviƒá, together with his cousin Lazar Popoviƒá, moved a short distance to an Austrian-occupied territory of Srem in 1813, to ≈Ωeleznik, where he stayed until 1815, then he moved back to Belgrade and joined Prince Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá, who in the same year, after signing a truce with the Turks, appointed him one of the two rotating representatives at the Turkish headquarters at Vraƒçar. Popoviƒá family Most of the Popoviƒá families belonged to the Serbian clergy, even in the ancient past. In the old days, they hailed from Montenegro, and at the beginning of the 18th century moved to Gru≈æ. In Gru≈æ, they joined the political action of Austria preparing the Serbs for the uprising against the Turks. When the Turks discovered that a rebellion was in the offing, the Popoviƒái who were the organizers had to flee from possible revenge. They went to the priest Nikola Radmanoviƒá with some other families where they found refuge. In the middle of the 18th century, Todor and Milica Popoviƒá came to Vraniƒá with their four sons and nephew. Their sons Dimitrija and Atanasija were priests, and Jovan, who was called \\"Joka\\", was the head of the Popoviƒá cooperative. Pavle was \\"born\\" for public affairs, as Petar Jokiƒá told historian Milan Miliƒáeviƒá: \\"Soldier and advisor as it should be.\\" Life as revolutionary and politician After Koƒçina Krajina, Pavle was elected Knyaz in Vraniƒá. Until the First Serbian Uprising, he fought against the Turks, although he was friends with Aganlija. He escaped the Slaughter of the Knezes in 1804, thanks to that friendship, and on that occasion, he saved his friends Janko Katiƒá, Sima Markoviƒá, Milisav Camd≈æija, Nikola Nikolajeviƒá and others.name=\\"–ó–ª–∞—Ç–∫–æ–≤–∏—õ\\"> In 1805, at the Assembly in Veliki Borak, he was elected a member of the Synod, as a representative of the Belgrade Nahiya.

When he heard of the Second Serbian Uprising in 1815, he returned to Vraniƒá and continued the fight against the Turks. He was one of the mediators between the Turks and Prince Milo≈°. Due to the wound under his shoulder, which he could not heal in any way, he returned to Vraniƒá. Before his death, he saved his godfather Sima Markoviƒá, with the help of the then Vranje Knyaz Pavle Marinkoviƒá, from the wrath of Prince Milo≈°. Death On 8 December 1816, he died in Vraniƒá where he was buried in front of the church gate, and on his tomb, it is written: \\"An excellent Serb, a fighter for the liberation of the people and his fatherland during the uprising of Karaƒëorƒëe and Prince Milo≈° in 1804 and 1815, decorated member of the First People's Court, Pavle Popoviƒá.\\"  References  * Translated and adapted from Serbian Wikipedia:–ü–∞–≤–ª–µ –ü–æ–ø–æ–≤–∏—õ (—Å–æ–≤—ò–µ—Ç–Ω–∏–∫) Category:1750 births Category:1816 deaths Category:Serbs of the Ottoman Empire Category:Rebels of the Ottoman Empire Category:Heroes Category:Politicians from Belgrade Category:Serbian diplomats Category:People of the First Serbian Uprising Category:People of the Second Serbian Uprising ","title":"Pavle Popoviƒá (revolutionary)"},{"id":"63999638","text":"Madina Shoikina (; born 31 January 1986) is a Kazakhstani footballer who plays as a goalkeeper.

The bridge was initiated under the administration of Goodluck Jonathan and is being sustained by President Muhammadu Buhari. The bridge is being constructed across Nigeria's Niger River and it will span from Asaba to Ozubulu and Ogbaru areas. The project is being developed through a public private partnership (PPP) involving Julius Berger.  History  The Second Niger Bridge was first proposed during the 1978/79 political campaign by then candidate Shehu Shagari of the National Party of Nigeria(NPN). In 1987, after warning about the state of the existing River Niger Bridge by the then Minister for Works and Housing Abubakar Umar, General Ibrahim Babangida challenged the local engineers to design The Second Niger Bridge, rising to the challenge, The Nigerian Society of Engineers called NSE Prems Limited, which subsequently delivered a masterplan. The addition of east‚Äìwest railway line to the project, unfortunately the turmoil that precipitated the end of Babangida's administration stalled the plan. Under the subsequent military governments, the projects received little attention. Upon the return to civilian rule, President Olusegun Obasanjo promised to deliver a second Niger River bridge. However his administration did not carry out any major activity on the project until five days before he handed over to the then incoming administration of Umaru Musa Yar'Adua, when Obasanjo flagged off the project in Asaba. The incoming administration effectively inherited a ‚Ç¶58.6 billion proposed cost for a six lane, 1.8 km tolled bridge, which was to be completed in three-and- half years. The bridge was to be financed under a public private partnership (PPP) with 60 per cent of the funding coming from the contractor, Gitto Group; 20 per cent from the Federal Government of Nigeria, and 10 per cent from the Anambra and Delta State Governments. Unfortunately the subsequent death of President Yar'adua marred the progress of the project. However, in August 2012, the Federal Executive Council under Jonathan's administration, approved a contract worth ‚Ç¶325 million for the final planning and design of the bridge. During the 2011 Nigerian general election campaign period, Jonathan has promised that if elected, he would deliver the project before the end of his term in 2015. At an Onitsha town hall meeting on August 30, 2012, he promised to go into exile if he did not deliver on the project by 2015. The rigmarole continued under the President Muhammadu Buhari administration, who first cancelled the earlier contract in August 2015.

The law was passed in 1923, and enforced in 1925.Sundevall, Fia (2011). Det sista manliga yrkesmonopolet: genus och milit√§rt arbete i Sverige 1865-1989. Diss. Stockholm : Stockholms universitet, 2011 It was dropped in 1945, because it contained exceptions which started to be seen as a problem by that point. The exceptions consisted of the right to become priests of the state church (which was allowed in 1958) and to hold military office (which was allowed in a series of reforms in 1980‚Äì1989). Background The background to the law was the raising employment rate of women in the educated professions, both in public and private, which took place during the later half of the 19th-century, particularly after women gained access to university education in the 1870s. Because women were suddenly employed in professions where their presence had previously been unknown, such as those of civil servant (5,000 by 1870 and 15,000 by 1890), clerks, telegraph-, post- and bank officials, secretaries and assistants, numerous problems aroused. These professions had previously been de facto reserved for men, and women's employment in them often resulted in discrimination. The most common problem was the fact that Paragraph 28 of the constitution demanded that application forms for positions within government institutions were phrased with the word \\"Swedish man\\", which made it impossible for women to apply for them. This was illustrated by the fact that women physicians could not be employed in public state hospitals, only in private hospitals; nor could women teachers be employed above the level of subject teacher in a public state school, because such position, if in state institutions, were defined as government service, and all supplicants to government service professions were by Paragraph 28 defined as a \\"Swedish man\\". Campaign While the Swedish Parliament did address these issues, they did so by removing the qualification restriction of Paragraph 28 from one profession at a time, which was a very slow method. The problem was illustrated by the teaching profession. When the state introduced a regulated elementary school system in 1842, women teachers were employed by dispensation until the profession of public elementary school teacher was open to them in 1853, and fifty years later, they were still not allowed to teach above the level of subject teacher in state schools.Inger Hultgren (Swedish): Kvinnors organisation och samh√§llets beslutsprocess (1982) The profession of teacher was the most common profession for an educated woman, and in 1903, it was the women teachers under the leadership of Anna Ahlstr√∂m who petitioned the government with a demand for equal employment opportunities for male and female teachers. When the petition proved unsuccessful, Anna Ahlstr√∂m formed the Akademiskt Bildade Kvinnors F√∂rening or ABKF ('Society of Women Academics') to address the issue. Frustrated by the traditional method of removing the gendered qualification from one office at a time, they demanded the general removal of Paragraph 28 from all government service professions, which would automatically open all professions for women in any state institution and any profession defined by law as government service once and for all. In 1909, the ABKF succeeded in their campaign and the gendered qualification of Paragraph 28 was finally removed from all application forms to state professions and government service. The removal of Paragraph 28 formally allowed women access to all professions simply because it no longer banned them from it, but because the reform did not explicitly say so, there were still room for de facto discrimination of women from higher offices. The ABKF could therefore not consider the removal of Paragraph 28 as a full success of their goal. Committee of 1919 In 1919, a committee was formed by the Justice Department to address the issue. At this point in time, there was an urgent need from the point of view of the government to reform the status of women. Women suffrage was passed in 1919, which necessitated numerous reforms before they could use this right in the coming Election of 1921. Among other things, married women would have to be freed from their husbands' guardianship before they would be able to vote. The 1919 committee was therefore to perform a major reform in women's rights and status. The 1919 committee was headed by Emilia Broom√©, which was the first time a government committee was headed by a woman, and included Mathilda Sta√´l von Holstein among its members. Beh√∂righetslagen The work of the committee resulted in a new marriage law and legal majority of married women as well as the Beh√∂righetslagen. The Beh√∂righetslagen was passed in 1923 and enforced in 1925. The law explicitly gave women access to all professions and positions in society, with two exceptions: women would still not be allowed to become priests in the state church, nor would they be allowed to hold military office (this included the police force, as the main objective was to exclude women from professions in which they could legally use the monopoly on violence). The reform had visible effect: between 1910 and 1930, the number of women civil servants grew from 30,000 to 60,000 in the public sector, and from 10,000 to 40,000 in the private sector. Beh√∂righetslagen was in effect until 1945. At that point, however, the exceptions within it caused it to be viewed as a problem. Women were allowed in the Police force on equal terms with men between 1944 and 1954, women were allowed to become priests in the state church in 1958, and all the military offices were opened to women in a series of reforms between 1980 and 1989.

Early life, World War I, and Russian Civil War Trubnikov was born in a small village in Oryol Governorate, Russian Empire (now Volovsky District, Lipetsk Oblast, Russia). Conscripted for military service, he joined the Semyonovsky Regiment in November 1909 and soon rose up the non-commissioned ranks during World War I. In December 1914 he was promoted to master sergeant for distinction in battle. In 1915 he graduated as a warrant officer after completing studies in Omsk. He served on the Southwestern Front and participated in the Brusilov Offensive. In January 1918 he was seconded to the headquarters of the prestigious 1st Guards Corps. He received all four classes of the Cross of St. George (earning the title \\"Full Cavalier of Saint George\\") as well as the Order of Saint Anna, 4th class. In early 1918 Trubnikov was demobilized having reached the rank of lieutenant. ; on Russian MoD Military Biographical Dictionary Volunteering for the Red Army at the outset of the Russian Civil War, Trubnikov was first appointed as a military officer for his hometown. In May 1919 he was sent to the front, commanding a platoon, a company, and then a battalion in the 28th Rifle Regiment of the 7th Rifle Division. He fought on the Eastern Front against the White Army troops of Alexander Kolchak in the Votkinsk and Izhevsk districts, but in the summer the regiment was urgently transferred to the Southern Front, where Anton Denikin was advancing on Moscow. In August he became deputy commander and then commander of the 55th Rifle Regiment, also of the 7th Division, and fought in battles around Oboyan and Sudzha. From October to November he was involved in the Orel‚ÄìKursk operation, a decisive Soviet victory in which the Red Army regained the initiative. During the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War he commanded a regiment and then the 20th and 19th brigades of the 7th Division. In the autumn of 1920 he fought against Stanis≈Çaw Bu≈Çak-Ba≈Çachowicz near Ovruch and then against the anarchist army of Nestor Makhno near Zolotonosha.  Interwar period  After the civil war he continued to serve in the 7th Rifle Division as commander of the 19th Rifle Regiment, stationed in the Kiev Military District. In 1925 he completed the Vystrel course as part of his officer training and in 1927 he graduated from the Frunze Military Academy. In November 1928 he was appointed assistant commander of the 15th Rifle Division. In August 1932 he became the inspector of the 5th Aviation Brigade and in September 1933 he became the head of the sector for the Soviet Air Forces. In February 1934 he became the assistant commander of the 25th Chapayev Rifle Division, named after its first commander, Vasily Chapayev. In 1935 he became the division commander. During this time Trubnikov was under investigation by the NKVD, the Soviet secret police. This investigation was during a widespread purge of the Red Army, part of the Great Purge, where officers of the former Imperial army especially came under suspicion. He was arrested in June 1938 but released in February 1940.Forczyk, p. 13 After his release he served as an instructor at the Vystrel course.

In August 1941 the division was assigned to the 50th Army, part of the newly-forming Bryansk Front. The unit saw action in the Roslavl‚ÄìNovozybkov Offensive and the Battle of Bryansk from September to October. During the Battle of Moscow the army was encircled by the attacking 17th Panzer Division and 167th Infantry Division, but the 258th Division was able to escape and prevent the complete destruction of the army.Ziemke, p. 309 The division then helped stop Guderian's Second Panzer Army at Tula, on the southern flank of the German assault on Moscow. After the successful defensive operation the original strength of the 258th Infantry Division was less than 10 percent.Harrison, p. 103 In November Trubnikov was assigned command of the 217th Rifle Division, also part of 50th Army. In January 1942 Trubnikov led the division in the Soviet counteroffensive in the Moscow area, helping to liberate Kaluga and participating in the bloody Battles of Rzhev, known as the \\"Rzhev Meat Grinder\\" (\\"–†–∂–µ–≤—Å–∫–∞—è –º—è—Å–æ—Ä—É–±–∫–∞\\").Glantz, pp. 12-18 In June 1942 he became deputy commander of the 16th Army under Konstantin Rokossovsky. In July Rokossovsky was promoted to command the Bryansk Front, as it was expected the Wehrmacht would once more attack Moscow. When it became clear that the German focus was on the Southern Front, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin transferred Rokossovsky to the Don Front in preparation for a planned Soviet counterattack at Stalingrad. In October, at Rokossovsky's request, Trubnikov became deputy commander of the Don Front. He participated in the organization and management of troops in the Battle of Stalingrad and the destruction of the encircled German 6th Army. Trubnikov led the armies on the Don Front's right wing, including the 57th, 67th and 64th armies. In February 1943 Trubnikov again served as deputy commander to Rokossovsky on the Central Front in preparation for a summer offensive aimed at a German salient around the city of Kursk. In April Trubnikov received command of the 10th Guards Army of the Western Front. He led the army during Operation Suvorov, an attempt to liberate Smolensk that summer. In early August Trubnikov's army tried several times to break through the German XII Army Corps, but reinforcements from the 9th Army prevented any advance.Forczyk, p. 38 During the first phrase of the operation the 10th Guards suffered 30 percent casualties and its most elite unit, the 65th Guards Rifle Division, was almost annihilated, having lost 75 percent of its personnel in just seven days.Forczyk, p. 55 On September 10 Trubnikov was relieved of command and replaced with Alexander Sukhomlin. He would hold no more major commands for the rest of the war.Forczyk, p. 13 In December 1943 he was appointed assistant commander of the 1st Belorussian Front under his old comrade Rokossovsky, following him to the 2nd Belorussian Front in 1944 during the Soviet advance through Belorussia (Belarus) and into Poland. In this position he participated in the East Prussian Offensive, the East Pomeranian Offensive, and the Battle of Berlin. At the Moscow Victory Parade of 1945 Trubnikov led the consolidated regiment of the 2nd Belorussian Front. After the war, he continued as deputy commander of the troops of the 2nd Belorussian Front until August 1945, when he became deputy commander-in-chief of the Northern Group of Forces stationed in Poland. In January 1951 he was retired due to illness. He died on January 16, 1974 and is buried in the Vvedenskoye Cemetery in Moscow.

She left Manzanar in late 1943 for Madison, Wisconsin and one year later moved to Chicago, Illinois. Returning to California in 1948, she went on to become a schoolteacher and a labor and community activist. In 1969, Embrey was one of approximately 150 people who attended the first organized Manzanar Pilgrimage (see Manzanar Pilgrimage section, below) and was one of the founders of the annual event. She also went on to become the primary force behind the preservation of the site and its gaining National Historic Site status until her death in May 2006. * Henry Fukuhara, who was born in Fruitland, California, in 1913, was incarcerated with his family in April 1942. An artist and watercolorist, Fukuhara would later teach a series of annual artistic workshops at Manzanar beginning in 1998. His workshops, which usually had about 80 students a year, including Milford Zornes, used outdoor structures at Manzanar to teach water color painting. * Aiko Herzig-Yoshinaga, born in 1925 in Los Angeles, was 17 years old when she was incarcerated at Manzanar. Later, she was incarcerated at Jerome and Rohwer, Arkansas. Yoshinaga-Herzig later moved to New York, where she became a community activist in the 1960s and was a member of Asian Americans for Action (AAA), the first Asian American political organization on the East Coast. It included Asian American activists Bill and Yuri Kochiyama. Although she was not trained to be an archival researcher, Yoshinaga-Herzig decided to find out what historical documents about her and her family might exist at the National Archives. :Herzig- Yoshinaga and her husband, John \\"Jack\\" Herzig, pored over mountains of documents from the War Relocation Authority, a task that \\"was roughly equivalent to indexing all the information in a library, working from a card catalog that only gave a subject description by shelf, without giving individual book titles or authors.\\" Their efforts resulted in the discovery of evidence that the US Government perjured itself before the United States Supreme Court in the 1944 cases Korematsu v. United States, Hirabayashi v. United States, and Yasui v. United States which challenged the constitutionality of the relocation and incarceration. The government had presented falsified evidence to the Court, destroyed evidence, and had withheld other vital information. This evidence provided the legal basis Japanese Americans needed to seek redress and reparations for their wartime imprisonment. The Herzigs' research was also valuable in their work with the National Coalition for Japanese American Redress (NCJAR), which filed a class- action lawsuit against the US Government on behalf of the incarcerated people. The US Supreme Court ruled against the plaintiff. * William Hohri (1927‚Äì2010), was incarcerated at Manzanar when he was 15 years old. His family entered Manzanar on April 3, 1942, and remained behind the barbed wire until August 25, 1945. Hohri became a civil rights and anti-war activist after World War II. In the late 1970s he became the chair of the National Coalition for Japanese American Redress (NCJAR), which brought a class action lawsuit against the US Government on March 16, 1983, asserting that it had unjustly incarcerated Japanese Americans during World War II. The lawsuit stated 22 causes of action, including fifteen alleged violations of constitutional rights, and sought $27 billion in damages. Despite the fact the US Supreme Court eventually ruled against the class action plaintiffs, the lawsuit helped bring the Japanese American case for redress and reparations to public awareness. It showed the Congress and the Executive Branch that the US Government would have far greater exposure in the still-pending lawsuit than by legislation under consideration in Congress for reparations. The proposed bill called for $20,000 reparations payments to each former inmate or their immediate relatives, along with money for a civil liberties education fund (see Civil Liberties Act of 1988). * Jeanne Wakatsuki Houston (b. 1934), writer * Joseph Kurihara (1895‚Äì1965), a renunciant, also interned at Tule Lake Ralph Lazo in a group photo at Manzanar * Ralph Lazo, born in 1924 in Los Angeles, was of Mexican American and Irish American descent, but when at age 16 he learned that his Japanese American friends and neighbors were being forcibly removed and incarcerated at Manzanar, he was outraged. Lazo was so incensed that he joined friends on a train that took hundreds to Manzanar in May 1942. Manzanar officials never asked him about his ancestry. \\"Internment was immoral,\\" Lazo told the Los Angeles Times. \\"It was wrong, and I couldn't accept it.\\" \\"These people hadn't done anything that I hadn't done except to go to Japanese language school.\\" In 1944, Lazo was elected president of his class at Manzanar High School. He remained at Manzanar until August of that year, when he was inducted into the US Army. He served as a Staff Sergeant in the South Pacific until 1946, helping liberate the Philippines. Lazo was awarded the Bronze Star for heroism in combat. After the war, he was a strong supporter of redress and reparations for Japanese Americans incarcerated during the war. The film Stand Up for Justice: The Ralph Lazo Story documents his life story, particularly his stand against the incarceration. Photographer Toyo Miyatake * Toyo Miyatake, who was born in Kagawa, Shikoku, Japan, in 1896, immigrated to the United States in 1909. He settled in the Little Tokyo section of Los Angeles, and was incarcerated at Manzanar along with his family. A photographer, Miyatake smuggled a lens and film holder into Manzanar and later had a craftsman construct a wooden box with a door that hid the lens. He took many now-famous photos of life and the conditions at Manzanar. His contraband camera was eventually discovered by the camp administration and confiscated. However, camp director Ralph Merritt later allowed Miyatake to photograph freely within the camp, even though he was not allowed to actually press the shutter button, requiring a guard or camp official to perform this simple task. Merritt finally saw no point to this technicality, and allowed Miyatake to take photos. * Mary Nomura (b. 1925), singer * Paul Takagi (1923-2015) Criminologist, civil rights activist. * Togo Tanaka (1916‚Äì2009), editor of the Rafu Shimpo newspaper, was sent to the Manzanar, where he used his journalism experience to document conditions in the camp. A supporter of cooperation with the authorities, he was labeled a collaborator and was transferred to Death Valley after being the target of riots before the first anniversary of Pearl Harbor. * Kazue Togasaki (1897‚Äì1992), one of the first two women of Japanese ancestry to earn a medical degree in the United States. Also interned at Topaz and Tule Lake. * Harry Ueno, born in Hawaii in 1907, was a Kibei (native-born Japanese American educated in Japan) who was incarcerated at Manzanar with his wife and children. After volunteering for mess hall work, Ueno discovered that Manzanar camp staff were stealing rationed sugar and meat and selling them on the black market. This led to his arrest, which resulted in Ueno becoming the focal point of the Manzanar Riot. Ueno was one of the inmates featured in Emiko Omori's Emmy Award-winning film Rabbit in the Moon. Karl Yoneda at Manzanar in 1942 * Karl Yoneda was born in Glendale, California, on July 15, 1906, but his family moved back to Japan in 1913. He became an activist early in his life. With Japan on a path towards war, Yoneda returned to the United States rather than be drafted into the Japanese Army. He arrived in San Francisco on December 14, 1926. He was taken to the Immigration Detention House on Angel Island, where he was detained for two months, despite having his California birth certificate. Yoneda later moved to Los Angeles, where he found work organizing with the Trade Union Educational League, and later the Japanese Workers' Association. Yoneda arrived at Manzanar on March 22, 1942, one of the first Japanese Americans to arrive as a volunteer to build the camp. Yoneda later distinguished himself in service to the US, volunteering to serve in the Military Intelligence Service. After the war, Yoneda continued to support progressive causes and civil and human rights issues.

The majority of genes do not code for particular phenotypes. Instead, phenotypes often result from the interaction between several genes. In humans, ‚ÄúEach individual carries ‚àº4million genetic variants and polymorphisms, the overwhelming majority of which cannot be pinpointed as the single cause for a given phenotype. Instead, the effects of genetic variants may combine with one another both additively and synergistically, and each variant‚Äôs contribution to a quantitative trait or disease risk could depend on the genotypes of dozens of other variants. Interactions between genetic variants, along with the environmental conditions, are likely to play a major role in determining the phenotype that arises from a given genotype.‚Äù Genetic interaction networks help to understand genetic interactions by identifying such interactions between pairs of genes. Because genetic interactions provide insight into how genotype connects to phenotype in an organism, improved knowledge of genetic interactions in humans could provide crucial insight into complex diseases. Unfortunately, due to the impossibility of isolating subjects with single genetic variants, it is not possible to directly map the genetic interaction networks in humans. Researchers hope that learning about the characteristics of genetic interaction networks in suitable organisms will provide tools for constructing the genetic interaction network of humans.  Overview  A genetic interaction occurs when the interactions between two or more genes results in a phenotype that differs from the phenotype expected if the genes were independent of each other. In the context of genetic interaction networks, a genetic interaction is defined as ‚Äúthe difference between an experimentally measured double-mutant phenotype and an expected double-mutant phenotype, the latter of which is predicted from the combination of the single-mutant effects, assuming the mutations act independently.‚Äù In this context, a commonly studied phenotype is fitness which measures the relative reproduction rate of a mutant. A strong phenotype refers to a low level of fitness while a weak phenotype refers to a level of fitness close to that of the non-mutant strain. A negative genetic interaction occurs when the phenotype of the double mutant is stronger than expected. A special case is a synthetic lethal interaction which occurs when the removal of individual genes does not significantly harm an organism but the removal of both genes results in an inviable organism. A positive genetic interaction occurs when the phenotype of the double mutant is weaker than expected. A special case is genetic suppression which occurs when the phenotype of the double mutant is weaker than that of the least-fit single mutant. In order to measure the interaction between two genes, one must have some standard for the expected phenotype if the genes do not interact. Some common models for how the phenotypes of independent genes combine include the min, additive, and multiplicative models. In the min model, the expected fitness resulting from the mutation of two independent genes is the same as the fitness of the least-fit single mutant. In the additive model, the expected phenotype resulting from the mutation of two independent genes is the sum of the phenotypes due to the individual mutations. In the multiplicative model, the expected phenotype resulting from the mutation of two independent genes is the product of the phenotypes due to the individual mutations. Which model is best depends on the situation. It turns out in the case that fitness is used as the phenotype, the multiplicative model is best option. Methods exist to measure genetic interactions even when one of the genes is essential to an organism.  Properties of genetic interaction networks  Genetic interaction networks have been studied extensively in several organisms including Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Escherichia coli, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Drosophila melanogaster. These studies have given insight into properties of genetic interaction networks, including the topology of genetic interaction networks, how genetic interaction networks provide information about gene function, and what characteristics of genetic interaction networks are conserved by evolution. Researchers hope that an understanding of the general properties of genetic interaction networks as well as how they relate to other biological information such as protein-protein interaction networks will make it possible to infer the genetic interaction networks in organisms such as humans for which it is not possible to determine genetic interaction networks directly. The hubs of genetic interaction networks tend to be essential proteins. When two genes interact with a similar set of neighbors, this, along with the particular nature of those interactions, provides information about how the functions of the two genes are related. For example, genes that share a common set of synthetic lethal interactions tend to be involved in the same biological pathway. The set of genes with which a gene interacts and the type of those interactions (i.e. synthetic lethal) make up that gene‚Äôs interaction profile. This information allows the creation of a genetic profile similarity network from a genetic interaction network. In a genetic profile similarity network, edges connect genes with similar interaction profiles. The result is a network consisting of clusters of genes that tend to be involved in the same biological process and where the connections between these clusters provide information about the interdependencies of these biological processes. This can provide a powerful tool for predicting the function of uncharacterized genes. Some studies have looked into how genetic networks are conserved across evolutionary distance. While it is not clear the degree to which individual gene-gene interactions are conserved, the general properties of genetic interaction networks appear to be conserved such as the network hubs and the ability of genetic interaction profiles to predict biological function.  Biological implications  Genetic interactions have important implications for the connection between genotype and phenotype. For example, they have been proposed as an explanation for missing heritability. Missing heritability refers to the fact that the genetic sources of many heritable phenotypes are yet to be discovered. While a variety of explanations have been proposed, genetic interactions could majorly decrease the amount of missing heritability by increasing the explanatory power of known genetic sources. Such genetic interactions would most likely go beyond the pairwise interactions considered in genetic interaction networks.

Premise The story of several boxers who are fighting on the one night. They include Docker Starkie, a boxer making a comeback. Background Peterson wrote an Australian radio play about boxing, Come Out Fighting which aired in 1950. Peterson moved to London in 1951 and wrote a stage version, The Square Ring, over three months. He wrote the play over a three-month period. He sent the play to Anthony Quayle, who he had met in Sydney when Quayle had toured Australia with the Stratford Players (Quayle had appeared in a radio play written by Peterson about aboriginal issues, \\"The Problem of Johnny Flourcake\\"). Quayle was going to put it on himself but then accepted another theatrical tour of Australia so he passed it to the Tennents, who agreed to produce it. After several weeks of rehearsal, the play premiered in Brighton in September 1952 with a mostly male cast but one female, the wife of the central character. Peterson said \\"the play never seemed to jell. It got wacky and the girl seemed to be distracting attention from the main story.\\" So he made it an all male story. He also changed it by \\"I've done away with the normal compression of time. The running time of the play is exactly the period it would take a boxer to arrive in his dressing-room, to wait for his bout, and to complete his fight. It goes on without a break.\\" Peterson said \\"The play's only philosophy is: What makes men fight? The answer is simply-money.\\" The play debuted in London in October 1952 and was acclaimed. The play was turned into a 1953 British film. The play was produced in Melbourne in 1953 with a cast including Frank Thring. The play received some criticism because of its language. Joe Louis expressed interest in appearing in a production. 1954 Novel Peterson adapted the play into a novel which was published in 1954. 1959 TV Adaptation The play was adapted for British TV in 1959 with Sean Connery. =Cast= *George Baker as Docker Starkie *Sean Connery as Rick Martell *Alan Bates as Eddie Burke *Alfred Burke as Frank Ford *David Davies as Danny Felton *Arthur Gomez as Manager *Thomas Heathcote as Sailor Johnston *Percy Herbert as Rowdie Rawlings *Harry Landis as Happy Coombes *Neil McCarthy as Watty *David Waller as Doctor *Vic Wise as Joe 1960 Australian TV adaptation See 1960 Australian TV adaptation 1965 Radio Adaptation The play was adapted for radio in 1965. =Cast= *Dan Crosby *Max Osbiston *John Gray *Edward Hepple *John Armstrong *Robert MacDara *Alastair Duncan *Richard Meikle *Ben Gabriel *James Congdon.

The song was originally developed in Boston where Baker was living in 1979 with vocalist Michelle Wallace. Baker would later move to New York where he met with DJ Tee Scott initially to make an instrumental version of the song. Scott would take the song and would remix it would guitar and overdubs. The song was released by Emergency Records in 1981 and ended up peaking at 9th place on Billboard's Disco Top 80. Background and production Baker said that \\"Happy Days\\" was made in 1979 in Boston. Arthur Baker had previously met several musicians through his work on the album he worked on titled TJM which he was uncredited on. Through that project, he met several musicians that he would work on later tracks with. Baker spoke very positively about Presto, calling him \\"a really great DJ and a great drummer. But a very anal guy [...] But because of that, his sense of rhythm and timing was amazing. He could play to a click track, even back then, which was really uncommon, he‚Äôd practiced to a click track. So, we went in. The two of us went in and we were going to do a percussion album. This was before breakbeat albums, before any of that stuff. We decided that for DJs we would do percussion tracks, that people could play to extend records.\\" The song was done with all live musicians, and tried to get them to play like Gamble and Huff's music and told the musicians he played with to listen to Earl Young and to play as well as he did. Among the uncredited musicians on the track were drummer Russell Presto, keyboard player Andre Booth, and guitarist Charlie Street. Baker recalled that it took five hours to get the drums right for \\"Happy Days\\". Michelle Wallace was the vocalist on the track who was found in Boston to perform the vocals. Wallace was part of the Boston- based group the Wallace Sisters. The synthesizer used a handclap from a Minimoog. Baker's wife, a lawyer, got work in New York which led to her Baker moving there after Baker had completed \\"Happy Days\\". In New York, Baker met Tee Scott and had him mix \\"Happy Days\\" at Right Track Recordings in Manhattan. Scott was initially contacted to make an instrumental remix for the ‚ÄúHappy Days‚Äù. Baker later admitted that ‚ÄúTee had a big hand in the overdubs [...] Before, the most that people would add was percussion. But this was the first remix I know of‚Äîcertainly the first one I was involved with‚Äîthat actually used guitar and keyboard overdubs, and that was mostly Tee‚Äôs idea. I named the instrumental version ‚ÄòTee‚Äôs Happy,‚Äô instead of just ‚Äòinstrumental‚Äô or something‚Äîmainly because I thought that it would make Tee happy. And I was right!‚Äù Music \\"Happy Days\\" has been described as a disco song. Baker recalled of developing the song based on attending clubs and listening to \\"what producers are making and what the people at the club are liking\\", noting he was mildly inspired by the music DJ Larry Levan was playing stating the song had a \\"George Benson-meets-Chic vibe\\". Bruce Tantum stated the lyrics of the song \\"reflect on the simple joys of life with lyrics like ‚ÄúClap our hands and stomp our feet / Let‚Äôs all go out and play.\\" The song features syncopated guitar chords, keys, xylophone, and a \\"funk-fueled rhythm\\" \\"Tee's Happy\\" predominantly dispenses with the vocals. Release \\"Happy Days\\" was released by Emergency Records in 1981. The song peaked at 9th place on Billboard's Disco Top 80 chart. Reception The song was played by many of the top DJs in New York of the period, including John ‚ÄúJellybean‚Äù Benitez at the Funhouse and Larry Levan would play the b-side of \\"Happy Days\\" titled \\"Tee's Happy\\" at the Paradise Garage in New York often. Baker declared that the single sold 40,000 12‚Äùs in New York. Baker looks back positively on the song, stating \\"We thought we got the sound right. It was really crisp; all the elements were there.

The sport was introduced to North America in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and is played in some rural areas of the Midwest and Prairie regions of the United States and Canada.https://www.rollebolle.org/ One of the defining characteristics of Rolle Bolle is the wheel-like shape of the ball, or bolle. Bolles are manufactured in a way so that they do not roll straight but in a curved, elliptical path. History The exact origins of Rolle Bolle are unknown, but it is known that it was developed in Flanders, a Dutch speaking region of Belgium, before the 20th century. The Dutch name for Rolle Bolle, krulbollen, literally translates to \\"curve ball\\" due to the elliptical path taken by the bolle. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Belgian and Dutch immigrants to the United States and Canada introduced Rolle Bolle (krulbollen) and other similar Belgian sports such as feather bowling (trabollen). Rules and play A stake and three bolles (two red, one black) Rolle Bolle is played on a flat court typically made of natural soil, crushed limestone, or pavement. Two stakes (or \\"pegs\\") are placed a distance apart on either ends of the court, typically . Courts are typically wide.https://www.rollebolle.org/the-rules/ Stakes can be between in diameter and are made of wood (such as a baseball bat pounded into the ground), but other materials are also used. The balls, or bolles, are typically in diameter and thick. Traditional bolles are made of wood, however other materials can be used such as hardened rubber or molded plastic. Bolles are machined with a taper, which causes them to roll in an elliptical fashion. Rolle Bolle is played by two teams of 3-4 players each. Games are broken up by rounds; each round is an opportunity for a single team to score points. In a round, players from opposing teams take turns rolling their bolle towards the stake at the far end of the court. At the end of each round, when all players have rolled their bolles, points are awarded to the team with the closest bolle(s) to the stake. The next round then begins in the same manner, aiming for the other stake. The first team to score a set number of points (typically 8) is the winner. =Scoring= The red team has the bolle closest to the stake, but the second-closest bolle belongs to the blue team. Red scores one point. Blue scores nothing.The red team has two bolles closer to the stake than the blue team's closest bolle. Red scores two points. Blue scores nothing. A round is complete when both teams have played all of their bolles. If the round finishes then the team with the closest bolle wins the round and scores one point for each of its bolles that is closer to the jack than other team's closest bolle. The first team to a predetermined number of points is the winner of the game. =Strategy= When rolling a bolle, there are two main strategies a player can choose between: bowling, and shooting. When bowling, the player (bowler) aims the bolle along an elliptical course to get as close to the stake as possible. The bowler releases the bolle underhand, with not much speed. This strategy is used for good placement for scoring. The alternative option is to shoot. When shooting, the player (shooter) aims the bolle in a straight line, directly at an opponent's bolle nearby the stake. The bolle is released underhand, but with great speed. The goal is to knock the opponents' bolle(s) away from the stake.https://www.vlas.be/vlaspdf/infofolders/krulbol.pdf Geographical Distribution Annawan, IL, with sign declaring the Rolle Bolle World Tournament. In Europe, Rolle Bolle is played in the Flanders regions of the Netherlands and Belgium, where it originated. It is more common in rural areas, especially near Ghent, in the Meetjesland region and the region from Knesselare to Bruges. In North America, Rolle Bolle is played in rural areas ranging from Iowa to Winnipeg, in towns settled by Belgian emigrants. States and provinces where Rolle Bolle is played include: Illinois, Iowa, Manitoba, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. See also *Feather Bowling, which uses a similar bolle but the court is a trough.

It starred Joe Jenkins, a dancer who was living in Australia. He played a triple role. Joe Jenkins was a rare black actor who played lead roles in Australia at the time; he had also appeared in The Square Ring, Cafe Continental, The BP Super Show, The Two Headed Eagle and The End Begins on Australian TV. Plot Joe Jenkins SMH 13 Jun 1960 Jones runs an \\"empire\\" on an island in the West Indies. The action begins when Smithers, a trader, arrives on the island to discover Jones' subjects have revolted and Jones has to escape. Jones is terrified of the pursuing natives. He has nightmares where he meets Jeff, the man he killed in a razor fight, and another man he killed with a shovel. The nightmare then becomes a medium of regression. Jones goes beyond his own past until he finds himself on the first slave ship from Africa. Cast *Joe Jenkins as the Emperor Jones/the witchdoctor/porter *Moray Powell as Smithers *Nellie Small *Albert le Guerre Production Ad from 6 July 1960 The Age The production was filmed in Sydney at the ABC's studios at Gore Hill. It was directed by Alan Burke, who also adapted Eugene O'Neil's play. Except for the opening scene between Jones and Smithers, and some scenes at the end involving some natives, the action was carried by Jones alone. Jenkins said, \\"This is a role that really gets you and you live every moment of the terror of the man and the jungle. Some of those jungle films were filmed on the coldest nights we experienced but I wasn't cold, the intensity of the acting calls for such concentration.\\" Joe Jekins doubles in a number of scenes. He plays a witch doctor opposite himself which Burke achieved by filming the roles separately and later joining the film. The play was also adapted for Australian radio on the ABC in 1960. Reception The TV critic for the Sydney Morning Herald thought \\"loyalty to stage play conventions, in a medium where they do not belong, restrained the director from seeking the filmic fluency asked for in the quick succession of sketched scenes\\" in which Jenkins gave a \\"fine performance.\\" References Category:1960s Australian television plays Category:Australian films Category:Australian television films Category:1960 television plays ","title":"The Emperor Jones (1960 TV play)"},{"id":"64000623","text":"WOA ‚Äì Way Of Arts is a private art museum in Alcabideche, a parish located in the Portuguese municipality of Cascais, near Lisbon.

After serving in local Laramie County politics Hanna briefly served as mayor before being convicted for bribery charges alongside three members of the police department. Early life Ira Lewis Hanna was born on November 4, 1908, in Appleby, Texas. Hanna served as the treasurer of Laramie County during the 1920s and 1930s. Hanna was elected as Laramie County's assessor as a Republican and served until his resignation in December 1943, after being elected to the mayoralty of Cheyenne, and deputy county assessor W. H. Hale Jr. was appointed by the Laramie County Commission to succeed him. Mayor Hanna announced that he would run for mayor of Cheyenne and on October 19, 1943, he placed second in the mayoral primary, behind John J. McInerney and ahead of incumbent Mayor Ed Warren. On November 2, he defeated McInerney with 3,079 votes to his 2,775 votes. On November 30, he announced that he would appoint Jesse B. Ekdall as Cheyenne's chief of police once he took office on January 1, 1944. On January 13, he stated that he was opposed to legalizing gambling when he was asked by James H. Walton and later proposed a $1,000 license fee for the operation of jukebox and pinball machines. =Bribery= On March 11, 1944, members of Cheyenne's police department solicited a $100 bribe from Lola West, a tavern operator, as protection money and did the same to W. C. Grimes for $25. Judge Sam M. Thompson issued four arrest warrants for Hanna, Ekdall, Captain Gerald J. Morris, and Sergeant E. K. Violette hours after the affidavits were filed by county attorney Edward Byron Hirst. Hanna was arrested at a city council meeting while Ekdall, Morris, and Violette voluntarily turned themselves in. On March 20, Hanna, Ekdall, Morris, and Violette were charged with soliciting and accepting bribes in Laramie County District court and pled not guilty. Hanna and Ekdall's bail was set at $4,000 and Morris and Violette's bail was set at $3,000. On March 22, Thompson was disqualified from presiding over the bribery trial after the four men filed an affidavit requesting a different judge alleging that Thompson was biased and prejudiced. The trial started on May 1, with Judge Harry P. Ilsley presiding. The four men were charged with soliciting and accepting bribes from ten people and were defended by former District attorney A. D. Walton and former Wyoming Attorney general James A. Greenwood. L. D. Parker and Fred M. Taylor, two federal investigators that worked in the alcohol tax unit of the Internal Revenue Service, claimed that they witnessed the four men discuss a payment of $100 from West and that Violette had taken the $100 from a table after West had counted the money. Grimes also gave a list of the serial numbers of the bribe money and the serial numbers of three $5 bills in Hanna's possession were found on the list. Hanna claimed that the money taken from West and Grimes were fines for illegal activities and were part of $680 in fines that had been issued. On May 6, the jury found all four men guilty after three and a half hours of deliberation. Hanna and Ekdall were sentenced to seven to ten years in prison while Violette was sentenced to two to three years and Morris was sentenced to one to two years. Warden A. S. Roach designated the four men as trustees and sent them to work on a farm in Rawlins, Wyoming, but the men later requested to be returned to prison. A false report stated that the men were sent back to prison after engaging in a fist fight. On March 20, Bruce S. Jones and Gus Fleischli, the remaining members of the city council following Hanna's arrest, voted to make juvenile officer F. B. McVicar the acting chief of police. On May 8, Jones and Fleischli approved a resolution that declared the position of mayor vacant due to Hanna's conviction and appointed Jones as acting mayor. Later life Hanna and Ekdall applied for parole consideration at the July 1, 1945, meeting of the Wyoming Board of Parole, but Malcolm LeSueur, the secretary of the board, stated that their requests would not be considered. On October 3, the board granted them parole starting on December 15, and were to be released from parole on December 15, 1946. On August 7, 1962, Hanna married Neoma Smith in Kilgore, Texas. On April 23, 1974, he died in Eastland Memorial Hospital in Eastland, Texas. In 1978, the Cheyenne City and County Building where he was put on trial, and where Tom Horn was tried in 1903, was nominated as a historic place.

The mountain is situated in Glacier Peak Wilderness of the North Cascades, on land managed by Wenatchee National Forest. Its nearest higher peak is Cardinal Peak, to the southeast, and Saska Peak is positioned to the west-southwest. These three highest peaks of the Chelan Mountains enclose the head of North Fork Entiat River valley. Bearcat Ridge radiates from Emerald Peak one mile to the northeast. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains into the Chelan River and Entiat River drainage basins. The first ascent of this peak was made in 1937 by William A. Long.http://www.rhinoclimbs.com/WA100HighestFAChronology.htm Emerald Peak ranks as the second-highest peak in the Chelan Mountains, and 70th-highest summit in Washington state. Climate Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Geology Emerald Peak is composed primarily of granodiorite and hornblende quartz diorite, minerals of the Cardinal Peak pluton. Emerald Peak summit detail The North Cascades feature some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, spires, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. Glacier Peak, a stratovolcano that is west of Emerald Peak, began forming in the mid- Pleistocene.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

It is one of the oldest mosques in the country. According to local folklore, the mosque is built at the spot where the first Muslim Arab traders landed and subsequently settled in the area. It is believed that a vessel carrying seven members of the royal family of Hadhramaut, Yemen came ashore at this location. They included the Sultan Ashraff Waliullah, his five brothers and a sister. When Waliullah died in 1024 AD he was buried in a tomb on the hill. Allegedly one day, when the chief of the Masjid Al-Abrar in Beruwala was cleaning the tomb he stepped on a sharp thorn following which he rest under a tree and fell asleep. During his slumber, Waliullah appeared as a vision and sought that a mosque be built where his tomb was. Many locals mistakenly still think that Waliullah built the mosque. At that time the site was known as ‚ÄúUtchchamalai‚Äù in Tamil, which translates to ‚Äúhigh hill‚Äù, over time this was modified to its current name of Ketchchimalai. The current building was constructed in 1911 by a wealthy Muslim businessman. It is essentially a squarish white building, with an ornate arched exterior, curving dutch-style gables, with an unusual domed minaret crowned with a crescent-and-star ornament. Outside the mosque but within its grounds are the graves of two imams (father and son) and a madrasa. The mosque is the focus for a major Eid al-Fitr festival held at the end of Ramadan, with large numbers of pilgrims attending.
