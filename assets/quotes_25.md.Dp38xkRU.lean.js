English: War to the death) is a term coined by Benjamín Vicuña Mackenna and used in Chilean historiography to describe the irregular, no-quarter warfare that broke out from 1819 to 1821 during the Chilean War of Independence. After the royalists had been expelled from all cities and ports north of the Bio-Bio River, Vicente Benavides organized royalist resistance in La Frontera with the aid of Mapuche chiefs. The aid of the Mapuches was vital to the royalists since they had lost control of all cities and ports north of Valdivia. Most Mapuches valued the treaties they had with the Spanish authorities, while many other Mapuches regarded the matter with indifference and played both sides against each other. The Pincheira brothers, a future outlaw group, served Benavides in the Guerra a muerte by defending the Cordillera. As result of the Guerra a muerte the government of nascent republic begun to distrust the Franciscan missionaries of Chillán who were regarded as representatives of the old regime. This led to the recruitment of a new contingent of missionaries for Chillán in the 1830s. See also *Banditry in Chile Sources *.

She was launched in 1964 and transported supplies to Australian military forces in South Vietnam between 1966 and 1972 under both civil and military ownership. She returned to service with ANL in 1972, being sold in 1979 to a Greek shipping company and renamed Pleias. She continued in civilian service under several names before being broken up in 1993. Construction Jeparit was built for the Australian National Line. She was laid down at Evans Deakin & Co in Brisbane in 1962 and launched in 1964. Operational historyVietnam War= In June 1966, she was chartered by the Department of Shipping and Transport to transport equipment and supplies from Australia to South Vietnam for the 1st Australian Task Force. This became an open-ended charter in August as the ship was needed to meet the supply needs of the Australian forces in South Vietnam, which were greater than had been anticipated by Army planners. The ship's cargo usually consisted of vehicles (including Centurion tanks), ammunition, civil aid program stores, and supplies for the Australian Services Canteen Organisation. The ANL coastal cargo ship Boonaroo was also chartered to carry similar cargoes to South Vietnam, but was unable to embark tanks. In February 1967, the Seamen's Union of Australia decided that it would not provide crews to Jeparit or Boonaroo for further voyages to South Vietnam; its members left both ships and were subsequently sacked by ANL. This move was not initially supported by most of the union movement, and members of other maritime unions remained on board. While Boonaroo was commissioned into the RAN for a single voyage in March 1967, Jeparit remained under ANL control but was given a mixed crew of 20 merchant seamen and a RAN detachment of an officer and 17 sailors. The RAN detachment worked under the ship's civilian master, but was additionally under naval discipline. The ship made 25 return trips to South Vietnam with a mixed crew between 1967 and December 1969. The naval and civilian sailors worked well together, though there was disquiet when it was discovered that the civilians' received a small \\"war bonus\\"<5th Engineer Peter Burge - Personal experience> during time spent in the war zone while the RAN personnel received only the usual allowances. This was resolved by paying the difference into the RAN Relief Trust Fund. Most voyages were between Sydney and Vung Tau, though the ship had to unload Centurion tanks at Cam Ranh Bay as there was no heavy lifting equipment at Vung Tau. Unloading and backloading times reduced over time as procedures improved and the crew gained experience, and by late 1967, the ship was operating on a three-day turnaround at Vung Tau. Jeparit remained the occasional focus of anti-war attention between 1967 and 1969. The ship was targeted by a small protest in December 1967 and reloading in Sydney was occasionally disrupted by union activity. These protests came to a head in November 1969, when the Waterside Workers Federation refused to load or unload Jeparit. After a period of negotiation, the ship was commissioned into the RAN as HMAS Jeparit on 11 December.Jeparit to join RAN to beat ban Canberra Times 11 December 1969 page 1Jeparit in RAN now Canberra Times 12 December 1969 page 3 The ship's master was appointed Jeparits commanding officer the next day and received a commission in the Royal Australian Naval Volunteer Reserve, but the ship continued to operate with a mixed civilian-naval crew. This did not end the ship's problems, however, as RAN personnel assigned to load the ship were initially slow and a building contractor had to be engaged to load tanks onto Jeparit after civilian crane operators refused their services. Army personnel from A Squadron 2nd Cavalry Regiment were also tasked with the job of unloading and loading the Jeparit. HMAS Jeparit continued to travel between Australia and Vietnam as a ship of the Royal Australian Navy. These voyages were generally uneventful, and the mixed crew continued to work together well and there were few further labour relations problems at Australian ports. Australian forces were withdrawn from South Vietnam in 1971 and 1972, and Jeparit completed her 43rd and final trip on 11 March 1972, when she returned to Sydney with the last Australian troops and equipment from Vietnam. The ship had conducted five voyages with a civilian crew, 21 as an ANL ship with a mixed crew and 17 in RAN service. Jeparit was decommissioned on 15 March and returned to ANL.ANL freighter returns to civlian duties Freight & Container Transportation June 1972 page 7 She received the battle honour \\"Vietnam 1969-72\\" in recognition of her service while a commissioned vessel. =Post- war career= She continued in ANL service until September 1979 when she was sold the Greek company Massis Charity Shipping and renamed Pleias.

The band's original influences included bands such as The Verve, New Order, and The Smiths, but in recent years their interests have become more influenced by their contemporaries. The Coast released their self-titled EP in Canada in March 2006, and in the US in May 2007. The Coast has shared the stage with the likes of Elbow, The French Kicks, Tokyo Police Club (who also provided a remix of The Coast's song \\"Tightrope\\" in 2008), Born Ruffians, Islands, The Duke Spirit, Ra Ra Riot, The Virgins, and Chairlift. The band was touted as one of the acts to watch in 2008 by Canada's national music monthly Exclaim! and Toronto's Eye Weekly. The band signed to Aporia Records in late 2007 and recorded their debut full-length album Expatriate. The album was released on April 1, 2008 in Canada, on August 19, 2008 in the US (digitally), February 2, 2009 in the UK, and May 5, 2009 on CD in the US by their new Minneapolis-based label Afternoon Records. Nationwide tours of Canada and the States followed. In early 2009, the band did their last tour of the UK and then started their hiatus to take a break from their year and a half of touring. The Coast’s guitarist, Ian Fosbery, also spent this time finishing his university degree – and their bassist, Luke Melchiorre, began work towards his Masters. During 2009, the Coast also spent every spare moment locked away in their rehearsal space writing and working on new material. In November 2009 they once again entered the Lincoln County Social Club, the same studio in which they recorded Expatriate, with 14 new tracks - the most they've ever tried to record. The album was once again produced with long-time friend and producer Chris Stringer (We're Marching On, Ohbijou, Rush). The 9-track record, entitled Queen Cities, was released in September 2010 by Aporia. Later in the year the group announced that they would be disbanding.

Early life Middleton was born in Earlsfield, Surrey, England, on 10 May 1893. He initially served in the 6th London Brigade of the Royal Field Artillery, but transferred to the Royal Flying Corps in 1916. First combat tour His first tour of combat in fighters came in Number 48 Squadron of the Royal Flying Corps. This unit was the first supplied with the two seater Bristol F.2b fighter.http://www.theaerodrome.com/services/gbritain/rfc/48.php Because either the pilot or the observer/gunner could fire upon enemy aircraft, both members of the flight crew would be credited with any victories on missions they flew together. Middleton scored his first victory on 30 April 1917. He scored four more victories in May, in the vicinity of Douai, France, becoming an ace on the 27th with a double triumph. He scored twice more in June before being withdrawn from combat duty for a rest. Middleton's seven wins were achieved while teamed with three different gunners; one of them, Scotsman Alexander W. Merchant went on to become an ace in his own right.http://www.theaerodrome.com/aces/england/middleton1.php Second combat tour Middleton returned for a second tour of combat duty on the Western Front as a flight leader in Number 48 Squadron of the newly founded Royal Air Force. He was still piloting Bristols. He reopened his victory list shortly after his return, on 17 April 1918, shooting down on Albatros D.V and driving another down out of control. He scored doubles on both the 3rd and the 8th. He then switched gunners, from Captain Frank Godfrey to British Lieutenant Alfred Stanley Mills. With Mills in the rear seat, Middleton ran off five more wins in May, ending the month with 18 victories. In June, Middleton switched back to Godfrey in the back seat, and scored five more victories, followed by another in July. On 3 August, Middleton was awarded one of the first Distinguished Flying Crosses. There was a lapse in victories until September; then Middleton resumed with Mills once again teaming as his gunner. Middleton and Mills shot a Hannover C down in flames on 15 September, followed by two Fokker D.VIIs destroyed on 20 September. Middleton was the fourth highest scorer of the 44 aces in 48 Squadron. His 27 victories came overwhelmingly over German fighter planes; only three of his wins were over enemy reconnaissance craft. Three of the observer/gunners he had teamed with became aces in their own right; Merchant with 8 wins, Mills with 15, and Godfrey with all 12 of his victories won from Middleton's rear seat. Postwar life After the war, Middleton emigrated to Argentina. Inline citationsReferences * British and Empire Aces of World War I. Christopher Shores.

Biography Mariotte was born in Avignon (Vaucluse) in 1875. After studies at the School of Saint- Michel in Saint-Étienne, he entered naval school aged 15. In 1894, while serving on the frigate Iphigénie, he wrote to a friend that he missed music and if he had the means he would go to the Conservatoire de Paris. While still split between the life of a sailor and musician, he worked away on harmony. He took part in campaigns on board the Forfait in the South China Sea, then on the Vinh-Long, where he witnessed the closing stages of the Sino-Japanese War. He brought back sketches that became the suite Kakémonos, initially written for the piano, but later orchestrated and performed at the Concerts Poulet on 29 January 1923 (Panorama, Geishas, Temple au Crépuscule, Fête).From French Wikipedia In the Far East he read the Oscar Wilde play Salome, and decided to set it to music. On return to Europe, he sailed on the Marceau then the Magenta where finally, thanks to Admiral Gervais, he had a piano. On six months leave he followed a course at the Conservatoire by Charles-Marie Widor. After prolonging his absence, he resigned from the navy in 1897. He entered the Schola Cantorum where he was taught by Vincent d'Indy, who found him work as a pianist at the home of the comte de Chambrun, to whom he played each day for precisely 60 minutes, in particular the 32 sonatas of Beethoven in chronological order. Due to his mother's health, he went back to Saint-Étienne and taught piano and became an organist, also directing the symphonic society; he also wrote an operetta Armande. Appointed professor of piano at the Lyon Conservatoire, he completed the score of Salomé, believing himself to have permission from Wilde's estate and the publisher Methuen. In fact, having obtained the agreement to use the play, Richard Strauss had in turn asked his publisher Fürstner to acquire the rights. Wilde's particularly complicated estate led to a court case that favoured the rights of Fürstner. Mariotte learnt that Fürstner would oppose the production of a \\"Salomé française\\" and after going to Berlin, he obtained permission to have his piece staged, on condition that 40% royalties went to Richard Strauss and 10% to Fürstner, with all scores to be sent after the run to Fürstner to be destroyed. Romain Rolland, having read an article by Mariotte in the Revue internationale de musique, helped him to obtain a more generous settlement from Strauss. On 30 October 1908, Mariotte's opera was produced at the Grand-Théâtre de Lyon with success (de Wailly in the title role), and staged in 1910 at the Gaîté-Lyrique in Paris, while Strauss's Salomé was on at the Opéra. After having been performed at Nancy, Le Havre, Marseille, Geneva, and Prague, Mariotte's Salomé was seen at the Opéra on 1 July 1919 with Lucienne Bréval. In November 2005 the Opera National de Montpellier juxtaposed the Strauss and Mariotte operas.Maddocks F. Review in Opera, March 2006, pp 303–304. Mariotte's Salomé was produced by Wexford Festival Opera in October 2014. During the war, Mariotte was sent to Salonica where he contracted malaria. After the end of the war, in 1920 he became director of the Conservatoire d'Orléans where he taught René Berthelot, who succeeded him. He led the direction of the Opéra- Comique from 1936 to 1939. He died in Izieux, (Loire) in 1944, aged 68.  Compositions  Mariotte's works use a wide range of operatic effects with particularly striking choral writing.Langham Smith R. Antoine Mariotte. In: New Grove Dictionary of Opera. Macmillan, London and New York, 1997. He displayed a robust temperament in both tragedy and lighter music.Landormy P. La Musique Française après Debussy. Gallimard, Paris, 1943. On 28 February 1913 he presented in Lyon a tragédie lyrique, Le Vieux Roi on a libretto by Rémy de Gourmont, which, despite a successful launch, failed after its third performance. His three-act comédie musicale Léontine soeurs premiered at the Théâtre Trianon Lyrique on 25 May 1924 and was published later that year. Esther, princesse d'Israêl, a three-act tragédie lyrique after André Dumas and Sébastien-Charles Leconte was created at the Opéra on 28 April 1925, Gargantua ('scenes rabelaisiennes' in 4 acts) was seen at the Opéra-Comique on 15 February 1935 and revived in 1938, and Nele Dooryn a three-act 'conte lyrique' (libretto by Camille Mauclair) was given five performances at the Opéra- Comique in 1940. In 1930 he wrote a Cantate pour le centenaire de la Conquête de l'Algérie, played with enthusiasm in Algiers. In 1934 came the symphonic version of Impressions urbaines, five pieces for piano (Usines, Faubourgs, Guingettes, Decombres, Gares) premiered by Édouard Risler in 1921, which depict the hard human and physical nature of Paris in expressive and sometimes violent means. There was also a Paysage maritime — a \\"sketch for harp and orchestra\\", part of an unfinished sea symphony, a sonata for piano and some songs.  Bibliography *A.

He was succeeded by Michael W. Lodge. Biography Odunton has had more than 20 years of experience in the International Civil Service, with progressively increased responsibilities in marine resource policy formulation, particularly marine mineral resources. Since the establishment of the Authority in 1996 he has concurrently held several positions there at the policy-making level, as Deputy to the Secretary-General, head of the ISA Office of Resources and Environmental Monitoring, Interim Director-General of the Enterprise (the Authority’s seabed mining arm, not yet operational) and Secretary of the Authority’s Assembly. He has conceptualized and convened technical workshops of the Authority, on topics such as deep-seabed polymetallic nodule exploration, the development of environmental guidelines, and proposed technologies for deep-seabed mining of nodules. He earned a Master of Science degree in Mineral Economics and Mine Finance from the Henry Krumb School of Mines (1974), Columbia University. He then had a brief stint with private industry, spending a year (1974–75) as a Mine Planning Officer with the Bethlehem Steel Corporation at its Rose Mine, Morgantown, Pennsylvania. =Career with United Nations= Odunton first became associated with the United Nations in 1974, when he and two university colleagues were requested to prepare a paper on resource assessment of the polymetallic nodule deposits in the international sea-bed area to aid the work of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, which was developing an international legal framework for the sea-bed and oceans as a whole. He later helped prepare background papers for the First Committee of the Conference, which elaborated the sea-bed provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, completed in 1982. At the United Nations Secretariat in New York he served as an Economic Affairs Officer in its Department of International Economic Social Affairs (1980–1983), where he helped draw up an International Ocean Institute programme on management and use of seabed resources. Odunton subsequently (1984–88) held several other positions in the Department, including Chief of the Mineral Resources Section, Ocean Economics and Technology Branch. As head of this section he was responsible for reports to United Nations meetings on marine mineral resource development.Published reports and studies prepared by the Section or to which it contributed during this period included: *Economic impact of sea-bed mineral resources development in light of the Convention on the Law of the Sea / Jean-Pierre Lévy and Nii Allotey Odunton.

Odunton was adviser to the Minerals Commission of the government of Ghana (1984–87), providing advice on national minerals policy, a revamping of the national mining code and on investment promotion in the gold sector. He also helped the government with procedural changes in the exploitation and marketing of gold and diamonds. As work went forward on the establishment of institutions envisaged by the Law of the Sea Convention, Odunton worked in the office of the United Nations Special Representative of the Secretary- General for the Law of the Sea, Satya Nandan. Assigned to the Preparatory Commission for the International Seabed Authority and for the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, he served as Deputy Secretary of Special Commission 3 on the mining code for polymetallic nodules and Secretary of Special Commission 2 on the Enterprise. In 1988, he became the first Officer in charge of the United Nations Office for the Law of the Sea in Kingston, Jamaica, where the Preparatory Commission met and the Seabed Authority was to establish its headquarters. He has been with the Authority continuously since it came into being in 1996. In June 2008 the Assembly of the Authority elected him by acclamation as the second Secretary-General of the Authority, succeeding Satya Nandan. =Personal= Born on 14 June 1951, Odunton was married to Naa Jama Odunton (deceased) and has four children.

Professor Melloni is a major contributor to the work on the Second Vatican Council led and promoted by the so-called “scuola di Bologna”. Its research mainly focused on the discontinuity hermeneutics, which differs from the official position of the Church according to a few Italian journalists. Pope Benedict XVI in fact states: \\"Discontinuity hermeneutics is likely to create an abrupt separation between the pre-conciliar and post-conciliar church\\". On the other hand, scholars related to the “scuola di Bologna” highlight the fact that the Pope's opinion does not centre exclusively on continuity. According to Melloni it is impossible to read the Pope's words as a mere post-conciliar repentance.

Education Cejrowski graduated from the XVII High School by the name of Andrzej Frycz Modrzewski in Warsaw. In 2010 he received a BA in Sociology from Catholic University of Lublin. Cejrowski studied also without graduating at Aleksander Zelwerowicz State Theatre Academy; University of Warsaw, Santa Clara University. CareerRadio= Cejrowski started his radio career in 1991 - along with Korneliusz Pacuda he conducted the program Czy jest miejsce na country w Polsce? (Is There a Place for country music in Poland?). One of its results was a contract with American ABC Network - since 1992 all Polish local broadcasting stations had started to broadcast Polish version of American Country Countdown. Wojciech Cejrowski (at the beginning along with Korneliusz Pacuda) was hosting this broadcast for eleven years. The very last one (No. 519) was broadcast in January 2003. In 1993 Wojciech Cejrowski was offered the job by Wojciech Mann and Krzysztof Materna, owners of the private radio station Radio Kolor (Radio Color). First he hosted his own music programme then also famous Aeroplan (Airplane) together with Beata Pawlikowska and then his leading morning programme (every Saturday from 6 to 10 am - which later gave the beginning to WC Kwadrans). His cooperation with Radio Kolor ended in 1997 (soon after Mann and Materna left the radio station and some changes for worse were made). He worked for Radio WAW-a for next 3 years (1997–1999). These days Cejrowski's radio broadcasts can be found in various public and private broadcasting stations in Poland.

He also was the host of the Stajnia show (The Stable) broadcast by the Polish TV and some local TV stations. Between 1996 and 1997 Cejrowski recorded a series of 30 episodes reporting on his journey to South America for TV Niepokalanów (now called TV Puls). While at RTL 7 since 1997, Cejrowski, along with Jan Pietrzak, Jan Tadeusz Stanisławski, Krzysztof Daukszewicz and others, participated in a satirist talk show focused on various aspects of daily life in Poland. Between 1999 and 2000 Cejrowski co-hosted with Alicja Resich- Modlińska a talk show Piękny i Bestia (Beauty and the Beast). While at Polsat (2003-4) Cejrowski hosted his own show Z kamerą wśród ludzi (With Camera Amongst the People also broadcast by TV 4 and Polsat 2).

In his rhetoric, Cejrowski refers to LGBT people as sodomites, buggers, and pederasts. In his article for \\"Dziennik\\" he notes that he \\"prefers savages rather than gay parades\\". Cejrowski states that European society is overwhelmingly against homosexuality, and advocates for the institution of nationwide homosexuality clinics aiming to 'alter this disgusting behavior'. He says that \\"gay people should be pointed at, as the sin of sodomy evokes disgust\\". As far as above mentioned \\"savages\\" - that's how he refers to native Indians, whom he often visits on his travels and receives their hospitality. Cejrowski thinks that evolution is not true, he believes in creationism. He also advocates against vaccines. Religion  Cejrowski is a hard line traditional Catholic. He states that as far as the Bible is concerned, he prefers The Old Testament - he likes when God is speaking to him directly, telling him what is good and what is sinful, and what to do. HE is also a known critic of the current Pope Francis, calling him a heretic. Cejrowski postulates, that Catholic priests should be exempt from the rule of law in a given country, instead being accountable only to their church's hierarchy. He adds, that most priests who supposedly molested kids are gay, thus perpetuating the myth of gays being more prone to pedophilia than other sexual orientations. Cejrowski is also strongly against abortion and abortion providers. In one of the interviews he said \\"I wish abortion clinics could burn down and abortion providers get shot\\".

It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The building is a brick building primarily in the Classical Revival style, made plainer when its original cornice was removed.  History  The hospital was founded by George G. Eitel in 1912 and served wealthy citizens of Minneapolis. The Minneapolis Journal first announced plans in 1906, and published drawings for a four-story hospital in 1907. Fund raising caused construction delays. In January 1911, the paper published renderings by Long, Lamoreaux & Long for a five-story hospital, and in June for eight stories. It was finally built as five stories on a basement. It featured sun porches with Navajo rugs and private rooms with brass beds and mahogany furniture. His wife Jeannette Eitel, a nurse, directed the nursing school. The Eitels lived in an apartment accessible from 14th Street. Eitel's nephew, George D. Eitel, ran the hospital after his uncle's death. In 1982, it began a formal alliance with Abbott Northwestern Hospital, and in 1985, the 144-bed hospital closed. The building later became the Willow Street Center for Youth and Families. In 2005, Village Green Companies submitted a proposal for renovating the former Eitel Hospital building into apartments, along with two additional six-story buildings on the block. The proposal included an adaptive reuse renovation of the 1911 building, along with rebuilding the cornice in a design similar to the original cornice. Later additions to the building were proposed for demolition. Ground was broken on the complex on October 25, 2006 and Eitel Building City Apartments was completed in September 2008.

Looney Tunes cartoon short directed by Chuck Jones and written by Tedd Pierce. The short was released on July 21, 1956, and stars Bugs Bunny. Summary Bugs is tunneling the cross country to meet his cousin Herman in San Francisco, only to run head first into a boulder which is actually a large nugget of gold. Bugs is considering how to keep the gold safe; Nasty Canasta sees this and sets up a simple stand claiming to be a banker who can safely store Bugs' gold. Bugs falls for the ruse. When Bugs decides to ask for his gold back, Canasta claims that the bank is closing and traps Bugs in the folded-up stand while he rides away with the gold. Wrathfully, Bugs vows revenge on Nasty Canasta by saying: \\"You realize that this is not going to go unchallenged.\\" Six months later, Canasta has used his ill-gotten gains to start a casino in San Francisco, which is shamelessly rigged in the house's favor. Bugs enters the casino in the role, playing a hopelessly naïve country boy who confuses a slot machine for a \\"telly-o- phone\\". When Bugs uses it to phone his mother for some money, he hits the jackpot, much to Canasta's shock. In an attempt to recoup this loss, Canasta convinces Bugs to stay for a game and thinks that he is maneuvering the apparently easy mark into playing a game of roulette on the pretense of it being a game of marbles. To build his would-be victim's confidence, Canasta arranges for Bugs to win on his first spin. But Bugs develops a winning streak on the same number (#23). To recoup his losses, Canasta covers #23 with a block of wood and sets the wheel up for the marble to stop on #00. When it does, he laughs and strikes the table in triumph, causing the ball to bounce on and hammer through a knot in the wood block, giving Bugs another win. Determined to get back Bugs’ now massive winnings, Canasta convinces Bugs to try playing draw poker and Bugs literally draws a picture of a fireplace poker. Bugs then pretends to misinterpret Canasta's description of the importance of having the biggest hand to win by blowing his glove into a giant balloon. Canasta loses his temper at his would-be victim's obtuseness (\\"CUT IT OUT, CAN'T YA?!\\"). Bugs threatens to walk out, forcing Canasta to grovel in order to coax Bugs to return to the game. After staking all his money, Bugs promptly wins with a Four of a Kind consisting of Aces (\\"All I got is two pair: a pair of ones, and another pair of ones\\"), trumping Canasta's Full House. With his casino's bank broken at the hands of this simpleton who seems physically incapable of losing, Canasta decides to rob Bugs at gunpoint on the pretense of it being another game of chance, namely Russian roulette. Bugs, still keeping in character, naïvely spins the revolver bullet cylinder like a slot machine and a mass of coins inexplicably pours out the gun's barrel. As Bugs departs with all the casino's funds and more, Canasta greedily tries to win money from his gun, only to shoot himself in the attempt and collapse. Bugs pops in and says to the audience: \\"The moral of this story is: 'Don't try to steal no 18 karats [carrots] from no rabbit\\" shaking his head and swirling his eyebrows.

He is an expert on design patents and copyrights, and is often used as an expert witness in court. He earned his bachelor's degree in Industrial Design and a Master’s in Fine Arts in Industrial Design at UCLA. There, his professors included designers Henry Dreyfuss, Charles Eames, Neils Different and Don Chadwick. In 1970, while still in graduate school, he designed an innovative lifeguard rescue device that is still being used today and he founded Surf-Saving International to manufacture and sell the device. In 1978, he started Ron Rezek Lighting in Culver City, CA, which he sold in 2004 but which continues to design original decorative light fixtures. In 1986, he designed the first contemporary-styled ceiling fan, which \\"quickly became popular in both commercial and residential settings,\\" noted the New York Times. Later, he began the niche company, The Modern Fan Co., which is the only U.S. company to design and sell only contemporary ceiling fans. In 2008, he designed a line of ceiling fans inspired by American and European design movements of the 20th century and launched a new company, The Period Arts Fan Co. Career Ron Rezek's career began in 1970 while he was a graduate student at UCLA working on an MFA degree, studying industrial design and working as a teaching assistant. While experimenting with rotational molding of plastic, in particular cross-linking orange polyethylene to produce an extremely tough and seamless plastic vessel, he was approached by a Los Angeles county lifeguard to investigate an alternative for the spun aluminum rescue can. After meeting with Captain Bob Burnside at a lifeguard station at Zuma Beach, CA, Rezek realized that rotational molding was the perfect production process for a water rescue device because it produced a watertight seam. It was the toughest plastic available and the tooling was not expensive. This molding technique also allowed for flexibility in the form so Rezek decided on a torpedo shape and added large side handles and a solid handle at the back to tow in the people being rescued. In 1971, his rescue can was accepted in the California Design show because judges realized it was “the first major design breakthrough in this type of equipment in 50 years.” The rescue can was later exhibited at the Pasadena Art Museum and was also published in House Beautiful in March 1971 and Industrial Design Magazine in December 1971. Rezek sold the company in the 1980s, but his rescue can is still preferred by professional lifeguards and the actors carrying the red buoys under their arms on the show Baywatch. In 1978, Rezek started Ron Rezek Lighting to design and sell contemporary decorative lighting and furniture. He maintained a showroom in SoHo, New York and West Los Angeles, and an office and warehouse in Culver City. His steel-and-chrome desk lamp, hanging steel- and-aluminum desk lamp and chrome-steel-and-maple table were included in the 1976 California Design show. In 2004, he sold the company to the Italian lighting company, Artemide. While the majority of new furnishing products are adaptations of traditional styles, Rezek has focused his work on advancing the modern idiom. “Rezek’s philosophy has been to subtract as many of the details as possible and rely on what he calls ‘pure geometry,’” wrote Charlyne Varkonyi Schaub in the South Florida Sun-Sentinel. In the late 1980s, the designer of contemporary products tackled the traditional ceiling fan form. He had never owned a fan when he was hired by a ceiling fan company to create a contemporary-looking one, the New York Times wrote. “At that point, ceiling fans had never really been a design object,” Rezek told reporter Julie Scelfo. “Most of the fans on the market were reproduction Victorian fans, and if a guy had a Mies van der Rohe apartment in Chicago, he probably wasn’t going to put one in there.” For a century (1882–1986), ceiling fans were made in Victorian or other traditional, ornamental styles. In 1986, Rezek created the first contemporary ceiling fan, the Stratos, “which introduced a more modern, stream-lined aesthetic”. The Vista Press, Vista, California, September 18, 1968. Vista resident and UCLA graduate student Ron Rezek wins design contest for his original chair. Rezek was granted patents in 1991 for the fan’s design and mechanical innovations. Rezek was the first to eliminate blade irons holding fan blades. With his patented invention of rotor slots, blades slip into the rotor. His rotor ended the out-of-balance problems and tedious assembly required with classic blade iron configurations. “His Stratos revolutionized the ceiling fan,” wrote Washington Post writer Patricia Dane Rogers. Two years later, Rezek created seven more innovative fans and in 1997, he began The Modern Fan Co. in Ashland, Oregon, which Architectural Record cites as offering original, “graceful designs for normally clunky fixtures.” Rezek has worked independently as an industrial designer, designing original products for his companies as well as Herman Miller office equipment, Design Within Reach, Artemide, Monarch Mirror, Del Rey Lighting, Fredrick Raymond Lighting, Halsey Lighting, Lavi Industries and others. In his early career, he taught at UCLA’s art and architecture departments, the Art Center College of Design and Southern California Institute of Architecture. In 1990, Ron launched Highlights, lighting showrooms in California -- Santa Monica, San Francisco and San Diego – as well as Seattle and Miami. He designed each showroom to be a unique “gallery of lights” featuring the best in modern design. In 2002, he sold the showrooms. His most recent notable designs include a line of ceiling fans for his company, The Period Arts Fan Co. Each of the fan models are inspired by American and Europeans design movements of the 20th Century, including Arts and Crafts movement, Neoclassicism, Art Nouveau, Wiener Werkstatte, Viennese Secessionism, Bauhaus along with Futurism and French Art Deco. His designs have been exhibited in museums and have appeared in movies, TV shows, books and magazines. ReferencesExternal links *Rezek Lighting, archive of vintage Rezek Lighting designs.

Through this process Berman Guedes Stretton were selected by Cheltenham Borough Council and the extension was completed in 2012. Baron de Ferrieres, a former Mayor and Liberal MP for Cheltenham, gave 43 important paintings, mostly from Belgium and the Netherlands, to the town. He also donated £1,000 towards the building of a gallery in which to display them. The Museum was opened in 1907 in the adjacent former Schools of Art and Science. A major extension to the building by Hugh Casson was opened by the Princess Royal in September 1989, where the main entrance to the gallery is now situated. The museum is particularly noted for its Arts and Crafts collection of furniture, textiles, ceramics, carvings, silver and jewellery which is recognised as an outstanding collection of international importance for which the Art Gallery & Museum has received Designated status. Cheltenham's history is well represented, and in addition there are paintings spanning four centuries, oriental collections of pottery and costume, and archaeological treasures from the neighbouring Cotswolds.

Originally a student of botany, he began his medical studies in 1841 at Paris, where he was a pupil of Armand Trousseau (1801–1867). In 1845 he became an interne des hôpitaux, earning his doctorate in 1849. Afterwards he worked as a physician at the Hôpital Beaujon, and in 1853 earned his agrégation with a thesis on cirrhosis of the liver. In 1868 he was appointed professor of therapy to the medical faculty in Paris, maintaining this position until his death in 1879. Gubler made a number of contributions in the fields of medicine and pharmacology. He is credited with being the first physician to differentiate between hemotogenous and hepatogenous icterus. His name is associated with \\"Millard- Gubler syndrome\\", a condition characterized by softening of brain tissue that is caused by blockage of blood vessels of the pons. The disease is named in conjunction with Auguste Louis Jules Millard (1830–1915), who initially described the disorder in 1855. The eponymous \\"Gubler's line\\" is a line of superficial origin of the trigeminal nerve on the pons, a lesion below which results in the aforementioned Millard-Gubler syndrome. He was the author of many works on botany, clinical medicine, physiology and pharmacology, with several articles on the latter subject being published in the \\"Journal de thérapeutique\\". Among his better written efforts was an 1856 treatise on hemiplegia titled De l'hémiplégie alterne envisagée comme signe de lésion de la protubérance annulaire et comme preuve de la décussation des nerfs faciaux, and a major publication involving pharmacopoeia called Commentaires thérapeutiques du codex medicamentarius, a book that was awarded the \\"Chaussier Prize\\" (Prix Chaussier, named after anatomist François Chaussier) by the Académie des sciences. Full text of \\"Les fondations de l'Académie des Sciences Gubler was a founding member of the Société de biologie, and in 1865 became a member of the Académie de médecine. While still an interne, he was asked by Dr. Trousseau to serve as a traveling companion to a young man suffering from emotional distress. While in Milan, Gubler was seriously wounded by a gunshot from his companion, forcing him to spend a year recuperating in Milan.

Patched is an essential gene in embryogenesis for proper segmentation in the fly embryo, mutations in which may be embryonic lethal. Patched functions as the receptor for the Hedgehog protein and controls its spatial distribution, in part via endocytosis of bound Hedgehog protein, which is then targeted for lysosomal degradation.  Discovery  The original mutations in the ptc gene were discovered in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster by 1995 Nobel Laureates Eric F. Wieschaus and Christiane Nusslein-Volhard and colleagues, and the gene was independently cloned in 1989 by Joan Hooper in the laboratory of Matthew P. Scott, and by Philip Ingham and colleagues.  Role in hedgehog signaling  Patched is part of a negative feedback mechanism for hedgehog signaling that helps shape the spatial gradient of signaling activity across tissues. In the absence of hedgehog, low levels of patched are sufficient to suppress activity of the signal transduction pathway. When hedgehog is present, its cholesterol moiety binds to the sterol-sensing domain in patched, which then inhibits the activity of smoothened. Smoothened is a G protein-coupled receptor, most of which is stored in membrane bound vesicles internally within the cell and which increases at the cell surface when hedgehog is present. Smoothened must be present on the cell membrane in order for the Hedgehog signaling pathway to be activated. Among other genes, the transcription of the patched gene is induced by hedgehog signaling, with the accumulation of the patched protein limiting signaling through the Smoothened protein. Recent work implicates the cilium in intracellular trafficking of hedgehog signaling components in vertebrate cells.  Role in disease  Mutated patched proteins have been implicated in a number of cancers including basal cell carcinoma, medulloblastoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma. Hereditary mutations in the human patched homolog PTCH1 cause autosomal dominant Gorlin syndrome, which consists of overgrowth and hereditary disposition to cancer including basal cell carcinoma and medulloblastoma. Mice with mutations in mouse PTCH1 similarly develop medulloblastoma.

Haddaway. The boat had been purchased by the Commission in 1918, decked over with a pilot house added. It was powered by a 25-horsepower Palmer engine. The Navy approached the Conservation Commission shortly after the nation's entry into World War I proposing the Commission's boats be used to maintain constant local patrols. The state legislature agreed that the boats and men of the state force would become part of the U.S. Naval Reserve providing they patrol the same districts for fisheries enforcement as well as federal interests with the benefit that patrol time would be increased and the expense for all be paid by the federal government. The Maryland State Fishery Force boats began operating under a contract in which they were under a free lease to the United States Navy in August 1917, serving as Squadron Number 8 of the 5th Naval District, patrolling their regular areas enforcing state conservation law and federal laws. They were under the command of a Conservation Commission member, George O. Haddaway, who was also a Lieutenant in the Navy and expenses, wages, supplies and repairs were paid by the federal government.A number of the boats used in conservation enforcement were private boats used for the season only. These do not seem to be involved. The boat was commissioned 1 September 1918 by the Navy as USS Severn serving until 27 November 1918 when stricken from Navy lists.Ships' Data U.S. Naval Vessels is blank in most of the information blocks including when and where built. The boat operated in the 5th Naval District, locally in the West River and Galesville, Maryland area, under the command of Chief Master at Arms George A. Haddaway, who had Severn as a Fishery Force boat prior to the war, for the remainder of the war.This operating area is on the western shore near Annapolis rather than the boat's original home waters on the Eastern Shore, isolated from the mainland at the time, thus an exception to the \\"patrolled their respective districts\\" in the reference. It is possible that Haddaway, as the boat's usual operator, was moved with the boat closer to the capital as commander of the squadron. There is also a clear discrepancy between the Maryland records and DANFS about Haddaway's rank. Maryland records have him as a Navy Lieutenant and DANFS Chief Master of Arms, a non commissioned officer rating. It is clear that Maryland considered Haddaway to be in command of the boats owned by Maryland and still enforcing state conservation law while contracted to the Navy with a dual role of enforcing federal law. The Navy returned her to the Maryland Conservation Commission on 27 November 1918. After return the boat was found to be in poor condition. It was placed out of commission and put up for sale. Severn was later traded for another boat more suitable for fisheries work.

It originally aired on December 15, 2008.  Plot  Robin enters MacLaren's wearing an unseasonal T-shirt and explains to Ted that the cold weather doesn't affect her because she's from Canada. Marshall agrees and compares New York City in winter to a spring day in Minnesota, except for all the taxis, skyscrapers and non-white people. When Robin expresses homesickness, Marshall takes her to the Walleye Saloon, a Minnesota-themed bar that he goes to when he misses his family. Unfortunately she likes it so much that she ends up pretending to be from Bemidji, Minnesota to befriend the bar patrons, much to Marshall's frustration. His frustration grows when she claims his story about the 1999 NFC Championship Game as her own and boils over after she beats his high score on the Fisherman's Quest video game, at which point he unmasks Robin as a Canadian. Before storming out, Robin goes on a tirade on how great Canada is on a personal level, bringing up the great things Canada introduced that Americans take for granted, and admits she wishes she was there right now. Marshall later apologizes to Robin and reassures her that despite her lack of job or boyfriend, she still belongs in New York with her friends. To help ease her Christmas homesickness he takes her to a Canadian-themed bar, the Hoser Hut, capped off with a crowd-pleasing karaoke rendition of Robin's teenage hit \\"Let's Go to the Mall\\", much to her embarrassment. Meanwhile, Ted reveals that his sister Heather (Erin Cahill) has arrived in New York and is planning to move there. According to Ted, Heather is irresponsible, citing examples such as the time she sold his possessions to buy tickets and travel to a Nine Inch Nails concert in Spain, and he doubts that she will ever actually move there. Additionally, Ted has prevented Barney from meeting Heather each time she has visited, fearing that Barney would try to hook up with her. However, his attempt to prevent their meeting again is immediately foiled when Barney is found waiting for the group at the apartment after Lily, being unable to keep secrets, accidentally tipped him off that Ted was planning to bring Heather there. Barney is hurt that Ted tried to keep him away from Heather and explains that he never intended to act on all the inappropriate jokes he made. Ted explains that he does not trust Heather or Barney, though he eventually relents and invites Barney to dinner with them on Sunday. Over dinner, Heather and Ted discuss her decision to move to New York to work in finance and she asks him to co-sign the lease of an apartment she found. However, his lack of faith in her proves an obstacle. Frustrated with Ted's insensitivity, Heather and Barney stage a fake sexual encounter after their interview at Goliath National Bank and ensure that Lily walks in on them, knowing that she won't be able to keep it a secret from Ted. Heather and Barney persist in taunting Ted until he confronts them at MacLaren's, claiming that Heather has never taken responsibility for herself. Barney explains the plan to the surprised Ted and Lily, at the same time revealing that he kissed Ted's mother. Heather storms out to find a hotel, denouncing Ted for refusing to accept that she has grown up. Eventually Ted makes up with Heather and co-signs her lease, telling her he wants to get to know the new her.  Critical response  Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club rated the episode with a grade B−. Michelle Zoromski of IGN gave the episode 9.8 out of 10, saying Barney steals the show once again.

The Hanover Bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 for having local significance in the themes of engineering and transportation. It was nominated as a well- preserved example of a bridge type once common in Wright County. Construction The Hanover Bridge was built in 1885 by the Morse Bridge Company of Youngstown, Ohio. The company later changed its name to the Youngstown Bridge Company, and merged into the American Bridge Company in 1900. The Hanover Bridge is long, with a roadbed and a vertical clearance. Its wooden deck was replaced in 1965 in a style similar to the original. Weight limitations The bridge carried traffic until December 1966, although its weight limit was rather low. Children riding school buses to school would have to get off on one side and walk across the bridge, and then the bus would slowly drive across and pick up the students on the other side. Although the bridge was later replaced by a modern concrete structure to the west, the old bridge is in use as a pedestrian bridge. Hanover citizens renovated the bridge in the 1980s.

Biography Aya Korem was born in Nazareth Ilit and spent her childhood there. After she graduated high school, she served as a tank instructor at the IDF's Armored Corps. Since childhood Korem has been singing and performing, playing the guitar and the piano. Between 2001 and 2004, she studied Songwriting, Composition and Performance at the Rimon School of Jazz and Contemporary Music in Ramat HaSharon, a school that gave birth to many Israeli singers such as Noa and Aviv Geffen. She was part of the \\"magic class\\", studying together with Miri Mesika, Keren Peles, Ohad Hitman and Eric Berman that went on to be popular singers. She enrolled in the music college just to \\"pass some time\\" until she decided what she really wanted to study, but ended up having a successful music career. She dreamed of being an architect, and one of her temporary jobs was cake baking at a bakery. Aya Korem lives in Tel Aviv. Music career Korem started her music career as a songwriter. Her first public exposure was the song Ata af Pa'am (אתה אף פעם, \\"You Will Never\\"), released in the first album of Miri Mesika in April 2005 and a theme song she wrote and performed for a TV show called \\"Hama'arehet\\". Only after receiving compliments for her voice did she decide to also become a singer and started working on her own album. In 2006 Korem released her debut album, Aya Korem. It was produced by Ori Zakh, a close friend and Miri Mesika's husband, a Rimon graduate who also produced both Miri Mesika's albums and Ohad Hitman's first album. The work on the album's songs began already during Aya's studies. In February 2006 the first single was released, Kayitz (קיץ, \\"Summer\\")—a song of hope for a lover that would come one day \\"like summer\\". The second single from the album, Shir Ahava Pashut (שיר אהבה פשוט, \\"Simple Love Song\\") was released in March 2006, reached No. 1 on the Reshet Gimel chart and came 4th in the Song of the Year competition. Later came Klipa (קליפה, \\"Peel\\"), Yonatan Shapira (יונתן שפירא), BeSof HaLayla (בסוף הלילה, \\"In the end of the night\\"), Ata Zorem Etzli BaDam (אתה זורם אצלי בדם, \\"You Are Flowing in My Blood\\") and HaShir shel Itay (השיר של איתי, \\"Itay's Song\\"). The album features mostly songs written by Korem herself. \\"Yonatan Shapira\\", which Korem wrote as an assignment to write a song about a job announcement, is a humorous love song for a pilot Aya met during her studies in Rimon, one of the signers of the pilots' letter. According to Aya Korem, Yonatan Shapira was not pleased with the song, but living abroad, did not suffer much from the consequences. Korem received the Golden Album award, which was presented to her on her 27th birthday party. The album sold about 30,000 copies. Korem recorded videos for some of the songs and went on a 1.5-year performance tour. At the beginning she performed with a band, but after taking part in a piano festival in the end of 2006, she switched to more intimate gigs, performing with a piano and a cello only. Having yet about 70 songs unpublished, Aya Korem released her second album, Safa Zara (שפה זרה, \\"Foreign Language\\"), on 28 February 2008. The album included songs she wrote at the age of 26–27 and has jazz, cabaret and country influences. The lyrics deal with a wider range of subjects than those of the first album. The first single, HaSof shel HaSipur (הסוף של הסיפור, \\"The End of the Story\\"), is a sad love song co- written by Aya Korem and Eric Berman. The single was released in December 2007. In February 2008 Al Ta'amini (אל תאמיני, \\"Do Not Believe\\") was released. The lyrics of Al Ta'amini talk about the fleeting condition of a celebrity in the popular culture. \\"And then somebody will say: 'your time is over, and now let someone else take the stage'\\", wrote Korem. The song was inspired by Janis Ian's song Stars, which is even credited in the liner notes of the album.Liner notes of the album Safa Zara, Anana LTD, 2008 Two more songs from this album have been released as singles: Otobiografia (אוטוביוגרפיה, \\"Autobiography\\") and Akhshav Kazot (עכשיו כזאת, \\"Now like This\\"). The lyrics of Zahav Shahor (זהב שחור, \\"Black Gold\\") are a female answer to the classic song Atur Mitzkhekh written by Yoni Rechter. Korem's producer Ori Zakh sent Aya's lyrics to Rechter, and Rechter agreed to write music for the song. In 2009 Aya Korem also recorded the original song Atur Mitzkhekh for the 70th birthday of its original singer, Arik Einstein. The song Tania (טניה) is inspired by Louis- Ferdinand Céline's novel Journey to the End of the Night. Most of the songs are written by Korem herself also in her second album. The exceptions are Ruhot HaMa'arav (רוחות המערב, \\"Western Winds\\") by Yonatan Gutfeld, Akhshav Kazot with music by Ilay Botner, \\"HaSof shel HaSipur\\" and \\"Zahav Shahor\\". Both albums were recorded with the Anana label of the Hed Arzi Music corporation. In 2008 Korem recorded a cover for Eran Tzur's song Erev Bet Kislev (ערב ב' כסלו, \\"The 2nd of Kislev Eve\\") for the Hebrew Labor 2 collection of cover versions dedicated to the 60th anniversary of Israeli independence. Korem also musically produced the song. She also performed three of her songs for the Pizmon Hozer project, dedicated to the birthday of Gilad Shalit, a captured Israeli soldier, and organized by the NRG website operated by Ma'ariv. After the release of Safa Zara she introduced a political protest song, \\"Ha'Isha im HaSakit\\" (האישה עם השקית, \\"The Woman with the Bag\\"). Korem wrote songs for other artists, such as Miri Mesika and Nurit Galron, produced an all-female tribute to Kaveret, starred in a version of The King and I and hosted, for two seasons, together with Danny Robas, a TV show, called \\"Israeli Duet\\", where the two hosted and performed with some of Israel's best musicians. On 30 June 2011, Korem released her third album, Lealef et HaSusim (לאלף את הסוסים, \\"Taming the Horses\\"). After walking out on her former label, Korem produced it by herself and published a detailed guide on her blog about how to become an independent artist. This album, produced by Gil Lewis and Tomer Lenzinger, included the songs \\"Shesh ve'Esrim\\" (Six-and-twenty), \\"Rona Omeret\\" (Rona Says) and a cover of Ahuva Ozeri's song \\"Tziltzuley Pa'amonim\\"(Bells Ringing). In 2013, she published her song Mehandes Machshevim (מהנדסת מחשבים; \\"Computer Engineer\\") in Hebrew and Perl on the web.http://developers.slashdot.org/story/13/05/09/1235250/israeli-singer- publishes-a-song-in-hebrew-and-perl Aya Korem bill In 2013, while in a long dispute with her label, Korem initiated a bill aimed to protect the rights of musicians in the industry, limiting talent contracts to a maximum of seven years, and lead a group of artists to promote the bill, earning it the name \\"The Aya Korem bill\\". The bill was issued at the Nineteenth Knesset by parliament members Dov Khenin and Amram Mitzna, passed the first reading in 2014, and later passed the second and third reading at the Twentieth Knesset. In February 2017 the bill passed and was entered into the book of laws in Israel. In January 2015, Korem was released from her contract with Anana, after a legal battle that reached the Supreme court. This victory has paved the way for other artists who were bound by their contracts. 24 hours later she released her fourth album, Halev Haze, Hameshumash (הלב הזה, המשומש, \\"This used heart\\"), free to download. Awards and recognition In September 2016 she released her fifth album, 2023, a dystopic futuristic concept album loosely based on her legal struggle. The album featured prominent artists including Arkadi Duchin, Yishai Levi, Rona Kenan, Mazzie Cohen, Lea Shabat, Nechi Nech, Dani Litani, Efrat Gosh and more. Korem sings only the closing track of the album, Ish Tovea (איש טובע, \\"Drowning man\\"). In June 2017 the album received the Acum Award.

It is located immediately north of the village of Lytton, which is situated at the confluence of the Thompson and Fraser Rivers. Access and fire lookout Fraser & Thompson Rivers showing the mixing of the two different coloured waters. Botanie Mountain right background, Lillooet Ranges at left. A fire lookout stands atop a peak approximately to the south (elevation ) which is owned and maintained by the local wireless society for TV, radio, and digital transmission. The current view from the lookout can be seen via a live webcam. The lookout is accessible by two very rough 4x4 roads which approach from either end of the mountain, which is somewhat ridge-like, on a north-south axis. The roads have been decommissioned and are no longer driveable above a certain elevation. The summit is one of the highest on the east flank of the Fraser Canyon and enjoys views over the Scarped Range and Thompson Plateau to the east and southeast, across the Thompson River's lower canyon, the Clear Range to the north and northwest, the Cascade Mountains to the south, and west across the Fraser to the Lillooet Ranges. Name The older spelling \\"Boothanie\\" is suggestive of the proper pronunciation of the mountain's name, i.e. it is unlike the English word \\"botany\\" and has been \\"phonetically\\" spelled as Boo-TAW-ny. In the language of the Thompson or Nlaka'pamux people, it means \\"covered\\", \\"covering\\" or \\"blanketed all over\\", which is thought to be a reference to its shroud of cloud or fog in times of bad weather, or else a reference to the abundant plant cover in the area. The Botanie Valley, which is formed by Botanie Creek on its east flank and runs south from Botanie Lake, is an important food-plant gathering area for the Nlaka'pamux. A publication of the Geological Survey of Canada, Summary Report from 1894, asserts the name-origin (p. 402B) to the Shuswap language of the Secwepemc people, meaning \\"perpetual root place\\". Secwepemc territory today begins in the basin of Hat Creek, which lies on the \\"inside\\" of the Clear Range to the northwest of Botanie Mountain. The mountain is, however, decidedly in Nlaka'pamux territory.

He served as the head coach at the University of Tennessee at Martin from 1975 to 1977 and at Vanderbilt University from 1979 to 1985, compiling a career college football record of 43–66–1. At Vanderbilt in 1982, he won the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award. Biography MacIntyre was born in St. Petersburg, Florida, and graduated from Andrew Jackson High School in Jacksonville, Florida, in 1957 and played quarterback on the school football team. He then was quarterback at the University of Miami for the 1958 season. MacIntyre sat out the 1957 season due to a broken wrist and served as a backup to All-America quarterback Fran Curci in 1958 and 1959 and to Eddie Johns in 1960. For the 1960 season, MacIntyre also was the holder for field goals. In Miami's final game of 1960, against Air Force, MacIntyre successfully threw a touchdown pass as part of a fake field goal. This play contributed to Miami's 23–14 victory and earned MacIntyre the nickname \\"The Finger\\". After graduating from Miami, MacIntyre became an assistant football coach at Terry Parker High School in Jacksonville in 1961 and 1963 and served in the military in 1962. In 1964, MacIntyre became a football recruiting administrator at the University of Miami. He would stay at Miami until 1967 and would join the University of Tampa football coaching staff as defensive coordinator in 1968. From 1970 to 1972, MacIntyre was the defensive backs coach at Clemson and then was assistant coach for Vanderbilt from 1973 to 1974. The 1974 Peach Bowl between Vanderbilt and Texas Tech ended with a 6–6 tie. MacIntyre took his first head coaching position in 1975 with Tennessee–Martin and remained head coach until 1977. In three seasons, MacIntyre had an overall 18–14 record, with a 2–8 record in 1975 and 8–3 records in both 1976 and 1977. In 1978, MacIntyre was offensive coordinator for Ole Miss (the University of Mississippi). MacIntyre again became a head coach in 1979, this time with Vanderbilt, having previously been an assistant coach for Vanderbilt from 1973 to 1974. Following three losing seasons (1–10 in 1979, 2–9 in 1980, and 4–7 in 1981), Vanderbilt went 8–4 in 1982 and earned a berth in the Hall of Fame Classic. This would be Vanderbilt's only winning season with MacIntyre as coach, and MacIntyre had an overall 25–52–1 record as Vanderbilt head coach from 1979 to 1985. After the 1985 season, MacIntyre resigned from Vanderbilt, blaming the \\"continuing rise in academic standards, both in admissions and in the retaining of student athletes\\" for Vanderbilt's losing seasons. After leaving Vanderbilt, MacIntyre led a company that provided summer sales employment to college athletes until 1991, when he became head football coach and interim headmaster of Donelson Christian Academy in Nashville, the city where Vanderbilt is located. MacIntyre returned to Jacksonville in 1993 as the head coach at the Episcopal School of Jacksonville and worked his final coaching position as running backs coach at Liberty University. In 1999, MacIntyre retired from coaching after being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.Solano, Javier, and Williams, Charean. \\"Football capsules: Jacksonville Episcopal at Taylor\\".

The capital was divided into 3,000 shares of 100 gulden each. Railway line and operations The company received a royal concession on 18 February 1865 to build a line operated by standard gauge locomotives for passenger and goods services between Plattling Ostbahn station and Fischerdorf on the right bank of the Danube opposite Deggendorf. Early plans to operate a horse-drawn wagonway were dropped, but they then had to accept that the end of the line would be on the right bank, because the bridge over the Danube, built in 1859, was too weak to take locomotives. The line ran from the station at Plattling, opened in 1860 by the Bavarian Eastern Railway Company (AG der Bayerischen Ostbahnen) without any large structures, as far as the Danube landing place opposite Deggendorf and had a length of 8,695 m. It was opened on 8 March 1866; operations having already started on 1 March. In 1867 four pairs of trains ran daily between 6 am and 10 pm. Although the line was able to pay a dividend of 6% in the early years, they let the Ostbahn take over operations on 10 August 1867. On 6 September 1872 a contract was signed transferring the Deggendorf–Plattling Railway in entirety to the Ostbahn for a purchase price of 273,000 gulden. Running and rolling stock The company owned two locomotives, four passenger coaches, a mail van and several goods wagons. The light locomotives were 0-4-0 inside frame engines built by the firm of Joseph Anton von Maffei of Munich, with an axle base of only 1.835 m. They were given the names Deggendorf (Maffei 1866/575) and Bayerischer Wald (Maffei 1866/576) and needed 24 minutes to complete the journey. The engines were given numbers D 13 and D 14 by the Ostbahn. The Royal Bavarian State Railways incorporated them into Class D with numbers 1176 and 1177. They were retired in December and October 1895. Previous to that, the Deggendorf had hauled shuttle services between Geiselhöring and Sünching on the Regensburg–Passau railway; the Bayerwald had been diverted to the line from Miltenberg to Amorbach. Closure On the construction of the Bavarian Forest railway from Plattling via Deggendorf and Zwiesel to Bayerisch Eisenstein in 1873, the roadbed of the Deggendorf–Plattling line could not be used, because the new railway line had to be laid northwest of the old route due to the steep inclines near the edge of the Bavarian Forest and this required a higher station at Deggendorf. In addition the Ostbahn moved the station at Plattling some several hundred metres further west. As a result, the Deggendorf–Plattling Railway ceased running services on 16 September 1877 on the opening of the Forest railway by the Royal Bavarian State Railways which had taken over the Ostbahn on 15 May 1875.

Designed by Edward Gregory Waters and built in 1912, the Centre was home to a David Jones department store and a prominent toy shop. It is also known as Boland's Building and Boland's Departmental Store. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 7 April 2006.  History  The Bolands Centre, a large reinforced concrete former department store, was erected in 1912-1913 for Michael Boland, an Irish immigrant who migrated to Australia in 1881 and became a leading merchant in Cairns. The building was designed by the Cairns architect Edward Gregory Waters, and for many years was the tallest structure in the city. It is the last surviving example of a large, early 20th century department store in Cairns. Michael Boland was born in 1863 in Ireland. He came from an impoverished rural background but at the age of fifteen moved to Dublin to study business for a year. Around 1879 he emigrated to Australia, initially lodging in Melbourne, then moving briefly to Queanbeyan, New South Wales, where he gained practical experience as a grocer in his uncle's store. He then travelled north, arriving in Cairns in 1882, where he bought a small allotment in Lilly Street. Between 1882 and 1887 he became involved in a number of economic ventures within the Cairns district. These included a contract to clear Spence and Bunda Streets in Cairns in 1886, and in 1888 establishing the Camp Oven Creek Hotel at Barron Gorge during the building of the Cairns-to- Herberton railway line. He also held a selection on the Russell River, north of Innisfail, and was reputed to have spent time tin-mining at Bloomfield and working on the construction of the Cape York telegraph line. From these ventures he accumulated sufficient capital to return to Cairns by 1890 and establish a modest grocery shop in leased wooden premises in Abbott Street, which was the initial commercial centre of Cairns. In 1893 Michael Boland, like many people at the time, struggled to keep his business viable in the face of a world recession and the temporary closure of the National Bank of Queensland. Conditions were made more difficult in Cairns by the onset of the so-called \\"store wars\\", an intense competitive struggle between five key merchant firms: Michael Boland, Burns Philp & Co., G.R. Mayers & Co. and two newly opened co-operatives, the Co-operative Cash Stores and the Cairns Co- operative Store Co. Michael Boland's business survived these difficulties and in 1898 shifted to a allotment in Section 4, at the northeast corner of Lake and Spence Streets. As the Cairns grew, businesses moved from Abbott Street to adjoining streets, and in particular to Section 4, which was later referred to as \\"The Golden Block\\" due to its high concentration of prominent firms. Boland was among the first merchants to make this transition. In Spence Street, on the eastern portion of this land, Michael Boland built a single-storied timber shop which he ran as a general store. Boland also constructed three smaller, adjoining shops that he leased out to various small businesses. The western section of the allotment, which fronted Lake and Spence Streets, consisted of a sand ridge and low-lying swamp, and remained vacant. By 1901 Boland had acquired an adjoining property fronting Lake Street, which contained three shops. Further down Lake Street, Michael Boland's brother, John, established a co-operative grocery and general store. From these small beginnings Michael Boland gradually emerged as a pioneer of commerce in Cairns and built up an extensive business empire, which included investments in mining and the Cumming Brothers Butchery. His firm was among the biggest importers and retailers in Far North Queensland, dealing with an extensive range of goods, many sourced directly from overseas manufacturers. The contribution of the firm to the prosperity of Cairns and its district was considerable. Until the link to the state railway system was made in the early 1920s, Cairns remained a relatively isolated community accessed primarily by sea, and the Boland firm was instrumental in satisfying many of its material needs. It was also a major employer while its lines of credit allowed many early sugar growers to survive the hard years of this industry's infancy. Michael Boland was among the most prominent citizens of Cairns. He was elected to the Cairns Municipal Council in 1896 and was briefly appointed a director of the local Penny Savings Bank in 1899. He was a high-profile supporter of worker's rights, the Labour Party and early unionism, and also had some association with the local Chinese community, in 1904 giving money to help effect repairs to one of the temples and acting as the receiver for the firm of Sun Shun Lee during its liquidation. Among Michael Boland's most significant roles was his association with the Cairns Harbour Board. In 1899 Boland, with his friend and fellow merchant, Callaghan Walsh, began publicly agitating for the formation of a Harbour Board. They saw this as essential for the growth of trade in Cairns, but faced strong opposition, in particular from one of Boland's fiercest commercial rivals, A.J. Draper, who argued that such a move was premature for the community resources at the time. Following heated public debate, Boland and his faction were successful in establishing the Provisional Harbour Board in 1899, but it took six years of further lobbying before the Cairns Harbour Board was constituted on 20 December 1905. It had its first meeting on 28 February 1906. The Board consisted of 9 members, two representing the Town of Cairns, and 7 representing outlying regions. Both Boland and Walsh were elected as the members for Cairns, and in 1909 Boland was elected chairman. Over the ensuing years the Harbour Board played a critical role in developing Cairns into a major port in North Queensland by improving wharf facilities and implementing the dredging of the harbour to allow deepwater birthing. In 1902 Boland's business had grown sufficiently to warrant major improvements to his existing premises and construction of a spacious single-storied concrete shop fronting Spence Street, the first large concrete building erected in Cairns. The construction of this store necessitated the partial demolition of the original wooden shop. The new building carried an ornate facade with pediment and parapet, and a bullnose verandah. The verandah had paired columns with decorative brackets, and a frieze of rectangular fretwork. When completed the upgrade permitted Boland to begin the process of transforming his business from a simple general store into a large emporium with separate grocery, haberdashery and hardware departments. Department stores represented a new approach to retailing and were becoming prominent in all of Queensland's main centres and represented a new approach to retailing. The traditional retail business that had dominated Queensland's 19th century retail landscape was centred on a relatively narrow range of products and activities, and in its design and layout gave little consideration to consumer psychology. The department store, however, offered an extensive range of goods and services and created for the consumer an encompassing retail environment that was enjoyable and encouraged shopping. By 1909 Michael Boland's department store had proved successful and he expanded his business into his adjacent three Lake Street stores, displacing the earlier tenants. Then in 1911 he commissioned Cairns architect Edward Gregory Waters to draw up plans for a new building to be built on the site of the swamp at the vacant corner of Lake and Spence Streets. Waters, who had previously worked in Rockhampton, Mount Morgan and Gympie, was active in Cairns from 1909 until 1917. While in Cairns he worked as the Cairns Harbour Board Engineer. He was a specialist in ferro- concrete construction and was responsible for a number of prominent buildings in Cairns, including the Central Hotel and St. Josephs Convent. The plans for Michael Boland's new building were approved by the Cairns Town Engineer in May 1912 and JT Bullock was awarded the contract for the construction. Reflecting Boland's increasing wealth and social status, the building was to be an impressive structure of reinforced concrete, the first three-storeyed building in Cairns. Although Boland had pioneered all-concrete construction methods in his 1902 building, in 1912 Cairns was still a town of timber, brick and corrugated iron and the use of concrete for the new building was still a comparatively early use of reinforced concrete in Queensland. Due to its strength and insulating qualities, concrete construction proved highly suitable to the tropical climate and cyclonic conditions experienced in North Queensland and in later decades dominated its building industry. Bolands situated on the corner of Lake and Spence Streets, Cairns, 1925 The construction work, carried out during 1912 and 1913, was a major undertaking that elicited interest from the local press. The swamp at the site was drained and filled but due to the unstable nature of the ground the building sat on a floating foundation laid with girders rather than traditional piles. The walls, floors, internal columns and decorative details of the facade were cast in moulds. The Portland cement used for the building was imported in casks from England and poured using an innovative concrete roller mixer with an independent hoist system. An English firm, Dorman, Long and Co., who later supplied steel for the Sydney Harbour Bridge, prefabricated the steel work for the building. The building was rectangular in plan, and when completed measured , with the long axis oriented along Spence Street. The remaining section of the early wooden store had been demolished and the new building was connected internally to the 1902 store. It also had entrances on both Spence and Lake streets. The bullnose corrugated iron awning of the 1902 emporium was extended along both street frontages of the new building and repeated the earlier paired columns, pierced frieze and other decorative elements. At ground level the Lake and Spence Street facade carried large, rectangular shop windows of clear plate-glass imported from England. On the first and second floor levels the facade was executed in an imposing, ornate style, based predominantly on Classical and Romanesque elements. On the upper storeys the fenestration consisted of a combination of fixed and top-hung sash windows, with a single round window incorporated into the facade at the Lake and Spence Street corner at the second floor level. Immediately above the awning there was also a series of narrow, rectangular, bottom-hinged windows. Early photographs suggest the upper storey windows were filled with opaque glass. The rear (north and east) walls of the building were unornamented and pierced by rectangular, double-hung, four-pane sash windows. Early photographs indicate that the building was painted in light, neutral colours with the name 'Boland's' picked out in darker colour under the parapet and on the east wall. The north wall carried the line \\"Boland's Departmental Store\\". The roof of the building was flat and of poured concrete construction, and as such was the first known example of this type of roof in Cairns, and among the earliest in Queensland. It was waterproofed by a layer of bitumen and drained by five openings on the parapet on the north side, which connected to two down-pipes. This space was accessible to the public and was referred to as the \\"plateau\\" in Waters' design proposal, and as the \\"roof garden\\" by staff members. During World War I musicians used it as a stage for patriotic performances. Along the Spence and Lake Street sides the roof was protected by an ornamented parapet incorporating finials, arches, and balustrades of interlocked concrete circles. The building was installed with an electric passenger elevator, the first to be included in any building in Cairns, and among the earliest examples of this technology in North Queensland. The motor and control unit were housed on the roof in a centrally located square tower with a lower wing projecting from the west side. Waters' design called for a two-tier, ogee- style roof but it is unclear whether this was ever built, and from at least the 1920s the elevator tower had a shallow, hipped roof. The interior of the building was open plan, with the floors and roof being supported by iron girders and large internal columns of reinforced concrete. The floors, like the roof, were of concrete slab construction, and also early examples of their type in Queensland. A well hole passing through the centre of the first and second floors helped conduct air and light through the building. The upper floors were accessed by wooden stairs as well as the electric lift. The building was completed in time for the 1913 Christmas trade, with the shop windows carrying brilliant displays of electroplated Birmingham silverware. The new building marked the development of Michael Boland's business into one of the first modern department stores in North Queensland. It allowed the further organisation and growth of separate departments providing customers with an extensive choice of goods and services. The firm was able to cater not only to the local trade but also to visitors from all over the vast hinterland for which Cairns was the centre. The building also gained recognition as a city icon, and the intersection of Lake and Spence Street became known as Boland's Corner. Physically, through its height, mass and striking style, the building dominated the streetscape. The ongoing success of firm was marked in 1915 when the Articles of Association of Bolands Limited were filed at the office of the Register of Joint Stock Companies and a branch store in Babinda was opened. In 1923, however, the firm suffered the loss of Michael Boland, who died of a heart condition in 1923. Control of the department store passed to his three sons: Thomas, William and James. Thomas assumed the position of head manager while the other brothers acted as departmental managers. Under their direction the firm continued to grow and by Cairns' jubilee in 1926 the store at Spence and Lake Streets boasted 15 departments and buying offices in London, New York, Kobe and all the Australian states. During this period Thomas Boland initiated a number of cosmetic and functional alterations to the store, among the first being painting out the \\"Departmental Store\\" sign on the northern face, and installing a freight lift shaft, which could be seen as an extra tower on the northeast corner of the building's roof. In 1929 extensive remodelling of the interior was undertaken. The architect responsible was E.H. Boden, and G.A. Stronach was the builder. New shop fronts incorporating polished stone veneer and large square shop windows were also installed by Burns, Johnsson and Humphreys. The total cost of the renovations was estimated at . Other changes included the installation of electricity at the end of the 1920s, and during the 1930s the awning frieze was changed from fretwork to a solid panel carrying the Boland name, and the balustrade on the parapet was converted into a solid wall. Another important change occurred in 1936/37 when, as part of the firm's 75th anniversary celebrations, the store was extended to the east onto part of an adjacent allotment. This new two-storey wing, designed by VM Brown and constructed by WC Kyanastan, was also constructed in reinforced concrete. It was wide and deep. It possessed a concrete first floor with a large central well hole, large plate-glass windows and a roof of wood and iron. The facade incorporated lineal motifs, large rosettes and starburst medallions, and three glass doors opening onto small concrete balconies with ornamental iron railings. Along the street frontage there was a cantilevered awning. During World War II the Bolands firm felt the effects of disrupted shipping and the rationing of goods. During this period the first floor of the east wing of the store was occupied by the American Navy. In the post-war period the firm experienced a resurgence trade and prosperity. During the 1950s new furniture and toy departments and a mezzanine floor were installed in the three-story building. Sometime after 1950 the original awning was replaced by a flat, cantilevered awning. In 1962 the 1902 store was demolished and replaced by a new building and the frontages and fittings of the other buildings were updated. By this date Bolands Ltd was the largest department store in Cairns, employing 100 staff. At various times the store was damaged by natural elements. Until the Cairns City Council put in new drainage, the Lake and Spence Street corner was subject to flooding in the wet season, and in the 1930s and 1955 the ground floor was inundated. In 1924 three large windows on the Spence Street side of the main store building were mysteriously smashed, reputedly by lightning, and in 1951 a fire broke out on the top floor, damaging the ceiling and wooden partitions. As it aged, the roof also began to leak badly, and was eventually covered with Colorbond sheeting. Thomas Boland retired in 1963 and the directors of the firm sold their shareholding to the Sydney-based firm of David Jones Ltd. David Jones appointed Thomas's son, Terry, as manager of the store. In 1967 David Jones installed a cafeteria, milk bar and small goods section on the ground floor and the largest chilled water air-conditioning plant in North Queensland. David Jones gradually replaced the Bolands logo in the newspaper advertising but never removed the Boland name from the building. Title to the Spence/Lake Street corner block was transferred to David Jones in 1979 but the firm's occupation of the site ceased in 1984 when it relocated to new premises at Earlville. During the 1970s and early 1980s the Bolands Building had steadily become redundant as the Cairns central business district, along with other Australian centres, suffered the effects of a nationwide drift of retailing activity to the suburbs. Soon after the departure of David Jones the building was acquired by the Kern Brothers Corporation, which significantly remodelled it at a cost of $2,000,000. Aware of the building's iconic status, the new owners retained the first and second floor facades, and the open-plan interior of the second floor. The lower levels were converted into individual shops on the ground floor and offices on the first floor. Other internal changes included the installation of false ceilings, the removal of the old internal staircases, and the closure of the passenger elevator. Externally, the ground street shop frontages were remodelled in an imitation Victorian period style. New windows and facades carried arched decorative panels, and the awning was fitted with non-structural, reproduction Classical columns and cast-metal friezes. A third entrance was created at the Lake and Spence Street corner. The entire building was repainted externally with a special paint selected to minimise future deterioration. The building re-opened as the Bolands Centre in May 1985 with considerable fanfare. The redevelopment was lauded as a landmark example of adaptive re-use of an historic building and emerged as a key event that stimulated the revival of the Cairns central business district during the late 1980s and 1990s. In 1987 the Prettejohn family bought the building and since 1991 it has been managed by Pearce Coleman & Associates. The last major changes to its fabric occurred in 1999 when the north and east faces of the three-storied building were clad in COLORBOND which blocked all window openings on these elevations. Around this time the ground floor shop fronts were once again remodelled.  Description  Boland Building in Cairns The Bolands Centre comprises a three-storey concrete building (Building A), erected in 1912/1913 on the corner of Lake and Spence Streets, and a 1960s single storey building (Building B) of brick and COLORBOND sheeting on Spence Street. The latter is not considered to be of cultural heritage significance. Historically the centre has been associated with a number of other buildings on adjoining allotments that together formed an extensive department store established by the Cairns merchant, Michael Boland. = Building A = Above the street level the exterior of Building A is executed in a grandiose, ornate style employing an eclectic mix of Classical and Romanesque design elements. The facade is asymmetrical, with the top two stories tied together by a blind arcade incorporating Romanesque arches with exaggerated keystones and pilasters surmounted by composite capitals. The facade also incorporates horizontally arranged panels of relief-moulded interlocked circles at the juncture of the ground and first floor, similar panels of relief-moulded arches at the juncture of the first and second floor, and the Boland's name in prominent relief lettering beneath the parapet. The facade is painted in cream with some details picked out in dark green. The rear of the building is clad in yellow COLORBOND sheeting. On the first floor facade the fenestration consists of pairs of arched windows, contained within arched recesses, alternating with rectangular windows arranged singly or in groups of two or four. Transoms divide these windows horizontally into three sections. The majority are filled with modern clear glass or glass louvers, but in the semi- circular transom lights of the arched windows early, opaque, textured glass is retained. The Lake and Spence Street corner of the building is pierced by a single rectangular window which is blocked out with a panel that supports an illuminated sign reading: \\"Bolands Centre\\". On the second floor level the fenestration is dominated by triple arched windows and large, arched windows divided by three thick, radiating concrete mullions. A large, round window also perforates the facade at the Lake and Spence Street corner. All the windows at this level are filled with modern, clear glass set in aluminium frames. The street level shop fronts have green marble facing and modern, rectangular glass shop windows. The awning is a flat-roofed cantilevered type supported above by tubular metal braces fixed to the facade, and incorporating non-structural; singly arranged, fluted, iron columns ornamented with Corinthian capitals and cast-iron fringe. The footpath is of concrete and clay brick pavers. The building's roof is flat and sheeted with modern Colorbond iron. It is surrounded on the south and west sides by an ornamented parapet incorporating finials and arches, and on the north and east sides by a plain parapet. Below the ornamented parapet runs an eave supported by closely spaced corbels. Projecting from the roof is a centrally located elevator house comprising a square-based tower and projecting wing, and a tower for the freight elevator shaft on the northeast corner. Internally the building consists of series of shops of various sizes on the ground floor and business offices on the first floor. The main entrance foyer on Spence Street still retains early black and white floor tiling and has some white-painted wood arching, elaborate plaster cornices and ceiling mouldings. Above the suspended ceiling of the first floor there are still substantial remains of the original ceiling, including decorative, pressed metal panels and scrolled concrete capitals associated with some of the internal columns. The second floor, which cannot be accessed by the public, retains its original open plan. The ceiling consists of permanent formwork of curved corrugated iron sheets resting on exposed iron beams. These are supported by thick, plain, squared columns. The floor is concrete and shows traces of previous rubberised coverings and red paint. A walk-in Chubb safe room with an external wooden bench stand against the eastern wall. The centre of the floor is pieced by a square well hole surrounded by an intact silkyoak balustrade constructed in an angular style with pinnacled newell-posts. The view through the well hole to the ground floor is now blocked by the suspended ceiling of the first floor. The original staircase connecting the second and the first floor has been replaced by a metal ladder. The staircase was originally attached to the northern wall, near the goods lift shaft. A partial outline of the staircase in the paintwork on the wall indicates it was constructed in a style matching the balustrade of the well hole. The paintwork on the internal walls of the second floor, which is peeling extensively, shows a range of colour layers, including light yellow, light blue and white. The windows in the rear walls have silkyoak architraves and most are double-hung, four-pane sashes glazed with opaque hexagonal wired glass. A number of these windows have had the lower sash permanently raised, with the opening filled with metal- framed glass louvers, while a small number have had their panes entirely replaced by glass louvers. The electric passenger elevator car and associated shaft and machinery remain in situ. The elevator car is constructed of dark-stained English oak. On the second floor and in the elevator house there is a lift shaft enclosure with panelling, doors and decorative frieze of dark-stained English oak. The elevator house is accessed by a wooden staircase that runs up the side of the second floor lift well enclosure. The intact motor and control unit are intact and sit within the roof space of the elevator house, which is accessed by an iron ladder leading to a hatchway. The windows within the electric elevator house are double-hung and glazed with hexagonal wired glass. The bottom sashes are single paned, while the top sashes are triple paned. The freight lift shaft is still visible on the second floor but the mechanism has been removed. There are, however, the remains of the attachment system evident in the roof space. = Building B = The adjoining Building B is a single storey Besser- brick and iron structure. At street level it shares the same awning, green marble facing and window style as Building A. Above the awning the facade is covered in cream-painted COLORBOND iron. Internally the building is subdivided into modern retail outlets. Due to its late construction and extensive internal modifications it is of relatively low cultural heritage value.  Heritage listing  Bolands Centre was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 7 April 2006 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Bolands Centre, constructed in 1912/13, is significant as it demonstrates the growth of Cairns as a centre of commerce in Queensland, and the evolution of Queensland's retail industry. The building was erected to house a large department store during the early twentieth century, a period of strong economic growth in Cairns, and a time when department stores, offering a wide range of goods and services, were being established in Queensland. During the 1980s the Bolands Centre was remodelled and led the rejuvenation of the Cairns central business district following a national drift of retail business from town centres to the suburbs. The place is significant because of the inclusion of a number of innovative ideas. In its scale and striking design the building represented a creative achievement for Cairns at the time. The construction process was a major undertaking and required some technical innovation. The building was one of the earliest large commercial structures in Far North Queensland to be entirely constructed of concrete, a practice that would later become common due to the capacity of concrete to cope with the tropical climate and cyclones. The structure was also the first large building in Cairns, and among the earliest in Far North Queensland, to incorporate an electric passenger elevator. When it was completed the Bolands Centre was to be among the first modern department stores in Far North Queensland. In later years it continued to incorporate new technologies and ideas. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The Bolands Centre is a rare surviving Far North Queensland example of a large, pre-World War I department store. Department stores were established in Brisbane and the main provincial centres of Queensland, including Cairns, but the Bolands Centre is the only extant example in Far North Queensland. Although remodelled on its lower floors, its facade remains intact, elements of the original ceilings survive, and the top floor, with associated elevator machinery, has remained undeveloped. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The Bolands Centre is important in demonstrating the principle characteristics of large department stores of the pre-World War I period. Its size and ornate detailing reflect the social aspirations and entrepreneurial strategies of the business elite who built such stores, while the surviving internal elements, particularly the undeveloped top floor and elevator, demonstrate the layout, design principles and technology employed. The Bolands Centre is also associated with work of Edward Gregory Waters, a prominent Cairns architect who designed the building and was responsible for a number of important structures within the city. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The building has aesthetic value due to the height, scale and the detailing of the facade, which is largely intact. The facade is of cast concrete executed in an ornate style, based an eclectic mix of Classical and other design elements, which projects an imposing, elegant presence on the streetscape. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The place has social significance as an iconic landmark due to its size, aesthetic appeal and longevity within the streetscape of Cairns, and the role it has played in the business life of Far North Queensland. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The Bolands Centre has direct associations with Michael Boland and his family, who built it and managed it for many years. Michael Boland was an early and important entrepreneur who established a large, long-lived commercial empire in Cairns and became one of the community's leading citizens.

The building housed a social services organization established in 1915 by Plymouth Church, a Minneapolis congregational church. The roots of the organization go back to Immanuel Sunday School, established in 1881 near Second Street Northeast and Broadway Street Northeast. The school later built a new building, Drummond Hall, near Second Street Northeast and 15th Avenue Northeast. The church expanded its programs to include various social services and clubs for neighborhood residents who had immigrated to Northeast Minneapolis from France, Germany, and Scandinavia. The demographics of the area had changed by the 1910s, though, and most of the newcomers were from eastern Europe. These newcomers still needed social services, but since most of them were Catholic, they were unwilling to accept Protestant religious education. The attendance dropped, forcing Drummond Hall to close in 1913. Plymouth Church still wanted to provide social services in northeast Minneapolis, so they commissioned a study to determine what they could provide for social services. The key finding of the study was that the neighborhood needed a sense of unity, since immigrants from various ethnic groups had differences with each other. The study found that they could acquaint new immigrants with American cultural norms and provide education, health care, and recreation. The church established a settlement house and hired Robbins Gilman, who had recently been fired from University Settlement House because of his support for the Industrial Workers of the World. The house opened in the Drummond Hall building, but later moved to a new, larger building a few blocks north. Robbins Gilman was aided by his wife, Catheryne, who was also a reformer. She influenced some of the NENH's programs but was more active in other organizations. When the NENH began operations on January 20, 1915, it was one of four settlement houses in the city. It offered classes in sewing, cooking, carpentry, and dancing. It also provided a supervised setting for the children of the neighborhood to socialize. Robbins Gilman hired one supervisor for boys and one for girls. This allowed him to focus on his grander ideas for the facility. A program to help women find work in conjunction with a day nursery was created. Within the first three years the NENH helped over 7,000 women find work. Gilman also began a dental clinic for children. As services expanded, so did the NENH's popularity. In 1918 construction of a new facility in the neo-Georgian style designed by Kenyon and Main was begun. By August of the next year NENH staff had moved into the new building. During the 1920s the facility offered more services and continued to expand. Two new wings, which included a gymnasium and a dormitory, were completed in 1927. When the Great Depression hit, the NENH became a focal point for aid programs in the neighborhood. In 1948 Gilman retired from his work at the NENH. He was succeeded by Lester Shaeffer and subsequently Joe Holewa, a native of the Northeast neighborhood. The latter half of the 20th century brought great changes to the NENH and other settlement houses. Government and well-funded private groups began dominating social services. The people who had grown up with the NENH moved out of the neighborhood; new arrivals were unfamiliar with its mission. The house continued in operation until the early 1960s, when it merged with the Margaret Barry House, another settlement house. The combined organization was renamed East Side Neighborhood Services. East Side Neighborhood Services moved out of the Georgian Revival building in 2001 and into a new, modern building. The 1919 building was renovated and now serves as apartments. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001.

This planet was discovered by transit on December 5, 2008. Despite the designation as HAT-P-8b, it is the 11th planet discovered by the HATNet Project. The mass of the planet is 50% more than Jupiter while the radius is also 50% more than Jupiter. The mass of this planet is exact since the inclination of the orbit is known, typical for transiting planets. This is a so-called “hot Jupiter” because this Jupiter-like gas giant planet orbits in a really close torch orbit around the star, making this planet extremely hot (in the order of a thousand kelvins). The distance from the star is roughly 20 times smaller than that of Earth from the Sun, which places the planet roughly 8 times closer to its star than Mercury is from the Sun. The “year” on this planet lasts only 3 days, 1 hour, 49 minutes, and 54 seconds, compared with Earth's 365 days, 6 hours, 9 minutes, and 10 seconds in a sidereal year. The study in 2012, utilizing a Rossiter–McLaughlin effect, have determined the planetary orbit is mildly misaligned with the rotational axis of the star, misalignment equal to -17°.

The Uno III adds a third wheel that allows it to transform into a tricycle. Description The original Uno is controlled in forward motion by the rider shifting weight over the centre of gravity. When the rider shifts forward, the vehicle speeds up to regain balance, when the rider leans back, the vehicle slows. Steering is controlled by side-to-side motion of the rider. The vehicle senses this shift and raises one of the two wheels to allow the vehicle to tilt in the desired turn direction. The Uno III has two configurations, as a dicycle and as a tricycle. As a dicycle it operates much the same as the original Uno with forward and back motion of the rider affecting acceleration. The Uno III also utilizes a hand throttle to affect acceleration and braking. Instead of using rider side-to-side movement to control steering, the Uno III uses a rotating handlebar. History The Uno was conceived by Milton, Ontario teenager Ben Gulak in 2006, following a trip to China. After seeing major smog pollution caused by heavy use of small motor vehicles, he decided he wanted to create an eco-friendly alternative. His initial design efforts consisted of an angle-iron frame with wheelchair motors, batteries and gyroscopes. He described his very first test-ride as \\"absolutely terrifying\\" and resulted in a crash and a chipped kneecap. Other early problems, including a series of electrical fires, arose, and he was then joined by California robotics expert Trevor Blackwell, who had previously designed a eunicycle, a single-wheeled gyro-stabilized vehicle, as well as a two-wheeler that resembled a Segway PT, to iron out the initial problems. Blackwell and Gulak refined the Uno's gyro control system so the machine would properly balance and move smoothly. Gulak then used the revised plans to develop a prototype vehicle with the help of engineer Werner Poss, Veltronics Ltd. of Brampton, Ontario, John Cosentini of Motorcycle Enhancements, a custom motorcycle builder in Oakville, Ontario, and research partner Jason Morrow. The Uno was unveiled at the Toronto Spring Motorcycle Show in 2008,supershowevents.com , Toronto Spring Motorcycle Show, accessed 01-02-2009 and won a Top-10 prize on Popular Science's list of 2008 Invention Awards. On the CBC series Dragons' Den, Gulak was given $1,250,000 in venture capital for a 20% share in further development. The deal fell apart in due diligence and only W. Brett Wilson paid his $250,000 portion. According to Ben Gulak, in order to improve the safety and usability of the Uno his company BPG Inc developed the Uno III to be able to transform from the classic Uno dicycle into a motorcycle. Though not a motorcycle in the classic definition, the 'motorcycle mode' is actually a tricycle with the two rear wheels coming so close together that they resemble a single wide wheel. The Uno III transforms between these two modes while being ridden.

The game has been likened to the similar puzzle game World of Goo. A sequel titled Tiki Towers 2: Monkey Republic was released in January 2011.  Conception  Tiki Towers was conceived by designer Frank Boosman from the Republic of Fun before the Wii's 2006 release. Excited by the promise of the Wii, he felt that the Wii's controller, the Wii Remote, would work great with games that required a lot of physical interactions. While listening to a talk by Will Wright, Wright said something to the effect of \\"Monkeys are funny\\", which gave Boosman the idea of representing building pieces as bamboo and coconuts in his new game and since a friend of his liked Tiki culture, it was used as the game's theme. Gameplay Based around a tropical Tiki culture-theme, the game involves players directing a troupe of monkeys to retrieve bananas by building towers of bamboo scaffolding to reach the fruits, with the ultimate goal of collecting all bananas and having all monkeys reach the designated \\"exit\\". This adds conflict as the player usually is tasked with building towers on a limited bamboo budget and if a tower falls it may prevent the monkeys from completing the level. On the Wii version of the game, while much remains the same (with regard to the mobile versions), one significant difference is that the player must also fend off \\"evil monkeys\\" trying to sabotage the player's towers while the \\"good monkeys\\" (player's 'troupe') are working toward their goal. Reception IGN called Tiki Towers a \\"fun and playable imitation\\" of World of Goo, giving it a 7.3/10. WiiWare World gave Tiki Towers a 7/10, noting that as a solid game at a third of Goo's price, it is well worth a look. AppSpy gave Tiki Towers a 4/5, saying that the game \\"is for those who enjoy physics based puzzle games involving monkeys\\". The mobile version (titled Tropical Towers in Europe) was named Casual Game of the Year for 2008 by the IMGA.https://www.imgawards.com/winners-nominees/5th-imga/ ReferencesExternal links Category:Puzzle video games Category:2008 video games Category:Wii games Category:WiiWare games Category:IOS games Category:IPod games Category:Android (operating system) games Category:BlackBerry games Category:Windows Phone games Category:Video games developed in the United States ","title":"Tiki Towers"},{"id":"20909351","text":"Wachusett Mountain State Reservation is a protected area encompassing around the summit of Mount Wachusett in Massachusetts.

He is known in the Netherlands as De Eerste Walvisvanger (\\"The First Whaleman\\") (1613). Van Muydenbukta and Van Mijenfjorden on the west coast of Spitsbergen and Kapp Muyen on the west coast of Jan Mayen are named after him. Life Van Muyden started his career as a ship's carpenter, but in 1607 he shipped aboard a vessel loaded with grain for Italy. In 1609 he travelled to Norway and Saint-Malo. In 1611 he made his way to the Mediterranean, where his ship was seized by pirates. He arrived in Middelburg in January of the following year. A company in Amsterdam under Lambert van Tweenhuysen, in the wake of the first whaling expedition to Spitsbergen, sent Van Muyden in the Neptunus to the same locale in 1612. They hired the absconding bankrupt Alan Sallows as pilot, a man who had spent twenty years \\"in the Northern Seas\\" in the service of the Muscovy Company.Purchas (1625), p. 15. On 13 May (NS)For simplicity, when English sources are resorted to, the date has been converted to the New Style (NS), as the English at the time still used the Old Style (OS). the expedition ran into the English off Bjørnøya. The following day there was talk among the English to detain Sallows, but they ultimately decided to let him go. On 5 June the ship sailed into the northern entrance of Forlandsundet, where, the next day, Sallows told the English of the loss of their merchant Kijn, who had fallen off a cliff and broken his neck. The same day the Neptunus sailed to the south. They anchored in a small bay on the north shore of Bellsund later called Van Muyden Harbor (modern Van Muydenbukta). Lacking the expertise of Basque whalemen, they had little success with catching whales, and when the men asked Sallows how to catch walrus and stated that they were prepared to follow his instructions, he provided none. Sallows proved incompetent. He appears to have never been to Spitsbergen before, as the information he provided the Dutch was incorrect; he in fact knew nothing about the country or its fauna. He further angered the men when drunk, daily consuming brandy. Prins Karls Forland in 2006 The Neptunus returned to Amsterdam on 17 September. Evidently learning from their error, the Dutch recruited twelve Basque whalemen from St. Jean de Luz for the following year. Van Tweenhuysen equipped two ships, the Neptunus, with Van Muyden again as master, and the Fortuyn, Jan Jacobsz Vrijer, master.Conway (1904), p. 12. Muller, without providing a source, states the master of the Fortuyn was Jan Jacobsz. Boots van Medemblik. The Neptunus and Fortuyn arrived off the Spitsbergen coast on 27 May. On 2 June the ships arrived at Prins Karls Forland. In mid-June they sailed into Trygghamna, on the north side of Isfjorden, but were ordered away by the English just three days later. After being driven out of Grønfjorden and Van Muydenbukta, Van Muyden sailed to Recherche Fjord and settled in a little cove on its western shore, which he christened SchoonhavenHessel Gerritsz. (1613). In: Conway (1904), p. 31. (modern Josephbukta).Archaeological excavations have found the remains of a temporary whaling station on the northern moraine of the Renard Glacier on the northern shore of Josephbukta. Red roofing tiles and pottery of Dutch origin found at the site suggest that this may have been Van Muyden's station. See Hacquebord, Steenhuisen, and Waterbolk (2003) From 25 June to 20 July they caught eighteen bowhead whales, thirty walrus, and two polar bears. They were discovered here by the English on 21 July. They seized their goods and detained Vrijer until 25 July and Van Muyden until 28 July. Despite being ordered away, Van Muyden continued along the coast until 9 August, when he sailed homewards. Van Muyden again sailed to Spitsbergen in 1614Muller (1874), p. 371. and 1615.Dodt (1848), p. 126. In 1616 he was again master of the Neptunus, this time on a whaling voyage to the recently discovered Jan Mayen. He was among the first to arrive at the island early in June; he left in late July with a full cargo of oil. He appears to have sailed north in 1618,Kernkamp (1898), p. 368-70. and in 1619Hart (1976), p. 234. and again in 1621 he once more went to Jan Mayen.Kernkamp (1898), p. 364-65. The last year he was living in a house on the Rapenburg. A year later, 1622, he lived on the Keizersgracht near the Greenland warehouses.

It is one of Benjamin's best-known, and most controversial works. Composed of twenty numbered paragraphs, Benjamin wrote the brief essay shortly before attempting to escape from Vichy France, where French collaborationist government officials were handing over Jewish refugees like Benjamin to the Nazi Gestapo. Theses is the last major work Benjamin completed before fleeing to Spain where, fearing Nazi capture, he committed suicide in September 1940. Summary In the essay, Benjamin uses poetic and scientific analogies to present a critique of historicism. One interpretation of Benjamin in Thesis I is that Benjamin is suggesting that despite Karl Marx's claims to scientific objectivity, historical materialism is actually a quasi-religious fraud. Benjamin uses The Turk, a famous chess-playing device of the 18th century, as an analogy for historical materialism. Presented as an automaton that could defeat skilled chess players, The Turk actually concealed a human (allegedly a dwarf) who controlled the machine. He wrote: :One can envision a corresponding object to [The Turk] in philosophy. The puppet called “historical materialism” is always supposed to win. It can do this with no further ado against any opponent, so long as it employs the services of theology, which as everyone knows is small and ugly and must be kept out of sight. However, the Marxist author Michael Löwy points out that Benjamin puts quotation marks around 'historical materialism' in this paragraph: :The use of quotation marks and the way this is phrased suggest that this automaton is not 'true' historical materialism, but something that is given that name. By whom, we ask. And the answer must be the chief spokesmen of Marxism in his period, that is to say the ideologues of the Second and Third Internationals.\\" One key to Benjamin’s critique of historicism is his rejection of the past as a continuum of progress. This is most apparent in thesis XI. His alternate vision of the past and “progress” is best represented by thesis IX, which employs Paul Klee’s painting Angelus Novus (1920) as the \\"angel of history,\\" with his back turned to the future: \\"Where we see the appearance of a chain of events, he sees one single catastrophe, which unceasingly piles rubble on top of rubble and hurls it before his feet [...] That which we call progress, is this storm.\\" Benjamin thus inverts Marxist historical materialism, which was concerned with predicting a revolutionary future, to assert that historical materialism's true task ought to be, in the words of political scientist Ronald Beiner, \\"to save the past.\\" Klee's Angelus Novus. According to Benjamin, \\"Historicism depicts the 'eternal' picture of the past; the historical materialist, an experience with it, which stands alone\\" (Thesis XVI). Benjamin argues against the idea of an \\"eternal picture\\" of history and prefers the idea of history as a self-standing experience. Thus, Benjamin states “To articulate the past historically does not mean to recognize it ‘the way it really was.' It means to seize hold of a memory as it flashes up at a moment of danger\\" (Thesis VI). In Thesis XVIII, he highlights a scientific perspective of time only to follow it up with some provocative metaphors: :'In relation to the history of organic life on Earth,' notes a recent biologist, 'the miserable fifty millennia of homo sapiens represents something like the last two seconds of a twenty-four hour day. The entire history of civilized humanity would, on this scale, take up only one fifth of the last second of the last hour.' The here-and-now, which as the model of messianic time summarizes the entire history of humanity into a monstrous abbreviation, coincides to a hair with the figure, which the history of humanity makes in the universe. Benjamin's colleague Gershom Scholem, who is quoted in Theses, believed that Benjamin's critique of historical materialism was so final that, as Mark Lilla would write, \\"nothing remains of historical materialism [...] but the term itself. Historical context Scholem, who is quoted in Theses, suggested that the cryptic essay's seemingly definitive rejection of Marxist historical materialism in favor of a return to the theology and metaphysics of Benjamin's earlier writings came after Benjamin recovered from the deep shock he felt following the 1939 Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact when the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany, previously bitter rivals, announced a non-aggression pact. Publication history Benjamin mailed a copy of the essay to the philosopher Hannah Arendt, who passed it on to Theodor Adorno. Benjamin asked that the essay not be published, but it was first printed in a mimeographed booklet entitled Walter Benjamin zum Gedächtnis (In memory of Walter Benjamin). In 1947, a French translation (\\"Sur le concept d'histoire\\") by Pierre Missac appeared in the journal, Les Temps Modernes no. 25. An English translation by Harry Zohn is included in the collection of essays by Benjamin, Illuminations, edited by Arendt (1968).

They are found primarily throughout Sindh, Pakistan and Punjab region of Pakistan. Jat Muslims are also found in the province of Azad Kashmir in Pakistan. Jats began converting to Islam from the early Middle Ages onward, and constitute a distinct sub-group within the diverse community of Jat people. Introduction of Islam When Arabs entered Sindh and other Southern regions of current Pakistan in the seventh century, the chief tribal groupings they found were the Jats and the Med people. These Jats are often referred as Zatts in early Arab writings. The Jats were the first converts to Islam, and many were employed as soldiers by the new Arab Muslim administration in Sindh. The Muslim conquest chronicles further point at the important concentrations of Jats in towns and fortresses of Lower and Central Sindh. Between the 10th and the 13th Century, there was large immigration of Jat groups northwards to Punjab and eastwards towards what is now Rajasthan. Many Jat clans initially settled in a region known as the Bar country, which referred to the country between the rivers of Punjab, thinly populated with scanty rainfall which accommodated a type of pastoral nomadism which was based primary on the rearing of goats and camels. Between the 11th and the 13th centuries, the Jats became essentially a farming population, taking advantage in the growth of irrigation. As these Jats became converted to farmers, they started accepting Islam. Most Jats clans of western Punjab have traditions that they accepted Islam at the hands of two famous Punjabi Sufi saints of Punjab, Shaikh Faridudin Ganj Shaker of Pakpattan or his contemporary Baha Al Haq Zakiriya of Multan. In reality, the process of conversion was said to much a slower process. Social organisation In the plains of Punjab, there are many communities of Jat, some of whom had converted to Islam by the 18th century, while others had become Sikhs. Those clans that converted to Islam remained in what is now Pakistani Punjab after Partition. In Pakistan, most Jats are land- owning agriculturalists, and they form one of the numerous ethnic group in Sindh.

It documents Greenough’s search for uncrowded waves, which led to the construction of his 37-foot ocean-going yacht. It also feature Greenough's surfing friends, Californian Richie West and Australian world champion Nat Young. Crystal Voyager premiered at the Sydney Opera House on 5 December 1973 and had a successful three-week run there before opening in other states. The theatrical 35mm version of the film is different from the original 16mm release and was re-edited by Elfick and Greenough. It became one of Australia's most successful surf films, grossing more than A$100,000 (1973 figures) on its initial Australian release, before being picked up by British Hemdale Corporation. Crystal Voyager gained substantial press on its release, mostly due to its strong reception at the Cannes Film Festival.

One of the leading journalists of the Socialist Party of America, Engdahl joined the Communist movement in 1921 and continued to employ his talents in that organization as the first editor of The Daily Worker. Engdahl was also a key leader of the International Red Aid (MOPR) organization based in Moscow, where he died in 1932. BiographyEarly years= The son of Swedish Lutheran immigrants, J. Louis Engdahl (who went by his middle name, \\"Louis\\") was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on November 11, 1884. Engdahl was intelligent and well educated, he graduated from the University of Minnesota in 1907, having paid his way through school by working as a telegraph operator and as City Editor of the Minneapolis Daily News. =Political career= Engdahl was a member of the Socialist Party from 1908.G.M.

In 1909, he took a position as the Labor Editor of the Chicago Daily Socialist, assuming the mantle of Editor of that publication from 1910 until its termination in 1912. Engdahl attended the Copenhagen Congress of the Socialist International in 1910 as a journalist on behalf of the Scandinavian Socialist Federation. He joined the Socialist Party of America in September 1912. Despite his traveling to Europe for the Scandinavian Federation, it does not seem that Engdahl ever directly participated in language federation politics in any way.Henry Bengston, On the Left in America: Memoirs of the Scandinavian-American Labor Movement. [1955] Carbondale, IL: Southern Illinois University Press, 1999. Louis Engdahl was a Socialist candidate for US Congress from Illinois in 1916; for the Chicago City Council in 1917; again for Congress in the Illinois 7th C.D. in 1918. He also was on the Organizing Committee of the Communist Propaganda League of Chicago from its origin in 1918 until its demise in 1919. In 1914, Engdahl assumed the position of Editor of The American Socialist, the Chicago-based official organ of the SPA. He continued to edit this newspaper each week until it was suppressed by postal authorities in 1917. Thereafter, he moved to the successor weekly publication, The Eye Opener, which he continued to edit until 1919. Engdahl with his co-defendants targeted by the U.S. Department of Justice in 1918. In February 1918, Engdahl's aggressive antimilitarism caused him to run afoul of the US Department of Justice, who targeted him as editor of the Socialist Party's weekly newspaper under the Espionage Act for undermining the American military conscription program. Along with his party comrades Adolph Germer, Victor L. Berger, Bill Kruse, and Irwin St. John Tucker, Engdahl was indicted by a grand jury. The quintet was brought to trial before the harsh Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis on December 6, 1918 (that is, after the war had ended), with the trial ending during the first week of January 1919. The jury found all five guilty as charged, and Judge Landis imposed a draconian sentence of 20 years in the Federal Penitentiary upon each. This sentence was later overturned on appeal for the reason of judicial bias. Out pending appeal on $25,000 bond, Engdahl was a delegate from Illinois to the seminal 1919 Emergency National Convention of the Socialist Party, refusing to either support Adolph Germer, James Oneal, and the party regulars or to bolt the convention to join either of the fledgling Communist organizations — the Communist Labor Party of America or the Communist Party of America. Instead, Engdahl remained in the Socialist Party as a leader of the Left Wing faction, which congealed as the Committee for the Third International in 1920. Engdahl served as Secretary of this faction until it departed the party in the aftermath of the 1921 Convention. From 1920 until July 1921, Engdahl served as editor of the Chicago Socialist, publication of Local Cook County of the SPA, until he was finally removed for political reasons. He was also the Secretary of Local Cook County SPA until his resignation on July 21, 1921. After the disappointment of the 1921 Convention of the SPA, the Committee for the Third International left the party to mark the world with a short-lived existence as part of the Workers Council group — a small group of Communist adherents who sought to turn their backs on the sectarian infighting of the underground Communist parties. This pro- Comintern/anti-underground position proved to be timely, as in December 1921, at the Comintern's request, a \\"Legal Political Party\\" called the Workers Party of America (WPA) was established at a convention in New York. The Workers Council group was absorbed into the WPA at this time. He was elected to the 7 member \\"Administrative Council\\" of the WPA on Oct. 10, 1921. He stood as the WPA's candidate for Congress in the New York 12th C.D. in 1922. In January 1923 he was elected by the 2nd Convention of the WPA to the party's Central Executive Committee and sat on the inner circle of this group called the Executive Council. Engdahl was employed as Managing Editor of the WPA's organ, The Worker, from 1922. When that paper moved to daily status in January 1924, Engdahl wore the hat of Editor of The Daily Worker, although as an adherent of the minority Pepper-Ruthenberg-Lovestone faction, he was saddled with a co- editor from the majority Foster-Cannon-Lore faction in February. He continued as an Editor at The Daily Worker until 1928. In his 1952 memoir, Whittaker Chambers described him thus: > The paper's nominal editor was J. Louis Engdahl, a Communist in his late > forties or fifties, who seldom paid any attention to what was going on, for, > at the time, he was a prey to both political and emotional stresses of great > intensity.

When it rang, he would > stare at it gloomily, then have someone else answer it. We always knew who > was calling when we heard: \\"Comrade Engdahl is out of the office. No, I > don't think he will be back.\\" In February 1925, Engdahl was a candidate of the Workers (Communist) Party for Chicago City Alderman. He was the candidate of the W(C)P for Governor of Illinois in the fall of 1926.\\"Workers Party Enters Candidates in State Elections This Year,\\" The Daily Worker, vol. 3, no. 211 (September 20, 1926), pg. 4. From May 1927 through February 1928, Engdahl was a member of the Presidium of the Executive Committee of the Communist International, representing the Workers (Communist) Party of America.Adibekov et al. (eds.), Politbiuro TsK RKP(b) - VKP(b) i Komintern: 1919-1943 Dokumenty, pg. 905. Engdahl remained in Moscow as the representative of the American Communist Party to ECCI until late in December 1928, when he was replaced by Bertram D. Wolfe.Theodore Draper, American Communism and Soviet Russia. New York: Viking Press, 1960; pg. 392. In July 1929, Engdahl was appointed by the CEC of the Communist Party as National Secretary of International Labor Defense (ILD), the party's legal aid arm.. He was named to the Polburo of the Communist Party in 1930 and was the party's delegate to the Comintern in Moscow in that same year. In 1930, he ran for Lieutenant Governor of New York with William Z. Foster on the Communist ticket. He was also a member and later Chairman of the CPUSA's Central Control Committee, as well as a member of the Presidium of International Red Aid (MOPR) — the international umbrella organization of the ILD. =Death and legacy= In Moscow on MOPR business, Engdahl died of pneumonia at the age of 48 on November 21, 1932. He was buried on November 23 following a service attended by many prominent communists including future East German president Wilhelm Pieck. Despite the fairly vast number of words he wrote throughout his career as a journalist, Louis Engdahl did not write any books and only a handful of pamphlets, including Debs and O'Hare in Prison (1919); The Tenth Year (1927); Gastonia: A Class Case and a Class Verdict (1929) and Sedition! (1930). He was also the subject of two pamphlets published by the Communist Party in 1932 and 1935, respectively. Engdahl's papers are housed at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.

Baduhenna is solely attested in Tacitus's Annals where Tacitus records that a sacred grove in ancient Frisia was dedicated to her, and that near this grove 900 Roman soldiers were killed in 28 CE. Scholars have analyzed the name of the goddess and linked the figure to the Germanic Matres and Matronae. Etymology The first element of the goddess's name, Badu-, may be cognate to Proto-Germanic *badwa- meaning \\"battle.\\" The second portion of the name -henna appears as -henae in the names of matrons, Germanic goddesses widely attested from the 1st to 5th century CE on votive stones and votive altars. Rudolf Simek states that the goddess's name etymology implies that the goddess is associated with war, and Simek points out that sacred groves are commonly associated with the Germanic peoples.Simek (2007:26). Attestation Baduhenna is solely attested in book 4, chapter 73 of Tacitus's Annals. In chapters 73 and 74 of Annals, Tacitus describes the defeat of the Roman army in ancient Frisia: {  Original Latin (1st century CE): : :mox compertum a transfugis nongentos Romanorum apud lucum quem Baduhennae vocant pugna in posterum extracta confectos, et aliam quadringentorum manum occupata Cruptoricis quondam stipendiarî villa, postquam proditio metuebatur, mutuis ictibus procubuisse. : :74.

It stars George Peppard as Jonas Cord, a character based loosely on Howard Hughes, and Alan Ladd in his last role as Nevada Smith, a former western gunslinger turned actor. Carroll Baker, Martha Hyer, Bob Cummings, and Elizabeth Ashley also star. The film is a landmark of the sexual revolution of the 1960s, venturing further than most films of the period with its heated sexual embraces, innuendo, and sadism between men and women, much like the novel, where \\"there is sex and/or sadism every 17 pages\\". Filmed in 35mm Panavision, this was one of the first movies to be blown up to 70mm (\\"Panavision 70\\") for premiere screening. The Carpetbaggers was released in April 1964. Two years after this film, Steve McQueen played Ladd's character in a Western prequel titled Nevada Smith. PlotOpening narration= Every generation has its modern carpetbaggers, its adventurers who gamble everything to stand head and shoulders above other men. Among them could be a creative giant, a do-gooder, a tyrant or a plunderer — a man who leaves his personal brand on everything and everyone he touches. I guess in the past generation it could have been someone like the fictional and fabulous Jonas Cord Junior — the best or the worst — depending on how much you imagined he might have hurt you... or how much you believed he helped you. The legend of Jonas spanned almost two decades and it began that April morning in the nineteen twenties... in the sky over the Nevada desert.\\" =Jonas Cord's father dies= Jonas Cord Jr. becomes one of America's richest men in the early twentieth century, inheriting an explosives company from his late father. Jonas resents his alcoholic father bitterly and is psychologically scarred from the death of an insane twin brother. Afraid that his brother's insanity is carried in the bloodline, Jonas avoids romantic commitments and doesn't want children of his own. He hates for anyone to call him \\"Junior\\" – or especially to call him \\"crazy\\" – with his reckless ways and wild money- making schemes. Jonas buys up all the company stock including some held by Nevada Smith, a former western gunslinger. Once a wanted man named Max Sand, Nevada reformed and changed his name. In his new identity, Nevada had practically raised Jonas in the absence of his father. However, Jonas always investigates his associates and has uncovered the truth about Nevada's past. Jonas Cord Jr. also pays off his father's young widow, Rina Marlowe, a shapely blonde. She was his first girlfriend, much adored, in his naive youth. When he introduced her to his father, the elder Cord had promptly seduced and married her. Bitter and vengeful, Jonas carries on with his stepmother behind his father's back, in an ongoing love/hate relationship. He despises her for marrying his father strictly for money. Rina is portrayed as a sexually assertive gold-digger and expert manipulator of men, but she can't get the best of Jonas. Rina takes the money and moves to Paris, partying her way through the Roaring Twenties, ending up penniless but still beautiful. =Jonas becomes a ruthless multimillionaire= Jonas becomes an aviation pioneer and his wealth grows. Flying across the country, always busy with new deals and schemes, he lives in hotel suites, with no permanent home, even though he now owns his father's house. A hard drinker and womanizer, Jonas makes no time for leisurely enjoyment of his wealth. Avoiding true friendship, he looks for the inside angle, using people to make money no matter how it hurts them. Jonas soon destroys a business rival named Winthrop, then seduces and marries the man's daughter Monica. Vivacious and unconventional at first, Monica seems to enjoy Cord's free-wheeling lifestyle. However, after many exhausting business trips (\\"air sickness instead of morning sickness\\"), Monica wants to settle down and have a home and children. Dismayed, Jonas cruelly abandons her, pushing her to divorce him. He offers no explanation except that he thought she wanted that hectic, loveless life. Monica hangs on for years, aware of Cord's troubled youth, hoping he'll come back to her. Finally Jonas arranges a nasty set-up to force the divorce. He invites Monica to his hotel room and she arrives eagerly, expecting a reconciliation. Instead, through the door deliberately left open, she sees Jonas kissing Rina, his sexy stepmother, in a way that leaves no doubt of their relationship. Crushed, Monica gives Jonas his divorce, then discovers she's pregnant with his child. After the birth, Jonas visits her, demanding to know if he's the father. Monica tells him to leave her and their newborn daughter alone. Years pass with no contact between them. =Nevada Smith becomes a star in westerns= Meanwhile, Nevada Smith finds work in western films becoming a popular cowboy hero. Rina resurfaces, pursuing Nevada, who now has fame and money. She persuades Jonas to finance Nevada's project, a script about his former outlaw life, in which he will star. This gives Jonas an interest in the Bernard Norman company, the second-rate studio that produces Nevada's films, plus creative control over the resulting movie. Norman and Jonas argue then get into a fist-fight over casting; the female lead is Norman's inept girlfriend. Jonas demands that Rina get the role; she's a natural actress and perfect for the part. Jonas even hires Dan Pierce, Nevada's agent, to work for him in public relations. Dan will re-work the script and expand Rina's role, while diminishing Nevada's part. Furious, Bernard Norman vows revenge for humiliation suffered, but Rina becomes a big star, the main asset of his company. She continues to drink and party; her career blossoms while Nevada's declines. To spite Jonas, Rina marries Nevada, now considered a has-been. Jonas offers several times to buy the film company, but Bernard Norman, still angry, refuses. Then Dan Pierce, although he works for Jonas, approaches Norman as studio head with bad news. Rina, drinking while driving, has crashed her car and died. Norman sees his chance for revenge. He offers Dan a sweet deal to keep Rina's death secret and arrange the immediate sale of the studio. Dan betrays his employer Jonas, sets up the sale, and Jonas pays Norman much more than the studio is worth absent its chief box-office draw. Realizing Dan's betrayal, Jonas beats him up and heads out. =Jonas replaces Rina with Jennie Denton= Jonas goes on an alcoholic binge and disappears. Finally, he dries out. Upon his return, he decides he can run the studio, even directing films. Before their falling out, Dan had set up a screen test for his favorite call girl, Jennie Denton, an attractive blonde who resembles Rina. Jonas sees the possibilities and Jennie becomes the studio's new sex symbol and star. She also becomes his mistress. World War II is creating a huge demand for war planes and Jonas buys another aviation plant. He calls Monica to help him find and re-hire her father, to run the new facility. Monica takes that as a hopeful sign and comes unannounced to Jonas' hotel room, bringing their lovely daughter (who is unaware that Jonas is her father). Ironically, Monica walks into a replay of the set-up from years back. Just as Jonas seems happy to see her, eager to get to know his child, Jennie steps out of the bedroom, clearly nude except for a white mink coat. This debacle is truly an accident, but Monica walks out, hurt and disgusted. Jonas is too proud to go after her and too tough to show any feelings. Instead he coldly demands that Jennie demonstrate how much she likes her new coat and they have sex. Having lost any chance with Monica, Jonas begins to groom Jennie for marriage. She accepts his proposal, believing they're in love. Her career continues to flourish (a glamour photo of her is shown on the cover of the October 18, 1940 issue of the fictional magazine Comment), but she is in for a rude awakening. Jonas cuts his ties with old associates, his aviation partner Buzz and his longtime lawyer Mac. Both have grown tired of his bullying and using them. They're glad to go. Mac tells Jonas he's playing a role, playing so well he doesn't know what's real. He's become just like his father, cruelly cold and alcoholic. Look in the mirror. \\"Goodbye, Junior.\\" Jonas throws his shot glass and breaks the mirror, still denying what others know is true. With news of Jonas' engagement, Dan Pierce tries to blackmail Jennie. Armed with a copy of a porno film she made in her youth, Dan threatens to reveal her shady past to Jonas and the world if she doesn't pay up. Upset and in tears, Jennie goes to Jonas to confess, breaking their engagement to spare him. She tells him, \\"I don't want you to get hurt. I love you!\\" Jonas just laughs. He's had her investigated (as he always does) so he knows all about her past. He brags that he made her a star, made her eligible to marry him. Why? So he can have her services conveniently available, all to himself. So what if she's been had all over town? People won't dare to disparage the wife of the rich and powerful Jonas Cord; do that and he'll destroy them. With her dream of loving shattered, Jennie runs out devastated. Jonas of course lets her go, seemingly unfazed. =Jonas has a fist-fight with Nevada and returns to Monica= Seeing the wreckage of both their lives, Nevada Smith confronts Jonas with fighting words, ending by saying \\"You're crazy.\\" That's all it takes; Jonas socks him and commences a vicious fist-fight, a huge knockdown brawl. Both get in solid punches, falling over and breaking the furniture. At last they lie there, bruised and bloody. Then Nevada stands up and really lets Jonas have it. Nevada says Jonas is full of hatred and fear, hatred for his cruel father and fear of becoming insane like his long lost twin brother. He takes out his anger on anyone who cares about him. He's destroying everything that really matters. Monica truly loved him. They have a beautiful healthy daughter which proves there's no hereditary insanity lurking in his future. Jonas breaks down, crying because he never even got to speak to his brother, who was locked away when they were infants. He kept rushing to accomplish all he could, fearing insanity might overtake him any moment. Jonas sees how empty his hectic life is, how he's thrown away happiness and replaced it with money and power. He's made plenty of enemies, but no real friends except for Nevada who stuck by him even when Jonas sabotaged his career. A contrite Jonas returns to Monica asking her to listen. He has sold all the businesses that kept them apart. He bought a house and wants to make it a home. All he needs is another chance and he'll try to earn her trust. He admits he lied to her so long because he loved her then and he loves her now. Sweet Monica, now strong without him, has always loved him. Of course, she forgives him and they embrace. Their daughter will grow up as a healthy, normal girl (as much as is possible given the past).

When Alan Ladd signed to play Nevada Smith, it was also announced that Paramount and Joseph E. Levine would make a prequel about Smith's adventures called Nevada Smith. Joan Collins, in her autobiography Past Imperfect (1978), says she had a firm offer to play Rina Marlowe but had to decline because of pregnancy. Robert Cummings was cast as an agent.

Carroll Baker had a highly publicized nude scene, shot on a closed set. Release and reception Screenshot from trailer for The Carpetbaggers (1964) Alan Ladd died before the film was released. The Carpetbaggers premiered in Denver, Colorado on April 9, 1964, and went on to be a large commercial success. It grossed $28,409,547 at the domestic box office,Box Office Information for The Carpetbaggers. The Numbers. Retrieved 30 April 2013. making it the 4th highest-grossing film of 1964. Variety reported that the film earned $13 million in domestic rentals. At the worldwide box office, the film grossed $40,000,000 against a $3 million budget. Due to its success, a prequel was filmed and released two years later. Ladd's part was taken by Steve McQueen. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times panned the film as \\"a sickly sour distillation of Harold Robbins's big-selling novel\\", with the protagonist \\"a thoroughly mechanical movie puppet, controlled by a script- writer's strings\\", and Peppard's performance \\"expressionless, murky and dull.\\"Crowther, Bosley (July 2, 1964). \\"Screen: 'The Carpetbaggers' Opens\\". The New York Times. 24. Variety wrote, \\"Psychological facets of the story are fuzzy, and vital motivational information is withheld to the point where it no longer really seems to matter why he is the miserable critter he is. His sudden reform is little more than an unconvincing afterthought. There's nobody to root for in 'The Carpetbaggers.' And Hayes' screenplay never seems to miss an opportunity to slip in connotations of sex, whether or not they are necessary.\\"\\"Film Reviews: The Carpetbaggers\\". Variety. April 15, 1964. 6. Philip K. Scheuer of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the film \\"is trash, but it has the curiosity pull of a trashy novel. One sits there squirming in the captive presence of its unremitting boldness and bad taste for two-and-a-half hours (it ends again and again and starts up again and again), waiting only for its central figure, Jonas Cord Jr., to be cornered and stomped on like the rat he is. But then we find him, hat in hand, seeking forgiveness and reconciliation from a wronged ex-wife. More—he gets them.\\"Scheuer, Philip K. (June 5, 1964). \\"'Carpetbaggers' in Bad Taste as Film\\". Los Angeles Times. Part IV, p. 13. Richard L. Coe of The Washington Post described the film as \\"wild, fruity nonsense\\" and observed, \\"At all events, Robbins and Hayes have it beautifully tied up psychologically and all I can say is that I'm glad I never had an insane twin.\\"Coe, Richard L. (June 13, 1964). \\"Carpetbaggers Safe on Base\\". The Washington Post. C34. The film became one of the targets for the negative impact of films on society. Crowther cited the film, along with Kiss Me, Stupid, for giving American movies the reputation of \\"deliberate and degenerate corruptors of public taste and morals\\". The movie was one of the 13 most popular films in the UK in 1965. However, many critics frowned upon the film, considering it to be \\"vulgar and tasteless\\" or \\"an upscale dirty movie\\". The Monthly Film Bulletin stated, \\"They don't make movies like this any more—or at least, like The Carpetbaggers should have been. Dmytryk does a very clean, efficient job of direction, interweaving the various strands of his complicated story with exemplary clarity, but somehow there is an element missing: the film is big, bold, sprawlingly epic and all that, but it never manages to carry off its outrageous silliness with any of the flourish of the good old days.\\" Mad magazine lampooned the film in issue #92 with The Carpetsweepers. The theme tune by Elmer Bernstein was recorded in a version by Jimmy Smith arranged by Lalo Schiffrin. This version was used to accompany the titles and credits for the UK BBC 2 The Money Programme, a finance and current affairs television magazine program. Soundtrack Elmer Bernstein re- recorded his music for the movie as an album on Ava Records. In 2013 Intrada Records issued the complete original soundtrack on CD, pairing it with the CD premiere of the Ava re-recording (tracks 22-31). # Seal / Main Title 2:26 # A Maverick 0:52 # Rina's Record 3:32 # The Forbidden Room 2:42 # Sierra Source (Alternate) 1:41 # Sierra Source 2:39 # Separate Trails 2:03 # Monica's Shimmy 0:31 # Lots of Lovely Ceilings 2:02 # Nevada's Trouble 7:12 # Get a Divorce 1:35 # Movie Mogul 0:35 # Two of a Kind 5:11 # Sierra Source Pt. 2 2:14 # Rina's Dead 1:02 # Speak of the Devil 1:29 # New Star 3:05 # Bad Bargain 0:51 # Jonas Hits Bottom 5:40 # Finale 1:26 # Love Theme from The Carpetbaggers 3:10 # The Carpetbaggers 2:31 # Love Theme from The Carpetbaggers 2:40 # Speak of the Devil 2:01 # Forbidden Room 2:19 # The Carpetbagger Blues 3:52 # Main Title from The Carpetbaggers 2:10 # New Star 2:16 # The Producer Asks for a Divorce 2:39 # Jonas Hits Bottom 2:50 # Finale 1:44 Legacy *Nevada Smith (1966) was conceived as a prequel to The Carpetbaggers.

Gompers and Josh Lerner, Professors of Business Administration at Harvard Business School. The book was first published in 2001 by the Harvard Business School Press. It is considered one of the best studies about the venture capital industry in United States.  Overview  The Money of Invention is a non-technical overview of the venture capital (VC), written for a general audience who wants to understand how VC industry works. The book is composed of three major sections. The first section focuses on the perspective of the entrepreneurs, the second on the venture capitalists, and the third on what Gompers and Lerner call 'the emulators', organizations that try to copy the venture capital model. In the first section, the authors identify the challenges entrepreneurs face when trying to raise capital: (1) uncertainty about the future; (2) information gaps about the new product and the market for it; (3) the predominance of soft assets (e.g. patents, trade secrets), in contrast to hard assets (e.g. land, equipment) that are easier to finance; and (4) the volatility of the product- and financial market conditions. The authors then explain how VCs addresses these problems: screening mechanisms, due diligence, staged financing, syndicated investment, executive compensation rules, financing covenants like convertible debt, and corporate governance mechanisms are some of the solutions employed and discussed in the book. In the second section, the authors focus on venture capital organizations. This section is part a historical account about the VC industry in United States, beginning with the founding of the first modern VC firm, American Research and Development Corporation, by MIT president Karl Compton and HBS professor Georges Doriot, in 1946. It also explores subsequent VC booms to the federally guaranteed Small Business Investment Companies Program in the 1960s and the 1974 Employee Retirement Income Security Act, allowing a \\"prudent man\\" to hold some high-risk investments and increasing the flow of institutional money into the VC business. This section also describes the ways in which venture capital is structured, connecting its success to the limited partnership structure (e.g. management fees, carried interests, contractual restrictions); the mechanisms to raise funds and the emergence of the fund of funds; and the challenges of the regulators to grapple with its information gap problems. The section closes with a detailed study of the overshooting phenomena that explains the volatility of the returns of the industry. The third section of the book looks at efforts to apply the principles of venture investing in corporate, public sector, educational, and international settings. The authors argue that the lack of adequate compensation schemes and organizational structures usually limit the success of the venture capital model in these settings.  Reviews  Randall Morck, an academic in the field, says that the book is \\"accessible to undergraduates and MBAs with little economics and to the general reader\\", but recommends The Venture Capital Cycle (Paul Gompers and Josh Lerner 1999, Cambridge: MIT Press) from the same authors for a high- level academic treatment of the same issues. He further states that the book may be interesting to economists, explaining that \\"the familiar problems of agency cost, information asymmetry, adverse selection, and moral hazard assume overarching importance in the VC business.\\" He praises the book for giving \\"clarifying to these problems\\", being useful to \\"counterweight the more traditional presentation of these issues\\". Reviewers also say that the authors \\"are strong supporters of the venture capital model\\", and hence \\"the reader is left with little doubt that the VC business has managed the trick at least tolerably well.\\" George Kingston points out that the book was published prior to the stock market downturn of the internet bubble and \\"it does not address the impact of these events on venture capital\\".

Darts, on the other hand, are folds sewn into the clothing to shape the resultant garment. The main difference from viennese seams is that princess seams run down from the shoulder, whereas viennese seams run down from the armhole. The princess seam style of dress needs no waistline at all, since it does its shaping without darts, by joining edges of different curvature.

Life and career Son of an old family of the Languedoc nobility, he was born in Chartres and was initially intended by his parents for a military career. But Castillon gave up plans for professional soldiering in favour of music, which he learned first in his birthplace and then in Paris, studying piano and composition, initially with Charles Delioux. In this second capacity he went to the Paris Conservatoire where he attended the classes of Victor Massé and, from 1869, of César Franck. Before his studies with Franck, he had completed his Opus 1, a piano quintet, probably inspired by the earlier example of his friend Camille Saint- Saëns.Fauquet (1997), p. 304. Both the quintet and the later piano quartet Op. 7 follow Schumann's model.Fauquet (1997), p. 302. He disavowed earlier efforts, including a symphony in F major, which he had written in 1865. In fragile health at the best of times (volunteering during the War of 1870, he fell ill and was demobilized in 1871), he died of complications from fever in 1873, before reaching the age of 35. He nevertheless composed several impressively Romantic works. These include pieces for piano, chamber music, mélodies, a piano concerto, and other orchestral music. He was also active in Parisian musical life, in particular helping to create, in 1871, the Société Nationale de Musique, of which he was the first secretary.

History  In 1995, during an exhibition of Yang-style t'ai chi ch'uan promoted by the Shanxi Tai Chi Chuan Association in Taiyuan, China, a meeting was held with the participation of Masters Yang Zhenduo and Yang Jun and many other instructors of t'ai chi ch'uan from all over the world, whom they had met during their many travels. During the meeting it was decided to create the Yang Chengfu Tai Chi Chuan Centers and subsequently, three offices were opened in the United States in Texas, Michigan and New York, with directors Horacio Lopez, Han Hoong Wang and Bill Walsh, respectively. Yang Zhenduo opened these centers in honor of his father, Yang Chengfu, who was responsible for the widespread popularity of Yang-style t'ai chi ch'uan. In 1996 fourth center was added in New Jersey, United States, with director Andy Lee. For years the Masters Yang Zhenduo and Yang Jun had visited the Yang Chengfu Tai Chi Chuan Centers, so the time was ripe for the creation of an International Organization which combined the centers and schools in each country into a cohesive structure. To attract more students, however, it was decided that an Association provided the best structure. So, on October 29, 1998 the International Yang Style Tai Chi Chuan Association was founded in Seattle, Washington, United States. Then in August of the following year, Yang Jun, moved to Seattle with his wife Fang Hong and in September opened the Seattle center. Its website first opened on April 24, 1999.

It was constructed between 1956 and 1961. The purpose of the dam is irrigation, flood control, hydroelectric power production and recreation. Due to poor construction and neglect, the dam and its 249 MW power station have undergone several repairs over the years. A rehabilitation of the power station began in 2007 and was completed in 2013.  Background  After the Harza Engineering Company of USA designed the dam, construction began in 1956. The reservoir began to fill in November 1961 and the dam was complete that same year. After the reservoir filled, several problems occurred. In 1967, there was a major slope failure about upstream of the dam. This and other slope failures are continually under repair. The bedrock beneath the dam has to be re-grouted and the crest of the dam settled too much, required it to be repaired. The rip-rap on the upstream face of the dam was also repaired in 1999 and 2000. Between 1983 and 1985 the dam's power station was replaced by German (Polensky & Zöllner) and Japanese companies (Mitsui). The original 2 × 800 kW generators were replaced with the current power plant's 83 MW generators. The generators were commissioned in 1990 after the political situation in the country calmed. However, two of the generators were not commissioned correctly and the turbines suffered from severe cavitation. New spillway gates were installed between 1989 and 1990 after they were removed in 1988 because of the Iran–Iraq War. During the war, the spillway and substation were damaged from bombing. The power station was damaged from bombing in 1990 as well. In 2007, the World Bank began a US$35.36 million project to repair the Darbandikhan and Dokan Dams. Repairs to the Darbandikhan Dam cost $18.85 million and were completed in 2013 resulting in 100 percent power availability.  Design and operation  Looking down the spillway The dam is located within a gorge on a foundation of sedimentary rocks. It is a rock-fill embankment type with a central clay core. The dam is tall and long ( if the spillway section is included). Its crest is wide and at an elevation of . The structural volume of the dam including rock, clay and filters is . The dam collects water from a catchment area that covers . Its reservoir, by design, has a storage capacity of . Of that capacity, is active (or useful) storage while is dead storage. At a normal elevation of , the reservoir covers an area of . To protect the dam from flooding, it is equipped with a controlled chute spillway on its right bank. It is controlled by three x 15 m tainter gates. At the terminus of each chute there is a ski-jump to help dissipate energy. The maximum discharge capacity of the spillway is . The dam's power plant is located at its toe and contains 3 x 83 MW Francis turbine-generators. They are each afforded a rated hydraulic head of and can each discharge . Above the tail-race for each turbine is an irrigation outlet. Each of the three outlets can discharge up to downstream.

Rainbow Lodge was among the first built along the Pacific Great Eastern line, which as of 1915 opened from Squamish to Clinton, British Columbia and was one of several along the line as far as Lillooet where Craig Lodge was. . The Pacific Great Eastern Railway saw the benefits of having a resort in the mountains close to urban centres. In this way, Alex and Myrtle Philip, who built Rainbow Lodge in 1914, catered to the railway, visitors and loggers. They provided lodging and meals for patrons, and for travelling through traffic. Rainbow Lodge also served as the area's post office. Horse loggers were busy in the valley prior to the Second World War. By the 1940s, Rainbow Lodge had been enlarged to serve over 100 guests, and was the most popular camping lodge west of the Rocky Mountains.

The specimen — claimed by Hurum at the time to be a new species — had not received a taxonomic classification by the time of the television special and was, therefore, codenamed \\"Predator X\\". The team initially called their discovery \\"The Monster\\", and the nickname has been used extensively by the media. The initial discovery was made in 2006, as part of a find of dozens of pliosaur and plesiosaur specimens. At nearly 15 m (49 ft) in length, \\"The Monster\\" is the largest pliosaur skeleton ever discovered, considerably larger than Kronosaurus.\\"Fossil 'makes T-Rex look feeble'\\", news24.com, 17 March 2009. In 2012, it was given the taxonomic name Pliosaurus funkei.

The genus can be recognized by the combination of having nine antennal segments (fewer than most ants) and the petiole concealed by the gaster in dorsal view. They are sometimes called \\"rover ants\\". Distribution The genus has a mainly Neotropical distribution, ranging from the United States to Argentina and Chile, including the Caribbean islands, but some species have been introduced to Japan, and Madagascar. Description Brachymyrmex is a genus of minute ants that at first glance exhibit little morphological variation. Currently only the 9-segmented antennae and lack of antennal club have been proposed to diagnose workers of the genus. The combination of small size, soft metasoma, and the simple morphology makes observations and interpretation of morphological characters difficult. These difficulties impede taxonomic revisions and even led Creighton (1950) to call Brachymyrmex a \\"miserable little genus\\". Nevertheless, 44 species and 17 subspecies are currently assigned to Brachymyrmex. Taxonomy The first complete taxonomic revision of Brachymyrmex was published by Santschi (1923) and included 27 species and 15 subspecies and varieties. In this revision, Santschi (1923) recognized two subgenera: 1) Brachymyrmex sensu stricto (including most of the species) and 2) Bryscha (four species). Brachymyrmex sensu stricto contains species that have hairy legs, antennae without erect hairs and the second segment of the antennal funiculus much shorter that the first (= third antennal segment much shorter than the second). Bryscha species have legs and antennae with erect hairs and the second segment of the antennal funiculus is as long as or longer than the first. Unlike other species in the genus, two of the species of the subgenus Bryscha, Brachymyrmex pilipes and Brachymyrmex micromegas, have dimorphic workers. Ambiguity remains regarding the status of Bryscha. Brown (1973) provisionally synonymized it under Brachymyrmex and Bolton (1995, 2014) accepted this synonymy in his catalogues without substantiating the decision. A study towards a revision of the genus was published in 2019 by Ortiz- Sepuvelda et al., taking morphological and molecular factors into account to reorganize many species and subspecies into new boundaries.

Vol. 52 no. 10. p. 32. Retrieved July 18, 2019. The program is produced by Atlas Communications and hosted by Jim Howes, who uses the thousands of pipe organ and choral recordings in his personal collection, gathered from his travels around the world. Programs typically include music from such diverse locations as England, Germany, South Africa, Riga, Latvia, and Sydney, Australia, along with prominent church choirs and organists in the U.S. Live organ concerts are also sponsored and recorded for later broadcast, as in 2004 when celebrated organist Frederick Swann performed at the 88-rank organ of St. Paul's Anglican Church in Bermuda. Production Howes, who is former executive director of the Bermuda International Airport (2002-2007) and St. Petersburg-Clearwater International Airport (1980-2001), produces the program at WBVM's studios in Florida. When he was in Bermuda, he told the Bermuda Sun, several weeks' programs were pre-recorded at a time during trips to his home in Florida, using his personal library. Howes regularly gets emails from his audience in Europe, the Mideast, and the Philippines. Tom Derzypolski, then- vice president of WBVM-FM in Tampa, told the St. Petersburg Times in 1997 that the show is \\"extremely popular. Jim mixes some of the pieces that he picks up traveling around the world with some of the sacred classics. A lot of the selections that he broadcasts are literally not available. He provides a unique blend\\". Howes said he \\"enjoys conversing with the audience and providing sacred masterpieces performed at famous cathedrals and concert halls.\\" On location live recordings are also occasionally broadcast. Past venues have included the Cathedral of Saint John the Divine, New York, the Ocean Grove Auditorium in New Jersey, St. Paul's Anglican Church in Bermuda, and Brown Memorial Presbyterian Church in Baltimore, Maryland. History WBVM Station Manager John Morris (right) with Jim Howes, producer of Sacred Classics, at the Tampa studios Sacred Classics was initially two distinct programs, King of Instruments and Choral Masterpieces, both produced by Howes for the old WXCR beginning in 1983 and 1985, respectively. After production moved to WBVM in 1986, the current format combining choral and organ music was adopted and the program was expanded to two hours in length and retitled Sacred Classics. On the show's 25th anniversary broadcast in 2008, Frederick Swann, president of the American Guild of Organists, expressed the organization's \\"great debt of gratitude for the joy that Sacred Classics has brought untold thousands of listeners over the years\\".Sacred Classics, Atlas Communications, October 19, 2008. Premier of Bermuda Ewart Brown sent his \\"sincere congratulations\\", saying he \\"hopes Sacred Classics enjoys another 25 great years\\".

Gaard's academic work in the realms of ecocriticism and ecocomposition is widely cited by scholars in the disciplines of composition and literary criticism. Her theoretical work extending ecofeminist thought into queer theory, queer ecology, vegetarianism, and animal liberation has been influential within women's studies. A cofounder of the Minnesota Green Party, Gaard documented the transition of the U.S. Green movement into the Green Party of the United States in her book, Ecological Politics. She is currently a professor of English at University of Wisconsin-River Falls and a community faculty member in Women's Studies at Metropolitan State University, Twin Cities. Ecocriticism and ecocomposition Gaard has applied ecofeminist theory to both literary criticism and composition instruction, thereby contributing feminist insights to the emerging fields of ecocriticism and ecocomposition. Ecofeminist Literary Criticism: Theory, Interpretation, Pedagogy, edited by Gaard and Patrick D. Murphy, was the first anthology to examine not only how ecofeminist theory might enhance literary criticism but also how close reading of texts might inform ecofeminist theory and activist practice. This development in ecocriticism was welcomed by scholars who, along with Simon C. Estok, believe that \\"if ecocriticism is to have any effect outside of the narrow confines of academia, then it must not only define itself but also address the issue of values in ways that connect meaningfully with the non-academic world.\\"Estok, Simon C. \\"Bridging the Great Divide: Ecocritical Theory and the Great Unwashed.\\" ESC: English Studies in Canada 31:4 (December 2005), p. 197. Full text available (here ) Gaard's International Perspectives in Feminist Ecocriticism, co-edited by Gaard, Simon Estok, and Serpil Oppermann, updates the U.S.-based anthology, offering an international collection of scholarship that includes ecocritical theory, literary criticism, and ecocultural analyses, bringing a diversity of perspectives in terms of gender, sexuality, and race. Reconnecting with the histories of feminist and ecofeminist literary criticism, and utilizing new developments in postcolonial ecocriticism, animal studies, queer theory, feminist and gender studies, cross-cultural and international ecocriticism, this volume develops a continuing and international feminist ecocritical perspective on literature, language, and culture. Gaard's widely cited contribution to Ecocomposition: Theoretical and Practical Approaches similarly argues for the activist applications of scholarly theory, asserting that \\"at its most inclusive, ecocomposition has the potential to address social issues such as feminism, environmental ethics, multiculturalism, politics, and economics, all by examining matters of form and style, audience and argumentation, and reliable sources and documentation.\\"Gaard, Greta. \\"Ecofeminism and EcoComposition.\\" In Ecocomposition: Theoretical and Practical Approaches. Ed. Sid Dobrin and Christian Weisser. Albany: State University of New York Press, 2001, p. 163. Ecofeminist theory \\"One of the most influential ecofeminist scholars,\\"Dobrin, Sid and Christian Weisser. \\"Breaking New Ground in Ecocomposition. In Ecocomposition: Theoretical and Practical Approaches. Ed. Sid Dobrin and Christian Weisser. Albany: State University of New York Press, 2001, p. 6. Gaard has extended ecofeminist theory by mapping linkages with queer theory and by compiling ecofeminist ideas concerning vegetarianism and animal liberation. Prior to Gaard's germinal 1997 article, \\"Toward a Queer Ecofeminism,\\" published first in the scholarly journal Hypatia and then anthologized in Perspectives on Environmental Justice, Gender, Sexuality, and Activism, ecofeminism and queer theory were separate realms within feminism. As Gaard writes in her introduction to that piece, > Although many ecofeminists acknowledge heterosexism as a problem, a > systematic exploration of the potential intersections of ecofeminist and > queer theories has yet to be made. By interrogating social constructions of > the \\"natural,\\" the various uses of Christianity as a logic of domination, > and the rhetoric of colonialism, this essay finds those intersections and > argues for the importance of developing a queer ecofeminism.Gaard, Greta. > \\"Toward a Queer Ecofeminism.\\" Hypatia12:1(Winter 1997), p. 114. Full text > available (here.) Numerous scholars have since drawn upon that essay in formulating their theories.See, e.g., these books and articles citing that essay Gaard's 1993 anthology, Ecofeminism: Women, Animals, Nature also introduced new theoretical intersections. As Gaard noted in her introduction to the pieces collected in that work, \\"in the three anthologies published at the time of this writing, ecofeminism has failed to locate animals as central to any discussion of ethics involving women and nature.\\"Gaard, Greta. \\"Living Interconnections with Animals and Nature.\\" In Ecofeminism: Women, Animals, Nature Ed. Greta Gaard. Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1993. (Full text available here). Gaard followed up that anthology with a 2003 review of vegetarian ecofeminist thought.Gaard, Greta. \\"Vegetarian Ecofeminism: A Review Essay.\\" Frontiers 23:3(2003):117-146. (Full text available here.) Gaard's more recent scholarship has addressed \\"Literary Milk: Breastfeeding Across Race, Class, and Species\\" (2013) and \\"Postcolonial Milk Studies\\" (2013), \\"Indigenous Women and the Environmental Humanities\\" (2014), \\"Ecofeminism and Climate Change\\" (2015), \\"Feminism and Environmental Justice\\" (2017), \\"Ecofeminist Aesthetics\\"(2018), \\"Out of the Closets and Into the Climate! Queer Feminist Climate Justice\\" (2019) and a \\"Just Ecofeminist Sustainability\\" (2017). (Full texts available here.) As of 2017, her most recent monograph was Critical Ecofeminism, a volume rooted in and advancing articulations of Australian philosopher Val Plumwood's ecological feminism. Ecological politics As an activist, Gaard participated in the Green movement for more than a decade. In 1993, she was among the founders of the Minnesota Green Party. In 1994, she documented ecofeminist participation in the Greens in the video documentary, Thinking Green: Ecofeminists and the Greens. Gaard's 1998 book, Ecological Politics: Ecofeminists and the Greens, draws upon interviews with scores of participants to tell the story of the controversial transition of the Green movement into a national political party from multiple perspectives, concluding that > Ecofeminists can learn from the Greens and from the work of ecofeminists in > the Greens. A radically democratic movement for social and environmental > justice will be larger than ecofeminism and larger than the Greens. Yet we > can only bring about that movement by working with and through our > communities--and our communities will always be partial, unrepresentative, > incomplete. Only the coalition of a variety of progressive communities will > bring about the transformations needed to articulate a radical democracy, > and in that coalition, an ecofeminist vision will find expression.Gaard, > Greta. Ecological Politics: Ecofeminists and the Greens. Temple University > Press, 1998, p. 269. Creative and Critical writing Gaard also has published fiction, poetry, and creative nonfiction as well as critical essays in non-scholarly publications. Her 2007 book, The Nature of Home, collects several works of creative nonfiction centered on the question of ecological connections to and within places. With the COVID-19 pandemic, Gaard launched an \\"Open Letter to the Environmental Humanities\\" inviting scholars to commit to aligning their environmental scholarship with their behaviors and commit to limit flying, limit driving, and choosing to eat ethically, ecologically, and locally- sourced foods. The letter was signed and augmented by over 40 international scholars and is still open to signatures. The letter and a special cluster focusing on COVID-19 & Climate appeared in BifrostOnline's Spring 2020 issue here. Other activism Gaard was a member of the now-inactive Feminists for Animal Rights, publishing some essays in the FAR newsletter.E.g., Gaard, Greta. \\"The FAR Slide Show: Reactions from Minnesota Viewers.\\" Feminists for Animal Rights: An Ecofeminist Journal 11:3-4 (1999):1, 3. Other activism opposing anti-labor and anti-environment global trade policies at the World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle (1999), climate capitalism at the 350.Org-launched People's Climate March (2014), offering solidarity actions for the Water Protectors at Standing Rock (2017), and standing in continued opposition to Enbridge's Line 3 pipeline, which runs through untouched wetlands and the treaty territory of Anishinaabe peoples in Northern Minnesota (2014 to present), exemplify some of her eco-justice commitments.

It impounds the Little Zab, thereby creating Lake Dukan. The Dukan Dam was built between 1954 and 1959 whereas its power station became fully operational in 1979. The dam is long and high and its hydroelectric power station has a maximum capacity of 400 MW. Project history Emergency bell- mouth spillway The Dukan Dam was built between 1954 and 1959 as a multi- purpose dam to provide water storage, irrigation and hydroelectricity. The design for the dam was carried out by the British engineering company Binnie & Partners (with Partner and third generation Binnie engineer Geoffrey Binnie the key engineer). Additional structural analysis was done for Binnie by his friends at Imperial College, Professor Pippard and Letitia Chitty, who \\"developed a stress analysis technique using relaxation methods and a rubber model to verify the design form.\\" Prior to the flooding of Lake Dukan, the area was subjected to archaeological research to investigate as many archaeological sites as possible. An archaeological survey in the Ranya Plain documented some 40 archaeological sites with evidence for occupation ranging from the sixth millennium BCE up to the present. Five of these sites were then excavated: Tell Bazmusian, ed-Dem, Kamarian, Qarashina and Tell Shemshara. The excavations at Tell Bazmusian revealed a temple dating to the second millennium BCE. At Tell Shemshara, an early-sixth millennium BCE village was excavated, as well as an early-second millennium BCE palace with a small archive of clay tablets. The inhabitants of some 50 villages in the flooded area, around 1,000–1,200 families, were resettled to the west of the lake. The power station was designed in 1973 by the Russian company Hydroproject and became operational in 1979. Due to lack of maintenance and repairs, the power station has underperformed and is now, after 30 years of service, due for replacement. In 2007, the World Bank began a US$40 million project to repair the Dokan and Darbandikhan Dams. Repairs to the Dokan Dam are expected to cost over $8 million and be complete in late 2012. Characteristics of the dam Newly installed Italian made control unit for turbine 1 installed 2010 The Dukan Dam is a multi-purpose concrete arch dam abutted by gravity monoliths. It is long and high. At its base it is wide, tapering off to at the top. The combined maximum discharge of the dam is per second. This is divided over a spillway tunnel with three radial gates having a combined maximum discharge of per second, and an emergency bellmouth spillway with a capacity of per second. Two irrigation outlets with a combined discharge of per second have not been operated over the last ten years. The powerhouse of five Francis units at 80 MW each releases between per second.

Many subgroups of those can be further distinguished, based on religion, location and language. According to one 2005 estimate, there are at least twenty distinguishable groups of largely varying size. Major groups Wolof of Cayor (1890 engraving) *The largest group is the Wolof, representing 43.3% of the population of the country. They live predominantly in the west, having descended from the kingdoms of Cayor, Waalo and Jolof that once existed in that area. Their population is focused in large urban centres. Most are Muslim, being either Mouride or Tijānī. The Lebou people of Cap-Vert and Petite Côte are considered a subgroup of the Wolof, however they represent less than 1% of its population. The prevalence of the Wolof both linguistically and politically has continued to increase throughout the years; this tendency has been called the \\"wolofisation\\" of Senegal. *The Fula, those who speak the Fula language, are the second most populous group, representing 23.8% of the country's population. This figure includes the Toucouleurs, but according to surveys, this subgroup is sometimes considered separate from the Fula. They were Islamized very early. The territory inhabited by the Fula is larger than that of the Wolof, however many areas are sparsely populated, such as Ferlo, Kolda, the Senegal River Valley, and Badiar. Traditionally nomadic, the vast majority has become sedentary, although there is a current rural exodus. Since Ahmed Sékou Touré became president of Guinea, many Guinean Fula have immigrated to Senegal, particularly from Fouta Djallon. *The third group is the Serer, who represent 14.7% of the national population. Serer pre- colonial kingdoms included : the Kingdom of Sine, Kingdom of Saloum, Biffeche and previously the Kingdom of Baol (ruled by the Joof family). Serer medieval history is characterized by resisting Islamization from the 11th century (during the Almoravids' advance) to the 19th century (the Marabout wars of Senegambia), resulting in the Battle of Fandane-Thiouthioune, commonly known as the Battle of Somb. The Serer anti-French movement during the colonial era resulted in the Battle of Logandème. The Serer people includes, but not limited to : the Saafi, Ndut, Laalaa, Niominka, Palor, etc. Many of these speak the Cangin languages. On the way to a boukout in Baïla in Jola country *Avenue du Senegal in Tyre, LebanonThe Jola represent 5% of the country's population, and mostly live in Ziguinchor where they primarily make their living from rice cultivation and fishing. Traditionally animist, they have historically resisted the spread of both Islam and Christianity in the country. While much of the Jola population now adheres to either Islam or Christianity, many mix these religions with animist beliefs. The Jola hold their ethnic distinctiveness as of great importance. *Other groups also live in the Ziguinchor Region. While these groups lead lifestyles that are very similar to the Jola, they speak different languages and are much less populous. This is the case of the Bainuk, the Balanta, the Manjack, the Mankanya, the Karoninka, and the Bandial. *Several small ethnic groups in Senegal are related to the Mandinka, together constituting 4% of the population of the country. These include the Malinké, the Sossé, the Bambara, the Dyula, the Yalunka, and the Jakhanke. *The Soninke represent 0.5% of the population of Senegal. While most of the Soninke live in Mali, some live on the other side of the border, along the Falémé and Sénégal Rivers. This group has been experiencing a significant diaspora. The Soninke were Islamized earlier than most other groups in the country. Bedick girls in Iwol Senegalese boy in Gore Island A few Bassari and Bedick live in the hills in eastern Senegal around Kédougou. These are subgroups of the Tenda, same as the Coniagui and the Badiaranké. *Senegal has among its population many Africans from other countries. There are small Ivorian communities in Dakar, as well as many Nigerians, most of which being Hausa. Malians go almost unnoticed in Senegal because their culture is so similar to that of the Senegalese. There is a large Cape Verdean community in Dakar. Moors, constituting 0.5% of the population of Senegal, have long invested in business in the country, residing mainly in cities in the north. The subgroup of the Darmankour, who have lived in Senegal for centuries, are present throughout the country. Europeans and descendants of Lebanese migrants are fairly numerous in urban centres in Senegal, about 50,000. Most of the Lebanese originate from the Southern Lebanese city of Tyre, which is known as \\"Little West Africa and has a main promenade that is called \\"Avenue du Senegal\\". Minor groups There are also many other smaller representations of other ethnic groups in Senegal, including the Khassonké, the Lawbe and the Papel. There are also small Chinese and Vietnamese migrant communities. Commonality The predominant ethnic groups in Senegal share a common cultural background so that, apart from their languages that also have many similarities, there are no effective cultural barriers between them. This is why marriage between ethnic groups in Senegal is so common.

In her professional capacity, Baniecka was a long-time member of the Warsaw chapter of the Association of Polish Artists and Designers (ZPAP). Slownik Biograficzny, Artysci plastycy okregu warszawskiego ZPAP 1945-1970. Life Born fifteen years after her parents' wedding, Zofia Baniecka was the only child of a sculptor father and a teacher mother from Warsaw. Her parents were not religious but she went to a Catholic school. She then studied at the Warsaw University, before the Nazi German and Soviet invasion of Poland. Zofia had many Jewish friends from assimilated homes just like her own intellectually inclined parents. In late 1940 the Nazi occupiers ordered the family to relocate when their home fell within the boundaries of the newly established Warsaw Ghetto. All three family members began to work for the Polish underground. Zofia's inconspicuous grey-haired mother was transporting weapons in her shopping bag for the Resistance, while Zofia's father smuggled food and books to friends in the Ghetto. Thanks to help from their underground contacts, the family soon moved to a large apartment with four rooms and a kitchen — near the walls of the ghetto — and began taking in Jewish refugees. The apartment was divided by curtains with a different Jewish family behind each one. Nobody was ever refused: friends, strangers, acquaintances. Zofia got involved with the underground press and also, helped the Jewish Committee find hiding places for the children. As a courier, she distributed underground newspapers and relayed orders around the General Government.Rochelle L. Millen, Jack Mann, Timothy Bennett, New Perspectives on the Holocaust page 256, NYU Press 1996 Even though in 1941 Zofia's father was killed in a Soviet air-strike on Warsaw — from winter of 1941 till August 1944 (when the Warsaw Uprising started) — the two women managed to rescue at least fifty (50) Jews in their home, including a family of ten, escaping the Ghetto firestorm in April 1943 following the failed Ghetto Uprising. When their house was full, the Banieckis helped Jews find other places to hide. After the Soviet takeover of Poland at the end of World War II, Zofia was arrested by the Communist authorities as a member of Resistance but she was ultimately released. She got married. Years later, with her husband, Baniecka got involved with the anticommunist Komitet Obrony Robotników (KOR), undeterred by the threat of repressions. Ultimately, she also became an active participant in the Polish Solidarity movement of the 1980s.

References and accounts of playing exist to 1949 or earlier. The batter would throw a rubber/tennis ball at the edge of the step or angled wall brick, and the fielder(s) would try to catch the ball as it bounces back. The ball used was a two and a half-inch hollow pink soft rubber ball called a \\"Pinky,\\" that bounced well off the edges of steps. Baseball gloves were not allowed. The scoring rules is similar to baseball, but with runs being virtual determined by where the ball lands. A single, double, triple or home run would be predetermined landmarks (i.e. sidewalk, trees, cars, street, curb/sidewalk lines) from the batting area. A catch is an out, and a one-handed catch could be used for a \\"rushie.\\" As with most neighborhood games, rules varied by the groups playing and house rules would be determined at the start of the game, including the base locations. The game utilizes traditional Chicago neighborhood row house architecture, with most houses (Chicago Bungalow style) having front stairs or a stoop that leads from the front door to the sidewalk. Many of the schools built in Chicago have a horizontal perfectly angled section of decorative brick, at the right height, that was used for the game. * NOTE: The batter's box painted on building or school walls with an X marking was used for “Fast Pitch” another local school-yard game.  Name Variants  Here are specific personal testimonies about name variants by players in various neighborhoods previously deleted from this entry but all of which are very much accurate and relevant. The universal name for the game throughout the city was called \\"Pinners.\\" * Some North Siders referred to the game as Ledge. * In 1949 at Fiske Elementary, it was called (pronounced) Penner, without the plural s. * In the area near South Shore High School, the game was known as Pinnard or Pinnerd in the 1960s. * Bounce Out * 3 Outs  Terminology  *Double Play; A play in which the fielder catches the ball creating an out, the fielder may throw or lob the ball so that it bounces once on a step that is parallel to the ground. The fielder may move to catch the ball after the throw. The fielder who did not catch the ball for the original out may move before the ball has been thrown in order to catch the ball for another out. The throw to the step may hit the part of the step that is parallel to ground once, but may hit a part of the step that is perpendicular to the ground as well, the ball, however, is a dead-ball if on the throw it bounces off a backstop before being caught again. *Rush Hour; A play in which the ball is out of play, either by foul ball, home run, or a misplay by the fielder, the fielder must throw the ball to the batter from where he stands or the batter may call stalling if the fielder is walking before he has thrown it in. *Rushies: A one-handed catch, leading to an automatic three outs. The player catching the ball with one hand is allowed to run towards the batter's box and throw the ball while the opposing team is in transition from offense to defense. *Stalling; When called the batting team is awarded a single without the batter, who would be up, having to sacrifice their turn in the order.

Synapheas have variably shaped leaves but consistently yellow flowers with an unusual pollination mechanism. Description Plants in the genus Synaphea are small shrubs, usually with deeply lobed (pinnatipartite) leaves, although some have simple leaves, others pinnate leaves, and have a petiole with a sheathing base. The flowers are relatively small, bright yellow, usually unscented, and arranged in a spike in leaf axils or on the ends of branchlets. The perianth is tube-shaped and zygomorphic, the tube opening in the upper third to half. As in many other members of the Proteaceae, the male anthers and female style are initially in contact and the end of the style is a pollen presenter. In synapheas (and in Conospermum), the anthers and stigma are held together under tension and only separate when touched by a pollinator, ejecting the pollen. The fruit is a hard-shelled nut, but in most species seed set is low. Taxonomy The genus Synaphea was first formally described in 1810 by Robert Brown in Transactions of the Linnean Society of London. The first species Brown described was Synaphea favosa and it is therefore the type species. The name Synaphea is from the ancient Greek word synaphe meaning \\"a connection\\" or \\"a union\\", referring to a connection between a sterile anther and the stigma. =Species= The following is a list of formally named Synaphea species and subspecies accepted by the Australian Plant Census as at April 2020: *Synaphea acutiloba Meisn. \\\\- granite synaphea *Synaphea aephynsa A.S.George *Synaphea bifurcata A.S.George *Synaphea boyaginensis A.S.George *Synaphea brachyceras R.Butcher *Synaphea canaliculata A.S.George *Synaphea cervifolia A.S.George *Synaphea constricta A.S.George *Synaphea cuneata A.S.George *Synaphea damopsis A.S.George *Synaphea decorticans Lindl. *Synaphea decumbens A.S.George *Synaphea diabolica R.Butcher *Synaphea divaricata (Benth.)

Gould, a statistician and epidemiologist,Jay M. Gould Dies at 90; Warned of A-Plant Risks Benjamin A. Goldman, and Ernest Sternglass. The \\"shoestring organization\\" with \\"offices mainly on [Joseph J. Mangano's] kitchen table\\" was established to examine the relationships between low-level nuclear radiation and public health and question the safety of nuclear power. As of November 2010, Radiation and Public Health Project members have published 27 medical journal articles on health risks from radioactive exposures to nuclear reactors and weapons tests. RPHP studies have claimed elevated rates of childhood, thyroid, and other cancers near reactors. According to a 2003 article in The New York Times, the group's work has been controversial, and had little credibility with the scientific establishment. Similarly the work of the Radiation and Public Health Project has been criticized by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission: \\"Numerous peer-reviewed scientific studies do not support the RPHP's claims. NRC finds there is little or no credibility in the RHP's studies\\". In an April 2014 article in Popular Science, Sarah Epstein referred to the group's work as \\"junk science\\" and disputed the group's peer-reviewed publications as being insufficiently evaluated.  Baby teeth  A set of 85,000 teeth that had been collected by Dr. Louise Reiss and her colleagues as part of the Baby Tooth Survey were uncovered in 2001 and given to the Radiation and Public health Project. By tracking the individuals who had participated in the tooth- collection project, the RHPR published results in a 2010 issue of the International Journal of Health Service that claimed that those children who later died of cancer before the age of 50 had levels of strontium 90 in their stored baby teeth that was twice the level of those who were still alive at 50.Hevesi, Dennis. \\"Dr. Louise Reiss, Who Helped Ban Atomic Testing, Dies at 90\\", The New York Times, January 10, 2011. Accessed January 10, 2011.Wald, Matthew L. \\"Study of Baby Teeth Sees Radiation Effects\\", The New York Times, December 13, 2010. Accessed January 10, 2011. This paper was criticized by Stephen Musolino, a health physicist and specialist in radiation protection at Brookhaven National Laboratory, as it \\"confuses correlation with causation\\" and in their opinion the authors of the paper are \\"ice-cream epidemiologists\\".Decades later, Baby Tooth Survey legacy lives on By JEFFREY TOMICH Aug 1, 2013. St.Louis Post-Dispatch RPHP studied 5,000 baby teeth, the results of which were published in 5 medical journal articles. High and rising levels of strontium-90 in baby teeth were found near reactors. The National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Nuclear Regulatory Commission and nuclear industry groups responded with statements that the study was flawed. The groups stated that the study suffered from small sample sizes; no control populations; no other cancer risk factors considered; no environmental sampling and analysis; cherry picking of data to fit the conclusion; and an incorrect half-life used for strontium-90. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has not changed its opinion that there is no excess cancer risk from living near nuclear facilities. Leukemia study This study was published in a 2008 issue of the European Journal of Cancer Care. It disputes a large scale analysis conducted by the National Cancer Institute in the late 1980s. Mangano and Sherman's study found that leukemia death rates in U.S. children near nuclear reactors rose sharply (vs. the national trend) in the past two decades. The greatest mortality increases occurred near the oldest nuclear plants, while declines were observed near plants that closed permanently in the 1980s and 1990s. Other studies in the US and UK have shown decreases in cancer incidence in the vicinity of nuclear power plants after they have started operating.  Fukushima  After the Fukushima disaster, Mangano and Sherman published several articles claiming detrimental health effects in America caused by fallout from Japan: In a June 2011 article in CounterPunch, they claimed a 35% increase in infant mortality on the West coast of the United States in the 10 weeks after the disaster, vs the 4 weeks prior. Michael Moyer of Scientific American stated that their claims are \\"critically flawed—if not deliberate mistruths\\", pointing out that this increase only appears when choosing these specific time periods, and there is no trend in the overall numbers for the year. In January 2012, they claimed that fallout from Fukushima resulted in 13,983 excess deaths in the United States in the 14 weeks following the disaster. This study was criticized for including different numbers of cities in the \\"before\\" and \\"after\\" categories, for cities with more fallout being reported as having fewer deaths, and for there being no plausible mechanism by which very small amounts of radiation could result in immediate death. In a March 2013 article, published in the Open Journal of Pedriatrics, they claimed a 16% increase in cases of congenital hypothyroidism (CH) in 5 US states in the 10 months following the disaster. This study was criticized for again creating a \\"trend\\" out of random statistical variation and using incorrect definitions of CH based only on TSH scores. The publisher of the journal the paper appeared in, Scientific Research Publishing, has been accused of being a predatory open access publisher.

Famous examples such as Jews throughout Europe even at times when discrimination against them was high, Chinese throughout Southeast Asia, Muslims and Parsis in India, Igbos in Nigeria, Indians in East Africa, Lebanese in West Africa, and many others. Middleman minorities usually provide an economic benefit to communities and nations and often start new industries. However, their economic aptitude, financial success and clannishness, combined with social prejudices by other groups against businesses and moneylending, can cause resentment among the native population of a country. Middleman minorities can be victims of violence, genocide, racialist policy, or other forms of repression. Other ethnic groups often accuse them of plotting conspiracies against their nation or of stealing wealth from the native population.

(Tom) Heaton is an American seismologist, known for his influential contributions in earthquake source physics and earthquake early warning. Currently he is the professor of geophysics and civil engineering at Caltech and one of the world’s leading experts on seismology. Biography Tom Heaton received his B.S. from Indiana University in 1972, and Ph.D. from Caltech in 1978. He wrote his Ph.D. thesis on ray theory and its application to seismology, under the supervision of seismologist Don Helmberger. After graduation, Heaton joined the USGS in 1979. There he worked as a research geophysicist in their Pasadena office from 1979 until July 1995, at which time he was the USGS project chief of the Southern California Seismic Network. He was the scientist in charge of the USGS Pasadena office from 1985 until October 1992 and he was also the coordinator of the USGS earthquake program in southern California. Heaton returned to Caltech in 1995 where he resumed the post of the professor of geophysics and civil engineering. Heaton is married and has three children. Research Heaton's research has principally focused on seismology and earthquake physics, with emphasis on earthquake rupture dynamics, earthquake early warning and strong ground motion. He is perhaps best known in the scientific community for his several contributions in source inversions and specially his influential 1990 paper \\"Evidence for and Implications of self healing pulses of slip in earthquakes\\", where he clearly provided evidence for the existence of another mode of rupture for earthquakes; namely the pulse like mode, other than the widely accepted crack like model that was adopted at that time. This paper triggered a new way for earthquake scientists to look at earthquake ruptures. =Strong ground motion= Heaton's work is aimed at a more complete understanding of the nature of ground shaking close to large earthquakes. That is, ground motions from large earthquakes are simulated by propagating waves through 3-dimensional earth structure models. The models produce realistic estimates of the large displacements (several meters in several seconds) that occur in great earthquakes. While accelerations that are associated with these large displacements may not be large enough to cause failure of strong, shear-wall structures, they may cause severe deformations in flexible buildings that rely heavily on ductility for their performance in large earthquakes. Heaton's group work in that field focuses on investigating the potential performance of steel moment-resisting-frame buildings and base-isolated buildings in large subduction zone earthquakes. =Earthquake rupture physics and crustal stress= Heaton is particularly interested in understanding the origins of spatially heterogeneous slip in earthquakes. There is compelling evidence that slip in earthquakes and stress in the earth’s crust are spatially heterogeneous, and perhaps fractal. Several approaches are being pursued in his group to understand the dynamic properties of this system. One of the approaches is the 3D finite element modeling for regions in the crust with ruptures occurring on fault planes controlled by dynamic friction and looking for conditions that are required to sustain the observed heterogeneous characteristics of stress and slip in cycles of earthquakes. On the other hand, Heaton was among the first to recognize that the heterogeneity in the crust could be modeled by 3D fractal tensors models for stress. With Deborah E. Smith, they generated those fractal stress tensors and used them to produce catalogs of earthquake locations and focal mechanisms. They could explain several field observations with this model. Also the model predicts that the strength of the crust should be a scale dependent property, a topic which is currently being further investigated in Heaton's group. =Earthquake warning systems= Heaton was initially interested in earthquake prediction. However, one of the implications of his now accepted pulse like model for earthquake ruptures is that predicting when an earthquake is going to happen is very difficult if not impossible. This is because it does not require that the background stress on the fault plane to be uniformly high everywhere in order to initiate rupture as pulse like ruptures can propagate in relatively low background stress. Accordingly, stresses need only to be high at isolated locations which may not be accessible to direct observation as those locations are not apriori known. However, the pulse like rupture mode has an inherent merit; it implies that the slip at any point ceases within a short period of time after the passage of the rupture front at this location and long before the whole earthquake stops. Since scaling relations between slip and total rupture length exist, the pulse like model implies that it may be possible to predict, at least in a probabilistic sense, how long the earthquake rupture could be once the slip values at some points are recorded and in the pulse like model we can have information about final slip values shortly after the initiation of rupture. This opens new premises in the field of earthquake early warnings. The virtual seismologist, which is an innovative earthquake early warning technique, is an example of the achievements of Heaton's group in that field. Publications Heaton has written on topics in seismology, earthquake physics, earthquake early warning and building vibrations. In 1990 he wrote his influential paper on evidence for and implications of pulse like ruptures in real earthquakes. The view before that time was that earthquakes propagate as shear cracks on fault planes in the earth crust. In this crack like models, each point on the fault continues to slip for a substantial part of the total duration of the earthquake. Once the point starts to slip, it will continue to do that until waves are reflected back from the ends of the fault carrying information that the earthquake has already reached its full rupture length. By studying slip inversions of several real earthquakes, Heaton came to the conclusion that the crack like view is not always true. On the contrary, he found that the slip duration at any point on the fault usually does not exceed one tenth of the total earthquake time. This implies that the rupture heals shortly after its initiation at any point and he provided examples of possible physical mechanisms that can result in this early healing. Heaton's view was faced by a huge controversy but it triggered a lot of research to test his model. Numerous analytical, numerical and experimental work have been done in the subsequent years that showed supporting evidence for Heaton's model. Pulse like mode of rupture is now a widely accepted model and it is sometimes even called Heaton Pulses honoring Heaton's contribution in that field.

The typical bush ballad employs a straightforward rhyme structure to narrate a story, often one of action and adventure, and uses language that is colourful, colloquial and idiomatically Australian. Bush ballads range in tone from humorous to melancholic, and many explore themes of Australian folklore, including bushranging, droving, droughts, floods, life on the frontier, and relations between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. The tradition dates back to the beginnings of European settlement when colonists, mostly British and Irish, brought with them the folk music of their homelands. Many early bush poems originated in Australia's convict system, and were transmitted orally rather than in print. It evolved into a unique style over the ensuing decades, attaining widespread popularity in the late 19th and early 20th centuries when it was thought by many Australians to convey \\"an authentic expression of the national spirit\\".Bush ballads, Australian Poetry Library. Retrieved 21 March 2016. Through bush poetry, publications like The Bulletin sought to define and promote mateship, egalitarianism, anti- authoritarianism and a concern for the \\"battler\\" as quintessential Australian values. Though the style has since declined in popularity, works from the period leading up to Federation remain among the best-known and loved poems in Australia, and \\"bush bards\\" such as Henry Lawson and Banjo Paterson are regarded as giants of Australian literature. Clubs and festivals devoted to bush poetry can be found throughout the country, and the tradition lives on in Australian country music. Characteristics The songs tell personal stories of life in the wide open country of Australia. Typical subjects include mining, raising and droving cattle, sheep shearing, wanderings, war stories, the 1891 Australian shearers' strike, class conflicts between the landless working class and the squatters (landowners), and bushrangers such as Ned Kelly, as well as love interests and more modern fare such as trucking. Although not technically bush ballads, there are also numerous sea shanties formerly sung by whalers and other sailors, as well as songs about the voyage made by convicts and other immigrants from England to Australia, which are sung in a similar style. While subject matter may be constant, musical styles differ between traditional and contemporary bush ballads. Exemplars of the traditional bush ballad style include Slim Dusty's When the Rain Tumbles Down in July or Leave Him in the Long yard which have strong narrative in verses plus choruses set to a Pick n' Strum beat. Contemporary bush ballads may employ finger picking and strumming rock styles. History First page of \\"The Dying Stockman,\\" a bush ballad published in Banjo Paterson's 1905 collection The Old Bush Songs Australia's musical traditions include the English, Scottish, and Irish folk songs of the convicts, as well as the work of pastoral poets of the 1880s.Heart of Country 19 February 2002 Australian Broadcasting Corporation http://www.abc.net.au/tv/documentaries/stories/s454792.htmSydney by Sally O'Brien page 24 Lonely planet guidebook https://books.google.com/books?id=dnUYVikeJwYC&pg;=PA24&dq;=bush+songs#PPA24,M1 There was also a hymn singing tradition brought by missionaries in the 19th century.Kerry O'Brien 10 December 2003 7:30 Report http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2003/s1007523.htm and the convict songs of those incarcerated on the island. The represent attempts to European cultural forms to the Australian environment. The distinctive themes and origins of Australia's bush music can be traced to the songs sung by the convicts who were sent to Australia during the early period of the British colonisation, beginning in 1788. Early Australian ballads sing of the harsh ways of life of the epoch and of such people and events as bushrangers, swagmen, drovers, stockmen and shearers. Convict and bushranger verses often railed against government tyranny. Classic bush songs on such themes include: The Wild Colonial Boy, Click Go The Shears, The Eumeralla Shore, The Drover's Dream, The Queensland Drover, The Dying Stockman and Moreton Bay. Later themes which endure to the present include the experiences of war, of droughts and flooding rains, of Aboriginality and of the railways and trucking routes which link Australia's vast distances. Isolation and loneliness of life in the Australian bush has been another theme. For much of its history, Australia's bush music belonged to an oral and folkloric tradition, and was only later published in print in volumes such as banjo Paterson's Old Bush Songs, in the 1890s. The songs often discuss the hardscrabble life and struggles of the Aussie battler. The songs are often ironic and humorous as with Beautiful Land of Australia chorus: The lyrics for \\"Waltzing Matilda\\", often regarded as Australia's unofficial national anthem, were composed by Banjo Paterson in 1895. This strain of Australian country music, with lyrics focusing on strictly Australian subjects, is generally known as \\"bush music\\" or \\"bush band music\\". The ballad genre continued in Australia after popular music took hold in Great Britain. \\"The oral ballad tradition centered on rural areas had been dying out in England for a generation as a consequence of the land clearances, industrialisation and urbanisation, found a new lease of life in the Australian bush, and one suspects that these traditional and reworked ballads were also sung in the early \\"free and easys.\\" While popular music in England had begun to develop in the working-class music halls during the 1830s and 1840s, the spread of popular music in Australia was still in its infancy.\\"Producing an Australian popular music: from Stephen Foster to Jack O'Hagan Stratton, Jon 1 January 2007 Journal of Australian Studies The diversity in Australia has increased, but even in the 1920s Poncie Cubillo introduced the rondalla with their Filipino string band in Darwin.\\"...he had established the first band of any note in Darwin the Cubillo Brothers...Mixed Relations By Regina Ganter, Julia Martinez, Martínez Fernández, p. 43 https://books.google.com/books?id=e2CEwLi684wC&pg;=RA1-PA44&dq;=Poncie+cubillo#PRA1-PA43,M1 The ballad tradition has grown to include some of these influences including Chinese and Filipino. There were also the Italians growing tobacco, the de Bortoli family, in \\"Texas in Queensland\\", adding to the amalgam of folk tunes and Tex Morton hillbilly tunes. Morton, a country music singer originally from New Zealand, released a number of Australian-themed 78s between 1936 and 1943 (including \\"Dying Duffer's Prayer,\\" \\"Murrumbridgee Jack,\\" \\"Billy Brink The Shearer,\\" \\"Stockman's Last Bed,\\" \\"Wrap Me Up in My Stockwhip and Blanket,\\" \\"Rocky Ned (The Outlaw),\\" and \\"Ned Kelly Song\\"), which can be considered to have been inspired by the bush ballad tradition. However, Morton sang without an Australian accent and his yodeling style was closer to that of the American singer Jimmie Rodgers than earlier Australian folk singers. Later influences from American cowboy and country songs and 1950s rock 'n' roll led to the performance of bush ballads being influenced by and combined with these forms. With the advance of technology and mass communications, the bush ballads were joined on the modern Australian music scene by rockabilly, country music, blues, Texas swing, bluegrass, trail songs, and country pop. Country and folk artists including Slim Dusty, Stan Coster, Rolf Harris, The Bushwackers, John Williamson, Graeme Connors and John Schumann of the band Redgum have continued to record and popularise the old bush ballads of Australia through the 20th and into the 21st century - and contemporary artists including Sara Storer and Lee Kernaghan draw heavily on this heritage. Ashley Cook, a contemporary balladeer, sings about topics relevant to life in agriculture and mining work in Australia's outback: Cattle, Dust and Leather and Blue Queensland Dogs.

The most common symptoms of overdose include central nervous system (CNS) depression, impaired balance, ataxia, and slurred speech. Severe symptoms include coma and respiratory depression. Supportive care is the mainstay of treatment of benzodiazepine overdose. There is an antidote, flumazenil, but its use is controversial. Death from single-drug benzodiazepine overdoses occur infrequently, particularly after the point of hospital admission. However, combinations of high doses of benzodiazepines with alcohol, barbiturates, opioids or tricyclic antidepressants are particularly dangerous, and may lead to severe complications such as coma or death. In 2013, benzodiazepines were involved in 31% of the estimated 22,767 deaths from prescription drug overdose in the United States. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has subsequently issued a black box warning regarding concurrent use of benzodiazepines and opioids. Benzodiazepines are one of the most highly prescribed classes of drugs, and they are commonly used in self-poisoning. Over 10 years in the United Kingdom, 1512 fatal poisonings have been attributed to benzodiazepines with or without alcohol. Temazepam was shown to be more toxic than the majority of benzodiazepines. An Australian (1995) study found oxazepam less toxic and less sedative, and temazepam more toxic and more sedative, than most benzodiazepines in overdose. Signs and symptoms Following an acute overdose of a benzodiazepine the onset of symptoms is typically rapid with most developing symptoms within 4 hours. Patients initially present with mild to moderate impairment of central nervous system function. Initial signs and symptoms include intoxication, somnolence, diplopia, impaired balance, impaired motor function, anterograde amnesia, ataxia, and slurred speech. Most patients with pure benzodiazepine overdose will usually only exhibit these mild CNS symptoms. Paradoxical reactions such as anxiety, delirium, combativeness, hallucinations, and aggression can also occur following benzodiazepine overdose. Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and vomiting have also been occasionally reported. Cases of severe overdose have been reported and symptoms displayed might include prolonged deep coma or deep cyclic coma, apnea, respiratory depression, hypoxemia, hypothermia, hypotension, bradycardia, cardiac arrest, and pulmonary aspiration, with the possibility of death. Severe consequences are rare following overdose of benzodiazepines alone but the severity of overdose is increased significantly if benzodiazepines are taken in overdose in combination with other medications. Significant toxicity may result following recreation drug misuse in conjunction with other CNS depressants such as opioids or alcohol. The duration of symptoms following overdose is usually between 12 and 36 hours in the majority of cases. The majority of drug-related deaths involve misuse of heroin or other opioids in combination with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressant drugs. In most cases of fatal overdose it is likely that lack of opioid tolerance combined with the depressant effects of benzodiazepines is the cause of death. The symptoms of an overdose such as sleepiness, agitation and ataxia occur much more frequently and severely in children. Hypotonia may also occur in severe cases. Toxicity The top line represents the number of benzodiazepine deaths that also involved opioids in the US. The bottom line represents benzodiazepine deaths that did not involve opioids. Benzodiazepines have a wide therapeutic index and taken alone in overdose rarely cause severe complications or fatalities. More often than not, a patient who inadvertently takes more than the prescribed dose will simply feel drowsy and fall asleep for a few hours. Benzodiazepines taken in overdose in combination with alcohol, barbiturates, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants, or sedating antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, or antihistamines are particularly dangerous. Additionally, emergency department visits involving benzodiazepines compared to other sedative-hypnotics have much higher odds of hospitalization, patient transfer, or death. In the case of alcohol and barbiturates, not only do they have an additive effect but they also increase the binding affinity of benzodiazepines to the benzodiazepine binding site, which results in a very significant potentiation of the CNS and respiratory depressant effects. In addition, the elderly and those with chronic illnesses are much more vulnerable to lethal overdose with benzodiazepines. Fatal overdoses can occur at relatively low doses in these individuals. =Comparability= The various benzodiazepines differ in their toxicity since they produce varying levels of sedation in overdose. A 1993 British study of deaths during the 1980s found flurazepam and temazepam more frequently involved in drug-related deaths, causing more deaths per million prescriptions than other benzodiazepines. Flurazepam, now rarely prescribed in the United Kingdom and Australia, had the highest fatal toxicity index of any benzodiazepine (15.0), followed by temazepam (11.9), versus benzodiazepines overall (5.9), taken with or without alcohol. An Australian (1995) study found oxazepam less toxic and less sedative, and temazepam more toxic and more sedative, than most benzodiazepines in overdose. An Australian study (2004) of overdose admissions between 1987 and 2002 found alprazolam, which happens to be the most prescribed benzodiazepine in the U.S. by a large margin, to be more toxic than diazepam and other benzodiazepines. They also cited a review of the Annual Reports of the American Association of Poison Control Centers National Data Collection System, which showed alprazolam was involved in 34 fatal deliberate self-poisonings over 10 years (1992–2001), compared with 30 fatal deliberate self-poisonings involving diazepam. In a New Zealand study (2003) of 200 deaths, Zopiclone, a benzodiazepine receptor agonist, had similar overdose potential as benzodiazepines. Pathophysiology Benzodiazepines bind to a specific benzodiazepine receptor, thereby enhancing the effect of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and causing CNS depression. In overdose situations this pharmacological effect is extended leading to a more severe CNS depression and potentially coma or cardiac arrest. Benzodiazepine-overdose-related coma may be characterised by an alpha pattern with the central somatosensory conduction time (CCT) after median nerve stimulation being prolonged and the N20 to be dispersed. Brain-stem auditory evoked potentials demonstrate delayed interpeak latencies (IPLs) I-III, III-V and I-V. Toxic overdoses of benzodiazepines therefore cause prolonged CCT and IPLs. Diagnosis The diagnosis of benzodiazepine overdose may be difficult, but is usually made based on the clinical presentation of the patient along with a history of overdose. Obtaining a laboratory test for benzodiazepine blood concentrations can be useful in patients presenting with CNS depression or coma of unknown origin. Techniques available to measure blood concentrations include thin layer chromatography, gas liquid chromatography with or without a mass spectrometer, and radioimmunoassay. Blood benzodiazepine concentrations, however, do not appear to be related to any toxicological effect or predictive of clinical outcome. Blood concentrations are, therefore, used mainly to confirm the diagnosis rather than being useful for the clinical management of the patient. Treatment Flumazenil is a benzodiazepine antagonist that can reverse the effects of benzodiazepines, although its use following benzodiazepine overdose is controversial. Medical observation and supportive care are the mainstay of treatment of benzodiazepine overdose. Although benzodiazepines are absorbed by activated charcoal, gastric decontamination with activated charcoal is not beneficial in pure benzodiazepine overdose as the risk of adverse effects would outweigh any potential benefit from the procedure. It is recommended only if benzodiazepines have been taken in combination with other drugs that may benefit from decontamination. Gastric lavage (stomach pumping) or whole bowel irrigation are also not recommended. Enhancing elimination of the drug with hemodialysis, hemoperfusion, or forced diuresis is unlikely to be beneficial as these procedures have little effect on the clearance of benzodiazepines due to their large volume of distribution and lipid solubility. =Supportive measures= Supportive measures include observation of vital signs, especially Glasgow Coma Scale and airway patency. IV access with fluid administration and maintenance of the airway with intubation and artificial ventilation may be required if respiratory depression or pulmonary aspiration occurs. Supportive measures should be put in place prior to administration of any benzodiazepine antagonist in order to protect the patient from both the withdrawal effects and possible complications arising from the benzodiazepine. A determination of possible deliberate overdose should be considered with appropriate scrutiny, and precautions taken to prevent any attempt by the patient to commit further bodily harm. Hypotension is corrected with fluid replacement, although catecholamines such as norepinephrine or dopamine may be required to increase blood pressure. Bradycardia is treated with atropine or an infusion of norepinephrine to increase coronary blood flow and heart rate. =Flumazenil= Flumazenil (Romazicon) is a competitive benzodiazepine receptor antagonist that can be used as an antidote for benzodiazepine overdose. Its use, however, is controversial as it has numerous contraindications. It is contraindicated in patients who are on long-term benzodiazepines, those who have ingested a substance that lowers the seizure threshold, or in patients who have tachycardia, widened QRS complex on ECG, anticholinergic signs, or a history of seizures. Due to these contraindications and the possibility of it causing severe adverse effects including seizures, adverse cardiac effects, and death, in the majority of cases there is no indication for the use of flumazenil in the management of benzodiazepine overdose as the risks in general outweigh any potential benefit of administration. It also has no role in the management of unknown overdoses. In addition, if full airway protection has been achieved, a good outcome is expected, and therefore flumazenil administration is unlikely to be required. Flumazenil is very effective at reversing the CNS depression associated with benzodiazepines but is less effective at reversing respiratory depression. One study found that only 10% of the patient population presenting with a benzodiazepine overdose are suitable candidates for flumazenil. In this select population who are naive to and overdose solely on a benzodiazepine, it can be considered. Due to its short half life, the duration of action of flumazenil is usually less than 1 hour, and multiple doses may be needed. When flumazenil is indicated the risks can be reduced or avoided by slow dose titration of flumazenil. Due to risks and its many contraindications, flumazenil should be administered only after discussion with a medical toxicologist. Epidemiology In a Swedish (2003) study benzodiazepines were implicated in 39% of suicides by drug poisoning in the elderly 1992–1996. Nitrazepam and flunitrazepam accounted for 90% of benzodiazepine implicated suicides. In cases where benzodiazepines contributed to death, but were not the sole cause, drowning, typically in the bath, was a common method used. Benzodiazepines were the predominant drug class in suicides in this review of Swedish death certificates. In 72% of the cases, benzodiazepines were the only drug consumed. Thus, many of deaths associated with benzodiazepine overdoses may not be a direct result of the toxic effects but either due to being combined with other drugs or used as a tool to complete suicide using a different method, e.g. drowning. In a Swedish retrospective study of deaths of 1987, in 159 of 1587 autopsy cases benzodiazepines were found. In 44 of these cases the cause of death was natural causes or unclear. The remaining 115 deaths were due to accidents (N = 16), suicide (N = 60), drug addiction (N = 29) or alcoholism (N = 10). In a comparison of suicides and natural deaths, the concentrations both of flunitrazepam and nitrazepam (sleeping medications) were significantly higher among the suicides. In four cases benzodiazepines were the sole cause of death. In Australia, a study of 16 deaths associated with toxic concentrations of benzodiazepines during the period of 5 years leading up to July 1994 found preexisting natural disease as a feature of 11 cases; 14 cases were suicides. Cases where other drugs, including ethanol, had contributed to the death were excluded. In the remaining five cases, death was caused solely by benzodiazepines. Nitrazepam and temazepam were the most prevalent drugs detected, followed by oxazepam and flunitrazepam. A review of self poisonings of 12 months 1976 - 1977 in Auckland, New Zealand, found benzodiazepines implicated in 40% of the cases. A 1993 British study found flurazepam and temazepam to have the highest number of deaths per million prescriptions among medications commonly prescribed in the 1980s. Flurazepam, now rarely prescribed in the United Kingdom and Australia, had the highest fatal toxicity index of any benzodiazepine (15.0) followed by Temazepam (11.9), versus 5.9 for benzodiazepines overall, taken with or without alcohol. Etizolam overdose deaths are rising - for instance, the National Records of Scotland report on drug-related deaths, implicated 548 deaths from 'street' Etizolam in 2018, almost double the number from 2017 (299) and only six years from the first recorded death (in 2012). The 548 deaths were 45% of all drug- related deaths in Scotland in 2018.

Nothing remains of the castle but an area of low scarps and shallow depressions.https://canmore.org.uk/site/47015/dunipace-herbertshire-castle Herbertshire is believed to have taken its name from one Herbert de Camera, who donated tracts of land in Dunipace to Cambuskenneth Abbey about the year 1200. During the time that Herbert made the donations to the Abbey, the lands fell within the jurisdiction of the barony of Dunipace. After the donations, Herbertshire became the principal barony that remained. It was located within the county of Stirling. This was the principal barony of Dunipace and Denny. At the time of the Wars of Scottish Independence it was known as the Barony of Dunipace and it was not until some time after these that the name Herbertshire emerged. https://www.thecastlesofscotland.co.uk/the-best-castles/other- articles/herbertshire/ In that early period the lairds of the barony were the de Morehams and, as his sons had both died in the Wars, Sir Thomas de Moreham, the last laird, was succeeded by his grand-daughter. She married John Gifford and they had four children - all girls. The youngest, Elizabeth, married John Douglas (1303-1350)https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Douglas-532, son of James, Lord Douglas, and the estate went to them during the reign of David II of Scotland (1324-1371). In their charter the name 'Herbertshire' is first found. John Douglas was killed by order of Sir David Barclay of Brechin some time before Shrove Tuesday in 1350. In 1369 the estate was in the hands of Archibald, Earl Douglas, and when his son, William, Lord of Nithsdale, married a daughter of King Robert II the lands were gifted to them. http://www.douglashistory.co.uk/history/Places/herbertshire.html#.XTX4JPJKiUk Their daughter married Henry Sinclair, Earl of Orkney and Lord of Rosslyn, and the estate passed to that couple in 1407. During the period of Sinclair ownership the castle was built. A charter of 1474 mentions the ‘lands and barony of Herbertshire with the castle and fortalice thereof’, the first reference to a castle on the site. The estate was bought by Alexander Livingstone, 1st Earl of Linlithgow in 1608. He then sold it to John Stirling, son of William Stirling of Achyle, in 1632. He was succeeded by William Stirling of Herbertshire (on record in the 1660s), George Stirling of Herbertshire (on record in the 1690s), and John Stirling of Herbertshire (d.1754)https://www.geni.com/people/Captain-John-Stirling-of-Belleville- Auchyll-and-Herbertshire/6000000012862242461. In 1768 his daughter Jean Stirling (1719–1797), wife of James Erskine, Lord Alva, sold the estate to William Morehead (1737–1793) a founder of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.http://www.motherbedford.com/Muirhead/Muirhead711.htm The castle remained in the Morehead family for two or more generations, until sold by another William Morehead https://www.myfamilysilver.com/crestfinder- search/morehead-family-crest in 1835 to William Forbes 2nd of Callendar, Conservative MP for Stirlingshire and son of William Forbes of Callendar, who had made his fortune from copper-bottoming ships for the Royal Navy. The castle remained in the Forbes family for the rest of its existence. For a period in the late nineteenth century it was a boarding schoolhttps://www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk/biography/?id=WH15745&type;=P, but it later returned to use as a residence for the Forbes family. The Castle suffered a tragic and catastrophic fire on 20 December 1914. The fire started before 5am, when the household was sound asleep. Most of the twenty-four occupants escaped. These included Mr and Mrs Charles William Forbes (4th of Callendar)http://lafayette.org.uk/for8283.html, the four Forbes daughters (Louise, Agnes, Margaret and Marion, aged 10 to 16) - after a dramatic rescue from the turret by ladder - and two maids who leaped across a 22 foot gap to an adjoining roof. However, three people died. Two of them were young guests, the sisters Cynthia Graham (14 years old) and Clare Graham (whose 16th birthday it was), visiting from nearby Airthrey Castle; their beautiful tomb can be found at Old Logie Kirk. The third was Mrs Forbes’s companion Rachel Littlejohn, the daughter of a distinguished Edinburgh professor. These three were occupying bedrooms on the top floors. No available ladder could reach them, and the windows were barred.Stirling Saturday Observer, 23 December 1914 https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/PBH19150303.2.89 Because of the castle's location on high ground, the blaze could be seen for many miles around.

Unequal Treatment: How African Americans have often been the unwitting victims of medical experiments The Washington Post, January 7, 2007. Synopsis Medical Apartheid traces the complex history of medical experimentation on Black Americans in the United States since the middle of the eighteenth century. Harriet Washington argues that \\"diverse forms of racial discrimination have shaped both the relationship between white physicians and black patients and the attitude of the latter towards modern medicine in general\\".Medical Apartheid: The Dark History of Medical Experimentation on Black Americans from Colonial Times to the Present Social History of Medicine (2007) 20 (3): 620-621. The book is divided into three parts: the first is about the cultural memory of medical experimentation; the second examines recent cases of medical abuse and research; while the last addresses the complex relationship between racism and medicine. Some topics discussed are well-known, such as the Tuskegee syphilis experiment (193272), in which African Americans with the disease were intentionally denied treatment (without being told) in order to allow the progression of the disease so it could be observed in all stages, but other episodes are less well known to the general public. The book also mentions cases of medical experimentation in Africa and their links to African-American cases.  Topics covered  James Marion Sims = James Marion Sims, born in Hanging Rock, South Carolina, was widely considered to be the \\"father of gynecology.\\" Washington uses her book to expose Sims by detailing the misdiagnosis of the medical conditions which his patients suffered from during his medical training and the mistreatment of black slave women that led to his medical breakthrough. In the beginning of its excerpt on Sims, the book details how he would blame the wrong parties for diseases and infections, such as neonatal tetanus. Neonatal tetanus is a bacterial disease which is caused by animal manure and it grows in wounds such as umbilical stumps. Instead of blaming the slave owners for not providing proper and clean living areas for these slaves to live in, Sims blamed slave women's supposed laziness as the cause of their diseases. Washington also mentioned the exploitation of black slave bodies when she talked about the mistreatment of black infants during the 1800s. Sims used their bodies for tetany experiments. Sims determined through his research that the cause of tetany in the babies was a result of the movement of skull bones during birth. In order to test his theory, he took a black baby and, using a shoemaker's tools, opened the baby's brain based on his belief that black babies' skulls grew faster than the skulls of white babies, preventing their brains from growing or developing. Most of the babies died and he blamed their deaths on their supposed lack of intelligence. The most infamous example of Sims' medical malpractice was his research on vesicovaginal fistulas. Sims acquired four female slaves and used their bodies in order to find a cure for the complication of childbirth. Sims put the slave women through painful surgeries without giving any of them anesthesia and he was eventually able to find the cure. As Washington said in the book, \\"he claimed that his procedures were “not painful enough to justify the trouble and risk of attending the administration,” but this claim rings hollow when one learns that Sims always administered anesthesia when he performed the perfected surgery to repair the vaginas of white women in Montgomery a few years later. Sims also cited the popular belief that blacks did not feel pain in the same way as whites.\\" (7) Despite this, he received much fame and attention for his breakthrough. Because of his use of black women, Sims was eventually able to help white women who experienced vesicovaginal fistulas, but black women still did not have access to these treatments and many of them died from the same disease that the slave women helped to cure. Along with not giving them anesthesia, he mistreated the women, making them completely undress, then kneel on hands and knees while doctors examined their vaginas. Awards Medical Apartheid won the 2007 National Book Critics Circle Award for Nonfiction.

One critic dubbed it as a \\"Taj Mahal\\" in reference to its Italian granite, English brick and a $300,000 aquarium. However, proponents of the project argued that it will revive a forgotten but historically important part of Downtown and create a new public place for a city with many communities but few communal gathering places.

Williams (July 9, 1839 – March 25, 1917) was an American law enforcement officer and police inspector for the New York City Police Department. One of the more colorful yet controversial figures of the NYPD, popularly known as \\"Clubber Williams\\" or \\"Czar of the Tenderloin\\", he oversaw the Tenderloin and Gas House districts as well as breaking up a number of the city's street gangs, most notably, the Gas House Gang in 1871. He, along with William \\"Big Bill\\" Devery and Thomas F. Byrnes, were among several senior NYPD officials implicated by the Lexow Committee during the 1890s. Early life Alexander S. Williams was born in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, Canada on July 9, 1839. His father was a native of Nova Scotia and his mother was Scottish. He emigrated to the United States as a child and was apprenticed as a ship's carpenter for the New York-based shipbuilding firm W.H. Webb & Co. for several years. As a young man, he visited several countries including Mexico and Japan among others. He was reportedly the first Westerner to lay the keel of a sailing ship in Japan. Returning to the United States, he was employed by the government and was engaged in raising a sunken ship off the coast of Florida.\\"Farewell To Williams; Retired from the Police Force at His Own Request. Rumors That Byrnes Will Withdraw, The Chief of Police Will Not Discuss Rumors About Himself -- Williams's Varied Record as a Policeman\\". The New York Times. May 25, 1895\\"Williams, 'Ex-Czar' Of Tenderloin, Dies; Picturesque Former Inspector of Police Gave the District Its Sobriquet. Figured In Lexow Inquiry; Retired on Pension After That;-Noted for His Love of a Fight; 77 Years Old. He Never Shunned a Fight. Appearance Before Lexow.\\" The New York Times March 26, 1917 First years with the NYPD Williams officially joined the New York Police Department on August 23, 1866. According to popular lore, Williams originally approached NYPD Police Commissioner John Bergen at the Metropolitan Police Headquarters to personally request a commission as a patrolman. Bergen however, without any way to confirm his identity, pointed this fact out remarking that \\"You may be a convict from Sing Sing for all I know\\". Williams angrily told the commissioner he could keep the job and stormed out of his office. Impressed with Williams show of force, he sent for Williams to be brought back and was immediately given a position as a patrolman. His first post was at the 47th Precinct in Brooklyn where he remained until 1868 when he was transferred to Broadway, then a dangerous and high-crime area, commonly known as \\"a district infested with crooks and thugs of all description\\". Williams quickly gained a reputation as a fearsome fighter, in a time when several police officers had been carried off in ambulances during their beat, and eventually became known as \\"Clubber Williams\\". Two days after his arrival in the Houston Street area, he picked a fight with two local toughs and attacked them single-handed. Knocking them both unconscious with his club, the fight ended when he threw both of them through a plate glass window from the Florence Saloon.Asbury, Herbert. The Gangs of New York: An Informal History of the New York Underworld. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1928. (pg. 162, 217–219, 230–231, 233) In his first three years in the district, it was said that \\"it was a dull day that did not find him with at least one row in his hands\\". He was made a roundsman on July 10, 1871, and then appointed to sergeant on September 23 whereupon he was assigned to lead the then newly formed \\"mounted squad\\". Gas House and the Tenderloin districts On May 31, 1872, Williams became the precinct captain of the East 35th Street Station, then located in the infamous Gas House district, where he led a \\"strong arm squad\\" into the district and was successful in breaking up the Gas House Gang. He spent the next three years in other poor high-crime areas using his aggressive \\"rough-and-ready\\" policing methods until September 30, 1876, when he was transferred to the West 13th Street Station. The precinct was one of the most important posts in the city, being the center of the Broadway's night clubs, gambling resorts and \\"disorderly houses\\". Referring to the increased amount of bribes he would receive for police protection of both legitimate and illegitimate businesses there - especially the many brothels - Williams said, \\"I've been having chuck steak ever since I've been on the force, and now I'm going to have a bit of tenderloin.\\"Elsroad, Lisa. \\"Tenderloin\\" in , p.1161Burrows & Wallace, p.959 The area would later become known as the \\"Tenderloin district\\" which was attributed to this remark. He remained in the Tenderloin for two years, Max F. Schmittberger and James K. Price both serving as his wardmen, and was briefly detailed as Superintendent of Street Cleaning until his return on June 15, 1881. Despite being brought up on charges eighteen times, Williams was always acquitted by the Board of Police Commissioners and remained in charge of the district until his promotion to inspector in August 1887. In response to frequent criticism of excessive force, Williams once said \\"There is more law in the end of a policeman's nightstick than in a decision of the Supreme Court\\". Lexow Committee inquiry In 1894, a legislative investigation headed by Senator Clarence Lexow was established to investigate corruption within the NYPD. One of the main examinations of the Lexow Committee was Williams' administration in the Tenderloin district. Claims that Williams had received money from gamblers and brothel keepers was supported by testimony from Max Schmittenberger, now a Chief Inspector, who stated before the committee that he himself had collected regular payments and turned it over to Williams. His involvement in other underworld \\"interests\\" were uncovered during the investigation and Williams was called to testify. He claimed that he had acted against some \\"disorderly houses\\", but was unable to recall the names or addresses, while he had allowed others to continue operating because they were \\"fashionable\\". Among his personal finances and properties included a house at Cos Cob, Connecticut, a yacht and other property. When asked how he had acquired these on a policeman's salary, he answered \\"I bought real estate in Japan and it has increased in value\\". Retirement and later life In the aftermath of the Lexow investigation, it was widely speculated that Williams would be charged with corruption. Williams would not be brought to trial, but a meeting of the three Police Commissioners headed by Theodore Roosevelt on May 24, 1895, decided that Williams would be retired on a yearly pension of $1,750. In the fall, Williams unsuccessfully ran for State Senator in the Twelfth District where he had formerly been an inspector. He later went into the insurance business where he was said to have been very successful. In 1912, Williams lashed out against Mayor William Jay Gaynor who had used his nickname \\"Clubber Williams\\" in a derogatory fashion towards his police record. Williams issued a public statement in defense of his near 30-year career on the force. \\"Just ask the Mayor if he can point to a single person I ever clubbed that did not deserve it. He can't name one and he knows it\\". Williams died at his West 95th Street home on the afternoon of March 25, 1917. He was survived by his wife and two sons, all of whom were with him at the time of his death, and buried at Woodlawn Cemetery. ReferencesExternal links *Alexander S.

The museum focuses on the collection of steam locomotives, the remains of the closing of the railway line. Museum building and location Ambarawa was a military city during the Dutch Colonial Government. King Willem I ordered the construction of a new railway station to enable the government to transport its troops to Semarang. On 21 May 1873, the Ambarawa railway station was built on a 127,500 m² land. This was known back then as Willem I Station. It was finished at the same time as the Kedungjati-Bringin- Tuntang-Ambarawa line. The station building consists of two main building for waiting room and station master room. The Willem I railway station was originally a transhipment point between the gauge branch from Kedungjati to the northeast and the gauge line onward towards Yogyakarta via Magelang to the south. It is still possible to see that the two sides of the station were built to accommodate different size trains. On 8 April 1976, the Ambarawa railway station was officially converted into the Ambarawa Railway Museum by the governor of Central Java Province at that time Supardjo Rustam. The museum preserves the steam locomotives, which were then coming to the end of their useful lives when the gauge railways of the Indonesian State Railway (the Perusahaan Negara Kereta Api, PNKA) was closed. These are parked in the open air next to the original station. In 2010, the building of Ambarawa Railway Museum was made heritage building.Under Peraturan Menteri Kebudayaan dan Pariwisata Nomor PM.57/PW.007/MKP/2010 =Railway line= The 1067mm line that connects Magelang station and Willem I station, the station that is now a museum. The gauge line towards Yogyakarta (runs roughly south-west from Ambarawa) was of particular interest because it contained sections of rack railway between and , the only such operation in Java. This line beyond Bedono closed in the early 1970s after it was damaged in an earthquake, but had already lost most of its passenger traffic to buses on the parallel road. The line from Kedungjati (runs east initially from Ambarawa) survived into the middle 1970s but saw very little traffic near the end, not least because it was far quicker to travel more directly by road to Semarang. The presence of the rack line meant that there was probably never much through traffic from Semarang to Yogyakarta. Services Currently, there is operating heritage railway between Ambarawa–Bedono, operated by steam locomotive. In addition, there is also tourist railway between Ambarawa–Tuntang. Collection CC5029, one of the locomotives in the collection The museum collected 21 steam locomotives. Currently four locomotives are operational. Other collections of the museum include old telephones, Morse telegraph equipment, old bells and signals equipment, and some antique furniture. B2502, one of the three locomotives that are still active Some of the steam locomotives are the 2 B25 class 0-4-2RT B2502 and B2503 which is from the original fleet of 5 supplied to the line about 100 years ago (a third locomotive, B 2501, is preserved in a park in the town nearby). The E10 class 0-10-0RT E1060 which was originally delivered to West Sumatra in the 1960s for working the coal railway, but was brought to Java, later returned again to Sawahlunto, and a conventional locomotive 2-6-0T C1218 which was restored to working order in 2006, but transferred to Solo to working as tourist train, named Sepur Kluthuk Jaladara.

(A helideck is a purpose built helicopter landing area, usually on a ship or offshore oil/gas installation.) Over the years the offshore oil exploration and production business has relied upon helicopters as the main method of transferring personnel to and from their workplace. Traditionally, and legally these days, the appointment of an HLO is the responsibility of the ship or installation operator. In the early days of offshore helicopter work, the basic requirements of safety were met by persons who would have a primary task (Deck supervisor, Crane supervisor etc.) and would take responsibility for the helicopter crew change as a secondary task. The influence of the various Civil Aviation Authorities around the world has had a huge effect on the efficiency and safety of working in this position. The safety of all personnel traveling to a ship or offshore location is in the hands of these specialists, whilst moving to and from the helicopter. The HLO commands a team, which again, is usually made up of members of the ship or installation crew, known as HDA's (Helideck Assistants). The assistants themselves are also trained in passenger and freight handling, helicopter safety and fire and rescue.

On the bank of the Gajah Wong River on Solo Street, the painter Affandi designed and constructed a home for himself, which also functions as a museum to display his paintings. The building is uniquely constructed, with a roof that resembles a banana leaf. The museum has around 250 of Affandi's paintings.

Before dying, Affandi spent a lot of time sitting around in his own museum, observing his paintings. He said once, “I want to die in simplicity without giving anyone unnecessary trouble, so I could go home to Him in peace.” After suffering a complication of illnesses, on Wednesday, the May 23, 1990, Affandi died.

History Fujinagata claimed to have been founded in 1689, making it one of the oldest shipbuilders in Japan. Originally called Hyōgo-ya, and located in central Osaka, it was contracted in 1854 by officials representing the Tokugawa shogunate to produce sail warships for the new Tokugawa feudal navy. In 1869, with the assistance of German engineers, the western-style warships were designed and produced. After the Meiji Restoration, the shipyards concentrated on civilian applications, and in 1870 launched its first western-style commercial steam vessel. This was a first for a privately held shipbuilder in Japan. In 1874, the shipyards were relocated to Nishi-ku, Osaka and the company name officially changed to Fujinagata Shipyards. In 1884, the main shipyards was relocated to Taisho-ku, Osaka. In 1900, Fujinagata completed its first all- metal construction merchant vessel; the No.2 Nagata Maru. In 1917, new shipyards in Sumiyoshi-ku, Osaka were opened. Fujinagata became was designated an official naval repair facility in 1919. On May 31, 1921, the Momi class destroyer Fuji was launched, marking the first of 56 destroyers that Fujinagata would eventually build for the Imperial Japanese Navy.Porter, Japan, the Rise of a Modern Power With new naval contracts, Fujinagata moved its head office into new facilities and expanded its capability rapidly. However, it expanded too quickly and soon fell into financial difficulties causing its shipbuilding business to come under the accounting supervision of the Ministry of the Navy of Japan in December 1928. However, Fujinagata was able to weather the turmoil of the Great Depression without significant difficulty. In 1940, along with most businesses of strategic importance to the Japanese war effort, Fujinagata was nationalized under the Navy Ministry. In December 1944, Fujinagata had 16,508 employees. It is estimated that perhaps half of the employees at that time were ethnic Koreans, and at least 150 were Australian prisoners of war, who were supplying forced labor in violation of the Geneva Conventions.Glusman, Conduct Under Fire In June 1945, Fujinagata's main shipyards were destroyed during large-scale air raids towards the end of World War II. After World War II, Fujinagata was restored to private ownership and recovered by building fishing vessels, merchant vessels and tankers. In 1962, it completed its first LNG carrier. In October 1967, the company was purchased by Mitsui Shipbuilding and Engineering, thus ending its long history as the oldest independent shipbuilder in Japan.

Early life Davidson was born in Mauritius to George Walter Davidson, a merchant, and his wife Johanna, and some time before 1890 they moved back to England. From 1890 Davidson was educated at Harrow School, then at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, after he left Harrow in 1893. Early military career Davidson graduated in 1896 and joined the 1st Battalion the King's Royal Rifle Corps as a second lieutenant on 28 March 1896. He was promoted to lieutenant on 15 October 1898, and a year later the Corps had been transferred to Cape Colony, where they were directly involved in the Second Boer War. With his Regiment he took part in the Battle of Talana Hill and the Battle of Ladysmith before he was attached to the Army Service Corps.Hart′s Army list, 1903 He was promoted to captain on 25 October 1901, and in late December that year he was seconded for service as Adjutant of the Damant's Horse, a local cavalry unit, with the objective of disrupting Boer commando units. He was mentioned in despatches and appointed a Companion of the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for his war service. After the end of the Boer War he returned to a regular posting with his regiment in August 1902, and was appointed regimental Adjutant of the 1st Battalion on 3 September 1902. He left South Africa with other men of his battalion on the SS Sardinia in September 1902. Arriving at Malta the following month, he was engaged in Imperial garrison service there and at Crete before being accepted into the Staff College, Camberley in 1905. After graduation he served in a variety of positions as a staff officer, including as director of training at the War Office from 1908 to 1910, followed by two years as a staff major with the 5th Infantry Brigade. In 1912 he was transferred back to the Staff College, this time as an instructor. First World War After the outbreak of the First World War, Davidson joined the III Corps as a staff officer and participated in the First Battle of the Marne, First Battle of the Aisne and the First Battle of Ypres. After the formation of the First Army in 1915 he became the operations officer for Douglas Haig, the Army commander. As operations officer Davidson was the principal organiser of the Battle of Neuve Chapelle, Battle of Loos and the Second Battle of Artois. After Haig became Commander-in-Chief of the British Expeditionary Force on the Western Front Davidson's star was in the ascendant as a part of Haig's inner circle and he was appointed to the post of Director of Military Operations at General Headquarters, one of the key posts controlling activities on the Western Front during the war. In 1916 he was made a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour and in 1917 he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath. During the planning of the initial attack at Third Ypres, he urged more limited advances with regard to tactical objectives so as to increase the concentration of British artillery fire and leave the British attacking forces less vulnerable to German counter-attack, but his advice was not followed. Ahead of the German Michael Offensive Davidson advised Hubert Gough, GOC Fifth Army, that he could overcome his lack of men by \\"skillful handling of rearguards\\". Gough was irritated by this.Kitchen 2001, p52 On 6 April 1918, with the German Georgette Offensive imminent, he was sent on a mission to Beauvais to attempt to persuade Ferdinand Foch to take over the British line as far north as the Somme, to send French reserves behind British line at Vimy Ridge, or to conduct a major French offensive. Foch, concerned at the risk of a German attack in the French sector, refused, although he offered to participate in a joint Anglo-French offensive near Amiens.Kitchen 2001, p99 In the spring of 1918 Davidson, now a major-general, was promoted to control both Intelligence (formerly the empire of Haig's alleged eminence grise John Charteris and now under Brigadier General Edgar Cox), and Operations (\\"Oa\\", now under the future CIGS Brigadier General John Dill).Harris 2008, p464 Ahead of the Bluecher Offensive, Haig later claimed that he and Davidson had repeatedly warned of the dangers of a German attack along the Chemin des Dames, but that their warnings were brushed aside by Foch, Maxime Weygand and de Barescut. No evidence had been found to substantiate this claim.Kitchen 2001, p136Both British and French intelligence had believed that German March offensive against British Fifth Army, which was far larger and more effective than had been predicted, might be a feint before a bigger attack in Champagne, whilst Haig was quicker than Foch to realise that the German offensive on the Chemin des Dames at the end of May was serious. See Harris 2008 p443, 447. In 1919 Davidson was appointed and knighted a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George. Later life He left the army in 1922, and immediately stood for Parliament as a Conservative. He was returned for Fareham, and took an active role in the House of Commons' Army Committee. He stood down from the Commons in 1931 to concentrate on his business interests, including a seat on the Vickers- Armstrongs board and a position as Chairman of the Bank of Australia between 1937 and 1945. In the early 1950s he published the book 'Haig: Master of the Field, comprising a defence of the British Army General Headquarters' conduct of the Western Front campaign in 1917–1918.'Haig: Master of the Field', by John Davidson (Pub.

For instance, a POF is generally obligatory for people seeking mortgages as bankers are often more willing to issue them to those who have the sufficient funds to pay their mortgages off as opposed to those who cannot do so. Thus, a POF letter provides the selling or lending party with confidence that the funds are obtainable and legitimate. Proof of Funds in Practice A POF is commonly used when commencing commercial transactions between parties who do not know each other. The purchaser's bank produces evidence in a standard format that their client is good for a transaction up to the value of xx, based on yy item etc. Usually, such letters have to be produced/verified/confirmed by a class A international bank, as local banks do not have the status required by counter- party banks in other countries. Or in the retail market, when funding large- scale investments such as buying a house or property as real-estate agents tend to demand evidence that the buyer has such affordability. One way in which a person can acquire a POF, is by requesting the bank to confirm and approve the amount of cash that the person has on hand. The bank should also approve of the availability and legality of the funds to be used as a transaction before the funds can be transferred. If interested in buying property, The property beneficiary should be convinced of the fact that the buyer has such affordability to buy such property. However, since every POF document has an expiry date, at which point the document becomes of no use to the seller, it is essential to keep it up to date especially as the buyer's POF submission and the seller's process of approval can, in some cases, consume a substantial amount of time, taking weeks and even months to finish the process. Leased Proof of Funds A POF can in some cases be borrowed or leased, which is where a client pays a fee for cash to be deposited into their personal or business bank account, but the cash is limited by the bank as the client is not permitted to withdraw it or complete transactions with it. By keeping the funds unable to be used, it safeguards the asset holder and makes them ensure that the cash can solely be used to complete POF transactions based on what the loan agreement dictates.ibid Standby Letter of Credit A Standby Letter of Credit (SLOC) is a letter issued by a bank guaranteeing payment to a beneficiary in case the buyer or customer fails to pay the seller at a given time period. SLOCs are usually used when doing international trading between different countries to avoid conflict as they are a way of building credibility and trust in assuring unknown sellers with confidence that they will receive their payment. Another way of ensuring that beneficiaries receive their payment is through collateral, which is where lenders demand assets and properties of certain value (depending on the value of the loan from the loaner) from loaners as a form of security before handing out loans to them. Blocked Proof of Funds Letter A blocked POF letter is a letter from a financial institution or government that approves the halting or reserving of a person's funds on behalf of them. Governments can reserve a country's funds by restricting the maximum amount of funds that is allowed to be spent at a certain period of time in order to control the country's cash flow. Other circumstances where funds may need to be blocked may be due to political or emergency reasons such as during war or following the death of an account holder.

Established in 1976, the Met initially exhibited international artists to expose Filipinos to contemporary visual works in other cultures. By 1986, its focus shifted to local works and extend its reach to more common people by offering bilingual exhibition texts and developing several outreach educational programs like workshops and symposia, thereby promoting local pride and identity. The museum offers free admission on Tuesdays. Partly subsidized by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, the administration of the museum was entrusted to the Metropolitan Museum of Manila Foundation in 1979.

The Museo Pambata (Children's Museum or Museum for Children) is a children's museum in the Ermita district of Manila, near Rizal Park, in the Philippines. It is located in the former Elks Club Building, built in 1910, along Roxas Boulevard at the corner of South Drive. Background The Museo Pambata is a children's interactive museum. Unlike traditional museums where items are stored behind glass and touching is highly discouraged, Museo Pambata invites visitors to learn with the exhibits by using their total senses. It envisions itself as a discovery museum and resource center promoting Filipino global culture, children's advocacy programs, and creative educational programs with linkages to global communities. The museum also has regular programs and events for various sectors. History Opened in 1994, Museo Pambata is dream come true of Nina Lim-Yuson, an early childhood educator and mother of four, who once brought her young children to the Boston Children’s Museum in America. They had so much fun with the museum's hands-on exhibits that she wished there was a similar place back home where her kids - and the millions of Filipino children - can learn and have fun at the same time. In March 1993, Yuson, together with her mother, former Department of Social Welfare and Development secretary Estefania Aldaba-Lim, presented a proposal of their dream museum, to be situated in the historical Elks Club Building in Manila, to then Manila Mayor Alfredo Lim. Much to their joy and surprise, he readily approved it. The Museo Pambata officers were elected in the first Board of Trustees meeting held in June 1993. Educators, visual artists, architects, museum workers and other professionals met regularly to brainstorm. Concepts were then translated into several theme rooms designed and produced pro bono by architect and stage designer Joselito Tecson. In December 1993, the City Council of Manila, in a memorandum of agreement (MOA) granted the Museo Pambata a 10-year-free-of-lease-use of the Elks Club Building. The funds raised by the board of trustees were used to start its rehabilitation. In March 1994, the recognition dinner for Museo's first Ninongs and Ninangs, (sponsors who gave one million pesos each) namely Luis H. Lim Foundation, Juan and Lualhati Cojuangco Foundation, A.Y. Foundation, Petron Corporation, Fe S. Panlilio, Don Emilio T. Yap, Helena Z. Benitez, Security Bank and Trust Company, Landbank and GSIS. Finally, on December 21, 1994, after a year of preparatory work, the museum opened its doors to children, youth and parents as the country's pioneering children's museum. With a strong leadership, a definite plan of action and imminent success, the list of Ninongs and Ninangs has grown longer: Department of Tourism, PAGCOR, Department of Environment and Natural Resources, Department of Health, Sen. Ramon Magsaysay, Jr., Consuelo Alger Foundation, Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office, Coca-Cola Foundation, Development Bank of the Philippines, PHINMA Group, Splash Foundation, Aldaba- Lim Foundation, WS Family Foundation, Sen. Francis Pangilinan, E. Zobel Foundation, Globe Telecom, Inc., C Com Foundation, and Ford Foundation Philippines. In March 2012, Museo Pambata was shortlisted and received a Special Commendation from the jury of the First Children’s Museum Award in Bologna, Italy “for inspiring the creation of new children’s museums in the Philippines and Asia.” Museo Pambata also received a Best Soft Power Cultural Organization nomination in the 2016 Leading Cultural Destinations Awards (“the Oscars for museums”) Theme Rooms Marionettes display in the children's museum There are eight theme rooms in Museo Pambata, namely: * Kalikasan (Environment) and Karagatan (Under the Sea) - Contains a simulated rain forest and seabed where visitors can learn about environmental concerns and ecological conservation. * Maynila Noon (Old Manila) - Visitors can learn about history by looking at artifacts and simulated exhibits depicting turn- of-the-century Manila. * Paglaki Ko (Career Options) - Showcases various careers and encourages visitors to visualize themselves doing a particular career. Currently it features writers and illustrators. * I Love My Planet Earth - Where visitors can learn about climate change and how one can take part in caring for the planet. * Pamilihang Bayan (Marketplace) - Features a row of play stores and shops. One can pretend to be a store owner and practice their entrepreneurial skills. * Katawan Ko (My Body Works) - Features the human body, how various organs work, and pointers on healthcare. * Bata sa Mundo (Children in the Global Village) - Dolls from around the world are displayed in this room. The museum also has a children's library, changing exhibits hall, gift shop, three venues for various events, playground, and parking space. ProgramsChildren's Rights= Museo Pambata’s educational programs and special activities are anchored on the advocacy of children’s rights, primarily on their right to education, health, recreation, and mental and physical development. An outstanding activity held in the Karapatan Hall, an area in the museum dedicated to children’s rights, is the Rights of the Child Awareness Tournament in 1995. It was followed by Mag-ROCK Tayo! (Rights Of the Child Kontest) in 2001-2002. In cooperation with the Council for the Welfare of Children (CWC), Plan International, UNICEF, Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), Department of Education (DepEd), and the Manila City schools, these projects familiarized children with their basic rights as stated in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. Kanino ba ang CRC? was a three-day children’s summit held in November 2009 to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The summit brought together 50 children who are living in different, often difficult situations. The summit aimed to raise awareness on the Convention on the Rights of the Child by posing the question “Whose responsibility is the CRC?”. Children participants, in plenary and discussions in workshops, shared their views of the rights and responsibilities of the child and crafted messages to people and agencies concerned. The summit was organized with the help of the DSWD, UNICEF, National Council of Social Development, Children’s Lab, CHILDHOPE Asia-Philippines, and other private donors. =Literacy Programs= Started in 1995, the Mobile Library Program is a reading campaign for the economically disadvantaged children and out-of- school youth of Manila. It aims to impart the value of reading to children through storytelling and book-lending sessions. Six years later, the Mobile Library van was inaugurated through a grant from Ford Foundation Philippines. It is a six-wheeler roving library with over 3,000 children’s books and other learning aids for the benefit of the children of Manila and neighboring cities. In 2011, the van was refurbished through the help of Atty. Ging Gonzalez-Montinola and Pilipinas Hino, Inc. In line with the Philippine Centennial celebration in 1998, Museo Pambata launched Aklat: Karapatan at Kapangyarihan para sa Kabataan (The Book: The Right and Empowerment of the Youth) or Aklat:KKK. It had two components: the outreach and the in-house programs. Four minilibraries were turned over to the Manila barangays as part of the outreach component, while storytelling sessions became regular Friday and Saturday activities at the Museo Pambata Library and Resource Center. In 1999, the Office of Manila Mayor Lito Atienza and Museo Pambata launched Sa Aklat Sisikat!, a Manila-wide literacy campaign to promote the habit of reading among children in Manila’s public schools. This innovative pilot campaign addressed the alarming decline in reading abilities and literacy rate in the country, particularly among public schoolchildren.

In order to cope with protection of vulnerable points and guarding prisoners of war, the First Reserve Brigade was formed on 29 February 1940 initially with six battalions but later expanded to twelve battalions before being broken up at the end of 1943.The Patriot Files Formation and function The First Reserve Brigade was a South African second-line military unit raised in 1940, with brigade headquarters in Johannesburg under Colonel T Scott, who died in August 1941. He was succeeded by Colonel BC Judd OBE. The brigade drafted men of 'B' and 'C' Medical Categories primarily for guard duties at aerodromes. Ex-servicemen and others above the age of 35 but under 60 were accepted, and the brigade was run on a normal Active Citizen Force basis or fulI-time, as authorised. Detachments of the 1st Special Service Reserve Battalion were absorbed as fulI-time companies or platoons. On 11 July 1940 the SA Internment Battalion was absorbed and redesignated 6th Battalion, 1st Reserve Brigade, with Lt-Col Whelehen as battalion commander. Its primary responsibility was the security of internment camps at Baviaanspoort, which had 150 guards. The brigade was organised with the 1st Battalion (the former 1st Special Service Reserve Battalion) in the Transvaal, with headquarters at Roberts Heights the 2nd Battalion in the Western Cape Province with its headquarters in Cape Town, the 3rd (Durban) in Natal, the 4th (Johannesburg) on the Witwatersrand and in the Orange Free State and the 5th (East London) in the Eastern Cape Province. Later battalions were the 7th, in the Kimberley district and the Orange Free State, and the 8th, on a basis similar to that of the 6th. By 1942, after 2,800 men out of a total of 6,061 had been reclassified and transferred to other units, the brigade organisation was dissolved. The following year four more battalions were formed, some serving in North Africa, while the 1st, 4th, 5th and 8th Battalions were broken up.

The long line was opened in 1879. It is now Deutsche Bahn route 627 and route 21 (RB 21) of the Rhein-Main-Verkehrsverbund.  History The Hessian Ludwig Railway (Hessische Ludwigsbahn) opened the Main-Lahn Railway, which passes through Niedernhausen, in 1877. The Ländches Railway was built to provide a connection from Niedernhausen to Wiesbaden, where the Taunus Railway and the Right Rhine Railway ended. It was opened together with the Ludwigsbahnhof (Ludwig station) on 1 July 1879. The line's approach to Wiesbaden was rebuilt over more than six kilometres to enable the construction of Wiesbaden Hauptbahnhof. This new section went into operation in 1904 and a link was opened to the Wiesbaden Süd express freight yard in 1906. With the opening of Wiesbaden Hauptbahnhof in 1906, the Ludwigsbahnhof was closed and the line shortened by about a kilometre. After the opening of the racecourse on the grounds of today's airfield in Erbenheim, trains ran to Erbenheim on race days, at ten-minute intervals at the busiest times. On 1 October 1907, responsibility for the line was transferred from the railway division (Eisenbahndirektionen) of Frankfurt to the division of Mainz. and Route Wiesbaden-Erbenheim station on the Ländches Railway The line originally began at the Ludwig Station (Ludwigsbahnhof) on Rheinstrasse in Wiesbaden, near the Taunus Station. In 1906, this station (as well as the Taunus Station) were replaced with the current Wiesbaden Hauptbahnhof (main or central station). The route now begins on the west side of the Central Station and crosses, in the vicinity of the Hammermühle, the tracks to and from Wiesbaden-East and Wiesbaden-Biebrich. Originally, a freight line from Wiesbaden-East paralleled the Ländches Railway from this overpass to the Wiesbaden Army Airfield in Erbenheim, so that the two-way tracks were side by side on the same embankment, almost to the Erbenheim passenger station. In 2002 the freight route was closed and the section from the Wiesbaden Hauptbahnhof to shortly before Erbenheim was used for the Cologne–Frankfurt high-speed rail line. This section, covering relatively flat terrain in the Wäschbach valley, is now double-tracked and electrified. From Wiesbaden-Erbenheim, the route goes through the Ländchen, from which it takes its name. The elevation rises steadily to the north. North of the Auringen/Medenbach station, the line passes underneath the Cologne–Frankfurt HSL and then enters the long \\"Grauer- Stein\\" tunnel beneath Bundesautobahn 3 and Bundesstraße 455. The railway tunnel, which was built in 1878, was completely renewed from 1998 to 2000 for reasons of operational safety. The tunnel was originally designed for double track operation, but has had only one track since its opening. The large cross-section and the fact that the tunnel will continue to be used by only a single track allowed the construction of a new reinforced concrete inner tube with an all-round seal inside the old sandstone lining. Since the renovation work could take place only during the night and on weekends while operations were maintained on weekdays, the renovation was carried out intermittently in eight-metre sections. The tunnel is at a high point of the Taunus and marks the highest elevation of the line. The elevation drops towards Niedernhausen. Between 1996 and 1998, the halt (Haltepunkt) of Rhein-Main-Theater was located at line-kilometre 17.8 between Auringen-Medenbach and Niedernhausen (Taunus); this served the musical theatre of the same name, where Sunset Boulevard by Andrew Lloyd Webber was performed. Continuous theatre trains ran from Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof to Niedernhausen, and then ran back to Rhein-Main- Theater. In Niedernhausen, the Ländches Railway merges with the tracks of the Main-Lahn railway, allowing the trains to change between the routes without difficulty. Operations vectus Verkehrsgesellschaft mbH diesel multiple unit The relatively short route is used primarily by commuter traffic and is therefore serviced by multiple units (i.e. self-propelled carriages). After World War II, these sets were mainly class ETA-176 battery-powered railcars based in Limburg. Trains generally stopped at every station along the line. Only expresses from Limburg to Wiesbaden ran non-stop between Niedernhausen and Wiesbaden. During low-traffic periods, operations with single railcars on the Ländches Railway were extended from Niedernhausen to Limburg. With the introduction of clock-face scheduling (trains scheduled at the same times every hour) on the Main-Lahn railway, the connecting traffic on the Ländches Railway was also systematised. In the 1970s, a pair of diesel multiple units ran from Au (Sieg) to Mainz on the Ländches Railway, connecting the Westerwald with the capital cities of Wiesbaden and Mainz. From 2004 to December 2014, the traffic on the Ländches Railway was exclusively operated by Vectus Verkehrsgesellschaft of Limburg, using LINT railcars. Since the founding of the Rhein-Main-Verkehrsverbund (RMV), the line has been integrated into the RMV uniform tariff. The proposed Stadtbahn Wiesbaden project would have involved the introduction of a regional light rail network under the Karlsruhe model and would have included the Ländches Railway. These plans were well advanced, but were abandoned with a change of political majorities in the city in 2001. At the beginning of November 2014, it was announced that the Rhein- Main-Verkehrsverbund and Alstom had agreed to use new railcars with fuel cell propulsion (iLINT) on the lines of the Taunus network (12, 13, 15 and 21) from 2018 at the earliest. Since 14 December 2014, the line has been operated by the Hessische Landesbahn (HLB). It was initially operated for about a year with Stadler GTW sets and another LINT 41 set owned by HLB. These were replaced in December 2015 by six Siemens Desiro Classic sets belonging to the HLB, which had previously been used on the Kahlgrund Railway and were released because operations on that line were then taken over by Westfrankenbahn, part of DB Regio.  Stations All stations on the Ländches Railway are in the tariff area of the Rhein-Main-Verkehrsverbund (RMV). With the exception of Niedernhausen station (and the abandoned Rhein-Main-Theater station), these are also in the Wiesbaden urban area. Some have direct access to local bus routes, while the nearest bus stop to others is a short distance away and the stop is not named after the station. The rebuilding of the Wiesbaden stations, which as announced would have begun in the spring of 2013, has been delayed. In December 2014, it was announced that the renovation works would begin in the spring 2016 and be completed in the autumn of 2016. = Wiesbaden Hbf = Entrance building of the Wiesbaden Hauptbahnhof Until 1906, the Ländches Railway ended in Wiesbaden at the Ludwigsbahnhof (). With the reconstruction of the railway tracks in the city, the new Hauptbahnhof () became the end of the line. This provides connections to long-distance traffic as well as to various regional rail services and bus routes. = Wiesbaden-Erbenheim = Wiesbaden-Erbenheim station () is located about 400 metres west of the town hall and the church square of the district of Erbenheim. Until 2005, there were two mechanical signal boxes in Erbenheim, which were demolished with the dismantling of infrastructure, including points, meaning that the station is now classified as a Haltepunkt (halt). The signal box at the exit to Wiesbaden Hauptbahnhof served as a guard signal box. The single-storey former station building formerly had a ticket office as well as a baggage handling office. As part of the renewal of the stations on the Ländches Railway, a shift of the station towards Berliner Straße is planned to shorten the paths from the bus stop and town centre to the station. = Wiesbaden-Igstadt = Entrance building of Wiesbaden-Igstadt station (2010) Wiesbaden-Igstadt station () is located west of the district of Igstadt and has a heritage-listed entrance building from 1926. It is planned to build a new access from the centre of Igstadt to station. Igstadt station is the only station on the Ländches Railway with a crossing loop apart from the endpoints. In July 2017, the mechanical signal box was replaced by a computer-based interlocking. = Auringen-Medenbach = Auringen-Medenbach station () is located between the two Wiesbaden districts of Auringen and Medenbach. A stately entrance building with an extension, a freight shed, a laundry, a kerosene cellar and stables were built. On the ground floor there was a large waiting room with wooden benches and a potbelly stove, while the upper floors served as a dwelling for railway officials. Originally, the station had two platform tracks and a freight track and the points were controlled via a signal box. The building was demolished in 1972 due to its disrepair and replaced by a waiting shelter. Meanwhile, the track infrastructure was dismantled, converting the station into a halt. The ESWE buses serve the nearby August-Ruf-Straße stop. Plans are currently underway to modernise the halt and improve the connection between the railway station and the bus stop. = Niedernhausen = The line connects to the Main-Lahn Railway at Niedernhausen station (). This is served by S-Bahn line S2 as well as the buses of Omnibusverkehr Rhein-Nahe (ORN) and ESWE Verkehrsgesellschaft.

The population of New Netherland was not all ethnically Dutch,Un-Pilgrims - Article by Russell Shorto but had a variety of ethnic and linguistic backgrounds, including: other European ethnic groups (Germans, Scandinavians, French, Scots, English, Irish, Italians, and Croats); indigenous Amerindian tribes such as Algonquians and Iroquoians; Sephardic Jews (Jews of Spanish and Portuguese backgrounds) both from the Netherlands itself and the then recently lost colony of Dutch Brazil; and West Africans, the last mostly having been brought as slaves.\\"What was New Netherland?\\", New Netherland Institute Though the colony officially existed only between 1609 and 1674, the descendants of the original settlers played a prominent role in colonial America. New Netherland culture characterized the region (today's Capital District, Hudson Valley, New York City, western Long Island, northern New Jersey and the Delaware Valley) for two centuries. The concepts of civil liberties and pluralism introduced in the province would later become a mainstay of American political and social life. Background In 1621, the Dutch West India Company was founded for the purpose of trade. The WIC was chartered by the States-General and given the authority to make contracts and alliances with princes and natives, build forts, administer justice, appoint and discharge governors, soldiers, and public officers, and promote trade in New Netherland.Sylvester, pp. 27-30 The colonial administration was relatively autonomous and the Company preferred to rule through agreements with local leaders. On the Atlantic coast were their bases for the slave trade and smuggling. In the Caribbean and partly in Brazil and Suriname, plantations were worked by native Indians and African slaves.Warren, George. (1667) An impartial description of Surinam. There were around 1,000 whites there, joined by Brazilian Jews, attracted by religious freedom which was granted to all the settlers. History The Dutch set up two forts, Fort Nassau in 1614 and Fort Orange in 1624, both named for the Dutch noble House of Orange-Nassau. New Amsterdam was founded in 1624. The ship Nieu Nederlandt departed with the first settlers, consisting of thirty Flemish Walloon families. The families were spread out over the entire territory claimed by the company. To the north a few families were left at the mouth of the Connecticut River, while to the south some families were settled at Burlington Island on the Delaware River. Others were left on Nut Island at the mouth of the Hudson River, while the remaining families were taken up the Hudson to Fort Orange. Later in 1624 and through 1625 six additional ships sailed for New Netherland with colonists, livestock and supplies. The southern outpost on the Delaware Bay was discontinued to focus the Company's resources on the area around New Amsterdam. The Dutch finally established a garrison at Bergen, which allowed settlement west of the Hudson within the province of New Netherland. Due to a war between the Mohawk and Mahican tribes in 1625, the women and children upriver at Fort Orange were re-located. In the spring of 1626, Minuit arrived to succeed Willem Verhulst, who had authorized the construction of a fort at the tip of Manhattan Island. Fort Amsterdam was designed by Cryn Fredericksz. Construction started in 1625. The third Director of New Netherland, Peter Minuit, was a German-born Huguenot who worked for the Dutch West India Company.The Dutch and English on the Hudson: Chapter 4. Kellscraft.com. Retrieved on 2013-07-23. Minuit purchased the island of Manhattan from the Lenape. In 1630, the managers of the West India Company, in order to tempt the ambition of capitalists, offered certain exclusive privileges to the members of the company. The realization that greater inducements had to be offered to increase the development of the colony led the West India Company to the creation of the so-called \\"patroon system\\". In 1629, the West India Company issued its charter of \\"Freedoms and Exemptions\\" by which it was declared that any member of the Company who could bring to and settle 50 persons over the age of 15 in New Netherland, should receive a liberal grant of land to hold as patroon, or lord, with the exception, per Article III, of the island of Manhattan. This land could have a frontage of if on one side of a river, or if situated on both sides. The patroon would be chief magistrate on his land, but disputes of more than 50 guilders could be appealed to the Director and his Council in New Amsterdam. The first of this vast estate or colony was established in 1630, on the banks of the Hudson River. Over a period of four years was entitled to a plot with 25 miles of front to the river, with exclusive rights to hunting and fishing, and civil jurisdiction and criminal on earth. In turn, the patroon brought livestock, implements and buildings. Tenants pay rent to the agent and gave him first option on surplus crops. The only restriction was that the colony had to be outside the island of Manhattan. A pattern of these colonies was the Manor of Rensselaerswyck. Everardus Bogardus the second minister of the Dutch Reformed Church, the oldest established church in present-day New York, frequently was combative with the Director-General of the New Netherlands and their management of the Dutch West India Company colony, going up against the often-drunk Wouter van Twiller and famously denouncing Willem Kieft from the pulpit during the colony's disastrously bloody Kieft's War (1643–1645). He stepped up his denouncements when Kieft tried to place a tax on beer. Bogardus himself has been described as a stout and rarely sober individual. A Council of Twelve Men was chosen on 1641 by the residents of New Amsterdam to advise the Director of New Netherland, Willem Kieft, on relations with the Native Americans due to the murder of Claes Swits. the council was not permanent, The next time a council of eight men was created. Peter Stuyvesant arrived in New Amsterdam on May 11, 1647 to replace Willem Kieft as Director-General of the New Netherland colony. Though the region became a British colony in 1674, it retained its \\"Dutch\\" character for many years as early settlers and their descendants developed the land and economy. Population Because of the dangers and hardships of life in the colony some colonists decided to return to the homeland in 1628. By 1630 the total population of New Netherland was about 300, many being French-speaking Walloons. It is estimated about 270 lived in the area surrounding Fort Amsterdam, primarily working as farmers, while about 30 were at Fort Orange, the center of the Hudson valley fur trade with the Mohawks. Population estimates are for the European and African population and do not include the Native Americans. * 1628: 270 * 1630: 300 * 1640: 500 * 1650: 800Joan Blaeu, Nova Belgica et Anglia Nova.

From 1340 Portugal colonized islands in the Atlantic. Colonization was a success and provided a growing population for other Atlantic colonies. The route from Europe passed through the Azores islands. By 1490 were 2,000 Flemings living in the islands of Terceira, Pico, Faial, São Jorge and Flores. Because there was such a large Flemish settlement, the Azores became known as the Flemish Islands or the Isles of Flanders. Prince Henry the Navigator was responsible for this settlement. His sister, Isabel, was married to Duke Philip of Burgundy who ruled Flanders. There were also Portuguese and Basque fishermen and sailors. Pietro Cesare Alberti, from Venice, is regarded as the first Italian settler in what is now New York State, having arrived in New Amsterdam in 1635. =Language= Though Dutch was the official language, and likely the lingua franca of the province, it was but one of many spoken there,Un-Pilgrims - Article by Russell Shorto as many as eighteen by the 1630s.accessed June 3, 2000 The Algonquin language had many dialects.

English was on the rise to become the vehicular language in world trade, and settlement by individuals or groups of English-speakers started early. The arrival of refugees from New Holland in Brazil may have brought more Portuguese, Spanish, and Judaeo-Spanish speakers. Commercial activity in the harbor, which included pirateering, could have been transacted simultaneously in any of a number of tongues. In some cases people Batavianized their namesThe American historian Charles W. Baird, in his book History of the Huguenot Emigration to America, qualified this type of abuse as \\"Batavian disguise\\". to conform with the Dutch vernacular and official language, which also greatly influenced place naming. English language speakers mostly arrived from New England and Long Island. In mid-seventeenth century, for political and religious unrest in England, emigrated to the Atlantic coast of North America, numerous Protestant Puritans, who settled in New Amsterdam. Among the early English settlers were two religious leaders, Anabaptist Lady Deborah Moody in 1645 and Anne Hutchinson, who took refuge in the province, as well as Elizabeth Hallet (nee Fones), niece of Massachusetts Governor John Winthrop, who sought refuge from religious persecution. =Religion= Although the Dutch West India Company had established the Reformed Church as the official religious institution of New Netherland, the early Dutch settlers planted the concept of tolerance as a legal right in North America as per explicit orders in 1624. They had to attract, \\"through attitude and by example\\", the natives and nonbelievers to God's word \\"without, on the other hand, to persecute someone by reason of his religion, and to leave everyone the freedom of his conscience.\\" Relations with the Lenape The arrival of the immigrants did not necessarily mean the departure of the indigenous people. There were fundamental differences in conceptions of property rights between the Europeans and the Lenape. The concept of ownership as understood by the Swannekins, or salt water people, was foreign to the Wilden, or natives.Ruttenber, E.M.,Indian Tribes of Hudson's River, (Hope Farm Press, 3rd ed, 2001) The exchange of gifts in the form of sewant or manufactured goods was perceived as trade agreement and defense alliance which included farming, hunting, and fishing rights. Often, the Indians did not vacate the property or reappeared as their migrational patterns dictated. The River Indians, such as the Wecquaesgeek, Hackensack, and Canarsee, within whose territories many European settlements were established, had regular and frequent contact with the New Netherlanders. After the Dutch arrival in the 1620s, the Lenape were successful in restricting Dutch settlement until the 1660s to Pavonia in present-day Jersey City along the Hudson. The Lenape's quick adoption of trade goods, and their need to trap furs to meet high European demand, resulted in their disastrous over-harvesting of the beaver population in the lower Hudson Valley. With the fur resources exhausted, the Dutch shifted their operations to present-day upstate New York. While the Lenape produced wampum in the vicinity of Manhattan Island, temporarily forestalling the negative effects of this decline in trade,Otto, Paul, 91 The Dutch-Munsee Encounter in America: The Struggle for Sovereignty in the Hudson Valley. New York: Berghahn Press, 2006. Dutch settlers founded a colony at present-day Lewes, Delaware, on June 3, 1631, and named it Zwaanendael (Swan Valley).Munroe, John A.: Colonial Delaware: A History: Millwood, New York: KTO Press; 1978; pp. 9-12 The colony had a short existence, as in 1632 a local band of Lenape Indians killed the 32 Dutch settlers after a misunderstanding escalated over Lenape defacement of the insignia of the Dutch West India Company.Cook, Albert Myers. Narratives of Early Pennsylvania, West New Jersey and Delaware 1630-1707. Charles Scribner's Sons, 1912, p. 9 In 1634, the Iroquoian-speaking Susquehannock went to war with the Lenape over access to trade with the Dutch at New Amsterdam. They defeated the Lenape, and some scholars believe that the Lenape may have become tributaries to the Susquehannock.Jennings (2000), p. 117. Lenape population fell, due mostly to epidemics of infectious diseases carried by Europeans, such as measles and smallpox, to which they had no natural immunity.

The village was founded probably in the 15th century CE. To the north lies the village and forest of Side (Сіде), to the east Horodyshche (Городище), to the south Mokriany (Мокряни) and to the west Vilshanyk (Вільшаник). Geographically, the area lies in the Dniester river basin, to which the Bystrytsia (Бистриця) and Cherkhavka (Черхавка) rivers are tributaries. Together with the villages of Kotovane (Котоване) and Stupnytsia (Ступниця), it administratively forms a local village council.  History  The village was first mentioned in 1538 in a document from 1559.\\"A.D. 1538 donat Magnificus Petrus Odrowaz Weryzy et illius successoribus, curiam alias dworyszcze \\"Waczewo\\" in villa Sielcze, cum pratis, agris, silvis, mericis, robetis, mellificiis, earumque decursibus, ad dictam aream Waczewo spectantibus, tum etiam Gurdium, alias Potok Uruszny nuncupatam, inter prata ejusdem areae decurrens cum ambabus ryppis. Quam donationem Sigismundus Augustus rex approbat A.D. 1559.\\" Rkp. Ossolineum, Nr. 2837, str. 81. King Michał Korybut Wiśniowiecki established the parish between 1669 and 1673, during which time a royal church was constructed. Another church with its own parish for the local Polish-speaking nobility (szlachta) was built later; both parishes coexisted before they later merged. While the area was crown property, the Dżurdż family was given half of it at an unknown date. Around 1650 King John II Casimir awarded the Cossack Ataman Skrebeciowicz the other half of the Sielec estate, as well as the right to bear the Sas coat of arms for his loyal services to the crown during the Khmelnytsky Uprising. After the Austrian partition of southern Poland in 1772, the Skrebeciowicz de Sielecki family’s noble status was reaffirmed by the imperial court in Vienna who gave it the hereditary German title of Ritter.War Archives (Kriegsarchiv) of the Austrian State Archives. According to historical documents, in 1880 Sielec had a total population of 781 inhabitants, of which 657 were Greek Catholics, thirty-two were Roman Catholics, eighty-five were Jewish, and seven were of other faiths. According to an 1889 census, 728 of the inhabitants at the time were ethnic \\"Ruthenians\\" (i. e. Rusyns or Ukrainians), 50 were Polish, and three were German-speaking (Galiziendeutsche). Furthermore, the town incorporated 172 houses in the same census; the manor house (dwór) and local lords’ estates employed around forty-seven people. The area changed hands multiple times: after the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian empire in 1918, Sielec reverted to newly independent Poland and administratively became a part of Lwów Voivodeship. In late September 1939, following German and Soviet aggression on Poland and Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, Lwów Voivodeship was divided by the two sides. Sielec was occupied by the Soviets and incorporated into Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, only to be overrun again by the invading German Wehrmacht in the summer of 1941. After the war it was finally incorporated into Ukraine. The population dropped substantially due to World War II and the Stalinist Soviet regime. The local Jewish population was murdered during the Holocaust; after the war, members of the local nobility as well as wealthier peasants and non-Ukrainians were either executed or deported to Siberia by the communists, where they perished in the gulags. Farmers were forced to hand over their land for collectivization. After the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989 and the collapse of the local kolkhoz, high unemployment forced many, especially young people, to leave for larger towns in flights of urbanization. The 2001 national census counted 164 inhabitants, and in 2009 the village consisted of around 40 houses, down from 300 in the past.  Sights  The area is marked by rolling hills and agricultural land rich with chornozem. The local economy consists mainly of farming, along with animal husbandry of cattle and horses. The manor house remains have been lost over time as well as the royal church mentioned in historical annals, while the church for the nobility still exists. The Greek Catholic Church of the Synaxis of the Theotokos () is located on a hill. With its belfry, it serves as an example of a rural wooden church in Ukraine. Constructed in the seventeenth century, it is surrounded by a historic cemetery. The church was funded by local nobility and used for worship by them—members would be buried there as well. It was closed and lay in a ruined state during the Communist era. Only after the end of the Soviet Union was the church restored, using local funds and donations. The church has a cross-shaped layout consisting of three parts: the narthex in the front, the central nave and the apse in the back, which is shielded by an iconostasis. The church is around eighteen meters long and eight meters wide; the nave measures less than six meters square. The exterior has a slightly different appearance than in the 1970s, when the towering roofs had to be replaced and made more simply than before. The nave is capped by a small octagonal dome that is richly decorated with religious paintings and painted in white and light blue. The floor is carpeted. The iconostasis probably dates to the nineteenth century. The nobility had reserved benches on the left side of the church, while the Ruthenian peasants would sit or stand to the right. The church is listed as a protected heritage site. The smaller Chapel of the Holy Apostles Peter and Paul is located close to the foot of the hill. Built of concrete, it is a smaller edifice constructed in 2000 to commemorate the second millennium and was dedicated on July 12, 2000. It replaced a previous wooden chapel that was originally used only by the local peasants. Located along the road leading to the village is the new cemetery. From Sielec en route to Drohobych lies a memorial site in a forest for the local Jewish population that was murdered during the Shoah.

The species was not described, however, until 1921, when Dorothy Kate Hughes published it as Stipa variabilis. This was its name until 1996, when the Australian species of Stipa were recognised as meriting their own genus. Thus Austrostipa was erected, and this and other species transferred into it.

The lodger, Terry Hartridge is the son of a wealthy man who is using his father's fortune to blaze a trail across the white lights of the city. He is spending his money carelessly and doesn't put any time in paying the bills, much to the dislike of the department store owner Timothy Black. These bills are delivered by the nobly Lottie Driscoll of the Robin Stock Company. After a while, Terry's money spending takes its toll. He finds out he is broke and turns home depressed, trying to shoot himself. Meanwhile, Julia secretly went into his apartment to read books when he was out. She hides at first, but reveals herself when she catches him trying to kill himself. She tries to stop him and offers to be his business manager to help him spending money the right way.

Seven years later, when Gordon comes back into Chas and Aaron's lives, he reveals his marriage to Sandra has broken down and he no longer has contact with his daughter, Liv (Isobel Steele). Two months later, Aaron and Robert Sugden (Ryan Hawley) track Sandra and Liv down to inform them that Gordon abused Aaron when he was a child. Sandra admits to Aaron that she knew about what Gordon did to him and kept quiet, causing Aaron to lose his temper and grab her by the arm.

The next day, when she returned, she had discovered Aaron's wet pyjamas in the bin. Sandra had believed that Aaron had wet himself and Gordon had got angry with him for this. Unknown to her, Gordon had raped Aaron but she never knew at the time. Gordon got rid of Aaron's pajamas after raping him. Sandra then reveals to Chas that the day before Aaron had left in 2008, she overheard Aaron and Gordon arguing in the bathroom and Aaron saying to Gordon \\"You can't do that to me anymore\\". Chas convinces Sandra to tell to give a statement to the police. After Gordon is found guilty of raping Aaron, Sandra makes plans to move to Dublin, but Liv is reluctant to go with her, as she wants to live with Aaron.

He tries to restart their relationship, but she is not interested. Bridget soon discovers that Shadrach is not Belle's father and sets up a meeting with Zak and Lisa, and tells them Belle is having behavioural problems. Zak and Lisa declare that Belle will start to behave but when she removes a security block on the computers, Bridget and the head teacher want to suspend Belle. This leads to an argument with Zak, and he removes Belle from the school. Bridget tries on several occasions to persuade Zak to let her return, but he refuses. Karen Williams Detective Sergeant Karen Williams is a police officer. She has appeared from 2006 to 2007 and from 2008 to 2009. DS Williams is first seen investigating the Christmas Day murder of Tom King (Ken Farrington) in 2006. The case against Tom's three sons Jimmy (Nick Miles), Matthew (Matt Healy) and Carl (Tom Lister) eventually collapses much to her frustration and she does not find out that Carl is the killer. Later in 2007, Williams investigates a fire at Tenant House started by Victoria Sugden (Isabel Hodgins) who confesses and Williams arrests and charges her. Andy Sugden (Kelvin Fletcher) then confesses to Williams that he had started a fire seven years earlier in which his adoptive mother Sarah Sugden (Alyson Spiro) was killed and Williams also arrests and charges him. Williams investigates the disappearance of Rosemary Sinclair (Linda Thorson) and arrests and charges Matthew with her murder but is forced to let him go when Rosemary is later found to have committed suicide in America. In March 2008, Williams arrests Viv Hope (Deena Payne) over her involvement in a children's charity fraud committed by Freddie Yorke (Keith Woodason). Although Viv claims that she removed the money she had put into the bogus charity when she realized what Freddie was doing, Williams believes that Viv was involved in the con as well and charges her. On 30 December 2008 she is called to a lake where a body has been found and she soon discovers it is the body of a colleague, PC Shane Doyle (Paul McEwan). She and DC Nick Henshall (Michael McKell) then lead the investigation into Shane's murder, and arrest and charge PC Ross Kirk (Samuel Anderson) with the murder but the case against him is later dropped. Later in January, Williams leads the search of the Dingles' house and arrests Eli Dingle (Joseph Gilgun) for Shane's murder. She and DC Henshall later arrive in the village to find Jasmine Thomas (Jenna-Louise Coleman) and Debbie Dingle (Charley Webb), who Eli revealed were Shane's killers. Jasmine runs away, but Debbie is arrested and later charged with murder. In early March, Jasmine returns and confesses to killing Shane in order to clear Debbie's name. Williams and Henshall interview her and she is later sentenced to four years imprisonment for manslaughter. DCI Grace Barraclough Grace Barraclough, portrayed by Glynis Barber, made her first appearance on 26 December 2006. DCI Grace Barraclough first appeared with her colleague DCI Vikesh Dasari (Stephen Rahman-Hughes), as part of the storyline surrounding the death of Tom King (Ken Farrington). While investigating Tom's murder, she suspected Bob Hope (Tony Audenshaw), even more so after he confessed. However, it emerged that he had confessed to protect his son Jamie (Alex Carter). She later started dating Carl King (Tom Lister) secretly, as a honeytrap. Their relationship became serious, however if they were discovered, Grace could lose her job. She carried on with the relationship, but when Vikesh saw her with Carl he gave her an ultimatum; end the relationship or he would tell her boss Charles Vaughan (Richard Cole) and her career would be over. (Vaughan was already angry with Grace for failing to get a conviction on the King case, amongst other things). Knowing what she must do, Grace ended the affair, even though she still loved Carl. After Grace ended the affair, Carl left the village, for a brief amount of time to get over Grace. When Carl returned however, he seduced Grace again. She tried again to end the relationship but when she learned that her mother had had a stroke, she regretted being so hard on Carl as he refused to be a shoulder to cry on. She stopped answering when he called; and later in the week, when Carl read about her mother's death in the paper, he resorted to waiting outside the police station and Grace's home in order to get her to speak to him. It finally worked, but she confessed that the first time they had had a drink together, she had followed him and was trying to trap him for information about the murder of Carl's father. Grace and Carl worked through their issues and their relationship was back on track. Grace died on 27 September after being hit by a lorry after Carl admitted to her that he had killed his father. Carl didn't attend her funeral but laid flowers at her grave later on. It was supposed that Matthew King (Matt Healy) had ordered her death. DCI Vikesh Dasari Detective Chief Inspector Vikesh Dasari is a local police officer. He appeared from 2006 to 2007. Detective Inspector Dasari appears in the village, with his CID colleague DCI Grace Barraclough (Glynis Barber), following the death of Tom King (Ken Farrington).

History Gimpel Fils was founded in November 1946. The first exhibition, Five Centuries of French Painting, was based on the small part of René Gimpel's collection that had been sent to London before the Second World War. The bulk of his stock was lost in Paris.\\"Obituary: Peter Gimpel\\", The Independent, 18 June 2005. Retrieved 2010-10-17. During the 1950s and 60s Gimpel Fils was highly influential in its association with the avant-garde. It supported modern British artists, including those of the St Ives School, as well as rising American artists and French abstract painters of the School of Paris. Gimpel Fils represented many of the major artists of the time, including Barbara Hepworth and Ben Nicholson. Nicholson moved to Gimpel Fils from the Lefevre Gallery and stayed until the early 1960s. In supporting the next generation of artists emerging in this period it gave first exhibitions to Lynn Chadwick, Anthony Caro, Peter Lanyon and Alan Davie, while also being associated with a number of other British artists, including Louis le Brocquy, Ivon Hitchens, Gillian Ayres, Bernard Meadows, Kenneth Armitage and Robert Adams. From France Gimpel Fils represented the likes of Marie Laurencin, Pierre Soulages, Nicolas de Staël, Serge Poliakoff and Yves Klein, as well as working with American artists such as Marcel Duchamp, Alexander Calder, Willem de Kooning, Sam Francis and Larry Rivers, who had his first London exhibition at the gallery in 1962.Obituary: Peter Gimpel, The Times, 2 July 2005. Link to InfoTrac National Newspapers Database (requires login). Retrieved 2012-10-17. An obituary of Peter Gimpel in The Independent newspaper suggested that: \\"Despite the rise of Marlborough Fine Art and stiff competition from the likes of the Redfern, Waddington and Hanover galleries, Gimpel Fils was for a time unrivaled in the range and quality of its artists.\\" The gallery continues to promote the work of that generation of artists, supporting the work of senior British painters such as Alan Davie and Albert Irvin, while also presenting retrospectives of 20th-century modern art. The contemporary programme has widened the range of work shown by the gallery and has developed to include artists such as Corinne Day, Andres Serrano, Callum Morton and Hannah Maybank. Gimpel Fils was initially based, briefly, at 86 Duke Street, London, before moving to 50 South Molton Street, where the artist Louis Le Brocquy laid a mosaic in the entrance. It relocated to its present premises at 30 Davies Street in 1972. The gallery was refurbished in 2000. The refurbishment was inaugurated with an installation by Richard Wilson. The Gimpel family retained a strong interest in the running of the gallery. The current co-director is René Gimpel, son of Charles and a fourth generation of the Gimpel family to become an art dealer.

Flowers range from white to purple. Taxonomy This species was first collected by Jacques Labillardière and published in his 1806 Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen under the name Bellis ciliaris. In 1832 Christian Friedrich Lessing transferred it into Brachyscome, and the name has been Brachyscome ciliaris ever since. Because it is such a variable species, specimens have often been referred to new species, and hence this species has many taxonomic synonyms, among them: Brachyscome drummondii Walp., Brachyscome ciliaris var. brachyglossa Gauba, Brachyscome dimorphocarpa G.L.R.Davis, Brachyscome billardierei Benth. and Brachyscome ciliaris var. lanuginosa (Steetz) Benth.. Three varieties are recognised: * B. ciliaris var. ciliaris * B. ciliaris var. lanuginosa * B. ciliaris var. subintegrifolia Distribution and habitat Geographically speaking, it is very widely distributed, occurring in every Australian state. It is somewhat restricted in terms of habitat, however, favouring red earths and grey sands over limestone or clay, in disturbed areas and on the margins of salt pans.

The temple is built in the Kalinga Architecture style.  Origin  The annual chandana yatra festival of Satyabadi Gopinatha It is said that a poor young man of the village, later named it as Sakhigopala, fell in love with the daughter of the village headman. However, being of a higher economic status, the headman opposed marriage between this young man and his daughter. The villagers, including the headman and the young man, went on a pilgrimage to Kashi. The village headman fell ill and was abandoned by fellow villagers. The young man tended to him so well that he soon got well and, in gratitude, promised his daughter in marriage to the young man. As soon as they returned to the village, the headman went back on his promise, asking the young man to produce a witness in support of his claim. Lord Gopala, impressed by the young man's devotion, agreed to come and bear witness to the promise on one condition: that the young man lead the way and he would follow, but the young man must never look back. He led the way to the village, passing a mound of sand. As they passed, the man could not hear the Lord's footsteps and turned back. Immediately the Lord turned into a statue of stone rooted to the spot. The villagers were still so impressed that God himself came to back the young man's claim that the youngsters were married off; they were later appointed as the first priests of the temple built in Lord Gopala's honour who came to bear witness (known in Sanskrit as Sakshi).  Deity's made by Vajra (grandson of Krishna)  King Vajra (the grandson of Lord Krishna) had 16 deities of Krishna and other gods carved from a rare, imperishable stone called Braja and built temples to house these deities in and around Mathura so as to feel the presence of Lord Krishna. The four presiding deities of Braja Mandala are Sri Harideva of Govardhan, Sri Keshava Deva of Mathura, Sri Baladeva of Baladeo, and Govindaji of Vrindavan. There are two Naths—Sri Nathji, who was originally at Govardhan and is now in Nathdwar, Rajasthan, and Sri Gopinath, who is now in Jaipur. The two Gopals are Sri Madana Mohana, who is now housed at Karoli Rajasthan, and Sakshi Gopala, who is now moved to the town of Sakhi Gopal, Odisha, near Puri.  Anla Navami  Gopalaji templeThe temple is famous for celebrating the annual Anla Navami Festival (Anla = gooseberry; Navami = ninth day in a lunar cycle). The festival is associated with the practice of touching Radha's feet (Radha was the legendary lover of Lord Krishna). Legend has it that the temple was originally without a statue of Radha. But when a girl named Lakhmi claimed to be the incarnation of Radha, and it is believed that Lord Krishna (here as Gopala) should not be without his true love Radha, a statue from northern India was installed here. The statue had originally Ghagra and Choli adorned but when it was clad on a traditional saree of Odisha, the feet of the statue was visible and the priests took it for a holy sign. From that day Anla Navami is celebrated and Hindu pilgrims are allowed inside the temple to touch the goddess's feet. Hundreds of thousands of devotees throng the temple on this holy occasion  Daily food offerings  The food offerings at Sakhigopala temple are made of wheat instead of rice. This is one of exceptional offerings among the worshipping processes of Vishnu temples all over the world, which is called prasada.  Bollywood Filmstar controversy  In 2009 while shooting for a Hindi movie on the premises of the temple, Shilpa Shetty a bollywood actress was alleged to have disrespected the temple. A complaint was filed where it was reported that she entered the temple with her shoes on which goes against established Hindu practice.

The temple is located nearby the banks of the Mahanadi River. It is famous for the annual Durga Puja and Kali Puja festivals. The Durga Puja festivities are prominent in Maa Katak Chandi temple which takes place for 16 days starting from dark fortnight of Ashwina Krishna Ashtami till Ashwina shukla navami and Vijayadashami. The goddess popularly called as Maa Katak Chandi, sits and rules on the heart of the ancient city. She has four hands holding Paasha (noose), Ankusha (goad), gestures dispelling fear (Abhaya), and granting boon (Varada). She is worshiped as Bhuvaneshvari Mahavidya (the queen of universe) by Sevayatas belonging to Utkala Brahmins every day. Maa Chandi is worshipped in various incarnations of Durga during the puja. In Cuttack, people strongly believe Maa Katak Chandi as 'The Living Goddess'. Goddess Katak Chandi  Legend behind founding  According to legend, the present piece of land, where the holy temple is located, was lying fallow before. Late Sri Hansa Panda, who happens to be the Purohit of the then King of Kanika, used to graze cattle’s and sheep’s in the land. One day Sri Panda was feeling tired and took rest on a heap of dry mud present there. While taking rest, he experienced a strange unusual feeling within himself. Surprisingly on the same night, The Goddess \\"Chandika\\" appeared in his dream and requested him to take her out of the land. There after he went to the King and told everything about the strange experience he had that night. With the help of the king, Late Hansa Panda dug up the same piece of land. It is being said that around forty numbers bullock carts of Red Sindoor came out while digging and then emerged The Deity of Maa Katak Chandi. Then the temple was built on the same land. Here in Cuttack, the residents strongly believe Maa Katak Chandi as The Living Goddess. The temple of Maa Katak Chandi, the presiding deity of the city is visited by hundreds of devotees every day. The image of the deity is older than the temple. It is believed that she was the family deity of Gajapati Kingdom in the medieval age, due to Islamic invaders' attacks she was buried while the kings migrated to Puri. Chandi Bhoga History Late Sri Hansa Panda started worshiping the Deity with utmost Niti, Nistha, and Sraddha. As per the scriptures related to Goddess Chandika or Bhuvaneshwari has four hands, showing weapons and gestures as Paasa, Ankusha, Abhaya, Varada. She is worshipped as Bhuvaneswari while chanting Bhuvaneswari Mantra. After Late Sri Hansa Panda, his only son Late Sri Lakshmana Panda started worshipping The Goddess in the same process and procedure. He was blessed with four daughters, named Champa, Tulasi, Mali and Malati. Those daughters were also helping their father Late Sri Lakshmana Panda, in the rituals (Seva Puja) of the Deity. Late Lakshmana panda always prayed Maa Chandi to have a son and after praying so many days, he was blessed with a son, named Sri Dayanidhi Panda, who also followed the footprint of his predecessors. The temple came to lime light during Sri Dayanidhi Panda. Number of devotees increased during his period. He has six sons, who are presently performing rituals (seva puja) of deity. They are namely Sri Narayan Panda, Sri Narahari Panda, Sri Somnath Panda, Sri Chakradhar Panda, Sri Loknath Panda and Sri Ratnakar Panda. The above hereditary sevaks along with their fourteen sons are presently performing the Seva Puja (Rituals) in the Temple. The fourteen sons are Jagabandhu, Dinabandhu, Bikram, Gopal, Sarat Kumar, Sukhadeva, Bhagadeba, Manoj, Trilochan, Susant, Biswaranjan, Ramachandra, Pramod, Ranjit. It was established in the year 1946. Present Status of the Land of the Deity Raja Shriman Shailendra Narayan Bhanjadeo of Kanika was declared as Hereditary Trustee by High Court, while Dayanidhi Panda’s family vested as Hereditary Sevaka. Again, the Honorable High Court gave the order to frame a scheme for the temple. Now the institution of Kataka Chandi is managed under the said scheme. The management board comprises reputed persons of the locality along with top government officials for the management of the holy institution. One Executive Officer has been appointed by the commissioner to look after the functions of the temple.

It is a special case of the integer knapsack problem, and has applications wider than just currency. It is also the most common variation of the coin change problem, a general case of partition in which, given the available denominations of an infinite set of coins, the objective is to find out the number of possible ways of making a change for a specific amount of money, without considering the order of the coins. It is weakly NP-hard, but may be solved optimally in pseudo-polynomial time by dynamic programming. Mathematical definition Coin values can be modeled by a set of distinct positive integer values (whole numbers), arranged in increasing order as through . The problem is: given an amount , also a positive integer, to find a set of non-negative (positive or zero) integers }, with each representing how often the coin with value is used, which minimize the total number of coins : f(W)=\\\\sum_{j=1}^n x_j subject to : \\\\sum_{j=1}^n w_j x_j = W. Non-currency examples An application of change-making problem can be found in computing the ways one can make a nine dart finish in a game of darts. Another application is computing the possible atomic (or isotopic) composition of a given mass/charge peak in mass spectrometry. Methods of solvingSimple dynamic programming= A classic dynamic programming strategy works upward by finding the combinations of all smaller values that would sum to the current threshold. Thus, at each threshold, all previous thresholds are potentially considered to work upward to the goal amount W. For this reason, this dynamic programming approach requires a number of steps that is O(nW), where n is the number of types of coins.  Implementation  The following is a dynamic programming implementation (with Python 3) which uses a matrix to keep track of the optimal solutions to sub-problems, and returns the minimum number of coins, or \\"Infinity\\" if there is no way to make change with the coins given. A second matrix may be used to obtain the set of coins for the optimal solution. def _get_change_making_matrix(set_of_coins, r: int): m = 0 for _ in range(r + 1)] for _ in range(len(set_of_coins) + 1)] for i in range(1, r + 1): m[0][i] = float('inf') # By default there is no way of making change return m def change_making(coins, n: int): \\"\\"\\"This function assumes that all coins are available infinitely. n is the number to obtain with the fewest coins. coins is a list or tuple with the available denominations. \\"\\"\\" m = _get_change_making_matrix(coins, n) for c in range(1, len(coins) + 1): for r in range(1, n + 1): # Just use the coin coins[c - 1]. if coins[c - 1]  r: m[c][r] = 1 # coins[c - 1] cannot be included. # Use the previous solution for making r, # excluding coins[c - 1]. elif coins[c - 1] > r: m[c][r] = m[c - 1][r] # coins[c - 1] can be used. # Decide which one of the following solutions is the best: # 1. Using the previous solution for making r (without using coins[c - 1]). # 2. Using the previous solution for making r - coins[c - 1] (without # using coins[c - 1]) plus this 1 extra coin. else: m[c][r] = min(m[c - 1][r], 1 + m[c][r - coins[c - 1 ) return m[-1][-1] =Dynamic programming with the probabilistic convolution tree= The probabilistic convolution tree can also be used as a more efficient dynamic programming approach. The probabilistic convolution tree merges pairs of coins to produce all amounts which can be created by that pair of coins (with neither coin present, only the first coin present, only the second coin present, and both coins present), and then subsequently merging pairs of these merged outcomes in the same manner. This process is repeated until the final two collections of outcomes are merged into one, leading to a balanced binary tree with W log(W) such merge operations. Furthermore, by discretizing the coin values, each of these merge operations can be performed via convolution, which can often be performed more efficiently with the fast Fourier transform (FFT). In this manner, the probabilistic convolution tree may be used to achieve a solution in sub-quadratic number of steps: each convolution can be performed in n log(n), and the initial (more numerous) merge operations use a smaller n, while the later (less numerous) operations require n on the order of W. The probabilistic convolution tree-based dynamic programming method also efficiently solves the probabilistic generalization of the change-making problem, where uncertainty or fuzziness in the goal amount W makes it a discrete distribution rather than a fixed quantity, where the value of each coin is likewise permitted to be fuzzy (for instance, when an exchange rate is considered), and where different coins may be used with particular frequencies. =Greedy method= For the so-called canonical coin systems, like those used in the US and many other countries, a greedy algorithm of picking the largest denomination of coin which is not greater than the remaining amount to be made will produce the optimal result. This is not the case for arbitrary coin systems, though. For instance, if the coin denominations were 1, 3 and 4, then to make 6, the greedy algorithm would choose three coins (4,1,1) whereas the optimal solution is two coins (3,3).  Related problems  The \\"optimal denomination problem\\" is a problem for people who design entirely new currencies. It asks what denominations should be chosen for the coins in order to minimize the average cost of making change, that is, the average number of coins needed to make change? The version of this problem assumed that the people making change will use the minimum number of coins (from the denominations available). One variation of this problem assumes that the people making change will use the \\"greedy algorithm\\" for making change, even when that requires more than the minimum number of coins. Most current currencies use a 1-2-5 series, but some other set of denominations would require fewer denominations of coins or a smaller average number of coins to make change or both.

The world's highest-paid actress since 2018, she has made multiple appearances in the Forbes Celebrity 100. Her films have grossed over worldwide, making Johansson the ninth-highest-grossing box office star of all time. She is the recipient of several accolades, including a Tony Award and a BAFTA Award, as well as nominations for two Academy Awards and five Golden Globe Awards. Born and raised in Manhattan, New York City, Johansson aspired to be an actress from a young age and first appeared on stage in an Off- Broadway play as a child actor. She made her film debut in the fantasy comedy North (1994), and gained early recognition for her roles in Manny & Lo (1996), The Horse Whisperer (1998), and Ghost World (2001). Johansson shifted to adult roles in 2003 with her performances in Lost in Translation, which won her a BAFTA Award for Best Actress, and Girl with a Pearl Earring. She was nominated for Golden Globe Awards for these films, and for playing an estranged teenager in the drama A Love Song for Bobby Long (2004), and a seductress in the psychological thriller Match Point (2005). Other works during this period include The Prestige (2006) and Vicky Cristina Barcelona (2008); and the albums Anywhere I Lay My Head (2008) and Break Up (2009), both of which charted on the Billboard 200. In 2010, Johansson debuted on Broadway in a revival of A View from the Bridge, which won her a Tony Award for Best Featured Actress, and began playing the role of Black Widow in the Marvel Cinematic Universe with Iron Man 2. Johansson went on to star in the science fiction films Her (2013), Under the Skin (2013), Lucy (2014), and Ghost in the Shell (2017). She received critical acclaim and two Academy Award nominations for playing an actress going through a divorce in the drama Marriage Story and a single mother in Nazi Germany in the satire Jojo Rabbit (both 2019). As a public figure, Johansson is a prominent brand endorser and supports various charities. She has been cited as a Hollywood sex symbol by various media outlets. She was married to Canadian actor Ryan Reynolds from 2008 to 2011, and to French businessman Romain Dauriac, with whom she has a child, from 2014 to 2017.  Early life  The alt=A red-brick three-story building with a tree outside it. Scarlett Ingrid Johansson was born in the New York City borough of Manhattan, on November 22, 1984. Her father, Karsten Olaf Johansson, is an architect originally from Copenhagen, Denmark. Her paternal grandfather, Ejner Johansson, was an art historian, screenwriter, and film director, and his father was Swedish.Stated on Finding Your Roots, PBS, October 31, 2017 Scarlett's mother, Melanie Sloan, a New Yorker, has worked as a producer. She comes from an Ashkenazi Jewish family from Poland and Russia, originally surnamed Schlamberg, and Scarlett has described herself as Jewish. She has an older sister, Vanessa, also an actress; an older brother, Adrian; and a twin brother, Hunter. Johansson also has an older half-brother, Christian, from her father's first marriage. She holds both American and Danish citizenship. Johansson attended PS 41, an elementary school in Greenwich Village, Manhattan. Her parents divorced when she was 13. Johansson was particularly close to her maternal grandmother, Dorothy Sloan, a bookkeeper and schoolteacher; they often spent time together and Johansson considered Sloan her best friend. Interested in a career in the spotlight from an early age, she often put on song-and-dance routines for her family. She was particularly fond of musical theater and jazz hands. She took lessons in tap dance, and states that her parents were supportive of her career choice. She describes her childhood as very ordinary. As a child, Johansson practiced acting by staring in the mirror until she made herself cry, wanting to be Judy Garland in Meet Me in St. Louis. At age seven, she was devastated when a talent agent signed one of her brothers instead of her, but she later decided to become an actress anyway. She enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute, and began auditioning for commercials, but soon lost interest: \\"I didn't want to promote Wonder Bread.\\" She shifted her focus to film and theater, making her first stage appearance in the Off-Broadway play Sophistry with Ethan Hawke, in which she had two lines. Around this time, she began studying at Professional Children's School (PCS), a private educational institution for aspiring child actors in Manhattan. At age nine, Johansson made her film debut as John Ritter's daughter in the fantasy comedy North (1994). She says that when she was on the film set, she knew intuitively what to do. Johansson later played minor roles including as the daughter of Sean Connery and Kate Capshaw's characters in the mystery thriller Just Cause (1995), and an art student in If Lucy Fell (1996).  Acting career  Early roles (1996–2002) = Johansson's first leading role was as Amanda, the younger sister of a pregnant teenager who runs away from her foster home in Manny & Lo (1996) alongside Aleksa Palladino and her brother, Hunter. Her performance received positive reviews: one written for the San Francisco Chronicle noted, \\"[the film] grows on you, largely because of the charm of ... Scarlett Johansson,\\" while critic Mick LaSalle, writing for the same paper, commented on her \\"peaceful aura\\", and believed, \\"If she can get through puberty with that aura undisturbed, she could become an important actress.\\" Johansson earned a nomination for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Lead Female for the role. After appearing in minor roles in Fall and Home Alone 3 (both 1997), Johansson attracted wider attention for her performance in the film The Horse Whisperer (1998), directed by Robert Redford. The drama film, based on the 1995 novel of the same name by Nicholas Evans, tells the story of a talented trainer with a gift for understanding horses, who is hired to help an injured teenager played by Johansson. The actress received an \\"introducing\\" credit on this film, although it was her seventh role. On Johansson's maturity, Redford described her as \\"13 going on 30\\". Todd McCarthy of Variety commented that Johansson \\"convincingly conveys the awkwardness of her age and the inner pain of a carefree girl suddenly laid low by horrible happenstance\\". For the film, she was nominated for the Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Most Promising Actress. She believed that the film changed many things in her life, realizing that acting is the ability to manipulate one's emotions. On finding good roles as a teenager, Johansson said it was hard for her as adults wrote the scripts and they \\"portray kids like mall rats and not seriously ... Kids and teenagers just aren't being portrayed with any real depth\\". Johansson later appeared in My Brother the Pig (1999) and in the neo- noir, Coen brothers film The Man Who Wasn't There (2001). Her breakthrough came playing a cynical outcast in Terry Zwigoff's black comedy Ghost World (2001), an adaptation of Daniel Clowes' graphic novel of the same name. Johansson auditioned for the film via a tape from New York, and Zwigoff believed her to be \\"a unique, eccentric person, and right for that part\\". The film premiered at the 2001 Seattle International Film Festival; it was a box office failure, but has since developed a cult status. Johansson was credited with \\"sensitivity and talent [that] belie her age\\" by an Austin Chronicle critic, and won a Toronto Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance. With David Arquette, Johansson appeared in the horror comedy Eight Legged Freaks (2002), about a collection of spiders that are exposed to toxic waste, causing them to grow to gigantic proportions and begin killing and harvesting. After graduating from Professional Children's School that year, she applied to New York University's Tisch School of the Arts; she decided to focus on her film career when she was rejected. = Transition to adult roles (2003–2004) = Johansson transitioned from teen to adult roles with two films in 2003: the romantic comedy-drama Lost in Translation and the drama Girl with a Pearl Earring. In the former, directed by Sofia Coppola, she plays Charlotte, a listless and lonely young wife, opposite Bill Murray. Coppola had first noticed Johansson in Manny & Lo, and compared her to a young Lauren Bacall; Coppola based the film's story on the relationship between Humphrey Bogart and Bacall in The Big Sleep (1946). Johansson found the experience of working with a female director different because of Coppola's ability to empathize with her. Made on a budget of $4million, the film earned $119million at the box office and received positive reviews. Roger Ebert was pleased with the film and described the lead actors' performances as \\"wonderful\\", and Entertainment Weekly wrote of Johansson's \\"embracing, restful serenity\\". The New York Times praised Johansson, aged 17 at the time of filming, for playing an older character. alt=A picture of Scarlett Johansson wearing a black dress and a pearl necklace. In Peter Webber's Girl with a Pearl Earring, which is based on the novel of the same name by Tracy Chevalier, Johansson played Griet, a young 17th-century servant in the household of the Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer (played by English actor Colin Firth). Webber interviewed 150 actors before casting Johansson. Johansson found the character moving, but did not read the novel, as she thought it was better to approach the story with a fresh start. Girl with a Pearl Earring received positive reviews and was profitable. In his review for The New Yorker, Anthony Lane thought that her presence kept the film \\"alive\\", writing, \\"She is often wordless and close to plain onscreen, but wait for the ardor with which she can summon a closeup and bloom under its gaze; this is her film, not Vermeer's, all the way.\\" Owen Gleiberman, of Entertainment Weekly noted her \\"nearly silent performance\\", observing, \\"The interplay on her face of fear, ignorance, curiosity, and sex is intensely dramatic.\\" She was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role and Golden Globe Awards for Best Actress for both films in 2003, winning the former for Lost in Translation. In Variety opinion, Johansson's roles in Lost in Translation and Girl with a Pearl Earring established her as among the most versatile actresses of her generation. Johansson had five releases in 2004, three of which—the teen heist film The Perfect Score, the drama A Love Song for Bobby Long, and the drama A Good Woman—were critical and commercial failures. Co-starring with John Travolta, Johansson played a discontented and suspicious teenager in A Love Song for Bobby Long, which is based on the novel Off Magazine Street by Ronald Everett Capps. Variety David Rooney wrote that Johansson's and Travolta's portrayals rescued the film. Johansson earned a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Drama nomination for the film. In her fourth release in 2004, the live-action animated comedy The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, Johansson voiced Princess Mindy, the daughter of King Neptune. She took the part because of her love for cartoons and The Ren & Stimpy Show. The film was her most commercially successful work that year. She followed it with In Good Company, a comedy-drama in which she complicates the life of her father when she dates his much younger boss. Reviews of the film were generally positive, describing it as \\"witty and charming\\". Roger Ebert was impressed with Johansson's portrayal, writing that she \\"continues to employ the gravitational pull of quiet fascination\\". She would then reprise her role as Mindy in the video game adaptation of the film. = Films with Woody Allen (2005–2009) = Johansson played Nola, an aspiring actress who begins an affair with a married man (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) in Woody Allen's drama Match Point in 2005. After replacing Kate Winslet with Johansson for the role, Allen changed the character's nationality from British to American. As an admirer of Allen's films, Johansson liked the idea of working with him, but felt nervous her first day on the set. The New York Times was impressed with Johansson and Rhys Meyers' performances, and Mick LaSalle, writing in the San Francisco Chronicle, said that Johansson \\"is a powerhouse from the word go\\", with a performance that \\"borders on astonishing\\". The film, a box office success, earned Johansson nominations for the Golden Globe and the Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting Actress. Also that year, Johansson underwent a tonsillectomy, after which she starred with Ewan McGregor in Michael Bay's science fiction film The Island, in dual roles as Sarah Jordan and her clone, Jordan Two Delta. Johansson found her filming schedule exhausting: she had to shoot for 14 hours a day, and she hit her head and injured herself. The film received mixed reviews and grossed $163million against a $126million budget. Johansson on the set of Vicky Cristina Barcelona in 2007 Two of Johansson's films in 2006 explored the world of stage magicians, both opposite Hugh Jackman. Allen cast her opposite Jackman and himself in the film Scoop (2006), in which she played a journalism student. The film was a modest worldwide box office success, but polarized critics. Ebert was critical of the film, but found Johansson \\"lovely as always\\", and Mick LaSalle noted the freshness she brought to her part. She also appeared in Brian De Palma's The Black Dahlia, a film noir shot in Los Angeles and Bulgaria. Johansson later said she was a fan of DePalma and had wanted to work with him on the film, but thought that she was unsuitable for the part. Anne Billson of The Daily Telegraph likewise found her miscast. However, CNN said that she \\"takes to the pulpy period atmosphere as if it were oxygen\\". Also in 2006, Johansson starred in the short film When the Deal Goes Down to accompany Bob Dylan's song \\"When the Deal Goes Down...\\" from the album Modern Times. Johansson had a supporting role of assistant and lover of Jackman's character, an aristocratic magician, in Christopher Nolan's mystery thriller The Prestige (2006). Nolan thought Johansson possessed \\"ambiguity\\" and \\"a shielded quality\\". She was fascinated with Nolan's directing methods and liked working with him. The film was a critical and box office success, recommended by the Los Angeles Times as \\"an adult, provocative piece of work\\". Some critics were skeptical of her performance: Billson again judged her miscast, and Dan Jolin in Empire magazine criticized her English accent. Johansson's only work in 2007 was in the critically panned comedy-drama The Nanny Diaries alongside Chris Evans and Laura Linney, where she plays a college graduate working as a nanny. Reviews of her performance were mixed; Variety wrote, \\"[She] essays an engaging heroine\\", and The New Yorker criticized her for looking \\"merely confused\\" while \\"trying to give the material a plausible emotional center\\". In 2008, Johansson starred, with Natalie Portman and Eric Bana, in The Other Boleyn Girl, which also earned mixed reviews. Promoting the film, Johansson and Portman appeared on the cover of W, discussing with the magazine the public's reception of them. In Rolling Stone, Pete Travers criticized the film for \\"[moving] in frustrating herks and jerks\\", but thought that the duo were the only positive aspect of the production. Variety credited the cast as \\"almost flawless ... at the top of its game\\", citing \\"Johansson's quieter Mary ... as the [film's] emotional center\\". In her third collaboration with Woody Allen, the romantic comedy- drama Vicky Cristina Barcelona (2008), which was filmed in Spain, Johansson plays one of the love interests of Javier Bardem's character alongside Penélope Cruz. The film was one of Allen's most profitable and received favorable reviews. A reviewer in Variety described Johansson as \\"open and malleable\\" compared to the other actors. She also played the femme fatale Silken Floss in The Spirit, based on the newspaper comic strip of the same name by Will Eisner. It received poor reviews from critics, who deemed it melodramatic, unoriginal, and sexist. Johansson's only role in 2009 was as Anna Marks, a yoga instructor, in the ensemble comedy-drama He's Just Not That into You (2009). The film was released to tepid reviews, but was a box office success. = Marvel Cinematic Universe and stage roles (2010–2013) = Johansson had aspired to appear on Broadway since her childhood. She made her debut in a 2010 revival of Arthur Miller's drama A View from the Bridge. Set in the 1950s, in an Italian-American neighborhood in New York, it tells the tragic tale of Eddie (played by Liev Schreiber), who has an inappropriate love for his wife's orphaned niece, Catherine (played by Johansson). After some reservations about playing a teenage character, Johansson agreed to the play when a friend convinced her to take on the part. Ben Brantley of The New York Times wrote of Johansson's performance that she \\"melts into her character so thoroughly that her nimbus of celebrity disappears\\". Varietys David Rooney was impressed with the play and Johansson in particular, describing her as the chief performer. She won the 2010 Tony Award for Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Play. Some critics and Broadway actors criticized the award committee's decision to reward the work of mainstream Hollywood actors, including Johansson. In response, she said that she understood the frustration, but had worked hard for her accomplishments. Johansson played Black Widow in Jon Favreau's Iron Man 2 (2010), a part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Before she secured the role, she dyed her hair red to convince Favreau that she was right for the part, and undertook stunt and strength training to prepare for the role. Johansson said the character resonated with her, and she admired the superhero's human traits. The film earned $623.9million against its $200million budget, and received generally positive reviews from critics, although reviewers criticized how her character was written. Tim Robey of The Daily Telegraph and Matt Goldberg thought that she had little to do but look attractive. In 2011, Johansson played the role of Kelly, a zookeeper in the family film We Bought a Zoo alongside Matt Damon. The film got mainly favorable reviews, and Anne Billson praised Johansson for bringing depth to a rather uninteresting character. Johansson earned a Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie Actress: Drama nomination for her performance. Johansson at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival Johansson learned some Russian from a former teacher on the phone for her role as Black Widow in The Avengers (2012), another entry from the MCU. The film received mainly positive reviews and broke many box office records, becoming the third highest-grossing film both in the United States and worldwide. For her performance, she was nominated for two Teen Choice Awards and three People's Choice Awards. Later that year, Johansson portrayed the actress Janet Leigh in Sacha Gervasi's Hitchcock, a behind-the-scenes drama about the making of Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 film Psycho. Roger Ebert wrote that Johansson did not look much like Leigh, but conveyed her spunk, intelligence, and sense of humor. In January 2013, Johansson starred in a Broadway revival of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, directed by Rob Ashford. Set in the Mississippi Delta, it examines the relationships within the family of Big Daddy (played by Ciarán Hinds), primarily between his son Brick (played by Benjamin Walker) and Maggie (played by Johansson). Her performance received mixed reviews. Entertainment Weeklys Thom Geier wrote, \\"Scarlett Johansson brings a fierce fighting spirit\\" to her part, but Joe Dziemianowicz from Daily News called her performance \\"alarmingly one-note\\". The 2013 Sundance Film Festival hosted the premiere of Joseph Gordon-Levitt's directorial debut, Don Jon. In this romantic comedy- drama, she plays a woman perplexed by the pornography-addicted title character. Gordon-Levitt wrote the role for Johansson, who had previously admired his acting work. The film received positive reviews and Johansson's performance was highlighted by critics. Claudia Puig of USA Today considered it one of her best performances. In 2013, Johansson voiced the character Samantha, an intelligent computer operating system, in Spike Jonze's film Her, replacing Samantha Morton in the role. The film premiered at the 8th Rome International Film Festival, where Johansson won Best Actress; she was also nominated for the Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Supporting Actress. Johansson was intimidated by the role's complexity, and considered her recording sessions for the role challenging but liberating. Peter Travers believed Johansson's voice in the film was \\"sweet, sexy, caring, manipulative, scary [and] award-worthy\\". Time magazine's Richard Corliss called her performance \\"seductive and winning\\", and Her was rated as one of the best films of 2013. She also won the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress at the 40th Saturn Awards in 2014 for her performance. Johansson was cast in the role of an alien who preys on men in Scotland in Jonathan Glazer's science fiction movie Under the Skin (2013). The film, an adaptation of Michel Faber's novel of the same name, took nine years to complete. For the role, she learned to drive a van and speak with an English accent. Johansson improvised conversations with non-professional actors on the street, who did not know they were being filmed. It was released to generally positive reviews, with particular praise for Johansson. Erin Whitney, writing for HuffPost, considered it her best performance to date, and noted that it was her first fully nude role. Author Maureen Foster wrote, \\"How much depth, breadth, and range Johansson mines from her character's very limited allowance of emotional response is a testament to her acting prowess that is, as the film goes on, increasingly stunning.\\" It earned Johansson a BIFA Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a British Independent Film nomination. = Action and superhero films (2014–present) = Continuing her work in the MCU, Johansson reprised her role as Black Widow in Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014). In the film, she joins forces with Captain America (Chris Evans) and Falcon (Anthony Mackie) to uncover a conspiracy within S.H.I.E.L.D., while facing a mysterious assassin known as the Winter Soldier. Johansson and Evans wrote their own dialogue for several scenes they had together. Johansson was attracted to her character's way of doing her job, employing her feminine wiles and not her physical appeal. The film was a critical and commercial success, grossing over $714million worldwide. Critic Odie Henderson saw \\"a genuine emotional shorthand at work, especially from Johansson, who is excellent here\\". The role earned her a Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress nomination. César Awards ceremony in Paris in 2014alt=Scarlett Johansson, wearing a dark blue coat, smiles to her left. Johansson played a supporting role in the film Chef (2014), alongside Robert Downey, Jr., Sofía Vergara, and director Jon Favreau. It grossed over $45million at the box office and was well received by critics. The Chicago Sun-Times writer Richard Roeper found the film \\"funny, quirky and insightful, with a bounty of interesting supporting characters\\". In Luc Besson's science fiction action film Lucy (2014), Johansson starred as the title character, who gains psychokinetic abilities when a nootropic drug is absorbed into her bloodstream. Besson discussed the role with several actresses, and cast Johansson based on her strong reaction to the script and her discipline. Critics generally praised the film's themes, visuals, and Johansson's performance; some found the plot nonsensical. IGN's Jim Vejvoda attributed the film's success to her acting and Besson's style. The film grossed $458million on a budget of $40million to become the 18th highest-grossing film of 2014. In 2015 and 2016, Johansson again played Black Widow in the MCU films Avengers: Age of Ultron and Captain America: Civil War. During filming of the former, a mixture of close-ups, concealing costumes, stunt doubles and visual effects were used to hide her pregnancy. Both films earned more than $1.1billion, ranking among the highest-grossing films of all time. For Captain America: Civil War, Johansson earned her second nomination for Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Actress in an Action Movie and her fourth for Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress. Earlier in 2016, Johansson had featured in the Coen brothers' well-received comedy film Hail, Caesar! about a \\"fixer\\" working in the classical Hollywood cinema, trying to discover what happened to a cast member who vanished during the filming of a biblical epic; Johansson plays an actress who becomes pregnant while her film is in production. She also voiced Kaa in Jon Favreau's live-action adaptation of Disney's The Jungle Book, and Ash in the animated musical comedy film Sing (both 2016). That year she also narrated an audiobook of Lewis Carroll's children's novel Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. Johansson played Motoko Kusanagi in Rupert Sanders's 2017 film adaptation of the Ghost in the Shell franchise. The film was praised for its visual style, acting, and cinematography, but was controversial for whitewashing the cast, particularly Johansson's character, a cyborg who was meant to hold the memories of a Japanese woman. Responding to the criticism, she said she would never play a person of another race, but wanted to take the rare opportunity to star in a franchise with a female protagonist. The film grossed $169.8million worldwide against a production budget of $110million. In March 2017, Johansson hosted Saturday Night Live for the fifth time, making her the 17th person, and the fourth woman, to enter the NBC sketch comedy's prestigious Five-Timers Club. Johansson's next 2017 film was the comedy Rough Night, where she played Jess Thayer, one of the five friends—alongside Kate McKinnon, Jillian Bell, Ilana Glazer, and Zoë Kravitz—whose bachelorette party goes wrong after a male stripper dies. The film had a mixed critical reception and moderate box office returns. In 2018, Johansson voiced show dog Nutmeg in Wes Anderson's stop- motion animated film Isle of Dogs, released in March, and reprised her MCU role as Black Widow in Avengers: Infinity War, which followed the next month. Johansson was due to star in Rub & Tug, a biographical film in which she would have played Dante \\"Tex\\" Gill, a transgender man who operated a massage parlor and prostitution ring in the 1970s and 1980s. She dropped out of the project after backlash against the casting of a cisgender woman playing a transgender person. In 2019, Johansson once again reprised her role as Black Widow in Avengers: Endgame, which is the highest-grossing film of all time. She next starred in Noah Baumbach's Netflix film Marriage Story, in which Adam Driver and she played a warring couple who file for divorce. She found a connection with her part, as she was amidst her own divorce proceeding at the time. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian commended her \\"brilliantly textured\\" performance in it. She also took on the supporting role of a young boy's mother who shelters a Jewish girl in Nazi Germany in Taika Waititi's satire Jojo Rabbit. Waititi created Johansson's character based on his own mother, and cast her to provide her a rare opportunity to perform comedy. The film received polarizing reviews, but Stephanie Zacharek labeled her the \\"lustrous soul of the movie.\\" Johansson received her first two Academy Award nominations, for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress for her performances in Marriage Story and Jojo Rabbit, respectively, becoming the eleventh performer to be nominated for two Oscars in the same year. She also received two BAFTA nominations for these films, and a Golden Globe nomination for the former. Johansson will reprise her role as Black Widow in her own upcoming solo prequel film directed by Cate Shortland.  Music career  Johansson at the 2008 alt=Johansson in a purple dress, standing next to a piano and holding a microphone In 2006, Johansson sang the track \\"Summertime\\" for Unexpected DreamsSongs From the Stars, a non- profit collection of songs recorded by Hollywood actors. She performed with the Jesus and Mary Chain for a Coachella reunion show in Indio, California, in April 2007. The following year, Johansson appeared as the leading lady in Justin Timberlake's music video, for \\"What Goes Around... Comes Around\\", which was nominated for an MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year. In May 2008, Johansson released her debut album Anywhere I Lay My Head, which consists of one original song and ten cover versions of Tom Waits songs, and features David Bowie and members from the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and Celebration. Reviews of the album were mixed. Spin was not particularly impressed with Johansson's singing. Some critics found it to be \\"surprisingly alluring\\", \\"a bravely eccentric selection\\", and \\"a brilliant album\\" with \\"ghostly magic\\". NME named the album the \\"23rd best album of 2008\\", and it peaked at number126 on the Billboard 200. Johansson started listening to Waits when she was 11 or 12 years old, and said of him, \\"His melodies are so beautiful, his voice is so distinct and I had my own way of doing Tom Waits songs.\\" In September 2009, Johansson and singer-songwriter Pete Yorn released a collaborative album, Break Up, inspired by Serge Gainsbourg's duets with Brigitte Bardot. The album reached number 41 in the US. In 2010, Steel Train released Terrible Thrills Vol.1, which includes their favorite female artists singing songs from their self-titled album. Johansson is the first artist on the album, singing \\"Bullet\\". Johansson sang \\"One Whole Hour\\" for the 2011 soundtrack of the documentary film Wretches & Jabberers (2010). and in 2012 sang on a J.Ralph track entitled \\"Before My Time\\" for the end credits of the climate documentary Chasing Ice (2012) In February 2015, Johansson formed a band called the Singles with Este Haim from HAIM, Holly Miranda, Kendra Morris, and Julia Haltigan. The group's first single was called \\"Candy\\". Johansson was issued a cease and desist order from the lead singer of the Los Angeles-based rock band the Singles, demanding she stop using their name. In 2016, she performed \\"Trust in Me\\" for The Jungle Book soundtrack and \\"Set It All Free\\" and \\"I Don't Wanna\\" for Sing: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack. In 2018, Johansson collaborated with Pete Yorn again for an EP titled Apart, released June 1.  Personal life  alt=An image of Scarlett Johansson posing for the camera with paparazzi in the background. While attending PCS, Johansson dated classmate Jack Antonoff from 2001 to 2002. She dated her Black Dahlia co-star Josh Hartnett for about two years until the end of 2006; Hartnett said they split because their busy schedules kept them apart. Johansson began a relationship with Canadian actor Ryan Reynolds in 2007; they became engaged in May 2008, married in September 2008, separated in December 2010 and divorced in July 2011. In November 2012, Johansson started dating Frenchman Romain Dauriac, the owner of an advertising agency; they became engaged the following September. The couple divided their time between New York City and Paris. In 2014, she gave birth to their daughter, Rose Dorothy Dauriac. Johansson and Dauriac married that October in Philipsburg, Montana. They separated in mid-2016 and divorced in September 2017. It was announced in December 2017 that Johansson had begun a relationship with Saturday Night Live co-head writer and Weekend Update co-host Colin Jost. In May 2019, Johansson and Jost were engaged. Johansson has criticized the media for promoting an image that causes unhealthy diets and eating disorders among women. In one article she wrote for HuffPost, she encouraged people to maintain a healthy body. She appeared nude on the cover of the March 2006 issue of Vanity Fair alongside actress Keira Knightley and fully clothed fashion designer Tom Ford. This caused some controversy, as some believed the photo demonstrated that women are forced to flaunt their sexuality more often than men. In September 2011, nude photographs of Johansson hacked from her cell phone were published online. Following an FBI investigation, the hacker was arrested, pleaded guilty, and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Johansson said the photos had been sent to her then-husband, Reynolds, three years before the incident. In 2014, Johansson won a lawsuit against French publisher JC Lattès for defamatory statements about her relationships in the novel The First Thing We Look At by Grégoire Delacourt. Johansson was awarded $3,400; she had claimed $68,000.  Public image  alt=A blonde woman, wearing a blue dress, smiles away from the camera. Johansson has been called \\"ScarJo\\" by the media and fans, but dislikes the nickname, finding it lazy, flippant and insulting. She is described as a sex symbol by the media. The Sydney Morning Herald describes Johansson as \\"the embodiment of male fantasy\\". During the filming of Match Point, director Woody Allen commented on her attractiveness, calling her \\"beautiful\\" and \\"sexually overwhelming\\". In 2014, The New Yorker film critic Anthony Lane wrote that \\"she is evidently, and profitably, aware of her sultriness, and of how much, down to the last inch, it contributes to the contours of her reputation.\\" Johansson said that she disliked being sexualized, and that a preoccupation with a person's attractiveness does not last. She lost the lead role of Lisbeth Salander in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011), as the film's director, David Fincher, thought she was \\"too sexy\\" for the part. Johansson ranks highly in several beauty listings. Maxim included her in their Hot 100 from 2006 to 2014. She has been named \\"Sexiest Woman Alive\\" twice by Esquire (2006 and 2013), and has been included in similar listings by Playboy (2007), Men's Health (2011), and FHM (since 2005). She was named GQ Babe of the Year in 2010. Madame Tussauds New York museum installed a wax sculpture of her in 2015. Johansson was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in June 2004. In 2006, Johansson appeared on Forbes Celebrity 100, and again in 2014, 2015, 2018 and 2019. Johansson received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in May 2012. In 2014, 2015, and 2016, she was one of the world's highest-paid actresses, with annual earnings of $17million, $35.5million, and $25million, respectively. In 2018, she was named the world's highest paid actress with annual earnings of $40.5million. She was the highest-grossing actor of 2016, with a total of $1.2billion. As a result, IndieWire praised her for taking on risky roles. , her films have grossed over in North America and over worldwide, making Johansson the third-highest-grossing box-office star of all time both domestically and worldwide as well as the highest-grossing actress of all time in North America. Johansson has appeared in advertising campaigns for Calvin Klein, Dolce & Gabbana, L'Oréal, and Louis Vuitton, and has represented the Spanish brand Mango since 2009. Johansson was the first Hollywood celebrity to represent a champagne producer, appearing in advertisements for Moët & Chandon. In January 2014, the Israeli company SodaStream, which makes home-carbonation products, hired Johansson as its first global brand ambassador, a relationship that commenced with a television commercial during Super Bowl XLVIII on February 2, 2014. This created some controversy, as SodaStream at that time operated a plant in Israeli-occupied territory in the West Bank.  Other ventures  Philanthropy = Johansson has supported various charitable organizations, including \\"Aid Still Required, Cancer Research UK, Stand Up To Cancer, Too Many Women\\" (which works against breast cancer), and \\"USA Harvest\\", which provides food for people in need. In 2005, Johansson became a global ambassador for the aid and development agency Oxfam. In 2007, she took part in the anti-poverty campaign ONE, which was organized by U2's lead singer Bono. In March 2008, a UK-based bidder paid £20,000 on an eBay auction to benefit Oxfam, winning a hair and makeup treatment, a pair of tickets, and a chauffeured trip to accompany her on a 20-minute date to the world premiere of He's Just Not That into You. In January 2014, Johansson resigned from her Oxfam position after criticism of her promotion of SodaStream, whose main factory was based in Mishor Adumim, an Israeli settlement in the West Bank; Oxfam opposes all trade with such Israeli settlements. Oxfam stated that it was thankful for her contributions in raising funds to fight poverty. Together with her Avengers costars, Johansson raised $500,000 for the victims of Hurricane Maria. In 2018, she collaborated with 300 women in Hollywood to set up the Time's Up initiative to protect women from harassment and discrimination. She took part in the Women's March in Los Angeles in January 2018 and spoke on topics such as abuses of power, sharing her own experience. Johansson was criticized for calling out James Franco on allegations of sexual misconduct as in the past she had been silent on working with Woody Allen amid accusation by his daughter Dylan Farrow. = Politics = Johansson at the 2017 Women's March Johansson was registered as an independent, at least through 2008, and campaigned for Democratic candidate John Kerry in the 2004 United States presidential election. When George W. Bush was re-elected in 2004, she said she was disappointed. In January 2008, her campaign for Democratic candidate Barack Obama included appearances in Iowa targeted at younger voters, an appearance at Cornell College, and a speaking engagement at Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota, on Super Tuesday, 2008. Johansson appeared in the music video for rapper will.i.am's song, \\"Yes We Can\\" (2008), directed by Jesse Dylan; the song was inspired by Obama's speech after the 2008 New Hampshire primary. In February 2012, Johansson and Anna Wintour hosted a fashion launch of pro-Obama clothing, bags, and accessories, whose proceeds went to the President's re-election campaign. She addressed voters at the Democratic National Convention in September 2012, calling for Obama's re-election and for more engagement from young voters. She encouraged women to vote for Obama and condemned Mitt Romney for his opposition to Planned Parenthood. Johansson publicly endorsed and supported Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer's 2013 run for New York City Comptroller by hosting a series of fundraisers. To encourage people to vote in the 2016 presidential election, in which Johansson endorsed Hillary Clinton, she appeared in a commercial alongside her Marvel Cinematic Universe co-star Robert Downey Jr., and Joss Whedon. In 2017, she spoke at the Women's March on Washington, addressing Donald Trump's presidency and stating that she would support the president if he works for women's rights and stops withdrawing federal funding for Planned Parenthood. In the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries, Johansson endorsed Elizabeth Warren, referring to Warren as \\"thoughtful and progressive but realistic\\".

It is responsible for the safe-keeping, technical maintenance, transportation, delivery, issuance, disposal, etc. of the nuclear arsenal of the state, as well as the testing of nuclear charges, which includes ensuring ecological safety of such tests and the maintenance of Soviet/Russian testing grounds, known in Russian as \\"polygons\\" – in Semipalatinsk (Semipalatinsk Test Site, now Kazakhstan) and on Novaya Zemlya Archipelago. Unlike the GRU (Chief Directorate of Intelligence), the 12th GU MO is not a chief directorate of the General Staff, but a chief directorate of the Ministry of Defense. As such it is not subordinated to the Chief of the General Staff of the Soviet/Russian Armed Forces, but directly to the Minister of Defense, which makes it higher in status compared to the GRU. Position of the Chief of the 12th GU MO is equal to that of the commander of a military district, and supposed to be occupied by a 4-star General or by a Marshal of Artillery. However, in practice, out of seven chiefs of this Organization, only one (E.V. Boichuk) has held such a high rank – the other six were only three-star Generals. Officers Officers, or cadres, for the 12th GU MO are supplied mainly by a special nuclear weapons faculty of the Military College of Rocket Forces(:ru:Военная академия РВСН имени Петра Великого) situated in Serpukhov, near Moscow, and by a special faculty of the Dzerzhinsky Military Academy. The 12th GU MO maintains its own training facility for commissioned officers and for warrant-officers at Sharapovo village, near the city of Sergiev Posad, where commissioned officers possessing other military specialties are educated in nuclear arsenal maintenance skills in 6-month-long courses. Non-essential specialists (those commissioned and non-commissioned officers and soldiers who perform general tasks unrelated to nuclear weapons) could be supplied by other military colleges and academies, but these people can not obtain positions in the 12th GU MO or in either of its subordinated units unless they (as well as their family) could get a special security clearance. In the USSR only members of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union could be appointed to serve in the 12th GU MO or in any of its subordinated units, including its Special Control Service (even young conscripts who served there only two years without actually knowing anything about nuclear weapons must obtain special security clearance and must necessarily be members of the Communist Union of Youth, a.k.a. \\"Komsomol\\"). Structure and tasks Headquarters of the 12th Chief Directorate in Moscow In its main part the 12th GU MO consists of the headquarters, or the \\"directorate of the Chief of the 12 Chief Directorate\\", located in central Moscow – Znamenskiy Pereulok 19, unit number 31600. There was also a central archive, popularly known as \\"the nuclear registrar,\\" where any and every piece of the Soviet or Russian nuclear munitions is registered. Besides, it consists of a network of nuclear arsenal bases both central and \\"dedicated\\" where nuclear warheads/munitions are actually being kept. These bases are called \\"Special-Technical Formations\\", but their whole is called \\"Special Troops of Supreme Command Reserve\\". Each base is typically the size of a regiment, sometimes the size of a brigade, but it is usually commanded by a major-general or sometimes by a rear admiral rather than by a colonel because their importance and elevated status makes them technically equal to that of a regular infantry or other division. Many of commanding officers serving at its Moscow headquarters bear general's and admiral's ranks, since almost all of them are being promoted from among remote arsenal base commanders. That is why percentage of generals and admirals among commissioned officers in the 12th GU MO is considerably higher than in any other military organization of the Russian Army or the Russian Navy. Such nuclear arsenal bases are usually located far enough from big cities (at least 50 kilometres), but close enough to the military units that would use these nuclear warheads in case of war (primarily it is Intercontinental Ballistic Missile batteries, but also missile batteries with shorter range, theatre and tactical missile units, navy and aviation units armed with nuclear weapons, units of military saboteurs and engineers that were supposed to use portable nuclear munitions, anti-aircraft and anti-ballistic missile defences that use nuclear-tipped missiles, etc.). So the main purpose of the 12th Chief Directorate's existence is to securely separate \\"end-users\\" of nuclear weapons from their actual nuclear weapons during times of peace. Only in case of real necessity those who are supposed to have nuclear weapons would get them and it could only happen when authorized by the top political leadership. Presently only some small number of nuclear warheads are always issued to end-users, such as warheads attached to ballistic missiles currently at service, but most of the Russian nuclear arsenal is being securely kept by the 12th Chief Directorate units and could only be issued to others in case of emergency. Moreover, this organization is tasked to collect currently issued nuclear warheads back from their end-users for a reason of replacement or upgrading, and to conduct technical maintenance on nuclear weapons currently issued to end-users at their territories. For this reason each military unit that armed with nuclear warheads currently in service also has some permanently attached representatives of the 12th GU MO nearest arsenal bases whose main duty is to supervise prescribed handling and to conduct required technical maintenance of these issued nuclear warheads. The 12th GU MO nuclear arsenal bases' staff is additionally trained for being able to attach nuclear warheads to their carriers, ballistic and other missiles, to strategic bombers and to other kind of aircraft, a task which usually assigned to special units of end-users. Such additional training is conducted for a reason that 12th GU MO specialists could replace specialists of the end-users in this capacity in case of emergency. Another task of the 12th GU MO is to prevent so-called \\"nuclear terrorism,\\" but this is a relatively modern task, which did not exist formerly. Besides these nuclear arsenal bases, the 12th Chief Directorate maintains several nuclear weapons research institutes in Moscow and in Sergiev Posad, near Moscow, with their subsidiaries located at nuclear testing grounds in Semipalatinsk-21 and on Novaya Zemlya Archipelago, and in several other cities (Saint Petersburg, for example). It also maintains a separate research institute tasked with developing nuclear explosions detection technology. Another function of the 12th GU MO is to serve as a link between the Armed Forces and those branches of Soviet/Russian industry and science related to nuclear weapons developing and manufacturing. It is actually the 12th Chief Directorate that develops detailed plans for required nuclear armament and its improvements and places orders for nuclear weapons production before civilian manufacturers. Secrecy The 12th GU MO is probably the most secretive organization of the Soviet/Russian Armed Forces, even more than the GRU or the Strategic Rocket Forces. Even though today Russia has become more open and even some articles appear in its mass-media openly describing the \\"Nuclear Technical Service\\" Directorate, this organization remains off-limits. However, during Soviet times the most of commissioned officers, even though highly educated ones, had little or no knowledge that the 12th Chief Directorate existed. In the Soviet times it was considered taboo to talk about it outside of secured premises. When talking to strangers, even to other commissioned officers of the Armed Forces, one could only refer to their unit by its coded number. For example, you could say that \\"I serve as a tank platoon commander at the military unit 31600,\\" but nothing more than that. Most of officials of the 12th GU MO headquarters wear gunnery uniforms and bear military ranks typical to artillery, since this organization is considered being primarily an \\"arsenal.\\" However, when it comes to its personnel serving in its remote nuclear arsenal bases, it could wear various military uniforms, ranging from aviation and navy to even tank-crews and marines, because it is a long-time policy of the 12th GU MO to disguise its remote units. All service personnel of the 12th GU MO are explicitly forbidden to reveal to anyone, even to their spouses, that they serve in the Nuclear Technical Service, in the 12th Chief Directorate, or that they have anything to do with nuclear weapons. Moreover, a majority of non-essential staff of nuclear arsenal bases do not know that they actually maintain nuclear weapons. Every unit of this organization has its own cover story based on its location and its currently worn uniform and all its personnel must strictly adhere to this story when dealing with strangers. Some bases also use \\"civilian legends.\\" For example, nuclear arsenal base unit number 62047 in Krasnokamianka, Kizil-Tash, Crimea, was masquerading as a \\"wine-making enterprise\\". Active disinformation measures to this effect are meticulously planned and are regularly conducted not only in order to create a wrong impression among local population and neighbouring military units, but even to misinform conscripts and other unrelated staff serving at actual arsenal bases. For example, tanks and artillery pieces that are maintained as a part of the cover story could be seen by neighbours on daily \\"routine\\" exercises in corresponding bogus \\"tank\\" or \\"artillery\\" regiments. In order to minimize spreading of information about these bases, their commissioned staff was encouraged to serve at one location for as long as possible and not to seek promotions outside their bases (while it was typical for Soviet military in general to move officers every 3–5 years to various places and to promote them exclusively outside of their former military units). Nuclear arsenal base structure Each nuclear arsenal base typically consists of the following main services and units: * Command (that includes the formation’s commander and his deputies, chief engineer, chief of staff, chief of political department with their staff, cadres, financial departments, and other administration). * Engineering-Technical Service or ETS (Russian abbreviation \\"ITS\\") – the most important service of the arsenal that actually handles nuclear weapons and deals with end-users. It is subdivided into several departments, bearing names such as \\"2nd department\\", \\"3rd department\\", \\"3rd A department\\", \\"3rd B department\\", and similar. Each department deals with specific kinds of nuclear munitions and with specific \\"customers.\\" * A separate guards battalion which is similar to an ordinary infantry battalion, but much better trained and equipped. * Automobile transport base. * Rail-way transport base. * Helicopters and related staff. * Tanks and their maintenance base. * Artillery pieces. * Signal office centre and various communication units – stationary and mobile ones – all equipped with various automatic communication encrypting systems. * Separate engineering-technical company (sappers). * Cryptographic (\\"8th\\") department. * Military counter-intelligence department. * Military prosecutor. * Military hospital. * Military fire-fighters command. * School for children. * Detachment of the \\"Voentorg\\" – an organization running various shops and supermarkets within the military and organizing needed supplies. * Various services concerned with living quarters and other premises maintenance. Nuclear arsenal bases functioning and training The main arsenal service, its ETS, and all attached to it transportation and communication detachments, guards, and sappers are subdivided into several so-called Special Tactical Groups (STGs). These were highly mobile units trained to deliver nuclear warheads to designated end-users in various circumstances, including those during ongoing battles and even during unfolding nuclear war. These STGs are mostly based on various automobile transport, but also on rail-way transport, and sometimes, on helicopter transport. Even those auxiliary tanks that are designed to serve as a cover for the arsenal base could be used to reinforce these STGs on their full march. The 12th Chief Directorate maintains its own secure communication system, independent of others, that links its peace-time and war-time headquarters with all its bases and with other subordinated units. Additional local communication systems of each arsenal base securely link its main command post with its multiple mobile STGs. The main communication system of the 12th GU MO has its own unique coded commands that could be used to instantly transmit orders to elevate readiness and to begin loading, delivering, and issuing nuclear warheads and other nuclear munitions to their end-users. Such commands must be transmitted via at least three different communication channels simultaneously to guarantee their delivery. Delivery of such commands must be practiced at least once a day. More extended exercises that include execution of alerts of a \\"higher readiness\\" and \\"combat readiness,\\" with actual loading of warheads into transport and dispatching the STGs towards the end-users, must be conducted at least several times per year. All nuclear arsenal bases are linked by their own railways to the vast Russian railway system (nuclear warheads/munitions are being moved from production plants to the 12th Chief Directorate units and between these units usually by railway). Security Each base is heavily guarded. The guards belong to two independent organizations: some to the FSB, and some to the 12th Chief Directorate itself. This arrangement is made in such a way that guards could not make any sinister agreements among themselves. Moreover, guards from the 12th GU MO are organized into a separate battalion which makes them independent from those dealing with nuclear weapons inside. Each arsenal base is encircled by barbed wire carrying current, by various electronic and laser movement detection devices, by border furrow, and sometimes even by mine fields in between. Guard dogs are also used in some cases. In addition to an outer guarding perimeter there is also an inner guarding perimeter, which encircles the nuclear depot (its \\"technical zone\\"), where only authorized officers could have access. Even when it is needed to bring in some truck to load or to unload, the truck’s driver has to get out and then some authorized officer would replace the driver to drive the truck into the technical zone. The technical zone itself is also separated into several restricted zones of various levels of access in accordance with actual levels of security clearance of staff admitted there. Inside such an inner perimeter all technical premises where nuclear warheads are being kept and maintained, are normally buried deep underground and usually equipped with full anti-atomic protection; for example, typical weight of steel safe-like hermetic doors to the inner premises is over 40 tons. These premises, as well as command posts, could likely survive a thermo-nuclear explosion and the officers there could still be able to deliver their warheads in such conditions. History The 12th Chief Directorate was formerly known as the \\"Special Department of the General Staff\\", and later – as the \\"6th Directorate of the Ministry of Defense\\". It has been created on September 4, 1947, based on \\"KB-11\\" (in Russian: \\"КБ-11\\" - \\"Design Bureau 11\\", also known in Russia as off-limits town \\"Arzamas-16\\", later \\"Sarov\\"); its first chief was Major-General-Engineer (later – full General) Viktor A. Boliatko. The first curator of this organization was Lavrentiy Beria, the then mighty chief of the Soviet NKVD. It is widely believed until today that if not for Beria’s personal efforts, neither the Nuclear Technical Service, nor actual nuclear weapons would ever be created in the Soviet Union. In fact, it was Beria who spearheaded the campaign for creating the USSR's own nuclear weapons program and who contributed to it, including supplying some nuclear technology stolen by his intelligence service from the United States researchers. For this reason, Beria is considered to the god-father of this organization. Even though for the rest of the Soviet Union Beria was declared an \\"enemy of the people\\", relegated to \\"unperson\\" status and excluded from the 30-volumed Great Soviet Encyclopedia, he remains a highly revered figure within the off-limits structure of the 12th GU MO, and especially within its scientific research institutions. Beria’s portraits and statues are still maintained in some premises and flowers are laid to his statures on his birthdays and on some other occasions. Even in the post-Soviet times when the entire communist past was declared criminal, the alleged \\"top of the top communist criminal\\" Lavrentiy Beria continued to enjoy similar reverence among nuclear weapons specialists. For example, the 6-volumes collective work named \\"Nuclear Testing in the USSR\\" published few years after the USSR disappearance still features seditious Beria’s portrait first in this book, before any other photos. The 12th Chief Directorate in its current capacity was formed in February 1959. Three years later the Organization managed to effectively and secretly delivered numerous combat-ready nuclear warheads of six different types to Cuba during an infamous strategic Operation Anadyr, a move that resulted in the most dangerous nuclear stand-off between the United States and the Soviet Union. On the next stage of its development the Nuclear Technical Service was headed by General N.P. Egorov. The next and the most well-known chief was Marshal of Artillery E.V. Boichuk, who held this position from February 1974 until November 1985 and was credited with transforming the organization into the most effective nuclear weapons protection, delivery, and maintenance system. During his command the 12th GU MO lost its initial \\"warehouse image\\" and became a real effective branch of the Soviet Armed Forces, in some respects surpassing by its effectiveness of well-known Soviet special purpose forces such as \\"Spetsnaz\\" and the \\"VDV\\" (Russian Airborne Troops). The last chief of this organization during the Soviet Union was General V.I. Gerasimov. The 12th Chief Directorate was re-created as a part of Russian Armed Forces on September 2, 1993, by a special order No.68 of the Minister of Defense of the Russian Federation. The first post-soviet chief of the 12th GU MO was General E.P. Maslin. In September 1997 he was replaced by General I.N. Valynkin. The current chief (from December 2005) of the 12th Chief Directorate is V.N. Verkhovcev. Special Control Service Medal issued in honor of the 50th Anniversary of the Special Control Service There is a smaller autonomous organization within the main 12th GU MO structure – \\"the Special Control Service of the Defense Ministry,\\" Military Unit Number 46179, \\"atomic intelligence,\\" or \\"nuclear intelligence\\" of the former Soviet Union. The Special Control Service (SSK, Russian: Служба Специального Контрола) is tasked with gathering intelligence on nuclear weapons and particularly on nuclear testing of various adversaries of the former USSR by all means – ranging from six technical control methods to analyzing radio-intercepts and periodicals. The Special Control Service was not a part of the 12th GU MO from very beginning, but was formerly a part of the GRU, its 6th Directorate’s department of special observation. However, it was later detached from the GRU and made an independent Special Observation Service of the Defense Ministry. Then it was renamed into a Special Control Service and re-subordinated first to the Directorate of the Commander of the Chemical Troops (the analogue of a standard ABC service in the Soviet Army), and then again re-subordinated to the 12th GU MO. The Special Control Service has its own network of military units, named \\"detection laboratories\\", each headed by a Colonel, which are situated in many spots inside and outside of the Soviet Union and are all linked to the Service headquarters and to its computation centres by its own secure communication network which is totally independent from the communication network of the 12th GU MO itself. To mark the 60th anniversary of the Special Control Service, in May 2018, the Ministry of Defence released a video recounting the tasks of the service. Apart from nuclear explosion monitoring for the Russian Government itself, the SCS also coordinates activities by the Russian Federal Government and the Academy of Sciences to carry out Russian obligations to implement the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.

He is particularly known for his collaborations with filmmaker Martin Scorsese. He is the recipient of various accolades, including two Academy Awards, a Golden Globe Award, the Cecil B. DeMille Award, and a Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award. In 2009, he received the Kennedy Center Honor and in 2016, he received a Presidential Medal of Freedom from U.S. President Barack Obama. Born in Manhattan in New York City, De Niro studied acting at HB Studio, Stella Adler Conservatory, and Lee Strasberg's Actors Studio. His first major onscreen appearance was in Greetings (1968). He soon gained recognition with his role as a baseball player in the sports drama Bang the Drum Slowly (1973). His first collaboration with Scorsese was in Mean Streets (1973), in which he played the small-time criminal \\"Johnny Boy\\". Stardom followed soon after with his role as the young Vito Corleone in Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather Part II (1974), which won him the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. For his portrayal of Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver (1976), and a soldier in the Vietnam War drama The Deer Hunter (1978), he earned two Academy Award nominations for Best Actor. In 1980, De Niro portrayed Jake LaMotta in Scorsese's biographical drama Raging Bull which won him an Academy Award for Best Actor, his first in this category. He diversified into comic roles, such as by playing a stand-up comedian in The King of Comedy (1982), and gained further recognition for his performances in Sergio Leone's crime epic Once Upon a Time in America (1984), science fiction dystopian satire Brazil (1985), the religious epic The Mission (1986), and the comedy Midnight Run (1988). De Niro entered the 1990s playing gangster Jimmy Conway in the crime film Goodfellas, a catatonic patient in the drama Awakenings (both 1990), and as a criminal in the psychological thriller Cape Fear (1991). All three films received praise for De Niro's performances. He then starred in This Boy's Life (1993), and directed his first feature film with 1993's A Bronx Tale. His other critical successes include the crime films Heat and Casino (both 1995). He played more comic roles in the films Wag the Dog (1997), Analyze This (1999), and Meet the Parents (2000). After appearing in a series of critically panned and commercially unsuccessful films, he earned another Academy Award nomination for his role in David O. Russell's 2012 romantic comedy, Silver Linings Playbook. In 2019, De Niro starred in two acclaimed films; the thriller Joker, and Scorsese's crime epic The Irishman. De Niro and Scorsese have made nine feature films together, and six of De Niro's films have been inducted into the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". In 1989, De Niro and producer Jane Rosenthal co-founded TriBeCa Productions, a film production company, and in 2002, he co-founded the Tribeca Film Festival.  Early life  Robert Anthony De Niro Jr. was born in the Manhattan borough of New York City on August 17, 1943, the only child of painters Virginia Admiral and Robert De Niro Sr. His father was of Irish and Italian descent, while his mother had Dutch, English, French, and German ancestry. His parents, who had met at the painting classes of Hans Hofmann in Provincetown, Massachusetts, separated when he was two years old after his father announced that he was gay. He was raised by his mother in the Greenwich Village and Little Italy neighborhoods of Manhattan. His father lived nearby, and remained close with De Niro during his childhood.Dougan, p. 10. Nicknamed \\"Bobby Milk\\" because of his pale complexion, De Niro befriended a number of street kids in Little Italy, much to the disapproval of his father. Some, however, have remained his lifelong friends.Dougan, p. 17. His mother was raised Presbyterian but became an atheist as an adult, while his father had been a lapsed Catholic since the age of 12. Against his parents' wishes, his grandparents had De Niro secretly baptized into the Catholic Church while he was staying with them during his parents' divorce. De Niro attended PS 41, a public elementary school in Manhattan, through the sixth grade. He began acting classes at the Dramatic Workshop and made his stage debut in school at age 10, playing the Cowardly Lion in The Wizard of Oz.Stated on Inside the Actors Studio, 1998Dougan, p.15. He later went to Elisabeth Irwin High School, the upper school of the Little Red School House, for the seventh and eighth grades.Dougan, pp. 12–13. He was then accepted into the High School of Music and Art for the ninth grade, but only attended for a short time before transferring to a public junior high school: IS 71, Charles Evans Hughes Junior High School.Dougan, pp. 13–14. De Niro attended high school at McBurney School and later, Rhodes Preparatory School.Dougan, pp. 17–18.Baxter, p. 37. He found performing as a way to relieve his shyness, and became fascinated by cinema, so he dropped out of high school at 16 to pursue acting. He later said, \\"When I was around 18, I was looking at a TV show and I said, 'If these actors are making a living at it, and they're not really that good, I can't do any worse than them.'\\" He studied acting at HB Studio and Lee Strasberg's Actors Studio. De Niro also studied with Stella Adler, of the Stella Adler Conservatory, where he was exposed to the techniques of the Stanislavski system.  Career  1963–1973: Early roles and breakthrough = De Niro's had minor film roles in Encounter, Three Rooms in Manhattan (both released in 1965) and Les Jeunes Loups (1968). Shortly afterwards, De Niro landed a major role in Greetings (1968), a satirical film about men avoiding the Vietnam War draft. The film marked the first of a series of early collaborations between De Niro and director Brian De Palma. A year later, De Niro appeared in the drama Sam's Song in which he portrays a New York City filmmaker. Also in 1969, he appeared in De Palma's comedy The Wedding Party; although it was filmed in 1963, it was kept unreleased for six years. De Niro, who was still unknown at the time, gained a favorable review from The New York Times Howard Thompson: \\"This farcical comedy, modestly produced by a trio of young people and utilizing some unfamiliar faces, is great fun\\". He then appeared in Roger Corman's low-budget crime drama Bloody Mama (1970), a loose adaptation of Ma Barker's life, who was the mother of four American criminals, of which De Niro portrayed one: Lloyd Barker. Thompson praised the film and thought the cast gave \\"fine performances\\". Next, De Niro starred in De Palma's comedy Hi, Mom! (1970), a sequel to Greetings. Writing for The New Yorker, Richard Brody opined that De Niro \\"brings unhinged spontaneity\\" to his character. He also had a small role in Jennifer on My Mind (1971) and in Ivan Passer's Born to Win (1971). His last film appearance of 1971 was in The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight, a crime-comedy based on the 1969 novel of the same name by Jimmy Breslin. De Niro at the Venice Film Festival, 1990 In 1972, De Niro starred in two performances at The American Place Theatre, directed by Charles Maryan. He then returned to the big screen with Bang the Drum Slowly (1973), in which he played the lead role as Bruce Pearson, a Major League Baseball player with Hodgkin disease. His co-stars were Michael Moriarty and Vincent Gardenia. Adapted from the 1956 novel of the same name by Mark Harris, the film received critical acclaim and helped De Niro gain further recognition. The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \\"De Niro proves himself to be one of the best and most likable young character actors in movies with this performance\\". Variety magazine's Alex Belth also took note of De Niro's \\"touching\\" portrayal, while Gardenia was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Harris later wrote about De Niro, \\"He learned only as much baseball as he needed for his role [...] I doubt that he ever cared to touch a baseball again\\". In 1973, De Niro began collaborating with Martin Scorsese when he appeared in the crime film Mean Streets (1973), co-starring Harvey Keitel. Although De Niro was offered a choice of roles, Scorsese wanted De Niro to play \\"Johnny Boy\\" Civello, a small time criminal working his way up a local mob. While De Niro and Keitel were given freedom to improvise certain scenes, assistant director Ron Satlof recalls De Niro was \\"extremely serious, extremely involved in his role and preparation\\", and became isolated from the rest of the cast and crew. Mean Streets debuted at the Cannes Film Festival, followed by the New York Film Festival five months later, to a generally warm response. Film critic Roger Ebert thought De Niro gave a \\"marvelous performance, filled with urgency and restless desperation\\". Pauline Kael of The New York Times was equally impressed by De Niro, writing he is \\"a bravura actor, and those who have registered him only as the grinning, tobacco-chewing dolt of that hunk of inept whimsey Bang the Drum Slowly will be unprepared for his volatile performance. De Niro does something like what Dustin Hoffman was doing in Midnight Cowboy, but wilder; this kid doesn’t just act – he takes off into the vapors\\". In 1997, the film was selected for preservation in the U.S. National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". = 1974–1980: Scorsese collaboration and acclaim = De Niro had a pivotal role in Francis Ford Coppola's crime epic The Godfather Part II (1974), playing the young Vito Corleone. De Niro had previously auditioned for the first installment, The Godfather (1972), but quit the project in favor of doing The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight. Coppola, having remembered him, gave De Niro a role in Part II instead. To portray his character, De Niro spoke mainly in several Sicilian dialects, although he delivered a few lines in English. The film was a commercial success and grossed $48 million at the worldwide box office. The Godfather Part II received eleven nominations at the 47th Academy Awards, winning six, including one for De Niro as Best Supporting Actor. It was De Niro's first Academy win; Coppola accepted the award on his behalf as he did not attend the ceremony. De Niro and Marlon Brando, who played the older Vito Corleone in the first film, were the first pair of actors to win Academy Awards for portraying the same fictional character. After working with Scorsese in Mean Streets, De Niro collaborated with him again for the psychological drama Taxi Driver (1976). Set in gritty and morally bankrupt New York City following the Vietnam War, the film tells the story of Travis Bickle, a lonely taxi driver who descends into insanity. In preparation for the role, De Niro spent time with members of a U.S army base to learn their Midwestern accent and mannerisms. He also lost 30 pounds (13 kg) in weight, took firearm training and studied the behavior of taxi drivers. The film was critically acclaimed, in particular for De Niro's performance; The Washington Post critic hailed it as his \\"landmark performance\\", and the San Francisco Chronicle wrote \\"De Niro is dazzling in one of his signature roles\\". Despite controversy for Jodie Foster being cast as a child prostitute, the film was nominated for four Academy Awards, including Best Actor for De Niro. His \\"You talkin' to me?\\" quote, which he improvised, was selected as the 10th most memorable quote in the AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes by the American Film Institute. In 2005, the film was chosen by Time magazine as one of the 100 best films of all time. De Niro and alt= De Niro had two other film releases in 1976. He starred in 1900, a historical drama directed by Bernardo Bertolucci. Starring an ensemble cast, the film is set in the Emilia region of Italy, and tells the story of two men, the landowner Alfredo Berlinghieri (De Niro) and the peasant Olmo Dalcò (Gérard Depardieu), as they witness and participate in the political conflicts between fascism and communism in the first half of the twentieth century. Next, he played a CEO in The Last Tycoon, based on F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel of the same name, as adapted by British screenwriter Harold Pinter. De Niro lost 42 pounds (19 kg) for the role, and director Elia Kazan observed that De Niro would rehearse on Sundays, adding \\"Bobby and I would go over the scenes to be shot. Bobby is more meticulous... he's very imaginative. He's very precise. He figures everything out both inside and outside. He has good emotion. He's a character actor: everything he does he calculates. In a good way, but he calculates\\".Kazan, Elia. Elia Kazan: A Life, Da Capo Press (1997) The film received mixed reviews; Variety magazine critic opined that the film was \\"unfocused\\" and called De Niro's performance \\"mildly intriguing\\". Film critic Marie Brenner wrote, \\"it is a role that surpasses even his brilliant and daring portrayal of Vito Corleone in The Godfather Part II... his performance deserves to be compared with the very finest\\".Brenner, Marie. \\"Tender is the Plight\\", Texas Monthly, January 1977. For De Niro's sole project of 1977, he starred in Scorsese's musical drama New York, New York opposite Liza Minnelli. De Niro learned to play the saxophone from musician Georgie Auld, to portray saxophonist Jimmy, who falls in love with a pop singer (Minnelli). The film received generally mixed reception, although critics were kinder to De Niro. The film was nominated for four Golden Globe awards including Best Actor in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for De Niro. In 1978, De Niro starred in Michael Cimino's epic war film The Deer Hunter, in which he played a steelworker whose life was changed after serving in the Vietnam War. He co-starred with Christopher Walken, John Savage, John Cazale, Meryl Streep, and George Dzundza. The story takes place in Clairton, Pennsylvania, a working-class town on the Monongahela River south of Pittsburgh, and in Vietnam. Producer Michael Deeley pursued De Niro for the role, because the fame of his previous films would help make a \\"gruesome- sounding storyline and a barely known director\\" marketable. De Niro, impressed by the script and director's preparation, was among the first to sign on to the film. Reviews for The Deer Hunter were generally positive, and the cast attracted strong praise for their performances. The film received nominations at the Academy Awards, Golden Globes and British Academy Film Awards (BAFTAs), and earned De Niro a nomination for Best Actor at the Academy Awards. In 2007, the American Film Institute ranked it as the 53rd-greatest American film of all time in their 10th Anniversary Edition of the AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies list. The fourth collaboration between De Niro and Scorsese was in 1980, with the biographical drama Raging Bull. Adapted from Jake LaMotta's memoir Raging Bull: My Story, De Niro portrays LaMotta, the Italian-American middleweight boxer whose violent behavior and temper destroyed his relationship with his wife and family. Co-starring Joe Pesci and Cathy Moriarty, De Niro later said it was one of the toughest roles to prepare for because he had to gain 60 pounds (27 kg), and had to learn to box. \\"The book’s not great literature, but it’s got a lot of heart\\", De Niro told Scorsese at the time. Although the film received critical acclaim, some reviewers were divided and criticized its \\"exceedingly violent\\" content; however, De Niro garnered praise for his realistic portrayal. The critic from The Hollywood Reporter declared that \\"De Niro is incredible and makes the actor almost unrecognizable as himself; he looks amazingly like La Motta. De Niro's appearance is also astonishing in the final scenes\\". Michael Thomson of the BBC observed \\"the power of Scorsese is matched by the intensity of De Niro who delves deep into the soul of the boxer\\". At the 53rd Academy Awards, the film received eight nominations, including Best Actor for De Niro, for which he won. Raging Bull has since been regarded as one of the greatest films of the 1980s by American critics. = 1981–1991: Dramas, comedies and awards success = De Niro and Sergio Leone on the set of Once Upon a Time in America De Niro returned to the crime genre with True Confessions (1981), adapted from the 1977 novel of the same name by John Gregory Dunne. Less challenging than his previous film, De Niro played a priest who clashes with his brother (Robert Duvall), a detective investigating the murder of a prostitute. Vincent Canby of The New York Times thought the plot was hard to follow at times but praised the actors who \\"work so beautifully together it sometimes seems like a single performance\\". To expand his range of acting roles and to prove his acting abilities, De Niro sought out films with a comedic tone throughout the 1980s. He found it in The King of Comedy (1982), in which he played the struggling stand-up comedian Rupert Pupkin. De Niro was first to bring the script to the attention of Scorsese, who then gave it a New York setting and darker tone. The film failed to find an audience, and was a box office disappointment, grossing only $2.5 million from a budget of $19 million. However, most critics praised De Niro's performance. His next film credit was in Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in America (1984), in which he plays David \\"Noodles\\" Aaronson, a New York City Jewish gangster. The theatrical cut, with a runtime of 229 minutes, premiered at the 1984 Cannes Film Festival and received a 15-minute standing ovation. The film was shortened for theaters in the U.S. (139 minutes), but this proved to be highly unpopular with critics. After seeing the full cut, Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times described the film \\"excessive as well as tightly controlled\\" with the actors showing \\"impressive restraint and power\\". Falling in Love, a romantic comedy starring opposite Meryl Streep, was his last release of 1984. One year later, De Niro starred in a science fiction for the first time, Brazil, about a daydreaming man living in a dystopian society. Although the film was unsuccessful at the box office, Brazil was included in The Criterion Collection. In May 1986, De Niro returned to the stage at Longacre Theatre, playing the lead role in the production Cuba and His Teddy Bear. For his next feature film, he co-starred in The Mission (1986) with Jeremy Irons, a period drama about the experiences of a Jesuit missionary in eighteenth century South America. Vincent Canby reviewed the film negatively, and was critical of De Niro's casting: \\"De Niro, who was very fine as the street-wise priest in True Confessions, is all right here until he opens his mouth\\". However, the film won an Academy Award for Best Cinematography, three BAFTAs, including Best Editing, and two Golden Globes for Best Screenplay and Best Original Score. In 1987, De Niro had two minor film roles. In the first, he was cast as Louis Cyphre in Alan Parker's horror Angel Heart, an adaptation of William Hjortsberg's 1978 novel Falling Angel. In the second, he portrayed Al Capone in De Palma's crime drama, The Untouchables. While Pauline Kael opined that De Niro \\"lazy\\" for undertaking small roles, De Palma defended him by saying he was \\"experimenting with those characters\\". In July 1987, he traveled to Russia to serve as President of the Jury at the 15th Moscow International Film Festival. Finally that year, he provided a voice-over for the documentary Dear America: Letters Home from Vietnam. The buddy cop film, Midnight Run, was his next effort in 1988. Starring opposite Charles Grodin, De Niro played bounty hunter Jack Walsh. The film received amicable reception and was a commercial success, grossing $81 million worldwide. In his mixed review, Hal Hinson of The Washington Post wrote of De Niro: > De Niro has reduced himself in scale here, too, and it's a relief to see him > drop the great-actor mantle, and the theatricality. As a result, he hasn't > seemed as fresh since Mean Streets or New York, New York. Walsh is more of a > character role than the ones he played in those films; there's less > specificity in the conception – he's more of a type – but the actor fits > into him snugly, effortlessly, and the chance to play comedy, particularly > opposite a comic foil as ideal as Grodin, appears to have revitalized him. He turned down an opportunity to play Jesus Christ in Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ (1988), although he told the director that he would do it as a favor if needed. Scorsese cast Willem Dafoe instead. In 1989, De Niro starred in several films that were not widely seen. He starred alongside Ed Harris and Kathy Baker in the drama Jacknife. The film revolves around the complex relationship between a Vietnam veteran, his sister and fellow army buddy. Next, he starred in the crime comedy We're No Angels (1989) with Sean Penn, a remake of the 1955 film of the same name. The pair play escaped convicts who go on the run towards Canada. A year later, he starred in the romantic drama Stanley & Iris opposite Jane Fonda. Film critics did not receive We're No Angels or Stanley & Iris positively; modern review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives them approval ratings of 47% and 33%, respectively. De Niro at the alt=De Niro at the 1988 Deauville Film FestivalDe Niro and producer Jane Rosenthal co-founded TriBeCa Productions, a film production company in 1989. De Niro and Scorsese soon reunited for their sixth collaboration in 1990, with the crime film Goodfellas. It is an adaptation of the 1985 non-fiction book Wiseguy by Nicholas Pileggi. The film narrates the life of mob associate Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) and his friends and family from 1955 to 1980. De Niro played James Conway, an Irish truck carjacker and gangster. Goodfellas premiered at the 47th Venice International Film Festival to an \\"enthusiastic\\" response from Italian critics, although it grossed a moderate $46 million upon its wider release. Writing for Rolling Stone magazine, Peter Travers, praised the cast performances, and called De Niro's character \\"a smooth killer acted with riveting restraint\\". Chicago Tribune Gene Siskel was equally impressed by their improvised performances and concluded \\"easily one of the year's best films\\". In the awards season, the film was nominated for six Academy Awards, and De Niro was nominated for Best Actor at the BAFTAs. In 2007, the American Film Institute ranked it as the 92nd-greatest American film of all time in their 10th Anniversary Edition of the AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies list. Also in 1990, De Niro appeared in the lead role for Awakenings, directed by Penny Marshall. The drama, based on Oliver Sacks' 1973 book of the same title, tells the story of Dr. Malcolm Sayer (Robin Williams), who discovers benefits of the drug L-Dopa in 1969 and administers it to catatonic patients. The film was nominated for three Academy Awards, including Best Actor for De Niro. Sacks later remarked of the film: \\"I was pleased with a great deal of it. I think in an uncanny way, De Niro did somehow feel his way into being Parkinsonian. [...] At other levels I think things were sort of sentimentalized and simplified somewhat\\". De Niro's next film project was the drama Guilty by Suspicion (1991) in which he plays David Merrill, a fictitious film director, returning to the U.S. during the McCarthy era and Hollywood blacklist. The film received generally favorable reviews. He then had a minor role in the mystery drama Backdraft (1991), playing a veteran fire inspector. De Niro's biggest success of 1991 was Cape Fear, his seventh film with Scorsese. It is a remake of the 1962 film of the same name, but heavily inspired by the original director, Alfred Hitchcock. De Niro portrays convicted rapist Max Cady, who seeks revenge against a former public defender who originally defended him. To look the part, De Niro spent hours in the gym and consented to the grind down of his teeth which were corrected when filming ended. De Niro's performance was widely lauded. David Ansen of Newsweek remarked that De Niro \\"dominates the film with his lip-smacking, blackly comic and terrifying portrayal of psychopathic self-righteousness\\". The film grossed a successful $182 million and earned De Niro a Best Actor nomination at the 64th Academy Awards. = 1992–1997: Directorial debut and crime dramas = In 1992, De Niro appeared in two films. The first, Mistress, is a comedy-drama in which he played ruthless businessman Evan Wright. Of his performance, the critic from The Independent called De Niro \\"more urbane and coherent than we've seen him for a while\\". Irwin Winkler's Night and the City was his second release, a crime drama remake of the 1950 film noir of the same name. He was cast as New York lawyer Harry Fabian. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a rating of \\"B-\\" and was critical of De Niro: \\"The actor who once got so far inside his roles that he just about detonated the screen – now plays characters who don’t seem to have any inner life at all\\". Next, he served as a producer for the mystery thriller Thunderheart (1992). In 1993, he played crime scene photographer Wayne Dobie in the comedy drama Mad Dog and Glory with co-stars Uma Thurman and Bill Murray. The feature received reasonable reviews and was lauded for the chemistry between De Niro and Murray; The Washington Post critic noted that their \\"real-life friendship spills over into this jittery, very funny look at the male bonding experience\\". Next, De Niro starred in the coming-of-age film This Boy's Life (1993), based on the memoir of the same name by Tobias Wolff. It features Ellen Barkin and Leonardo DiCaprio. Playing stepfather Dwight Hansen of Wolff (DiCaprio), the film was mostly well received, although Timeout magazine believed that \\"DiCaprio steals the show\\". De Niro starred in his directorial debut, A Bronx Tale (1993), a coming-of-age story about an Italian-American boy who is torn between the temptations of organized crime, racism in his community, and the values of his decent father. The film also stars Chazz Palminteri, who wrote the play of the same name, and is based on his childhood. A Bronx Tale premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival to a positive response; Marjorie Baumgarten of The Austin Chronicle wrote \\"De Niro's choices as a director all seem prudent and un-showy, designed to draw attention to the characters and the story rather than its technical assemblage and much-lauded star\\". Variety magazine Todd McCarthy took issue with the film's slow start but complimented De Niro's \\"impressive sensitivity to the irrational roots of racism and violence\\". A year later, De Niro was cast in the lead role of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, an adaptation of Mary Shelley's 1818 novel Frankenstein. Although the film was commercially successful, earning $112 million worldwide, the general consensus of reviews were largely negative. Film critic James Berardinelli opined that it was entertaining and De Niro gave a strong performance, despite the film's \\"frantic\\" pace. Venice Film Festival, 1993alt=De Niro at the 1993 Venice Film Festival Casino (1995) marked De Niro's return to the crime genre with Scorsese in their eighth collaboration. Co-starring Sharon Stone and Joe Pesci, the film is based on the book Casino: Love and Honor in Las Vegas by Nicholas Pileggi. De Niro portrays Sam \\"Ace\\" Rothstein, a mob-connected casino operator in Las Vegas. The film's themes revolve around greed, betrayal, wealth, status, and murder that occur between two mobsters, Sam \\"Ace\\" Rothstein (De Niro) and Nicky Santoro (Pesci), and a trophy wife (Stone) over a gambling empire. Casino was released to mostly positive critical reception, and was a success at the worldwide box office. Roger Ebert was impressed with the lead performers' abilities to \\"inhabit their roles with unconscious assurance\\", and The Globe and Mail's critic thought \\"De Niro does an extraordinarily subtle job of capturing the paradox [...] that lie at the heart of this picture\\". Shortly afterwards, he starred in 1995's crime thriller Heat, about a group of professional bank robbers. Art Linson, who had previously produced films starring De Niro, sent him the script first. \\"It was very good, very strong, had a particular feel to it, a reality and authenticity,\\" De Niro said. Co- starring Al Pacino and Van Kilmer, the film was released to wide acclaim; Michael Wilmington of the Chicago Tribune wrote: > De Niro and Pacino redeem everything. In Heat, they represent a high postwar > tradition for movie actors – the ones inspired by Marlon Brando, John > Cassavetes and James Dean – who aren't afraid of emotion, who run right into > the jaws of a scene to grab it. Like others from their generation – Jack > Nicholson, Gene Hackman, Harvey Keitel – they have a keener slant on > machismo. They easily explore its darker strata. In 1995, De Niro had minor roles in the French comedy One Hundred and One Nights and in the drama Panther. In 1996, De Niro starred in the sports thriller The Fan, based on the novel of the same name by Peter Abrahams. De Niro plays Gil Renard, a baseball fanatic who loses his sanity. His fiftieth film credit was in the crime drama Sleepers (1996), about four boys who become involved with crime, and are sentenced to a detention center where they are abused by guards, and seek vengeance upon release. De Niro plays priest Bobby Carillo, a father figure to the four boys. Afterwards, he appeared in Marvin's Room (1996) as Dr. Wallace Carter, who treats a woman (Meryl Streep) with leukemia. Writing for the British Empire magazine, Bob McCabe opined that \\"Performances are all eminently watchable [...] but the truncated feel robs the film of anything more than perfunctory pleasures\\". Also in 1996, De Niro co-produced the crime-comedy Faithful. The following year, he appeared in James Mangold's Cop Land (1997), a crime-drama co-starring Sylvester Stallone, Harvey Keitel and Ray Liotta. De Niro plays Internal Affairs investigator Lt. Moe Tilden, who explores police corruption in a New Jersey town. The film opened to a generally warm response, although Barbara Shulgasser of San Francisco Examiner criticized De Niro's acting in certain scenes, suggesting Mangold put De Niro in a \\"manufactured situation\\", preventing him from realizing his full potential. De Niro co-starred and co-produced Wag the Dog (1997). The film is a political satire about a biased publicist (De Niro) and a Hollywood producer (Dustin Hoffman) who fabricate a war in Albania to cover up a U.S president's sex scandal. In January 1998, a month after its release, the Clinton–Lewinsky scandal dominated the headlines, which helped the film generate publicity. As a result, Wag the Dog was well-received and made the list of Roger Ebert's ten best films of 1997. De Niro also had a supporting role in Quentin Tarantino's Jackie Brown in that same year. = 1998–2006: Comic roles, thrillers, and slump = De Niro began 1998 with an appearance in Great Expectations, a modern adaptation of Charles Dickens’ 1861 novel of the same name, in which he played Arthur Lustig. Later that year, his next major role came in Ronin (1998), about a team of former special operatives that are hired to steal a mysterious briefcase while navigating a maze of shifting loyalties. De Niro plays Sam, an American mercenary formerly associated with the CIA. Ronin premiered at the 1998 Venice Film Festival to favorable response; Janet Maslin of The New York Times praised De Niro's confident portrayal as an action hero. In 1999, De Niro ventured back into crime-comedy; he was cast as an insecure mob boss opposite Billy Crystal and Lisa Kudrow in Harold Ramis' Analyze This. The film was a box office hit, earning $176 million worldwide and De Niro was nominated for Best Actor at the Golden Globes. In Flawless (1999), De Niro appeared as a homophobic police officer, who suffers a stroke, and is assigned to a rehabilitative program with a gay singer. The critic from the BBC gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, and thought De Niro gave a \\"refreshingly low-key\\" performance, in comparison to his previous work. In 2000, De Niro produced and starred in his first live-action animation comedy, The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle. He voiced the character Fearless Leader, who is a dictator and employer of two mobsters. The film was critically panned, with Rotten Tomatoes giving the film a 43% approval rating. De Niro played Master Chief 'Billy' Sunday in the biographical drama Men of Honor (2000), based on the life of Carl Brashear, the first African-American to become a U.S. Navy Master Diver. Although the film garnered mixed reviews, Bob Thomas of the Associated Press wrote \\"De Niro infuses the role with all his dynamism. It is his best performance in years\\". That same year, he starred in the comedy Meet the Parents opposite Ben Stiller as Jack Byrnes, a former CIA operative who takes a dislike to Stiller's character. De Niro, who had been seeking comic roles at the time, was encouraged by his producing partner Jane Rosenthal, to take on the role. The film was a high earner at the box office, with $330 million in receipts. Film critics welcomed De Niro's transition as a comic actor and ability to make audiences laugh. De Niro at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival, 2008 After several comedies, De Niro landed a lead role in the crime thriller 15 Minutes (2001), a story about a homicide detective (De Niro) and a fire marshal (Edward Burns) who join forces to apprehend a pair of Eastern European murderers. The film's reception was generally unfavorable; William Arnold of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer took issue with the \\"in-your-face exaggeration\\", but he thought De Niro delivered \\"his usual edgy flair, [...] on the mean streets of his native Manhattan\\". De Niro followed up with a heist, in Frank Oz's The Score (2001), starring Edward Norton, Angela Bassett and Marlon Brando. He plays a retiring thief when a young man (Norton) persuades him into doing one last heist together. Upon release, The Score fared well with critics, although Peter Rainer of New York magazine did not think the film challenged De Niro or fully utilize his talents. The next year, he played an LAPD detective opposite Eddie Murphy in the action-comedy Showtime. The reviewer from LA Weekly remarked \\"De Niro isn't actually playing a part but riffing on his own legend\\", and thought the references to Taxi Driver were \\"cheap\\". Also in 2002, he collaborated with Michael Caton-Jones in City by the Sea, who had previously directed De Niro in This Boy's Life. Starring opposite Frances McDormand and James Franco, he portrayed another police detective in the drama. The film received mixed reviews and under-performed at the theaters. He appeared in Analyze That (2002), a sequel to 1999's Analyze This. Filming began in New York City, seven months after the September 11 attacks. De Niro insisted on filming there, stating \\"It's a New York story, a New York movie. We always intended to keep it there and I'm glad we were able to do it\\". Upon release, most critics thought the sequel was weak; CNN's Paul Clinton remarked \\"Unfortunately the result is just a bunch of one-liners strung together, of which some work and some don't. The actual story never gets off the ground\\". Despite these failures, De Niro served as a producer for the critically acclaimed romantic- comedy About a Boy (2002), and appeared in 9/11 (2002), a CBS documentary about the September 11 attacks, told from the New York City fire department's point of view. Several critics consider De Niro's career as having begun to slump in the early 2000s, with De Niro starring in roles that were less dramatic than those in the previous decade. He returned to the screen in 2004, playing a doctor in the fantasy drama Godsend. As of 2020, the film is De Niro's poorest-performing work; Rotten Tomatoes gave the film an approval rating of 4% based on 139 critic reviews. He voiced a character in DreamWorks' animation of Shark Tale (2004). Most critics were also unimpressed, but it was a high earner at the box office. After co-producing Stage Beauty (2004), De Niro reprised his role of Jack Byrnes in 2004's Meet the Fockers, the sequel to Meet the Parents. In a scathing review of De Niro, the critic from Slant Magazine wrote \\"In self-parody mode for the umpteenth time, De Niro mugs for the camera with a series of overblown grimaces and faux-menacing glares\\". The Bridge of San Luis Rey, was De Niro's last release of 2004, based on Thornton Wilder's novel of the same name. It was also critically panned. In 2005, De Niro starred in the horror Hide and Seek opposite Dakota Fanning, playing Dr. David Callaway who leaves the city with his traumatized daughter after the mother's suicide. Although the film was a financial success, some critics thought De Niro had been miscast, and queried his decision to star in a mediocre feature. In 2006, De Niro turned down a role in The Departed to direct his second film, the spy thriller The Good Shepherd, a fictional account about the growth of the CIA during its formative years. The film reunited him onscreen with Joe Pesci, co-star from Raging Bull, Goodfellas, A Bronx Tale, Casino, among others. Based on the screenplay by Eric Roth, the project was personal for De Niro, who was raised during the Cold War and fascinated by it. Despite starring some of Hollywood's leading actors; Matt Damon, Angelina Jolie and Alec Baldwin, the film garnered a mixed reception. Writing for The Sydney Morning Herald, Sandra Hall noted its slow pace, stating \\"There's a potentially fascinating slice of American history here, but De Niro has carved it up with an excruciatingly dull knife\\". The critic from USA Today found the plot initially hard to follow, but praises De Niro for \\"creating a stirring personal tale\\". The Good Shepherd was nominated for Best Art Direction at the 79th Academy Awards. Finally in 2006, he voiced the character Emperor Sifrat XVI in Arthur and the Invisibles. = 2007–2016: Further film roles = His sole project in 2007 was Matthew Vaughn's Stardust, a fantasy adventure, based on Neil Gaiman's 1999 novel of the same name. He plays Captain Shakespeare, the leader of a ship. The film was generally well received, although one critic from New York magazine thought De Niro's performance was \\"god-awful – yet his gung-ho spirit wins him Brownie points\\". The following year, he starred in the police procedural thriller Righteous Kill opposite Al Pacino, both playing New York City detectives who investigate serial executions of criminals who escaped justice. The film's response was mainly disappointing; Peter Hartlaub of San Francisco Chronicle thought the story was unoriginal and De Niro lacked energy. The film grossed $78 million from a budget of $60 million. Next, he starred in What Just Happened (2008), a satirical comedy based on Art Linson's experiences as a producer in Hollywood. The film was screened at the 2008 Canne Film Festival as an out-of-competition entry. The Sydney Morning Herald opined that most reviewers gave the film a lukewarm reception because of the character he plays, which is \\"sympathetic\\" and quieter than his earlier roles. In 2009, he was cast as Frank Goode in the drama Everybody's Fine, a remake of Giuseppe Tornatore's Italian film of the same name. Although the film's response was equally mixed, The Guardian critic praised De Niro for a \\"decent, watchable performance in a while\\". alt=De Niro at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival In 2010, he had a minor part as Senator John McLaughlin in the action film Machete. That same year, he starred in Stone opposite Milla Jovovich and Edward Norton, co-star from The Score. It is a crime drama where De Niro plays a manipulated parole officer. The film was met with a divided reception; Toronto Star critic thought De Niro delivered a respectable performance due to Jovovich's support. Another critic, Jesse Cataldo from Slant Magazine noted the film's restraint and thought De Niro is repeating himself by playing the same basic characters. Next he starred in Little Fockers (2010), the third sequel to Meet the Parents and Meet the Fockers. Despite universally negative reviews from critics, the film was a box office success, grossing over $310 million worldwide.

In 2011, De Niro starred in the Italian comedy Manuale d'amore 3. He also appeared in three other films: Killer Elite, Limitless, and New Year's Eve.

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest added, \\"There is no arguing that the individuals who will be honored today are richly deserving,\\" he said. A number of De Niro's films have become classics of American cinema, with six of his films inducted into the U.S. National Film Registry as of 2020. Five of his films are featured on the American Film Institute's list of the 100 greatest American films of all time. De Niro and James Stewart share the title for the most films represented on the AFI list. Timeout magazine's list of 100 best movies included seven of De Niro's films, as chosen by actors in the industry. In 2006, De Niro donated his collection of film-related materials, such as scripts, wardrobe pieces and props, to the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin. The collection, which took more than two years to process and catalog, opened to the public in 2009. Fan song In 1984, the English girl group Bananarama's fan song Robert De Niro's Waiting... reached the third place of the UK Singles Chart, remaining on the charts for 12 weeks. Honors  Business interests  In 1989, De Niro and partner Jane Rosenthal co-founded the film production company TriBeCa Productions, which also organizes the Tribeca Film Festival. De Niro owns Tribeca Grill (co-owned with Broadway producer Stewart F. Lane), a New American restaurant located at 375 Greenwich Street (at Franklin Street) in Tribeca, Manhattan. It opened in 1990. He is also the owner of the Greenwich Hotel in Tribeca. De Niro co-owns Nobu restaurants and hotels with partners Meir Teper and Chef Nobu Matsuhisa. The first Nobu Hotel opened inside Caesars Palace, Las Vegas, in 2013. Two years later, the second Nobu Hotel opened at City of Dreams in Manila, Philippines. In 2015, De Niro partnered with James Packer after the billionaire acquired a 20 percent stake in Nobu for $100 million. He is a stakeholder in Paradise Found Nobu Resort, a company planning to build a luxury resort on the island of Barbuda.  Politics  De Niro with 196x196px In 1998, De Niro lobbied U.S. Congress against impeaching President Bill Clinton. While promoting the film The Good Shepherd in December 2006, De Niro appeared on the show Hardball with Chris Matthews, where he voiced support for two Democrats. \\"Well, I think of two people: Hillary Clinton and Obama\\". On February 4, 2008, De Niro supported Barack Obama at a rally at the Izod Center in New Jersey before Super Tuesday. De Niro is an outspoken critic of President Donald Trump. During the 2016 U.S. presidential election, De Niro called Trump \\"blatantly stupid\\" and said, \\"He wants to punch people in the face?! I'd like to punch him in the face.\\" This was in reference to the similar desire Trump expressed towards protesters at one of his rallies. On June 10, 2018, while introducing Bruce Springsteen to the stage at the 72nd Tony Awards, De Niro denounced Trump by saying, \\"I'm gonna say one thing. Fuck Trump. It's no longer 'down with Trump'. It's 'fuck Trump'.\\" De Niro opined that Trump is a racist, and admits that he was \\"naive\\" about Obama's presidency and race relations in America: \\"I felt we were on a new thing. I didn't realize how against him certain people were – racially against him, offended that he was there.\\" Robert De Niro: ‘Trump is a real racist, a white supremacist’ The Guardian. January 6, 2019. In December 2019, De Niro clarified his views again on Trump and his family in an interview with The New York Times: \\"He is a person who, to me, has no morals, no ethics, no sense of right and wrong, is a dirty player. He has not one speck of redeemability in him. The president is supposed to set an example of trying to do the right thing. [...] There's not one thing that I see in him or his family, not any redeeming qualities. They're out on the take. It's like a gangster family.\\" In 2020, he defended himself by saying, \\"As a citizen, I have as much right as anybody – an actor, an athlete, a musician, anybody else – to voice my opinion, if I have a bigger voice because of my situation, I am going to use it whenever I see a blatant abuse of power.\\" De Niro endorsed Democrat Pete Buttigieg in the 2020 U.S presidential election, and then switched to Joe Biden after Buttigieg dropped out of the race.  Personal life  De Niro at the 191x191px De Niro married actress Diahnne Abbott in 1976. They have a son, Raphael, a former actor who works in New York real estate. De Niro also adopted Abbott's daughter Drena De Niro from a previous relationship. He and Abbott divorced in 1988. Afterwards, he was in a relationship with model Toukie Smith between 1988 and 1996. De Niro has twin sons, Julian and Aaron, conceived by in vitro fertilization and delivered by a surrogate mother in 1995. In 1997, De Niro married actress Grace Hightower. Their son, Elliot, was born in 1998 and the couple split in 1999. The divorce was never finalized and in 2004 they renewed their vows. In December 2011, their daughter was born via surrogate. In 2014, he and Hightower moved into a 6,000-square-foot, five- bedroom apartment at 15 Central Park West. Four years later, it was reported De Niro and Hightower had separated after 20 years of marriage. De Niro has four grandchildren; his daughter Drena, has one, and his son Raphael, has three. De Niro is long-term resident of New York City, and has been investing in Manhattan's Tribeca neighborhood since 1989. He has properties on the east and west sides of Manhattan. He also has a estate in Gardiner, New York, which serves as his primary residence. In October 2003, De Niro was diagnosed with prostate cancer. He underwent surgery at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in December 2003. In 2006, De Niro received Italian citizenship, despite opposition by the Sons of Italy, who believe that De Niro damaged the public image of Italians by portraying criminals. In 2016, De Niro initially defended the inclusion of a controversial documentary, Vaxxed, at the 2016 Tribeca Film Festival. He explained that his interest in the film was from his personal experience with his autistic son, Elliot. The film was withdrawn from the schedule after consultation with the festival organizers and scientific community\\". In February 2017, De Niro took part in a joint presentation with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., chairman of the anti-vaccine non-profit Children's Health Defense, to discuss their concerns with vaccine safety. De Niro has stated that he is not anti-vaccination, but does question their efficacy. In 2012, De Niro joined the anti-fracking campaign Artists Against Fracking.  Legal issues  alt=De Niro at a film premiere in 2008 In February 1998, De Niro was held for questioning by French police in connection with an international prostitution ring. De Niro denied any involvement, and later filed a complaint against the examining magistrate for \\"violation of secrecy in an investigation\\". He stated he would not return to France, but has since traveled there several times including for the 2011 Cannes Film Festival. In 2006, the trust that owns De Niro's Gardiner estate sued the town to have its property tax assessment reduced, arguing that $6 million was too high and should be compared only with similar properties in Ulster County, where Gardiner is located. The town, which had been comparing its value to similar estates in Dutchess County, across the Hudson River, and Connecticut's Litchfield County, where many other affluent New York residents maintain estates on large properties, won in State Supreme Court. In 2014, the trust's lawyers appealed the decision and the town was unsure if it should continue to defend the suit because of financial limitations (it would have earned far less in payments on the increased taxes than it had spent on legal costs). This angered many residents, who initially sympathized with De Niro, and some proposed to raise money privately to help the town continue the suit. The dispute was publicized by The New York Times. \\"When he [De Niro] read about it on Election Day, he went bananas,\\" due to the negative publicity, said Gardiner town councilman Warren Wiegand. He was unaware that a lawsuit was filed; the trust's accountants took responsibility citing fiduciary duty. Shortly afterwards, De Niro directed his lawyer, Tom Harvey, to withdraw the suit and reimburse the town's legal bills of $129,000. Harvey conveyed to Wiegand that \\"De Niro didn't want to screw the town\\". In August 2019, De Niro's company Canal Productions filed a $6 million lawsuit against former employee Graham Chase Robinson, for breaching her fiduciary duties and violating New York's faithless servant doctrine by misusing company funds and watching hours of Netflix during work hours. In October 2019, Robinson filed a lawsuit against De Niro, claiming harassment and gender discrimination.

It is one of the old temples in the city dating back to the Chola period, it is dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva. Major additions or modifications were made during the late Vijayanagara Empire period under the rule of Hiriya Kempe Gowda II.Michell (1995), p. 69 Legend In the \\"Gazetter of Mysore\\" (1887), Benjamin Lewis Rice describes a legend behind the consecration of the temple. Kempe Gowda, while on a hunt, rode far away from his capital Yalahanka. Being tired, he rested under a tree and fell asleep. The local deity Someshwara appeared to him in a dream and instructed him to build a temple in his honor using buried treasure. In return the chieftain would receive divine favor. Kempe Gowda found the treasure and dutifully completed the temple.B.L.Rice, p72 \\"Halasur\\" According to another version of the legend, King Jayappa Gowda (1420-1450 CE) from a minor dynasty of the Yelahanka Nada Prabhus was hunting in a forest near the present Halasuru area, when he felt tired and relaxed under a tree. In a dream, a man appeared before him and told him that a linga (universal symbol of the god Shiva) was buried under the spot where he was sleeping. He was instructed to retrieve it and build a temple. Jayappa found the treasure and initially built the temple out of wood. Another account attributes the temple to the Chola Dynasty with later renovations made by the Yelahanka Nada Prabhus. Temple plan According to Michell, the temple plan follows many of the basic elements of Vijayanagara architecture though at a lower scale. The temple has a square sanctum (garbhagriha) which is surrounded by a narrow passageway. The sanctum is connected to a closed mantapa (hall) whose walls are decorated with pilasters and sculptures in frieze. The closed mantapa is connected to a spacious open mantapa consisting of four large projecting \\"bays\\" (area between four pillars). The piers leading to the sanctum and those facing outward from the open mantapa are the standard Yali (mythical beast) pillars. The eastern gopuram is a well executed, typical 16th century structure. There are several notable sculptures and decorative features in the complex. An impressive pillar (kambha or nandi) pillar) stands near the tall tower over the entrance gate (gopura). The tower itself exhibits well sculptured images of gods and goddesses from Hindu mythology. The open mantapa consists of forty eight pillars with carvings of divinities in frieze. To the north is the navagraha temple (shrine for the nine planets) with twelve pillars, each pillar representing a saint (rishi). The entrance to the sanctum exhibits sculptures of two \\"door keepers\\" (dvarapalakas). Other notable works of art include sculptures that depict King Ravana lifting Mount Kailash in a bid to appease the god Shiva, Durga slaying Mahishasura (a demon), images of the Nayanmar saints (Tamil Shaivaite saints), depictions of the Girija Kalyana (marriage of Parvati to the god Shiva), the saptarishis (seven sages of Hindu lore). Recent excavations at the temple site has revealed the existence of a temple tank (kalyani) which could be 1200 years old.

The house comprises a compact central Palladian mansion house, with substantial east and west pavilions. The house was built by George Moncrieff in 1772. Moncrieff also founded the small town of Blackburn, for which the House still provides a gateway landmark. The rural setting became transformed by coal and oil-shale mining, with miners' rows built in the adjacent villages. Most of the dereliction has since been cleared, although the conspicuous Five Sisters shale spoil tip survives, as a scheduled monument, still dominating the outlook south from the house. The decay of Blackburn House stemmed from it becoming the farmhouse to a small farm, now no longer viable. The owners were unable to maintain the house, which was abandoned in 1972 for a new bungalow. Blackburn House thus fell into a state of serious disrepair, and was included in the Buildings at Risk Register for Scotland at its inception in 1990. The house could not be sold for private restoration as it stood amidst the working farm buildings. West Lothian Council's newly- established Lowland Crofting schemehttps://www.westlothian.gov.uk/media/2474/SPG-The-lowland-crofting- handbook/pdf/Lowland_crofting_handbook_09.pdf provided a solution, with permission for ten new houses granted on condition the house was released, and a third of the farmland put into woods walks and wildlife for community benefit, reducing the farm itself to a smallholding. Restoration was completed in 2008. Blackburn House won the Georgian Group Award in November 2008 for the Best Restoration of a Georgian Country House in the UK.

(short for Higher Institute of Villainous Education) is a series of young adult fiction novels by Mark Walden. Plot overview H.I.V.E., the Higher Institute of Villainous Education, is a top secret school hidden inside a still active volcano. The school is a part of G.L.O.V.E., the Global League of Villainous Enterprises, and was built for the purpose of training children to become criminal masterminds. Only children who have already been seen to have some villainous skill are accepted to the school. The school has four streams; the Alpha stream, Henchmen stream, Technical stream and the Political/Financial stream. Each stream is associated with a color, and their uniforms reflect this. Alphas have black, Henchman has blue, Technical is white and Political/Financial is grey. Otto Malpense is a thirteen-year-old criminal genius, who has been handpicked along with others-the most intelligent, most athletic, technologically advanced children in the world to be part of H.I.V.E. In the first book Otto has entered the school; he discovers that it is not all what it seems, and sets out to unfold the mystery behind the school and its organization. Otto and his friends, Wing, Shelby, and Laura try to defy the headmaster, Dr. Maximilian Nero and try to accomplish something no one has ever succeeded in: escaping H.I.V.E. alive. H.I.V.E.

Jack Heath, author of Money Run, said that \\"if you can suspend your disbelief far enough, you will find it a rewarding read... The dialogue is witty, the plot twists deft, and the setting inventive, with plenty of knowing nods to the comic books and Bond films which pioneered the super villain tropes.\\" The first book was given a score of 4/5 on abc.net.au, where it was praised as having \\"adventure, sacrifice, mystery, surprises and evil doings.\\"http://www.abc.net.au/rollercoaster/therap/reviews/s1790097.htm SummariesHigher Institute of Villainous Education= After realising that the government funding that keeps the orphanage from closing down is being cut, Otto Malpense creates a remotely controlled device that is able to hack into the teleprompter and cause it to hypnotize whoever looks into it. He creates the device with the intent to publicly embarrass the Prime Minister during one of his speeches. After successfully completing his objective, he is ambushed and stunned by Raven (an assassin that works for H.I.V.E) and then awakes to find himself in a helicopter, strapped to his seat, and sitting across from a complete stranger. He finds out the stranger is named Wing Fanchu and they quickly become close friends. When the helicopter lands, Otto is informed that he will be spending the next six years of his life being schooled at H.I.V.E., the Higher Institute of Villainous Education. Dr. Nero, H.I.V.E's headmaster, is interested to know that it took more than two shots from Sleepers (knock-out weapons designed to replace tranquilizer darts) to capture Wing, enough to send a normal boy in a coma for a few weeks. He expresses his concerns to Raven and asks her to keep a close eye on Wing and Otto. Meanwhile, Otto's special skills have marked him out as an Alpha — a leader of tomorrow. He quickly works out that his little stunt with the Prime Minister now have landed Otto at H.I.V.E though he has no intention of staying in this new prison, and be friends many others who have been taken to H.I.V.E., like Laura Brand, Shelby Trinity, Nigel Darkdoom, and Franz Argentblum. Otto teams up with Wing, Laura, and Shelby, and together they hatch a daring escape plan. They travel through the hidden parts of the school, but as they nearly reach their freedom, their headmaster, Dr. Nero, reveals that all along they have been going on an impossible mission. However, Nigel Darkdoom has managed to stir up his own trouble on this night, and an enormous, flesh-eating plant (named Violet) he has accidentally bred escapes from the hydroponics lab. Everyone, including the students, jump into action to save the school, and they succeed (despite Dr. Nero and many others being injured). Otto and Wing are suddenly given a small window of opportunity to leave the school forever, but at the last second, they decide to stay. In the last chapter, it is revealed to the readers that Number One, Dr. Nero's boss and leader of G.L.O.V.E., in essence, has plans for Otto Malpense. Soon they will meet, and it will not be pretty. =The Overlord Protocol= When Wing receives news of his father's death, he selects Otto to accompany him, under Raven's supervision, to the funeral. However, before they can attend the funeral, the trio is attacked by mysterious assassins. Wing appears to be shot by Cypher, a mysterious member of G.L.O.V.E. who wants to seize power and close H.I.V.E. Otto and Raven barely escape with their lives, and hide in one of Raven's numerous, personal safe houses while awaiting instructions from Dr. Nero. Raven is to attempt to discover what Cypher is up to, with Otto at her side. They discover the unbeatable adversaries they battled with at the original safe house to be robots, engineered for combat. Cypher makes an attack on the school, threatening to kill the students of H.I.V.E to get what he wants. In a sudden turn of events, Wing is found alive, having been shot by a tranquilizer disguised as a lethal bullet, and joins his friends in their attempt to save the school. Ultimately, they win the battle, leaving Cypher injured, but not fatally, and Nero insists that he be dead to everyone but himself and the doctor who treated the patient. Otto and his friends find out that Cypher is Wing's father, explaining his kidnapping Wing. In addition, during Dr. Nero's interrogation, Cypher reveals that his motive for attacking the school was a project named the Renaissance Initiative. This project seeks to recreate Overlord, a homicidal AI that wishes to kill everything on the planet. Cypher believed that with the Overlord Protocol (A device allowing him to hack everything on the planet), and H.I.V.E. as hostage, he could attack the Renaissance Initiative, revealed to be led by no other than Number One. Otto and his friends find themselves glad to be out of danger and home for good, as well as excited that H.I.V.E.mind has had his personality functions restored. =Escape Velocity= Nero is kidnapped by H.O.P.E, the Hostile Operative Prosecution Executive, a new anti-terrorist organisation; and the Contessa takes over H.I.V.E. as headmistress with an elite guard known as the Phalanx. Otto, Wing, Laura, Shelby and Raven are forced to escape the school after being extracted by Raven and join forces with Diabolus Darkdoom - Nigel's supposedly traitorous dead father - who takes charge from a massive submarine known as the Megalodon. However, it soon emerges that Overlord, inside Number One's body, is behind the entire plot. Otto is Number One's clone, designed as a perfect host body for Overlord. They assault H.O.P.E in order to reclaim Nero, but are captured and sent into space, to Number One's hideout. Otto only narrowly escapes being taken over by Number One/Overlord, and is forced to delete H.I.V.E.mind in the process. Meanwhile, H.I.V.E. is under attack by the executioners known as the Reapers, the fights ensue as the teachers are shut out of H.I.V.E's systems, finally when all hope is lost the Contessa sacrifices herself to save the school by setting off a massive puddle of jet fuel. =Dreadnought= The arrival of new student Lucy Dexter causes some confusion among the students, although they quickly befriend her. On their way to a training mission, they briefly visit the Dreadnought, a new mobile command center for G.L.O.V.E. However, the mission is cancelled when the Dreadnought becomes attacked by a rogue G.L.O.V.E. member. Nero, Raven and the students narrowly escape, but Diabolus Darkdoom is left behind and enemy agents that are sent after them. They soon discover that Lucy Dexter is actually the Contessa's Granddaughter and can control people with her voice, which is useful for the adventures they go on. They attempt to rescue Diabolus and foil the plan to use American weaponry, controlled by Air Force One, to set off a super-volcano and destroy civilization. While they succeed in rescuing Darkdoom, Otto must stay behind on an out-of-control Air Force One to disarm the weapon, and he passes out after being in a plane crash, leaving him in the custody of the U.S. Government. Trent speaks to the president then injects the Animus Fluid into Otto. =Rogue= Otto has been infected by Animus, an organic supercomputer which can be programmed by H.O.P.E. to make Otto do their evil bidding. With a superhuman dangerous assassin called Ghost, he attacks members of G.L.O.V.E. Raven is on her own mission to find Sebastian Trent, but first, goes to a facility where there might be people with information. She gets to Khan and threatens him, so he starts to unlock his computer. As he is typing in his password, he is killed by a remote-controlled microexplosive device in his skull. She takes the laptop and just then, Nero picks her up to take her to the G.L.O.V.E. council meeting. At that meeting with the remaining G.L.O.V.E. members, who are waiting for Darkdoom to slip up, Darkdoom is pressured to make a decision. Eventually, Darkdoom issues a capture or kill order for Otto. During a later private meeting with Nero, Raven sees a sniper (Ghost) and just barely saves Darkdoom from being assassinated. While Darkdoom is in the H.I.V.E. medical center being healed, Professor Pike and Laura Brand try to fix the school's sporadic technical problems. Raven tries to hack through the Khan's laptop with Professor Pike's help, and she finds a picture of a seed in one picture. After consulting the biotechnology teacher, she discovers that this seed is most commonly found in the Amazon, which is where she is headed. Wing, who desperately wants to find Otto, stows away with her on the Shroud, but the pair of them are captured by H.O.P.E. Meanwhile, amidst the chaos at H.I.V.E., Nero brings another expert on artificial intelligence—a newly freed Cypher, to help investigate. They believe it to be Overlord, but it is actually H.I.V.E.mind rebuilding himself. Organic supercomputers always automatically repair themselves as seed programs, and when they reach the self-awareness stage, they are able to control Raven's original purpose for going to the Amazon was also to seek the help of an old friend, who is shown to betray her. Carlos Chavez was essentially the ruler of Brazil and had pinpointed Raven's arrival. Chavez had enlisted a commander named Rafael, but Raven and Wing together defeat Rafael's men and Raven finishes Rafael by slicing his throat. After the mission failure, Chavez, knowingly defying Nero's wishes, even more, puts a priority one notice on the GLOVE.net for \\"Operation Raven,\\" which was to kill Raven. Lin Feng had supported Chavez's assassination attempt to kill Raven in order to prevent Nero from gaining power because Lin Feng knew Chavez was too unruly to actually control the council well, and that Lin Feng himself would take over G.L.O.V.E. eventually. Cypher takes advantage of his freedom to seek out Wing at H.O.P.E.'s base, accompanied by Laura, Shelby, and Lucy as hostages that he took when he escaped. The girls escape him and free Raven, and when Otto begins to resist Animus (when he was told to kill Wing), Wing escapes to join them. When Otto distracts Ghost, Raven slices Ghost's head off, but Cypher finds the group and attempts to kill Otto in order to protect the world from Overlord. Cypher is shot dead by Wing, and Otto is nearly taken over by Overlord, but Laura uses the neural pulse device to eject Overlord and Animus from his system, nearly killing Otto in the process. Sebastian Trent attacks them, but he is taken over by Animus and subsequently killed, and Raven shoots him. The students return to H.I.V.E., where Otto recovers and tells Nero about some new information: Animus sought to destroy any organic material, but somehow with the Overlord, not H.I.V.E.mind (as Otto had once hoped), seed growing in him, the two fused together to become extremely powerful; every time Otto tried to hold them back, he himself weakened. Because Darkdoom believes that his old idea of just ruling with respect wasn't good enough and that his injuries need more time to recover, he suggested Nero take over G.L.O.V.E. and add the touch of fear that Number One had. During their virtual meeting, with only 9 members, including Nero, remaining, G.L.O.V.E. was in peril. Nero proposes himself as the leader, but Lin Feng strongly opposes. With no other ally, because Raven killed Chavez, Lin Feng angrily leaves the council. It is shown later that Lin Feng is actually part of The Disciples, as he is talking to Pietor Furan about what had happened. Furan orders Lin Feng to apologize to Nero and regain his seat in G.L.O.V.E. Furan then tells Dr. Creed, whom he saved from the rainforest, to conduct an autopsy on Trent, who has been dead for 2 weeks. It is believed that the Animus would be inert, but it surprisingly lurches out and consumes Dr. Creed. The book is closed with a cliffhanger as the Overlord-Animus combination manages to survive in the doctor. =Zero Hour= Overlord has developed the power to move from body to body, if the body has been exposed to Animus. New machines have been developed but the first glimpse to the public brings terror as Overlord takes control of the facility (an Advanced Weapons facility in Colorado). He uses self- replicating Nanites which, if released will cause everyone to be a slave of Overlord. Then Raven is exposed to Animus. The four, along with Lucy, Nigel, Franz, Nero and Prof. Pike flee to the Megalodon, an enormous submarine that belongs to Darkdoom. The battle is nearing the end, and The Disciples, followers of Overlord, are winning. Nero and Darkdoom must call into action their final effort - Zero Hour, in a desperate battle to the death. Zero Hour involves all the most successful ex-Alphas, each out-fitted with brand-new machinery and gadgets. They have to fight, and Lucy ends up dying, in a sacrifice for Otto. She tells him, \\"There always has to be a choice.\\" The heroes survive, and it is obvious that Overlord is no more, but the organization that supports him is still very much there (the Disciples). Nero disbands the ruling council of G.L.O.V.E, telling them that they are a part of a \\"By-gone era\\". =Aftershock= The former members of the G.L.O.V.E. ruling council are outraged at Nero's decision to disband the whole of the ruling council and create an entire new one, so they decide to join the Disciples in a plot to sabotage the H.I.V.E. training program called the Hunt. Nero does not know the former council has joined The Disciples. Meanwhile, Dr. Nero has underestimated the cunning and resources of those who oppose him. Chief Dekker, the new Chief of Security at H.I.V.E. is actually a member of the Disciples (Overlord's followers), who forces Laura to find out the location of the Hunt or she will get the Disciples to kill Laura's family. Laura manages to persuade Otto and the others to help her to steal the location of the Hunt, even though they do not know what Chief Dekker had forced their friend to do. When the Alphas set out to the Hunt, the Disciples were waiting for them. They murder fifteen Alpha students and kidnap the rest of them (including Laura, Nigel and the two new students, Tom and Penny- Otto's old friends) and they are taken to the mysterious assassin training facility called the Glasshouse by Anastasia Furan – the new leader of the Disciples and a ghostly character from Raven's past. Luckily, Otto, Wing, Shelby and Franz manage to escape and return to H.I.V.E., but Otto ends up being expelled for his part in the stealing of the location of the Hunt. Dr Nero decides to make an agreement with Otto: if he, Raven and H.I.V.E.mind can track down the Disciples, then he will be allowed to return to H.I.V.E. The book ends with Raven and Otto traveling through Europe to assassinate the Disciples. =Deadlock= Otto and Raven are desperate to rescue their friends from the clutches of Anastasia Furan, head of the evil Disciples organization. First they must track down the location of the Glasshouse, the prison where Furan trains children to become ruthless assassins. But Otto is also being hunted. The past three months that Otto has spent away from H.I.V.E. have given the Artemis Section an opportunity to locate him. The Artemis Section is an elite division of the American intelligence services that specializes in capturing the toughest targets. They report only to the President, which is very bad news for Otto. During the period when the pupils are captured in the Glasshouse Tom dies after an escape attempt. However, they managed to send a signal of their whereabouts to H.I.V.E as this happened. Anastasia Furan spent years trying to create a clone which looks like Otto named Zero. Otto kills Zero with the help of H.I.V.E. Mind, who transferred to the supercomputer inside Zero's head and the New Glasshouse is destroyed. Nero takes Anastasia and locks her beneath H.I.V.E. The book ends with Otto and Laura kissing and a short chapter at the end. Before, Zero had hinted at there being more clones. The short chapter shows a dozen or so cloning vats. Inside of each is a growing clone of Otto. There is a countdown above each vat. This is also currently the last book in the series. CharactersH.I.V.E. students= *Otto Malpense – The main character of the series, a white-haired English boy who was raised in an orphanage. At H.I.V.E., he discovered the ability to interface telepathically with computer networks, which is due to a supercomputer implanted into his brain by Overlord in order to make Otto the perfect replacement body. Although Otto's ability to communicate with computers is very useful when searching for information, it leaves him vulnerable to possession by Overlord and other artificial intelligences like Animus, although the supercomputer allowed him a refuge from which to regain control of his body. In Aftershock, Otto was expelled from H.I.V.E. because he had unknowingly been part of a plan which led to the murder of fifteen Alpha students and the kidnapping of the rest of them (apart from himself, Wing, Shelby and Franz). *Wing Fanchu – A tall Asian boy who is Otto's best friend. His parents, Wu Zhang and Xiu Mei Chen, were G.L.O.V.E. operatives in hiding after the failure of the Overlord project. After his mother's death, he was enrolled at H.I.V.E. by his fathers request. He is very loyal to his friends and protects them in times of danger, but he is often teased for lacking a sense of humour. He refuses to kill his enemies because he promised his mother he would never take a life. Wing had a difficult relationship with his father, who became the villain Cypher in Overlord Protocol, and who he believed to be dead on more than one occasion. In the Overlord Protocol, Cypher fell from a high-up walkway and Wing thought he'd killed him, but, his father reappeared in Rogue, but Wing greeted him only with anger and eventually shot him after he tried to kill Otto, leaving him definitely dead this time. *Laura Brand – A Scottish girl who is an expert computer hacker. She was sent to H.I.V.E. after hacking into a military airbase to spy on a school friend's conversations. She is close friends with her roommate Shelby and enjoys discussing computers with Otto, who it is hinted she has a romantic attraction to. In Aftershock, this attraction was proven to be true. In Aftershock, she was forced by Chief Dekker (who was actually a member of the Disciples) to find out the location of the Hunt, or she would get the Disciples to kill Laura's family. Laura did what she was told and got the location of the Hunt for Dekker, which led to the murder of fifteen Alpha students and the kidnapping of the rest of them (apart from Otto, Wing, Shelby and Franz). Laura joined the kidnapped Alpha students in the Glasshouse *Shelby Trinity – A wealthy American girl who joined H.I.V.E. after gaining fame as the jewel thief \\"The Wraith\\". She is good at martial arts, but her area of expertise is stealth and lock-picking. She is the most talkative and adventurous of the group, and it is sometimes hinted that she has romantic feelings for Wing. In Zero Hour, she started a romantic relationship with Wing. She is very sarcastic and tries to make light of any situation the group find themselves in. Her greatest fear is being locked up - probably from being 'The Wraith'. *Nigel Darkdoom – Son of the infamous Diabolus Darkdoom. He is reluctant to follow in his father's footsteps, particularly as he believes his father is dead until Escape Velocity. He excels at Hydroponics, and in the first book inadvertently creates a monster plant named \\"Violet\\" which attacks the school. Although he is sometimes considered weak, he insists on helping the others in times of danger. He is best friends with Franz and the pair of them are often bullied by Block and Tackle. *Franz Argentblum – Son of a German chocolate magnate and villain. English is not his first language and his grammar is often unusual. He is described as very overweight, and constantly thinking about food. He is close friends with Nigel. Often in the series, apart from the first book, he reminds his friends about his heroics in saving the school in The Overlord Protocol, where he apprehends Colonel Francisco before a bomb attached to the energy generator, transferring the power from the active volcano, blows up. *Tom Ransom – A student at H.I.V.E. who arrived at the beginning of Aftershock. He is an orphan who went to the same orphanage as Otto and is mentioned in book 1 to steal things for him. After Otto left the orphanage, he and his friend Penny started their own wealth redistribution program (nicknamed “the Hoods” after Robin Hood) until they came to H.I.V.E. in Aftershock and they joined the Alpha stream. He and Penny are captured by the Disciples and taken to the Glasshouse. To cause a distraction so Laura could send a distress signal, Tom deliberately got into a fight with Nigel, the fight was broken up by Anastasia Furan who shot Tom in the chest - killing him. *Penny Richards – A student at H.I.V.E. who arrived at the beginning of Aftershock. She is an orphan who went to the same orphanage as Otto and is mentioned in book 1 to steal things for him. After Otto left the orphanage, she and her friend Tom started their own wealth redistribution program (nicknamed “the Hoods” after Robin Hood) until they came to H.I.V.E. in Aftershock and they joined the Alpha stream. She and Tom are captured by the Disciples and taken to the Glasshouse. Tom's death turns her against Otto and his friends. *Viscontessa Lucia Sinestre a.k.a. Lucy Dexter – A new student at H.I.V.E. who arrived at the beginning of Dreadnought and was placed in the same Alpha stream class as the others. She quickly befriended the group, particularly Laura and Shelby, but she was initially sceptical of their tales of past adventures. She was the granddaughter of the Contessa and shared her ability to control others with her voice, although she could only control a few people at once. In Zero Hour she started a romantic relationship with Otto, but later in the book, she was shot by Furan who was being controlled by Overlord and she was presumably eaten by the Animus nanites along with Furan and Overlord. Otto refused to leave her to die but she used her voice powers to force him to leave and save himself. *Block and Tackle - Two students from the Henchman stream who repeatedly bully the Alphas, particularly Otto and Wing.This is described as a result of Otto and Wing taking them down in the first book, which makes them look foolish as they are supposedly strong and unbeatable. *Cole Harrington – A fifth-year Politics and Finance stream student who attempted to forcefully take H.I.V.E. mind's source code from Otto (only minutes after Otto had stolen it himself) and sell it on the black market. Otto managed to frame Harrington so it looked like he had stolen the code, and he was locked in the brig at H.I.V.E. He was later killed by Chief Dekker (who was actually working for the Disciples) in her attempt to make it look like he had committed suicide. =H.I.V.E. staff= *Dr. Maximilian Nero - The Headmaster of H.I.V.E. who became the leader of G.L.O.V.E. at the end of Rogue. He is a very careful villain who prefers to plan before acting, and in spite of his reputation for heartlessness, he cares a lot about H.I.V.E. and its students. He also treats Raven as a friend and is very protective of her. He has run H.I.V.E. since the 1960s, although he only appears in his 30s. In the past, he was involved in the Overlord project and he was nearly killed. *Contessa Maria Sinistre - Originally one of Nero's most trusted teachers, she was bribed by Cypher to help him in the Overlord Protocol. She had the ability to make anybody do what she ordered them to, although the strong willed could resist her. In Escape Velocity, she became headmistress of H.I.V.E. after Nero's kidnap and was involved in a plan to attack the school, but she changed sides and sacrificed her life to save the students, and she was remembered as a hero. She had a daughter who died, and a granddaughter, Lucy Dexter. *Natalya/Raven, used as a code name, is the most feared assassin in H.I.V.E. and perhaps the rest of the world. She was trained by the Furans during her childhood at their terrifying castle – the Glasshouse. After seeing her best friend, Dimitri, shot dead by Anastasia Furan and after being forced by the Furans to kill her other friend Tolya, Raven swore that she would kill them both for what they had done to her and her friends. She has a long, curved scar that runs down one cheek. She has a pale but beautiful face, perfectly symmetrical (except the scar) and has cold blue eyes. Her main weapons are a pair of dual katanas, which she uses with great expertise and she had been in possession of since she was forced to kill her friend Tolya with them during her childhood at the Glasshouse. She replaced her original katanas with newer ones Professor Pike created in the Overlord Protocol. *Colonel Francisco – The head of Tactical Education at H.I.V.E. who is thought of by the students as one of the toughest teachers at H.I.V.E. He has an artificial metal hand. *Professor Theodore Pike – The head of the Technology department at H.I.V.E. and was one of the original creators of H.I.V.E.mind. He appears to be disorganized and distracted, but he has a brilliant, shrewd and cunning mind. He looks at least a hundred years old and his hairs seems to explode from his head like a firework. *Ms. Tabitha Leon – The head of Stealth and Evasion at H.I.V.E. whose consciousness got transferred into the body of her pet cat after a failed experiment by Professor Pike. Although she dislikes being a cat, she finds some new features like enhanced hearing and claws very useful. *Ms. Gonzales – The head of the Biotechnology department at H.I.V.E. who is an expert on all kinds of plants. Genetic manipulation of plant life to produce a host of dangerous and deadly results is her specialty. *H.I.V.E.mind - H.I.V.E.mind is the school's AI who runs and monitors the entire school and was created by Professor Pike. In the battle with Overlord in Escape Velocity, H.I.V.E.mind sacrificed his life to destroy Overlord by telling Otto to delete both Overlord and himself from Otto's mind, but H.I.V.E.mind later rebuilds himself in Rogue (unfortunately Overlord also rebuilt himself). In Zero Hour, H.I.V.E.mind was downloaded into the device in Otto's head and he later helped to finally destroy Overlord for good. Although he had to get out of Otto's head at the end of Zero Hour, he was allowed back in again at the end of Aftershock to help Otto to track down the Disciples. *Chief Lewis – The former head of H.I.V.E.’s security teams who played a secondary role in most books. In the fourth book Dreadnought he wasn’t mentioned, instead Head of Security was Chief Monroe. He was a trustworthy member of staff and was either very good at his job or just very lucky to have survived as long as he did. But, in Zero Hour, he was killed by Raven while she was infected with Animus and under the control of Overlord and the Disciples. *Chief Dekker – The new Head of Security at H.I.V.E. who came to the school in Aftershock, after Chief Lewis’ death in Zero Hour. She was tall and painfully thin, had short grey hair and eyes that always seemed to be watching you. Dekker was actually a member of the Disciples who forced Laura to find out the location of the Hunt in Aftershock, or she would get the Disciples to kill Laura's family, which led to the murder of fifteen Alpha students and the kidnapping of the rest of them (apart from Otto, Wing, Shelby and Franz). But Nero and Raven found out that Dekker was a Disciple, and she was tortured until she gave Raven the location where Laura's parents had been kept. Unfortunately, she did not know where Laura and the other kidnapped Alphas had been taken. *Mrs. McTavish – H.I.V.E.’s librarian who was mentioned in Escape Velocity when she pulled Otto out of his virtual computer world and back into the real world. *Ms. Tennenbaum – The German head of the Finance and Corruption department at H.I.V.E. who is usually one of the most emotionless teachers in the school. *Mr. Rictor – The teacher of Logistics and Operations at H.I.V.E. who (according to Otto) is not the most enthralling speaker, but the information he shares is fascinating. *Dr. Scott – H.I.V.E.’s chief medical officer who was the only person in the world until Rogue apart from Nero who knew that Cypher had survived his attempt to destroy H.I.V.E. in Overlord Protocol. Dr Scott also helped to cure Diabolus Darkdoom when he was shot in Rogue, and he helped to cure Nero when he was stabbed in Zero Hour. =G.L.O.V.E. members= *Number One – The former commander of the G.L.O.V.E. who was actually being controlled by Overlord since when he attempted to destroy the AI. He was killed in Escape Velocity, however Overlord lived on. Otto is Number One's clone and he looks exactly like the young Number One. *The Reapers – Number One's personal executioners, an utterly ruthless death squad that left no one alive in its wake. They all carry heavy machine guns and wear black body armour that have white skulls on the faceplates. *The Phalanx – The elite, well-trained team of operatives who were tasked with the protection of Number One himself. All the members of the Phalanx wore tiny skull-shaped pins somewhere on their bodies. A small group of Phalanx came to H.I.V.E. in Escape Velocity to protect the Contessa when she became headmistress. *Diabolus Darkdoom - Diabolus Darkdoom is an infamous villain who was considered a legend and was the leader of G.L.O.V.E. during Dreadnought and Rogue. Number One believed he knew too much about the Renaissance Initiative and had him framed as a traitor. Diabolus then faked his death before he could be killed and lived on his submarine, Megalodon, for several years. In Escape Velocity, he helped Otto to rescue Dr. Nero in the Swiss Alps, and he helped to destroy Overlord for good in Zero Hour. His son, Nigel Darkdoom, is a student of H.I.V.E. *Cypher (Mao Fanchu/Wu Zhang) - Originally the co-creator of Overlord, Cypher is a lunatic who planned a revolt against Number One in Overlord Protocol which failed. He was hidden in the vaults of H.I.V.E. until Rogue, when he tricked Nero and Professor Pike into letting him out so he could help them, which led to his escape. He was shot by his son Wing later in Rogue, after trying to kill Otto in order to destroy Overlord. *Xiu Mei Chen – Wing's mother and the creator of Overlord. It was thought that she was killed by Overlord, but she actually survived and started a new life in Japan as Wing's mother, but she found out about the Overlord Protocol – some codes that if they came into Overlord's possession, he would be able to rebuild himself and would be able to control all of the computer systems in the world. Xiu Mei Chen knew that he could not be allowed to do this, so she hid the codes in two twin ying-yang amulets. She gave one amulet to Wing, and sent the other to Nero. Number One found out that she knew about the Overlord Protocol, so he ordered for her to be killed. *Joseph Wright – The former head of G.L.O.V.E.’s British operations. After Nero disbanded the whole to the G.L.O.V.E. ruling council at the end of Zero Hour and created an entire new one, he attempted to kill Nero at the beginning of Aftershock, but failed. Later in the book, Wright was contracted by the Disciples in Aftershock and joined them in a plan to destroy G.L.O.V.E. *Wade Jackson – The former head of G.L.O.V.E.’s North American operations who was dismissed from the ruling council at the end of Zero Hour when Nero disbanded the whole of the council and created an entire new one, so he joined the Disciples at the beginning of Aftershock. *Luca Venturi – The former head of G.L.O.V.E.’s Southern European operations who was dismissed from the ruling council at the end of Zero Hour when Nero disbanded the whole of the council and created an entire new one, so he joined the Disciples at the beginning of Aftershock. *Felicia Diaz – The former head of G.L.O.V.E.’s South American operation who joined G.L.O.V.E. in Zero Hour as the successor to Carlos Chavez. She was dismissed from the ruling council at the end of Zero Hour when Nero disbanded the whole of the council and created an entire new one, so she joined the Disciples at the beginning of Aftershock. *Baron Von Sturm – A former G.L.O.V.E. member who was dismissed from the ruling council at the end of Zero Hour when Nero disbanded the whole of the council and created an entire new one, so he joined the Disciples at the beginning of Aftershock. *Lin Feng – The former head of G.L.O.V.E.’s Chinese operations who was actually working for the Disciples. At the end of Rogue, he attempted to leave G.L.O.V.E. because he was angry about Nero's decision to become the head of G.L.O.V.E., but the Disciples forced him to beg Nero for his seat back because they needed a man inside G.L.O.V.E. In Zero Hour, Feng was betrayed by the Disciples and was killed by Raven while she was infected with Animus and under their control. *Carlos Chavez – The former chief of G.L.O.V.E.’s South American operations whose villainous career had started in the slums of Rio. In Rogue, he attempted to kill Raven because he was angry at Diabolus Darkdoom for becoming head of G.L.O.V.E. instead of himself. But Raven found out that Chavez had tried to kill her, so she killed him at the end of Rogue. *The Lobos – Carlos Chavez's team of soldiers and assassins who trained in an underground area underneath Chavez's office building in Rio. Most of these men were killed in Rogue when they launched an attack on Raven on Mount Corcovado in Rio. *Rafael – Carlos Chavez's most trusted lieutenant and a member of the Lobos. He was sent on a mission by Chavez to eliminate Raven in Rogue, which led to him being killed when Raven slit his throat and the failure of the mission. *Madam Mortis – A former member of G.L.O.V.E. who was killed by Otto at the beginning of Rogue when he was infected by Animus and under H.O.P.E. ’s control. In Overlord Protocol, she came up with the idea of using computer controlled sharks to kill G.L.O.V.E.’s enemies, but this idea was rejected by Number One. *Jonas Steiner – A former G.L.O.V.E. member who was killed at the beginning of Rogue when Otto (who has been injected by Animus and was being controlled by H.O.P.E) sabotaged his private jet's navigation system and autopilot, causing it to crash into the Bavarian Alps. *Gregori Leonov – A Russian man who was one of the longest surviving members of G.L.O.V.E. and was a good friend of Nero. The Reapers (Number One's executioners) killed his whole family in Escape Velocity when he discovered the Renaissance Initiative (Number One's plans to rebuild Overlord) and when Leonov tried to warn Nero about these plans, he was killed by a H.O.P.E. assassin. *Yuri Leonov – The son of Gregori Leonov who once attended H.I.V.E. but worked for his father in Overlord Protocol. He was killed by the Reapers (Number One's executioners) in Escape Velocity when Number One sent them to kill his father and all of his family. *Agent One – A Japanese bodyguard who helped Raven to protect Wing and Otto in Tokyo in Overlord Protocol. He was killed when Cypher's robots attacked the safe house they were hiding him and one of the robots broke his neck after he threw a smoke grenade. *Agent Zero – An American bodyguard who helped Raven to protect Wing and Otto in Tokyo in Overlord Protocol. He was killed when he was shot by Cypher. *Jason Drake– An American former G.L.O.V.E. member and owner of multi-nation corporation Drake Industries, which developed much of the advanced technology that G.L.O.V.E. used on a daily basis. He was a handsome man with short dark hair and an immaculately trimmed goatee beard. He went rogue in Dreadnought and began to work for the Disciples, believing that Number One's death was a coup by Maximilian Nero and Diabolus Darkdoom in order to seize control of G.L.O.V.E. He was further angered when his greatest project (The Dreadnought) was taken by Darkdoom as his flagship, when previously he hoped to present it to Number One in order to gain favor with him. Drake was killed by Pietor Furan when he revealed that the Disciples no longer needed him. He was responsible for the design of the Shroud dropships, the larger Leviathan, and the Dreadnought. =The Disciples= *Pietor Furan - An assassin who used to work for the Spetsnaz, Russia's elite special forces unit, who was then recruited by the Disciples. He and his sister, Anastasia Furan, created the Glasshouse – a castle in the snowy wilderness of Russia where they cruelly trained children who they hoped would become their future assassins. This is the place where Furan and his sister trained Raven, although Raven swore that she would kill them after Anastasia shot her best friend, Dimitri, and forced her to kill her other friend, Tolya. Pietor Furan was tall, heavily muscled, and Ukrainian, with closely shaved grey hair and a star shaped pattern of scars surrounding his right eye, which was blinded by Raven when she was 11 years old. He first appeared in Dreadnought and seemed to be working for Jason Drake, but, under the Disciples orders he infected the Dreadnought with Animus and killed Jason before making his escape. While working for the Disciples in Zero Hour, Pietor Furan was killed when Raven stabbed him with one of her katanas. Only seconds after his death, Overlord took over his body and used his as a host, but he was eaten alive by Animus nanites. *Anastasia Furan/Minerva - The leader of the Disciples in Aftershock who helped to train Raven with her brother, Pietor Furan. She and her brother created the Glasshouse – a castle in the snowy wilderness of Russia where they cruelly trained children who they hoped would become their assassins. This is the place where she and her brother trained Raven, although Raven swore that she would kill them after Anastasia shot her best friend, Dimitri, and forced her to kill her other friend, Tolya. In the past, Anastasia Furan sent Raven to kill Nero, but instead she was captured and brought to the temporary H.I.V.E. when the new facility was still under construction. Nero managed to convince Raven that she had a choice and didn't have to listen to Anastasia. A few months later, Nero, Diabolus Darkdoom and Raven carried out an attack on the Glasshouse and when Anastasia was about to escape in a helicopter, Raven shot the helicopter down and thought Anastasia to be dead. However, Pietor found Anastasia still alive and she managed to survive, although it left her face hideously disfigured and covered in scar tissue, relics of horrific burns due to the fire she endured in the wreckage of the crashed helicopter. Anastasia got her revenge on Raven in Aftershock by finding out the location of the Hunt, murdering fifteen Alpha students and kidnapping the rest of them (apart from Otto, Wing, Shelby and Franz). *Tobias Scheckter – An eastern European geologist who was running from the Disciples at the beginning of Dreadnought. While working for them, he had found out what they were planning and tried to warn the Government, but he was arrested by a local policeman called Sam Fletcher. The policeman's car was bombed by the Disciples and both Tobias and the policeman were killed. *Duncan Cavendish/Disciple 9 – The British prime minister during Book 6 - Zero Hour. Dr Nero requests access to GCHQ from him for Otto, Wing, Shelby, and Laura to allow H.I.V.E.mind to transmit the Zero Hour Code. It turns out that he was working for the Disciples all along and after granting them access gave Pietor Furan the students' location. =H.O.P.E. Characters= *Sebastian Trent - The former leader of H.O.P.E. who told the world that he was trying to stop terrorism, but he actually helped Overlord and the Disciples. He was thin, pale and completely bald, apart from a neatly clipped band of white hair above each ear. He was killed in Rogue by Animus that had a tiny part of Overlord inside, which meant that even though Overlord should have been permanently destroyed, he lived on because he used Trent's body as a host. *Dr. Creed – The scientist at H.O.P.E. who injected Animus into Otto's body so that H.O.P.E. could control him. He was killed at the end of Rogue when he was infected by some Animus that had a tiny part of Overlord inside it, which meant that Creed was the host for Overlord's rebirth. *Verity/Ghost – Originally one of the two twin assassins (the other being Constance) who worked for H.O.P.E. in Escape Velocity. Being identical twins, she and her sister had long blonde hair tied back in ponytails and upper-class British accents. When her sister was killed by Raven in Escape Velocity by falling on one of Raven's katanas, Verity was bound and gagged and taken captive by Raven, but freed by another unknown H.O.P.E member. She was distorted and tried to avenge her sister by killing Raven, but failed. Although she was killed when she fell from a cable car in Escape Velocity, she was brought back as a cyborg and was code named Ghost. The scientists at H.O.P.E. enhanced her body by fusing her flesh with cybernetic implants and they made her armor that could not be penetrated by Raven's katanas. Even with these enhancements, she was eventually killed when Raven cut off her head in Rogue. *Constance – One of the two twin assassins (the other being Verity) who worked for H.O.P.E. in Escape Velocity. Being identical twins, she and her sister had long blonde hair tied back in ponytails and upper-class British accents. She died after being pushed by Raven onto one of her katanas that Verity was holding. =Other Characters= * Overlord – The murderous AI (artificial intelligence) who wanted to take over the world. He was created by Xiu Mei Chen in the mountains of China twenty years ago and he was nearly destroyed by Number One, but at the last minute Overlord used him as a host and lived on. Although it was thought that Otto destroyed Overlord when he tried to take over Otto's mind in Escape Velocity, a tiny part of Overlord survived and he rebuilt himself inside Otto's head in Rogue. Laura shot Otto with a neural pulse devise that Cypher and Professor Pike had built and Overlord was forced out of Otto's head, but because Overlord had fused with the Animus inside Otto, the AI developed the ability to move from body to body, erasing their personality and eventually killing them. Overlord was finally destroyed for good when Otto left him to be eaten by Animus nanites in Zero Hour. * The Architect/Nathaniel – The man who designed buildings for various organizations (and accidentally the next Glasshouse), revealed to be Nero's father in Deadlock. * Nazim Khan – The Arabic man who designed H.O.P.E.’s camouflaged facility in the Amazon Rainforest in Rogue. Although the Disciples and H.O.P.E. said that they would protect him, they betrayed him in Rogue and he was attacked by Raven. Khan tried to give Raven the details of Trent’s facility, but he was killed by a micro-explosive device implanted in his skull that was triggered remotely by H.O.P.E. *Dimitri – The young Raven’s best friend at the Glasshouse (the Furans’ castle where they cruelly trained children who they hoped would become their assassins). During a failed escape attempt from the Glasshouse, Dimitri was killed when Anastasia Furan shot him after he had tried to be a hero and get survival suits for Raven and Tolya as well as himself. Raven described him as the only person the Furans had not broken in spirit and so he helped the others to not break as well. *Tolya – One of the young Raven's friends at the Glasshouse (the Furans’ castle where they cruelly trained children who they hoped would become their assassins). During a failed escape attempt from the Glasshouse, he and Raven watched their best friend Dimitri be shot and killed by Anastasia Furan. The Furans then locked Tolya and Raven up for weeks, but Tolya went insane and the Furans set him against Raven which he did without hesitation, forcing Raven to kill him. As he died, there was realization in his eyes which left Raven guilty. *Mary, Andrew, and Douglas Brand – Laura's parents and baby brother who were kidnapped by the Disciples in Aftershock and were used to threaten Laura into finding out the location of the Hunt. Although Laura gave the location of the Hunt to the Disciples, the Brands were going to be killed by them, but they were saved just in time by Raven. *Mrs. McReedy – The head of Otto's former orphanage (St Sebastian's) before he came to H.I.V.E., but in reality, Otto was actually running the orphanage for her. Otto seemed to care about her or he may have just wanted to keep her there because he knew he could use her to control the Orphanage. She was the test subject for his hypnosis device, and he had her on all four's acting like a dog for a couple of minutes . *Lao – An old Japanese man who maintained the gardens of Wing's childhood house. He trained Wing to fight and was the closest thing to a father that Wing ever had. He tried to fight off the men from H.I.V.E. who came to take Wing away and failed, but survived. *Captain Sanders – The captain of the Megalodon (Diabolus Darkdoom's huge submarine) in Escape Velocity and Zero Hour. *Dr. Charles Morley – The leader of the group of scientists who cloned Number One to create the baby Otto. When they had completed the job, Morley and his team were all killed by explosive devices that Number One had hidden throughout the facility where Otto was created so that they could not tell anyone what they had been doing there. *Elena Furan – She was Anastasia and Pietor Furan's sister. In Aftershock, Anastasia told Raven to kill Nero because he killed someone she loved previously. Nero also wanted Anastasia dead because she killed someone he loved. Both characters are referring to Elena Furan, whom both thought the opposite side had killed. Organizations and Facilities *H.I.V.E. – The Higher Institute of Villainous Education which is a school for children skilled at evil. *G.L.O.V.E. – The Global League of Villainous Enterprises which was originally run by Number One, but Diabolus Darkdoom became its leader at the end of Escape Velocity and in Dreadnought, and Nero became its leader at the end of Rogue. G.L.O.V.E.’s symbol is a fist hammering down on to a splintering globe. At the end of Zero Hour, Nero disbanded the whole of the G.L.O.V.E. ruling council and created an entirely new one, which led to the former council members joining the Disciples. *The Disciples – Overlord's most trusted followers and supporters who will do anything to destroy G.L.O.V.E. and continue Overlord's work. *H.O.P.E. – The Hostile Operative Prosecution Executive which claimed that it was an anti-terrorist organization, but it was actually helping the Disciples. Its symbol was an angel flying upwards with a sword held aloft in its outstretched hands. *The Glasshouse – Pietor and Anastasia Furan's castle in which they cruelly train children who they hope will turn into their assassins. It was located somewhere in the snowy wilderness of Russia. This is the place in which Raven was trained by the Furans during her childhood, and it is also the place in which all of the kidnapped Alpha stream students at H.I.V.E. were taken at the end of Aftershock. *The Advanced Weapons Project Facility (AWP) – The secret base in Colorado where the Goliaths were created in Zero Hour. During the demonstration of the Goliaths, Overlord and the Disciples arrived and captured all of the important government workers who were there for the demonstration. AWP became Overlord's base for the days that followed, and it was the place where the final battle between Overlord's forces and the Zero Hour team of former H.I.V.E. pupils took place. AWP was blown up by a nuclear missile at the end of Zero Hour in order to destroy the Animus nanites that Overlord had released. *The Vault – The most secure place in the Advanced Weapons Project Facility (AWP) and was where Overlord and Pietor Furan retreated to in Zero Hour with Laura and Lucy as hostages when they realised that Nero's Zero Hour team of former H.I.V.E. pupils were inside the AWP facility. Raven and Otto managed to get inside the Vault, which led to the deaths of Overlord, Furan and Lucy, but Raven, Otto and Laura made it out alive. *The Government Communication Headquarters (GCHQ) - The hub of Britain's intelligence communications network which is located in Cheltenham. In Zero Hour, Nero talked to the Prime Minister (a former H.I.V.E. pupil) and managed to get Otto and the other Alphas unrestricted access to GCHQ, so that they could use the equipment there to activate Nero's plan “Zero Hour” in order to stop Overlord. Although the team of Alphas did manage to activate Zero Hour, the Prime Minister betrayed them, which led to the capture of Otto, Laura and Lucy by the Disciples. *Echelon – The area inside the Government Communication Headquarters (GCHQ) in which every phone call, every internet search and every radio transmission was searched through by intelligent algorithms, looking for any hints to terrorist activity. In Zero Hour, Otto and the other Alphas had to go to Echelon in order to use the equipment there to activate Nero's plan “Zero Hour”. At the end of the book Zero Hour, Otto activated a code that permanently shut down Echelon as a symbol for Lucy saying 'everybody has a choice'. *Deepcore – MI6's most secure data storage archive, which is one hundred metres below the MI6 headquarters and is surrounded by security systems that are supposedly impossible to breach. Raven, Otto and the other Alphas had to break into Deepcore in Escape Velocity to find out where H.O.P.E. was keeping Nero prisoner. Machines and Devices *Animus – Self- replicating organic supercomputers which is used to control people and has the appearance of black slime. It was created by Overlord and it can take control of any system that it is inserted into. In and before Rogue, anyone apart from Otto who was injected with Animus would be killed by it because it's complexity made it lethal to most humans, but in Zero Hour, a new of Animus was developed by Overlord that was much simpler and therefore not lethal, but also unable to contain Overlord. Later in Zero Hour, Otto, Professor Pike and H.I.V.E.mind managed to create an antidote for Animus when Otto injected himself with a small sample and forced a connection with it, allowing H.I.V.E.mind to interface with and modify its code. The antidote of Animus was able to interface with Animus to reprogram it to act on the most basic principles of a computer virus - reprogramming code to copy itself by reprogramming more code. *Blackboxes – PDA devices used at H.I.V.E. that every student must have with them at all times. They are tracking devices, but they can also be useful in many other ways. *Grapplers – Devices that can be used to scale vertical surfaces or to descend safely from elevated positions. They look like armoured gauntlets with a small handle at one end and a bulky assembly attached to one side with a silver arrowhead protruding from it. *Raven's Twin Katanas – Raven's swords that she carries with her everywhere. She has had them since the age of thirteen, when she was forced by Pietor and Anastasia Furan to use them to kill her friend, Tolya. In Overlord Protocol, Professor Pike replaced the swords with new, updated ones that are electromagnetically shielded with a purple force field which means that they can cut through even the toughest metals. *Goliaths – Huge robots that were created by an American military organisation and have the ability to destroy tanks from the ground and in the air. At thirty metres tall, these armoured metal robots have multi-barreled Gatling cannons mounted on each arm and rocket pods on each shoulder. In the centre of each of the machines’ chests is a black glass cockpit shrouded in heavy armour where the pilot would sit and control it. *The Shrouds – H.I.V.E.’s aircraft that have cloaking fields that make them completely invisible to infrared and electromagnetic sensors and nearly invisible to optical sensors and have giant VTOL engines. *Dreadnought – Diabolus Darkdoom’s permanently airborne defence craft which looked almost like an advanced type of aerodynamic battleship but with four huge jet turbines that held the massive vessel aloft. It was made by Jason Drake and was designed to stay airborne indefinitely and provide G.L.O.V.E. with a permanent command post that was both safe and discreet. The craft was equipped with thermoptic camouflage systems just like the Shrouds, but it could also harness local weather systems used a feature called the Zeus Sphere, which could entirely conceal its presence from the eyes of the world. The craft was powered by the world’s first functioning fusion reactor, which meant that it harnessed the power of the sun and as such there was never any need to refuel. The craft was destroyed at the end of the book “Dreadnought” in which it was featured in. *Megalodon – Diabolus Darkdoom's huge stealth submarine which is the largest sub ever constructed and was used to save Otto and his friends in Escape Velocity and in Zero Hour. It is a completely self-sufficient vessel that can operate without resupply for years at a time and has the sonar signature of a torpedo, indicating that its anti-sonar technology and construction may have been based on the B2 stealth bombers anti-radar design. *Hammerhead – Diabolus Darkdoom's mini-submarine that Nero, Otto and the other Alphas used to escape the Megalodon in when they were being attacked by American Navy submarines in Zero Hour. It is essentially the Megalodon constructed on a smaller scale. *The Leviathan – A fully operational airborne command centre with a full cloak capability and the latest generation of long- range scramjet engines which used to belong to Jason Drake, but was used by Nero and Darkdoom in Zero Hour to travel to where Overlord and his forces were in order stop Overlord. *Overwatch – Jason Drake's satellite which had the ability to track down a single man anywhere in the world in a matter of seconds. It was used to scan New York in Dreadnought in order to find Nero, Raven, Otto and the other Alphas. It was launched with another satellite that Drake Industries did not work on – a deep black military project called Thor's Hammer that was designed to work in unison with Overwatch. *Thor's Hammer – A satellite that could fire a nuclear missile from orbit which could pierce so far underground before detonating that it could destroy an entire underground terrorist base in the blink of an eye. Jason Drake found out how to control it in Dreadnought, and planned to make a missile hit Yellowstone National Park which would trigger the supervolcano that lies beneath it, but luckily, Otto sabotaged this plan. In Zero Hour, Otto used Thor's Hammer to destroy a swarm of Animus nanites that Overlord released into the world. *The Zeus Sphere – A feature on the Dreadnought which could directly manipulate the climate immediately surrounding the craft to cloak it in storm clouds that were fully under control and could entirely conceal the aircraft's presence from the eyes of the world. *The Football – The slang name for the device that controlled access to launch codes for America's entire nuclear arsenal which is looked after by the President of the United States. In Dreadnought, Jason Drake kidnapped the President and the device was under Drake's control but, luckily, Otto sabotaged Drake's plans. *Hunter Drones – Jason Drake's small, mechanical assassination devices which were set on Nero, Otto and Wing in Dreadnought when they broke into Drake Industries’ headquarters in New York. The deadly machines were fitted with heavy machine guns and had twin turbine pods on each side which meant that they had the ability to fly. *Integrated Systems Infiltration Suit (ISIS) – A suit that combines thermoptic camouflage with advance Kevlar polymer body weave. It is fitted with an array of electromagnetic devices, including a full EM scrambler pulse, and antipersonnel discharge unit and a high-powered adhesion field built into the palms and soles of the boots. Grappler units are mounted on both arms and a full targeting and information HUD is within the helmet. In Zero Hour, these suits were used by the Zero Hour team of former H.I.V.E. pupils in the battle with Overlord and the Disciples’ forces. *Neural Feedback Suit – A suit that H.I.V.E. students have to wear in Colonel Francisco's Tactical Education lessons which allows them to feel pain without suffering any physical injury so that the students take the lessons seriously. The students nicknamed the suit “the Agoniser”. External links * Archived from the original 23-12-2014. References Category:Fantasy novel series ","title":"H.I.V.E.

The subject looks at letters or symbols, and the sequences they form. Combinatorics on words affects various areas of mathematical study, including algebra and computer science. There have been a wide range of contributions to the field. Some of the first work was on square-free words by Axel Thue in the early 1900s. He and colleagues observed patterns within words and tried to explain them. As time went on, combinatorics on words became useful in the study of algorithms and coding. It led to developments in abstract algebra and answering open questions. Definition Combinatorics is an area of discrete mathematics. Discrete mathematics is the study of countable structures. These objects have a definite beginning and end. The study of enumerable objects is the opposite of disciplines such as analysis, where calculus and infinite structures are studied. Combinatorics studies how to count these objects using various representations. Combinatorics on words is a recent development in this field, which focuses on the study of words and formal languages. A formal language is any set of symbols and combinations of symbols that people use to communicate information. Some terminology relevant to the study of words should first be explained. First and foremost, a word is basically a sequence of symbols, or letters, in a finite set. One of these sets is known by the general public as the alphabet. For example, the word \\"encyclopedia\\" is a sequence of symbols in the English alphabet, a finite set of twenty-six letters. Since a word can be described as a sequence, other basic mathematical descriptions can be applied. The alphabet is a set, so as one would expect, the empty set is a subset. In other words, there exists a unique word of length zero. The length of the word is defined by the number of symbols that make up the sequence, and is denoted by w. Again looking at the example \\"encyclopedia\\", w = 12, since encyclopedia has twelve letters. The idea of factoring of large numbers can be applied to words, where a factor of a word is a block of consecutive symbols. Thus, \\"cyclop\\" is a factor of \\"encyclopedia\\". In addition to examining sequences in themselves, another area to consider of combinatorics on words is how they can be represented visually. In mathematics various structures are used to encode data. A common structure used in combinatorics is the tree structure. A tree structure is a graph where the vertices are connected by one line, called a path or edge. Trees may not contain cycles, and may or may not be complete. It is possible to encode a word, since a word is constructed by symbols, and encode the data by using a tree. This gives a visual representation of the object. Major contributions The first books on combinatorics on words that summarize the origins of the subject were written by a group of mathematicians that collectively went by the name of M. Lothaire. Their first book was published in 1983, when combinatorics on words became more widespread. PatternsPatterns within words= A main contributor to the development of combinatorics on words was Axel Thue (1863–1922); he researched repetition. Thue's main contribution was the proof of the existence of infinite square-free words. Square-free words do not have adjacent repeated factors. To clarify, \\"summer\\" is not square-free since m is repeated consecutively, while \\"encyclopedia\\" is square-free. Thue proves his conjecture on the existence of infinite square-free words by using substitutions. A substitution is a way to take a symbol and replace it with a word. He uses this technique to describe his other contribution, the Thue–Morse sequence, or Thue–Morse word. Thue wrote two papers on square-free words, the second of which was on the Thue–Morse word. Marston Morse is included in the name because he discovered the same result as Thue did, yet they worked independently. Thue also proved the existence of an overlap-free word. An overlap-free word is when, for two symbols x and y, the pattern does not exist within the word. He continues in his second paper to prove a relationship between infinite overlap-free words and square-free words. He takes overlap-free words that are created using two different letters, and demonstrates how they can be transformed into square-free words of three letters using substitution. As was previously described, words are studied by examining the sequences made by the symbols. Patterns are found, and they are able to be described mathematically. Patterns can be either avoidable patterns, or unavoidable. A significant contributor to the work of unavoidable patterns, or regularities, was Frank Ramsey in 1930. His important theorem states that for integers k, m≥2, there exists a least positive integer such that despite how a complete graph is colored with two colors, there will always exist a solid color subgraph of each color. Other contributors to the study of unavoidable patterns include van der Waerden. His theorem states that if the positive integers are partitioned into k classes, then there exists a class c such that c contains an arithmetic progression of some unknown length. An arithmetic progression is a sequence of numbers in which the difference between adjacent numbers remains constant. When examining unavoidable patterns sesquipowers are also studied. For some patterns x,y,z, a sesquipower is of the form x, , , .... This is another pattern such as square-free, or unavoidable patterns. Coudrain and Schützenberger mainly studied these sesquipowers for group theory applications. In addition, Zimin proved that sesquipowers are all unavoidable. Whether the entire pattern shows up, or only some piece of the sesquipower shows up repetitively, it is not possible to avoid it. =Patterns within alphabets= Necklaces are constructed from words of circular sequences. They are most frequently used in music and astronomy. Flye Sainte-Marie in 1894 proved there are 22n−1−n binary de Bruijn necklaces of length 2n. A de Bruijn necklace contains factors made of words of length n over a certain number of letters. The words appear only once in the necklace. In 1874, Baudot developed the code that would eventually take the place of Morse code by applying the theory of binary de Bruijn necklaces. The problem continued from Sainte-Marie to Martin in 1934, who began looking at algorithms to make words of the de Bruijn structure. It was then worked on by Posthumus in 1943. Language hierarchy Possibly the most applied result in combinatorics on words is the Chomsky hierarchy, developed by Noam Chomsky. He studied formal language in the 1950s. His way of looking at language simplified the subject. He disregards the actual meaning of the word, does not consider certain factors such as frequency and context, and applies patterns of short terms to all length terms. The basic idea of Chomsky's work is to divide language into four levels, or the language hierarchy. The four levels are: regular, context-free, context-sensitive, and computably enumerable or unrestricted. Regular is the least complex while computably enumerable is the most complex. While his work grew out of combinatorics on words, it drastically affected other disciplines, especially computer science. Word typesSturmian words= Sturmian words, created by François Sturm, have roots in combinatorics on words. There exist several equivalent definitions of Sturmian words. For example, an infinite word is Sturmian if and only if it has n+1 distinct factors of length n, for every non-negative integer n. =Lyndon word= A Lyndon word is a word over a given alphabet that is written in its simplest and most ordered form out of its respective conjugacy class. Lyndon words are important because for any given Lyndon word x, there exists Lyndon words y and z, with y Visual representation Cobham contributed work relating Eugène Prouhet's work with finite automata. A mathematical graph is made of edges and nodes. With finite automata, the edges are labeled with a letter in an alphabet. To use the graph, one starts at a node and travels along the edges to reach a final node. The path taken along the graph forms the word. It is a finite graph because there are a countable number of nodes and edges, and only one path connects two distinct nodes. Gauss codes, created by Carl Friedrich Gauss in 1838, are developed from graphs. Specifically, a closed curve on a plane is needed. If the curve only crosses over itself a finite number of times, then one labels the intersections with a letter from the alphabet used. Traveling along the curve, the word is determined by recording each letter as an intersection is passed. Gauss noticed that the distance between when the same symbol shows up in a word is an even integer. Group theory Walther Franz Anton von Dyck began the work of combinatorics on words in group theory by his published work in 1882 and 1883. He began by using words as group elements. Lagrange also contributed in 1771 with his work on permutation groups. One aspect of combinatorics on words studied in group theory is reduced words. A group is constructed with words on some alphabet including generators and inverse elements, excluding factors that appear of the form aā or āa, for some a in the alphabet. Reduced words are formed when the factors aā, āa are used to cancel out elements until a unique word is reached. Nielsen transformations were also developed. For a set of elements of a free group, a Nielsen transformation is achieved by three transformations; replacing an element with its inverse, replacing an element with the product of itself and another element, and eliminating any element equal to 1. By applying these transformations Nielsen reduced sets are formed. A reduced set means no element can be multiplied by other elements to cancel out completely. There are also connections with Nielsen transformations with Sturmian words. =Considered problems= One problem considered in the study of combinatorics on words in group theory is the following: for two elements x,y of a semigroup, does x=y modulo the defining relations of x and y. Post and Markov studied this problem and determined it undecidable. Undecidable means the theory cannot be proved. The Burnside question was proved using the existence of an infinite cube-free word. This question asks if a group is finite if the group has a definite number of generators and meets the criteria xn=1, for x in the group. Many word problems are undecidable based on the Post correspondence problem. Any two homomorphisms g,h with a common domain and a common codomain form an instance of the Post correspondence problem, which asks whether there exists a word w in the domain such that g(w)=h(w). Post proved that this problem is undecidable; consequently, any word problem that can be reduced to this basic problem is likewise undecidable. Other applications Combinatorics on words have applications on equations. Makanin proved that it is possible to find a solution for a finite system of equations, when the equations are constructed from words.

Flood control methods are used to reduce or prevent the detrimental effects of flood waters.\\"Flood Control\\", MSN Encarta, 2008 (see below: Further reading). Flood relief methods are used to reduce the effects of flood waters or high water levels.  Causes of floods  Relationship between impervious surfaces and surface runoff Floods are caused by many factors or a combination of any of these generally prolonged heavy rainfall (locally concentrated or throughout a catchment area), highly accelerated snowmelt, severe winds over water, unusual high tides, tsunamis, or failure of dams, levees, retention ponds, or other structures that retained the water. Flooding can be exacerbated by increased amounts of impervious surface or by other natural hazards such as wildfires, which reduce the supply of vegetation that can absorb rainfall. Periodic floods occur on many rivers, forming a surrounding region known as the flood plain. Video of a tree and branch catching centre on the banks of the River Ely, Cardiff, Wales. The area is monitored by CCTV and trees removed before they block the river downstream. During times of rain, some of the water is retained in ponds or soil, some is absorbed by grass and vegetation, some evaporates, and the rest travels over the land as surface runoff. Floods occur when ponds, lakes, riverbeds, soil, and vegetation cannot absorb all the water. This has been exacerbated by human activities such as draining wetlands that naturally store large amounts of water and building paved surfaces that do not absorb any water. Water then runs off the land in quantities that cannot be carried within stream channels or retained in natural ponds, lakes, and man-made reservoirs. About 30 percent of all precipitation becomes runoff and that amount might be increased by water from melting snow. River flooding is often caused by heavy rain, sometimes increased by melting snow. A flood that rises rapidly, with little or no warning, is called a flash flood. Flash floods usually result from intense rainfall over a relatively small area, or if the area was already saturated from previous precipitation. = Severe winds over water = Even when rainfall is relatively light, the shorelines of lakes and bays can be flooded by severe winds—such as during hurricanes—that blow water into the shore areas. = Unusually high tides = Coastal areas are sometimes flooded by unusually high tides, such as spring tides, especially when compounded by high winds and storm surges. This was the cause of the North Sea flood of 1953 which flooded large swathes of the Netherlands and the East coast of England and which remains the greatest recorded natural disaster in England.  Effects of floods  Flooding has many impacts. It damages property and endangers the lives of humans and other species. Rapid water runoff causes soil erosion and concomitant sediment deposition elsewhere (such as further downstream or down a coast). The spawning grounds for fish and other wildlife habitats can become polluted or completely destroyed. Some prolonged high floods can delay traffic in areas which lack elevated roadways. Floods can interfere with drainage and economical use of lands, such as interfering with farming. Structural damage can occur in bridge abutments, bank lines, sewer lines, and other structures within floodways. Waterway navigation and hydroelectric power are often impaired. Financial losses due to floods are typically millions of dollars each year, with the worst floods in recent U.S. history having cost billions of dollars. = Benefits of flooding = There are many disruptive effects of flooding on human settlements and economic activities. However, flooding can bring benefits, such as making the soil more fertile and providing it with more nutrients. Periodic flooding was essential to the well-being of ancient communities along the Tigris-Euphrates Rivers, the Nile River, the Indus River, the Ganges and the Yellow River, among others. The viability for hydrologically based renewable sources of energy is higher in flood-prone regions.  Methods of flood management  Some methods of flood control have been practiced since ancient times. These methods include planting vegetation to retain extra water, terracing hillsides to slow flow downhill, and the construction of floodways (man-made channels to divert floodwater). Other techniques include the construction of levees, lakes, dams, reservoirs, retention ponds to hold extra water during times of flooding. = Dams = Xin'an River Dam during 2020 China floods Many dams and their associated reservoirs are designed completely or partially to aid in flood protection and control. Many large dams have flood-control reservations in which the level of a reservoir must be kept below a certain elevation before the onset of the rainy/summer melt season to allow a certain amount of space in which floodwaters can fill. Other beneficial uses of dam created reservoirs include hydroelectric power generation, water conservation, and recreation. Reservoir and dam construction and design is based upon standards, typically set out by the government. In the United States, dam and reservoir design is regulated by the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). Design of a dam and reservoir follows guidelines set by the USACE and covers topics such as design flow rates in consideration to meteorological, topographic, streamflow, and soil data for the watershed above the structure.US Army Corps of Engineers. (1997). Hydrologic engineering requirements for reservoirs. EM 1110-2-1420. Retrieved from http://www.publications.usace.army.mil The term dry dam refers to a dam that serves purely for flood control without any conservation storage (e.g. Mount Morris Dam, Seven Oaks Dam). = Diversion canals = Floods can be controlled by redirecting excess water to purpose-built canals or floodways, which in turn divert the water to temporary holding ponds or other bodies of water where there is a lower risk or impact to flooding. Examples of flood control channels include the Red River Floodway that protects the City of Winnipeg (Canada) and the Manggahan Floodway that protects the City of Manila (Philippines). = Floodplains and groundwater replenishment = Excess water can be used for groundwater replenishment by diversion onto land that can absorb the water. This technique can reduce the impact of later droughts by using the ground as a natural reservoir. It is being used in California, where orchards and vineyards can be flooded without damaging crops, or in other places wilderness areas have been re-engineered to act as floodplains. = River defences = In many countries, rivers are prone to floods and are often carefully managed. Defenses such as levees, bunds, reservoirs, and weirs are used to prevent rivers from bursting their banks. A weir, also known as a lowhead dam, is most often used to create millponds, but on the Humber River in Toronto, a weir was built near Raymore Drive to prevent a recurrence of the flood damage caused by Hurricane Hazel in October 1954. The Leeds flood alleviation scheme uses movable weirs which are lowered during periods of high water to reduce the chances of flooding upstream. Two such weirs, the first in the UK, were installed on the River Aire in October 2017 at Crown Point, Leeds city centre and Knostrop. The Knostrop weir was operated during the 2019 England floods. They are designed to reduce potential flood levels by up to one metre. = Coastal defenses = Coastal flooding has been addressed with coastal defences, such as sea walls, beach nourishment, and barrier islands. Tide gates are used in conjunction with dykes and culverts. They can be placed at the mouth of streams or small rivers, where an estuary begins or where tributary streams, or drainage ditches connect to sloughs. Tide gates close during incoming tides to prevent tidal waters from moving upland, and open during outgoing tides to allow waters to drain out via the culvert and into the estuary side of the dike. The opening and closing of the gates is driven by a difference in water level on either side of the gate. Living Breakwaters Case Study The Living Breakwaters initiative is the result of an Obama-era competition for innovative designs to prevent further flooding in coastal communities during harsh weather conditions. In October 2012, Hurricane Sandy hit the east coast of the United States causing more than $65 billion in damages and economic loss. One of the areas that got hit hardest was Staten Island's South Shore where the beach community of Tottenville saw sixteen-foot waves that destroyed homes and killed two residents (Dejean). In response to the devastation, the Department of Housing and Urban Development created the Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force to develop “implementable solutions to the region's most complex needs (Hurricane Sandy Design Competition).” Shortly after its formation, the task force introduced Rebuild by Design, a competition that promised a total of $920 million from the Community Block Disaster Recovery program for the winners to implement their plans (Tottenville Shoreline Protection Project). Ten teams submitted designs and six of them were eventually awarded funding for their respective projects. One winning design was the Living Breakwaters initiative proposed by landscape architect Kate Orff. Her firm, SCAPE, envisioned what Orff describes as a “living piece of infrastructure” including a barrier that protrudes from the water and houses an oyster reef (Dejean). SCAPE's green infrastructure solution will be implemented in three stages beginning in Tottenville, subsequently expanding to the surrounding areas, and to be completed in 2021 (Melcher). The plan aims to protect the South Shore of Staten Island from future storm damage, employing oysters to purify the water and restore the coastline. They claim that the breakwaters will protect the coastline from the intense storm conditions caused by climate change and the wave protection will reduce erosion which has greatly contributed to habitat loss in the area (Dejean). The living breakwaters, however, are not going to exist in an isolated system. SCAPE's design is a part of a layered approach that includes partnerships with the Billion Oyster Project and the Tottenville Shoreline Protection Project, a separately funded project to build similar shoreline protection structures. In addition, part of the Living Breakwaters project's funding is allocated for establishing a “learning hub” to inform local communities about the benefits of oysters and protecting the shoreline ecosystem (Hurricane Sandy Design Competition). This information hopes to encourage residents of Tottenville the surrounding areas to practice sustainable habits, prevent pollution, and continue to engage with the project in the future. National Sea Grant College Program, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR. Product No. ORESU-G-04-002. = Self-closing flood barrier = The self-closing flood barrier (SCFB) is a flood defense system designed to protect people and property from inland waterway floods caused by heavy rainfall, gales or rapid melting snow. The SCFB can be built to protect residential properties and whole communities, as well as industrial or other strategic areas. The barrier system is constantly ready to deploy in a flood situation, it can be installed in any length and uses the rising flood water to deploy. = Temporary perimeter barriers = When permanent defenses fail, emergency measures such as sandbags or inflatable impermeable sacks are used. In 1988, a method of using water to control flooding was discovered. This was accomplished by containing 2 parallel tubes within a third outer tube. When filled, this structure formed a non-rolling wall of water that can control 80 percent of its height in external water depth, with dry ground behind it. Eight foot tall water filled barriers were used to surround Fort Calhoun Nuclear Generating Station during the 2011 Missouri River Flooding. Instead of trucking in sandbag material for a flood, stacking it, then trucking it out to a hazmat disposal site, flood control can be accomplished by using the on site water. However, these are not fool proof. A high long water filled rubber flood berm that surrounded portions of the plant was punctured by a skid-steer loader and it collapsed flooding a portion of the facility. In 1999, a group of Norwegian engineers patented a transportable, removable, and reusable flood barrier which uses the water's weight against itself. This removable flood panels protect cities and public utilities. Other solutions, such as HydroSack, are polypropylene exteriors with wood pulp within, though they are one-time use. Hazard reductionStrategic retreat= One way of reducing the damage caused by flooding is to remove buildings from flood-prone areas, leaving them as parks or returning them to wilderness. Floodplain buyout programs have been operated in places like New Jersey (both before and after Hurricane Sandy), Charlotte, North Carolina, and Missouri. In the United States, FEMA produces flood insurance rate maps that identify areas of future risk, enabling local governments to apply zoning regulations to prevent or minimize property damage. =Resilience= Buildings and other urban infrastructure can be designed so that even if a flood does happen, the city can recover quickly and costs are minimized. For example, homes can be put on stilts, electrical and HVAC equipment can be put on the roof instead of in the basement, and subway entrances and tunnels can have built-in movable water barriers. New York City began a substantial effort to plan and build for flood resilience after Hurricane Sandy.  Flood control by continent  North America = An elaborate system of flood way defenses can be found in the Canadian province of Manitoba. The Red River flows northward from the United States, passing through the city of Winnipeg (where it meets the Assiniboine River) and into Lake Winnipeg. As is the case with all north-flowing rivers in the temperate zone of the Northern Hemisphere, snow melt in southern sections may cause river levels to rise before northern sections have had a chance to completely thaw. This can lead to devastating flooding, as occurred in Winnipeg during the spring of 1950. To protect the city from future floods, the Manitoba government undertook the construction of a massive system of diversions, dikes, and flood ways (including the Red River Floodway and the Portage Diversion). The system kept Winnipeg safe during the 1997 flood which devastated many communities upriver from Winnipeg, including Grand Forks, North Dakota and Ste. Agathe, Manitoba. In the United States, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is the lead flood control agency.U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Washington, DC.\\"Civil Works.\\" Accessed 2014-01-24. After Hurricane Sandy, New York City's Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) initiated multiple flood barrier projects to protect the transit assets in Manhattan. In one case, the MTA's New York City Transit Authority (NYCT) sealed subway entrances in lower Manhattan using a deployable fabric cover system called Flex-Gate, a system that protects the subway entrances against of water. Extreme storm flood protection levels have been revised based on new Federal Emergency Management Agency guidelines for 100-year and 500-year design flood elevations. In the New Orleans Metropolitan Area, 35 percent of which sits below sea level, is protected by hundreds of miles of levees and flood gates. This system failed catastrophically, with numerous breaks, during Hurricane Katrina (2005) in the city proper and in eastern sections of the Metro Area, resulting in the inundation of approximately 50 percent of the metropolitan area, ranging from a few inches to twenty feet in coastal communities. The Morganza Spillway provides a method of diverting water from the Mississippi River when a river flood threatens New Orleans, Baton Rouge and other major cities on the lower Mississippi. It is the largest of a system of spillways and floodways along the Mississippi. Completed in 1954, the spillway has been opened twice, in 1973 and in 2011. In an act of successful flood prevention, the federal government offered to buy out flood-prone properties in the United States in order to prevent repeated disasters after the 1993 flood across the Midwest. Several communities accepted and the government, in partnership with the state, bought 25,000 properties which they converted into wetlands. These wetlands act as a sponge in storms and in 1995, when the floods returned, the government did not have to expend resources in those areas.Ripley, Amanda (2006-08-28). \\"Floods, Tornadoes, Hurricanes, Wildfires, Earthquakes... Why We Don't Prepare.\\" Time. = Asia = In Kyoto, Japan, the Hata clan successfully controlled floods on the Katsura River in around 500 A.D and also constructed a sluice on the Kazuno River. In China flood diversion areas are rural areas that are deliberately flooded in emergencies in order to protect cities.\\"China blows up seventh dike to divert flooding.\\" China Daily. 2003-07-07. The consequences of deforestation and changing land use on the risk and severity of flooding are subjects of discussion. In assessing the impacts of Himalayan deforestation on the Ganges-Brahmaputra Lowlands, it was found that forests would not have prevented or significantly reduced flooding in the case of an extreme weather event. However, more general or overview studies agree on the negative impacts that deforestation has on flood safety - and the positive effects of wise land use and reforestation. Many have proposed that loss of vegetation (deforestation) will lead to an increased risk of flooding. With natural forest cover the flood duration should decrease. Reducing the rate of deforestation should improve the incidents and severity of floods. =Africa= In Egypt, both the Aswan Low Dam (1902) and the Aswan High Dam (1976) have controlled various amounts of flooding along the Nile River. =Europe= Flood blocking the road in Jerusalem Following the misery and destruction caused by the 1910 Great Flood of Paris, the French government built a series of reservoirs called Les Grands Lacs de Seine (or Great Lakes) which helps remove pressure from the Seine during floods, especially the regular winter flooding.See Jeffrey H. Jackson, Paris Under Water: How the City of Light Survived the Great Flood of 1910 (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2010). London is protected from flooding by a huge mechanical barrier across the River Thames, which is raised when the water level reaches a certain point (see: Thames Barrier). Venice has a similar arrangement, although it is already unable to cope with very high tides. The defenses of both London and Venice will be rendered inadequate if sea levels continue to rise. The largest and most elaborate flood defenses can be found in the Netherlands, where they are referred to as Delta Works with the Oosterschelde dam as its crowning achievement. These works were built in response to the North Sea flood of 1953, in the southwestern part of the Netherlands. The Dutch had already built one of the world's largest dams in the north of the country. The Afsluitdijk closing occurred in 1932. The Saint Petersburg Flood Prevention Facility Complex was completed in 2008, in Russia, to protect Saint Petersburg from storm surges. It also has a main traffic function, as it completes a ring road around Saint Petersburg. Eleven dams extend for and stand above water level.  Flood clean-up safety  Clean-up activities following floods often pose hazards to workers and volunteers involved in the effort. Potential dangers include electrical hazards, carbon monoxide exposure, musculoskeletal hazards, heat or cold stress, motor vehicle-related dangers, fire, drowning, and exposure to hazardous materials. Because flooded disaster sites are unstable, clean-up workers might encounter sharp jagged debris, biological hazards in the flood water, exposed electrical lines, blood or other body fluids, and animal and human remains. In planning for and reacting to flood disasters, managers provide workers with hard hats, goggles, heavy work gloves, life jackets, and watertight boots with steel toes and insoles.National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Washington, DC (2013). \\"Storm/Flood and Hurricane/Typhoon Response.\\" Emergency Response Resources.  Development of technology  Europe is at the forefront of the flood control technology, with low-lying countries such as the Netherlands and Belgium developing techniques that can serve as examples to other countries facing similar problems and other countries which may soon face these problems.Woodard, Colin (2001-09-04). \\"Netherlands Battens Its Ramparts Against Warming Climate.\\" Christian Science Monitor. After Hurricane Katrina, the US state of Louisiana sent politicians to the Netherlands to take a tour of the complex and highly developed flood control system in place in the Netherlands. With a BBC article quoting experts as saying 70 percent more people will live in delta cities by 2050, the number of people impacted by a rise in sea level will greatly increase. The Netherlands has one of the best flood control systems in the world and new ways to deal with water are constantly being developed and tested, such as the underground storage of water, storing water in reservoirs in large parking garages or on playgrounds,http://water.dhv.com/EN/Water_management/Documents/2008%20Leaflet%20Innovative%20water%20storage%20techniques.pdf Rotterdam started a project to construct a floating housing development of to deal with rising sea levels. Palca, Joe (2008-01-28). \\"Dutch Architects Plan for a Floating Future.\\" National Public Radio, Washington, DC. Several approaches, from high-tech sensors detecting imminent levee failure to movable semi-circular structures closing an entire river, are being developed or used around the world. Regular maintenance of hydraulic structures, however, is another crucial part of flood control.

Val PollardCarl KingJimmy KingTom KingNoah Dingle Noah Christopher Dingle (also Christopher Francis Tate Jnr, Noah Tate, Noah Sharma, and Noah Macey) is the son of Charity (Emma Atkins) and Chris Tate (Peter Amory). He appeared from March 2004 to 2005 and returned in October 2009 along with Charity. Noah was born while Charity was serving a life sentence for Chris' murder, even though Chris had actually committed suicide. Noah's paternity was doubtful as Charity had recently slept with her cousins, Cain (Jeff Hordley) and Marlon Dingle (Mark Charnock), as well as Chris, but DNA tests confirmed Noah was Chris' son. Charity, knowing she could not keep Noah with her in prison, sold him to Chris' sister Zoe Tate (Leah Bracknell), who called him Christopher after Chris. In return for this, Zoe tells the court that Chris framed Charity for murder and she is freed. The courts, however, do not allow Zoe to adopt Noah, due to her current workload, other family commitments and mental illness, so Charity takes him back and leaves the village in 2005. In October 2009, Charity and Noah return to the village when Charity discovers that her fiancé, Michael, has been having an affair with her daughter, Debbie Dingle (Charley Webb). After the wedding is called off, Charity and Noah move in with Debbie and her daughter, Sarah Sugden (Sophia Amber Moore). Charity sends Noah to the local primary school as he is too old to go to playgroup with Sarah. Noah believes that Michael was his father, so he was crushed to discover that Chris was dead. Charity raises Noah's hopes by getting engaged to Cain. Noah asks Cain to be his father and Cain, becoming tearful, tells Noah that he will always be there for him. Noah is thrilled, and is pleased to be living with Charity, Cain, Debbie and Sarah. Noah lives happily in Tug Ghyll up until early 2011 when Cain gets paranoid about Charity and Jai Sharma (Chris Bisson) apparently having an affair. Charity is devastated when Cain sleeps with Faye Lamb (Kim Thomson); she realises that there is a spark between her and Jai, and moves into Holdgate Farm with Jai, Noah and the Sharma family. Noah begins to miss Cain and is devastated when Cain gets attacked by his father Zak Dingle (Steve Halliwell). Noah is later crushed when Charity announces her engagement to Jai. Noah begins to warm to Jai, and tells him that he \\"doesn't mind\\" him marrying Charity, as long as he doesn't have to call him his father, like he did with Michael and Cain. Secretly, Noah does not think that the wedding will ever happen, so he is shocked when Charity marries Jai in 2012. In October that year, Jai declared that he wants children, but Charity says two is enough, as Jai has gained Debbie and Noah, and has become a step- grandfather to Sarah.

Design and development Designed by the Società Idrovolanti Alta Italia (SIAI) as a smaller version of the earlier S.12, the S.13 was a single-engined biplane reconnaissance-fighter flying boat. It had a crew of two in side-by-side seats behind a single windscreen; the observer had a single trainably-mounted machine-gun. The flying boat was powered by a single 250 hp (187 kW) Isotta Fraschini V6 engine. Emile Taddéoli, a Swiss flight pioneer and later chief pilot of the Ad Astra Aero, left Switzerland for Sesto Calende where he was hired as test pilot for Savoia in mid-1914. During the next five years of activity, Taddéoli made more than 2,700 flight tests, flying about . In January 1919 Emile Taddéoli was pioneering again in crossing the Apennine Mountains in a seaplane between Sesto Calende and San Remo. On 12 July 1919, with a passenger on board, he flew from Calende on Lago Maggiore to Lake Geneva in 110 minutes, overflying the Mont Blanc () massif in his SIAI S.13. The Royal Italian Navy took delivery of 12 aircraft in 1919, and the flying boat was exported to Japan, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and Yugoslavia. In France, the S.13 was built under license as the CAMS C.13 and the Spanish naval workshops in Barcelona also built seven under licence. A single-seat version, the S.13 Tipo, was ordered by the Royal Italian Navy, but was later cancelled when the Royal Navy decided to develop the Macchi M.7 instead and a civilian version, the S.13bis, failed to attract any orders.

Considered as a genre of poetry in general, the dramatic mode has been contrasted with the epic and the lyrical modes ever since Aristotle's Poetics (c. 335 BC)—the earliest work of dramatic theory.Francis Fergusson writes that \\"a drama, as distinguished from a lyric, is not primarily a composition in the verbal medium; the words result, as one might put it, from the underlying structure of incident and character. As Aristotle remarks, 'the poet, or \\"maker\\" should be the maker of plots rather than of verses; since he is a poet because he imitates, and what he imitates are actions'\\" (1949, 8). The term \\"drama\\" comes from a Greek word meaning \\"action\\" (Classical Greek: , drama), which is derived from \\"I do\\" (Classical Greek: , drao). The two masks associated with drama represent the traditional generic division between comedy and tragedy. In English (as was the analogous case in many other European languages), the word play or game (translating the Anglo-Saxon pleġan or Latin ludus) was the standard term for dramas until William Shakespeare's time—just as its creator was a play-maker rather than a dramatist and the building was a play-house rather than a theatre.Wickham (1959, 32—41; 1969, 133; 1981, 68—69). The sense of the creator of plays as a \\"maker\\" rather than a \\"writer\\" is preserved in the word playwright. The Theatre, one of the first purpose-built playhouses in London, was an intentional reference to the Latin term for that particular playhouse, rather than a term for the buildings in general (1967, 133). The word 'dramatist' \\"was at that time still unknown in the English language\\" (1981, 68). The use of \\"drama\\" in a more narrow sense to designate a specific type of play dates from the modern era. \\"Drama\\" in this sense refers to a play that is neither a comedy nor a tragedy—for example, Zola's Thérèse Raquin (1873) or Chekhov's Ivanov (1887). It is this narrower sense that the film and television industries, along with film studies, adopted to describe \\"drama\\" as a genre within their respective media. The term ”radio drama“ has been used in both senses—originally transmitted in a live performance. May also refer to the more high-brow and serious end of the dramatic output of radio.Banham (1998, 894–900). The enactment of drama in theatre, performed by actors on a stage before an audience, presupposes collaborative modes of production and a collective form of reception. The structure of dramatic texts, unlike other forms of literature, is directly influenced by this collaborative production and collective reception.Pfister (1977, 11). Mime is a form of drama where the action of a story is told only through the movement of the body. Drama can be combined with music: the dramatic text in opera is generally sung throughout; as for in some ballets dance \\"expresses or imitates emotion, character, and narrative action\\".Encyclopaedia Britannica Musicals include both spoken dialogue and songs; and some forms of drama have incidental music or musical accompaniment underscoring the dialogue (melodrama and Japanese Nō, for example).See the entries for \\"opera\\", \\"musical theatre, American\\", \\"melodrama\\" and \\"Nō\\" in Banham (1998). Closet drama is a form that is intended to be read, rather than performed.Manfred by Byron, for example, is a good example of a \\"dramatic poem.\\" See the entry on \\"Byron (George George)\\" in Banham (1998). In improvisation, the drama does not pre-exist the moment of performance; performers devise a dramatic script spontaneously before an audience.Some forms of improvisation, notably the Commedia dell'arte, improvise on the basis of 'lazzi' or rough outlines of scenic action (see Gordon (1983) and Duchartre (1929)). All forms of improvisation take their cue from their immediate response to one another, their characters' situations (which are sometimes established in advance), and, often, their interaction with the audience. The classic formulations of improvisation in the theatre originated with Joan Littlewood and Keith Johnstone in the UK and Viola Spolin in the USA; see Johnstone (1981) and Spolin (1963). History of Western dramaClassical Greek drama= Relief of a seated poet (Menander) with masks of New Comedy, 1st century BC – early 1st century AD, Princeton University Art Museum Western drama originates in classical Greece.Brown (1998, 441), Cartledge (1997, 3–5), Goldhill (1997, 54), and Ley (2007, 206). Taxidou notes that \\"most scholars now call 'Greek' tragedy 'Athenian' tragedy, which is historically correct\\" (2004, 104). Brown writes that ancient Greek drama \\"was essentially the creation of classical Athens: all the dramatists who were later regarded as classics were active at Athens in the 5th and 4th centuries BC (the time of the Athenian democracy), and all the surviving plays date from this period\\" (1998, 441). \\"The dominant culture of Athens in the fifth century\\", Goldhill writes, \\"can be said to have invented theatre\\" (1997, 54). The theatrical culture of the city-state of Athens produced three genres of drama: tragedy, comedy, and the satyr play. Their origins remain obscure, though by the 5th century BC, they were institutionalised in competitions held as part of festivities celebrating the god Dionysus.Brockett and Hildy (2003, 13–15) and Banham (1998, 441–447). Historians know the names of many ancient Greek dramatists, not least Thespis, who is credited with the innovation of an actor (\\"hypokrites\\") who speaks (rather than sings) and impersonates a character (rather than speaking in his own person), while interacting with the chorus and its leader (\\"coryphaeus\\"), who were a traditional part of the performance of non-dramatic poetry (dithyrambic, lyric and epic).Banham (1998, 441–444). For more information on these ancient Greek dramatists, see the articles categorised under \\"Ancient Greek dramatists and playwrights\\" in Wikipedia. Only a small fraction of the work of five dramatists, however, has survived to this day: we have a small number of complete texts by the tragedians Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides, and the comic writers Aristophanes and, from the late 4th century, Menander.The theory that Prometheus Bound was not written by Aeschylus would bring this number to six dramatists whose work survives. Aeschylus' historical tragedy The Persians is the oldest surviving drama, although when it won first prize at the City Dionysia competition in 472 BC, he had been writing plays for more than 25 years.Banham (1998, 8) and Brockett and Hildy (2003, 15–16). The competition (\\"agon\\") for tragedies may have begun as early as 534 BC; official records (\\"didaskaliai\\") begin from 501 BC when the satyr play was introduced.Brockett and Hildy (2003, 13, 15) and Banham (1998, 442). Tragic dramatists were required to present a tetralogy of plays (though the individual works were not necessarily connected by story or theme), which usually consisted of three tragedies and one satyr play (though exceptions were made, as with Euripides' Alcestis in 438 BC). Comedy was officially recognized with a prize in the competition from 487 to 486 BC. Five comic dramatists competed at the City Dionysia (though during the Peloponnesian War this may have been reduced to three), each offering a single comedy.Brockett and Hildy (2003, 18) and Banham (1998, 444–445). Ancient Greek comedy is traditionally divided between \\"old comedy\\" (5th century BC), \\"middle comedy\\" (4th century BC) and \\"new comedy\\" (late 4th century to 2nd BC).Banham (1998, 444–445). =Classical Roman drama= An ivory statuette of a Roman actor of tragedy, 1st century CE. Following the expansion of the Roman Republic (509–27 BC) into several Greek territories between 270–240 BC, Rome encountered Greek drama.Brockett and Hildy (2003, 43). From the later years of the republic and by means of the Roman Empire (27 BC-476 AD), theatre spread west across Europe, around the Mediterranean and reached England; Roman theatre was more varied, extensive and sophisticated than that of any culture before it.Brockett and Hildy (2003, 36, 47). While Greek drama continued to be performed throughout the Roman period, the year 240 BC marks the beginning of regular Roman drama.Brockett and Hildy (2003, 43). For more information on the ancient Roman dramatists, see the articles categorised under \\"Ancient Roman dramatists and playwrights\\" in Wikipedia. From the beginning of the empire, however, interest in full-length drama declined in favour of a broader variety of theatrical entertainments.Brockett and Hildy (2003, 46–47). The first important works of Roman literature were the tragedies and comedies that Livius Andronicus wrote from 240 BC.Brockett and Hildy (2003, 47). Five years later, Gnaeus Naevius also began to write drama. No plays from either writer have survived. While both dramatists composed in both genres, Andronicus was most appreciated for his tragedies and Naevius for his comedies; their successors tended to specialise in one or the other, which led to a separation of the subsequent development of each type of drama. By the beginning of the 2nd century BC, drama was firmly established in Rome and a guild of writers (collegium poetarum) had been formed.Brockett and Hildy (2003, 47–48). The Roman comedies that have survived are all fabula palliata (comedies based on Greek subjects) and come from two dramatists: Titus Maccius Plautus (Plautus) and Publius Terentius Afer (Terence).Brockett and Hildy (2003, 48–49). In re- working the Greek originals, the Roman comic dramatists abolished the role of the chorus in dividing the drama into episodes and introduced musical accompaniment to its dialogue (between one-third of the dialogue in the comedies of Plautus and two-thirds in those of Terence).Brockett and Hildy (2003, 49). The action of all scenes is set in the exterior location of a street and its complications often follow from eavesdropping. Plautus, the more popular of the two, wrote between 205 and 184 BC and twenty of his comedies survive, of which his farces are best known; he was admired for the wit of his dialogue and his use of a variety of poetic meters.Brockett and Hildy (2003, 48). All of the six comedies that Terence wrote between 166 and 160 BC have survived; the complexity of his plots, in which he often combined several Greek originals, was sometimes denounced, but his double-plots enabled a sophisticated presentation of contrasting human behaviour. No early Roman tragedy survives, though it was highly regarded in its day; historians know of three early tragedians—Quintus Ennius, Marcus Pacuvius, and Lucius Accius. From the time of the empire, the work of two tragedians survives—one is an unknown author, while the other is the Stoic philosopher Seneca.Brockett and Hildy (2003, 50). Nine of Seneca's tragedies survive, all of which are fabula crepidata (tragedies adapted from Greek originals); his Phaedra, for example, was based on Euripides' Hippolytus.Brockett and Hildy (2003, 49–50). Historians do not know who wrote the only extant example of the fabula praetexta (tragedies based on Roman subjects), Octavia, but in former times it was mistakenly attributed to Seneca due to his appearance as a character in the tragedy. =Medieval= Stage drawing from a 15th-century vernacular morality play The Castle of Perseverance (as found in the Macro Manuscript). Beginning in the early Middle Ages, churches staged dramatised versions of biblical events, known as liturgical dramas, to enliven annual celebrations.Brockett and Hildy (2003, 76, 78). Many churches would have only performed one or two liturgical dramas per year and a larger number never performed any at all. The earliest example is the Easter trope Whom do you Seek? (Quem-Quaeritis) (c. 925).Brockett and Hildy (2003, 76). Two groups would sing responsively in Latin, though no impersonation of characters was involved. By the 11th century, it had spread through Europe to Russia, Scandinavia, and Italy; excluding Islamic-era Spain. In the 10th century, Hrosvitha wrote six plays in Latin modeled on Terence's comedies, but which treated religious subjects.Brockett and Hildy (2003, 77). Her plays are the first known to be composed by a female dramatist and the first identifiable Western drama of the post-Classical era. Later, Hildegard of Bingen wrote a musical drama, Ordo Virtutum (c. 1155). One of the most famous of the early secular plays is the courtly pastoral Robin and Marion, written in the 13th century in French by Adam de la Halle.Wickham (1981, 191; 1987, 141). The Interlude of the Student and the Girl (c. 1300), one of the earliest known in English, seems to be the closest in tone and form to the contemporaneous French farces, such as The Boy and the Blind Man.Bevington (1962, 9, 11, 38, 45), Dillon (2006, 213), and Wickham (1976, 195; 1981, 189–190). In Early English Stages (1981), Wickham points to the existence of The Interlude of the Student and the Girl as evidence that the old-fashioned view that comedy began in England in the 1550s with Gammer Gurton's Needle and Ralph Roister Doister is mistaken, ignoring as it does a rich tradition of medieval comic drama; see Wickham (1981, 178). Many plays survive from France and Germany in the late Middle Ages, when some type of religious drama was performed in nearly every European country. Many of these plays contained comedy, devils, villains, and clowns.Brockett and Hildy (2003, 86) In England, trade guilds began to perform vernacular \\"mystery plays,\\" which were composed of long cycles of many playlets or \\"pageants,\\" of which four are extant: York (48 plays), Chester (24), Wakefield (32) and the so-called \\"N-Town\\" (42). The Second Shepherds' Play from the Wakefield cycle is a farcical story of a stolen sheep that its protagonist, Mak, tries to pass off as his new-born child asleep in a crib; it ends when the shepherds from whom he has stolen are summoned to the Nativity of Jesus.Brockett and Hildy (2003, 97). Morality plays (a modern term) emerged as a distinct dramatic form around 1400 and flourished in the early Elizabethan era in England. Characters were often used to represent different ethical ideals. Everyman, for example, includes such figures as Good Deeds, Knowledge and Strength, and this characterisation reinforces the conflict between good and evil for the audience. The Castle of Perseverance (c. 1400—1425) depicts an archetypal figure's progress from birth through to death. Horestes (c. 1567), a late \\"hybrid morality\\" and one of the earliest examples of an English revenge play, brings together the classical story of Orestes with a Vice from the medieval allegorical tradition, alternating comic, slapstick scenes with serious, tragic ones.Spivack (1958, 251-303), Bevington (1962, 58-61, 81-82, 87, 183), and Weimann (1978, 155). Also important in this period were the folk dramas of the Mummers Play, performed during the Christmas season. Court masques were particularly popular during the reign of Henry VIII.Brockett and Hildy (2003, 101-103). =Elizabethan and Jacobean= One of the great flowerings of drama in England occurred in the 16th and 17th centuries. Many of these plays were written in verse, particularly iambic pentameter. In addition to Shakespeare, such authors as Christopher Marlowe, Thomas Middleton, and Ben Jonson were prominent playwrights during this period. As in the medieval period, historical plays celebrated the lives of past kings, enhancing the image of the Tudor monarchy. Authors of this period drew some of their storylines from Greek mythology and Roman mythology or from the plays of eminent Roman playwrights such as Plautus and Terence. =English Restoration comedy= Colley Cibber as the extravagant and affected Lord Foppington, \\"brutal, evil, and smart\\", in Vanbrugh's The Relapse (1696). Restoration comedy refers to English comedies written and performed in England during the Restoration period from 1660 to 1710. Comedy of manners is used as a synonym of Restoration comedy.George Henry Nettleton, Arthur British dramatists from Dryden to Sheridan p.149 After public theatre had been banned by the Puritan regime, the re-opening of the theatres in 1660 with the Restoration of Charles II signalled a renaissance of English drama. Restoration comedy is known for its sexual explicitness, urbane, cosmopolitan wit, up-to-the-minute topical writing, and crowded and bustling plots. Its dramatists stole freely from the contemporary French and Spanish stage, from English Jacobean and Caroline plays, and even from Greek and Roman classical comedies, combining the various plotlines in adventurous ways. Resulting differences of tone in a single play were appreciated rather than frowned on, as the audience prized \\"variety\\" within as well as between plays. Restoration comedy peaked twice. The genre came to spectacular maturity in the mid-1670s with an extravaganza of aristocratic comedies. Twenty lean years followed this short golden age, although the achievement of the first professional female playwright, Aphra Behn, in the 1680s is an important exception. In the mid-1690s, a brief second Restoration comedy renaissance arose, aimed at a wider audience. The comedies of the golden 1670s and 1690s peak times are significantly different from each other. The unsentimental or \\"hard\\" comedies of John Dryden, William Wycherley, and George Etherege reflected the atmosphere at Court and celebrated with frankness an aristocratic macho lifestyle of unremitting sexual intrigue and conquest. The Earl of Rochester, real-life Restoration rake, courtier and poet, is flatteringly portrayed in Etherege's The Man of Mode (1676) as a riotous, witty, intellectual, and sexually irresistible aristocrat, a template for posterity's idea of the glamorous Restoration rake (actually never a very common character in Restoration comedy). The single play that does most to support the charge of obscenity levelled then and now at Restoration comedy is probably Wycherley's masterpiece The Country Wife (1675), whose title contains a lewd pun and whose notorious \\"china scene\\" is a series of sustained double entendres. During the second wave of Restoration comedy in the 1690s, the \\"softer\\" comedies of William Congreve and John Vanbrugh set out to appeal to more socially diverse audience with a strong middle-class element, as well as to female spectators. The comic focus shifts from young lovers outwitting the older generation to the vicissitudes of marital relations. In Congreve's Love for Love (1695) and The Way of the World (1700), the give-and-take set pieces of couples testing their attraction for one another have mutated into witty prenuptial debates on the eve of marriage, as in the latter's famous \\"Proviso\\" scene. Vanbrugh's The Provoked Wife (1697) has a light touch and more humanly recognisable characters, while The Relapse (1696) has been admired for its throwaway wit and the characterisation of Lord Foppington, an extravagant and affected burlesque fop with a dark side.The Provoked Wife is something of a Restoration problem play in its attention to the subordinate legal position of married women and the complexities of \\"divorce\\" and separation, issues that had been highlighted in the mid-1690s by some notorious cases before the House of Lords. The tolerance for Restoration comedy even in its modified form was running out by the end of the 17th century, as public opinion turned to respectability and seriousness even faster than the playwrights did.Interconnected causes for this shift in taste were demographic change, the Glorious Revolution of 1688, William's and Mary's dislike of the theatre, and the lawsuits brought against playwrights by the Society for the Reformation of Manners (founded in 1692). When Jeremy Collier attacked Congreve and Vanbrugh in his Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the English Stage in 1698, he was confirming a shift in audience taste that had already taken place. At the much-anticipated all-star première in 1700 of The Way of the World, Congreve's first comedy for five years, the audience showed only moderate enthusiasm for that subtle and almost melancholy work. The comedy of sex and wit was about to be replaced by sentimental comedy and the drama of exemplary morality. =Modern and postmodern= The pivotal and innovative contributions of the 19th-century Norwegian dramatist Henrik Ibsen and the 20th-century German theatre practitioner Bertolt Brecht dominate modern drama; each inspired a tradition of imitators, which include many of the greatest playwrights of the modern era.Williams (1993, 25–26) and Moi (2006, 17). Moi writes that \\"Ibsen is the most important playwright writing after Shakespeare. He is the founder of modern theater. His plays are world classics, staged on every continent, and studied in classrooms everywhere. In any given year, there are hundreds of Ibsen productions in the world.\\" Ibsenites include George Bernard Shaw and Arthur Miller; Brechtians include Dario Fo, Joan Littlewood, W. H. Auden Peter Weiss, Heiner Müller, Peter Hacks, Tony Kushner, Caryl Churchill, John Arden, Howard Brenton, Edward Bond, and David Hare. The works of both playwrights are, in their different ways, both modernist and realist, incorporating formal experimentation, meta-theatricality, and social critique.Moi (2006, 1, 23–26). Taxidou writes: \\"It is probably historically more accurate, although methodologically less satisfactory, to read the Naturalist movement in the theatre in conjunction with the more anti- illusionist aesthetics of the theatres of the same period. These interlock and overlap in all sorts of complicated ways, even when they are vehemently denouncing each other (perhaps particularly when) in the favoured mode of the time, the manifesto\\" (2007, 58). In terms of the traditional theoretical discourse of genre, Ibsen's work has been described as the culmination of \\"liberal tragedy\\", while Brecht's has been aligned with an historicised comedy.Williams (1966) and Wright (1989). Other important playwrights of the modern era include Antonin Artaud, August Strindberg, Anton Chekhov, Frank Wedekind, Maurice Maeterlinck, Federico García Lorca, Eugene O'Neill, Luigi Pirandello, George Bernard Shaw, Ernst Toller, Vladimir Mayakovsky, Arthur Miller, Tennessee Williams, Jean Genet, Eugène Ionesco, Samuel Beckett, Harold Pinter, Friedrich Dürrenmatt, Dario Fo, Heiner Müller, and Caryl Churchill.  Opera  Western opera is a dramatic art form that arose during the Renaissance in an attempt to revive the classical Greek drama in which dialogue, dance, and song were combined. Being strongly intertwined with western classical music, the opera has undergone enormous changes in the past four centuries and it is an important form of theatre until this day. Noteworthy is the major influence of the German 19th-century composer Richard Wagner on the opera tradition. In his view, there was no proper balance between music and theatre in the operas of his time, because the music seemed to be more important than the dramatic aspects in these works. To restore the connection with the classical drama, he entirely renewed the operatic form to emphasize the equal importance of music and drama in works that he called \\"music dramas\\". Chinese opera has seen a more conservative development over a somewhat longer period of time.  Pantomime  Pantomime (informally panto),Lawner, p. 16 is a type of musical comedy stage production, designed for family entertainment. It was developed in England and is still performed throughout the United Kingdom, generally during the Christmas and New Year season and, to a lesser extent, in other English-speaking countries. Modern pantomime includes songs, gags, slapstick comedy and dancing, employs gender- crossing actors, and combines topical humour with a story loosely based on a well-known fairy tale, fable or folk tale.Reid-Walsh, Jacqueline. \\"Pantomime\\", The Oxford Encyclopedia of Children's Literature, Jack Zipes (ed.), Oxford University Press (2006), Mayer (1969), p. 6 It is a participatory form of theatre, in which the audience is expected to sing along with certain parts of the music and shout out phrases to the performers. These stories follow in the tradition of fables and folk tales. Usually, there is a lesson learned, and with some help from the audience, the hero/heroine saves the day. This kind of play uses stock characters seen in masque and again commedia dell'arte, these characters include the villain (doctore), the clown/servant (Arlechino/Harlequin/buttons), the lovers etc. These plays usually have an emphasis on moral dilemmas, and good always triumphs over evil, this kind of play is also very entertaining making it a very effective way of reaching many people. Pantomime has a long theatrical history in Western culture dating back to classical theatre. It developed partly from the 16th century commedia dell'arte tradition of Italy, as well as other European and British stage traditions, such as 17th-century masques and music hall. An important part of the pantomime, until the late 19th century, was the harlequinade.\\"The History of Pantomime\\", It's-Behind-You.com, 2002, accessed 10 February 2013 Outside Britain the word \\"pantomime\\" is usually used to mean miming, rather than the theatrical form discussed here.Webster's New World Dictionary, World Publishing Company, 2nd College Edition, 1980, p. 1027 Mime Mime is a theatrical medium where the action of a story is told through the movement of the body, without the use of speech. Performance of mime occurred in Ancient Greece, and the word is taken from a single masked dancer called Pantomimus, although their performances were not necessarily silent.Gutzwiller (2007). In Medieval Europe, early forms of mime, such as mummer plays and later dumbshows, evolved. In the early nineteenth century Paris, Jean-Gaspard Deburau solidified the many attributes that we have come to know in modern times, including the silent figure in whiteface.Rémy (1954). Jacques Copeau, strongly influenced by Commedia dell'arte and Japanese Noh theatre, used masks in the training of his actors. Étienne Decroux, a pupil of his, was highly influenced by this and started exploring and developing the possibilities of mime and refined corporeal mime into a highly sculptural form, taking it outside of the realms of naturalism. Jacques Lecoq contributed significantly to the development of mime and physical theatre with his training methods.Callery (2001). Ballet While some ballet emphasises \\"the lines and patterns of movement itself\\" dramatic dance \\"expresses or imitates emotion, character, and narrative action\\". Such ballets are theatrical works that have characters and \\"tell a story\\",Encyclopaedia Britannica Dance movements in ballet \\"are often closely related to everyday forms of physical expression, [so that] there is an expressive quality inherent in nearly all dancing\\", and this is used to convey both action and emotions; mime is also used. Examples include Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake, which tells the story of Odette, a princess turned into a swan by an evil sorcerer's curse, Sergei Prokofiev's ballet Romeo and Juliet, based on Shakespeare's famous play, and Igor Stravinsky's Petrushka, which tells the story of the loves and jealousies of three puppets.  Creative drama  Creative drama includes dramatic activities and games used primarily in educational settings with children. Its roots in the United States began in the early 1900s. Winifred Ward is considered to be the founder of creative drama in education, establishing the first academic use of drama in Evanston, Illinois.Ehrlich (1974, 75–80). Asian dramaIndia= A scene from the drama Macbeth by Kalidasa Kalakendram in Kollam city, India Performer playing Sugriva in the Koodiyattam form of Sanskrit theatre. The earliest form of Indian drama was the Sanskrit drama.Richmond, Swann, and Zarrilli (1993, 12). Between the 1st century AD and the 10th was a period of relative peace in the history of India during which hundreds of plays were written.Brandon (1997, 70) and Richmond (1998, 516). With the Islamic conquests that began in the 10th and 11th centuries, theatre was discouraged or forbidden entirely.Brandon (1997, 72) and Richmond (1998, 516). Later, in an attempt to re-assert indigenous values and ideas, village theatre was encouraged across the subcontinent, developing in various regional languages from the 15th to the 19th centuries.Brandon (1997, 72), Richmond (1998, 516), and Richmond, Swann, and Zarrilli (1993, 12). Modern Indian theatre developed during the period of colonial rule under the British Empire, from the mid-19th century until the mid-20th.Richmond (1998, 516) and Richmond, Swann, and Zarrilli (1993, 13). Sanskrit theatre The earliest-surviving fragments of Sanskrit drama date from the 1st century AD.Brandon (1981, xvii) and Richmond (1998, 516–517). The wealth of archeological evidence from earlier periods offers no indication of the existence of a tradition of theatre.Richmond (1998, 516). The ancient Vedas (hymns from between 1500 and 1000 BC that are among the earliest examples of literature in the world) contain no hint of it (although a small number are composed in a form of dialogue) and the rituals of the Vedic period do not appear to have developed into theatre. The Mahābhāṣya by Patañjali contains the earliest reference to what may have been the seeds of Sanskrit drama.Richmond (1998, 517). This treatise on grammar from 140 BC provides a feasible date for the beginnings of theatre in India. The major source of evidence for Sanskrit theatre is A Treatise on Theatre (Nātyaśāstra), a compendium whose date of composition is uncertain (estimates range from 200 BC to 200 AD) and whose authorship is attributed to Bharata Muni. The Treatise is the most complete work of dramaturgy in the ancient world. It addresses acting, dance, music, dramatic construction, architecture, costuming, make-up, props, the organisation of companies, the audience, competitions, and offers a mythological account of the origin of theatre. Its drama is regarded as the highest achievement of Sanskrit literature.Brandon (1981, xvii). It utilised stock characters, such as the hero (nayaka), heroine (nayika), or clown (vidusaka). Actors may have specialised in a particular type. It was patronized by the kings as well as village assemblies. Famous early playwrights include Bhasa, Kalidasa (famous for Vikrama and Urvashi, Malavika and Agnimitra, and The Recognition of Shakuntala), Śudraka (famous for The Little Clay Cart), Asvaghosa, Daṇḍin, and Emperor Harsha (famous for Nagananda, Ratnavali, and Priyadarsika). Śakuntalā (in English translation) influenced Goethe's Faust (1808–1832). Modern Indian drama Rabindranath Tagore was a pioneering modern playwright who wrote plays noted for their exploration and questioning of nationalism, identity, spiritualism and material greed.Banham (1998, 1051). His plays are written in Bengali and include Chitra (Chitrangada, 1892), The King of the Dark Chamber (Raja, 1910), The Post Office (Dakghar, 1913), and Red Oleander (Raktakarabi, 1924). Girish Karnad is a noted playwright, who has written a number of plays that use history and mythology, to critique and problematize ideas and ideals that are of contemporary relevance. Karnad's numerous plays such as Tughlaq, Hayavadana, Taledanda, and Naga-Mandala are significant contributions to Indian drama. Vijay Tendulkar and Mahesh Dattani are amongst the major Indian playwrights of the 20th century. Mohan Rakesh in Hindi and Danish Iqbal in Urdu are considered architects of new age Drama. Mohan Rakesh's Aadhe Adhoore and Danish Iqbal's Dara Shikoh are considered modern classics. Modern Urdu drama of India and Pakistan Urdu Drama evolved from the prevailing dramatic traditions of North India shaping Rahas or Raas as practiced by exponents like Nawab Wajid Ali Shah (1822 – 1887) of Awadh. His dramatic experiments led to the famous Inder Sabha of Amanat and later this tradition took the shape of Parsi Theatre. Agha Hashr Kashmiri is the culmination of this tradition. Urdu theatre tradition has greatly influenced modern Indian theatre. Theatre has flourished in Urdu (which was called Hindi by early writers), along with Gujrati, Marathi, and Bengali. Urdu drama has had an important influence on Bombay Film industry and all the early works of Urdu theatre (performed by Parsi Companies) were made into films. Urdu dramatic tradition has existed for more than a 100 years. Prof Hasan, Ghulam Jeelani, J.N,Kaushal, Shameem Hanfi, Jameel Shaidayi, etc. belong to the old generation, contemporary writers like Danish Iqbal, Sayeed Alam, Shahid Anwar, Iqbal Niyazi, and Anwar are a few postmodern playwrights actively contributing in the field of Urdu Drama. Sayeed Alam is known for his wit and humour and more particularly for plays like 'Ghalib in New Delhi', 'Big B' and many other works, which are regularly staged for large audiences. Maulana Azad is his most important play both for its content and style. Danish Iqbal's play Dara Shikoh directed by M. S. Sathyu is a modern classic that uses newer theatre techniques and a contemporary perspective. His other plays are Sahir. on the famous lyricist and revolutionary poet. Kuchh Ishq kiya Kuchh Kaam is another play written by Danish which is basically a Celebration of Faiz's poetry, featuring events from the early part of his life, particularly the events and incidents of pre-partition days which shaped his life and ideals. Chand Roz Aur Meri Jaan – another play inspired from Faiz's letters written from various jails during the Rawalpindi Conspiracy days. He has written 14 other plays including Dilli Jo Ek Shehr Thaa and Main Gaya Waqt Nahin hoon. Shahid's Three B is also a significant play. He has been associated with many groups like 'Natwa' and others. Zaheer Anwar has kept the flag of Urdu theatre flying in Kolkata. Unlike the writers of previous generation Sayeed, Shahid, Danish Iqbal and Zaheer do not write bookish plays but their work is a product of performing tradition. Iqbal Niyazi of Mumbai has written several plays in Urdu, his play AUR KITNE JALYANWALA BAUGH? won a National award other awards. Hence this is the only generation after Amanat and Agha Hashr who actually write for stage and not for libraries. =China= A 1958 U.S.S.R. postage stamp commemorating Guan Hanqing, one of the great Chinese dramatists, who is renowned for his \\"zaju\\" plays. Chinese theatre has a long and complex history. Today it is often called Chinese opera although this normally refers specifically to the popular form known as Beijing opera and Kunqu; there have been many other forms of theatre in China, such as zaju. =Japan= Japanese Nō drama is a serious dramatic form that combines drama, music, and dance into a complete aesthetic performance experience. It developed in the 14th and 15th centuries and has its own musical instruments and performance techniques, which were often handed down from father to son. The performers were generally male (for both male and female roles), although female amateurs also perform Nō dramas. Nō drama was supported by the government, and particularly the military, with many military commanders having their own troupes and sometimes performing themselves. It is still performed in Japan today. Kyōgen is the comic counterpart to Nō drama. It concentrates more on dialogue and less on music, although Nō instrumentalists sometimes appear also in Kyōgen. Kabuki drama, developed from the 17th century, is another comic form, which includes dance.

External links *Greek & Roman Mask Timeline ","title":"Drama"},{"id":"20913771","text":"Sarah Bernhardt as Hamlet, in 1899 Theatre or theater is a collaborative form of performing art that uses live performers, usually actors or actresses, to present the experience of a real or imagined event before a live audience in a specific place, often a stage. The performers may communicate this experience to the audience through combinations of gesture, speech, song, music, and dance. Elements of art, such as painted scenery and stagecraft such as lighting are used to enhance the physicality, presence and immediacy of the experience. The specific place of the performance is also named by the word \\"theatre\\" as derived from the Ancient Greek θέατρον (théatron, \\"a place for viewing\\"), itself from θεάομαι (theáomai, \\"to see\\", \\"to watch\\", \\"to observe\\"). Modern Western theatre comes, in large measure, from the theatre of ancient Greece, from which it borrows technical terminology, classification into genres, and many of its themes, stock characters, and plot elements. Theatre artist Patrice Pavis defines theatricality, theatrical language, stage writing and the specificity of theatre as synonymous expressions that differentiate theatre from the other performing arts, literature and the arts in general. Modern theatre includes performances of plays and musical theatre. The art forms of ballet and opera are also theatre and use many conventions such as acting, costumes and staging. They were influential to the development of musical theatre; see those articles for more information. History of theatreClassical and Hellenistic Greece= Greek theatre in Taormina, Sicily, Italy Greek phlyax play, circa 350/340 BCE The city-state of Athens is where western theatre originated. It was part of a broader culture of theatricality and performance in classical Greece that included festivals, religious rituals, politics, law, athletics and gymnastics, music, poetry, weddings, funerals, and symposia. Participation in the city-state's many festivals—and mandatory attendance at the City Dionysia as an audience member (or even as a participant in the theatrical productions) in particular—was an important part of citizenship. Civic participation also involved the evaluation of the rhetoric of orators evidenced in performances in the law- court or political assembly, both of which were understood as analogous to the theatre and increasingly came to absorb its dramatic vocabulary. The Greeks also developed the concepts of dramatic criticism and theatre architecture. Actors were either amateur or at best semi-professional. The theatre of ancient Greece consisted of three types of drama: tragedy, comedy, and the satyr play. The origins of theatre in ancient Greece, according to Aristotle (384–322 BCE), the first theoretician of theatre, are to be found in the festivals that honoured Dionysus. The performances were given in semi-circular auditoria cut into hillsides, capable of seating 10,000–20,000 people. The stage consisted of a dancing floor (orchestra), dressing room and scene- building area (skene). Since the words were the most important part, good acoustics and clear delivery were paramount. The actors (always men) wore masks appropriate to the characters they represented, and each might play several parts. Athenian tragedy—the oldest surviving form of tragedy—is a type of dance-drama that formed an important part of the theatrical culture of the city-state. Having emerged sometime during the 6th century BCE, it flowered during the 5th century BCE (from the end of which it began to spread throughout the Greek world), and continued to be popular until the beginning of the Hellenistic period. No tragedies from the 6th century BCE and only 32 of the more than a thousand that were performed in during the 5th century BCE have survived. We have complete texts extant by Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides. The origins of tragedy remain obscure, though by the 5th century BCE it was institutionalised in competitions (agon) held as part of festivities celebrating Dionysus (the god of wine and fertility). As contestants in the City Dionysia's competition (the most prestigious of the festivals to stage drama) playwrights were required to present a tetralogy of plays (though the individual works were not necessarily connected by story or theme), which usually consisted of three tragedies and one satyr play. The performance of tragedies at the City Dionysia may have begun as early as 534 BCE; official records (didaskaliai) begin from 501 BCE, when the satyr play was introduced. Most Athenian tragedies dramatise events from Greek mythology, though The Persians—which stages the Persian response to news of their military defeat at the Battle of Salamis in 480 BCE—is the notable exception in the surviving drama. When Aeschylus won first prize for it at the City Dionysia in 472 BCE, he had been writing tragedies for more than 25 years, yet its tragic treatment of recent history is the earliest example of drama to survive. More than 130 years later, the philosopher Aristotle analysed 5th- century Athenian tragedy in the oldest surviving work of dramatic theory—his Poetics (c. 335 BCE). Athenian comedy is conventionally divided into three periods, \\"Old Comedy\\", \\"Middle Comedy\\", and \\"New Comedy\\". Old Comedy survives today largely in the form of the eleven surviving plays of Aristophanes, while Middle Comedy is largely lost (preserved only in relatively short fragments in authors such as Athenaeus of Naucratis). New Comedy is known primarily from the substantial papyrus fragments of Menander. Aristotle defined comedy as a representation of laughable people that involves some kind of blunder or ugliness that does not cause pain or disaster. In addition to the categories of comedy and tragedy at the City Dionysia, the festival also included the Satyr Play. Finding its origins in rural, agricultural rituals dedicated to Dionysus, the satyr play eventually found its way to Athens in its most well- known form. Satyr's themselves were tied to the god Dionysus as his loyal woodland companions, often engaging in drunken revelry and mischief at his side. The satyr play itself was classified as tragicomedy, erring on the side of the more modern burlesque traditions of the early twentieth century. The plotlines of the plays were typically concerned with the dealings of the pantheon of Gods and their involvement in human affairs, backed by the chorus of Satyrs. However, according to Webster, satyr actors did not always perform typical satyr actions and would break from the acting traditions assigned to the character type of a mythical forest creature. =Roman theatre= Mosaic depicting masked actors in a play: two women consult a \\"witch\\" Western theatre developed and expanded considerably under the Romans. The Roman historian Livy wrote that the Romans first experienced theatre in the 4th century BCE, with a performance by Etruscan actors. Beacham argues that they had been familiar with \\"pre-theatrical practices\\" for some time before that recorded contact. The theatre of ancient Rome was a thriving and diverse art form, ranging from festival performances of street theatre, nude dancing, and acrobatics, to the staging of Plautus's broadly appealing situation comedies, to the high-style, verbally elaborate tragedies of Seneca. Although Rome had a native tradition of performance, the Hellenization of Roman culture in the 3rd century BCE had a profound and energizing effect on Roman theatre and encouraged the development of Latin literature of the highest quality for the stage. The only surviving plays from the Roman Empire are ten dramas attributed to Lucius Annaeus Seneca (4 BCE–65 CE), the Corduba-born Stoic philosopher and tutor of Nero. =Indian theatre= Koothu is an ancient form of performing art that originated in early Tamilakam. The earliest-surviving fragments of Sanskrit drama date from the 1st century CE. The wealth of archeological evidence from earlier periods offers no indication of the existence of a tradition of theatre. The ancient Vedas (hymns from between 1500 and 1000 BCE that are among the earliest examples of literature in the world) contain no hint of it (although a small number are composed in a form of dialogue) and the rituals of the Vedic period do not appear to have developed into theatre. The Mahābhāṣya by Patañjali contains the earliest reference to what may have been the seeds of Sanskrit drama. This treatise on grammar from 140 BCE provides a feasible date for the beginnings of theatre in India. The major source of evidence for Sanskrit theatre is A Treatise on Theatre (Nātyaśāstra), a compendium whose date of composition is uncertain (estimates range from 200 BCE to 200 CE) and whose authorship is attributed to Bharata Muni. The Treatise is the most complete work of dramaturgy in the ancient world. It addresses acting, dance, music, dramatic construction, architecture, costuming, make-up, props, the organisation of companies, the audience, competitions, and offers a mythological account of the origin of theatre. In doing so, it provides indications about the nature of actual theatrical practices. Sanskrit theatre was performed on sacred ground by priests who had been trained in the necessary skills (dance, music, and recitation) in a [hereditary process]. Its aim was both to educate and to entertain. Performer playing Sugriva in the Koodiyattam form of Sanskrit theatre Under the patronage of royal courts, performers belonged to professional companies that were directed by a stage manager (sutradhara), who may also have acted. This task was thought of as being analogous to that of a puppeteer—the literal meaning of \\"sutradhara\\" is \\"holder of the strings or threads\\". The performers were trained rigorously in vocal and physical technique. There were no prohibitions against female performers; companies were all-male, all-female, and of mixed gender. Certain sentiments were considered inappropriate for men to enact, however, and were thought better suited to women. Some performers played characters their own age, while others played ages different from their own (whether younger or older). Of all the elements of theatre, the Treatise gives most attention to acting (abhinaya), which consists of two styles: realistic (lokadharmi) and conventional (natyadharmi), though the major focus is on the latter. Its drama is regarded as the highest achievement of Sanskrit literature. It utilised stock characters, such as the hero (nayaka), heroine (nayika), or clown (vidusaka). Actors may have specialised in a particular type. Kālidāsa in the 1st century BCE, is arguably considered to be ancient India's greatest Sanskrit dramatist. Three famous romantic plays written by Kālidāsa are the Mālavikāgnimitram (Mālavikā and Agnimitra), Vikramuurvashiiya (Pertaining to Vikrama and Urvashi), and Abhijñānaśākuntala (The Recognition of Shakuntala). The last was inspired by a story in the Mahabharata and is the most famous. It was the first to be translated into English and German. Śakuntalā (in English translation) influenced Goethe's Faust (1808–1832). The next great Indian dramatist was Bhavabhuti (c. 7th century CE). He is said to have written the following three plays: Malati-Madhava, Mahaviracharita and Uttar Ramacharita. Among these three, the last two cover between them the entire epic of Ramayana. The powerful Indian emperor Harsha (606–648) is credited with having written three plays: the comedy Ratnavali, Priyadarsika, and the Buddhist drama Nagananda. =Chinese theatre= Public performance in Jade Dragon Snow Mountain Open Air Theatre The Tang dynasty is sometimes known as \\"The Age of 1000 Entertainments\\". During this era, Ming Huang formed an acting school known as The Pear Garden to produce a form of drama that was primarily musical. That is why actors are commonly called \\"Children of the Pear Garden.\\" During the dynasty of Empress Ling, shadow puppetry first emerged as a recognized form of theatre in China. There were two distinct forms of shadow puppetry, Pekingese (northern) and Cantonese (southern). The two styles were differentiated by the method of making the puppets and the positioning of the rods on the puppets, as opposed to the type of play performed by the puppets. Both styles generally performed plays depicting great adventure and fantasy, rarely was this very stylized form of theatre used for political propaganda. Cantonese shadow puppets were the larger of the two. They were built using thick leather which created more substantial shadows. Symbolic color was also very prevalent; a black face represented honesty, a red one bravery. The rods used to control Cantonese puppets were attached perpendicular to the puppets' heads. Thus, they were not seen by the audience when the shadow was created. Pekingese puppets were more delicate and smaller. They were created out of thin, translucent leather (usually taken from the belly of a donkey). They were painted with vibrant paints, thus they cast a very colorful shadow. The thin rods which controlled their movements were attached to a leather collar at the neck of the puppet. The rods ran parallel to the bodies of the puppet then turned at a ninety degree angle to connect to the neck. While these rods were visible when the shadow was cast, they laid outside the shadow of the puppet; thus they did not interfere with the appearance of the figure. The rods attached at the necks to facilitate the use of multiple heads with one body. When the heads were not being used, they were stored in a muslin book or fabric lined box. The heads were always removed at night. This was in keeping with the old superstition that if left intact, the puppets would come to life at night. Some puppeteers went so far as to store the heads in one book and the bodies in another, to further reduce the possibility of reanimating puppets. Shadow puppetry is said to have reached its highest point of artistic development in the eleventh century before becoming a tool of the government. In the Song dynasty, there were many popular plays involving acrobatics and music. These developed in the Yuan dynasty into a more sophisticated form known as zaju, with a four- or five-act structure. Yuan drama spread across China and diversified into numerous regional forms, one of the best known of which is Peking Opera which is still popular today. Xiangsheng is a certain traditional Chinese comedic performance in the forms of monologue or dialogue. =Post-classical theatre in the West= Theatre took on many alternate forms in the West between the 15th and 19th centuries, including commedia dell'arte and melodrama. The general trend was away from the poetic drama of the Greeks and the Renaissance and toward a more naturalistic prose style of dialogue, especially following the Industrial Revolution. Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in the West End. Opened in May 1663, it is the oldest theatre in London. Theatre took a big pause during 1642 and 1660 in England because of the Puritan Interregnum. Viewing theatre as something sinful, the Puritans ordered the closure of London theatres in 1642. This stagnant period ended once Charles II came back to the throne in 1660 in the Restoration. Theatre (among other arts) exploded, with influence from French culture, since Charles had been exiled in France in the years previous to his reign. One of the big changes was the new theatre house. Instead of the type of the Elizabethan era, such as the Globe Theatre, round with no place for the actors to really prep for the next act and with no \\"theatre manners\\", the theatre house became transformed into a place of refinement, with a stage in front and stadium seating facing it. Since seating was no longer all the way around the stage, it became prioritized—some seats were obviously better than others. The king would have the best seat in the house: the very middle of the theatre, which got the widest view of the stage as well as the best way to see the point of view and vanishing point that the stage was constructed around. Philippe Jacques de Loutherbourg was one of the most influential set designers of the time because of his use of floor space and scenery. Because of the turmoil before this time, there was still some controversy about what should and should not be put on the stage. Jeremy Collier, a preacher, was one of the heads in this movement through his piece A Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the English Stage. The beliefs in this paper were mainly held by non-theatre goers and the remainder of the Puritans and very religious of the time. The main question was if seeing something immoral on stage affects behavior in the lives of those who watch it, a controversy that is still playing out today. Billing for a British theatre in 1829 The seventeenth century had also introduced women to the stage, which was considered inappropriate earlier. These women were regarded as celebrities (also a newer concept, thanks to ideas on individualism that arose in the wake of Renaissance Humanism), but on the other hand, it was still very new and revolutionary that they were on the stage, and some said they were unladylike, and looked down on them. Charles II did not like young men playing the parts of young women, so he asked that women play their own parts. Because women were allowed on the stage, playwrights had more leeway with plot twists, like women dressing as men, and having narrow escapes from morally sticky situations as forms of comedy. Comedies were full of the young and very much in vogue, with the storyline following their love lives: commonly a young roguish hero professing his love to the chaste and free minded heroine near the end of the play, much like Sheridan's The School for Scandal. Many of the comedies were fashioned after the French tradition, mainly Molière, again hailing back to the French influence brought back by the King and the Royals after their exile. Molière was one of the top comedic playwrights of the time, revolutionizing the way comedy was written and performed by combining Italian commedia dell'arte and neoclassical French comedy to create some of the longest lasting and most influential satiric comedies. Tragedies were similarly victorious in their sense of righting political power, especially poignant because of the recent Restoration of the Crown. They were also imitations of French tragedy, although the French had a larger distinction between comedy and tragedy, whereas the English fudged the lines occasionally and put some comedic parts in their tragedies. Common forms of non-comedic plays were sentimental comedies as well as something that would later be called tragédie bourgeoise, or domestic tragedy—that is, the tragedy of common life—were more popular in England because they appealed more to English sensibilities. While theatre troupes were formerly often travelling, the idea of the national theatre gained support in the 18th century, inspired by Ludvig Holberg. The major promoter of the idea of the national theatre in Germany, and also of the Sturm und Drang poets, was Abel Seyler, the owner of the Hamburgische Entreprise and the Seyler Theatre Company.Wilhelm Kosch, \\"Seyler, Abel\\", in Dictionary of German Biography, eds. Walther Killy and Rudolf Vierhaus, Vol. 9, Walter de Gruyter editor, 2005, , . Vanemuine Theatre from 1918 in Tartu, Estonia. Through the 19th century, the popular theatrical forms of Romanticism, melodrama, Victorian burlesque and the well-made plays of Scribe and Sardou gave way to the problem plays of Naturalism and Realism; the farces of Feydeau; Wagner's operatic Gesamtkunstwerk; musical theatre (including Gilbert and Sullivan's operas); F. C. Burnand's, W. S. Gilbert's and Oscar Wilde's drawing-room comedies; Symbolism; proto-Expressionism in the late works of August Strindberg and Henrik Ibsen; and Edwardian musical comedy. These trends continued through the 20th century in the realism of Stanislavski and Lee Strasberg, the political theatre of Erwin Piscator and Bertolt Brecht, the so-called Theatre of the Absurd of Samuel Beckett and Eugène Ionesco, American and British musicals, the collective creations of companies of actors and directors such as Joan Littlewood's Theatre Workshop, experimental and postmodern theatre of Robert Wilson and Robert Lepage, the postcolonial theatre of August Wilson or Tomson Highway, and Augusto Boal's Theatre of the Oppressed. =Eastern theatrical traditions= Rakshasa or the demon as depicted in Yakshagana, a form of musical dance-drama from India The first form of Indian theatre was the Sanskrit theatre. It began after the development of Greek and Roman theatre and before the development of theatre in other parts of Asia. It emerged sometime between the 2nd century BCE and the 1st century CE and flourished between the 1st century CE and the 10th, which was a period of relative peace in the history of India during which hundreds of plays were written. Japanese forms of Kabuki, Nō, and Kyōgen developed in the 17th century CE. Theatre in the medieval Islamic world included puppet theatre (which included hand puppets, shadow plays and marionette productions) and live passion plays known as ta'ziya, where actors re-enact episodes from Muslim history. In particular, Shia Islamic plays revolved around the shaheed (martyrdom) of Ali's sons Hasan ibn Ali and Husayn ibn Ali. Secular plays were known as akhraja, recorded in medieval adab literature, though they were less common than puppetry and ta'ziya theatre. TypesDrama= Drama is the specific mode of fiction represented in performance. The term comes from a Greek word meaning \\"action\\", which is derived from the verb δράω, dráō, \\"to do\\" or \\"to act\\". The enactment of drama in theatre, performed by actors on a stage before an audience, presupposes collaborative modes of production and a collective form of reception. The structure of dramatic texts, unlike other forms of literature, is directly influenced by this collaborative production and collective reception. The early modern tragedy Hamlet (1601) by Shakespeare and the classical Athenian tragedy Oedipus Rex (c. 429 BCE) by Sophocles are among the masterpieces of the art of drama. A modern example is Long Day's Journey into Night by Eugene O'Neill (1956). Considered as a genre of poetry in general, the dramatic mode has been contrasted with the epic and the lyrical modes ever since Aristotle's Poetics (c. 335 BCE)—the earliest work of dramatic theory. The use of \\"drama\\" in the narrow sense to designate a specific type of play dates from the 19th century. Drama in this sense refers to a play that is neither a comedy nor a tragedy—for example, Zola's Thérèse Raquin (1873) or Chekhov's Ivanov (1887). In Ancient Greece however, the word drama encompassed all theatrical plays, tragic, comic, or anything in between. Drama is often combined with music and dance: the drama in opera is generally sung throughout; musicals generally include both spoken dialogue and songs; and some forms of drama have incidental music or musical accompaniment underscoring the dialogue (melodrama and Japanese Nō, for example). In certain periods of history (the ancient Roman and modern Romantic) some dramas have been written to be read rather than performed. In improvisation, the drama does not pre-exist the moment of performance; performers devise a dramatic script spontaneously before an audience. =Musical theatre= Music and theatre have had a close relationship since ancient times—Athenian tragedy, for example, was a form of dance-drama that employed a chorus whose parts were sung (to the accompaniment of an aulos—an instrument comparable to the modern clarinet), as were some of the actors' responses and their 'solo songs' (monodies). Modern musical theatre is a form of theatre that also combines music, spoken dialogue, and dance. It emerged from comic opera (especially Gilbert and Sullivan), variety, vaudeville, and music hall genres of the late 19th and early 20th century. After the Edwardian musical comedy that began in the 1890s, the Princess Theatre musicals of the early 20th century, and comedies in the 1920s and 1930s (such as the works of Rodgers and Hammerstein), with Oklahoma! (1943), musicals moved in a more dramatic direction. Famous musicals over the subsequent decades included My Fair Lady (1956), West Side Story (1957), The Fantasticks (1960), Hair (1967), A Chorus Line (1975), Les Misérables (1980), Into the Woods (1986), and The Phantom of the Opera (1986), as well as more contemporary hits including Rent (1994), The Lion King (1997), Wicked (2003), and Hamilton (2015). Musical theatre may be produced on an intimate scale Off- Broadway, in regional theatres, and elsewhere, but it often includes spectacle. For instance, Broadway and West End musicals often include lavish costumes and sets supported by multimillion-dollar budgets. Theatrical masks of Tragedy and Comedy. Mosaic, Roman artwork, 2nd century CE. Capitoline Museums, Rome =Comedy= Theatre productions that use humour as a vehicle to tell a story qualify as comedies. This may include a modern farce such as Boeing Boeing or a classical play such as As You Like It. Theatre expressing bleak, controversial or taboo subject matter in a deliberately humorous way is referred to as black comedy. Black Comedy can have several genres like slapstick humour, dark and sarcastic comedy. =Tragedy= Aristotle's phrase \\"several kinds being found in separate parts of the play\\" is a reference to the structural origins of drama. In it the spoken parts were written in the Attic dialect whereas the choral (recited or sung) ones in the Doric dialect, these discrepancies reflecting the differing religious origins and poetic metres of the parts that were fused into a new entity, the theatrical drama. Tragedy refers to a specific tradition of drama that has played a unique and important role historically in the self-definition of Western civilisation. That tradition has been multiple and discontinuous, yet the term has often been used to invoke a powerful effect of cultural identity and historical continuity—\\"the Greeks and the Elizabethans, in one cultural form; Hellenes and Christians, in a common activity,\\" as Raymond Williams puts it. From its obscure origins in the theatres of Athens 2,500 years ago, from which there survives only a fraction of the work of Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides, through its singular articulations in the works of Shakespeare, Lope de Vega, Racine, and Schiller, to the more recent naturalistic tragedy of Strindberg, Beckett's modernist meditations on death, loss and suffering, and Müller's postmodernist reworkings of the tragic canon, tragedy has remained an important site of cultural experimentation, negotiation, struggle, and change. In the wake of Aristotle's Poetics (335 BCE), tragedy has been used to make genre distinctions, whether at the scale of poetry in general (where the tragic divides against epic and lyric) or at the scale of the drama (where tragedy is opposed to comedy). In the modern era, tragedy has also been defined against drama, melodrama, the tragicomic, and epic theatre. =Improvisation= Improvisation has been a consistent feature of theatre, with the Commedia dell'arte in the sixteenth century being recognised as the first improvisation form. Popularized by Nobel Prize Winner Dario Fo and troupes such as the Upright Citizens Brigade improvisational theatre continues to evolve with many different streams and philosophies. Keith Johnstone and Viola Spolin are recognized as the first teachers of improvisation in modern times, with Johnstone exploring improvisation as an alternative to scripted theatre and Spolin and her successors exploring improvisation principally as a tool for developing dramatic work or skills or as a form for situational comedy. Spolin also became interested in how the process of learning improvisation was applicable to the development of human potential. Spolin's son, Paul Sills popularized improvisational theatre as a theatrical art form when he founded, as its first director, The Second City in Chicago. Theories Village feast with theatre performance circa 1600 Having been an important part of human culture for more than 2,500 years, theatre has evolved a wide range of different theories and practices. Some are related to political or spiritual ideologies, while others are based purely on \\"artistic\\" concerns. Some processes focus on a story, some on theatre as event, and some on theatre as catalyst for social change. The classical Greek philosopher Aristotle, in his seminal treatise, Poetics (c. 335 BCE) is the earliest- surviving example and its arguments have influenced theories of theatre ever since. In it, he offers an account of what he calls \\"poetry\\" (a term which in Greek literally means \\"making\\" and in this context includes drama—comedy, tragedy, and the satyr play—as well as lyric poetry, epic poetry, and the dithyramb). He examines its \\"first principles\\" and identifies its genres and basic elements; his analysis of tragedy constitutes the core of the discussion.Aristotle Poetics 1447a13 (1987, 1). Aristotle argues that tragedy consists of six qualitative parts, which are (in order of importance) mythos or \\"plot\\", ethos or \\"character\\", dianoia or \\"thought\\", lexis or \\"diction\\", melos or \\"song\\", and opsis or \\"spectacle\\". \\"Although Aristotle's Poetics is universally acknowledged in the Western critical tradition\\", Marvin Carlson explains, \\"almost every detail about his seminal work has aroused divergent opinions.\\" Important theatre practitioners of the 20th century include Konstantin Stanislavski, Vsevolod Meyerhold, Jacques Copeau, Edward Gordon Craig, Bertolt Brecht, Antonin Artaud, Joan Littlewood, Peter Brook, Jerzy Grotowski, Augusto Boal, Eugenio Barba, Dario Fo, Viola Spolin, Keith Johnstone and Robert Wilson (director). Stanislavski treated the theatre as an art-form that is autonomous from literature and one in which the playwright's contribution should be respected as that of only one of an ensemble of creative artists. His innovative contribution to modern acting theory has remained at the core of mainstream western performance training for much of the last century. That many of the precepts of his system of actor training seem to be common sense and self-evident testifies to its hegemonic success. Actors frequently employ his basic concepts without knowing they do so. Thanks to its promotion and elaboration by acting teachers who were former students and the many translations of his theoretical writings, Stanislavski's 'system' acquired an unprecedented ability to cross cultural boundaries and developed an international reach, dominating debates about acting in Europe and the United States. Many actors routinely equate his 'system' with the North American Method, although the latter's exclusively psychological techniques contrast sharply with Stanislavski's multivariant, holistic and psychophysical approach, which explores character and action both from the 'inside out' and the 'outside in' and treats the actor's mind and body as parts of a continuum. Technical aspects A theatre stage building Theatre presupposes collaborative modes of production and a collective form of reception. The structure of dramatic texts, unlike other forms of literature, is directly influenced by this collaborative production and collective reception. The production of plays usually involves contributions from a playwright, director, a cast of actors, and a technical production team that includes a scenic or set designer, lighting designer, costume designer, sound designer, stage manager, production manager and technical director. Depending on the production, this team may also include a composer, dramaturg, video designer or fight director. Stagecraft is a generic term referring to the technical aspects of theatrical, film, and video production. It includes, but is not limited to, constructing and rigging scenery, hanging and focusing of lighting, design and procurement of costumes, makeup, procurement of props, stage management, and recording and mixing of sound. Stagecraft is distinct from the wider umbrella term of scenography. Considered a technical rather than an artistic field, it relates primarily to the practical implementation of a designer's artistic vision. In its most basic form, stagecraft is managed by a single person (often the stage manager of a smaller production) who arranges all scenery, costumes, lighting, and sound, and organizes the cast. At a more professional level, for example in modern Broadway houses, stagecraft is managed by hundreds of skilled carpenters, painters, electricians, stagehands, stitchers, wigmakers, and the like. This modern form of stagecraft is highly technical and specialized: it comprises many sub- disciplines and a vast trove of history and tradition. The majority of stagecraft lies between these two extremes. Regional theatres and larger community theatres will generally have a technical director and a complement of designers, each of whom has a direct hand in their respective designs. Sub-categories and organization There are many modern theatre movements which go about producing theatre in a variety of ways. Theatrical enterprises vary enormously in sophistication and purpose. People who are involved vary from novices and hobbyists (in community theatre) to professionals (in Broadway and similar productions). Theatre can be performed with a shoestring budget or on a grand scale with multimillion-dollar budgets. This diversity manifests in the abundance of theatre sub-categories, which include: * Broadway theatre and West End theatre * Street theatre * Community theatre * Playback theatre * Dinner theater * Fringe theatre * Off-Broadway and Off West End * Off-Off-Broadway * Regional theatre in the United States * Summer stock theatre =Repertory companies= Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, London, c. 1821 While most modern theatre companies rehearse one piece of theatre at a time, perform that piece for a set \\"run\\", retire the piece, and begin rehearsing a new show, repertory companies rehearse multiple shows at one time. These companies are able to perform these various pieces upon request and often perform works for years before retiring them. Most dance companies operate on this repertory system. The Royal National Theatre in London performs on a repertory system. Repertory theatre generally involves a group of similarly accomplished actors, and relies more on the reputation of the group than on an individual star actor. It also typically relies less on strict control by a director and less on adherence to theatrical conventions, since actors who have worked together in multiple productions can respond to each other without relying as much on convention or external direction. =Producing vs. presenting= Interior of a modern theater In order to put on a piece of theatre, both a theatre company and a theatre venue are needed. When a theatre company is the sole company in residence at a theatre venue, this theatre (and its corresponding theatre company) are called a resident theatre or a producing theatre, because the venue produces its own work. Other theatre companies, as well as dance companies, who do not have their own theatre venue, perform at rental theatres or at presenting theatres. Both rental and presenting theatres have no full-time resident companies. They do, however, sometimes have one or more part-time resident companies, in addition to other independent partner companies who arrange to use the space when available. A rental theatre allows the independent companies to seek out the space, while a presenting theatre seeks out the independent companies to support their work by presenting them on their stage. Some performance groups perform in non- theatrical spaces. Such performances can take place outside or inside, in a non-traditional performance space, and include street theatre, and site- specific theatre. Non-traditional venues can be used to create more immersive or meaningful environments for audiences. They can sometimes be modified more heavily than traditional theatre venues, or can accommodate different kinds of equipment, lighting and sets.Alice T. Carter, \\"Non-traditional venues can inspire art, or just great performances \\", Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, July 7, 2008. Retrieved February 12, 2011. A touring company is an independent theatre or dance company that travels, often internationally, being presented at a different theatre in each city. =Unions= There are many theatre unions including: Actors' Equity Association (for actors and stage managers), the Stage Directors and Choreographers Society (SDC), and the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE, for designers and technicians). Many theatres require that their staff be members of these organizations.

Also a professor of Islamic law, he became a top Islamic cleric within Hamas after the death of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin in 2004. Rayan was a strong promoter between 1994 and 2004 of suicide bombings on Israel, and his son killed himself on one such mission. Rayan and most of his family were killed in an Israeli airstrike during the Gaza War. Personal life Rayan was born in Jabalia, Gaza Strip on 6 March 1959.الغارات الإسرائيلية على قطاع غزة تودي بحياة قيادي بارز في حماس (alarabiya)According to The Independent, Rayan was born in 1956. In 1982, he received a BSc degree in Theology and Religious studies from Imam Muhammad ibn Saud Islamic University in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. While there he was influenced by Wahhabism and Salafism. He then attended the University of Jordan in Amman and in 1990 received a masters MSc degree with honors. In 1994, Rayan completed his PhD in Islamic studies at the Omdurman Islamic University in Omdurman, Sudan. His dissertation has the title of Future of Islam: Objective Analysis. After his studies, Rayan returned to Gaza and was employed as an imam at several mosques, Jabalia's Imad Aqil Mosque (also known as the \\"Mosque of martyrs\\") among them.Nizar Rayan UK Guardian 3 January 2009 He later became a professor of Islamic law at the Islamic University of Gaza. Rayan was a leading authority on Hadith (sayings of the Islamic prophet Muhammad), and he amassed a 5,000-book library in his home. An Israeli intelligence source describes Rayan as a strong opponent of Shia Islam, who opposed allowing any form of Shiia Islam to establish a foothold in Gaza and the West Bank. Eventually, according to The Jerusalem Post, Rayan became an important leader in Hamas, in particular an Islamic leader of Hamas's military wing,No tears for Hamas leader in Ramallah, Jerusalem Post, 1 January 2009. and he regularly went on patrol with Hamas militia after delivering lectures at the Islamic University.\\"Israel fells key Hamas strongman, escalating conflict; says it's ready for ground invasion\\" New York Daily News 1 January 2009 He arguably became Hamas's leading clerical authority after an Israeli airstrike killed Sheikh Ahmed Yassin in 2004. Rayan along with Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad began to strongly advocate for suicide bombings to be carried out against Israel in 1994. According to Chris Hedges who interviewed him, Rayan constantly recalled that Hamas, \\"began to target Israeli civilians in 1994 only after Palestinian worshipers were gunned down in a Hebron mosque by a Jewish settler, Baruch Goldstein.\\" In 2001, with Rayan's sent his 22-year-old son on a suicide bombing mission in which he died and killed two Israelis at the former Israeli settlement Elei Sinai in the Gaza Strip.\\"Obituary: Nizar Rayyan\\" BBC 1 January 2009 Rayan is alleged to have directed the 2004 Ashdod Port attack which killed ten people. Hamas ceased its suicide attacks against Israel in 2005, but Rayan advocated for their renewal after the 2008-2009 Gaza conflict began.Hardline Hamas leader killed in air strike on Gaza home The Telegraph 1 January 2009 Rayan was one of the main commanders who oversaw the 2007 Battle of Gaza, in which Hamas expelled Fatah from Gaza. Fatah security forces were militarily defeated, the battle resulting in the death of 115 fighters and 400 civilians. Both Hamas and Fatah were accused of atrocities, including torture, during the conflict.Exposing the bitter truth of Gaza carnage The Age (Australia) 23 June 2007\\"Gaza-Westbank–ICRC Bulletin No. 22/2007\\" Reuters 15 June 2007 According to The Jerusalem Post, Rayan, \\"boasted that the Gaza Strip had been 'cleansed' of 'traitors' 'secularists' and 'CIA agents' - a reference to Abbas and his former security and intelligence chiefs.\\" According to a Hamas spokesperson, it is possible the Fatah-dominated Palestinian National Authority asked Israel to kill Rayan due to his role in the Hamas-Fatah clashes. He added that Rayan was one of the main reasons why many of Mahmoud Abbas's men \\"did not sleep well at all at night.\\" Rayan was strongly opposed to the state of Israel. According to Israeli-American writer Jeffrey Goldberg, he at one time stated, \\"True Islam would never allow a Jewish state to survive in the Arab and Muslim Middle East. Israel is an impossibility. It is an offense against God.\\" Goldberg also reported that Rayan said he believed Jews are a \\"cursed people\\" some of whom were transformed into pigs and apes by Allah, and that Jews must pay for murdering the prophets of Islam and \\"closing [their] ears to the Messenger of Allah.\\" Rayan married four women with whom he had twelve children. Hamas takeover of Gaza Following the 2007 takeover of Gaza, Rayan said that \\"In a few hours, the secular era in Gaza will end without leaving a trace... Today heresy and apostasy ends. Today the struggle is between Islam and the non-muslim infidels, and it will end with the victory of the faith.\\" He added that he will transform the PA security forces headquarters in Gaza to a mosque.

According to a Hamas spokesperson and Rayyan's son, the IDF and Shin Bet warned Rayan by contacting his telephone that an attack on his house was imminent. An Israeli military spokesperson interviewed by The International Herald Tribune \\"could not give details or specify whether Rayyan's family had been warned.\\" Israeli security sources stated that Rayan's house, at the time of the attack, was a munitions warehouse and communications center, and contained a tunnel opening. The sources also stated that a weapons cache in the house triggered many secondary explosions immediately after the air strike. The New York Daily News commented that Rayan had \\"sacrificed his children - in a vain attempt to protect a weapons base beneath his home.\\" Israeli security forces legal officials regard striking homes used for weapons storage, when sufficient warning is given to the residents, as falling within the boundaries of international law and a legitimate act of war. However, according to B'Tselem (The Israeli Center for Human Rights Information in the Occupied Territories), even if the Israeli charge that Rayan's house was an arms warehouse were true, the large number of civilian lives taken rendered the attack \\"a grave breach of international humanitarian law.\\" The Israeli NGO added that, given the Israeli military \\"knew or should have known\\" that civilians had not left Rayan's house, warning Rayan of the impending attack did not exempt Israeli forces from responsibility for the civilian deaths.The killing of Nizar Rayan and 15 members of his family B'Tselem 4 January 2009 According to the Israeli Government report published in July 2009, Nizar Rayan was not the target of the attack; instead, the operational goal of the strike was to destroy Hamas' central compound which included several buildings that served as storage sites for weapons that included missiles and rockets. The report further states that specific phone calls to the residents of the targeted buildings were made, as well as three rounds of preliminary warning shots, 13 minutes and 9 minutes before the strike, were fired; a group of the residents leaving the building were seen by IDF surveillance, leading to a reasonable conclusion that the buildings were empty.

It also stands for the planet Venus and is the alchemical symbol for copper. Female (symbol: ♀) is the sex of an organism, or a part of an organism, that produces non-mobile ova (egg cells). Barring rare medical conditions, most female mammals, including female humans, have two X chromosomes. Female characteristics vary between different species with some species containing more well defined female characteristics, such as the presence of pronounced mammary glands. There is no single genetic mechanism behind sex differences in different species and the existence of two sexes seems to have evolved multiple times independently in different evolutionary lineages.

Retrieved 2019-11-24Donald M. Ayers, English Words from Latin and Greek Elements, second edition (1986, University of Arizona Press), p. 113 Female can also be used to refer to gender.  Defining characteristics  Females produce ova, the larger gametes in a heterogamous reproduction system, while the smaller and usually motile gamete, the spermatozoon, is produced by the male.David E. Sadava, H. Craig Heller, William K. Purves, Life: The Science of Biology (2008), p. 899 A female cannot reproduce sexually without access to the gametes of a male, and vice versa, but in some species females can reproduce by themselves asexually, for example via parthenogenesis.Franz Engelmann, G. A. Kerkut, The Physiology of Insect Reproduction (2015), p. 29 There is no single genetic mechanism behind sex differences in different species and the existence of two sexes seems to have evolved multiple times independently in different evolutionary lineages.Christopher Alan Anderson, \\"The Metaphysics of Sex ...in a Changing World!\\" Patterns of sexual reproduction include: *Isogamous species with two or more mating types with gametes of identical form and behavior (but different at the molecular level), *Anisogamous species with gametes of male and female types, *Oogamous species, which include humans, in which the female gamete is very much larger than the male and has no ability to move. Oogamy is a form of anisogamy. There is an argument that this pattern was driven by the physical constraints on the mechanisms by which two gametes get together as required for sexual reproduction.Dusenbery, David B. (2009). Living at Micro Scale, Chapter 20. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts . Other than the defining difference in the type of gamete produced, differences between males and females in one lineage cannot always be predicted by differences in another. The concept is not limited to animals; egg cells are produced by chytrids, diatoms, water moulds and land plants, among others. In land plants, female and male designate not only the egg- and sperm-producing organisms and structures, but also the structures of the sporophytes that give rise to male and female plants. Mammalian female Adult female and male with clean-shaven pubic regions. A distinguishing characteristic of the class Mammalia is the presence of mammary glands. The mammary glands are modified sweat glands that produce milk, which is used to feed the young for some time after birth. Only mammals produce milk. Mammary glands are most obvious in humans, as the female human body stores large amounts of fatty tissue near the nipples, resulting in prominent breasts. Mammary glands are present in all mammals, although they are seldom used by the males of the species. Most mammalian females have two copies of the X chromosome as opposed to males which have only one X and one smaller Y chromosome; some mammals, such as the platypus, have different combinations.Adrian T. Sumner, Chromosomes: Organization and Function (2008), pp. 97-98Benjamin A. Pierce, Genetics: A Conceptual Approach (2012), p. 73 To compensate for the difference in size, one of the female's X chromosomes is randomly inactivated in each cell of placental mammals while the paternally derived X is inactivated in marsupials. In birds and some reptiles, by contrast, it is the female which is heterozygous and carries a Z and a W chromosome whilst the male carries two Z chromosomes. Intersex conditions can also give rise to other combinations, such as XO or XXX in mammals, which are still considered as female so long as they do not contain a Y chromosome, except for specific cases of mutations in the genes of XY individuals while in the womb. However, these conditions frequently result in sterility. Mammalian females bear live young, with the exception of monotreme females, which lay eggs.Terry Vaughan, James Ryan, Nicholas Czaplewski, Mammalogy (2011), pp. 391, 412 Some non-mammalian species, such as guppies, have analogous reproductive structures; and some other non-mammals, such as sharks, whose eggs hatch inside their bodies, also have the appearance of bearing live young. Etymology and usage \\"fæmnan,\\" an Old English word for 'female' The word female comes from the Latin femella, the diminutive form of femina, meaning \\"woman\\"; it is not etymologically related to the word male, but in the late 14th century the spelling was altered in English to parallel the spelling of male. Female can refer to either sex or genderLaura Palazzani, Gender in Philosophy and Law (2012), page vL. Gordon, \\"On difference\\", in Genders (1991), p. 95 or a shape of connectors.J. Richard Johnson, How to Build Electronic Equipment (1962), p. 167: \\"To minimize confusion, the connector portions with projecting prongs are referred to as the 'male' portion, and the sockets as the 'female' portion.\\"Richard Ferncase, Film and Video Lighting Terms and Concepts (2013), p. 96: \\"female[:] Refers to a socket type connector, which must receive a male connector\\" Symbol The symbol ♀ (Unicode: U+2640 Alt codes: Alt+12), a circle with a small cross underneath, is commonly used to represent females. Joseph Justus Scaliger once speculated that the symbol was associated with Venus, goddess of beauty because it resembles a bronze mirror with a handle, but modern scholars consider that fanciful, and the most established view is that the female and male symbols derive from contractions in Greek script of the Greek names of the planets Thouros (Mars) and Phosphoros (Venus).G D Schott, Sex, drugs, and rock and roll: Sex symbols ancient and modern: their origins and iconography on the pedigree, BMJ 2005;331:1509-1510 (24 December), Sex determination The sex of a particular organism may be determined by a number of factors. These may be genetic or environmental, or may naturally change during the course of an organism's life. Although most species have only two sexes (either male or female), hermaphroditic animals have both male and female reproductive organs. =Genetic determination= The sex of most mammals, including humans, is genetically determined by the XY sex- determination system where males have X and Y (as opposed to X and X) sex chromosomes. During reproduction, the male contributes either an X sperm or a Y sperm, while the female always contributes an X egg. A Y sperm and an X egg produce a male, while an X sperm and an X egg produce a female. The ZW sex- determination system, where males have ZZ (as opposed to ZW) sex chromosomes, is found in birds, reptiles and some insects and other organisms. Members of Hymenoptera, such as ants and bees, are determined by haplodiploidy, where most males are haploid and females and some sterile males are diploid. =Environmental determination= The young of some species develop into one sex or the other depending on local environmental conditions, e.g. many crocodilians' sex is influenced by the temperature of their eggs. Other species (such as the goby) can transform, as adults, from one sex to the other in response to local reproductive conditions (such as a brief shortage of males).

The by-election was caused by the resignation of the sitting Unionist Member of Parliament (MP) Lord Malcolm Douglas-Hamilton, by his application for the Chiltern Hundreds. Douglas-Hamilton had held the seat since 1950. The result was a victory for the Unionist candidate Neil McLean. McLean held the seat until 1964 when he lost to the Liberal Russell Johnston. The constituency In 1954 the constituency of Inverness was one of the largest Parliamentary constituencies in BritainThe Times, 4 December 1954, p. 6 spread across of Scottish Highland, from the county town of Inverness to the west coast of Scotland and included the Isle of Skye and some nearby islands. More than half the electorate lived in the town of Inverness itself however.Alun Wyburn Powell, The Inverness turning point; in Journal of Liberal History, Issue 53 Winter 2006-07 pp. 18–25 Candidates The Tories chose as their representative the 36-year-old, Eton and Sandhurst educated Lieutenant Colonel Neil McLean who had lived in the Highlands as a child. McLean had the advantage of knowing that Douglas- Hamilton was going to resign and had moved to the constituency in anticipation of the by-election. He had been installed as the prospective candidate for about 18 months, using the time to get to know the area well and establish a rapport with the electorate.The Times, 11 December 1954 p. 3 Labour selected Dundee engine driver and trade union official, William Paterson, aged 44. The former Labour candidate at the 1951 general election, Alexander Macnair had indicated he wished to stand again but the local Labour Party preferred a new man. Macnair then said he might put up as an Independent Labour candidate but did not do so in the end.The Times, 13 December 1954 p. 4 The Liberals, who had not fought the seat at the previous general election in 1951 settled on John Bannerman a Gaelic speaking farmer and former Scotland Rugby international, who had been Liberal candidate for Argyll at the general elections of 1945 and 1950. Election issues The first political controversy to emerge in relation to Inverness was the timing of the by- election itself. Labour in particular objected to what they called 'the sharp practice' of moving the by-election writ by the Tories when they did, based on the deliberate shortening of campaign time this would mean for opposition candidates, especially in a geographically large and electorally scattered constituency and at a difficult time of year - the dead of winter and just before Christmas.The Times, 4 December 1954 p. 6 According to one account in a national newspaper the topical issues were the problems of depopulation, transport and midges.The Times, 11 December 1954 p. 3 However the Liberal candidate, John Bannerman, based his campaign on support for home rule for ScotlandThe Times, 15 December 1954 p5 & 18 December 1954 p. 3 and an increase in old age pensions.Wyburn Powell, op cit Paterson received a letter of support from former prime minister Clement Attlee reminding voters that the Labour Party in office had developed hydro-electric power and a great programme of afforestation in the Highlands.The Times, 17 December 1954 p. 4  Votes Impact The by-election result caused little stir at the time, although the Liberals were clearly pleased with their performance given they had not fought the seat in 1951 and had pushed Labour into third place. It does however seem that Inverness served as a portent of what was to come in Scotland over the next few general elections. One historian has commented that the \\"...Conservative Party was to suffer in the following decades from the effects of growing support for home rule, later translated into support for the Scottish National Party and a rise in support for the Liberals and Labour.\\"Wyburn Powell, op cit Despite the opinion in The Times newspaper that ‘...it is possible to argue that if the Liberals could not recover Inverness this time, when all the circumstances and candidate favoured them, their best days there seem to be over for good'The Times, 24 December 1954 the Inverness result also pre-figured the Liberal revival of the late 1950s and 1960s when under the leadership of Jo Grimond the party won its first by-election victory since 1929 at Torrington in 1958 and more spectacularly at Orpington in 1962. As already noted, the Liberals best days in Inverness were hardly behind them as they won the seat in 1964 and the Liberal Democrats‘ Danny Alexander held the equivalent constituency until the 2015 general election.

Design and development The first flying boat designed by the Societa Idrovolanti Alta Italia (SIAI) for use as a civilian passenger carrier, the S.13, was a biplane flying boat with room for five passengers. The S.16 was powered by a single Fiat A.12bis engine. Military versions were also developed with a bow cockpit for an observer- gunner and bomb racks fitted underneath the wings. The military version was sold to Brazil, the Soviet Union, Spain, and Turkey. Operations In 1925, the Italian aviator Francesco de Pinedo (1890-1933), a tenente colonnello (lieutenant colonel) in the Regia Aeronautica (Italian Royal Air Force) used an SIAI S.16ter he named Genariello for a record-setting flight from Rome to Australia and Tokyo in order to demonstrate his idea that seaplanes were superior to landplanes for long-distance flights. On 21 April, Pinedo and his mechanic, Ernesto Campanelli, departed Rome aboard Gennariello.

During his famed career, Farroukh produced over 2000 paintings most of which were acquired by collectors both in Lebanon and abroad. He also wrote five books including a biography. Career He was formally trained in Rome and graduated in 1927 from Rome's Royal College of Fine Arts. He proceeded to Paris and continued further studies under the guidance of Paul Émile Chabas, the president of the Society of French Artists and many other French artists. Over his prosperous career, he exhibited in venues from Paris, Venice, New York City and Beirut. In his Studio in Beirut, he established a permanent exhibition of his artwork in 1932. His work was applauded for its representation of real life in Lebanon in pictures of the country, its people and its customs. He travelled through Spain in the early 1930s where his appreciation of Arabic art and architecture had a long-lasting effect on his artistic touch. He produced several paintings representing the Arab legacy in Spain. Farroukh became highly regarded as a Lebanese national painter at a time when Lebanon was asserting its political independence. His art captured the spirit and character of the Lebanese people and he became recognized as the outstanding Lebanese painter of his generation. Most of his paintings were portraits, landmarks, or scenery from his homeland Lebanon. Along with artists, Omar Onsi (1901-1969), César Gemayel (Qaisarr Jumayil) (1898-1958), Saliba Douaihy (Saliba Duwaihi) (b. 1915) and Rachid Wehbi (Rachid Wahbah)(b. 1917), Farroukh is regarded as a pioneer, having laid the foundations for a modern arts movement in Lebanon.

In the King of Siam's preamble to the penal code promulgated on 1 April 1908, and came into effect on 21 September, the king said: \\"In the ancient times the monarchs of the Siamese nation governed their people with laws which were originally derived from the Dhamasustra of Manu, which was then the prevailing law among the inhabitants of India and the neighbouring countries.\\" The principal law sources in Thailand are: * Constitution of Thailand - prevails over other laws. * Acts and statutes - Many of which created and amended the 4 basic codes: Civil and Commercial Code (CCC), Penal Code (PC), Civil Procedure Code, and the Criminal Procedure Code. Newer codes include the Land Code and the Revenue Code. Years on Thai statutes are dated with the Buddhist Era (BE) year based on the Thai solar calendar. * Emergency decree or royal proclamation - these are issued by the king, upon the advice of the cabinet, where an urgent law is needed for national security, public safety, national economic stability, or to avert a public calamity. An example is the Emergency Decree on Public Administration in Emergency Situation BE 2548 (2005). * Treaties * Subordinate legislation - Regulations (ministerial), orders, notifications, royal decrees, and rules. * Supreme Court opinions and other judicial decisions - Judicial precedent in Thailand is not binding. Courts are not bound to follow their own decisions. Lower courts are not bound to follow precedents set by higher courts. However, Thai law has been influenced by common law precedent. Courts are therefore significantly influenced by earlier decisions or decisions of higher courts. The Supreme Court of Justice publishes its decisions, known as \\"Supreme Court Opinions\\". These are frequently used as secondary authorities and are numbered according to the year issued. Other judicial decisions or rulings are published by the Administrative Court and the Constitutional Court. Public LawConstitutional Law= The Constitution of Thailand is the supreme law of Thailand which prevails over other laws passed by parliament. The 2017 Constitution of Thailand is the most recent constitution. The Constitutional Court of Thailand has jurisdiction to make rulings over the constitutionality of parliamentary acts, royal decrees, draft legislation, appointment and removal of public officials and issues regarding political parties and civil liberties. =Criminal law= Criminal offences (that can lead to arrest and imprisonment) are enumerated in the Thai Penal Code (or Criminal Code) as well as numerous other statutes. Criminal procedures are outlined in the Criminal Procedure Code. * Drug offences are dealt with by several statutes. The Narcotics Act BE 2522 (1979) defines narcotics, classifies them into categories, details offences and outlines punishments. Penalties for producing, importing or exporting narcotics are outlined in sections 65–102 (Chapter 12) and include fines, life imprisonment or death. Other narcotics laws include the Psychotropic Substances Act BE 2518 (1975) and the Narcotics Control Act BE 2519 (1976). * The offence of lèse majesté is found in the Criminal Code. Article 112 states that \\"Whoever defames, insults or threatens the King, Queen, the Heir-apparent or the Regent, shall be punished (with) imprisonment of three to fifteen years\\" (see also lèse majesté in Thailand). =Administrative law= Administrative law matters such as judicial review are handled by the Administrative Court, which was established under The Act on Establishment of Administrative Courts and Administrative Court Procedure BE 2542 (1999). The jurisdiction of the court includes unlawful act by an administrative agency or State official (e.g., ultra vires, inconsistent with law, bad faith etc.), neglecting or unreasonable delay in official duties, wrongful act or other liability of an administrative agency, administrative contracts, mandating a person to do something or an injunction. Immigration law Visa and immigration law is outlined in the Immigration Act BE 2522 (1979) and its amendments. The Immigration Bureau of the Royal Thai Police administers the law, while the Immigration Commission shall have power and duty to make decision such as giving or revoking permission to stay. Private law The most important reference of private law (or civil law) is the Civil and Commercial Code of Thailand (see also other civil codes). It is composed of several books. Books I and II were first promulgated on 11 November 1925 (BE 2466). The Civil code is updated as required by amendment acts (for example Act Amending Civil and Commercial Code (No 14) BE 2548 (2005)). =Law of Obligations= The Law of Obligations in general is found in Civil and Commercial Code sections 194 to 353 (Book II, Title I). Quasi-contracts include undue enrichment, sections 406 to 419 (Book II, Title IV), and management of affairs without mandate, sections 395 to 405 (Book II, Title III). =Contract law= The main source of contract law is the Civil and Commercial Code sections 354 to 394 (Book II, Title II). Specific contracts (Sale, Hire, Mortgage, Insurance, Bills etc.) are found in the Civil and Commercial Code sections 453 to 1011 (Book III, Titles I to XXI). =Tort or delict law= Tort law or delict law falls within the law of obligations. It is found in the Civil and Commercial Code sections 420 to 452 (Book II, Title V). The Code deals with wrongful acts: liability, compensation and exemptions to liability (justifiable acts). =Corporate law= Basic corporate law is found in the Civil and Commercial Code sections 1012 to 1273 (Book II, Title XXII). Foreign ownership of certain Thai industries and foreign companies in general are regulated by the Foreign Business Act BE 2542 (1999). =Personal property law= The main source of property law is the Civil and Commercial Code sections 1298 to 1434 (Book IV). =Land law= Land law is dealt with by the Land Code. This was established by Act Promulgating the Land Code, B.E. 2497 (1954). Land in Thailand is covered by a system consisting of several title deeds offering different rights of use, possession, ownership or alienation. Most titles are issued by the Land Department and fall within seven main categories. Another five categories are issued by other government departments for specific purposes. The Chanote (or Nor Sor 4 Jor) category, found in more developed parts of Thailand, offers private ownership (similar to freehold land). Other land is considered to belong to the government or the King of Thailand. =Intellectual property= Intellectual property law, that is patents, trademarks and copyright, are protected by the Patent Act BE 2522 (1979), Trademark Act BE 2534 (1991) and the Copyright Act BE 2537 (1994) and their amendments respectively. Trade secrets are protected by the Trade Secrets Act BE 2545 (2002). The Department of Intellectual Property (DIP) manages intellectual property matters such as registration and enforcement. A registration system exists for trademarks and patents. Copyright is automatically protected for 50 years and does not need registration, however it can be filed with the DIP. Disputes are first heard in the Intellectual Property and International Trade Court.  Patents Patent protection in Thailand aims to support innovators who introduce new proprietary technologies. A firm reaps several benefits from registering a patent. First, the parentee gets exclusive rights to shield himself from others making, using, selling, or distributing the invention or design without permission. Second, a granted patent increases business value. Third, a granted patent is enforceable. Patent protection helps a business gain a competitive advantage and helps it obtain a return on investment (ROI) to defray research and development costs.Thailand uses an \\"absolute novelty\\" and \\"first to file\\" patent system, making confidentiality a must until a patent application date is registered. Three types of patents can be granted: invention patents, petty patents, and design patents: = Invention patents = As with European patent law, Thai patent law, under Section 5 of the Patent Act 1979 (as amended in 1992, 1999), grants patents to an invention that (1) is non-obvious (involves an inventive step), (2) is novel, and (3) is capable of industrial application. Under Thai law, an innovation is understood to mean an invention step, if \\"it is not obvious to a person...skilled in the art.\\" According to the Manual of Patent and Petty Patent Applications Examination, \\"an invention must provide a benefit or improvement in occurrence of at least one of the following: # effect of design/form # task # selection # requirement of a problem and solution # effort # non-simplification # concentration of developmental steps # economic success # scientific technical research # progressive # achievements by the invention # non-exchangeable compounds # surprising results The invention patent confers an exclusivity period of 20 years from its registration date.  Software patents  Computer software is unpatentable under Thai Patent law. Section 9 of the Thai Patent Act 1999 states that Thai patent law does not include software (or computer programs) as patentable because computer software is not considered an \\"invention\\". Software is considered to be merely a set of instructions to a machine.Sirivish Toomgum and Kwanchai Rungfapaisan, The Nation, 24 July 2000. Software patents in Thailand have sparked software patent debates among economists and developers as there are two significant developments in international patent law: (1) the European Union's attempt to harmonize national patent laws by the Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and Council on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions, and (2) the US court decision to expand patent protection to business methods. Opinions are divided. Dr. Tangkitvanich, an IT specialist at the Thailand Development Research Institute (TDRI), raised the concern that Thailand is not ready for software patents as there were several flaws in patent rights. For example, the business method prevention has high tendency to hinder the growth in innovations especially for infant software companies. Moreover, the software patent may cause monopoly and innovation problems. \\"Monopoly will thwart innovations of new software products, particularly open- source software\\", said a group of Thai economists. However, Dr. Hirapruk who is the Director of Software Park Thailand, on the other hand, provides his support on allowing the computer programs to be patentable: \\"Thailand had to provide a patent-right protection for computer software to ensure foreign high-tech investors that software producers' creativity would be secured from violations in Thailand.\\" As a result, Mr. Sribhibhadh, president of the Association of the Thai Software Industry, emphasized that there will need to be a clear overview of the impact on the local industry if Thailand really had to fully implement the patent right protections. = Petty patents = A petty patent (known as a utility model in other countries) can be granted if an invention does not involve an inventive step, but is capable of industrial application. Unlike an invention patent, a petty patent has an exclusivity term of 10 years with an initial patent protection period of six years and two possible extensions of two years each. A petty patent is suitable for a new invention which would qualify for an invention patent except that it has no strong, technical innovative step. To be more specific, petty patents have been widely used among Thai companies, especially for manufacturing companies and inventors of less complicated inventions. This is because the petty patent has relatively simple criteria. = Design patents = A design patent is granted based on the ornamental aspects or aesthetics of an product, including features pertaining to its shape, configuration, or pattern. For example, it may be granted for new qualifying three-dimensional designs or two-dimensional designs. The length of patent protection is 10 years from registration date. Unlike an invention patent, the main benefit of a design patent is the less stringent requirements as it requires only novelty and capability of industrial application. In Thailand, design patents are popular in design- heavy industries such as car manufacturers, beverage companies, and furniture designers. =Family law= The main source of family law is the Civil and Commercial Code sections 1435 to 1598 (Book V). =Succession law= The main source of succession law is the Civil and Commercial Code sections 1599 to 1755 (Book VI). Laws relating to foreigners The Foreign Business Act of 1999 regulates foreign ownership of certain Thai industries and foreign companies. The Alien Business Law (N.E.C. Announcement 281) prohibits foreigners from holding certain professions which are reserved for Thai nationals.

Sitcoms can be contrasted with sketch comedy, where a troupe may use new characters in each sketch, and stand-up comedy, where a comedian tells jokes and stories to an audience. Sitcoms originated in radio, but today are found mostly on television as one of its dominant narrative forms. A situational comedy television programme may be recorded in front of a studio audience, depending on the programme's production format. The effect of a live studio audience can be imitated or enhanced by the use of a laugh track. During filming productions, the laugh track is usually pre-recorded. Critics disagree over the utility of the term \\"sitcom\\" in classifying shows that have come into existence since the turn of the century. Many contemporary American sitcoms use the single-camera setup and do not feature a laugh track, thus often resembling the dramedy shows of the 1980s and 1990s rather than the traditional sitcom.\\"The Evolution Of The Sitcom: The Age of the Single Camera\\". New York Film Academy, September 24, 2014. Other topics of debate have included whether or not cartoons, such as The Simpsons or Family Guy, can be classified as sitcoms.  History  The terms \\"situational comedy\\" or \\"sitcom\\" were not commonly used until the 1950s. There were prior examples on radio, but the first television sitcom is said to be Pinwright's Progress, ten episodes being broadcast on the BBC in the United Kingdom between 1946 and 1947. In the United States, director and producer William Asher has been credited with being the \\"man who invented the sitcom\\",\\"William Asher – The Man Who Invented the Sitcom\\", Palm Springs Life Dec. 1999 having directed over two dozen of the leading sitcoms, including I Love Lucy, from the 1950s through the 1970s.  By country  Australia = There have been few long-running Australian-made sitcoms, but many US and UK sitcoms have been successful there. Sitcoms are a staple of government broadcaster Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC); in the 1970s and 1980s many UK sitcoms also screened on the Seven Network. By 1986, UK comedies Bless This House and Are You Being Served? had been repeated by ABC Television several times, and were then acquired and screened by the Seven Network, in prime time.Collier, Shayne. Again and again and again. The Sydney Morning Herald – The Guide: 2 June 1986, p.1, 6.

Outrage, Number 177, 38-49. In 1987, Mother and Son was winner of the Television Drama Award presented by the Australian Human Rights Commission. In 2007, Kath & Kim's first episode of series four attracted an Australian audience of 2.521 million nationally, the highest rating ever for a first episode in the history of Australian television, until the series premiere of Underbelly: A Tale of Two Cities in 2009 with 2.58 million viewers. In 2013, Please Like Me received an invitation to screen at the Series Mania Television Festival in Paris, was praised by critics and has garnered numerous awards and nominations. Also in 2013, At Home With Julia was criticised by several social commentators as inappropriately disrespectful to the office of Prime Minister, the show nevertheless proved very popular both with television audiences — becoming the most watched Australian scripted comedy series of 2011 — and with television critics. Nominated to the 2012 Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts Awards for Best Television Comedy Series. = Canada = Although there have been a number of notable exceptions, Canadian television networks have generally fared poorly with their sitcom offerings, with relatively few Canadian sitcoms attaining notable success in Canada or internationally.\\"Why do Canadian sitcoms suck?\\". canada.com, March 21, 2014. According to television critic Bill Brioux, there are a number of structural reasons for this: the shorter seasons, typical of Canadian television production, make it harder for audiences to connect with a program before its season has concluded, and put even successful shows at risk of losing their audience between seasons because of the longer waiting time before a show returns with new episodes; the more limited marketing budgets available to Canadian television networks mean that audiences are less likely to be aware that the show exists in the first place; and the shows tend to resemble American sitcoms, in the hope of securing a lucrative sale to an American television network, even though by and large the Canadian sitcoms that have been successful have been ones, such as Corner Gas or King of Kensington, that had a more distinctively Canadian flavour. Conversely, however, Canadian television has had much greater success with sketch comedy and dramedy series. The popular show King of Kensington aired from 1975 to 1980, drawing 1.5 to 1.8 million viewers weekly at its peak. Corner Gas, which ran for six seasons from 2004 to 2009, became an instant hit, averaging a million viewers per episode. It has been the recipient of six Gemini Awards, and has been nominated almost 70 times for various awards. Other noteworthy recent sitcoms have included Call Me Fitz, Schitt's Creek,\\"The success of Schitt’s Creek marks a turning point for the CBC\\". The Globe and Mail, January 9, 2017. Letterkenny and Kim's Convenience,\\"CBC orders more Kim’s Convenience\\". Media in Canada, December 21, 2016. all of which have been winners of the Canadian Screen Award for Best Comedy Series. = India = Sitcoms started appearing on Indian television in the 1980s, with serials like Yeh Jo Hai Zindagi (1984) and Wagle Ki Duniya (1988) on the state-run Doordarshan channel. Gradually, as private channels were allowed, many more sitcoms followed in the 1990s, such as Dekh Bhai Dekh (1993), Zabaan Sambhalke (1993), Shrimaan Shrimati (1995), Office Office (2001), Ramani Vs Ramani (2001), Amrutham(Telugu - 2001), Khichdi (2002), Sarabhai vs Sarabhai (2005) to F.I.R. (2006–2015), Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah, (2008–present),Uppum Mulakum (2015–Present) , and \\"Bhabiji Ghar Par Hain\\" (2015–present).SAB TV is one of the leading channels of India dedicated entirely to Sitcoms. Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah is the longest running sitcom of Indian television and is known as the flagship show of SAB TV.https://www.televisionpost.com/tmkoc-the-journey-of-indias-longest-running- tv-show/ = Mexico = El Chavo del Ocho, which ran from 1971 to 1980, was the most watched show in the Mexican television and had a Latin American audience of 350 million viewers per episode at its peak of popularity during the mid-1970s. The show continues to be popular in Hispanic America as well as in Brazil, Spain, the United States, and other countries, with syndicated episodes averaging 91 million daily viewers in all of the markets where it is distributed in the Americas. Since it ceased production in 1992, the show has earned an estimated billion in syndication fees alone for Televisa. = New Zealand = Gliding On, a popular sit-com in New Zealand in the early 1980s, won multiple awards over the course of its run, including Best Comedy, Best Drama and Best Direction at the Feltex Awards. = Russia = The first Russian sitcom series was \\"Strawberry\\" (resembled \\"Duty Pharmacy\\" in Spanish format), which was aired in 1996–1997 on the RTR channel. However, the \\"boom\\" of Russian sitcoms began only in the 2000s — when in 2004, the STS started very successful sitcom \\"My Fair Nanny\\" (an adaptation of the American sitcom \\"The Nanny\\"). Since that time sitcoms in Russia were produced by the two largest entertainment channels of the country — STS and TNT. In 2007 the STS released the first original domestic sitcom — \\"Daddy's Daughters\\" (there were only adaptation before), and in 2010 TNT released \\"Interns (sitcom)\\" — the first sitcom, filmed as a comedy (unlike dominated \\"conveyor\\" sitcoms). = United Kingdom = Although styles of sitcom have changed over the years they tend to be based on a family, workplace or other institution, where the same group of contrasting characters is brought together in each episode. British sitcoms are typically produced in one or more series of six episodes. Most such series are conceived and developed by one or two writers. The majority of British sitcoms are 30 minutes long and are recorded on studio sets in a multiple-camera setup. A subset of British comedy consciously avoids traditional situation comedy themes and storylines to branch out into more unusual topics or narrative methods. Blackadder (1983–1989) and Yes Minister/Yes Prime Minister (1980–1988, 2013) moved what is often a domestic or workplace genre into the corridors of power. A later development was the mockumentary in such series as The Office (2001–2003, 2013). Also coming of age in such series as The Inbetweeners (2008-2010). = United States = Most American sitcoms are generally written to run a total of 22 minutes in length, leaving eight minutes for advertisements in a 30 minute timeslot.How Sitcoms Work, page 3. Some popular British shows have been successfully adapted for the US.When British TV flies across the pond. CNN.com, April 6, 2012. Retrieved October 15, 2013. Some of the most successful American sitcoms of the 1970s, including All in the Family, Three's Company, and Sanford and Son, were adapted from British productions.  Sitcoms on US radio  Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll of Amos 'n' Andy in 1929 The sitcom format was born in January 1926 with the initial broadcast of Sam 'n' Henry on WGN radio in Chicago, Illinois. The 15-minute daily program was revamped in 1928, moved to another station, renamed Amos 'n' Andy, and became one of the most successful sitcoms of the period. It was also one of the earliest examples of radio syndication. Like many radio programs of the time, the two programs continued the American entertainment traditions of vaudeville and the minstrel show. Early sitcoms took the forms of recurring comedy sketches with running characters, which on national network shows often took the form of a broader variety show with vocal and instrumental music performances padding out a half-hour time slot. The Jack Benny Program, a radio-TV comedy series that ran for more than three decades, is generally regarded as a high-water mark in 20th-century American comedy. Fibber McGee and Molly was one of radio's most popular sitcoms of the 1940s. The weekly half-hour domestic sitcom starring real-life husband and wife Jim Jordan and Marian Driscoll ran from 1935 to 1956 on NBC.  Sitcoms on US television =1940s= Mary Kay and Johnny, aired from 1947 to 1950, was the first sitcom broadcast on network television in the United States and was the first program to show a couple sharing a bed, and the first series to show a woman's pregnancy on television. =1950s= The main cast of The Honeymooners in 1955 I Love Lucy, which originally ran from 1951 to 1957 on CBS, was the most watched show in the United States in four of its six seasons, and was the first to end its run at the top of the Nielsen ratings (an accomplishment later matched only by The Andy Griffith Show in 1968 and Seinfeld in 1998). The show is still syndicated in dozens of languages across the world, and remains popular, with an American audience of 40 million each year. Colourised edits of episodes from the original series have aired semi-annually on the network since 2013, six decades after the series aired. It is often regarded as one of the greatest and most influential sitcoms in history. In 2012, it was voted the 'Best TV Show of All Time' in a survey conducted by ABC News and People Magazine. The Honeymooners debuted as a half-hour series on 1955 and was originally aired on the DuMont network's Cavalcade of Stars and subsequently on the CBS network's The Jackie Gleason Show, which was filmed in front of a live audience. Although initially a ratings success—becoming the No. 2 show in the United States during its first season—it faced stiff competition from The Perry Como Show, and eventually dropped to No. 19,Brooks; Marsh, \\"Top-Rated Programs by Season\\", p.1245 ending its production after only 39 episodes (now referred to as the \\"Classic 39\\"). The final episode of The Honeymooners aired on September 22, 1956. Creator/producer Jackie Gleason revived The Honeymooners sporadically until 1978. The Honeymooners was one of the first U.S. television shows to portray working class married couples in a gritty, non-idyllic manner (the show is set mostly in the Kramdens' kitchen, in a neglected Brooklyn apartment building).Conner (2010), Sitcoms Often Reinforce Racial Ethnic Stereotypes Steven Sheehan explains the popularity of The Honeymooners as the embodiment of working-class masculinity in the character of Ralph Kramden, and postwar ideals in American society regarding work, housing, consumerism, and consumer satisfaction. The series demonstrated visually the burdens of material obligations and participation in consumer culture, as well as the common use of threats of domestic violence in working class households.Steven T. Sheehan, \\"'Pow! Right in the Kisser': Ralph Kramden, Jackie Gleason, and the Emergence of the Frustrated Working-Class Man, Journal of Popular Culture, June 2010, Vol. 43#3 pgs. 564-82 Art Carney won five Emmy Awards for his portrayal of Ed Norton — two for the original Jackie Gleason Show, one for The Honeymooners, and two for the final version of The Jackie Gleason Show. He was nominated for another two (1957, 1966) but lost. Gleason and Audrey Meadows were both nominated in 1956 for their work on The Honeymooners. Meadows was also nominated for Emmys for her portrayal of Alice Kramden in 1954 and 1957. In 1997, the episodes \\"The $99,000 Answer\\" and \\"TV or Not TV\\" were respectively ranked No. 6 and No. 26 on \\"TV Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time\\" and in 1999, TV Guide published a list titled \\"TV's 100 Greatest Characters Ever!\\" Ed Norton was No. 20, and Ralph Kramden was No. 2.

Sanford and Son, which ran from 1972 to 1977, was included on the Time magazine's list of the \\"100 Best TV Shows of All Time\\" in 2007. All in the Family, premiered on January 1971, is often regarded in the United States as one of the greatest television series of all time. Following a lackluster first season, the show became the most watched show in the United States during summer re-runs and afterwards ranked number one in the yearly Nielsen ratings from 1971 to 1976. It became the first television series to reach the milestone of having topped the Nielsen ratings for five consecutive years. The episode \\"Sammy's Visit\\" was ranked number 13 on TV Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time. TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time ranked All in the Family as number four. Bravo also named the show's protagonist, Archie Bunker, TV's greatest character of all time.

One Day at a Time is a situation comedy developed by Norman Lear. The show aired on CBS and ran from December, 1975 until May, 1984. It followed a recently divorced mother and her two daughters as they dealt with the problems and situations that come with growing up, and raising kids in a single parent household. It is the first show to feature Valerie Bertinelli, and emphasised her character as the show progressed. =1980s= The main cast of Seinfeld, which aired from 1989 to 1998 on NBC Cheers, which ran for eleven seasons, was one of the most successful sitcoms in the 80s, airing from 1982 to 1993. It was followed by a spin-off sitcom in the 90s, Frasier. During its run, Cheers became one of the most popular series of all time and has received critical acclaim.

Also known as the white-bellied pangolin or three-cusped pangolin, it is the most common of the African forest pangolins. Description Phataginus tricuspis is a relatively small pangolin. The combined head and body length is . The tail is . Each scale has three points, to which the specific name tricuspis refers. The head is small, and the snout is elongated. The feet are short, and each foot has five long curved claws. Taxonomy The tree pangolin had belonged to the genus Manis and subgenus Phataginus before Phataginus was elevated to generic status. Two subspecies were recognized in 1972 by Meester: *P. t. tricuspisRafinesque CS (1821). Ann. Sci. Phys. Brux. 7: 215.

Skull of a tree pangolin Range and habitat The tree pangolin ranges from Guinea through Sierra Leone and much of West Africa to Central Africa as far east as extreme southwestern Kenya and northwestern Tanzania. To the south, it extends to northern Angola and northwestern Zambia. It has been found on the Atlantic island of Bioko, but no records confirm a presence in Senegal, Gambia, or Guinea-Bissau.Tree pangolins are native to parts of Angola, Benin, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Republic of Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Côte d'Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, Nigeria, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, and Zambia. They may be present in Burundi. The tree pangolin is semiarboreal and generally nocturnal. It is found in lowland tropical moist forests (both primary and secondary), as well as savanna/forest mosaics. It probably adapts to some degree to habitat modification, as it favours cultivated and fallow land where it is not aggressively hunted (e.g., abandoned or little-used oil palm trees in secondary growth). Behavior Climbing a tree The tree pangolin can walk on all fours or on its hind legs using its prehensile tail for balance. It can climb up trees in the absence of branches. When walking on all fours, it walks on its front knuckles with its claws tucked underneath to protect them from wearing down. Its anal scent glands disperse a foul secretion much like a skunk when threatened. It has a well-developed sense of smell, but as a nocturnal animal, it has poor eyesight. Instead of teeth, it has a gizzard-like stomach full of stones and sand it ingests. The tree pangolin in Africa fills its stomach with air before entering water to aid in buoyancy for well-developed swimming. The tree pangolin has many adaptations. When threatened, it rolls up into a ball (\\"volvation\\"), protecting itself with its thick skin and scales. Its scales cover its entire body except for the belly, snout, eyes, ears, and undersides of the limbs. When a mother with young is threatened, she rolls up around the young, which also roll into a ball. While in a ball, she can extend her scales and make a cutting action by using muscles to move the scales back and forth. She makes an aggressive huff noise when threatened, but that is the extent of her noise-making. Diet The tree pangolin eats insects such as ants and termites from their nests, or the armies of insects moving on the trees. It relies on its thick skin for protection, and digs into burrows with its long, clawed forefeet. It eats between 5 and 7 ounces (150 to 200 g) of insects a day. The pangolin uses its 10- to 27-in (250- to 700-mm) tongue which is coated with gummy mucus to funnel the insects into its mouth. The tongue is actually sheathed in the chest cavity all the way to the pelvic area. Reproduction Female pangolin territories are solitary and small, less than 10 acres (4 ha), and they rarely overlap. Males have larger territories, up to 60 acres (24 ha), which overlap many female territories, resulting in male/female meetings. These meetings are brief unless the female is in estrus, when mating occurs. Gestation of young lasts 150 days, and one young per birth is normal. The young pangolin is carried on its mother's tail until it is weaned after three months, but it remains with its mother for five months in total. At first, the newborn's scales are soft, but, after a few days, they start to harden. Use by humans The tree pangolin is subject to widespread and often intensive exploitation for bushmeat and traditional medicine, and is by far the most common of the pangolins found in African bushmeat markets. Conservationists believe this species underwent a decline of 20–25% between 1993 and 2008 (three pangolin generations) due mainly to the impact of the bushmeat hunting. They assert it continues to be harvested at unsustainable levels in some of its range, and by 2008 had elevated its status from \\"Least Concern\\" to \\"Near Threatened\\".Pangolin Specialist Group (2008).

The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters.Henderson, J. (1993) Comic Hero versus Political Elite pp. 307–19 in The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a \\"Society of Youth\\" and a \\"Society of the Old.\\"(Anatomy of Criticism, 1957) A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter.Marteinson, 2006 Satire and political satire use comedy to portray persons or social institutions as ridiculous or corrupt, thus alienating their audience from the object of their humor. Parody subverts popular genres and forms, critiquing those forms without necessarily condemning them. Other forms of comedy include screwball comedy, which derives its humor largely from bizarre, surprising (and improbable) situations or characters, and black comedy, which is characterized by a form of humor that includes darker aspects of human behavior or human nature. Similarly scatological humor, sexual humor, and race humor create comedy by violating social conventions or taboos in comic ways. A comedy of manners typically takes as its subject a particular part of society (usually upper-class society) and uses humor to parody or satirize the behavior and mannerisms of its members. Romantic comedy is a popular genre that depicts burgeoning romance in humorous terms and focuses on the foibles of those who are falling in love. Etymology Ancient Greek Theatre represented in the Hadrian's Villa mosaic The word \\"comedy\\" is derived from the Classical Greek κωμῳδία kōmōidía, which is a compound of κῶμος kômos (revel) and ᾠδή ōidḗ (singing; ode). \\"The old derivation from kome \\"village\\" is not now regarded.\\" The adjective \\"comic\\" (Greek κωμικός kōmikós), which strictly means that which relates to comedy is, in modern usage, generally confined to the sense of \\"laughter-provoking\\".Cornford (1934) Of this, the word came into modern usage through the Latin comoedia and Italian commedia and has, over time, passed through various shades of meaning.Oxford English Dictionary The Greeks and Romans confined their use of the word \\"comedy\\" to descriptions of stage-plays with happy endings. Aristotle defined comedy as an imitation of men worse than the average (where tragedy was an imitation of men better than the average). However, the characters portrayed in comedies were not worse than average in every way, only insofar as they are Ridiculous, which is a species of the Ugly. The Ridiculous may be defined as a mistake or deformity not productive of pain or harm to others; the mask, for instance, that excites laughter is something ugly and distorted without causing pain.McKeon, Richard. The Basic Works Of Aristotle, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 2001, p. 1459. In the Middle Ages, the term expanded to include narrative poems with happy endings. It is in this sense that Dante used the term in the title of his poem, La Commedia. As time progressed, the word came more and more to be associated with any sort of performance intended to cause laughter. During the Middle Ages, the term \\"comedy\\" became synonymous with satire, and later with humour in general. Aristotle's Poetics was translated into Arabic in the medieval Islamic world, where it was elaborated upon by Arabic writers and Islamic philosophers, such as Abu Bishr, and his pupils Al-Farabi, Avicenna, and Averroes. They disassociated comedy from Greek dramatic representation and instead identified it with Arabic poetic themes and forms, such as hija (satirical poetry). They viewed comedy as simply the \\"art of reprehension\\", and made no reference to light and cheerful events, or to the troubling beginnings and happy endings associated with classical Greek comedy. After the Latin translations of the 12th century, the term \\"comedy\\" gained a more general meaning in medieval literature. In the late 20th century, many scholars preferred to use the term laughter to refer to the whole gamut of the comic, in order to avoid the use of ambiguous and problematically defined genres such as the grotesque, irony, and satire.Herman Braet, Guido Latré, Werner Verbeke (2003) Risus mediaevalis: laughter in medieval literature and art p.1 quotation: Ménard, Philippe (1988) Le rire et le sourire au Moyen Age dans la littérature et les arts. Essai de problématique in Bouché, T. and Charpentier H. (eds., 1988) Le rire au Moyen Âge, Actes du colloque international de Bordeaux, pp. 7–30 HistoryWestern history of comedy= Dionysiac origins, Aristophanes and Aristotle  Roman-era mosaic depicting a scene from Menander's comedy Samia (\\"The Woman from Samos\\") Starting from 425 BCE, Aristophanes, a comic playwright and satirical author of the Ancient Greek Theater, wrote 40 comedies, 11 of which survive. Aristophanes developed his type of comedy from the earlier satyr plays, which were often highly obscene.Aristophanes (1996) Lysistrata, Introduction, p.ix, published by Nick Hern Books The only surviving examples of the satyr plays are by Euripides, which are much later examples and not representative of the genre.Reckford, Kenneth J. (1987)Aristophanes' Old-and-new Comedy: Six essays in perspective p.105 In ancient Greece, comedy originated in bawdy and ribald songs or recitations apropos of phallic processions and fertility festivals or gatherings.Cornford, F.M. (1934) The Origin of Attic Comedy pp.3-4 quotation: Around 335 BCE, Aristotle, in his work Poetics, stated that comedy originated in phallic processions and the light treatment of the otherwise base and ugly. He also adds that the origins of comedy are obscure because it was not treated seriously from its inception. However, comedy had its own Muse: Thalia. Aristotle taught that comedy was generally positive for society, since it brings forth happiness, which for Aristotle was the ideal state, the final goal in any activity. For Aristotle, a comedy did not need to involve sexual humor. A comedy is about the fortunate rise of a sympathetic character. Aristotle divides comedy into three categories or subgenres: farce, romantic comedy, and satire. On the contrary, Plato taught that comedy is a destruction to the self. He believed that it produces an emotion that overrides rational self-control and learning. In The Republic, he says that the guardians of the state should avoid laughter, \\"for ordinarily when one abandons himself to violent laughter, his condition provokes a violent reaction.\\" Plato says comedy should be tightly controlled if one wants to achieve the ideal state. Also in Poetics, Aristotle defined comedy as one of the original four genres of literature. The other three genres are tragedy, epic poetry, and lyric poetry. Literature, in general, is defined by Aristotle as a mimesis, or imitation of life. Comedy is the third form of literature, being the most divorced from a true mimesis. Tragedy is the truest mimesis, followed by epic poetry, comedy, and lyric poetry. The genre of comedy is defined by a certain pattern according to Aristotle's definition. Comedies begin with low or base characters seeking insignificant aims and end with some accomplishment of the aims which either lightens the initial baseness or reveals the insignificance of the aims.  Commedia dell'arte and Shakespearean, Elizabethan comedy  Title page of the first quarto of Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream (1600) \\"Comedy\\", in its Elizabethan usage, had a very different meaning from modern comedy. A Shakespearean comedy is one that has a happy ending, usually involving marriages between the unmarried characters, and a tone and style that is more light-hearted than Shakespeare's other plays.Regan, Richard. \\"Shakespearean comedy\\" The Punch and Judy show has roots in the 16th-century Italian commedia dell'arte. The figure of Punch derives from the Neapolitan stock character of Pulcinella. The figure who later became Mr. Punch made his first recorded appearance in England in 1662. Punch and Judy are performed in the spirit of outrageous comedy — often provoking shocked laughter — and are dominated by the anarchic clowning of Mr. Punch. Appearing at a significant period in British history, professor Glyn Edwards states: \\"[Pulcinella] went down particularly well with Restoration British audiences, fun-starved after years of Puritanism. We soon changed Punch's name, transformed him from a marionette to a hand puppet, and he became, really, a spirit of Britain — a subversive maverick who defies authority, a kind of puppet equivalent to our political cartoons.\\"  19th to early 20th century  In early 19th century England, pantomime acquired its present form which includes slapstick comedy and featured the first mainstream clown Joseph Grimaldi, while comedy routines also featured heavily in British music hall theatre which became popular in the 1850s.Jeffrey Richards (2014). \\"The Golden Age of Pantomime: Slapstick, Spectacle and Subversion in Victorian England\\". I.B.Tauris, British comedians who honed their skills in music hall sketches include Charlie Chaplin, Stan Laurel and Dan Leno. English music hall comedian and theatre impresario Fred Karno developed a form of sketch comedy without dialogue in the 1890s, and Chaplin and Laurel were among the comedians who worked for his company.McCabe, John. \\"Comedy World of Stan Laurel\\". p. 143. London: Robson Books, 2005, First edition 1975 Karno was a pioneer of slapstick, and in his biography, Laurel stated, \\"Fred Karno didn't teach Charlie [Chaplin] and me all we know about comedy. He just taught us most of it\\". Film producer Hal Roach stated: \\"Fred Karno is not only a genius, he is the man who originated slapstick comedy. We in Hollywood owe much to him.\\"J. P. Gallagher (1971). \\"Fred Karno: master of mirth and tears\\". p. 165. Hale. American vaudeville emerged in the 1880s and remained popular until the 1930s, and featured comedians such as W. C. Fields, Buster Keaton and the Marx Brothers. 20th century theatre and art Surreal humour (also known as 'absurdist humour'), or 'surreal comedy', is a form of humour predicated on deliberate violations of causal reasoning, producing events and behaviours that are obviously illogical. Constructions of surreal humour tend to involve bizarre juxtapositions, incongruity, non-sequiturs, irrational or absurd situations and expressions of nonsense. The humour arises from a subversion of audience's expectations, so that amusement is founded on unpredictability, separate from a logical analysis of the situation. The humour derived gets its appeal from the ridiculousness and unlikeliness of the situation. The genre has roots in Surrealism in the arts. Edward Lear, Aged 73 and a Half and His Cat Foss, Aged 16, an 1885 lithograph by Edward Lear Surreal humour is the effect of illogic and absurdity being used for humorous effect. Under such premises, people can identify precursors and early examples of surreal humour at least since the 19th century, such as Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass, which both use illogic and absurdity (hookah- smoking caterpillars, croquet matches using live flamingos as mallets, etc.) for humorous effect. Many of Edward Lear's children stories and poems contain nonsense and are basically surreal in approach. For example, The Story of the Four Little Children Who Went Round the World (1871) is filled with contradictory statements and odd images intended to provoke amusement, such as the following: In the early 20th century, several avant-garde movements, including the dadaists, surrealists, and futurists, began to argue for an art that was random, jarring and illogical. The goals of these movements were in some sense serious, and they were committed to undermining the solemnity and self-satisfaction of the contemporary artistic establishment. As a result, much of their art was intentionally amusing. A famous example is Marcel Duchamp's Fountain (1917), an inverted urinal signed \\"R. Mutt\\". This became one of the most famous and influential pieces of art in history, and one of the earliest examples of the found object movement. It is also a joke, relying on the inversion of the item's function as expressed by its title as well as its incongruous presence in an art exhibition.  20th century film, records, radio, and television  Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis (ca. 1950) Jim Carrey mugs for the camera Rowan Atkinson as Mr. Bean Jackie Chan at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival Stand-up comedian Margaret Cho Popov the Clown in 2009 Barry Humphries in character in London as \\"Dame Edna Everage\\" on the day of 2011 Wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton Jordan Peele at the Peabody awards. The advent of cinema in the late 19th century, and later radio and television in the 20th century broadened the access of comedians to the general public. Charlie Chaplin, through silent film, became one of the best- known faces on Earth. The silent tradition lived on well into the 20th century through mime artists like Marcel Marceau, and the physical comedy of artists like Rowan Atkinson as Mr. Bean. The tradition of the circus clown also continued, with such as Bozo the Clown in the United States and Oleg Popov in Russia. Radio provided new possibilities — with Britain producing the influential surreal humour of the Goon Show after the Second World War. The Goons' influence spread to the American radio and recording troupe the Firesign Theatre. American cinema has produced a great number of globally renowned comedy artists, from Laurel and Hardy, the Three Stooges, Abbott and Costello, Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, as well as Bob Hope during the mid-20th century, to performers like George Carlin, Robin Williams, and Eddie Murphy at the end of the century. Hollywood attracted many international talents like the British comics Peter Sellers, Dudley Moore and Sacha Baron Cohen, Canadian comics Dan Aykroyd, Jim Carrey, and Mike Myers, and the Australian comedian Paul Hogan, famous for Crocodile Dundee. Other centres of creative comic activity have been the cinema of Hong Kong, Bollywood, and French farce. American television has also been an influential force in world comedy: with American series like M*A*S*H, Seinfeld and The Simpsons achieving large followings around the world. British television comedy also remains influential, with quintessential works including Fawlty Towers, Monty Python, Dad's Army, Blackadder, and The Office. Australian satirist Barry Humphries, whose comic creations include the housewife and \\"gigastar\\" Dame Edna Everage, for his delivery of Dadaist and absurdist humour to millions, was described by biographer Anne Pender in 2010 as not only \\"the most significant theatrical figure of our time ... [but] the most significant comedian to emerge since Charlie Chaplin\\". =Non-Western history of comedy= Classical Sanskrit Dramas, Plays, and Epics of Ancient India  By 200 BC, in ancient Sanskrit drama, Bharata Muni's Natya Shastra defined humour (hāsyam) as one of the nine nava rasas, or principle rasas (emotional responses), which can be inspired in the audience by bhavas, the imitations of emotions that the actors perform. Each rasa was associated with a specific bhavas portrayed on stage. In the case of humour, it was associated with mirth (hasya).  Studies on comic theory  The phenomena connected with laughter and that which provokes it have been carefully investigated by psychologists. They agree the predominant characteristics are incongruity or contrast in the object and shock or emotional seizure on the part of the subject. It has also been held that the feeling of superiority is an essential factor: thus Thomas Hobbes speaks of laughter as a \\"sudden glory\\". Modern investigators have paid much attention to the origin both of laughter and of smiling, as well as the development of the \\"play instinct\\" and its emotional expression. George Meredith said that \\"One excellent test of the civilization of a country ... I take to be the flourishing of the Comic idea and Comedy, and the test of true Comedy is that it shall awaken thoughtful laughter.\\" Laughter is said to be the cure for being sick. Studies show that people who laugh more often get sick less. American literary theorist Kenneth Burke writes that the \\"comic frame\\" in rhetoric is \\"neither wholly euphemistic, nor wholly debunking—hence it provides the charitable attitude towards people that is required for purposes of persuasion and co-operation, but at the same time maintains our shrewdness concerning the simplicities of ‘cashing in.’\\" The purpose of the comic frame is to satirize a given circumstance and promote change by doing so. The comic frame makes fun of situations and people, while simultaneously provoking thought. The comic frame does not aim to vilify in its analysis, but rather, rebuke the stupidity and foolery of those involved in the circumstances. For example, on The Daily Show, Jon Stewart uses the \\"comic frame\\" to intervene in political arguments, often offering crude humor in sudden contrast to serious news. In a segment on President Obama's trip to China Stewart remarks on America's debt to the Chinese government while also having a weak relationship with the country. After depicting this dismal situation, Stewart shifts to speak directly to President Obama, calling upon him to \\"shine that turd up.\\"Trischa Goodnow Knapp (2011). The Daily Show and Rhetoric: Arguments, Issues, and Strategies. p. 327. Lexington Books, 2011 For Stewart and his audience, introducing coarse language into what is otherwise a serious commentary on the state of foreign relations serves to frame the segment comically, creating a serious tone underlying the comedic agenda presented by Stewart.  Forms  Comedy may be divided into multiple genres based on the source of humor, the method of delivery, and the context in which it is delivered. The different forms of comedy often overlap, and most comedy can fit into multiple genres. Some of the subgenres of comedy are farce, comedy of manners, burlesque, and satire. Some comedy apes certain cultural forms: for instance, parody and satire often imitate the conventions of the genre they are parodying or satirizing. For example, in the United States, parodies of newspapers and television news include The Onion, and The Colbert Report; in Australia, shows such as Kath & Kim, Utopia, and Shaun Micallef's Mad As Hell perform the same role. Self-deprecation is a technique of comedy used by many comedians who focus on their misfortunes and foibles in order to entertain.

Discovery and development  It was first observed by accident by Mike MarchywkaUnited States Patent Number 5269890 while trying to find a selective means to etch non-diamond carbon and fabricate simple astronomical UV detection devices. full text These devices required a few specific features such as clean surfaces and patterned areas of non-diamond carbon but the approach has subsequently been explored as a more general means to terminate carbon surfaces and selectively clean and etch various other materials or structures. The term \\"Marchywka effect\\" is not used consistently and sometimes the term \\"bipolar surface treatment\\" is usedPleskov, YV \\"The Electrochemistry of Diamond\\" in Alkire, RC; Kolb, DM ed(2003). Advances In Electrochemical Science and Engineering pg 224 (Wiley-VCH). , as the substrate is induced to become a bipolar electrode. Various phrases such as \\"non-contacted electrochemical\\" process may also be used( see any references cited herein) or it may be mentioned as just an \\"electrochemical etch\\".D'Evelyn MP \\"Surface Properties of Diamond\\" in Prelas, Popovici, Bigelow ed(1997). Handbook of Industrial Diamonds and Diamond Films (CRC Press). , While this is easily confused with various common electrochemical cells, and may appear to be a trivial and obvious extension of well known methods, recent patents continue to reference prior work that cites non-contactedness as a feature. The use of a low conductivity medium as used in Marchywka et al.'s original paper is sometimes noted when it is used and may produce new effects. The apparatus to create the effect is similar to the well-known electroporation system except that the biological specimen is replaced with an inorganic substrate, although, in some cases, organic films can be etched with this process using a surfactant solution as the electrolyte.  Surface effects  240pxthumbleft  Figure 1c in Marchywka et al. 1993. Annular ring of semi-insulating diamond with discontiguous conducting graphitized regions etched with the non-contacted electrochemical process. This photograph shows disconnected conducting regions etched into a semi-insulating diamond subsrtate Such a pattern would not be possible with traditional electrochemical etching. As a \\"non-contact\\" process, the effect differs from traditional electrochemical processes where carrier flow through the surface is achieved by connection to a current source with highly conductive materials such as copper wire. It is well known that materials contacted to an anode can be modified in a variety of ways including anodizing and electropolishing. Electrochemistry was quickly recognized as an important related field in the popular press once the first synthetic diamonds were made. However, the use of an induced field created by remote electrodes allows discontinuous areas on an insulating substrate to be cleaned, modified, or etched (similar to electroetching), greatly expanding the role of electrochemical methods. The mechanism is presumed to be due to the induced field but little in the way of exhaustive analysis has been done, as the actual processes do not appear to differ from traditional approaches. For example, \\"identified as the ‘Marchywka Effect’ in the literature. The etching may be due to the galvanic coupling of diamond and non-diamond carbon\\". The applied field apparently creates directed surface modifications on polished diamond surfaces with little or no actual removal of material. This may be desirable for making various devices, or simply studying the properties of the diamond surface. The induced field deposits or replaces a single layer of some molecule and this could be thought of as a monolayer electroplating method. It has been elucidated in more fully in many works. full text  Earlier related approaches  From Pehrsson et al., bipolar treated diamond surface under SEM. The uniform SQUARE diamond plate acquires 3 distinct zones under the SEM after being exposed to the bipolar surface treatment. This diamond had been exposed to an applied field in distilled water creating a black (bottom), bright (middle) and grey (top) region. The contrast appears to be due to changes in surface termination as described in Pehrsson et al. Many prior technologies exist for preparing wide-gap diamond for use in electronic devices or as a substrate for single-crystal diamond growth. The more stable forms of carbon have lower gaps and different crystal structures, and their presence must be carefully controlled. The Marchywka Effect has been characterised and compared to alternative means to create a desired surface for several applications. Removal of non-diamond carbon with wet chemicals had been accomplished by boiling in mixtures of sulphuric and chromic acid. When applied to a diamond substrate with an ion implantation damage profile as may be used for basic science, crystal growth, or device fabrication,United States Patent Number 5385762 the electrochemical approach makes it easier to preserve the thin film of less damaged diamond lying above the implant range, and it has been used in annealing experiments to fix the diamond after implantation damage has occurred. In some cases, thermal cycling may be an issue and selectivity to various masks may be important, so the lower temperatures and more flexible chemistry may offer benefits over prior art. The method does not require the use of non-volatile materials such as chrome, possibly reducing contamination problems in some applications. The ability to control the etching direction and speed with an applied voltage or electrode configuration, as with electrochemical machining, gives additional capabilities not available with isotropic chemical-only approaches. Dry processing methods such as hot oxygen or plasmas can also burn off the graphite faster than the diamond, as can a simple acetylene torch. These require higher temperatures and do not have the same high selectivity that can be achieved with the electrochemical approach. Surface termination is often an issue with both solid state and vacuum devices, and the details of final surface band structure have been compared with alternatives in various device structures.Characterization of cobalt- diamond (100) interfaces: electron affinity and Schottky barrier  Applications  While the original effort failed to produce useful products, follow-on work in Europe did produce usable astronomical detectorsHochedez publication list but without apparent use of this technology. In other areas, however, the approach seems to be competitive, with prior art for making various end-products, since it has been used as a fabrication step for experimental devices and structures. Many groups have used the approach to grow homoepitaxial diamond and subsequently release the thin-films with a variety of \\"lift-off\\" processes. It has also been considered in contexts such as carbon microelectromechanical systems production and different materials applications, for example with non-contacted palladium deposition and extensions.United States Patent Number 7435324 While not citing Marchywka et al.'s original paper, these continue to cite non-contactedness as a feature, \\"The electrode assembly and the conductive surface may be positioned in close proximity to, but without contacting, one another\\". references a much earlier patentUnited States Patent Number 4153531 covering related attempts to achieve non-contacted electro-etching, \\"The present invention relates to a method of and apparatus for electrochemically processing metallic surfaces of workpieces arranged in a contact-free manner with regard to the cathode and anode[...].\\" The effect has been mentioned in passing with regard to novel devices such as quantum coherent devices while patents on emerging uses for amorphous carbon United States Patent Number 7521304 United States Patent Number 7084071 and diamond thermal conductorsUnited States Patent Number 7501330 by manufacturers of high density electronic chips reference the related lift-off technology.

The blue equilibrium is not subgame perfect because player two makes a non-credible threat at 2(2) to be unkind (U). A non-credible threat is a term used in game theory and economics to describe a threat in a sequential game that a rational player would actually not carry out, because it would not be in his best interest to do so. For a simple example, suppose person A walks up, carrying a bomb, to another person B. A tells B he will set off the bomb, killing them both, unless B gives him all his money. If A is rational and non-suicidal he stands nothing to gain from setting off the bomb, so his threat cannot be considered credible. On the other hand, a person in the situation of B might give A his money, fearing that A is not rational, or might even be suicidal. A non-credible threat is made on the hope that it will be believed, and therefore the threatening undesirable action will not need to be carried out. For a threat to be credible within an equilibrium, whenever a node is reached where a threat should be fulfilled, it will be fulfilled. Those Nash equilibria that rely on non-credible threats can be eliminated through backward induction; the remaining equilibria are called subgame perfect Nash equilibria.

Though his origins and early life are cloaked in mystery and debate, it is thought that by 1775, he was an active colonial loyalist. He eventually donned a uniform when he joined the King's American Regiment. After the Treaty of Paris in 1783, Long left for Canada as a refugee where he was granted land by the British Crown for his military service. His descendants are numerous and live all over North America today. Early life Although controversial, 1742 is a likely birth year of Philip Long based on information in his death certificate in 1832 and the 1831 Census in Clair, New Brunswick. Oral history seems to point to his possible birth in Europe. He is said to be of Scottish ancestry, to have immigrated to the North American Continent in the New England area, and to have likely lived in Philadelphia. There is no documentary evidence to support this oral history at this time. Another possible birth year of 1757 was deduced by Mgr. Lang based on oral history whereby Philip Long committed an act of bravery (for which there is documentary evidence) at the age of 18 (note: there is no documentary evidence for this age), and that he committed this act in 1775. The latter year is referenced by Philip Long in one of his letters as the year where \\"Since the year 1775, for my King and country …\\". However, there is real uncertainty that Philip was in fact referring to the year when he committed his act of bravery. Instead, it is more likely that he was referring to the beginning of his expressed Loyalism to the Crown. The year 1757 is inconsistent with the documentary evidence uncovered to date.

We believe that this date is more consistent with Philip's earliest moment of his expression of loyalty to his King and Country, either informally or through the accepted standard at the time, that is, an oath of loyalty. There is no documentary evidence to support either view at this time. It is the only date of great significance that Philip ever wrote about in all of his known correspondence.  1776  November 7, 1776 - Birth of Marie-Julie Josephte Couillard-Després in Montmagny, Quebec on November 7, 1776.

Philip Long is listed as Private. September 15, 1783 - The KAR was transported to Saint John, New Brunswick in the last few ships of what is called the Fall Fleet. It is likely that Philip Long was transported on either the King George (275 tons with 140 members of the KAR); or the William (282 tons with 161 members of the KAR). They were supposed to have left New York on the 3rd but instead their departure was delayed until September 15. The William arrived at St. John on September 27, 1783. The King George arrived at St. John on September 30, 1783. The returns show that the KAR comprised 10 Companies, 20 Surgeons, 208 Regular Soldiers of Foot and 22 Officers. October 23, 1783 - The KAR is decommissioned at St. John's, in the future Province of New Brunswick. Every soldier is given two weeks of pay. = 1784-1789 Loyalist settler and courier= January, 1784 – The tracts of land up the St John River were allocated to the various Regiments. Block No. 6 (also confusingly referred to as No. 4!), Canterbury, was assigned to the King's American Regiment, and was ultimately granted to Tristram Hillman and 62 others (including Philip Long), on August 17, 1787. However, the members of the KAR would have known since January 1784 that Block No. 6 was theirs and we know that some members made their way to their new lands quite early. Captain Isaac Attwood is reputed to have been the \\"first white man to make it so far up the St John River\\", and he is said to have \\"hired private soldiers to help clear his land and that he had cleared over 40 acres by the Summer of 1784. The Granting of land at Parrtown and then up the St. John River faced unacceptable delays and was fraught with irregularities. One of the most outspoken advocates against the system of land distribution was one Tertullus Dickenson, who would also be one of the first elected members of the Council that was supposed to rule St. John. His election and that of other men was dismissed and instead, men considered for the establishment were put in charge of the yound City.

As of July 25, 1784, no house had made an appearance. July 17, 1784 - Grant by Governor General Frederick Haldimand, Commander in Chief in Lower Canada, of 500 acres of land at Lake Temiscouata to David Higginbotham, formerly Corporal in the 31st Regiment of Foot, and at this time, an Indian Courier of the King's Mails. September 15, 1784 – Memorial by a number of decommissioned soldiers from the KAR and other Regiments to Edmund Fanning, Lieutenant Governor General of Nova Scotia, dated September 15, 1784 at St. Ann on the River St. John. Governor Parr would approve the grant of two acres of land to the Memorialists. Philip Long's name is among the memorialists. We do not yet know which lot was received by Philip Long. 1785 January or February, 1785 – Governor Thomas Carleton, William Hazen, Jonathan Odell, and Thomas Knox went up the St John River, looked over the site of the new town at St. Ann, and decided to make St. Ann the Capital of the new Province of New Brunswick (New Ireland was also discussed at the time as a possible name but later rejected). Philip Long's two acres of land would have appreciated in value immediately! Unfortunately, the town was to be re-surveyed with lots of a quarter acre each, 66 feet by 165. The officers who had drawn lots in the new town plot, or, if a house had been built, the lot on which the house stood, if they complied with the conditions. They were to accept in writing, and must, before the 1st of August, commence to build a house at least 16 by 20 feet, and cover it from the weather before a grant could pass. August 5, 1785 - The name of Philip Long appears in a document signed and attested by Captain Isaac Attwood, entitled \\"Return of settlers on Block No. 4 assigned to the King's American late Regiment of Foot including also the Settlers on the upper part of Block No. 5 assigned to the Queens Rangers, 5 August 1785\\". He is also listed as having one \\"woman\\" with him as part of this Return. The status of this \\"woman\\" is not known at this time. A post office is established at Fredericton, New Brunswick. 1786 July 12, 1786 - Memorial on behalf of Isaac Attwood, Captain of the King's Regiment late of Foot, for the granting to Attwood of an island called \\"Fall Island\\" upstream from his soon-to-be granted lots of land. Philip Long signed this Memorial. 1787 August 7, 1787 – Return of Settlers in the vicinity of Block No. 4 (should be Blck No. 6). It is attested by Captain Isaac Attwood, surveyed by Mr. Allen, for the King's American late of Foot, in the Parish of Canterbury, and mentions 43 grantees. Philip Long is NOT listed in the group of grantees, and there is no mention of Lot 49 [the list ends at lot 29]. August 17, 1787 - Philip Long is granted 196 acres of land, lot 49 of 121 lots available, in the vicinity of Canterbury (South of Woodstock, near Meductic) on August 17, 1787. He receives this lot along with his other colleagues who were part of the KAR. They had picked Block No. 4 through a lottery a year or so earlier (date is unconfirmed). Philip Long, it appears from other records, would never make improvements on this lot of land, and it would later be transferred to Reuben Chace Senior in 1803. Philips' whereabouts are unknown at this time. August 30, 1787 - Report by Hugh Finlay, Deputy Postmaster General for Lower Canada, on the state of the road and communications between Riviere du Loup in Lower Canada, and Frederiction, New Brunswick. There are mentions of David Higginbotham's landing place at the head of Lake Temiscouata (the future location for the Long family in 1809). 1787 – Mail service between Saint John and Fredericton, New Brunswick is established. 1788 April 5, 1788 - Hugh Finlay is awarded a new commission as Deputy Postmaster General for the Provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. He had made the suggestion, in his Report in 1787, that this position be created. 1789 = 1790-1808 Courier to the King= 1791 Philip Long likely becomes a courier for the King's Mails, between the years 1786 to 1792. He \\"removed\\" to Lower Canada sometime in this period (Esther Clark Wright). We know his first, likely exact address in Lower Canada in 1792 from his marriage certificate – Cap St. Ignace. Patrick Campbell travels in North America and meets David Higginbotham, Captain Isaac Attwood and visits the location of Higginbotham's house at the Head of Lake Temiscouata. 1792 December 6, 1792 - Philip Long of Cape St-Ignace marries Marie-Julie Couillard-Després, from the Parish of L'Islet, in the Holy Trinity Church of Quebec City, the main Anglican Church at Quebec City. The officiating Minister was David Francis De Montmollin while David Higginbotham (Merchant), Andrew Johnston (Cooper) and Murdoch MacKenzie (Cooper) were witnesses. This Church had been built on the same site as the Recollet Church that had burnt down. 1794 March 6, 1794 - Baptism of Marie-Julie Long, first born of Philip and Marie Julie, at L'Ile Verte (near Riviere du Loup). From this record we infer that Philip and his family were now living at L'Ile Verte or very nearby. We know they would live there at least until late 1798, and possibly as late as sometime in 1800. 1795 February 18, 1795 - Sale of the Couillard-Despés inheritance, including a parcel of land, by Philip Long and Marie-Julie Couillard Després, to Alexander Croak (Kirouak). April 25, 1795 - Death of Marie-Julie Long, first born, on April 25, 1795. She was buried at l'Ile Verte. 1796 November 20, 1796 - Baptism of Marie Judith Long on November 20, 1796 at l'Ile Verte. 1797 February 6, 1797 - Purchase of a piece of land by Philip Long from Joseph Fraser at Notre Dame du Portage on February 6, 1797. This parcel of land is located near the entrance to the Protage du Canada on the banks of the St- Lawrence. April 6, 1797 - Birth and death of an anonymous child on April 16, 1797. We do not know the gender of the child. The name of Phillip Long appears in the records office in Rivière-du-Loup under courier- farmer. His residence is at the northern extremity of the portage from Lake Temiscouata. 1798 March 31, 1798 – Birth of Constance Long at l'Ile Verte, Quebec. April 8, 1798 – Baptism of Constance Long at l'Ile Verte, Quebec. September 14–15, 1798 - The Grand Voyer, Gabriel Tashereau, \\"Minister for the Roads\\", of the Quebec District responded to a request which he had received in March concerning the delineation of some roads in the Saint Patrick Parish in lower River du Loup. Many residents, including Philip Long, objected to the new roads proposed by Tashereau. Philip Long signed this petition and his lot of land is indicated on a map for the area. November 28, 1798—Sale of the piece of land purchased from Joseph Fraser in 1797, to Michel Nadeau in front of A. Dionne, notary, on November 28, 1798. This piece of land is located at Notre Dame du Portage. 1799 January 1, 1799—David Higginbotham puts Two Hundred and Fifty Arpens for sale. This land is located at the end of the new road (Portage) at Lake Temiscouata. He also puts some land for sale at River des Caps. The notice is dated 12 December 1798, and it was published in the Gazette of Quebec, January 1, 1799. October 18, 1799 – Hugh Finlay, Deputy Postmaster General for Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick is dismissed from the Post Office for financial misconduct . 1800 April 1, 1800 – George Heriot is appointed Deputy Postmaster General for Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. September 28, 1800—Birth of Jean-Baptiste Long, on September 28, 1800, in St-André of Kamouraska. He was baptized at St-André of Kamouraska, Quebec. 1801 1802 Philip Long and his family likely moved sometime between September 1800 and July 1803 to Quebec City. This is based on the baptism records for the children born in those years. Mgr. Denault is likely to have visited or traveled through the location of what would become Long's farm during this year. 1803 July 9, 1803 - Birth of Edouard-Narcisse Long on July 1803. He died on March 26, 1804 at Quebec City. He was born in Quebec City and baptized at the Notre Dame de Quebec Cathedral. February 4, 1803 - Reuben Chace Senior and his son Reuben Chace Junior send a Memorial to George Sproule, Surveyor General, requesting that he had never had land granted to him and that he was a shoe maker by trade. He requests that due to illness, he had to settle on a vacant lot of land, No. 50, in Grant 121, in the Parish of Woodstock. He therefore requests a grant of this land and the grant to No. 49, once granted to Philip Long, but who has never made any improvements to the land since receiving it. They also request that Lot 48 be given to Reuben Chace Junior. February 19, 1803 – George Sproule, Surveyor General of New Brunswick, receives the Memorial and notes that Lots 48 and 50 are ungranted and that Lot 49 was Granted to Philip Long as part of the Tristram Hillman and Associates Grant in the Parish of Woodstock. He then approves the granting of these losts to the Chace's, noting that Philip Long is an \\"absentee on the Grant\\". The Grant was to be registered on October 28, 1805. We now know that Thankful, daughter of Reuben Chace Senior, married Tertullus Dickenson. Tertullus would later be involved in a land transaction between Philip and Marie-Julie who sold Lot 2 in 1809. 1804 1805 March 25, 1805 - Birth of Julie Hortanse Long on March 25, 1805. She died on December 20, 1805 in Quebec City. She was baptized in the Notre Dame de Quebec Cathedral. (At birth, her name was Julie while at her death, the register indicates her name as Julie Hortanse). July 15, 1805 - Philip Long signs a receipt to Father Pinet of Kamouraska whereby a certain sum of money is to be given, by Philip Long, to a sculptor in Quebec City. This receipt was signed in front of Thomas Pitt, Notary. We do not know more about this sculpture but we know that the sculptor was a Master Sculptor and a famous one at the time. May 15, 1805 - Philip Long and his family are residing in Quebec City at 16, rue Ste. Ursule. We find his name in the census by Mgr. Plessis under: « Phil Loan, 1 protestant, 4 catholics – 12 St. Ursule «. The four catholics likely included Marie-Julie Couillard-Despres and three children: Marie-Judith Long, Constance Long et Jean-Baptiste Long. January 16, 1805? – Visit at Lake Temiscouata, by George Head, described in his A Diary of a Winter's Route From Halifax to the Canadas. 1806 October 23, 1806 - Birth of Philippe Long (II) at l'Islet, Quebec (birthplace of his mother Marie-Julie Couillard-Després). This means that sometime between July 1805 and October 1806, Philip and his family moved from Quebec City to l'Islet. 1807 1808 March 29, 1808 - Etienne Michaud is retained on March 29, 1808 as courier for Philip Long, described as courrier of Allifax (sic), to ensure the transport of letters and packages between Quebec City and Grand Falls, New Brunswick. Philip Long chose Islet du Bon Secours as his domicile for the purposes of fulfilling this contract. April 10, 1808 - Birth of Emmanuel Long on April 10, 1808 at l'Islet, Quebec. There has been no further information uncovered on this child, and any descendants (if there were any). = 1809-1813 Family moves to Lake Temiscouata: Early years = 1809 March 24, 1809 - Sale of parcel of Land by Philip Long and Marie Julie Couillard Després to Tertellus Dickenson. The land, Lot. Two, was in the Grant to the late King's American Regiment in the Parish of Woodstock. The Transaction is dated March 4, 1809. July 1809 - Philip Long and his family are settled at the northern edge of Lake Temiscouata in July 1809. He is posted there under the orders of the Governor James Craig and Postmaster General Hugh Finlay. This information comes to us through a letter written later by the Postmaster General, George Heriot in 1811. December 26, 1809 - Birth of George Long on December 26, 1809. He was born at Lake Temiscouata and baptized in St-Basile, New Brunswick. He is the first Long baptized in Madawaska. 1810 1811 1811 - Letter from Philip Long to Sir James Craig, 1811, Quebec City. A copy of this letter has yet to be found. However, we know that it existed since it is mentioned in Heriot's letter of March 27, 1811. Much research has been expended to find this elusive document but so far in vain. March 27, 1811 - Letter from George Heriot, Postmaster General of Lower Canada, to Lieutenant Colonel Thornton, on March 27, 1811, in Quebec City. Philip Long wrote a petition to Sir James Craig advising him that his annual salary had not been paid since December 12, 1810. This letter also shows that the government believed that Long was not using his money \\"in the best way Possible\\", and that they recommended that he and his family receive five bushels of wheat instead. Long did not agree with this situation and appears to have won his point with Heriot. April 8, 1811 - Birth of Romain Long (Memen – perhaps for Mailman or a contraction of Romain developed from a child's perspective) on April 8, 1811 at Lake Temiscouata. He was later baptized at St-Basile, NB. September 10, 1811 - Mgr. Plessis and his group visit and stay the night on September 10, 1811 at Long's Farm at Lake Temiscouata. His Secretary, Père Painchaud would later write a Journal of the travels where Philip was referred to as \\"John Lang\\"! This would cause endless confusion about Philip's name or who in fact was this John Lang. December 11, 1811 - A letter signed by George Heriot, Deputy Minister for the Mails, and dated December 11, 1811 mentions Philip Long. This letter from Heriot gives us some interesting information on a few things: the reasons why Long and his family moved to Lake Temiscouata; the fact that he had almost lost his eyesight; that Sir James Craig had personally authorized a salary of two shillings per day to Philip Long; and that he was requesting authorization from Sir George Prevost, the new Commander of the Forces, to continue to receive this annual salary on Long's behalf. December 16, 1811 - Letter from Noah Freer, Military Secretary, to George Heriot, PostMaster General, dated December 16, 1811, at Quebec City. This letter is in response to Heriot's request to continue payments of two shillings per day to Philip Long, and that these amounts be received by Heriot for Long. December 16, 1811 - Letter from William Henry Robinson, Commissary General, to authorize payments to Long as per receipt of Noah Freer's letter of the same date on December 16, 1811 at Quebec City. 1812 1813 October 8, 1813 - Marriage of Constance Long to Pierre Beaudry (called \\"Matelot\\") on October 8, 1813 at St. Roch, Quebec. December 2, 1813 - Birth of Suzanne Long on December 2, 1813 at Lake Temiscouata. She was baptized at St. Basile, NB. = 1814-1827 Lake Temiscouata - Long's Place= February 18, 1814 - On 18 Feb. 1814, Bouchette presented before the House of Assembly his project to produce a large-scale map of Lower Canada accompanied by his future book, A topographical description of the province of Lower Canada, with remarks upon Upper Canada, and on the relative connexion of both provinces with the United States of America. March 6, 1814 - The 104th Regiment from New Brunswick stays the night at Long's Farm on March 6, 1814. They were on their historic march where all 500 men of the regiment walked in winter conditions for 375 miles from Fredericton to Quebec City – without losing a single man – and then onward to Kingston, Ontario. This march took place during the hostilities of the 1812 War with the United States. The arrival of the Regiment is credited by many historians as key factor in deterring further incursions by the American forces further North and thereby possibly changing the course of the War in Britain's favour. April 1814 - The Governor General George Prevost stopped over at Long's Farm on his trip from Quebec City to Saint-John. He was on his way to London, England. June 30, 1814 - Letter and Report from Joseph Bouchette, Esquire, Surveyor General for Upper and Lower Canada, to Sir George Prevost, Governor in Chief of British North America and Commander in Chief of all Forces, at Quebec City and dated June 30, 1814. The title of the Report is \\"The Surveyor Genl's Report upon his return from settling the Veterans & families upon the Portage between Lower Canada and New Brunswick, 30th June, 1814.\\" July 30, 1814 - Sir George Prevost was replaced by a long time military man named Sir John Coape, Lord Sherbrooke, Duke of Richmond. Philip Long knew this man – he mentions this fact in his letter of 1816 where he says «… but I hope your Excellency will think only of me as a man of 26 or 30 years acquaintance, of my Conduct will report of me, as to Mail remaining in my house is false which I can prove it never Remained one Day if that it is my Orders and my Duty to take profession of and cary it forward Either up or Down which I Surely have Done. » 1815 May 9, 1815 - Marriage between Marie-Judith Long and Jacques Bezeau on May 9, 1815 at the Notre Dame de Quebec Cathedral. August 12, 1815 – Publication by Joseph Bouchette, Surveyor General for Canada of his famous A topographical description of the province of Lower Canada, with remarks upon Upper Canada, and on the relative connexion of both provinces with the United States of America. This book included a number of beautiful drawings, including our precious Long's Farm at the Entrance of the Portage of Lake Temiscouata, and the Great Falls of the River S.t John. November 18, 1815 - A terrible crop year descended on the Long family in Lake Temiscouata and Philip found himself writing a letter seeking help from Governor General Drummond, a man he says he knew. It is likely he met him when Sherbrooke was the commander of the newly created regiment after the landings in Saint-John in 1783. The drastic weather changes were likely due to the explosion of a massive volcano in the Pacific. November 20, 1815 - Letter from C. Foster, Military Secretary, to William Henry Robinson, Esquire, Commissary General, on November 20, 1815, Quebec City. This note confirms approval of some provisions to Philip Long and his family. 1816 May 1816 – Approximate date of the alleged incident whereby Philip Long was said to have delayed the British Mail by refusing to carry packages and barrels forward across Lake Temiscouata. The complaint was initiated by Lieutenant James Hinks. July 31, 1816 - Letter from George Heriot, Deputy Minister to the Post Office for Lower Canada, to Lieutenant-Colonel Addison, Military Secretary, July 31, 1816, at Quebec City. This letter is precious because we learn from Heriot's own hand that Philip Long had lost an eye in the service (we presume military service as opposed to post office service but this is not a certainty). There is no mention of the circumstances of this accident. No further information is available on the incident that caused such a handicap. September 4, 1816 - Letter from Philip Long to Lord Sherbrooke, September 4, 1816, at Lake Temiscouata. Philip Long defends himself against a number of accusations against him, with respect to having detained the Mails and having refused to transport certain provisions belonging to other colonists. These accusations were assessed by the most senior personnel in the Post Office and were found groundless. October 10, 1816 - Letter from Colonel Addison, Military Secretary, to H. Y. Cowan, Esquire, Postmaster for Quebec, October 10, 1816, at Quebec City. This letter from Addison contains comments on the reputation of our ancestor. It is mentioned that he had always had a conduct beyond reproach. September 29, 1816 - Declaration by François Robichaud concerning the accusations against Philip Long on the alleged delay of the English Mails, September 23, 1816, at Rivière du Loup. Witness: Joseph Robichaud. September 23, 1816 - Declaration by Henry Tardie concerning the accusations against Philip Long on the alleged delay of the English Mails, dated September 23, 1816, at Grand River below Madawaska. Witness Louis Mercure. September 23, 1816 - Declaration by Charles Beaulieu concerning the accusations against Philip Long on the alleged delay of the English Mails, September 23, 1816, at Grand Isle below Madawaska. Witness Louis Mercure. October 31, 1816 - Letter by Andrew Phair, Postmaster for Fredericton, to H. Y. Cowan, Postmaster for Quebec, October 31, 1816. This letter again defends Philip Long's character. Phair indicates that for all the years that he has known Long, he would not believe him capable of such a misstep. He also indicates that he knows very little of Beaulieu and Tardie even though he has employed them both from time to time. He relates the interesting information that many military men have suggested that Long was always very helpful, including to a certain Colonel. November 21, 1816 - Letter from H. Cowan, Esquire, Postmaster of Quebec, to Lieutenant-Colonel Addison, Military Secretary, on November 10, 1816, at Quebec City. In this letter, Cowan indicates that Phair was unable to establish the correct facts in the matter of the Lieutenant Hinks' complaint against Long but that many have intervened on Long's behalf and that he is satisfied that there is no merit to the complaint, and that Long should continue to receive his annuity payment of two shillings per day. The note also indicates that the explanation satisfied His Excellency. 1817 1818 March 18, 1818 - Contract for the sale of land between Long, Bouchette and Fraser, dated March 18, 1818. This contract for sale between Philip Long, Joseph Bouchette, Surveyor General of Canada, and Alexander Fraser, Seigneur of the Temiscouata Seigneury, probably represents the final relinquishing of Philip Long to all real or perceived claims he might have made owing to his long service and improvements to the land around the Lake. Bouchette and Fraser had just entered a partnership to create a new town at Cabano, then to be known as Strathern and Kent. This sale agreement is dated March 31, 1818. In return, Philip is promised lots 1, 2, and 3 (probably in the new town) as well as two concessions of his choice inside the Seigneury. It is not known which lands or concessions Philip took at that point (if he did at all). Of course, this promise may in itself have led future generations, starving and desperate during the Great Depression of the early 1930s, to believe that this represented the famous \\"Fortune des Long-Lang\\". We will probably never know. In this agreement, Philip renounces all claims on the lands surrounding the Lake. In our view, this act actually closes the chapter of the Fortune des Long-Lang since it seems to us that the valuable lands would have been around the lake, not in some unknown part of the Seigneury. 1819 1820 September 29, 1820 - The Birth of Michel Long on September 29, 1820 at Lake Temiscouata. We learn from Mgr. Lang that he was baptized at St. Basile on August 20, 1821. Michel would leave a very large number of descendants. He lived in Clair, New Brunswick for his entire life as far as we know. 1821 1822 August 20, 1822 - Marriage of Jean-Baptiste Long to Marguerite Émond on August 20, 1822 1822 - John Mann, a Scotchman who traveled across the continent, visited our ancestor's Landing Place (more like an Inn at this point), and described his voyage in his book: Travels in North America - Particularly in the Provinces of Upper and Lower Canada, and New Brunswick, and in the states of Maine, Massachusetts, and New York: containing a variety of interesting adventures and disasters, which the author encountered in his journey among the Americans, Dutch, French and Indians. Also several remarkable interpositions of divine providence, in preserving him from dangers, by sea and land, from 1816 to 1823. In this book, Long is described as \\"The landlord was an American, and could speak English with propriety. The landlady was a French woman from Lower Canada, and consequently all the family spoke the French language. After having some conversation with the old gentleman I retired to bed.\\" 1823 August 10, 1823 – Report by Major A. E. Elliott, Statement of Stations accupied by pensioners on the line of communication to Madawaska and additional stations recommended. This Report, in two parts, is of great interest to us since it provides some first hand information from Major Elliott about Philip Long and the latter's view of the lands he had resided on for such a long time. Long was having difficulties having the promised grants made available to him but he had been assured by Seigneur Fraser that he would not have to pay rents to him as long as he stayed on his improved lands but that his sons, if he decided to stay or improve lands, would be dealt with differently. It also gives us some interesting geographical information about the location of Long's Farm and Inn near the Landing Place, the conditions of his having been placed there by Finlay, Deputy Postmaster General in 1809 (according to a letter of that date – not yet found), and the conditions of rent that Philip does not have to pay to Fraser but that his son's would if he decided to stay in the vicinity of the Lake. We also discover in the Report that Pierre Matelot (i.e. Methot), also had some land 1 ½ miles below Degele (today Sainte-Rose-du-Dégelis) at the Perche River, and that Methot would be willing to stay in the area if he could only obtain a grant of land. August 10, 1823 - Letter by Major Elliott to the Earl of Dalhousie, Governor General, August 10, 1823, Quebec City. Major Elliott writes a report of his trip along the Eastern mail route. It includes a listing of his expenses, including the cost of renting a canoe at Long's Landing, and the fact that Jean-Baptiste Long, son of Philip, was hired as a guide and axe man. September 25, 1823 - Letter from Alexander Fraser to Colonel Darling, Military Secretary, September 25, 1823, from Lake Temiscouata. We learn from this letter that Fraser had accepted to receive, on their behalf, the payments to pensioners directly. Fraser makes the list of those soldiers stationed along the Portage, and mentions that Philip Long should not probably be considered a pensioner like the others since he had been placed there personally by Sir James H. Craig. 1824 May 20, 1824 - Major Elliott writes to Samuel Payne and mentions Philip Long's Existence which he considers miserable – just like Payne's. This document is written from Major Elliott and speaks to his recommendation that the widow of Samuel Payne, from Green River, receive his pension. In this letter, we learn that Payne seems to have played a similar role to Long. August 12, 1824 - Sale of a piece of land between Jean-Baptiste Long, his spouse Marguerite Émond, and Alexander Fraser in 1824, dated August 12, 1824 before notary public Louis Amiot at Riviere du Loup. Witnesses were Pierre Charon et André Marquis. This parcel of land was across the river from Philip's most recent residence. 1825 1825 - In the Census Temiscouata and Kamouraska in 1825, we find that Philip and his family are still in the vicinity of Lake Temiscouata. Nine people in total in the household were enumerated: Philippe Lang, 60 years and over, (married) (Philip is the only one listed); Marie-Julie, 60 years and over (married); three kids under the age of six (Suxanne, Michel, Romain) and two kids over 14 and under 18 (likely George and Romain); one male over 18 and less than 25 years old (married – Jean Baptiste) and one female child over 18 and under 45 years old (married - Marguerite Émond). 1826 January 16, 1826 - Letter from Alexander Fraser to Colonel Darling, Military Secretary, January 16, 1826 at Quebec City. Alex Fraser confirms the list of pensioners on the Lake and that he will receive on behalf of the pensioners their pensions. In this letter, Fraser confirms that Long had a special status since he had been placed on the Lake directly by the Governor, and was receiving a different payment. As well, Fraser apparently corrects the list that Darling had sent him where he is listed as Luke Long. January 26, 1826 - Letter from Peter Durquand, Commissary General, January 16, 1826, Quebec City, to Colonel Darling, Military Secretary. This letter tells us that Durquand needed authority to continue to make the payments to Long of his salary, and this for the whole year, and that William Belanger, Postmaster of Quebec, had been receiving this salary on Long's behalf since Heriot had left his position. 1827 January 5, 1827 - Letter from Philip Long to Colonel Alexander Fraser, January 5, 1827, at Lake Temiscouata. We find out in this letter that Philip owed a certain amount of money to Joseph Michaud, and that he was requesting Alexander Fraser give Michaud a note for this amount that would be redeemable for merchandise with certain merchants in Canada. We also find out that Philip had actually sold all of his lands to Fraser, and that Philip was to receive some money from that sale over the course of the next two years. Even without documentation, we can safely assume that the sale of this land had taken place between 1826 at the latest. It was likely a preparatory step for Philip to his final departure from the Lake Temiscouata region with his family. Fall 1827 - Jean-Baptiste Long moved his family and probably his father and mother as well to La Petite Décharge (Clair, New Brunswick). We know this because Jean-Baptiste Long made a deposition to Deane and Kavanagh in 1831 while they were surveying the area, and where Jean- Baptiste is quoted as follows: \\"that he is now thirty-one years of age and upwards; born at the river De Loup [Rivière du Loup in Québec] which crosses the Grand Portage, and twenty years ago his father brought him with the residue of his family to the Lake Temiscouata, and settled at the place where the Grand Portage commences. He resided at that place nineteen years, and in the autumn of the year one thousand eight hundred and twenty-seven, moved to the place where he now resides.\\" October 8, 1827 – Second marriage of Constance Long-Beaudry, to Antoine Arton on October 8, 1827. = 1828-1832 The Last Portage: Clair= January 22, 1828 - Marriage of Romain (Memen) Long to Marie-Vitaline Theriault on January 22, 1828 at St-Basile, New Brunswick. 1828 - Philip Long moves himself and his family (wife: Marie-Julie, and four kids: George, Romain, Suzanne and Michel) to a parcel of land adjacent to a place known locally as \\"la petite Décharge\\" (today Clair, New Brunswick – incorporated in 1887). This location is strategic for its military value (it is on the edge of one of the most important navigation routes (River Saint John) and across from the \\"Décharge\\" [discharge] of the Fish River) and also rich with giant white pines exclusively used and « reserved » for building the masts of ships. This location will become the foyer of all the descendants of the Long-Lang family line that originated in Madawaska and from the first generation of children of George, Romain and Michel. 1829 Report by Major G. E. Elliott on the Stations along the Portage of Temiscouata in 1829. Long's Farm is highlighted and the following text can be found: \\"This Station is on Colonel Frasers' portion of the Seigniory of Temisquata; it is also subject to the above inconvenient.\\" The inconvenient is that \\"… but being on the Seigniory of the River du Loup, this man is subject to be called on for rent for the whole of the period he has been on it; or to be turned off without any remuneration for his labor; although the settlers were afsured they were on government land, I trust they could have the usual grants given them.\\" October 2, 1829 - Alexander Fraser writes to Major Elliott where he acquiesces to Major Elliott's recommendations and relinquishes his rights to 100 acres of land for settlers to render courier work easier. 1830 1830 - Census of the Madawaska County. We find Philip Long and his family enumerated as part of the area in what would be become Clair. Philip is listed as being between 80–90 years of age a range inconsistent with the deduced 1757 birthdate in Mgr. Lang's history of Philip Long (Lang). 1831 July–August 1831 - The Deane and Kavanagh Report, July–August 1831: Survey of the Madawaska Settlement, Penobscot and Washington Counties (now Aroostook County), Maine and Carleton County (now Madawaska Co.), New Brunswick. The American agents Deane and Kavanagh prepare a Report for the State of Maine describing the geology, demography and development of the disputed regions between the State of Maine and New Brunswick. The report states that Philip Long and his two sons, George and Romain (Marmosie) Long, occupy a parcel of land on the north side of the St. John river, and also possess other lots in the same area since 1828. In this report, the story of the act of bravery is also mentioned and confirmed for Philip Long. He is said to have taken some mails from the American side during the American Revolution and escaped to the British. 1832 August 28, 1832 - Marriage of Suzanne Long to Jacques Hamel on August 28, 1832 at St-Roch de Quebec, Quebec City. December 25, 1832 - Philip Long dies on December 25, 1832 at the age of ninety (90) years old [per his death certificate]. He is interred in the Ste-Luce cemetery a few days later. This Parish is now in Maine, USA and it is somewhat ironic given his loyalty to, and his role in protecting the border interests of the British Crown, that he would be buried on the American side of the border. It became American soil in 1844. 1833 October 22, 1833 - Marriage of Philip (II) Long-Laing to Emilie Boucher on October 22, 1833 at the Immaculate Conception Church in Three Rivers, Quebec. November 1833 - \\"Returns showing the number of Inhabitants in the Settlement of Madawaska\\". Also knowns as the 1833 New Brunswick Special Census of Madawaska on both sides of the St.John River, Carleton County, New Brunswick (now Madawaska Co., New Brunswick and Aroostook Co., Maine). There are two Long's for the village of Clair: Romain and George. Romain is listed as having a wife, three boys and one girl. Marie-Julie lives with Romain and is described as \\"Mother, very poor, requires assistance\\". 1834 January 7, 1834 - Marriage between George Edouard Long to Adelaïde Caron on January 7, 1834 at St-Basile, New Brunswick. 1843 February 27, 1843 - Marriage between Michel Long and Emerance Theriault on February 27, 1843 at Cacouna, Quebec. 1844 Signing of the Webster-Ashburton Treaty in 1844 which will draw the boundary between Canada and the United States once and for all. 1857 October 19, 1857 - Marie-Julie Couillard-Després dies on October 19, 1857 at Clair. She was buried in the Ste-Luce Cemetery on October 21, 1857. 1860 October 13, 1860 – Second marriage of Michel Long to Marguerite Thériault, at St. Francois de Madawaska.

Jackson in the prequel trilogy, who reprised his role in the 2008 animated film Star Wars: The Clone Wars, whilst Terrence C. Carson voiced the character in other projects, such as The Clone Wars television series. Windu is a Jedi Master and member of the High Council during the final years of the Galactic Republic, who wields a unique purple-bladed lightsaber. Despite the Clone Wars causing him to question his most firmly held beliefs, he is a staunch follower of the Jedi path and was distrustful of Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker because he felt that he had dangerous potential. Towards the end of the Clone Wars, he learns from Anakin that Supreme Chancellor Palpatine is the Sith Lord Darth Sidious and attempts to arrest him, only to be killed by the Sith Lord with the help of Anakin himself, who then becomes Darth Vader. Windu later appears as a disembodied voice, along with other past Jedi, during the final battle of The Rise of Skywalker (2019), empowering Rey to face the rejuvenated Palpatine. Character conception and overview Several early incarnations of the character who would become Mace Windu were developed in the original Star Wars drafts as the narrator, Princess Leia's brother and Luke Skywalker's friend. Through the process of redrafting and copyediting, his character was removed from the original trilogy, but was reintroduced in 1994 when series creator George Lucas began writing the prequel trilogy. During the production of Episode II – Attack of the Clones, Samuel L. Jackson asked Lucas if his character could wield a purple lightsaber as a way of making the character easily distinguishable in large battle scenes. Although his weapon is not seen onscreen until Attack of the Clones, action figures released for Episode I – The Phantom Menace pair Mace with a blue lightsaber. AppearancesFilm= Mace Windu's Jedi robes from Episode III The Phantom Menace (1999) Introduced in Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace, Windu appears as the Master of the Jedi Council. The maverick Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn comes before the Council and offers to train Anakin Skywalker, believing that the boy is the Chosen One of Jedi prophecy. Windu and the other Council members decline, deeming Anakin too old and full of fear. After the corrupt Trade Federation is defeated and Obi-Wan Kenobi defeats Sith Lord Darth Maul, who also kills Qui-Gon, Windu realizes that the Sith have returned, and he and the Council reluctantly allow Obi-Wan to train Anakin in Qui-Gon's stead. Attack of the Clones (2002) In Attack of the Clones, set ten years after the previous installment, Windu initially refuses to believe that the assassination attempt on Senator Padmé Amidala on Coruscant was authorized by former Jedi master Count Dooku, the leader of a galactic Separatist movement. Having learned of Obi-Wan's whereabouts on Geonosis, Windu arrives to save Obi-Wan, Padmé and Anakin from being executed at Dooku's order. In the ensuing battle, Windu kills bounty hunter Jango Fett, the template for the Republic's army of clone troopers, and leads them and a cadre of Jedi to victory in a battle with Dooku's forces. At the end of the film, with the Clone Wars begun, Windu resolves to keep a closer eye on the increasingly corrupt Galactic Senate. Revenge of the Sith (2005) In Revenge of the Sith, set three years after the beginning of the Clone Wars, Windu and the other members of the Jedi Council are concerned that the Republic's Supreme Chancellor, Palpatine, may not relinquish his emergency powers when the Clone Wars end. Their suspicions only grow when the Senate grants Palpatine a vote on the Jedi Council by appointing Anakin as his personal representative. The Council makes Anakin a member, but denies him the rank of Jedi Master and orders him to spy on Palpatine against the latter's will, causing Anakin's faith in the Jedi to diminish significantly. After Obi- Wan kills Separatist leader General Grievous, Anakin learns Palpatine's true identity and informs Windu that Palpatine is Sith Lord Darth Sidious, the mastermind of the war. Windu and three other Jedi Masters; Kit Fisto, Agen Kolar and Saesee Tiin attempt to arrest Palpatine, but the Sith Lord easily has Windu left to duel alone. Windu gets the upper hand and subdues Palpatine by knocking away his lightsaber and deflecting the Sith Lord's Force lightning back at him, disfiguring Palpatine's body. Anakin, needing Palpatine for the power to prevent his wife Padmé's possible death arrives and pleads with Windu not to kill Palpatine, who possibly feigns helplessness to implore Anakin. Windu counters that Palpatine controls the Senate and the courts, and is therefore too dangerous to be kept alive. Just as Windu is about to finish Palpatine off, Anakin intervenes on Palpatine's behalf, betraying Windu by severing his right arm and disarming him. Palpatine then tortures and defenestrates Windu with another blast of Force lightning, supposedly killing him. Palpatine uses Windu's death to start Order 66 and murder the vast majority of the Jedi. The Clone Wars (2008) Windu makes his final film appearance in the 2008 animated film Star Wars: The Clone Wars, set between Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith. He plays a supporting role as a general in the Republic's clone forces. He is voiced by Samuel L. Jackson, who portrayed the character in the live-action films. The Rise of Skywalker (2019) Windu returns as a voice cameo in the final chapter of the Star Wars sequel trilogy The Rise of Skywalker. During the battle between Rey and his killer, Palpatine, Windu's voice is heard speaking to Rey, encouraging her to rise and fight back as all of the past Jedi are with her. =Animated series=The Clone Wars (2008–2014; 2020) In Star Wars: The Clone Wars (set between Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith), Mace Windu has a supporting role. As in the film, he is a general of the Republic's clone army. He is voiced by Terrence \\"T.C.\\" Carson. =Comics= In 2017, Marvel released Star Wars: Jedi of the Republic – Mace Windu, a 5-issue series centered around Windu during the early days of the Clone Wars. He leads a small team of Jedi on a mission to the planet Hissrich, to find out what the Separatists are doing there. During the mission, Windu's faith in the Jedi path is tested by his interactions with two new characters: AD-W4, a mercenary droid with a thirst for murdering Jedi; and Prosset Dibs, a blind Jedi Master who becomes disillusioned with the Jedi Order and turns on Windu. Ultimately, Windu ends up besting both adversaries in single combat, respectively, and his faith in the Jedi way is strengthened by the experience. =Legends= Windu appears extensively in prequel-era Expanded Universe material. In April 2014, most of the licensed Star Wars novels and comics produced since the originating 1977 film were rebranded by Lucasfilm as \\"Legends\\" and declared non-canon to the franchise. Clone Wars (2003) Mace Windu is a supporting character in Genndy Tartakovsky's Star Wars: Clone Wars micro- series, which is set between Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith. The character's likeness in the series is based on that in The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones. In the first chapters, he defends the grasslands planet Dantooine against a large hovering \\"fortress\\", and over the course, he loses his lightsaber, forcing him to instead use a lethal form of unarmed combat powered by the Force. In final chapters, he and fellow Jedi Master Yoda help defend the planet Coruscant from an attack by General Grievous. In the midst of the battle, he realizes that the attack is a ruse to distract the Jedi from Grievous's true objective: to \\"kidnap\\" Palpatine. Despite being too late to save the Supreme Chancellor, the Jedi Master uses the Force to crush Grievous's chest, inflicting upon the cyborg general the wheezing, asthmatic cough heard in Revenge of the Sith.  Comics  The 1999 \\"Emissaries to Malastare\\" arc of the Dark Horse Comics' self-titled Star Wars series, set shortly after The Phantom Menace, mentions a Jedi exercise in which Windu had swapped his lightsaber with Eeth Koth. However, the lightsaber returned to him is blue, so this does not explain why his saber color changed to purple, as is sometimes claimed. Novels Windu has appeared as a supporting character in Legends/Expanded Universe novels, such as Cloak of Deception, Darth Maul: Shadow Hunter, Rogue Planet, Outbound Flight, The Cestus Deception, Jedi Trial, Yoda: Dark Rendezvous and Labyrinth of Evil. =Shatterpoint= Windu is the central character of Matthew Stover's 2004 novel Shatterpoint, taking place six months after Attack of the Clones. Stover based the novel on both Joseph Conrad's novel Heart of Darkness, and its loose adaptation Apocalypse Now. George Lucas wrote the prologue to the novel, and Jonathan Davis reads the audiobook version. Windu's former Padawan and fellow Jedi Master Depa Billaba has been sent to Windu's homeworld, Haruun Kal, to start a revolution against the Separatist-allied government. Evidence is discovered that Billaba has fallen to the dark side of the Force. Since Windu taught her a special lightsaber combat form, he alone is sent by the Jedi Council to find her. After a fight, he puts Billaba under arrest, and calls a Republic cruiser. It is attacked by Vulture droids and deploys gunships, which battle the droid starfighters with the assistance of clone troopers. Some of the landing craft make it to the surface, and the cruiser defeats the Separatists. Windu uses the gunships to destroy the droid fighters that followed them, then orders the clones to take out a nearby droid control station. The Separatists are forced to surrender to the Republic, and Billaba falls into a vegetative coma. A Republic force stays on the planet to police the unrestful local tribes. The novel explores Windu's unique talent of sensing \\"shatterpoints\\", faultlines in the Force which allow him to exploit his enemies' weaknesses. It also explains that Windu is the creator and sole master of a style of lightsaber combat called Vaapad, in which the user skirts dangerously close to the dark side by enjoying the thrill of the fight. All others who attempted to master the form either gave in to the dark side or were unable to properly master the technique. Stover later referenced Windu's unique lightsaber- fighting abilities in his novelization of Revenge of the Sith. Merchandising A Mace Windu action figure was added to the Star Wars Transformers toy line in 2006. It was a remold of the toy first used for Obi- Wan Kenobi. He becomes an Eta-2 Actis-class light interceptor starfighter with Astromech droid R4-M6. Legacy IGN listed Mace Windu as the 27th top Star Wars character, stating that he is an important component of the series. Samuel L. Jackson called for Windu's return at Star Wars Celebration in 2017, saying that \\"We all know Jedi can fall from incredible heights and survive, so apparently, I am not dead. Yes, I have two appendages right now, but we know the long and rich history of Star Wars characters reappearing with new appendages\\".

His magnum opus is Iota Unum. It is a work dedicated to the study of the ruptures in Church teaching and tradition following the Second Vatican Council. Education and teaching Amerio was a Swiss Italian. He obtained a doctorate in philosophy from the Catholic University of Milan in 1927. He was a disciple of Fr. Gemelli, the founder of the University. He had studied in detail the philosophy of 17th century Italian poet Tommaso Campanella, of whose work he later became a professional scholar. He is also known for his study of Antonio Rosmini and producing a critical edition of the work of Alessandro Manzoni. After receiving his doctorate, he taught philosophy and Greco-Roman classics at the Academy of Lugano in Switzerland. Peritus at Vatican Council II Amerio was taken to Vatican Council as a peritus of Angelo Giuseppe Jelmini, Apostolic Administrator of the Diocese of Lugano and Titular Bishop of Thermae Basilicae. Since Jelmini was a member of the Central Preparatory Commission, Amerio was able to view all the schemata and write comments on behalf of Jelmini. 20 Years after the end of the Council, as he grew more and more critical of the discontinuity in doctrine and discipline promoted in the name of the Council by certain groups, he wrote Iota Unum. Thought In his writings, Amerio identifies three syllabuses which he says were implicitly and intellectually negated during the post-conciliar period : the encyclical Quanta cura, condemning liberalism and masonic ideology, the decree Lamentabili sane exitu concerning radical biblical criticism, and the encyclical Humani generis of 1950, which reproves of new ecclesial anthropologies and ecclesiologies. Amerio was also opposed to liturgical creativity, and his thought on this issue was essentially in line with the encyclical Mediator Dei of Pius XII, which precisely held that liturgy was a cultus, and not so much a self-celebration. Amerio also examined institutional changes in the Holy Office and felt that the formal abandonment of the term heresy in official enquiries and procedures had dramatic consequences on Church life, studies and Christian academics. Amerio was a promoter of apologetics and was dismayed by the abandonment of notions of conversion and disputation in favour of a purely dialectic approach between Church and World. He held to traditional Thomism and Augustinianism and deeply disliked the common embrace of Kantism, Hegelianism and Spinozism among many Christian intellectuals. Amerio's essays were praised by traditional scholars in the Church, although they came at a difficult time for him because of the then public conflict between archbishop Marcel Lefebvre of the traditionalist Society of St. Pius X and Pope Paul VI. As such, his 1980s research and books were largely ignored and neglected by leaders inside the institutional Church. Amerio died in 1997. However, Amerio is thought to have been at least partially rehabilitated during the papacy of Benedict XVI. Thus Caritas in Veritate, a 2009 encyclical dedicated to Charity and Truth, explores ideas and concepts that were at the very heart of Amerio's theological and philosophical career.The title of the encyclical is the philosophical subject of Iota Unum.

Lombardstown is within the Cork North-West (Dáil constituency). It has a co-op and a post office. Its main employer is the mill. Notable people From 1912 the world-famous Irish tenor, John McCormack spent many summers in the area after he purchased a small cottage outside the village. McCormack became a regular face in the local train station as this was his mode of transport for his journey from Athlone to Lombardstown. It was very common for locals to gather outside McCormacks cottage to hear him practice his performances, diction and breath control. In 1918 Mccormack sold this cottage as he no longer had time to travel to Cork due to his singing commitments in the US, but he left with a huge fondness of the people.

Both albums were heavily promoted by the label as being representative of the \\"Bosstown Sound\\". The commercial ploy was heavily driven in psychedelic music that attempted to replicate the San Francisco Sound.  Background  Ian Bruce-Douglas composed all the songs, played several instruments, and sang lead for most of the tracks. Apart from its obvious references about the use of psychedelic drugs, Ultimate Spinach is a concept album based on abstract anti-war sentiment, in the context of the Vietnam War that happened at that time. Lyrically, Bruce-Douglas' songs are subtle, pretty intricate and with an imaginary vision of life. One of the most notable characteristics is its experimental style, with \\"artifacts\\" and unusual recording techniques, among which stand out a variety of guitar sounds and distortions including fuzz, echo, tremolo, feedback, volume control, and use of the wah-wah pedal. Each of those aspects were similar to the typical West Coast psychedelic sound of the era. With the publicity backing them, the band toured with prominent musical acts like Big Brother and the Holding Company and The Youngbloods at significant venues like the Filmore Auditorium. Following their recording and initial tour, drummer Keith Lahtenein left the group to by replaced Russell Levine. Priscilla DiDonato was also added to the lineup at this time. The addition enabled the band to more closely recreate the overdubbed vocal harmonies in their debut album.  Reception The album was Ultimate Spinach's most successful when it peaked at number 34 on the Billboard 200. In 2008, the album still retained its presence as a psychedelic classic when it was listed at number 36 on Classic Rock magazine's \\"42 Greatest Psychedelic Albums\\".

Lateral thinking has been made popular by Edward de Bono. This thinking technique is applied to generate creative ideas and solve problems. Similarly, by applying lateral-computing techniques to a problem, it can become much easier to arrive at a computationally inexpensive, easy to implement, efficient, innovative or unconventional solution. The traditional or conventional approach to solving computing problems is to either build mathematical models or have an IF- THEN -ELSE structure. For example, a brute- force search is used in many chess engines, but this approach is computationally expensive and sometimes may arrive at poor solutions. It is for problems like this that lateral computing can be useful to form a better solution. A simple problem of truck backup can be used for illustrating lateral-computing. This is one of the difficult tasks for traditional computing techniques, and has been efficiently solved by the use of fuzzy logic (which is a lateral computing technique). Lateral-computing sometimes arrives at a novel solution for particular computing problem by using the model of how living beings, such as how humans, ants, and honeybees, solve a problem; how pure crystals are formed by annealing, or evolution of living beings or quantum mechanics etc. From lateral-thinking to lateral- computing Lateral thinking is technique for creative thinking for solving problems. The brain as center of thinking has a self-organizing information system. It tends to create patterns and traditional thinking process uses them to solve problems. The lateral thinking technique proposes to escape from this patterning to arrive at better solutions through new ideas. Provocative use of information processing is the basic underlying principle of lateral thinking, The provocative operator (PO) is something which characterizes lateral thinking. Its function is to generate new ideas by provocation and providing escape route from old ideas. It creates a provisional arrangement of information. Water logic is contrast to traditional or rock logic. Water logic has boundaries which depends on circumstances and conditions while rock logic has hard boundaries. Water logic, in someways, resembles fuzzy logic. =Transition to lateral-computing= Lateral computing does a provocative use of information processing similar to lateral-thinking. This is explained with the use of evolutionary computing which is a very useful lateral-computing technique. The evolution proceeds by change and selection. While random mutation provides change, the selection is through survival of the fittest. The random mutation works as a provocative information processing and provides a new avenue for generating better solutions for the computing problem. Lateral computing takes the analogies from real-world examples such as: * How slow cooling of the hot gaseous state results in pure crystals (Annealing) * How the neural networks in the brain solve such problems as face and speech recognition * How simple insects such as ants and honeybees solve some sophisticated problems * How evolution of human beings from molecular life forms are mimicked by evolutionary computing * How living organisms defend themselves against diseases and heal their wounds * How electricity is distributed by grids Differentiating factors of \\"lateral computing\\": * Does not directly approach the problem through mathematical means. * Uses indirect models or looks for analogies to solve the problem. * Radically different from what is in vogue, such as using \\"photons\\" for computing in optical computing. This is rare as most conventional computers use electrons to carry signals. * Sometimes the Lateral Computing techniques are surprisingly simple and deliver high performance solutions to very complex problems. * Some of the techniques in lateral computing use \\"unexplained jumps\\". These jumps may not look logical. The example is the use of \\"Mutation\\" operator in genetic algorithms. =Convention – lateral= It is very hard to draw a clear boundary between conventional and lateral computing. Over a period of time, some unconventional computing techniques become integral part of mainstream computing. So there will always be an overlap between conventional and lateral computing. It will be tough task classifying a computing technique as a conventional or lateral computing technique as shown in the figure. The boundaries are fuzzy and one may approach with fuzzy sets. Formal definition Lateral computing is a fuzzy set of all computing techniques which use unconventional computing approach. Hence Lateral computing includes those techniques which use semi- conventional or hybrid computing. The degree of membership for lateral computing techniques is greater than 0 in the fuzzy set of unconventional computing techniques. The following brings out some important differentiators for lateral computing. ;Conventional computing: * The problem and technique are directly correlated. * Treats the problem with rigorous mathematical analysis. * Creates mathematical models. * The computing technique can be analyzed mathematically. ;Lateral computing: * The problem may hardly have any relation to the computing technique used * Approaches problems by analogies such as human information processing model, annealing, etc. * Sometimes the computing technique cannot be mathematically analyzed. =Lateral computing and parallel computing= Parallel computing focuses on improving the performance of the computers/algorithms through the use of several computing elements (such as processing elements). The computing speed is improved by using several computing elements. Parallel computing is an extension of conventional sequential computing. However, in lateral computing, the problem is solved using unconventional information processing whether using a sequential or parallel computing. A review of lateral-computing techniques There are several computing techniques which fit the Lateral computing paradigm. Here is a brief description of some of the Lateral Computing techniques: =Swarm intelligence= Swarm intelligence (SI) is the property of a system whereby the collective behaviors of (unsophisticated) agents, interacting locally with their environment, cause coherent functional global patterns to emerge. SI provides a basis with which it is possible to explore collective (or distributed) problem solving without centralized control or the provision of a global model. One interesting swarm intelligent technique is the Ant Colony algorithm: * Ants are behaviorally unsophisticated; collectively they perform complex tasks. Ants have highly developed sophisticated sign-based communication. * Ants communicate using pheromones; trails are laid that can be followed by other ants. * Routing Problem Ants drop different pheromones used to compute the \\"shortest\\" path from source to destination(s). =Agent-based systems= Agents are encapsulated computer systems that are situated in some environment and are capable of flexible, autonomous action in that environment in order to meet their design objectives. Agents are considered to be autonomous (independent, not- controllable), reactive (responding to events), pro-active (initiating actions of their own volition), and social (communicative). Agents vary in their abilities: they can be static or mobile, or may or may not be intelligent. Each agent may have its own task and/or role. Agents, and multi-agent systems, are used as a metaphor to model complex distributed processes. Such agents invariably need to interact with one another in order to manage their inter- dependencies. These interactions involve agents cooperating, negotiating and coordinating with one another. Agent-based systems are computer programs that try to simulate various complex phenomena via virtual \\"agents\\" that represent the components of a business system. The behaviors of these agents are programmed with rules that realistically depict how business is conducted. As widely varied individual agents interact in the model, the simulation shows how their collective behaviors govern the performance of the entire system - for instance, the emergence of a successful product or an optimal schedule. These simulations are powerful strategic tools for \\"what-if\\" scenario analysis: as managers change agent characteristics or \\"rules,\\" the impact of the change can be easily seen in the model output =Grid computing= By analogy, a computational grid is a hardware and software infrastructure that provides dependable, consistent, pervasive, and inexpensive access to high-end computational capabilities. The applications of grid computing are in: * Chip design, cryptographic problems, medical instrumentation, and supercomputing. * Distributed supercomputing applications use grids to aggregate substantial computational resources in order to tackle problems that cannot be solved on a single system. =Autonomic computing= The autonomic nervous system governs our heart rate and body temperature, thus freeing our conscious brain from the burden of dealing with these and many other low-level, yet vital, functions. The essence of autonomic computing is self-management, the intent of which is to free system administrators from the details of system operation and maintenance. Four aspects of autonomic computing are: * Self-configuration * Self-optimization * Self-healing * Self-protection This is a grand challenge promoted by IBM. =Optical computing= Optical computing is to use photons rather than conventional electrons for computing. There are quite a few instances of optical computers and successful use of them. The conventional logic gates use semiconductors, which use electrons for transporting the signals. In case of optical computers, the photons in a light beam are used to do computation. There are numerous advantages of using optical devices for computing such as immunity to electromagnetic interference, large bandwidth, etc. =DNA computing= DNA computing uses strands of DNA to encode the instance of the problem and to manipulate them using techniques commonly available in any molecular biology laboratory in order to simulate operations that select the solution of the problem if it exists. Since the DNA molecule is also a code, but is instead made up of a sequence of four bases that pair up in a predictable manner, many scientists have thought about the possibility of creating a molecular computer. These computers rely on the much faster reactions of DNA nucleotides binding with their complements, a brute force method that holds enormous potential for creating a new generation of computers that would be 100 billion times faster than today's fastest PC. DNA computing has been heralded as the \\"first example of true nanotechnology\\", and even the \\"start of a new era\\", which forges an unprecedented link between computer science and life science. Example applications of DNA computing are in solution for the Hamiltonian path problem which is a known NP complete one. The number of required lab operations using DNA grows linearly with the number of vertices of the graph. Molecular algorithms have been reported that solves the cryptographic problem in a polynomial number of steps. As known, factoring large numbers is a relevant problem in many cryptographic applications. =Quantum computing= In a quantum computer, the fundamental unit of information (called a quantum bit or qubit), is not binary but rather more quaternary in nature. This qubit property arises as a direct consequence of its adherence to the laws of quantum mechanics, which differ radically from the laws of classical physics. A qubit can exist not only in a state corresponding to the logical state 0 or 1 as in a classical bit, but also in states corresponding to a blend or quantum superposition of these classical states. In other words, a qubit can exist as a zero, a one, or simultaneously as both 0 and 1, with a numerical coefficient representing the probability for each state. A quantum computer manipulates qubits by executing a series of quantum gates, each a unitary transformation acting on a single qubit or pair of qubits. In applying these gates in succession, a quantum computer can perform a complicated unitary transformation to a set of qubits in some initial state. =Reconfigurable computing= Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) are making it possible to build truly reconfigurable computers. The computer architecture is transformed by on the fly reconfiguration of the FPGA circuitry. The optimal matching between architecture and algorithm improves the performance of the reconfigurable computer. The key feature is hardware performance and software flexibility. For several applications such as fingerprint matching, DNA sequence comparison, etc., reconfigurable computers have been shown to perform several orders of magnitude better than conventional computers.Compton and Hauck, 2002 =Simulated annealing= The Simulated annealing algorithm is designed by looking at how the pure crystals form from a heated gaseous state while the system is cooled slowly.Arts and Krost, 1997 The computing problem is redesigned as a simulated annealing exercise and the solutions are arrived at. The working principle of simulated annealing is borrowed from metallurgy: a piece of metal is heated (the atoms are given thermal agitation), and then the metal is left to cool slowly. The slow and regular cooling of the metal allows the atoms to slide progressively their most stable (\\"minimal energy\\") positions. (Rapid cooling would have \\"frozen\\" them in whatever position they happened to be at that time.) The resulting structure of the metal is stronger and more stable. By simulating the process of annealing inside a computer program, it is possible to find answers to difficult and very complex problems. Instead of minimizing the energy of a block of metal or maximizing its strength, the program minimizes or maximizes some objective relevant to the problem at hand. =Soft computing= One of the main components of \\"Lateral-computing\\" is soft computing which approaches problems with human information processing model.Proc IEEE, 2001 The Soft Computing technique comprises Fuzzy logic, neuro-computing, evolutionary-computing, machine learning and probabilistic- chaotic computing. =Neuro computing= Instead of solving a problem by creating a non-linear equation model of it, the biological neural network analogy is used for solving the problem. The neural network is trained like a human brain to solve a given problem. This approach has become highly successful in solving some of the pattern recognition problems. =Evolutionary computing= The genetic algorithm (GA) resembles the natural evolution to provide a universal optimization. Genetic algorithms start with a population of chromosomes which represent the various solutions. The solutions are evaluated using a fitness function and a selection process determines which solutions are to be used for competition process. These algorithms are highly successful in solving search and optimization problems. The new solutions are created using evolutionary principles such as mutation and crossover. =Fuzzy logic= Fuzzy logic is based on the fuzzy sets concepts proposed by Lotfi Zadeh.Ross, 1997 The degree of membership concept is central to fuzzy sets. The fuzzy sets differ from crisp sets since they allow an element to belong to a set to a degree (degree of membership). This approach finds good applications for control problems. The Fuzzy logic has found enormous applications and has already found a big market presence in consumer electronics such as washing machines, microwaves, mobile phones, Televisions, Camcoders etc. =Probabilistic/chaotic computing= Probabilistic computing engines, e.g. use of probabilistic graphical model such as Bayesian network. Such computational techniques are referred to as randomization, yielding probabilistic algorithms. When interpreted as a physical phenomenon through classical statistical thermodynamics, such techniques lead to energy savings that are proportional to the probability p with which each primitive computational step is guaranteed to be correct (or equivalently to the probability of error, (1–p).Palem, 2003 Chaotic Computing is based on the chaos theory.Gleick, 1998 =Fractals= Fractal Computing are objects displaying self-similarity at different scales.Mandelbrot, 1977 Fractals generation involves small iterative algorithms. The fractals have dimensions greater than their topological dimensions. The length of the fractal is infinite and size of it cannot be measured. It is described by an iterative algorithm unlike a Euclidean shape which is given by a simple formula. There are several types of fractals and Mandelbrot sets are very popular. Fractals have found applications in image processing, image compression music generation, computer games etc. Mandelbrot set is a fractal named after its creator. Unlike the other fractals, even though the Mandelbrot set is self- similar at magnified scales, the small scale details are not identical to the whole. I.e., the Mandelbrot set is infinitely complex. But the process of generating it is based on an extremely simple equation. The Mandelbrot set M is a collection of complex numbers. The numbers Z which belong to M are computed by iteratively testing the Mandelbrot equation. C is a constant. If the equation converges for chosen Z, then Z belongs to M. Mandelbrot equation: =Randomized algorithm= A Randomized algorithm makes arbitrary choices during its execution. This allows a savings in execution time at the beginning of a program. The disadvantage of this method is the possibility that an incorrect solution will occur. A well-designed randomized algorithm will have a very high probability of returning a correct answer.Motwani and Raghavan, 1995 The two categories of randomized algorithms are: * Monte Carlo algorithm * Las Vegas algorithm Consider an algorithm to find the kth element of an array. A deterministic approach would be to choose a pivot element near the median of the list and partition the list around that element. The randomized approach to this problem would be to choose a pivot at random, thus saving time at the beginning of the process. Like approximation algorithms, they can be used to more quickly solve tough NP-complete problems. An advantage over the approximation algorithms, however, is that a randomized algorithm will eventually yield an exact answer if executed enough times =Machine learning= Human beings/animals learn new skills, languages/concepts. Similarly, machine learning algorithms provide capability to generalize from training data.Mitchell, 1997 There are two classes of Machine Learning (ML): * Supervised ML * Unsupervised ML One of the well known machine learning technique is Back Propagation Algorithm. This mimics how humans learn from examples. The training patterns are repeatedly presented to the network. The error is back propagated and the network weights are adjusted using gradient descent. The network converges through several hundreds of iterative computations. =Support vector machinesJoachims, 2002= This is another class of highly successful machine learning techniques successfully applied to tasks such as text classification, speaker recognition, image recognition etc. Example applications There are several successful applications of lateral- computing techniques. Here is a small set of applications that illustrates lateral computing: * Bubble sorting: Here the computing problem of sorting is approached with an analogy of bubbles rising in water. This is by treating the numbers as bubbles and floating them to their natural position. * Truck backup problem: This is an interesting problem of reversing a truck and parking it at a particular location. The traditional computing techniques have found it difficult to solve this problem. This has been successfully solved by Fuzzy system. * Balancing an inverted pendulum: This problem involves balancing and inverted pendulum. This problem has been efficiently solved by neural networks and fuzzy systems. * Smart volume control for mobile phones: The volume control in mobile phones depend on the background noise levels, noise classes, hearing profile of the user and other parameters. The measurement on noise level and loudness level involve imprecision and subjective measures. The authors have demonstrated the successful use of fuzzy logic system for volume control in mobile handsets. * Optimization using genetic algorithms and simulated annealing: The problems such as traveling salesman problem have been shown to be NP complete problems.Garey and Johnson, 1979 Such problems are solved using algorithms which benefit by heuristics. Some of the applications are in VLSI routing, partitioning etc. Genetic algorithms and Simulated annealing have been successful in solving such optimization problems.Aarts and Krost, 1997 * Programming The Unprogrammable (PTU) involving the automatic creation of computer programs for unconventional computing devices such as cellular automata, multi-agent systems, parallel systems, field-programmable gate arrays, field-programmable analog arrays, ant colonies, swarm intelligence, distributed systems, and the like.Koza et al., 2003 Summary Above is a review of lateral-computing techniques. Lateral-computing is based on the lateral-thinking approach and applies unconventional techniques to solve computing problems. While, most of the problems are solved in conventional techniques, there are problems which require lateral-computing. Lateral-computing provides advantage of computational efficiency, low cost of implementation, better solutions when compared to conventional computing for several problems. The lateral-computing successfully tackles a class of problems by exploiting tolerance for imprecision, uncertainty and partial truth to achieve tractability, robustness and low solution cost. Lateral- computing techniques which use the human like information processing models have been classified as \\"Soft Computing\\" in literature. Lateral-computing is valuable while solving numerous computing problems whose mathematical models are unavailable. They provide a way of developing innovative solutions resulting in smart systems with Very High Machine IQ (VHMIQ). This article has traced the transition from lateral-thinking to lateral-computing. Then several lateral-computing techniques have been described followed by their applications. Lateral-computing is for building new generation artificial intelligence based on unconventional processing.

Naming  In Irish academic Paul Tempan's Irish Hills and Mountain Names, the name derives from Cú Roí mac Daire, the legendary king of Munster who features in many Irish folklore tales including those concerning Cú Chulainn and Bláthnat. Geography Caherconree is the 2nd-highest mountain of the Slieve Mish range, which is situated at the eastern-end of the Dingle Peninsula, in Kerry. Caherconree is part of a \\"horseshoe\\" of the largest peaks in the Slieve Mish range that bound the deep glaciated valled of the Derrymore Glen, that include the mountains of Gerahane (), and Baurtregaum , the highest peak in the range. Caherconree's prominence of does not qualify it as a Marilyn, however, it ranks it as the 11th-highest mountain in Ireland on the MountainViews Online Database, 100 Highest Irish Mountains, where the minimum prominence threshold is 100 metres.Mountainviews, (September 2013), \\"A Guide to Ireland's Mountain Summits: The Vandeleur-Lynams & the Arderins\\", Collins Books, Cork, Hill walking The easiest route is the 4-kilometre 2-hour return trip from the Bóthar na gCloch road (a north- south road between the N86 and the R561 roads); from where an easterly Caherconree Fort Trail goes from the car-park to the ancient promontory fort, from which the summit of Caherconree can be easily accessed. A popular method of climbing Caherconree is via is the Derrymore Glen Horseshoe, a 11-kilometre 5-hour loop that starts from the base of the Derrymore Glen and ascends to the first summit of Gearhane, and then around the \\"horseshoe\\" to Caherconree and the summit of Baurtregaum. Options for the descent use either the Baurtregaum NW Top spur or the Baurtregaum NE Top Spur (and the Scragg) to get back to the base of the Glen. The route is recommended for its views of the Glen as well as incorporating most of the main peaks of the Slieve Mish range, and is also called The Slieve Mish Circuit in some guidebooks. Caherconree Promontory Fort Caherconree is named after an Iron Age stone promontory fort, Caherconree Promontory Fort at , that sits two-thirds of the way up its southwestern shoulder, overlooking the north-south running mountain road called Bóthar na gCloch (\\"road of the stones\\"). The fort is surrounded on three sides by steep cliffs. In Irish mythology this is the fort of Cú Roí mac Dáire, who was able to make it spin around at night to stop attackers finding the entrance. In the story of Aided Con Roí, a king's daughter called Bláthnat is taken against her will to the fort by Cú Roí. She is rescued by her lover, Cú Chulainn, to whom she signals that the time will be right to attack when she pours milk into a nearby stream; Bláthnat created the opportunity by taunting Cú Roí that his fort was too small for such a magnificent chieftain thus compelling him to take down the walls to build a bigger fort. This stream is now called the Finglas (from an Fhionnghlaise meaning \\"the white stream\\") and its source is close to the remains of the ringfort. Between the summits of Caherconree and Gearhane, is a rock feature called Fin MacCool's Chair, named after the mythical figure Fionn mac Cumhaill.

An inside forward or centre forward, he also represented Watford and Plymouth Argyle in the Southern League. Life and career Born in Ladywood, Birmingham, Hare played in the Football League in the 1890s for Aston Villa, contributing to their first league title in the 1893–94 season. He was transferred to Woolwich Arsenal in February 1895 and made his debut for the Second Division side on 9 March 1895 against Leicester Fosse, which ended as a 3–3 draw. In one-and-a-half seasons at the club he was in and out of the side, mainly playing at inside forward, although he also deputised for Joe Powell at right back. With 20 appearances and 7 goals to his name for Woolwich Arsenal, in November 1896 he moved to Small Heath. He then played for Watford in the Southern League, and is joint holder of the club record for most FA Cup goals in a season, with seven in the 1899–1900 campaign. Hare served in South Africa during the Boer War. On his return he tried to revive his career with Plymouth Argyle in the Southern League, but with little success, and he left the professional game in 1904. He ran a hotel in Liskeard, Cornwall, before returning to Birmingham where he died in 1947.

It was originally utilized by legendary basketball coach, Red Sarachek. This defense is named for its formation since there is one defender at the point, three defenders at the free throw level, and one defender at the base line. The main focus of this defensive strategy is to force turnovers. This is done by using quick, pestering defense and anticipating any passes to attempt a steal. A two-man trap is implemented in this defense. The defense attempts to guide the ball handler towards a corner and quickly close in and double team the offensive player creating a trap with the defenders and side lines. This trap often forces the ball handler to get rid of the ball prematurely taking the offense out of their set up. This often results in poor passes or shots. These poor passes are meant to be taken advantage of in this defense so the weak side defenders must anticipate passes to create turnovers.  Defense  The defensive usage of the 1-3-1 is mostly used to create turnovers, not for protecting the paint, due to only having one player down low. Teams usually have two guards to double team the ball carrier. Another variation of the 1-3-1 defense is the full court press version. The lead guard will pressure the ball in the backcourt, and also can shade over to the side and form a 2-man trap with a defensive player in the 3-set when an offensive guard tries to bring up the ball down the sideline. One effective press-break against the 1-3-1 full court press is to have either the power forward or the center to flash to midcourt and then quickly pass the weak side guard running down the sideline, not allowing the trap to be formed. There are multiple ways to approach defense in the sport of basketball. Typically they are divided into man defenses and zone defenses. The 1-3-1 zone defense is a zone defense. It falls under this category because each player guards a specific zone within the formation. This defense is named for its formation. A picture of the formation is shown on the right. In basketball positions are numbered from one to five. One and two are guards, three and four are forwards, and five is the center in a typical basketball lineup. Guards are quick and typically are good ball handlers and shooters. Forwards usually are the most athletic and are typically taller than the guards. The center is the tallest player and specializes in close vicinity to the basket. Formation In this formation, the one will take the top and meet the oncoming offensive guard. The two and three positions are split out on the edges of the court at free throw level, or on the wing. The four position is down beneath the basket and acts as a rover along the base line. The rover position is typically the best athlete’s position since there is the most area to defend around the basket. The five position is posted in the center of the formation at about free throw level. Zone responsibilities The goal of the 1-3-1 zone defense is to create turnovers. This defense focuses extra pressure on the ball handler and will exert more effort to force turnovers. Turnovers within this defense are created by a couple key features of this strategy. Two defensive players will try to trap the ball handler in one of the corners of the half court. In basketball the ball can only be held for five seconds before passing, shooting, or dribbling. If a player is trapped in the corner they tend to stop their dribble before making a decision to pass or shoot. This creates a problem for the offense but is exactly what the defense wants to happen. When a player is double teamed without their dribble they tend to make poor decisions. Often bad passes and shots are forced out by the player just to get the ball out of the corner. It is vital for players not guarding the ball handler to anticipate a bad pass or shot in order to make a steal or get a rebound. This will help create the most turnovers. Each player will have their own responsibility in the zone. They each have their own area to guard on the court. Players will also shift as the ball is moved to be in better defensive position. This means moving to a better location to cut off passes and gather rebounds. Typically, the one will take the top position. They will meet the ball handler and force them in one direction while playing close defense. Based on the direction the ball handler dribbles the defender on the wing, either the two or three position, will close in on the ball handler for a double team. The intention is to force a double team quickly and drive the offensive player into a corner of the court. The double team creates a lot of free space on the court. The other three players must shift to cover this area equally during a trap. A trap can be made at any of the four corners both at the base line and at half court. The only difference is the base line is defended by the rover and they will trap with the wing instead of the one position. By forcing these double teams the offense will make long cross court passes. These passes are more likely to get stolen because they are less accurate and travel in the air longer. More space is open during a double team so the defenders not trapping must take advantage of the long passes and force any possible turnovers Coaching strategy Defensively Coaches usually do this to throw the offense off tempo. It is thrown in to mix up the defensive look and force the offense to adjust or face flustering defensive pressure. Normally the 1-3-1 defense is used to create turnovers and is fast paced so players cannot keep it up the whole game. By applying pressure to the ballhandler the defense plans to take advantage of any mistakes forced from the pressure. The extra defensive pressure often makes the ball handler lose some composure and turn the ball over. By using this at key points in the game this strategy can change momentum, cause quick scoring shifts, and create a large enough lead to break the opponents morale. This defense is very effective if run correctly and can take a team out of the game both physically and mentally. Offensively The 1-3-1 defense attempts to fluster the offensive set up. The key to beating the 1-3-1 zone is to get the defenders out of position. This is accomplished by quickly passing the ball around the perimeter. If the offense can pass the ball before the defense traps them then the defense must shift to adjust to the new ball position. As the defense shifts passing lanes open up and defenders have to rotate to stay in position. Speeding up the tempo and running fast breaks also can beat this defense. Pushing the ball quickly up the court gives the defense little time to set up the zone. If the offense can get to the basket before the zone sets up scoring can be achieved easily. The defense can easily be beaten if composure is kept and good passes are made. Issues occur when the offense is surprised by the extra pressure and is not expecting the trap that occur in basketball. References Philo, C. \\"1-3-1 zone defense.\\" Texas Coach 48.6 (2004): 46-47.

Only eight were produced before the outbreak of World War II. Development The Scott designer William Cull had been experimenting with three-cylinder two-strokes throughout the 1930s and had developed a prototype 747 cc engine. The Scott Model 3S which was unveiled at the 1934 Olympia Motorcycle Show was a further development of this work, with the capacity enlarged to 986 cc and a four-speed gearchange. A notable feature of the Model 3S was the lubrication system, which had a throttle-operated pump drawing oil from the sump and delivering it to a geared pump, while a separate geared pump dealt with the return. Another unusual feature was that fuel was held in 'pannier' containers each side of the rear wheel so the apparent fuel tank was actually a dummy housing the instrumentation and control box (a feature later copied by the Honda Gold Wing). Only eight were produced before the outbreak of World War II. The final Model 3S is on display at the National Motorcycle Museum (UK).

After serving as an adviser to President Omar Bongo in the 1980s, he was a minister in the government of Gabon from 1990 to 1991 and again from 1997 to 2009; during that time, he was identified with the reformist wing of the ruling Gabonese Democratic Party (PDG). He held the key post of Minister of the Interior from 2006 to 2009 and then briefly served as Minister of the Coordination and Follow-up of Government Action in mid-2009.

He was President Omar Bongo's deputy adviser for African and international affairs from 1984 to 1986 and then adviser to the president for development and public and productive investments before being appointed to the government as Minister of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, and the Rural Economy in April 1990. Subsequently he was moved to the post of Minister of Human Rights and Relations with the Assemblies in November 1990. Mba Obame was viewed as a PDG reformist in the early 1990s, along with Bongo's son Ali Bongo. A 1991 legal change sought by party leaders required that ministers be at least 35 years old, thus forcing his departure from the government, along with Ali-Ben Bongo.Philippe Bernard, \\"Ali Ben Bongo, Monsieur Fils\\", Le Monde, 17 June 2009 . From 1991 to 1994, Mba Obame was Deputy Secretary-General of the Presidency of the Republic, and from 1994 to 1997 he was High Commissioner under the Minister of the Interior. In the December 1996 parliamentary election, Mba Obame won a seat in the National Assembly as a PDG candidate in Woleu-Ntem Province; he then returned to the government as Minister of Relations with Parliament and the Assemblies, as well as Government Spokesman, on 28 January 1997.\\"Décret N° 144/PR, fixant la composition du Gouvernement.\\", Journal Officiel de la République Gabonaise, January 1997, pages 2-3 .

In fact it was prevented from reaching its goal by competing proposals in Parliament, and it was limited to a line between Llanidloes and a junction with the Brecon and Merthyr Railway five miles east of Brecon. It was seventy miles in length and opened in 1864. It had found it impossible to raise share subscription, but the contractor partnership of Davies and Savin agreed to build the line and take shares in payment, The line ran through sparsely populated terrain and had steep gradients and sharp curves, so that there was little local traffic and the limited long distance business was costly to operate. Finding continued independence impossible to sustain, the company amalgamated with the Cambrian Railways in 1904. Use of the line declined in the 1930s and afterwards, and the very limited use of the line resulted in closure after the last day of operation on 30 December 1962. Crossing the centre of Wales As the main line network of England and Wales began to take shape in the 1840s, the centre of Wales remained without a railway. There were several proposals to cross the region by a trunk railway, in some cases to connect industrial England to Welsh west coast ports. For some time none of these came into effect, and it was a local line, the Llanidloes and Newtown Railway, that first occupied part of the area. It was seventeen miles long, and it opened in 1859, and it was not connected to any other railway. Newtown was a centre of the flannel manufacturing industry.R W Kidner, The Mid-Wales Railway, Oakwood Press, Usk 2003, , pages 5 to 9 The Oswestry and Newtown Railway followed in 1861; it connected to the Shrewsbury and Chester Railway at Oswestry, giving access to the railway network. Next, the Shrewsbury and Welshpool Railway made a connection to the O&NR; at Buttington in 1862, forming a route from Newtown to the English Midlands and London.Rex Christiansen and R W Miller, The Cambrian Railways: volume I: 1852-1888, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1971, , pages 35 to 40Kidner, page 15 Rhayader railway station in 1962After a number of false starts, a practicable route across Mid Wales gathered support, when in March 1859 a meeting was held to further what became the Mid-Wales Railway. At that time it was described as \\"the Mid-Wales section of the Manchester, Liverpool, Swansea & Milford Haven Junction Railway\\". This went to Parliament, competing for approval with other schemes. It was passed, but in a much truncated form, with the title the Mid-Wales Railway, to construct a line from Llanidloes to Newbridge-on-Wye by way of Rhayader. At Llanidloes it would connect with the L&NR;, and from there to the national railway network. The Act was passed on 1 August 1859; authorised capital was £150,000.Kidner, page 33Peter E Baughan, A Regional History of the Railways Of Great Britain: volume 11: North and Mid Wales, David St John Thomas, Nairn, 1980, , page 204 The line's supporters still saw it as part of a trunk express route, and the greatly reduced Parliamentary powers were, they believed, a temporary setback. Despite the sharp curves and steep gradients, the Shrewsbury Journal repeated the promoters' publicity that \\"express trains at the highest speeds reached can be run with the greatest ease and perfect security.\\" The directors believed that \\"as the line would be passing through... one of the richest mineral districts in Britain, they would seek powers to exploit any minerals found during construction.Christiansen and Miller, page 103 The company's supporters still planned to reach Llandovery as part of the onward thrust towards south-west Wales, but Brecon was also considered to be a useful destination. Other railways were approaching Brecon: also in 1859 the Brecon and Merthyr Tydfil Junction Railway (usually referred to as the Brecon and Merthyr Railway) was authorised, and the Hereford, Hay and Brecon Railway had got its authorising Act in 1857.Kidner, pages 8 and 9Christiansen and Miller, page 106 Extending southwards The low-level railway station at Builth Road in 1962The Mid-Wales Railway had no intention of terminating at Newbridge, and now tried again to get access to Llandovery. In Parliament in the 1860 session it lost out against the Central Wales Extension Railway, and had to make do with powers to join the Hereford, Hay & Brecon Railway at Glasbury, making a junction at a place later known as Three Cocks, and continuing to Talyllyn to join the Brecon and Merthyr Railway there. This had been merely a proposed branch so far as the Mid-Wales was concerned, but having lost Llandovery a second time, the MWR now treated this as its main line. This was authorised by Act of 3 July 1860. The connection to the Brecon and Merthyr Railway would give access not only to Brecon, but also to the mineral areas of Dowlais and Merthyr over that line.Christiansen and Miller, pages 108 and 109Kidner, pages 16 and 17 The Hereford, Hay and Brecon Railway would build from Hereford to Glasbury only. The Mid-Wales Railway would adopt the HH&BR; powers for a line southward from Glasbury as far as Talyllyn. This was to be over the old Hay Tramway, which was to be upgraded and realigned to make it suitable for locomotive operation. However the Mid-Wales board feared that the HH&BR; might demand an unreasonable price to surrender its line, so they arranged for the acquisition to be authorised in Parliament, by Act of 12 June 1861.Christiansen and Miller, pages 120 to 124 The continuation from Talyllyn into Brecon was also to be mostly over the Hay Tramway route, and the Brecon and Merthyr Railway would adopt the HH&BR; powers and construct that part of the route. Construction conflict On 23 July 1860, the Manchester and Milford Railway was authorised, also to start from Llanidloes and to run to Pencader.J S Holden, The Manchester and Milford Railway, Oakwood Press, Tarrant Hinton, 1979, , page 12 Although Parliament passed the M&MR; and the MWR Acts a few weeks apart, it was not noticed that for the first mile and a half from Llanidloes, the Mid-Wales Railway and the M&MR; were to occupy the same ground. When construction was being planned, this fact emerged, and each company wanted to build the duplicated section, and permit the other to use the line for a toll. Both companies refused this idea, and finally a compromise was agreed: the Llanidloes and Newtown Railway would build the duplicated part of the lines and allow the two companies to use it. The point of divergence of the two southward routes was Penpontbren, about two miles from Llanidloes.Holden, pages 15 to 17 The Manchester and Milford Railway built part of its line from Penpontbren to Llangurig, a distance of about two miles, and a single goods train traversed the stub of line, after which it became dormant.Holden, pages 43 and 44 By this time the Manchester and Milford Railway was having serious doubts about the wisdom of continuing construction over the difficult terrain to reach Llangurig from the south, and made the huge decision to divert the line to Aberystwyth instead. The Llangurig stub remained, disused, and the M&MR; paid the L&NR; interest charges and operating and maintenance costs on the enlarged Llanidloes station, which it would now never use.Holden, page 17 The effect of all this was that the MWR joined the L&NR; at Penpontbren, and not at Llanidloes, but had shared ownership (with the L&NR; and the M&MR;) of the Llanidloes station. Construction The company had found raising the subscriptions for construction almost impossible, and the contractors David Davies and Thomas Savin, enjoying considerable success in railway building in Wales, had agreed to construct the line, taking shares as most of their payment. This saved the company, which would otherwise almost certainly have failed. On 2 September 1859 the first sod of the northern part of the Mid-Wales Railway was cut at Rhayader. There was the customary banquet afterwards, and some directors made adverse remarks about Davies and Savin's financial involvement, which was felt to compromise the Board's authority. The truth was that without that money, there would have been no railway, but unnecessary friction was generated by intemperate remarks. In fact Davies and Savin themselves fell out shortly afterwards, and parted company with each other and with the company before any construction was actually started. A fresh contractor, Alexander Thomas Gordon, took on the work. Little work was done by Gordon due to continuing money shortage, and he was followed by James Overend and John Watson on 26 March 1862. Like Davies and Savin, they were to be paid in shares: 223,000 ordinary shares, 117,000 debentures and 200,000 Lloyds bonds.Christiansen and Miller, pages 107, 108 and 111Baughan, pages 208 and 209 At Talyllyn Junction (with the Brecon and Merthyr Railway) a triangular layout was adopted, and the Mid-Wales Railway built a station at the North Junction, with platforms for trains to Brecon and also to Dowlais, the latter being on the East Loop. The B&MR; built a station by the West Junction. As a result Talyllyn had two stations to serve a tiny population: in 1900 Brynderwen had nine houses and Talyllyn eleven.Kidner, pages 19, 26 and 27 A length of line extending 29 chains east from Three Cocks Junction towards Hereford was declared to be Mid-Wales property: the intention had been to make a triangular junction here, as at Talyllyn; there would have been an East Junction where the line entered the cutting to go under the Glasbury road. This was not proceeded with, but the Mid-Wales company owned what would have been the south-to-east arm of the triangle.Kidner, page 25 The Mid-Wales Railway operated a special demonstration train throughout the line on 23 August 1864. Remedial work was necessitated by the Board of Trade inspecting officer's refusal to sanction opening for passenger traffic earlier. Full goods services (apart from the east loop at Talyllyn) operated from 1 September 1864. The Hereford, Hay and Brecon Railway service from Hereford to Brecon was running by 19 September, traversing the MWR from Three Cocks Junction to Talyllyn. Ordinary Mid-Wales passenger trains probably started on 21 September, although special trains were run on 19 and 20 September for Brecon Races, with borrowed engines.Kidner, page 20Christiansen and Miller, page 113 Cambrian Railways formed Before long, the several networks centred on Newtown decided that they needed to join up with one another, and in July 1864 the Cambrian Railways company was formed by the amalgamation of four existing companies: the Llanidloes and Newtown Railway, the Oswestry and Newtown Railway, the Newtown and Machynlleth Railway, and the Oswestry, Ellesmere and Whitchurch Railway. The Mid-Wales Railway did not part,icipate in this amalgamation, but the Amalgamation Act preserved the MWR rights concerning running powers over parts of the other lines.Christiansen and Miller, page 71 Builth Wells connection The directors of the Mid-Wales Railway still hoped to get part of the traffic they had anticipated if they had reached Llandovery, as they had originally proposed. A spur connection at Llechryd to the proposed Central Wales Extension Railway would at least give the possibility of reaching Llandovery, and from there on to south-west Wales. A connection was agreed near Builth where the lines intersected, and the MWR got powers on 30 June 1864. It opened a station called Llechryd (for Central Wales) near the intersection in April 1866, and the spur was brought into use on 1 November 1866, when the Central Wales Extension Railway opened from Llandrindod Wells to Builth Road. The rest of the CWER to Llandovery was not opened until 1 June 1868. The spur was transferred to the London and North Western Railway when it took over the CWER on 4 July 1870.Christiansen and Miller, page 115 Merthyr In 1864 the Mid-Wales Railway was receiving mineral traffic from Dowlais over the Brecon and Merthyr Railway, but the connection to Merthyr, which would be more productive of through traffic, was not open until 1 August 1868. It provided a direct outlet to Cardiff and the Rhondda and Taff valleys, and from the opening day coal trains ran through from South Wales to Birkenhead. There was massive demand for coal at Birkenhead for bunkering steamships, and South Wales steam coal was particularly desirable for the purpose.Christiansen and Miller, page 117Kidner, page 23 Commercial results A train at Three Cocks Junction railway station in 1949The population of mid-Wales was tiny: there were probably under 20,000 people living in the area served by the entire line; the largest town served by the MWR trains was Brecon with a population of 5,000. Llanidloes was an important centre, but its commerce was orientated more towards Newtown and Shrewsbury. Builth had a population of 1,200 when the line was opened; Rhayader had 1,000. In consequence local business on the line was always light. Emphasis was laid more on passenger than goods services as there were few freight originating points. Goods carried in the last half of 1865 amounted to some 12,000 tons which yielded about a quarter of the gross receipts. Figures for the first half of 1865 showed that working expenses of £6,550 represented nearly 58 per cent of the receipts of £11,312. The national average at the time was 46%. The number of trains run for each mile of route was 3,425 compared with the national average of 10,095. Through goods services should have been lucrative, but the company found that the big companies, the Great Western Railway and the London and North Western Railway in particular, which had their own established trunk routes, were not prepared to quote through goods rates in competition with their own business. Half of the 36,000 tons of mineral traffic that the company carried in that period was iron ore from Northamptonshire to South Wales, routed forward over the B&MR;, and the MWR share of the transit was only between Three Cocks and Talyllyn. Moreover, the MWR found it difficult to match the GWR's quoted rates for carrying coal from South Wales to Birkenhead; the only traffic which did grow was inwards carriage of lime: in 1865, 8,000 tons were carried. A crisis came when Watson & Overend gave up their lease and stopped working the line as a result of the failure of Savin, who had backed Watson financially. At short notice the MWR company had to find an alternative way to work the line. In late February 1865 the directors tried to interest other companies in working it, including the Midland Railway and the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway, both of which were known to be interested in expanding their activities in Wales; however both declined. Under an 1871 Agreement the Mid-Wales paid the B&MR; £400 per annum plus £400 for working expenses for both the Brecon and Talyllyn stations. The B&MR; built a new station at Talyllyn; it opened on 1 October 1869. While it was being built the B&M;'s old station, called Brynderwen, could not be used, so trains from Brecon to Dowlais set back from the east junction to the platform of the Mid-Wales station on the east loop.Kidner, page 26 In 1879 the MWR's debenture holders went to Court in the Chancery Division, and a Receiver was appointed. The company had issued £275,706 in debentures and was unable to meet the interest. Nevertheless after lengthy hearings, the action was dismissed and the Receiver was discharged. The company was allowed to raise a further £40,000 in debentures, and a Scheme of arrangement was drawn up under which holders of 'A' stock would receive 4 per cent from 1st July, 1879 and of 'B' stock per cent. Most of the new capital would of course be consumed in paying back interest to existing debenture holders; it was a delaying operation, and it did not resolve anything.Kidner, page 35 Worked by the Cambrian Railways, and amalgamation In 1887 an agreement was concluded whereby the Cambrian Railways took over the working of the Mid-Wales Railway; it was to be effective from 1 January 1888.Kidner, page 39 The working agreement proved a success and encouraged thought of amalgamation. Early in 1903 the decision was taken to do so, although it was not until 28 October 1903 that measures to present an authorising Bill was finally taken. This was passed by Act of 24 June 1904, and was effective from 1 July.Rex Christiansen and R W Miller, The Cambrian Railways: volume II: 1889 - 1968, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1967, , page 52Baughan, page 211 Train services During its independent days the Mid-Wales Railway did not alter its basic passenger train service from three trains per day each way down the whole line. There were in addition short workings from Builth Wells, and sometimes other stations south, to Llechryd to make connection with the Central Wales line trains. The early timetables of the Mid-Wales Railway showed Dowlais (and Merthyr when opened) as if they were its own stations; in fact all stations from Talyllyn to Dowlais Top and Merthyr were listed.Kidner, page 40 A goods train near Doldowlod in 1949All regular passenger train crossings on the single line were at Builth Wells or Three Cocks. In 1874 a service was begun of three trains a week from Llanidloes to Neath; a Mid-Wales engine worked through to Neath. From 1880 in summertime through carriages were run from Cardiff over the Rhymney Railway via Bargoed and on over the B&MR; to Talyllyn Junction, then over the Mid-Wales and Cambrian Railways to Aberystwyth. Mid-Wales carriages were also kept at Cardiff (Queen St) and Newport (High Street). Much of this traffic went through to Cambrian Railway resorts, but some was for Llandrindod Wells, and this was handled by arranging connecting trains at Llechryd, with the Central Wales line of the LNWR. At about this time the connection at Builth Road with the Central Wales linewas altered to take passenger traffic, but it seems that passenger trains did not operate for some time. From the tourism point of view, its only value would have been to put Builth Wells on a direct service with the other \\"Wells\\" towns, Llandrindod, Llanwrtyd and Llangamarch, but this would have required a double reverse at Builth Road. In fact shuttle trains operated and passengers changed at the junction.Kidner, page 36 Elan valley reservoir railway In the early 1890s Birmingham Corporation determined that the Elan Valley could be dammed to make a reservoir to supply some of the city's needs. In 1892 the idea became a definite plan, and when implemented it was one of the greatest projects of municipal dam building. The nearest station was Rhayader and the area was remote, and would need a railway connection to reach all the dam sites. By October 1893 a junction had been made just south of the tunnel near Rhayader; the Cambrian erected a 40-lever signal box by the junction, controlling access to a loop. The Birmingham Water Works Committee worked the line itself after the initial setting-up period. The signal box and junction loop were opened in June 1894; the exchange sidings were not completed until August 1895, although a Press and VIP visit had been run on 10 July 1894.Kidner, pages 104 to 107 Some of the construction workers lived in Llanidloes, and for them a workmen's train was put on by the Cambrian early on Monday mornings, running non-stop to Rhayader; also a similar return train ran on Saturday afternoons. From 1922 A train at Llanidloes railway station in 1949The Government decided to merge most of the numerous independent railways of Great Britain into one or other of four new large companies, in a process called the \\"grouping of the railways\\" under the Railways Act 1921. The Cambrian Railways, of which the Mid-Wales Railway network was now a part, was to be a constituent of the new Great Western Railway group. Summary statistics prepared for the process showed that the Cambrian Railway group were not paying a dividend in 1921. Semmens claims that the Cambrian Railways finished the year with a good balance on its books, which showed a profit of £122,970.Semmens refers to this as \\"net income\\"; Christiansen and Miller quote the same figure but call it \\"profit\\". In either case it probably means \\"operating profit\\" and almost certainly excludes tax and interest charges.Christiansen and Miller, volume II, pages 63 and 64Peter Semmens, A History of the Great Western Railway: I: Consolidation, 1923-29, George Allen & Unwin, London, 1985, , page 32 Christiansen and Miller say \\"the increases in trade and fares were not sufficient to keep the small companies buoyant and everything was against them remaining independent any longer. Costs and wages had soared to such a level that it was impossible for a company the size of the Cambrian, which had limited potential, to meet expenses out of revenue.\\" The new Great Western Railway was formed from its seven constituents from 1 January 1922. Due to the Amalgamation Tribunal not giving its assent until March, the actual date of amalgamation was 25 March 1922. During the 1930s the Great Western made great efforts to stimulate traffic on the Mid-Wales line by excursions and cheap tickets. Such events as the Brecon Agricultural Show, the Radnorshire Show, or the Shrewsbury Floral Fete were the occasion for cheap fares or special trains, though timetabled trains were more often used. There were some remarkable long distance excursions, such as Builth Wells to Liverpool, good value at 6 shillings. Another 6 shilling trip was an excursion from Llanidloes to Barry Island on a Sunday.Kidner, page 139 Goods traffic on the line had always been varied. Although timber had been handled at two of the private sidings and stone at the Llanelwedd siding, there were no important industries; it was through traffic, apart from some local sheep transfers. Kidner quotes a foreman on the line from 1920 to 1964: there was slate from the Cambrian's northern lines going to South Wales; dolomite from the Llynclys quarry to Ebbw Vale and Dowlais, one train per day for many years. Some structural steel, fabricated or semi-fabricated, came off the Cheshire Lines railway and down through the Mid-Wales for export at Cardiff. Closure Details emerged in early Spring of 1962 of proposals to be put to the Transport Users' Consultative Committee to close all the three lines into Brecon. The last train on the Mid-Wales Railway ran on 30 December 1962.Baughan, pages 213 and 214 Rhayader yard was left open for coal concentration (not rail connected) until 5 April 1965, as were the depots at Builth Wells and Talgarth. Builth Road low level yard continued to be served by the curve from the Central Wales until 6 September 1965.Kidner, page 149 TopographyGradients= The Mid-Wales Railway ran through hilly country. From a zero mileage at Llanidloes in the Severn Valley it climbed almost continuously at typically 1 in 77 for seven miles to a summit near Pantydwr, at 947 feet above sea level. The line then descended into the Wye Valley at similar gradients, with only a short respite at St Harmons and a short climb at Rhayader. This descent continued to milepost 18 beyond Doldowlod, after which the line undulated, ending in another steep descent to Builth, 27 miles. A three mile climb to a further summit at Tir Celyn was next, then falling for six miles to Boughrood, in the Usk Valley. From Three Cocks there was another steep climb of seven miles to Tallyllyn. There were two short tunnels.Christiansen and Miller, pages 104, 105 and 109 =Locations= * Llanidloes; opened 2 September 1859; relocated by January 1862; closed 31 December 1962; station joint between Llanidloes and Newtown Railway, Mid-Wales Railway, and Manchester and Milford Ralway; line to Penpontbren Junction owned by L&NR; * Penpontbren Junction; divergence of Manchester and Milford Railway branch; start of Mid-Wales Railway; * Tylwch; opened 21 September 1864; closed 31 December 1962; * Glan-yr-Afon Halt; opened 16 January 1928; closed 31 December 1962; * Pantydwr; opened 21 September 1864; closed 31 December 1962; * St Harmons; opened June 1872; closed 31 December 1962; * Marteg Tunnel; 372 yards; * Marteg Halt; opened 18 May 1931; closed 31 December 1962; * Rhayader Tunnel; 270 yards; * Rhayader; opened 21 September 1864; closed 31 December 1962; * Elan Valley Junction; for Elan Valley Reservoir construction; * Doldowlod; opened 21 September 1864; closed 31 December 1962; * Newbridge-on-Wye; opened 21 September 1864; closed 31 December 1962; * Builth Road Low Level Junction; divergence of connecting spur to Central Wales Extension line; * Builth Road Junction; opened 1 November 1866; variously known as Central Wales Junction; then Llechryd; then Builth Road from 1 May 1889; renamed Builth Road LL 1950; closed 31 December 1962; * Builth; opened 21 September 1864; renamed Builth Wells 1865; closed 31 December 1962; * Llanfaredd Halt; opened 7 May 1934; closed 31 December 1962; * Aberedw; opened November 1867; closed 31 December 1962; * Erwood; opened 21 September 1864; closed 31 December 1962; * Llanstephan Halt; opened 6 March 1933; closed 31 December 1962; * Boughrood; opened 21 September 1864; renamed Boughrood and Llyswen 1 October 1912; closed 31 December 1962; * Three Cocks Junction; opened 19 September 1864; closed 31 December 1962; convergence of Hereford Hay and Brecon * Talgarth; opened 19 September 1864; closed 31 December 1962; * Trefeinon; opened October 1864; closed 31 December 1962; * Llangorse Lake Halt; opened 9 July 1923; closed 31 December 1962; * Talyllyn North Junction; * end of MWR and start of Brecon and Merthyr Railway; * Talyllyn West Junction; * Talyllyn; opened 21 September 1864; closed 1878; line on to Brecon.

Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 01 Jan. 2009. After the Soviet invasion of Poland, he remained in the territories annexed by the Soviet Union and worked as a communist functionary, living in Lviv. At the same time, his mother and sister were deported to Siberia. Having fled to Moscow after the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, he became one of the founders of the Union of Polish Patriots and a war correspondent and a political commissar in the Polish Army in the East. At that time he wrote much pro-Soviet propaganda. In the People's Republic of Poland, he became a writer, publishing many works supporting the ideals of communism, and a politician. He became an editor of two literary journals (Miesięcznik Literacki from 1966 to 1971 and Literatura from 1955 to 1968), and as such he had significant influence on Polish cultural policy. He was Ambassador to Switzerland from 1945 to 1947, Ambassador to France from 1947 to 1950, a deputy to the Polish Parliament from 1952 to 1961, and eventually a member of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers Party from 1964 to 1981. He was a president of the Polish Chess Federation from 1954 to 1957 and 1963 to 1973. He died in Warsaw in 1986. He is \\"Gamma\\" in Czesław Miłosz's book The Captive Mind.

He published his first works (poetry) before the war; his poetry anthologies Wczoraj powrót (\\"Yesterday the Return\\", 1935) and Droga leśna, (\\"Forest Road\\", 1938) were well received. Their main themes were revolutionary politics and beauty of the countryside. His first novel was Rzeczywistość (1947; \\"Reality\\") which draws on his experiences of the trial for communist activism in Poland before the war. His most renowned writings include the political novels Rozstaje (1954; \\"At the Crossroads\\") and Małowierni (1967; \\"Those of Little Faith\\") and the wartime novel Bołdyn (1969).

During his career, Bartholomew was twice seized by press gangs and forced to serve as a sailor in the Navy, the second occasion at the orders of Lord St Vincent following an argument. This incident provoked outrage at St Vincent's abuse of his authority and resulted in Bartholomew's promotion and employment as a surveyor. He was so successful that in 1818 he was given command of the frigate HMS Leven on which he was ordered to survey the African coast. Many of his fellow officers later became prominent geographers of the early nineteenth century, although Bartholomew died while still on the service, after falling ill with tuberculosis. Early life Born into a poor family in Linlithgowshire in Scotland, Bartholomew joined the Merchant Navy at a young age and became a highly experienced sailor, travelling to the Baltic Sea and the West Indies, working on hired merchant ships during campaigns against French islands there at the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars.. He later served on Greenland whalers, but in 1795 was seized by a press gang at Wapping and forcibly recruited into the Royal Navy. Due a superior education (although where he obtained this education is unknown), Bartholomew was rapidly promoted to midshipman, serving in numerous theatres and becoming a favourite of Admiral Sir Home Riggs Popham. Bartholomew was present at the surrender of the Dutch fleet in 1799, on HMS Romney in the East Indies and in 1802 was in charge of the ship's chronometers during a voyage to the Red Sea. The Peace of Amiens in the same year saw a reduction in the Navy and Bartholomew was placed in reserve. Advancement Frustrated at his lack of employment, Bartholomew wrote eight letters to the First Lord of the Admiralty Lord St Vincent, and often visited the Admiralty in the hope of securing an appointment aboard a ship. Infuriated at Bartholomew's insistence, St Vincent, a bitter personal and professional rival of Popham ordered Bartholomew seized and press ganged for a second time. Placed aboard HMS Inflexible as an able seaman, Bartholomew was rapidly restored to his previous rank of midshipman and subsequently to acting lieutenant. A storm of public protest was directed at St Vincent, who had overstepped his authority and the custom of the day by ordering the impressment of a serving warrant officer after a personal disagreement. When St Vincent was forced from office in April 1804, Bartholomew rejoined Popham on HMS Antelope during operations against Boulogne-sur-Mer. The same year his case was heard in Parliament, where St Vincent's actions were roundly condemned as being detrimental to the practices and morale of the Navy. In 1805, probably due to his notoriety in the aftermath of the impressment scandal, Bartholomew was formally promoted to lieutenant and served aboard HMS Diadem during the capture of the Cape of Good Hope in 1806. Later in the year, during Popham's disastrous expedition against Buenos Aires, Bartholomew was detached to conduct the first British surveys of the River Plate. In 1808, transferred to the sloop Sapphire, Bartholomew accompanied HMS Nereide under Captain Robert Corbet on a mission to transport a new ambassador to Persia. During the operation, Corbet abandoned Sapphire and another sloop Sylph in the Persian Gulf. Bartholomew's ship cruised the Persian coastline making an extensive survey, against the first by a British explorer in the region. The area was a dangerous pirate haven however and Sylph was captured and her crew massacred before Corbet returned. An expeditionary force was later despatched to the region but found itself in unfamiliar waters due to a lack of reliable charts. Bartholomew's maps of the region were published in 1810 as a direct consequence.. In July 1809, Bartholomew was given command of a transport during the Walcheren campaign and in 1810 commanded a gunboat off Cadiz in support of allied forces in the Peninsula War. In May 1811 he took over the brig HMS Richmond. On Richmond, Bartholomew attacked and defeated a French privateer Intrépide in February 1812 and was subsequently promoted to commander. In 1814, Bartholomew was in command of the rocket ship HMS Erebus off the United States during the War of 1812. In Erebus, Bartholomew was part of James Alexander Gordon's successful campaign to attack Alexandria, Virginia by sailing up the Potomac River. He then operated off Georgia and participated in the attack on the St. Marys River. For his services in America, Bartholomew was promoted to post captain and made a Companion of the Order of the Bath. Geographical services At the end of the Napoleonic Wars, Bartholomew's abilities as a surveyor and cartographer were required and he was given command of the small frigate HMS Leven off the West coast of Africa, charged with preparing detailed and accurate charts of the region. Leven's officers were all young geographers, many of whom would later achieve prominence in the field, including Alexander Vidal, William Mudge, Alexander Becher and George Frazer. Bartholomew had successfully surveyed the Azores, stretches of West Africa and was working on the Cape Verde Islands when he fell ill with tuberculosis in 1821 and died at Porto Praya on Santiago. The expedition to West Africa was taken over by William Fitzwilliam Owen, but by its completion in 1825, over half the crew had died from tropical illnesses, including Bartholomew and his teenage son George, who died on Leven in 1819. He has been described as \\"One of the unsung heroes of the surveying service\\" and is also considered exceptional for his rise from an impressed sailor to post captain at a time when this was almost impossible to achieve.

The seven men included Mandla Simon Mxinwa, Zanisile Zenith Mjobo, Zola Alfred Swelani, Godfrey Jabulani Miya, Christopher Piet, Themba Mlifi and Zabonke John Konile. It was later uncovered that the police operation that unearthed the Gugulethu Seven's plans had been in the works for some time. Prelude In the mid 1980s, there was a rise in Umkhonto we Sizwe or MK operatives, the 1961-founded, armed wing of the ANC.Wikipedia, 2013. Umkhonto we Sizwe. Available: Umkhonto we Sizwe [2013, April 29]. In response, General Griebenouw of the Western Cape Security called upon Brigadier Schoon of the Security Branch Headquarters in Pretoria as well as the assistance of the Vlakplaas, a government death squad.*Wikipedia. 2013. Vlakplaas. Available: Vlakplaas [2013, April 29]. Vlakplaas commander, Eugene de Kock chose Rian Bellingan to lead an operative team ordered to intervene with anti-apartheid operations. The men chosen as part of the team were Thapelo Johannes Mbelo, Joe Coetzer, and other Vlakplaas askaris like Gladstone Moss, Eric 'Shakes' Maluleke and Jimmy Mbane. The operative team was based in Koeberg and in early January 1986, drove into Cape Town aboard three vehicles; one was a minibus with weapons and explosives concealed inside. After failed attempts to infiltrate Mbelo into the Gugulethu Seven, Mbane and Maluleke were sent in. Mbane and Maluleke, who reported to Bellingan and Liebenberg, were successful at slipping in and gaining the trust of the Gugulethu Seven over time. At first they were given weapons and grenades and went to the home of Yamile (the squatter leader). There, they told Yamile that they were commanders from exile and showed him their weapons in the minibus. Yamile then introduced Mbane and Maluleke to Piet, a member and the supposed leader of the Gugulethu Seven. It is said that Mbane and Maluleke even helped fix Piet's faulty AK-47 at one point. Over the next two months, Mbane trained the youth in basic military combat while Maluleke gave them a political education; Piet seemed to be the only youth that had previous combat training. Mbane and Maluleke also had the youth write their own biographies, which was a standard practice in liberation movements. It was later discovered that Mbane gave those to Bellingan. Eventually, an attack was planned for 3 March that would target a police bus that took senior policemen to Gugulethu station every morning. Mbane told Bellingan and Liebenberg this, who prepared for the event. Incident On 3 March 1986, 25 heavily armed police were briefed and deployed at Wingfield Naval Base at 3 a.m. The intended target area was surrounded and occupied by police by 5 a.m. Mbane, driving a stolen bakery van, dropped the seven youth off at the site around 7:25 a.m. Allegedly, grenades were thrown by the Gugulethu Seven and the police started firing from all sides. Reports say that Piet was the only one who had time to fire back. The police officers at the scene included: Warrant Officers Barnard and McMaster, Majors Johan Kleyn, Dolf Odendal, and Stephanus Brits, Captain Charles Brazzelle, Sergeants John Sterrenberg, Andre Grobbellar and Rian Bellingan, and Constable Thapelo Mbelo. For their help in exposing and leading the Gugulethu Seven into fire, Mbane and Maluleke were given ZAR7000 - one thousand for each victim. It was later reported that Piet suffered 12 bullet wounds to his head.

The findings by Wynberg magistrate, Mr. Hoffman, were that the seven men had died in a legitimate anti-terrorist operation. In her 27 November 1996 Truth and Reconciliation Commission Gross Human Rights Violations testimony, Piet's mother Cynthia Nomveyu Ngewu said the trials in court were dissatisfying and she couldn't understand the language being spoken; the proceedings were in Afrikaans. Ngewu said she had to see her dead son being dragged with a rope around his waist, broadcast on television. The police told her that her son had shot at the police and they later came by her home to look for weapons. Ngewu later expressed her forgiveness and reconciliatory beliefs in regards to her son's killing: \\"We do not want to return the evil that perpetrators committed to the nation. We want to demonstrate humanness towards them, so that they in turn may restore their own humanity\\".MacLean, I.S. 2006. Reconciliation: Nations and Churches in Latin America.

Memorial  On 21 March 2005, Human Rights Day in South Africa, a monument was erected in Gugulethu honoring the lives of the Gugulethu Seven.

A total of 66 people were killed and another 222 injured when fire swept through the nightclub during the New Year's celebration as a band, coincidentally called \\"Burn\\", was playing.Disturbing details in Thai blaze inquiry BBC News, 4 April 2009 By another coincidence, the party was named \\"Santika's Last Night\\". The fire broke out at 00:35. and citizens of thirteen countries were among the injured. Cause of the fire No official cause for the Santika fire has been announced by investigators. Suggested causes include outdoor fireworks that set the roof on fire, sparklers lighted inside the nightclub, or an electrical explosion. One witness stated there were no pyrotechnics in the club, while another reported seeing flames on the roof after going outside to watch the midnight fireworks display. Video recordings of the indoor stage event, including the countdown to midnight, show that only ordinary holiday sparklers were used. Moreover, the fire became visible indoors approximately 10 minutes after midnight. This strongly suggests the fire originated inside the ceiling space or on the roof, allowing it to grow in intensity while going unnoticed for some time. Due to the lax enforcement of building regulations, tar paper and plastic are often used as waterproofing materials. Around 1,000 guests and employees were in the club when it burned, and deaths occurred from smoke inhalation, burns and being crushed during a stampede for the exit. Doctors stated that fumes from burning plastic could have caused people to faint after a few minutes. Santika only had one main exit, with an additional private staff exit. A third exit was locked to prevent robberies. Aftermath The injured were taken to 19 hospitals, with most taken to Bangkok Hospital. More than 100 other people were injured in this incident. Only 29 of the 61 bodies were immediately identified, of these 28 were Thais and the other a Singaporean. The bodies of those who died were wrapped in white cloth and placed in the club's car park pending removal. It took up to a week to identify the others because of extensive burns to their bodies. Pongsak Kasemsan, an official in Bangkok, ordered a preliminary investigation, with results by 4 January. After a preliminary inspection of the club's safety system, it was declared \\"substandard\\" by police Lieut. Gen. Jongrak Jutanont. It was revealed the club only had one fire extinguisher, and that the nightclub was registered as a food vendor (restaurant), meaning it was required by law to close at midnight. Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva visited the site and said, \\"The question is why they let someone take fireworks inside the pub and light them up.\\" Investigations and criminal proceedings The owner of the Santika Club was charged, along with twelve other directors. The owner was also charged with allowing an underage customer into the club after a 17-year-old student's body was recovered. He faced a further charge of carelessness resulting in death. Two parallel investigations were launched, one by the police, and one by the Ministry of Justice. The police blamed the lead singer of \\"Burn\\" for setting off fireworks on stage, and the club owner for recklessness and for illegally admitting people under the age of 19. The Ministry of Justice investigation discovered the nightclub was officially registered as a private residence and therefore had never received a fire safety inspection. It was also in a zone where nightclubs are prohibited and the city architect's signature approving the club's design had been forged. Between 2004 and 2006, police had filed 47 charges against the club's owners for illegal operation. After that, however, no charges were filed. Suspicions of corruption were raised when one of the co-owners was identified as a senior police officer. When the Ministry of Justice investigation was turned over to the police, sources close to the minister reported he was furious. On 20 September 2011, the Southern Bangkok Criminal Court found two persons – Wisuk Setsawat, the pub owner, and Boonchu Laorinath, the responsible person for pyrotechnics – guilty of negligence. Wisuth and Boonchoo were given three-year jail terms. Boonchoo was also ordered to pay 8.5 million baht in compensation to five plaintiffs, relatives of the victims. On 22 October 2013, the Court of Appeals acquitted Setsawat of gross negligence. On 25 April 2014, the Southern Bangkok Criminal Court found Setsawat guilty of excise tax violations and sentenced him to one year in prison. In November 2015, club owner Wisuk Setsawat was jailed for three years. a google street view of the side of the burnt building after a few years later showing the concrete floor and fence In popular culture *Modernine TV discussed Santika Club fire in the TimeLine on 30 March 2015 titled \\"Countdown Death Santika\\".ข่าวดังข้ามเวลา : เคาท์ดาวน์มรณะ ซานติก้าผับ (30 มี.ค.58) ReferencesExternal links Category:2009 fires Category:2009 in Thailand Category:Fire disasters involving barricaded escape routes Category:Nightclub fires started by pyrotechnics Category:Fires in Thailand Category:Nightclub fires Category:January 2009 events in Asia ","title":"Santika Club fire"},{"id":"20914917","text":"Washingborough railway station was a railway station serving the village of Washingborough, Lincolnshire.British Railways Atlas.1947. p.17 History A 1908 Railway Clearing House Junction Diagram showing railways in the vicinity of Washingborough (right) Former platforms The station was opened by the Great Northern Railway (GNR) on 17 October 1848.

Ernst rendered the strip in a realistic style \\"inspired by that of his mentors Milton Caniff and Noel Sickles.\\"St. James Encyclopedia of Pop Culture by Ron Goulart http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g1epc/is_/ai_2419100775 His Mary Worth became a prototype for the \\"gentle and sophisticated\\" soap opera strip. Eminent comic strip historian Coulton Waugh made note of Ernst's \\"smooth, smart, dressy, modern style.\\" Waugh also admired Ernst's device of drawing a group of characters in a panel without any background and—through clever use of shadow—making the figures appear to leap out of the panel.Waugh, Coulton. The Comics. New York: Luna P., 1974 (original copyright 1947). p.301 Legacy In terms of style, later strips such as Rex Morgan, M.D., Judge Parker,St. James Encyclopedia of Pop Culture by Ron Goulart http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g1epc/is_/ai_2419100775 The Heart of Juliet Jones and Apartment 3-GDon Markstein's Toonopedia http://www.toonopedia.com/marywrth.htm among others are said to have followed Ernst's lead. The Wisconsin Historical Society possesses some black and white photographs of Ernst sketching co-eds at the University of Wisconsin on February 5, 1947. Ernst is said to have chosen one of the young women to serve as the model for a new character in Mary Worth.

Although he was born not actually in Bergamo but in neighbouring Brescia, Crivelli can be regarded as one of the founders of that remarkable Bergamo tenor school which, beginning with Giacomo David and proceeding through such singers as Giovanni David, Andrea Nozzari, Domenico Donzelli and Marco Bordogni, culminated in the great Giovanni Battista Rubini.Caruselli, II, article: David, Giacomo, p. 334. Crivelli, a baritonal tenor in the eighteenth century’s Italian manner, made his first public appearance rather late, aged 28, in his native town. He sang in several other Italian theatres before his début at Milan’s La Scala in 1805, in the premiere of Mayr's opera Eraldo ed Emma. He appeared in the Italian premiere of Mozart's La clemenza di Tito at Naples's Teatro di San Carlo, in 1809. Crivelli then moved to Paris, where, at the Théâtre des Italiens in 1811, he performed what was probably his best-suited opera, Pirro by Paisiello: he afterwards performed it with lesser success in London. Despite this lack of success he gave England an important legacy in the form of his son Domenico, who settled permanently there, first as a singer and later as a singing teacher, a prominent figure in English musical life of that period. Having returned to Italy, Gaetano pursued his career for several years mainly in the northern theatres, as for example at La Scala, where he sang in La clemenza di Tito at its 1818 revival,After this it had to wait a further 133 years for another performance. cf. Giorgio Guarlerzi, 'Tito era un clemente, ma in Italia pochi lo sanno,' in Silvia Camerini (ed), La clemenza di Tito, Programme of the Teatro Municipale Valli Reggio Emilia Bologna, Nuova alfa editoriale (1988), pp. 146-47 or at Venice’s La Fenice, where he played opposite Giuditta Pasta in the first performance of Giuseppe Nicolini’s La conquista di Granata; in 1821, opposite the prima-donna Francesca Maffei Festa, in the première of Saverio Mercadante’s opera Andronico; and in 1824 in the first performance of Meyerbeer's Il crociato in Egitto, the last major opera with a role for a castrato (played then by Giovanni Battista Velluti). In his long career Crivelli distinguished himself principally for his capability to exploit to the full his bari-tenor qualities of quivering and passionate accent and expressive vigour, rather than for any florid virtuosity.Caruselli, I, article: Crivelli, Gaetano, p. 313. Thus he made a remarkable contribution to the first 19th century belcanto revival which was about to inspire the golden age of singing for which Rossini composed. He was not, however, a leading figure within that revival, perhaps because he lacked an acrobatic virtuoso technique. Crivelli died of cholera in Brescia at the age of 67. Three of his sons were also musicians. Domenico Crivelli (1793–1852) was a composer and singing teacher. Enrico Crivelli (1820-1870) sang leading baritone roles in the opera houses of Italy and Europe. Giovanni Crivelli (1801–1833) was also a baritone opera singer who died in London at the age of 32.Padoan, Maurizio (1985). \\"Crivelli\\". Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani, Vol. 31.

Over the centuries, Tuva has been part of Chinese and Mongolian empires, and shares many cultural ties with Mongolia. In 1944 it joined the Soviet Union, and Tuva is now a constituent republic of the Russian Federation. Formed in 2003 as the Tuvan National Orchestra of Traditional Instruments, the orchestra was originally directed by Aldar Tamdyn. It is now led by Conductor and Artistic Director Ayana Samiyaevna Mongush. In this unique orchestra, traditional Tuvan instruments are played alongside classical Western instruments and Soviet-era “hybrid” instruments. In addition, the musicians sing as well as play. The orchestra's repertoire often features the ancient art of Tuvan throat singing (xöömei), a remarkable technique for singing multiple pitches at the same time. Ayana Mongush is perhaps the only person in the world who can arrange and score music for such an unusual combination of instruments and voices. The orchestra is extremely versatile, at times sounding more western, at times more Tuvan. Its unique renditions of traditional Tuvan songs are especially popular in Tuva. The Tuvan National Orchestra has earned recognition throughout the Russian Federation. In 2005, just two years after its inception, it won one of the first prizes in the All-Russia Competition of Folk Orchestras and Ensembles, held in Saratov, Russia. The following year it competed in the newly configured All-Russia Competition of National Orchestras and Ensembles, held in Ulan-Ude (capital of the Republic of Buryatia, Russia), where it won the overall grand prize as well as a special prize for the most original program. It then performed in a two-day gala held in Moscow in 2008 to honor the regional winners. Orchestra members include musicians known in the West for their throatsinging (members of the groups Chirgilchin, Tyva Kyzy, and Alash), Andrei Mongush (formerly of Huun-Huur-Tu), Ai-Xaan Oorzhak, Kang-Xuler Saaya, and Nikolai Damba, among others.

The Game Boy Advance version was also released on a Twin Pack cartridge bundled with Golden Nugget Casino. Gameplay The top screen shows the community cards and the amount of money in the pot, while the bottom touchscreen shows the player's cards. The game follows the rules and nuances of the community card game Texas hold 'em. Before starting a game, the player chooses an avatar to represent themselves at the table. The player is also able to select a tell that their avatar reveals throughout the game in attempts to confuse opponents. When it is the player's turn, they can call, raise bets, go all in, or check using the bottom touchscreen of the Nintendo DS. While the player progresses through the game and win tournaments, additional avatars and new locations are unlocked. Despite the game's name of Texas Hold 'Em Poker, a variety of other poker games are also included, such as five-card stud and five-card draw. Reception Texas Hold 'Em Poker was given a score of 6.0 from video game critic website IGN, which found that although \\"[the game is] easy to play and still retains the fun of the Texas Hold ‘Em card design in a single player fashion,\\" \\"[it] still can’t beat the real deal, physical computer experience, which is why it’s a little upsetting that the design team didn’t take advantage of elements that would work better in a virtual setting – stat tracking being a key element that’s missing here.\\" They were also disappointed with the game's lack of support for the Nintendo DS' single cartridge feature to allow other Nintendo DS systems use the same cartridge to play the game together. The review concluded by noting that Texas Hold 'Em Poker was simply a passable DS game, but that it was not much better than that. The Sydney Morning Herald felt that the game's computer-controlled opponents acted appropriately; they bet when they had the upper hand and folded when they did not. Texas Hold 'Em Poker was given a score of 2.5 out of 5 from The Sydney Morning Herald. The video game magazine Nintendo Power gave the game a score of 50%, finding that the menu that asks the player to select a tell before every move got tiring quickly.

Televised on ESPN, their battle garnered a good degree of renown that year for its ebb, flow, ferocity and stifling conditions. In an interview, long time boxing commentator Al Bernstein put it thus: \\"It was in the early Kronk gym days, in the Twenty Grand Showroom in Detroit with no air conditioning. It was August and amazingly hot. In the fifth round, John LoCicero and Caveman Lee put on a round of boxing that was just beyond belief. First, LoCicero went down, got up, and hit Lee with like twenty-five unanswered punches. It was ridiculous. LoCicero ultimately got knocked out in that round and it was about as exciting as anything I've ever seen.\\"Sports Review Magazine Indeed, in another interview Berstein mentioned this round ahead of Hagler/Hearns and Castillo/Corrales when relating the best rounds he had ever seen. The other notable item in Lee's boxing background is more ignominious. When Lee's Kronk stablemate Mickey Goodwin was slated to challenge Marvin Hagler for the Middleweight Championship, but suffered a training injury, Lee stepped in to replace him. Unfortunately, Lee didn't have quite the showing against Hagler as he had against LoCicero. Lee was blown out in just over a minute.GoogleBooks.com Hagler-Lee middleweight title fight On Sunday, March 7, 1982 in Atlantic City, NJ, Lee fought undisputed world middleweight champion Marvin Hagler in a nationally televised bout on ABC in which Keith Jackson provided solo commentary. Lee started well, landing a good left hook on Hagler's face within the first 20 seconds. However, Hagler jolted Lee with a straight right hand, and knocked him down with a crisp left-right combination. Lee toppled forward to the canvas. He rose on shaky legs and took a mandatory eight count. Referee Larry Hazzard permitted the bout to continue. Hagler relentlessly attacked the challenger, driving Lee against the ropes. Hazzard stopped the fight as Lee was falling into the ropes. There was no controversy about the stoppage as Lee was clearly woozy and needed Hazzard's assistance to get to his corner. The contest lasted a mere 67 seconds. Retirement After boxing, Lee's story also ran into unfortunate results. He did three different stints in prison for armed robbery. However, once paroled for that third time, he found a job at an auto parts yard and was working there into 2008.DetNews.com – Special Reports Additional information Lee's nickname \\"Caveman\\" was due to the sideburns he wore in the late 1970s.

They have released two albums. History Formed in early 1978, the initial line-up was Ian Lowery (vocals), Andy Griffiths (bass, vocals), John Hammond (lead guitar, vocals), and Bruce Archibald (drums), and this line-up recorded the band's debut single, \\"New Way\\", which was issued in April 1979.Strong, Martin C. (2003) \\"Wall\\", in The Great Indie Discography, Canongate, Glasper, Ian (2004) Burning Britain: The History of UK Punk 1980 - 1984, Cherry Red Books, Played regularly by BBC Radio 1 disc jockey John Peel, the single sold more than 10,000 copies. This success led Lowery and Griffiths to relocate to London, although Hammond and Archibald didn't follow them and were replaced by Nick Ward on guitar, and by Rab Fae Beith, former drummer with Patrik Fitzgerald (who The Wall had toured with) and The Pack. After meeting Paul Cook and Steve Jones, the two former Sex Pistols decided they wanted to work with the band, and produced the next single, \\"Kiss the Mirror\\" / \\"Exchange\\", The Wall becoming the first punk band to be produced by an ex Pistol. Rab became the band's manager, and when their first label Small Wonder ceased operating, he got them a deal with Fresh Records and went into the studio to record the next single \\"Ghetto\\". Although originally recorded with Lowery on vocals, it would be re-recorded with new singer Ivan Kelly (formerly of Ruefrex). Lowery had decided that Ward should be replaced, but the rest of the band disagreed and instead decided that Lowery should go. Lowery went on to form Ski Patrol (with Archibald) and The Folk Devils, as well as recording solo work. He died in 2001. Former Straps guitarist Andy Forbes was also added to the line-up when Ward decided to leave the band. The debut album, Personal Troubles and Public Issues was released in late 1980. After an unprovoked drunken attack by Kelly on an elderly man while the band were walking through London, the singer was immediately sacked from the band, with Griffiths taking over on vocals. The band were given a support slot on the Stiff Little Fingers Go For It national tour, which was a great success and recorded the Remembrance EP to coincide with the dates, with a stand-in bassist playing in the live shows.Larkin, Colin (1992) The Guinness Who's Who of Indie and New Wave Music, Guinness Publishing, On returning from the tour, Claire Bidwell of The Passions joined on bass guitar, leaving Griffiths free to concentrate on vocals. The band's second album, Dirges and Anthems was released in April 1982, the band now signed to Polydor Records. Polydor insisted that \\"Epitaph\\" be released as a single, but it was outsold by the Hobby for a Day EP released on Fresh Records shortly before, and the band were dropped by Polydor. The Wall were reduced to a duo of Beith and Griffiths, who soldiered on for one last effort, the Day Tripper EP in late 1982, before the group split up for good. Beith had a short spell with And Also the Trees before joining UK Subs in 1984, and running his own RFB record label. He later worked as a motorcycle mechanic. A collection of the band's independent releases was issued in 1998 on Captain Oi!. In August 2007, the band reformed for a headline appearance at the Blackpool Rebellion with 7 of the original members, Andy Griffiths (vocals), Nick Ward (guitars), Al Gregg (guitars & bass), Andrew Forbes (guitars), John Hammond (guitars), Claire Bidwell (bass) and Mark Dyvig (drums) with a warm-up gig the previous night at The Thatched House in Stockport. This was followed by the release of a new live album in August 2009 on Captive Records (Opus Productions/Captive Records).

Nearby villages include Mickfield, Little Stonham and Pettaugh. Its population in 2011 was 601. The village has a primary school. It is set in farmland, but has a busy main road, A1120, running through. History Settlement at Stonham Aspal dates back to the Roman hypocaust period. It is mentioned in the 1086 Domesday Book as Estuna in the Bosmere hundred of Suffolk, with 2 villagers, 4 smallholders and 11 freemen. One-and-a-half lord's plough teams and two men's plough teams are also mentioned, along with a seven-acre (2.8 ha), meadow, woodland for 80 pigs, a church and church lands. In 1066 the lord was Aelmer, in 1086 Miles de Belefol. From 1292, the lord of the manor was Roger de Aspale. The 13th-century name \\"Stonham\\" translates as \\"Stone Homestead\\". Many houses in the village today are from the 14th and 15th centuries. The main occupation for men, according to census data in 1881, was agriculture. The village became known as Stoneham Antegan in 1361.National Archives: Feoffment – Robert Spenser of Stonham Antegan (Stonham Aspal) to Edmund de Walsham, chaplain. Reference: HD 1538/365/15. Accessed April 2020.Parish: Stonham Aspal (formerly Stonham Antegan), Suffolk Heritage. Accessed April 2020. Stonham Aspal underwent governmental boundary changes over time. Its hundred court merged in 1327 with Claydon Hundred to become the larger Bosmere-and-Claydon Hundred, although delineation of the old hundreds still defined separate districts. Suffolk, Or, Original Delineations, Topographical, Historical, and Descriptive of that County: The Result of Person Survey. Frederic Shoberl, publ. J. Harris, 1818 - Suffolk (England) - 413 pages. Page 217. Accessed April 2020. It belonged to Bosmere Registration District from 1894 until its abolition in 1934, then to Gipping registration district, which gained 14,427 in population from absorbing Bosmere. In 1983, Gipping merged into Gipping and Hartismere registration district until 2010, then becoming part of Suffolk registration district. Total population of Stonham Aspal civil parish, Suffolk, as reported by the census of population from 1801–2011 Decennial census data for Stonham Aspal began in 1801. The earliest recorded population, from that time, was 578. The highest figure to be recorded by a census was 814 in 1851, and the lowest was 418 in 1961. In the 1870s, Stonham Aspal was described as: :\\"STONHAM-ASPALL, a parish, with a village, in Bosmere district, Suffolk; 4½ miles NE of Needham-Market r[ailway]. station. It has a post-office under Ipswich. Acres, 2,399. Real property, £4,957. Pop. in 1851, 814; in 1861, 694. Houses, 156.\\" Agriculture, the main industry recorded for the village in 1881, accounted for about 39 per cent of employment. This sank to 6 per cent by 1961, in line with a general English shift from primary work to the secondary and tertiary sectors. It also explains why the highest employment proportion is about 14 per cent for manufacturing. On the graph for 1881 occupational orders, the highest number of males worked in agriculture; the equivalent figure for females is unknown. This could be explained by many being housewives and not expected to work in that period, as the next highest proportion of employment is domestic work. The writer, poet and miniature portrait painter Mary Matilda Betham was born in Stonham Aspal in 1776 and raised there. She was the daughter of William Betham, the headmaster of the endowed school. Housing and transport Stonham Aspal is in the Stonhams District ward and described by the Office for National Statistics as a \\"village surrounded by inhabited countryside\\". The main housing types are detached, semi-detached, flats and terraced, with housing ownership being private and social housing. The average house price sale for the area in the period from August 2013 to January 2014 was £221,458.33, the majority being detached, at an average price of £265,800. Stonham Aspal Church of England Voluntary Aided Primary School caters for ages 5–11. It had 189 pupils on its roll in the school year September 2013–July 2014. The school gained a total of 97 per cent of students in 2013 achieving Level 4 or above in reading, writing and maths, which was an improvement of 7 per cent over the previous year. A school inspection by Ofsted on 15 January 2013 rated the school \\"Good\\".

Other stations close by include Needham Market (6.20 km) and Elmswell (8.93 km). There are two Monday–Saturday public bus services serving the village. The Simonds route 114 runs between Ipswich and Diss, the Galloway European Coachlines route 115 between Wetheringsett and Ipswich. This is no Sunday bus service at present. Places of interest The Ten Bells Stonham Aspal The former Ten Bells Inn is one of 45 Grade II Listed Buildings in Stonham Aspal listed on 26 March 1987. It dates back as an inn to the late 18th century and was extended in the mid-19th century and again in the mid-20th. The Ten Bells re-opened at the end of 2014 as Casa Mexico, a shop specialising in Mexican products. St Mary and St Lambert Church, the only place of worship in the village, is an Anglican church. In 1742 Theodore Eccleston, the local squire, replaced a ring of five bells with one of ten and a bell chamber was built to house them. This explains why the bell chamber is a separate structure to the church. The local pub takes its name from the chimes. Within the church there is very little coloured glass apart from medieval fragments in the aisle and two easternmost clerestory windows. St Lambert in the church's name does not derive from St Lambert as such, but from the name of the Lamberts, owners of the Manor. The Suffolk Owl Sanctuary, supported by voluntary donations and admission charges, was founded as a registered charity in 2001. It is currently open to the public all the year round and holds over 80 raptors at the centre. It \\"operates a comprehensive facility for the care & rehabilitation of owls from the region, and the promotion of owl conservation throughout the UK and beyond.\\" Amenities Stonham Aspal Women's Institute was founded in 1923. Through the Suffolk East Federation of Women's Institutes, it is affiliated to the National Federation of Women's Institutes, the UK's largest voluntary organisation for women. Stonham Barns is a leisure and retail facility with free entry, currently including fishing lakes, crazy golf, a beauty salon, an Aquatics and Reptile Centre, clothes shops and restaurants. It hosts the mid and west-Suffolk show, which consists of arena demonstrations and displays, steam and classic car exhibitors and a range of stalls. Stonham Aspal Football Club was founded in 1959 out of the Stonham Aspal School old pupils' club. It entered the Ipswich and District League Division 3 in the 1960/61 season. The League is now the Suffolk and Ipswich League. At the beginning of the 1970/71 season a reserve team was formed and entered in Division 5. The club is currently sponsored by Stonham Barns.

However, Robert du Mont confirms it was Lombardy. Roger became a monk of the Abbey of Our Lady of Bec, Normandy and skilful jurist, teaching civil and canon law in England. As a supporter of the Empress Matilda against Stephen of Blois in the succession to the throne of England, he attracted royal opposition, and had to return to the abbey in Normandy. After the death of Abbot Létard, Roger was elected the seventh abbot of Bec on 6 July 1149, and blessed by Archbishop Hugh of Rouen on 25 July 1149. As the head of the rich Norman abbey, Roger began to renovate the abbey church, whose first stone was laid by Rotrou, Bishop of Évreux on 14 August 1161 and its consecration was celebrated in April 1178 before King Henry II of England. Roger also had a hospital built, which included one of the rooms for travellers, renovated the dormitory, and dug canals to carry water from two sources to the monastic apartments. With the other bishops and abbots of Normandy, Roger attended the ceremony at Avranches of the absolution of King Henry II for the murder of Thomas Becket.

Described by The Motor Cycle as \\"The Rolls-Royce of Motor Cycles\\", production ended with the outbreak of World War II in 1939. Development The SS80 (Super Sports) model was developed in 1920, soon after George Brough set up Brough Superior. The SS80's model designation was based on Brough's guarantee that it could reach . Finished to a standard that put it well beyond the reach of most motorcyclists, the SS80 set out the key features of all Brough Superior models to follow. Thirty-two SS80s were built in 1935. Early models used the J.A.P. sidevalve engine which was expected to be superseded by the overhead valve Brough Superior SS100 when it was introduced at the end of 1924, but SS80 sales continued well and in 1935 the SS80 was fitted with the Matchless V-twin engine, similar to the one fitted to the Matchless Model X but with Brough's modified big end arrangement. Before production ended with the outbreak of World War II in 1939, 1,086 SS80's were manufactured in total, of which 460 were Matchless- engined. SS80 De Luxe The SS80 \\"De Luxe\\" specification included a fully sprung rear wheel, bottom link front forks, a patented rolling stand, pillion footrests and a specially tuned engine. Racing success George Brough used a specially-tuned SS80 he nicknamed 'Spit and Polish' (so called because of the immaculate finish he always maintained) to become the first sidevalver to lap the Brooklands track at over . The same motorcycle went on to win 51 out of 52 races. The only time it failed to win was due to a puncture. Brough became famous as a competition rider and only retired from racing following a serious crash which left him recovering for eight months in hospital receiving skin grafts, as he never wore protective clothing.

History The castle was once the seat of the Upper Carniolan holdings of the noble house of Ortenburg. First mentioned in 1263 as castrum Waldemberch, it was administered by the knights of Waldenberg, themselves first recorded in 1228 with a Fridericus de Waldenberch. After the death of Count Friderik III of Ortenburg in 1418 at the castle, the lordship of Lipnica was inherited by the counts of Celje; after their extinction in 1456 the castle became a ducal holding. Its castellans included the houses of Heunsberg, Dulacer, Velacer and Stain (of Kamen pri Begunjah), and the Lambergs. The lordship of Lipnica was managed by the Kacijanar family, the counts of Dietrichstein, and others, until the counts of Thurn merged it with Radovljica around 1600. Lipnica Castle had been abandoned by then, having burned down in the 16th century and not deemed worth repairing. The core of the ruins consists of an impressive Romanesque palacium, likely dating to the 12th century. In culture In 1939, the writer Josip Lavtižar set a historical novel at the castle. It is also the setting of the play Pusti grad (\\"Deserted Castle\\") by Polona Škrinjar.

It is the largest subdivision of the region known as the Ozark Mountains, less rugged in comparison to the Boston Mountains in Arkansas, the highest part of the Ozarks. The Ozark Highlands ecoregion has been subdivided into eleven Level IV ecoregions, seven of which lie completely within Missouri. Level IV ecoregionsSpringfield Plateau (39a)= The Springfield Plateau is the only Ozark Highland Level IV ecoregion within all four states. The nearly level to rolling Springfield Plateau is underlain by cherty limestone of the Mississippian Boone Formation and Burlington Limestone; it is less rugged and wooded than Ecoregions 38, 39b, and 39c, and lacks the Ordovician dolomite and limestone of Ecoregions 39c and 39d. Karst features, such as sinkholes and caves, are common. Cold, perennial, spring-fed streams occur. Upland potential natural vegetation is primarily oak–hickory and also oak–hickory–pine forests; savannas and tallgrass prairies also occurred and were maintained by fire. Today, most of the forest and almost all of the prairie have been replaced by agriculture or expanding residential areas. Poultry, cattle, and hog farming are primary land uses; pastureland and hayland are common. Application of poultry litter to agricultural fields is a non-point source that can impair water quality. Total suspended solids and turbidity values in streams are usually low, but total dissolved solids and hardness values are high.

Cold, perennial, spring-fed streams occur. It is more rugged and wooded than the lithologically similar Springfield Plateau and the lithologically dissimilar Central Plateau. Potential natural vegetation is oak–hickory and oak–hickory–pine forests. Shortleaf pine grows on the thin, cherty soils of steep slopes, and is more common than in Ecoregion 39a, 39c, and 39d. Scattered limestone glades occur, but are less extensive than on the dolomites of the lithologically distinct Ecoregion 39c. Today, Ecoregion 39b remains dominated by forest and woodland.

Soils are usually thin, rocky, steep, and nonarable. Flat land is uncommon except along the White River. Ecoregion 39c is lithologically unlike another highly dissected portion of the Ozarks, Ecoregion 39b, where Mississippian cherty limestone of the Boone Formation predominates. Clear, cold, perennial, spring-fed streams are common, but dry valleys occur. Potential natural vegetation is oak–hickory forest, oak–hickory–pine forest, and cedar glades. Glades are more extensive than elsewhere in Arkansas, and occur on thin, droughty soils derived from carbonates. Pine is most common on steep, thin, cherty soils. It includes Table Rock Lake, Bull Shoals Lake, Lake Norfork, and Beaver Lake. Turbidity and total suspended solids are usually low in its streams and rivers, but total dissolved solids and hardness values are high. The ecoregion covers within Arkansas and Missouri, with 73% in Missouri. =Central Plateau (39d)= The Central Plateau is an undulating to hilly portion of the Salem Plateau that is dominated by agriculture. Ecoregion 39d is largely underlain by cherty Ordovician dolomite and limestone; it is lithologically distinct from another slightly dissected part of the Ozarks, the Springfield Plateau. Karst features occur. The Central Plateau is less rugged and wooded than Ecoregions 38, 39b, and 39c. Natural vegetation is oak–hickory forest, oak–hickory–pine forest (often on soils derived from sandstone), barrens (on thin soils), and scattered cedar glades (on shallow, rocky, droughty soils from dolomite or limestone). Today, pastureland, hayland, and housing are common, but remnant forests and savannas occur in steeper areas. Turbidity, total suspended solids, total dissolved solids, and hardness values are often higher than in Ecoregions 39a and 39c. The largest Level IV ecoregion, it covers within Arkansas and Missouri, with 72% in Missouri. =Osage/Gasconade Hills (39e)= The Osage/Gasconade Hills ecoregion is more densely forested and dissected than the lower relief Central Plateau to the south. Steep slopes and narrow ridges of carbonate and sandstone underlie soils which are rocky and thin. Outcrops of Gasconade Formation with some sandstone are found throughout the region along with areas of Roubidoux Formation, Jefferson City- Cotter dolomites and scattered Mississippian limestone outliers in the western portion. Numerous caves, springs, calcareous wet meadows, losing streams, and streams with entrenched valley meanders are common. Streams flow generally northward and drain into the Missouri River. The potential natural vegetation is predominantly mixed oak forest, with oak-pine forest and some pine forests in the southeast areas of the region and some small limestone and sandstone glades. The northeastern edges of this region are transitional and blend into the Interior River Valleys and Hills ecoregion. The region covers within Missouri. =St. Francois Knobs and Basins (39f)= The St. Francois Knobs and Basins ecoregion contains the oldest geologic formations in the state and has a different landscape than surrounding regions. The igneous bedrock knobs of Precambrian granite, rhyolite, and intermediate rocks rise above the intervening basins which are underlain by Cambrian sedimentary rocks, primarily carbonate with some sandstone. This is the only region within the Ozark Highlands that generally lacks karst topography. Streams are smaller than in neighboring regions but have a greater fall distance because of the steep topography. Sedimentary-derived soils may be stone free, not cherty as in neighboring regions. The soil mantle is generally shallow with low fertility, except in the basins, which have a thicker, more loamy layer. The potential natural vegetation includes scrub oak, post oak, and blackjack oak forests and glade areas, along with prairie in the basins and valleys. Most of the region is in forest and woodland, with cleared land limited to the small basin-like valleys used for pasture and limited cropland. Lead mining has been an important activity in this region for over two centuries and significant scarification has occurred. Other mineral resources include granite and, to a limited extent, silver, copper, and cobalt, by-products of lead mining. The region covers within Missouri. =Meramec River Hills (39g)= The Meramec River Hills ecoregion is deeply dissected, with steep-sided hills and chert- covered ridges. The hills tend to be more rugged than in the Osage/Gasconade Hills ecoregion to the northwest. Land use is mainly timber and recreation, with some pastureland for grazing, and barite and iron mining in the southeast. The potential natural vegetation in this region is shortleaf pine- oak forest and woodland, with a greater oak concentration than in forests of the Current River Hills to the south. Streams in this region drain northeast into the Mississippi River. The region covers within Missouri. =Current River Hills (39h)= In many ways, the physiography of the Current River Hills ecoregion is similar to that of the Meramec River Hills to the north. However, this region has many endemic species not found in other Ozark regions and the potential natural vegetation here has a greater pine concentration than in regions to the north and west. The region underwent intensive timber cutting in the early decades of the twentieth century. It now sustains major recreational activities. The stream valleys contain numerous, large, high- quality springs and water quality is generally better than elsewhere in Missouri. Caves and losing streams are common. Streams drain southeast into the Mississippi River. The region covers within Missouri. =Eastern Ozark Border (39i)= The Eastern Ozark Border ecoregion is a transitional area between the interior ecoregions of the Ozark Highlands and the Interior River Valleys and Hills ecoregion to the east. Moderately dissected hills and sheer bluffs typify the region. Soils can be rocky and thin on steep slopes, with areas of claypan or loess similar to the Black River Hills Border to the southwest. Compared to the Central Plateau, however, the loess mantle in this region tends to be deeper and more expansive on the uplands. Potential natural vegetation is a mix of oak forest, savanna, glades, and prairies. Land cover is variable with forests, woodlands, and cleared areas in cropland and pasture. This ecoregion has more cropland agriculture than adjoining Ozark regions. The region covers within Missouri. =Black River Hills Border (39j)= The Black River Hills Border is a transitional region with broad, flat inter-stream divides and moderately dissected hills. There is significantly less relief than in neighboring hill regions in the Ozark Highlands but greater relief than in the southeastern Mississippi Alluvial Plain. Soils are thin and rocky on steeper slopes, with claypan and loess in more level areas. More soils are derived from sandstone and loess, in contrast to interior Ozark Highlands regions which have soils mainly derived from dolomite. Potential natural vegetation is a mix between Ozark species on uplands and Mississippi Alluvial Plain species in river bottoms. Land cover is predominantly forest and woodland with a scattering of pastureland and cropland in the cleared valley bottoms. This region has the highest precipitation in the Ozark Highlands with per year. The region covers within Missouri. =Prairie Ozark Border (39k)= The Prairie Ozark Border ecoregion shares characteristics with both the Wooded Osage Plains and adjacent regions within the Ozark Highlands. Topography is mostly smooth to gently sloping plains, and soils, derived from loess and cherty limestone, tend to support more cropland than other Ozark regions. The area shares the same bedrock, Mississippian to the north, and Ordovician to the south, as nearby Ozark regions. Streambeds are generally rocky and tend to be more Ozarkian in structure than those found in the Wooded Osage Plains to the west. The biotic composition and potential natural vegetation reflect the transition from a predominantly prairie landscape in the northwest to a more wooded landscape of the interior Ozark Highlands. The region covers within Missouri.

Data were taken between 1965 and 1971 using the Big Ear radio telescope at the Ohio State University Radio Observatory (OSURO), also known as the \\"Big Ear Radio Observatory (BERO)\\". The survey covered 94% of the sky area between the limiting declinations of 63°N and 36°S with a resolution at 1415 MHz of 40 arc minutes in declination. The survey was carried out primarily at a frequency of 1415 MHz but observations were also made at 2650 MHz and 612 MHz. Roughly 19,620 sources were identified over the course of the survey of which 60% were previously uncatalogued. The survey was unique in that it covered a larger portion of the sky, to a greater depth, and at a higher frequency, than any previous survey. In addition, all previously catalogued sources were tabulated and maps of the areas surveyed were included with the positions of all catalogued sources. Sources discovered in the course of the survey were assigned names according to a coordinate numbering system consisting of a two- letter prefix followed by three digits. The first letter, O, stood for Ohio, and the second letter, B–Z inclusive (omitting O) indicated the source right ascension in hours (0–23 inclusive). The first digit indicated the declination zone in increments of 10°, while the last two digits give the right ascension to the nearest one-hundredth of an hour. Data reduction for the survey was done using a computer program developed by John D. Kraus and Robert S. Dixon. The Ohio Sky Survey was published in seven installments and two supplements.

It was located at 44-48 Great Cumberland Place in the Marylebone district. History It was founded in 1920 by Margaret Russell, Lady Ampthill in her capacity as Chairman of the Voluntary Aid Detachment of nurses during World War I, and was intended to be \\"a first class Ladies' Club\\" for veteran nurses of the VAD. The club opened with its inaugural dinner on 14 June 1920, with a 999-year lease acquired on premises at Queen Anne House, 28 Cavendish Square. The building was formerly Marshall Thomson's Hotel, which is described in William Makepeace Thackeray's Vanity Fair . The club's dining room was originally staffed by VAD veterans from the war. The Cavendish Square building was damaged by a fire bomb during the Blitz. In 1957, the club sold its clubhouse, and moved in 1959 to its new premises in Great Cumberland Place, which required extensive modernisation - bomb damage from the war meant that the interior had to be almost entirely rebuilt from scratch. Between vacating the old building in September 1958 and moving to the new one in December 1959, the club's members were welcomed at several other London clubs on a temporary basis. After the move, membership was then offered to members of the defunct Cowdray Club and Guide Club, as well as women of the Magistrates Association and the Women's Voluntary Service. Men were also finally admitted. The club closed in 2014 and, after period of negotiation, the remaining members were invited to join the Naval and Military Club.

Background  Zheng Xunyu was born in 738, during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong. His family was from Zheng Prefecture (鄭州, in modern Zhengzhou, Henan). It claimed ancestry from the ducal house of the Spring and Autumn period state Zheng and traced its ancestry through a line of officials of Han Dynasty, Jin Dynasty (265-420), Han Zhao or Later Zhao, Former Yan or Later Yan, Northern Wei, Northern Zhou, and Tang Dynasty. His grandfather Zheng Changyu () served as a prefectural prefect, while his father Zheng Liang () served as a county magistrate.New Book of Tang, vol. 75. Zheng Xunyu lost his father prematurely. After the Anshi Rebellion erupted in 755, he took his mother into Mount Luhun (陸渾山, in modern Luoyang, Henan) and supported his mother there, not returning to Zheng Prefecture. After the rebellion was quelled, there were three occasions when the officials Liu Yan and Zhang Xiancheng () recommended him to be an official at the county level, and each time he declined the recommendation. During the Dali era (766-779) of Emperor Xuanzong's grandson Emperor Daizong, Zheng passed the imperial examinations in the special class of those who submitted constructive criticism. He was made Dali Pingshi (), a judge at the supreme court (大理寺, Dali Si). He was later made the secretary general at Yangzhai County (陽翟, in modern Xuchang, Henan), and, after he served with distinction there, was made the sheriff of Wannian County (萬年, in modern Xi'an, Shaanxi), one of the two counties making up the Tang capital Chang'an.New Book of Tang, vol. 165 .  During Emperor Dezong's reign  After Cui Youfu became chancellor in 779 during the reign of Emperor Daizong's son Emperor Dezong, Cui promoted Zheng Xunyu to be Zuo Bujue (), a low-level consultant at the examination bureau of government (門下省, Menxia Sheng). He later served as a secretary to the military governor (Jiedushi) of Jingxuan Circuit (涇原, headquartered in modern Pingliang, Gansu), and then returned to Chang'an to serve as an imperial censor with the title Shiyushi () then Xingbu Yuanwailang (), a low-level official at the ministry of justice (刑部, Xingbu). He later left governmental service to observe a mourning period for his mother when she died, and after the mourning period was over, he was moved to the ministry of civil service affairs (吏部, Libu). Early in Emperor Dezong's Zhenyuan era (785-805), he made an order that 10 central government officials be made magistrates of various counties in the Chang'an and Luoyang regions, and Zheng, while retaining his office, was made the magistrate of Fengxian County (奉先, near Chang'an). The next year, he got promoted to the prefect of Rao Prefecture (饒州, in modern Shangrao, Jiangxi), and later returned to Chang'an to serve as Jianyi Daifu (), a high-level consultant; and then was made the deputy minister of civil service affairs (吏部侍郎, Libu Shilang). Later, Zheng was made the mayor of Henan Municipality (河南, i.e., the Luoyang region). Before he could arrive at Henan, there was a birthday for Emperor Dezong, and it was customary for the mayors of the special municipalities to offer horses as tributes. A subordinate of Zheng's requested that he be permitted to fetch a horse to be offered, but Zheng refused, stating, \\"It is appropriate for someone who has not started serving to offer tributes?\\" It was also said that Zheng was serious and quiet in his character, and that he did not ask private favors of others; as a result, people did not dare to ask him for private favors. Once he arrived at Henan, he governed the city without much fanfare, and rested the people by lowering taxes and increasing stipends. At that time, the general Han Quanyi () was in charge of attacking the rebel general Wu Shaocheng.As Han's campaign against Wu was in 800, Zheng must have been mayor around that time as well. See Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 236. Henan was responsible for shipping the army's supplies to Han, and Zheng responded by storing food at Yangzhai, reducing the burden of the people in shipping the supplies. Whenever Han and the eunuchs monitoring the army had demands on Henan, Zheng would not agree with those demands unless there were imperial edicts authorizing them. When his subordinates worried for him that this would offend Han and the eunuchs, Zheng responded: Zheng's capability in governing the city was compared to a predecessor, Zhang Yanshang, but he was said to be more serious, lenient, and righteous than Zhang. He was later recalled to serve as deputy minister of civil service affairs again. In 803, he was given the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (), making him a chancellor, along with Gao Ying.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 236. At that time, one of Emperor Dezong's close associates, Li Shi () the Prince of Dao, was the mayor of Jingzhao Municipality (京兆, i.e., the Chang'an region), and Li was well known for being harsh in his tax collections in order to offer tributes to Emperor Dezong. Zheng, disliking the practice, questioned him: At that time, however, Li was trusted by Emperor Dezong, and therefore suffered no ill consequences from Zheng's investigation.  During Emperor Shunzong's and Emperor Xianzong's reigns  In 805, Emperor Dezong died and was succeeded by his son Emperor Shunzong. Emperor Shunzong made Zheng Xunyu the minister of civil service affairs (吏部尚書, Libu Shangshu) and still a chancellor. At that time, Emperor Shunzong's close associate Wang Shuwen had become very powerful and was allied with Zheng's chancellor colleague Wei Zhiyi. On an occasion, when the chancellors, as per custom, were having lunch together, Wang wanted to see Wei and went to the office of the chancellors to do so. When a guard refused to let Wang in, Wang rebuked the guard and ordered him away. Wei rose from his seat and walked away to confer with Wang. Zheng, and the other chancellors Du You and Gao Ying, stopped dining and waited for Wei to return. After a while, they sent the guard to see what the situation was, and the guard stated, \\"Wang Shuwen had requested food, and Chancellor Wei is dining with him.\\" Neither Du nor Gao dared to say anything, but Zheng stated, \\"How can I remain here still?\\" He had his attendants fetch horses, and he went home and stayed there for seven days, refusing to leave his bed. Several months later, when Emperor Shunzong, then seriously ill, passed the throne to his son Emperor Xianzong, Zheng and Gao were removed as chancellors. Zheng himself died several months later and was given posthumous honors and the posthumous name Wenxian (文獻, meaning \\"civil and wise\\"). His sons Zheng Tan and Zheng Lang later served as chancellors during the reigns of Emperor Wenzong and Emperor Xuānzong, respectively.

Apollinare is a former pontifical university in Rome, named after St. Apollinaris of Ravenna. Its facilities are now occupied by the Pontifical University of the Holy Cross. Initially, the Palace of St. Apollinare was used as a residence for various cardinals, until 1574, when Pope Gregory XIII gave the building to the Jesuits for the German College. History Previously the premises was the site of the Palace of St. Apollinare in the northern area of the Piazza Navona. Around 1417, Martin V gave Cardinal Branda da Castiglione the use of the Palazzo di Sant'Apollinare in the Piazza Navona.Carroll William Westfall, \\"Alberti and the Vatican Palace Type\\", Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians 33.2 (May 1974:101-121) p. 102 note 3. In 1455, Cardinal Guillaume d'Estouteville took up residence there, and built the Church of S. Agostino just to the east. =Collegium Germanicum et Hungaricum= Collegio Germanico, 1755 In January 1574, Pope Gregory XIII granted the property to the Jesuits as the seat of the Collegium Germanicum. Founded by Ignatius Loyola, it is, after the Capranica, the oldest college in Rome. The students studied at the Collegio Romano, founded by Ignatius in 1551. In 1575, Gregory gave the college charge of the services in the adjoining church of Sant'Apollinare alle Terme Neroniane- Alessandrine. The Collegium Germanicus became well known for its music and drew large crowds to the church. In 1580, it merged with the Collegium Hungaricum, founded in 1578, to become the Pontificium Collegium Germanicum et Hungaricum de Urbe. By the late 17th century, the church was in a poor state of repair. Its rebuilding was considered over a long period but wasn't carried out, probably due to the lack of funds. Despite this, in 1702 a chapel was redecorated and dedicated to St Francis Xavier, and a statue of the saint was commissioned from French sculptor Pierre Le Gros. In 1742, Pope Benedict XIV commissioned Ferdinando Fuga to rebuild the church. (The statue of Francis Xavier was preserved and remains in situ).Gerhard Bissell, Pierre Le Gros 1666-1719, Reading (Si Vede) 1997 (in German) On the completion of the church, a new Palace of S. Apollinare was erected. With the suppression of the Jesuits in 1773, direction of the college was taken over by secular clergy. The college was closed in 1798, when the French army occupied the city but was reopened in 1818 and eventually relocated to the Via S. Nicola da Tolentino. =Seminario Romano= In 1824, when Pope Leo XII transferred the Seminario Romano to the Palazzo di Sant'Apollinare, formerly occupied by the Collegio Germanico. The students were intended to serve as diocesan priests in Rome. The Pontificio Seminario Pio was founded in 1853 by Pope Pius IX for the dioceses of the Papal States and was intended for seminarians from all regions of Italy. Pius added two floors to the seminary building in order to locate the Seminario Pio in the Palazzo di S. Apollinare. In 1913 it was merged with the major division of the \\"Roman Seminary\\" to form the Pontificio Seminario Romano Maggior, and relocated to the Lateran. From that date until 1920, the Vincentian Fathers occupied settled in the Palace, their own building having been seized by the government to build the Palazzo Montecitorio for the Italian Chamber of Deputies. =Pontifical Institute of St. Apollinare= Pope Benedict XV made the Palace the seat of the Pontifical Institute of St. Apollinare. Eugenio Pacelli (the future Pius XII) and Angelo Roncalli (future John XXIII) studied there. The Pontifical Institute of Sacred Music was founded by St. Pius X in 1910 under the name \\"School of Sacred Music.\\" On July 10, 1914, the school was declared a Pontifical Institution and was granted the power to confer academic degrees. In October 1914, Pope Benedict XV assigned the Palazzo di Sant'Apollinare as the residence of the school, relocating it from via del Mascherone. In 1983 Pope John Paul II assigned to the Institute the Abbey of San Girolamo in Urbe, where, teaching and daily liturgy are carried out,\\"Pontificium Institutum Musicae Sacrae\\", The Holy See whereas the legal and historical headquarters continued to be in Sant’Apollinare.Pope Benedict XVI. \\"Pope’s Letter to Pontifical Institute of Sacred Music\\", Zenit, May 31, 2011 Since 1990, the Palace has been the seat of the Pontifical University of the Holy Cross.

It is owned and operated by Boyd Gaming. With a one-mile oval track, the facility provides close to 1,000 horse stalls for Thoroughbred flat racing and American Quarter Horse racing. The original track opened on April 28, 1966 at Carencro, Louisiana and remained there until 2005 when it moved to Opelousas, Louisiana. History On April 28, 1966, Evangeline Downs opened for business in its original location along U.S. Highway 167 (also known as the Evangeline Thruway, and today as Interstate Highway 49) at Carencro, Louisiana, just north of the city limits of Lafayette, Louisiana. In 1982, Rodney Verret, Ted Haik, Sam Rankin, and Joe Jones bought the track for $12.4 million. In 1985, they sold it to Norman Denny and Larry Willis for $16.5 million. Denny and Willis soon ran into financial problems. After a missed payment of purse money, the Louisiana Racing Commission threatened to shut down the track. Evangeline Downs was forced to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, and closed indefinitely in October 1986. Unable to negotiate a reorganization, Denny and Willis shifted to Chapter 7 liquidation, asking a court to sell the track. The Louisiana Savings Association, primary mortgage holder for the property, bought it at auction for the minimum bid of $333,335. Races resumed in April 1987. Evangeline Downs added video poker machines in 1992. In a 1996 election, Lafayette Parish voters enacted a parish-wide ban on video poker. As a result, the track made plans to move to St. Landry Parish, whose voters had rejected a similar ban. In February 2002, Peninsula Gaming bought a fifty percent interest in the track from B. I. Moody for $15 million. They bought the remaining half several months later from William Trotter for another $15 million, plus 0.5% of slot revenues for the first ten years. Peninsula carried out the move to Opelousas, opening a casino at the new site in late 2003, with races following in 2005. Peninsula was acquired by Boyd Gaming in November 2012. In 2009, the Horseplayers Association of North America introduced a rating system for 65 thoroughbred racetracks in North America. Of the top ten, Evangeline Downs was ranked #6.

The company was founded in 1888 by George D. Munsing, who invented a method of plating wool fibers with silk and cotton to make the union suit more comfortable. The company received financial backing from Clinton Morrison and Charles Alfred Pillsbury, who were prominent businessmen in the Minneapolis flour milling industry. This style of underwear, patented in 1891, proved to be very popular, and the company eventually became the world's largest manufacturer of underwear. The company changed its name in 1919 to Munsingwear. The company built five brick and concrete buildings between 1904 and 1915, eventually creating a complex covering and employing up to 2000 workers. The five- to eight-story buildings had long rows of windows, and although the buildings mostly had a plain appearance, the architects added some details such as slightly projecting cornices, fretwork friezes, and fluted Doric columns. The oldest of the buildings, along Glenwood Avenue, is notable for being the city's first entirely reinforced concrete building. Engineer C.A.P. Turner used concrete columns shaped like a mushroom on top, and he eventually patented this process, which was widely used. The factory eventually closed in 1981 when the economy reduced demand for Munsingwear's products. In 1985, the buildings were renovated and the complex was renamed International Market Square, which housed offices, shops, and over 100 showrooms for home and office products. The renovation included a five-story atrium created by roofing over an old courtyard where rail tracks once served the complex. In 2005, some portions of the building were renovated into 96 loft apartments. This was a leading example of adaptive reuse in Minneapolis. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.

The castle dates from the 14th century and was destroyed in a war in 1601. Prince Liven’s living house was built in the classic style. The manor complex consists of steward’s house, coach house, Swiss cottage, etc. Home wine tasting is available by prior arrangement. History During the 13th century the left bank of the Gauja river was governed by the Order of the Brethren of the Sword, (later known as the Order of Livonia), while the territories on the right bank were under the domain of the Archbishop of Riga. Krimulda castle belonged to the Riga High Council which was a group of twelve high priests who advised the archbishop. Krimulda castle was built on the edge of a high bank on the right side of Gauja near the Vikmeste castle mound and the village of Livs. This placement made it nearly impossible to conquer. On one side it was protected by the steep valley wall of Gauja river, two additional sides were obstructed by the Vikmeste river, which had equally steep banks, and the fourth side bordered on a man- made ravine with a draw-bridge leading into the forecastle. The deep valley of the Vikmeste River also provided a natural borderline between the lands of Krimulda and Turaida. The castle was built using large-sized boulders. The outer wall of the castle at ground level was about 2 meters/6–7 feet thick. The castle was involved in a number of battles between the Livonian Order and the Archbishop of Riga as well as many of the later wars of Livonia. In the spring of 1601 during the Swedish-Polish war, it was conquered by the Swedish army. In the fall of that same year advancing Polish troops burned the castle down so it would not fall into the hands of the enemy. The castle was left unrepaired after the fire. The castle regained purpose in the mid-19th century under the ownership of Prince Lieven, though not as a military fortification but as a romantic addition to a park. From here you will find a beautiful overlook point, named 'Bellevue', where you can enjoy the numerous picturesque bends of the Gauja River.  Images  Krimulda Castle ruins in 2014.

The novel was mentioned in numerous newspaper review articles looking forward to notable fiction of 2009. The book focuses on a religious sect called the God's Gardeners, a small community of survivors of the same biological catastrophe depicted in Atwood's earlier novel Oryx and Crake. The earlier novel contained several brief references to the group. It answers some of the questions of Oryx and Crake, develops and further elaborates upon several of the characters in the first book, and reveals the identity of the three human figures who appear at the end of the earlier book. The final book of the trilogy is MaddAddam. Plot The Year of the Flood details the events of Oryx and Crake from the perspective of the lower classes in the pleeblands, specifically the God's Gardeners. God's Gardeners are a religious sect that combines some Biblical practices and beliefs with some scientific practices and beliefs. They are vegetarians devoted to honoring and preserving all plant and animal life, and they predict a human species-ending disaster, which they call \\"The Waterless Flood\\". This prediction becomes true in a sense, as Crake's viral pandemic destroys human civilization. The plot follows two characters, Toby and Ren, whose stories intertwine with each other and, at points, with major characters from Oryx and Crake. Much of the story is told through flashbacks with the two main characters separately surviving the apocalypse described in the previous novel, each reminiscing about their time in the God's Gardeners religious movement and the events that led to their current situations. Toby is a young woman who loses her parents under tragic circumstances that may or may not be due to the corporations, and is forced to live off of the grid in a shady meat burger joint. She soon encounters the unwelcome attentions of Blanco, the psychopathic manager of the chain who has a reputation for sexually assaulting and murdering the women in his employ. The leader of God's Gardeners, Adam One, is looked up to as a charismatic holy man but perceived by outsiders as a cult leader. He saves Toby from Blanco and takes her to the sanctuary of his rooftop garden. Toby becomes an influential member of the gardeners and encounters Ren, a child member of the gardeners. Ren eventually grows up to become a sex worker and trapeze dancer in the sex-club Scales and Tails, and happens to be locked in a bio-containment unit in the club when the pandemic occurs. Similarly, Toby is barricaded within a luxury spa where she has begun to work following a raid on the gardeners by Blanco and his brutish pals. Main characters * Ren, a trapeze dancer and sex worker who works at the brothel Scales and Tails, who survives the plague by being isolated in the club's biohazard containment chamber. She previously dated and fell in love with Jimmy (Snowman) in school. * Toby, a God's Gardener who goes into hiding, escaping a dangerous stalker by working in a high-end spa. Oryx, Crake (aka Glenn) and Jimmy appear in minor roles over the course of the book, with the protagonists Ren and Toby unaware that these characters are responsible for the pandemic. While the first book in the series, Oryx and Crake, is told from the perspective of Jimmy/Snowman, The Year of the Flood is told from the point of view of two women, Ren and Toby.

The school was built in 1848 when it was known as the Ward School. The building is located at 106 Trinity Street between King Street East and Eastern Avenue in Toronto, Ontario. Canada. It is the oldest school standing in the city. History The original one-room school was established in 1848 by Enoch Turner (1792-1866), a wealthy brewer and philanthropist, to educate the children in the poor neighbourhood surrounding his brewery. Because many of the area's immigrant families were from County Cork in Ireland, the neighbourhood became known as Corktown – a nickname it still carries today. Turner supplied the funds to construct the schoolhouse and the land was donated by the adjacent Little Trinity Church.Grant to Honorable William Dummer Powell, Honorable James Baby and Reverend John Strachan, Township of York, 1819. In 1849, the school opened with space for 240 pupils and Turner paid for its operation for three years. It was the first free school in Toronto.\\"The Enoch Turner School 1848,\\" in The York Pioneer, York Pioneer and Historical Society, 1971. Enoch Turner founded his free school following the Common Schools Act of 1846. After the act was passed, municipalities had the power to raise funds for public education through taxation. However, city officials were unwilling to introduce such taxes, and as a result, all schools that benefited from any kind of public support were closed for a year. This prompted Turner to establish the school, which was a critical catalyst in the development of a provincially supported free school system. In 1850, school trustees were elected by the public to oversee educational funding. Free public education officially began at the Trinity Street School in 1851. Daily class size ranged from 80 to 90 students of varying academic levels. There were several different instructors employed by the school trustees - most notably Mrs. Jane Henderson, a Scottish immigrant who taught from 1858-59. In 1859, classes were relocated to the nearby Palace Street School at Palace Street (now Front Street East) and Cherry Street. The Trinity Street School and property were returned to Little Trinity parish, and from the 1860s to the 1960s the school served as a parish hall and Sunday school for the church. In addition, the School and hall served as a recruiting station during the Second Boer War and World War I, and a soup kitchen during the Great Depression. Due to a severe fire at Little Trinity Anglican Church in 1961, the parish could no longer afford to care for the school building, and it fell into disrepair. By the late 1960s, the building was slated for demolition. To protect the building and raise funds for its restoration, a group of citizens together with members of the Little Trinity Church congregation set up the Enoch Turner Schoolhouse Foundation on October 8, 1970. The former Trinity Street School was renamed Enoch Turner Schoolhouse. After extensive interior and exterior renovations, the schoolhouse opened as a living history site and conference and reception centre. In March 2008, the ownership and operation of the schoolhouse were transferred to the Ontario Heritage Trust from the Foundation. The Enoch Turner Schoolhouse Foundation continues as an independent charitable organization, working with the Trust to support the programming and operation of the schoolhouse. The museum is open for education programs by appointment and open to walk-in visitors during regular business hours. Several films have been shot at Enoch Turner Schoolhouse, including Down the Road Again (2011). Architectural Style The date stone was installed during construction of the Schoolhouse in 1848, engraved with founder Enoch Turner's name and the year of completion. The design of the one-story Gothic Revival style brick schoolhouse is attributed to an English architect Henry Bowyer Lane, who worked in Canada from about 1841 to 1847 and who also designed the adjacent Little Trinity Church in 1845. The building has an unusual exclamation mark windows that flank the front door. In 1869, the building was expanded to the west with an addition designed by noted Toronto architectural firm Gundry and Langley. The addition is a particularly early work by Henry Langley, who opened his own practice that same year, following the death of Thomas Gundry. Langley went on to become one of the most influential 19th-century architects in Ontario, designing important Toronto landmarks such as the Metropolitan United Church (56 Queen Street East), McMaster Hall (273 Bloor Street West) and the Bank of British North America (49 Yonge Street). In 1910, the south addition was built. Affiliations The Museum is affiliated with: CMA, CHIN, and Virtual Museum of Canada.

Pavlou directed three feature films of which two were based on material from British horror writer Clive Barker. Career He began his career directing and producing short films for the cinema. His first short Bad Company (1980), about a dysfunctional Greek family, won the Special Prize for Young Cinema at Tours film festival. His second short film as director, The Antagonist (1981), was released theatrically through Rank Films as a support film to Educating Rita. The film starred Ed Bishop and Trevor Peacock. He subsequently co produced a third short titled Chickens Never Walk backwards (1982), released by 20th Century Fox theatrically as a support to Conan the Barbarian. Other feature films as associate producer include Nutcracker starring Joan Collins and the cinema short Expresso Splasho, directed by Terry Winsor, which supported the highly successful Eddie Murphy film Trading Places. Subsequent work continued with a 26-part music television show One To One, hosted by Annie Nightingale and transmitted by London Weekend Television and a horror short for Channel Four titled Chillers broadcast in 1991. Produced the children's television series titled Anything's Possible, transmitted by Channel Five television. Pavlou embarked on creating his own film company directing and producing commercials, corporate films and documentaries from 1992 to the present day and recently executive produced a 90-minute bio documentary on Sid Vicious titled \\"Sid: By Those Who Knew Him\\" broadcast on Sky Arts channel 2009. Features Underworld (a.k.a. Transmutations) = In 1985, Pavlou directed Transmutations (also known as Underworld) a science fiction horror thriller about a group of underground mutants called the Underworlders who live in the sewers of London and a deranged doctor who develops a mutation potion. Pavlou met Clive Barker at a dinner party and asked him to write a screenplay (Barker's first) and \\"Underworld\\" emerged. The film opened theatrically in some foreign territories but was predominantly a VHS and television release. Underworld was one of the first horror films to be chosen for the late night screenings of the 1985 London Film Festival. It was also selected for the Paris Cine Fantastique film festival. Empire Pictures, the USA distributor, retitled the film as Transmutations for the USA market. =Rawhead Rex= In 1986, Pavlou directed Rawhead Rex a horror film based on a short story written by Clive Barker. Barker also wrote the screenplay. It was nominated in the international fantasy award Best Film category at the Fantasporto film festival (1987). The film was released theatrically in the USA through Empire Pictures as well as other foreign territories. The film performed better on DVD and television exploitation and is still broadcast by various channels around the world. In October 2017 Kino Lorber released a 4K restored Blu-Ray and DVD in its original wide screen format in the USA and was the best-selling Horror film on Amazon Prime on its release. Rawhead also played theatrically in over thirty USA cities. The film was also released in the UK via Arrow Films. =Little Devils: The Birth= In 1993, Pavlou directed Little Devils: The Birth. The film was released in the US by New World and was predominantly exploited through DVD and television sales.

It is the first of its kind in the Philippines. It serves as an art resource for the university community and the general public as well. The Gallery is located at the Arts Wing, Areté, Ateneo de Manila University, Katipunan Avenue, Loyola Heights, Quezon City. Collection The Ateneo Art Gallery holds over 500 artworks that include paintings, prints, drawings, sculptures, photographs and posters. The collection traces its roots to the late Fernando Zóbel (1920–1984). Painter, art scholar and teacher at the Ateneo, Zóbel donated over 200 artworks to form a study collection for university students. First housed in Bellarmine Hall in 1961, it moved to the ground floor of Rizal Library in 1967, and recently moved to the Arts Wing in Areté on October 1, 2017. Widely recognized today as the first museum of Philippine modern art, The Ateneo Art Gallery was established in 1960 through Fernando Zóbel’s bequest to the Ateneo of his collection of works by key Filipino post war artists. Through the years other philanthropists and artists followed Zobel’s initiative, filling in the gaps so that the collection now surveys every Philippine art movement in the post war era: from neo-realism and abstract expressionism to today’s post-modern hybrid tendencies. The Gallery's fine prints and drawings consist of over 300 works by local and international artists from the Renaissance to the present. The etchings, engravings, woodcuts, lithographs and other graphic-arts media represent over 80 artists, including Rembrandt, Goya, Delacroix, Toulouse-Lautrec, Picasso, and Juvenal Sansó. While the Fernando Zóbel bequest includes works of an earlier generation—notably Fernando Amorsolo and Fabian de la Rosa—it consists of paintings mostly by key postwar modernists, especially those who had exhibited in the now legendary Philippine Art Gallery of the 1950s and 60s. These include Vicente Manansala, Hernando Ocampo, Anita Magsaysay-Ho, Arturo Luz, Cesar Legaspi, Napoleon Abueva, Ang Kiukok, Jerry Elizalde Navarro, and David Medalla. Through the years, other philanthropists and artists followed Zóbel's initiative to donate works of art to the Gallery, filling gaps in the collection with characteristic pieces by Diosdado Lorenzo, Galo B. Ocampo and Nena Saguil, among others. The Gallery is renowned for having the country's most comprehensive collection of works by the social realists of the 1970s and 80s. It also has an active acquisition program to represent key examples of today's postmodern hybrid tendencies in the permanent collection. Contemporary artists represented include Edgar Talusan Fernández, Antipas Delotavo, José Tence Ruiz, Impy Pilapil, Julie Lluch, Anna Fer, Imelda Cajipe-Endaya, Brenda Fajardo, Mark Justiniani, and Alfredo Esquillo.

His family were native speakers of Scottish Gaelic, and Bannerman studied Celtic languages at the University of Glasgow and completed his doctorate at the University of Cambridge where he was taught by Kathleen Hughes. Although he considered teaching Gaelic in schools, Bannerman instead took up a post at the Celtic department of the University of Aberdeen before joining the history department at the University of Edinburgh in 1967. He took over the running of the family farm at Balmaha in 1968, shortly before his father's death, dividing his time between teaching at the University, writing and farming. His work on Gaelic Scotland was influential. His early works on Dál Riata, the Senchus fer n-Alban and the Iona chronicles which formed part of the later Chronicle of Ireland are contained in his 1974 book Studies in the History of Dalriada. He was a major contributor to the record of Late Medieval Monumental Sculpture in the West Highland published in 1977 and his study of the Beaton family—The Beatons: Medical Kindred in the Classical Gaelic Tradition--appeared in 1986.

During his time in research management positions in the NSA, he played a key role in promoting a more open and collaborative relationship between the Agency and the broader community of security professionals. Career In his early career Snow was a mathematics professor at Ohio University, where he helped develop the college's computer science department. In 1971 he started working at the NSA. During the 1970s and 1980s he designed cryptographic components and secure systems. Several cryptographic systems employed by the U.S. government and military have used his algorithms for such purposes as nuclear command and control, tactical voice communications, and network security. As a technical person with high managerial responsibilities, ECC and AES Neal Koblitz and Alfred Menezes have written that Snow was a strong supporter of the transition from RSA to Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) as a public key cryptographic technology: Cybersecurity policy expert Susan Landau attributes the NSA's harmonious collaboration with industry and academia in the selection of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in 2000 — and the Agency's support for the choice of a strong encryption algorithm designed by Europeans rather than by Americans — in part to Snow, who represented the NSA as cochairman of the Technical Working Group for the AES competition. After the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, the NSA believed that it had public support for a dramatic expansion of its surveillance activities. According to Koblitz and Menezes, the period when the NSA was a trusted partner with academia and industry in the development of cryptographic standards came to an end when, as part of the change in the NSA in the post-September 11 era, Snow was replaced as Technical Director and could no longer effectively oppose proposed actions by the offensive arm of the NSA: Code of ethics In Snow's last years at the NSA before his retirement in 2006, along with Clinton Brooks he led a group that drew up a draft ethics code for intelligence officers.

He was a co-founder of the Harlem Congregations for Community Improvement (HCCI), which coordinated 90 congregations to develop 2000 units of housing and retail space.\\"Celebrating the Life of Canon Frederick B. Williams\\", Congressional Record, 10 May 2006, accessed 1 Jan 2008 While earning a doctorate from Colgate Rochester Divinity School, he led a congregation that worked for civil rights and social justice, both in the United States and Africa.  Early life and education  Born 23 April 1939 in Chattanooga, Tennessee, Williams grew up in the South. He earned a bachelor's degree at Morehouse College, a historically black college in Atlanta, Georgia. He earned a second bachelor's degree at General Theological Seminary in New York. Later he earned a doctorate from Colgate Rochester Divinity School.  Career  Williams was one of a generation of activist ministers who were important in New York. He started as a parish priest in Washington, DC and Inkster, Michigan. From 1971–2005, Williams led as Vicar and Rector at the Church of the Intercession, an Episcopal church in Harlem at the border of Washington Heights. His leadership brought the church to deal with new issues of the AIDS crisis, as well as longstanding issues in community development, social justice and international actions in Africa. In 1985 Williams invited 50 black ministers to a conference about AIDS; only 15 came, showing people's reluctance then to deal with the disease. After that he led the church as the first in creating programs of outreach and pastoral care. He supported Pernessa C. Seele in 1989 as she launched the Harlem Week of Prayer with 50 churches, mosques and synagogues to support people with AIDS and their families. Williams became the chair of the National Clergy Advisory Committee of the Harlem Week of Prayer (the Balm in Gilead, Inc.) and served for 10 years. He served for 10 years. The Week of Prayer was developed around reaching out to people with AIDS and their families and friends. Dr. Williams also led efforts for affordable housing and community development. In 1986 together with Dr. Preston Washington of Memorial Baptist Church, Williams co- founded and chaired the Harlem Congregations for Community Improvement, Inc. (HCCI). It grew to be a consortium of 90 congregations that developed nearly 2000 units of housing and 40 commercial spaces, including one of Harlem's first large supermarkets. In addition to putting together financing and development packages, the consortium established training for people in construction crafts and design. Williams encouraged local arts groups, helping the Boys Choir of Harlem by allowing them to use the Church of the Intercession as their first performance space and base of operations. Williams led a variety of efforts for social justice; he was active in supporting African liberation and anti-apartheid efforts. In 1988 with Rev. Dr. Wyatt Tee Walker of Canaan Baptist Church in Harlem, Williams co-founded the Religious Action Network (RAN) of the American Committee on Africa (ACOA) (since 2001 called Africa Action.) \\"Religious Action Network\\" , Africa Action Website, accessed 9 Jan 2009 This was during the height of the anti-apartheid struggle in South Africa. Through his work, Williams became a friend of Bishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa, who sometimes officiated at the Church of the Intercession on his visits to the United States. RAN is a network of over 300 congregations throughout the U.S. that continues to provide prophetic witness to issues in Africa and to influence US policies toward nations there.

In probability theory and statistics, there are several relationships among probability distributions. These relations can be categorized in the following groups: *One distribution is a special case of another with a broader parameter space *Transforms (function of a random variable); *Combinations (function of several variables); *Approximation (limit) relationships; *Compound relationships (useful for Bayesian inference); *Duality; *Conjugate priors. Special case of distribution parametrization * A binomial (n, p) random variable with n = 1, is a Bernoulli (p) random variable. * A negative binomial distribution with n = 1 is a geometric distribution. * A gamma distribution with shape parameter α = 1 and scale parameter θ is an exponential distribution with expected value θ. * A gamma (α, β) random variable with α = ν/2 and β = 2, is a chi-squared random variable with ν degrees of freedom. * A chi-squared distribution with 2 degrees of freedom is an exponential distribution with mean 2 and vice versa. * A Weibull (1, β) random variable is an exponential random variable with mean β. * A beta random variable with parameters α = β = 1 is a uniform random variable. * A beta-binomial (n, 1, 1) random variable is a discrete uniform random variable over the values 0, ..., n. * A random variable with a t distribution with one degree of freedom is a Cauchy(0,1) random variable. * When c = 1, the Burr type XII distribution becomes the Pareto Type II (Lomax) distribution.  Transform of a variable  Multiple of a random variable = Multiplying the variable by any positive real constant yields a scaling of the original distribution. Some are self-replicating, meaning that the scaling yields the same family of distributions, albeit with a different parameter: normal distribution, gamma distribution, Cauchy distribution, exponential distribution, Erlang distribution, Weibull distribution, logistic distribution, error distribution, power-law distribution, Rayleigh distribution. Example: * If X is a gamma random variable with shape and rate parameters (r, λ), then Y = aX is a gamma random variable with parameters (r,λ/a). * If X is a gamma random variable with shape and scale parameters (α, β), then Y = aX is a gamma random variable with parameters (α,aβ). = Linear function of a random variable = The affine transform ax + b yields a relocation and scaling of the original distribution. The following are self- replicating: Normal distribution, Cauchy distribution, Logistic distribution, Error distribution, Power distribution, Rayleigh distribution. Example: * If Z is a normal random variable with parameters (μ = m, σ2 = s2), then X = aZ + b is a normal random variable with parameters (μ = am + b, σ2 = a2s2). = Reciprocal of a random variable = The reciprocal 1/X of a random variable X, is a member of the same family of distribution as X, in the following cases: Cauchy distribution, F distribution, log logistic distribution. Examples: * If X is a Cauchy (μ, σ) random variable, then 1/X is a Cauchy (μ/C, σ/C) random variable where C = μ2 \\\\+ σ2. * If X is an F(ν1, ν2) random variable then 1/X is an F(ν2, ν1) random variable. = Other cases = Some distributions are invariant under a specific transformation. Example: * If X is a beta (α, β) random variable then (1 − X) is a beta (β, α) random variable. * If X is a binomial (n, p) random variable then (n − X) is a binomial (n, 1 − p) random variable. * If X has cumulative distribution function FX, then the inverse of the cumulative distribution F(X) is a standard uniform (0,1) random variable * If X is a normal (μ, σ2) random variable then eX is a lognormal (μ, σ2) random variable. :Conversely, if X is a lognormal (μ, σ2) random variable then log X is a normal (μ, σ2) random variable. * If X is an exponential random variable with mean β, then X1/γ is a Weibull (γ, β) random variable. * The square of a standard normal random variable has a chi-squared distribution with one degree of freedom. * If X is a Student’s t random variable with ν degree of freedom, then X2 is an F (1,ν) random variable. * If X is a double exponential random variable with mean 0 and scale λ, then X is an exponential random variable with mean λ. * A geometric random variable is the floor of an exponential random variable. * A rectangular random variable is the floor of a uniform random variable. * A reciprocal random variable is the exponential of a uniform random variable.  Functions of several variables  Sum of variables = The distribution of the sum of independent random variables is the convolution of their distributions. Suppose Z is the sum of n independent random variables X_1, \\\\dots, X_n each with probability mass functions f_{X_i}(x). Then Z = \\\\sum_{i = 1}^{n} {X_i} has If it has a distribution from the same family of distributions as the original variables, that family of distributions is said to be closed under convolution. Examples of such univariate distributions are: normal distributions, Poisson distributions, binomial distributions (with common success probability), negative binomial distributions (with common success probability), gamma distributions (with common rate parameter), chi-squared distributions, Cauchy distributions, hyperexponential distributions. Examples: **If X1 and X2 are Poisson random variables with means μ1 and μ2 respectively, then X1 \\\\+ X2 is a Poisson random variable with mean μ1 \\\\+ μ2. ** The sum of gamma (ni, β) random variables has a gamma (Σni, β) distribution. **If X1 is a Cauchy (μ1, σ1) random variable and X2 is a Cauchy (μ2, σ2), then X1 \\\\+ X2 is a Cauchy (μ1 \\\\+ μ2, σ1 \\\\+ σ2) random variable. **If X1 and X2 are chi-squared random variables with ν1 and ν2 degrees of freedom respectively, then X1 \\\\+ X2 is a chi-squared random variable with ν1 \\\\+ ν2 degrees of freedom. **If X1 is a normal (μ1, σ) random variable and X2 is a normal (μ2, σ) random variable, then X1 \\\\+ X2 is a normal (μ1 \\\\+ μ2, σ + σ) random variable. **The sum of N chi-squared (1) random variables has a chi-squared distribution with N degrees of freedom. Other distributions are not closed under convolution, but their sum has a known distribution: * The sum of n Bernoulli (p) random variables is a binomial (n, p) random variable. * The sum of n geometric random variables with probability of success p is a negative binomial random variable with parameters n and p. * The sum of n exponential (β) random variables is a gamma (n, β) random variable. **If the exponential random variables have a common rate parameter, their sum has an Erlang distribution, a special case of the gamma distribution. *The sum of the squares of N standard normal random variables has a chi-squared distribution with N degrees of freedom. = Product of variables = The product of independent random variables X and Y may belong to the same family of distribution as X and Y: Bernoulli distribution and log- normal distribution. Example: * If X1 and X2 are independent log-normal random variables with parameters (μ1, σ) and (μ2, σ) respectively, then X1 X2 is a log-normal random variable with parameters (μ1 \\\\+ μ2, σ + σ). = Minimum and maximum of independent random variables = For some distributions, the minimum value of several independent random variables is a member of the same family, with different parameters: Bernoulli distribution, Geometric distribution, Exponential distribution, Extreme value distribution, Pareto distribution, Rayleigh distribution, Weibull distribution. Examples: * If X1 and X2 are independent geometric random variables with probability of success p1 and p2 respectively, then min(X1, X2) is a geometric random variable with probability of success p = p1 \\\\+ p2 − p1 p2. The relationship is simpler if expressed in terms probability of failure: q = q1 q2. * If X1 and X2 are independent exponential random variables with rate μ1 and μ2 respectively, then min(X1, X2) is an exponential random variable with rate μ = μ1 \\\\+ μ2. Similarly, distributions for which the maximum value of several independent random variables is a member of the same family of distribution include: Bernoulli distribution, Power law distribution. = Other = * If X and Y are independent standard normal random variables, X/Y is a Cauchy (0,1) random variable. * If X1 and X2 are independent chi-squared random variables with ν1 and ν2 degrees of freedom respectively, then (X1/ν1)/(X2/ν2) is an F(ν1, ν2) random variable. * If X is a standard normal random variable and U is an independent chi-squared random variable with ν degrees of freedom, then \\\\frac{X}{\\\\sqrt{(U/ u)}} is a Student's t(ν) random variable. * If X1 is a gamma (α1, 1) random variable and X2 is an independent gamma (α2, 1) random variable then X1/(X1 \\\\+ X2) is a beta(α1, α2) random variable. More generally, if X1 is a gamma(α1, β1) random variable and X2 is an independent gamma(α2, β2) random variable then β2 X1/(β2 X1 \\\\+ β1 X2) is a beta(α1, α2) random variable. * If X and Y are independent exponential random variables with mean μ, then X − Y is a double exponential random variable with mean 0 and scale μ.  Approximate (limit) relationships  Approximate or limit relationship means *either that the combination of an infinite number of iid random variables tends to some distribution, *or that the limit when a parameter tends to some value approaches to a different distribution. Combination of iid random variables: * Given certain conditions, the sum (hence the average) of a sufficiently large number of iid random variables, each with finite mean and variance, will be approximately normally distributed. This is the central limit theorem (CLT). Special case of distribution parametrization: * X is a hypergeometric (m, N, n) random variable. If n and m are large compared to N, and p = m/N is not close to 0 or 1, then X approximately has a Binomial(n, p) distribution. * X is a beta-binomial random variable with parameters (n, α, β). Let p = α/(α + β) and suppose α + β is large, then X approximately has a binomial(n, p) distribution. * If X is a binomial (n, p) random variable and if n is large and np is small then X approximately has a Poisson(np) distribution. * If X is a negative binomial random variable with r large, P near 1, and r(1 − P) = λ, then X approximately has a Poisson distribution with mean λ. Consequences of the CLT: * If X is a Poisson random variable with large mean, then for integers j and k, P(j ≤ X ≤ k) approximately equals to P(j − 1/2 ≤ Y ≤ k + 1/2) where Y is a normal distribution with the same mean and variance as X. * If X is a binomial(n, p) random variable with large np and n(1 − p), then for integers j and k, P(j ≤ X ≤ k) approximately equals to P(j − 1/2 ≤ Y ≤ k + 1/2) where Y is a normal random variable with the same mean and variance as X, i.e. np and np(1 − p). * If X is a beta random variable with parameters α and β equal and large, then X approximately has a normal distribution with the same mean and variance, i. e. mean α/(α + β) and variance αβ/((α + β)2(α + β + 1)). * If X is a gamma(α, β) random variable and the shape parameter α is large relative to the scale parameter β, then X approximately has a normal random variable with the same mean and variance. * If X is a Student's t random variable with a large number of degrees of freedom ν then X approximately has a standard normal distribution. * If X is an F(ν, ω) random variable with ω large, then νX is approximately distributed as a chi-squared random variable with ν degrees of freedom.  Compound (or Bayesian) relationships  When one or more parameter(s) of a distribution are random variables, the compound distribution is the marginal distribution of the variable. Examples: * If X  N is a binomial (N,p) random variable, where parameter N is a random variable with negative-binomial (m, r) distribution, then X is distributed as a negative-binomial (m, r/(p + qr)). * If X  N is a binomial (N,p) random variable, where parameter N is a random variable with Poisson(μ) distribution, then X is distributed as a Poisson (μp). * If X  μ is a Poisson(μ) random variable and parameter μ is random variable with gamma(m, θ) distribution (where θ is the scale parameter), then X is distributed as a negative-binomial (m, θ/(1 + θ)), sometimes called gamma- Poisson distribution. Some distributions have been specially named as compounds: beta-binomial distribution, beta-Pascal distribution, gamma-normal distribution. Examples: * If X is a Binomial(n,p) random variable, and parameter p is a random variable with beta(α, β) distribution, then X is distributed as a Beta-Binomial(α,β,n). * If X is a negative-binomial(m,p) random variable, and parameter p is a random variable with beta(α,β) distribution, then X is distributed as a Beta-Pascal(α,β,m).

He won an Academy Award in 1986 in the category Best Art Direction for the film A Room with a View. Early years Born and raised in Abergavenny with his younger sister Pat, he was encouraged to be musical by his parents, Gwen and Archie, who both loved jazz. Despite Archie being an amateur drummer, Brian took up the trumpet and learned to play at an early age. While studying Fine Art at the Cardiff College of Art, he was good enough to play trumpet semi-professionally, performing with local jazz bands in and around Cardiff and Bristol, including a brief membership of the fledgling Acker Bilk Bristol Paramount Jazz Band. His skills as a graphic artist were developed when he worked as an Art Editor and Designer before joining the film industry in 1962, when it became apparent that he had to decide whether to earn a living in an artistic occupation or as a musician playing jazz. He moved to Cookham, near Maidenhead, in the early '60s while working in various UK film production and design roles at Shepperton and Pinewood Studios. During this time he was a member of Thames Valley Rugby Club playing for the first XV. He also developed a keen interest in vintage cars and at one time owned an Invicta among other vehicles. In the early seventies he decamped to Ferney Voltaire on the French-Swiss border, after his wife Sarah had been offered a job with a UN agency in Geneva. After some anticipated corporate film projects failed to materialize, he spent most of his time renovating an old property in the Pays de Gex commune and propping up various bars in Ferney. Film success After his marriage failed in the late 1970s, he reactivated his network of film contacts and this led to a job offer on a film that was being made in London. From there he moved back into the mainstream film and TV industry where he enjoyed considerable success over the next 20 years. He split his time principally between the UK and New Orleans where he worked on both TV and film projects. The pinnacle of his success was achieved in 1986 when he jointly won the Oscar with Elio Altramura for Set Design & Art Direction on the Merchant Ivory production of A Room with a View. The Oscar was presented to him by Isabella Rossellini and Christopher Reeve at the 59th Academy Awards ceremony on 30 March 1987 and he publicly thanked James Ivory from the podium.http://aaspeechesdb.oscars.org/link/059-5/ The competing nominations in that year were Aliens, The Mission, The Color of Money and Hannah and her Sisters. He also won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Art Direction for a Series on Dinosaurs for the episode \\"The Mating Dance\\".https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0767527/awards He was also a member of the Art Directors Branch of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Final years Following his new-found success in films and TV, he bought himself a home in the southern French village of Roumoules in Provence. He was diagnosed with diabetes in 1989 and this led him to gradually reduce his workload during the late 1990s and to spend more time at his home in France. He took up his trumpet playing again and would perform with local and visiting jazz musicians. He succumbed to the condition on 31 March 2007, aged 74.

The 15 locomotives were delivered in 1956 by MaK (Kiel) to the DB.  Description Class V 65/Class 265 engines were delivered to the DB shortly after the arrival in service of the first V 60s. Amongst their special features were the MaK motor with only 750 rpm and the Beugniot lever between the individual axles, that improved curve running. For train heating the engine had a boiler that was heated by the engine's exhaust gases. The engine itself had to be pre-heated with a Dofa coke oven. For this purpose up to 100 kg of coke could be carried. Although, with only 15 units, the Class V 65 was built in relatively small numbers, it was really only a slight modification of the 600 D built by MaK for private railways. These belonged to the so-called MaK rod- coupled locomotives (MaK-Stangenlokomotiven), that were operated in large numbers by private railways. Their power ranged between .  Operations The locomotives were initially deployed in the area of Marburg/Lahn ahead of light passenger trains, but in 1964 they were replaced by the more powerful V 100. After that, five examples were used for shunting duties at Puttgarden ferryboat station until 1980, being stationed at the depot (Bahnbetriebswerk) at Puttgarden. The remainder were employed at Hamburg-Altona where their duties included working on the Hamburg Harbour railway.

After the Danish Reformation the priory was transformed into a manor estate known as Gavnø Castle located near Næstved, Denmark.  Priory As a fortress= Gavnø and several other islands are in a protected fjord just south of the town of Næstved in southern Zealand. These islands' strategic location made them useful from Viking times as a place from which to launch naval raids. It was owned by various pirate () chiefs with 'forts' at 'Bastnæs', Carlsgab, and Bornakke. Later pirates used Gavnø as a base from which to attack Hanseatic vessels and raid coastal towns, so that the region long had a reputation for piracy. It fell to the royal family during the reign of Valdemar I, who had a hunting residence there which was part residence when he stayed there, part working farm to provide for the workers and their families and royal guests, and later part fortress. Valedmar had fortified the residence and used it to send ships out to raid his enemies in northern Germany and the Baltic. Valdemar fortress was expanded during the years of the German occupation and used as a base from which to attack Danish shipping by German pirates. The island was mortgaged by King Erik VI Menved in 1292 and eventually fell into the possession of the noble Falk family from Scania. =As a convent= By the early 15th century the royal fortress at Gavnø had lost its strategic importance. In 1398 Margaret I, queen of a united Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, purchased the island from Lady Ida Falk. The fortress was torn down and the materials used to build a new convent for Dominican nuns. It was only the second house for Dominican nuns in Denmark after St. Agnes Priory in Roskilde. In time St Agnes Priory became a residence for unmarried women of position who lived with the nuns. Since the Dominicans were a mendicant order, they existed on the charity of the local community. One way of guaranteeing income was to accept rent properties, mostly farms from the families of unmarried noble women. In return for the income, properties unmarried women lived a quasi-religious life in the security of St. Agnes Priory until they married or took vows. The priory consisted of a three- range brick enclosure connected to the priory church. One range served as a refectory with cellars underneath, the second as a dormitory, and the third range was for the use of the lay sisters and workers. The priory had a small staff of secular collectors who solicited funds, food, and clothing for the priory's use. =Under the Lutheran crown= In 1536 Denmark became a Lutheran kingdom under King Christian III and all religious houses and their income properties fell to the crown. Despite the antagonism to the Dominicans' constant requests for money, food, and clothing for their charitable works and for upkeep of the priory, the secularized nuns were permitted to remain at the priory until at least 1556. The prioress continued to maintain order inside the priory while a secular superintendent, Mogens Gøye (ca. 1470–1544), administered priory dealings with the outside world. He was a staunch Lutheran and personally responsible for driving Franciscan friars from several friaries, but protected the women at St. Agnes Priory in his charge with honor and respect. In 1583 the priory complex was sold to Hans Lindenov (1616-59) by King Frederick II. The priory was converted into a manor house and estate buildings. A tower added at the same time. The estate was acquired by Niels Trolle (1599– 1667) in 1663. In the late 1660s, the church became a private chapel. It was embellished by Lady Helle Rosenkrantz (1618-1685), widow of Niels Trolle into one of Denmark's most colorful churches and is the only visible remnant of the priory. The fine altarpiece, pulpit, and other furniture from the late 17th century has been largely preserved. There is a 1536 gravestone carved for Lady Margrethe Beck. The wooden crucifix above the altar was in use in the early 16th century and probably dates to the late 15th century. Several remarkable wooden epitaphs have been preserved as well.  Gavnø Castle  In 1737 Count Otto Thott (1703–1785) bought the estate and set about creating what is called today Gavnø Castle. An additional story was added to the surviving ranges, and the Rococo style exterior was added. The south range of the complex is the old dormitory of the priory. Thott was a collector of books, so spaces were created for the 200,000 books in his library, one of the largest private collections in Europe. The walls were hung with the hundreds of paintings he amassed. At his death all the books published before 1530 were donated to the Royal Library in Copenhagen. Thott, Otto Greve Dansk Biografisk Leksikon vol XVII, p. 341. Retrieved October 1 , 2019. The construction of the castle and French formal garden park was complete in 1750. In 1850 the gardens were reconstructed as an English style park with a more open and natural appearance. In 1960 the entire estate was turned over to a foundation in order to conserve the castle, priory church, and gardens. It has become world famous for its spring tulip display. The property is open to the public, though it is still the residence of the current Baron Reedtz-Thott and family.

Anderson (1946 – March 23, 2018) was a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). He was an architectural historian, museum curator and hymnwriter. Anderson was born in Pasadena, California, and as a young man served a mission for the LDS Church in Japan. Anderson received a B.A. with honors from Stanford University in 1968 and a Master of Architecture from Princeton University in 1972. He was an architect in Pasadena, California, and received his license in 1976. Anderson married the historian Lavina Fielding in 1977. They lived in Salt Lake City, Utah, and had one son, Christian, who was born in 1980. During the 1993 conflict between some intellectuals and LDS Church leadership (in which Lavina was excommunicated), Paul publicly called for peace and reconciliation between the parties. In 1973, Anderson received a fellowship from the LDS Church's Historical Department to study historical Mormon architecture, which led to a position restoring the church's historic buildings. He helped in the planning of the Museum of Church History and Art, which opened in 1984, and later in designing its exhibits. He helped launch the Brigham Young University Museum of Art in 1992 and since then has served as head of design and curator. Anderson was heavily involved with the work of Nauvoo Restoration, Inc. Anderson had been a longtime member of the Mormon History Association (MHA), and planned its 1987 conference in England, for which he was awarded a Special Citation from the MHA. He served as MHA president from 2007 to 2008. Anderson also had a strong musical interest. For several years he sang in the Utah Symphony Chorus. He has written the text of four hymns in the 1985 LDS hymnbook: numbers 139, \\"In Fasting We Approach Thee\\"; 148, \\"Sabbath Day\\"; 291, \\"Turn Your Hearts\\"; and 311, \\"We Meet Again as Sisters\\".

They are currently classified as a subgroup of the Serer. Population The territory of the Niominka is called the Gandoul. Most of the Niominka live in its eleven large villages, which include Niodior, Dionewar, and Falia. They represent a little less than 1% of the population of Senegal. Being island-dwellers, they participate in both agriculture and aquaculture. The primary agricultural produce is made up of rice, millet, and peanuts. As for the aquaculture, the men fish and the women gather shellfish, although environmental problems have become an aquacultural threat. The Niominka are also beginning to look into tourism.  History  The origins of the Niominka are obscure and uncertain. Although currently classified together with the Serer people, their name is drawn from Mandinka, meaning \\"coastal people\\" (Niumi = coast, and Nka = men), and were known to have been ruled by a mansa (Mandinka for \\"king\\"), suggesting they might have originally been either a Mandinka people that were later \\"Sererized\\" by migrants from the north, or conversely, a Serer people that were for some time \\"Mandinkized\\" by their neighbors from the south.Teixeira da Mota, p.59, 64-65; Cormier-Salem, 1999: p.176 They were overlooked in the process of the \\"organization\\" of the Sine and Saloum kingdoms via the Mandinka Guelowar dynasty in the 14th century. Theories suggest they were originally neither Serer nor Mandinka, but an altogether different people, probably related to the Jola people and speakers of Bak language that inhabited the banks of the Gambia river, until they were pushed from below by the migration of Mandinka from the south and east in the 13th century, only to hit the barrier of migrating Serer people from the north, and as a result ended up squeezed into a corner of the delta, south of the Saloum River.Klein, p.7-8; Cormier-Salem, 1999: p.176; Brooks, 1993 A supplementary theory suggests they were not a distinctive people, but rather just a disparate collection of indeterminate aboriginal riverine inhabitants and migrants, refugees and fugitives from neighboring Mandinka and Serer states that flocked to that relatively inaccessible and ungoverned delta corner, and eked out a largely independent existence.Cormier-Salem, 1999: p.176 The Niominka were largely unorganized, with an egalitarian social structure quite unlike their neighbors. The nominal overlordship of the Niominka seems to have flipped back and forth between the Mandinka mansa of Barra to the south and the Serer king of Saloum to the north. The Niominka adopted some cultural and economic elements from both, e.g. cultivation of millet from Serer, rice from Mandinka, but also possess elements quite distinctive in their own right, most notably riverine fishing. The Niominka are believed to have been the only traditionally aquacultural people on the stretch of the west African coast south of Cape Vert and north of the Bissagos. Old texts sometimes identify the Niominka as the \\"Niumi Bato\\", as distinct from their southerly neighbors, the \\"Niumi Banta\\" (ancestral to the Mandinka of Barra).Teixeira da Mota, 1946: p.60; Wright, 1976 Through much of their history, the Niumi Bato (Niominka), the Niumi Banta and the nearby Jokadu were all under the rule of the same Mandinka lord known as the \\"Niumimansa\\".Wright, 1976 However, there were repeated attempts by the Serer king of Saloum to exert his authority over the Niominka. The Niominka (Niumi Bato) controlled the stretch of coast roughly from the south bank of the Saloum River to a little above Barra point, including the entries of the Diombos, Banjala and Jinnak rivers and the associated delta islands; the Niumi of Barra (Niumi Banta) lived below them, on the northern shores of the Gambia River. Niominka pirogues may have plied the coast and rivers further south (including the Gambia, maybe as far as the Casamance River. According to historians, the Niominka were probably responsible killing the Portuguese explorer and slave-trader Nuno Tristão in 1446.Teixeira da Mota (1946), pt.1. Tristão had ventured up the Diombos river on a longboat with his crew intending to find a native settlement to raid, when the Portuguese were trapped by Niominka canoes and massacred. The memoirs of Diogo Gomes suggest the Niominka canoes proceeded to venture out to sea, overwhelmed the remaining Portuguese in the waiting caravel, and proceeded to drag the ship upriver to dismantle it, its anchor later being found in the possession of the Niumimansa. The very next year, the Niumimansa ordered an attack on another Portuguese exploration-slaving party, led by Estêvão Afonso, although this was probably carried out further south, nearer the Gambia shore by the Niumi Banta (of Barra) (the Portuguese clambered back aboard and fled).Teixeira da Mota, Pt.2, p.284ff. There were two more attacks on Portuguese explorers in the area within the next year - one on Álvaro Fernandes, a massed canoe attack similar to the attack on Tristão (although Fernandes escaped); another an attack on a landing party led by Danish captain Valarte (who was killed). The series of attacks on Portuguese explorers by the Niominka (and their neighbors) in the Saloum-Gambia area prompted the Portuguese Prince Henry the Navigator to suspend all Portuguese expeditions south of Cape Vert in 1448. The Saloum delta in particular, with its rivulets and entries plied by the canoe-borne Niominka, was deemed too dangerous for Portuguese ships to pass. When a new expedition, led by Alvise Cadamosto, finally dared venture to that area again in 1455, one of his landing parties was killed by the mouth of the Saloum (possibly Niominka again), and Cadamosto's own ship attacked and fended off at the mouth of the Gambia by the Niumi Banta. Cadamosto reports the fierceness of the Niumi people rested on their belief that the Portuguese were cannibals, who came to capture black men to eat. But the very next year (1456), when Cadamosto returned, there was a very different reception, and Cadamosto ventured peacefully up the Gambia, and even amicably met the Niumimansa himself. What caused this change of heart is uncertain. In his own (unreliable) memoirs, Portuguese captain Diogo Gomes reports he was personally responsible for negotiating a peace treaty c. 1456 (perhaps a little later) with the Niumimansa, and even of baptising him as a Christian. In the early 1860s, when the peoples of the Gambia area were raised in revolt against the Mandinka aristocracy by the Toucouleur marabout Maba Diakhou Bâ, the Niumi were not immune. The Niumimansa died in 1861, and an offshoot marabout rising ensued in the coastal area. When Maba Bâ launched an attack on the kingdom of Saloum, both the Mandinka-speaking Niumi of Barra and the Serer-speaking Niominka swore allegiance to the marabouts and joined in the attack on the Serers of Saloum.Klein, 1968:p.73 Filmography *Le Mbissa, a documentary film by Alexis Fifis and Cécile Walter, produced by the IRD  References Bibliography * G.E.

It is a flagellate adapted to micro-aerobic environments that causes systemic infections in salmonid fish. The species creates foul-smelling, pus-filled abscesses in muscles and internal organs of aquarium fish. In the late 1980s when the disease was first reported, it was believed to be caused by Spironucleus barkhanus. Anders Jørgensen was the person that found out what species really caused the disease. There is a distinct lack of models for diverse microbial eukaryotes. Spironucleus salmonicida was chosen as a model due to its complex genome and ability to adapt to fluctuating environments. This ability was proven by genetically modifying the pathogen and seeing the results. By comparing these results with the closest model organism, Giardia intestinalis, researchers were able to see that the parasite has a more complex gene regulation system. This system of genetic modification was also used to sequence the genome for further study. Spironucleus salmonicida contains mitochondrion-related organelles (MROs). MROS identified in S. salmonicida contained similar protein import and Fe-S machinery as in Giardia mitosomes and the MROS contained the enzyme characteristics similar to hydrogenosomes. Thereby affirming hydrogen production is prevalent in the genus Spironucleus. Hydrogenosomes produce ATP by substrate-level phosphorylation with hydrogen as a byproduct.

The cutting still exists although it is heavily overgrown. Remnants of the platform can be found beneath the undergrowth but the buildings are no longer in existence. A bunker was built on this site for RAF Watnall during the Second World War and used as an operations centre for No. 12 Group RAF. The headquarters moved to RAF Newton in 1946 but the bunker remained in use for the duration of the ROTOR program and was mothballed in 1961. The bunker was used as a rifle range by the Awsworth - Kimberley and District Rifle Club. In May 2010, local police discovered a large cannabis factory inside the bunker.

He was beheaded after the Battle of Tewkesbury. Origins Gervase Clifton (II) was the son of Sir Gervase Clifton (I) (died 15 November 1453) of Hodsock and Clifton, Nottinghamshire, only son of Sir John Clifton (slain at the Battle of Shrewsbury on 21 July 1403), and his wife, Katherine Cressy. The younger Sir Gervase Clifton's mother was Isabel Fraunceys (d. 13 June 1457), the daughter of Sir Robert Fraunceys of Foremark, Derbyshire. His only sibling was a brother, Robert Clifton. He was a junior member of the Clifton family of Nottinghamshire, descended from the 11th century Alvaredus de Clifton, warden of Nottingham Castle \\"in the time of William Peverell, bastard son of William the Conqueror\\".Betham, William, The Baronetage of England: or The History of the English Baronets, Volume 1, Ipswich, 1801, p.49 et seq. Career Clifton served as Lieutenant of Dover Castle and as Captain of Pontoise, France where he was knighted. He came into an estate at Brabourne, Kent, by his marriage to an heiress, Isabel Herbert. He was Mayor of Canterbury in 1450, served as High Sheriff of Kent for 1439, 1450 and 1458 and represented Kent in the Parliament of 1455. Clifton was not captain of Pontoise; he was not knighted there. There is no contemporary source that Clifton was ever at Pontoise; Hall is a Tudor historian. He was still an esquire when he became Treasurer of Calais in May 1451, not 1450.Calendar Patent Rolls, 1446–52, p. 460. He was briefly Treasurer of the Household of Henry VI and Treasurer of Calais in 1450–1460. He was declared a traitor for his support of Margaret of Anjou. He took part in and was captured at the Battle of Tewkesbury during the Wars of the Roses and was beheaded in Tewkesbury market place along with other Lancastrian leaders on 6 May 1471. Marriages and children Clifton married twice, leaving no sons, only two daughters and co-heiresses by his first wife. =First wife= Firstly he married Isabel Herbert (died c. November 1457), widow of William Scott (died 5 February 1434) of Brabourne, Kent, and daughter of Vincent Herbert (alias Finche) of Netherfield, Sussex by his wife Isabel Cralle, daughter and coheiress of Robert Cralle. Their two daughters were: *Isabel Clifton, who in 1459 married John Jerningham (died 1503) of Somerleyton, Suffolk, by whom she had two sons and several daughters, including: **Sir Edward Jerningham (died 1515), who married firstly Margaret Bedingfield (d. 24 March 1504), and secondly Mary Scrope (d. 25 August 1548). **Sir Richard Jerningham (died 1525/6), Gentleman of the Privy Chamber to King Henry VIII, who married Anne Sapcote (d. 14 March 1559), who survived him and remarried to John Russell, 1st Earl of Bedford, by whom she was the mother of Francis Russell, 2nd Earl of Bedford. **Margaret (or Mary) Jerningham, who married Thomas Stanhope of Rampton and was the grandmother of Anne Seymour, Duchess of Somerset (née Anne Stanhope). *Joan Clifton, who married John Digges of Digges Court in Barham, Kent and was the grandmother of the scientist, Leonard Digges. =Second wife= Clifton's second marriage, before 20 March 1463, was to Maud Stanhope (died 30 August 1497), widow firstly of Robert Willoughby, 6th Baron Willoughby de Eresby (died 1452), and secondly of Sir Thomas Neville (killed at Battle of Wakefield 30 December 1460), second son of Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury, executed at Pontefract on 31 December 1460 after the Battle of Wakefield. Maud Stanhope was the daughter of Sir Richard Stanhope (died 1436) of Rampton, Nottinghamshire by his second wife, Maud Cromwell (died 30 August 1497), daughter of Ralph Cromwell, 2nd Baron Cromwell (died c. 2 May 1417). Maud Stanhope was the niece and coheiress of Ralph de Cromwell, 3rd Baron Cromwell (d. 4 January 1456), and the heiress of her sister, Joan Stanhope (died 10 March 1490), who had married firstly Sir Humphrey Bourchier (died 1471), slain at the Battle of Barnet on 14 April 1471, and secondly Sir Robert Radcliffe of Hunstanton, Norfolk. There were no children from Clifton's second marriage, and after his death his widow, Maud Stanhope, alleged that he had 'wasted and destroyed' more than £1000 worth of jewels, plate and household goods which she brought to the marriage as her dowry. She died 30 August 1497, and was buried in the Collegiate Church at Tattershall, Lincolnshire.; NotesReferences    * The Baronetage of England, Containing a Genealogical and Historical Account of all the Baronets now existing, Edward Kimber and Richard Johnson Vol. I (1771) p. 26\\\\.

Hall, the third in the 'Dad and Dave' comedy series starring Bert Bailey. It was the feature film debut of Peter Finch and is one of the best known Australian films of the 1930s. Synopsis Life is busy on the Rudd farm: Dave keeps inventing things, Joe has a tooth ache, Billy Ryan wants to marry Sarah Rudd but Dad is feuding with Billy's father, Old Man Ryan, who wants to buy Dad's bottom paddock. Dad receives news that his brother, Alfred, whom he has not seen for 20 years, has died and left Dad a house in the city, Bellavista, along with a shop that sells women's clothes called Cecille's. Dad moves to the city with Dave, Mum and daughter Jill. He discovers that the store is struggling, and is unaware that the store's manager, Rawlins, is secretly in league with a rival shop owner, Pierre, who wants to take over Cecille's. Dad puts Jill in charge and she starts rejuvenating the store, impressing the effeminate floorwalker, Entwistle. She discovers Rawlins' treachery and forces him to resign, replacing him with Entwistle as manager. She hires a young press agent, Jim Bradley, who used to work for Pierre, to promote the store. Jill and Jim begin a romance. Dave falls for a store model called Myrtle and Mum is hounded out of the kitchen at Bellavista by the housekeeper, Miss Quince. Jill and Jim want to renovate Cecille's and put on a giant fashion show. Dad agrees and borrows money against his farm to finance it. The show looks as though it is going to be a big success when Pierre reveals he lent Dad's brother £1,000 and calls in the debt the night before. Dad is inspired to keep going by some inspiring words from Mum, who fires Miss Quince. Pierre orders bailiffs to repossess Cecille's during the show, but Dave, Myrtle and Entwistle manage to stop them by getting Myrtle to lure them into a room and Dave knocking them out. Pierre then arrives with the police, but Dad is bailed out by Old Man Ryan, who pays the £1,000. The show is a big success, and Dad returns to the country, leaving Jill in charge of Cecille's, with a new appreciation for people who live in the city.

There had recently been a ruling that Australian films were no longer eligible as British under the local quotas in England, which hurt their ability to sell overseas. Hall needed to make a film which was appealed to local audiences and On Our Selection (1932) had just enjoyed a fifth run in Sydney, indicating the market was still strong for Dad and Dave movies. Hall preferred making drama – \\"It is so much cleaner\\", he said, \\"There is no mess of piesand so forth to be swept from the studio, as there is after slapstick\\" – but was not as sure-fire a genre as a Dad and Dave film. In May 1938, as Cinesound were finishing Let George Do It, Hall announced they would make a Rudd film about Dad and Dave inheriting a store in the city. Hall said, \\"when we begin work on the new film, I will have to be careful about green, because Bert Bailey has all the theatrical hatred of the colour. When we were producing the first of the Dad and Dave films. Dave wore a green vest, and Mr. Bailey blamed everything that went wrong on the set to that vest.\\" \\"I'm fully prepared for verbal onslaughts from a certain section of the public that considers we are ruining Australia's prestige overseas\\", said Hall before filming. \\"In fact, it's the English markets that vitally concern us. But as our pictures have been subjected to certain restrictions there, we have cut our cloth to suit our pocket. Cinesound's next picture will be made for Australian audiences.\\" Hall added that \\"I know that a handful o* people will criticise us for continuing to burlesque the Australian cockney In 'Dad and Dave Come to Town', but it will be entertainment, and that,after all, is what patrons pay for. Dad and Dave \\"no more represent the man on the land than Ralph Lynn, the 'silly ass' comedian, represents the average Englishman. But Lynn is funny, and so are Dad and Dave. After all, 'On Our Selection' has made more money in Australia than any other picture-American and English included.\\" Unlike the first two Dad and Dave films, this was not based on a play by Bailey but an original story by Ken G. Hall. Hall claims he asked his regular writer Frank Harvey to develop a premise, but Harvey could not do it, and indeed threatened to resign prior to the scripting of the film because he felt he couldn't write comedy. However, Hall came up with a story and Harvey stayed on the film, ending up with a writing credit. Uncredited work was done on the script by Hall's \\"comedy team\\" of Jim Bancks, Hal Carleton and Bill Maloney.Philip Taylor, 'Ken G. Hall', Cinema Papers January 1974 p 85 The humour was considerably more risque than normal for a Cinesound film.Paul Byrne, 'Curator's Notes' on Dad and Dave Come to Town Clip 2 at Australian Screen Online Bailey said \\"wireless has helped to bring the Australian farmer in touch with the city, I admit that, but there are still thousands of country people who cannot afford a wireless. 'Dad' is modelled on the small farmer-not the squatter, who has his swimming pool, and parties guaranteed to show even the city dweller a thing or two. \\"In 'Dad and Dave Come to Town' we have modernised 'Dad and Dave,' but I think audiences will find the humour of these characters is still typical.\\" The character of Pierre, the villain, was described in the shooting script as \\"presumably a Frenchman, but in forgetful moments dropping into Jewish idiom\\".Frank Harvey, Dad and Dave Come to Town shooting script 4 August 1938 p23-24 at National Archives of Australia Entwistle was described as \\"a very gracious young man, effeminate without being revolting\\"Shooting script p 27 at National Archives of Australia It has been argued this is one of the most personal films from director Hall in part because of the heroic publicity man character (the director used to be a publicist) but also because putting on a fashion show had many parallels to movie making. =Casting= Since Grandad Rudd Bert Bailey had been retired and Fred MacDonald working in Melbourne radio. Bert Bailey and Fred MacDonald repeated their roles as Dad and Dave from the earlier films in the series, but the rest of the cast were newcomers. Ingenue Shirley Ann Richards, who was under long-term contract to Cinesound Productions was cast as Jill. Billy Rayes and Leila Steppe were both Americans touring on the Tivoli vaudeville circuit. Peter Finch plays a young man in love with Dad Rudd's daughter Sarah (Valerie Scanlan). Finch had appeared in a short film, The Magic Shoes (1935), but this was his first feature. He was recommended to Hall by George Cross, Cinesound's casting director, and so impressed the director he was cast in the role. \\"He was almost painfully thin in his early days, with high, prominent cheekbones, and his looks gave no real promise of the handsome, world-class screen star he matured into overseas\\", wrote Hall in his memoirs. \\"But from the beginning he was a really first-class actor.\\"Hall p 149 Indeed, Hall later cast Finch in a larger role in Mr. Chedworth Steps Out (1939). Valerie Scanlan was an 18-year-old Sydney actor who had come to the attention of George Cross in an amateur production of Men Without Wives. It was her first film role. Muriel Flood was a former vaudeville actor who was a well known radio personality \\"Susie\\" on 2GB.'DAD & DAVE Come to Town', The Mercury (Hobart), Saturday 3 September 1938 p 5 Shooting Filming started in June 1938. Norman Rydge said \\"The restrictions which have been placed upon Australian pictures under the new British Film Quota Act have quickened rather than retarded production In our studios. While we feel that these restrictions will eventually be lifted, we are, in the meantime, adapting ourselves to the new conditions by making films with a greater appeal to Australian audiences.\\" The film was shot at Cinesound's Bondi studio and on location in Camden. In contrast with On Our Selection, an estimated 75% of which was shot on location, only 20% of Dad and Dave Come to Town was filmed outside the studio. The fashion show involved 45 dresses designed by Mavis Ripper worth £2,000 worn by 18 different girls. Eric Thompson designed the elaborate sets. ReceptionCritical= Reviews were extremely positive. The Bulletin called it \\" an uproarious hotchpotch of damnfoolery, fallabout, occasional burlesque and good honest fun.\\" The film was a success at the box office, Ken G. Hall later calling it a \\"very substantial hit\\",Hall p 147 which matched the earnings of On Our Selection in Australia and exceeded them in New Zealand. Variety said \\"it broke records everywhere\\".https://archive.org/stream/variety133-1939-01#page/n22/mode/1up It led to a fourth (and final) entry in the series, Dad Rudd, MP (1940), in which many of the cast of this film reprised their roles. =Overseas Release= The film was released in England as The Rudd Family Goes to Town, and was the first Australian movie to screen in a cinema on the West End. According to Hall, it earned over £35,000 in Britain. It was released in the US as The Farmer Goes to Town. Hall said in 1939 that \\"It just goes to show that the characters of ' Dad and Dave ' which many regard as presenting Australians in an unfavorable light, are international in their appeal and that they arc refreshing in their individual type of modern entertainment.\\" Legacy In one scene, Jill (Shirley Ann Richards) says to Jim Bradley (Billy Rayes), \\"Don't call me girlie\\". This line was used as the title for a 1985 documentary about women in the Australian film industry. The character of Entwistle (Alec Kellaway), the effeminate floorwalker who works at the fashion store, is a rare gay character in early Australian cinema. Although a stereotype, he is depicted as a loyal friend of the hero – the \\"first upfront camp male character to be treated in a positive fashion\\"Philippa Hawker, 'There's nought so queer as folk',, The Age, 10 March 2004 and was so popular with audiences he returned in Dad Rudd, MP (1940).

Born István Székely, he was known by several names, based on his changing professional and immigration status, including Stefan Szekely. He directed films in Hungarian, German, and English. He worked as a newspaper journalist in Germany, before returning to Hungary in the early 1930s. He directed one of the most famous classic Hungarian films, the frequently revived comedy Hyppolit, a lakáj (1931). That film was remade in 2000 and the original was later digitally restored and released on DVD. Sekely left pre-war Hungary, fleeing growing Fascism and laws restricting rights and professional opportunities for Jews. He worked in Hollywood for much of his subsequent career, directing mostly B movies and early episodic TV, although he directed his best-known English language film, the cult science fiction thriller The Day of the Triffids in the UK and returned to Hungary to direct his final film, The Girl Who Liked Purple Flowers, which was released in 1973.
