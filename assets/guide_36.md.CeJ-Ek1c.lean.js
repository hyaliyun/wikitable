The planet was discovered by the radial velocity method, using the HARPS apparatus in June 2008. It is the most massive of the six proposed planets in the system. The planet is of interest as this star has relatively low metallicity, supporting a hypothesis that different metallicities in protostars determine what kind of planets they will form. Discovery HD 40307 d was discovered through the Doppler spectroscopy method, which functions by measuring the variations in radial velocity in a star produced by the gravitational effect of orbiting exoplanets. The radial velocities were measured by the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher spectrography system (HARPS) at the La Silla Observatory in Chile's Atacama Desert. The other less massive planets orbiting HD 40307 were discovered in the same way: HD 40307 b and HD 40307 c first, and then HD 40307 e, HD 40307 f, and HD 40307 g. The discovery of HD 40307 d and the former two was announced at the astrophysics conference that took place on June 16‚Äì18, 2008 in Nantes, France. Orbit and mass HD 40307 d has a mass of at least 9.2 times Earth's; assuming that all planets in the system have coplanar orbits, it is the most massive planet known in the system. The planet orbits approximately 0.135 astronomical units from its primary star, as compared to Earth's orbit at approximately one astronomical unit away from the Sun. As a result, one year on HD 40307 d constitutes approximately 20.45 Earth days. The eccentricity of the planet's orbit was found to not differ significantly from zero, meaning that there is insufficient data to distinguish the orbit from an entirely circular one. The star around which HD 40307 d orbits has an unusually low metallicity compared to that of other planet-bearing stars. This supports a hypothesis concerning the possibility that the metallicity of stars during their births may determine whether a protostar's accretion disk forms gas giants or terrestrial planets. Characteristics The planet has not been found to transit and, further, it is not likely to. It has also not been imaged. More specific physical characteristics such as radius, composition, and average surface temperature cannot be observed.Characterizing Extrasolar Planets, Timothy M. Brown, chapter 3, Extrasolar Planets: XVI Canary Islands Winter School of Astrophysics, edited by Hans Deeg, Juan Antonio Belmonte, and Antonio Aparicio, Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2007, . A dynamical study of planets b, c, and d showed tidal effects at least on b and c, to the extent that b had to be a sub-Neptune. All the planets from b to at least f must have migrated inward. That study implied that d was a sub-Neptune as well. As such strong tidal forces often result in the destruction of larger natural satellites in planets orbiting close to a star, it is unlikely that HD 40307 d hosts any satellites.

Kennedy Civic Arena (also known as Kennedy Arena) is an indoor ice skating and ice hockey arena located in Rome, New York. The arena was home to the Copper City Chiefs of the North East Hockey League during the league's failed 2007‚Äì2008 season. The arena would have been home to the Eastern Professional Hockey League franchise, but the team folded before the season. During the 2010-2011 season, it was home to the Rome Frenzy of the Federal Hockey League. The John F. Kennedy Civic Arena is one of the City of Rome‚Äôs most popular venues. It was originally constructed in 1963, opened in 1964, and renovated in 2008. The arena hosts numerous figure skating and ice hockey events, as well as learn-to-skate programs for youths. It is home to the Rome Free Academy varsity hockey team, which plays its home games at the 1,200-seat facility. The arena is a regional facility, used primarily for ice hockey and figure skating from October through March. The primary users are the Ford Stanwix Hockey Association, a not-for-profit youth hockey organization; Rome Free Academy; Rome Catholic High School; a local figure skating club; various local groups and organizations, and the general public. The arena is located at 500 W. Embargo Street in the City of Rome. It is co-located with the Municipal Pool. Municipal Pool is a community facility, open from June through early September. It includes a standard-size recreational swimming pool, two water play slides, and a bathhouse with restrooms. It meets the recreational swimming needs of west Rome. The arena and pool are served by a large parking lot off of Jay and Embargo Streets with space for more than 150 vehicles. A smaller lot on the arena's west side is used primarily by employees and hockey officials. Copper City Chiefs The Copper City Chiefs semi-professional hockey team was established in 1963 and folded at the end of the 1988 season. The team played in the Kennedy Arena when it opened in 1964. During the 1960s they played in a league of cities in the state of New York. In the 1970s they played in a league of teams from New England states and New York. In the 1980s, the team played against Senior A, Senior B, and Intermediate Level teams from Ontario, Canada. The Rome Copper City Chiefs were organized in 1963 under their original name of the Rome Knights, an unchartered recreational organization which was begun to provide athletic recreation in the form of ice hockey to adults who had played minor professional or college ice hockey. For six years, until 1971, the Knights played ice hockey by invitation; that is, inviting teams from the surrounding area to Rome's John F. Kennedy Arena.Ron Sweeney, interview conducted by Robert Kirchner, Rome, New York, 21 May 1985. The Knights were not part of any formal league at this time, nor were they affiliated with a National Hockey League (NHL) or professional hockey team. However, during their existence many of their rostered players had some minor professional experience. The Knights engaged in strictly invitational hockey games, usually paying expenses of the opposing team so they would play in Rome. This was gradually expanded over the years to include teams from as far away as Massachusetts, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and the Canadian province of Ontario. In the middle 1960s, interest in the Knights ice hockey team increased, primarily as an overflow from the Clinton Comets of the Eastern Hockey League, a professional farm team for the New York Rangers of the NHL. The presence of former Clinton Comets, along with the Knights' physical style of play, stimulated the general population's interest in attending Rome Knights hockey games. In 1971 the Rome Knights changed their name to the Copper City Chiefs. Rome is referred to as the Copper City, after the Revere Manufacturing Plant that once produced copperware in the city through the 1970s. The Rome Copper City Chiefs continued to play invitational games and increased their following in and around central New York. In 1971 the Clinton Comets folded. This brought more professional players to the Chiefs and added to the increased attendance at their games. A new general manager took control of the team and instituted a publicity campaign to further increase game attendance and provide further incentives for local business sponsorship. During the 1972‚Äì1973 season, the Chiefs' general manager met with managers of opposing teams, and they decided to form the Northeastern United States Hockey League. This was composed of teams from upstate New York, parts of Massachusetts, and northern New Jersey. League play, coupled with increased advertising and publicity, helped increase attendance, but also required the Chiefs to play in more away games. As added incentive for fans to attend their games, schedules of play were arranged for the 1973-1974 season to give maximum home play to teams that had a traditional adversary relationship. The league was successful and attendance between 1973 and 1975 increased to an overall average of 900 per game. End-of-season league play-offs were standing room only. But involvement in the league, which was never formalized enough to support and enforce the schedules (i.e., no penalty for missed games, forfeitures), also created additional expenses for all the teams. The league folded as teams withdrew due to financial hardships.Rome (New York) Daily Sentinel, 11 February 1974 During their 25 years of existence, supporter participation fluctuated, peaking during 1973-1975. Those seasons showed average game attendances of approximately 900. After the 1975 season, participation gradually declined, culminating in the 1984-1985 season's average attendance of 250.David Adams, interview conducted by Robert Kirchner, Rome, New York, 2 June 1985. Renovations After an almost $3.5 million renovation, Kennedy Arena was officially dedicated on January 30, 2009.J. F. Kennedy Arena Renovation Project The renovation raised the seating capacity from 800 to 1,200. Other improvements included a longer ice rink; new boards, glass, and safety net; new bleachers across the back end of the arena; four new locker rooms; upgrades to locker rooms; and an enhanced heating and lighting system.http://when-in-rome.com/index.php Improvements were also made to the warming room and concession area, to allow for more and better off- season use of the facility, including usage by teens and seniors. The shell of the building remains relatively unchanged from its original construction in 1963.

US 11 enters the state near Ridgeway, and crosses into Maryland just south of Williamsport. The highway closely parallels Interstate 81 (I-81) for its entire length. Route description View north along US 11 in Inwood US 11 begins as an extension of US 11 in Virginia, crossing the state line just north of Rest. The highway travels northwest through a light residential setting in the community of Ridgeway. After leaving Ridgeway, the US 11, named Winchester Avenue, passes through light woodlands before they give way to the community of Bunker Hill. The highway, now named the Winchester Pike serves as the main north‚Äìsouth highway through the town. Several small business and residences line the highway as it leaves Bunker Hill. As the highway continues north, it passes between several sports stadiums before entering urbanized Inwood. In Inwood, US 11 comes to a roundabout with West Virginia Route 51 (WV 51). As with the community of Ridgeway and Bunker Hill, US 11 serves as the main north‚Äìsouth road through the town. The intersection of County Route 32 and the Winchester Pike forms the southwestern corner of the Eastern WV Regional Airport, which the pike passes to the west of as it approaches the community of Pikeside and an intersection with County Route 19. The name of the road changes back to Winchester Avenue as it heads north into the city of Martinsburg, intersecting WV 45 before the highway turns east onto West King Street. US 11 heads east for several blocks along King Street before turning north along Queen Street, concurrent with WV 9 and WV 45\\\\. The three highways pass just west of the Martinsburg station, which services both Amtrak's Capitol Limited and MARC's Brunswick Line, before passing under CSX's Cumberland Subdivision. An intersection with East Moler Avenue carries WV 45 east, while another interchange in the northern outskirts of the city carries WV 9 north towards a cloverleaf interchange with I-81 as US 11 turns northeast. US 11 continues north through the communities of Bessemer and Hainesville, where the highway meets County Route 5, before approaching an intersection with WV 901, which serves as a short connector route to I-81. After passing through the community of Falling Waters on the western banks of the Potomac River, the highway turns more towards the north and has its only grade-separated interchange, a diamond interchange with I-81. After crossing over the freeway, a left intersection with County Route 1 provides access to Little Georgetown to the west as the pike passes through the community of Marlowe. US 11 in West Virginia ends at the southwestern bank of the Potomac River, however the roadway continues north as US 11 in Maryland. In contrast to I-81, no part of US 11 is listed on the National Highway System, a system of roads that are important to the nation's economy, defense and mobility. History The highway roughly parallels the Warrior Path, an old Indian trail which connected New York to the Carolina Piedmont via Virginia and West Virginia. A series of roads linking Virginia to Maryland through Martinsburg were present on maps as early as 1873. US 11 is one of the original six highways that were part of the U.S. Numbered Highway System in the state, the others being US 19, US 21, US 40, US 50, and US 60. The oldest bridge still in use on the highway is the bridge over Middle Creek, about north of the interchange with County Route 11/8 in Martinsburg.

The original part of the home of Thomas Reade Rootes Cobb is a Greek Revival four-over-four \\"Plantation Plain\\" built about 1834. The house given in 1844 to Cobb and his new wife, Marion Lumpkin, as a gift from his father-in-law, Joseph Henry Lumpkin, the first Chief Justice of the Georgia Supreme Court. Cobb made additions to the house of new rooms, and by 1852, it had acquired its octagon shape and two- story portico. Cobb died in 1862, and his widow remained in the house until 1873 when she sold it. The house was maintained and the Cobb family was served by the two dozen enslaved people Cobb owned, who lived behind the main house. Until 1962, the house was used for a variety of purposes including rental property, a fraternity house, and a boarding house. In 1962, the Archdiocese of Atlanta bought the house to use as the rectory and offices for St. Joseph Catholic Church. In the 1980s, the parish was planning to demolish the house, and the Stone Mountain Memorial Association stepped forward in 1984, bought it, and relocated it to Stone Mountain Park in 1985. The restoration of the house never took place because of lack of funding, and the house sat for nearly twenty years. In 2004 the Watson-Brown Foundation bought the house and returned it to Athens in the spring of 2005. The Watson-Brown Foundation restored the house to its appearance of 1850; in 2008, the Georgia Trust gave their work its Preservation Award for excellence in restoration. The house was delisted from the National Register in 1985, but was re-listed on July 23, 2013. The house is now open as a house museum located at 175 Hill Street in Cobbham Historic District. The same foundation also operates other historic house museums in Georgia including Hickory Hill in Thomson and the May Patterson Goodrum House in Atlanta. ReferencesExternal links * T. R. R.

Early years He was only six years old when he discovered the bandoneon, it was love at first sight, and his family was then faced with the difficult task of finding him a small instrument, known as a bandoneon 3/4, so that he could begin his studies. His first teacher was Tito Aparicio. He never planned on a career as a musician, it merely happened. At the age of eight, he appeared as a soloist on radio stations LT2 and LT8 of the city of Rosario. Then, he began to work as a freelance bandeoneonist. He perfected his technique with Jose Bustamante and, like Anibal Troilo and Astor Piazzolla before him, he benefited from the influence of mythical Rosario Bandoneon player Antonio Rios. He also studied harmony, counterpoint and composition with Titi Rossi. Career Today he is a player with and exceptional technique, combined with his natural gift for discovering and illuminating the natural spaces in music. At 27 years old, moved to Buenos Aires, where he became one of the most sought-after bandoneon players on the tango scene, and played with many different groups, including the Jose Basso, Osvaldo Berlinghieri, Alberto Di Paulo, Carlos Lazari, Osvaldo Piro, Osvaldo Requena, Francisco Rotundo and Hector Varela tango orchestras. He also established his own groups, with which he performed extensively in the better known tango venues of Buenos Aires such as Michelangelo, Ca√±o 14 and La Ciudad, and toured all over the world. He created Ensamble Trio (bandoneon, piano and bass), played duos with guitarist Jorge Labanca and, together with bandoneonist Lisandro Adrover, set up the revolutionary nonet Ensamble Porte√±o (flute, clarinet, two violins, two bandoneons, piano, bass and percussion). These groups mainly used Varvello's own arrangements and played and recorded many of his works. The albums Despertar en Buenos Aires (Ensamble Porte√±o, 1978), Momentos Inestables (Ensamble Trio, 1984) and Devenir (Duoo Varvello- Labanca, 1989) bear witness to his work of those years. He is currently a member of the orchestra accompanying the highly acclaimed show Forever Tango which has been staged the world over, including Europe, Japan and de U.S. In 2002, the famous company TESTIGO published \\"A magic instrument\\", where this exceptional artist, brings awareness of the uniqueness of this incredible instrument in classical music, a unique feat of this kind, he played Bach, Schubert, Chopin, Brahms, and also tango music. In 2003 the company Zaf records from Argentina, published \\"Tangos de Vanguardia\\" Trio Ensemble, under his direction and arrangements.

It is believed that children invented the game. It is not certain as to when the game was invented but it can be tracked back to as far as the nineteen fifties. Rules It is played with a minimum of three players. Two players stand about fifty feet apart facing each other and are considered the throwers. They are partners working together against the third player who is the dodger. The third player (dodger), runs back and forth in between the two throwers, whose job is to try to hit the dodger with a ball. The goal of the dodger is to dodge as many throws while running back and forth between the two throwers. The strategy is to stay as far as possible from the thrower that has the ball. For every attempt that the dodger dodges successfully they receive a point. A Thrower may strategically throw the ball to the opposite thrower in a manner where the ball is easy to catch and is of no threat to the dodger in an attempt to set up a play for the opposite thrower to get a good chance of hitting the dodger. The game can be played in several different formats. There can be several dodgers running between the throwers. The throwers attempt to get as many of them out as quickly as possible. If the last person standing is able to dodge ten throws successively, they win the game. The game may also be played in a team verses team format, which is usually the case when boys get involved. A team consisting of boys usually compete against a team made up of girls. Each team sends one dodger at a time to battle against the two throwers representing the other team. Whichever team is able to get the most dodgers dodging ten throws successively wins the game. The game requires a great degree of athletic ability, some throwers can throw the ball as fast as 70 to 80 MPH. They have to be accurate throwers with control so that if they do miss a potential dodger the opposite thrower is able to catch the ball and make a throw in stride. Good dodgers are usually even more athletic, they run between throwers with their eyes on the ball jumping, leaping and even diving out of the way of an incoming throw.

Rockefeller (LSR) Preserve is a refuge within Grand Teton National Park on the southern end of Phelps Lake, Wyoming. The site was originally known as the JY Ranch, a dude ranch. Starting in 1927, John D. Rockefeller, Jr. purchased much of the land in Jackson Hole for the creation of Jackson Hole National Monument and the expansion of Grand Teton National Park. But he retained the JY Ranch as a family retreat. Over the years the family gave most of the ranch to the national park. Laurance S. Rockefeller donated the final parcel in 2001. The donation came with special preservation and maintenance restrictions, with the vision that the preserve remain a place where visitors can experience a spiritual and emotional connection to the beauty of the lake and the Teton Range.Laurance S. Rockefeller Preserve Trail Guide, National Park Service, circa 2007. JY Ranch The lands that formed the JY Ranch were first homesteaded in 1903 by Dave Spalding. He sold the property in 1906 to Louis Joy, who, with Struthers Burt, converted the property to Jackson Hole's first dude ranch, abbreviating Joy's last name to \\"JY.\\" The ranch was purchased by the Rockefellers' Snake River Land Company in 1932, becoming a family retreat. Natural features The LSR Preserve features several types of natural communities. Sagebrush meadows are relatively dry and are home to a variety of wildflowers and animal species. The preserve's forests are predominantly composed of fir, spruce, and lodgepole pine with intermittent growth of cottonwoods and aspens. Sedges and other low plants grow in the wetlands providing food and cover for migrating birds. Eight miles (13 km) of trails provide public access to these natural communities. Innovative project Mr. Rockefeller hoped that his project would serve as a model for the National Parks. The overall plan for the preserve was developed by D. R. Horne & Company with advice regarding user experience from Kevin Coffee Museum Planning. Prerequisite to creating the LSR Preserve, the cabins, stables and other built environment that had been part of the Rockefeller family's presence at the JY Ranch were removed and those sites were carefully bio-remediated with seeds or plantings collected from nearby locations within the site. A nine-mile system of hiking trails lead through sub-alpine and wetland habitat, with vistas along the southern edge of Phelps Lake. The visitor experience is prompted via the 7,573 ft2 (704 m2) visitor center situated at the lowest elevation of the Preserve. The visitor center building was designed by Carney Architects of Jackson, Wyoming with the Rocky Mountain Institute consulting on energy and daylighting analysis. Hershberger Design prepared the landscape design plan for the visitor center site and trails. A team of designers, cinematographers, photographers, sound recordists, writers and others contributed to the displays inside the visitors center and those efforts are noted on a plaque in the center, which was dedicated on June 21, 2008. The visitor center was the first Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certified property in Wyoming and only the fifty-second Platinum rating in the LEED program.

Biography Early life = Johan Kievit (first name sometimes spelled Joan or Johannes; last name variously given as Kievidt or Kiewit) was the son of Nicolaas Kievit and Dieuwertje Pauw,Van der Aa, p. 52 both of well- known Rotterdam families. He married Alida Tromp, the daughter of lieutenant- admiral Maarten Tromp on 27 April 1653Digital Family Tree Rotterdam under \\"Johannes Kievit\\" and \\"Alijda Tromp\\" in marriage register when she was only 16 (and he 26). He practiced law before the Hof van Holland (the main law court of the province of Holland), before going into politics in 1659, when he became a member of the Rotterdam vroedschap. In May 1666 he was appointed a member of the Gecommitteerde Raden (Committed Councillors - the Executive) of the States of Holland and West Friesland. =The Buat-conspiracy= Kievit was a partisan of the young Prince of Orange, William III, who had been excluded from high office by the States-Party regent faction of Johan de Witt during the First Stadtholderless Period. As such he became involved in the treasonous correspondence of Henri de Fleury de Coulan, lord of Buat, better known as \\"cavalry-captain Buat,\\" with the English court of William's uncle Charles II of England, during the Second Anglo-Dutch War. Buat was executed for treason,According to historian Bilderdijk, the father of one of the attempted assassins of De Witt in June 1672, Van der Graef, one of the judges in the trial of Buat, had to recuse himself, which may have skewed the vote in favor of conviction; (1836) Geschiedenis des Vaderlands, p. 282 but Kievit managed to escape to England. He was sentenced to death for his part in the conspiracy in absentia. In England he became a favorite of Charles who made him a baronet. Even before the conspiracy was discovered, Kievit was fired from his position in the gecommitteerde raden, because he published a libelous pamphlet, entitled Brief van den heer van Sommelsdijk (\\"Letter of Lord Sommelsdijk\\"), in which he defended his brother-in-law lieutenant-admiral Cornelis Tromp's conduct during the St. James's Day Battle, disparaging lieutenant-admiral Michiel de Ruyter at the same time.Bilderdijk and Tydeman, op. cit, ppp. 169-171, 271 =The murder of the De Witt brothers= When the Dutch Republic was attacked by France, England, and two German principalities in 1672, Kievit's political fortunes changed again. The attack caused a severe political crisis in the Dutch Republic during this Rampjaar (\\"Year of disaster\\"). Because of the military disaster the De Witt regime was forced to retract the Perpetual Edict (1667) and to appoint Prince William first Captain general (in January), and later (in early July) Stadtholder of Holland and Zeeland. Kievit returned to the Republic and asked to be pardoned and get his office in the Rotterdam vroedschap back. He indeed received a full pardon, in August 1672, from the Prince (Johan de Witt had resigned his office of Grand Pensionary on 4 August).Van der Aa, p. 53 This enabled him to take part in the conspiracy with his brother-in-law Cornelis Tromp (who held a grudge against De Witt, after having been dismissed from the navy in 1666 because of the quarrel with De Ruyter), and several members of the Hague civic militia, who were close associates of Kievit, against the De Witt brothers, which resulted in their torture, lynching and mutilation on 20 August 1672. =Later career= Like other conspirators, such as Johan van Banchem (who became baljuw of The Hague), Kievit was rewarded for his crime by the new regime. (1986) John de Witt:Statesman of the \\"true freedom\\" , Cambridge University Press , p. 222 He was first appointed Pensionary of the city of Rotterdam. After only one year in this prestigious office he was appointed advocaat- fiscaal of the Admiralty of Rotterdam. As such he supervised the collection of the customs duties (Convooien en licenten). This office apparently offered good possibilities for corrupt practices. Kievit was arrested on suspicion of embezzlement in 1686 and after a lengthy trial in which his main defense was \\"that everybody did it,\\" convicted and sentenced to banishment in 1689. (1891) Oud Holland, p. 29 However, his daughter Debora, who was married to a son of the governor-general of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) in Batavia, Cornelis Speelman,Taxandria: tijdschrift voor noordbrabantsche geschiedenis en volkskunde, vol. V (1898), pp. 265-266 ransomed him for 20,000 guilders, which enabled him to live out his years in Rotterdam till his death in 1692.

This can include the costs of brownfield restoration and cleanup, liability for injuries and deaths caused by pollution. Most businesses will purchase broad commercial general insurance or property insurance policies but these usually contain an \\"absolute pollution exclusion\\" and thus rarely cover pollution, although there may be limited pollution coverage. Pollution insurance usually takes the form of first-party coverage for contamination of insured property either by external or on-site sources. Coverage is also afforded for liability to third parties arising from contamination of air, water, or land due to the sudden and accidental release of hazardous materials from the insured site. The policy usually covers the costs of cleanup and may include coverage for releases from underground storage tanks. Intentional acts are specifically excluded. The largest players in this industry are AIG, XL, Ace and Zurich.Environmental Pollution Insurance: A Fluid and Ever-changing Market One of the purposes for such insurance policies is so that when companies that cause environmental disasters go bankrupt, the victims can still be compensated.Chemical & Engineering News: Latest News - China's Pollution Insurance The insurance may also protect against cost overruns or regulatory changes that increase the cost of cleanup.Pollution insurance growing in popularity - Philadelphia Business Journal: The director of China's EPA (SEPA) has called for imposing mandatory pollution insurance on polluting industries.As Citizens Sue, China's EPA Demands Compulsory Pollution Insurance : TreeHugger According to the Cato Institute, legal theories of joint and several liability (e.g. under Superfund) and requirements by courts that insurers pay to help polluters clean up their own property (regardless of the insurance contract) have hurt the pollution insurance industry; but nonetheless, the basic idea of pollution insurance remains sound. Cato claims, \\"With the help of insurers and risk analysts, corporate risk managers select cost-effective products and processes, which minimize the sum of insurance premiums, expected payments to victims (in excess of insurance coverage), and risk-reduction expenditures.\\"Reputation And The Efficiency Of Legal Rules  United States  In the United States, the federal U.S. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation & Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), also known as Superfund, is the predominant law. However, there are also important state laws with similar or additional requirements.

Currently, he is emeritus Ancell Professor of Physics at Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts and a Senior Research Associate at California Institute of Technology. Biography Deser earned his B.A. (Summa cum laude) in 1949 at Brooklyn College in New York, and his master's degree 1950 at Harvard, where he also earned his doctorate in 1953, with an article entitled \\"Relativistic Two Body Interactions\\". From 1953 to 1955, he was at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. He was at the Niels Bohr Institute from 1955 to 1957, and a Lecturer at Harvard from 1957 to 1958. He was an Invited Professor at the Sorbonne during 1966-7 and 1971-2, he held a visiting professorship at All Souls College in Oxford in 1977, and a Loeb Lectureship at Harvard in 1975. In the context of general relativity, he developed, with Richard Arnowitt and Charles Misner, the ADM formalism,\\"Dynamical Structure and Definition of Energy in General Relativity\\" Arnowitt, R., Deser, S., & Misner, C., The Physical Review, 116:1322-1330, 1959 roughly speaking a way of describing spacetime as space evolving in time, which allows a recasting Einstein's theory in terms of a more general formalism used in physics to describe dynamical systems, namely the Hamiltonian formalism. In the framework of that formalism, there is also a straightforward way to define globally quantities like energy or, equivalently, mass (so-called ADM mass/energy) which, in general relativity, is not trivial at all. With L. Abbott, Deser extended the notion of energy for gravity with a cosmological constant. And with Claudio Teitelboim he showed that supergravity has positive energy. Another of Deser's research interests is covariant quantum gravity. Deser applied the new formalism of covariant quantum field theory developed by Gerard 't Hooft and Martinus Veltman in the early 1970s. With Peter van Nieuwenhuizen he demonstrated the one loop nonrenormalizability of general relativity plus electromagnetism, plus Yang- Mills, plus Dirac fermions, and plus a cosmological constant. The apparent impasse revealed by these efforts was partially overcome in 1976, following a strikingly independent approach from the contemporary work of Daniel Freedman, Sergio Ferrara and Peter van Nieuwenhuizen, when Deser and Bruno Zumino demonstrated that a spin 3/2 field can be added to general relativity to produce a consistent, locally supersymmetric theory called supergravity. In 1994, Deser, along with Arnowitt and Misner, received the Dannie Heineman Prize for Mathematical Physics. Along with Misner he won the 2015 Einstein Medal. He has been a Guggenheim and a Fulbright Fellow, received honorary doctorates from Stockholm University (1978) and the Chalmers Institute of Technology (2001), and he is a fellow of both the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the United States National Academy of Sciences.

Brackett House is a historic octagon house at 290 Highland Avenue in Winchester, Massachusetts. Built in the early 1850s by sculptor Edward Augustus Brackett, and based on popular plans described by Orson Squire Fowler, it is Winchester's only octagonal house. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. Description and history The Bracket House is set back from the east side of Highland Avenue, a north-south route through the east side of Winchester. The house, as built in the early 1850s, is a distinctive design made by Brackett, an eccentric artist and naturalist, that adhered fairly closely to recommendations of Orson Squire Fowler in the first edition of The Octagon House: A Home for All, the work which set off a brief period of interest in those houses. It consisted of a series of four interlocking octagons, with varying heights and roof lines to create interesting visual effects. A fifth octagonal unit was added by Brackett in c. 1900 which added a shed space on the first floor and a bedroom on the second, along with a veranda. The building was originally finished in vertical board-and-batten siding and trimmed with then-fashionable Italianate brackets under its eaves, but these features were removed during the 1900 renovations, and the building exterior was redone in stucco. Edward A. Brackett Edward Brackett was a distinctive local personality, trained as a sculptor but also a poet and conservationist. He established a fish hatchery nearby, and ran a commercial nursery. He lived in the house until his death in 1908.

It is called as Dhakshina Meru (Meru of south). Built by Tamil king Raja Raja Chola I between 1003 and 1010 AD, the temple is a part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site known as the \\"Great Living Chola Temples\\", along with the Chola dynasty era Gangaikonda Cholapuram temple and Airavatesvara temple that are about and to its northeast respectively. The original monuments of this 11th century temple were built around a moat. It included gopura, the main temple, its massive tower, inscriptions, frescoes and sculptures predominantly related to Shaivism, but also of Vaishnavism and Shaktism traditions of Hinduism. The temple was damaged in its history and some artwork is now missing. Additional mandapam and monuments were added in centuries that followed. The temple now stands amidst fortified walls that were added after the 16th century. Built out of granite, the vimana tower above the sanctum is one of the tallest in South India. It was, in all likelihood, one of the tallest structures in the world at the time of its construction. The temple has a massive colonnaded prakara (corridor) and one of the largest Shiva lingas in India. It is also famed for the quality of its sculpture, as well as being the location that commissioned the brass Nataraja ‚Äì Shiva as the lord of dance, in 11th century. The complex includes shrines for Nandi, Parvati, Kartikeya, Ganesha, Sabhapati, Dakshinamurti, Chandeshvara, Varahi and others. The temple is one of the most visited tourist attractions in Tamil Nadu. Nomenclature Rajaraja, who commissioned the temple, called it Rajarajeshvaram (RajarƒÅje≈õvaram), literally \\"the temple of the god of Rajaraja\\". A later inscription in the Brihannayaki shrine calls the temple's deity Periya Udaiya Nayanar, which appears to be the source of the modern names Brihadisvara and Peruvudaiyar Kovil. Brihadishvara (IAST: B·πõih√°dƒ´≈õvara) is a Sanskrit composite word composed of Brihat which means \\"big, great, lofty, vast\\",Brihat, Monier Monier Williams, Sanskrit English Dictionary, Oxford University Press, page 735 and Ishvara means \\"lord, Shiva, supreme being, supreme atman (soul)\\".Monier Williams, Sanskrit-English dictionary, I·π°var√°, Oxford University Press, page 171James Lochtefeld, \\"Ishvara\\", The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A‚ÄìM, Rosen Publishing. , page 306 The name means the \\"great lord, big Shiva\\" temple. Location The Brihadeswara Temple is located in the city of Thanjavur, about southwest of Chennai. The city is connected daily to other major cities by the network of Indian Railways, Tamil Nadu bus services and the National Highways 67, 45C, 226 and 226 Extn. The nearest airport with regular services is Tiruchirappalli International Airport (IATA: TRZ), about away. The city and the temple though inland, are at the start of the Cauveri River delta, thus with access to the Bay of Bengal and through it to the Indian Ocean. Along with the temples, the Tamil people completed the first major irrigation network in the 11th century for agriculture, for movement of goods and to control the water flow through the urban center. History Rajaraja Chola I who built the temple over 1003-1010 CE. A spectrum of Hindu temple styles continued to develop from the 5th to the 9th century over the Chalukya era rule as evidenced in Aihole, Badami and Pattadakal, and then with the Pallava era as witnessed at Mamallapuram and other monuments. Thereafter, between 850 and 1280 CE, Cholas emerged as the dominant dynasty. The early Chola period saw a greater emphasis on securing their geopolitical boundaries and less emphasis on architecture. In the 10th century, within the Chola empire emerged features such as the multifaceted columns with projecting square capitals. This, states George Michell, signaled the start of the new Chola style. This South Indian style is most fully realized both in scale and detail in the Brihadeshvara temple built between 1003 and 1010 by the Chola king Rajaraja I. =Additions, renovations and repairs= The main temple along with its gopurams are from the early 11th century. The temple also saw additions, renovations, and repairs over the next 1,000 years. The raids and wars, particularly between Muslim Sultans who controlled Madurai and Hindu kings who controlled Thanjavur caused damage. These were repaired by Hindu dynasties that regained control. In some cases, the rulers attempted to renovate the temple with faded paintings, by ordering new murals on top of the older ones. In other cases, they sponsored addition of shrines. The significant shrines of Kartikeya (Murugan), Parvati (Amman) and Nandi are from the 16th and 17th- century Nayaka era.George Michell (2008), Architecture and art of Southern India, Cambridge University Press, pages 16-21, 89-91 Similarly the Dakshinamurti shrine was built later. DescriptionArchitecture= Brihadisvara temple, seen in profile. The Brihadeshvara temple plan and development utilizes the axial and symmetrical geometry rules.Thapar 2004, pp.43, 52‚Äì53 It is classified as Perunkoil (also called Madakkoil), a big temple built on a higher platform of a natural or man-made mounds. The temple complex is a rectangle that is almost two stacked squares, covering east to west, and north to south. In this space are five main sections: the sanctum with the towering superstructure (sri vimana), the Nandi hall in front (Nandi- mandapam) and in between these the main community hall (mukhamandapam), the great gathering hall (mahamandapam) and the pavilion that connects the great hall with the sanctum (ardhamandapam). The temple complex integrates a large pillared and covered veranda (prakara) in its spacious courtyard, with a perimeter of about for circumambulation. Outside this pillared veranda there are two walls of enclosure, the outer one being defensive and added in 1777 CE by the French colonial forces with gun-holes with the temple serving as an arsenal. They made the outer wall high, isolating the temple complex area. On its east end is the original main gopuram or gateway that is barrel vaulted. It is less than half the size of the main temple's vimana. Additional structures were added to the original temple after the 11th century, such as a mandapa in its northeast corner and additional gopurams (gateways) on its perimeters to allow people to enter and leave from multiple locations. Some of the shrines and structures were added during the Pandya, Nayaka, Vijayanagara and Maratha era, before the colonial era started, and these builders respected the original plans and symmetry rules. Inside the original temple courtyard, along with the main sanctum and Nandi-mandapam are two major shrines, one for Kartikeya and for Parvati. The complex has additional smaller shrines.Tanjavur: Brhadisvara temple, The monument and the living tradition , Kapila Vatsyayan and R Nagaswamy et al, Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts, Government of India (2012), page 7 The Brihadisvara temple continued the Hindu temple traditions of South India by adopting architectural and decorative elements, but its scale significantly exceeded the temples constructed before the 11th century. The Chola era architects and artisans innovated the expertise to scale up and build, particularly with heavy stone and to accomplish the high towering vimana. The temple faces east, and once had a water moat around it. This has been filled up. The fortified wall now runs around this moat. The two walls have ornate gateways called the gopurams. These are made from stone and display entablature. The main gateways are on the east side. The first one is called the Keralantakan tiruvasal, which means the \\"sacred gate of the Keralantakan\\". The word Keralantakan was the surname of king Rajaraja who built it. About a ahead is the inner courtyard gopuram called the Rajarajan tiruvasal. This is more decorated than the Keralantakan tiruvasal, such as with its adhishthanam relief work narrating scenes from the Puranas and other Hindu texts. The inner eastern gopuram leads to a vast courtyard, in which the shrines are all signed to east-west and north-west cardinal directions. The complex can be entered either on one axis through a five-story gopuram or with a second access directly to the huge main quadrangle through a smaller free-standing gopuram. The gopuram of the main entrance is 30 m high, smaller than the vimana. The main temple-related monuments and the great tower is in the middle of this courtyard. Around the main temple that is dedicated to Shiva, are smaller shrines, most of which are aligned axially. These are dedicated to his consort Parvati, his sons Subrahmanya and Ganesha, Nandi, Varahi, Karuvur deva (the guru of Rajaraja Chola), Chandeshvara and Nataraja. The Nandi mandapam has a monolithic seated bull facing the sanctum. In between them are stairs leading to a columned porch and community gathering hall, then an inner mandapa connecting to the pradakshina patha, or circumambulation path. The Nandi (bull) facing the mukh- mandapam weighs about 25 tonnes. It is made of a single stone and is about 2 m in height, 6 m in length and 2.5 m in width. The image of Nandi is a monolithic one and is one of the largest in the country. =Sanctum and the Sri-vimana= The sanctum is at the center of the western square. It is surrounded by massive walls that are divided into levels by sharply cut sculptures and pilasters providing deep bays and recesses. Each side of the sanctuary has a bay with iconography. The interior of the sanctum sanctorum hosts an image of the primary deity, Shiva, in the form of a huge stone linga. It is called Karuvarai, a Tamil word that means \\"womb chamber\\". This space is called garbha griha in other parts of India. Only priests are allowed to enter this inner-most chamber. In the Dravida style, the sanctum takes the form of a miniature vimana. It has the inner wall together with the outer wall creating a path around the sanctum for circumambulation (pradakshina). The entrance is highly decorated. The inside chamber is the sanctum sanctorum, which houses the brihad linga. The main Vimana (Shikhara) is a massive 16 storeys tower of which 13 are tapering squares. It dominates the main quadrangle. It sits above a sided square. The tower is elaborately articulated with Pilaster, piers(a raised structure), and attached columns which are placed rhythmically covering every surface of the vimana.Ching 2007, pp. 338‚Äì339 Deities and Natya Sastra dance mudras The bronze Nataraja design of Thanjavur found in many museums was commissioned for this temple's sanctum. The temple is dedicated to Shiva in the form of a huge linga, his abstract aniconic representation. It is high, occupying two storeys of the sanctum. It is one of the largest monolithic linga sculptures in India. { class=\\"wikitable floatright\\" align=center style = \\" background: transparent; \\" + Sculptures on the maha- mandapam walls -style=\\"text-align: center;\\"  width=120px style=\\"background: #ffad66;\\"  North side  width=120px style=\\"background: #ffad66;\\"  South side -style=\\"text-align: center;\\"  Bhairava (Shiva)  Ganesha -style=\\"text- align: center;\\"  Mahishasuramardini (Durga)  Vishnu -style=\\"text-align: center;\\"  Saraswati  Gajalakshmi } The sikhara, a cupolic dome (25 tons), is octagonal and rests on a single block of granite, weighing 80 tons. The Shaivism temple celebrates all major Hindu traditions by including the primary deities of the Vaishnavism and Shaktism tradition in the great mandapa of the main temple. The distribution of the deities is generally symmetric, except for the east entrance side which provide for the door and walkway. In addition to the main deities, each side provides for dvarapalas (guardians), and various other sculptures. The vestibule has three stone sculptures that is intricately carved, and mural paintings. The ground floor level sanctum walls have the following sculptures: *East wall: Lingodbhava, standing Shiva, Pashupata-murti, plus two dvarapalas flanking the pathway from ardha-mandapam *South wall: Bhikshatana, Virabhadra, Dakshinamurti, Kalantaka, Nataraja plus two dvarapalas *West wall: Harihara (half Shiva, half Vishnu), Lingodbhava, Chandrashekhara without prabhavali, Chandrashekhara with prabhavali, plus two dvarapalas *North wall: Ardhanarishvara (half Shiva, half Parvati), Gangadhara without Parvati, Pashupata-murti, Shiva-alingana-murti, plus two dvarapalas One of the 81 dance positions carved on the outer wall of the upper storey corridor wall. On the second floor, Shiva's Tripurantaka form in different postures is depicted corresponding to these sculptures. Above these floors, the sri-vimana towers above in thirteen storeys (talas). Above these storeys is a single square block of granite weight 80 tons, and side. On top of this block, at its corners are Nandi pairs each about by in dimension. Above the center of this granite block rises the griva, the sikhara and the finial (stupi) of Tamil Hindu temple architecture. This stupi is in height, and was originally covered with gold (no longer). The sikhara at the top is cupola- shaped and weighs 25 tons. Each storey of this tower is decorated with kutas and salas. The shrinking squares tower architecture of this temple differs from the tower at the Chola temple at Gangaikondasolisvaram, because this is straight in contrast to the latter which is curvilinear. The temple's sri- vimana magnitude has made it a towering landmark for the city. The upper storey corridor wall of the aditala is carved with 81 of the 108 dance karanas ‚Äì postures of Natya Sastra. This text is the basis of the Bharathanatyam, the classical dance of Tamil Nadu. The 27 unrepresented karanas are blank blocks of stone, and it is unclear why these were not carved. The 81 postures carved suggest the significance of this classical Indian dance form by early 11th century. The garbhagriha is square and sits on a plinth. This is moulded and thick. It consists of upapitham and adhishthanam, respectively 140 cm and 360 cm thick. =Mandapa= The two mandapa, namely maha-mandapa and mukha- mandapa, are square plan structures axially aligned between the sanctum and the Nandi mandapa. The maha-mandapa has six pillars on each side. This too has artwork. The Vitankar and Rajaraja I bronze are here, but these were added much later. The maha-mandapa is flanked by two giant stone dvarapalas. It is linked to the mukha-mandapa by stairs. The entrance of the mukha-mandapa also has dvarapalas. With the mandapa are eight small shrines for dikpalas, or guardian deities of each direction such as Agni, Indra, Varuna, Kubera and others. These were installed during the rule of Chola king Rajendra I. Inscriptions indicate that this area also had other iconography from major Hindu traditions during the Chola era, but these are now missing. The original eight shrines included those for Surya (the sun god), Saptamatrikas (seven mothers), Ganesha, Kartikeya, Jyeshtha, Chandra (the moon god), Chandeshvara and Bhairava. Similarly, in the western wall cella was a massive granite Ganesha built during Rajaraja I era, but who is now found in the tiruch- churru-maligai (southern veranda). Of the Shaktism tradition's seven mothers, only Varahi survives in a broken form. Her remnants are now found in a small modern era brick \\"Varahi shrine\\" in the southern side of the courtyard. The original version of the others along with their original Chola shrines are missing. =Murals= The temple has an underneath layer of Chola frescoes on the sanctum walls along the circumambulatory pathway. These frescoes which cover floor to ceiling, were discovered in 1931 by S. K. Govindasami of the Anamalai University. The painters used natural pigments and infused it into the wet limestone layer as it was setting in. The Chola frescoes were largely of Shaivism themes. These were restored in the 2000s.; Another report about Chola frescoes The total Chola fresco area is about , of which about had been uncovered as of 2010 in a method that preserves both paintings, a technique developed by Archaeological Survey of India.PS Sriraman (2010), Digital photo documentation of murals at Brihadisvara Temple, Tanjavur: a tool for art historians in Space, Time, Place (Editors: Stefano Campana et al), pages 167-172 The frescoes narrate Hindu mythology. According to Balasubrahmanyam, most frescoes are related to Shiva, but the 11th century Chola frescoes also show Vishnu, Durga and others, as well as scenes of Chola royalty, courtly and common life. The later constructions, additions and modifications to the temple curtailed the amount of natural light inside the temple. The frescoes were thus photographed in a limited way and interpreted. According to Sriraman, a complete imaging with better photographic equipment suggests that these historic interpretations were incorrect. For example, a fresco that was previously interpreted as Dakshinamurti Shiva is actually a secular scene of a royal guru meditating under a banyan tree. On the tree are shown peacocks, birds, monkeys, squirrels and owls, plus a cobra. The animals and birds are shown as worried of the cobra, the one's closer to the snake are shown to be more worried. Other parts of the panel similarly show a court listening to a saint. Other show women in different dresses in different dance mudra. Some of the paintings in the sanctum sanctorum and the walls in the passage had been damaged because of the soot that had deposited on them once upon a time. Owing to the continuous exposure to smoke and soot from the lamps and burning of camphor in the sanctum sanctorum over a period of centuries certain parts of the Chola paintings on the circumambulatory passage walls had been badly damaged. The Archaeological Survey of India, for the first time in the world, used its unique de-stucco process to restore 16 Nayak paintings, which were superimposed on 1000-year-old Chola frescoes. These 400-year-old paintings have been mounted on fibre glass boards, displayed at a separate pavilion. =Inscriptions= Tamil Inscriptions in Thanjavur Brahadeeshwara Temple written 1000 years ago The temple walls have numerous inscriptions in Tamil and Grantha scripts. Many of these begin with customary Sanskrit and Tamil language historical introduction to the king who authorized it, and predominant number of them discuss gifts to the temple or temple personnel, in some cases residents of the city. The temple complex has sixty four inscriptions of Rajaraja Chola I, twenty nine inscriptions of Rajendra Chola I, one each of Vikrama Chola, Kulottunga I and Rajendradeva (Rajendra Chola II), three of a probable Pandyan king, two of Vijayanagara rulers namely, Achyutappa Nayaka and Mallapa Nayaka. The Brihadishwara Temple has Tamil and Sanskrit inscriptions from the 11th century. =Temple personnel= An inscription on the north wall of enclosure, dated 1011 CE, gives a detailed accounts of people employed and supported by the temple. The inscription gives their wages, roles and names. It includes over 600 names including those of priests, lamp lighters, washermen, tailors, jewelers, potters, carpenters, sacred parasol bearers, dance gurus, dancing girls, singers, male and female musicians, superintendents of performance artists, accountants among others. Their wages was in parcels of land, so their temple employment was likely part-time. The temple employed devadasis who were dancers and singers of devotional hymns. Among its numerous inscriptions are frequent gifts that state, \\"to provide for worship, for food to assembly of sannyasis (monks or ascetics) and for repairs\\". According to George Michell, the Thanjavur temple was a major charity institution in its history. It provides free meal for pilgrims, devotees and wayfarers on a daily basis. On the days of Hindu festivals, these meals were elaborate and when brahmins were particularly invited and fed.PV Jagadisa Ayyar (1993), South Indian Shrines, Asian Educational Services, , pages 411-423 Millennium commemoration 1,000-year- old Thanjavur Brihadeeshwara Temple - view at sunrise. Dancers gathered at Brihadishwara Temple to commemorate it. Built in the year 1010 CE by Raja Raja Chola in Thanjavur, the temple is popularly known as the Big Temple. It turned 1000 years old in September 2010. To celebrate the 1000th year of the grand structure, the state government and the town held many cultural events. It was to recall the 275th day of his 25th regal year (1010 CE) when Raja Raja Chola (985‚Äì1014 CE) handed over a gold-plated kalasam (copper pot or finial) for the final consecration to crown the vimana, the 59.82-metre tall tower above the sanctum. =Bharathanatyam Yajna= To mark the occasion, the state government organised a Bharathanatyam Yajna, classical dance show under noted dancer Padma Subramaniam. It was jointly organised by the Association of Bharatanatyam Artistes of India (ABHAI) and the Brhan Natyanjali Trust, Thanjavur. To mark the 1000th anniversary of the building, 1000 dancers from New Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Singapore, Malaysia and the US danced in concert to the recorded 11 verses of divine music Thiruvisaippa (ninth volume of Thirumurai) composed by Karuvur deva (the guru of Raja Raja Chola). The small town turned into a cultural hub for two days beginning 26 September 2010 as street performers and dancers performed throughout the town. =Commemorative stamps and coins= On 26 September 2010 (Big Temple's fifth day of millennium celebrations), as a recognition of Big Temple's contribution to the country's cultural, architectural, epigraphical history, a special 5 postage stamp featuring the 216-feet tall giant Raja Gopuram was released by India Post. The Reserve Bank of India commemorated the event by releasing a 5 coin with the model of temple embossed on it. A Raja, Cabinet Minister of Communications and Information Technology released the esteemed Brihadeeswarar temple special stamp, the first of which was received by G K Vasan, Cabinet Minister of Shipping. Mumbai Mint issued Rs 1000 Commemorative Coin with the same picture as on the Rs 5 coin. It was the first 1000 Rupees coin to be released in the Republic of India coinage. This coin was a Non Circulative Legal Tender (NCLT). On 1 April 1954, the Reserve Bank of India released a 1000 currency note featuring a panoramic view of the Brihadeeswar temple marking its cultural heritage and significance. In 1975, the then government led by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi demonetised all 1,000 currency notes in an effort to curtail black money. These notes are now popular among collectors. In 2010, the then Tamil Nadu chief minister, M Karunanidhi renamed Semmai Rice, a type of high productivity paddy variant, as Raja Rajan-1000 to mark the millennial year of the constructor of the temple, Rajaraja Chola]. Reception The temple \\"testifies the brilliant achievements of the Chola in architecture, sculpture, painting and bronze casting.\\" The temple finds mention in many of the contemporary works of the period like Muvar Ula and Kalingathuparani. According to Chatterjee, the Dravidian architecture attained its supreme form of expression in the temple and it successor, the Brihadeeswarar Temple, Gangaikonda Cholapuram. The temple has been declared as a heritage monument by the Government of India and administered by the Archaeological Survey of India as a protected monument. The temple is one of the most visited tourist attractions in Tamil Nadu. The temple was declared as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, along with the Brihadeeswara Temple at Gangaikondacholapuram and Airavatesvara temple at Darasuram that are referred as the Great Living Chola Temples. These three temples have similarities, but each has unique design and sculptural elements. All of the three temples were built by the Cholas between the 10th and 12th centuries CE and they have continued to be supported and used by Hindus. The temples are classified as \\"Great Living\\" as the temples are active in cultural, pilgrimage and worship practises in modern times. =Cultural events= Temple festival procession, 2015 The Brihadishvara temple at Thanjavur is the site of annual dance festivals around February, around the Mahashivratri. Major classical Indian dance form artists, as well as regional teams, perform their repertoire at this Brahan Natyanjali festival over 10 days.Brahan Natyanjali, Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu =Car festival= The Temple car was rolled out on its trial run from opposite to Sri Ramar temple on 20 April 2015 witnessed by a large number of people.Trial run of Big Temple car, Rolls; out after 100 years; maiden run on April 29, The Hindu, 21 April 2015 Nine days later, the maiden procession of the temple car was held. This was the first such procession in this temple held in the past hundred years, according to news reports.Big temple chariot festival held after 100 years, The Hindu, 30 April 2015 =Novels= Kalki Krishnamurthy, a renowned Tamil novelist, has written a historical novel named Ponniyin Selvan, based on the life of Raja Raja Chola I. Balakumaran, another Tamil author has written a novel named Udaiyar themed on the life of Raja Raja Chola I and the construction of the temple.  Administration  The temple is currently administered and managed by Babaji Bhonsle, the head of the Thanjavur Maratha royal family. He serves as the hereditary trustee of the palace Devasthanam which continues to manage 88 Chola temples including the Brihadeeswara temple. Tamil groups have been unsuccessfully petitioning the Tamil Nadu government to revoke these rights as he is not of Chola or Tamil lineage. According to one of the protesters, who also happens to be the coordinator of the Big Temple Rights Retrieval Committee, Babaji Bhonsle is also not the legal heir of the Maratha kings of Thanjavur.

The history of the clan from the mid- nineteenth century, represent the social structures of the chiefly system, religion and western culture that supported colonialism in Fiji. Tradition, Christianity and British indirect rule were combined to legitimize what was accepted as the right way to govern. Condemned by some modern day critics as exploitative, the Fijian chiefly system was the medium of native social interdependence and a traditional contract shared by the indigenous clans of pre-colonial Fiji, that was utilized for colonial rule.Colin Newbury,'History Heumaneutics and Fijian Ethnic 'Paramountcy',The Journal of Pacific History,46:1, Jun 2011,pp.27‚Äì57. Since Independence the chiefly system has had to adapt to the demands of modernity. Anthropologist Arthur Capell in his study of early tribal migration within Fiji made the point that, \\"the history of Fiji is the history of chiefly families.\\"A. Capell, Oceania, \\"Local Divisions and Movement in Fiji\\", Vol X1 No. 4, Jun 1941, p.327. The phrase in fact emphasized the hierarchical nature of Fijian traditional society where chiefly power was held sacred. The relationship between Chiefs and Westerners in especially Missionaries thus became a focal point for gathering insight into Fijian culture and tradition in the nineteenth century. James Turner a latter anthropologist found, \\"The chiefly families of Nairukuruku were the first in the eastern highlands of Viti Levu to declare their allegiance to the central government and as a result of this support their influence expanded throughout the area\\".James W Turner, \\"The Sins of the Father: Rank and Succession in a Fijian Chiefdom\\", Oceania, 57:2, December 1986, p.128.

The Taukei ni Waluvu traditionally is the leading chief of the chiefdom of Nabena, Matailobau District that originally consisted of twelve tribes, in Naitasiri Province. Turner, observed the cultural transformation, where, the high chief of Nabena is not removed from his subjects, but sits in a more egalitarian rather than a hierarchical village structure. An outsider's initial impression is that he is primus inter pares in his district.Turner, 1986:129. Matailobau District being one of the Pre-Colonial States of Eastern Viti Levu Island and formerly of Colo East hill province.Fiji Museum, Publication Domodomo, 1984 Vol. 2, No.4. In 1945 Colo East merged with Naitasiri Province. The other Eastern Viti Levu Pre-Colonial States being Verata, Waimaro, Bau, Rewa, Naitasiri and Namosi.Fiji Museum Publication, Domodomo, 1986 Vol 4, No.3 . Ratu Seru Apenisa Cakobau Vunivalu of Bau 1852‚Äì1883 In September 1862, zealous Methodist missionary Reverend Frederick Langham, had journeyed via Nalawa District Ra, up the Wainimala river headwaters of Viti Levu to Nakorosule-Waimaro. He was advised by the Nakorosule chief, Rotavisoro who was also the nephew of the Taukei ni Waluvu, that traditional protocol necessitated his uncle Rodavetanivalu, known then as the Taukei Waiburebure of Navaulele be first converted. Reverend Wallace Deane recounted the Nakorosule chief saying, \\"If I embrace the religion which you bring, my relatives will be angry with me. My advice is: go to the Taukei Waiburebure at Navaulele. He is my chiefly uncle. If he desires the Lotu (religion), I will accept it also.\\" Rev W Deane, The Strange Adventures of a Whales Tooth, p. 127 Perhaps Henderson's observation is appropriate, to understanding Rotavisoro's dilemma, \\"any leading chief who embraced Christianity in Fiji at this time took upon himself great risks. His authority was based to some extent on his efficiency, especially in war; but more on his supposed descent from the gods whom the people propitiated and feared. By severing his connexion with the old gods he cut the ground from under his feet, and struck a blow at the authority of every other chief in Fiji which they would not be slow to resent.\\"G. C. Henderson, Fiji and the Fijians 1835‚Äì1856, Angus and Robertson, 1931, pp.265‚Äì266. As documented in Fiji Methodist history, Ratu Meli Rodavetanivalu II accepted the Lotu and became a nominal Christian through Langham on 14 September 1862 and was later baptized in 1867 by Reverend Thomas Baker on his fateful journey to Navosa. Bauan kinship politics through the Tui Nalawa was instrumental in the Taukei ni Waluvu's conversion. Reverend Deane in recounting this episode stated \\"The 'Native of the Flood' was not proof against the high honours placed upon him by Cakobau, and after a long talk with his councillors, agreed to receive the Gospel in a nominal way an act that was fraught with gravest calamity and greatest blessing for his people.\\"Rev W Deane, The Strange Adventures of a Whale's Tooth, p. 128 Deane then continued in some detail 'The Native of the Flood,' acting at once, gathered the people of his own together, and told them of his decision. His word was, of course, practically supreme, and after hearing what he had to say, they shouted their approval with loud voices and allowed the Gospel into their midst.\\" Tradition records that Ratu Seru Cakobau, the Vunivalu of Bau and Tui Viti, honoured Rodavetanivalu II, Vunivalu of Navaulele for being a staunch ally of his Christianization and pacification campaigns of the hill tribes by conferring on him the title 'Native of the Floods' or Taukei-ni-Uwaluvu from his earlier title Taukei Waiburebure. In any case the title meaning remained the same. In the Bauan dialect the word for flood is 'uwaluvu' whilst in the Matailobau dialect it is 'waiburebure'. In April 1868, as recorded by Sir John Thurston, Ratu Cakobau in retaliation of the Reverend Thomas Baker massacre at Navatusila, launched a two pronged campaign via the Rewa river and the Ra coast with the Matailobau and Waimaro-Soloira tribes as allies.Deryck Scarr, 'I the Very Bayonet', ANU Press, 1973, 1971,pp.76‚Äì78. Reverend Frederick Langham c. 1890s. Physically impressive with leonine hair and beard, Langham believed himself the champion of the Fijians and encouraged annexation by Britain. Nicknamed the \\"Cardinal\\", he lived on Bau Island from 1861 where he won repute among colonists as Cakobau's adviser. In a cabinet memorandum from King Cakobau's private secretary Henry Milne to his Minister of Native Affairs, Robert Swanston, lies further evidence of Cakobau's close relations with the Taukei ni Waluvu during the campaign. The memorandum dated 19 May 1873, announced, \\"The king is now at Matailobau, and has in conjunction with the chiefs assembled there, determined to go through Viti Levu. The Matailobau as you are aware are very old allies of the king.\\"Memo from the Cabinet to Hon Minister of Native Affairs, Vunisamaloa, Ba Province, 19 May 1873, Pacific Manuscript Bureau, Swanston Collection, Ra and Ba Military Campaign, Fiji, 1873. Australian National Library. Apparently Cakobau's traditional links to the Taukei ni Waluvu can be traced to the Vunivalu's ancestors, the Nadurucoko in Wainibuka and the Dewala in Ra. Milne's memorandum makes it quite explicit what Cakobau and the Taukei ni Waluvu's intentions were as was spelled out, \\"By the King's last letter(13 May 1873) the Honourable the Minister for Naive Affairs will see that it is intended to push through the hills and if necessary force all 'Colo' to submit to the general Government.\\" Cakobau's Christianization campaign or Valu ni Lotu was then mounted as recounted by Robert Nicole, \\"In 1873 the fledgling Cakobau government embarked on a campaign of subjugation in the north and west (especially Qaliyalatini, Naloto, Magodro, Yakete, Vaturu, Sabeto and Navatusila) and in the central and eastern parts of the interior( especially Nadawarau, Muaira, Waikalou, Soloira, Nalawa, and Nasau).\\"Robert Nicole, Disturbing History:resistance in early colonial Fiji, University Hawaii Press, 2011, p.18 Nicole continued, \\"With the capture and execution of numerous Colo chiefs during this campaign, interior districts to the East and North were severely weakened.\\" The campaign was effectively over when Nubutautau, stronghold of the Magodro fell on 11 September 1873 to Cakobau's forces.David Rutledge, Matanitu: the struggle for power in early Fiji, Institute of Pacific Studies, USP, 1985, p.176. In 1998, a meke -i- wau (traditional club dance) of Bukuya village in Magodro district in the Province of Ba performed for the Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka, recounted the Taukei ni Waluvu's tribal skirmishes in that part of Viti Levu's western highlands. According to Fiji Wesleyan church authority, the more exalted Taukei-ni-Waluvu title, now bestowed upon the chiefly patron of Wesleyan Christianity in the interior of Viti Levu, was metaphorical to the biblical account of Noah's divine commission prior to the great floods.Book of Genesis, Chp 6‚Äì9. Most probably, the title change by Ratu Seru Cakobau was consistent with Bauan tradition where honorific titles were proclaimed on warriors to signify chivalrous deeds. The Vunivalu of Bau is said to have embellished his ally's renown as the traditional rainmaker in preferring the title. In pre-Christian times such a power was credited to the Taukei Waiburebure. This mystical power is thought to still remain with the Taukei ni Waluvu today through the chiefly clan's bete (priests) of Nabena village.Fiji Times feature article, ' The Rainmakers', 29 July 2003. Commodore Goodenough in his journey up the Wainimala river to Nairukuruku on 21 January 1874, with Reverend Langham and Ratu Timoci Tavanavanua, son of Ratu Cakobau, met with [Ratu Meli], \\"the Governor of the twelve tribes of Matailobau, who was the first to Lotu in these parts.\\"Commodore J. G. Goodenough, \\"Memoir and Journal of Commodore Goodenough\\", Henry S. King, Co Ltd. London, UK, pp.218‚Äì219 The twelve tribes were made up of the old tikinas of Lutu, Waima, Matalobau and Nagonenicolo. Furthermore recording that the former heathen chief's, \\" left ear lobe is distended enough to carry a stick from one and a half to two inches in diameter\\". According to Brewster this disfiguring was the fashion of the highlanders where small prized articles were secured in the distended ear lobes.Brewster,'The Hill Tribes',1922,p.288. Ratu Meli Rodavetanivalu II had two sons Ratu Drekenavere and Ratu Isikeli. Ratu Drekenavere had a daughter Adi Vaciseva who was given firstly to the Tui Namosi, Romatanitobua as a bride though later married the Vunivalu Rara. Their issue, a son Ratu Ilaitia Baleinaivalu, was later Buli Lomaivuna. Ratu Isikeli was once Buli Nalawa in Ra Province. He had a son, Ratu Sailosi (1898‚Äì1932),raised on Bau Island as a youth, he died heirless. Ratu Meli hence did not have any surviving male issue. Legend has it, that, Ratu Meli had a canine pet named Tui Colo, which probably was a gift from Reverend Langham.http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A050067b.htme The black dog, possibly the first canine recorded in the hills, was a status symbol for the chief. Ratu Meli died during the measles epidemic that ravished Fiji and indeed the hill tribes from January to June 1875. Tui Colo was buried alive with his fallen master in his grave mound at Navunitavola-Navaulele. A probable Christian compromise to heathen burial rites where in former times, the high chief's wives would have been strangled to accompany him to the underworld. On Ratu Meli Davetanivalu II's demise, his elder brother Ratu Manasa Davetanivalu and younger brother Ratu Viliame Batiratu and uncle Rovucago's descendants according to chiefly succession tradition have held the title Taukei ni Waluvu. thumbrightHigh Chiefs of Fiji 1880s.

The occasion is not certain. It is most probable the chiefs as Roko Tui's -head provincial administrators were invited by the Governor to celebrate either the Golden Jubilee of the Methodist Church in Fiji in 1885 or Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee on 20 June 1887.

Originally Tailevu and Naitasiri counted for one Province with Ratu Epeli Nailatikau as Roko Tui. In 1882 the Province was split in two with Ratu Peni Tanoa as Rokotui Naitasiri. In 1877 Serua Province was carved from Rewa Province under a \\"Buli- Roko\\" Ratu Kinijoji Gagabokola. Sir Arthur Gordon Fiji's first substantive Governor in establishing colonial rule from 1875 to 1878, had originally created 12 Provinces headed by Roko Tui's and two hill Provinces on Viti Levu- Colo East and Colo West headed by respective Governor's Commissioners.Deryck Scarr, 'A Roko Tui for Lomaiviti: The Question of Legitimacy in the Fijian Administration 1874‚Äì1900, ' The Journal of Pacific History, vol 5, 1970, p.4. In 1893 another Commissionership, Colo North was created from these two Colo Provinces and from areas of Ra, Ba and the Yasawa group.  History and ethnology  According to Adolf Brewster,(see Joske's Thumb), Commissioner Colo East 1884‚Äì90, and elaborated by Arthur Capell, the genealogies of the hill tribes tend to go back some eleven or twelve generations from the time of his research. Basil Thomson and Brewster had worked on a basis of thirty years to a generation. So granting it, the founder seems to in each case to have lived about AD 1600.The Hill Tribes of Fiji, p. 71 and Oceania:1941:p.324Manfred Kayser et al, 'Melanesian and Asian Origins of Polynesians:mtDNA and Y Chromosome Gradients Across the Pacific',Molecular Biology and Evolution 23 (2006),PP. 2234‚Äì2244. The Taukei ni Waluvu clan trace their ancestry to Rokowai who founded their tokatoka Natabutale lineage at Nakamarusi around 1600 AD.NLC Tukutuku Raraba, Yavusa Siko, December 1924. Rokowai's ancestry through his father, the high chief of Navunidakua is traced back to Robonowai, the son with mystical powers of Ranadi ni Namasia the daughter of the Tui Nalawa in Ra. Clan folklore tells that Rokowai, who was the insolent and audacious youngest son in the chiefly household, had to flee the village as his brothers led by Nayacakuru had hatched a plot to harm him. The young chief fled with members of the chiefly clan's bati, sauturaga, matanivanua and bete who were loyal to him. Their descendants still reside with the Taukei ni Waluvu in Nairukuruku and its older stronghold sister village Taulevu. The Taukei ni Waluvu as head of Yavusa Siko includes the mataqalis: Siko Natabutale (Nairukuruku), Siko Navunisalusalu of Taulevu village (Matailobau District), Siko Navunidakua of Naqara village (Waima District) and Siko Koroqele of Nakorovatu village (Waima District).

Behind them are densely thatched village buildings, and two groups of people sitting watching from a distance at Nakorovatu, Matailobau, 1881. Rokowai's older brothers were Nayacakuru, Rosauturaga and Rovakacodrowai. Rokowai's wife Kororava was from the Vunimoli clan of Waidracia village. Rokowai had five sons: Rokotokalau, Rorairuku, Rotabuwaiwai, Rocaginidaveta( no issue) and Iranaqarikau. Clan legend also narrates, that Rokowai's manna was manifested when a fire burnt only the thatching of his great bure without destroying its wooden framed structure. The Clans founding ancestor's yavu was thus bestowed the name Nakamarusi or \\"burnt thatching\\". Celebrated female author Constance Gordon- Cumming describes Nakamarusi on her visit to the village stronghold on 27 December 1875, \\"the village of Nakamerousi [sic] had attracted my especial admiration. It is perched on a steep bank, and looks right along a broad reach of the river to a beautiful mountain range.\\"C. F. Gordon Cummings, Home in Fiji, Pub. William Blackwood & Sons London, 1885, p. 108. The clan's movements is traced from Navunidakua (district of Waima) to Nakamarusi, then onto the hill features: Taulevu, Ulira and Navaulele respectively, and finally to present Nairukuruku. Rokowai's eldest son Iranaqarikau, had three sons: Iranabobo I, Naitege and Tabuadunaki. Iranaqarikau's wife was Ro Ligatabua from Nasautoka. Iranabobo I had four sons: Roraiova, Rovucago Naitege and Rokorainima. After Iranabobo his brother Davetanivalu led the clan from Taulevu. On contacting leprosy Davetanivalu handed over to his eldest nephew the son of Iranabobo, Roraiova the authority as head of the clan in early 1859. After Raiova's death during his Valu ni lulu campaign, his fourth son Ratu Meli Davetanivalu acceded to the title on the deaths of his uncle (tamana lada) Rovucago and his elder brothers, Ratu Manasa, Radibi and Robale in 1862. Navaulele and Ulira were the hill fortifications and pre-Christian villages of the Taukei ni Waluvu, situated just a kilometer due west from present Nairukuruku across the Wainimala river. From these two strategic locations, the clan's influence and power were projected into the Waimaro and Navitilevu tribal heartlands of eastern Viti Levu. Both these koro ni valu (war villages) were heavily fortified and sat surrounded by ringed dry moats to protect from other marauding and warring hill tribes. The other Siko clan's fortified village close to Nairukuruku of Taulevu where the yavu (bure foundation) of Natabutale is built, looks east into the Wainibuka and Verata heartlands. The chiefly clan had moved out of its hill fortification onto the Nairukuruku river plain after the conversion to Christianity by Reverend Frederick Langham of chief Ratu Meli Davetanivalu at Navaulele on 14 September 1862. As recountered by Reverend Deane, two Nalawa chiefs, Sogonaivi and Naqari who accompanied Rev. Langham played a part in Ratu Meli, the Taukei ni Waluvu's, conversion to Christianity. The relocation from Navaulele to the present spectacular Nairukuruku river valley was only possible in post Christian times after belligerent surrounding tribes shunning Christianity and colonial encroachment were subdued and converted. Taukei ni Waluvu, Roraiova , son of Iranabobo I, in his tribal wars known as the 'Valu ni Lulu', is credited for spreading the clan's power and influence throughout Tholo East, up to Vatusekiyasawa village on the northern coast of Viti Levu to include an alliance with the Tui Bua on Vanua Levu.Fiji Times Nailalakai,'Na tabua ni veitataunaki' 20 November 2012. The origins of this traditional alliance with the Tui Bua can be traced to the mythological tale of the Tui Uluibua and Ro Namasia na marama Tabusiga daughter of the Tui Nalawa in Ra. She apparently after drinking the mysterious waters from a waterfall gave birth to Robonowai ‚Äìthe great ancestor of the Taukei Ni Waluvu. Roraiova's son Roradibi was skilled in the use of musketry firearms that was a marked advantage over traditional hand weapons in these inter tribal skirmishes. By tribal migration movements and marital linkages the more prominent ancient hill tribes such as the Yavusa: Nasautoka, Navitilevu, Burenitu, Noemalu, Navatusila, Taladrau, Waimaro, Nabubuco, Nabukebuke, Nacobicibici, Dreketi, Rara, Viria and Vuna are traditionally blood linked to the Yavusa Siko of the Taukei ni Waluvu. Hence pre-christian names of renowned Vunivalu's such as Rovucago of the Noemalu tribe, Robatiratu of the Nabukebuke tribe and Roragoca of the Soloira tribe were all bestowed on generations of Taukei ni Waluvu chiefs known as vaka toka yaca. In pre-Christian days, the name of a chief was sacred and in later generations his name was only bestowed on a close blood relative.  Nairukuruku ‚Äì totemism, Christianity and political ascendancy  Nairukuruku Village in foreground, on Christmas Day 1875. Artist: Constance Gordon-Cumming (1837‚Äì1924). Looking south-west from Taulevu ridge with Wainimala river flowing from right to left. Highest feature is Nariko peak in left farground. Other features shown are Nacau and Ulira peaks in right mid-ground. Established a few years earlier after re-locating from Navaulele, the village is surrounded by a dry moat. The large bure within the village is the church. Notably two homesteads outside the village to the west are that of the native minister and Ratu Viliame Batiratu's residence by the river named yavu- ni- turaga levu.Today, with a population of 300, five mataqalis or clans reside together in Nairukuruku village. They are namely: Siko Natabutale (chiefly clan), Nawaita (warriors), Nabubuco (chief's elders), Nakorowaqa (heralds), and Navitilevu (warriors). The village of Nairukuruku, home of the Taukei ni Waluvu in the district of Matailobau, was inhabited around 1872. That year fighting had broken out between the converted Matailobau tribes and the tevoro Lomai Colo tribes causing this re-location from Navaulele. \\"Nairukuruku\\" ‚Äì translated means ‚Äì \\"an entrance\\", probably due to its strategic location into the highlands by river and by land. Moreover, the entry and spread of Christianity into the eastern highlands of Viti Levu from this village is well documented. After the conversion of Cakobau to Christianity in April 1854 an approach was later made that year to the Taukei Waiburebure, Iranabobo, by way of traditional ties with the Tui Nalawa on behalf of Cakobau for the Colo chief to accept Christianity. This approach or carasala is recorded in Matailobau history.See Fiji Times Nailalakai 20 November 2012 ' Na Tabua ni veitataunaki' http://www.fijitimes.com/story.aspx?id=217756 A second approach to Lotu was made in December 1859 by Rev Langham through The Taukei Waiburebure's traditional links to Viria, Lomaivuna to Roraiova, Iranabobo's son. On 14 September 1860, Roraiova launched his 'Valu ni Lulu' or Christian conversion campaign of the hill tribes with envoys being sent to Noemalu,Soloira, Nadrau and Nagonenicolo districts. Roraiova and his three sons, (Ratu Manasa Davetanivalu- his eldest son, Ratu Waisea Radibi and Ratu Alipate Baledrokadroka) lost their lives in these Christian conversion skirmishes from 1860‚Äì1862. Roraiova's brother Rovucago then replaced him as head of the Siko clan but was also killed in these Christian skirmishes in early 1862. Rovucago was replaced by Roraiova's fourth son Ratu Meli Davetanivalu who on 14 September 1862 officially accepted the cloth to lotu on Rev Langham's third approach to the Siko Natabutale tribe. A contending interpretation of the word \\"rukuruku\\" is taken from the native indigenous Naga religious cult with that of bygone ceremonies.A. Brewester, The Hill Tribes of Fiji, p. 95 The cult of Visina corresponded with that of Baal and Rukuruku with Ashtoreth, the ancient deities signifying the creative and the productive powers of nature ‚Äì e.g. ruku (the feminine) and sina (native spear grass) the masculine symbol. Thus the name Nairukuruku has a relationship and significance to the clans creative totemic symbols towards the feminine fertility. The chiefly clan's totemic plant and animal, the Vico ‚Äì native spear grass and the Vo loa ‚Äì black mud fish is the living heathen symbols to the tribes masculinity and warrior class. Traditionally the Yavusa Siko is bati and protectors of the feminine totemic tribes representing fertility such as the Waimaro clan of the eastern highlands. The Siko Natabutale clan's treasured feminine Radiniwaimaro statuette in Taulevu village attests to this.A Brewester, The Hill Tribes of FijiRev. W. Deane, \\"Fijian society; or, The sociology and psychology of the Fijians\\", 1921, Chap VII pp 69‚Äì71. Deed of Cession Commissioner Commodore G. J. Goodenoughhttp://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A040297b.htm and Reverend Frederick Langham also visited Nairukuruku on 21‚Äì22 January 1874 which was then the foremost Christianized village in the upper Wainimala river of Colo East. At Nairukuruku Goodenough makes a proclamation prohibiting white settlers the use of native Fijians especially the belligerent 'Kai Colos' as plantation slave labour. According to Siko Natabutale clan history Ratu Viliame Batiratu representing his elder brother the Taukei ni Waluvu, Ratu Meli Davetanivalu who was frail, was part of the Vunivalu of Bau, Ratu Seru Cakobau's entourage to Levuka Ovalau for cession on 10 October 1874. As a village loyal to the new religion of Christianity and later central government, Nairukuruku was a potential target for attack by non-Christian neighbours resisting Cakobau's interference in their affairs.Turner, 1986:134 Nairukuruku became known as na Bau ni Colo or \\"the Bau (island) of the highlands\\" due to its rise as the seat of political power. It became the call centre for all colonial visitors into the eastern highlands of Viti Levu. Constance Frederica Gordon-Cumming(1837‚Äì1924). The first European females to visit Nairukuruku and indeed the highlands were writer Constance Gordon- Cumming and Reverend Fredrick Langham's wife Ann Elizabeth, who had accompanied the minister to the Christian enclave village where they spent Christmas in 1875.C. F. Gordon Cummings, Home in Fiji, Pub. William Blackwood & Sons London, 1885. pp 85‚Äì107. Ms Gordon-Cumming mused, \\"indeed we are the first specimens of the race whom they have seen!\\"C. F.

With these pre-colonial states the Taukei ni Waluvu also has the traditional veibatiki relationship which is still extant today. The clan name Bale drokadroka illustrates the tribe's warrior status.Bale drokadroka in Fijian literally means 'to fall whilst still green'. It is also a metaphorical phrase that means 'to die young'.A Capell , The Fijian Dictionary, Fiji Government Printers, Suva, 1991,p.60. The name in fact valorizes a young warrior that fell in battle; hence it is a name that belongs to warrior clans. A fallen warrior may have been known by another name but because he died young the word phrase bale drokadroka eulogizes his ultimate warrior feat- to fall in battle for the cause of his tribe. As recorded, Roraiova was renowned for spreading the clan's power through his valu ni lulu skirmishes against other hill tribes. He was the warrior chief that died young and is eulogised in Taukei ni Waluvu history. To valorize and honour Roraiova, his son in Taulevu who later took over the leadership of the clan, was bestowed the name Baledrokadroka in memory of his fallen father.Tukutuku Raraba Yavusa Siko, NLC, 2 December 1924,p. 106. Arthur Maurice Hocart the noted anthropologist from 1909 to 1914 did field research into the kinship relationships in the highlands of Colo East and Colo West. He studied the familial relationships of Nairukuruku chief and Taukei ni Waluvu, Ratu Alipate Baledrokadroka and the neighbouring chief of Nakorosule, Tui Waimaro and published what is known today as the Principle of Alternate Generations such as the Tako-Lavo relationship of the hill tribes of Viti Levu. Dr. Sean Sloan of JCU is the latest of scholars who in his case study of Nairukuruku Village explores the relationships among felt land scarcity, communal forces for equality, and tenure transformations in native Fijian villages. Dr. Sloan's case study is vital contemporary research into neo- traditional communal land issues that inevitably forces many villages to seek urban living.Dr Sean Sloan, 'You can only do that \\"outside the village\\": Envy, communal pressure, spatiality and accumulation of agricultural land around Nairukuruku, Naitasiri, Viti Levu, Fiji,'The Journal of Pacific Studies Vol.28 no.2, 2005. In November 1979 anthropologist Dr. James W. Turner conducted a 17 month field research into Fijian customs and traditions in Nairukuruku village. He published his observations in academic journals titled: \\"True Food and First Fruits: Rituals of Increase in Fiji\\", 1984, \\"Owners of the Path: Cognatic Kinship Categories in Matailobau, Fiji\\", 1986, \\"The Sins of the Father: Rank and Succession in a Fijian Chiefdom\\", 1986, \\"The water of life: kava ritual and the logic of sacrifice\\", 1986, \\"Blessed to Give and Receive: Ceremonial Exchange in Fiji\\", 1987, \\"A Sense of Place: Locus and Identity in Matailobau, Fiji\\", 1988 and \\"Rituals, Habitus and Hierarchy in Fiji,\\" 1992. In \\"Rituals, Habitus and Hierarchy in Fiji\\", Turner studied the Fijian hierarchical system in Nairukuruku through the social interaction where the Yaqona ritual is clearly implicated in the reproduction of hierarchy reinforcing the clans status.James W Turner, \\"Rituals, Habitus and Hierarchy in Fiji\\", Ethnology Vol 31, No. 4, Oct 1992, pp. 291‚Äì302. The Taukei ni Waluvu has a contemporary yaqona ceremony or meke ni yaqona vaka turaga only performed for a VIP on occasion. The verses are inter-changeable to suit the person in whose honour the ritualistic ceremony is being performed. Such a meke ni yaqona vaka turaga was performed for Prime Minister- the Honourable Laisenia Qarase who opened the new Vunidawa Hospital on 19 June 2002. The meke ni yaqona vakaturaga was composed and choreographed by Daunivucu Rokosuka of Taulevu village Matailobau.Copyright of Daunivucu Rokosuka of mataqali Siko Nawaita-Viria of Taulevu village, Matailobau, 2002.  Cakobau's Christian wars  One of the more clearly recorded of Cakobau's Christian conversion sieges was at Nasorovakawalu.A B Brewster, Hill Tribes of Fiji, 1922, p.64. Both Ratu Cakobau and Ratu Meli were present at Nakorovatu for the final assault on the heathen stronghold across the Wainimala river. Imbued with his government's Christianization agenda, Cakobau led 1500 warriors of Matailobau, Naloto, Lomaiviti, Suva, Sabeto Nadi and even students of the Methodist Training School, Navuloa Bau to lay siege on this last heathen hill fort in the highlands. In May 1873, the stronghold was finally given up after months of siege warfare. Brewster recounts, \\"Heralds were sent in with strings of Whales' teeth to soro or beg his majesty's pardon and sue humbly for peace.\\" Cakobau accepted the overtures as he thought his army had done enough for honour and glory.Brewster, p.65 A local Matailobau account stated that, Ratu Cakobau had ordered his musketmen perched up trees with Snider rifles to fire volleys simultaneously in support of the final eighth assault. In celebration of this victory the bure that was built for Ratu Cakobau at Nakorovatu was given the yavu name Na- ka- u- kaya (as I ordered). After this successful siege, in May 1873, a Christianization campaign or Valu ni Lotu was launched across the highlands of Viti Levu by Cakobau's Christian forces from Nakorovatu Matailobau which included the Taukei ni Waluvu's forces. Ratu Viliame Batiratu, The Colo Lieutenant Governor in Cakobau's Government and later the Buli Matailobau, with his tribal army played a supporting role in Major James Harding's Wainimala pacification campaign of Muaira, Noimalu and Nagonenicolo in 1874. The belligerant tribes of the Lomai Colo led by the Vunivalu of Noemalu, Rovucago, put up sterling resistance but were finally overpowered by well drilled soldiers. The Lomai Colo tribes then sued for peace. Ratu Viliame was to play a prominent role in the administration of Colo East province as the leading Buli or 'Turaga Levu' (Great Chief), from 1874 and resigning from government services in 1896 though remaining on the payroll until 1908.Turner, 1986:136. The measles epidemic of 1875 raised suspicion within the hill tribes of a foreign conspiracy given that they were still practising old native beliefs and ways. This event could be said to be the second chapter in the clash of cultures between Fijian traditional belief and western contact. Peace ensued when, on 28 October 1876, Governor Sir Arthur Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Baron Stanmore issued a proclamation pardoning all belligerent hill tribes, bringing to a close the third chapter of the clash of cultures ‚Äì one of tribal versus colonial rule in the highlands of Viti Levu. As a symbolic token of Batiratu's suzerainty, baskets of earth from the districts under his rule as Colo Governor prior to Cession from as far as Nailega on the Wainibuka river to Nagone-ni-colo on the Wainimala river, were brought to form the foundation of his great bure Vuravura at Nakorovatu.  Colo East merges with Naitasiri  When the Wainimala campaign of 1874 and the \\"little war\\" of 1876 in central Viti Levu were finished, Sir Arthur Gordon thought that the lately subjugated hill tribes, were scarcely fitted then for the rigidity of British Law. He therefore caused an Ordinance to be passed in the Legislative Council of the colony to provide for the jurisdiction of the \\"lately disturbed districts of Viti Levu\\", as the preamble put it. For administrative purposes the lately disturbed districts were divided into two provinces- Colo West and Colo East.The Hill Tribes of Fiji, p. 47 Colo North was later carved out of these two hill provinces and Ra, Ba and Yasawa provinces in 1893. Colo East was made up of the districts of Nailega, Nasautoka, Lutu, Waima, Matailobau, Soloira, Nadaravakawalu, Muaira, Nagonenicolo, Noemalu and later Nabubuco. Nairukuruku is the leading village in Matailobau District. Ratu Viliame Batiratu-the first Buli Matailobau chose to name his district, Matailobau in recognition of the clan who gave shelter to Rokowai ‚Äì the Siko Natabutale clans founding ancestor who fled the ancestral village of Navunidakua. Map of Colo Provinces, Viti Levu, Fiji. Scale: 1:517625 In 1945, due to colonial native administrative restructure initiated by Ratu Sir Lala Sukuna, Colo East province with nine tikinas including Matailobau and Vunidawa government station as its centre was merged into Naitasiri province. The two Wainibuka tikinas of Colo East-Nailega and Nasautoka were separately joined to Tailevu province. After the provincial merger five districts or tikinas of: Naitasiri, Matailobau, Waimaro Wainimala and Lomaivuna were created. Ratu Isikeli Roraqoca the eldest grand son of Ratu Viliame Robatiratu became the Turaga Buli Matailobau from 1945 to 1962 stationed at Nakorovatu village, Vunidawa. The only reminder of the Colo East hill province at Vunidawa today is the prominent stone memorial to its illustrious son and Taukei ni Waluvu Doctor Ratu Temesia Robonowai(1866‚Äì1937) atop the government station hill. The 1881 Gerrard Ansdell expedition of Colo East via the Wainimala and Wainibuka rivers is most revealing of all aspects of life in the hill province as many photographs were taken that is preserved in the Alexander Turnbull Library New Zealand today.see http://timeframes.natlib.govt.nz  Methodist Church ‚Äì Matailobau/Wainimala Division  The conversion to Christianity and allegiance to Bauan hegemony came at a price for Ratu Meli Davetanivalu II and his clan. Reverend Wallace Deane in The strange adventures of a whales tooth, gives a detailed account of the tribal skirmishes of the Taukei ni Waluvu from 1862 to 1874. For amongst belligerent heathen hill tribes, the Taukei ni Waluvu and his warrior people were a major influence in the spread of Christianity and British colonialism in the hills of the main island of Viti Levu. According to Methodist history, Reverend Thomas Baker, on his fateful journey spreading the gospel through the hills of Navosa in July 1867, passed through the Taukei ni Waluvu's Christian enclave on the east bank of the Wainimala river. In Methodist folklore, the tabua (whales tooth) sealing the plot to ambush Reverend Baker, had preceded him along the non- Christian west bank of the Wainimala river.Rev Elimeleki Susu, 'The history of Methodist Theological education in Fiji until 1973' Pacific Theological College, Suva, Fiji, 2009. The alliance that Ratu Meli made with Ratu Seru Cakobau, sat oddly with his 'bati' role to Verata and blood links to other hill tribes. However this propelled him and his clan as the leading Colo East entity for Bauan, Christian and colonial domination. Davetanivalu's stronghold village Navaulele then Nairukuruku thus became the seat of the Methodist church divisional superintendent for Matailobau/Wainimala division with a lay persons training centre. Previously the Matailobau division came under the Bau division. According to Rev. Deane, some of the Christian teachers from coastal villages who laboured spreading the gospel amongst the heathen tribes and paid the ultimate sacrifice for their faith at Navaulele were: Taitusi, from Nairai; Pita from Rewa, Rupeni from Dravo, Nafitalai from Namuka, Solomoni from Nakoroivau, Nemani, from Waikete, and Nasoni, from Buretu. Reverend Setareki Nasilivata of the warrior clan- Nawaita was Nairukuruku's first Methodist minister from 1914 to 1945. As a glowing credit to Wesleyan mission life and village advancement at Nairukuruku in 1884, Brewester observed > About four miles further up the Wainimala from Vunidawa was Nairukuruku, the > seat of Ratu Jona the native minister in charge of my province. He had a > small preparatory school where aspirants for the ministry received their > preliminary training. Order and discipline were combined with good native > customs and the students whilst being educated, were self-supporting, > maintained their own food supply and kept their houses neat and tidy. When I > got hipped and bored by the life on the station, I would frequently go over > to Nairukuruku and spend the day. Sometimes when Naval Officers and others > visited me I took them over there to hear the students choir sing Moody and > Sankey's hymns. We use to ride over and return by water for the sake of the > fun of canoe travelling, shooting the rapids and getting a pot at the ducks. > Ratu Jona's wife was an excellent cook, and generally regalled her guests > with savory dishes of chicken stewed with yams and shallots.Hill tribes of > Fiji, p. 148. Rev Ratu Jona Uluinaceva of Kadavu was native pastor of Matailobau circuit from 1881 to 1893. He was preceded by Rev Taito Rauluni (1876‚Äì1881) and Rev Rusiate Vunivalu (?-1875). Rev Jona Uluinaceva was succeeded by Reverends: Nasoni Tuisinu (1894‚Äì1903), Rev Pita Tuidela (1903‚Äì06) and Rev Filimone Waqaniveitaqavi (1906‚Äì?) respectively. Distinguished graduates of Nairukuruku preparatory school were Taukei ni Waluvu Doctor Ratu Temesia Robonowai (1866‚Äì1937) who was one of the first Fijian native medical practitioners in 1888, Doctor Ratu Jone Roraiova (1904‚Äì34) and Doctor Ratu Waisea Radibi (1901‚Äì32). In 1885, the fiftieth anniversary of Methodism in Fiji, a prominent contingent of Australian Methodists visited Nairukuruku to witness first hand the spread of Christianity in the highlands of Fiji. In addition to church festivities, they were treated to a spectacle of native dances and an insight into hill people tribal culture by the Taukei ni Waluvu and Buli Matailobau Ratu Viliame Batiratu.  Cultivation and Viti Kabani  In the 1900s, the surrounding Nairukuruku river plains were cultivated with bananas as the major cash crop. The village banana farmers became exponents of the Viti Kabani movement and the quest by its enigmatic founder Apolosi Ranawai for native indigenous commercial enterprise against the wishes of colonial administrators.Robert Nicole, Disturbing History: Resistance in Early Colonial Fiji, University Of Hawaii Press, 2011, pp.70‚Äì97. Ranawai had founded his Company at Nakorovatu, Matailobau where in 1912, as a carpenter he was building a church.Robert Nicole, Disturbing History: Resistance in Early Colonial Fiji, University Of Hawaii Press, 2011, p.86. Ratu Esira Rovucago V (1870‚Äì1934) of Nairukuruku was the secretary for the Viti Kabani in Colo East at the height of its popularity from 1913 to 1917. With the demise of the banana industry many villagers left to seek employment in the gold mines of Vatukoula and the tourism industry of western Viti Levu. Today subsistence market farming is the major village income earner with many families having left for urban living.  Mythological ancestry  Dr Paul Geraghty of the University of the South Pacific in his field research compiled and translated into English, mythological ancestry stories of certain tribes from parts of Fiji.As told by Saula Sauniucikau of Nabouva Village, Wainibuka, Tailevu, 1991. Compiled and translated by Dr Paul Geraghty, 'Na Lauqa Levu' Paper and its English Translation Paper, USP,Suva Fiji. Amongst his works, Dr Geraghty in tracing Fijian tribal origins meticulously recorded and translated the story of the 'Great Drought in the West of Viti Levu'. The story captured the birth of the great ancestor of the Taukei ni Waluvu ‚Äì Robonowai. He was the son of Ranadi ni Namasia the daughter of Tui Nalawa.  Title holder  As chief of Matailobau district, the Taukei ni Waluvu, Ratu Meli Koroitamana who replaced his cousin Ratu Alipate Baledrokadroka (1933‚Äì2005) was traditionally installed on 22 March 2008. He is a retired airport ground staff and sat on Fiji's Great Council of Chiefs when it was in operation. He is a former Fiji rugby representative of the 1964 tour of UK and France. Ratu Alipate was a pioneering Fijian scholar of the newly established Marist Brothers High School, Suva in 1949. He was one of the first Fijian students to matriculate in the Senior Cambridge exams in 1952 following his father Dr Ratu Jone Raiova (1904‚Äì33) footsteps, who matriculated from Marist St John's college, Cawaci on Ovalau Island in 1922, to the Central Medical School, Suva. Ratu Meli died on 7 October 2009 after a short illness. He has been succeeded by his brother Ratu Jese Romokidawa who presently holds leadership of the clan. thumbrightRatu Alipate MBHS Student 1949.

The choice of leadership through this exclusive traditional system is under pressure due to the changes in village life and culture brought about by modernity. Today's communal quest for development and good governance demands leaders have better education and high integrity.

Both States have history that extends for a millennia into the past. Iran and Iraq share a long border (the longest border by for both nations) and an ancient cultural and religious heritage. In ancient times Iraq formed part of the core of Persia (modern-day Iran) for about a thousand years. Modern relations between the two nations turned increasingly negative following the 14 July Revolution in Iraq in 1958, and subsequent overthrow of the Hashemite Monarchy which resulted in the country withdrawing from the Baghdad Pact. The Ba'ath Party gained power in Iraq in the 1960s, taking a more aggressive stance on border disputes. In the aftermath of the Islamic revolution in Iran in 1979, Saddam Hussein launched an invasion of Iran over border disputes and a desire to gain control of oil- rich areas in Iran's territory. The conflict lasted for eight years and ended in a stalemate. During the war, Iraq had used chemical weapons and violence against Iraqi Kurds and Arabs, who were accused of colluding with Iran.Human Rights Watch, GENOCIDE IN IRAQ: The Anfal Campaign Against the Kurds (1993) Annex C https://www.hrw.org/reports/1993/iraqanfal/ While Iran did not support the multi-national coalition against Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1991, it housed many Shia political organizations opposing Saddam's rule. The fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003 and the eventual rise to power by pro-Iranian Shia factions (i.e. Islamic Dawa Party and Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq) led to the normalization of relations between the two countries.Mottaki: No one can harm Iran-Iraq relations As of January 2010, the two countries have signed over 100 economic and cooperation agreements.Iran, Iraq have signed 100 economic agreements Since 2003, Iraq has allowed Shia Muslims from Iran to make the pilgrimage to holy Shia sites in Iraq. In March 2008, Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad became the first Iranian president to visit Iraq since Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution. Former Iraqi prime minister Nouri al- Maliki has made several state visits to Iran since 2006 and expressed sympathy with Iran over its nuclear energy program. Iran has since become Iraq's largest trading partner. Iran and Iraq are very close allies supporting each other against ISIS. The relationship between the two countries is strong in part due to the fact that both governments operate on a Shi'ite system of governance. Increasing influence of Tehran in Iraqi politics has led to civilians protesting the foreign involvement and presence of Iran-backed militias harassing and attacking citizens. Iran has an embassy in Baghdad and four consulate generals in Basrah, Sulaymaniyah, Erbil and Karbala. Iraq has an embassy in Tehran and three consulate generals in Kermanshah, Ahvaz and Mashhad. On 7 September 2018, Iraqi citizens set the Iranian embassy on fire as a part of a series of protests and arson against the foreign power seen as becoming too influential in local domestic politics. On 27 November 2019, Iraqi protestors burned down the Iran consulate. AntiquityAkkadian Empire= Sargon of Akkad (r. 2334‚Äì2279 BC) was an Akkadian king who conquered Sumer and was the reason of moving the power from Southern Mesopotamia (southern Iraq) to central Mesopotamia (central Iraq). Sargon's vast empire is known to have extended from Elam to the Mediterranean sea, including Mesopotamia, parts of modern-day Iran and Syria, and possibly parts of Anatolia and the Arabian peninsula. =Sumerian Empire= The Third Dynasty of Ur (2119‚Äì2004 BC), or 'Neo-Sumerian Empire' was a Sumerian ruling dynasty based in the city of Ur (southern Iraq). The Third Dynasty of Ur came to preeminent power in Mesopotamia after several centuries of Akkadian and Gutian rule. It controlled the cities of Isin, Larsa and Eshnunna, and extended from the Mediterranean (north Syrian) coast to the Persian Gulf and Western Iran. A salient feature of the dynasty is its establishment of the earliest known law code after the Code of Urukagina‚Äîthe Code of Ur-Nammu. During King Shulgi's reign, many significant changes occurred. He took steps to centralize and standardize the procedures of the empire. He is credited with standardizing administrative processes, archival documentation, the tax system, and the national calendar. The last Sumerian dynasty ended after an Elamite invasion in 2004 BC. From this point on, with the growing Akkadian presence in the region, the Sumerian language declined, after more than three thousand years of cultural identity, as the population increasingly adopted Akkadian. Future Babylonian Kings carried the title 'King of Sumer and Akkad', however, for some fourteen centuries to come. The title would also be claimed by Cyrus of Persia in the 6th century BC. =Assyrian Empire= The Neo-Assyrian Empire (934‚Äì609 BC) was a multi-ethnic state composed of many peoples and tribes of different origins. During this period, Aramaic was made an official language of the empire, alongside the Akkadian language. In the preceding Middle Assyrian period (14th to 10th century BC), Assyria had been a minor kingdom of northern Mesopotamia (northern Iraq), competing for dominance with its southern Mesopotamian rival Babylonia. In 647 BC, the Assyrian king Ashurbanipal leveled the Elamite capital city of Susa during a war in which the inhabitants apparently participated on an opposing side. A tablet unearthed in 1854 by Austen Henry Layard in Nineveh reveals Ashurbanipal as an \\"avenger\\", seeking retribution for the humiliations the Elamites had inflicted on the Mesopotamians over the centuries. Assyrian rule succumbed to Babylonia with the Fall of Nineveh in 612 BC. =Babylonian Empire= In the golden age of Babylon, Nabopolassar was intent on conquering from the pharaoh Necho II (who was still hoping to restore Assyrian power) the western provinces of Syria, and to this end dispatched his son Nebuchadnezzar II with a powerful army westward. In the ensuing Battle of Carchemish in 605 BC, the Egyptian army was defeated and driven back, and Syria and Phoenicia were brought under the sway of Babylon. Nabopolassar died in August of that year, and Nebuchadrezzar II returned home to Babylon to ascend to the throne. After the defeat of the Cimmerians and Scythians, all of Nebuchadrezzar's expeditions were directed westwards, although a powerful neighbour lay to the North; the cause of this was that a wise political marriage with Amytis of Media, the daughter of the Median king, had ensured a lasting peace between the two empires. Though Babylonia was annexed by the rising Persian Empire in 539 BC, the Sumero‚ÄìAkkadian culture of the Mesopotamians significantly influenced the succeeding empires of the Indo-Iranian tribes of the Medes and the Persians. =Achaemenid Iranian Empire= In 539 BC, Persian forces led by Cyrus The Great defeated Babylonian forces at the Battle of Opis, east of the Tigris. Cyrus entered Babylon and presented himself as a traditional Mesopotamian monarch, restoring temples and releasing political prisoners. Upon assuming power, Cyrus appointed provincial governors (the predecessors of the Persian satraps), and he required from his subjects only tribute and obedience. Following Cyrus's death, a brief period of Babylonian unrest ensued that climaxed in 522 B.C. with a general rebellion of Iranian colonies. Between 520 and 485 BC, the Iranian leader, Darius the Great, reimposed political stability in Babylon and ushered in a period of great economic prosperity. His greatest achievements were in road building, which significantly improved communication among the provinces, and in organizing an efficient bureaucracy. Darius's death in 485 B.C. was followed by a period of decay that led to a major Babylonian rebellion in 482 B.C. The Iranians violently quelled the uprising, and the repression that followed severely damaged Babylon's economic infrastructure. The first Iranian kings to rule Iraq followed Mesopotamian land-management practices conscientiously. Between 485 B.C. and the conquest by Alexander the Great in 331 B.C., however, very little in Babylon was repaired and few of its once-great cities remained intact. Trade also was greatly reduced during this period. The established trade route from Sardis to Susa did not traverse Babylonia, and the Iranian rulers, themselves much closer to the Orient, were able to monopolize trade from India and other eastern points. As a result, Babylonia and Assyria, which together formed the ninth satrapy of the Persian Empire, became economically isolated and impoverished. Their poverty was exacerbated by the extremely high taxes levied on them: they owed the Iranian crown 1,000 talents of silver a year, in addition to having to meet the extortionate demands of the local administrators, and they were responsible for feeding the Iranian court for four months every year. Iranian rule lasted for more than 200 years, from 551 B.C. to 331 B.C. During this time, large numbers of Iranians were added to Mesopotamia's ethnically diverse population. The flow of Iranians into Iraq, which began during the reign of the Achaemenids, initiated an important demographic trend that would continue intermittently throughout much of Iraqi history. Another important effect of Iranian rule was the disappearance of the Mesopotamian languages and the widespread use of Aramaic, the official language of the empire. =Seleucid Empire= By the fourth century B.C., nearly all of Babylon opposed the Achaemenids. Thus, when the Iranian forces stationed in Babylon surrendered to Alexander in 331 B.C. all of Babylonia hailed him as a liberator. Alexander quickly won Babylonian favor when, unlike the Achaemenids, he displayed respect for such Babylonian traditions as the worship of their chief god, Marduk. Alexander also proposed ambitious schemes for Babylon. He planned to establish one of the two seats of his empire there and to make the Euphrates navigable all the way to the Persian Gulf, where he planned to build a great port. Alexander's grandiose plans, however, never came to fruition. Returning from an expedition to the Indus River, he died in Babylon; most probably from malaria contracted there in 323 B.C. at the age of 32. In the politically chaotic period after Alexander's death, his generals fought for and divided up his empire. =Parthian Empire= In 126 B.C., the Parthians, a nomadic Iranian people lead by the Arsacid Dynasty, captured the Tigris‚ÄìEuphrates river valley. The Parthians were able to control all trade between the East and the Greco‚ÄìRoman world. For the most part, they chose to retain existing social institutions and to live in cities that already existed. Mesopotamia was immeasurably enriched by this, the mildest of all foreign occupations of the region. The population of Mesopotamia was enormously enlarged, Iranians, and Aramaeans. With the exception of the Roman occupation under Trajan (A.D. 98‚Äì117) and Septimius Severus (A.D. 193‚Äì211), the Arsacids ruled until a new force of native Iranian rulers, the Persian Sassanids, conquered the region in A.D. 227. =Sassanid Iranian Empire= During the time of the Sassanid Empire, from the 3rd century to the 7th century, the major part of Iraq was called in Persian Del-e ƒ™rƒÅnshahr (lit. \\"the heart of Iran\\"), and its metropolis Ctesiphon (not far from present-day Baghdad) functioned for more than 800 years as the capital city of Iran. Medieval eraAbbasid Caliphate= The Abbasid Caliphate of circa 650 A.D. was the second of the two great Islamic caliphates. It was ruled by the Abbasid dynasty of caliphs, who built their capital in Baghdad (Iraq). The Abbasids had depended heavily on the support of Persians in their overthrow of the Umayyads. Abu al-'Abbas' successor, al-Mansur, moved their capital from Damascus to the new city of Baghdad and welcomed non-Arab Muslims to their court. During the reign of its first seven caliphs, Baghdad became a center of power where Arab and Iranian cultures mingled to produce a blaze of philosophical, scientific, and literary glory. This era is remembered throughout the Muslim world, and by Iraqis in particular, as the pinnacle of the Islamic past. Modern eraPahlavi era= Since the Ottoman‚ÄìPersian Wars of the 16th and 17th centuries, Iran (known as \\"Persia\\" prior to 1935) and the Ottomans fought over Iraq (then known as Mesopotamia) and full control of the Shatt al-Arab until the signing of the Treaty of Zuhab in 1639 which established the final borders between the two countries. The Shatt al-Arab was considered an important channel for both states' oil exports, and in 1937, Iran and the newly independent Iraq signed a treaty to settle the dispute. In the same year, Iran and Iraq both joined the Treaty of Saadabad, and relations between the two states remained good for decades afterwards. The 1937 treaty recognised the Iran‚ÄìIraq border to be along the low-water mark on the Shatt al-Arab's eastern side, except at Abadan and Khorramshahr, where the frontier ran along the thalweg (deepest part of the river valley). This gave Iraq control of most of the waterway and required Iran to pay tolls whenever its ships used it. In 1955, both nations joined the Baghdad Pact. However, the overthrow of the Hashemites in Iraq in 1958 brought a nationalist government to power which promptly abandoned the pact. On 18 December 1959, Iraq's new leader, General Abd al-Karim Qasim, declared: \\"We do not wish to refer to the history of Arab tribes residing in al-Ahwaz and Mohammareh [Khorramshahr]. The Ottomans handed over Mohammareh, which was part of Iraqi territory, to Iran.\\" The Iraqi government's dissatisfaction with Iran's possession of the oil-rich Khuzestan Province, which the Iraqis called Arabistan and had a large Arabic- speaking population, was not limited to rhetorical statements. Iraq began supporting secessionist movements in Khuzestan, and raised the issue of its territorial claims at an Arab League meeting, though unsuccessfully. Iraq showed reluctance in fulfilling existing agreements with Iran‚Äîespecially after Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser's death in 1970 and the Iraqi Ba'ath Party's rise which took power in a 1968 coup, leading Iraq to take on the self-appointed role of \\"leader of the Arab world\\". At the same time, by the late 1960s, the build-up of Iranian power under Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had gone on a military spending spree, led Iran to take a more assertive stance in the region. In April 1969, Iran abrogated the 1937 treaty over the Shatt al-Arab, and as such, ceased paying tolls to Iraq when its ships used the waterway. The Shah justified his move by arguing that almost all river borders around the world ran along the thalweg, and by claiming that because most of the ships that used the waterway were Iranian, the 1937 treaty was unfair to Iran. Iraq threatened war over the Iranian move, but when, on 24 April 1969, an Iranian tanker escorted by Iranian warships sailed down the river, Iraq‚Äîbeing the militarily weaker state‚Äîdid nothing. (Joint Operation Arvand) Iran's abrogation of the treaty marked the beginning of a period of acute Iraqi-Iranian tension that was to last until the 1975 Algiers Agreement. In 1969, Saddam Hussein, Iraq's deputy prime minister, stated: \\"Iraq's dispute with Iran is in connection with Khuzestan, which is part of Iraq's soil and was annexed to Iran during foreign rule.\\" Soon, Iraqi radio stations began exclusively broadcasting into \\"Arabistan\\", encouraging Arabs living in Iran and even Baloch people to revolt against the Shah's government. Basra TV stations began showing Iran's Khuzestan province as part of Iraq's new province of \\"NƒÅ·π£iriyyah\\" (), renaming all of its cities with Arabic names. In 1971, Iraq (now under Saddam's effective rule) broke diplomatic relations with Iran after claiming sovereignty rights over the islands of Abu Musa, Greater and Lesser Tunbs in the Persian Gulf following the withdrawal of the British. As retaliation for Iraq's claims to Khuzestan, Iran became the main patron of Iraq's Kurdish rebels in the early 1970s, giving the Iraqi Kurds bases in Iran and arming the Kurdish groups. In addition to Iraq fomenting separatism in Iran's Khuzestan and Balochistan, both states encouraged separatist activities by Kurdish nationalists in the other state. From March 1974 to March 1975, Iran and Iraq fought border wars over Iran's support of Iraqi Kurds. In 1975, the Iraqis launched an offensive into Iran using tanks, though the Iranians defeated them. Several other attacks took place; however, Iran had the world's fifth most powerful military at the time and easily defeated the Iraqis with its air force. As a result, Iraq decided against continuing the war, choosing instead to make concessions to Tehran to end the Kurdish rebellion. In the 1975 Algiers Agreement, Iraq made territorial concessions‚Äîincluding the Shatt al-Arab waterway‚Äîin exchange for normalised relations. In return for Iraq recognising that the frontier on the waterway ran along the entire thalweg, Iran ended its support of Iraq's Kurdish guerrillas. Iraqis viewed the Algiers Agreement as humiliating. However, the agreement meant the end of Iranian and American support for the Peshmerga, who were defeated by Iraq's government in a short campaign that claimed 20,000 lives. The British journalist Patrick Brogan wrote that \\"the Iraqis celebrated their victory in the usual manner, by executing as many of the rebels as they could lay their hands on.\\" The relationship between the governments of Iran and Iraq briefly improved in 1978, when Iranian agents in Iraq discovered plans for a pro-Soviet coup d'√©tat against Iraq's government. When informed of this plot, Saddam ordered the execution of dozens of his army's officers and in a sign of reconciliation, expelled Ruhollah Khomeini, an exiled leader of clerical opposition to the Shah, from Iraq. Despite this, Saddam merely considered the Algiers Agreement to be a truce, rather than a definite settlement, and waited for an opportunity to contest it. According to Mohsen Milani, \\"From 1921, when Britain installed Faysal Ibn Hussein as the king of the newly formed Iraq ... until 2003 ... Iraq was Iran's most hostile neighbor.\\" Their competition was especially fierce after the 1968 Baathist coup and the concurrent withdrawal of British forces from the Persian Gulf region. Also in 1921, the British played a role in the 1921 Persian coup d'etat, which led to the rise of the Pahlavi dynasty as rulers of Iran in 1925. Reza Shah's Iran was in economic trouble, and he sought good ties with his neighbors in the 1920s‚Äîincluding Iraq. Iran and Iraq were staunchly anticommunist and pursued pro-West policies. They also cooperated in preventing the emergence of a Kurdish state. Iraq, supported by other Arab states, resisted Iranian influence under the Shah in the 1970s (which was backed by the United States as part of the Twin Pillars policy). This took the form of supporting insurgencies against the Shah in Khuzestan Province and Iranian Balochistan. The Shah, in turn, attempted to organize a coup against Saddam Hussein in 1971 and helped Sultan Qaboos of Oman quell an Iraqi-backed rebellion. He also backed a Kurdish rebellion led by Mustafa Barzani. In 1975, Iran and Iraq signed a demarcation agreement stemming from the Kurdish rebellion, which remained in stalemate. =Iran‚ÄìIraq War= The Iranian Revolution in 1979 drastically changed Iran‚ÄìIraq relations for 24 years. War broke out between Iraq and Iran in September 1980. Eight years of fighting left more than one million people dead and caused huge disasters for both sides, thereby grimly blistering ties between Tehran and Baghdad. The United Nations (UN) issued Resolution 598 in July 1987, demanding an unconditional ceasefire between the two nations. Both nations adopted the resolution ending the war in August 1988. =Post-war reconciliation= Although Iran condemned the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the former enemies reestablished diplomatic relations in October 1990; one month later, Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati visited Baghdad. In January 2002, one year before the U.S.-led Iraq War, the bilateral relations improved significantly when an Iranian delegation led by Amir Hussein Zamani visited Iraq for final negotiations to resolve the conflict through talks on issues of prisoners of war and the missing in action.\\"Iranian Delegation in Iraq for Talks on POWs, MIAs\\" , People's Daily Online, Retrieved 10 July 2013. =Post- Saddam= After the US-led war on Iraq started in 2003, Tehran strongly opposed the invasion, calling for a key role of the UN in Iraq's reconstruction. Iran then offered assistance to Iraq's post-war reconstruction and bilateral relations began to improve. In May 2005, a transitional government led by Ibrahim al-Jaafari of the pro-Iran Islamist Dawa party was established in Iraq. In mid May, Iranian foreign minister Kamal Kharazi visited Iraq and Jaafari paid a visit to Iran in July. In November, Iraqi president Jalal Talabani visited Iran, becoming the first Iraqi head of state to visit Iran in almost four decades. Iran‚ÄìIraq relations have flourished since 2005 by the exchange of high level visits: Former Iraqi PM Nouri al- Maliki makes frequent visits, along with Jalal Talabani visiting numerous times, to help boost bilateral cooperation in all fields. A conflict occurred in December 2009, when Iraq accused Iran of seizing an oil well on the border. Now, however, Iran has taken an increasingly salient role within the Iraqi government and security forces since the United States originally withdrew and ISIS rose to power. In Basra alone, there are numerous stories of Iranian militant factions harassing and kidnapping civilians. On September 7, 2018 several months of protest and arson erupted into an attack against the Iranian consulate within Iraq, where it was set ablaze by rocket fire. On 9 April 2019, a day after United States put Iran's IRGC in the list of \\"Foreign terrorist Organization‚Äù, Iraqi Prime Minister, Adel Abdel Mahdi said he had talked to all sides and tried to stop the American decision. In August 2019, Iran seized an Iraqi oil tanker in the Gulf and detained seven sailors for \\"smuggling fuel for some Arab countries\\". Iraq denied any connection with the vessel and claimed to investigate the matter. Commerce Mayor of Baghdad, Naeem Aboub (right) met with the Mayor of Mashhad Iran plays an important role in the Iraqi reconstruction. Iran's non-oil exports to Iraq were valued at $1.8 billion in 2007 and $2.3 billion in 2008. Each month, more than 40,000 Iranians visit Shiite holy sites such as Najaf and Karbala, buying religious souvenirs and supporting the economy through tourism. Iraq imports cars, construction materials, medicine, fruits, spices, fish, air conditioners, office furniture, carpets and apparel from Iran. Basra alone imports $45 million of goods from Iran each year, including carpets, construction materials, fish and spices. Each day, 100 to 150 commercial trucks transport goods from Iran to Iraq through the nearby Shalamcheh border crossing (2008). As of January 2010, the two countries signed over 100 economic and cooperation agreements. The volume of trade between Iran and Iraq reached $12 billion in 2013. The main areas of trade between the two countries are the construction, food and industrial sectors.

Built in 1858 by mason Cyrus Ramsdell, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 4, 1973. Description and history The Octagon House was based on Orson Squire Fowler's designs of octagon houses. Fowler thought that a round shape was conducive to better air circulation and socialization. The Hiram Ramsdell House has an eight-sided glass cupola over the central staircase. The first floor has five rooms around the core while there are seven bedrooms on the second floor. Cyrus Ramsdell occupied the house for 10 years before he sold it to his brother Hiram Ramsdell who lived in the house until his death in 1903. The house became apartments in the 20th century and fell into disrepair. In 1912, Wilbert G. Mallett, principal of the Farmington Normal School, now the University of Maine at Farmington, bought the house. On February 26, 2012, the owner of the house, Deborah Mallett Cressall, died, and her family offered the Farmington Historical Society the chance to buy the house at a steeply reduced price. The Farmington Historical Society was given until May 30, 2013, to buy the house and quickly began a capital campaign to raise $250,000 for the historic home's purchase. That money would also fund the renovations to the roof and drainage work. The Farmington Historical Society acquired the house in May 2013.

The film was directed by William Wyler and stars Margaret Sullavan, Herbert Marshall, Frank Morgan and Reginald Owen. Sturges' screenplay diverges significantly from the Moln√°r play, and later became the basis for the book of the 1951 Broadway musical Make a Wish.TCM Notes Sturges wrote a scene for a movie-within-the-movie, in which the leading man responds to the leading lady's impassioned pleading with the single word ‚ÄúGo‚Äù, delivered in varying tones. Plot Luisa Ginglebusher (Margaret Sullavan) has grown up in the Municipal Orphanage, delighting the other girls with her fairy stories. When Luisa is given a job as an usherette in a Budapest movie palace, the kindly orphanage director Dr. Schultz (Beulah Bondi), herself somewhat inexperienced, sends the young woman into the world with instructions to do a good deed every day and be friendly to everyone, as well as a little (off screen) advice about the male gender. When Luisa leaves work that evening, Joe (Cesar Romero) a handsome masher, tries to pick her up and refuses to take no for an answer, backing her into a wall and seizing her by the shoulders. She sees Detlaff (Reginald Owen), a waiter she met in the theatre, on the sidewalk, and tells Joe he is her husband. It works. Detlaff takes her out for sandwiches, and is charmed by her complete innocence. To give her a glimpse of the beautiful world he sees as a waiter in a fine establishment, he gives her an invitation to an exclusive party‚Äîand a dancing lesson, At the party, Luisa looks lovely in a dress borrowed from the theater; her complete ignorance of the world is played for gentle laughs. Thinking he is a waiter, she chides Konrad (Frank Morgan), a meat-packing millionaire, for sitting down with her. He is enchanted, but Detlaff is keeping an eye on his proteg√©e and interferes with the attempted seduction. When Luisa finally understands Konrad's intentions (when he scoops her up in his arms in the private dining room) she uses the same ploy that worked with Joe: She tells him she is married. When he demands to know the man's identity, ostensibly in order to give him a job, she picks a name from the phone book. Delighted with her good deed, she tells Detlaff that now she is someone's good fairy. When Konrad goes to the lucky man, poor but honest lawyer Dr. Max Sporum (Herbert Marshall), and promises a 5-year employment contract and a big bonus, Sporum thinks he has been recommended to the millionaire because of his ethical behavior, diligent hard work and integrity. In fact Konrad plans to send the \\"husband\\" to South America so that he will be free to seduce Luisa. Luisa goes to see Sporum and to tell him the truth. He thinks she is there to deliver the magnificent new pencil sharpener he has just ordered. They hit it off while he sharpens pencils with childlike delight, and she cannot bear to challenge his belief. They spend the day together, shopping for him. She persuades him to buy a bright-colored car and to shave his precious beard. He buys her a ‚Äúgenuine foxine‚Äù fur stole, the first present she has ever received. But when she tells him she has to meet a man at his hotel that night, he misunderstands and refuses to see her anymore. Detlaff is also furious that she plans to see Konrad again, but she must ensure Sporum's future. She calls Sporum on the phone and he is all apologies. She tells him to think of her as if she loved him. Konrad is furious at the sight of the foxine stole, which he says is cheap cat. He is also having difficulty continuing the Lothario scenario. Apparently his behavior was fueled by alcohol. Now sober, he wants to marry her and have children. Detlaff interrupts and literally carries her off, threatening to tell Konrad everything and ruin Sporum's new life. A chase ensues, and Konrad, Luisa and Detlaff end up in Sporum's rooms, where, weeping, she at last explains, more or less coherently. She wishes she were a real good fairy and could wave a wand and undo everything. Sporum soon recovers and he and Luisa are looking forward to a life of poverty together, when Konrad insists on holding him to his contract. Everybody competes for the title of ‚Äúgood fairy‚Äù. Cut to Luisa coming down the aisle on Sporum's arm, the star on her bridal crown gleaming, while the orphans sing ‚ÄúFaithful and True‚Äù.

Production The Good Fairy was in production from September 13 to December 17, 1934.TCM Overview During filming, director William Wyler and star Margaret Sullavan, for whom writer Preston Sturges had tailored the lead role, clashed frequently, with Sullavan walking off the set several times. When it was brought to Wyler's attention that Sullavan's work was better on the days when they didn't fight, he started to go out of his way to avoid clashing with her. Then, on November 25, Wyler and Sullavan eloped to Yuma, Arizona, and got married.Robert Osborne: introduction to the film on Turner Classic Movies (29 March 2009) Their marriage would last two years. There were problems between the studio, Universal, and the film's principals. Despite complaints that Wyler was taking too much time because of multiple retakes of scenes involving Sullavan, especially close-ups, Sturges was keeping only a day or so ahead of the shooting, writing new scenes and feeding them to Wyler to shoot \\"off the cuff\\". Eventually both Wyler and Sturges were dropped from the studio payroll. Filming had begun before the script had received formal approval from the Hays Office, which objected to some scenes and many lines in the submitted original, but allowed filming to start on assurance from the studio that changes would be made. The censors particularly objected to a scene in which the head of the orphanage explains the \\"facts of life\\" to Luisa before she leaves; to the attempted seduction of the girl by Konrad, the millionaire; and to there being a sofa in the room when Lu goes to Konrad's apartment. The Good Fairy premiered in New York City on January 31, 1935,IMDB Release dates in Hollywood on February 12, and went into general release on February 18. It was the first film to be booked into Radio City Music Hall without first being previewed. Reception In his February 1, 1935, review, New York Times critic Andre Sennwald found much to praise in the film : ‚ÄúWhen it is hitting its stride... (it) is so priceless that it arouses in one the impertinent regret that it is not the perfect fantastic comedy which it might have been...it proves to be an engaging and often uproariously funny work...it contains some of the most painfully hilarious merriment of the new year... For almost everything that is best in The Good Fairy, you may thank Mr. Morgan's lovely performance..Reginald Owen is quite perfect as the eccentric waiter. Herbert Marshall is less desperately crazy... but he manages to be entirely effective..Although Miss Sullavan is not the expert comedienne that her r√¥le demands, she is frequently able to persuade us that she is at home in a part for which she is temperamentally unfitted. The Good Fairy is so admirable that it causes this department to regret that it is not perfect.‚Äú Variety's assessment in the December 31, 1934 issue, was more critical of the film: , observing that ‚ÄúPreston Sturges has translated Ferenc Molnar‚Äôs dainty stage comedy for the screen, and has turned out a somewhat vociferous paraphrase. Slightly idealistic atmosphere of the original is missing, and in its place is substituted a style of comedy closely akin to slapstick... Picture is fairly peppered with closeups which, delaying production, brought U and the director, William Wyler, to the mat. These closeups are so beautiful that they seem worthwhile even if a bit profuse. Frank Morgan... makes his points rapidly and surely. Reginald Owen... is an excellent foil and contributes some telling pantomime. Sullavan is uneasy in the asylum opening as she does not suggest the child. Later she performs more surely.‚Äú In the April 15, 1935, issue of Maclean's, Ann Ross observed: ‚ÄúIt is all about an idealistic little orphan, Luisa, who ... believes that the outer world is simply the setting for a larger fairy tale, and when she suddenly finds herself actually out in it she is delightedly ready to accept sables, cheques and motor cars from a rich, middleaged admirer, looking on them as a fairy gift rather than as a basis for practical negotiation. The plot thus skates along very gracefully for an hour and a half over the thinnest possible ice; but in the end Luisa finds riches, happiness and true love without the sacrifice of anything but her time... a wickedly innocent little anecdote which delicately avoids giving offense.‚Äú Writing on March 6, 2012, Ken Hanke praised both Wyler's direction‚Äî‚Äúit makes you wish the man had turned his hand to comedy more often,‚Äù and Sullivan's ‚Äúcharming‚Äù performance in this ‚Äúscintillating, but not frequently screened, classic comedy‚Äù adding, ‚ÄúSturges‚Äô gift for blending the sophisticated with the simple, the cynical with the sentimental has rarely been better evidenced than it is here‚Äù. Leonard Maltin gives the film 3.5 out of 4 stars: ‚ÄúSparkling romantic comedy... Hilarious, charming; movie spoof near beginning is priceless.‚Äú As of September 2020, Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an 86 percent fresh rating. Other versions and adaptations Before being adapted by Preston Sturges for this film, the Moln√°r play was presented on Broadway, twice. Helen Hayes played \\"Lu\\" in a production that ran at Henry Miller's Theater from November 1931 to April 1932, for a total of 151 performances. A different production, at the Forrest Theater, ran from November 1932 to January 1933, with 68 performances. The play was also the source for the Deanna Durbin film I'll Be Yours in 1947, and Preston Sturges used his screenplay for this film as the basis for the 1951 Broadway musical Make a Wish, which had music and lyrics by Hugh Martin. Hallmark Hall of Fame presented The Good Fairy on NBC television in 1956. Produced by Maurice Evans and directed by George Schaefer, the show starred Julie Harris, Walter Slezak and Cyril Ritchard.

The poem is rooted the Virgilian georgic and Augustan literature; it is one of the first long poems published by Smart. The poem is literally about a hop garden, and, in the Virgilian tradition, attempts to instruct the audience in how to farm hops properly. While the poem deals with natural and scientific principles, there is a strong autobiographical tendency. While the poem marks Smart's classical and Latin influences, it also reveals Smart's close association and influence with Miltonic poetic form, especially with the reliance on Miltonic blank verse. Background In 1726, Peter Smart, Christopher Smart's father, purchased Hall-Place in East Barming, which included a mansion house, fields, orchards, gardens, and woodland; this property was influential throughout Smart‚Äôs later life.Sherbo p. 6 From the age of four until eleven, he spent much time around the farms, but varying reports of his level of participation during the day-to-day activities lead some to speculations that he sat out during most of the work and possibly suffered from asthma attacks.Mounsey p. 29 However, not all scholars agree that he was a \\"sickly youth.\\"Sherbo p. 12 Instead, there is substantial evidence to suggest that Smart spent his time enjoying the country side and immersing himself in the nature around East Barming.Sherbo p. 10 The Medway river that runs through the area was of particular interest to Smart as a young boy, and it is remembered in The Hop- Garden along with mention few of Smart's other poems. The first edition of The Hop-Garden, in Poems on Several Occasions, 1752, included plates from Smart's friends Francis Hayman and Thomas Worlidge.Sherbo p. 81 The original edition of Poems on Several Occasions, 1752, had 751 subscribers and sold 851 of 1,000 printed copies, even though it sold for ten shillings each. The Hop-Garden is split into two books totaling 733 lines (429 lines and 304 lines respectively) and written in Miltonic blank verse.Sherbo p. 84 It may have been expected that Smart would rely on Augustan rhyming couplets for his poem, even though Pope stated that Miltonic language might be inappropriate for a pastoral theme.Mounsey p. 65-66 However, Smart does not hide this fact; instead, he emphasizes it when he says: ::Under what sign to pluck the crop, and how ::To cure, and in capacious sacks infold, ::I teach in verse Miltonian :::(The Hop- Garden Book the First, 4-6).'' With these words Smart also introduces the georgic basis of the poem and that he would \\"teach\\" how to farm hops in order to use them to flavor alcoholic drinks. However, Smart does more than \\"teach in verse Miltonian\\" as he relies on various forms and styles to \\"express a variety of viewpoints.\\"Poetical Works p. 416 While the poem discusses farming methods, it also expresses a \\"'Patriot' hostility\\" to Walpole and the later Carteret/Compton administration of the British Parliament.Pellicer p. 406 The poem, in essence, is anti-Hanoverian, although he would later change this view. =Autobiography= The Hop-Garden is a personal work and contains many biographical references. One of such as his mention of his deceased friend, Theophilus Wheeler, who died at Christ's College, Cambridge, a year after starting.Sherbo p. 29 In particular, Smart was working on the poem when Theophilus died,Sherbo p. 33 and he dedicated a portion of the second book to his memory: ::THEOPHILUS, thou dear departed soul, ::What flattering tales thou told'st me? How thou'dst hail ::My Muse, and took'st imaginary walks ::All in my hopland groves! Stay yet, oh stay! ::Thou dear deluder, thou hast seen but half- ::He's gone! and ought that's equal to his praise ::Fame has not for me, tho' she prove most kind. ::Howe'er this verse be sacred to thy name, ::These tears, the last sad duty of a friend. ::Oft I'll indulge the pleasurable pain ::Of recollection; oft on Medway's banks ::I'll muse on thee full pensive; while her streams ::Regardful ever of my grief, shall flow ::In sullen silence silverly along ::The weeping shores - or else accordant with ::My loud laments, shall ever and anon ::Make melancholy music to the shades, ::The hopland shades, that on her bank expose ::Serpentine vines and flowing locks of gold. :::(The Hop-Garden Book the Second, 25-43) Part of the motivation to dedicating such a large portion of the poem to a discussion about Wheeler comes from his relationship with the writing of the poem; Smart showed an early version of the first book to Wheeler in 1743 before Wheeler's death. =Satire= In Chris Mounsey's biography of Christopher Smart, the fourth chapter is devoted to an examination of The Hop-Garden.Mounsey p. 64 However, this examination admittedly does not focus on the poem as a georgic, but emphasizes an Augustan nature of the poem, especially its potential as a satirical attack upon John Philips's Cyder (1708).Mounsey p. 64-65 By mocking the use of poetry for praise in the poem's epigram, Smart sets the stage for his work to satirize a previous work that indulged too much in a desire for praise, and, as Mounsey points out, Philip's Cyder was an earlier poem that shared alcoholic agriculture-subject of The Hop-Garden.Mounsey p. 65 The main point of criticism by Smart against Philip would be Philip's use of \\"Roman\\" farming methods instead of \\"up-to-date scientific methods\\". However, Juan Pellicer reviewed Mounsey's theory of The Hop-Garden as a satire and believed that Mounsey's chapter underestimated Philip's background.Pellicer p. 401 Furthermore, as Pellicer claims, there would be no need for a dispute to be made over farming methods, and Smart is instead writing a poem that complements Philip's instead of satirizes it. Philips, like Smart, had an intimate background with farming methods for their respective industries, and they both relied on scientific techniques that were shown to work in their respective communities.Pellicer p. 404 To view the poem as a satire would be incorrect, because \\"One should hesitate to consider agricultural methodology 'the nub' of Smart‚Äôs poem.\\" Critical reception Samuel Johnson, friend of Smart, joked about the poem as proof that \\"one could say a great deal about cabbage.\\"Boswell II p. 454-455Keymer p. 178 However, not everyone was as playful, and one of Smart's later literary opponents, John Hill, was one of the first to review The Hop-Garden; Hill used his piece in the Monthly Review to attack the poem.Sherbo p. 89 It was this review, even after Smart's reply in The Hilliad, that guided the future negative reception of the poem that Chris Mounsey describes as a \\"litany of abuse\\". Among Smart's biographers, the quality of the work is very debatable: Arthur Sherbo claims that the work \\"is remarkable for the poorness of the blank verse and the stilted Latinate quality of its language\\" while Chris Mounsey responds, \\"Possibly because of its complexity, allied to the fact that it does not meet with the expectations of most readers of Smart, the poem has hitherto been ill interpreted.\\" However, they both agree that the work provides valuable insight into Smart's earlier years and portrays nature and farming in a realistic manner.

The former ceased airing in 2002, and the latter was dropped from Noggin's schedule in 2005. Sesame Street Unpaved Series intertitle Sesame Street Unpaved features select episodes from the series' first twenty seasons. The 67-episode package includes every season premiere of Sesame Street with the exception of the season sixteen premiere. Each installment consists of a remastered version of an older episode, normally trimmed and edited to allow time for commercials. Episodes open with an exclusive title sequence created specifically for Unpaved, which depicts the characters on a busy New York street and was shot on-location in the borough of Queens. The package was partially marketed towards older viewers who would watch the program based on nostalgia. The first installment of Unpaved was produced in promotion of Sesame Streets thirtieth year on television. Unlike all other installments, it was created in a clip show format; scenes from a variety of hallmark episodes were featured instead of content from a single episode, and original footage starring five of the program's original cast members ‚Äì Loretta Long, Sonia Manzano, Bob McGrath, Martin P. Robinson, and Caroll Spinney ‚Äì was added as a framing device. These segments were written and produced by Josh Selig. Robinson (Mr. Snuffleupagus and Slimey the Worm) and Spinney (Big Bird and Oscar) were the only Muppet performers who appeared as themselves. Sesame Street Unpaved premiered on TV Land as part of its temporary Noggin programming block. Most later broadcasts on Noggin paired Unpaved with fellow Sesame Workshop series 3-2-1 Contact, making up a two-hour timeslot. 123 Sesame Street Title card 123 Sesame Street repackages episodes from the seasons 25, 30 and 31. Its title is derived from the fictional address of the franchise's titular location. Unlike Unpaved, this package was explicitly aimed at preschoolers. It was used as a way to introduce a new generation of viewers to older episodes that still managed to meet modern educational standards. Many installments of this package were incorporated into marathons and events consisting of otherwise brand-new content. 123 Sesame Street also debuted in 1999. Unlike Unpaved, it was never shown on TV Land and regularly broadcast twice a day on Noggin. When the Noggin channel was restructured in spring 2002, and many CTW programs were dropped from its regular schedule, 123 Sesame Street replaced all other airings of Sesame Street content (with the exception of Play with Me Sesame). The package continued to air until September 2005, about three years after Unpaved was removed. Development Plans to create Sesame Street syndication packages for Noggin had existed since April 1998, when Sesame Workshop and Nickelodeon first invested in the company. The Workshop initially considered repackaging Sesame segments into themed collections, rather than airing modified cuts of individual episodes. Herb Scannell (who was the president of Nickelodeon and TV Land at the time) suggested centering a package around Elmo, a breakout character whose popularity had peaked in the late 1990s. While describing such possibilities for an interview with The New York Times, he mentioned \\"[CTW] could do 'The Elmo Show,' for example.\\" ReferencesExternal links * * Category:American television shows featuring anthropomorphic characters Category:American television shows featuring puppetry Category:American television series with live action and animation Category:Sesame Street Category:Television series by Sesame Workshop Category:American animated television shows featuring anthropomorphic characters Category:Noggin (brand) original programming Category:American preschool education television series ","title":"Sesame Street syndication packages"},{"id":"18014058","title":"Ethnic groups in the Middle East"},{"id":"18014072","title":"Love Remembers"},{"id":"18014086","text":"Charlet is a French surname.

It includes several properties listed separately in the National Register of Historic Places, including the Abbeville County Courthouse and the Abbeville Opera House. The district was listed in National Register on September 14, 1972. Originally, it was roughly bounded by Seaboard Coastline RR, SR 72, Rickey, Haight, Hemphill and Haigler Sts. A 1972 decrease of area, roughly E of Magazine St., S of Whitehall St., NW along Long Branch St., W of Lemon St., N along Washington St., decreased the size of the district. According to the National Register Information System (NRIS), this decrease was approved simultaneously as the original district designation. A 1984 increase, of area roughly W along N. Main St. from Haigler to Livingston Sts., N along Greenville St., and NE on Marshall Ct., added to the district. History The district includes a large portion of Abbeville, the country seat of Abbeville County. The city, formed in the late 18th century, played a role in the political history of the area, including one of the first public meetings regarding succession from the Union, a precursor to the Civil War. Most of the commercial buildings in the district are representative of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, primarily due to three large fires in 1872 - 1873. The subsequent redevelopment gave the town square its present appearance. The original nomination form included sixteen sites that contributed to the historical significance of the district. These buildings included a mix of residential (ten) and commercial (five) structures, and greenspace (one): * Abbeville Press and Banner Building * Ace Hardware Building (1831) * Old Bank Building * Abbeville Opera House * Abbeville County Courthouse (1903) * The Burt House (c. 1830) * Secession Hill * Trinity Episcopal Church (1860) * Quay-Adams House * Wardlaw-Klugh House (1831) * Lee- Reid House (1885) * McGowan-Barksdale House (1888) * Gary-Harris-Wren House (1885) * Harris House (1886) * Gary-DuPree House (c. 1885) * Shillito-Townsend House (c. 1830) The boundary increase that occurred on May 7, 1984, added numerous properties to the district. The district now contains 37 properties of significance, 282 supporting properties, and 209 non-contributing properties for a total of 528 sites. Most of the structures are still standing, although the addresses used in the nomination form may have changed.

Built in 1855, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places on February 23, 1972. Description and history The Scott House stands on the east side of Federal Street, overlooking the Sheepscot River to the east, a short way north of the center of Wiscasset. It is a 2-1/2 story masonry structure, built out of brick with sandstone trim. A single wood-frame ell extends to the rear of the house, toward the river, where it is joined to a barn that appears to be 5/8 of an octagon. The main block is covered by an eight-sided roof with an octagonal cupola at its center, with extended eaves adorned with modillions. The main entrance faces the street, and is sheltered by a porch supported by four chamfered square posts and covered by a modillioned roof. Windows are set in rectangular openings, with small single- pane windows in the upper half-story that have rounded corners. The interior retains many original features, and remnants of others, such as a part of a dumbwaiter used to bring food from the original basement kitchen to the dining room. with The house was built in 1855, and was inspired by the work of Orson Squire Fowler, who promoted the design and construction of octagon houses, resulting in a construction fad in the 1850s and 1860s. It was built for George Scott, a Wiscasset native and successful ship's captain. A later resident was Edith Augusta Sawyer, an author of children's books.

On February 14, 1864, Davis's wife, Varina Davis, was returning home in Richmond, Virginia, when she saw the boy being beaten by a black woman. Outraged, she immediately put an end to the beating and had the boy come with her in her carriage. He was cared for by Mrs. Davis and her staff. They gave him clothes belonging to the Davis's son, Joe, since the boys were of similar age. When asked his name, he just said, \\"Jim Limber.\\" Although Limber's legal status was unknown at the time the Davis family took him in, he was likely the orphaned child of free parents, and Davis officially registered the child as \\"free.\\" It is unknown if Davis actually adopted him. There was no adoption law in Virginia at that time, so any adoption would be an \\"extralegal\\" matter. Varina Davis described Limber as a \\"great pet in the family.\\" Limber was with the Davises when they were forced to abandon Richmond before the Union Army captured the city in April 1865. When the Davises were captured by Union forces in Irwinville, Georgia, on May 15, Limber was separated from them. Some recounts of the story say this was due to a swift kidnapping of him by the Union Army, while other accounts say that the Davises recognized a Union general they knew well, Rufus Saxton. The Davis family never saw Limber again. Limber briefly lived with Saxton in Charleston, South Carolina, but was eventually sent north for education until he was old enough to support himself. Though it is mentioned in some of the more sympathetic biographies of Jefferson Davis that he never stopped searching for Limber, this search seems to be recorded only in oral history as it is not mentioned in his voluminous surviving correspondence for the last two decades of his life in which mention at all of Limber is fleeting. In 2008, the Sons of Confederate Veterans commissioned a life-sized statue depicting Davis holding hands with his son, Joseph Evan Davis, and Jim Limber. The statue was completed in fall 2008 at a cost of $100,000. The American Civil War Center in Richmond initially accepted it without guaranteeing to exhibit it. The deal quickly fell through. It is now on permanent display at the Beauvoir estate, Davis's last home in Biloxi, Mississippi. The story of Limber's time with the Davis family is told in Charles Frazier's novel Varina.

It is located mostly in the town of Harrietstown, but its easternmost portion extends into the town of North Elba. Description The Saranac River departs the lower locks below Lower Saranac Lake and flows northeast into Oseetah Lake. The river exits Oseetah at the north end of the lake and flows northeast to Lake Flower and Saranac Lake. Oseetah is also fed by Kiwassa Lake. Principal islands in Oseetah Lake are Wayotah, Wapiti, Watch, Haven of Rest, Papoose and Birch. Its shoreline is mostly privately held. It is part of the route of the Adirondack Canoe Classic, also known as the Ninety-miler, along with the Northern Forest Canoe Trail that runs from Old Forge, New York to Fort Kent, Maine. History Looking south across Oseetah Lake toward the Sawtooth Mountains According to legend, Oseetah was an Indian Princess. Upon learning the Indian chief she loved (Wayotah) was betrothed to another, she threw herself off a cliff into a lake and was magically transformed into a water lily.Donaldson, v. 1, p. 33. In the Huron language Oseetah means \\"Water Lily\\". Originally named Miller Pond, Oseetah Lake was formed when the dam across the Saranac River at Saranac Lake, that also forms Lake Flower, was raised to generate electric power by the Saranac Light and Power Company in 1894 (purchased by Paul Smith in 1904). At that time, as shown by maps of the period, a smaller pond, Ray Pond, also became part of the new, larger Oseetah - in what is now the eastern portion of the lake near the Essex County line.USGS.

In 1850 he married Harriet Primrose, and the couple had four children. Randall was employed as an itinerant carpenter, and worked on projects in Chicago and St. Louis and other places. In 1865, he retired to this location in Michigan, and took up farming. In 1870, he began building this house with help from local carpenters. The Randalls moved in two years later. William Randall died in 1882, and his land passed to his oldest son, Henry, and his wife Harriet. When Harriet died, her land and the house passed to the Randall's son Grant. He and his wife occupied the house until their deaths, after which the house was vacant. Description The Randall House is a two-story balloon frame octagon topped with a cupola, with a one-story rectangular-shaped gable-roof wing on one side. The wing is the original house on the property, incorporated into later construction. The house measures about forty feet long by twenty-eight feet wide. A flat-roof runs around seven sides of the building. Doors are on the north and west sides, and the windows are two by two double-hung sash units. The cupola windows are single Gothic style units. On the interior, the rooms are small, the largest about twelve by fifteen feet. The main floor contains a kitchen and attached pantry, a library since converted into a bathroom, and two parlors.

Most commonly, acquired diaphragmatic tears result from physical trauma. Diaphragmatic rupture can result from blunt or penetrating trauma and occurs in about 5% of cases of severe blunt trauma to the trunk. Diagnostic techniques include X-ray, computed tomography, and surgical techniques such as laparotomy. Diagnosis is often difficult because signs may not show up on X-ray, or signs that do show up appear similar to other conditions. Signs and symptoms included chest and abdominal pain, difficulty breathing, and decreased lung sounds. When a tear is discovered, surgery is needed to repair it. Injuries to the diaphragm are usually accompanied by other injuries, and they indicate that more severe injury may have occurred. The outcome often depends more on associated injuries than on the diaphragmatic injury itself. Since the pressure is higher in the abdominal cavity than the chest cavity, rupture of the diaphragm is almost always associated with herniation of abdominal organs into the chest cavity, which is called a traumatic diaphragmatic hernia. This herniation can interfere with breathing, and blood supply can be cut off to organs that herniate through the diaphragm, damaging them. Signs and symptoms Breath sounds on the side of the rupture may be diminished, respiratory distress may be present, and the chest or abdomen may be painful. Orthopnea, dyspnea which occurs when lying flat, may also occur, and coughing is another sign. In people with herniation of abdominal organs, signs of intestinal blockage or sepsis in the abdomen may be present. Bowel sounds may be heard in the chest, and shoulder or epigastric pain may be present. When the injury is not noticed right away, the main symptoms are those that indicate bowel obstruction. These people present months later, with vague symptoms that do not necessarily relate to an injury. Causes The injury may be caused by blunt trauma, penetrating trauma, and by iatrogenic causes (as a result of medical intervention), for example during surgery to the abdomen or chest. Injury to the diaphragm is reported to be present in 8% of cases of blunt chest trauma. In cases of blunt trauma, vehicle accidents and falls are the most common causes. Penetrating trauma has been reported to cause 12.3‚Äì20% of cases, but it has also been proposed as a more common cause than blunt trauma; discrepancies could be due to varying regional, social, and economic factors in the areas studied. Stab and gunshot wounds can cause diaphragmatic injuries. Clinicians are trained to suspect diaphragmatic rupture particularly if penetrating trauma has occurred to the lower chest or upper abdomen. With penetrating trauma, the contents of the abdomen may not herniate into the chest cavity right away, but they may do so later, causing the presentation to be delayed. Since the diaphragm moves up and down during breathing, penetrating trauma to various parts of the torso may injure the diaphragm; penetrating injuries as high as the third rib and as low as the twelfth have been found to injure the diaphragm. Mechanism Although the mechanism is unknown, it is proposed that a blow to the abdomen may raise the pressure within the abdomen so high that the diaphragm bursts. Blunt trauma creates a large pressure gradient between the abdominal and thoracic cavities; this gradient, in addition to causing the rupture, can also cause abdominal contents to herniate into the thoracic cavity. Abdominal contents in the pleural space interfere with breathing and cardiac activity. They can interfere with the return of blood to the heart and prevent the heart from filling effectively, reducing cardiac output. If ventilation of the lung on the side of the tear is severely inhibited, hypoxemia (low blood oxygen) results. Usually the rupture is on the same side as an impact. A blow to the side is three times more likely to cause diaphragmatic rupture than a blow to the front. Diagnosis Initially, diagnosis can be difficult, especially when other severe injuries are present; thus the condition is commonly diagnosed late. Chest X-ray is known to be unreliable in diagnosing diaphragmatic rupture; it has low sensitivity and specificity for the injury. Often another injury such as pulmonary contusion masks the injury on the X-ray film. Half the time, initial X-rays are normal; in most of those that are not, hemothorax or pneumothorax is present. However, there are signs detectable on X-ray films that indicate the injury. On an X-ray, the diaphragm may appear higher than normal. Gas bubbles may appear in the chest, and the mediastinum may appear shifted to the side. A nasogastric tube from the stomach may appear on the film in the chest cavity; this sign is pathognomonic for diaphragmatic rupture, but it is rare. A contrast medium that shows up on X-ray can be inserted through the nasogastric tube to make a diagnosis. The X-ray is better able to detect the injury when taken from the back with the patient upright, but this is not usually possible because the patient is usually not stable enough; thus it is usually taken from the front with the patient lying supine. Positive pressure ventilation helps keep the abdominal organs from herniating into the chest cavity, but this also can prevent the injury from being discovered on an X-ray. File:Diaphragmatic-rupture dog.jpgDiaphragmatic rupture in a dog File:Diaphragmatic rupture spleen herniation.jpgDiaphragmatic rupture with spleen herniation Computed tomography has an increased accuracy of diagnosis over X-ray, but no specific findings on a CT scan exist to establish a diagnosis. Although CT scanning increases chances that diaphragmatic rupture will be diagnosed before surgery, the rate of diagnosis before surgery is still only 31‚Äì43.5%. Another diagnostic method is laparotomy, but this misses diaphragmatic ruptures up to 15% of the time. Often diaphragmatic injury is discovered during a laparotomy that was undertaken because of another abdominal injury. Because laparotomies are more common in those with penetrating trauma than compared to those who experienced a blunt force injury, diaphragmatic rupture is found more often in these persons. Thoracoscopy is more reliable in detecting diaphragmatic tears than laparotomy and is especially useful when chronic diaphragmatic hernia is suspected. =Location= Between 50 and 80% of diaphragmatic ruptures occur on the left side. It is possible that the liver, which is situated in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, cushions the diaphragm. However, injuries occurring on the left side are also easier to detect in X-ray films. Half of diaphragmatic ruptures that occur on the right side are associated with liver injury. Injuries occurring on the right are associated with a higher rate of death and more numerous and serious accompanying injuries. Bilateral diaphragmatic rupture, which occurs in 1‚Äì2% of ruptures, is associated with a much higher death rate (mortality) than injury that occurs on just one side. Treatment Since the diaphragm is in constant motion with respiration, and because it is under tension, lacerations will not heal on their own. Surgery is needed to repair a torn diaphragm. Most of the time, the injury is repaired during laparotomy. Other injuries, such as hemothorax, may present a more immediate threat and may need to be treated first if they accompany diaphragmatic rupture. Video-assisted thoracoscopy may be used. Prognosis In most cases, isolated diaphragmatic rupture is associated with good outcome if it is surgically repaired. The death rate (mortality) for diaphragmatic rupture after blunt and penetrating trauma is estimated to be 15‚Äì40% and 10‚Äì30% respectively, but other injuries play a large role in determining outcome. =Complications= A significant complication of diaphragmatic rupture is traumatic diaphragmatic herniation: organs such as the stomach that herniate into the chest cavity and may be strangulated, losing their blood supply. Herniation of abdominal organs is present in 3‚Äì4% of people with abdominal trauma who present to a trauma center. Epidemiology Diaphragmatic injuries are present in 1‚Äì7% of people with significant blunt trauma and an average of 3% of abdominal injuries. A high body mass index may be associated with a higher risk of diaphragmatic rupture in people involved in vehicle accidents. It is rare for the diaphragm alone to be injured, especially in blunt trauma; other injuries are associated in as many as 80‚Äì100% of cases. In fact, if the diaphragm is injured, it is an indication that more severe injuries to organs may have occurred. Thus, the mortality after a diagnosis of diaphragmatic rupture is 17%, with most deaths due to lung complications. Common associated injuries include head injury, injuries to the aorta, fractures of the pelvis and long bones, and lacerations of the liver and spleen. Associated injuries occur in over three quarters of cases. History Ambroise Par√© In 1579, Ambroise Par√© made the first description of diaphragmatic rupture, in a French artillery captain who had been shot eight months before his death from complications of the rupture. Using autopsies, Par√© also described diaphragmatic rupture in people who had suffered blunt and penetrating trauma. Reports of diaphragmatic herniation due to injury date back at least as far as the 17th century. Petit was the first to establish the difference between acquired and congenital diaphragmatic hernia, which results from a congenital malformation of the diaphragm. In 1888, Naumann repaired a hernia of the stomach into the left chest that was caused by trauma.

A. (2002) Early T√ºrks: Sketches of history and ideology, Almaty. p. 144 However, according to historian V. Minorsky, the ancient Turkic form of the name was indeed Qalaj (or Qalach), but the Turkic /q/ changed to /kh/ in Arabic sources (Qalaj > Khalaj). Minorsky added: \\"Qalaj could have a parallel form *Ghalaj.\\" This word yielded Gh…ôljƒ´ in Pashto, which was used for the Pashtun Ghilji tribe centered around Ghazni and Qalati Ghilji. Origin A sketch of the fortress in Qalati Ghilji, Afghanistan (1868) Ilhanate's statesman and historian Rashid-al-Din Hamadani mentions the Khalaj tribe in his Jami' al-tawarikh as part of the Oghuz (Turkmen) people: \\"Over time, these peoples were divided into numerous clans, [and indeed] in every era [new] subdivisions arose from each division, and each for a specific reason and occasion received its name and nickname, like the Oghuz, who are now generally called the Turkmens [Turkman], they are also divided into Kipchaks, Kalach, Kanly, Karluk and other tribes related to them \\". However, some historians, including 20th-century Josef Markwart and 10th-century al-Khwarizmi, consider the Khalaj to be remnants of the Hephthalite confederacy, therefore originally Iranians.  M. A. Shaban, \\"Khurasan at the Time of the Arab Conquest\\", in Iran and Islam, in memory of Vlademir Minorsky, Edinburgh University Press, (1971), p481; .\\"The White Huns ‚Äì The Hephthalites\\", Silk RoadEnoki Kazuo, \\"On the nationality of White Huns\\", 1955 The Khalaj might have later been incorporated into the Western Turkic khaganate, as H√®lu√≥shƒ´ (Ë≥ÄÁæÖÊñΩ), mentioned besides T√ºrgesh (T≈´q√≠shƒ´ Á™ÅÈ®éÊñΩ), before regaining independence after the collapses of the Western Turkic and the T√ºrgesh khaganates. Groups of the Khalaj people migrated into Persia beginning with the invasions of the Seljuq Turks, during the 11th century. From there, a branch of them migrated to the Azerbaijan region, where they supposedly picked up greater Turkic influence in their language. However, the Khalaj are very few in Iranian Azerbaijanis today. Sometime shortly prior to the time of Timur (1336-1405), a branch of Khalaj migrated to the area southwest of Saveh in the Markazi Province, which is where a large branch of the Khalaj are located today. However, today, the Khalaj people also identify as Persians despite still speaking their local Turkic language. This is due to undergoing processes of Persianization starting in the mid 20th century. Discussing their relationship with Karluks, Minorsky and Golden noted that the Khalaj and Karluks were often confused by medieval Muslim authors, as their names were transcribed almost similarly in Arabic.Golden, Peter B. (1992). An Introduction to the History of the Turkic People. Otto Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden. p. 387 Even so, KitƒÅb al-MasƒÅlik w‚Äôal- MamƒÅlik's author Ibn Khordadbeh distinguished Khalajs from Karluks, though he mentioned that both groups lived beyond the Syr Darya of the Talas; Muhammad ibn Najib Bakran wrote in his JihƒÅn-nƒÅma (c. 1200-20) that \\"by mistake (in writing) the people called the Khallukh Khalaj.\\"Minorsky, V. \\"Commentary\\" on \\"¬ß15.

Mid-10th-century book Hudud al-'Alam described the Khalaj as sheep-grazing nomads in Ghazni and the surrounding districts, who had a habit of wandering through seasonal pastures. 11th-century book Tarikh Yamini, written by al-Utbi, stated that when the Ghaznavid Emir Sabuktigin defeated the Hindu Shahi ruler Jayapala in 988, the Khalaj and Pashtuns (Afghans) between Laghman and Peshawar, the territory he conquered, surrendered and agreed to serve him. Al-Utbi further stated that Khalaj and Pashtun tribesmen were recruited in significant numbers by the Ghaznavid Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni (999‚Äì1030) to take part in his military conquests, including his expedition to Tokharistan.R. Khanam, Encyclopaedic ethnography of Middle-East and Central Asia: P-Z, Volume 3 - Page 18 The Khalaj later revolted against Mahmud's son Sultan Mas'ud I of Ghazni (1030‚Äì1040), who sent a punitive expedition to obtain their submission. In 1197, Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khalji, a Khalaj general from Garmsir, Helmand in the army of the Ghurid Sultan Muhammad of Ghor, captured Bihar in India, and then became the ruler of Bengal, beginning the Khalji dynasty of Bengal (1204-1227). During the time of the Mongol invasion of Khwarezmia, many Khalaj and Turkmens gathered in Peshawar and joined the army of Saif al-Din Ighraq, who was likely a Khalaj himself. This army defeated the petty king of Ghazni, Radhi al-Mulk. The last Khwarazmian ruler, Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu, was forced by the Mongols to flee towards the Hindu Kush. Ighraq's army, as well as many other Khalaj and other tribesmen, joined the Khwarazmian force of Jalal ad-Din and inflicted a crushing defeat on the Mongols at the 1221 Battle of Parwan. However, after the victory, the Khalaj, Turkmens, and Ghoris in the army quarreled with the Khwarazmians over the booty, and finally left, soon after which Jalal ad-Din was defeated by Genghis Khan at the Battle of the Indus and forced to flee to India. Ighraq returned to Peshawar, but later Mongol detachments defeated the 20,000‚Äì30,000 strong Khalaj, Turkmen, and Ghori tribesmen who had abandoned Jalal ad-Din. Some of these tribesmen escaped to Multan and were recruited into the army of the Delhi Sultanate.Chormaqan Noyan: The First Mongol Military Governor in the Middle East by Timothy May Jalal-ud-din Khalji (1290-1296), who belonged to the Khalaj tribe from Qalati Khalji, founded the Khalji dynasty, which replaced the Mamluks and became the second dynasty to rule the Delhi Sultanate. 13th-century Tarikh-i Jahangushay, written by historian Ata-Malik Juvayni, narrated that a levy comprising the \\"Khalaj of Ghazni\\" and Pashtuns were mobilized by the Mongols to take part in a punitive expedition sent to Merv in present-day Turkmenistan. =Transformation of the Afghan Khalaj= The Khalaj were sometimes mentioned alongside Pashtun tribes in the armies of several local dynasties, including the Ghaznavids (977‚Äì1186).The Pearl of Pearls: The AbdƒÅlƒ´-DurrƒÅnƒ´ Confederacy and Its Transformation under A·∏•mad ShƒÅh, Durr-i DurrƒÅn by Sajjad Nejatie. https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/handle/1807/80750. Many of the Khalaj of the Ghazni and Qalati Ghilji region became assimilated into the local Pashto- speaking population and they likely formed the core of the Pashtun Ghilji tribe. They intermarried with the local Pashtuns and adopted their manners, culture, customs, and practices, also bringing their customs and culture to India where they established the Khalji dynasty of Bengal (1204‚Äì1227) and the Khalji dynasty of Delhi (1290‚Äì1320). Minorsky noted: \\"In fact, there is absolutely nothing astonishing in a tribe of nomad habits changing its language. This happened with the Mongols settled among Turks and probably with some Turks living among Kurds.\\" Because of their language shift and Pashtunization, the Khalaj were treated as Pashtuns (Afghans) by the Turkic nobles of the Delhi Sultanate (1206‚Äì1526). Just before the Mongol invasion, Najib Bakran's geography JahƒÅn NƒÅma (c. 1200-1220) described the transformation that the Khalaj tribe was going through: Notable people from the Khalaj tribe * Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khalji, founder of the Khalji dynasty of Bengal (1204‚Äì1227) * Jalal-ud-din Khalji, founder of the Khalji dynasty of Delhi * Alauddin Khalji, most powerful emperor of the Khalji dynasty of Delhi See also * Alat tribe References Category:Ethnic groups in Iran Category:Ethnic groups in Azerbaijan Category:Turkic peoples of Asia ","title":"Khalaj people"},{"id":"18014296","text":"right Antonio Lupis (16 February 1649 - 1701) was a prolific Italian writer.

Construction would not begin, however, until 1939, when permission was finally granted to build the shrine. It was completed in 1940, and named Gifu Gokoku Shrine.

Legend Gauri Kund is connected with Shiva's wife Parvati, also known as Gauri. In Hindu folklore, Gauri committed to penance involving many ascetic and yogic practices to win over Shiva's affections. Local tradition claims that Gauri Kund is the spot where Gauri lived while carrying out these practices and it was here that Shiva finally admitted His love for Her. They were married at Triyugi Narayan, which is located nearby. There are hot springs in Gaurikund and they are converted to bathing places. This place is also associated with the legend of how Ganesha acquired his elephant head. While bathing in the kund, Goddess Parvati fashioned Ganesha from the soap suds on Her body, breathed life into Him and placed Him at the entrance as Her guard. Lord Shiva happened to arrive at the spot and He was stopped by Ganesha. Indignant at this affront, Shiva cut off Ganesha's head and Parvati was inconsolable. She insisted that the boy be brought back to life and Shiva took the head of a wandering elephant and placed it on Ganesha's body. Parvati had Her son back and Ganesha acquired the persona by which He is known all over the Hindu world since then. History There are several inscriptions in the temple from historical times. One of the inscriptions states that the son of a Devadasi vowed to kill himself if the temple could not be completed. Saints and literary mention Tirugnana Sambandar, a 7th-century Tamil Saivite poet, venerated the deity in one verses in Tevaram, compiled as the First Tirumurai. He is believed to have rendered the verse while he visited the Kalahast temple. As the temple is revered in Tevaram, it is classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam, one of the 276 temples that find mention in the Saiva canon.

The confiscation law targeted Kingitanga MƒÅori against whom the government had waged war to restore the rule of British law. More than or 4.4 percent of land were confiscated,Ranginui Walker, Ka Whawhai Tonu Matou - Struggle Without End, Penguin Books, 1990. mainly in Waikato, Taranaki and the Bay of Plenty, but also in South Auckland, Hauraki, Te Urewera, Hawke's Bay and the East Coast.Taranaki Report, Kaupapa Tuatahi, Chapter 1, Waitangi Tribunal, 1996.Keith Sinclair, A History of New Zealand, Penguin, 2000, page 146 Legislation for the confiscations was contained in the New Zealand Settlements Act 1863, which provided for the seizing of land from MƒÅori tribes who had been in rebellion against the Government after 1 January 1863. Its stated purpose was to achieve the \\"permanent protection and security\\" of the country's inhabitants and establish law, order and peace by using areas within the confiscated land to establish settlements for colonisation, populated initially by military settlers enlisted from among gold miners at Otago and the Colony of Victoria (Australia).The Taranaki Report, Kaupapa Tuatahi, Chapter 5, Waitangi Tribunal, 1996. Land not used by for military settlers would be surveyed and laid out as towns and rural allotments and then sold, with the money raised to be used to repay the expenses of fighting MƒÅori. According to academic Dr Ranginui Walker, this provided the ultimate irony for MƒÅori who were fighting to defend their own land from European encroachment: \\"They were to pay for the settlement and development of their lands by its expropriation in a war for the extension of the Crown's sovereignty into their territory.\\" Although the legislation was ostensibly aimed at MƒÅori tribes engaged in armed conflict with the government, the confiscations showed little distinction between \\"loyal\\" and \\"rebel\\" MƒÅori tribes, and effectively robbed most MƒÅori in the affected areas of their land and livelihood. The parliamentary debate of the legislation suggests that although the confiscation policy was purportedly designed to restore and preserve peace, some government ministers at the time saw its main purpose to be the acceleration and financing of colonisation. Much of the land that was never occupied by settlers was later sold by the Crown. MƒÅori anger and frustration over the land confiscations led to the rise of the messianic Hauhau movement of the Pai MƒÅrire religion from 1864 and the outbreak of the Second Taranaki War and Titokowaru's War throughout Taranaki between 1863 and 1869. Some land was later returned to MƒÅori, although not always to its original owners. Some \\"returned\\" areas were then purchased by the Crown. Several claims have been lodged with both the Waitangi Tribunal and the New Zealand Government since the 1990s seeking compensation for confiscations enacted under the Land Settlement Act. The tribunal, in its reports on its investigations, has concluded that although the land confiscation legislation was legal, every confiscation by the government breached the law, by both failing to provide sufficient evidence there was rebellion within the designated areas and also including vast areas of land, such as uninhabitable mountain areas, which there was no prospect of settling. Submissions by the Crown in the 1999 NgƒÅti Awa investigation and a 1995 settlement with Waikato-Tainui included an acknowledgement that confiscations from that tribe were unjust and a breach of the Treaty of Waitangi. Ten deeds of settlement were signed by the Crown and iwi in 2012,Kate Shuttleworth, \\"Crown signs settlement for historical Treaty claims\\", New Zealand Herald, 20 December 2012. concluding with a $6.7 million redress package to a Waikato River iwi for \\"breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi that left the tribe virtually landless\\".Elton Smallman, \\"Tribe welcomes end to grievance\\", Waikato Times, 20 December 2012. Background to legislation Sir George Grey.Since the outbreak of the First Taranaki War at Waitara in March 1860, the New Zealand Government had been engaged in armed conflict with MƒÅori who refused to sell their land for colonial settlement or surrender the \\"undisturbed possession of their lands and estates\\" the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi had promised them. By mid-1863 the costs of fighting the war were continuing to mount - in 1861-62 the colonial defence vote was ¬£8031, while the British Government spent about ¬£400,000 - and the Government still found itself unable to quash MƒÅori resistance. In May 1863, weeks before the outbreak of the Second Taranaki War, Charles Brown, the Superintendent of Taranaki, wrote: \\"It would be rightful to confiscate from the tribes which should fight against us, territories of sufficient value to cover fully all the cost of the war.\\" Three days later Governor Sir George Grey and his ministers signed an agreement that a disputed block of land between Tataraimaka and Omata in Taranaki would be confiscated and Waitara MƒÅori hostile to the government were warned they also risked confiscation of their land. Premier Alfred Domett's ministry immediately began expanding their plans for mass confiscations. In June the ministry was planning a line of defence posts between Auckland and NgƒÅruawƒÅhia, clearing \\"all hostile natives\\" north of the line and confiscating their land, which would then be either given to military settlers or sold to defray the costs of war. The Government published notices of the terms for granting land in the Omata area to military settlers in July, and a month later for land in the Waikato area, even though no legislation for the confiscations yet existed. In August 1863, just three weeks after the invasion of the Waikato began, Attorney-General Frederick Whitaker and Defence Minister Thomas Russell sent Governor Grey a memorandum signed by Premier Alfred Domett, claiming that the Waikato, the most powerful MƒÅori tribe, was planning to drive out or destroy Europeans and establish a native kingdom. They argued that the security of the colony demanded that MƒÅori aggression needed to be punished and proposed that an armed population be recruited from the goldfields of Otago and Australia and settled on land taken from the \\"enemy\\". Whitaker and Russell, leading Auckland financiers, speculators and lawyers, were the most powerful men in the ministry and stood to make a substantial fortune if MƒÅori south of Auckland could be moved from their land.W.H. Oliver, The Story of New Zealand, Faber & Faber, 1960. Chapter 6. Grey, who had recently returned from a term as Governor of the Cape Colony in South Africa, where the military settlement of Xhosa land had been undertaken, embraced the idea and in a dispatch to the Colonial Office a month later set out details of the plan, repeating the claim that MƒÅori planned the wholesale destruction of some European settlements. The proposal was to place 5000 military settlers on the Waikato and Taranaki frontiers, each holding a 20 hectare farm on military tenure. Grey attempted to allay potential misgivings in the Colonial Office by pointing out that there were only 3355 MƒÅori living on 200,000 hectares of fertile land in the Waikato, and of this they had cultivated just 6000 hectares. He proposed making roads throughout the land to link the military settlements and towns and estimated the entire cost to be ¬£3.5 million. The funds would be raised with a loan from the Bank of New Zealand,Walker, in the book cited, says the loan was to be taken with the Bank of New Zealand; both Belich and W.H. Oliver say the loan was drawn from a bank in England. which Defence Minister Russell had founded, and from which both he and Attorney-General Whitaker hoped to profit. Security for the loan would be provided by the profits expected from the sale of confiscated land to new immigrants.Keith Sinclair, \\"A History of New Zealand\\", Penguin, 2000. By October the scheme had grown again, with the number of military settlers in Taranaki, Waikato and other areas now pegged at 20,000, with settlements linked by 1600 km of roads. In Taranaki alone, 8000 military settlers would be spread across 40 settlements stretching across 80,000 hectares from Waitara to Waitotara, near Wanganui. Legislation and debate Sir William FoxThe New Zealand Settlements Bill was introduced into the House of Representatives on 5 November 1863, attracting little debate and only two votes against it in each of the Lower and Upper Houses before it became law. The Bill was introduced by the Native Minister, Sir William Fox, who said its primary purpose was to suppress the \\"present rebellion\\". The word \\"confiscation\\" did not appear in the legislation. The minister conceded that land of MƒÅori who were not \\"in rebellion\\" could also be confiscated, but said they would be entitled to compensation through a Compensation Court. =Legislation= The preamble to the Act noted that the North Island had \\"been subject to insurrections amongst the evil-disposed persons of the Native race to the great injury alarm and intimidation of Her Majesty's peaceable subjects of both races and involving great losses of life and expenditure of money in their suppression\\". It continued: \\"Many outrages upon lives and property have recently been committed and such outrages are still threatened and of almost daily occurrence ... A large number of the Inhabitants of several districts of the Colony have entered into combinations and taken up arms with the object of attempting the extermination or expulsion of the European settlers and are now engaged in open rebellion against Her Majesty's authority.\\" The preamble said adequate provision should be made \\"for the permanent protection and security of the well-disposed Inhabitants of both races for the prevention of future insurrection or rebellion and for the establishment and maintenance of Her Majesty's authority and of Law and Order throughout the Colony ...the best and most effectual means of attaining those ends would be by the introduction of a sufficient number of settlers able to protect themselves and to preserve the peace of the Country.\\" The Act gave the Governor power to declare \\"as a District within the provisions of this Act\\", any land which was owned or used by a tribe, or part of a tribe, which he was satisfied had \\"been engaged in rebellion against her Majesty's authority\\" since 1 January 1863. The Governor could then set apart any land within these districts for \\"settlements for colonisation\\". All such land was automatically deemed to be discharged from all title interest or claim of any person. Compensation would be granted to those who claimed a title to it as long as they had not waged war or carried arms against the Crown or government forces, or given assistance or comfort to anyone who had done so. Claims for compensation would be considered by Compensation Courts established under the Act, with the judges to be appointed by the Governor. The Governor would cause to be laid out a \\"sufficient number of towns and farms\\", contracts would be made with \\"certain persons for the granting of land to them respectively in return for Military Service\\", and remaining land would be surveyed and laid out as towns and suburban and rural allotments. Money raised from the sale of land would be directed towards the repayment of the expenses of \\"suppressing the present insurrection\\" as well as providing any compensation awarded. =Parliamentary debate= Despite MƒÅori making up a third of New Zealand's population, the Parliament had no MƒÅori members.It was not until the passing of the Maori Representation Act 1867 that M√£ori gained direct representation. In the House of Representatives, only two MPs spoke in the debate on the Bill. G. Brodie supported it in a brief speech and James FitzGerald, in a lengthy attack, argued that the Bill was contrary to the Treaty of Waitangi, and that confiscation would \\"drive every (MƒÅori) into a state of hopeless rebellion ... be they friends or be they foes\\". In the Legislative Council Whitaker introduced the Bill, contending that by their rebellion, MƒÅori had violated the Treaty of Waitangi, thereby discharging the Crown \\"from all obligation\\" under the Treaty. Former Attorney-General William Swainson opposed the legislation, claiming it was in breach of both the treaty and the New Zealand Constitution Act. He said the Crown could not, \\"with honour and good faith, seize the land of peaceable MƒÅori subjects (those who were not in rebellion) without their consent\\". Dr Daniel Pollen, a former Superintendent of Auckland and Commissioner of Crown Lands, supported the Bill, but said the Government should take \\"not one acre more\\" than was necessary for military settlements. He described the legislation as immoral, claiming it was \\"in fact a Bill for the confiscation of Native lands of the province, that object being veiled by a specious form of words\\". He predicted that confiscation and military settlement would lead to a war of extermination. =Public debate= Confiscation was promoted by the press and many settlers because of its potential to provide cheap land and repay the cost of fighting the land wars. The Southern Cross newspaper condemned the conduct of the \\"blood-thirsty murderers\\" in the Waikato and declared: \\"There is only one way of meeting this, and that is by confiscation and the sword ... the natives have forced it upon us ... At the very least large tracts of their lands must be the penalty.\\" Retired chief justice Sir William Martin was one of the few in New Zealand who publicly opposed confiscation. He wrote: \\"The example of Ireland may satisfy us how little is to be effected towards the quieting of a country by the confiscation of private land; how the claim of the dispossessed owner is remembered from generation to generation, and how the brooding sense of wrong breaks out from time to time in fresh disturbance and crime.\\" In Britain, the Aborigines Protection Society also protested, with a statement noting: \\"We can conceive of no surer means of adding fuel to the flame of War; of extending the area of disaffection; and of making the Natives fight with the madness of despair, than a policy of confiscation. It could not fail to produce in New Zealand the same bitter fruits of which it has yielded so plentiful a harvest in other countries, where the strife of races has perpetuated through successive generations.\\" =Colonial Office response= Secretary of State Edward CardwellGovernor Grey assented to the Bill on 3 December 1863 and, because the Queen was empowered to still disallow the Act, a month later sent a copy of it to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, Duke of Newcastle, claiming he had agreed reluctantly with the principle. The Duke was replaced in April 1864 by Edward Cardwell, who wrote back to Grey expressing several objections to the law - it could be applied to MƒÅori in any part of the North Island; it allowed unlimited confiscation; some could be dispossessed without having been engaged in rebellion; and decisions could be made in secret without argument or appeal - and suggested the powers of the Act be limited to two years and that an independent commission be appointed to determine the lands to be confiscated. He noted that the Act allowed \\"great abuse\\" and needed to be controlled with a strong hand, recognising that it could prolong rather than terminate war. He urged the Governor to withhold his permission to any confiscation if he was not satisfied it was \\"just and moderate\\". Cardwell offered his own warning of the possible consequences of excessive confiscation: \\"The original power, the Maori, (would) be driven back to the forest and morass (and) the sense of injustice, combined with the pressure of want, would convert the native population into a desperate banditti, taking refuge in the solitudes of the interior from the pursuit of the police or military, and descending, when opportunity might occur, into the cultivated plain to destroy the peaceful fruits of industry.\\" Despite his reservations, Cardwell opted not to disallow the Act and later passed on an opinion of Crown law officers that it was not repugnant to the laws of England. Confiscations beginTaranaki= More than a year passed before Grey, who appeared to be involved in a power struggle with government ministers, issued his first proclamation to confiscate land. Within that time, however, Parliament also passed the Public Works Act 1864. which allowed MƒÅori land to be taken for public works ‚Äì initially, a road between Wanganui and New Plymouth. (In 1865 the Outlying Districts Police Act also came into force, enabling more land to be forfeited when chiefs failed to surrender fugitives). On 30 January 1865, Grey issued a proclamation to seize the middle Taranaki district, between the Waitara River and the Waimate Stream. Separate proclamations identified Waitara South and Oakura as confiscated districts. On 2 September he issued further proclamations, embracing the Ngati Awa and Ngati Ruanui districts, effectively seizing all of Taranaki from Parinihi to Wanganui and beyond Mt Taranaki in the interior. The same day Grey announced that \\"the war which commenced at Oakura is at an end\\", that \\"sufficient punishment\\" had been inflicted and that no more land would be confiscated. In fact no Taranaki land remained unconfiscated. Despite the announcement of peace, hostilities continued in the Taranaki War, as Major-General Trevor Chute stepped up his aggressive campaign of storming pƒÅ throughout South Taranaki. Confiscations in Taranaki left many hapu with nothing of their own to live on, forcing them to become squatters on Crown land and driving them to unaccustomed levels of desperation. =Waikato= Although fighting in Waikato had finished by mid-1864, the following year Grey confiscated more than 480,000 hectares of land from the Waikato-Tainui iwi (tribe) in the Waikato as punishment for their earlier rebellion. Proclamations under the Act were issued on 30 January 1865 for the seizure of the East Wairoa and West Pukekohe blocks for settlement and colonisation, followed by the Central Waikato district and the Mangere, Pukaki, Ihumata and Kerikeri blocks (16 May 1865).Report of the Sims Royal Commission into Confiscated Native Lands and Other Grievances, Page 15 As the occupants were evicted from their land, their belongings were looted by colonial forces and neighbouring settlers, with houses ransacked, cattle seized and horses transported for sale in Auckland.Report of the Sims Royal Commission into Confiscated Native Lands and Other Grievances, Page 16 The war and confiscation of land caused heavy economic, social and cultural damage to Waikato-Tainui. King TƒÅwhiao and his people were forced to retreat into the heartland of NgƒÅti Maniapoto. The Maniapoto, by contrast, had been more zealous for war than the Waikato, yet suffered no loss of land because its territory was too remote to be of use to white settlers. The 1927 Royal Commission on Confiscated Land, chaired by senior Supreme Court judge Sir William Sim, concluded that although the government restored a quarter of the 1,202,172 acres (486,500 hectares) originally seized and paid almost ¬£23,000 compensation, the Waikato confiscations had been \\"excessive\\".Report of the Sims Royal Commission into Confiscated Native Lands and Other Grievances, Page 17 The Waitangi Tribunal in 1985 declared the Tainui people of the Waikato had never rebelled,Report of the Waitangi Tribunal on the Manukau Claim but had been forced into a defensive war.The Waikato-Tainui claim, NZ History In the early 1990s Tainui opted to bypass the Waitangi Tribunal and concluded a Treaty claims settlement with the Crown through direct negotiation. In May 1995 the Crown signed a Deed of Settlement with Waikato-Tainui that included cash and land valued at $170 million. The settlement included an admission by the Crown that it had \\"unjustly confiscated\\" the land.Deed of Settlement between the Queen and Waikato-Tainui, 17 December 2009 =Bay of Plenty= On 17 January 1866, the Governor confiscated most NgƒÅti Awa land in the Bay of Plenty on the grounds of war and rebellion. The Waitangi Tribunal noted there was a \\"popular belief\\" the confiscations were punishment for the murder of James Te Mautaranui Fulloon, an officer of the Crown, at Whakatane in July 1865, but said the Settlements Act could not be used as a punishment for the crime of murder. In addition, only two or three of 30 NgƒÅti Awa hapu (sub-tribes) were involved in the murder, the individuals responsible for the murder were already on trial at the time of the confiscation and all resistance was at an end in the area, with local rangatira (chiefs) having taken an oath of allegiance. The most unconscionable of the many ironies in the confiscation was that the main part of the land used for military settlements was at Whakatane, on the land of the most innocent.Summary of Ngati Awa Raupatu Report, 1999The Ngati Awa Raupatu Report, chapter 6, Waitangi Tribunal, 1999 The tribunal concluded: \\"We do not think it is at all established that there was a war in the usual sense. More particularly, we consider that there was no rebellion ... the confiscation was clearly contrary to the Treaty of Waitangi.\\" Settlement of confiscated lands Soon after the passing of the Settlements Act in 1863, agents were employed to enlist men for military service in Taranaki from among the gold miners of Otago and Melbourne. Between 30 December 1863 and 17 February 1864 four ships arrived in New Plymouth carrying 489 volunteers.B. Wells, The History of Taranaki, 1878, Chapter 25. In Taranaki were laid out as military settlements with the hope that when men were released from military duty they would remain on their allotments and become permanent settlers. By 1866, when their three years of service was over, many had left Taranaki already, while most of those who did complete their service opted then to sell, leaving no more than 10 per cent of the military settlers on the land. Of the 11 towns laid out north of the Waingongoro River, most had no houses on them, while the most populous, including Normanby, Hawera and Carlyle (Patea), rarely had more than a dozen. The main reason was the inability of the provincial government to provide work for the men, or to build roads and bridges linking the settlements. Throughout New Zealand the Government had confiscated areas clearly unsuitable for settlement: in Taranaki, they had taken the whole of Mt Taranaki, while in the Bay of Plenty they had confiscated Mt Putauaki, the whole of the Rangitaiki Swamp and other areas of thick bush. Military settlers ultimately took less than 1 per cent of land confiscated from Ngati Awa. In Taranaki, MƒÅori, often with the tacit consent of the government, later began returning to the lands that had been taken from them. When parts of those lands were subsequently wanted for settlement, compensation payments were made to MƒÅori users - in government eyes, a bribe to keep the peace rather than a purchase price - and deeds of cession were signed, transferring title to Europeans. In 1880 spiritual leader Te Whiti o Rongomai judged that such payments meant the confiscations were a sham and began to actively claim back confiscated land that had not been used by the government, proceeding on the basis that MƒÅori only had to enter the land and plough it to re-establish their rights. Te Whiti rejected cession payments and bribes and his followers persistently pulled up surveyors' pegs and obstructed road makers, initially in central Taranaki and later throughout New Zealand, with ploughmen's campaigns. Tension led to the armed police raid on Parihaka, Taranaki, in November 1881 and the expulsion of 2000 men, women and children, followed by the destruction of the village.

Davies (9 August 1833 ‚Äì 25 November 1906) was the leader of a Latter Day Saint schismatic group called the Kingdom of Heaven, which was located near Walla Walla, Washington, from 1867 to 1881. Davies was born in Eglwysfach county of Denbigh, WalesRobert S. Fogarty (2003). All Things New: American Communes and Utopian Movements, 1860‚Äì1914 (Lanham, Md.: Lexington Books) pp. 50‚Äì51. to a Methodist family.J. Gordon Melton (1996, 5th ed.). Encyclopedia of American Religions (Detroit, Mich.: Gale) p. 565. In 1847, he converted to Mormonism and in 1854‚Äì55 he emigrated to Utah Territory as a Mormon pioneer to join the gathering of the members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). In 1857, Davies became disillusioned with the leadership of the LDS Church after the Mountain Meadows Massacre, and he became a follower of the schismatic leader Joseph Morris. After the 1862 Morrisite War, Davies moved with a number of Morrisites to Deer Lodge County, Montana. While in Montana, Davies had a series of revelations which instructed him to establish the \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" near Walla Walla, Washington. Davies and forty of his followers moved there in 1866 and established a communal society on 80 acres. Davies held legal title to all property of the Kingdom of Heaven. Davies's main departure from mainstream Mormonism was his teaching of reincarnation. He taught his followers that he was the archangel Michael, who had previously lived lives as the biblical Adam, Abraham, and David. When his son Arthur was born on 11 February 1868, Davies declared that the infant was the reincarnated Jesus Christ; the child came to be called \\"Walla Walla Jesus\\".James Matthew Morris and Andrea L. Kross (2004). Historical Dictionary of Utopianism (Lanham, Md.: Scarecrow Press) pp. 76‚Äì77. After the announcement, the size of Davies's followers doubled; most of the new converts came from San Francisco, California, and Portland, Oregon. When Davies's second son, David, was born in 1869, he was declared to be God the Father. The Kingdom of Heaven began to collapse in 1880, when both Davies children died of diphtheria. Some of Davies's followers sued him and won a $3200 judgment against him. As a result, Davies was forced to sell the Kingdom's property, which essentially brought the Kingdom to a close. At the time of its break-up, there were 43 members of the group. Davies moved to a camp he owned on Mill Creek and briefly attempted to revive his following, but eventually gave up and moved to San Francisco. Davies returned to Walla Walla shortly before his death in 1906, and is buried at the Lyons Cemetery north of Mill Creek Road.

It is a scheduled ancient monument and a grade I listed building. It was built in the late Middle Ages as a two- storey stone pele tower which was altered and enlarged mainly in late 16th century. It is built on high ground 600 feet above sea level about four miles north of Bolton. William Camden described it as being built \\"amongst precipices and wastes.\\" A north wing and additions were made during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I and alterations were made during the early years of Queen Victoria. Structure The oldest part of the building, which was probably built in the early 15th century, is the stone pele tower which measures 45 feet in length from north to south and is 28 feet in width. It is about 35 feet in height with walls four feet thick. In the north-west corner of the tower the shaft of a garderobe projects from the main structure. The tower had three low storeys as evidenced by the blocked window openings. Its walls are rough with large corner quoins. During the early 16th century two cruck framed buildings were added to the tower and later an extension at the front of the house created the entrance with its imposing front door. Inside the building this Tudor architecture can be seen including part of the cruck structure along with exposed and restored sections of the wattle and daub and lath and plaster wall panelling. The entrance and entrance hall belong to the rebuilding of 1596 when vast changes were made and the tower raised to its present height. The new upper storey was built in ashlar stone separated from the old rubble walling by a moulded string course. The old floors were removed and the walls raised to 45 feet to the top of the battlements. The narrow windows were blocked up, and replaced by large three, four, and five-light mullioned and transomed windows, transforming the appearance of the old part of the building. During the 17th century the cruck buildings were clad in stone and the structure remained unchanged until the 19th century. After 1835 the Kay's were responsible for Victorian renovations including the Dutch gable fa√ßade. Occupants Turton Tower was home to the lords of the Manor of Turton, and in about 1200 was part of the barony of Manchester, by which time part of the manor was in the hands of the de Lathom family. It was inherited in 1420 by the Orrells, who rebuilt the pele tower. In 1603 William Camden described it as built first for defence, that tournaments were held there in the 14th century and that it was entirely rebuilt of stone in 1594. In 1628 the Orrells sold Turton Tower to Humphrey Chetham, the Manchester merchant responsible for the creation of Chetham's Library and Chetham's School of Music. It passed to his descendants, the Bland, Green and Frere families who leased it to a succession of tenant farmers. The tower was sold in a state of disrepair in 1835 to James Kay who restored it. He sold the tower to Elizabeth and Anne Appleton who leased it to William Rigg, a calico manufacturer, whose daughter, Ellen, wrote \\"Victorian Children at Turton Tower\\". In 1903 the tower was bought by Sir Lees Knowles, 1st Baronet, MP for Salford West, for ¬£3,875. After his death in 1929, his widow, Lady Nina Knowles, presented it to Turton Urban District Council in 1930, and it became the council's seat of local government. After local government re-organisation in 1974, Turton was split and the tower became part of the new Borough of Blackburn, and was administered by Lancashire County Museums Service. Following changes to the Lancashire County Museum Service, the tower was taken over by Blackburn with Darwen Council.

Etymology A more polite but less accurate name for the sangmin is \\"yangmin\\" (). History The sangmin consisted of peasants, laborers, fishermen, some craftsmen and merchants. The sangmin were considered \\"clean workers\\" but had little social status. Generally they were poor. They paid most of Korea's taxes and were subject to the military draft. Their lives were hard, but they were the foundation of the Joseon dynasty, just like the chungin were the backbone of the government. Some of the sangmin owned land which they farmed. Others rented land from the yangban as tenant farmers. Those that did not farm had the lowest status. In everyday life, the sangmin were the working people who struggled to survive. The yangban and chungin controlled and ruled over them. The sangmin did the heavy work. During the late Joseon period, particularly in the 19th century the sangmin rebelled many times because of oppression and corruption by the yangban.

The basic concept of a tractor PTO auger is to harness the tractor's available energy by attaching a PTO shaft to a tractor's PTO drive in order to drill a hole of predetermined size (size of the auger shaft and diameter) and depth into the ground. This in turn will provide power to the Tractor PTO Auger's gearbox. Most modern Tractor PTO Auger gearboxes come standard with a shear bolt to protect the gear drive if the auger encounters an obstruction such as rock during drilling a hole. Tractor PTO Augers connect via 3 point hitch to subcompact tractors and mid-size tractors.

A jobbing press, job press, or jobber is a variety of printing press used in letterpress printing.The term used varies, with various printing dictionaries disagreeing on what to call it and how to define it. Even within a single source the terminology may vary. Common terms include \\"job press\\", \\"small platen press\\", \\"jobber\\", \\"jobbing machine\\", \\"job machine\\", or simply \\"platen press\\" (when used in distinction from a hand press). Stuart's dictionary even defines two of the terms differently. For an illustration of these issues, see the various sources cited in the article. The press is meant to be operated by a pressman working on small jobs, as opposed to long print runs or newspaper work, or jobs that require less than a full-sized sheet of paper, though the definition of \\"small jobs\\" may vary widely depending on the printing shop. Such work might include printing personal stationery, handbills, or other small printing jobs, or may include even a small book. Such presses were common in the later 19th and 20th centuries, have yet been largely replaced by the photocopier for small and medium runs, and by the desktop computer for personal stationery. Today, the jobber is the preferred press for letterpress printers who now produce high-end prints (often wedding invitations) for customers who want an antique effect. Though the term can refer to any small printing press or machine intended for such work, it most commonly refers to a class of small, vertical platen presses. Depending on the time-period when the machine was made, they may be operated by treadle, line shaft, electricity, or by hand lever. Platen job press The most common form of job presses were those classified as platen presses. A platen press is one that has a platen (a flat metal plate) to apply the needed pressure against the paper and bed of type to form the impression, in contrast to those presses that use a cylinder. George Phineas Gordon developed a design of press that was widely adopted, his \\"Franklin Press\\". Chandler & Price was a company that made a widely used jobber press.

There are three main generations of the Chandler & Price press, all distinguished by the style of the flywheel: Old Style (pre-1910; wavy spokes), New Style (after 1910; plain spokes), or Craftsman (after 1921; solid flywheel). The New Style made by Chandler & Price was such a popular press that The Practice Of Printing: Letterpress and Offset by Ralph Polk, the standard textbook for thousands of high school printing programs in the middle of the 20th century, used the press as its example when teaching students the basics of press operation. This is a Chandler & Price 10X15 New Style Printing Press. This is a Chandler & Price 10X15 press being inked up for a job.

His book The Homosexual in America: A Subjective Approach, published in 1951, was considered \\"one of the most influential works in the history of the gay rights movement,\\" and inspired compassion in others by highlighting the difficulties faced by homosexuals.Summers, Claude J. Encyclopedia of gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender and queer culture He was titled \\"father of the homophile movement\\" for asserting that gay men and lesbians deserved civil rights as members of a large, unrecognised minority.Johnson, David K. (2005) Encyclopedia of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender History in America However, Vern L. Bullough believes the title is undeserved as Sagarin did not actively participate in resistance and did not join any homophile organisations until 1962, a time when he was seeking a topic to analyse in his thesis.Bullough, Vern L. (2002) New York: Harrington Park Press. Before Stonewall: Activists for Gay and Lesbian Rights in Historical Context BiographyEarly life= Sagarin was born in Schenectady, New York to Russian Jewish parents. Sagarin was born with scoliosis, which produced a hump on his back. He attended high school, and after graduating, spent a year in France where he met Andr√© Gide. Upon his return to New York, he enrolled at City College of New York, but was forced to drop out of college due to the Great Depression. In 1934, Sagarin met Gertrude Liphshitz, a woman who shared his left-wing political interests. They married in 1936 and soon after, Gertrude gave birth to a boy. Sagarin established himself in the perfume and cosmetics industry, becoming knowledgeable about the chemistry of perfumes, and publishing The Science and Art of Perfumery in 1945. =Donald Webster Cory= Sagarin began a dual life, publishing The Homosexual in America: A Subjective Approach in 1951, which was deemed an \\"act of heroism\\", under the pseudonym of Donald Webster Cory. The use of the nom de plume, and the attitudes that differed when Sagarin used either of his identities, led to the comparison of Sagarin/Cory to the Dr. Jekyll/Mr Hyde character. Mr. Cory, who presented homosexuals as a despised minority, was seen as a \\"mythic hero\\", where Dr. Sagarin (as he would later be known) was a \\"hunchback deviant\\".Sears, James T. (2006) New York: Harrington Park Press. Behind the Mask of the Mattachine The publication of the book was considered a \\"radical step\\", as it was the first publication in the United States that discussed homosexual politics and sympathetically presented the plight of homosexuals.Mark Blasius & Shane Phelan (1997) New York: Routledge. We are Everywhere: A Historical Sourcebook of Gay and Lesbian Politics Sagarin described how homosexuals were discriminated against in almost all aspects of their lives and called for a repeal of anti-homosexuality laws; > One great gap separates the homosexual minority from all others, and that is > its lack of recognition, its lack of respectability in the eyes of the > public, and even in the most advanced circles. A research report by Alfred Kinsey et al., Sexual Behavior in the Human Male (1948), had a beneficial effect on the reception of Sagarin's publication. In 1952, due to the success of The Homosexual in America: A Subjective Approach, Sagarin established a subscription book service called \\"Cory Book Service\\", which chose a gay-themed literary work each month. Sagarin continued using his pseudonym, and released a second publication in 1953 called Twenty-One Variations on a Theme, an anthology of short stories dealing with homosexuality to which included pieces by Sherwood Anderson, Paul Bowles, Christopher Isherwood, Denton Welch, Charles Jackson, and Stefan Zweig. =1960s= In 1958 Sagarin joined Brooklyn College, completing his BA in an accelerated program, and in 1961 he entered an MA program in sociology, where he wrote a thesis on The Anatomy of Dirty Words. Throughout the 1960s, Cory remained one of the most conservative members of the Mattachine Society, and opposed the rejection of the \\"sickness theory\\" of homosexuality by some homophile leaders. His belief was that homosexuality was \\"a disturbance\\" that probably arose as a result of a pathological family situation. In 1963, he co- authored a book called The Homosexual and His Society with John LeRoy (pseudonym of Barry Sheer), which claimed that there was no such thing as a \\"well adjusted homosexual\\". In 1965 as Cory, he failed in his bid for presidency of the Mattachine Society. The loss of the presidency, and his difference in beliefs from other members of the Society, resulted in a disparity that directly influenced his education. Sagarin entered New York University's PhD program in sociology, graduating in 1966, submitting a dissertation titled \\"Structure and Ideology in an Association of Deviants\\", which was a study of the Mattachine Society. He did not, however, reveal his involvement in the society as Cory. His acceptance of the position of assistant professor at Baruch College, a campus of City University of New York, led some to characterise it as the beginning of his rise to \\"giant in the field of sociological deviance\\" and the recession of his part in the homophile movement. =1970s= In the 1970s, Sagarin pursued an active homosexual life, though he continued to characterise homosexuals as disturbed, and frequently urged them to seek therapy. He rejected the idea that homosexuality was a natural sexual variant, and criticised the new psychological and sociological studies of Evelyn Hooker and John Gagnon. However, he argued that homosexuality should be decriminalized. The real identity of Sagarin's persona, Donald Webster Cory, remained unknown until a 1974 convention of the American Sociological Association in Montreal. On a panel entitled \\"Theoretical Perspectives on Homosexuality\\", Sagarin levelled criticism at the liberationist scholarship, and in response, Laud Humphreys exposed Sagarin by calling him \\"Mr. Cory\\". After the convention, Sagarin withdrew from issues concerning homosexuality. On June 10, 1986, he died of a heart attack. At the time, he was serving as Dean Of The Graduate School Of The John Jay College Of Criminal Justice in NYC.

From the mid-1990s to the year of An's death, with the help of and in coordination with the ICC-Angkor, the APSARA National Authority received more than US$500 million in grants for the funding of some 70 projects from various countries and international communities. As head of the Delegation of Cambodia, during the 31st regular session of the World Heritage Committee in Christchurch in 2007, An acquired considerable experience in both technical and personal terms through his active participation in the work of the Committee and through his relationships with his fellow Committee members. During the 31st regular session of the World Heritage Committee in Christchurch, in response to the presentation of the portfolio by the Cambodian delegation team led by An, the Committee recognized ‚Äúthat the Sacred Site of the Temple of Prasat Preah Vihear is of great international significance and has Outstanding Universal Value and agreed in principle that it should be inscribed on the World Heritage List‚Äù which led to its formal inscription by the Committee at its 32nd session in Canada in 2008.

In 1939, the TSV Amalie Essen also became part of the sports club.Gr√ºne, Hardy (2001). Vereinslexikon. Kassel: AGON Sportverlag TuS was a worker's side that had a close association with the Krupp family-owned mining company until the mid-1950s. Helene Amalie Krupp, co-founder of the family's industrial empire, is acknowledged in the names of several local football and sports clubs. The team won promotion from the Bezirksklasse Niederrhein (II) in 1940 after a failed attempt to advance out of the playoff round the previous year. TuS then captured the Gauliga Niederrhein (I) title in 1941 and made appearances in the opening rounds of both the national championship and the Tschammerpokal, predecessor to today's DFB-Pokal (German Cup). Despite a poor season the next year, TuS remained competitive, earning upper table finishes in their following two campaigns. As World War II overtook the country, the team became part of the wartime side Kriegspielegemeinschaft Helene/Preu√üen Essen alongside Essener Sportclub Preu√üen. The combined side played only two matches in the war-shortened 1944‚Äì45 season. Like most other organizations in the country, including sports and football clubs, TuS was disbanded by occupying Allied authorities after the war. It was re-established in 1945 as VfR 1928 Essen before adopting the name TuS Helene Essen in 1948. Between 1948 and 1956 the team competed in the Amateurliga Niederrhein (II), but ultimately was unable to keep up with its local rivals. The team enjoyed some fresh success in the 1980s as three consecutive promotions advanced the side to the Verbandsliga Niederrhein (V) where they played three seasons before backsliding to the local Kreisliga. The club had a successful 2007‚Äì08 season, winning promotion to the Landesliga Niederrhein (V) out of the Bezirksliga Niederrhein (VI). It dropped out of the Landesliga in 2010, was relegated from the Bezirksliga in 2012 and now plays in the tier eight Kreisliga A.

Biography Samuel was born in Li√®ge. He spent much time in Brussels where he was a pupil of Fran√ßois-Joseph F√©tis, and where he was a friend of Hector Berlioz. He also studied with Joseph Daussoigne-M√©hul at the Royal Conservatory of Li√®ge. He began to study music at the Liege Conservatory of Louis-Joseph Dossuan and Etienne Subra. In 1838, together with his family moved to Brussels and continued his studies at the Brussels Conservatory with Fran√ßois-Joseph F√©tis (counterpoint), Charles Bosselet (harmony), Jean- Baptiste Michelot (clavier) and Christian Friedrich Girschner (organ). For the first time he was noticed by the general public, accompanying the violinist Charles Auguste de B√©riot on the piano as part of the young Pauline Viardot's concert tour. Samuel, who won the Belgian Prix de Rome in 1845 by the cantata \\"Vendetta\\", went to Rome through Germany and Austria, met on the road with Felix Mendelssohn, Giacomo Meyerbeer and Ferdinand Hiller. In Rome, he worked on the opera Giovanni da Procida and the Second Symphony, premiered by F√©tis in Brussels in 1849 after the return of Samuel. 1850s in the works of Samuel were under the sign of the influence of Hector Berlioz (their friendship began with an enthusiastic review of the London premiere of the opera Berlioz \\"Benvenuto Cellini\\", which Samuel published in Belgium). Samuel became in 1860 Professor of Harmony in Brussels and 1871 Conservative Director of Ghent. In 1865 he founded in Brussels a series of public concerts, based on the model of Jules Pasdeloup, during which he promoted the music of contemporary composers, especially Richard Wagner and Franz Liszt. With this he wanted to make classical music accessible to everyone and to promote the musical and intellectual level of the Brussels people. Since 1871, he headed the Ghent Conservatory , in Ghent also acted as an adherent of a new German school; the last concert Samuel conducted shortly before his death was completely composed of orchestral fragments of Wagner. In 1871, after conducting an orchestra for some years and (beginning in 1865) directing a series of Popular Concerts in which works by Peter Leonard Leopold Benoit and Anton Rubinstein among others were featured, Samuel resigned and became director of the Ghent Conservatory., page 588. Samuel's own compositional work combines the influences of Berlioz, Wagner and Liszt. His central works are the monumental program Sixth (1891) and the Seventh (1893) symphony (the program of the first of them is based on the Old Testament, the second - on the New: in these last years of life, Samuel, a Jew by birth, was baptized and became a Catholic). Conversion and death In 1895 Samuel was baptized and became a Catholic Christian, converted himself from Judaism late in life.svm.be He died in Ghent.

The shrine was replaced by the Gifu Gokoku Shrine in nearby Gifu after it was completed in 1940. The shrines two festival days are April 23 and September 22.

Supporting actors include: Peter Mark Richman, Virginia Vincent, Frank Puglia, Jimmy Baird, and Naomi Stevens. Plot Rose Bianco (Sophia Loren) a florist widowed by a famous gangster, looks for happiness with widower Frank Valente (Anthony Quinn). Rose is dealing with her son Ralph in a work farm for troubled boys, though Ralph is warned that if he runs away one more time he will be sent to reform school. Frank‚Äôs grown up daughter and only child Mary (Ina Balin) takes care of everything for him. Noble and Mary love each other and are engaged, but Mary refuses to marry him because she worries about who will take care of her father. She asks Noble to marry her and stay with her in her father‚Äôs house, but Noble wishes to purchase a house near the location of his business in Atlantic City as he is tried of commuting. At the same time, however, she refuses to accept Rose as her stepmother and allow her to join the family. Before Frank‚Äôs wedding day Mary irons Frank‚Äôs clothes, cooks all the food and locks herself in her room. As Frank's wife suffered from serious depression and mental illness after the birth of Mary, Frank fears that his late wife's mental illness has been inherited by his daughter. This leads Rose and Frank to call everything off, devastating them both. Meanwhile Rose has taken Frank to visit her son Ralph at the work farm. It is agreed when Frank and Rose marry Ralph will be released into their custody. When Rose‚Äôs son finds out the wedding has been cancelled and he will not be able to leave, he runs away from the work farm, leading the police to come and search for him in the house. The next day, Noble comes and sees Frank is sleeping in his chair; Mary has still confined herself in upstairs. He asks her to come out, but there is no answer. The two men agree their only hope is to pray together. Noble decides he will drop Frank off at Rose‚Äôs house and will wait at the church for him. Frank finds out that Rose is waiting beside the telephone for news about Ralph and reveals how miserable he is, torn between her and his daughter. Frank leaves and joins Noble in the church and Rose heads for Frank‚Äôs house to confront Mary. Her son comes to the church, hoping to see his mother one last time before they send him to reform school. Frank and Noble bring him back to the farm and manage an agreement with the boarding manager, Mr. Harmon. On the other hand, thinking herself alone in the house, Mary unlocks the door and comes out of the room. There she meets Rose, who has decided to try to help Frank find happiness, even if it is not with her. Rose argues her point with Mary and makes her understand Rose's love for her father, and finally Mary accepts her, asking her to stay for coffee. Frank, Rose, Noble, and Mary have breakfast together. In the end, Rose and Frank take Ralph out of the work farm and the three happily walk toward the horizon.

ReceptionCritical response= The staff at Variety wrote in their review: \\"Orchid has a flavor of Marty, a touch of Wild Is the Wind. The story threads and changing emotions are securely locked in through Martin Ritt‚Äôs honest direction. Without pushing, he tells an intricately drawn story with a smooth, authoritative hand.\\" Film critic Bosley Crowther of The New York Times wrote in his review: \\"When anyone gives his director what Mr. Quinn gives Martin Ritt, it is certainly too bad that the director hasn't something equally good to give back to him.But, unfortunately, Joseph Stefano, who wrote the original script, did not put into the hands of the director a story that is up to Mr. Quinn.\\" For her performance in the film, Sophia Loren, won the Coppa Volpi for best actress at the Internation Film Festival in Venice. =Release= The Black Orchid was released in theatres on February 12, 1959.

Life Lord Uxbridge at Waterloo, oil on board, 1815. Jones was the only son of John Jones, a mezzotint engraver. He became a student at the Royal Academy in 1801 at the early age of 15, exhibiting his first work depicting a biblical scene in 1803. He was a frequent exhibitor at the Royal Academy over the next eight years. He joined the Royal Montgomery Militia; the date of his commission as captain is given as 17 February 1812.A List of the Officers of the Militia of the United Kingdom. War Office, 1 June 1812, page 48 There is a possibility that he had served in the South Devon Militia as far back as 1808.Hichberger, 1983, page 14. His obituary The Art Journal Vol. VIII (1869), page 336 states that he volunteered for active service with his company in Spain, but he was certainly was part of the army of occupation in Paris after the Battle of Waterloo. After the war he resumed his art career, winning prizes and fame for his paintings of military engagements. He was elected an associate of the Royal Academy in 1822, a full member in 1824, becoming its librarian, and from 1840 to 1850 its keeper. He was the friend of Charles Turner, engraver, and of J. M. W. Turner, whose most loyal executor he became, writing a short memoir of him and painting pictures recording his gallery. Unlike the two Turners he is unaccountably not commemorated on his former residences in London by any plaque. He married Gertrude Anne Loscombe in 1844. He died in Park Square, Regent's Park on 19 September 1869. =Resemblance to Wellington= Jones bore a strong resemblance to his hero, Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, and was sometimes mistaken for him. Jones was said to be very proud of his resemblance to the Duke.English Heritage, Clerics & connoisseurs: the Rev. Matthew Pilkington, the Cobbe family and the fortunes of an Irish art collection through three centuries, English Heritage, 2001, p.309. When Wellington was told about this he remarked, \\"Mistaken for me, is he? That's strange, for no one ever mistakes me for Mr. Jones\\".Longford, Elizabeth, Wellington: Pillar of State, Weidenfeld & Nicolson, p.148 In fact, there is evidence that Wellington was once mistaken for Jones. When approached by a man who said \\"Mr Jones, I believe\\", Wellington replied, \\"if you will believe that you will believe anything.\\" WorkPeninsular War Paintings= While it is unknown whether Jones went to Spain, he did make the acquaintance of Lieut. Gen. Paul Anderson, who had fought in the Peninsular War. The latter had also been a friend of the late General Sir John Moore and was present at the death of the general at the Battle of Corunna. Anderson commissioned Jones to paint the burial scene and possibly two companion pieces. The artist also painted a scene of the Battle of Vittoria which is now in the Royal Collection. =Borodino and Waterloo Paintings= \\"The artillery officers had the range so accurately, that every shot and shell fell into the very centre of their masses.\\" Waterloo was particularly attractive to the artist and he exhibited no less than five paintings of the battle at the Royal Academy and six at the British Institution, earning the nickname 'Waterloo' Jones. His 1816 piece at the BI was for the competition for the best rendition of the battle, for which he won the second prize of 200 guineas. His presence in the latter stages of the campaign clearly helped him and he made numerous sketches of the battlefield and surroundings; some of these were used in a book entitled The Battle of Waterloo...By a Near Observer published in 1817.The Battle of Waterloo...By a Near Observer (London: John Booth, 1817). In 1829, Jones painted a large scene of Borodino, while from the same year came his scene entitled Nelson boarding the 'San Josef' at St. Vincent. =Scinde Campaign Paintings= Jones was friendly with William Napier, brother of General Sir Charles Napier, and following the victories in Scinde in 1842-43, William asked Jones to paint a scene in support of his brother who was being criticised for supposedly creating the war to further his own ambitions. Jones painted several scenes including the Battle of Meanee, the Battle of Hydrabad, the Battle of Trukee and the destruction of the fortress at Emaum Ghur. =Crimean War Paintings= The subject of the war in the Crimea appealed to Jones who exhibited two preliminary oil sketches at the Royal Academy in 1855 entitled The battle of the Alma and Balaclava 1854 - conflict at the guns. Four years later, the artist submitted another picture entitled The Battle of Inkermann. =Indian Mutiny Paintings= Just as the Scinde paintings were created to celebrate a general, Jones painted several scenes of the Indian Mutiny to honor Sir Colin Campbell. The first piece was entitled Contest in the Raptee river between the 7th Hussars, commanded by Sir W. Russell, and the Sowars. His two major paintings depicted Lucknow and Cawnpore. =Abyssinian Campaign= In the final year of his life, Jones produced a watercolor depicting The conquest and destruction of Magdala.

GNOME Chess does not include a chess engine of its own, so to play against the computer a third party chess engine must be present. Most Linux distributions package GNU Chess as the default chess engine with it. Additionally GNOME Chess supports third party chess engines, with known ones automatically detected. GNOME Chess is written in Vala. For 2D rendering it uses GTK+ and Cairo/librsvg, and 3D support is optionally available using OpenGL.

First version was written in C, OpenGL for graphics, and GLUT for the user interface. On May 5 was released 0.1.0, the first but still not playable version, being only capable to draw board and pieces. Days later, on May 31, version 0.1.3 was finally included on SourceForge and playable on a very basic way. On April 8, 2001 version 0.2.0 changed GLUT to GTK+ focusing the improvement in visual aspects instead of its chess artificial intelligence. Version 0.3.0, from June 27, could play against other artificial intelligence (AI) engines, like Crafty and GNU Chess, after a Chess Engine Communication Protocol (CECP) implementation and it was ported to IRIX platform. In December, version 0.4.0 was the last one before the project entered into a stand-by time of three years. In December, 2004, there was an advance to version 0.8.0 in order to accelerate the achievement the 1.0. This version added network support and updated GTK+ from version 1.2 to 2.0. One year later, December 2005, version 0.9.0 was intended to be the last release before 1.0. It replaced C for Python to improve platform portability and maintenance, besides having a better test approach of the codebase testing. On December 16, 2006, glChess finally reached version 1.0. Apple Chess is a fork of GNOME Chess. In version 3.14 3D mode was removed.

He was one of Australia's top comedians; he worked with some of the early greats of Australian comedy, including Roy Rene and George Wallace. In the 1930s, however, he was one of the vanguard to modernise comedy out of baggy suits, funny face make up and slapstick into the more modern stand up style comedian - in a tailored suit, the only prop a cigarette in hand, delivering gags. His role in the evolution of Australian comedy was acknowledged in a tribute by Joe Martin when he was honoured as a life member of the \\"ECHINDAS\\" by his peers years later. Early life Scanlon was born at the Salvation Army home, Mount Lawley, Western Australia. In 1918 he was formally and legally adopted by the midwife who had delivered him and taken care of him since he was 3 days old, Harriet, and her husband Maurice Scanlon. They lived in Charles St, West Perth. He started performing professionally at the age of 9, touring with YAL (Young Australia League), which also produced the talented Colin Croft and internationally known Rolf Harris. Jack Cox, an English producer/director, taught Terry the basis of comic routines. Terry refined his craft through years of touring through West Australia, South Australia and Victoria during the 1930s. Scanlon left school at the age of 13 and his elderly adoptive parents had died in 1928 while he was in his early teens. He had no family but his burning ambition to become a comedian and perform in the east of Australia sustained him. He was still touring mainly around Perth and Fremantle at this time with William (Billy) R. Heaton. He began touring with Mrs Teague's Concert Party, performing in jails, hospitals, asylums and at Cottesloe beach, performing in the show \\"Sleepy Time Down South\\" while doubling as a waiter in a guest house. Still in his late teens he continued learning his craft with great enthusiasm; touring with vaudeville shows, visually impaired shows, community concerts etc. Career Doing diverse, but mainly comic performances Scanlon also performed as a juggler, assistant in a dagger throwing club and did a stint in a tent show as a boxer. In those days people had to be versatile. Comedy however was his true forte and on the advice of an act, Ted and Flo James, he was advised to go to the eastern states and get work in the theatres there. Many years later Ted and Flo James became show business agents in Sydney and Terry would get a lot of bookings through them. Terry decided to leave WA and in a T-model Ford he crossed the Nullarbor Plain. The car blew up during its long journey. He was now stuck in Adelaide and South Australia was not appreciated by strangers from other states. As these were the depression years they were having enough problems feeding their own. He kept performing wherever he could. Six months went by and he decided to move on to Melbourne. A racing car driver was driving to Melbourne for a competition and Terry was able to hitch a ride with him. He found work in Melbourne including Sunday night performances at the Kings, Savoy, Princess and Apollo theatres. He worked with Ronny Shand, an acrobatic comic as well as Jo Lawman and Stella Lamond. Scanlon remembered nursing Toni Lamond when she was a baby. Scanlon was in his early 20s when he hit the big time. He started performing at the Melbourne Tivoli which marked the beginning of a 26-year relationship with the Tivoli circuit. The Tivoli was owned by a variety of people over the years. At the time Scanlon first performed at \\"The Tiv\\", the owner was an ex-actor, Frank Neil. After Neil was found murdered in South Melbourne, Wallace Parnell took charge (brother of the English Entrepreneur Val Parnell, who ran the London Palladium). Later still, David M. Martin took charge, whose son Lloyd Martin was to become the director of the Sydney Opera House. Scanlon had a lifetime contract with the entrepreneur Harry Wren, who booked him into theatres all over Australia including the Cremorne-Brisbane, Tasmania and New Zealand. A fellow performer related the story of when the power was cut during an ice show in New Zealand. With the aid of the impromptu spotlights provided by usherettes and their torches, Terry entertained the audience, telling gags for 1.5 hours non-stop till the power came back on. In all that time he never once stooped to tell a dirty joke. Scanlon also worked in night clubs including Sydney's \\"Sammy Lees\\" and \\"Jo Taylors.\\" He performed pantomime. He was famous as \\"Buttons\\" in Cinderella. He did Vaudeville, variety and revue. He even played the pivotal part of Lord Fancourt Babberley in Charley's Aunt, staged by the Tivoli in Adelaide. During the 1950s, Terry toured England with the Empire Theatre circuit, working in Scotland and Ireland. He played the then famous Collins Music Hall in Islington, London, where he topped the bill and was the only Australian to do so. He also did six seasons at the racy Windmill Theatre. Scanlon toured North Africa, Cyprus, Malta and Germany entertaining US troupes stationed there. He also performed in Bimbos, a famous nightclub in San Francisco and then left the US for more work in the UK. He also entertained the troupes in Vietnam. During that engagement, he performed with other artists including Lucky Starr. Scanlon was awarded a certificate of appreciation from General William Westmoreland, the General of the United States army in 1967. He was a keen golfer and played on the famous St Andrews golf course in the UK. And when in the United States played and met one of the all time golf greats, Ben Hogan, on his own course in Fort Worth, Texas. Scanlon had his own television show in the late 1960s, The Terry Scanlon Show, running on channel 9 in Melbourne. He also made guest appearances on the Stuart Wagstaff show there. He also had his own show in Sydney on Channel 7 and a guest appearance on The Bobby Limb Show on Channel 9. However, Scanlon preferred the warmth of live audiences. With the closure of the Tivoli and other live variety theatres due to the advent of television, RSL and other clubs were a source of work in the precarious world of show business. During the 1960s, Scanlon became very ill. He had glaucoma, heart problems and was diagnosed as manic-depressive. Scanlon performed alongside artists such as No√´l Coward, Dave Brubeck, Johnnie Ray, Mel Tourme, Howard Keel, Chico Marx, Tommy Trinder, Arthur Askie, Billy Daniels. Retirement and death Scanlon retired from public life. He had lived in the eastern suburbs of Sydney for 35 years and in later life became a local identity around Bondi Beach. He died aged 83 years. He was buried at Waverley Cemetery; Geoff Bull led his musicians playing a traditional jazz funeral march.

It is constructed mainly of broken stone, with roughly dressed quoins and a slate roof. The house is situated within Garth Celyn, a double bank and ditch, overlooking the Menai Strait to Anglesey. A smaller house was immediately adjacent in 1811 when Sir Richard Colt-Hoare recorded it; this was demolished by 1815. The present structure incorporates a four-storey stone tower. The present roof timbers were dated by dendrochronology to 1624, when the house was refurbished. There is evidence of long use with multiple rebuildings before 1624, but there is disagreement on the duration and nature of its mediaeval use. Construction history In 1303‚Äì06 building works at \\"Aber\\" were carried out on a large scale, including the importation of broken stone and of lime for mortar. The remains of the other candidate for such work, the high-status early mediaeval site, on and near the mound known as the M≈µd, do not now have masonry of broken stone and may not have been large enough to justify the quantities of material recorded.A Brief Report on Pen y Bryn and Aber, Gwynedd.

Edited by Henry Hardy and released posthumously in 2000, the collection comprises the previously published works Vico and Herder: Two Studies in the History of Ideas (1976) ‚Äì an essay on Counter-Enlightenment thinkers Giambattista Vico and Johann Gottfried Herder ‚Äì and The Magus of the North: J. G. Hamann and the Origins of Modern Irrationalism (1993), concerning irrationalist Johann Georg Hamann. Overview Berlin's initial interest in the critics of the Enlightenment arose through reading the works of Marxist historian of ideas Georgi Plekhanov. The historian Zeev Sternhell has raised questions concerning the editing of the work, pointing to Henry Hardy's replacement of Berlin's citations of secondary sources with primary sources on a number of occasions. He suggests that Hardy's editing \\"raises doubts as to Berlin's reading of his sources,\\" and concludes with the following observation: \\"The question whether systematically omitting the secondary sources and replacing them with texts that Berlin himself did not mention, which probably means he did not read them, can be considered a legitimate procedure is highly dubious.\\" Vico and Herder are portrayed by Berlin as alternatives to the rationalistic epistemology which characterized the Enlightenment. Berlin held that the agenda of the Enlightenment could be understood in a number of ways, and that to view it from the perspectives of its critics (i.e. Vico, Herder and Hamann) was to bring its distinctive and controversial aspects into sharp focus. Three Critics was one of Berlin's many publications on the Enlightenment and its enemies that did much to popularise the concept of a Counter-Enlightenment movement that he characterised as relativist, anti-rationalist, vitalist and organic,Darrin M. McMahon, \\"The Counter-Enlightenment and the Low-Life of Literature in Pre-Revolutionary France\\" Past and Present No. 159 (May 1998:77-112) p. 79 note 7. and which he associated most closely with German Romanticism. Berlin identifies Hamann as one of the first thinkers to conceive of human cognition as language ‚Äì the articulation and use of symbols. Berlin saw Hamann as having recognised as the rationalist's Cartesian fallacy the notion that there are \\"clear and distinct\\" ideas \\"which can be contemplated by a kind of inner eye\\", without the use of language. Herder, coiner of the term Nazionalismus (nationalism) is portrayed by Berlin as conceiving of the nation as a \\"people's culture,\\" the unique way of life of a particular folk, bound by ties of kinship and ties to land, defined by their unique history.

Exame Nacional do Ensino M√©dio (; ), shortened as Enem () is a non-mandatory, standardized Brazilian national exam, which evaluates high school students in Brazil. The ENEM is the most important exam of its kind in Brazil, with more than 8.6 million registered candidates in 2016. It is the second largest in the world after the National Higher Education Entrance Examination, the entrance examination of higher education in China. After 2009 its importance for students who want to attend college has increased, since the exam has been used both as an admission test for enrollment in 23 federal universities and 26 educational institutes, as well as for certification for a high school degree. The test is also used by people desiring to gain points in the Universidade para Todos Program (or ProUni), a federal scholarship program. Date and time The ENEM is held in early November, with a small number of students taking the test in early December. The test starts at the same time across Brazil, with the starting time being based in Federal District. This results in the ENEM starting at four different times according to the local time zones, ranging from 10:30 am in the state of Acre to 1:30 pm in the Federal District and states of the South and Southeast regions.  The test  Until 2008, the exam consisted of two parts: a 63 question multiple-choice test on various subjects (Portuguese, History, Geography, Math, Physics, Chemistry and Biology) and a composition. Since 2009, the exam has been composed of 180 multiple-choice questions, equally divided into four areas of knowledge: languages, codes and related technologies (plus a written essay); human sciences and related technologies; natural sciences and related technologies; and mathematics and its technologies. Due to the length of the test, it is applied in two consecutive sundays, the first lasting 300 minutes, and the second lasting 330. Even though its purpose is to be a national evaluation exam, students can use their scores to be admitted to a university, though not every university accepts it as the only admission exam. Usually private institutions, such as PUC-Rio, a major private Brazilian university, accept Enem as an admission exam. Others, such as University of S√£o Paulo and Faculdade C√°sper L√≠bero use the student's score as supplement to their admission credentials, depending on the student's performance. Since 2009, most of Brazil's federal universities have used ENEM as part of their admission exams, either as the entirety of the exam, the first level, or as a way of selecting potential candidates. 2009 controversy On October 1, 2009, it was announced that the test, which was supposed to take place on October 3 and 4, would be cancelled and postponed to another date within a 45-day period. The decision was made by the Brazilian Ministry of Education after the original test was offered for sale to a Brazilian newspaper O Estado de S. Paulo for R$ 500,000 (some US$ 278,000). After contacting the source, who stated that he obtained the test via a person from Inep (an institute of the Ministry of Education), the newspaper examined the exam. and the minister of education, Fernando Haddad, confirmed the leak was of the official exam. At that time the Ministry of Education decided to move the exam to the beginning of December, in accordance with exam periods in universities. The decision was not implemented.

It's Thursday edition is called the Weekender and provides a preview for The Traveler is an affiliate of UWIRE, which distributes and promotes its content to their network. History Students at the university had published student literary magazines as early as 1895, but the first student newspaper was founded on Oct. 10, 1906, as The University Weekly. The newspaper was supported by student subscription and remains a student-operated publication. Its first editor was Joseph Othel York, a senior from Bellefonte, Arkansas, who published the paper weekly through the end of the academic year. Early stories in the newspaper included coverage of the university debate team, reports by faculty members, sports stories and news from the three residence halls. It initially was printed on tabloid size paper, briefly printed in magazine format during the 1909‚Äì10 school year, switched to broadsheet during the 1920s and 1930s and back to tabloid during the 1940s. The first woman to edit the newspaper was Elizabeth Adams, who ran the paper during the 1913‚Äì14 school year. The first cartoonist for the newspaper, Stuart Carothers, who also worked on the paper during that period, became well known across the country when he went to work for the Chicago Herald Examiner in 1914-1915, drawing a cartoon strip called Charlie Chaplin's Comic Capershttps://www.lambiek.net/artists/c/carothers_stuart.htm , which was syndicated to 60 metropolitan newspapers. The name of the newspaper was changed in 1920 when editors decided to publish the paper more than once a week. The editors sponsored a contest to select a new name, and The Arkansas Traveler, well known as the name of a story by Sanford Faulkner that was later put to music in the song also titled \\"The Arkansas Traveler\\", was chosen. Like many student newspapers, the quality and focus of the paper shifted each year as a new student editor took over. The Traveler briefly suspended operations in 1917 when a flu epidemic forced the university and the surrounding Fayetteville community to be quarantined. Otherwise, the newspaper has printed without interruption since, even printing an edition about a blaze that consumed the newspaper offices and printing plant when the university's Hill Hall caught fire in 1969. Skip Rutherford was editor from 1971‚Äì72.

Playing career Brown played semi-professionally for Mossley, Hyde United and Southport in the United Kingdom before being brought to New Zealand by Napier City Rovers midway through 1985. Despite being sent off in his club debut, Brown's goalscoring touch immediately turned struggling Napier's season around leading them from the bottom of the New Zealand National Soccer League to 1985 Chatham Cup winners in a final that became known as \\"Greg Brown's final\\", in which he scored one goal and set up two others in the 3‚Äì1 win over North Shore United. He was named man of the match in the final. However, with Brown injured, Napier failed to avoid relegation from the national league during the following week's promotion/relegation play-offs and Brown was pursued by several national league clubs, eventually moving to Miramar Rangers for the 1986 season. He was the national league's top scorer for the first half of the 1986 season but hit a dry spell due to injury during the second half. In February 1986 he was selected in the New Zealand national football team, making four B-international appearances in friendlies against a touring USSR XI.New Zealand International Matches ‚Äì Details 1980‚Äì1989 In 1987, Brown moved across the Tasman to play for the Parramatta Eagles from 1987 to 1992 and the West Adelaide Sharks from 1992 till his retirement from professional football in 1994, aged 32. He was named Australian football player of the year in 1990 and was picked in the Australian national team in 1991, going on to make 12 appearances and scoring one goal. Managerial career Brown joined Mitchelton FC in the local Brisbane competition in 1996 and was the club's head coach from 2004 to 2007. From November 1997 to March 1999, Brown was coach of the Matildas, the Australian national women's team, and took them to a record 14 internationals without a loss. He resigned from the position after the side's poor showing at the World Cup in the United States.

The movie was based on the 1974 novel by Scottish author Alistair MacLean (1922‚Äì1987), of the same title, and was filmed in north central Idaho. Plot In the 1870s, residents of the garrison at the Fort Humboldt frontier outpost of the United States Army are reported to be suffering from a diphtheria epidemic. A special express train is heading up into the remote mountain ranges towards the fort filled with reinforcements and medical supplies. There are also civilian passengers on the train in the rear luxurious private car ‚Äì Nevada Governor Fairchild (Richard Crenna) and his fianc√©e Marica (Jill Ireland), the daughter of the fort's commander. The train stops briefly in the small whistle stop settlement of Myrtle, where it takes on board local lawman United States Marshal Pearce (Ben Johnson) and his prisoner, John Deakin (Charles Bronson), a supposedly notorious outlaw who was identified via a picture in a newspaper advertisement offering a $2,000 (approximately $ today) reward. But as the journey goes on through the beautiful snowy mountain scenery, several train passengers, including most of the train's soldier escort, are mysteriously killed or go missing. Deakin, who is actually an undercover U.S. Secret Service agent, uncovers en route that the \\"epidemic\\" at the outpost is actually a conspiracy between a group of killers led by the notorious outlaw Levi Calhoun (Robert Tessier), and a tribe of Indians under Chief White Hand (Eddie Little Sky). Instead of medical supplies, the train's boxcars are transporting a large secret shipment of weapons, rifles, ammunition and dynamite stolen from U.S. arms manufacturers for sale to the Indians, in return for allowing Calhoun and his men to mine and smuggle gold from their lands. Most of the people on the train, including Governor Fairchild and Marshal Pearce, are Calhoun's partners in crime, and those innocents who discover the evidence for his sinister plot are eliminated. Eventually, Deakin narrows his list of possible uninvolved allies down to Marica and Army Major Claremont (Ed Lauter), who agrees to assist the agent in his efforts to prevent the arms delivery. At snow-covered Breakheart Pass, all hell breaks loose as Indians attack the train to take the weapons they were promised, and Calhoun and his men ride out to the train in order to find out what is going on. Deakin and Major Claremont use dynamite to blow up and break the track rails, grounding the train before it reaches the fort; and while Deakin runs interference, Claremont rushes ahead to Fort Humboldt to free the soldiers imprisoned by Calhoun's gang. A gunfight breaks out when the freed soldiers clash with the Indians and bandits at the train; Calhoun is killed by Gov. Fairchild when he threatens Marica, but the governor is then in turn cut down by Major Claremont. At the end of the battle, Deakin intercepts Marshal Pearce and shoots him when the corrupt lawman decides to go down fighting.

Lewiston realtor Irv Falling, a retired U.S. Army colonel, played a cameo role as the father of Marica, Gov. Fairchild's fianc√©e (Jill Ireland) in the final snowy scene, as frontier army colonel and commander at Fort Humboldt reunites with his daughter. He had helped the Bronsons find a home to rent. Bronson and Ireland arrived in Lewiston for filming in early March 1975 and stayed at 322 Stewart Avenue. =Filming= Some exteriors were filmed in Pierce and Reubens in northern Idaho.Idaho film archive The Native American extras were Nez Perce, mostly from Railroad scenes were filmed on the Camas Prairie Railroad (based in Lewiston). The hire of the train (Great Western Railway steam locomotive #75)Railroad Movies on DVD (RailServe.com) carriages and track cost $500,000 (approximately $ today). Opening scenes in the Myrtle settlement / \\"whistle stop\\" were shot at a specially built set (to look like an old abandoned Gold Rush town) just outside Arrow Junction about from Lewiston. It was the final film role participation for longtime veteran stuntman Yakima Canutt, who was aged 79 at the time. He was in charge of the second unit direction; his son, Joe, was one of the stuntmen. Canutt oversaw the scene where the caboose and troop carriages crashed off the rail line into a ravine. Six cameras filmed the cars falling into the canyon, however, the dummies (representing the soldiers) failed to fall out during the crash. The crash was filmed at Halfmoon Trestle east of U.S. Route 95 in Lapwai Canyon. Alternating shots of clear and overcast skies are present in the final climactic scenes. Bronson later said that in the original story it was not revealed until the very end that his character was a detective. When he read an early script, the reveal was made much earlier. Bronson demanded it be changed to the way it was in the original story and this was done. During filming, Bronson discovered the script had been changed again to reveal his character was a detective early. Bronson was unhappy with this but went along with it as by then filming was underway and he felt he could not leave the production. Reception The Los Angeles Times called it \\"a fun if familiar picture but is played so broadly on such an elementary level that it can hope to satisfy only the most undemanding of viewer.\\" The film was a box office disappointment in the US.

He served in Guernsey, the West Indies, Flanders, Gibraltar, and Egypt. He joined the 90th Foot in 1794, when, under Thomas Graham, (later Lord Lynedoch), he trained light company troops. On the death of Lieutenant-Colonel Ogilvie of the 44th Foot, Mackenzie transferred to that regiment, taking command. Following a decision by the British Army to train some line regiments in light infantry techniques, Sir John Moore, a proponent of the light infantry model, offered his own regiment of line infantry, the 52nd (Oxfordshire) Regiment of Foot, for this training, at Shorncliffe Camp.Chappell, p. 11 Mackenzie was appointed lieutenant colonel of the 52nd. They formed a brigade with the 95th Rifles, and three line regiments.

Injured after a fall from a horse in late 1803, he took leave, during which time he married Rachel Andrews, of Shorncliffe. (They had 6 sons and one daughter.) He saw some active service at Cadiz, but his health remained poor, and he spent most of the war convalescing in England. In 1811 he was given command of the light infantry troops then in England. In early 1814 he served under Thomas Graham in the Netherlands, commanding the 2nd Division in the Expeditionary Corps. During the Hundred Days he commanded the citadel of Antwerp.

As with all closely related tarantula species, they defend themselves with urticating hair when provoked. Appearance and characteristics Adult female The Mexican fireleg resembles its better-known relative, the Mexican redknee tarantula (Brachypelma hamorii, formerly confused with Brachypelma smithi), in its dramatic orange and black coloration, though the adults of the species range from 5 to 6 inches in size. This species of tarantula has a slower growth rate than many of the larger South American tarantula species. The black femora (upper legs) provide a dark dividing band between the rich orange color of the carapace and lower legs. Unlike the orange joints of Brachypelma hamorii, the legs of this species are a bright, fiery red on the patellae (or knees), fading gradually to a paler orange further down and tipped by black tarsi (or feet). Although not particularly defensive, this species of spider can have a nervous temperament, where the spider can flick urticating hairs when it feels threatened. Range and habitat The Mexican fireleg tarantula is native to Southern Mexico and sometimes western, where it is found along the central Pacific coast in western Guerrero State, where it prefers dry scrubland, and is found in burrows, either self-made or abandoned rodent or lizard burrows, usually under rocks or fallen logs. Biology Tarantulas of this genus are long-lived, with males reaching maturity at seven to eight years, females at nine to ten. While males only live up to a year after their final molt, females may live for a further ten years. Sub-adults and adults molt at the end of the dry season (November to June), after which males begin their search for mating females. Mated females will produce an egg sac which, if successful, will generally hatch three to four weeks before the rainy season begins. Mexican Fireleg tarantulas tend to be active after dark, but can also occasionally be active during daylight, particularly in the morning and evening. The Mexican fireleg tarantula (Brachypelma boehmei) in captivity at the Louisville Zoo Conservation As with other Brachypelma species from the west coast of Mexico, this species makes a popular pet due to its docility and vivid colours, leading to its over-collection from the wild. The illegal pet trade, together with the ongoing destruction of natural habitat and its high mortality rate before sexual maturity, causes considerable concern for the future of this tarantula.West, R. (2008) Pers. comm. To regulate its commercial trade across borders, this species has been listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). In Mexico, permits are required to collect or remove any spider of the family of tarantulas, Theraphosidae, and the Mexican fireleg tarantula is now frequently bred in captivity, reducing the need to collect it from the wild. Nevertheless, large numbers of tarantulas caught in the wild continue to be smuggled out of Mexico. As pets This species is commonly kept as a pet and along with other members of its Genus is regarded as suitable for beginners. In captivity, adult Brachypelma boehmei usually feed on crickets, super meal worms, meal worms, and dubia roaches. Spiderlings will usually feed on pre- killed mealworms, pinhead crickets, baby dubia roaches, wingless fruit flies, and any other small insects which are not defensive. When keeping tarantulas as a hobby, note that Brachypelma boehmei and many other tarantulas are endangered species and only captive-bred (farm-bred or home-bred) tarantulas rather than wild-caught ones should be kept.

Background Zouaves embarking at Algiers for Tonkin, January 1885 The battle took place three weeks after the end of the Siege of Tuy√™n Quang, in the course of a French reconnaissance of positions occupied by troops of Tang Jingsong's Yunnan Army and Liu Yongfu's Black Flag Army. French accounts of the battle are curiously reticent, suggesting that things had gone badly wrong. In the wake of the relief of Tuy√™n Quang, General Louis Bri√®re de l'Isle, the general-in-chief of the Tonkin Expeditionary Corps, drew up plans for a campaign against the Yunnan Army by a column of 5,000 French and Algerian troops, 2,000 Tonkinese auxiliaries and 460 mules and horses. The campaign would be launched from the major French base at H∆∞ng H√≥a. Chef de bataillon Simon's 1st Battalion, 1st Zouave Regiment, which had only recently arrived in Tonkin, was ordered to make a preliminary reconnaissance of the village of Phu Lam Tao, reported to have been occupied by strong elements of the Yunnan Army. On 23 March 1885, Simon reached Phu Lam Tao and discovered that the village was held by a force of Yunnan regulars and Black Flags (\\"pirates\\", as the French called them). Simon ordered his battalion to attack. The battle What happened next is difficult to establish, as the French sources skate over the engagement in silence or make only the barest of allusions to it. Agence Havas, the official French news agency, announced merely that Simon's battalion had made a reconnaissance towards Phu Lam Tao and had suffered several casualties, but there was clearly more to the affair than that. It is certain that the zouave battalion attacked Phu Lam Tao and was repulsed, and very likely that the repulse was ignominious. The fullest account of the action was given by Paul Sainmont, an officer in chef de bataillon Mignot's battalion of the 2nd Zouave Regiment, which had accompanied Simon's battalion to Tonkin: > Today the 1st Battalion, 1st Zouave Regiment was at grips with the soldiers > of Luu Vinh Phuc in the Thanh May district near the village of Bang Huyen. > The pirates arrived there in bands chased from Lang Son by de N√©grier and > from Tuyen Quang by Bri√®re de l'Isle, to concentrate on this point. Our > comrades fought furiously all the evening of 23 March, and after nightfall > the garrison of Hung Hoa, which was watching this spectacle from the top of > the citadel, saw the glare from the flames which were devouring two or three > neighbouring villages, and could guess that action had been joined on a > fairly wide front. The zouaves did not lack energy or bravery, but night > came on and the enemy was now in too great numbers. They were forced to > regain their cantonments on the left bank of the Red River, in good order, > having vainly made several furious assaults on the fortified pagoda of Bang > Huyen under an extremely murderous fire.Sainmont, 120‚Äì1 French Zouave officer in Tonkin in Spring of 1885 According to Lieutenant- Colonel Bonifacy, who discussed the battle years later with officers who had been present, the troops fell back in disorder, throwing away their haversacks and rifles. Bonifacy commented that the Zouaves, fresh from Algeria, should not have been given such a mission until they had acclimatised themselves to conditions of war in Tonkin.Bonifacy, pp. 37‚Äì38 The Chinese sources claim that the Yunnan Army and the Black Flags won a clear victory at Phu Lam Tao. According to the Yunnan Army's official report, its forces at Phu Lam Tao were attacked by the French on 23 March, the attack was defeated, and the French abandoned their dead on the battlefield and retreated in panic into the jungle. The report added that the French retired from the area on 24 March, abandoning 400 uniforms and quantities of weapons and maps.Lung Chang, p. 340 Casualties The casualties suffered by the French in this action are disputed. According to Lecomte, who dismissed the affair as an unimportant skirmish, Simon's battalion suffered 'around a dozen' casualties.Lecomte, pp. 329‚Äì30, 515‚Äì16 According to Sainmont, French casualties were around 40 to 50 dead and wounded.Sainmont, p. 121 According to Nimier, French casualties were 6 dead and 29 wounded.Nimier, p. 32 Nimier's figures were accepted several decades later by Thomazi, the historian of the French conquest of Indochina.Thomazi, p. 110 Significance The significance of the engagement at Phu Lam Tao was that it took place one day before General Fran√ßois de N√©grier's heavy defeat on 24 March 1885 at the Battle of Bang Bo by the Guangxi Army. The coincidence led Bri√®re de l'Isle to conclude, wrongly, that the French were facing a concerted offensive by both Chinese armies. This conclusion helped to set the pessimistic tone of his notorious \\"L·∫°ng S∆°n telegram\\" of 28 March 1885, despatched in the wake of Lieutenant-Colonel Paul- Gustave Herbinger's Retreat from L·∫°ng S∆°n, which toppled the government of Jules Ferry in the Tonkin Affair and brought the Sino-French War to a speedy end in circumstances of considerable embarrassment for France. The Thanh May district remained in the hands of Vietnamese bandit concentrations until October 1885, when General Roussel de Courcy, who succeeded Bri√®re de l'Isle in command of the Tonkin Expeditionary Corps in May 1885, mounted a large- scale attack on their positions with 5,000 French troops, driving the bandits back up the Red River to Thanh Quan.Huard, pp. 1072‚Äì78; Sainmont, p. 178; Thomazi, p. 125 NotesReferences * Bonifacy, Lieutenant-Colonel, A propos d'une collection de peintures chinoises repr√©sentant divers √©pisodes de la guerre franco-chinoise (Hanoi, 1931) * Huard, L., La guerre du Tonkin (Paris, 1887) * Lecomte, J., Lang-Son: combats, retraite et n√©gociations (Paris, 1895) * Lung Chang [ÈæçÁ´†], Yueh-nan yu Chung-fa chan-cheng [Ë∂äÂçóËàá‰∏≠Ê≥ïÊà∞Áà≠, Vietnam and the Sino-French War] (Taipei, 1993) * Nimier, H., Histoire chirurgicale de la guerre au Tonkin et √† Formose (Paris, 1889) * Sainmont, P., Alg√©rie, Tonkin, Cambodge: souvenirs et impressions d'un soldat du 2e Zouaves (Tours, 1896) * Thomazi, A., Histoire militaire de l‚ÄôIndochine fran√ßaise (Hanoi, 1931) Phu Lam Tao Phu Lam Tao Phu Lam Tao Category:1885 in France Category:1885 in China Category:1885 in Vietnam Category:Military history of Yunnan Category:History of Tuy√™n Quang Province Category:History of Ph√∫ Th·ªç Province Category:March 1885 events ","title":"Battle of Phu Lam Tao"},{"id":"18016508","text":"E.

Hurricane Jeanne was the eleventh tropical cyclone, tenth named storm, seventh hurricane, and sixth major hurricane of the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season. It formed from a tropical wave on September 13 near the Lesser Antilles, and encountered favorable enough conditions to reach tropical storm status. Jeanne strengthened further in the eastern Caribbean Sea, becoming a strong tropical storm and developing an eye before striking Puerto Rico on September 15. Remaining well-organized, it attained hurricane status before hitting the eastern tip of the Dominican Republic on September 16. Hurricane Jeanne steadily weakened while crossing eastern Hispaniola, and on September 17 it briefly weakened to tropical depression status after reaching open waters. Its original circulation dissipated as a new one reformed closer to the main area of thunderstorms. Turning northward, Jeanne slowly reorganized and again reached hurricane status on September 20. It executed a clockwise loop to the west, weakening due to upwelling upon reaching its path again. Jeanne encountered favorable conditions as it continued westward, and it reached major hurricane status before crossing the northern Bahamas on September 25. The next day, it struck Martin County, Florida in nearly the same location as Hurricane Frances just weeks before. Jeanne weakened over land while turning the northwest, deteriorating to tropical depression status over Georgia on September 27. It turned northeastward, becoming extratropical on September 28 before dissipating on September 29 after merging with a cold front. The hurricane produced heavy rainfall across its path, including in Haiti where precipitation caused devastating mudslides; over 3,000 deaths were reported in the country. Heavy rainfall also occurred during its landfalls on Puerto Rico and Florida, resulting in river flooding. In its strongest landfall, the hurricane produced strong winds across an area earlier affected by Hurricane Frances and, in some locations, by Hurricane Charley. Late in its duration, the combination of moisture from Jeanne and cool air resulted in a tornado outbreak that extended from Georgia through the Mid-Atlantic states.  Formation and first landfall  The origins of Hurricane Jeanne were from a tropical wave that moved off the coast of Africa on September 7. Containing a scattered area of moderate convection, the wave tracked westward at 12‚Äì17 mph (19‚Äì28 km/h), located to the south of a large ridge. The system initially showed no signs of development, with unfavorably dry air persisting across the region. On September 11, convection became slightly better organized, and the next day broad cyclonic turning became evident. However, overall development was hindered by upper-level wind shear from Hurricane Ivan in the Caribbean Sea, as well as from an upper-level low to the north of the wave. Late on September 12, while approaching the northern Lesser Antilles, convection increased and became better organized around an area of increased cyclonic turning. Environmental conditions became more favorable, allowing for the development of a low pressure area and for banding features to increase. Late on September 13, with the formation of a broad low-level circulation, it is estimated the system developed into Tropical Depression Eleven about 70 mi (110 km) east- southeast of Guadeloupe. Radar image of Jeanne hitting Puerto Rico Upon first becoming a tropical cyclone, the depression was located to the south of the subtropical ridge, resulting in a west-northwest track which brought the center over Guadeloupe. The circulation was initially broad, and dry air temporarily entrained the northwest quadrant of the storm. However, environmental conditions were favorable enough for further development, with a deepening trough to its west providing beneficial flow. Banding features improved around the circulation, and the National Hurricane Center upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Jeanne on September 13 about 135 mi (220 km) southeast of Saint Croix. While crossing the Lesser Antilles, the storm brought locally heavy rainfall, with a total of 12 inches (305 mm) reported in Guadeloupe. Tropical Storm Jeanne quickly organized over the eastern Caribbean Sea, developing a tight inner core and well-defined outflow as it tracked over warm water temperatures of about 84 ¬∞F (29 ¬∞C). Initially, the storm was forecast to attain hurricane status before crossing Puerto Rico. However, its organization deteriorated by early on September 15, with radar imagery tracking a low-level circulation moving away from the convection. The temporary weakening was due to increased shear and dry air. At 1600 UTC on September 15, Jeanne made landfall near Guayama, Puerto Rico with winds of 70 mph (115 km/h), and as it moved ashore it was in the process of developing an eye. Across the territory, the storm produced heavy rainfall, peaking at 23.75 inches (605 mm) on Vieques Island. Rainfall across the region resulted in moderate to severe river flooding, with several river stations in Puerto Rico reporting historical levels. Light winds, generally around tropical storm force, affected the region as well.  Second landfall and reorganization  Rainfall from Jeanne caused catastrophic flooding in Haiti Tropical Storm Jeanne remained over Puerto Rico for about eight hours, during which it maintained its eye feature and well-defined inner core of convection. It intensified over the Mona Passage, and attained hurricane status as it struck the eastern tip of the Dominican Republic on September 16. Continuing slowly west-northwestward near the coast, Jeanne quickly weakened to tropical storm status, and by 24 hours after landfall its convection had deteriorated as the eye feature dissipated. Late on September 17, it emerged into the Atlantic Ocean as a tropical depression, after having dropped torrential rainfall across Hispaniola. Catastrophic flooding and mudslides were experienced in Haiti, including in the coastal city of Gona√Øves, and over 3,000 deaths were reported in the country. On September 17, while it was over Hispaniola, the National Hurricane Center issued a forecast that predicted Jeanne to make landfall near Savannah, Georgia in about five days. However, the forecast noted uncertainty in regards to the steering currents, which depended on the movement of the remnants of Hurricane Ivan and a ridge building behind it. After it left the nation as a tropical depression, the original center of circulation tracked westward away from the convection and dissipated. However, a new circulation developed closer to the convection, and Jeanne regained tropical storm status on September 18. By then, the mid-level circulation associated with Hurricane Ivan had combined with a trough to weaken the ridge located across the western Atlantic Ocean; this caused Jeanne to track northward through the Turks and Caicos Islands. As it tracked northward, the storm failed to organize at first, due to the influence of an upper-level low to its south. The circulation became broad and elongated, as well as removed from the deepest convection. However, after moving away from the low, the convection became better organized and more associated with the convection. After some initial slow organization continued, an area of deep convection developed over the center midday on September 20. An eye developed within the convection, and late on September 20 Jeanne re-attained hurricane status about 350 mi (570 km) east-northeast of the Abaco Islands in the Bahamas. While intensifying as a tropical storm, the National Hurricane Center faced difficulties in the future track of Jeanne, based on two major divergences between computer hurricane models. One scenario involved the storm accelerating east-northeastward to the south of a trough, following the path of Hurricane Karl to its east. The other scenario involved Jeanne turning southeastward and looping westward due to a building ridge. By early on September 20, the official forecast followed the first scenario, though later that day, officials changed the forecast to indicate the turn to the south.  Peak intensity and final landfall  Forecast map several days prior to landfall, indicating threat to North Carolina Hurricane Jeanne steadily intensified as it turned eastward, developing a 52 mi (83 km) wide eye. A motion to the southeast began on September 22, and around the same time it reached winds of 100 mph (160 km/h), making it a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale. At the same time, the National Hurricane Center forecast to turn westward and later northwestward, with its projected five-day track within 60 mi (100 km) of Cape Fear, North Carolina. The westernmost outlier during one model run was the NOGAPS model, which predicted a continued westward motion across central Florida. The official forecast changed early on September 23 to bring Jeanne across northeastern Florida, though initially the cyclone was predicted to turn northeastward and hit South Carolina as a hurricane. By September 23, Jeanne had begun a slow westward motion, with its previously well-defined eye becoming ragged. It moved slowly over waters it traversed just four days prior, causing upwelling; this is the process in which a stationary storm causes the water temperatures to decrease by bringing the cooler, deeper waters to the surface. As a result, Jeanne weakened to a minimal hurricane midday on September 23, though it was forecast to re- intensify and attain major hurricane status. By early on September 24, the winds had decreased to 80 mph (130 km/h); its convection weakened in intensity, and the eyewall eroded due to dry air entrainment. However, as Jeanne moved toward an area of warmer waters, deep convection redeveloped around the eye. Its favorable upper-level environment allowed the outflow to become better defined, with a large eye and nearby dry air being the primary restraining factors for development. At 1200 UTC on September 25, Jeanne attained major hurricane status, and two hours later it made landfall on Abaco Island. Hurricane Jeanne near landfall After it had been previously forecast to turn northwestward and track along the northeastern Florida coast, the forecast shifted 24 hours prior to moving ashore to a landfall point in the east-central portion of the state; the change was due to the persistence of the ridge to its north. The hurricane moved over Grand Bahama Island, and in the Bahamas it produced wind gusts of up to 130 mph (210 km/h). As it approached the Florida coastline it did not strengthen much further, due to an eyewall replacement cycle; this is the process in which an outer eyewall forms, causing the original eye to shrink and dissipate due to lack of moisture. At 0400 UTC on September 26, Jeanne made landfall with peak winds of 120 mph (195 km/h) on the southern end of Hutchinson Island near Stuart, Florida, with an eye 50 mi (85 km) in diameter. The hurricane moved ashore in almost the same location as Hurricane Frances, which made landfall 21 days prior. Upon moving inland in east-central Florida, the hurricane produced a storm tide of up to 10 feet (3 m) in St. Lucie County. In New Smyrna Beach, the storm tide washed away much of the beach to the east of the city seawall. Overall impact from the storm tide was less than expected, due to the storm hitting at low tide. Jeanne produced peak winds of 120 mph (195 km/h) in a very small north of the center near Sebastian, though the National Hurricane Center noted the possibility of the strongest winds remaining over water. The National Weather Service office in Melbourne recorded sustained winds of 91 mph (147 km/h), which was the strongest official sustained wind reading; stronger readings were not available due to widespread power outages along its track. Wind gusts peaked at 128 mph (206 km/h) in Fort Pierce. In addition to the winds, the hurricane dropped heavy rainfall in the vicinity of its eyewall, peaking at 11.97 inches (304 mm) in Kenansville. The rainfall caused freshwater flooding, as well as increased levels along the St. Johns River. The hurricane also produced several eyewall mesovortices and tornadoes near where it moved ashore.  Dissipation  Rainfall summary for Hurricane Jeanne As Hurricane Jeanne moved inland, its inner eyewall dissipated, and its outer eyewall quickly became less distinct. It turned west-northwestward over the state, curving around the western periphery of the ridge to its northeast. By 14 hours after landfall, Jeanne weakened to tropical storm status near the Tampa Bay area. In western Florida, offshore winds produced a tide of 4.5 feet (1.4 m) below normal in Cedar Key; however, after the storm passed the area, the onshore winds produced above normal tides. Despite initial forecasts that it would emerge into the Gulf of Mexico, the storm remained over land and continued to slowly weaken. Early on September 27, dry air became entrained into the southern periphery of the circulation, which diminished the thunderstorms to the south. After turning northward, Jeanne entered southern Georgia and weakened into a tropical depression. As it moved northward, Jeanne continued to drop moderate to heavy rainfall, including over 7 inches (175 mm) in southern Georgia. A cold front across the region caused the depression to accelerate northeastward, combining moisture from the Gulf of Mexico with cool and stable air over the Carolinas. This combination produced severe thunderstorms across the region, spawning six tornadoes in Georgia, eight in South Carolina, and eight in North Carolina. After crossing into Virginia, Jeanne transitioned into an extratropical cyclone by September 29 near Washington, D.C. In Wilmington, Delaware, the storm spawned an F2 tornado. Across the Mid-Atlantic and New England, moisture from the storm produced light to heavy rainfall, with totals of over 7 inches (175 mm) near Philadelphia and Nantucket. Subsequent to becoming extratropical, the remnants of Jeanne turned eastward, exited into the Atlantic Ocean, and merged with a cold front.

The majority of his books were popularisations of the archaeology of ancient Egypt. His book about the Carthaginian general, Hannibal: Enemy of Rome, is notable in its preparation: Cottrell traveled the ostensible path Hannibal took across the Alps into the Po River valley and incorporated his personal findings with his research in the book's narrative. Details Leonard Cottrell was born 21 May 1913 at Tettenhall, Wolverhampton to William and Beatrice Cottrell(n√©e Tootell). His father inspired an interest in history at the age of ten. At King Edward's Grammar School, Birmingham, Leonard was only interested in history and English, reading widely. In the 1930s, Cottrell toured the English countryside on his motorcycle, visiting prehistoric stone circles, burial mounds of the Bronze Age, medieval and Renaissance monuments. On those journeys, he was often accompanied by Doris Swain, whom he later married, although the marriage was dissolved in 1962. After gaining experience writing articles on historical subjects for motoring magazines, he wrote his first documentary for the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) in 1937. Leonard was rejected by the RAF during World War II, for medical reasons, but he joined the BBC in 1942 and they stationed him, in 1944, in the Mediterranean with the RAF as a war correspondent. His experiences as a war correspondent formed the basis of his book All Men are Neighbours (1947). He worked at the BBC until 1960, when he resigned and moved to a house overlooking the estuary of the River Kent in Westmoreland, Cumbria, where he stayed for the rest of his life, writing. He was the editor of the Concise Encyclopaedia of Archaeology (1965).

In 1896, he changed his last name to Moln√°r to be more successful as a writer. Originally, he studied law in his hometown of Budapest and then in Geneva. He eventually left this track to return to his love of journalism. When he was eighteen, he began writing for a Budapest newspaper. His most famous works, both plays and novels, are his earliest works. One of his most successful plays was Liliom in 1909. In 1945, this play would become the well known Oscar and Hammerstein musical, Carousel. Other famous plays include The Devil in 1907, The Guardsman written in 1910 and then translated in 1924, The Wolf in 1913, and The Swan in 1921. The Swan was made into a film in 1956 and starred Grace Kelly. He wrote forty plays total. After he worked as a correspondent during World War I, he spent most of his time living in Europe. Then, in 1936, he immigrated to the United States. Once he became a citizen, Moln√°r married three times. On April 2, 1952, Ferenc Moln√°r died in New York City.Moln√°r, Ferenc. (1996).

Synopsis Act I Konrad impatiently waits for Lu to arrive for their dinner date. Lu has Konrad fooled into thinking that she is married to a successful lawyer and is afraid that they will be caught together. Konrad is crazy for Lu, but she doesn't seem to feel the same way. She insists that he call the minister who was supposed have joined them on their date. When exits, Lu is left alone with the Head Waiter, who she apparently knows from somewhere. She expresses that she is not as well off as she has told Konrad she is and has many old debts from pretending to be wealthy. She calls herself a good fairy because she seems to bring everyone except herself good luck. When Konrad returns, he expresses he would like her husband to be his business attorney. He leaves to take a phone call. Lu takes this opportunity to look in the phonebook for a lawyer who she can pretend is her husband. She tells Konrad her husband's name is Dr. Max Sporum and makes him promise not to mention her when he calls him. The minister, Dr. Metz, finally shows up extremely drunk. He tries to get Lu to open up about her husband. She becomes very flustered and tells Konrad to get the check and a taxi. Dr. Metz leaves to make Lu feel better. As Konrad leaves, he and Lu share their first kiss. When he is finally gone, the Head Waiter suggests there is chemistry between them from the past. He says he wants to marry her. Lu doesn't say no, but instead tells him, \\"Not now.\\" Act II Dr. Max Sporum is eating lunch in his office with his secretary Karoline. They talk about all of the collectors that will be coming today to collect his many debts. Karoline tells Max about Konrad's inquiry for a business attorney. Both of them believe it must be some kind of joke. Lu arrives at the office and tells Max about what she has done, from her old job as an usherette to finding him in the phone book and calling him her husband. Dr. Sporum finds her story completely preposterous. Konrad arrives and, as promised, acts like he does not know Lu. At the end of the act, Max decides to take Konrad's offer. Act III With his new income, Dr. Sporum outfits his office with everything he has always wanted. Lu enters and tells him that she did not go to Konrad the previous evening. Instead she went to see another man and Konrad caught her. Moments later, Konrad arrives at the office so Lu runs too hide. Konrad quickly tells Dr. Sporum what he saw last night. He followed the taxi that took Lu to the Head Waiter's house. He then tells Sporum that he must break their contract. When Lu returns, she tells Konrad that she and Sporum are getting a divorce because she is with another man. The Head Waiter enters. He announces that he and Lu are engaged and are opening a restaurant. Lu asks Sporum if he would be their attorney. He agrees, but seems less than thrilled about the idea. She slowly exits watching Sporum half-heartedly sharpen his pencils. Epilogue The manager enters and reads a letter from Ferenc Moln√°r about how too many playwrights today are leaving their audiences hanging. The curtain rises on a scene that takes place ten years later. Lu and Karoline are setting up for Lu's wedding anniversary. The Head Waiter is the first to arrive. He talks about how his restaurant was a failure and that he and Lu never married. Sporum enters. He is now a university professor and has married Karoline. Konrad is the next to enter, but he is not married to Lu either. Finally, Dr. Metz, enters. He is the one who Lu has married and now works for Konrad.

It was founded in 1944Cowger, Thomas W. The National Congress of American Indians: The Founding Years. Lincoln, NE: University of Nebraska Press, 1999. to represent the tribes and resist federal government pressure for termination of tribal rights and assimilation of their people. These were in contradiction of their treaty rights and status as sovereign entities. The organization continues to be an association of federally recognized and state- recognized Indian tribes. History J.T. Goombi (Kiowa) former first vice- president of the National Congress of American Indians Historically the Indian peoples of the North American continent rarely joined forces across tribal lines, which were divisions related to distinct language and cultural groups. One reason was that most tribes were highly decentralized, with their people seldom united around issues. In the 20th century, a generation of Native Americans came of age who were educated in multi-tribal boarding schools. They began to think with a broad pan-Native American vision, and they learned to form alliances across tribes. They increasingly felt the need to work together politically in order to exert their power in dealing with the United States federal government. In addition, with the efforts after 1934 to reorganize tribal governments, activists believed that Indians had to work together to strengthen their political position. Activists formed the National Congress of American Indians to find ways to organize the tribes to deal in a more unified way with the US government. They wanted to challenge the government on its failure to implement treaties, to work against the tribal termination policy, and to improve public opinion of and appreciation for Indian cultures. The initial organization of the NCAI was done largely by Native American men who worked for the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and represented many tribes. Among this group was D'Arcy McNickle of the BIA. At the second national convention, Indian women attended as representatives in numbers equal to the men. The convention decided that BIA employees should be excluded from serving as general officers or members of the executive committee. The first president of the NCAI was Napoleon B. Johnson, a judge in Oklahoma. Dan Madrano (Caddo) was the first secretary-treasurer; he also had been serving as an elected member of the Oklahoma State Legislature.Alison R. Bernstein. American Indian and World War II: Toward a New Era in Indian Affairs (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1991) p. 116-119 From 1945 to 1952, the executive secretary of the NCAI was Ruth Muskrat Bronson (Cherokee), who established the organization's legislative news service. Bronson's work was largely voluntary, as the organization could not afford to pay her to act as its executive secretary. In 1950 John Rainer became the first paid executive director of NCAI. He was replaced by Bronson in 1951, who resigned in 1952. Frank George, a Nez Perce from the Colville Indian Reservation, briefly held the post before Helen Peterson (Cheyenne-Lakota) took over the post as the executive director of the organization in 1953. That same year, W. W. Short replaced Johnson as president of NCAI. In 1954, Short was replaced by Joseph Garry (Coeur d'Alene), a veteran of both World War II and the Korean War. Garry significantly enlarged the organizational direction away from its focus on issues of Native Americans in the Great Plains and the Southwest, making it more inclusive of tribes in the Midwest and Northwest. In 1966, the NCAI mustered nearly 80 tribal leaders from 62 tribes to protest their exclusion from a US-Congress sponsored conference on reorganizing the BIA (Bureau of Indian Affairs). The Congressional event was organized by Morris Udall, chairman of the House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, to discuss the reorganization of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Udall eventually allowed the NCAI representatives to attend. He confirmed that a group composed of tribe members, called the Tribal Advisory Commission, would be created to advise him. During the late 20th century, NCAI contributed to gaining legislation to protect and preserve Indian culture, including NAGPRA. They worked with the tribes to assert their sovereignty in dealing with the federal government. In the early 21st century, key goals of the NCAI are: * Enforce for Indians all rights under the Constitution and laws in the United States; * Expand and improve educational opportunities provided for Indians; * Improve methods for finding productive employment and developing tribal and individual resources; * Increase number and quality of health facilities; * Settle Indian claims equitably; and * Preserve Indian cultural values. In 2017, the NCAI took over the assets of the Indian Country Media Network, which were donated by the Oneida Nation of New York. It had owned and operated the network for some time. The NCAI continues to operate the news service, primarily online. It reports on Native American news and has especially covered politics in depth. Constitution The NCAI Constitution says that its members seek to provide themselves and their descendants with the traditional laws, rights, and benefits. It lists the by-laws and rules of order regarding membership, powers, and dues. There are four classes of membership: tribal, Indian individual, individual associate, and organization associate. Voting right is reserved for tribal and Indian individual members. According to section B of Article III regarding membership, any tribe, band or group of American Indians and Alaska Natives shall be eligible for tribal membership provided it fulfills the following requirementsNCAI by-laws and constitution * A substantial number of its members reside upon the same reservation or (in the absence of a reservation) in the same general locality. * It maintain a Tribal organization, with regular officers and the means of transacting business and arriving at a reasonably accurate count of its membership; * It is not a mere offshoot or fraction of an organized Tribe itself eligible for membership * It is recognized as a Tribe or other identifiable group of Native Americans by the Department of the Interior, Court of Claims, the Indian Claims Commission, or a State. An Indian or Alaska Native organization incorporated/chartered under state law is not eligible for tribal membership. Organizational structure The organizational structure of the National Congress of American Indians includes a General Assembly, an Executive Council, and seven committees. The up-and-coming executive Board of the NCAI is as follows: * President: Fawn Sharp of the Quinault Indian Nation * First Vice President: Aaron Payment of the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe * Secretary: Juana Majel Dixon of the Pauma Band of Luiseno Mission Indians * Treasurer: Clinton Lageson Kenaitze Indian Tribe. In addition to these four positions, the NCAI executive board also consists of twelve area vice-presidents and twelve alternative area vice-presidents.  Chief Executive Officer  The current chief executive officer of the National Congress of American Indians is Kevin Allis, member of the Forest County Potawatomi Community in Wisconsin. Chuck Trimble was the former chief executive. Voting Every tribe gets a number of votes allocated to them specific to the size of each tribe. Achievements The successes of the NCAI over these years have been a policy of non-protesting. During the 1960s NCAI carried a banner with the slogan, \\"INDIANS DON'T DEMONSTRATE.\\"Shreve, Bradley G. \\"From Time Immemorial: The Fish-in Movement and the Rise of the Intertribal Activism.\\" Pacific Historical Review. 78.3 (2009): 403-434 * In 1949, the NCAI made charges against Federal job bias towards the Indians * In 1950, the NCAI influenced the insertion of an anti- reservation clause to the Alaska Statehood Act. This clause removes the ban against reservations for Alaskan Natives. * On July 8, 1954, NCAI won their fight against legislation that would have allowed the states to take civil and criminal jurisdictions over Indians. * On June 19, 1952, a self-help parley was opened in Utah where 50 agents for 12 groups proposed several self-help action plans * Indians had conventions nationwide and dealt with various topics such as health care, employment, and safety issues * In 2015 the organization successfully lobbied the State of California to ban the term \\"redskins\\" which is the name of a pro football team in Washington, from being used by public schools in the state of California. Internal policy differences In the early 1960s, a shift in attitude occurred. Many young American Indians branded the older generation as sell-outs and called for harsh militancy. Two important militant groups were born: the American Indian Movement (AIM) and the National Indian Youth Council (NIYC). The two groups protested several conventions. Ongoing issues The advertising firm of DeVito/Verdi created a poster for the NCAI to highlight stereotypical Native American mascots. The NCAI is fighting for improved living conditions on reservations, arguing that 560 tribes are federally recognized but fewer than 20 tribes gain profits from casinos to turn the tribe's economy around. According to the NCAI website, other current issues and topics include: * \\"Protection of programs and services to benefit Indian families, specifically targeting Indian Youth and elders * Promotion and support of Indian education, including Head Start, elementary, post-secondary and Adult Education * Enhancement of Indian health care, including prevention of juvenile substance abuse, HIV-AIDS prevention and other major diseases * Support of environmental protection and natural resources management * Protection of Indian cultural resources and religious freedom rights * Promotion of the Rights of Indian economic opportunity both on and off reservations, including securing programs to provide incentives for economic development and the attraction of private capital to Indian Country * Protection of the Rights of all Indian people to decent, safe and affordable housing.\\"\\"Our History.\\" National Congress of American Indians. (retrieved December 20, 2009) In 2001, the advertising firm of DeVito/Verdi created an advertising campaign and poster for the NCAI to highlight offensive and racist sports team images and mascots. In October 2013, the NCAI published a report on sports teams using harmful and racial \\"Indian\\" mascots.

He immediately began extensive re-fortification to make the castle suitable for firearms. Nanstein is well known for an elaborate siege during the Knights' Revolt in 1523 which claimed the life of von Sickingen. The fall of Nanstein was a symbol for the decline of castles in the Palatinate. In 1542, von Sickingen's sons recovered Nanstein as a fief and started reconstruction of the castle. Reinhard von Sickingen completed the reconstruction in 1595. In 1668, Elector Charles I Louis forced Lotharingian troops from the castle and destroyed the fortifications. In the 19th century the first conservation work was done on Nanstein, and has continued to the present.http://www.burglemberg.de/engl/burgreg/nanstein/index.htm ReferencesExternal links Nanstein Castle on burg-nanstein.de *Nanstein Castle on nanstein.de Category:Castles in Rhineland-Palatinate Category:Ruined castles in Germany Category:Buildings and structures in Kaiserslautern (district) ","title":"Nanstein Castle"},{"id":"18017243","text":"Fernando Sor This is a list of compositions by Fernando Sor.\\"The Guitar Review\\", Vol. 1, Nr. 1.

His 1956 book They Knew Too Much About Flying Saucers introduced the notion of the Men in Black to UFO folklore. Recent evidence indicates that he was skeptical of most UFO claims, and mainly wrote about the paranormal for financial gain. He sometimes participated in hoaxes to deceive more serious UFO investigators. Life A native of Riffle, Braxton County, West Virginia, Barker graduated from Glenville State College in 1947. In 1952, he was working as a theater booker in Clarksburg, West Virginia when he began collecting stories about the Flatwoods Monster, an alleged extraterrestrial reported by residents of nearby Braxton County. Barker submitted an article about the creature to FATE Magazine, and shortly afterwards began writing regular pieces about UFOs for Space Review, a magazine published by Albert K. Bender's International Flying Saucer Bureau.Danny Forinash. \\"55 good things about West Virginia: Men in Black a state native's handiwork\\". State Journal. May 27, 2005. GT10. In 1953, Albert K. Bender abruptly dissolved his organization, claiming that he could not continue writing about UFOs because of \\"orders from a higher source\\". After pressing Bender for more details, Barker wrote his first book, They Knew Too Much About Flying Saucers, which was published by University Books in 1956.Jerome Clark. Unexplained! 2nd Edition. Farmington Hills, Michigan: Visible Ink Press, 1999. 452. The book was the first to describe the Men in Black, a group of mysterious figures who, according to UFO conspiracy theorists, intimidate individuals into keeping silent about UFOs. Barker recounted Bender's own alleged encounters with the Men in Black, who were said to travel in groups of three, wear black suits, and drive large black automobiles. In 1962, Barker and Bender collaborated on a second book on the topic, called Flying Saucers and the Three Men. Published under Barker's own imprint, Saucerian Books, this book proposed that the Men in Black were, themselves, extraterrestrials. Over the next two decades, Barker continued writing books about UFOs and other paranormal phenomena. One of these was 1970's The Silver Bridge, which linked the collapse of the Silver Bridge in Point Pleasant, West Virginia with the appearance of an alleged paranormal creature known as Mothman. The book preceded John Keel's The Mothman Prophecies by five years. Before dying in 1984, Barker wrote a final book about the Men in Black, called MIB: The Secret Terror Among Us. Opinions on the paranormal Though his books advocated the existence of UFOs and extraterrestrials, Barker was privately skeptical of the paranormal. His sister Blanch explained that Barker only wrote the books for the money, and his friend James W. Moseley said Barker \\"pretty much took all of UFOlogy as a joke\\". In a letter to John C. Sherwood, who had submitted materials to Saucerian Books as a teenager, Barker referred to his paranormal writings as his \\"kookie books\\".John C. Sherwood. \\"Gray Barker's Book of Bunk: Mothman, Saucers, and MIB\\" . Skeptical Inquirer. May/June 2002. Retrieved on June 18, 2008. Barker occasionally engaged in deliberate hoaxes to deceive UFO enthusiasts. In 1957, for example, Barker and Moseley wrote a fake letter (signed \\"R.E. Straith\\") to self-claimed \\"contactee\\" George Adamski, telling Adamski that the United States Department of State was pleased with Adamski's research into UFOs. The letter was written on State Department stationery, and Barker himself described it as \\"one of the great unsolved mysteries of the UFO field\\" in his 1967 Book of Adamski. According to Sherwood's Skeptical Inquirer article \\"Gray Barker: My Friend, the Myth-Maker\\", there may have been \\"a grain of truth\\" to Barker's writings on the Men in Black, in that the United States Air Force and other government agencies did attempt to discourage public interest in UFOs during the 1950s. However, Barker is thought to have greatly embellished the facts of the situation. In the same Skeptical Inquirer article, Sherwood revealed that, in the late 1960s, he and Barker collaborated on a brief fictional notice alluding to the Men in Black, which was published as fact first in Raymond A. Palmer's Flying Saucers magazine and some of Barker's own publications. In the story, Sherwood (writing as \\"Dr. Richard H. Pratt\\") claimed he was ordered to silence by the \\"blackmen\\" after learning that UFOs were time-travelling vehicles. Barker later wrote to Sherwood, \\"Evidently the fans swallowed this one with a gulp.\\"John C. Sherwood. \\"Gray Barker: My Friend, the Myth-Maker\\" . Skeptical Inquirer. May/June 1998. Retrieved on June 19, 2008. Legacy The concept of the Men in Black, which Barker introduced in They Knew Too Much About Flying Saucers, has become a major part of UFO lore. The book inspired a fictional comic book written by Lowell Cunningham, which in turn inspired a popular film and animated television series. Barker himself became the subject of two documentary films: Whispers From Space (1995), which was created by The Last Prom,Whispers from Space Official Website.

In its Gray Barker Room at the Waldomore, the Clarksburg-Harrison Public Library in West Virginia holds a collection of Gray Barker's writings, as well as files of correspondence between Barker and notable figures of the UFO field from the 1950s to the early 1980s such as George Adamski, Howard Menger, James Moseley, and others.

The school has approximately 1,165 pupils from ages 11 to 18. Main school The school is split into two main blocks designated A and B. A block is home to the English, Geography and History departments. It also holds the main school library and the staff room. B block houses the maths, science and modern foreign languages departments as well as the hall, school office, head teacher's office and head of year offices. The Art and Design Technology departments have a separate block as does the Music department. In 2014, Diss High School received a 'good' rating from Ofsted. Academics The school supplements the formal with a wide range of extra- curricular activities that go beyond sport and music =Curriculum= Virtually all maintained schools and academies follow the National Curriculum, and are inspected by Ofsted on how well they succeed in delivering a 'broad and balanced curriculum'. The school has to decide whether Key Stage 3 contains years 7, 8 and 9- or whether year 9 should be in Key Stage 4 and the students just study subjects that will be examined by the GCSE exams at 16. Diss has chosen the latter route. ;Key Stage 3 In the first two years all students follow a basic course comprising Art, Design Technology, English, Drama, PSHEE, Geography, History, Food, French, Spanish, Computing, Mathematics, Music, Religious Studies and Science. ;Key Stage 4 Currently all pupils study English, Mathematics, Science, Physical Education, Computing, a Modern Foreign Language (French or Spanish), a Humanities subject (History or Geography), Careers, Religious Studies and PSHEE. They opt to study two other GCSE subjects. To make a language compulsory at Key Stage 4 is unusual. Staff turnover has made it difficult to deliver good results and depressed the number of youngsters obtaining the English Baccalaureate that requires it. Uniform In February 2014, the school featured in several media reports after it announced a ban on skirts as part of the school uniform, to begin the following September. The ban received support from some parents and criticism from others. The governing body supported the ban with Norfolk County Council stating that it is for the school to set rules and regulations on uniform.  Notable alumni  Diss High School and its predecessor schools have been attended by several notable former pupils. These include footballers Matthew Upson and Declan Rudd. Politician Ralph Howell, businessman Eric Nicoli and Church of England clergyman Christopher Dalliston all attended Diss Grammar School. Painter and etcher James Henry Govier taught art at the Grammar School between 1965 and 1972 after it merged with the grammar school in Eye.

The screenplay by Vincent Lawrence and Sylvia Thalberg was based on the story \\"Honor Bright\\" by Jack Kirkland and Melville Baker. The film stars Gary Cooper, Carole Lombard, and Shirley Temple in a story about a small-time swindler going straight for his child's sake. Temple sang \\"The World Owes Me a Living\\". The film was critically well received. Temple adored Cooper, who nicknamed her 'Wigglebritches'. This is the only film in which Lombard and Temple appeared together. Plot summary Carefree, irresponsible Jerry Day (Gary Cooper) and his second wife, Toni (Carole Lombard), are running up a bill at a Shanghai hotel that Jerry has no means to pay. Jerry hatches a scheme to swindle other guests to get money to pay his hotel bill and the two escape to the next leg of their foreign vacation. Desperate for more cash, Jerry is willing to sell the custody rights of his 5-year-old daughter Penelope, nicknamed Penny (Shirley Temple), whom he has never met, to his former brother-in-law. Toni is shocked and goes by herself to Paris, while Cooper meets his daughter and is captivated by her, deciding to retain custody after all. Penny and Jerry arrive in Paris to be reunited with Toni, who will now play her mother. After selling a nonexistent gold mine to Felix Evans (Sir Guy Standing), a man who turns out to be much more versed in the art of swindling than he, Jerry decides to re-enter the workforce as a real estate salesman, but is not very successful. Soon he finds himself in need of cash to support himself, Penny and Toni. Jerry meets up again with Evans, who had paid with a phony check, and Evans convinces Jerry to steal a valuable necklace from Mrs. Crane (Charlotte Granville), a rich lady Penny has befriended. Mrs. Crane tells Jerry that she wants to adopt Penny, and offers to throw a party for her. During the party, Jerry spots one of Mrs. Crane's expensive necklaces lying out on her dresser and steals it, hiding it in Penny's teddy bear. The police are called and all the guests are searched but the necklace is not found. When Penny is put to bed, she cuddles her teddy bear and discovers the necklace hidden inside. She asks Jerry if he stole it and he says no. To get her to stop crying, Toni tells Penny that it was she who took the necklace so really Jerry was telling the truth. Penny is again satisfied that her father did not lie. Jerry brings the necklace to Evans to resell it, but starts feeling guilty when Penny throws all her faith and love towards Jerry for being honest. He goes back to try to recover the necklace and threatens Evans with a gun; Evans shoots back and wounds Jerry, but Jerry kills Evans. Jerry returns the necklace to Mrs. Crane, who agrees to lie that the necklace was not stolen at all, but mislaid. Mrs. Crane then takes Penny off to boarding school, while Jerry, suffering from his untreated gunshot wound, and Toni say goodbye to her. Though Jerry does not want to go to a doctor lest the police be involved, he collapses as he tries to get back in the car and Toni takes him to a hospital. Lying in a hospital bed with a police officer standing nearby, Jerry ruminates that it is not so bad coming clean after all. Cast * Gary Cooper as Jerry Day * Carole Lombard as Toni Day * Shirley Temple as Penelope \\"Penny\\" Day * Sir Guy Standing as Felix Evans * Charlotte Granville as Mrs. Crane * Gilbert Emery as James Higginson * Henry Kolker as Mr. Clark * Tetsu Komai as Mr. Ling Production Shirley Temple was loaned out to Paramount by Fox Films for $3,500 a week in what would be her second film at Paramount. It would also be the first film in which a stand-in (Marilyn Granas) was hired for Temple. Temple had a good rapport with the adult crew, especially Gary Cooper, who bought her several toys and made a number of sketches for her. During the making of the movie, Dorothy Dell, who co-starred with Temple in Little Miss Marker and developed a close personal friendship with her, died in an automobile accident. Temple was not told about this until filming started on the crying scene in the film in which her character finds out her father was lying to her about stealing the jewelry. The tears she was crying in that scene were in effect real tears.Shirley Temple Black, \\"Child Star: An Autobiography\\" (New York: McGraw-Hill Publishing Company, 1988), 60-65. In the film Temple sings \\"The World Owes Me a Living\\",Available on a version of which also featured in a Silly Symphonies animation of The Ant and the GrasshopperAvailable on in the same year. =Alternate ending= The film was originally filmed with a different ending, in which Jerry and Toni drive alongside the train tracks as Penny and Mrs. Crane depart on the train. Jerry succumbs to his gunshot wound en route and Toni takes over the wheel, steering the car over an embankment and killing herself as well. The ending was re- scripted and re-filmed by Paramount to match the lighter tone of the rest of the film. Release Now and Forever was released on August 31, 1934. It was popular at the box office.Churchill, Douglas W. The Year in Hollywood: 1934 May Be Remembered as the Beginning of the Sweetness-and-Light Era (gate locked); New York Times [New York, N.Y] 30 Dec 1934: X5. Retrieved December 16, 2013. Critical reception The New York Times thought the film \\"a sentimental melodrama\\" and \\"a pleasant enough entertainment\\". It gives high praise to Temple, citing her \\"enormous charm\\", \\"unspoiled freshness of manner\\", and \\"total absence of self-consciousness\\" for giving the script authenticity and rescuing it from total incredulity. Louella Parsons was amazed \\"at the ease with which [Temple] reels off her lines, saying big words and expressions. There is nothing parrot-like about Shirley. She knows what she is talking about\\". Temple-fever spread with the release of the film. Her fan mail (which numbered 400-500 letters a day) was delivered in huge mail sacks to the studio and a secretary was hired to manage it. In her 2015 book Shirley Temple and the Performance of Girlhood, Kristen Hatch casts the entire screenplay as a commentary on the tension between the grown-up, capitalist marketplace and the unburdened fantasy life of childhood. The character of Jerry is locked in childhood and imagination, unable to hold down a real job and constantly reverting to carefree and irresponsible fun and games. His daughter Penny, as a child who is removed from the \\"cynical and rational world of the capitalist marketplace\\", is the perfect person to save him, but she is in danger of losing her own innocence by being paired with a criminal father. Penny does ultimately serve as Jerry's savior, for her faith in him to always tell the truth impels him to risk his life to retrieve what he stole and maintain that faith. Hatch also notes the constant references to money (including the child's name, Penny), bills, and checks, reinforcing the theme of the capitalist marketplace.

It was written by Herbert Fields and Joseph Fields with additional dialogue by Irving Brecher, and uncredited contributions by others based on the unproduced 1936 play Return Engagement by Nancy Hamilton, James Shute and Rosemary Casey. The songs are by Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart. Fools for Scandal is now best remembered as one of Lombard's worst films and one that set her on the course for seeking dramatic roles for the next few years. Plot Film star Kay Winters (Carole Lombard) is traveling through Paris under a wig and the pseudonym of Kay Summers with her maid and companion Myrtle (Marie Wilson). She meets Rene (Fernand Gravet), a French marquis who has lost all his money and has pawned all his material possessions to live, something Paris society does not know. He sees her on the street and offers to give her a tour of the real Paris. Kay, who already had plans to attend dinner with Lady Paula Malverton (Isabel Jeans), tries to brush him off, only to become charmed by the persistent and impetuous Rene. Once finished with the tour, they have dinner, and unexpectedly run into Lady Malverton and her party. Lady Malverton calls Rene over to her table. When he returns, he discovers that Kay has left. However, she left a note asking him to lunch with her the following day. Kay returns to her hotel, to see Phillip Chester (Ralph Bellamy) waiting for her, the man who is in love with her. The next day, Kay is waiting by the fountain and Rene discovers that he has overslept. His friend, Dewey Gilson (Allen Jenkins), has taken too long getting Rene's suit from the pawn shop. Rene waits, helplessly, as Kay prepares to leave. However, he runs down and obtains two carpets from a salesman, wrapping them around himself as a form of wealthy robe. He alerts Kay that he will be ready to have lunch in just a while, but two women, who believe that he is selling the carpets, demand to buy them. In an argument about who can buy the carpets between the women and Kay, the carpets are pulled from Rene and he runs away in his underwear. Later, Rene discovers that Kay is actually a movie star. Before he can contact her, however, she leaves for London. Rene follows her. He comes to her house at a party in which Kay has ordered her guests to appear in animal masks. Upon seeing Rene, she invites him to dinner, where Lady Malverton tells him to demonstrate his skills as a chef. After tasting the food that Rene prepares, Kay, as a joke, offers him a job as her cook. Rene, delighted, accepts without Kay knowing. Meanwhile, Phillip begs Kay to marry him, but she again postpones her answer. Lady Malverton finds Rene in the kitchen, where he tells her that he has taken the job of being Kay's chef. Lady Malverton spreads the gossip. The following morning, Kay is delivered breakfast by Rene and begs him to leave. Rene tells her he has no such intention and answers the phone several times and tells everyone he is Kay's chef. Lady Malverton arrives with a swarm of gossips and demands to know the truth. Kay tells them that she has hired him as a chef. Nonetheless, the tabloids are already running reports that Rene is Kay's \\"love chef\\". Kay, undaunted, accepts Phillip's proposal of marriage and orders an engagement dinner. Rene does his best to spoil the dinner and succeeds, with Phillip walking out of the house after a quarrel with Kay. Rene finally gets Kay to admit she loves him, but she tells him that she will not marry him, as the difference in social status between them will earn her the derision of everyone she knows. Rene tells her that he is a French marquis and leaves, angered by her silly fears. Kay follows him into an opera house where they kiss before an unexpected audience. Cast * Carole Lombard as Kay Winters * Fernand Gravet as Rene Vilardell * Ralph Bellamy as Philip Chester * Allen Jenkins as Dewey Gilson * Isabel Jeans as Lady Paula Malverton * Marie Wilson as Myrtle * Marcia Ralston as Jill * Tola Nesmith as Agnes * Heather Thatcher as Lady Potter-Porter * Jacques Lory as Papa Joli-Coeur * Tempie Piggott as Bessie Cast notes: *Fools for Scandal featured a cameo by Lombard's beloved Pekingese, Pushface, and was the third pairing of Lombard and Bellamy. Production The working title of the film, which was originally planned to be filmed in Technicolor, was \\"Food for Scandal\\"; both titles were inspired by Sheridan's classic play The School for Scandal. The film was Lombard's first and last for Warner Bros., and Mervyn LeRoy's last: afterward, he went to MGM.Miller, Frank. \\"Fools for Scandal\\" (article) on TCM.com. Fernand Gravet came to Warners after having achieved considerable success in French films under the name \\"Fernand Gravey\\", but the failure of Fools for Scandal prevented him from achieving star status in the United States. He made one other film in the US, The Great Waltz for MGM, before returning to France. Warners borrowed Ted Tetzlaff, Lombard's favorite cinematographer, from Paramount Pictures for the film, so that Lombard would be comfortable with how she was shot. She later said that she knew Fools for Scandal was a flop \\"when my friends confined their comments to how beautifully I had been photographed\\". Unfortunately for her, she was never able to work with Tetzlaff again. Reception Fools for Scandal was an enormous box office failure. Although Lombard considered The Gay Bride her worst film, many contemporary fans give Fools for Scandal that distinction. Lombard lacked chemistry with Gravet; and audiences, who had already begun tiring of the \\"screwball comedy\\" genre, noted a similarity between the plots of Fools for Scandal and Lombard's previous screwball film, My Man Godfrey. Fools's failure prompted Lombard to pursue only dramatic roles for the next few years, until she joined Alfred Hitchcock and Robert Montgomery for 1941's 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith'.

The manga and anime focused on Japanese schoolgirl Sakura Kinomoto who finds the magical Clow Book in her father's basement study, accidentally unleashing the magical Clow Cards loose across her hometown Tomoeda. Dubbed the Cardcaptor by the cards' guardian Cerberus (better known as Kero-chan), Sakura must wield the Clow Staff to capture the card spirits and turn them back into cards for her use. Sakura is aided by her best friend Tomoyo Daidouji, who creates battle costumes for her as well as videotaping her ventures as Cardcaptor; and later by Syaoran Li, a Chinese boy who is a direct descendant of the Clow Cards' creator Clow Reed. The anime also introduced a fourth companion, Meiling Li (sometimes spelled as Meilin Li), Syaoran's cousin. The rest of the characters are mostly oblivious to Sakura's magical life, aside from her brother Toya who has his own magical powers, and later Eriol Hiiragizawa, who is a reincarnated Clow Reed. The anime was dubbed into English by Nelvana under the title of Cardcaptors, with most of the character names changed to English ones with the exception of Sakura, Meilin, Kero, Mr. Terada, Wang Wei, Ruby Moon, Yue, and Clow Reed. A large number of the characters reappear as alternate selves in Clamp's other series, Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle and xxxHolic. Main charactersSakura Kinomoto= is the titular heroine of Cardcaptor Sakura, named after the Japanese word for \\"cherry blossom\\". She is a daughter of Nadeshiko Kinomoto whom has passed away when she was 3. Her most defining character traits are her unyielding determination, caring nature and loyalty to her friends. Sakura is portrayed as a perceptively sweet, extremely energetic and cheerful character who is well-loved, pretty, cheerful, cute and at times a na√Øve, clumsy, and clueless. Sakura is athletically gifted and skilled in sports at school, being an excellent runner and called the \\"best baton twirler in school\\" by her friends.Cardcaptor Sakura, Episode 1 Sakura and the Mysterious Magic Book She hates math and is openly phasmophobic. Sakura maintains a crush on Yukito Tsukishiro for most of the manga and anime, but when she finally confesses to Yukito, she is gently rejected by revealing his love for her big brother Touya, and she realizes that she loved him because of his resemblance to her father Fujitaka. Eventually, Sakura realizes she is actually in love with Syaoran, but doesn't realize her feelings until he first confesses his love for her. Although she fails to admit her feelings in the final episode, Sakura later manages to finally confess her love to Syaoran when he and Meiling return to visit in the series movie, Cardcaptor Sakura Movie 2: The Sealed Card. She becomes the titular Cardcaptor by guardian beast Cerberus after accidentally opening and releasing the Clow Cards from the Clow Book. Aided by Cerberus, her best friend and cousin Tomoyo Daidouji, and later Syaoran, Sakura successfully captures all the cards and is named the new Clow Mistress by the cards' second guardian Yue (Yukito's true form).Cardcaptor Sakura, Episode 46 Sakura and the Final Judgment In the second half of the manga and anime, Sakura must use the power of her own star to transform the Clow Cards into Sakura Cards, or else the cards would lose their powers. In the beginning of the Clear Card arc, all the Sakura cards suddenly turn blank, losing their powers and while looking for a way to restore them, Sakura must capture new cards of an unknown origin that started appearing around town. She later learns that Syaoran was responsible for the Sakura cards' disappearance in a move to protect her, as her own power had grown too strong for her to control, leading to the creation of the Clear cards. For all Japanese-language productions of the anime (including movies, audio CDs, and video games), Sakura is voiced by Sakura Tange. In the Animax English dub, she is voiced by Andrea Kwan. In the English dub of the second movie, she is voiced by Kari Wahlgren. In the English dub of the Clear Card arc, she is voiced by Monica Rial, who reprised her role as Sakura from Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle. In the Nelvana English dub Cardcaptors, she is known as Sakura Avalon, though her given name is repronounced as \\"Sa-KU-ra\\" instead of \\"SA-ku-ra\\". She is voiced by Carly McKillip. In this version, she is portrayed as a more thick-skinned and less sissy character than in the original anime, her initial romantic feelings for Yukito and fear of ghosts are removed, and later in the series she and Syaoran never developed their romance as it was heavily edited out. =Cerberus = ( K√©rberos ), nicknamed Kero by Sakura; is the appointed guardian of the book which holds the Clow Cards. He is one of two magical creatures created by Clow Reed along with the Clow Cards. Before his death, Clow appointed Kero as the one to select the potential candidate to be the next master of the cards, Cerberus himself, and his \\"brother\\" and fellow guardian, Yue. After Sakura accidentally releases the cards, Cerberus chooses her to be the candidate and teaches her the basics of capturing the cards. Throughout the series, he displays an extensive knowledge of mysticism. After Sakura passes the Final Judgment to become the Clow Cards master, Cerberus remains with her as a friend, companion, adviser, and protector when new threats appear. Having spent a lengthy amount of time in the book while it was in Osaka, Cerberus speaks with a pointed Osakan-accent. He tends to be bossy, demanding, egotistical and gluttonous, but clearly displays his affection for Sakura, especially if she is hurt or in danger. He becomes very fond of video games, and is addicted to sweets. Cerberus spends most of his time in a \\"temporary\\" or \\"false form\\": a small figure resembling an orange stuffed animal with wings. Unlike Yue, Cerberus' magical powers are like the sun, and thus largely self-sustaining, and he is subsequently not as dependent on his master's power to support his life as is Yue. However, his master must have control of the Firey and Earthy cards in order to power his true form, a large-winged mountain lion. In the anime adaptation, the Light card is changed to the Earthy card to delay his obtaining his true form. Cerberus' name is taken from the Greek mythological figure, Cerberus, a large three-headed dog who was assigned to guard the gates of the Greek underworld. In the bilingual Kodansha version of the manga, the name for Cerberus' borrowed form is Cero. In the anime adaptation, his false form is voiced by Aya Hisakawa, while his hidden form is voiced by Masaya Onosaka. In the Cardcaptors dub, his name is spelled Keroberos (based on the Japanese pronunciation of his name), and \\"Kero\\" was repronounced as \\"kir≈ç\\" instead of \\"ker≈ç\\". In this dub, his false form is voiced by Matt Hill with a New York accent, and Richard Newman voices his true form, though the accent is not as distinct. In the second film, he is voiced by Wendee Lee and Dave Wittenberg, in his respective forms. In the English dub of the Clear Card arc, Kero's false form is voiced by Mikaela Krantz and Kero's true form is voiced by Christopher Sabat. Cerberus appears in Episode 44 of Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle in his borrowed form, although in the parallel world he dwells in it appears to be his singular body.Tsubasa Chronicle, Episode 44 Kero-chan and Mokona Cerberus (using \\"Kero\\" as a nickname) guards the Country of Kero, and has a prophetic dream of Syaoran, Sakura, Fai, Kurogane and Mokona, the protagonists of Tsubasa, arriving in his world and recruits Mokona to climb up a mountain to retrieve one of Sakura's memory feathers which shrinks down the protagonists in size. Aya Hisakawa reprised her role as Cerberus for this character appearance, while Chris Cason provided his English voice. =Tomoyo Daidouji= is the best friend and primary assistant of Sakura Kinomoto, and her second cousin on their mother's sides. The daughter of the president of Daid≈çji Toy Company, Sonomi Daidoji,Cardcaptor Sakura, Episode 10 Sakura and the Sports Day of Flowers Tomoyo is a person of dignified bearing, lives a life of wealth and is watched over by a team of female maids and bodyguards.Cardcaptor Sakura, Episode 2 Sakura's Wonderful Friend She has access to a variety of state of the art prototype technological gadgets from her mother's company, and supplies Sakura and Cerberus with different mobile devices throughout the series. Her most defining character traits is her attentiveness, integrity and selflessness towards Sakura's welfare. Tomoyo is initially comes off as stereotypical \\"Ojou-san\\"; a demure and wealthy high-class female stock character. However, she is depicted as being emotionally mature, hard-working, highly motivated, compassionate, intelligent, meticulous; giving her a unique air of cultured politeness and refinement amongst the cast. She regularly speaks using more formal verb conjugations and expressions than normally seen in elementary students. She is artistically gifted, having displayed talents as an amateur fashion designer, beautician, cinematographer, seamstress, choreographer, and vocalist. Tomoyo is shown announcing, performing, or costume designing in various school events. In the anime, her musical ability causes her to be targeted by both the Voice and Song cards. When needed, Tomoyo can exhibit considerable perceptiveness, cunning and resourcefulness, which was most prominently displayed in The Sealed Card film. Because Tomoyo lacks magical powers and athletic abilities, Sakura takes on a protective responsibility most times when capturing or transforming cards. If Tomoyo is ever in danger (or missing), Sakura will be the one concerned for her most, and her focus changes from that of the Card at hand to Tomoyo's safety. Fortunately, Sakura has always succeeded and hugs Tomoyo warmly whenever she reunites with her. Tomoyo is notable for her crafty streak and obsession of documenting every single detail of Sakura's personal life on video as much as possible, much to Sakura's discomfort. When she learns of Sakura's new role as a Cardcaptor, she insists that Sakura must wear \\"special outfits\\", is responsible for choreographing Sakura's new action poses and begins providing Sakura with the various \\"magical girl\\" protective-costumes she wears during her captures, as well as accompanying her on magical (and non-magical) endeavors to record the events with her video camera. This \\"art project\\" seems to serve Tomoyo's personal benefit and enjoyment rather than improving Sakura's performance. Tomoyo faithfully keeps Sakura's new identity secret and often covers for her in times of need. In both the manga and anime adaptations, Tomoyo admits that she loves Sakura, but Sakura replies innocently, \\"I love you, too,\\" in the platonic sense. This is emphasized using manga conventions: Tomoyo declares her love against a background of flowers, while Sakura replies against a blank white background. In the manga, some scenes give the appearance that Tomoyo has a crush on Sakura's brother Toya; however, according to Volume 1 of Clamp No Kiseki: The Ultimate Collection, and an interview in the Cardcaptor Sakura Memorial Book, this was an error caused by one of the finishing artists not being aware that CLAMP intended for Tomoyo to have romantic feelings for Sakura.interview printed in Cardcaptor Sakura Memorial Book, published by Nakayoshi. Later scenes show that Tomoyo recognises that Toya and Sakura, being brother and sister, have the same ears, and that Tomoyo secretly blushed over Toyo because his ears remined her of Sakura. Instead, she encourages Sakura's love of Yukito, and later becomes Syaoran's confidante and wingman when he begins to fall in love with Sakura. CLAMP stated that the reason that Sakura does not return her friend Tomoyo's feelings is not because Tomoyo is another girl, as Sakura does not consider sex or gender a barrier for her romantic attraction. She simply doesn't have romantic feelings for Tomoyo in particular. Demonstrating this, Sakura confesses that she has a crush on a female teacher in the series.Cardcaptor Sakura, Episode 27 Sakura and the Shrine of Memories Although not the actual character, two of Tomoyo's alternate forms make an appearance in Cardcaptor Sakuras spiritual successor Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle, three in the animated version. In the anime adaptation, the character is voiced by Junko Iwao. In the English dub of Cardcaptor Sakura Movie 2: The Sealed Card, her voice is supplied by Michelle Ruff. In the English dub of the Clear Card arc, Tomoyo is voiced by Natalie Hoover. In the English adaptation Cardcaptors, Tomoyo is renamed Madison Taylor, she is voiced by Maggie Blue O'Hara, and her elegant speech was replaced with valley girl speech. J.D. Considine of The New York Times stated: > \\"A United States audience would have a hard enough time accepting the > deference and politeness of Sakura's best friend, Tomoyo, as merely a sign > of good breeding. But her intense devotion to Sakura -- sewing elaborate > costumes for each Clow Card chase, documenting Sakura's successes on video, > assuring Sakura that she \\"really likes\\" her -- verges on the creepy. No > wonder the American version simply paints Madison (the Tomoyo character) as > a video obsessive who sees Sakura's adventures as mere camera > fodder.\\"Considine, J.D. \\"TELEVISION/RADIO; Making Anime A Little Safer For > Americans.\\" The New York Times. January 20, 2002. Retrieved on November 10, > 2011. =Touya Kinomoto= is Sakura's older brother. His birthday is February 29. Though he teases her frequently, he cares a great deal for her and works to protect her. He is fully aware of what she is doing as a Cardcaptor, and regularly takes on several part-time jobs that put him in a position to be nearby when she is working on capturing a card. He is also known for being a chick magnet, a status only reinforced by the fact that he never dates or actively shows romantic interest in anyone. He disliked Syaoran and often holds a grudge against him, but deep down he thought to himself that if there was someone Sakura should be with it would be Syaoran. Touya possesses several magical powers, including the ability to see ghosts and other non-humans, the ability to sense when Sakura is in danger, and mild precognition. He has an extremely close relationship with his best friend Yukito; as the series progresses, it becomes clear not only that he is aware that Yukito is Yue's alter ego, but that he is in love with Yukito. To save both Yukito and Yue, Touya becomes a normal human being after he gives all of his magical powers to Yue, making him promise to protect Sakura in his stead as well as himself (and, by extension, Yukito).Cardcaptor Sakura, Episode 65 Sakura, Yukito, and the Vanishing Power However, it has been revealed in the last chapter of Clear Card arc that he is gradually regaining his magic and seems to be developing new and greater abilities that he shall reveal until the time is right. In the Japanese anime adaptation, Touya is voiced by Tomokazu Seki. In the English manga his name is spelled \\"Toya\\". In the Animax dub, he is voiced by Darren Pleavin. In the English adaptation Cardcaptors, his name is changed to Tori Avalon and he is voiced by Tony Sampson. In the English dub of the second film, Kirk Thornton takes over the voicing role. In the English dub of the Clear Card arc, Touya is voiced by Clifford Chapin. =Yukito Tsukishiro / Yue = Yue/Yukito are a dissociative personality: Yukito is a \\"false\\" persona created to mask Yue's \\"true\\" identity. For most of the series, Yue remained in a \\"state of hibernation\\"; Yukito is unaware of Yue's existence, though he maintains an enormous appetite for food in an unconscious attempt to give Yue power. Yue's existence is revealed to the other characters after all of the Clow Cards are collected, and Toya states he knew of Yue's existence all along and was just waiting for Yukito to notice himself. : is the best friend of Sakura's older brother, Touya, and the human alter-ego of the Clow Card guardian, Yue. Though he is certainly Yue's \\"temporary form\\", he is referenced several times by other characters (including Eriol and Yue himself) as being simultaneously a completely separate \\"heart\\" from Yue's \\"true form\\". As Yukito, he displays a kind and gentle nature, and at the start of the series, Sakura develops a strong limerence towards him. When she confessed her feelings, he gently rejects her, as the one he loves most is Touya. :Once Sakura collects all of the cards, Yue begins needing greater power as her magic isn't strong enough to sustain him. Subconsciously, Yukito begins eating even more to try to compensate, but it is not enough and he starts sleeping constantly, even while standing, and eventually finds his body fading away altogether. Once Touya gives his magical energy to Yue to sustain them, Yukito begins to grow aware of Yue's existence; the grandparents with whom Yukito thought he lived were a false memory and thus did not exist. It is suggested that he came into existence shortly before he met Touya, to be near the future new guardian of the Clow Cards. Eriol tells Yue that he (and Clow) did know Sakura was predestined to be the future master of the cards, and had predicted that Sakura and Yue would be romantically involved with each other; however, Yukito had deviated from this prophetic vision by falling in love with Touya. : is the one of two Guardians of the Clow Cards, along with Cerberus. His name, which is written in kanji rather than hiragana is the Mandarin Chinese word for \\"moon\\". Whereas Cerberus is the elector of the new Clow Card Master, Yue is the judge who is allowed to test the candidate for their worthiness. He spends most of the series in his temporary form, Yukito Tsukishiro, who initially has no memory or knowledge of his other self. Unlike Cerberus, Yue's powers are heavily dependent on the power of his master. Sakura's power is not yet strong enough to sustain him after he awakens, particularly after she begins transforming the Clow Cards into Sakura Cards. Yue's growing need for power is reflected in Yukito's ravenous appetite and later constant sleeping. Similarly, the deficit affects Yue himself in instances such as the blatant failure of his magic which causes Sakura and him to fall out of the sky during one of Eriol's synthesized 'situations'. Eventually, Sakura's brother Toya reveals that he knows Yue and Yukito are not human and gives his power to Yue to sustain his existence so he does not lose Yukito. :As with Ruby Moon, Yue's \\"true form\\" has no biological sex or gender; though not \\"human or male\\", Yue has the appearance of a sexless / non-binary beautiful \\"angelic-bish≈çnen\\" young man (male pronouns used) with long, silver, braided hair, silver-purple feline eyes, and a pair of white angel wings which he uses for flight. Yue sports a white suit and spats-like coverings on his feet. His personality is depicted as serious and aloof in contrast to both Kerberos's and Yukito's, and while those two are very fond of Sakura, Yue is reluctant to accept her. Similarly, Yue displays no hint of Yukito's fondness for Li or his love for Touya. As the series progress, he comes to respond to Sakura's request that rather than being his master, she wants to be his friend. Yue has jurisdiction over the elements wind and water, as well as any cards that can be said to have a connection to the moon, wind or water. This includes the Wood, Time and Dark cards. :Unlike Kerberos, Yukito and Yue are usually voiced by the same actor, albeit with slightly modified performances. In the Japanese anime adaptation Yukito/Yue is voiced by Megumi Ogata. In Cardcaptors, Yukito's name is changed to Julian Star, his love for Touya is removed, and he is voiced by Samuel Vincent. In the English dub of the second movie, he is voiced by Steve Staley. In the English dub of the Clear Card arc, Yukito/Yue is voiced by Justin Briner. =Syaoran Li= Syaoran Li, sometimes spelled as Shaoran Li or originally as Xiaolang Li (ÊùéÂ∞èÁãº L«ê Xi«éol√°ng; „É™„Éª„Ç∑„É£„Ç™„É©„É≥ Ri Shaoran, or Ri Syaoran (Kunrei); Cantonese Jyutping: lei5 siu2 long4), is a member of the Li clan of sorcerers from Hong Kong, whom are distant relatives of Clow Reed, the creator of the Clow Cards. As such, he initially rivals against Sakura because he believes that he should be the one to inherit the Clow Cards and tries to capture the cards for himself. As the series progresses, however, Syaoran comes to respect Sakura and becomes her friend and ally. He eventually falls in love with her, though she is slow to realize it due to her own feelings for Yukito. Originally, Syaoran appeared smitten with Yukito, but later revealed that the attraction was due to high moon power inside of Yukito. Eventually, in the beginning of the third season, Syaoran finally begins to realize he has deeply fallen in love with Sakura, as he constantly blushes whenever he is around her.Cardcaptor Sakura, Episode 47 Sakura and the Mysterious Transfer Student In the manga, Syaoran begins to develop feelings for Sakura around the time of the Erase Card's capture. Once Syaoran realizes his feelings, he tries to admit his love for Sakura several times, but is both too nervous to confess his feelings while also being constantly interrupted. Syaoran also becomes extremely jealous whenever he sees Sakura spending time with Eriol, believing he harbours romantic feelings for Sakura and considers him a rival. Syaoran's love for Sakura is proven to be really strong as he thinks strongly of her well being and needs before his own as shown when after Yukito rejects Sakura's feelings, Syaoran comforts her even though Sakura is still unaware about his own romantic feelings towards her. Nearing the end of the series, Syaoran finally confesses his feelings to Sakura, but decides to return to Hong Kong, since Sakura has now become the new master of the cards. In the series movie, Cardcaptor Sakura Movie 2: The Sealed Card, he and Meiling return from Hong Kong a few months later to visit. Throughout the movie, Syaoran waits for Sakura to reply to his confession, but as Sakura constantly keeps trying to tell him how she feels, they are repeatedly interrupted. Syaoran and Sakura work together to defeat the Nothing Card that has been secretly stealing the Sakura cards while making parts of Tomoeda disappear. Eventually at the end of the movie, they manage to defeat the Nothing Card, which becomes the Hope Card and Sakura finally confesses her love for Syaoran and jumps into his arms. Two years later, Syaoran returns to Tomoeda and enrolls at the same middle school as Sakura and most of her friends. However, his true objective is to watch over Sakura and help her with the mystery surrounding the Clear Cards. He also keeps contact with Eriol, who instructs him to not interfere until the time is right. Later he reveals to Sakura that he was the one who took away the spirits contained within the Sakura Cards in order to protect herself from her own power, which is growing out of control, thus leading to the creation of the Clear Cards. Despite intending to reveal all the truth to Sakura, Syaoran becomes unable to tell her anything about Akiho or Kaito's involvement due to a spell Kaito placed on him. Syaoran manages to catch several cards by playing a major role in helping Sakura seal them. He is allowed to attempt the final judgment but fails. Syaoran is shown to have similar powers to Sakura, such as sensing Clow Cards and magical auras, is a skilled martial artist, and wields a sword which he can use to cast spells when equipped with incantation papers. He can also use a device (dubbed a \\"lasenboard\\" in the Cardcaptors anime dubCardcaptors, Episode 8 Sakura's Rival), which can detect and direct him to magical entities. A running gag is Kero calling him \\"kid\\". Syaoran is voiced by Motoko Kumai in the Japanese dub. In the English dub, he is voiced by Mona Marshall in the second feature film. In Funimation's English dub of Clear Card, he is voiced by Jason Liebrecht, who reprises his role as Syaoran from Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle. In Cardcaptors, Syaoran's name is listed as Li Showron, and he is voiced by Rhys Huber during the Clow Cards arc and the first movie, and Jordan Kilik in the Sakura Cards arc. He is introduced as the male lead in the first episode of the dub (episode 8 of the original anime), and is considered a rival Cardcaptor. He is more abrasive and blunt than in the original anime version. Instead of being infatuated with Yukito, he has shyness. He also does not develop a romantic interest in Sakura and is not close to telling her his feelings like he does in episode 69, one episode before the finale. =Meiling Li= Meiling Li (ÊùéËéìÈà¥ L«ê M√©il√≠ng, „É™„Éª„É°„Ç§„É™„É≥ Ri Meirin, Cantonese Jyutping: lei5 mui4 ling4), sometimes spelled as Meilin Li, is Syaoran Li's cousin and fianc√©e, and only appears in the anime adaptation of Cardcaptor Sakura. Introduced towards the end of episode 19, she is a very impulsive, bratty, straightforward, clingy, and overconfident girl. As children living in Hong Kong, Meiling and Syaoran trained in martial arts under the tutelage of Wang Wei. One night her pet bird escaped from its cage, and the normally quiet and withdrawn Syaoran told her not to cry, then left. After spending hours in the rain, he returned with the bird and Meiling was both grateful and touched. From that day, she devoted herself to him, eventually declaring that she liked Syaoran above all others and, reasoning that he liked her as well, she declared them to be engaged, much to Syaoran's chagrin. At the same time, she promised that if he found someone he liked more than her, he would tell her and she would release him from the promise.Ep 43 In coming to Tokyo, Meiling intends to help Syaoran find and gather the Clow Cards, and actively dislikes Sakura. As the series progresses, Meiling develops a grudging respect for Sakura that turns into a good friendship by the time Meiling returns to Hong Kong in episode 43 by her mother due to unknown reasons. During her initial visit, Meiling seemed to recognize that Syaoran was falling in love with Sakura, but it wasn't until she briefly returned in episode 60 that she acknowledges and accepts Sakura as the person Syaoran loves. Wanting to keep her promise, Syaoran attempts to tell her that he loves Sakura, but Meiling interrupts and tells him that she knows because he is now calling Sakura by her first name, something he only does for his sisters and her. She releases Syaoran from their promise, then quickly leaves. Meiling spends the night at Tomoyo Daid≈çji's house and releases all of her frustration by crying without burdening Syaoran. At the end of the episode, Meiling returns home and is not seen again in the main series. She returns in the second movie, with Syaoran, to see her old friends, but secretly came back to help Sakura finally confess her love to Syaoran. Meiling also occasionally appears in the anime adaptation of Clear Card, talking to Sakura on phone and giving her hints at developing her relationship with Syaoran. A running gag is Kero calling her \\"brat\\". Along with her temporary stay in Tomoeda and being supportive of Syaoran, Meiling also plays a limited role in the story because, unlike Syaoran, she has no magical abilities, relying solely on her physical fighting abilities and a healthy dose of pride. Her lack of powers and tendency to leap before thinking, however, results in her hindering more than helping Syaoran in most battles against the cards. She challenges The Fight card in episode 20, and was nearly badly wounded and had to be rescued by Syaoran. Recognizing that she was being a burden, Meiling grew upset and lashed out at Syaoran. However, she was then able to be an aid to him while fighting The Twin card, as their years of practicing martial arts together enables them to match the card's synchronized fighting style. In Clear Card episode 13, Meiling matured and is much less of a brat than she used to be. Even Sakura is amazed to see Meiling speak so politely to Fujitaka, to which Meiling responds, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just good manners,‚Äù as if that's how she's always been. Meiling's signature hairstyle is the Chinese ni√∫ji«éot√≥u (ÁâõËßíÂ§¥). In the Japanese anime adaptation, Meiling is voiced by Yukana Nogami. In the English dub of the second movie, she is voiced by Julie Maddalena. In the English dub of the Clear Card arc, she is voiced by Trina Nishimura. In the English adaptation Cardcaptors, she is known as Meilin Rae and is voiced by Nicole Oliver. Her unrequited engagement with Syaoran was omitted along with the fact that she and Syaoran were cousins. Rather she is portrayed as a long time friend of Syaoran and her romantic feelings toward him were watered down but still evident. Recurring charactersClow Reed= is the sorcerer who originally created the Clow Cards, and their magical guardians Cerberus and Yue. Along with Kohaku of Wish, and Yuuko of xxxHolic, he is one of the few Clamp-created characters to appear in more than one work. Born of an English father and a Chinese mother, Clow created a new type of magic that blended both Eastern and Western magical elements. His plan was to hand down the magic to people who would use and protect it while meeting all of the qualifications. However, few people could learn his brand of magic. The character of Clow is only seen in flashbacks, as he has long been dead before the series starts. Few details are revealed about his character, personality, or life, though multiple characters comment on his eccentricity. He displays a gentle and affable personality in his interactions with his creations. When Clow knew he was about to die, he chose his then- unborn descendant Sakura Kinomoto to become the new guardian of the cards and the new master of Yue and Cerberus. Clow's magical ability allowed him to foresee most of the future and plan many of the situations that would enable Sakura to succeed in taking full possession of the Clow Cards. Likewise, he deliberately made the sealing wand pink, reflecting that its future user would be a young girl. He also split his soul into two reincarnations: Eriol Hiiragizawa who had all of his memories and magic, and Fujitaka Kinomoto, Sakura's father. In the anime adaptation, Clow does not split his soul, instead passing on his memories, soul, and powers to Eriol exclusively. Syaoran Li is also an indirect descendant of Clow's Chinese lineage. In the anime adaptation and the film, he is voiced by Kazuo Hayashi. In the English adaptation, Cardcaptors, his given name is repronounced as \\"klauÃá\\" instead of \\"kl≈ç\\", and is voiced by Dale Wilson. Clow Reed also appears in two additional CLAMP works, Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle and xxxHolic, where he has another descendant named Fei-Wang Reed and worked with the Dimensional Witch Y≈´ko Ichihara in arranging the series of events in the former series. =Fujitaka Kinomoto= is the father of titular character Sakura Kinomoto and her brother Touya Kinomoto. A busy professor of archaeology at Towa University, Fujitaka is a kind and caring father. He met his late wife Nadeshiko while doing his first year as a teacher at her high school. Nadeshiko had climbed a tree to return a baby bird to its nest, but fell out of the tree, landing on Fujitaka. Upon seeing her, he stated that \\"an angel has fallen from the sky.\\" They fell in love and married when she was sixteen. Though Nadeshiko died seven years before the start of the series, Fujitaka is shown to still be very much in love with her and devoted to her memory. He keeps a picture of her in the dining room, changing it each morning. Little is initially said about Fujitaka's family or past. During the second half of the series, it is revealed that when Clow Reed divided his soul (seeking to no longer be the most powerful magician in the world), he split it into two halves. One of these halves became Eriol Hiiragizawa, holding all of Clow's magic and memories, and the other being Fujitaka, who has no magic of his own, but fathered the one who would inherit the cards. It is stated that Fujitaka has no magical powers of his own, but he is also unaffected by other Clow's magic, such as the Eriol's sleep spell. At the end of the series, Eriol gives half of his magic to Fujitaka. This enables Fujitaka to finally see the spirit of Nadeshiko, who has been watching over her family since her death. In the anime adaptation, Fujitaka's role as the other half of Clow Reed's reincarnation is completely removed as is his immunity to Eriol's magic and he is never able to see Nadeshiko's spirit. He is voiced by Hideyuki Tanaka. In the Cardcaptors dub, his name is changed to Aiden Avalon and he is voiced by Brian Drummond. In the Animax dub, he is voiced by Scott Evans. In the English dub of the second movie, he is voiced by Michael McConnohie. In the English dub of the Clear Card arc, Fujitaka is voiced by Jason Douglas. =Sonomi Daidouji= is the mother of titular character Sakura's best friend Tomoyo Daidouji, and the first cousin of Sakura's late mother Nadeshiko Kinomoto. She is rarely seen in the series, but is said to be a wealthy woman and the President of a large toy corporation. She greatly loved her cousin Nadeshiko, and disapproved of her marriage to Fujitaka, later blaming Fujitaka for Nadeshiko's death at a young age. During the marriage, it is implied that Nadeshiko was at least partially cut off from her family. Sonomi maintains a pixie cut, a hairstyle Nadeshiko loved giving her when they were kids; and has Tomoyo keep her hair long because it reminds her of Nadeshiko. After meeting Sakura for the first time, Sonomi realizes that Nadeshiko had lived a happy life and is able to come to terms with the marriage. At times, she still treats Fujitaka as a \\"rival\\" competing to love Nadeshiko more, but she also helps him pass on gifts from Sakura to her grandfather and to arrange for Sakura to meet her great- grandfather while on a family vacation. Sonomi shows great affection for Sakura‚Äìtreating her like her own daughter‚Äìand often clears her busy work schedule to join her and Tomoyo whenever Sakura comes over to visit. In the Cardcaptors English adaptation, her name is changed to Samantha Taylor and her declaration of love for Nadeshiko is modified to a purely familiar love rather than a romantic love. Sonomi is voiced by Miki It≈ç in anime series. She is voiced by Venus Terzo in the Cardcaptors dub and by Wendee Lee in the English dub of the second movie. In the English dub of the Clear Card arc, she is voiced by Michelle Rojas. =Nadeshiko Kinomoto= is Sakura and Toya's mother, Fujitaka's late wife, and the first cousin of Sonomi Daidouji. She worked as a model from her teens up until her death. She was sixteen when she met Fujitaka when he worked as a student teacher at her high school. She met Fujitaka when she climbed a tree to rescue a bird nest and accidentally fell, and landed on him as he saved her from getting hurt. He then remarked, \\"l had thought an angel fell from the sky\\". With those words, she fell in love with him. Soon after, against the wishes of her family, they got married despite their nine-year age gap (he was 25, she was 16). She died from an unnamed illness when Sakura was three. Because she was 27 when she died and Sakura was three and Toya was eight, it is likely that she gave birth to Toya at 19. Although she has died, she is still very much remembered and loved by her family; Fujitaka keeps her picture in the family room and Sakura never fails to greet her photo every morning. She appears occasionally as a spirit and is seen only by Toya, Eriol, and Sakura (beginning with volume 4 of the Clear Card arc). Nadeshiko is voiced by Y≈´ko Minaguchi in the anime series. In the Cardcaptors English adaption, her name is changed to Natasha Avalon and she is voiced by Janyse Jaud. In the English dub of the Clear Card arc, she is voiced by Megan Shipman. =Yoshiyuki Terada= is a teacher at Tomoeda Elementary School. During the series, as the main characters go through fourth grade, and enter the fifth grade, he acts as their home room teacher. He is also shown teaching in other classes, including the physical education classes, and he acts as the chaperon on several school field trips. As the series progresses, it is revealed that he is having a romantic relationship with his student Rika Sasaki. In the manga, they become engaged when he gives her a ring, noting that he hopes it will one day become her wedding ring. Rika gives him a teddy bear she made and named after herself, which legends says will allow them to remain in love forever. Towards the end of the series, when Sakura is unsure of her feelings about Syaoran, the couple is shown having a picnic at a park, with Terada slipping away so Sakura doesn't notice him. During the series, none of the other characters appear to know about the relationship, though when Rika is taken over by the Sword card, Sakura hears her call out \\"Sensei\\" (teacher) when she uses the Illusion card to show Rika her most beloved. In the anime adaptation, their relationship is not shown in the same light. Their engagement and more romantic scenes between them are removed, and Rika notes that Terada reminds her of her absentee father. Terada is also shown accepting cakes made by Rika and in accepting the bear and naming it after his \\"hardest working student.\\" In the Cardcaptors English dub, he is simply called Mr. Terada, and all aspects of the romantic relationship between Terada and Rika are completely removed, with Rika's shyness and reactions to him made to appear to be more of a general fear of men than romantic feelings. In the anime series, he is voiced by T≈çru Furusawa for the first season and first movie, and by Katsuyuki Konishi for the second and third seasons and the second film. In the Cardcaptors dub, he is voiced by Brian Drummond. He is voiced by Steven Blum in the English dub of the second movie. In the English dub of the Clear Card arc, he is voiced by Zach Bolton. =Rika Sasaki= is a classmate and friend of titular character Sakura Kinomoto. She is considered to be very elegant and mature for her age, though she can also be shy. During the series, she is also shown to be a skilled cook and very good at crafts. During the series, Rika is affected by the Clow Cards several times. Early in the series, she buys a brooch that is actually The Sword card. The card takes her over and causes her to attack Sakura. Sakura is able to stop Rika by using The Illusion card to show her an image of her beloved (or greatest fear in the English dub), allowing Sakura to capture the card. During the second half of the series, she is nearly drowned during a magical trial Eriol Hiiragizawa created to cause Sakura to convert a Clow Card to Sakura Card. During the series, Rika is shown to be in a romantic relationship with her teacher Yoshiyuki Terada. In the manga series, they are engaged to be married when she is old enough, and they frequently spend time alone together on \\"dates.\\" In the anime adaptation, the engagement is removed as are many of their dates, however they are still shown to have affection for one another (it's implied that he reminds her of her father, who's oft busy on overseas business). Rika gives Terada the hand-made teddy bear she made, and he names it after her. In both the manga and anime, when Sakura uses the Illusion card to stop Rika's attacks induced by the Sword card, she calls the image \\"Sensei\\" which means \\"teacher\\" in Japanese. During the final judgment when Yue shows Sakura a world where everyone has lost their feelings for the one they love the most, Rika is shown handing Terada a paper without her usual blush and shy look. After graduating from Elementary School, Rika is the only among Sakura's friends who enrolled in a different Junior High School, and thus is not seen with them in Clear Card, although they usually keep in touch. In the Cardcaptors English adaptation, Rika's name is translated as Rita and all hints of her relationship with Terada are removed. Instead of being a good student, she is depicted as having trouble with her school work and her blushing around Terada is explained away as being embarrassed at having to stay after school so often and that she is afraid of him. In the original anime series, she is voiced by Tomoko Kawakami. In the Clear Card arc, she is voiced by Saki Fujita. In the English Cardcaptors dub and the second film, she is voiced by Dina Sherman. In the English dub of the Clear Card arc, she is voiced by Alex Moore. =Takashi Yamazaki= is a classmate and friend of Sakura Kinomoto and Syaoran Li. He is infamously known for fabricating highly detailed stories on the supposed history of practically any subject, usually whatever Sakura and her friends happening to be discussing. Sakura and Syaoran are often gullible enough to believe the stories, which often provide an element of humour in the series. His stories are primarily interrupted by Chiharu, who physically disciplines him by strangling him until he stops talking and will resort to dragging him away when she proves to be unsuccessful. His storytelling is later supplemented by Eriol, who helps to reinforce the false validity of his stories and whose presence prevents Chiharu from stopping Yamazaki's lies. Notably, Yamazaki's eyes are almost never open, causing Meiling to hypothesize that he only opens his eyes when telling the truth, a hypothesis that is later proven false. While generally viewed as lighthearted and energetic, Yamazaki can also be sensitive and serious. In the last volume of the manga, when Sakura was down, he leaves the scene in order for Chiharu to talk to Sakura. Chiharu adds that he understands that Sakura needs her guidance and counseling, which is why he left so they could talk rather than stay to tell stories. Yamazaki is named after film director, Takashi Yamazaki, who is a friend of CLAMP. He is known as Zachary Marker in the English adaptation Cardcaptors and his relationship with Chiharu is written so that they are cousins and her acts of strangling are the result of sibling rivalry. Yamazaki also makes an appearance in Clamp's manga series, Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle in Piffle Country as an announcer, where he retains his tendency to fabricate elaborate stories. In the Japanese version, he is voiced by Issei Miyazaki. He is voiced by Philip Pacaud in the English Cardcaptors dub, and by Joshua Seth in the second movie. In the English dub of the Clear Card arc, Takashi is voiced by Alejandro Saab. =Chiharu Mihara= is one of Sakura Kinomoto's friends and classmates in school. Along with Rika Sasaki and Naoko Yanagisawa, Chiharu often appears alongside Sakura at school and during school events. She is also on the school's cheerleading squad with Sakura. Chiharu's most notable trait is her relationship with Takashi Yamazaki, whom she has known since kindergarten.\\"Sakura's Scary Test of Courage\\" (Episode 17). Cardcaptor Sakura. 1998. CLAMP, NHK. She is never fooled by his rampant storytelling and is usually driven silence him by comically strangling him, which usually does not prevent him from continuing. Despite the rough-handling, she and Yamazaki actually share a close relationship and it is implied that they care for one another in a more affectionate manner. In the last volume of the series, Chiharu speaks openly about her relationship with Yamazaki when Sakura turns to her for advice on love and true feelings as Sakura reflects on her own relationship with Syaoran. In the Cardcaptors dub, she is known as Chelsea and Yamazaki is written as her cousin to justify the random acts of strangling as sibling rivalry. In the Japanese version, she is voiced by Miwa Matsumoto. She is voiced by Jocelyne Loewen in the Cardcaptors dub, and by Dorothy Elias-Fahn in the second movie. In the English dub of the Clear Card arc, she is voiced by Jill Harris. =Naoko Yanagisawa= is one of Sakura Kinomoto's classmates and friends in school and often appears at school events with Sakura's other friends, Chiharu and Rika. Despite being bad at gymnastics, she is also a member of the school's cheerleading squad alongside Sakura. Naoko loves reading various types of stories, especially fantasy stories and ghost stories. While Sakura reacts to scary situations with utmost fear, Naoko reacts with fascination and a brave willingness to explore these mysterious situations further. In the anime, Naoko's love of stories causes trouble when she finds The Create card in the form of a notebook and writes a fantastic story within it, forcing Sakura to defeat Naoko's creations before recovering The Create. When Naoko wakes up the next morning to find her book suddenly missing, she believes she just had a supernatural experience. She is known as Nikki in the English adaptation Cardcaptors. She is voiced by Emi Motoi in the Japanese anime, Kelly Sheridan in Cardcaptors, and by Sherry Lynn in the second movie.

Initially objecting to Nadeshiko's marriage to Fujitaka Kinomoto, he became more accepting upon meeting Sakura and later receiving a gift from her as a form of peace between family members. In the episode, Sakura and the Rainbow of Memories, Sakura doesn't know who he was and they spent a good time together, playing tennis, having tea, Sakura giving him cookies and Masaki giving Sakura the dress her mother wore. Just before leaving, Sakura used the Rain card to make a rainbow for Masaki, prompting him to remember when Nadeshiko had first pointed out a rainbow to him. Sakura discovers the present Masaki left her was the dress she wore at his summer house, although she does not seem to realizes who he actually is despite Cerberus pointing out its origins. Masaki later appears in Clear Card, inviting Sakura and Syaoran for another visit to his summer house. In the occasion, he presents Sakura with a mysterious key that once belonged to her mother, and later states that he intends is to have Sakura inherit the summer house itself after he passes away. In the anime series, Masaki is voiced by Osamu Saka. In the English dub, Mr. Avalon was portrayed instead as the father of Natasha Avalon, making him the grandfather of Sakura instead of her great-grandfather. In the English dub of the Clear Card arc, Masaki is voiced by Charlie Campbell. =Kaho Mizuki= is a shrine maiden and the daughter of the priest at the Tsukimine Shrine. She first appears in the series as a new substitute teacher at Tomoeda Elementary School for the math class of Sakura Kinomoto and Syaoran Li. While Sakura instantly crushes on the female teacher and feels a connection with her, Syaoran is distrustful and believes she is up to no good. When Sakura, Syaoran, Meiling and Tomoyo are trapped by the Maze card, Kaho uses a mysterious bell to break through Maze's walls allowing Sakura to capture it. After this incident, the readers learn that Sakura's older brother Toya dated Kaho when she was his junior high school teacher and that they broke up when Kaho left to study in England. Before she left, she told them that when they met again, they would be in love with different people which he acknowledges is now true. After meeting her, Cerberus incorrectly believes that Kaho is the false form of his fellow guardian Yue, which is later shown to actually be Yukito Tsukishiro. Kaho's role is to use the bell left at her family's shrine to give Sakura another chance when she is unable to defeat Yue out of fear of hurting him. The bell changes Sakura's staff into a new staff containing her own power of the stars and gives her the power to use the cards to defeat Yue. After fulfilling this duty, she returns to England. During the third season of the series, she is primarily \\"seen\\" through providing a steady, but oftentimes enigmatic exchange of letters with Sakura over the mysterious attacks. After Eriol Hiiragizawa reveals the truth behind the attacks, they learn that Kaho had met Eriol three years before Sakura discovered the Book of the Clow. As they leave for England, Kaho and Eriol confirm their feelings for one another and vow to remain together. She is later seen beside Eriol on a few occasions in both the second movie and the Clear Card arc. In the anime series, Kaho is voiced by Emi Shinohara. In the English adaptation Cardcaptors, her name is changed to Layla MacKenzie and she is voiced by Linda Rae Jurgens. She is voiced by Philece Sampler in the English adaptation of the second movie. In the English dub of the Clear Card arc, Kaho is voiced by Morgan Garrett. =Eriol Hiragizawa= is the main antagonist in the second half of the series, commonly called the Master of the Clow arc. The reincarnation of Clow Reed, Eriol has both Clow's memories and all of his magic power. He has a magical staff similar to Clow Reed's, can restrain Clow's creations Yue and Cerberus, and has created his own similar pair of guardians: Ruby Moon and Spinel Sun. He moves from England to transfer to Tomoeda Elementary school after Sakura Kinomoto passed the Last Judgement and became the official master of the cards. He is depicted as a quiet, mature boy while at school, though he also shows a mischievous side when he regularly joins classmate Takashi Yamazaki in weaving complex lies about the history of objects, places, and events. While seeming a normal student to Sakura, Syaoran Li is suspicious of him, mainly due to that Eriol is overly nice to Sakura which makes Syaoran jealous. It is soon shown that Yue and Cerberus are able to detect his magical signature as being Clow's, and Eriol must erase Yue's memories of encountering him after he is accidentally seen by him. Eriol came to Japan in order to aid Sakura and force her to use her own magical powers to convert the Clow Cards into Sakura cards. This is necessary as the cards take their magical energy from their master, but until Sakura converted them, they could not use her magic and were slowly dying. The guardian Yue also was suffering the same fate, forcing Sakura's brother to \\"feed\\" him all of his magical power to prevent Yue, and his false form Yukito, from dying. Sakura does not become aware that Eriol is causing all of the magical disasters that are forcing her to convert the cards until near the end of the series when Eriol reveals himself to her. He puts the city to sleep and challenges Sakura to convert the last two cards, the Dark and the Light, which must be changed together. After Sakura successfully does so, he then tells her that she is now more powerful than Clow Reed and asks her to perform one final task for him: to divide his own magical power between himself and her father Fujitaka‚Äîthe other reincarnation of Clow Reed‚Äîso that Eriol will no longer be the most powerful magician in the world. He then takes Sakura, Syaoran, Tomoyo, Yue, and Cerberus to his home where he explains why he had to give her a reason to convert the cards, as her doing so without a need could have been dangerous for Sakura. Eriol's true age is unknown, as he used his magic to halt his aging process to remain the same physical age as Sakura. He is romantically involved with Kaho Mizuki, whom he originally sent from England to aid Sakura in the Final Judgment and who offers Sakura support through letters during the second arc. At the end of the manga series, she returns with him to England, and in the second anime movie, they are shown together when Sakura calls for advice, though their love is never confessed like in the manga, only hinted at indirectly. In the Clear Card arc. Eriol ceases all contact with Sakura after the Sakura cards turn blank, but keeps in touch with Syaoran who informs him about everything that happens around her. While questioned about his reasons, Eriol claims that he is waiting for the right time to interfere, and thus forbids both Syaoran and his companions in England from taking action until then. In the anime series, Eriol is the sole reincarnation of Clow Reed, with all of the elements from the manga regarding Fujitaka's relation to Clow and inheriting of half of his powers removed. The final explanation at Eriol's house is also shifted slightly so it takes place the day after the final battle, rather than immediately after, and it is done because Sakura seeks him out rather than him giving an invitation. The character of Eriol is voiced by Nozomu Sasaki. In the Cardcaptors English adaptation, his name is changed to Eli Moon and he is voiced by Bill Switzer. In the English dub of the second film, his voice is supplied by Johnny Yong Bosch.

The counterpart to Clow Reed's original guardian Kerberus. Spinel Sun's true form is a butterfly- winged black panther with cat-like ears and ruffs of fur on the side of his head, while his false form is similar to a small winged cat with the same wing type as his true form. Nicknamed Suppi by Ruby Moon, Spinel Sun spends most of his time reading and projects a calm demeanor. Ruby Moon often teases him that he needs to have more fun. During the series, he mostly remains out of sight of the main characters, except when he once runs into Cerberus in his false form (though this encounter is exclusive to the anime). Fortunately for him, Cerberus doesn't suspect anything and instead declares Spinel Sun a monster and feeds him sweets, not realizing that the sweets would turn him into a hyperactive eating machine. Cerberus does not learn his true identity until just before the final battle where the two cats face one another. Initially, Spinel Sun appears to have the upper hand, however Cerberus' greater determination to protect Sakura enables him to defeat him. In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by Katsuyuki Konishi in his true form, and by Yumi T≈çma in his false form. In the second Cardcaptor Sakura movie, his false form briefly appears and is voiced by Philece Sampler. In the English adaptation Cardcaptors, his name is changed to Spinner Sun and both forms are voiced by Colin Murdock. In the Clear Card arc, Spinel's false form is voiced by Apphia Yu. =Nakuru Akizuki / Ruby Moon= is one of two magical guardians created by Eriol Hiiragizawa. The counterpart to Clow Reed's original guardian Yue. When Eriol transfers to Tomoeda Elementary, Ruby Moon created a false form named and enrolls in Seijou High School, entering the same class as Toya Kinomoto, Sakura's brother, and Yukito Tsukishiro, the false form of Yue who is unaware of his true nature. Her true form resembles a human-sized fairy that performs ruby-based attacks. Ruby Moon is sexless / non-binary and has no biological sex, but prefers feminine pronouns; her \\"human sex\\" is unspecified, though Akizuki has stated a preference for women's clothing and enjoys \\"being cute\\". Unlike the Yue/Yukito relationship, both Ruby/Nakuru forms are fully aware and display no dissociative personality. As the alias, Nakuru Akizuki, she acts as a general annoyance, deliberately interfering every time Toya tries to talk to Yukito about the latter's dwindling energy. She claims she wants to consume Toya's energy herself, though it is never stated that she actually has a need for it nor why she couldn't simply steal it. When Toya is finally able to speak with Yue and give him all of his magical energy to sustain Yue's life, Akizuki gives up her pursuit. In the final battle, Ruby Moon battles Yue and initially appears to be winning. However, Yue is able to get past her due to Yue's greater determination and desire to protect Sakura. In the anime adaptation, Ruby Moon is voiced by Ry≈çka Yuzuki. In the English adaptation, Cardcaptors, both her true form and false form is called Ruby Moon and she is voiced by Willow Johnson. In the Clear Card arc, she is voiced by Alexis Tipton. =Ms. Morita= Ms. Morita is Sakura's middle school teacher. She is voiced by Yuri Yokoyama in Japanese and Caitlin Glass in English. =Akiho Shinomoto= first appears in Cardcaptor Sakura: Clear Card. She is a young girl who bears a strong resemblance to Sakura, being around the same age and height. Akiho is rarely seen without her stuffed rabbit Momo, which she has owned since she was a small child. Akiho makes her first appearance in chapter 7 of the Clear Card arc as a transfer student in Sakura and Tomoyo's class. Akiho used to live in France, Germany, Italy, England, and Hong Kong before moving to Japan, and is initially shy around her classmates due to her nervousness about speaking Japanese. Akiho is gifted at singing and, with Tomoyo and Sakura's encouragement, joins the school choir club. Akiho lives with her caretaker Yuna D. Kaito in Eriol's old house. She tells Sakura that Yuna has cared for her since she was very young, and suggests that she is distant from her blood relatives. Many of Akiho's relatives are avid book collectors who travel the world in search of rare books. Akiho's family installed its massive library of books in her house, among them one of her most prized possessions, a novel titled \\"Alice in Clockland\\" written in a foreign script only she can read. Akiho states that she has moved from country to country for most of her life in search of a particular book. When it became apparent that for some unknown reason Akiho and Sakura have shared dreams, it was revealed that Akiho not only possesses strong magic abilities, she is also the figure in the robe that continuously confronted Sakura in her dreams, although Akiho herself doesn't know that, however as Sakura and Akiho continue to enter the same dream, Akiho develops a knowledge of why she is present in those dreams: the mysterious person she is watching has something she wants. Later is revealed that Akiho is part of the \\"D\\" magician clan, but despite having born from the two most powerful magicians of the clan at the time, she has no magic power at all, thus the clan decides to use her to create the ultimate magic tool by implanting all kinds of spells inside her body, despite knowing that it would destroy her soul, until Kaito takes her with him. In the anime adaptation, Akiho Shinomoto is voiced by Minori Suzuki in Japanese and Amanda Lee in English. =Yuna D. Kaito= first appears in Cardcaptor Sakura: Clear Card. He has served as Akiho Shinomoto's legal guardian and caretaker since she was young. Yuna is a tall, dark-haired young man who appears dressed in full formal uniform, including an unusual pocket watch which he holds dear. He is professional and polite in his interactions with others, and is skilled at various domestic tasks including baking and sewing. Syaoran senses that Yuna possesses strong moon magic, and Eriol confirms that the \\"D.\\" in Yuna's name is a title from a notorious English wizarding society. Yuna appears to be aware of both the existence of the Clear Cards and the fact that Sakura is a magician. Thus-far, it has been hinted that he's after the Clear Cards as a means of powering a certain spell, possibly connected to a magical object, a magical time-controlling pocket watch (mentioned above), which he had stolen from the society of sorcerers he was formally-apart of, and that he's using both Sakura and Akiho to get them (having some-how created a connection between then before they had even met, which is evident by them sharing the same reoccurring dreams but are completely oblivious that they have been seeing one another), but that the ones that Sakura has created so far are not yet enough for his purpose to activate that certain spell of the ancient, forbidden relic that he had taken from the magic association from which he was excommunicated. As such, he turns back time but is certain that Sakura may gradually recall what had occurred between her and the cloaked figure, finally uncovering its identity as her good friend Akiho. In the incomplete anime adaptation, Yuna D. Kaito is voiced by Natsuki Hanae and Brandon McInnis in English. =Momo= first appears in Cardcaptor Sakura: Clear Card. Momo appears to be a stuffed toy animal in the form of a white rabbit with light blue scarf around her neck and ears which Akiho Shinomoto usually carries around on her bag as a plushie of sorts. However she was eventually revealed to be actually a magical creature much like Kero and Spinel, but while Akiho is unaware of this, Yuna is the only one who has been seen to communicate with Momo as of yet.

This 400-member marching band performs at all South Carolina Gamecocks football games played at Williams-Brice Stadium and most football games outside of Columbia, South Carolina‚Äîincluding bowl games. The \\"Mighty Sound of the Southeast\\" plays the theme from 2001: A Space Odyssey, as the Gamecocks run onto the field at the start of every game, which Sporting News once called \\"the most exciting pregame entry\\" in college football.  History  The Carolina Band began as a student-initiated organization in 1920, when the request to organize a band was granted by the Board of Trustees. The first band was formed with fewer than 20 students in September 1921 under the direction of a student (Mr. Martin). * 1922: After the departure of Martin, James C. Lanham, another student at USC, assumed the director position through the 1922‚Äì23 school year. * 1923: George Olson was appointed director of the band, Olson was the first faculty member in charge of the band (was Dean of the School of Commerce). With 23 years, Olson was the longest serving director of the marching band itself. (Copenhaver is the longest serving overall director of bands; however he only directly oversaw the marching band for 21 years). = The World War II years (to 1945) = Still under the direction of Olson, the band began to increasingly take on the appearance and the sound of a marching band. Olson's band were of the first to wear uniforms in the school colors and he offered participating students instruments for use in the band. Band membership totaled around 50 members. Additionally, as the United States was engaged in the second world war, many members were lost from the university and the band to active duty requirements for World War II. In 1941, the formerly all-male band changed its policies to allow females into its members. The first female members only served as majorettes. Later, female members assumed positions as marching members of the band. = After World War II & the 1950s = After World War II, the band began to develop more as a \\"show\\" band, with more elaborate pre-game and halftime shows. There were four different directors between 1946 and 1959. * 1946: Louis Albert Fink continued the V-12 Naval ROTC band style which was used by Olson in the latter part of his term. Additionally, the band began to travel to football games away from Columbia. * 1950: Richard H. Zimmermann served as director through 1955. Membership reached a peak of 82 members. * 1955: Donald L. Banschbach succeeded Zimmermann during the first time that Air Force ROTC, Navy ROTC and University bands all operating independently of each other. * 1956: Pat Garnett is known most widely for eliminating the majorettes from the band. He suffered a stroke in 1958 and ended his term as director in 1959. = 1960s and 1970s = The style of the Carolina Band can be traced to the appointment of James D. Pritchard as band director in 1959. Though a regimental marching band, Pritchard brought back the majorettes and feature twirlers, who had been absent from the shows of the preceding few years. Pritchard also acquired a recording studio, more storage & practice areas and created the \\"Coquettes\\", the official dance team of the marching band. He also collaborated with then-athletic director and head football coach Paul Dietzel in creating the new school fight song, \\"The Fighting Gamecocks Lead the Way (Step to the Rear).\\" The song is still used today. *1969: Ralph Wahl succeeded Pritchard with a four-year tenure. During this time, Wahl tripled the size of the Carolina Band to 350 members (which was the largest at that time). *1973: Thomas O'Neal, served as director for two years. O'Neal brought the band back under the jurisdiction of the Music Department. The tradition of post-game concerts by the Carolina Band began at this time. = Mid 1970s-1990 = In 1976, James K. Copenhaver, the longest-serving Director of Bands (now Director of Bands Emeritus), succeeded O'Neal. Copenhaver created the most well-known USC pre-game show (used from his tenure through the 2010 season). He also is responsible for the tradition of always having national or world champion twirlers as a part of the band. = The SEC years (1990‚Äìpresent) = USC was accepted as a member institution of the Southeastern Conference on September 25, 1990. They began to play during the 1992 season. One change included the addition of third band director. Under this organizational structure, the Director of Bands became responsible for administering the total band program (which includes the Marching Band, the Pep Bands, the Concert Band, the Symphonic Band, the Wind Ensemble & the summer band camps). The various bands in the program were then overseen by an Associate and Assistant Director of Bands. The new Assistant Director of Bands became the Director of Athletic Bands, which included direct oversight and instruction of the University of South Carolina Marching Band and pep bands. The first person to hold this position was Dr. David O' Shields. From 1995 until 2006, Dr. O'Shields's served as Assistant Director of Bands/Director of Athletic Bands at the University of South Carolina. O'Shields' tenure is highlighted by the demolition of the former Band Hall, the move to an Interim Band Hall, and the creation of plans for the new $9.8 million band facility complex which later opened in April 2009. George Brozak became the new Assistant Director of Bands/Director of Athletic Bands in 2006. His tenure (2006‚Äì2009) leading the marching band is noted by the offering of scholarships for all Carolina Band members for the first time. Steve McKeithen was hired as Assistant Director of Bands/Director of Athletic Bands from 2009 until 2011. Following James Copenhaver's retirement in 2010, Dr. Scott Weiss was appointed Director of Bands at the University of South Carolina. Rebecca Phillips was appointed Director of Athletic Bands in 2011 officially becoming the first Associate Director of Bands/Director of Athletic Bands with a new Assistant Director of Bands/Assistant Director of Athletic Bands Mr. Jayme Taylor. For the 2014 season, Mr. Taylor served as the Interim Associate Director of Bands and Director of the Carolina Band along with Interim Assistant Director Mr. Stephen Meyer. Starting with the 2015 season, Dr. Cormac Cannon became the new Associate Director of Bands/Director of Athletic Bands and Director of the Carolina Band. In 2017, Dr. Tonya Mitchell-Spradlin was appointed Assistant Director of Bands/Associate Director of Athletic Bands. Following Dr. Cormac Cannon's appointment as Director of Bands at the University of South Carolina in 2019, Dr. Jay Jacobs was appointed the new Associate Director of Bands/Director of Athletic Bands. = Fight songs = The Fighting Gamecocks Lead the Way (Step to the Rear)  USC band director James Pritchard obtained a band arrangement of the song Step to the Rear from the Broadway musical How Now, Dow Jones in 1968 and the marching band played the song at the first game of the 1968 season. It caught the ear of Coach Paul Dietzel who contacted Prichard about making it the official fight song of the University to replace the original fight song, Carolina Let Your Voices Ring. Dietzel wrote the lyrics for the song, but asked that he remain anonymous because knowledge that the football coach wrote the lyrics might render it unacceptable to the basketball program. The song was officially introduced on November 16, 1968 prior to the football game against Virginia Tech.  Facilities  The home of the Carolina Band is on the University of South Carolina campus at 324 Sumter St. On April 26, 2009, the University of South Carolina opened a facility dedicated to its 300-member marching band and a newly accredited dance program. The $9.8 million complex features practice areas, rehearsal rooms, storage for band instruments/uniforms and an adjacent 110-yard long practice field complete with field lighting and a three-story observation tower. The main level building plan is organized around a series of large practice areas and dance studios along the field-side to the north. Smaller offices and support spaces are located to the south. alt=USC Band Hall in Snow..

Let G be a compact Lie group and let X be a G-CW-complex. The theorem then states that the projection map :\\\\pi\\\\colon X\\\\times EG\\\\to X induces an isomorphism of prorings :\\\\pi^*\\\\colon K_G^*(X)_{\\\\widehat{I\\\\,}} \\\\to K^*((X\\\\times EG)/G). Here, the induced map has as domain the completion of the G-equivariant K-theory of X with respect to I, where I denotes the augmentation ideal of the representation ring of G. In the special case of X a point, the theorem specializes to give an isomorphism K^*(BG)\\\\cong R(G)_{\\\\widehat{I\\\\,}} between the K-theory of the classifying space of G and the completion of the representation ring. The theorem can be interpreted as giving a comparison between the geometrical process of taking the homotopy quotient of a G-space, by making the action free before passing to the quotient, and the algebraic process of completing with respect to an ideal. The theorem was first proved for finite groups by Michael Atiyah in 1961, and a proof of the general case was published by Atiyah together with Graeme Segal in 1969. Different proofs have since appeared generalizing the theorem to completion with respect to families of subgroups. The corresponding statement for algebraic K-theory was proven by Alexander Merkurjev, holding in the case that the group is algebraic over the complex numbers.

Built form The Old Perth Boys School was designed in an early gothic revival architecture style. It is a single-storey limestone building with a steeply pitched roof (originally shingled) and narrow vertical windows. The building, which closely resembles a church, had a wing added to the north in 1865 and another to the south in 1868. The shingle roof has been covered with corrugated iron sheeting, and the bell tower and spire have been removed. History The Perth Boys School was established in 1847, despite not having a permanent school building. The school occupied an assortment of vacant places, including the Old Court House. The location selected for the permanent school building was originally the site of a water-powered flour mill on the site, operated by Henry Willey Reveley, the civil engineer for the Swan River Colony.Perth Boys School, 1861. Construction of the school began in February 1853 and was completed in 1854. The school was designed by William Ayshford Sanford, Colonial Secretary from 1852 to 1855, during which period he was also chairman of the board of education with an interest in schools. Sanford designed both the Perth Boys and Fremantle Boys schools. Sanford was a member of the Cambridge Camden Society and was an amateur architect with a passion for ecclesiastical architecture and, as a result, the school resembles a gothic- revival-style church. The cost of constructing the building proved greater than expected. The additional expense was attributed to the boggy ground and the need for extra foundations. The building was a long, narrow structure with an east-west axis. It proved to be too small; the small windows made the interior too dark, and it reportedly lacked ventilation. A gallery (which is no longer extant) was then constructed at the western end. The interior of Old Perth Boys School In 1865, a small southern wing was added and, two years later, a northern wing was constructed. For a number of years, the school had an average of 200 students but, in 1894, due to an increase in population attributable to the gold rush, the figure increased to 346. Additional facilities were constructed in a temporary timber extension at the eastern end of the school to accommodate additional students. At the same time, plans were underway for a new Perth Boys' and Girls' School on James Street, which was completed at the end of 1896 and to which the students were relocated. The building was incorporated into Perth Technical College in 1900. In 1976, the Public Works Department restored the front fence adjoining St Georges Terrace. In 1977, the place was used as offices for the headquarters for the National Trust of Australia (WA), with the Trust undertaking conservation work to the stone walls in 1978. In the 1990s, the building operated for use as a retail shop for the National Trust of Australia (WA) and included a bookshop and restaurant. In 1995, the retail outlet was converted for use as a cafe by a private organisation. The Trust re-roofed the building in 2000‚Äì2001. Current use The building is owned by the National Trust of Western Australia and was used as a caf√© and wine bar. In 2015, Curtin University announced it had signed a lease with the National Trust of Western Australia to use the building for a range of shop-front activities. Curtin is working with the National Trust to complete an internal fit-out of the building during 2015. Heritage value The Old Perth Boys School building was entered into the Register of the National Estate by the Australian Heritage Commission in March 1978 and is classified by the National Trust (WA). It was permanently entered on to the State Register of Heritage Places on 13 March 1992. ReferencesFurther reading * Old Perth Boys School and the National Trust Clement R.

In Piefke's most successful arrangement of the K√∂niggr√§tzer Marsch, another march, Der Hohenfriedberger (commemorating the Battle of Hohenfriedberg), is used as a trio. The commonly played version (AM II, 195)https://listenonrepeat.com/watch/?v=E5ojTIxEZBQ K√∂niggr√§tzer Marschhttps://listenonrepeat.com/watch/?v=34WsELgAJKo is set as an infantry march, while an alternate adaptation is arranged as a cavalry galop (AM III, 228). The German military march catalogue also has the \\"K√∂niggr√§tzer mit anderem Trio\\"https://listenonrepeat.com/watch/?v=7b3mGFUAxdM&bpctr;=1404936425 (\\"K√∂niggr√§tzer with other Trio\\") (Heeresmarsch IIIB, 67), but this secondary composition is far less recognized. History The Battle of K√∂niggr√§tz, deciding battle of the Austro-Prussian War. The first draft of the march is said to have been written by Piefke on the battlefield itself. The confident six-eighths meter composition follows the battle in two parts, the beginning motif signifying the indecisive combat between the first Prussian contingent and the Austrians, the second motif signifying the arrival of Prussian reinforcements. Piefke employed Der Hohenfriedberger as a trio to recall the older victories of king Frederick the Great over the Austrians in the 18th century. The victory in the Battle of K√∂niggr√§tz paved the way for the supremacy of Prussia in the German Confederation and ultimately led to the establishment of the German Empire in 1871. The K√∂niggr√§tzer Marsch continues to be extremely popular and is a staple of any modern German military parade, whereas in Austria it is heard only very rarely, because the piece is associated with Austrian military failure. Like many other German marches and musical compositions (such as Der Hohenfriedberger and the Badenweiler Marsch), the Nazis made significant use of the K√∂niggr√§tzer Marsch. The piece has the dubious distinction of being one of Adolf Hitler's reported favorite marches, and it was often played during his public appearances including the Nuremberg Rally. This connotation, however, has not dimmed the march's image, and it has been recorded many times by bands and orchestras since the Second World War. Like many German marches it is also used by the Chilean Army and other militaries with a historical connection to Germany. The \\"K√∂niggr√§tzer\\" is the regimental march of the 2nd Battalion, The Jamaica Regiment, under the name \\"2nd Battalion West India Regiment\\", and the gallop march (under the name \\"Granaderos al Galope\\", with the addition of a traditional French fanfare) of the 1st Cavalry Regiment \\"Granaderos\\" of Chile.https://listenonrepeat.com/watch/?v=wqD_Ds490p4 It was the march of the 91st Oldenburg Infantry Regiment and the parade-march of the 1st Bavarian Infantry Regiment \\"K√∂nig\\" of the Imperial German Army. : \\\\relative c { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"flute\\" \\\\tempo 2 = 106 \\\\key as \\\\major \\\\time 6/8 \\\\partial 8 es8( as) r8 as8-. as-. r8 es8( as) r8 as8-. as-. r8 es8( as) r8 as8-. as-. r8 c8-. c-. bes-. a-. bes }  In popular culture  *The \\"K√∂niggr√§tzer Marsch\\" is heard at the beginning of the massive revue parade in Leni Riefenstahl's Nuremberg Rally propaganda film, Triumph of the Will when Viktor Lutze leads SA honor guards in their march past. *Before the Source release of Day of Defeat, the \\"K√∂niggr√§tzer Marsch\\" played if the Wehrmacht faction won. *In Call of Duty: World at War multiplayer mode, if the Wehrmacht faction wins the \\"K√∂niggr√§tzer Marsch\\" plays.

It is a prominent feature of the entertainment sector's streetscape. History Interior detailing preserved in the foyer The Plaza Theatre was built during a golden age of cinema-going in Australia and was opened on 11 April 1930.The Heritage of Australia, Macmillan Company, 1981, p.2/102 By 1950 cinema attendance had declined and this was further affected by the introduction of television in 1956. Many suburban cinemas closed down and in the city a number of theatres were demolished for redevelopment. In 1977 the Plaza was closed as a cinema and the foyer was converted to a McDonald's and the auditorium was converted to a skating rink, concert venue and restaurant. A Heritage order prevented its demolition until 1995 when the auditorium became Planet Hollywood. That area is now a licensed bar.Cinema Treasures Retrieved 20.6.2008 The theatre's organ was built circa 1923 by the Rudolph Wurlitzer Company of North Tonawanda, New York and was installed at the Plaza in 1937 from the Wintergarden Theatre, Brisbane. It was removed around 1968 and the console was relocated to a private residence in Harris Park, New South Wales.Lost organs of Sydney Retrieved 20.6.2008 The building is of historic significance at a State level due to its ability to reflect the inter-war boom period of picture palace buildings in Sydney and for its contribution to the development of Sydney's George Street cinema precinct.

The basic definition of an eco-friendly hotel is an environmentally responsible lodging that follows the practices of green living. These hotels have to be certified green by an independent third-party or by the state they are located in. Traditionally, these hotels were mostly presented as Eco Lodges because of their location, often in jungles, and their design inspired by the use of traditional building methods applied by skilled local craftsmen in areas, such as Costa Rica and Indonesia. These improvements can include non-toxic housekeeping practices, the use of renewable energy, organic soaps, energy- efficient light fixtures, and recycling programs. It is beneficial for these hotels to get certain certifications in order to be environmentally compliant. One beneficial certification specifically for hotels is the LEED certification. A LEED-certified hotel provides benefits to the environment through energy efficient practices. An eco hotel should follow a set of best practices in order to do their part to benefit the environment. Some of these best practices include serving local organic food in restaurants, reusing linens when a guest is staying for more than one night, and incorporating in- room recycling and composting programs. Hotels that have these certifications and best practices can attract environmentally conscious travelers and stand out from other hotels. Criteria An eco hotel must usually meet the following criteria: * Dependence on the natural environment * Ecological sustainability * Proven contribution to conservation * Provision of environmental training programs * Incorporation of cultural considerations * Provision of an economic return to the local community Characteristics Green hotels follow strict green guidelines to ensure that their guests are staying in a safe, non-toxic and energy-efficient accommodation. Here are some basic characteristics of a green hotel: *Housekeeping uses non-toxic cleaning agents and laundry detergent *100% organic cotton sheets, towels and mattresses *Non-smoking environment *Renewable energy sources like solar or wind energy *Bulk organic soap and amenities instead of individual packages to reduce waste *Guest room and hotel lobby recycling bins *Towel and sheet re- use (guests can tell housekeeping to leave these slightly used items to reduce water consumption) *Energy-efficient lighting *On-site transportation with green vehicles *Serve organic and local-grown food *Non-disposable dishes *Offers a fresh-air exchange system *Greywater recycling, which is the reuse of kitchen, bath and laundry water for garden and landscaping *Newspaper recycling program Definition Ecology is a very strong trend, either convictions or a fashion, caring for the earth has become an ideal of many. As a result, eco-hotels have become an increasingly popular alternative in the tourism industry, the increase in demand has led therefore to a large range of hotels with planet friendly options for all requirements. According to the Royal Spanish Academy, one of the interpretations of the term ecology includes \\"defense and protection of nature and environment\\" From what we understand, to be green what is sought is to defend and protect everything natural. around us. contact with nature is something almost inherent to the holiday, providing an opportunity to carry out environmental. An ecological hotel is one that is fully integrated into the environment without damaging the environment, contributing in some way to progress and improvement of the local community and sustainable growth of the tourism industry. The term has been used on a more regular basis as new websites devoted to the subject become more prominent and hotel owners become more interested in protecting the areas their guests have come to visit. New properties are being built from sustainable resources‚Äìtropical hardwoods, local stone‚Äìand designed to better blend in with their environment. In addition, they are also being run on eco- friendly principles, such as serving organic or locally grown food or using natural cooling as opposed to air conditioning. Ecolabels are labeling systems that show the environmental impact of good and services within regions around the world. =Ecolabeling of hotels in Europe= The EU Ecolabel is an official sign of the environmental quality of services and goods in the European Union (EU) that is both certified by an independent organization and valid throughout the many member States of the European Union. Any tourism accommodation operator in the EU - from a large hotel chain to a small farmhouse has been able to apply for the European Eco-label since 2003. The operators must meet strict minimum standards with regard to environmental performance and health standards. These should include the use of renewable energy sources, an overall reduction in energy and water consumption, measures to reduce waste, environmental policy setting and the provision of non-smoking areas. The first eco-labelled hotel in the European Union was the Sunwing Resort Kallithea, located in Rhodes, Greece in 2003 and the first eco-labelled hotel on the Iberian Peninsula (Spain and Portugal) was the Hotel Jardim Atl√¢ntico on the Portuguese island of Madeira. =Ecolabeling of hotels in South America= In Argentina, the Tourism Hotels Association (AHT) has created an annual award, Hoteles M√°s Verdes (Greener Hotel).Hoteles m√°s Verdes, \\"Greener Hotels\\" Contest in South America. The prize ‚Äì a monetary award and peer-recognition ‚Äì goes the best eco-hotels in the country, both operating and under construction. In 2014, the city of Buenos Aires has presented a new labeling system for hotels and hostels, Ecosello.Ecosello Buenos Aires. With three levels of certification (Committed, Advanced, and Excellence), the new label aims at developing eco-consciousness among tourism operators in Buenos Aires  Additional initiatives  Eco hotels may also actively help in protecting its natural environment. For instance, the Misool Eco Resort was started as a funding vehicle for conservation work in the area.Misool Eco Resort: our story A private marine reserve (which has grown to a size of 300 000 acres) was set up, and included a no-take zone. A salaried 15-person team of local rangers (which work for the sister charity, Misool Foundation) patrol the area and have a base camp at Misool Eco Resort (alongside additional locations in the area).Misool Foundation: we are hereMisool Foundation: Misool Marine ReserveThe Misool Foundation also has additional projects, including a collaborative program to end manta hunting in Lakamera (Savu Sea Alliance).Misool Foundation: Our projects For the livelihood of the eco resort itself, the conservation work is also of great importance, as it leverages pristine reefs as its central assetMisool Eco Resort: our story (the resort includes a dive center). The work has even increased this asset as an increase of 250% of biomass was observed over a 6-year period.Misool Eco Resort: our story Besides simply protecting the environment, eco hotels can also help the environment by coral growing initiatives (coral nursery).

Taipans are large, fast, extremely venomous Australasian snakes. The Central Ranges taipan was named one of the top five new species of 2007 by the International Institute for Species Exploration at Arizona State University.Top 10 new species of 2008: Oxyuranus temporalis. International Institute for Species Exploration. Arizona State University. Discovery Dr. Mark Hutchinson, reptile and amphibian curator at the South Australian Museum, caught the immature female taipan while it was crossing a dirt track on a sunny afternoon. The reptile was about one metre (about 40 inches) in total length (body + tail), but because taipan species are among the most venomous snakes in the world, Hutchinson did not inspect the creature on site. He bagged the snake and sent it, along with others captured from the trip, to the Western Australian Museum in Perth for closer inspection. It was not until two weeks later that the new species was studied. At first, it was tentatively identified as a western brown snake because of the similar size and colouring. However, several weeks later, Western Australia Museum reptile collection manager Brad Maryan noticed the now preserved snake had a large, pale head similar to the coastal taipan. The holotype, nicknamed \\"Scully\\" after the X-Files TV character, is an immature snake about a metre long, which means that scientists do not know the true adult size of the species, though some taipans can reach a total length of about three meters (about 10 feet). This is the first new taipan species to be discovered in 125 years. New species Oxyuranus temporalis differs from its two congeneric species Oxyuranus scutellatus and Oxyuranus microlepidotus in lacking a temporolabial scale and having six rather than seven infralabial scales. Phylogenetic analysis of mtDNA sequences showed it to be the sister species of the two previously known taipans. Venom The two other described species of Oxyuranus are among the most venomous land snakes in the world - Oxyuranus microlepidotus ranked the most venomous land snake and Oxyuranus scutellatus the third most venomous after Pseudonaja textilis. The new species, O. temporalis, has a LD50 measured on mice to be 0.075 mg/Kg, making it likely to be extremely dangerous to a human if bitten, albeit less toxic than the inland taipan, which was found by the same study to have a LD50 of 0.0225 mg/Kg.Carmel M.

Liliane Saint-Pierre was born in Molenstede, Flemish Brabant, as Liliane Keuninckx. She started her career in the 1960s when she was 13 years old. The biggest hit of her early success period was \\"We gotta stop\\" sung in Dutch. At that time she performed as Liliane. Her success didn't stay unnoticed. She became acquainted with Claude Fran√ßois, a French singer and producer, and asked him to promote her in France. He accepted the offer, but decided Liliane was too short for a stage name. He added Saint-Pierre to give it a more French sound and together with him as producer Saint-Pierre records about twenty songs. These songs were successful in Belgium and France. Saint-Pierre occurs at the Olympia in Paris. But the collaboration ended abruptly after a disagreement between Claude Fran√ßois and her manager of that time (and father-in-law) Milo De Coster. In the early 1970s, Saint-Pierre took part in the Bible musical Glory Halleluja 2000 by Group Miloscope. Several songs of the musical were released as singles. There was a huge tour set up in churches around Belgium, The Netherlands, Germany and France. After trundling along at the end of the 1970s, Saint-Pierre's career was stuck in a musical deadlock. Said Saint- Pierre: \\"It was almost irreversible, until the Belgian entertainer Bobbejaan Schoepen called me for a series of performances in his park. Suddenly I had a year of work. This decision was taken soon; the mentality of the army was not consistent with my worldview.\\" Saint-Pierre represented Belgium in the Eurovision Song Contest 1987, where she sang \\"Soldiers of Love\\" in Dutch (a song with a strong pacifistic tone). She finished in 11th place with 56 points. Saint-Pierre had already made two previous attempts to reach the Eurovision final. In 1978 she performed the song \\"M√©lodie\\" in Luxembourg's qualifying heat and in 1981 sang \\"Brussel\\" in the Belgian national contest. Following \\"Soldiers of Love\\", Saint-Pierre went on to record quite a few socially-engaged songs throughout her career. After a few more quiet years, she made a successful comeback in 1996 with a new fresh dance sound. Her biggest hit of that period was \\"Ik wil alles met je doen\\", a dance remake of Dusty Springfield's hit \\"In Private\\". With her duet with the popular Flemish boyband Get Ready! entitled \\"Geef me tijd\\", she was discovered by a whole new and younger audience. This resulted in Saint-Pierre being one of the judges in the first season of the Belgian version of the talent show X-Factor. Today Saint-Pierre still frequently records new material and she is still one of the most respected voices and live performers of Belgium.

fruit-flavored syrup. Piraguas are sold by vendors, known as pirag√ºeros, from small colorful pushcarts. Besides Puerto Rico, piraguas can be found in mainland areas of the United States with large Puerto Rican communities, such as New York and Central Florida. Definition In most Spanish-speaking countries, the word piragua means a pirogue, a small, flat-bottomed boat. In Puerto Rico, the word piragua refers to a frozen treat made of shaved ice and covered with fruit flavored syrup. Unlike the American snow cone which is round and resembles a snowball, the piragua is pointy and shaped like a pyramid. The word piragua is derived from the combination of the Spanish words pir√°mide (\\"pyramid\\") and agua (\\"water\\"). In Latin America, frozen treats similar to the piragua are known by many different names. Piraguas, Puerto Rican shave ice Preparation and salePirag√ºeros= Customer posing with a piragua pushcart in Puerto Rico A piragua vendor is known as a \\"pirag√ºero\\". Most pirag√ºeros sell their product from a colorful wooden pushcart that carries an umbrella, instead of from a fixed stand or kiosk. The pirag√ºero makes the treats from the shavings off a block of solid ice inside his cartPuerto Rico Food and drink, Retrieved June 19, 2008 and mixtures of fruit-flavored syrups.Piragua, Retrieved June 19, 2008 The tropical syrup flavors vary from lemon and strawberry to passion fruit and guava. Once the syrups are ready, the pirag√ºero will go to his place of business, which in Puerto Rico is usually close to the town plaza, while in the United States it is usually close to the public parks near Hispanic neighborhoods, to sell his product. Hand ice shaver used by pirag√ºeros In the process of preparing a piragua, the pirag√ºero shaves the ice from the block of ice with a hand ice shaver.History of Snow Cones, Retrieved June 19, 2008 He then puts the shaved ice into a cup and uses a funnel-shaped tool to give it the distinctive pyramid shape. The pirag√ºero finishes making the piragua when he pours the desired flavored syrup over it. Pirag√ºeros only go out on hot sunny days because those are the only days when they can expect good business. Unlike the typical American snow cone, which is often eaten with a spoon, the piragua is eaten straight out of the cup or sipped through a straw. =Flavored syrups= Fruit flavored syrups Flavored syrups commonly used in piraguas include the following: Two of the terms used for fruit flavors in Puerto Rico are not common in other Spanish-speaking places. China, a sweet orange flavor, is referred to as naranja in most other Spanish-speaking locales; however, in Puerto Rico, naranja refers only to the bitter orange. Mel√≥n, an Anglicism derived from the English word watermelon, is called sand√≠a in standard Spanish. Piraguas in the United States mainland A pirag√ºero in NYC posing with his piragua pushcart in the 1920s In the 1940s, during the Puerto Rican Great Migration in which large numbers of Puerto Ricans moved to New York, they took with them their customs and traditions, including the piraguas. According to Holding Aloft the Banner of Ethiopia by Winston James, piraguas were introduced in New York by Puerto Ricans as early as 1926. In his book, James describes the presence of piragua pushcarts during the Harlem Riots against the Puerto Rican migrants in July 1926. Author Miguel Mel√©ndez, who moved from New York City to Chicago in the late 1950s, expresses in his book We Took the Streets: Fighting for Latino Rights the following: The piragua was mentioned by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in a blog post titled \\"What's in Your Piragua?\\" EPA Deputy Administrator Marcus Peacock noted that the EPA had helped the Puerto Rican government negotiate over $1 billion in new water treatment improvements, and added, \\"As this commitment is fulfilled, the water will just get cleaner and cleaner whether it is coming out of a tap or is served in a piragua (no, not a canoe, but a Puerto Rican snow cone) ‚Äì regardless of the weather.\\" Piragua vending is not limited to Puerto Rico and New York. Pirag√ºeros with their piragua pushcarts can be found in Hispanic neighborhoods in Bridgeport, Chicago, Jersey City, Miami, Newark, Philadelphia, and elsewhere. Cultural influence The Puerto Rican piragua has been the subject of paintings and sculpture, a children's book, and songs in a Broadway musical: Monumento al Pirag√ºero in Coamo, Puerto Rico * The painting Carrito de Piraguas (\\"Piragua Pushcart\\") is a mixed media piece by an unknown artist, on exhibit at El Museo del Barrio in New York. * Artist Iv√°n Moura Limardo created a series of piragua-related paintings, including Pirag√ºero 5 and Pirag√ºero 10, which were displayed at the Siena Art Gallery in San Juan, Puerto Rico. * The town of Coamo, Puerto Rico, commissioned the creation of a monument in the honor of the pirag√ºeros. The statue, which is called Monumento al Pirag√ºero, is located in the town plaza. * An educational storybook called Luisito and the Piragua, written in 1979 for children of migrant workers in Connecticut, tells the story of a Puerto Rican boy who moved to the United States and misses his friends and his afternoon treat of a piragua. While on an errand for his mother, Luisito sees a pirag√ºero making piraguas, and is happy to find that he can buy piraguas once more. * The 2008 Broadway production of Lin-Manuel Miranda's musical In the Heights included a song called \\"Piragua\\" and its reprise, in which a local pirag√ºero (known in the play as Piragua Guy) sings about his life and trade in New York's Washington Heights. This character became the basis for a web-based reality-show parody, Legally Brown: The Search for the Next Piragua Guy, directed by Miranda, which featured well-known Broadway actors competing to take over the role.

Early life Zadok was born in 1913 in Rava-Ruska in Eastern Galicia in Austria-Hungary (now Ukraine). He studied philosophy and Jewish studies at the University of Warsaw. He was a member of the Gordonia youth movement in Poland and in the \\"Poale Zion Federation\\" Party. In 1935 he immigrated to the British Mandate of Palestine and joined the Hagana and the Jewish Settlement Police. He studied law at the Hebrew University and was certified as a lawyer. During the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, he joined the IDF as a lawyer in the office of the Chief Military Prosecutor. In 1949 he joined the legislative department of the Ministry of Justice as a deputy of the Attorney-General, a position he held until 1952. Career In 1958 he was elected to the Knesset for Mapai. He was chairman of the Knesset House Committee, member of the Constitution, Law and Justice Committee, chairman of the Subcommittee on Constitutional Affairs, and member and chairman of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. He was involved in the passing of the Law on Inquiry Commissions and the Basic Law: the Government, as well as in attempts to pass basic laws on Legislation and Civil Rights, sections of which were later passed in the Basic Laws on Human Dignity and Freedom and Freedom of Occupation. From 1965 to 1966 he was Minister of Industry and Trade. In 1974 he became Minister of Justice, a position he held until the 1977 \\"Upheaval\\". When Meir Shamgar was made a Judge, Zadok appointed Aharon Barak as Attorney-General. With the assistance of these advisors, he passed the Basic Law: the Military and the Basic Law: the State Economy. Towards the end of his tenure at the Ministry of Justice, the translation of the Mandatory Criminal Law Ordinance was completed, and a new and integrated Penal Code was formulated. In the years 1974 to 1977 he was also the first secular Minister of Religious Affairs. His tenure as Minister of Justice saw investigations of senior figures in the Israeli economy and Israeli politics, including the Yadlin affair, the Dollar Account affair and the suicide of Avraham Ofer. Zadok stood by Barak when he decided to prosecute, and refused calls from within the Labor Party to intervene in the investigation. He opposed the Israeli settlements but allowed them to reside in IDF camps, as a compromise. He was among the initiators of the sarcastically named \\"Brilliant trick\\", in which Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin sacked the National Religious Party ministers, a move which eventually collapsed the government. In 1978, he retired from political life. From 1978 to 1980 he was a lecturer at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In the 1980s and 1990s, alongside his work in his own private law office, Haim Zadok & Co., he devoted time to public activity. During the Kav 300 affair, he called for exercising the full rigor of the law with the Shin Bet, and protested the attempts to subvert the investigation and to grant pardons before the legal process had been completed. He also spoke out against the granting of a pardon to the members of the Jewish Underground and opposed the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. He called for negotiations with the Palestinians and fought against the Law for the Direct Election of the Prime Minister. He also represented Time Magazine when a libel suit was brought against it by Ariel Sharon concerning the Sabra and Shatila massacre. He was a member of many public committees, including the Shamgar Commission, which considered the definition of the role and appointment of the Attorney-General, and he chaired committees that considered the regulation of police activity, the religious councils and the press. In 1991, he was one of the founders of the Israel Democracy Institute and served as the first chairman of its board of directors. In 1993, he was made president of the Press Council. He held liberal views that ruled out government intervention in the free press. In 1999 he was last on One Israel's list for the fifteenth Knesset and received the Solomon Bublick Award of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Zadok died in 2002 of a heart attack during a trip to Germany. He was given the Israel Democracy Institute Award by the IDI. He was cited as one of the Labor Party's greatest leaders by Yossi Sarid and Binyamin Ben-Eliezer.

Australian music educator Neil Moore founded it on the core belief that all humans are naturally musical. Simply Music offers programs for students from birth through old age, with the stated goal that \\"students acquire and retain music as a lifelong companion.\\" Simply Music patterns its approach after primary language acquisition, where speaking comes first. In this it shares some philosophical ground with other developmental approaches like Kod√°ly, Orff Schulwerk, and the Suzuki Method.Campbell, Patricia Shehan and Carol Scott-Kassner. Music in Childhood: From Preschool through the Elementary Grades. New York: Schirmer, 1995. 47-57. Print History Neil Moore began constructing the Simply Music method in the late 20th century while teaching piano to a young blind boy. Since Moore was unsure how to apply traditional methods of reading music, he wondered if an approach, based on his own childhood relationship to music, might work. From about age 3 or 4, Moore would hear music and naturally visualize it as shapes and patterns. At age 7, when his piano teacher would play the songs he was to learn, Moore recognized those same shapes and patterns across the keyboard. Decades later, Moore described his approach to this blind student, giving the boy a way to feel the shapes and patterns on the instrument. Moore continued this process, and within a few months his new student was playing a range of blues, popular, and classical pieces. The boy began using the same approach to teach the songs to his four-year-old sister, who was also blind. This spurred Moore to begin testing his ideas more widely, and he found this approach natural and successful for students of all ages and abilities. Other piano teachers began learning from Moore. When he could no longer personally train them all, Moore founded the Simply Music organization and developed a remote certification program that is currently available to teachers in twelve countries, including the U.S., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.Ashby, Bernadette E. \\"Coming Home: The Story of One Man.\\" A World Where Everyone Plays. Ed. Bernadette E. Ashby. Sunnyvale, CA: Efting Press, 2011. 1-7. Print. Later, Simply Music expanded to support the development of early childhood music education, and also worked with Karen Nisenson to create Simply Music Gateway, an adaptive piano curriculum for children with special needs.  Philosophy  Simply Music's founding premise is similar to Shin'ichi Suzuki‚Äôs claim that any child can learn music.Suzuki, Shinichi. Nurtured by Love: The Classic Approach to Talent Education. Miami: Warner Bros. Publications Inc., 1999. 1-3. Print. But Simply Music extends the concept, like researchers E. McPherson Gary E. McPherson and Graham F. Welch, who write that it is our \\"birthright\\" to \\"be able to communicate and interact musically with others.\\"Welch, Graham F. and Gary E. McPherson. \\"Introduction and Commentary: The Role of Music in People‚Äôs Lives.\\" The Oxford Handbook of Music Education, vol. I. Ed. Gary E. McPherson and Graham F. Welch. New York: Oxford University Press, 2012. 6. Print. In the same degree, Simply Music declares musicality essential to human nature. Adherents identify many everyday activities as fundamentally musical because these activities thoughtlessly fall into patterns of rhythm and pitch. As examples they cite speaking, walking, and brushing teeth. Simply Music seeks both to draw on and to nurture this natural ability by distilling musical concepts into simple patterns.https://simplymusic.com/wp- content/uploads/documents/SMP_StudentBrochure_2016-17.pdf Students use these patterns to begin playing songs in their first lessons. This method is modeled after primary language acquisition, where learners begin by speaking. Many other music education approaches‚Äîincluding Orff Schulwerk and the Dalcroze, Kod√°ly, and Suzuki methods‚Äîengage students physically first and teach notation later. The complete Simply Music program aims to teach music for generalists, who may or may not later choose a specialty such as performing classical music, playing keyboard in a band, or accompanying soloists or theater performers. The program attempts to prepare students with a solid music background that can take them where they choose. The primary goal is for students to keep music in their life, most often for relaxation and enjoyment at home or with family and friends. As such, Simply Music includes a wide variety of musical genres, such as classical, blues, jazz, and popular. Simply Music does not focus on mastering classical concert performance technique. Instead, Simply Music teachers encourage students to play expressively and comfortably, without tension. Pedagogy The Simply Music approach contrasts with many other music learning methods, where the ability to play music depends first on learning to read music. Moore terms these traditional methods reading-based and his approach playing-based. The core playing-based piano pieces are presented in the Foundation Program, a series of 9 levels of 7-10 songs each. The pieces are designed to provide experience with many musical styles and genres, to build students‚Äô physical dexterity at the piano, and to give students hands-on familiarity with fundamental musical concepts. Alongside the Foundation Program, and often using concepts from the Foundation pieces, students learn arrangement, improvisation, composition, chord-reading, and theory. Teachers are required to present all these programs, as they are considered essential to a well-rounded music education. Simply Music maintains that their approach‚Äîbased on learning to recognize patterns inherent in music‚Äîis distinct from learning by rote or by ear. Students learn through patterns on the keyboard, in their fingers, and in the music itself. Students learn the physical shape that a melody line or a chord forms in the hand or on the keyboard. For example, a basic triad such as D Major is seen as a triangle shape on the keyboard, with the two white notes forming the base and the black note at the top. Musical patterns include concepts like repeated rhythmic or melodic patterns (or sequences), melodic sentences, musical forms such as ABA, and chord progressions like the 12-bar blues. Experience with these concepts provides a foundation for learning note-reading during the second year. Simply Music first teaches rhythm notation, followed by pitch reading, and then applies these skills to pieces written in standard music notation. Students learn to read pitches by identifying intervals, rather than individual note- names. This is known as an intervallic approach. Simply Music also uses what they call generative learning, meaning that students write music as an integral part of learning to read music. As students further expand their musicianship, they move into the Development Program, which applies their musical understanding and note-reading skills to increasingly complex written music. Lessons continue to include arrangement, improvisation, composition, chord-reading, and theory. At this phase, students also explore their own musical interests in more depth. Simply Music piano may be taught in either shared or private lessons. The early childhood program is taught in small groups. Early childhood Simply Music partners with an affiliate young childhood music education program, Lynn Kleiner's Music Rhapsody. Music Rhapsody is a music and movement program for infants through age five. Early childhood music education specialist Lynn Kleiner based the program on the Orff Schulwerk philosophy. In keeping with its roots, the program focuses on learning through play and addresses each stage of child development. The program immerses children in music-making through diverse songs, instruments, movement, puppets and visuals. By building a foundation in music and incorporating Simply Music repertoire, it prepares students to transition into the piano program.http://www.musicrhapsody.com/Why-Music-Rhapsody/  Materials  All the Simply Music programs use a variety of multimedia materials to provide multisensory learning. Simply Music Piano students use written music as well as other written materials to remember assignments and track their progress. Video recordings distill the main points of every lesson. Audio recordings help students become familiar with the songs, refine style and technique, and develop ensemble skills. Teacher training is also presented through multimedia materials. Early childhood Music Rhapsody students use a wide variety of specially designed instruments along with movement materials, puppets, and visuals. The program also provides audio recordings for students and teachers, as well as video support for teachers. Repertoire The Simply Music Piano repertoire covers a broad range of styles, including classical, contemporary, jazz, blues, gospel, and other styles from around the world. In addition to the core Foundation pieces, students learn arrangements of each piece, along with accompaniments, teacher- selected written pieces, student-choice songs, and student compositions. A student‚Äôs personal repertoire is called their Playlist. A Playlist is considered essential, partly because a large and varied repertoire helps facilitate lifelong musical engagement. Also, each new piece builds on musical concepts from earlier pieces. The Music Rhapsody curriculum centers around children‚Äôs music, both traditional and contemporary, and also introduces many styles including classical, jazz, blues, and international music.

It is between the area of Coulsdon and Caterham. It is an academy run by the Christian charity Oasis Trust. The conversion to an academy in 2008 attracted a ¬£20 million investment over five years by the government, via the Oasis Trust.  History  Taunton Manor = Taunton Manor opened in 1959. The main buildings have stayed pretty much the same since then, with various extensions being built. = Coulsdon High = Taunton Manor reopened as Coulsdon High in the Summer of 1994. Several new extensions were built for the changeover. In 1999 the school, which was located in an area where some other schools were selective, attempted to change its admissions policy to achieve \\"a more balanced ability range\\", but was prevented from doing so. A further judgement the following year allowed it to retain its feeder primary schools. Coulsdon High received a 'Good' Ofsted judgement in 2001, and was awarded specialist status for maths, science, IT and design technology in 2002. In 2003 the school was reported to be suffering significant financial challenge, with an impending budget deficit that was set to impact the school timetable and staffing levels. The problems were linked to a national school funding crisis. Ofsted's system of inspection changed significantly in 2005, and in 2006 Coulsdon High was put into Special Measures. However a few months later it received its best ever SATS results, and the following year the special measures were revoked by Ofsted when the school was judged to be rapidly improving. The report praised the vision and commitment of the headteacher and senior management team as crucial in setting the agenda for improvement, and also found the school to be in the top 25 per cent of schools for the value it added to students' achievements. However plans to replace Coulsdon High with a sponsored academy were already under way on the grounds that the period in special measures had affected pupil recruitment and created doubt that the school could recover the confidence of local parents quickly enough for financial viability to be restored. Many objected to the plans, claiming that the consultation was flawed and highlighting the school's recent rapid progress. In its final year Coulsdon High achieved the best GCSE results in the school's history, a 41% A* - C pass rate. Coulsdon Academy closed in July 2007, and the occasion was marked with a party, attended by former staff and students. = Oasis Academy Coulsdon = The school reopened again as Oasis Academy Coulsdon on 1 September 2008. The opening ceremony was attended by the then Parliamentary Under Secretary of Schools Lord Adonis and the founder of the Oasis Trust Steve Chalke. The new headteacher was John Murphy. Oasis invested over ¬£20 million of government funding into the school, resulting in the opening of a community health-care centre in 2009 and a sixth form in 2011. In July 2014 the Sixth Form shut down due to poor intake. The academy was rated as \\"good\\" by Ofsted in its first full inspection in 2011, and it maintained that rating under the revised Ofsted framework in 2015. In 2020, the school closed early for the academic year because of the Coronavirus pandemic.

It was named in 1770 by explorer James Cook, after his own vessel, HMS Endeavour, and he used the strait as passage out to the Indian Ocean on his voyage. Geography The Endeavour Strait is approximately in length from its northernmost tip to its southern extremities, and varies from in breadth. The strait is, on average, between deep, and its sandy floor is carpetted with a moderately thick layer of coral. The strait is generally safe to travel through, and is not littered with any major sunken dangers or foul ground, although, for larger vessels, there is potential danger at the strait's western end, at the point that it connects with the Arafura Sea, where the depth of the water is only around . The danger that this shallow western point presents was a barrier that the Dutch explorers of Australia never overcame in their earlier sea explorations of the region. If they had been able to pass through the Endeavour Strait at the time, it is likely they would have discovered eastern Australia approximately one hundred and fifty years before the British did, in 1770, as the Dutch had been successful in mapping most of the west coast of Australia during the early 17th century following Willem Janszoon's sighting of the Cape York Peninsula in 1606. The shallow western end of Endeavour Strait was also responsible for the wrecking of the cutter, America, in November 1844. All on board were supposedly drowned, except 13-year-old Scottish girl Barbara Thompson who was rescued by Torres Strait Islanders living on Prince of Wales Island, the Kaurareg people, with whom she lived for five years. Today, the strait is travelled sparsely by passing small vessels, and its western side is often used as a bank for these ships. Due to the relatively shallow average depth of the strait, especially at its westernmost extremities, and the dangers that this presents, there have been recent calls for the body to be deepened, but there are no plans for this at the present time.

Planetary maps can show any spatially mapped characteristic (such as topography, geology, and geophysical properties) for extraterrestrial surfaces. Products of planetary cartography *Albedo map shows the measured difference in surface reflectivity from the surface of celestial body. *Atlas is a special collection of images of a celestial body surface. The images may be from either ground-based or spacecraft sources. Usually a single scale or set of scales is used throughout the atlas. Atlases can have specific themes (e.g., photographic, specialized to certain problems, thematic, etc.). *Complex (integrated) atlas of groups of celestial bodies is a systematic collection of maps of a group of celestial bodies (e.g., the terrestrial planets, satellites of the gas-giant planets, etc.), giving a capability for the analysis of the collected information through comparative planetology. *Geochemical map shows the distribution of chemical elements or minerals on the surface of a celestial body. *Geologic map is a graphic representation generalizing the geological history of the area covered by the map. It includes information on the structure, distribution, age, and genetic type of rocks on the surface of the celestial body. *Geologic/morphologic map shows the spatial distribution of geologic, geomorphologic, and tectonic features on a celestial body. *Geomorphic map is a graphic representation of the distribution of surface morphological types portrayed in the landforms on a planetary body. Geomorphic maps do not attempt to infer the geologic history of the rocks themselves, but rather the processes that have generated the present surface features. *Geophysical map shows a variety of geophysical information in a spatial representation (such as gravimetric, seismic, and magnetic anomaly maps). *Globe is cartographic representation of the surface of a planetary body on a three-dimensional shape (which can be spherical or non-spherical, such as a tri-axial ellipsoid), preserving the geometric similarity of both locations and outlines features. Globes of spherical planets and irregular objects (e.g., the Martian moon Phobos, the asteroid Eros) have been produced from imaging and remote sensing data obtained from a variety of sources. *Hypsometric map shows the macro-relief features on a planetary surface (for maps produced in Russia). The relief is represented by means of contours or isolines (to show areas at the same relative elevation), and color-coded contour intervals. In other countries, this term can also describe the distribution of elevations on the extraterrestrial object. *Landing site map in planetary cartography is a graphic representation of the region surrounding the site where a spacecraft came to rest on a planetary surface (generally shown at large scale). *Map in planetary cartography is a generalized image of the surface of an extraterrestrial solid body (excluding the Earth), that indicates the location of objects projected mathematically according to the adopted coordinate system used for the projection. Symbols can represent any subject, phenomena or process chosen by the cartographer to be illustrated on the map (a legend defining all symbols should be included to aid the map user). Maps of extraterrestrial territories represent all solar system bodies, with the exception of the Earth; they can be portrayed in a variety of forms, such as electronic (e.g., digital), conventional (printed), multilingual, orthophoto, drawing (e.g., shaded relief), outline, topographic (contoured), and thematic. *Outline map in planetary cartography is a map representing relief with the help of outlines and special symbols. These maps are used as base-maps for thematic and schematic mapping, which allows the user to link visually a represented attribute with a relief feature on the surface. *Physical properties map is a maps of various measured attributes of the extraterrestrial surface, such as albedo (see albedo, in this section), thermal anomalies (e.g., the distribution of hotspots on the Earth-facing hemisphere of the Moon), and polarimetric measurements. *Synoptic map in planetary cartography is a graphic representation of attributes (e.g., pressure, temperature, etc.) that describe the weather above a planetary surface (e.g., a map of weather on Mars). *Tectonic map in planetary cartography is a graphic representation of structural elements related to the tectonic history of the upper crust of a planetary body. The different structural areas and their separate elements (e.g., faults and folds) are shown by various symbols; when combined with a geologic map, data regarding the age and type of rocks comprising the structural elements are given, along with their development in time. *Thematic map in planetary cartography is a map showing the spatial representation of physical properties for a planetary surface (e.g., hypsometric, geophysical, geologic-morphologic, and geochemical maps). *Terrain map in planetary cartography is a graphic representation of the distribution of boundaries between mapped regions on the planetary body, showing the presence or absence of characteristic details of a surface (e.g., impact craters, hills, faults, lava flows, aeolian cover, etc.). Such maps are usually produced by data obtained by remote sensing. See also geologic/morphologic map, photogeologic map. ReferencesFurther reading *Hargitai H. (ed.)

New Zealand has maintained a strong and steadfast relationship with Britain. The two countries are related through mutual migration, through shared military history, through a shared system of government, through language, through the Commonwealth (formerly British Empire), and their sharing of the same person as constitutional monarch (Queen Elizabeth II).  History  Pre-independence relations = During his first voyage, British navigator James Cook reached New Zealand on 6 October 1769. Secret directives had been supplied to Cook for this portion of his expedition, instructing him to search firstly for the fabled Terra Australis and, if unsuccessful, to make instead as extensive an exploration of the New Zealand coast as resources allowed. The document that Cook was given declared that these missions were intended to further demonstrate Great Britain's maritime prowess, to bring honour to the Crown and to explore new opportunities for trade and navigation. Almost sixty years later, formal British representation in New Zealand began with the posting of James Busby to the islands as the British Resident, who was sent in response to the concerns of a number of northern MƒÅori leaders over the lawlessness of local European settlers. Since 1816, a number of MƒÅori chiefs had travelled to England and the colonies to explore options for the establishing of a MƒÅori government and, in 1834, Busby drafted the Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand, ratified by a number of northern chiefs in 1835. As part of this process, King William IV recognised and agreed to act as protector for the newly formed state. The Treaty of Waitangi was formed, which was signed by a number of MƒÅori chiefs and representatives of the British Crown on 6 February 1840. British sovereignty was declared later in May of that year. New Zealand became a separate British Colony in 1841 and, eleven years later, the British Parliament passed the first fully implemented Act to grant self-governance to the new colony. Formal British influence gradually diminished, as the power of successive Governors waned with respect to that of the nascent New Zealand Parliament. Dominion status followed in 1907, providing almost complete independence from the government of Britain and New Zealand separately joined the League of Nations in 1926. The Balfour declaration of 1926 emphasised the equal status of members of the British Empire and their free association in the British Commonwealth, (latterly the Commonwealth of Nations). With the 1931 Statute of Westminster, the complete independence of the Dominions was confirmed by the British Parliament, though this was not adopted in New Zealand until some time later, through the Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1947. = Settlers = Much of the migration to New Zealand took place from the constituent countries of the British Isles. This was facilitated from 1839 by the New Zealand Company founded for the purpose of colonization. The work of the Otago Association and Canterbury Association in establishing the primarily Scottish settlement in Dunedin and the primarily English settlement in Christchurch, respectively, encouraged further New Zealand-bound emigration from Britain. Around 80% of New Zealanders are of at least partially British ancestry, and an estimated 17% are entitled to British passports. In recent years there has been growing support for the idea of freedom of movement between the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, with citizens being able to live and work in any of the four countries - similar to the Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement between Australia and New Zealand.  Toponymy  Captain James Cook's map of New Zealand, using a mixture of English and MƒÅori place-names. From the anglicisation of the Dutch appellation Nieuw Zeeland onward, historical ties with the United Kingdom have contributed substantially to New Zealand's toponymy. James Cook's early map combined local MƒÅori place-names with a number of his own coinages. Subsequent settlers added references to places in United Kingdom, aristocratic sponsors, early British explorers, the Royal Family, battles in which the United Kingdom was involved and notable institutions such as Christ Church, Oxford. Many of these contributions have been retained in common usage, often alongside pre-existing MƒÅori placenames.  Law  Through the first Act of the First New Zealand Parliament (in 1854), those applicable English laws that were enacted prior to the appointment of William Hobson, were adopted in New Zealand. As such, New Zealand inherited an uncodified constitution but, unlike the other former dominions, it has not been codified through an overarching document or documents.Contrast with Constitution of Canada, Constitution of South Africa, Constitution of Australia, Constitution of the Irish Free State Enactments by the UK Parliament specifically and substantially relating to New Zealand include: * Canterbury Settlement Lands Act 1850 * Canterbury Association Act 1851 * New Zealand Constitution Act 1846 (repealed 1852) * New Zealand Constitution Act 1852 (repealed by the Constitution Act 1986) * New Zealand Boundaries Act 1863 * Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865 (repealed 1947) * Statute of Westminster 1931 (leading to the New Zealand adoption Act - Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1947) * New Zealand Constitution Amendment Act 1947 (as a result of the New Zealand Constitution (Request and Consent) Act 1947) * Taxation ** The Double Taxation Relief (Taxes on Income) (New Zealand) Order 2004 ** The Double Taxation Relief and International Tax Enforcement (Taxes on Income and Capital) (New Zealand) Order 2008 A number of these acts were repealed through the Statute Law (Repeals) Act 1989.  Citizenship and nationality  The British Nationality and New Zealand Citizenship Act 1948 established the legal concept of New Zealand citizenship; prior to this, all people born or naturalised in New Zealand had the status of \\"British subject\\", just as those born or naturalised in the United Kingdom, or any of the other dominions. At a similar time, those in the dominions were omitted from a new status, defined in the British Nationality Act 1948, of \\"Citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies\\", a forerunner to the modern concept of British citizenship. New Zealand passports carried the wording \\"British Subject\\" until the Citizenship Act 1977.  Economic relations  Britain tied itself somewhat to European trade in recent years though it‚Äôs membership of the European Union between 1973 when it first joined what was then known as the European Communities (the Common Market) and 2020 when it left the bloc, forcing New Zealand and Australia to seek new markets and trade with the Asia- Pacific region. New Zealand has a large influence over former British colonies in the Pacific and the British territory of Pitcairn. Up to about the 1960s, New Zealand also had extremely close economic relations with the United Kingdom, especially considering the distance at which trade took place. As an example, in 1955, Britain took 65.3 percent of New Zealand's exports, and only during the following decades did this dominant position begin to decline when the United Kingdom joined the European Economic Community (now the European Union) in 1973, with the share of exports going to Britain having fallen to only 6.2 percent in 2000. Historically, some industries, such as dairying, a major economic factor in the former colony, had even more dominant trade links, with 80‚Äì100% of all cheese and butter exports going to Britain from around 1890 to 1940.New Zealand Historical Atlas ‚Äì McKinnon, Malcolm (Editor); David Bateman, 1997, Plate 61 According to the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, recent annual New Zealand exports to the United Kingdom have accounted for at least NZ$1.76 billion worth of trade, and over NZ$1 billion in the opposite direction. Meat products make up almost half of exports and the largest imports are machinery and vehicles. A bilateral business association, British New Zealand Business Association Inc., was established in 1917 and aims to promote reciprocal trade and the interests of association members undertaking trade between the two nations.For more information:  Travel  400px According to the New Zealand High Commission in London, Britain is the third largest source of tourists to New Zealand. London has the highest density of people born in New Zealand of all British regions, 47% of them choosing to live there according to the 2001 census.  Sport  Several popular sports in New Zealand find their origins in English sporting history such as rugby union, rugby league and cricket. The first interclub rugby union match in New Zealand, in Nelson, took place in 1870 and was inspired by a teacher returning from England with a knowledge of the new game. The London New Zealand Cricket Club is a popular cricket team which plays in the United Kingdom.  Co-involvement in international organizations and multilateral treaties  New Zealand and Britain are both members of a number of international bodies, including the United Nations, the Commonwealth of Nations and the OECD. Defence arrangements involving both Britain and New Zealand include the Five Power Defence Arrangements, and the UK-USA Security Agreement for intelligence sharing. Since 2006, New Zealand has been a party to the ABCA interoperability arrangement of national defence forces, which has always included Britain. ANZUK was a tripartite force formed by Australia, New Zealand and Britain to defend the Asian Pacific region after Britain withdrew forces from the east of Suez in the early seventies. The ANZUK force was formed in 1971 and disbanded in 1974. The SEATO anti-communist defence organisation also extended membership to both countries for the duration of its existence from 1955 to 1977.  Bilateral representation  New Zealand has maintained a resident Head of Mission in the United Kingdom since 1871. The current High Commissioner from New Zealand to the United Kingdom is Sir Jerry Mateparae. The current High Commissioner from the United Kingdom to New Zealand is Laura Clarke. The governor-general of New Zealand fulfilled the role of the High Commissioner from the United Kingdom to New Zealand from its inception until 1939. Subsequently, separate appointments were made; this distinguished the representation of the British Government in New Zealand from that of the shared monarch, in sympathy with the principles set out under the Balfour declaration thirteen years earlier. Several New Zealand public bodies have official representatives in Britain and Honorary Consuls are based in the UK constituent countries of Scotland and Northern Ireland.  Official visits  Regular ministerial and VIP visits from New Zealand to Britain, and vice versa, take place each year. During 2009, at least 10 such official visits took place from New Zealand to the United Kingdom and at least 8 from the United Kingdom to New Zealand.

The house was founded by Jaroslav of Hru≈°tice (1234‚Äì1269) and named after Vald≈°tejn Castle near Turnov in northern Bohemia. The family's most prominent members include Albrecht von Wallenstein, the Imperial general during the Thirty Years' War, and Ferdinand Ernst von Waldstein, a statesman and early patron of Ludwig van Beethoven.  History  The Waldstein noble family originated from the medieval Markvartici clan, which gained influence at the P≈ôemyslid court in Prague under King Ottokar II of Bohemia. From about 1260, Burgrave Jaroslav of Hru≈°tice (1234‚Äì1269) had Vald≈°tejn Castle erected. His son Zdenƒõk was the first documented \\"Lord of Vald≈°tejn\\"; allegedly he accompanied King Ottokar II on his Prussian crusade. Upon his death, his possessions were divided among his numerous descendants. 180px The Waldsteins again appeared in public life from the 15th century onwards. Formerly a poor and less significant family, they gradually acquired large properties in the territory of the Crown of Bohemia (especially in Bohemia and Moravia), received prominent positions and ‚Äì since the 17th century onward ‚Äì produced many statesmen and civil servants. Albrecht von Wallenstein himself came from a modest cadet branch which since 1548 held the small estate of He≈ômanice. After the 1620 Battle of White Mountain, he purchased several confiscated lordships of his Protestant relatives. In 1628, he was one of the first among the Bohemian nobility to be promoted to Graf (count) status, then to Reichsgraf (imperial count) two years later. Vald≈°tejn Castle ruins in Czech Republic After uniting with the extinct line of another Bohemian noble family, the Lords of Vartenberk (), the present family title since 1758 is \\"Count of Waldstein, Lord of Wartenberg\\". After World War II, the Waldsteins, then almost completely Germanized, were expelled from Czechoslovakia and their possessions were seized. They then moved to Salzburg and Vienna in Austria, where parts of the family live to this day, but others returned to Bohemia. Possessions Vald≈°tejn Castle was the historical main seat of the family until 1821. In 1582, they purchased the lands of the secularized monastery of T≈ôeb√≠ƒç. Mnichovo Hradi≈°tƒõ Castle was acquired by Wallenstein in 1623. He was buried there and it remained in his family until expropriation in 1945; so did Wallenstein's Prague city palace, Wallenstein Palace. In 1622, he had also purchased the lordship of Bƒõl√° pod Bezdƒõzem, which was owned by the family until 1945. Duchcov Chateau passed into the family by inheritance from the House of Lobkowicz in 1642, together with Horn√≠ Litvinov, Doln√≠ Litvinov and Doln√≠ Ji≈ôet√≠n, and the Duchcov branch kept it until 1921. In 1945, all properties in Czechoslovakia were confiscated. In the same year, however, a branch of the Waldstein-Wartenberg family inherited Karlslust Castle near Hardegg in Austria, together with Burgruine Kaja and the estate of Niederfladnitz, all located directly at the Czech border and still today owned by the family.

It was fought to capture a strategically important island group off the western coast of Formosa (Taiwan). Admiral Am√©d√©e Courbet, with part of the French Far East Squadron, bombarded the Chinese coastal defences around the principal town of Makung (È¶¨ÂÖ¨) on Penghu Island (ÊæéÊπñÂ≥∂) and landed a battalion of marine infantry which routed the Chinese defenders and occupied Makung.Duboc, 295‚Äì303; Garnot, 179‚Äì95; Huard, 723‚Äì31; Loir, 291‚Äì317 The Pescadores were occupied by the French until July 1885 and Admiral Courbet, by then a national hero in France, died aboard his flagship Bayard in Makung harbour during the occupation.  Background  The Pescadores Islands, also known from their Chinese name as P'eng-hu (ÊæéÊπñ), were an important transit stop for reinforcements to the Chinese army under the command of Liu Ming-ch'uan (ÂäâÈäòÂÇ≥) confronting the French in northern Taiwan around Keelung (Âü∫ÈöÜ), and their capture would prevent further reinforcements from reaching Taiwan. Courbet had wanted to mount an expedition to capture the Pescadores for several months, but the feasibility of the operation depended on the progress of the Keelung Campaign. Colonel Jacques Duchesne's defeat of Liu Ming-ch'uan's forces and capture of the key Chinese position of La Table on 7 March 1885 finally disengaged Keelung, allowing the French to detach troops from its garrison for a descent on the Pescadores.Garnot, 177‚Äì8  French and Chinese forces  Courbet's flotilla consisted of the ironclads Bayard and Triomphante, the cruisers d'Estaing and Duchaffaut, the gunboat Vip√®re and the troopship Annamite. His landing force consisted of an understrength battalion of marine infantry (400 men as opposed to the usual complement of 600 men) under the command of chef de bataillon Lange and a marine artillery section of two 80-millimetre mountain guns (Lieutenant Lubert).Garnot, 178‚Äì9Lange's battalion consisted of the 25th, 26th, 27th and 30th Companies, 2nd Marine Infantry Regiment (Captains Logos, Harlay, Cramoisy and Vaillance). The Chinese garrison of the Pescadores, which had been substantially reinforced at the beginning of 1885, was commanded by the generals Chou Shan-ch'u (Âë®ÂñÑÂàù) and Cheng Ying-chieh (ÈÑ≠ËÜ∫Êù∞), and numbered around 2,400 men.Duboc, 300; Lung Chang, 329 A number of foreign officers served with the Chinese garrison, including an American officer named Nelson, responsible for the defence of one of the Makung forts, whose diary of events was later recovered by the French. Initially optimistic, by March 1885 Nelson had despaired of training up the Chinese gunners to the standard necessary to meet the French in battle.Duboc, 300; Lung Chang, 329 The Pescadores Islands were occupied by the French in March 1885 The Pescadores campaign, March 1885 (map by Captain Garnot of the 3rd African Battalion) The fortifications of the Pescadores were designed primarily to protect Makung and deny entrance to Makung Bay, and also if possible to cover the southern entrance to P'eng-hu Bay, which would have to be traversed first by an attacking squadron. The most formidable obstacles were the two Makung forts, placed on either side of the entrance to Makung Bay. The Northern Fort, just to the southwest of Makung, deployed three Armstrong cannons, and was flanked by a number of subsidiary positions in which the Chinese had deployed a dozen rifled French Voruz cannon of various calibres. The Southern Fort, or Dutch Fort (it had been built by the Dutch in the seventeenth century), was armed with two 22-centimetre and two 14-centimetre smoothbore cannon. A third battery, sited on Observatory Island just inside Makung Bay, also covered the entrance to the bay, which had also been blocked by a barrier of chains. The Observatory Island battery was armed with two Armstrong cannon and a Chinese 20-centimetre cannon. The Chinese had also built a battery armed with smoothbore cannon to sweep the plain to the east of Makung and a large entrenched camp to the north of the town to house the regular troops of the island's garrison.Garnot, 180‚Äì81; Loir, 295 The outer Chinese defences were much weaker. The southern entrance to P'eng-hu Bay was covered on the west by the Hsiaochi battery on Fisher Island (modern Hsi-yu, Ë•øÂ∂º), and on the east by a battery on Plate Island. The Hsiaochi battery was replaced in the late 1880s by the Hsi Tai battery, whose ruins can still be seen today. The Plate Island battery was quite close to the Southern Fort, and could also cover the approach to Makung Bay. Unfortunately for the Chinese, both these batteries were armed only with a mixture of antiquated smoothbore pieces that offered little threat to the French squadron.Garnot, 181; Loir, 296  The campaign  French sailors cut a gap in the Chinese barrage protecting the harbour of Makung, 30 March 1885 The French flotilla concentrated off Tai-wan-fu (Âè∞ÁÅ£Â∫ú, modern Tainan, Âè∞Âçó) on 28 March, and approached the Pescadores from the west before dawn on 29 March. During the morning of 29 March the French warships bombarded and silenced the Hsiaochi battery and other Chinese shore batteries guarding the approaches to Makung.Garnot, 185‚Äì6; Loir, 298‚Äì302 In the late afternoon Lange's battalion was put ashore on the southern cape of P'eng-hu Island, at Dome Hill, where it set up a defensive position for the night. There were no Chinese in sight, and the landing was made without resistance.Garnot, 186; Loir, 302 During the night of 29 March the French sent boats to scout a barrage of chains thrown across the entrance to Makung harbour. The scouting party discovered that no mines had yet been attached to the chains, and at dawn on 30 March a party of sailors from Bayard went forward in launches to cut a gap in the barrage. Chinese riflemen tried to disrupt this operation, and one French sailor was killed.Garnot, 186‚Äì9; Loir, 302‚Äì3 With the barrage breached, Courbet's flotilla entered Makung Bay during the morning of 30 March and bombarded the defences of Makung. At the same time, Lange's battalion left its bivouac on Dome Hill and began to advance towards Makung, its flanks covered by d'Estaing and Vip√®re in Makung Bay and Annamite in Dome Bay. The column was guided towards its objective by an elderly local fisherman, who had volunteered his services for pay. During the afternoon Lange's men cleared a force of Chinese infantry from the village of Kisambo and closed up to the village of Siu-kuei- kang (modern Suo-kang, ÈéñÊ∏Ø), which was strongly held by the Chinese. Lange's men bivouacked for the night to the west of the village, ready to attack the Chinese the following morning. During the evening the French column was reinforced by the landing companies of Bayard, Triomphante and d'Estaing and by four 65-millimetre cannon.Garnot, 189‚Äì91; Loir, 303‚Äì4 French troops enter Makung, 31 March 1885 On the morning of 31 March Lange attacked the main Chinese defensive line around Siu-kuei-kang. Although the marine infantry and sailors were heavily outnumbered, French naval gunfire tipped the balance in their favour. The Chinese were driven back from their positions and attempted to make a second stand before Makung, near the village of Amo. Lange attacked them again, with equal success, and occupied Makung late in the afternoon.Garnot, 191‚Äì3; Loir, 305‚Äì6 Most of the defeated Chinese soldiers escaped to Amoy (Xiamen, ÂªàÈñÄ) in mainland China or to Tai-wan-fu on junks and fishing boats under cover of darkness, though a number of soldiers were caught and handed over to the victorious French by the inhabitants of the Pescadores, who saw no reason to distinguish between two equally unwelcome sets of intruders.Loir, 315 French casualties in the Pescadores campaign were 5 killed and 12 wounded. The wounded included one officer, lieutenant de vaisseau Poirot of Triomphante. Chinese casualties may have amounted to 300 dead and around 400 wounded, and included several senior officers.Garnot, 193; Loir, 306 The French were told by islanders that the American artillery officer Nelson was beheaded during the bombardment of 29 March on the orders of an enraged Chinese commander, because his guns were unable to make any effective reply to the French warships.Duboc, 300 The French bombardment of the Chinese positions on the Pescadores was heard in Tai-wan-fu (modern Tainan) on the Formosan mainland. The British missionary William Campbell described the impact of the battle on the town's inhabitants: Admiral Courbet acknowledges the acclamation of his troops after the capture of Makung > One quiet afternoon during the spring of 1885 the people of Formosa were > startled on hearing what seemed to them the sound of distant thunder. It was > not thunder, but the ponderous ironclads of France engaged in demolishing > the fortifications over against Fisher Island and Makung.

Although it was a minor operation compared with the capture of S∆°n T√¢y or the Battle of Foochow, in the eyes of his officers it was his most flawless military achievement. Significantly, Courbet directed operations in person, and chose to fight this brief colonial campaign in the traditional style, with ships of the French navy supporting the land operations of marine infantry and artillery. The decision reflected inter-service rivalries. Courbet was cocking a snook at the army ministry, which had long ago wrested the direction of the Tonkin campaign away from the navy ministry. His timing was perfect. While the army ministry was struggling to explain away General Fran√ßois de N√©grier's defeat in the battle of Bang Bo (24 March 1885) and the subsequent French retreat from L·∫°ng S∆°n, Courbet presented the navy ministry with an elegant, almost bloodless victory in the Pescadores. The Sino-French War ended on a high note for the French navy and the Troupes de Marine. On 27 July 1885, in the wake of an enquiry into their conduct, the defeated Chinese generals Chou Shan-chu and Cheng Ying-chieh were demoted and punished for the loss of the Pescadores by being posted to the remote northern Chinese province of Heilungkiang (ÈªëÈæçÊ±ü).Lung Chang, 329 Courbet's flotilla in the Pescadores campaign Image:FrenchShipBayard.jpgBayard Image:Triomphante.jpgTriomphante  Significance of the campaign  The news of the French capture of the Pescadores initially caused little stir in Paris, as the headlines in early April 1885 were monopolised by the so-called 'Tonkin affair' (the collapse of Jules Ferry's government on 30 March 1885 in the wake of the retreat from L·∫°ng S∆°n).Lung Chang, 329 Courbet's victory also came too late to affect the conclusion of preliminaries of peace between France and China on 4 April 1885, but it may have helped to prevent the peace agreement from being sabotaged by hardline elements in China and by the Chinese army commanders fighting the French in northern Vietnam (Tonkin). The Kwangsi Army commanders Wang Te-pang (ÁéãÂæ∑Ê¶ú) and Feng Tzu-tsai (È¶ÆÂ≠êÊùê), whose forces had recently won a notable victory in the battle of Bang Bo (24 March 1885) and reoccupied L·∫°ng S∆°n, received the order to cease fire with consternation. The regional mandarins Pao Chao (ÈÆëË∂Ö), Tsen Yu-ying (Â≤ëÊØìËã±) and Peng Yu-lin (ÂΩ≠ÁéâÈ∫ü), who were directing the war effort against the French in southern China, urged the Ch'ing court to continue the struggle against France. The court replied firmly on 10 April 1885 that it was necessary to make peace immediately because the loss of the Pescadores placed the whole of Taiwan in jeopardy: > The Kwangsi Army has recovered L·∫°ng S∆°n, but the French now occupy P'eng-hu. > If Generals Feng and Wang do not cease military operations now, after saving > China's military honour, the overall situation in China will once again > worsen. It is very dangerous to send an army deep into a strange country, > and nothing is certain in warfare. Even if we are successful, Vietnam does > not belong to us. But Taiwan is a part of China. If money and reinforcements > fail to get through to Taiwan, we will lose it and never get it back. It > will then be difficult both to fight on and to make peace, so why should we > consider it? Why should we not end the war now, after having won a victory? This communication silenced the protests from the hardliners, and ensured that the peace with France held.Eastman, 190‚Äì5; Lung Chang, 366  The French occupation of the Pescadores  French soldiers and local townsfolk pose for the camera in front of a temple in Makung Makung became the main base for Courbet's Far East Squadron for the remainder of the war and during a brief period of occupation in the summer of 1885. The Sino-French War ended in April 1885, and under the terms of the peace settlement the French continued to occupy the Pescadores until July, as a surety for the withdrawal of the Chinese armies from Tonkin. Makung Bay was a superb natural harbour, and many of the squadron's officers hoped that France would retain its recent conquest as a counterweight to the British colony of Hong Kong. They even renamed the islands the √Æles des P√™cheurs ('the fishermen's islands', a French version of the Portuguese name 'Pescadores') in anticipation of their future destiny as a French colony. This was never a realistic prospect. France had fought the war to oust the Chinese from Tonkin, not to make colonial conquests in China itself, and the French punctiliously evacuated the Pescadores on 22 July 1885.Loir, 337 Courbet issued strict instructions that his troops should pay for everything they needed, and the islanders seized the opportunity to make as much money as possible out of the occupying forces during their brief sojourn in the Pescadores. Food markets sprang up around the French cantonments.Loir, 329 The French were also interested in buying exotic reminders of their stay in the Far East, and local entrepreneurs, including the abbots of Buddhist monasteries, hastened to satisfy their demand for bronze Buddhas, carved screens and other characteristic souvenirs.Loir, 330‚Äì1 Lieutenant Louis Jehenne. Jehenne died at Makung in June 1885 During their occupation the French surveyed the coastal waters around the islands and considerably improved the rudimentary facilities of Makung harbour.Loir, 328 Meanwhile, during the summer of 1885, nearly thirty French warships of the Far East Squadron rode peacefully at anchor off Makung, in the largest concentration of French naval power in the Far East in the history of the French Navy.Loir, 327 Several dozen French soldiers and sailors succumbed to cholera during the French occupation of the Pescadores. Cholera broke out within one or two days of the landing, and by 23 April 15 men had died and a further 20 had been hospitalised. The disease had probably been brought over from Keelung by the marine infantry of Lange's battalion, but the French suspected that it originated in Makung, whose Chinese population lived in cramped and insanitary conditions. Courbet therefore isolated the French cantonments from contact with any possible contagion from Makung. All Chinese houses within a certain distance were demolished to create a cordon sanitaire around the French barracks, several nearby mosquito-ridden streams were filled in, and each barrack hut was disinfected with iron sulphate and phenic acid. These precautions gradually brought the disease under control, and most of the French troops hospitalised in April recovered in May.Garnot, 212; Loir, 328‚Äì9 Courbet's monument and the graves of sous-commissaire Dert and Lieutenant Jehenne, photographed in 1895 during a visit by the French cruiser Forfait to Makung However, the precautions came too late for Admiral Courbet himself, who contracted cholera at the beginning of June and died aboard his flagship Bayard in Makung harbour on the night of 11 June 1885.Loir, 338‚Äì41 Courbet's body was taken back to France for a state funeral, but the other French dead were buried in two cemeteries at Makung, one for the marine infantry of Lange's battalion and the other for the sailors of the Far East Squadron. Two commemorative obelisks erected in the summer of 1885 in these cemeteries can still be seen. One is in Makung itself, the other on the tip of the southern cape that encloses Makung harbour, formerly known as Dutch Point (from the ruins of an old Dutch fort there). Both bear almost identical inscriptions: A la memoire des soldats [marins] fran√ßais d√©ced√©s √† Makung ('To the memory of the French soldiers [sailors] who died at Makung'). A third obelisk, erected by Admiral S√©bastien Lesp√®s as a monument to Courbet's memory, was removed in 1954, but its marble inscription has been preserved: A la memoire de l'amiral Courbet et des braves morts pour la France aux Pescadores en 1885 ('To the memory of Admiral Courbet and the brave men who died for France in the Pescadores in 1885').Rouil, 149‚Äì68 The bodies of two marine infantry officers who died of cholera in early June 1885, sous-commissaire Marie-Joseph-Louis Dert and Lieutenant Louis Jehenne, were originally buried in front of Courbet's monument (Courbet had attended their funerals only days before his own death). In 1954, under an agreement reached between the French and ROC governments, their remains were exhumed with full military honours and transferred to the French Cemetery at Keelung aboard the national frigate Commandant Pimodan, where they rest today alongside their old comrades in the Formosa Expeditionary Corps and the Far East Squadron.Rouil, 149‚Äì68 NotesFootnotesReferences * * Duboc, E., Trente cinq mois de campagne en Chine, au Tonkin (Paris, 1899) * Eastman, L., Throne and Mandarins: China's Search for a Policy during the Sino-French Controversy (Stanford, 1984) * * Huard, L., La guerre du Tonkin (Paris, 1887) * Loir, M., L'escadre de l'amiral Courbet (Paris, 1886) * Lung Chang [ÈæçÁ´†], Yueh-nan yu Chung-fa chan-cheng [Ë∂äÂçóËàá‰∏≠Ê≥ïÊà∞Áà≠, Vietnam and the Sino-French War] (Taipei, 1993) * Rollet de l'Isle, M., Au Tonkin et dans les mers de Chine (Paris, 1886) * Rouil, C., Formose: des batailles presque oubli√©es (Taipei, 2001) * Thomazi, A., La conqu√™te de l'Indochine (Paris, 1934)  External links  'Un champ de bataille ramen√© √† la vie' (French website on the Pescadores Islands) Category:Battles involving Taiwan Category:Military history of Taiwan Category:Sino-French War Category:Conflicts in 1885 Category:1885 in France Category:1885 in China Category:1885 in Taiwan Category:March 1885 events ","title":"Pescadores campaign (1885)"},{"id":"18018717","text":"Female Pegomya testacea on grass in a meadow Pegomya is a genus of flies within the family Anthomyiidae.

Early life H√ºnefeld was born in K√∂nigsberg, East Prussia, the son of the owner of Braxeinswalde near Preu√üisch Eylau, where he grew up. He was blind on his left eye and near-sighted on his right, and his childhood was characterized by several serious diseases. After attending school in Berlin, he studied at Berlin University and came in contact with the first flight pioneers at Berlin's Johannisthal Air Field. At the beginning of World War I he tried to join the German Air Service as a volunteer, but was rejected due to his poor health. After that he volunteered again as a motorcyclist, and was wounded in September 1914 in Flanders, which led to a shortened left leg. Due to his handicaps he could not return to service and joined the German Diplomatic Service, serving in Sofia, Constantinople, and as an Imperial Vice Consul in the Netherlands. After the end of World War I he stayed in the Netherlands for one and a half years with the German Crown Prince Wilhelm, before returning to Germany, where he worked as spokesman for the Norddeutscher Lloyd shipping company in Bremen. First east-west transatlantic flight Bremen after the transatlantic crossing After Charles Lindbergh crossed the Atlantic from West to East in May 1927, the idea of flying in the opposite direction, which is more difficult because of the prevailing winds, became more and more popular. In 1927 H√ºnefeld bought two Junkers W 33 aircraft from the Junkers company in Dessau, naming them after the two Norddeutscher Lloyd flagships and . His plans were supported by Hugo Junkers and Hermann K√∂hl, a World War I pilot and head of the Deutsche Luft Hansa Nightflight Branch. After some test flights, and breaking the record for flight duration, H√ºnefeld and K√∂hl flew to Baldonnel, Ireland, where they met James C. Fitzmaurice, the Irish Air Corps Commandant of the Baldonnel Airodrome. On 12 April 1928 these three left Baldonnel in the Bremen and crossed the Atlantic Ocean, landing at Greenly Island at the south coast of Labrador, Canada. Even though they failed to reach their original goal, New York City, they were the first to cross the Atlantic from Europe to America. By a special act of the Congress of the United States on May 2, 1928, H√ºnefeld and his two companions were awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. Round- the-world flight attempt On 18 September 1928 von H√ºnefeld and Swedish pilot Karl Gunnar Lindner took off from Berlin in the Europa in an attempt to fly around the world. In Bushire, Iran, they met Friedrich Karl von Koenig- Warthausen who went on to complete the first solo circumnavigation principally by air. After they arrived in Tokyo on 20 October, the flight was abandoned because of poor weather conditions and H√ºnefeld's declining health. H√ºnefeld died in February 1929 in Berlin from stomach cancer and is buried in the Landeseigener Friedhof Berlin-Steglitz cemetery.Berlin.de References Literature    Category:1892 births Category:1929 deaths Category:Aviation pioneers Category:20th-century German aviation Category:German aviators Category:Barons of Germany Category:People from K√∂nigsberg Category:People from East Prussia Category:Deaths from stomach cancer Category:German aviation record holders Category:20th-century German people Category:German military personnel of World War I ","title":"Ehrenfried G√ºnther Freiherr von H√ºnefeld"},{"id":"18018742","text":"Herbert Joseph Pedersen (born April 27, 1944 in Berkeley, California) is an American musician, guitarist, banjo player, and singer-songwriter who has played a variety of musical styles over the past forty years including country, bluegrass, progressive bluegrass, folk, folk rock, country rock, and has worked with numerous musicians in many different bands.

Life Several of his ancestors had occupied canonries in Fr√©jus, the history and traditions of which they had investigated and preserved. Joseph, feeling himself called to the priesthood, betook himself to Lyon, where he entered on the study of theology under the Jesuit P√®re La Chaise. On being ordained, he returned to Provence, and was soon made canon of the Cathedral of Fr√©jus, though he preferred study. His uncles, Pierre and Nicolas, had published a work on the former incumbents of the See of Fr√©jus; Joseph resolved to devote himself especially to the history of the French Catholic Church, beginning with his own diocese. In 1694, Anthelmi was made vicar-general to the Bishop of Pamiers; but his health was bad, and he returned to his native city in a vain attempt to recuperate. Here he died in his forty-ninth year. Controversy His first work appeared in 1680, De inito ecclesiae Forojuliensis dissertatio chronologica, critica, profano-sacra. Pasquier Quesnel, was then at the height of his reputation, and was agitating France on the question of the real author of the De vocatione gentium, the Responsiones pro Augustino ad Capitula Gallorum and the Epistola ad Demetriadem (Patrologia Latina, LI, 647,158; LV, 162). In his opinion these had been written by Leo the Great. Against him Anthelmi supported the authorship of St. Prosper of Aquitaine. The contest was maintained by both parties, their letters being published in the Journal des Savants, in 1689. Toward the close of the same year Anthelmi vindicated his position by the publication at Paris of his work De veris operibus SS. Patrum Leonis et Prosperi. The opposition between Anthelmi and Quesnel burst cut anew in regard to the authorship of the Athanasian Creed. Quesnel thought it the work of Vigilius, Bishop of Thapsus, in Africa, who towards the end of the fifth century was driven from his see by Huneric, King of the Vandals, and taking refuge in Constantinople wrote against the Arians, Eutychians, and Nestorians, attributing his own works to Augustine of Hippo and Athanasius. Anthelmi, on the contrary, inclined to the view of Pithou, who attributed it to Vincent of L√©rins; and in 1693 he published his Nova de symbolo Athanasiano disquisitio. In this work Anthelmi sought to prove that the Creed cannot be the production of Athanasius, as it was composed not earlier than the fifth century; and that its author was a Gaul. St. Vincent was known to have had the intention of filling out at length a confession of faith in the mysteries of the Trinity and the Incarnation; this, taken in conjunction with the similarity of style and expression between the Athanasian Creed and the writings of St. Vincent, is the foundation of Anthelmi's argument. Family His brother Charles, Bishop of Grasse, collected and published several other historical papers, the most notable of which was a pamphlet, The Life and Death of St. Martin of Tours.

He was shot when their paths crossed on a road as the Indonesians withdrew from the territory. Early life Thoenes was born in Enschede, the Netherlands, the youngest of three brothers. He was educated at Gymnasium St. Jacobus college in Enschede (1981-1987) and studied English literature and modern Russian history at Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts, USA (1987-1992). During his time at Hampshire college Thoenes learned to speak and write Russian fluently. Career After studying for his journalism career at the Centre for Investigative Reporting in San Francisco he moved to Moscow in August, 1992. Here Thoenes worked for the English language paper Moscow Times. He went on to write for the Dutch weekly Vrij Nederland and served as correspondent for U.S. News and World Report where he reported from Chechnya in 1995. In 1996 he relocated to Almaty, Kazakhstan and covered Central Asia, including Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Afghanistan for the Financial Times. In September, 1997 he moved to Jakarta, Indonesia, still working as a correspondent for the Financial Times. There he reported the Asian Financial Crisis and the fall of President Suharto. Death On September 21, 1999, Thoenes was killed by soldiers from a company of the Indonesian Army's Battalion 745 as the unit withdrew from the territory, carrying out a deliberate, government-directed, scorched-earth policy as it went. These murders were just one in a string of similar incidents that marked the passage of the unit westward along the coast-road toward the Indonesian border. Thoenes was riding pillion on a local motorcycle taxi in the neighborhood of Becora, just east of Dili, when he encountered the column of motor-cyclists and heavy lorries as it approached Dili from the opposite direction. Australian-led UN peace-keepers discovered Thoenes‚Äô body with gunshot-wounds in the back-yard of a house on a side-road. It was concluded Thoenes had been moved off the road to delay his being found and that he had also been shot at close range, with deliberation. Florindo Araujo, Thoenes' motorcycle taxi driver, told reporters that he was stopped by at least six men wearing gray Indonesian police uniforms at a roadblock while en route to Becora. Araujo and Thoenes sought to flee. Araujo managed to reach cover in the bush nearby and hide. He witnessed the execution of the injured Thoenes at the road-side. Two Indonesian army officers, Lt. Camilo dos Santos and Maj. Jacob Djoko Sarosa, were later blamed for his murder by a UN special investigator. Thoenes' death marked the first time a foreign reporter was killed in East Timor since 1975. In 2000, he received a posthumous press freedom award from the Washington D.C.-based National Press Club (NPC). The incident was the subject of a documentary, broadcast in October 2013, by fellow Dutch journalist Step Vaessen. On 21 September 1999, Stephanie was reporting from central Dili, together with her husband Andries, for Nederlandse Omroep Stichting. She still works in the region, now as the Djakarta correspondent for international broadcaster Al Jazeera English. The film was part of the Al Jazeera Correspondent series and featured an interview by the veteran South-East Asia journalist Jon Swain, who narrowly avoided the same fate later that day, nearby on the same road. Vaessen interviewed General Wiranto, the overall Indonesian military commander at the time and former Presidential candidate, and BJ Habibie the President of Indonesia in 1999. The General suggested that the military had to obey government policy, whilst the President suggested he had no personal responsibility for the military's actions. The international community tends to indict only those who are already disowned. Legacy The Financial Times set up the Sander Thoenes Prize in his honour. The award offers recent journalism graduates, each year, a three-month internship at the Financial Times headquarters in London and a scholarship to cover living expenses. The Jakarta Foreign Correspondents Club (JFCC) announced a scholarship fund in his honor on September 7, 2006. The annual JFCC scholarship is awarded to support the training of East Timorese journalists. Hampshire College, Thoenes' alma mater in Amherst MA. has the SANDER THOENES DIVISION II AND DIVISION III RESEARCH AWARD. Awards are made from an endowment established by his friends from Hampshire and around the world. The award is given to Division III students working in journalism; documentary photography, film or video; international relations; globalization; peace-building; civil society and human rights.

(23 August 1637 ‚Äì 2 November 1700) was Bishop of Ely, one of the seven bishops who petitioned against the Declaration of Indulgence and one of the nine bishops who refused to take the oath of allegiance to William III. Family and education Turner was the eldest son of Thomas Turner, the Dean of Canterbury, by Margaret (died 25 July 1692, aged 84), daughter of Sir Francis Windebank. He was born on 23 August 1637, probably in Southwark or Reading. Thomas Turner (1645‚Äì1714), the president of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, was his younger brother. Francis married (1676) Anna Horton, who pre- deceased him. From Winchester College, where he was elected scholar in 1651, Francis proceeded to New College, Oxford, where he was admitted probationer fellow on 7 November 1655, and graduated B. A. on 14 April 1659 and M. A. on 14 January 1663. Ecclesiastical and academic preferment Turner's preferments were mainly due to the favour of the Duke of York, to whom he was chaplain. On 30 December 1664 he was instituted to the rectory of Therfield, in Hertfordshire, succeeding John Barwick. On 17 February 1664-5 he was incorporated at Cambridge, and on 8 May 1666 he was admitted fellow commoner in St John's College, Cambridge, to which the patronage of Peter Gunning, the Regius Professor of Divinity, attracted him. He compounded BD and D.D. at Oxford on 6 July 1669. On 7 December 1669 he was collated to the prebend of Sneating in St Paul's Cathedral. On 11 April 1670 he succeeded Gunning as Master of St John's, Cambridge; he was vice-chancellor in 1678, and resigned his mastership, \\"because of a faction,\\" at Christmas 1679. In 1683 he became rector of Great Haseley, Oxfordshire, and on 20 July of that year he was installed Dean of Windsor. He was consecrated Bishop of Rochester, at Lambeth on 11 November 1683, holding his deanery in commendam, with the office of Lord High Almoner. On 16 July 1684 he was translated to Ely (confirmed 23 August) in succession to Gunning, who had made him one of his literary executors. He preached the sermon at James II's coronation (23 April 1685); in the following July he prepared James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth for his execution. Religious and political controversy Turner's obligations to James did not prevent him from joining in the petitionary protest (18 May 1688) of the seven bishops against the king's declaration for liberty of conscience. He also declined the oath of allegiance to William and Mary, and hence incurred suspension on 1 August 1689; his diocese was administered by a commission consisting of Henry Compton, Bishop of London, and William Lloyd, Bishop of St Asaph; on 1 February 1690 he was deposed. He was in correspondence with James; two unsigned letters to James and his queen, dated 31 December 1690, and seized on the arrest of John Aston, are certainly his. He professes to write \\"in behalf of my elder brother, and the rest of my nearest relations, as well as for myself\\" (meaning William Sancroft and the other nonjuring bishops). A proclamation for his arrest was issued on 5 February 1691, but he kept out of the way. On 24 February 1693 he joined the nonjuring bishops, William Lloyd and Thomas White, in consecrating George Hickes and Thomas Wagstaffe as suffragans of Thetford and Ipswich, the object being to continue a succession in the Jacobite interest. Henry Hyde, 2nd Earl of Clarendon, was present at the ceremony, which took place at White's lodging. In 1694 it was proposed that Turner, who was in easy circumstances, should be invited to St Germains in attendance on James, a proposal which James approved but did not carry out. In December 1696 Turner was arrested, as the nonjuror Samuel Grascome was sought, but then discharged (15 December) on condition of leaving the country. On 26 December he was rearrested. With John Somers, Baron Somers arguing for him, he survived. Death and posterity No more is heard of Turner till his death, which occurred in London on 2 November 1700. He was buried on 5 November in the chancel at Therfield. His intestacy gave all his effects to his daughter Margaret (died 25 December 1724), wife of Richard Gulston of Wyddial Hall, Hertfordshire, thus disappointing the expectation of bequests to St John's College, of which he had already been a benefactor.

The station is owned by Saga Communications and licensed to Saga Communications of New England, LLC. It airs an adult album alternative music format. History On July 11, 1977, Ed Skutnik filed an application on behalf of his Company, Green Valley Broadcasting Co., Ltd. for a construction permit to build a new FM station in Greenfield, Massachusetts. It was designated for hearing by the FCC when a competing application was filed by Poet's Seat Broadcasting, Inc. for the same vacant FM channel (95.3 MHz in Greenfield). After comparative hearings at the FCC, the FCC Administrative Law Judge decided in August 1979 that Green Valley Broadcasting Co. should be awarded the construction permit. Poet's Seat appealed the decision to a three- member FCC judicial panel. They upheld the original decision to award the construction permit to Green Valley Broadcasting Co. Poet's Seat appealed once more to the seven FCC commissioners, who voted 7-0 in Green Valley's favor. This gave Green Valley Broadcasting Co. the authority to begin construction starting in January 1981. WRSI officially went on the air July 26, 1981 at noon with a very diverse programming line up which included music from the genres of rock, classical, jazz, new age, folk, world, country and anything new and different it could find. A concerted effort was made from the start to showcase local musicians from an area in western Massachusetts that supported its local artists through concert attendance and strong listener loyalty. WRSI was the first stereo FM station in Franklin County, Massachusetts, and was unique among its peers in that it used next to no compression of its audio signals. This translated into less \\"listener fatigue\\" and longer audience participation. WRSI was also the first station in western Massachusetts beginning, in the end of 1982, to use compact discs as part of its regular programming source in order to broadcast the highest quality audio. WRSI added a sister station in March 1987. WPOE (AM) Greenfield, Massachusetts was purchased from Poet's Seat Broadcasting Inc. The call letters were changed to WGAM (AM). Green Valley Broadcasting Co., Ltd. (Ed Skutnik, owner) sold WRSI and WGAM to Howard Communications Corp. in October 1988 for $1.535 million. Howard Communications went into receivership in January 1992. At that time, Ed Skutnik, former owner of WRSI and WGAM, was asked to manage the stations until a new owner was found. In November 1992, under the ownership of Ed Skutnik, Radio Skutnik Inc. bought back WRSI and WGAM from the receivership of Howard Communication Corp. Radio Skutnik Inc. (RSI) continued the same original programming diversity which it was known for and which it started when it first signed on. In October 1996, Radio Skutnik Inc. sold WRSI and WGAM to Watertown Radio Associates. In October 1996, Dynacom (Jeff Shapiro, owner), acting as Watertown Radio Associates of Claremont, New Hampshire, reached an agreement to purchase WRSI (95.3 FM) and WGAM (now WIZZ) from Radio Skutnik, Inc. (Ed Skutnik, owner) for a reported sale price of $650,000. In August 1999, Vox Media Corp. purchased Dynacom and all of its radio assets, including WRSI, for a reported $5.5 million. In July 2000, Vox Media Corp. (Bruce G. Danziger, president) purchased WPVQ (93.9 FM) from Cardwell Broadcasting Inc., Whately (Glen W. Cardinal, president) for a reported sale price of $2.925 million. In February 2001, WRSI swapped frequencies with WPVQ so that WPVQ now broadcasts on 95.3 MHz from Greenfield, Massachusetts, and WRSI broadcasts on its current 93.9 MHz. The 93.9 FM station was assigned the WRSI call letters by the Federal Communications Commission on February 1, 2001. In December 2003, Saga Communications Inc. (Edward K. Christian, president/CEO) announced that it had reached an agreement to purchase WRSI (93.9 FM) and WPVQ (95.3 FM) plus WRSY (101.5 FM) from Vox Media Corp. (Jeff Shapiro, COO). The deal was brokered by Richard A. Foreman of Richard A. Foreman Associates Inc. The $7 million deal closed in April 2004. Alumni Rachel Maddow, host of The Rachel Maddow Show on MSNBC and a former Air America Radio personality, worked for WRSI as host of \\"The Big Breakfast\\" after getting her start in radio at nearby WRNX.

Although this initiative failed, it was followed by greater immigration from 1900 to the beginning of World War II, although it never reached the levels of Japanese immigration to countries like the United States, Brazil or Peru. Immigration halted during World War II and many Japanese nationals and even some naturalized Mexicans citizens of Japanese origin were forced to relocate from communities in Baja California, Sinaloa and Chiapas to Mexico City and other areas in the interior until the war was over. After the war, immigration began again, mostly due to Japanese companies investing in Mexico and sending over skilled employees. Currently, there are an estimated 30,000 people who are Japanese or of Japanese descent in Mexico including a recent migration of young Japanese artists into the country who have found more opportunity there than in their home country. It is the fourth largest Japanese community in Latin America. Beginning Japanese were among the Asian slaves who were shipped from the Spanish Philippines in the Manila-Acapulco galleons to Acapulco. These slaves were all called \\"Chino\\", which meant Chinese. In reality, they were of diverse origins, including Japanese, Koreans, Malays, Filipinos, Javanese, Timorese and people from Bengal, India, Ceylon, Makassar, Tidore, Terenate and China. Filipinos made up most of their population. The people in this community of diverse Asians in Mexico was called \\"los indios chinos\\" by the Spanish. Most of these slaves were male and were obtained from Portuguese slave traders who obtained them from Portuguese colonial possessions and outposts of the Estado da India, which included parts of India, Bengal, Malacca, Indonesia, Nagasaki in Japan, and Macau. Spain received some of these Chino slaves from Mexico, where owning a Chino slave showed high status. Records of three Japanese slaves dating from the 16th century, named Gaspar Fernandes, Miguel and Ventura who ended up in Mexico showed that they were purchased by Portuguese slave traders in Japan, brought to Manila from where they were shipped to Mexico by their owner Perez. Some of these Asian slaves were also brought to Lima in Peru, where there was a small community of Asians made out of Chinese, Japanese, Filipinos, Malays, and others. Enomoto Takeaki, founder of the Japanese colony in Chiapas The history of modern Japanese migration begins near the end of the 19th century. In 1868, Japanese isolation from the world was broken which prompted large scale social and economic upheaval, with the Japanese government encouraging emigration . These emigrants included those from Okinawa, who fled oppression by the Japanese government after the island was taken over in 1878. Mexico was the first country to recognize Japanese sovereignty after the end of its isolation, signing a treaty with it in 1888 to allow citizens of both countries the ability to travel to the other and establishing consulates. Mexico was the first Latin American country to receive Japanese immigrants in 1897, with the first thirty five arriving to Chiapas under the auspices of Viscount Enomoto Takeaki, with the permission of Mexican president Porfirio D√≠az . These first Japanese communities mostly consisted of farm workers and other laborers. Japanese authorities were interested in creating a coffee plantation in Chiapas, for export to Japan. They established the Sociedad Colonizadora Jap√≥n-M√©xico to recruit Japanese farmers to migrate with government support to obtain land. Others went without government assistance and were called ‚Äúfree emigrants‚Äù able to buy land without obligation to the Japanese government. However, economic conditions in Chiapas forced many immigrants to abandon their contracts with the Japanese government and, under the leadership of Terui Ryojiro, instead formed a new organization called the Sociedad Cooperativa Nichiboku Kyodo Gaisha which allowed them to diversify their economic activities. The very first settlement was based on coffee production but failed for various reasons including the fact that not all of the colonists were farmers and many became sick with tropical diseases. Many from this colony dispersed but there remains a small Japanese community in Acacoyagua, Chiapas . However, its establishment marks the first Japanese immigration to Latin America. 1900 to World War II Most of the immigration to Mexico occurred from 1900 to the beginning of World War II. Many of the immigrants in the first half of the 20th century were skilled laborers or illegal immigrants. Mexico Japan relations were superficial in the latter 19th to mid 20th century but immigrants to Mexico had favorable treatment, as Mexico needed additional workers for modernization efforts. Japanese immigrant workers at the mine of Cananea, Sonora in the 1910s. In the first decade of the 20th century, a large number of Japanese immigrants came as workers contracted to companies doing business in the country which needed skilled labor. This was first in the mining and sugar cane industries and later in construction and railroads. The main Japanese companies involved in this were Kumamoto, Toyo and Tairiku Shokumin Kaisha which did business in mining and agriculture. The three companies sent a total of 530 people to Mexico between 1904 and 1907. However, many of the immigrants could not do the hard labor of the mines and sugar cane fields, prompting them to abandon their contracts, heading to California or even Cuba . During this time period, the number of people of Japanese background went down in Mexico. In 1908, Japan and Mexico informally agreed to end immigration by contract, but ‚Äúfree‚Äù immigrants continued to come. From 1914 to 1938, another 291 people immigrated to Mexico from Japan. Legal skilled laborers after 1917 often worked in the health fields, along with those Japanese invited by the Japanese community in Mexico. Most of these were in Baja California where the economic development was greatest. A number of other Japanese came to the country illegally from the United States, after being rejected by this country, coming to Mexico hoping to enter the U.S. again. These were mostly concentrated in the north of Mexico and those who could not re-enter the United States stayed in Mexico permanently. Significant Japanese immigration into the Ensenada, Baja California area took place between 1920 and 1940 with only two known Japanese residents before that. Ensenada, Rosarito and Mexicali attracted Japanese immigrants, legal and illegal. The number of Japanese by 1940 was about 300, most of whom worked in farming and fishing. Japanese fishing enterprises included the capture of lobster and mollusks. A significant portion of Japanese agricultural production was exported to the United States and even led to a Japanese-owned chili pepper dehydration facility for the same purpose. Before WWII, the highest concentrations of Japanese and Japanese descent were in Baja California, followed by Mexico City and Sonora. Most worked in fishing and agriculture followed by non-professional workers, commerce, professionals and technicians. Up until the war, the treatment of Japanese in the country and their descendants had been favorable, very different than the treatment of Chinese in the country, which suffered discrimination and even expulsion in the early 20th century. The Japanese were relatively free from discrimination in Mexico, unlike the United States, Brazil and other countries in the Americas. One reason for this is that the Japanese population was not as prominent as the Chinese one in numbers and the work that they did, which included the construction of factories, bridges and other infrastructure was viewed favorably. The Japanese were not considered to be foreign exploiters, rather partners in Mexico's development because of their technical skills in fields such as medicine and engineering. In Chiapas where the earliest Japanese immigration occurred in the prior century, intermarriage was common, breaking down ethnic barriers. This has led to the end of a distinct Japanese population in the state, leaving only family names as a reminder. The official census of 1940s counts only 1,550 Japanese nationals in the country, the overwhelming majority men, although other studies put the number higher, as many as over 6,000. Even with the 6,000 figure, it pales against the number of Japanese in other countries in the Americas at the time such as the United States (285,000), Brazil (205,000), Canada (22,000) and Peru (18,000) . Kingo Nonaka was a combat medic during the Mexican Revolution and later a documentary photographer of Tijuana. Nonaka along with other Japanese living in the Northwest were forced to move to the center of the country during WWII. Japanese immigration halted by World War II to near zero, and those who were in the country were faced with restrictions and relocation after Mexico broke diplomatic ties with Japan in 1941. Japanese national and even those with naturalized Mexican citizenship were forced to move from areas along the Pacific coast such as Baja California, Sinaloa and Chiapas inland, with some forced into exile to Japan. The goal was to keep the Japanese in Mexico away from ports and from Mexico's border with the United States so that they could not be used as a ‚Äúfifth column‚Äù by the Japanese government. Japanese nationals were forced to move to interior cities such as Puebla, Guadalajara and Cuernavaca. Most went to Mexico City and Guadalajara but there were concentrations in Guanajuato and Quer√©taro. It is estimated that about 1,100 people moved to Mexico City and Guadalajara alone. The Japanese community worked to buy properties to house the displaced including the former Temixco Hacienda near Cuernavaca which allowed the Japanese there to grow crops and live semi-independently. The fear of Japanese-Mexicans faded during the war, with some allowed to go back home before 1945 and the rest after. Mexico was one of a number of countries to take this action, but in the end only about 3,500 people were affected as opposed to 120,000 in the United States. With some exceptions, those forcibly relocated were allowed to return after the war and retake possession of their property. However, in a number of cases, this proved impossible as people created new lives in the central states and/or they lost farming land and/or water rights to the unscrupulous. Those most able to return to their old life were the fishermen of the Ensenada area. This treatment of the Japanese is not in most accounts of Mexican history and is not taught in schools. One consequence of the war was that it caused many Japan-born to remain in Mexico, even if they had plans to one day return to Japan. The main reason for this was that the war completely destroyed the old Japan, and what they knew no longer existed. After the war, there was a strong division among the Japanese-Mexican community as to whether Japan had really lost the war, (with about ten percent refusing to believe Japan could lose). However, the division was enough to keep the Japanese- Mexicans from seeking restitution from the Mexican government or promote the memory of the displacement. Post war to 1978 Luis Nishizawa Mexican artist. After the end of the war, Japanese immigration to Mexico began again. From 1951 to 1978, this immigration was associated with Japan's economic growth, giving it money to invest abroad. From the 1950s to the present, over three hundred Japanese enterprises have established themselves in Mexico and Japan is Mexico's third largest trading partner. These companies brought highly skilled workers into the country, usually on two-year renewable visas. Since Japanese immigration began, it was a small and dispersed phenomenon, with few to no formal policies or support to Japanese immigrants. Shortly before the war, many Japanese in Mexico began to form associations called ‚Äúnijonjinkai‚Äù (Japanese associations) or ‚Äúkenjinkai‚Äù (associations of people from the same prefecture). However, before the war, there was no nationwide Japanese immigrant organization similar to those in the United States. The closest organization to this function was the ‚Äúkyoeikai‚Äù which arose in response to the displacement of Japanese during WWII, especially in Mexico City. Later, the leaders of these organizations would form the Asociaci√≥n M√©xico Japonesa, which remains today. Mexicans of Japanese descent and current immigration Work by Japanese artist Shino Watabe. Japanese artist Fumiko Nakashima with two of her works at the Garros Galer√≠a in Mexico City In 1997, descendants of Japanese immigrants celebrated a century of Japanese immigration into Mexico, with an estimated 30,000 people of Japanese nationality or ethnicity living in Mexico. Despite the immigration starting in the latter 19th century, it never reached the numbers it did in other countries such as the United States and Brazil. Japanese immigrant influence is strongest in Baja California, and can be seen in both the last names of many of its residents and the operators of maquiladoras near the U.S. border. There are still scattered communities of Japanese descendants from the first half of the 20th century in other areas. In addition to the Asociaci√≥n M√©xico Japonesa, there are some regional Japanese associations such as the Asociaci√≥n Japonesa del Sur de Veracruz established in 1996. There has been little research into this ethnic group in Mexico. The main researcher is Mar√≠a Elena Ota Mishima who has written various works on the topic, including the book Siete Migraciones Japoneses en M√©xico 1890-1978. Ayako Hamada There has been one notable influx of Japanese into Mexico since 1978, which is young artists from Japan who have settled mostly in Mexico City. They have come because they have found it easier to develop their careers in Mexico, as the art market in Japan is very small and very hard to break into. More people in Mexico visit museums than in Japan and the range of artistic styles is much less restricted in Mexico. In 2011, the Museo Universitario del Chopo held an exhibition called Selva de cristal: artistas japoneses en M√©xico to promote the work of artists of Japanese and Japanese descent in Mexico. Artists represented included Luis Nishizawa, Kiyoshi Takahasi, Carlos Nakatani, Kyuichi Yahai and Kiyoto Ota . Notable Japanese and Japanese-Mexicans include theater promoter Seki Sano, painters Tamiji and Tawaja and Luis Nishizawa. Tanetoshi Kirawawa founded one of the most successful Japanese businesses in Mexico, and is also known for his philanthropic work such as the publication of books and magazines about Japan including Jap√≥nica and the creation of institutions such as Liceo Mexicano-Japon√©s, with teaches both Japanese and Mexican children, as well as the Japan study program of the Colegio de la Frontera Norte. As a result of Japanese investment in automotive and associated industries, there has been a significant influx of Japanese immigrants to the Baj√≠o region. The largest increase has been in Guanajuato, which has seen a 400% increase in Japanese residents since 2013. The opening of Honda and Toyota plants in Celaya and a Mazda plant in Salamanca greatly increased the Japanese presence. As a result, branches of Japanese banks as well as the first Japanese consulate-general in Mexico have opened in Le√≥n.

Early life Talagi was born in Alofi and was educated at Tufukia School in Niue and Nelson College in New Zealand.Talagi 2019, p 3 He studied at Massey University in Palmerston North, where he completed a Bachelor of Agricultural Science. While there, he was elected president of the Pacific Island Students Association and organised protests against nuclear testing and racial discrimination.Talagi 2019, p 7 He married his wife, and they had their first child.Talagi 2019, pp 7, 8 On returning to Niue he worked as a livestock development officer.Talagi 2019, p 9 In 1977 he became a member of the Alofi south Village Council.Talagi 2019, p 22 He later became president of the Niue Public Service Association,Talagi 2019, p 11 and from 1981 to 1984 he was Niue's first Consul General in Auckland.Talagi 2019, p 12-13 On his return to Niue he was appointed Director for Niue's Economic Affairs Office, and was responsible for major infrastructure development.Talagi 2019, pp 14‚Äì16 After leaving the public service he became an airline and shipping agent.Talagi 2019, p 20 In 1992, he received a heart transplant, and spent the next several years living in New Zealand.Talagi 2019, pp 58‚Äì60 In 1998 he became president of the Niue Rugby Football Union.Talagi 2019, p 48 Political career Talagi ran unsuccessfully for a common roll seat in the 1996 Niuean general election.Talagi 2019, p 22 He was elected to the Niue Assembly in the 1999 election and was immediately appointed an associate Minister with responsibility for economic development and civil aviation in the Cabinet of Sani Lakatani. In October 1999 he resigned his Ministerial position over Lakatani's plans to establish an airline, and submitted a motion of no confidence against him. He spent the remainder of the term as a member of the opposition. Following the 2002 election he was appointed Minister of Finance and Tourism in the Cabinet of Young Vivian. In July of that year he was relieved of the Tourism portfolio in a Cabinet reshuffle. He was later appointed Deputy Prime Minister. As Finance Minister he was responsible for managing the recovery from Cyclone Heta and was the subject of public criticism over the distribution of aid and allocation of new houses. As a result, he narrowly missed out on a common roll seat at the 2005 election, falling two votes behind Maihetoe Hekau in provisional results. The final result showed an exact tie, and Talagi was declared elected after his name was drawn from a hat. He was subsequently dropped from Cabinet. Premier Talagi with his eventual successor Dalton Tagelagi in May 2010 Talagi was re-elected at the 2008 election, topping the common roll in what was seen as a vote for change. He was elected Premier on 19 June 2008, defeating Young Vivian by fourteen votes to five, with one abstaining. As Premier, he introduced a new consumption tax to balance the budget, established diplomatic relations with China, and attempted to negotiate with New Zealand for greater control of aid funding. When those negotiations were unsuccessful, he used the threat of seeking Chinese assistance to leverage a better deal. A major driver of his policies was to develop Niue and gain greater economic independence from New Zealand.Talagi 2019, pp 45‚Äì47 Talagi in 2011 In August 2008 Talagi became chair of the Pacific Islands Forum. At the 2008 Forum meeting in Niue he used the position to focus on climate change and the need for new elections in Fiji following the 2006 Fijian coup d'√©tat. The latter led to a diplomatic dispute with Fiji, calls for the Forum to split, and in May 2009, the suspension of Fiji from the Forum. At the next forum meeting in 2009 Talagi suggested that Fijians should take responsibility for their destiny and rise up against the military regime. In May 2009, Talagi co-chaired the 5th Pacific Alliance Leaders Meeting (PALM) with then Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso in Hokkaido. Talagi was re-elected at the 2011 election and re-elected as Premier. In his second term Talagi reformed the tax system and began free-trade negotiations with China. He continued to push for stronger international action on climate change and announced an ambition for Niue to become 100% solar powered. In November 2011 Niue became a founding member of the Polynesian Leaders Group, a regional grouping intended to cooperate on a variety of issues including culture and language, education, responses to climate change, and trade and investment. In 2013 he won a significant shift from the New Zealand government on superannuation portability, allowing Niueans to collect New Zealand superannuation in Niue. In early 2014 a proposal by Talagi to house asylum seekers for Australia as part of its Pacific Solution was rejected by the Niuean Assembly. He was again re-elected Premier after the 2014 election. In his third term Niue planned to privatise its health system and celebrated 40 years of self-government. Talagi's foreign policy continued to focus on climate change, and he began a push for membership in the United Nations. In 2015 he became the first Niuean leader to meet the Queen. In 2016 he was medevaced to New Zealand twice for medical treatment. In 2017 he announced he would seek a fourth term as Premier, saying that he had \\"unfinished business\\" to attend to. He was re-elected at the 2017 election and again elected Premier. In 2017 he again had an extended stay in Auckland for medical treatment, and as a result missed the budget vote. His fourth term also saw disputes with New Zealand over pension portability and the government accounts. In 2019 he spent several more months in Auckland recovering from illness, and on his return his brother Billy Talagi continued as acting Premier. The term was capped off by Niue losing control of its internet domain, and a damning audit report into the government's finances. Despite these setbacks, Talagi announced he would seek a fifth term as Premier in the 2020 election. He kept a low profile during the campaign, and failed to win a seat. He was replaced as Premier by Dalton Tagelagi. Death On 9 July 2020, Talagi was again medevaced to New Zealand for treatment of a long-term illness. He died at the Niue Foou Hospital in Alofi on 15 July 2020, shortly after returning to Niue. After his death, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said that Talagi would be \\"remembered for his lifelong commitment to safeguarding Niue‚Äôs future security and prosperity\\". Talagi was given a state funeral at the Alofi Ekalesia church on 28 July 2020. Recognition In the 2017 New Year Honours, Talagi was appointed Knight Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit (KNZM). He received his knighthood from New Zealand Governor General Patsy Reddy in March 2017, who flew to Niue for the ceremony. New Zealand Post marked the occasion with a commemorative stamp issue. In November 2019 Talagi released an autobiography, Niue Rising.

Such pottery originated from several ancient civilizations of Peru, the most famous of these being the Moche and Chimu cultures. Arrival of the Spanish and banning of homosexuality Once the Spanish arrived, in the 16th century, they were astonished at the sexual practices of the natives. Viceroy Francisco de Toledo and the priests were aghast to discover that homosexuality was accepted and that the indigenous population also did not prohibit premarital sex or hold female chastity to be of any particular importance. Historian Maximo Terrazos describes how the Spanish reconciled this native sexuality with the Catholic faith: However, homosexuality in Peru was decriminalised in 1837. Ceramics Over a span of 800 years, pre-Columbian central Andean cultures, especially the Moche, created at least tens of thousands of ceramics (Spanish: huacos). A few such ceramics show skeletons undeniably engaged in homosexuality; four depict gay male anal intercourse, one depicts lesbian penetration with the clitoris. Many others show partners where at least one member is of indeterminate sex, like the oral sex ceramic shown above, where the genitalia of the person on their knees is not visible. Such works, due perhaps to bias, have often been interpreted as depicting a heterosexual couple. =Destruction= Many of the ceramics, along with most indigenous icons, were smashed. In the 1570s, Toledo and his clerical advisers organized to eliminate sodomy, masturbation and a common social practice which roughly translated from the native Quechua means \\"trial marriage\\". As Terrazos describes, \\"You couldn't talk about them because they were considered [pornographic].\\" They were prohibited due to \\"taboo imposed by the Christian religion that men have sex only for procreation and that women do not experience sexual pleasure.\\" =Survival= In spite of this organized effort to destroy these artifacts, many have survived to the present day. For decades, the erotic ceramics were locked away from the public, accessible only to an elite group of Peruvian social scientists. Occasionally and reluctantly they were made available to select foreign researchers from the United States and Europe. The Larco Museum in Lima, Peru is well known for its gallery of pre-Columbian erotic pottery.

It was founded in 1949 by Igor Markevitch but its permanent structure dates back to 1970, when Gilles Lefebvre consolidated the world‚Äôs first youth orchestra. During this period the orchestra had the residence in Canada, from 1988 to 2004 it moved to Berlin and actually its headquarters is in Spain with the support of Valencian region.  A look in the recent past  The Jeunesses Musicales World Orchestra has had its headquarters in Valencia, Spain since 2005, when maestro Josep Vicent became its Artistic Director and Principal Conductor. It is composed of 100 musicians from 40 countries and it has toured in China, The Netherlands, Spain, Austria, Cyprus and Germany. In Summer 2008 it travelled to Canada where maestro Franz Paul Decker conducted. The World Orchestra started this new period in Valencia showing its artistic project to China to mark the 60th anniversary of the signing of peace between China and Japan. The Netherlands and Austria were next. The orchestra came back in the Winter of 2007 to the Kurhaus (Scheveningen), the place where The World Orchestra was born. It has played in Cyprus and Germany (its previous administrative home) in the Winter of 2007 to perform in the Berlin Philharmonie. The World Orchestra has made performances in Spain. Apart from symphonic concerts in numerous concert halls as El Palau de les Arts Reina Sof√≠a in Valencia, Palau de la M√∫sica of Valencia, Teatro Monumental of Madrid or GREC Festival of Barcelona, the orchestra ran a Chamber Music festival, with concerts for String Quartet, Brass ensemble and Percussion Group. JMWO was also the resident orchestra of Nits de la Mediterr√†nia Music festival and also was in charge of the music of the Opera ‚ÄòPuss in Boots‚Äô (a co-production with Teatro Real of Madrid and Teatre Liceu of Barcelona). Some of JMWO musicians took part in the filming of new movie on Valencian composer Martin y Soler. One concert was for the finals of the 32nd America‚Äôs Cup Competition. The World Orchestra joined forces with Orquesta de Valencia with almost 150 musicians on stage. Its concerts have been broadcast live in numerous TV programs and Radio stations and have been recorded for RTVE, RTVV, RNE, and the EBO. During its tour in China the Valencian TV-RTVV made a documentary film called Sound for Peace.  Repertoire  The extensive repertoire of The World Orchestra under the baton of Josep Vicent includes pieces by Tchaikovsky, Markevitch, Bart√≥k, Ginastera, Turina, Adams, Mossolov, Prokofiev, Rimsky-Korsakov, Dvo≈ô√°k, Ravel, Beethoven, Piazzolla, Ibert, Zheng Lu & Ma Hongye, Sibelius, Gershwin, Bernstein, Stravinsky, Mozart, Mart√≠n y Soler, Falla, Stylianou and Xavier Montsalvatge.

UNESCO Artist for Peace  As UNESCO Artist for Peace its concerts are committed to peace, interculturality and cooperation between cultures. During the two first seasons held in Valencia The World Orchestra visited China to commemorate the Chinese-Japanese Peace Treaty. Besides numerous concerts for peace in Kurhaus (The Hague), The World Orchestra reinforced its engagement with peace travelling to Cyprus to play concerts for war refugees of the armed conflict between Israel and the Lebanon and performing in Barcelona‚Äôs GREC Festival as a homage to those who lived the tragedy of the Spanish Civil War. History  The World Orchestra came into being with the creation of a young orchestra for the Jeunesses Musicales International project. In the period 1949 to 1969, in the Netherlands, the violinist Arthur Grumiaux, Director of the Igor Markevitch Orchestra and other key musicians resolved, as part of the Jeunesses Musicales assemblies, to put together an international orchestra inspired in the vision of Sir Robert Mayer, creator of the orchestral concerts for children in the 1920s. It was in Canada in 1968 that Gilles Lefebvre proposed the transformation of this ‚Äòorchestral conference‚Äô into an ensemble that would develop under the wand of an experienced conductor. Lefebvre envisaged that such an ensemble would receive and continue the education of the best young musicians of the Jeunesses Musicales member countries. Right from its inception, this project in music education was noted for its rigour and professional quality. These standards have persisted to the present day and it has attained world recognition. Success has come quickly due to the high artistic quality; furthermore, the World Orchestra has become a symbol, through excellence in music, of solidarity and co-operation between the nations of the world. In 1986, the orchestra established its headquarters in Berlin and offered concerts in the name of peace on both sides of the infamous wall that divided the city. Since then, the World Orchestra has been registered as a harmonious association of musicians without frontiers. As recognition of its peace-building efforts, in 1996 the UNESCO granted it the distinction of ‚ÄòArtist for Peace‚Äô with which it has travelled the world over. During the 1960s and 1970s, WOJM went on several tours to Canada, Denmark, Belgium, Italy, the U.K., Japan, the U.S. and Switzerland under such outstanding masters as Zubin Mehta, Leonard Bernstein, Michael Tilson Thomas and Serge Baudo. In the 1980s, Walter Weller, Hiroyuki Iwaki, Eduardo Mata, Jeffrey Tate, Vernon Handley, Charles Dutoit and Michel Tabachnik among many others directed the orchestra. That period saw the orchestra travelling to Germany, Hungary, France, Spain, the U.S., Canada, Japan, South Korea, Poland, Austria, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Uruguay and Argentina. In the 1990s, the World Orchestra was to be seen in Germany, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Russia, Estonia, Sweden, Latvia, Finland, Norway, The Netherlands, Poland, Spain, France, the Philippines, Malaysia, South Korea, Switzerland, and Israel. In those years the baton was held by Kurt Masur, Franz-Paul Decker, Antonio Pappano, En Shao, Yuri Temirkanov and Kent Nagano and well known soloists as Bobby McFerrin or Yehudi Menuhin joined the orchestra. With the status of Artist for Peace, the World Orchestra performed to commemorate the 50th anniversary of State of Israel (1998), the 350th anniversary of the Peace of Westphalia (1998), and in the commemorative events marking the beginning of the Second World War in Warsaw (1999). In the year 2000, it toured south- eastern Europe (Slovenia, Croatia, former Yugoslavia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Macedonia).

History Japanese immigration was not permitted by the Paraguayan government until the 20th century. The first Latin American country that Japanese people settled was Brazil. But when Brazil decided to halt Japanese immigration in the 1930s, a Japanese land company built an agricultural settlement southeast of Asunci√≥n. Two more colonies near Encarnaci√≥n followed in the 1950s; many Japanese settlers came from neighboring Bolivia. During World War II, many Japanese Paraguayans were accused, alongside German Paraguayans and Italian Paraguayans. Until the end of World War II, many Japanese refugees arrived. The Japanese and Paraguayan governments made a bilateral agreement in 1959 to continue Japanese settlement in Paraguay. Although most ethnic minorities chose urban life, Japanese remained in agriculture- there were 8,000 Japanese settlers in rural colonies in the 1980s. The remaining Japanese settlers who are living in urban areas number 2,321. In spite of the long period of Japanese settlement in the country, there was a strong stigma against Japanese Paraguayan intermarriage, but a number of Japanese Paraguayans are Eurasians of Spanish and Japanese descent or of other European (mostly German or Italian) and Japanese descent. Language By the late 1960s to present, Japanese Paraguayans speak Japanese, Spanish and Guaran√≠. The earliest settlement supported a parallel educational system with subjects taught entirely in Japanese; the colonists eventually limited this to supplemental Japanese language classes. Religion First-generation Japanese Paraguayans were generally followers of Shinto and Buddhism. The first Japanese settlers at La Colmena brought a piece of stone from the Ise Shrine which was gazetted as a monument mark the settlement's founding. Japanese religious festivals were celebrated within the first few decades among the first and second-generation Japanese settlers and in the late 1960s, a majority identified themselves with the Buddhist and Shinto faiths. Conversion to Roman Catholic Christianity increased from the late 1970s onwards.Masterson/Funada-Classen (2004), p. 103 Education There is a Japanese international school in Asunci√≥n: the Colegio Japon√©s en Asunci√≥n („Ç¢„Çπ„É≥„Ç∑„Ç™„É≥Êó•Êú¨‰∫∫Â≠¶Ê†° Asunshion Nihonjin Gakk≈ç)Home page .

George Edward Cokayne Complete Baronetage Volume 1 1900 Biography Foljambe came from a well established Derbyshire family whose residence was at Walton Hall, Chesterfield in Derbyshire. His father was Francis Foljambe, Esq. of Aldwarke. The family were Lords of the Manor of Tideswell from the fourteenth century, and also had estates at Bakewell and Darley Dale. One of his earliest recorded ancestors was Godfrey de Foljambe, Lord Chief Justice of Ireland (died 1376), whose elaborate tomb can still be seen in All Saints Church, Bakewell. Mosley, ed. Burke's Peerage 107th Edition Delaware 2003 Vol. 2 p. 2368 Sir Francis was created a baronet on 24 July 1622 by James I. He was known for reducing the family estates by his over-indulgence and extravagance. The family chronicler Dr Nathaniel Johnston said that he \\"was a person of great generousness, but of so profuse a temper, and hospitality to excess, that what by reason of the great jointure of the three... ladies, and the contentions about the estate and the less regarding of his interest by reason of his having no issue male, he sold Walton and most of his Derbyshire lands, and much of his Yorkshire lands, and entangled others, that reduced that estate which was so great... to ¬£1000 per annum.\\" rotherhamweb He became High Sheriff of Derbyshire in 1633, but he had to sell the family residence in the same year. He died at Bath on 17 December 1640. What was left of his estates was passed on to Peter Foljambe of Steveton (1599-1669), a distant cousin.

The station, located from Oslo West Station, was served by Oslo Commuter Rail trains of the Norwegian State Railways. Ramstad opened on 1 November 1931 with two simple side platforms. It was opened as Marstrander bro, but took the name Myra eighteen days later. Ticket sales remained until 1964. The station was one of several closed on 3 July 1973 as part of a service upgrade to speed up local trains on the Drammen Line. History The pathway down to the former station, not entirely overgrown. The neighborhood of Stabekk did not receive a station on the Drammen Line when it opened on 7 October 1872, originally being designated to use Lysaker Station. Private dwellings grew up in the Stabekk area starting in the 1860s and by the 1880s it had grown sufficiently substantial that it could support a train station, resulting in Stabekk Station opening on 29 May 1884. From the 1930s a series of bus routes were established from the area and to attract people to take the train, NSB introduced three new stations on the Drammen Line between Sandvika and Lysaker, all which opened on 1 November 1931. In addition to Ramstad, this consisted of Ramstad Station and Strand Station. The station was originally opened as Marstrander bro, named for the bridge over the railways. From 1932 to 26 January 1964 the station had a private ticket sales office. With the opening of the Lier√•sen Tunnel, a new route scheme was introduced on the Drammen Line. New and faster Class 69 trains were put into service. To take advantage of this NSB also chose to close three of the stations on the line between Sandvika and Lysaker: Ramstad, Strand and Myra. This allowed the local train from Sandvika to Oslo to reduce travel time by ten minutes. The station was only located from Stabekk and from Lysaker. Trains no longer stopped at Myra from 3 July 1973, although the station was not officially closed until August 1978. Facilities Ramstad Station was situated from Oslo West Station, equivalent to from Oslo Central Station. It was located at an elevation of above mean sea level in the residential neighborhood of Stabekk. The station featured two side platforms along a section of double track and electrified line. The station was served every thirty minutes by the Oslo Commuter Rail service between Sandvika and Oslo West Station. Located nearby are also a tennis court and a bandy field, as well as the schools Lysaker Primary and Stabekk Upper Secondary.

Penguin Books published it in 1968 with reprints in 1972 and 1974. Each story in the collection, whose title refers to people burnt by society, has a reference to burning actually and in metaphor. Seven of the stories are set in Australia and four are set in Greece or concern Greek migrants. The suburb of Sarsaparilla, the setting for several stories, is like Our Town of Thornton Wilder, but with White's \\"beadily disapproving gaze\\".Australian Attitudes, Charles Osborne, 1964 In White's first collection of a series of three, The Burnt Ones are haunted by feelings of isolation, intense self-examination, and an acute awareness of how they are different from others. The stories follow the theme of loneliness as do the second collection titled The Cockatoos, and Three Uneasy Pieces, his third and last collection. Title The title comes from the Greek turn of phrase meaning, \\"the poor unfortunates\\" (ŒøŒπ Œ∫Œ±œÖŒºŒµŒΩŒøŒπ [hoi kaumenoi]), the burnt ones.Patrick White, The Burnt Ones, Penguin (Australia), 1974 (before acknowledgements). White plays on the literal meaning of the title by introducing the motif of burning in most of the stories through sun burn, fire, war, anger, burn-out or hurt to characterise his \\"elect\\", those burnt by society and by existence. The book is dedicated to the late author and historian Geoffrey Dutton and his wife, Nin. The fourth story, \\"Clay\\" is also for fellow Australians, satirist Barry Humphries and actress Zoe Caldwell (p 114).

After staying with friends on an island for the summer, she returns home feeling somehow changed. She marries her father's old friend, Hessell Mortlock ‚Äì moving away to live in his family home where he subtly morphs from a confident businessman, revealing his stingy, mean-spirited ways and that he was married several times before. Like the heat-blasted roses that stand throughout the house, domestic life with Mortlock petrifies. Eventually Anthea leaves him, returning home on the death of her father. By chance her husband dies in a car accident before changing his will against her and on her inheritance she travels the world, never quite finding what she is looking for. =Willy-Wagtails by Moonlight= \\"Wagtails\\" is the visit by Jum and Eileen Wheeler to their bird-watching friends Arch and Nora Mackenzie. Preparing to be bored, they meet Arch's secretary Mildred Cullen, as she leaves by taxi, which they consider a luxury. The after-dinner entertainment for the evening is the bird-watching couple's latest recordings of lyre birds and bell birds. When the tape fails the hostess hurriedly replaces it with one of willy wagtails while she attends to other things. Jum and Eileen are left alone in the lounge room with the recording which starts with the birds, but includes the unwitting sounds of lovemaking in the bush until they hear the voices of the host and his secretary, making them uncomfortable witnesses to a secret affair. When Nora returns to the room for the last bird calls, they realise it was she who made the recording though she doesn't say so outright. Nora carries on as if nothing has happened while insisting Arch listens to the whole tape with her, another time. =A Glass of Tea= Caught up in storytelling in a mouldering summer house, the middle-aged Greek, Malliakas visits an old friend's contact and octogenarian, Philippides in Cologny, in Geneva, Switzerland. Over tea, he hears the Greek-centred love story of Yanko and his jealous Constantia, of prophecy and Russian glassware, precious for a reason. A vague, oblique story, it keeps him wrapt while they wait for the wife to return. =Clay= Clay Skerritt is a sensitive boy living with his widowed mother who on a whim, named him after pottery. The kids bash him up because of his unusual name and because he is \\"different\\". His unimaginative mother fearing his unconventional nature, has his head shorn to emphasise his maleness, causing the kids to bash him for that as well. Growing up, he meets Marj with the voice as flat \\"as the colour of masonite\\" ( p122) who like his mother, also lacks understanding ‚Äì except that later, she has intuited the need to erase links with his mother. After his mother dies they marry stalely, while slowly Clay begins to change for the worse, shocking in his eccentricity. =The Evening at Sissy Kamara's= The story opens with Mrs Pantzopoulos at the dentist. Greeks Poppy and Basil Pantzopoulos plan to have dinner at the house of her friend Sissy. Intellectual Sissy Kamara writes unpublished poetry, encourages artists and lives with her husband Sotos Louloudis of mysterious means. The couples have little in common except that Poppy and Sissy escaped from Smyrna in the war, becoming refugees with their bonds of shared memory. =A Cheery Soul= This is the story of change for people overtaken by the goodness of elderly Miss Docker. Ted Custance and his wife take her in as a boarder. From charitable beginnings, life with the outspoken Miss Docker becomes even more strained until Mrs Custance arranges for her to move to a home, freeing them to become closer than before in the joint knowledge she would be unbearable to the inmates. Leaving a trail of well-intentioned exposures and unwelcome remarks, Miss Docker goes on to assail the local minister in the final scene. =Being Kind to Titina= Dionysios tells this story in the first person while living with his large well-educated family from Alexandria when the \\"inferior\\" Stavrides family moves in across the street in Schutz. Everyone tells Dionysios to be kind to the daughter, awkward unlovely Titina who becomes the butt of the children's tortures and scorn. Within a few years, the two children meet again as teenagers in reversed roles ‚Äì Titina, rich, beautiful, charming and based in Paris, is instead generous to Dionysios. After she returns to Paris he finds out her profession. =Miss Slattery and her Demon Lover= It is Australia 1961 and Miss Slattery, a door to door market researcher for Better Sales Pty Ltd, calls on Tibor Szabor, a Hungarian, whose home is paved with black and white real marble tiles, has a harbour \\"View\\", and a mirror ceiling over the mink covered bed. She needs him more than he needs her until the bohemian party where she shows her talent with a whip that drives him crazy. But Miss Dimity Slattery is no stranger to change. =The Letters= \\"Letters\\" is a descent into madness. Mrs Ursula Polkinghorn writes to a close family friend on second best paper, engraved with \\"Wishfort, Sarsaparila, N.S.W.\\" Even while she tries to maintain the status quo ante, her main concern is her fragile son Charles who is having a birthday. At first a promising boy, Charles was called back to the family firm where he soon had a breakdown. The letters of the story are unopened mail he protects himself from by stacking it away in a box. Following his withdrawal from involvement with the world, he maintained distance until now, turning 50, he decides to open the letters along with his frightening paranoia. =The Woman who wasn't Allowed to Keep Cats= Americans, Spiro Hajistavros and his wife Maro are calling on the Alexious family in Athens. They start a fight on the way there along a sunburnt street, over her friendship with Kikitsa and Aleko. The fight is along class lines, the friends being impoverished intellectuals and they, wealthy New York restaurateurs. As they climb the baking streets, their wealthy American life falls away until they arrive ‚Äì a couple of Greeks after all ‚Äì in Kikitsa's cat-infested apartment. The story continues with the couples circling each other warily in different encounters, until one day, Maro visits Kikitsa by herself. This time, the Alexioi have moved up in the world, Aleko now a successful writer, Kikitsa is thin again, and there is a ban on cats in their lives. Due to the ban, Kikitsa takes up her own sensuality, a girlfriend fling is revisited and the Alexioi find an inspired passion for each other. =Down at the Dump= Wal and Mum Whalley are in the \\"bits and pieces trade\\" (scrap dealers) ‚Äì Wal works the dumps. They are planning a day out at Sarsaparilla dump to avoid a funeral in the street. The Town Councillor's wife, Mrs Hogben prepares to bury her sister Daise Morrow and her daughter Meg is on leave from school for the funeral. The dump is beside the cemetery, a vantage point for the writer to explore the thoughts of men who knew Daise gathering at the grave, and the family at the dump stirring each other abusively. Daise seems to embody the only person accepting of both sides of the tracks, until a tender truce is played out between Meg and the dumpers' son, Lummy that suggests life will always slip from the controls of social standing. Critical reception White's short stories are noted for their multiplicity of symbols, myths, and allegories, as were his longer works of fiction. Critic Hameeda Hossain says, \\"In describing the pathos of a slow crumbling of suburban souls, his stories evoke a sense of tragedy... of a whole way of life.\\" Scholar William Walsh describes his dense poetic imagery as penetrating beyond material appearances to \\"mysterious actuality\\". In his 1976 essay, Ingmar Bj√∂rkst√©n states that the short story is \\"not Patrick White's best medium of expression\\" during his discussion of The Burnt Ones.

The two main antagonists were John Early and Samual Hasley. Background The Early and Hasley families seemingly had no problems prior to the outbreak of the Civil War. However, while most of the Hasley men were off at war fighting with the Confederate forces, John Early served in the Texas Home Guard, which had been formed to protect the home-front while younger men were away fighting. By most accounts, Early abused this power, often using his authority to take advantage of people. One of those he abused was an old man named Drew Hasley, the father of Samual. Escalation When Hasley's son, Samual, returned home after the end of the war, he became enraged after hearing of the abuse his father had suffered. To make matters worse, Early had begun to ally himself with the Reconstruction forces, which were then occupying Texas. When the younger Hasley made it known he was looking for Early, the latter went into hiding. When it was necessary for him to venture out, Early would constantly stay in the company of the soldiers he'd befriended. The feud was relatively low in violence, with opposing parties mostly stealing from one another. The Early and Hasley factions were, however, involved in several shootouts, resulting in two deaths. The first victim of the feud was outlaw and Hasley supporter, Jim McRae, who was killed in mid-1869. The other victim was an Early supporter, Dr. Calvin Clark, who was pursued into Arkansas and killed by Hasley later that same year. Following the killing of Dr. Clark, the feud fizzled out. Hasley continued living in the area, and became involved in numerous outlaw acts in defiance of the occupying Reconstructionist forces. In the fall of 1889, while in Belton, town Deputy Marshal William \\"Cap\\" Light confronted Hasley over a disturbance Hasley was causing while drunk. Light ordered him to go home and sober up. Instead, Hasley mounted a horse, and rode it up on the sidewalk. Light attempted to arrest him, and Hasley pulled his pistol. Light shot Hasley, killing him.

It served as a station for the Oslo Commuter Rail between 31 May 1959 and its closing on 23 May 1993. The station, situated from Oslo Central Station, consisted of two side platforms. Demands for a station were first articulated in the 1930s. During construction there arose a disagreement regarding the name, with the local residents' association preferring Jongsbru. In 1988 the railway proposed merging Jong with the old Slependen Station, with a new Slependen Station be built between the two. History The Drammen Line past the site of H√∏vik Station opened as a narrow gauge railway on 7 October 1872. The area of Jong was at first served by Sandvika Station and from 1873 also by Slependen Station. The need for a station serving Jong was first articulated during the early 1930s by the manager of Fru Hjorts Pleiehjem, who served 300 patients and 60 employees at the nursing home. The residents' association for Jong√•sen joined in on the effort through a letter to the Norwegian State Railways (NSB) in April 1935. They argued that some passengers taking the bus would switch to the train. They met with NSB' director the following year, without success. NSB responded that this would increase travel time for the trains, that it would be difficult to stop because of the hill and that it would be difficult to fit into the schedule. The plans were revitalized during the 1950s. The naming of the station caused controversy, with the residents' association wanting the station to be called Jongsbru and NSB wanting it to be called Jong. The decision fell on the latter. Jong Station opened on 31 May 1959. Jong was located on the inner part of the Drammen Line and was served every half-hour by the Oslo Commuter Rail. In 1988 NSB proposed merging the old Slependen Station and the station at Jong and replacing it with a new station in between. Both stations were in need of modernization. Among other issues, they were both shorter than the norm of platforms, and they were both situated in curves hindering sight lines. The merger would also make the line run faster. The new station was estimated to cost NOK 8.4 million. The new station was opened and Jong Station closed on 23 May 1993. The new station was located from Jong Station. Facilities Jong Station was located on the Drammen Line, from Oslo West Station and from Oslo Central Station. The line past the station featured double track and was equipped with two side platforms. It was situated in a mostly residential area. Jong Station was from the old Slependen Station and from Sandvika Station.

The pre-processed instructions are used to generate instruction and data stream prefetches by detecting cache misses before they would otherwise occur by using the idle execution resources to calculate instruction and data stream fetch addresses using the available information that is independent of the cache miss. The principal hardware cost is a means of checkpointing the register file state and preventing pre-processed stores from modifying memory. This checkpointing can be accomplished using very little hardware since all results computed during runahead are discarded after the cache miss has been serviced, at which time normal execution resumes using the checkpointed register file state. Branch outcomes computed during runahead mode can be saved into a shift register, which can be used as a highly accurate branch predictor when normal operation resumes. Runahead was initially investigated in the context of an in-order microprocessor, however this technique has been extended for use with out of order microprocessors. Entering runahead When a runahead processor detects a level one instruction or data cache miss it records the instruction address of the faulting access and enters runahead mode. A demand fetch for the missing instruction or data cache line is generated if necessary. The processor checkpoints the register file by one of several mechanisms discussed later. The state of the memory hierarchy is checkpointed by disabling stores. Store instructions are allowed to compute addresses and check for a hit, but they are not allowed to write to memory. Because the value returned from a cache miss cannot be known ahead of time, it is possible for pre-processed instructions to be dependent upon invalid data. These are denoted by adding an \\"invalid\\" or INV bit to every register in the register file. If runahead was initiated by a load instruction, the load's destination register is marked INV. Pre-processing instructions The processor then continues to execute instructions after the miss, however all results are strictly temporary and are only used to attempt to generate additional load, store, and instruction cache misses, which are turned into prefetches. The designer can opt to allow runahead to skip over instructions that are not present in the instruction cache with the understanding that the quality of any prefetches generated will be reduced since the effect of the missing instructions is unknown. Registers that are the target of an instruction that has one or more source registers marked INV are marked INV. This allows the processor to know which register values can be (reasonably) trusted during runahead mode. Branch instructions that cannot be resolved due to INV sources are simply assumed to have had their direction predicted correctly. Branch outcomes are saved in a shift register for later use as highly accurate predictions during normal operation. Note that it is not possible to perfectly track INV register values during runahead mode. This is not required since runahead is only used to optimize performance and all results computed during runahead mode are discarded. In fact, it is impossible to perfectly track invalid register values if runahead was initiated by an instruction cache miss, an instruction cache miss occurred during runahead, a load is dependent upon a store with an INV address (assumes that hardware is present to allow store to load forwarding during runahead), or if a branch outcome during runahead is dependent upon an INV register. Leaving runahead The register file state is restored from the checkpoint and the processor is redirected to the original faulting fetch address when the fetch that initiated runahead mode has been serviced. Register file checkpoint options The most obvious method of checkpointing the register file (RF) is to simply perform a flash copy to a shadow register file, or backup register file (BRF) when the processor enters runahead mode, then perform a flash copy from the BRF to the RF when normal operation resumes. There are simpler options available. One way to eliminate the flash copy operations is to write to both the BRF and RF during normal operation, read from only the RF during normal operation, and read/write only the BRF during runahead mode. An even more aggressive approach is to eliminate the BRF and rely upon the forwarding paths to provide modified values during runahead mode. Checkpointing is accomplished by disabling register file writes. Modified values during runahead mode can only be provided by the forwarding paths.

The necessary financial endowment is provided by the ‚ÄúFriends of the BAI‚Äù (e.V.).  Scientific aims Since 1999 four main objectives of research are being pursued. These comprehend: * Excavation projects (especially in the Eastern Mediterranean) * The application of modern methods in Archaeology - i.e. Geophysics (geoelectrics and tomography; geomagnetics; georadar) and terrestrial research (Photogrammetry) * Archaeometry (chemical and mineralogical pottery analysis; experimental firing of pottery); the main interest is to write a history of pottery production in the investigation area; since 2008 also research work on ancient glass and faience industry * Experimental archaeology (Production of pottery replicas in historically correct manufacturing methods)  Main archaeological projects Different projects = The Biblical Archaeological Institute has conducted excavations and geophysical research in Italy, Greece, Israel and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. * Villa Hadriana (Italy) 2002‚Äì2004 * Geophysical prospection in Olympia (Greece) 2001 * Esch-Schallaf (Jordan) 1998‚Äì1999 * Ba'ja I, close to Petra (Jordan) 1999 * Sal (Jordan) 1999‚Äì2000 = The Gadara Region Project and the Tall Zira'a = Since 2001 the institute's research focuses on the exploration of the Gadara region. The largest site in the area is the Tall Zira'a which comprises over 5000 years of settlement history. At this place in 2001 a survey was conducted. In 2003 started the first excavation of a long term project which is scheduled until 2020. Since 2004 the German Protestant Institute of Archaeology Amman is a partner of the project. Since 2006 the corresponding institute in Jerusalem participates likewise. The currently running excavation seasons are accomplished by a regional survey covering the greater Wadi al-'Arab area since 2009. On the Tall Zira'a settlements from over more than five millennia are being excavated. Furthermore, the agricultural potential as well as flora and fauna, geology, hydrology, trade relations (roads, infrastructure) and the strategically importance of the Wadi al-Arab are being explored. 25 km2 of the greater Wadi al-'Arab area (south of the ancient city of Gadara) were under research since 2009. In this area exist more than 100 sites which date from prehistory to the Islamic period. With the help of archaeometrical methods the artefacts from the Tall Zira'a are being examined concerning their respective materials. Thereby, the research concentrates on pottery, glass and faience to gain insight into the possible location of production sites and the technological knowledge. The research described above goes hand in hand with experimental archaeology, applying old techniques e. g. of constructing a potters oven and firing the products. The geophysical prospection of the Tall Zira'a used geoelectrical mapping, two- dimensional tomography and three-dimensional tomographical techniques to * plan archaeological excavations in advance as exact as possible and devise appropriate methods of excavation, * acquire knowledge concerning unexcavated areas and * protect areas for future excavations.

Disposition of the weapons found in the Arsenal is somewhat sketchy, but from various records it can be surmised that the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th Arkansas Infantry Regiments, mustered in June, 1861, were issued M1816/M1822 .69 caliber flintlocks. They retained these weapons until April, 1862 when they were able to exchange them for better weapons scavenged from the battlefield at Shiloh.Ezell, Tom, \\"Re: Van Dorn- Army of the Southwest\\", Arkansas in the Civil War Message Board, Posted 17 December 2001, Accessed 11 June 2012, http://history-sites.com/cgi- bin/bbs53x/arcwmb/arch_config.pl?read=545 Battles The regiment moved with the rest of General Hardee's division to Bowling Green, Kentucky, where Hardee's Division became the Army of Central Kentucky.United States.

After the losses of Fort Henry and Fort Donelson in February 1862, Confederate General Albert Sidney Johnston withdrew his forces into western Tennessee, northern Mississippi, and Alabama to reorganize. and then retreated through western Tennessee to northern Mississippi. In the reorganization of forces, the 5th Arkansas was assigned to Hindman's (later Liddell's) brigade, Army of Mississippi in March, 1862. At the time the Battle at Shiloh took place, the 5th Arkansas was on picket duty along the Memphis & Charleston Railroad, about 7 miles north and west of Corinth. Colonel David C. Cross pleaded with Gen. Albert Sidney Johnston to permit the 5th Arkansas to take part in the movement towards Shiloh, but Johnston replied that \\"the post of duty was the post of honor,\\" and kept the 5th Arkansas on picket duty.Yeary, Mamie. Reminiscences of the Boys in Gray 1861-1865 [1912] In early May 1862, Confederate forces underwent an army-wide reorganization due to the passage of the Conscription Act by the Confederate Congress in April 1862. All twelve-month regiments had to re-muster and enlist for two additional years or the duration of the war; a new election of officers was ordered; and men who were exempted from service by age or other reasons under the Conscription Act were allowed to take a discharge and go home. Officers who did not choose to stand for re-election were also offered a discharge.United States. War Dept.

The reorganization was accomplished among all the Arkansas regiments in and around Corinth, Mississippi, following the Battle of Shiloh. When Corinth was evacuated on the approach of Halleck and Grant in May 1862, the regiment fell back with the Confederate army to Tupelo Mississippi, where it was reorganized. Captain L. P. Featherston was elected colonel, J. E. Murray, Lieutenant Colonel, and Captain Peter Green, major; J. J. Winston was appointed adjutant.Confederate Military History, vol. XIV, p. 290 When General Braxton Bragg led the Army of Mississippi on the Kentucky Campaign, the 5th Arkansas became engaged in the Battle of Perryville. While in Kentucky, John Edward Murray was made Lieutenant Colonel, upon the resignation of Lieutenant Colonel Sweeney. The regiment was assigned to General Liddell's and Govan's Brigade, and consolidated with the 13th Arkansas from August 1863 to April 9, 1865. The regiment was organized with 722 officers and men and lost forty-two percent of the 336 at the Battle of Murfreesboro. The 5th/13th lost forty-five percent of the 450 engaged at the Battle of Chickamauga. Colonel L. Featherston was also killed during on the first day of battle and was succeeded by Colonel Murray. The unit had 21 men disabled at the Battle of Ringgold Gap. Colonel John E. Murray, was killed in action on July 22, 1864, during the Atlanta Campaign. Colonel Peter V. Green succeeded Colonel Murray and remained in command until the close of the war. The consolidated 5th/13th totaled 321 men and 222 arms in December 1863, and reported 112 casualties at the Battle of Atlanta. The regiment and the rest of Govan's Brigade participated in General John B. Hood's disastrous Franklin-Nashville Campaign. Due to the appalling losses suffered by Govan's Brigade during the Atlanta Campaign, the 1st/15th, 5th/13th and 2nd/24th Arkansas Regiments were consolidated into one regiment, which was commanded by Colonel Peter Green of the 5th/13th (specifically of the 5th). The other officers of the consolidated regiment were Major Alexander T. Meek, of the 2nd/24th Arkansas, Captain Mordecai P. Garrett and Sergeant Major Thomas Benton Moncrief of the 15th Arkansas. The consolidated regiment fought under the colors of the consolidated 5th/13th Arkansas Regiment, because this was one of the only colors not captured when Govan's Brigade was overrun at the Battle of Jonesboro.

It is likely that 5th Arkansas had a First National pattern regimental flag when it entered service, but after being transferred to the Army of Central Kentucky at Bowling Green in late 1861, they would have been issued the first of the Buckner/Hardee pattern battle flags, blue field with a white circle in the center and possibly the unit's name in the circle.Dedmondt, Glenn, The Flags of Civil War Arkansas, Pelican Publishing Company, Gretna, 2009, Page 140., Accessed 17 May 2012, https://books.google.com/books?id=KCAxwqU1oAEC&q;=5th+#v=snippet&q;=5th&f;=false The regiment was assigned to St. John Lidell's Brigade, part of Major General Patrick Cleburne‚Äôs Division, which fought the entire war under Hardee Pattern battle flags. There are two existing flags of this type for the 5th Arkansas; one is currently in the collection of the Texas Civil War Museum in Fort Worth Texas and the second is in private hands.

The flag-staff for this flag is also in private hands and it is stenciled; \\"5th & 6th Arkansas - B. Newman\\". The curator of the Carter House in Franklin, Tom Carter, says it was mistakenly labeled, and should have been the \\"5th & 13th\\", which were consolidated at the time of the battle. The 6th Arkansas by that time was consolidated with the 7th Arkansas. Research shows the flag at that time was a \\"white moon on a blue field\\". The 5th/13th Arkansas flag was one of five captured by the 88th Illinois at the Battle of Franklin, and none were forwarded to the War Department. It was last seen at Nashville when the 88th Illinois displayed the captured flags to General Thomas. The division commander stated, \\"They were afterward sent home by those who captured them. Since then they have been ordered to be returned, and will be forwarded to department headquarters as soon as they arrive.\\" However, none were ever returned.Howerton, Bryan R. \\"Re: Captured Regimental Flags\\" Arkansas in the Civil War Message Board, Posted 11 January 2009, Accessed 19 February 2012 Consolidation and Surrender The remnants of ten depleted Arkansas regiments, along with one mostly-Arkansas regiment, in the Army of Tennessee were consolidated into a single regiment at Smithfield, North Carolina, on April 9, 1865.

It is one of the few investigated polymorphisms of its gene. C267T is a synonymous polymorphism. As of 2008 meta-analysis of the polymorphism and Alzheimer's disease indicates that there probably is no association between the two, though individual studies report such an association, e.g., a Chinese study found an association with late-onset Alzheimer's disease. Another reported association in neuropsychiatry disorders is with treatment response in depression.

It was one of the few bomber groups that operated throughout the war. In 1933 Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party came to power in Germany. To meet the expansionist aims of their F√ºhrer, the German state began an enormous rearmament programme to build the Wehrmacht (German armed forces). 76 was created in May 1939 as the Luftwaffe sought to reorganise and increase its strength. The wing was permitted three Grupen (Groups) in May 1939, but only two were operational by August. The Dornier Do 17 light bomber equipped the wing's units. In September 1939 German and Soviet forces invaded Poland, beginning World War II. 76 served in the campaign until the 17 September 1939 and then proceeded to spend the Phoney War resting and re-equipping. All three groups began the offensive in Western Europe (Fall Gelb) on 10 May 1940. 76 supported the German Army (Heer) in the Battle of Belgium and Battle of France. In July 1940 76 served in the Battle of Britain and The Blitz until May 1941. During the course of these operations it converted to the Junkers Ju 88. From June 1941 76 supported Army Group North in Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union. It remained on the Eastern Front until December 1942 and never returned. From December 1942 to January 1944 it operated exclusively the Mediterranean and Middle East theatre, mainly in the Maritime interdiction role. It participated in the Battle of Tunisia, in the final phase of the North African Campaign (November 1942‚ÄîMay 1943) and also in the Italian Campaign, from July 1943 until May 1944. Some of its staffeln converted to the Messerschmitt Me 410 and Junkers Ju 188 in the spring, 1944. Some of KG 76s Gruppen saw service on the Western Front in the night intruder role because of Allied air superiority. It formed part of the bomber force for Operation Steinbock and contested the D-Day landings in the summer, 1944. It was withdrawn from the Battle of Normandy after heavy losses. 76 continued to operate over the Low Countries and supported the Ardennes Offensive in the Aerial reconnaissance and close air support role. Significantly, KG 76 made use of the first-ever operational jet bomber design, the Arado Ar 234. 76 remained operating on the West Front until May 1945, one of the few bomber units to do so. The last remaining groups either withdrew to Norway on 3 May 1945 or surrendered to the British Army in northern Germany on 8 May 1945. Background The first steps towards the Luftwaffes formation were undertaken just months after Adolf Hitler came to power. Hermann G√∂ring became National Kommissar for aviation with former Deutsche Luft Hansa director Erhard Milch as his deputy. In April 1933 the Reichsluftfahrtministerium (RLM‚ÄîReich Air Ministry) was established. On 25 March 1933 the Deutschen Luftsportverband (DVLA) (German Air Sport Association) absorbed all private and national organisations. The merging of all military aviation organisations in the RLM took place on 15 May 1933, which became the Luftwaffes official day of foundation. The Nationalsozialistisches Fliegerkorps (NSFK‚ÄîNational Socialist Flyers Corps) was formed in 1937 to give pre-military flying training to male youths, and to engage adult sport aviators in the Nazi movement. Military age members of the NSFK were drafted to the Luftwaffe. As all such prior NSFK members were also Nazi Party members, this gave the new Luftwaffe a strong Nazi ideological base in contrast to the other branches (Heer and Kriegsmarine) of the Wehrmacht. With this base of organisation, the Luftwaffe began an enormous expansion program lasting six years to 1939. In 1938, during the preparations for Operation Gr√ºn (Green), the proposed invasion of Czechoslovakia, both Hitler and G√∂ring discovered the Luftwaffe was more \\"shadow than substance\\". The German air arm possessed only 2,928 aircraft in total while the aviation industry's production target was 1,179 per month. Munitions and aircraft armament production could only cover 50 percent of current operational requirements. Fuel reserves allowed for only four weeks of aerial operations. There also shortages of spares and technical units, although bomber groups received three while other types of aircraft units were given only one. By January 1939 there were 269 first-line Staffeln (Squadrons). Only 90 (33 percent) were bomber squadrons. A further six would be added by 1 July. Among these formations was KG 76. Hitler's expansionist aims required a larger air force and the annexations, or unopposed invasions, of Austria and Czechoslovakia allowed the industry to exploit the new territories and expand the size of the aircraft industry to a small degree. In manpower terms it received substantial reinforcement. A late concerted effort‚Äîof which KG 76 was part‚Äîwas ordered and this expansion and designation produced a frontline strength of 4,093 aircraft of which 1,176 were bombers. =Formation= Kampfgeschwader 76 (KG 76) was formed on 1 May 1939 at Wiener Neustadt in Austria with Stab./KG 76 and I Gruppe. The new bomber formation was formed from KG 158 stab (command) unit. The Geschwader was placed under the command of Luftflotte 4 (Air Fleet). Oberst Paul Schultheiss was appointed the first Geschwaderkommodore (Wing Commander) of KG 76. The stab and I Gruppe trained throughout the summer on the Dornier Do 17E. Oberst Stefan Fr√∂hlich was given command and became the group's first Gruppenkommandeur (Group Commander). Near the end of August 1939 both formations converted to flying the Do 17Z. II. Gruppe was not formed until 1 January 1940 at Wels where it was placed under the command of Major Walter Hill. It trained its bomber crews on the Do 17Z and was also placed under the command of Luftflotte 4. The original order for formation occurred on 19 September 1939, after the war had begun, but it was repeatedly delayed. III. Gruppe was also formed on 1 May and became operational at Rosenborn, southwest of Breslau, on 26 August 1939. Oberst Werner Zech became the first group commander. KG 76 operated the Dornier Do 17 light bomber at the outbreak of World War II. Photographical evidence from the period confirms that the wing did operate the Heinkel He 111 medium bomber. 1 Staffel operated the He 111 in the Mediterranean region. KG 76 partially converted to the Junkers Ju 88 in 1940. In August 1939 76 began mobilisation for war. Stab./KG 76 was brought to combat readiness at Breslau- Sch√∂ngarten. I Gruppe deployed to Silesia for mobilisation on 26 August 1939. III. Gruppe readied for war at Rosenborn. By the 31 August 1939 stab KG 76 could field nine Do 17s, all of which were operational. The 36 Do 17s belonging to II. Gruppe were also combat ready. II. Gruppe had all 39 Do 17s operational. The Geschwader was assigned to the 1. Flieger-Division (1st Flying Division) which operated under the 4th Luftflotte. World War IIInvasions of Poland = On 1 September 1939 German forces began Operation Weiss, an invasion of Poland which began World War II in Europe. General-Major Bruno Loerzer, commanding the 2nd Fliegerdivision ordered attacks on Polish Air Force airfields to achieve air superiority. Cloud forced KG 76 to abandon its first missions. Throughout the first day of the invasion the wing did bomb airfields and Polish Army troop concentrations along the Vistula river. Bombing operations continued and were extended to Galicia until 21 September. I. Gruppe struck at targets in and around ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Radom, Kielce, Czƒôstochowa, Krosno and Moderowka. Luftflotte 4 flew only a small number of missions because of the fog. Half were directed at airfields: I./KG 76 were a part of the operations. Neighbouring Kampfgeschwader 4 flew 150 sorties and dropped 200 tonnes of bombs on airfields around Krakow. On 4 September KG 76 embarked upon railway interdiction operations. The purpose of these attacks was to cause congestion at Polish railheads. The Polish land forces using roads were simultaneously attacking road traffic at an altitude of 2,000 metres (6,500 feet) and above followed by 10 to 30 degree diving attacks. The bombing raids prevented the ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Army from detraining. 76 received support from KG 55 and KG 77. The dive-bombing was carried out by Junkers Ju 87 Stukas. The operational- level attacks were effective and from 5 September the shortage of new targets led to a focus on close air support. In mid-September, from the 14th, KG 76 supported the German 14th Army. 76 resumed rail interdiction missions to cut off Polish lines running into Romania and eastern Poland. 76 flew low-level sorties against rail bridges and choke points. On 16 September KG 76 was formally assigned to Hugo Sperrle's Luftflotte 3. On the night of the 16/17 September the attacks were ordered to stop. Luftflotte 4 received a teletype message alerting them to a secret clause in the Nazi-Soviet Pact which allowed for the Soviet invasion of Poland. III./KG 76 remained active in the war on Poland until 22 September. The German-Soviet campaign in Poland ended on 6 October 1939. 76 spent the winter and the following spring resting, training and re-equipping. Stab./KG 76 moved to Nidda southeast of Giessen in February 1940. II./KG 76 moved from Breslau to Wiener Neustadt on 22 September then to Leipheim in Bavaria where it was ordered to stand-by in case of an emergency and end of the Phoney War. In mid-October it relocated to Crailsheim until December. From January to April 1940 it was stationed at Merzhausen, Nordhausen and Langensalza. II./KG 76 moved to Nidda with Stab./KG 76. III. Gruppe were more active. After a brief period at Wels, it went to Baltringen southwest of Ulm in the first half of October and Schw√§bisch Hall late in the month. The group also moved to Nidda southeast of Giessen with a possible stay at Gotha. From 6‚Äì24 April 1940 it flew training exercises over Rheims-Laon. The unit did not participate in Operation Weser√ºbung but instead spent the spring training and resting in preparation for the western offensive in 1940. =Battle of France= Stab./KG 76 had one Do 17M (unserviceable) and all four serviceable Do 17Zs. I. Gruppe mustered 32 serviceable Dorniers from 36, while II. Gruppe had 34 from 25 operational. III./KG 76 had a slightly higher number with 26 from 35 Do 17s combat ready. KG 76 was assigned to the I. Fliegerkorps for Fall Gelb, the attack on France and the Low Countries. III./KG 76 moved to Bonn days after the offensive began. On 10 May 1940 the Battle of France began and KG 76 supported the offensive by attacking the airfield at Laon. Over Charleville-M√©zi√®res 7 staffel KG 76 met No. 87 Squadron RAF and Hawker Hurricanes Feldwebel Walter Reiske's aircraft crashed. The crew became prisoners of war and among the first of the wing's casualties. KG 76 bombed targets along the River Maas and in support of Army Group C along the Maginot Line. On 13 May it supported Hermann Hoth's Panzer Corps cross the Meuse at Houx and Dinant. KG 76 remained on counter-air operations and it attacked the Royal Air Force (RAF) airfield at Vitry on 18 May. 607 and 151 Squadron lost one Bristol Blenheim and 14 Hurricanes destroyed. On 17 May KG 76 bombed targets in Cambrai. On 19 May it began to support German forces in the Battle of Belgium, and struck targets in the Tournai area. II. Gruppe operated over the Flavion area on 15 May and relocated to Cologne in mid-May. On 16 May it attacked targets near Maubeuge and Charleroi in Belgium. On 17‚Äì18 May Cambrai was bombed and the group moved to Vogelsang near Aachen on 19 May. The Gruppe then proceeded to Escarmain north east of Cambrai. All three groups supported Army Group A's advance to the English Channel. 76 bombed ports at Ostend and Dunkirk from 25 May‚Äì1 June. At the beginning on Fall Rot, KG 76 has seen the strength of the wing decline after a month of air operations. On 10 May it had around 110 bombers and 89 percent serviceability. By mid-May the figures had slipped to 107 and 69 percent. On 31 May KG 76 reported 85 bombers with 58 operational (68 percent). The Geschwader took part in Operation Paula, a concentrated attack on airfields around Paris, which began on 3 June as a prelude to Fall Rot. 76 also attacked targets in the Normandy and Brittany area from 6‚Äì12 June but the results of these bombing raids are not recorded. KG 76 is known to have supported offensives in the Aumale and Amiens area on 8 June. The German units were now operating at the limit of their range. II. Gruppe moved to forward-airfields at Saint-L√©ger-des-Aub√©es. Following the French campaign, II./KG 76 was disbanded and merged into III./KG 28 on 9 July 1940. However, oddly, the Gruppe was reformed on the very same day, as it was decided to rename III./KG 28 back to II./KG 76. The unit also converted to the Ju 88 at this time. =Battle of Britain= KG 76 moved into Belgium and France following the end of the campaign in Western Europe. The German Wehrmacht began preparations for Operation Sea Lion, the proposed but risky plan to invade the United Kingdom. Throughout July and early August 1940, the Luftwaffe began a series of attacks on shipping in the English Channel, known as the Kanalkampf phase of what became known as the Battle of Britain. 76 was placed under the control of Albert Kesselring's Luftflotte 2 based in Brussels. A fourth unit, Lehrstaffel (training squadron) was added, and based at Beaumont-le-Roger. While the Geschwader prepared for the main air offensive to begin, it carried out preliminary attacks on southern England. III. Gruppe moved to Cormeilles-en-Vexin. The formation flew very few sorties in July 1940. One reason for this was the conversion and re-training of crews onto the Ju 88A-4. The first recorded loss of this type occurred over Dungeness on 29 July. II. Gruppe moved to Creil on 9 July. It joined III./KG 76 in anti- shipping operations on 29 July. On 13 August II./KG 76 reported 28 of 36 Ju 88s operational. III./KG 76 could muster only 19 from 32 Do 17s on 29 July. I. Gruppe transferred to Beauvais‚ÄìTill√© Airport and reported all 29 Do 17s operational on 13 August‚Äîthe earliest known operational readiness report. Dornier Do 17s of KG 76 dropping bombs On the night of the 25/26 July 1940, KG 76 flew via Land's End and bombed Southampton. On 29 July III./KG 76 sent Ju 88s out at low-level to evade detection by British radar. The target was a series of convoys but the bombers scored no direct or near misses. The Gruppenkommandeur, Adolf Genth, was killed when he flew into a balloon cable off Dungeness and another was lost with its crew, when it was shot down by the escort ships. Observers called for fighter assistance and 610 Squadron Supermarine Spitfires were sent but the Ju 88s were gone. Genth was replaced by Major Franz von Benda. II./KG 76 recorded the wing's first inland sortie over England when it attacked RAF Hawkinge on the coast on 11 August with unknown results. The group did not report any losses. The attack was repeated on 12 August. On this day the Luftwaffe and RAF Fighter Command clashed in large-air battles over the Channel. III Gruppe struck at dawn. The German pilots succeeded in destroying two Hangars, the station workshops and four fighter aircraft on the ground. Station Commander Squadron leader E. E. Arnold had the airfield full functional again in 24 hours. The Germans escaped without loss. On 13 August the Luftwaffe initiated its offensive against Fighter Command in earnest. Codenamed \\"Adlertag\\" (Eagle Day), the attack failed to achieve the set objective of destroying Fighter Command. RAF Kenley, RAF Debden and RAF Biggin Hill were bombed by KG 76. There are no recorded losses for KG 76 although the day ended in defeat for the Luftwaffe which lost circa 200 killed or captured including 44 killed, 23 wounded at least 45 missing. On 16 August I. and III Gruppen struck at unspecified targets in England and II. Gruppe turned back because of weather conditions, abandoning their attack on Debden. The 18 August 1940‚Äîknown as The Hardest Day‚Äîwas particularly cost for KG 76. At their airfield at Cormeilles-en-Vexin, 9 Staffel (Squadron) KG 76 were briefed by their commander Hauptmann (Captain) Joachim Roth. The Staffel was to conduct a low-level attack against Kenley with Roth flying as a navigator in the lead aircraft. The nine Do 17s were to head across the Channel and make landfall at Beachy Head. From there they were to follow the Brighton-London rail line north-east to the target area. The crews were ordered to concentrate their attacks against buildings and hangars on the southern end of the airfield. The Dorniers were to carry twenty 110-lb bombs each fitted with a fuse that would allow for function if released from 50 feet or higher; the type of bomb previously used by the Staffel had to release from twice this height, making the unit's Do 17s correspondingly more vulnerable to ground fire. The attack was to be part of a coordinated pincer movement against the airfields. Ju 88s from II./KG 76 were to dive-bomb buildings and hangars from high-altitude first. Five minutes later, 27 Do 17s from I. and II./KG 76 would level-bomb from high altitude to crater the runways and landing grounds while knocking out its defences. 9 Staffel KG 76, the specialist low-level strike unit, would go in and finish off any buildings still standing. The operation began at 09:00 CET but was postponed because of heavy haze reducing visibility up to 4,000 feet. The form-up was more difficult for KG 76 and its Do 17s and Ju 88s. Their bases in and around Calais were covered in 8/10ths cloud cover with a base of 6,500 feet which reached to 10,000 feet. As the bombers climbed through the haze the formation soon lost cohesion. Valuable time was lost as they reformed. The Do 17s of I. and III./KG 76 had overtaken the III./KG 76 Ju 88s which should have been ahead of them by five minutes. These delay had serious consequences for 9 Staffel KG 76 for it would meet undamaged defences. The wing attacked Biggin Hill but were intercepted by 92, 615, 32 and 111 Squadron. 1 staffel lost one bomber while 2 and 3 suffered with one bomber damaged from each. 5 staffel lost one bomber destroyed and one damaged as did 8 staffel and 6 staffel lost one aircraft. The specialist low-level attack squadron 9 staffel lost two Do 17s and five damaged when it undertook and independent operation against RAF Kenley. Aircraftman D. Roberts fired parachute-and-cable launchers which caused most of the damage. Dornier Do 17s of KG 76 in flight For their efforts, 9 Staffel destroyed at least three hangars, hit several other buildings and destroyed eight Hurricanes on the ground. According to other sources, 10 hangars were destroyed, six damaged, the operations room put out of action, and many buildings were destroyed. It would have been worse had the bombs been released higher. A lot of bombs landed horizontally and did not explode on impact. To achieve this level of damage, KG 76 dropped nine tons of bombs. At the end of the day just one hangar was left operational at Kenley. The low-level raid put the airfield out of commission for two hours. In combat, two Hurricanes were shot down by the Dornier's return fire. Low-level attacks were abandoned after The Hardest Day. I./KG 76 was reduced to 19 out of 29 serviceable machines by 18 August 1940 but II. Gruppe numbers are unknown for this period. III. Gruppe reported 17 from 24 Do 17s ready for action on 24 August. 76 were in action on 23 August and reported one loss. On 24 August III./KG 76 attacked RAF North Weald and RAF Hornchurch while II./KG 76 bombed Biggin Hill. The Stab unit lost two Dorniers in action with No. 264 Squadron RAF and 4 staffel lost two and one damaged in combat with the same RAF squadron. KG 76 are known to have been in action on 25 August, for 3 staffel lost a bomber in combat with No. 32 Squadron RAF. II./KG 76 returned to Biggin Hill on 31 August. The group apparently flew with a formation of Heinkel He 111s from an unknown unit. A mixed force of Dorniers and Heinkels bombed both Biggin Hill and RAF Croydon. The He 111s appear to have bombed Biggin Hill, destroying two of the three remaining hangars, the living quarters and operations room eliminating the telephone system. II. Gruppe lost one Do 17 in combat with No. 151 Squadron RAF over the Thames Estuary. Elements of KG 76 bombed Kenley on 6 September. 6 staffel reported the only losses of the wing this day. Three Ju 88s crashed, one being badly damaged in combat with No. 41 Squadron RAF fighter ace Eric Lock. Two more were posted missing after being engaged by 111 Squadron and anti-aircraft artillery. KG 76 probably took part in the attack on London the following day which began The Blitz and marked a change in German strategy from attacking RAF airfields to bombing cities. No loss appears to have been reported on 7 September by KG 76 although 63 German aircraft suffered destruction or damage on 7 September. On 15 September 1940 KG 76 were part of an all-out attack on London that became known in the historiography of the Battle of Britain as the \\"Battle of Britain Day\\". The wing spearheaded the first major raid of the day. Major Alois Lindmayr Gruppenkommandeur of I./KG 76, led the entire formation. Lindmayr was an experienced combat veteran having won the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross for his effective low-level attacks in France. III./KG 76 took off with 19 Do 17s. At the same time, to the north, I./KG 76 took off. Usually a Gruppe could field 27 bombers. After weeks of attrition, I./KG 76 could put up only eight Do 17s. The Geschwader had to field two Gruppen to do the work of one. Most of the Dorniers were in poor shape, worn down by intensive operations. The two groups rendezvoused at Amiens then proceeded to Cap Gris Nez to pick up their Messerschmitt Bf 109 escort. Heavy losses encouraged crews to seek innovative weapons for defence. One pilot, Feldwebel Rolf Heitsch, had his Dornier fitted with an infantry flame thrower in its tail. After take-off the formation broke up in cloud and was delayed for 10 minutes to allow reforming. Two bombers failed to do and returned to base‚ÄîHeitsch was one of them. The second operation of the day was flown in the afternoon. 76 lost six bombers and another two damaged. =The Blitz= KG 76 began to scale down daylight operations in September. I./KG 76 withdrew from France to G√ºttersloh and Giebelstadt on 24 October 1940 to convert onto the Ju 88. III./KG 76 remained and carried out bombing raids on 6 October against unknown targets and on 27 October against RAF Martlesham Heath. II Gruppe bombed Channel ports on 4 October but withdrew to Ansbach and Giebelstadt for rest until January 1941 when it returned to Ch√¢teaudun. In December 1940 III./KG 76 transferred to Illesheim and given leave. From December 1940 to March 1941 it slowly converted to the Ju 88. I./KG 76 participated in the London Blitz and it bombed the city on 25 September and then Coventry on 1 November. III. Gruppe bombed London on night of the 15/16 November 1940. Hitler's Directive 23, Directions for operations against the British War Economy, published on 6 February 1941, gave aerial interdiction of British imports by sea top priority. This strategy had been recognised before the war, but the Battle of Britain had got in the way of striking at Britain's sea communications and diverted German air strength to the campaign against the RAF and its supporting structures. The German bomber fleet was equipped with Knickebein (crooked-leg) and began using X-Ger√§t and X-Ger√§t navigational aids at this time. British jamming began the Battle of the Beams which lasted through the Blitz. III. Gruppe bombed London again on 18/19 March with I Gruppe while II./KG 76 operated over the city on the night of the 17/18 February 1941. The group switched to Swansea on 20/21 February. Eight He 111s from Kampfgruppe 100 guided the attackers to the target that night. Cardiff was the target on the night of the 3/4 March 1941 for II Gruppe. On 8/9 and 9/10 March the group attacked London and bombed Portsmouth on 10/11 March. Birkenhead was bombed on 12/13 March, then it flew two missions against Glasgow and Liverpool the following night. On the 14/15 March they repeated two raids in one night over Glasgow and then bombed Sheffield. Avonmouth (16/17 March), London (19/20 March) and Plymouth 21/22 March were all carried out with the participation of II./KG 76. The group targeted Bristol on 29/30 March. III./KG 76 carried out an attack on Portland and then a long-range operation against Belfast. In April KG 76 continued bombing operations. It bombed Coventry on 8/9 April and Birmingham on 9/10 and 10/11 April. I. and III. Gruppe were used on the night of the 19/20 April 1941 to bomb London. Hermann G√∂ring to ordered the attack to celebrate Hitler's birthday. Belfast and Portland were attacked on 15/16 April, while Liverpool was bombed on 26/27 April, 3/4, 4/5 and 7/8 May. Hull, Nottingham and Sheffield were bombed on the night of 8/9 May. 76 bombed the port town of Grimsby in May 1941. KG 76 began moving to East Prussia on 7 June 1941, for Operation Barbarossa. It appears its last sortie as on 29/30 May 1941, when II Gruppe attacked shipping in the Humber Estuary. =Eastern Front= In early June 1941 76 began moving to East Prussia. It continued to serve under Fliegerkorps I which was subordinated to Luftflotte 1. Stab KG 76 had only one Ju 88 at Gerdauen. It shared the field with I. Gruppe which could muster 30 Ju 88s with 22 operational. II./KG 76 was based at J√ºrgenfelde with 30 Ju 88s (25 operational). III./KG 76 were located at Schippenbeil but had on strength 29 Ju 88s with 22 combat ready as of the 21 June 1941. The wing supported Army Group North in the opening phases of Barbarossa and the war on the Eastern Front. KG 76 supported the German advance through the Baltic states. On 22‚Äì24 June it carried out attacks against Red Air Force airfields and armoured formations in the Siauliai. Fyodor Kuznetsov, commander of the Baltic Military District, ordered counter-attacks against the German advance on 22 June. The Soviet 3rd and 12th Mechanised Corps congregated for an attack on the XXXXI Panzer Corps west of Siauliai. The Soviet armour was detected by German aerial reconnaissance. Ju 88s from Luftflotte 1, KG 76 among them, destroyed 40 tanks and lorries belonging to the 23rd Tank Division, 12th Mechanised Corps. The 12th Mechanised Corps committed the 28th Tank Division and 202nd Mechanised Division near Siauliai and a large tank-battle developed. 76, with KG 77 and KG 1 were forced to operate in the close support role because the air fleet lacked Ju 87s. 77 and 76 lost 22 Ju 88s in total, 21 were completely destroyed. A notable loss to KG 76 on this date was Hauptmann Robert von Sichart, commanding I Gruppe who was killed on 23 June. On 26 June KG 76 operated in the Zigare and Pskov area on 29 June. The three bomber wings carried out effective interdiction operations in support of Panzergruppe 4 on 2 July. On 4 July KG 76 and KG 77 flew attacks against Soviet airfields at Idritsa and Opochka to relieve pressure on the German 16th Army. On 5 July the German bomber contingent claimed 112 aircraft destroyed in the ground. The three bomber wings supported the hard-pressed 1. Panzer Division near Ostrov. For the loss of two bombers in total, KG 1, 76 and 77, 140 Soviet tanks were destroyed along with the supply lines to the town. Army Group North's advance toward Lenningrad was slowed by severe resistance. From 22 June to 13 July the three bomber wings from Fliegerlorps I had claimed 1,211 aircraft on the ground. On 13 July Army Group North reported 354 Soviet aircraft over its front necessitating repeated attacks upon airfields. By 22 July KG 76 reported it had lost 30 Ju 88s destroyed or damaged by hostile action. KG 1 and KG 77 reported 24 and 35 respectively. From mid-July KG 76 was directed at interdiction missions against the Soviet 8th Army. The Soviet field army had mounted severe resistance to German progress in the battle for Estonia. In late July KG 76 flew attacks against the rail links between Leningrad and Moscow. On 1 July II Gruppe flew against the airfield at Novgorod with ZG 26 but could only destroy four aircraft on the ground for the loss of one Ju 88 to the 6 IAP. Its pilot Bodo Lehr died, drowning in lake Ilmen. In August I./KG 76 carried out attacks in the Lake Ilmen area on the second day. It also bombed targets in and around Novgorod on 14 August. On 26 August Byegunitsi. II./KG 76 transferred to Korovye Selo on 23‚Äì25 July, south of Pskov. It bombed targets in the Kamenka area on 31 July. III. Gruppe supported the drive to Lenningrad, Novgorod and Lake Ladoga from 19‚Äì20 July. It bombed Krasnogvardeisk. Along with KG 4 and KG 77, KG 76 conducted a seven-hour rolling attack on Northwestern Front forces in the Staraya Russa area which eliminated resistance there. In September KG 76 was reassigned to Luftflotte 2. III. Gruppe was moved to Orsha. II Gruppe also supported the advance to Lenningrad until 27 September. It moved to Orsha on 29 September. I Gruppe followed suit on the same day. In the days following KG 76 shifted its support to Army Group Centre during Operation Typhoon that led to the Battle of Moscow. I./KG 76 bombed Moscow several times, from 10 November 1941 onwards. I./KG 76 was put under the command of Fliegerkorps VII, and then withdrawn for re-equipment in January 1942. 's losses during Barbarossa were light for II./KG 76. II./KG 76 losses amounted to just 2 per week, including damaged machines.de Zeng et al.. Vol 2. 2007, p. 229,233. =Crimean, Black Sea and Caucasus= Stab KG 76 remained in the East tactically renamed Gefechtsverband Bormann. It commanded formations from KG 54, KG 76 and KG 77. It fought the Red Army counter-attack which began on 5 December 1941 and on defensive operations from 9 November 1941 to April 1942. II Gruppe was sent to East Prussia to rest and refit. It began returning a staffel at a time. It took part in the Battles of Rzhev from 29‚Äì30 December 1941. In 1941 II./KG 76 suffered the loss of one to two aircraft per week. On 1 January 1942 it operated in the Staritsa. It participated in unspecified operations at Torzhok northwest of Kalinin on 2 January. Rzhev was bombed on the 24 January and it carried out attacks in the area of Yukhnov on the 29th day. The group moved further south on 5 February, bombing Voronezh and Kresty on 15 February. On 1 March 1942 it recorded 28 Ju 88A-4s and three Ju 88C-6s. Activities in March are unknown. It transferred to Kitzingen via Orsha and Giebelstadt on 11 April 1942. KG 76 continued to serve under Fliegerkorps VIII under Wolfram Freiherr von Richthofen, itself subordinated to Luftflotte 2. The Stab unit transferred from Orsha to Kitzingen Germany on 11 April 1942. I Gruppe re-equipped unit mid-April 1942 and had 22 Ju 88s at Giebelstadt on 1 April. It transferred to Zebriko near Odessa on 17 April. III./KG 76 was transferred back to Army Group North and Luftflotte 1 on 12 November. It flew bombing operations near Lake Ilmen from 13‚Äì17 November 1941. From 19‚Äì21 November KG 76 flew in support of the Siege of Leningrad. Long-range operations against Rzhev on 23 November. Novopetrovskoye in Tula Oblast was the target on 21 December. No losses were listed for the group from 25 December 1941 to mid-March 1942. It maintained raids over Rzhev but listed zero aircraft on strength, perhaps because of refitting on 1 March, but is known to have carried out attacks against Soviet partisans. Soviet destroyer Bditelnyy I Gruppe reported 22 Ju 88s fit for combat in April. It was based at Sarabus in the Crimea via Kharkov and arrived there from 7‚Äì14 May. The group supported the 11th Army advance into the Crimea. It rapidly redeployed to Kharkov via Zaporozhye on 14 May. 76 supported the counter offensive at the Izyum salient in the Second Battle of Kharkov from 15‚Äì27 May. It operated under the Fliegerkorps IV commanded by Kurt Pflugbeil. On 18 May Pflugbeil's command destroyed 130 tanks and 500 other vehicles. The following day it claimed another 29 tanks destroyed. As the battle came to a close, the tightly-packed and trapped Soviet forces were defeated in detail. Fliegerkorps IV claimed 596 aircraft in the air and 19 on the ground during the battle. 227 tanks, 3,083 motor vehicles, 24 artillery batteries, 49 artillery pieces, two anti-aircraft batteries, 22 locomotives and six trains for the cost of 49 aircraft. The group then moved to Sarabus, returning to Fliegerkorps VIII. It bombed Sevastopol and then attacked the port facilities at Novorossisk over 31 May‚Äì3 July 1942. O 1 July, fearing Sevastopol would be evacuated at the last minute the Luftwaffe sent 78 bombers‚Äîfrom I./KG 76, 1./KG 100, and 40 Ju 87s from StG 77, escorted by 40 Messerschmitt Bf 109s. For the loss of only one bomber, the Tashkent, and the transports Ukrania, Proletariy and Elbrus were sunk. The salvage vessel Chernomor, the schooner Dnestr, two torpedo boats and a patrol boat. In addition the destroyers Soobrazitelny and Nezamozhnik, patrol vessels Shkval and Shtorm, one gunboat, one torpedo boat, two transports, and a floating dock sustained various degrees of damage. On 2 July it sank the Soviet Navy destroyer Bditelny and damaged the Soviet cruiser Komintern. It was assisted by III Gruppe. It patrolled the Black Sea and bombed Novorossisk from 1‚Äì27 June. The Red Air Force responded with night attacks on German airfields. 76 suffered \\"continuous aircraft losses.\\" KG 76 supported Case Blue, which began on 28 June. On 9 July KG 76 carried out successful bombing operations against Yelets and the rail yards at Tambov and Povorino. III. Gruppe supported the drive to Voronezh from the beginning of the offensive to 16 July. From 17 July it flew bombing operations supporting the advance to the Don river and Kalach. II Gruppe opened the offensive based at Kursk. It is known to have attack targets in and around Lipetsk on 7 July. From 9 July it may have supported the bombing raids on Yelets and rail junctions at Tambov and Povorino in support of the 4th Panzer Army. It moved to Belyy Kolodez and onto Tatsinskaya Airfield on 8/9 August 1942. From here it took part in the Battle of Stalingrad and the advance to the Caucasus. It also attacked Soviet shipping along the Volga River. It flew operations as far eastward as Astrakhan and Grozny from 10 August to mid-November. Operating east of Stalingrad on 21 August, KG 76 (probably II Gruppe) attacked and destroyed two Red Army reserve divisions caught in the open. Richthofen wrote in his diary \\"blood flowed!\\". The wing was present during the opening carpet bombing attacks against the city on 23 August. After the fall of Voronezh KG 76 provided effective support for the 2nd Army by flying sorties against Soviet airfields. After the 9 July, to the end of the battle on 24 July, KG 76, KG 27 and II./JG 77 were the only air units left to support Axis forces. The assortment of groups were renamed Gefechtsverband Nord and placed under the command of Alfred B√ºlowius. The ad- hoc group were used as emergency reinforcements. On 20 July, with Voronezh fall imminent, KG 27 and 76 had been sent southward to assist in the Battle of Rostov only to be rushed back to the area when a Soviet offensive broke through German lines. KG 76 operated over at night. On a bombing operation over Saratov on 24 September, 7 staffel lost a Ju 88 shot down by the all- female 586th Fighter Aviation Regiment. It is believed Lt. Valeria Khomyakova was the Soviet pilot involved. I./KG 76 flew against oil targets in Astrakhan and Grozny in September. By 20 September 1942 it had 19 of 24 Ju 88s operational. 1. and 2. staffel were withdrawn to the north to support a planned assault on Leningrad (Operation Nordlich). On 25 September it reported losses over the city. II. Gruppe could muster 39 Ju 88s with only 19 serviceable. The group also had lost squadrons to the cancelled Leningrad operation; they returned on 6 October 1942. Under the command of Luftflotte 4 it began operations in the Akhtuba on 19 October. From northern Caucasia it attack Soviet shipping in the port of Tuapse on 3 November. I and II Gruppe ceased operations on the 15 November 1942. III Gruppe staged their withdrawal over the course of two weeks, finally leaving the Eastern Front in early December 1942. =Mediterranean and African theatres= The unit took part in the Mediterranean, Middle East and African theatres. In November 1942 I., II., and III./KG 76 were transferred to Athens‚ÄìLaon, Greece and from there moved to Crete. I Gruppe moved to support the Afrika Korps in North Africa. The theatre had changed considerably and KG 76 were part of an influx of air units to prevent an Axis collapse in the region. On 23 October 1942 the British Eighth Army began an offensive at El Alamein at broke through German-Italian lines on 4 November. Four days later, Anglo-American forces landed in Algeria and Morocco in Operation Torch. Axis forces were threatened with destruction in a large pincer move. I Gruppe began bombing operations within a week but saw two changes in command. Hauptmann Hanns Heise was appointed the group commander in January 1942 but was succeeded by Major Rudolf Hallensleben in October 1942. Hallensleben was replaced by Major Ulrich Roch in January 1943. Missions were flown against Allied shipping off Tobruk and Benghazi. Allied ships were also targeted along the Egyptian coast to Alexandria from 23 November to 12 December 1942. The group reported 20 Ju 88s ready for action on 1 December. It transferred from Heraklion to Catania, Sicily. Under the command of Major Rudolf Hallensleben, it escorted Axis convoys between Italy and Africa. A shortage of transportation aircraft necessitated the use of the group to transport fuel to North Africa from 6 December. Some of its staffeln conducted anti-submarine patrols by utilising its Ju 88s as Maritime patrol aircraft. Operations over Algeria and or Tunisia are known to have been flown until 10 December. It flew bombing operations over Tunisian ports and Algiers on 12 and 30 January. It bombed Algiers again on 2 March. The group bombed Tripoli. It was removed from operations from 12‚Äì17 March 1943 to Ansbach, Germany for rest and refit. Ju 88s over Crete. 76 operated from the island over the winter, 1942/43 On 9 December it lost two Ju 88s in a collision during an air battle with No. 272 Squadron RAF Bristol Beaufighters. On 4 January 1943 another pilot was wounded. Another Ju 88 was lost and the pilot of another wounded in an attack on Thelepte airfield. USAAF Curtiss P-40 Warhawks of the 59th Fighter Squadron, 33rd Fighter Group intercepted. The Ju 88s managed to bomb the airfield damaging two P-40s. On the 15 January another loss was reported. Three days later on 18 January, Staffelkapit√§n of 1 staffel, G√ºnther Haussmann and his experiences crew were reported missing. After another loss on 22 January, 2 staffel lost its commanding officer Oberleutnant Fritz K√∂hler. Another loss was reported on 8 and 21 February. On 3 and 5 March I Gruppe lost an aircraft on each night. The latter loss was in the area No. 89 Squadron RAF night fighters operated. II./KG 76 remained on operations until the 26 April 1943. It was based at Crete until 26 December 1942. Its base was bombed on 23 and 24 December. The group began operations over Algeria and the Battle of Tunisia. B√©ja√Øa and B√¥ne were bombed on 21 and 23 January. It attacked Tripoli on 14 and 26 February. On 3 March its staffeln attacked Algiers. The group sustained heavy losses and was reduced to only five crews by 15 April. The group's first known loss occurred on 21 January when it lost a Ju 88 to a No. 153 Squadron RAF night fighter and another was lost on 23 January. On 14 February the group sustained a loss to 89 Squadron. On 22 February 1943 the group lost its commanding officer Major Richard Meyer killed when he was shot down by Second Lieutenant Cochran from the US 96th Fighter Squadron. On night operations on 26/27 February the group lost another Ju 88 to 89 Squadron Beaufighters. A third was lost near Algiers on 3 March. On 31 March it lost two Ju 88s‚Äîthe worst daily loss suffered over Africa. Before the group was withdrawn, it suffered two more losses; the last on 28 April. III./KG 76 began attacking Allied shipping in the Eastern Mediterranean with 15 Ju 88s recorded on strength on 1 December. It struck at targets east of RAF Castel Benito on 19 December 1942. On 18 January 1943 it was forced to abandon its airfield at Tympakion to Athens because of Allied air attacks. Until March it refitted and rested at Wiener Neustadt. It transferred to Sicily on 19 March and carried out night raids against Sfax in Tunisia on 27/28 March. Bombing raids against El Guettar in central Tunisia on 1 April, and Djaidoud-Metovia on 7 April. On 15 and 16 April it attacked B≈ène and Malta. Philippeville and Tripoli were the targets of bombing operations on 20 April and 3 May. On 16/17 May 1943 the group withdrew to Foggia in Italy. On 16‚Äì17 May the group took part in raids on Allied airfields in Corsica. At Poretta airfield, it destroyed 25 Spitfires. An attack on Alesan airfield destroyed 30 B-25s and damaged another 45. The unit was withdrawn on 16 July 1943 to Laon-Athies in France. During these operations it lost two Gruppenkommandeur‚ÄîHauptmann Heinrich Schweitkhardt was posted missing in action on 9 January 1943 and Hauptmann Anton Stadler on 29 April 1943. Schweitkhardt reported his engine trouble after combat with No. 253 Squadron RAF 70 miles west of Zante Island at 13:08. He continued to broadcast until 13:54 until contact ceased. He never returned. On 9 April a Ju 88 was lost to the British ace Peter Wykeham. It lost another two Ju 88s which were covering a convoy on 19 April 15 miles northwest of Pantellaria. No. 229 Squadron RAF Spitfires with long-range tanks were likely their attackers. 12 Ju 88s were lost by the group over Africa. =Italian front= I./KG 76 returned to southern Europe in mid-May 1943. The group was ordered to attack Allied shipping in the Mediterranean Sea. The group was moved to Foggia in southern Italy.

By the 12th century, Ap√°tistv√°nfalva was a Cistercian lordship. In 1183 B√©la III of Hungary founded a Cistercian abbey in Szentgotth√°rd. The monks arrived from the Trois-Fontaines Abbey, Champagne, France. For many years, the Hungarian Slovenes had attended church in R√°bakethely (near Szentgotth√°rd), Fels≈ësz√∂ln√∂k, or Great Dolenci (Slovenia).

In the choir The High Altar (Legend of Stephen Harding-Mural). Bishop Szily supported masses being offered in the local language (Croatian, the Prekmurje dialect, or German), and therefore he appointed Marits. In 2005 Jo≈æef Smej, the bishop of Maribor, and few Hungarian and Slovenian priests blessed a memorial tablet in the church listing the names of Ap√°tistv√°nfalvian priests and chaplains. Building The walls of the church are thick and it can hold 2,000 people. The baroque murals were created by an unknown painter. The High Altar shows the Legend of St. Stephen Harding. The Trinity is depicted above the mural. There is an organ in the choir. The organ was made in 1894 and restored in 2007. Prior to the restoration a small organ was used. The steeple has two bells. Near the church are a school, cemetery, and parish office, war memorial, and statue of the Virgin Mary.

Constructed during the middle of the nineteenth century, it was originally home to one of the city's most prominent men, and it has been named a historic site due to its unusual design. In its earliest years, the city of Franklin was heavily influenced by the Schenck family, who sponsored much of its early development. A member of a later generation of the family, John N. Schenck, arranged for the construction of the present house in 1860. At the time, Orson Squire Fowler's ideal of the octagon house was at the height of its popularity, and Schenck's use of the style demonstrates his wealth at the time. Rather than living in it, Schenck gave it to his daughter and son-in-law, Charles Butler, who occupied a leading place in Franklin's governmental and commercial circles.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 2. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 1373. Built of brick, the Butler House is covered with a metal roof., Ohio Historical Society, 2007. Accessed 2014-01-01. The architecture includes numerous distinctive details, including the four-over-four windows placed in pairs, the wooden cornice with brackets, and the molding around the lintels. Because the house sits atop a small hill, a person inside is able to view a panorama of the city as well as the Great Miami River. In 1982, the Butler House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying because of its distinctive architecture; it is one of four National Register-listed locations in the city, along with the prehistoric Hill-Kinder Mound, the Mackinaw Historic District, and the Old Log Post Office. Significant to its designation was its rarity; it is one of two octagon houses in Franklin, but only one other such house remains anywhere else in southwestern Ohio, although the Goldsmith Coffeen House in Lebanon is built as a hexagon.

After the Emancipation reform of 1861 the need for prison space greatly increased; before the reforms, serfs were incarcerated by their landowners and after the reforms they were put in state prisons. Thus, in 1867 the wine warehouse was transformed into a 700-bed prison separated into female and male areas. The reconstruction of the wine warehouse was developed by Vladislav Lvov, the chairman of the Saint Petersburg Prison Committee.–°–ª–µ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π –∏–∑–æ–ª—è—Ç–æ—Ä ‚Ññ1 - \\"–ö–†–ï–°–¢–´\\" Construction of the new prison In 20 years the prison became too small for the city. The project for the new city prison was developed by Antony Tomishko, a citizen of Austria- Hungary, a member of the Russian Academy of Arts and a staff architect of the Russian State Prison Administration. He was the designer of the Model Uyezd Prison originally built in Staraya Russa and reproduced in Vesyegonsk, Vyazma, Tsaritsyn and other places. Tomishko studied the organization of prisons in Germany and was impressed by the Moabit prison, with three blocks joining a single one tower. He also appreciated the Philadelphia system that recommended building prisons in the shape of a star with many rays coming from a single observation point. The system was also known as the Panopticon system. Tomishko designed a prison consisting of two five-storey cross-shaped buildings. The shape of the buildings allowed observation of all the corridors from a single point and also had religious significance, encouraging penance among the inmates. The crosses were joined together by a massive five onion domed red brick Russian Revival cathedral on top of an administrative building. There was also a prison hospital, a ward for infectious diseases, a morgue, an ice-room and a smithy. Construction started in 1884 and continued until 1890. It was performed by the inmates of the prison who were kept on the site: a part of the old prison was demolished, then the detainees built the new one while continuing to live in the remaining parts of the old building, then the prisoners were moved to the new building, the remains of the old building were demolished and construction continued. The prison was one of the first buildings in Russia that used electric lighting, effective ventilation and central heating. In the center of one of the cross-shaped buildings Tomishko installed a monument to English philanthropist and prison reformer John Howard. By the time it was built it was considered the most advanced prison in the world and it still remains the largest prison in Europe.Museum of Kresty According to an urban legend, Tomishko was so proud of his creation that he reported to Tsar Alexander III: \\"Your Majesty, I have built the prison for you\\"; \\"No, you have built it for yourself\\", supposedly answered the Tsar. The legend continues that besides the 999 official prison cells there is a secret cell number 1000 that still holds the dead body of Tomishko, while his ghost haunts the prison. The legend is almost certainly false (at least there are only 960 cells in the prison). Prison in Imperial Russia In Imperial Russia the prison was officially called Saint Petersburg Prison for Solitary Confinement and was used for the detention of both common criminals and political prisoners. Among the inmates were: future Prime Minister of the Russian Provisional Government Alexander Kerensky, the founder of the Constitutional Democratic party Pavel Milyukov, the prominent Bolshevik revolutionaries Leon Trotsky and Vladimir Antonov-Ovseenko, and future first Soviet People's Commissar of Enlightenment Anatoly Lunacharsky. In 1906 all 200 deputies of the first State Duma of the Russian Empire who had signed the Vyborg Manifesto had to spend three months in Kresty Prison. On the evening of , during the February Revolution, rebellious soldiers and workers who came to a meeting near the Finlyandsky Rail Terminal were led by Mikhail Kalinin to storm the Kresty. They stormed the prison from both sides, freed the inmates, and burnt all the prison paperwork in the courtyard. E. N. Burdzhalov, Russia's Second Revolution, trans. Donald L. Raleigh, Indiana University Press, 1987 The prime objectives of the Bolsheviks were:1. to destroy the police records pertaining to Bolshevik comrades 2.To deliberately emulate the Storming of the Bastille from the French Revolution. In releasing all the prisoners, a large minority of political prisoners (Bolsheviks, Social Revolutionaries, and trade unionists) were released, along with thieves, debtors, murderers and others, without discrimination. After the Revolution After the February Revolution Kresty became a place of imprisonment for the ministers of the Tsarist government and prominent police officers. After the October Revolution they were joined by people from the Russian Provisional Government, non-Bolshevik politicians and intelligentsia. Among the people imprisoned there were Prime Minister Boris St√ºrmer, who died in Kresty in September 1917, Justice Minister Ivan Scheglovitov, Minister of the Interior Alexei Khvostov, Minister of War Mikhail Belyayev, former Minister of War Vladimir Sukhomlinov, Chief of Police Yevgeny Klimovich, the great Russian poet Nikolay Gumilyov. In 1920 the prison was renamed as the Second Special Camp for Involuntary Labor and was administered by Petrograd Ispolkom. In 1923 the prison became Petrograd District Isolation Prison (–ü–µ—Ç—Ä–æ–≥—Ä–∞–¥—Å–∫–∞—è –û–∫—Ä—É–∂–Ω–∞—è –ò–∑–æ–ª—è—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–Ω–∞—è –¢—é—Ä—å–º–∞), part of the Petrograd Cheka system. During the Great Purges, the prison overflowed with inmates accused of state crimes. Often cells designed for solitary confinement held 15‚Äì20 inmates or more. Among the inmates were: painter Kazimir Malevich, poet Nikolay Zabolotsky, historian Lev Gumilyov, actor Georgiy Zhzhonov, future Marshal of the Soviet Union Konstantin Rokossovsky and many others. The prison features prominently in Anna Akhmatova's poem Requiem. In the poem she writes: Her wish was fulfilled half a century after her death. On the grounds of the prison operated a sharashka ‚Äì a research and development facility called OKB-172 that used inmates as weapons engineers and researchers. The facility developed torpedo boats that were widely used by the Soviet Navy during World War II. During the Siege of Leningrad most detainees were either conscripted into the Penal military units of Soviet Army or transferred to the Eastern regions of the country. The prison was used for detaining those involved in stealing of food or ration cards, and later also for German POWs. Many guards and detainees died of starvation during the siege. Modern days The prison church of St. Alexander Nevsky In 1964 the prison became the facility used mostly for pre-trial detentions. It was greatly overcrowded: in the mid-1990s the prison held more than 12,500 inmates, more than ten times the design capacity (1150 inmates). Often a cell originally designed for solitary confinement during the Tsarist period and according to the Soviet rules suitable for only six inmates would actually hold more than 20 inmates taking their turns to sleep on the three-level bunk bed and on the floor. Detention for months or even years in those conditions, often manipulated by the investigators, was often a method to press the suspects. In 1983 the prison was deemed unsuitable for women and minors. The prison was mostly used for common criminals but many Soviet dissidents from Leningrad were also held there during the investigations and trials. The judicial reforms of the 1990s made long pre-trial detentions available only with approval of the courts. Currently no more than six inmates can be held in a cell originally designed for solitary confinement. In 1993 a museum was open inside the prison devoted to the history of the prison, famous inmates and unusual objects found on the detainees. On 28 April 1995 the monument To the victims of Political repressions made by Mikhail Shemyakin was installed on the embankment across the Neva River from the prison. It depicts two bronze sphinxes with pretty women's faces as seen from the residential houses on the embankment and bare skulls as seen from the prison's side of the river. There is a stylized window with prison bars between the sphinxes. On the granite base of the monument there are inscriptions with quotes from Nikolay Gumilyov, Osip Mandelstam, Anna Akhmatova, Nikolay Zabolotsky, Daniil Andreyev, Dmitry Likhachev, Joseph Brodsky, Yuri Galanskov, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, Vladimir Vysotsky and Vladimir Bukovsky. On 19 December 2006 a monument to poet Anna Akhmatova by Galina Dodonova was erected across Neva River opposite to the prison according to her will in her poem Requiem...–ê –µ—Å–ª–∏ –∫–æ–≥–¥–∞-–Ω–∏–±—É–¥—å –≤ —ç—Ç–æ–π —Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–µ// –í–æ–∑–¥–≤–∏–≥–Ω—É—Ç—å –∑–∞–¥—É–º–∞—é—Ç –ø–∞–º—è—Ç–Ω–∏–∫ –º–Ω–µ,// –°–æ–≥–ª–∞—Å—å–µ –Ω–∞ —ç—Ç–æ –¥–∞—é —Ç–æ—Ä–∂–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ,// –ù–æ —Ç–æ–ª—å–∫–æ —Å —É—Å–ª–æ–≤—å–µ–º: –Ω–µ —Å—Ç–∞–≤–∏—Ç—å –µ–≥–æ// –ù–∏ –æ–∫–æ–ª–æ –º–æ—Ä—è, –≥–¥–µ —è —Ä–æ–¥–∏–ª–∞—Å—å// (–ü–æ—Å–ª–µ–¥–Ω—è—è —Å –º–æ—Ä–µ–º —Ä–∞–∑–æ—Ä–≤–∞–Ω–∞ —Å–≤—è–∑—å),// –ù–∏ –≤ —Ü–∞—Ä—Å–∫–æ–º —Å–∞–¥—É —É –∑–∞–≤–µ—Ç–Ω–æ–≥–æ –ø–Ω—è,// –ì–¥–µ —Ç–µ–Ω—å –±–µ–∑—É—Ç–µ—à–Ω–∞—è –∏—â–µ—Ç –º–µ–Ω—è,// –ê –∑–¥–µ—Å—å, –≥–¥–µ —Å—Ç–æ—è–ª–∞ —è —Ç—Ä–∏—Å—Ç–∞ —á–∞—Å–æ–≤// –ò –≥–¥–µ –¥–ª—è –º–µ–Ω—è –Ω–µ –æ—Ç–∫—Ä—ã–ª–∏ –∑–∞—Å–æ–≤.. Anna Akhmatova Requiem, 1937 On 25 December 2006 a copy of the monument was installed in a corridor of the prison itself. In summer 2006 Vladimir Putin (President of Russia) announced that the prison would be relocated to a new facility in the Kolpinsky District on the outskirts of Saint Petersburg. After the relocation is complete the Kresty building will be sold at auction. It is anticipated that the prison building will be transferred into a hotel-entertainment complex. The available options are limited as the prison is considered a protected architectural landmark and only very limited redesign is possible. The new remand prison, Kresty 2, will be built by 2016 in Kolpino, a suburb located 20 miles outside of St.Petersburg. It is being constructed at a cost of $378 million.Carrie Crockett Reflections on the world‚Äôs largest prison in Carceral Archipelago on December 19, 2014 It will become the Europe‚Äôs biggest detention center, capable of housing 4,000 people.

The Gothic Revival cathedral styled church is the largest of the Roman Catholic churches in the City of Detroit. It was designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1974 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. It, along with St. Albertus Roman Catholic Church, 0.4 miles east on East Canfield Street, and St. Josaphat Roman Catholic Church, 0.3 miles west at East Canfield Street and Chrysler Drive, served the large Polish community through most of the twentieth century. In a diocesan reorganization instituted by Archbishop Allen Vigneron in 2013, Sweetest Heart of Mary joined with St. Josephat to form Mother of Divine Mercy Parish. History The rise of Detroit brought in many Polish immigrants into the city in the 19th century; by the mid-1850s, the number of Polish families who had settled in the city was significant. These √âmigr√©s from Poland first attended St. Joseph's parish, which was at the time a German-speaking church. However, the Polish congregants were dissatisfied, and agitated for a Polish church. In 1871, three hundred or so Polish families organized St. Albertus Parish and built a frame church at St. Aubin and Canfield Avenue. In 1882, the charismatic Father became pastor of St. Albertus. Kolasinski and organized the parish to construct the present St. Albertus Church, which was dedicated in 1885. In November 1885, the parish became factionalized and Kolasinski was reassigned. When Reverend John Foley became the new Bishop of Detroit in 1888, Kolasinski returned to the city and began the Parish of the Sweetest Heart of Mary outside the jurisdiction of the Detroit Diocese. Shortly afterward, the congregation added the school structure on Canfield, which still stands behind the church. Kolasinski negotiated to bring his flock, numbering nearly 4,000 families, into the fold of the Catholic Church. The Panic of 1893 hit the parish hard. Parish members secured a loan in order to keep the building. Eventually, Rome directed the bishop of Detroit to make peace with Kolasinski, and the congregation of the Sweetest Heart of Mary was officially received into the Diocese of Detroit on February 18, 1894. Sweetest Heart of Mary Roman Catholic Church Kolasinski died in 1898. He was temporarily succeeded by the Kashubian priest Rev. Jan Romuald Byzewski OFM, previously pastor of Detroit's Saint Francis of Assisi Parish. When Father Byzewski rejoined the Franciscan Order in 1899, he was succeeded by the assistant, Rev. Joseph Folta, who served as pastor until 1919. Father Folta built a second school, constructed a permanent rectory, and built an ornamental fence about the church. Folta was succeeded by Rev. Joseph Casimir Plagens, who served at Sweetest Heart from 1919 until 1935, and later became Bishop of Marquette and then Bishop of Grand Rapids. Plagens added embellishments to the church interior and built a permanent convent for the Sisters of St. Joseph, who staffed the parish school. During Father Plagens's tenure, the parish flourished. The church school was filled with almost 1,500 pupils, and the church was the social as well as spiritual center of the community. Over time, with shifting demographics, membership waned. This trend accelerated through the tenures of the next three pastors: Monsignor Michael Grupa (1935 to 1949), Rev. Adam Koprowski (1949 to 1959), and Rev. Boguslaus Pozna≈Ñski (1959 to 1976). During the 1960s and early 1970s the congregation numbers fell. In 1976, Rev. Bohdan Kosicki joined Sweetest Heart, began a building restoration, and implemented a plan which revived church membership. He reached out and established ties to earlier parishioners, raising funds for the restoration. Sweetest Heart of Mary was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. It received state historic designation in 1974, and city of Detroit designation in 1981. A state of Michigan historical marker was also erected in 1981. The stained glass windows and organ were restored, and much of the main altar was renovated. In addition, the convent and fencing were restored, the second school building was demolished, and the historic old school building was stabilized. Kosicki's work was carried on through the tenure of Rev. Alphons Gorecki, who served from 1981 through 2002. Other work included refurbishing the interior, repairing plasterwork and statues, and upgrading electrical wiring. From 2002 until early 2010, Fr. Mark A. Borkowski was pastor and continued the restoration and revival of Sweetest Heart of Mary. During this period the Annual Pierogi Festival greatly expanded to become the largest religious festival in the City of Detroit. July 1, 2011, Fr. Darrell Roman became the new administrator in addition to being administrator for the other two churches in the cluster, St. Joseph and St. Josaphat.

The cornerstone-laying ceremony was held on June 5, 1892, and on December 24, 1893, after construction costs of over $125,000, the church was officially dedicated. More than 10,000 people attended the dedication ceremony. Sweetest Heart of Mary is one of the largest Gothic Revival churches in the Midwest, and perhaps the most impressive. The church is constructed of red brick in a cruciform shape with a cross gabled roof. The facade on Russell boasts a rusticated stone lower level with a triple portal, a pointed arch structure, and a stone balustrade atop everything. Two towers flank the entrance, topped with identical spires, which are capped with buttresses and detailed with crosses. The church includes several impressive stained glass windows created by Detroit Stained Glass Works, the successor to the well known firm of Friederichs and Staffin. The major transept window illustrates the Holy Family in Saint Joseph's workshop. Eight windows lining the nave portray Christ, Mary, and several saints; this set of windows won a major prize at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. There are three related building‚Äîa large rectory, a convent that could house several dozen religious sisters, and a large school building‚Äîwhich make up a local historic district. The 1893 Austin pipe organ Opus No. 2 (2 manuals and 20 ranks) is the oldest Austin Organ still in service, and the oldest surviving electro- pneumatic in the state of Michigan.

The organisation had branches open in every major Macedonian settlement in Australia.Peter, Hill. (1989) The Macedonians in Australia, Hesperian Press, Carlisle. Chapter 5; Getting Together, The Macedonian Australian People's League Foundation On 24 and 25 August the Macedonian Community in Perth, Edinstvo, held a national conference where member from all Macedonian communities in Australia were invited to. The decision was made that a national organisation should be established for the Macedonians in Australia. The Conference of 25 August 1946 brought forward a number of resolutions of; *firstly, that a Macedonian league be organised incorporating the organisations in attendance and that the committee elected undertake to incorporate all Macedonian organisation in Australia *secondly, that a migrant newspaper be produced in the Macedonian language *thirdly, that action be taken to organise an appeal among Australian Macedonian migrants for a hospital building and equipment in the newly created Republic of Macedonia'' Kiro Angelcoff was elected as the group's first president. A gifted orator he travelled to Adelaide, Melbourne, Crabbes Creek, Shepparton, Port Kembla, Newcastle, Queanbeyan and many other places organising the existing groups and creating new ones. He soon gained the nickname The Organizer. The first regular convention was held on 7 to 9 March 1947 in Melbourne. The convention was attended by members from all Macedonian organisations in Australia. It was here that the organization formally adopted the name, \\"Macedonian Australian People's League\\" and elected a national committee to conduct its coordinated affairs. It brought forward its constitution by which this national organisation would run its affairs and also resolved that a target of ¬£10,000 be raised towards the Hospital Appeal. The National Committee elected in 1947 was as follows; President - Kiro Angelcoff, Vice-President - Stojan Sarbinoff, Secretary and Editor - Ilo Malkov, Treasurer - Mick Veloski. Organisation The Macedonian-Australian People's League dominated Macedonian community life for over 10 years. There were branches wherever there was a group of Macedonians. A flurry of Picnics, Dances, fund-raisers and community unity followed. 9 months after the committee had been formed an estimate 53 groups had joined the Macedonian-Australian People's League.Pollitecon Publications : : Books on the Macedonians of Greece The branch in Adelaide was formed under the name of \\"Alexander the Great\\", with Vasil Apostol as the president. In 1951 a youth wing was formed by Kosta Radin and Kosta Kiosses. Many branches of the MAPL were established in New South Wales. The Queanbeyan Branch was called \\"Mladi Goce\\" after the name of the commander of the First Aegean Partisan Brigade. The branch of the MAPL in Crabbes Creek was known as Sloboda/Freedom was first opened in 1947. Other branches opened in Bonnyrigg, Port Kembla, Forbes, Richmond, Queanbeyan, Port Kembla, Braidwood, Captains Flat, Beechwood and Newcastle.The Macedonians Two the groups of Sydney, \\"Vesela Makedonija\\" and Richmond, \\"Kotori\\" often collaborated. They often held picnics in the Royal National Park or joint fundraisers. In the annual soccer game \\"Vesela Makedonija\\" beat \\"Kotori\\" 4:3. The Perth group, \\"Edinstvo\\" was one of the most active branches of the community. Originally the first group to publish the \\"Makedonska Iskra\\" newspaper. The Macedonian organisation in Manjimup, Sloboba eventually joined the League. Other branches were formed in Geraldton, Wanneroo, Kalgoorlie and Port Headland. In 1948 a branch in Brisbane was founded. The hospital appeals Macedonian Migrants in all corners of the world had commenced an appeal to raise funds in an effort to assist the Macedonians in Macedonia to build hospitals and medical centres. The Macedonian-Australian People's League went on to play a major part in this campaign. One of the organization's resolutions was to raise funds for this campaign. A sub-committee was elected to organise the fund raising in 1946; its president was Phillip Jumbazoff. There were three main appeals, one in 1947, one in 1948 and the last in 1949. In 1947 the committee held a \\"Miss Macedonia\\" beauty pageant. The candidates were Connie Pappas, Paula Veloska, Tina Malco, Dana Gatsos, Lina Raicos and Pam Ognenis. Dana Gatsos was crowned as the inaugural Miss Macedonia. The MAPL set a fund-raising target of ¬£10,000. The first sum of ¬£1,500 was forwarded to Skopje on 13 March 1947. This was four days after the inaugural conference of the league. Most of the money raised was from Western Australia where the MAPL was most prominent. The League raise a total of ¬£11,024 which ¬£3,791 was from NSW, ¬£1,350 from Victoria, ¬£320 from South Australia and ¬£5,563 from Western Australia. A total of $154,000 was raised by Macedonian Migrants all over the world. The following inscription appears on a plaque at the hospital in Skopje a tribute to the Macedonian Diaspora. :*\\"The Buildings and equipping of this clinic block was possible due to the help of the Migrants of Macedonian origin settled in the USA, Canada, South America and Australia. :*In the foundations of this building are laid the love of Macedonian migrants for their free homeland and our deep thankyous\\" A second call for donations was announced in early 1948. Within New South Wales a pro rata system was set up in order to raise funds more efficiently. The Crabbes Creek branch went on to raise over ¬£270, Sydney - ¬£100 and Newcastle ¬£75. The Richmond, Queanbeyan and Port Kembla branches were closely behind. Once again the West Australian branches raised the most money. The first donations from Queensland also began to flow in 1948. The Third Hospital Appeal was called in 1949. This was by far the largest and most successful. In New South Wales the Crabbes Creek branch went on to raise ¬£819, while Port Kembla came in second at over ¬£420. The Katoomba branch raised over ¬£115. Makedonska Iskra Masthead of Macedonian Spark Newspaper \\"Macedonian Spark\\" or \\"Makedonska Iskra\\" () was the first national Macedonian newspaper in Australia. It was original the journal of the Perth Group, \\"Edinstvo\\" but was then expanded to rest of Australia. The \\"Makedonska Iskra\\" newspaper was the organ of the MAPL. It was extremely active in raising funds for the Hospital Appeal. The Newspaper published information on all of the Macedonian events that were happenind in Australia. The paper was written in Vernacular rather than Standard Macedonian. Communities would often raise money to help fund the paper. \\"Makedonska Iskra\\" was printed monthly, initially in Perth. It moved to Sydney in 1948 and eventually to Melbourne from 1953 to 1957. The paper achieve considerable success in Australia and the rest of the world. Copies of Makedonska Iskra were posted to America, Canada and to the Socialist Republic of Macedonia. The newspaper is now a record of key historical events that shaped the Macedonian nation and of the many people and events within the Macedonian community in Australia. Macedonian Australian Ex-Servicemen's League The Macedonian Australian Ex-Servicemen's League was another organisation that was founded by the Macedonian-Australian People's League. It would survive the decentralisation of the Macedonian- Australian People's League. It was founded in late 1947 by Mick Veloskey and Ilija Malkov. The Macedonian Australian Ex-Servicemen's League is still active. Decentralisation At the 6th National Conference in Melbourne on 6/7 January 1957, the Macedonian-Australian People's League resolved to dencentralize; each branch was to seek incorporation at state level. Since the Macedonian-Australian People's League there has been no unified Macedonian Organisation in Australia. The \\"Macedonian Community of Western Australia\\" and \\"Macedonian Community of South Australia\\" were formed after the MAPL disbanded. Other groups are often divided and a major split occurred in the 1970s and 1980s in Many Macedonian Communities. Although some attempts of unification have been made such as the foundation of the \\"Federation of Macedonian Cultural and Artistic societies in Victoria\\" or FOMKUDV and the \\"Federation of Macedonian Associations in Victoria\\" or FOMAV.

It is a combination of brimonidine (an Œ±2 adrenergic agonist) and timolol (a Œ≤ adrenergic blocker), in concentrations of 0.2% and 0.5% respectively. Both substances work by decreasing the synthesis of aqueous humor. Combigan is marketed and sold by Allergan. It has been approved by regulatory authorities in Europe, Canada, and the United States for reduction of intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Although clinical studies showed that the IOP-lowering effect was slightly greater (1-2 mmHg) with concomitant administration of 0.5% timolol twice daily and 0.2% brimonidine tartrate three times daily than with Combigan twice daily, the safety profile of latter was more favorable.  Medical uses  Combigan (brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate) 0.2%/0.5% is used to reduce IOP in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension who need adjunctive or replacement therapy. The recommended dosage is one drop administered to the affected eye(s) twice a day, approximately every 12 hours. Both brimonidine 0.2% and timolol 0.5% are commonly used ophthalmic solutions for lowering IOP. Timolol 0.5% is dosed one drop once or twice daily, while brimonidine 0.2% is dosed one drop three times daily. For patients who need more than one medication to lower IOP, the fixed combination product offers the advantages of reducing the number of drops and medication bottles, improving patient compliance, and decreasing ocular exposure to preservatives in ophthalmic solutions.  Adverse effects  The most common adverse effects affecting 5 to 15% of the patients include allergic conjunctivitis, conjunctival folliculosis, conjunctival hyperemia, eye pruritus, ocular burning, and stinging. 1 to 5% of the patients in clinical trials experienced asthenia, blepharitis, corneal erosion, depression, epiphora, eye discharge, eye dryness, eye irritation, eye pain, eyelid edema, eyelid erythema, eyelid pruritus, foreign body sensation, headache, hypertension, oral dryness, somnolence, superficial punctate keratitis, and visual disturbance.  Contraindications  Contraindications of Combigan include the following: reactive airway disease including bronchial asthma, a history of bronchial asthma, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, sinus bradycardia, secondary or third degree atrioventricular block, overt cardiac failure, cardiogenic shock, age less than 2 years, and hypersensitivity to any component of Combigan.  Pharmacology  Combigan is composed of brimonidine, a selective alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist, and timolol, a non-selective beta-adrenergic receptor inhibitor. Elevated IOP is considered the only modifiable risk factor in the pathogenesis of glaucoma. Brimonidine exerts its ocular hypotensive effect by decreasing aqueous humor production and increasing uveoscleral outflow, while timolol acts by reducing aqueous humor production. Combigan has a fast onset of action, and the peak IOP lowering effect occurs at two hours after administration.  Preclinical studies  No carcinogenic effects were found with brimonidine tartrate in mice or rats. With timolol maleate, 300 mg/kg/day in rats (equivalent to about 42,000 times systemic exposure following the maximum recommended ocular dose in human [MRHOD]) was associated with significantly increased incidence of adrenal pheochromocytomas in a two-year study; in a lifetime study in mice, 500 mg/kg/day (equivalent to about 71,000 times systemic exposure following the MRHOD) but not 5 or 50 mg/kg/day (about 700 or 7,000 times systemic exposure following the MRHOD) of timolol maleate was associated with significantly increased incidence of benign and malignant pulmonary tumors, benign uterine polyps and mammary adenocarcinomas. Neither brimonidine tartrate nor timolol maleate was mutagenic in in vitro and in vivo studies. Reproduction and fertility studies in rats did not reveal any adverse effects on male or female fertility with brimonidine tartrate or timolol maleate.  Clinical trials  Two prospective, randomized, double-blinded, phase III clinical trials were conducted at 53 sites in the United States to compare the IOP-lowering efficacy and safety of 0.2% brimonidine tartrate/0.5% timolol maleate fixed combination twice daily with 0.2% brimonidine tartrate three times daily or 0.5% timolol maleate twice daily in patients aged 18 or older who had ocular hypertension or glaucoma. When assessed over a 3-month period, pooled results from a total of 1159 patients showed significantly greater mean IOP decrease from baseline with the brimonidine/timolol combination (4.9-7.6 mmHg) than with brimonidine monotherapy (3.1-5.5 mmHg) or timolol monotherapy (4.3-6.2 mmHg) across all follow-up visits. Similar efficacy results were reported during 12-month follow-up: mean IOP decrease from baseline was 4.4-7.6 mmHg with brimonidine/timolol combination, compared to 2.7-5.5 mmHg with brimonidine and 3.9-6.2 mmHg with timolol. The incidence of treatment- related adverse events with the brimonidine/timolol combination was lower than that with brimonidine monotherapy but higher than that with timolol monotherapy. A 12-week prospective, randomized, double-blinded study in 371 glaucoma and ocular hypertension patients with inadequate IOP control on monotherapy compared the efficacy and safety of 0.2% brimonidine tartrate/0.5% timolol fixed combination twice daily with the concomitant use of 0.2% brimonidine tartrate twice daily and timolol 0.5% twice daily. The IOP- lowering effect of the fixed combination group was shown to be non-inferior to that of concomitant therapy. Incidence of adverse events was similar between groups.  Society and culture  Commercial aspects = Allergan is the New Drug Application (NDA) holder of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution 0.2%/0.5%, which is sold under the COMBIGAN¬Æ trademark. The New Drug Application (NDA) for Combigan was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October 2007. Allergan, Plc is a global specialty pharmaceutical company which develops, manufactures, markets and distributes branded pharmaceutical products, aesthetic products, biosimilar and over-the- counter pharmaceutical products. In 2015, Actavis, Plc acquired Allergan, Inc. for approximately $77 billion and subsequently changed its name to Allergan, Plc. In 2015, the global revenues for Alphagan and Combigan totaled $411.1 million ($285 million from the US market), which accounted for 2.7% of Allergan's total net revenues. Allergan holds at least six active patents protecting Combigan from generic competition. Several generic companies challenged the validity of the patents and filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDA) seeking market entry. Allergan responded by filing a lawsuit against the ANDA filers. In Allergan, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc., the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that Allergan's composition- related patent claims were invalid based on obviousness, because brimonidine and timolol had already been marketed in the claimed concentrations. However, Allergan's method claim (US Patent No. 7,030,149), which states ‚Äúreducing the number of daily topical ophthalmic doses of brimonidine administered topically to an eye of a person in need thereof for the treatment of glaucoma or ocular hypertension from 3 to 2 times a day without loss of efficacy‚Äù, was held to be non-obvious. As a result, generic companies are prevented from marketing generic versions of Combigan until its patent expiration in 2022. Combigan is supplied in 5 mL, 10 mL, and 15 mL bottles. In the United States, the cash price of one 5-mL eye dropper of Combigan ranges from $160 to $190.

Featuring the archetypal point-and-click interface during investigations, engaging in planning a job would alter the controls to include keyboard, using it to control the planned movements of the personnel. Gameplay A Screenshot showing the planning of a robbery The Clue! is mixture of many video game genres. It can be described as role-playing adventure game with tactical/strategy elements and puzzles in the form of burglaries. The gameplay is composed of two different modes - most of the time, the player is travelling around the city of London and talking with people using point-and- click interface like in classical adventure games, while more strategy-like top-down perspective is used for the actual planning of the heists. The adventure mode features static graphics depicting various places with menu interface to control Matt's actions. It is in this mode, where the player buys and sells cars, tools and other equipment needed for thievery, recruits accomplices and scouts for possible target buildings. Every important information as an amount of money, description of tools, cars, loot, etc. can be accessed anytime through the Think menu. Before committing a burglary, the player must collect all the necessary information by investigation of the site. A car and at least one associate with driving skills is also obligatory. After these conditions have been fulfilled, the player can switch the game into the planning mode by selecting the option Planning in the hotel room.Game manual There he chooses the escape car, accomplices and the driver. In the final stage of planning, the player controls movement of the thieves by the keyboard and works out the details of the plan in real-time like simulation. The loot from successful coup must be sold to one of the three available dealers in order to earn money. Each dealer is specialized in different commodities and will not accept or will pay less for other types of merchandise. Essential part of the gameplay are skills such as driving, lockpicking or electronics, which affects the time needed to complete specific tasks. Some actions and tools depend on particular skill level of person doing it (for example using stethoscope for opening a safe lock requies higher skill level than using a welding torch for the same job). Participants of a successful burglary also improve their skills. In addition to skills, each character has various personal traits as dexterity, loyalty, greed or nerves. These traits affect things like proportion of share from the loot, how many trails the person leaves on the crime scene or if he/she betrays his/her associates when captured by the police.

Publication history  Like the rest of \\"Buck Danny,\\" Nuclear Alert was originally published in several (three) different novels before being made into a single album during the nineties. The three novels were Mission Apocalypse, Les Pilotes de l'Enfer (The Pilots from Hell), and Le Feu du Ciel (Fire From Heaven), in 1982, 1983 and 1985 respectively.  Plot  Mission Apocalypse = Most of the novel follows two separate plots, one for the protagonists and one for the villains. The former - Buck Danny, Jerry Tumbler and Sonny Tuckson - are now pilots on the USS John F. Kennedy and have recently transferred to flying F-14 Tomcats. The trio of pilots is temporarily reassigned from their training exercises in the Caribbean, to represent the United States at an air show in the fictional Central American nation of Managua. Meanwhile, Interpol and U.S. intelligence have been observing an increase in criminal actions throughout the world, which they believe are being committed by the same people. They are revealed to be an anti-capitalist terrorist organization, which steals three nuclear weapons from the U.S. Air Force during the novel and plans to use them to wipe out the upcoming North‚ÄìSouth Summit in Cancun, hosting all the major world leaders outside of the Eastern Bloc and China. The two plot lines are joined at the end of the novel, when the terrorists - having hired Lady X, the heroes' nemesis - succeed in stealing two of the three F-14s in Managua, which they intend to use as a delivery system for the bombs (the F-14 being the plane best capable of penetrating the security screens that will surround the conference). Danny is ordered to Washington to give his report of the events. = The Pilots from Hell = Following the events of the previous novel, the President of the United States (Ronald Reagan) is contacted by the terrorists. Identifying themselves as the International Federation of Armed Revolutionary Groups, they demand the release of all terrorists currently held in NATO countries, or they will deliver the F-14s and nuclear weapons to the Soviet Union. Instead, the President decides to stall for time while the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and other NATO services try to locate and neutralize the IFARG base. Danny, however, believes the terrorists' demand may be a feint and that the terrorists could be planning to actually use the weapons on a target in the Western Hemisphere. CIA is skeptical, but Admiral Walker allows Danny and Tuckson nine days of shore leave, during which they rent a private aircraft and systematically overfly the deserted islands in the Caribbean where the terrorists may have hidden the Tomcats. Meanwhile, there is dissension in the terrorists' ranks when one of their Mexican members, Juan, expresses his concern for collateral damage from the operation. In order to preserve cohesion within the group, the terrorists allow him to escape on a boobytrapped raft, thus Juan dies at sea far from the eyes of his friends. However, his body is found by Danny and Tuckson, who also find a message warning them of the IFARG's true plans. But one of the terrorist Tomcats appears and destroys their plane, along with all their communications equipment, leaving them stranded on a deserted cay and out of contact with the world. = Fire From Heaven = The novel opens with Danny and Tuckson being rescued from the cay by a Cuban Koni class frigate, which, made suspicious by the presence of American aviators in the area, takes them both prisoner. The Americans, in desperation, force a brig break and are rescued shortly thereafter by a helicopter from Guantanamo Naval Base. They are then put in touch with Admiral Walker of the Kennedy and report what they have learned. Walker orders them back to the ship and places it on nuclear alert, but the President is due to land in a few hours and the summit can no longer be called off. Reagan, once informed of the crisis, arranges for the media to delay news of his arrival by one hour; this allows the Kennedy to evacuate the leaders from Cancun, and to position its fighters to intercept the terrorist planes. When the IFARG, hiding in the Exuma islands, receive the delayed news of the President's arrival in Cancun, they launch the final phase of Operation Apocalypse, and release their F-14s carrying one nuclear bomb apiece. The F-14s approach Cancun by using Cuban airspace for cover, but are detected by an American AWACS. In reaction, they split up with one turning north to attack Cape Canaveral, and one continuing towards Cancun, forcing the Kennedy's fighters to split up. Danny and the squadron's F-14s shoot down the first aircraft over Florida. Tumbler, flying an A-7 Corsair, tries to intercept the second one near Cancun but his older missiles are insufficient; instead, he crashes his fighter into the enemy, barely managing to eject before the explosion. With Operation Apocalypse foiled, Lady X and the remaining terrorists evacuate their base and flee to safety. Danny, Tumbler and Tuckson receive the thanks of a grateful President Reagan, and will receive the Medal of Honor for their part in stopping the nuclear attack.

He is wounded during the terrorist attack in Managua and spends most of the second novel in sickbay. However, he is back on his feet by the time of Cancun and personally prevents the success of Operation Apocalypse. * Admiral Hal Walker: the admiral commanding the Kennedy battle group. Unwisely claims he will \\"eat his hat\\" if Danny's intuition about the terrorists attacking Cancun is correct; he is then forced to eat his words (and his uniform peaked cap) by the President at the end of \\"Fire From Heaven\\". * Lady X: Danny, Tumbler and Tuckson's nemesis, who is hired by the IFARG to plan the aerial component of Operation Apocalypse. Unlike the terrorists, she has no interest in worldwide revolution and only accepts their offer to avenge herself on Danny after their several previous encounters. * Von Grodtz: a German terrorist, who serves as chief of operations for the IFARG. * Juan: a South American member of the IFARG. His family lives in the Yucatan and would have been destroyed by the nuclear attack. This, along with his concern for \\"the Indians, the poor\\" and the other innocents living in the region, leads him to betray his colleagues; thanks to him, Danny and Tuckson discover their actual target. * Ghazi and Havanian: two Iranian F-14 pilots, formerly in the Shah's air force. Rescued from Ayatollah Khomeini's revolution by Lady X, they agree to fly the IFARG's Tomcats to settle their score with the United States, which they blame for abandoning them. * General Sanchez: the chief of staff of the Managuan Air Force, who dreams of overthrowing his government and ruling in its place. Von Grodtz, posing as a Western businessman, offers to fund his coup in exchange for his help stealing the Tomcats. * President Reagan: real-life 40th President of the United States. Charlier portrays him as a capable crisis-manager, willing to listen to subordinates and not afraid to take risks in his personal safety to bring the terrorists to justice (he is on the bridge of U.S.S. Kennedy throughout the IFARG Tomcats' attack). * O'Connor: Admiral Walker's dog, whose love-hate relationship with Sonny Tuckson serves as comic relief throughout the story.

The area was frequented by sportsmen and tourists, and the earliest settlers were hunting guides and boat builders. Long Lake was part of a water route that connected the Fulton Chain Lakes with the Saint Lawrence River drainage.

They are often associated with the spirits of ancestors in the Philippines.* They are also characterized as spirit sorts like sirens, dark beings, elves, and more. Belief in their existence has likely existed for centuries, and continues to this day.* It is a bracket term for enchanted human-like beings of the land which includes a variety of mythical races. The term itself was adopted from the Spanish, who were dumbfounded by the wide array of mythical races in the Philippines and just referred to many of the races as \\"enchanted\\".https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCA7P219NNY Though at the same time the term does not differ at all from the archaic Spanish sense of the word as referring to a supernatural apparition, sometimes tied to a place. Appearance Engkanto have many similarities to humans in that they age, appear to have male and female sexes, can suffer from illness and indeed even die. They are an object of mythology for many Filipinos, often told by adults as stories and shown on media. They have different appearances. Some appear to be beautiful having blue eyes, fair complexion and golden hair. They may however have unusual features such as high-bridged noses, fair skin, blond hair and lack of philtrum. They have a wide range of appearances but one common fact of a different feeling or vibe than humans. (Quezon City Press, 1990) Other variants exhibit sexual dimorphism such as Bagobo spirits which are separated into the female tahamaling and the male mahomanay. The female spirit is alleged to have red complexion while the male have a fair complexion. Their dwellings will normally appear as natural features, for example large rocks or trees, or shadows in human form; although to humans they have befriended they can appear as magnificent palaces. These creatures prefer large trees and nature such as the balete in which they also place their belongings. An engkanto may choose to stay by a human's side as told by stories where characters are usually in either a sense of trance or a deep loss of energy. Engkanto may be good or bad. Capabilities Engkanto are most commonly known for either extreme malignant effects, or an overwhelming influence of luck. Those the Engkanto do not favor had become depressed, suffered from madness, or even disappeared for days or months, possibly as a result of the human possession. They are also said to be capable of causing fevers and skin diseases such as boils. These spirits also sometimes lead travelers astray in the forest, even kidnap them. This, however, is said to be avoidable by bringing an \\"Anting-anting\\" or \\"Agimat\\" a piece of magical charm or amulet that wards away evil spirits and prevents them from harming the wielder. However, if they do favor someone they are generous and capable of bringing power and riches to that person. Shaman often try to commune with Engkanto on holy days to obtain better healing powers from them, as well as learning how to better deal with evil spirits. Study Francisco Demetrio made a study of 87 folk stories from Visayas and Mindanao relating to Engkanto. He contended the Engkanto were based on early European friars.

It is classified as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO within the \\"Cultural Landscape of Sintra\\". Along with the other palaces in the area such as the Quinta do Rel√≥gio, Pena, Monserrate and Seteais palaces, it is considered one of the principal tourist attractions of Sintra. The property consists of a Romantic palace and chapel, and a luxurious park that features lakes, grottoes, wells, benches, fountains, and a vast array of exquisite constructions. The palace is also known as \\"The Palace of Monteiro the Millionaire\\", which is based on the nickname of its best known former owner, Ant√≥nio Augusto Carvalho Monteiro. The palace was designed by the italian architect Luigi Manini. History D. Ermelinda Monteiro de Almeida, Viscountess of Regaleira. Luxuriant vegetation next to the lower gate. The land that is now Quinta da Regaleira had many owners over the years. It belonged to the Viscountess of Regaleira, a family of wealthy merchants from Porto, when it was sold in 1892 to Carvalho Monteiro for 25,000 r√©is. Monteiro was eager to build a bewildering place where he could collect symbols that reflected his interests and ideologies. With the assistance of the Italian architect Luigi Manini, he recreated the 4-hectare estate. In addition to other new features, he added enigmatic buildings that allegedly held symbols related to alchemy, Masonry, the Knights Templar, and the Rosicrucians. The architecture Manini designed evoked Roman, Gothic, Renaissance, and Manueline styles. The construction of the current estate commenced in 1904 and much of it was completed by 1910. The estate was later sold in 1942 to Waldemar d'Orey, who used it as private residence for his extensive family. He ordered repairs and restoration work for the property. In 1987, the estate was sold, once again, to the Japanese Aoki Corporation and ceased to serve as a residence. The corporation kept the estate closed to the public for ten years, until it was acquired by the Sintra Town Council in 1997. Extensive restoration efforts were promptly initiated throughout the estate. It finally opened to the public in June 1998 and began hosting cultural events. In August of that same year, the Portuguese Ministry of Culture classified the estate as \\"public interest property\\". Palace The Regaleira Palace () bears the same name as the entire estate. The structure's fa√ßade is characterised by exuberantly Gothic pinnacles, gargoyles, capitals, and an impressive octagonal tower. The palace contains five floors (a ground floor, three upper floors, and a basement). The ground floor consists of a series of hallways that all connect the living room, dining room, billiards room, balcony, some smaller rooms, and several stairways. In turn, the first upper floor contains bedrooms and a dressing room. The second upper floor contains Carvalho Monteiro's office, and the bedrooms of female servants. The third upper floor contains the ironing room and a smaller room with access to a terrace. Finally, the basement contains the male servants' bedrooms, the kitchen (which featured an elevator for lifting food to the ground floor), and storage rooms.

The Castle of the Moors and the Pena Palace are visible atop the hills. Chapel The Regaleira Chapel is a Roman Catholic Chapel, and stands in front of the palace's main fa√ßade. Its architecture is akin to the palace's. The interior of the chapel is richly decorated with frescoes, stained glass windows and lavish stuccoes. The frescoes contain representations of Teresa of √Åvila and Saint Anthony, as well as other religious depictions. Meanwhile, the floor itself offers depictions of the armillary sphere of the Portuguese discoveries and the Order of Christ Cross, surrounded by pentagrams. Despite its relatively small size, the chapel has several floors. Image:Palacio-da-Regaleira Capela1 Sintra Set-07.jpgThe main entrance.

The woods are neatly arranged in the lower parts of the estate, but are left wild and disorganised in the upper parts, reflecting Carvalho Monteiro's belief in primitivism. Decorative, symbolic, and lively structures can be found throughout the park. Image:Regaleira bridge.JPGGazebo on the ornate bridge over the lower gate.

The \\"Initiation Well\\" (see next section) connects to other tunnels via a series of underground walkways.

Image:Palacio-da-Regaleira Gruta-da-Leda Sintra Set-07.jpgLeda's Cave. =Initiation Wells= The Initiation Wells (also called initiatic wells or inverted towers) are two wells on the property that better resemble underground towers lined with stairs. These wells never served as water sources. Instead, they were used for ceremonial purposes that included Tarot initiation rites. The tunnels described above connect these wells to one another, in addition to various caves and other monuments located around the park. Of the two wells, the larger one contains a 27-metre spiral staircase with several small landings. The spacing of these landings, combined with the number of steps in the stairs, are linked to Tarot mysticism. Other references may be to Freemasonry, Rosicrucianism or Knights Templar rituals. The smaller well contains straight stairs that connect a series of ring-shaped floors to one another. This well is also called the 'Unfinished Well'.

Image:Rain in the Initiation Well.jpgRain down the Initiation well. =Lakes, fountains, and the aquarium= Bodies of water can be found in several places in the park. Two artificial lakes and several fountains were added by Monteiro. One of the most interesting and extravagant among them is the Aquarium, built as if it were naturally embedded in a large boulder. It was once considered the most important naturalist property in Regaleira. However, the Aquarium is no longer used and is poorly maintained. File:Regaleira Ibis Fountain.JPGThe Ibis Fountain.

Additionally Simonis is a railway station operated by NMBS/SNCB and a tram stop. The station complex is situated at the end of Boulevard L√©opold II and is close to the Basilica of the Sacred Heart. Simonis was named after Place Eug√®ne Simonis/Eug√®ne Simonisplein, which in turn is named after the Belgian sculptor Eug√®ne Simonis; while the nearby Elisabeth Park, named after Elisabeth of Bavaria, Queen of Belgium, gives Elisabeth its name. Simonis metro station opened on 6 October 1982 and is a through station in north-south direction situated in a cutting next to a railway line. It is served as a through station on line 6 and is a terminus of line 2. Elisabeth metro station is orthogonal to and one level below Simonis and is a terminal station located at the end of Boulevard L√©opold II in east-west direction. It opened on 2 October 1988 and is the terminus for lines 2 and 6. Between its opening in 1988 and 2013, Elisabeth was also known as Simonis. Until 2009, Simonis was a simple interchange station between metro lines 1A and 2. When the Brussels metro loop opened in 2009, the north-western part of metro line 1A was connected to the other end of metro line 2, making line 2 an imperfect circle line (since a true circular train service is not possible, as the tracks at Simonis/Elisabeth are not connected). This resulted in the current situation, whereby the station complex is served twice by lines 2 and 6. To differentiate between the two station parts, the north-south through platforms were given the name Simonis (Leopold II), while the east-west terminating platforms were known as Simonis (Elisabeth). However, this did not improve the clarity of passenger information and thus, on 3 November 2013, Simonis (Leopold II) was reverted to simply Simonis, while Simonis (Elisabeth) became Elisabeth. The adjacent bus, tram and railway stops have not been renamed, and are all still known as Simonis. Simonis railway station To the west of the stations, trams 9 and 19 call at underground platforms opened on 23 June 1986 (line 19) and 1 September 2018 (line 9), respectively. To the east of and parallel to Simonis metro station, the National Railway Company of Belgium operates a local commuter station Simonis since December 2009. It is served by the Brussels Regional Express Network service S10 between Dendermonde, Brussels, Denderleeuw and Aalst.

Allan Dwan also wrote the screenplay, based on a story by George Cooper. The film is now considered lost. Plot A moonshiner named George Tate is a good-hearted man, even though he is a criminal. A half-breed (Chaney) murders George's father and later harasses his sister Amy. The half-breed then tells government agents of the location of the moonshiner's hideout in the wilderness, and the authorities attack the place while George, Amy and Amy's lover Neut Haigh happen to be staying there. In the heat of the gunfight, George gallantly allows Neut and Amy to escape through a secret trap door in the cabin while he stays behind to fight the officers, a gesture that costs George his life.

The film's working title was originally The Web of Circumstance. The film is now considered to be lost. Plot Fulfilling a promise made to his mother on her deathbed, Dr. James Gibson locates his sister Pauline who has run away after giving birth to an illegitimate child. His sister has lost her sanity, and Gibson takes her and his baby niece home with him. The years pass and the niece grows into a beautiful young woman while her mother is kept locked in a room that the niece is forbidden to enter. Gibson and his wealthy neighbor, John Morris (Chaney), are both interested in hypnotism, and one night the two men conduct an experiment by hypnotizing Gibson's niece. Pauline sees Morris from her window and recognizes him as the man who fathered her child and then deserted her. One night she escapes from her room, wearing her daughter's shawl, and stabs Morris to death. Returning home, she touches her daughter's hair, placing bloodstains on the sleeping girl. Morris is found murdered, the young girl's shawl is found near his body, and his blood is found on the still sleeping girl. The niece is arrested and charged with murder, but Pauline is later found dead in her room, clutching a watch that was stolen from Morris, and the young girl is acquitted.

The Zoological Society of London, 1985. . Chi Chi was not London Zoo's first giant panda; Ming was one of four that arrived in 1938. However, it was Chi Chi who became the Zoo's star attraction and England's best-loved zoo animal. Chi Chi is now a stuffed exhibit at the Natural History Museum in London. Life She was caught in May 1955 in Baoxing, Sichuan, and moved to the Beijing Zoo in June. In May 1957, Kliment Voroshilov made a request for a panda for the Moscow Zoo during his visit to China, and she was sent to Moscow with another panda in the same month. However, the attempts to mate them were unsuccessful due to sexual imprinting as a result of being reared by human keepers.Nicholls, Henry (2011). The Way of the Panda: The Curious History of China's Political Animal. Open Road Media, Dobbin, Muriel (24 April 1975). D.C. zoo encourages giant pandas to observe nation's birth with own. The Baltimore Sun The Russians suspected that both pandas were male, and as a result, the Soviets returned Chi Chi to China in exchange for another panda in January 1958. In May of the same year, the Austrian animal broker, Heini Demmer, acquired Chi Chi from Beijing Zoo in exchange for an impressive collection of African hoofstock and brought the animal back to Moscow Zoo. After resting for a week, the panda journeyed to Tierpark Berlin, the zoo in East Berlin. By then, Chi Chi had already been sold to Brookfield Zoo in Illinois, United States. However, the Treasury Department stepped in and announced that the US trade embargo on goods from China extended even to pandas. Chi Chi was thus refused entry to the US. The Frankfurt Zoological Garden provided a temporary home for the panda until Demmer decided to temporarily hire the animal out to European zoos. She then visited Copenhagen Zoo before she arrived at London Zoo on 5 September 1958. The Zoological Society of London had stated that it would not encourage collection of wild pandas, but accepted Chi Chi since she had already been collected. Although Chi Chi's visit was originally planned to last for only three weeks, it was decided to buy her for ¬£12,000. Chi Chi became property of London Zoo on 26 September 1958.Ramona Morris & Desmond Morris: The Giant Panda. Revised edition by Jonathan Barzdo. Papermac, London 1981, pp. 93‚Äì111, Around this time, photographer Stanley Long created a series of stereoscopic 3D views of Chi Chi for the VistaScreen publishing company. An elderly gentleman responded to a call for new sources of bamboo. He lived in a cottage on the edge of Menabilly Woods, on the Menabilly Estate in Cornwall. 'The Captain' as the man was respectfully known by the locals, cut down a sample of the bamboo from the dense thickets growing around his cottage and sent it up to London. Chi Chi ate some of it and the ZSL engaged the Captain to provide a regular supply. The Captain enlisted the help of the local Scout group and a handful of scouts soon became the official bamboo suppliers to Chi Chi. The boys would take it to the house of Mike Kerris, the scout leader, after they had cut it on Sundays. Then, first thing on Monday morning, he would load it up and take the bamboo to Par railway station, where it was weighed and then put on a train to London Zoo. The Polkerris Scouts sent bamboo to Chi Chi until she died in 1972.The Way of the Panda: The Curious History of China's Political Animal by Henry Nicholls Polkerris Scout Group were awarded a badge of Chi Chi Panda, which is worn on their scarf. Then in 1974 the Prime Minister Edward Heath brought two new pandas from China Ching-Ching (female) and Chia-Chia (male) so the scouts started cutting the bamboo again to send to the zoo. Chi Chi was an inspiration for Sir Peter Scott's simple but distinctive black and white design used as the logo of the World Wildlife Fund.WWF: Giant Panda However the organization's current logo is not the logo designed by Peter Scott but a later one, designed for WWF in 1986 when it changed its name from World Wildlife Fund to World Wide Fund for Nature.

In 1985 the entire hamlet, including 31 properties, was listed as a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places. Of these properties two were vacant land, 14 were significant buildings, ten were contributing buildings, and five buildings, built in the 1950s, were non-contributing. The Lukens Pierce House, an octagon house listed separately on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places, is located about half a mile northwest of the hamlet. Ercildoun is one of about ten hamlets in the township, which has no cities or towns, but has 31 sites listed on the National Register. It is one of the larger hamlets, located near the center of the township, and historically among the best known. The city of Coatesville is about 3 miles north. The name \\"Ercildoun\\" was taken from the poem, \\"Thomas the Rhymer\\" by Sir Walter Scott when the hamlet's post office opened in 1850, but it was misspelled \\"Ercildown\\" until 1854. The main character in the poem was Thomas of Ercildoun, from Ercildoune, Scotland.Jane L.S. Davidson, Ercildoun Historic District NRHP Nomination, 1985 History People's Hall One old building still stands As a tribute to voices now stilled It stands as a monument to Old \\"Friends\\" Who dared to do right.by Isabella Stokes, resident of Ercildoun and daughter of former slave Samuel Roth, 1974, reprinted in NRHP nomination form Land in the current hamlet was first settled by Quaker farmers in the final years of the eighteenth century. In 1811 the current Fallowfields Friends Meeting House was built, which, with the adjoining cemetery, People's Hall, and the former post office - now a grocery store, forms the center of town. Arising from Quaker beliefs, the abolitionist East Fallowfield Anti-Slavery Society was formed in 1835 with James Fulton Jr. as the recording secretary, and 33 other members. Fulton became active as an officer of the county and state anti- slavery societies and attended national meetings on abolition. In its first annual report the Society stated that they had distributed 3,000 books and tracts and gathered signatures petitioning Congress to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia and the territories. The Anti-Slavery Society met in the Fallowfield Meetinghouse until the winter of 1844, when Abby Kelley and Charles Burleigh spoke at a meeting that was broken up by a mob of anti- abolitionists. About this time abolitionist halls were burned down in Philadelphia and Lancaster, both less than 40 miles away. The Quaker Meeting membership then banned the Anti-Slavery group from its meetinghouse. In 1845 an association of abolitionists purchased the land and built a hall next to the Meetinghouse, which they called the Free Hall and later the People's Hall. The group declared that \\"every question, creed, or race was welcome on our platform,\\" and above the platform was the motto \\"Let Truth and Error grapple.\\" According to resident Gertrude W. Nields, one Quaker who had been supporting the group, withdrew his support on seeing the motto, considering it \\"inconsistent in Friends to grapple with anything - even error.\\"Fallowfield Friends Meeting House, 1811-1911, One Hundredth Anniversary, Ercildoun, Pennsylvania Ercildoun became known as center of the Underground Railroad with groups as large as 33 escaped slaves passing through town. Ercildoun's location about 15 miles north of the slave state of Maryland contributed to this activity, and the hamlet fed both the northern and southern Pennsylvania branches of the Underground Railroad both before and during the Civil War. Gideon Pierce and James Fulton, Jr. were among the best known local conductors of the Underground Railroad. Escaped slave Jacob Carter and his brothers Joseph and Richard passed through during their escape. Jacob later bought land and began his ministry in the hamlet. After the Civil War, former slaves settled in the hamlet and People's Hall served as a grange, church, library, town hall and housed the Fallowfield Historical Society. Over the years the hall suffered from deferred maintenance and in 2015 it was named to Preservation Pennsylvania's list of endangered historic sites. The hall is managed by a Board of Trustees, but historically the trustee positions were inherited, the number of active trustees decreased and resources for upkeep dwindled. The board has been reconstituted, is organizing fund raising, and is starting to restore the People's Hall. Gideon Pierce built a store on across from the Friends Meeting House in 1818. The Webster family bought the store in 1863 and operated it until 1987. The store still stands and remains active today as Triple Fresh Market. The name \\"Ercildoun\\" was first used by Pierce when his store housed the village's post office in 1850. The July 1877 \\"Ercildoun Tornado\\" was so violent that it was the subject of a lecture at the French Academy of Sciences in 1878. Fourteen buildings were destroyed. In 1894 an African-American congregation built the Christ Disciple Church.

She lives in North London. She is a two-time winner and four-time runner up for the annual Kate Greenaway Medal, the British librarians' award for illustration. For the 50th anniversary of that Medal (1955‚Äì2005) her 1999 illustrated edition of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was named one of the top ten winning works. Background Helen Oxenbury was raised in Ipswich, Suffolk. Her father was an architect. From an early age she developed a passion for drawing. After leaving school, she attended the Ipswich School of Art as a teenager, and during holidays she worked at a small theatre in Felixstowe and at the Ipswich Repertory Theatre Workshop, mixing paints.Interview with Helen Oxenbury at BooksforKeeps . She went on to study in London at the Central School of Art and Design (1957-1959), where she met her future husband, John Burningham. In her adult life she embarked on a career in theatre, film and television. She worked as assistant designer at Colchester Repertory Theatre, and for three years as painter and designer for the Habima Theatre in Tel Aviv, Israel. In 1962 she returned to Britain and did some design work for ABC Television and Shepperton Film Studios. After marrying the children's book illustrator John Burningham in 1964, she turned to illustrating children‚Äôs books herself. In 1980, she created a series of books about a mischievous young boy called Tom, and his stuffed monkey, Pippo. She commented that Tom was very much like her own son in his younger years. Like Tom, her son would often blame his misdeeds on an accomplice (the family dog).Oxenbury's 'Tom and Pippo' book range. LibraryPoint.org. She continues to illustrate books. In 1994, Tom and Pippo was adapted into a French animated series which ran for 2-minute 104 episodes. Some of her most recent work includes the illustrations for \\"The Growing Story\\" in the September 2008 edition of Bayard Presse's StoryBox magazine. Awards Oxenbury is one of fourteen illustrators to win two Kate Greenaway Medals (established 1955); Burningham is another. At the time, the annual award by the British Library Association recognised the year's best children's book illustration by a British subject; two books were occasionally cited; there was no cash prize. Oxenbury won the Medal in 1969; the two books cited were The Quangle Wangle's Hat, an edition of Edward Lear's 19th-century poem, and The Dragon of an Ordinary Family, a new story by Margaret Mahy, both published by Heinemann. From 1989 to 1994 she was the Highly Commended runner up four times and she won again for an edition of Alice in Wonderland (Walker, 1999). CILIP's retrospective citation says, \\"More abundantly illustrated than previous editions ... Alice herself is a child of today ‚Äì casually dressed, personable and spirited.\\" Alice was named one of the top ten Greenaway Medal-winning works by a 2007 panel, composing the ballot for a public election of the all- time favourite. Oxenbury won two \\"Emils\\", the Kurt Maschler Award by the Maschler publishers and Booktrust that annually (1982 to 1999) recognised one \\"work of imagination for children, in which text and illustration are integrated so that each enhances and balances the other.\\" The first was for So Much by Trish Cooke, one of her Greenaway runners up, and the second for Alice. Oxenbury also won three Nestl√© Smarties Book Prizes (1985 to 2007), all in the 0‚Äì5 years category. The Smarties Prize winners were elected by children from shortlists composed by a panel. Oxenbury-illustrated picture books were the overall winners for 1989, We're Going on a Bear Hunt retold by Michael Rosen, and for 1991, Farmer Duck by Martin Waddell, another Greenaway runner up. So Much was the 1994 age group winner. Farmer Duck was also the 1991 Illustrated Children's Book of the Year (British Book Awards). Tickle, Tickle, written and illustrated by Oxenbury, won the 1999 Booktrust Early Years Award. In the United States, Big Momma Makes the World by Phillis Root won the Boston Globe‚ÄìHorn Book Award, picture books category.  Selected works  These are all children's books. WorldCat reports that Oxenbury's works most widely held in participating libraries are three of her Greenaway Medal runners up, all written by other authors: We're Going on a Bear Hunt (1989), Three Little Wolves and the Big Bad Pig (1993), and Farmer Duck (1991). \\"Oxenbury, Helen\\".

While it continues to enjoy success as a bar and line dance venue, it has become a successful concert venue in recent years for all genres of music. Because of its downtown location, open bar, large atrium, and permanent stage, the Wildhorse is also often used as a formal banquet hall. The Wildhorse consists of three levels. The top two levels overlook the dance floor and stage. In media The Wildhorse once housed a full-service radio studio, formerly used by WSM-FM when the station was also under Gaylord ownership. It featured large windows and multiple sets of headphones hung outside so anyone could watch and listen to was going on in the studio. Nationally syndicated radio personality Rich Miller (Power Country with Rich Miller) once hosted a popular 7-midnight live show in the studio. Top Country stars and other celebrities would often stop by the studio and visit on air with Rich. During this time Locash singer Chris Lucas was the house DJ. Chris and Rich co-hoisted a very popular singing contest called \\"Sing To Win\\" which often saw long lines of singers down 2nd avenue. Nightly broadcasting from the studio ended when a freak lightning strike took out the main console. The room was later converted into a small video arcade, and was removed completely during the latest renovation (2016). The venue formerly hosted the Wildhorse Saloon Dance Show on The Nashville Network hosted by Katie Haas in the mid-1990s. It also served as an audition site for the second season of American Idol. More recently, it has served as home of the Idol spin-off Can You Duet on CMT.

The metro station opened on 6 October 1982 as part of the Beekkant‚ÄìSaint Guidon/Sint-Guido extension of former line 1B. Following the reorganisation of the Brussels metro on 4 April 2009, it is served by lines 1, 2, 5 and 6. History The train station was initially opened in 1872 on the western orbital railroad of Brussels, line 28. It used to be an extensive goods yard, with the station building located close to the current location of Beekkant metro station. After the closure of the goods yard, the platforms were moved south. The train station was closed for passengers in 1984, but reopened in December 2009 in the framework of the Brussels Regional Express Network (RER/GEN) project. From 6 October 1982, the station was also served by the former line 1B of the Brussels metro. With the completion of the loop of the line 2 and the reorganisation of the Brussels metro network in April 2009, all Brussels metro lines (1, 2, 5 and 6) now serve the station. The station also connects with tram and bus lines, and the new Jacques Brel bus and metro depot has been built nearby. Current services Since its rebuilding in 2009, the West Station is becoming a major multimodal transport hub in western Brussels which will gain importance in the framework of the Brussels RER/GEN development. =National Rail (SNCB/NMBS)= The station is served by the following service(s): *Brussels RER/GEN services (S10) Dendermonde - Brussels - Denderleeuw - Aalst =Brussels metro (STIB/MIVB)= On the metro network, the station is called Gare de l'Ouest in French and Weststation in Dutch.

He translated a number of classic French and English poetry and drama works into Slovene, including Shakespeare's sonnets. Biography Menart was born in Maribor. His mother was a theatre actress. She soon fell ill, so the family moved back to Ljubljana. His father worked as an emergency medical technician and committed suicide when Janez was seven years old. His mother died eight years later. Due to poor social circumstances Janez and his older sister lived almost from the beginning of schooling in the boarding schools. Janez was able to enter grammar school only because he won one of the four scholarships offered by Drava Banovina in 1940. Having finished it he attended the Faculty of Philosophy at the University of Ljubljana where he graduated in Slovene philology and in comparative literature studies. After compulsory military service he was at first a publisher's reader, then a stage director and finally a director of puppet section at Triglav film. In that time he also married and got a daughter. Since 1963, when he left film, he earned his money by writing and translation. Then he employed himself as the editor of drama editorial board at RTV Ljubljana. Due to political circumstances he was later degraded to a stage director and in the final three years he worked as a translator for current needs. In 1979 he decided to leave his job and employ himself as a programme leader of the book sales club Svet knjige at Mladinska knjiga. He stayed there till his retirement in 1990. He died in Ljubljana due to a hospital infection. Work Janez Menart was one of the most popular Slovene poets in the second half of the 20th century. Over four hundred of his individuals poems have been translated to about 25 foreign languages and over half of these translations were published in independent editions. Over one hundred of his poems and chanson lyrics have been set to music, some of them have also been recorded on cassettes and discs. Menart began seriously writing songs when he was 15 and had first of them published in the last two years of attending grammar school. He gradually published them in a continuously larger number of literary journals and by radio. His career of a prominent literate began in 1953 when he published the collection Poems of the Four () in collaboration with Kajetan Koviƒç, Tone Pavƒçek and Ciril Zlobec. His poetry is traditionally confessional, the narration realistic and satirical while the form rests on traditional meter with romantic images and everyday reality. Also well known are his epigrams. Menart complemented original poetry by translating foreign language literature. Slovenes have to thank him for, among others, the excellent translations of Shakespeare's Sonnets, Byron's, Burns's and Pr√©vert's poetry and Villon's Collected Works. He also translated English Renaissance plays such as Volpone by Jonson and Doctor Faustus by Christopher Marlowe. Although mainly known as a poet and translator, Menart also wrote scripts for puppet and documentary films and television plays. He was also the first in Slovenia to publish a CD audiobook, with his poems largely interpreted by him himself. In music In 1975, his poem \\"Homeland\\" (), translated by the Croatian poet Zvonimir Golob, was used as lyrics for the song \\"Domovina\\" sung by the Croatian rock and folk musician Drago Mlinarec.

In 1892, he was appointed Chevalier (Knight) of the L√©gion d'Honneur and in 1900 he was appointed an Officier (Officer) of the L√©gion d'Honneur. Parisian newspapers used sporting events as circulation aids, and Giffard created the Paris‚ÄìBrest‚ÄìParis cycle race in 1891, the 380 kilometre Paris‚ÄìBelfort running race in 1892, the world's first car race from Paris to Rouen in 1894, the Paris marathon in 1896, and a foot-race from Bordeaux to Paris in 1903. Giffard served as the editor of Le Petit Journal and then the sports daily Le V√©lo, where his passionate support for Alfred Dreyfus and thus his opposition to the car-maker Comte Jules-Albert de Dion over the whole Dreyfus affair led de Dion to create a rival daily, L'Auto, which in turn created the Tour de France cycle race. Early life Pierre Giffard's father was a lawyer and mayor in Fontaine-le-Dun. Pierre was taught from the age of six by Father Biville at Saint-Laurent-en-Caux and from eight at the Lyc√©e Pierre Corneille in Rouen. He completed his schooling in Paris, at the Lyc√©e Charlemagne in the Marais district. It was there that he developed his republican ideas. The Franco-Prussian War started in 1870 and Giffard enrolled in the army, with his parents' reluctant permission, at Fontaine-le-Dun in Normandy. He joined the reserve army in November at Le Havre. There, following the custom of the time, he was made an officer. He became a lieutenant on 10 December 1870. At the end of the war he resumed his studies at Douai, where he gained a university degree in August 1871. Giffard's father died on 1 August 1872, and Giffard moved to Paris to work as a journalist. Journalism Giffard had a long and successful career in journalism. Between 1873 and 1878 he worked for Le Corsaire, L'Ev√©nement, La France, Le Gaulois, Le Petit Parisien, La Lanterne and finally Le Figaro. He then assumed editorship of Le Petit Journal in 1887 and of the sports daily Le V√©lo in 1896. After an abortive election attempt in 1900 Giffard returned to full-time journalism at Le V√©lo until its demise in 1904. He then joined Matin, which sent him to the Far East to cover the Russia-Japan war. He returned to Paris in July 1904, weakened by illness, and proceeded to work for several papers, including D√©p√™che Coloniale and Petit Marseillais. In June 1906, now one of the senior journalists of France, he went back to Le Figaro and reported the first meeting of the Russian parliament. In 1910 Giffard was employed by his arch- rival Henri Desgrange writing for L'Auto until retirement. =Le Figaro= Giffard joined Le Figaro on the strength of his reports of the World Exhibition in Paris and of conferences he organised there concerning the invention of the telephone and telegraph. He reported from Switzerland, Belgium, Germany, Italy, Greece, Austria, Scotland, Algeria, Tunisia, Malta, Cyprus, Spain, the Netherlands and Denmark. He reported on the attack by French troops on Cheikh Bouamama :fr:Cheikh Bouamama in Algeria and the taking of Sfax in Tunisia, and the arrival of the British fleet at Alexandria and the departure of the French navy. In June 1906, he went back to Le Figaro and reported the first meeting of the Russian parliament, the Douma. Le Petit Journal by Konstantin Stoitzner. 10 October 1891. The suicide of Georges Boulanger in Ixelles Cemetery. =Le Petit Journal= Hippolyte Auguste Marinoni asked Giffard to reorganise the newsroom of the daily paper, Le Petit Journal. He began work on 1 October 1887. There he started a diary which, in the tradition of the paper, he signed with a pseudonym: Jean-sans-Terre. He stayed at the paper for 10 years. In 1891 he organised the Paris‚ÄìBrest‚ÄìParis bicycle race for the newspaper, followed by the Paris‚ÄìBelfort running race. In 1892, he was appointed a member of the L√©gion d'Honneur, and in 1900 he was appointed as an officer. =Le V√©lo= In 1896, he joined his colleague Paul Rousseau at the head of the newspaper, Le V√©lo, where he wrote under the name Arator. There on 19 July 1896 he organised the first Paris marathon and helped found the Automobile Club de France. In 1900 he threw the paper in support of Alfred Dreyfus in the Dreyfus affair. France was divided over the justice of his trial for selling military secrets to the Germans. The paper's largest advertisers, anti-Dreyfusards such as Count Jules-Albert de Dion, Adolphe Cl√©ment and √âdouard Michelin believed Dreyfus guilty and removed their advertising from the paper. They then launched a rival paper, at first called L'Auto-V√©lo and then simply L'Auto. A circulation war broke out between the two papers. Le V√©lo's biggest publicity stunts included staging a second edition of the Paris‚ÄìBrest‚ÄìParis cycle-race in 1901, that he had created in 1891. L'Auto's response came on 19 December 1902, when G√©o Lef√®vre suggested a Tour de France which was an overwhelming circulation success in 1903. Le V√©lo's response in 1903 was a running-race from Bordeaux to Paris, but it was too late. Le V√©lo disappeared in 1904 and Giffard eventually joined Desgrange's staff at L'Auto. Events organiser Special 'Paris‚ÄìBelfort' edition of Le Petit Journal from 18 June 1892 =Paris‚ÄìBrest‚ÄìParis cycle race= Giffard created the Paris‚ÄìBrest‚ÄìParis cycle race in 1891, although it was promoted as Paris‚ÄìBrest et retour in his editorials which he signed \\"Jean- sans-Terre\\". It is now established as the oldest long-distance cycling road event. Le Petit Journal described it as an \\"√©preuve,\\" a test of the bicycle's reliability and the rider's endurance. Riders were fully self-sufficient, carrying their own food and clothing and riding the same bicycle for the duration. The public response to his articles was so phenomenal that he had to change the rules and start charging 5 francs entrance, as 300 riders including 7 women signed up, although the women were later refused entrance. Each bicycle was given an 'official seal' at a two-day ceremony in front of the offices of Le Petit Journal. The 280 sealed machines included 10 tricycles, 2 Tandem bicycles, and 1 Penny-farthing. Participation was restricted to Frenchmen and 99 of the 207 (or 280) participants finished. Michelin's Charles Terront won in 71 hours 22 minutes after passing Dunlop's Jiel-Laval as he slept during the third night. Both had suffered punctures in their pneumatic tyres, but still enjoyed an advantage over riders on solid tires. The first race was a coup for Le Petit Journal and the organisers decided to run it every ten years. The second race in 1901 was again organised by Giffard but on behalf of Le V√©lo. =Paris‚ÄìBelfort running race= On 5 June 1892, Giffard organised a foot-race from Paris to Belfort, a course of over 380 kilometers, the first large scale long distance running race on record. Over 1,100 competitors registered for the event and over 800 started from the offices of Le Petit Journal, at Paris Opera. This had also been the start point for the inaugural Paris‚ÄìBrest‚ÄìParis cycle-race the previous year. Newspaper circulation dramatically increased as the French public followed the progress of race participants, 380 of whom completed the course in under 10 days. In Le Petit Journal on 18 June 1892, Giffard praised the event as a model for the physical training of a nation faced by hostile neighbours. The event was won by Constant Ramoge in 100 hours 5 minutes. =Paris‚ÄìRouen, world's first motorcar race= Georges Lema√Ætre classified 1st in his Peugeot 3hp In 1894, when Giffard was editor in chief of newspaper Le Petit Journal, he organised what is considered to be the world's first car race from Paris to Rouen, sporting events were a tried and tested form of publicity stunt and circulation booster. The paper promoted it as a Competition for Horeseless Carriages (Concours des Voitures sans Chevaux) that were not dangerous, easy to drive, and cheap during the journey. Thus it blurred the distinctions between a reliability trial, a general event and a race, but the main prize was for the first across the finish line in Rouen. 102 people paid the 10 franc entrance fee. On 22 July 1894, 69 cars started the 50 km selection event that would show which entrants would be allowed to start the main event, the 127 km race from Paris to Rouen. The entrants ranged from serious manufacturers like Peugeot, Panhard or De Dion to amateur owners, and only 25 were selected for the main race. The race started from Porte Maillot and went through the Bois de Boulogne. Count Jules-Albert de Dion was first into Rouen after 6 hours and 48 minutes at an average speed of 19 km/h. He finished 3‚Äô30\\" ahead of Albert Lema√Ætre (Peugeot), followed by Doriot (Peugeot) at 16‚Äô30\\", Ren√© Panhard (Panhard) at 33‚Äô30‚Äô‚Äô and √âmile Levassor (Panhard) at 55‚Äô30‚Äù. The official winners were Peugeot and Panhard as cars were judged on their speed, handling and safety characteristics, and De Dion's steam car needed a stoker which was forbidden. =Paris Marathon= On 18 July 1896 Giffard organised the inaugural Paris Marathon on behalf of Le Petit Journal, although he was editor of Le V√©lo, suggesting a cooperative commercial relationship. The event followed on from the success of the marathon in the 1896 inaugural Olympics. Gifford started the race before a large crowd at the Porte Maillot, and it followed a course to Versailles and finished in Conflans-Sainte-Honorine. The race and the 200-franc prize were won by Len Hurst, a 24-year-old brick maker from England. =Bordeaux‚ÄìParis foot race= Giffard organised the first foot- race from Bordeaux to Paris in 1903, which was won by Francois Peguet in 114 hours 22 minutes 20 seconds with Emil Anthoine in second place. Books Title illustration for La Reine Bicyclette published in 1891 =La Reine Bicyclette= The phrase \\"la petite reine\\" has passed into the French language as a term for a bicycle. The origins are in 1891, when Giffard wrote a history of bicycle development, La Reine Bicyclette. The expression was made more emblematic by the picture on the cover, of a young woman wearing a modern bicycle as a crown. The title was intended to describe the spirit that the bicycle had brought to her life. Cycling enthusiasts adopted the name, calling their machine \\"la petite reine\\". La Guerre Infernale, Episode 2, January 1908 =Le Sieur de Va-Partout= Le Sieur de Va-Partout was the first French book in a new style, the literature of reporting, and therefore of a new type of author: the writer-reporter. =La Fin du Cheval= La Fin du Cheval was Giffard's 1899 humorous thesis on the inevitable replacement of the horse by the bicycle, then by the car. It was illustrated by Albert Robida. =La Guerre Infernale= La Guerre Infernale was an adventure novel for children, published as a serial, an edition appearing every Saturday. The 520 illustrations were created by Albert Robida. It described a world war, years before it happened, describing an attack on London by the Germans and war between Japan and the United States. It was subsequently republished as a book. Politics Bust of Pierre Giffard Giffard stood in the national election of March 1900, a candidate in the 2nd constituency of Seine- Inf√©rieure (Yvetot). A passionate left wing Dreyfussard, he failed due to the general Dreyfusine rift in French politics, and he was a victim of de Dion's sometimes violent anti-Dreyfussard stance. De Dion had distributed free copies of Giffard's humorous book La Fin du Cheval, claiming it to be Giffard's political program. Death, honours and commemoration In 1892, Giffard was appointed 'Chevalier' (Knight) of the L√©gion d'Honneur and in September 1900, at the Paris Exposition, he was appointed an 'Officier' (Officer) of the L√©gion d'Honneur.\\"The Bicycling world and motorcycle review\\", September 1900, Paris Exposition Honours He died on 21 January 1922 at his home in Maisons- Laffitte where he had lived since 1883. The rue de Pierre Giffard in the Paris suburb of Saint-Denis is named in his honour.

Publication history Black Beetle first appeared in Booster Gold vol. 2 #5, (December 2007) and was created by Geoff Johns, Jeff Katz, Dan Jurgens, Norm Rapmund, Matthew Sturges and Carlo Barberi. He was featured in the Blue Beetle backup stories in Booster Gold and in the Booster Gold stories themselves. Regarding the development and utilization of the character, creator Matthew Sturges commented: Fictional character biography Originally posing as a Blue Beetle from the future, the Black Beetle appears to Booster Gold in a time sphere, and offers him a chance to go back in time and save his best friend Ted Kord from death at the hands of Maxwell Lord, despite Rip Hunter's claims that Ted's death was a point of unalterable \\"solidified\\" time. Booster agrees to go with Black Beetle, who has also recruited the first Blue Beetle (Dan Garrett), and current Beetle (Jaime Reyes) for the mission. The group is successful in saving Ted. Upon their return to the present, however, they learn that the timeline has been altered, and that Max and his OMACs are policing the whole world.Booster Gold (vol. 2) #6 (March 2008) When Booster and Beetle, gathering some of their old Justice League International teammates, attempt to fix the timeline, they are attacked by Black Beetle, who reveals his affiliation with the Time Stealers, a group consisting of Despero, Per Degaton, the Ultra-Humanite, and Booster's father (the latter under the control of Mr. Mind). As the battle rages, Ted realizes that the only way to fix things is to return to the past and allow himself to be murdered. Black Beetle attempts to stop him, revealing that he is \\"Jaime Reyes' greatest enemy\\", and that Jaime took away someone very close to him.

It is revealed that Hector has bonded with Reach technology taken from the invaders, potentially granting him the same powers as Jaime, and that he has taken the alias \\"Joshua\\" based on \\"Djo Zha\\" the previous owner of his scarab, and a member of the KDRA. Joshua is the name used by the Black Beetle in his earliest appearances.Blue Beetle (vol. 2) #36 (April 2009) The use of Hector is intended to cause speculation regarding the Black Beetle character, as future storylines evolve regarding the character. When Black Beetle finally confronts Jamie, he claims that he is indeed Hector, blaming Jamie for Nadia's death, but instantly retracts this statement, instead stating that he in fact killed Hector and stole his technology.Booster Gold (vol. 2) #24 (September 2009) In the following issue, he claims to be Jaime's future self, driven mad after being attacked by a brain-damaged Milagro.Booster Gold (vol. 2) #25 (October 2009) =Current status= The Black Beetle returns in the present day, attacking Booster and the new Batman, Dick Grayson, in the Batcave. After a brief altercation, Black Beetle escapes into the past, changing events in a way that causes Dick to die during his days as Robin.Booster Gold (vol. 2) #21 (August 2009) Booster follows the Black Beetle into the past, finding that he has allied himself with Grant Wilson, attempting to change the outcome of his disastrous battle with the Teen Titans.Booster Gold (vol. 2) #22 (July 2009) He is also shown working with an unknown person who desires the destruction of the Justice League (later revealed to be T.O. Morrow). He briefly appears in the present, revealing himself to Jaime and absconding with the body of a gynoid the hero had just defeated.Booster Gold (vol. 2) #23 (August 2009) Black Beetle is then shown in a new future he created by killing the Teen Titans where Raven's father Trigon is able to take over the world in the absence of both the Titans and Batman. It is then shown that his true purpose for creating this future is to use the distraction of Booster, Rip Hunter, and the resistance attacking to steal a Red Scarab from Trigon's trophy room. He claims the Red Scarab is more powerful than his own and bonds it to himself in addition to his current tech. Rip manages to track Black Beetle to his base, using one of his devices to overload the armor with chronal energy, seemingly destroying the Black Beetle. He is also shown in the present in El Paso, attempting to take Jamie's Blue Scarab. Jaime manages to stop him by blasting him with tachyon particles, paralyzing him. However, due to wounds his little sister suffered at Black Beetle's hands, Jaime is forced to let the villain escape. In the Time Masters: Vanishing Point limited series, the Time Stealers learn that the Vanishing Point fortress was destroyed.Time Masters: Vanishing Point #2 (August 2010) Black Beetle takes his allies to the destroyed Vanishing Point and sees that Rip has locked the Linear Men in a cell because they never agreed about how to handle time. The four villains find the cell and tear it open, finding Matthew Ryder and Liri Lee.Time Masters: Vanishing Point #3 (September 2010) Black Beetle asks the Linear Men to help bring Waverider back to life. But Supernova prevents Black Beetle from creating dystopia and he sends the Time Stealers back to the present, although Black Beetle escapes and the Linear Men choose to go with him since he freed them from imprisonment.Time Masters: Vanishing Point #4 (October 2010) After they find Waverider's corpse in the desolate wasteland of Earth's future, Black Beetle double-crosses the Linear Men and tries to use Waverider's power to become invulnerable.Time Masters: Vanishing Point #5 (December 2010) Black Beetle attempts to fuse Waverider's corpse power but is thwarted by Supernova, which allows Liri to fuse with Waverider's corpse to become Linear Woman. Black Beetle attacks Supernova but when Superman and the rest of the Time Masters arrive, he escapes, telling them they will see him again another time.Time Masters: Vanishing Point #6 (February 2011) Powers and abilities * The Black Beetle wears what appears to be a black version of Jaime Reyes' scarab suit. Black Beetle has so far only been seen utilizing energy blasts and flight abilities. It also allows him to travel through time, and protects him from the effects of the time portals. * Recently he has also obtained a Red Scarab, although it is currently unknown what extra powers it endows him. In other mediaTelevision= A character named Black Beetle appears in Young Justice voiced by Kevin Grevioux. However, the Black Beetle of the comics and the Black Beetle featured in Young Justice are not the same character, as Black Beetle from Young Justice is a member of the Reach, and based on the character named Dawur, while the Black Beetle from the comics simply stole Reach technology.

The name \\"jungin\\" directly means \\"middle people\\". This privileged class of commoners consisted of a small group of petty bureaucrats and other highly educated skilled workers whose technical and administrative skills enabled the yangban and the royal family to rule the lower classes. Jungin were the lifeblood of the Korean Confucian agrarian bureaucracy, for whom the upper classes depended on to maintain their vice- like hold on the people. Their traditions and habits are the forerunners of the modern Korean administrative systems in both North and South Korea.  Professions and roles in the society  Young Korean man of the middle class, 1904 In dynastic Korea, particularly during the Joseon period, the jungin were lower than the yangban aristocracy but above the lower middle and working class commoners in social status. They included highly educated government- employed specialists with a status comparable to modern white collar workers (e.g. interpreters, scientists, engineers, physicians, jurists, astronomers, accountants, calligraphers, and musicians), military officers from or had marriage ties to the families producing technical specialists, hereditary government functionaries (both capital and local), and illegitimate children of aristocrats. In everyday life, the jungin were below the aristocratic yangban but superior to the lower middle and working class sangmin. Their roles were minor technical and administrative officials who supported the structure of the government. The highest-ranking jungin, local functionaries, administratively enabled the yangban to oppress the lower classes, especially the total control they had over the sangmin. The jungin functioned as the middle-class and were essentially petty bureaucrats in the rural areas especially. Although inferior to the aristocracy in social standing, the highly educated jungin enjoyed far more privileges and influence than the lower middle and working class commoners. For example, the jungin were not taxed nor subject to military conscription. Like the yangban, they were allowed to live in the central part of the city, hence the name \\"middle people\\". Also, the jungin tended to marry within their own class as well as into the yangban class. In addition, since they were eligible to enter the palace as royal servants, it was possible for a jungin girl, if her father had a clean reputation or good connections and she was able to catch the king or Queen Dowager's good eye, to become a royal consort or even a Royal Noble Consort, the third highest level in the hierarchy of the king's harem, after the Queen Dowager and the queen. An example is Royal Noble Consort Hui of the Jang clan, mother of Gyeongjong. However, to become a jungin, passing the chapkwa examination, which tested their practical knowledge of certain skills, was usually required. The jungin besides being known as a section of the middle-class, they were the smallest social class in dynastic Korea. The Korean jungin, as a social class, were roughly analogous to the middle-class in Europe. Local functionaries in the rural areas were basically equal to petty bureaucrats.  Famous jungin  Jungin were prominent especially in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries when they tended to welcome Western institutions and ideas for modernizing Korea. * Yu Daechi (a.k.a.

A grammar does not describe the meaning of the strings or what can be done with them in whatever context‚Äîonly their form. A formal grammar is defined as a set of production rules for strings in a formal language. Formal language theory, the discipline that studies formal grammars and languages, is a branch of applied mathematics. Its applications are found in theoretical computer science, theoretical linguistics, formal semantics, mathematical logic, and other areas. A formal grammar is a set of rules for rewriting strings, along with a \\"start symbol\\" from which rewriting starts. Therefore, a grammar is usually thought of as a language generator. However, it can also sometimes be used as the basis for a \\"recognizer\\"--a function in computing that determines whether a given string belongs to the language or is grammatically incorrect. To describe such recognizers, formal language theory uses separate formalisms, known as automata theory. One of the interesting results of automata theory is that it is not possible to design a recognizer for certain formal languages.. For more on this subject, see undecidable problem. Parsing is the process of recognizing an utterance (a string in natural languages) by breaking it down to a set of symbols and analyzing each one against the grammar of the language. Most languages have the meanings of their utterances structured according to their syntax--a practice known as compositional semantics. As a result, the first step to describing the meaning of an utterance in language is to break it down part by part and look at its analyzed form (known as its parse tree in computer science, and as its deep structure in generative grammar). History 's treatise Astadyayi gives formal production rules and definitions to describe the formal grammar of Sanskrit. There are different uses of \\"form\\" and \\"formalism\\", which have changed over time, depending on the fields the relevant author was in contact with. A historical overview of the concept is given in  Introductory example  A grammar mainly consists of a set of rules for transforming strings. (If it only consisted of these rules, it would be a semi-Thue system.) To generate a string in the language, one begins with a string consisting of only a single start symbol. The production rules are then applied in any order, until a string that contains neither the start symbol nor designated nonterminal symbols is produced. A production rule is applied to a string by replacing one occurrence of the production rule's left-hand side in the string by that production rule's right-hand side (cf. the operation of the theoretical Turing machine). The language formed by the grammar consists of all distinct strings that can be generated in this manner. Any particular sequence of production rules on the start symbol yields a distinct string in the language. If there are essentially different ways of generating the same single string, the grammar is said to be ambiguous. For example, assume the alphabet consists of a and b, the start symbol is S, and we have the following production rules: : 1. S \\\\rightarrow aSb : 2. S \\\\rightarrow ba then we start with S, and can choose a rule to apply to it. If we choose rule 1, we obtain the string aSb. If we then choose rule 1 again, we replace S with aSb and obtain the string aaSbb. If we now choose rule 2, we replace S with ba and obtain the string ', and are done. We can write this series of choices more briefly, using symbols: S \\\\Rightarrow aSb \\\\Rightarrow aaSbb \\\\Rightarrow aababb. The language of the grammar is then the infinite set \\\\\\\\{a^nbab^n \\\\mid n \\\\geq 0 \\\\\\\\} = \\\\\\\\{ba, abab, aababb, aaababbb, \\\\dotsc \\\\\\\\}, where a^k is a repeated k times (and n in particular represents the number of times production rule 1 has been applied).  Formal definition  The syntax of grammars = In the classic formalization of generative grammars first proposed by Noam Chomsky in the 1950s, a grammar G consists of the following components: * A finite set N of nonterminal symbols, that is disjoint with the strings formed from G. * A finite set \\\\Sigma of terminal symbols that is disjoint from N. * A finite set P of production rules, each rule of the form :: (\\\\Sigma \\\\cup N)^{*} N (\\\\Sigma \\\\cup N)^{*} \\\\rightarrow (\\\\Sigma \\\\cup N)^{*} :where {*} is the Kleene star operator and \\\\cup denotes set union. That is, each production rule maps from one string of symbols to another, where the first string (the \\"head\\") contains an arbitrary number of symbols provided at least one of them is a nonterminal. In the case that the second string (the \\"body\\") consists solely of the empty string--i.e., that it contains no symbols at all--it may be denoted with a special notation (often \\\\Lambda, e or \\\\epsilon) in order to avoid confusion. * A distinguished symbol S \\\\in N that is the start symbol, also called the sentence symbol. A grammar is formally defined as the tuple (N, \\\\Sigma, P, S). Such a formal grammar is often called a rewriting system or a phrase structure grammar in the literature. = Some mathematical constructs regarding formal grammars = The operation of a grammar can be defined in terms of relations on strings: * Given a grammar G = (N, \\\\Sigma, P, S), the binary relation \\\\underset G \\\\Rightarrow (pronounced as \\"G derives in one step\\") on strings in (\\\\Sigma \\\\cup N)^{*} is defined by: *:x \\\\underset G \\\\Rightarrow y \\\\iff \\\\exists u, v, p, q \\\\in (\\\\Sigma \\\\cup N)^*: (x = upv) \\\\wedge (p \\\\rightarrow q \\\\in P) \\\\wedge (y = uqv) * the relation \\\\overset * {\\\\underset G \\\\Rightarrow} (pronounced as G derives in zero or more steps) is defined as the reflexive transitive closure of \\\\underset G \\\\Rightarrow * a sentential form is a member of (\\\\Sigma \\\\cup N)^* that can be derived in a finite number of steps from the start symbol S; that is, a sentential form is a member of \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ w \\\\in (\\\\Sigma \\\\cup N)^* \\\\mid S \\\\overset * {\\\\underset G \\\\Rightarrow} w \\\\right\\\\\\\\}. A sentential form that contains no nonterminal symbols (i.e. is a member of \\\\Sigma^*) is called a sentence.Sentential Forms, Context-Free Grammars, David Matuszek * the language of G, denoted as \\\\boldsymbol{L}(G), is defined as all those sentences that can be derived in a finite number of steps from the start symbol S; that is, the set \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ w \\\\in \\\\Sigma^* \\\\mid S \\\\overset * {\\\\underset G \\\\Rightarrow} w \\\\right\\\\\\\\}. Note that the grammar G = (N, \\\\Sigma, P, S) is effectively the semi-Thue system (N \\\\cup \\\\Sigma, P), rewriting strings in exactly the same way; the only difference is in that we distinguish specific nonterminal symbols, which must be rewritten in rewrite rules, and are only interested in rewritings from the designated start symbol S to strings without nonterminal symbols. = Example = For these examples, formal languages are specified using set-builder notation. Consider the grammar G where N = \\\\left \\\\\\\\{S, B\\\\right \\\\\\\\}, \\\\Sigma = \\\\left \\\\\\\\{a, b, c\\\\right \\\\\\\\}, S is the start symbol, and P consists of the following production rules: : 1. S \\\\rightarrow aBSc : 2. S \\\\rightarrow abc : 3. Ba \\\\rightarrow aB : 4. Bb \\\\rightarrow bb This grammar defines the language L(G) = \\\\left \\\\\\\\{ a^{n}b^{n}c^{n} \\\\mid n \\\\ge 1 \\\\right \\\\\\\\} where a^{n} denotes a string of n consecutive a's. Thus, the language is the set of strings that consist of 1 or more a's, followed by the same number of b's, followed by the same number of c's. Some examples of the derivation of strings in L(G) are: :(Note on notation: P \\\\underset i \\\\Rightarrow Q reads \\"String generates string by means of production \\", and the generated part is each time indicated in bold type.)  The Chomsky hierarchy  When Noam Chomsky first formalized generative grammars in 1956, he classified them into types now known as the Chomsky hierarchy. The difference between these types is that they have increasingly strict production rules and can therefore express fewer formal languages. Two important types are context-free grammars (Type 2) and regular grammars (Type 3). The languages that can be described with such a grammar are called context-free languages and regular languages, respectively. Although much less powerful than unrestricted grammars (Type 0), which can in fact express any language that can be accepted by a Turing machine, these two restricted types of grammars are most often used because parsers for them can be efficiently implemented.Grune, Dick & Jacobs, Ceriel H., Parsing Techniques - A Practical Guide, Ellis Horwood, England, 1990. For example, all regular languages can be recognized by a finite state machine, and for useful subsets of context-free grammars there are well-known algorithms to generate efficient LL parsers and LR parsers to recognize the corresponding languages those grammars generate. = Context-free grammars = A context-free grammar is a grammar in which the left-hand side of each production rule consists of only a single nonterminal symbol. This restriction is non-trivial; not all languages can be generated by context-free grammars. Those that can are called context-free languages. The language L(G) = \\\\left \\\\\\\\{ a^{n}b^{n}c^{n} \\\\mid n \\\\ge 1 \\\\right \\\\\\\\} defined above is not a context- free language, and this can be strictly proven using the pumping lemma for context-free languages, but for example the language \\\\left \\\\\\\\{ a^{n}b^{n} \\\\mid n \\\\ge 1 \\\\right \\\\\\\\} (at least 1 a followed by the same number of b's) is context-free, as it can be defined by the grammar G_2 with N=\\\\left \\\\\\\\{S\\\\right \\\\\\\\}, \\\\Sigma=\\\\left \\\\\\\\{a,b\\\\right \\\\\\\\}, S the start symbol, and the following production rules: : 1. S \\\\rightarrow aSb : 2. S \\\\rightarrow ab A context-free language can be recognized in O(n^3) time (see Big O notation) by an algorithm such as Earley's algorithm. That is, for every context-free language, a machine can be built that takes a string as input and determines in O(n^3) time whether the string is a member of the language, where n is the length of the string.Earley, Jay, \\"An Efficient Context-Free Parsing Algorithm,\\" Communications of the ACM, Vol. 13 No. 2, pp. 94-102, February 1970. Deterministic context-free languages is a subset of context-free languages that can be recognized in linear time. There exist various algorithms that target either this set of languages or some subset of it. = Regular grammars = In regular grammars, the left hand side is again only a single nonterminal symbol, but now the right-hand side is also restricted. The right side may be the empty string, or a single terminal symbol, or a single terminal symbol followed by a nonterminal symbol, but nothing else. (Sometimes a broader definition is used: one can allow longer strings of terminals or single nonterminals without anything else, making languages easier to denote while still defining the same class of languages.) The language \\\\left \\\\\\\\{ a^{n}b^{n} \\\\mid n \\\\ge 1 \\\\right \\\\\\\\} defined above is not regular, but the language \\\\left \\\\\\\\{ a^{n}b^{m} \\\\mid m,n \\\\ge 1 \\\\right \\\\\\\\} (at least 1 a followed by at least 1 b, where the numbers may be different) is, as it can be defined by the grammar G_3 with N=\\\\left \\\\\\\\{S, A,B\\\\right \\\\\\\\}, \\\\Sigma=\\\\left \\\\\\\\{a,b\\\\right \\\\\\\\}, S the start symbol, and the following production rules: :# S \\\\rightarrow aA :# A \\\\rightarrow aA :# A \\\\rightarrow bB :# B \\\\rightarrow bB :# B \\\\rightarrow \\\\epsilon All languages generated by a regular grammar can be recognized in O(n) time by a finite state machine. Although, in practice, regular grammars are commonly expressed using regular expressions, some forms of regular expression used in practice do not strictly generate the regular languages and do not show linear recognitional performance due to those deviations. = Other forms of generative grammars = Many extensions and variations on Chomsky's original hierarchy of formal grammars have been developed, both by linguists and by computer scientists, usually either in order to increase their expressive power or in order to make them easier to analyze or parse. Some forms of grammars developed include: * Tree-adjoining grammars increase the expressiveness of conventional generative grammars by allowing rewrite rules to operate on parse trees instead of just strings.Joshi, Aravind K., et al., \\"Tree Adjunct Grammars,\\" Journal of Computer Systems Science, Vol. 10 No. 1, pp. 136-163, 1975. * Affix grammarsKoster , Cornelis H. A., \\"Affix Grammars,\\" in ALGOL 68 Implementation, North Holland Publishing Company, Amsterdam, p. 95-109, 1971. and attribute grammarsKnuth, Donald E., \\"Semantics of Context-Free Languages,\\" Mathematical Systems Theory, Vol. 2 No. 2, pp. 127-145, 1968.Knuth, Donald E., \\"Semantics of Context-Free Languages (correction),\\" Mathematical Systems Theory, Vol. 5 No. 1, pp 95-96, 1971. allow rewrite rules to be augmented with semantic attributes and operations, useful both for increasing grammar expressiveness and for constructing practical language translation tools. = Recursive grammars = A recursive grammar is a grammar that contains production rules that are recursive. For example, a grammar for a context-free language is left-recursive if there exists a non-terminal symbol A that can be put through the production rules to produce a string with A as the leftmost symbol. Notes on Formal Language Theory and Parsing, James Power, Department of Computer Science National University of Ireland, Maynooth Maynooth, Co. Kildare, Ireland.JPR02 An example of recursive grammar is a clause within a sentence separated by two commas. All types of grammars in the Okoye hierarchy can be recursive.  Analytic grammars  Though there is a tremendous body of literature on parsing algorithms, most of these algorithms assume that the language to be parsed is initially described by means of a generative formal grammar, and that the goal is to transform this generative grammar into a working parser. Strictly speaking, a generative grammar does not in any way correspond to the algorithm used to parse a language, and various algorithms have different restrictions on the form of production rules that are considered well-formed. An alternative approach is to formalize the language in terms of an analytic grammar in the first place, which more directly corresponds to the structure and semantics of a parser for the language. Examples of analytic grammar formalisms include the following: * The Language Machine directly implements unrestricted analytic grammars. Substitution rules are used to transform an input to produce outputs and behaviour. The system can also produce the lm- diagram, which shows what happens when the rules of an unrestricted analytic grammar are being applied. * Top-down parsing language (TDPL): a highly minimalist analytic grammar formalism developed in the early 1970s to study the behavior of top-down parsers.Birman, Alexander, The TMG Recognition Schema, Doctoral thesis, Princeton University, Dept. of Electrical Engineering, February 1970. * Link grammars: a form of analytic grammar designed for linguistics, which derives syntactic structure by examining the positional relationships between pairs of words.Sleator, Daniel D. & Temperly, Davy, \\"Parsing English with a Link Grammar,\\" Technical Report CMU-CS-91-196, Carnegie Mellon University Computer Science, 1991.Sleator, Daniel D. & Temperly, Davy, \\"Parsing English with a Link Grammar,\\" Third International Workshop on Parsing Technologies, 1993. (Revised version of above report.) * Parsing expression grammars (PEGs): a more recent generalization of TDPL designed around the practical expressiveness needs of programming language and compiler writers.Ford, Bryan, Packrat Parsing: a Practical Linear-Time Algorithm with Backtracking, Master‚Äôs thesis, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Sept. 2002.

(executed 30 April 1585, Clonmel, County Tipperary) was an Irish Roman Catholic priest. He was beatified in 1992.Profile , CatholicIreland.net; accessed 11 December 2015. Life The son of a silversmith at Kilmallock, Mac Ionrachtaigh embraced the ecclesiastical state, studied abroad, and graduated bachelor in theology. Returning to Ireland, he became chaplain to Gerald FitzGerald, 15th Earl of Desmond, and shared the fortunes of his patron's struggle against Elizabeth I of England. In September, 1583, a fugitive with the Earl, Mac Ionrachtaigh was surprised on Sliabh Luachra by Lord Roche's gallowglasses, and handed over to the Earl of Ormond. By Ormond's command he was chained to one Patrick Grant, and sent to prison at Clonmel. Here he lay in irons, instructing and hearing confessions at his prison grate until April 1585. His jailer was then bribed by Victor White, a leading townsman, to release the priest for one night to say Mass and administer the Paschal Communion in White's house on Passion Sunday. The jailer secretly warned the President of Munster to take this opportunity of apprehending most of the neighbouring recusants at Mass. In the morning an armed force surrounded the house, arrested White and others seized the sacred vessels, and sought the priest everywhere. Mac Ionrachtaigh had been hidden under straw at the first alarm, and, though wounded when the heap was probed, ultimately escaped to the woods. Learning, however, that White's life could only be saved by his own surrender, he gave himself up, and was at once tried by martial law. Pardon and preferment were offered him for conforming, but he resolutely maintained the Roman Catholic faith and the pope's authority, and was executed as a traitor. His head was set up in the market-place, and his body, purchased from the soldiers, was buried behind the high altar of the Franciscan convent. NotesReferences * Myles William P.

History Alice Denney, a contemporary art collector active on the Washington scene, founded the Washington Project for the Arts (WPA) in 1975 as a \\"service center\\" for area artists and performers. The WPA's mission was not simply to provide a place for artists to show their work or perform, but also to make available advice in arts management, grantsmanship, career development, and legal rights. Denney launched the WPA with a grant from the Eugene and Agnes E. Meyer Foundation, a tiny staff, a three-story building, and a lot of goodwill. The WPA officially opened in April 1975 with a multidisciplinary program that included a broad survey of Washington area visual art. Denney stepped down as director in early 1979. Al Nodal, hired by Denney, succeeded her as Director in April 1979. Nodal continued to emphasize the work of area artists, but he added more shows featuring out-of-towners. Nodal started the WPA bookstore, which featured an unusual selection of artists' books and launched a new program to encourage the production or artists books. To support his programs, Nodal landed major grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and the District of Columbia's Commission on the Arts and Humanities. In 1980, WPA held its first auction fundraiser. Nodal ended his directorship in 1983, after WPA's move out of its original 1227 G Street location. The board hired Jock Reynolds in the summer of 1983 to replace Al Nodal as Director. The programming under Reynolds received regular coverage in the national art press, shifting WPA from primarily serving local artists to serving a national audience. This shift for the WPA was met with mixed feelings, some welcoming the national prestige, and others accustomed to WPA's mission to focus on local Washington, DC artists. Through his leadership, Reynolds launched an aggressive capital campaign in the spring of 1988 where he brought in generous support from the federal and local government, art foundations, individual donors, and more than eighty corporations or corporate foundations. This raised the bar for WPA, and to maintain its level of activity in the future, it would need to raise close to $1 million each year. In December 1989, Reynolds took a sabbatical and decided not to return to Washington. John L. Moore III, who was already at the WPA, filled in as acting director, from August 1989 until the board hired Marilyn Zeitlin, a contemporary art curator, as executive director in May 1990. The budget for the fiscal year 1991 was set at around a million dollars, but Zeitlin was only able to raise a fraction of that amount. The WPA continued to mount an impressive array of programs, but financial problems overwhelmed the organization. When Zeitlin left in May 1992, Don Russell, who had been on the WPA staff in the 1980s, was hired back. At that time, one of WPA's mainstays for financial support, the National Endowment for the Arts, was beginning to eliminate funding for artists spaces. In April 1995, Russell resigned and by December of the same year, WPA was bankrupt. It defaulted on its rent, lost its loan, and closed its doors.A Brief History of WPA & WPA\\\\C by Laura Coyle WPA\\\\Corcoran, 1996 ‚Äì 2016 In 1996, a generous handful of board members and avid WPA supporters paid off the WPA's outstanding debts, wiping the slate clean. With the support of David C. Levy, the director of the Corcoran Gallery of Art, the Corcoran board of trustees, and members of the art community, the WPA's operations were transferred into the Washington Project for the Arts\\\\Corcoran. The Corcoran would provide inkind support, including an office in the museum's curatorial department, equipment, technical assistance, and the like, but no direct financial support. In 1999, Marta Kuzma served as director. Kuzma's term attempted to redirect the program to address Washington, DC as a unique context for international contemporary art projects. She resigned in June 2001 after mounting friction with a Board more focused on serving the local community. After Kuzma's departure, Annie Adjchavanich was named director. While Adjchavanich was director, she ramped up programs for area artists and recruited new members. In March 2005, Adjchavanich left the WPA\\\\C and Kim Ward, previously membership and finance director, was named acting director until August 2005, when hired as executive director. Under the leadership of Kim Ward, the Washington Project for the Arts legally separated from the Corcoran Gallery of Art on December 31, 2007. The organization returned to full autonomy with an office and micro gallery space near Dupont Circle, ending the eleven-year partnership with the Corcoran Gallery of Art. In 2008, the organization was a finalist for the Mayor's Award for Innovation in the Arts. In 2009, Lisa J. Gold was announced as the new director.Washington Native to Lead Washington Project for the Arts, authenticarts.blogspot, February 24, 2009 Under her leadership the WPA continued the growth and refocusing started by Kim Ward and conducted several key exhibitions and moved to a larger, permanent space. She left in 2016 and took a position at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden as director of public engagement. In 2016, Peter Nesbett was announced as the new director. The different spaces of WPA When Alice Denney founded the WPA in 1975, she was lucky to snare a rundown building at 1227 G Street, NW, Washington, DC from the city's Redevelopment Land Agency. The rent was only $1 a year. Renovated on a shoestring budget, 1227 G Street included 5 galleries, a film screening room, a performing arts space, and offices. A small board, over half of whom were artists, advised the programming and exhibitions associated with the G street Space. In 1982, 1227 G Street was sold to developers and WPA was evicted from its original location. Then director Al Nodal supervised WPA's move to the Jenifer Building in the 400 block of 7th Street, NW, Washington DC. Rent was no longer $1 per year, thus straining the WPA's resources considerably. In 1985, only three years after the move from 1227 G Street to the Jenifer Building, the WPA's new home was sold again. The WPA relocated to 7th and E Streets, NW, to what had been a Kresge five and dime. Then director Jock Reynolds made a deal with the new owners of the Jenifer Building that would allow WPA to move back into the building after it was renovated. In December 1988, the WPA was able to move back into its improved space, all because of an aggressive fundraising campaign led by Reynolds. In 1996, the WPA was supported by the Corcoran Gallery of Art and became the WPA\\\\Corcoran. It moved its space into an office in the Corcoran's curatorial office. No longer with an exhibition space of its own, the WPA\\\\C relied on collaborations and donations of space from other area arts organizations. After separating from the Corcoran, the WPA moved to an office and micro gallery space at 2023 Massachusetts Avenue, near Dupont Circle. In 2016 the WPA moved into its new home in the Atlantic Plumbing development, over the 9:30 Club north of the U Street Corridor. Notable exhibitions In June 1989, the Corcoran Gallery of Art canceled The Perfect Moment: Robert Mapplethorpe Photographs, which included (among other things) sexually explicit images involving gay BDSM, and two photos of children with exposed genitals. This was in the context of the culture wars of the late 1980s, when Sen. Jesse Helms, Rep. Dick Armey, among others, questioned grant funding for individual artists, from the National Endowment for the Arts, for art that they considered \\"morally reprehensible trash.\\"Robert Mapplethorpe's extraordinary vision, The MIT Tech, August 6, 1989, DEBORAH A.

In October through November 1995, it showed a retrospective of the artist Noche Crist, Romanian rhapsodies. In December 1995, Hostile Witness was shown, by the artist, Shailish Thakor. In the summer of 2005 the WPA\\\\C organized one of its largest membership shows ever at the seven spaces that made up the Warehouse Galleries, Theater and Cafe complex on 7th Street, NW in Washington, DC. Titled and curated by F. Lennox Campello, \\"Seven\\", the show included works by Sam Gilliam, Mark Jenkins, Frank Warren, Tim Tate, Chan Chao, and many other well-known DC area member artists. In December 2005, WPA\\\\C mounted PostSecret, a project founded by Frank Warren. In a donated space on M street in Georgetown, Washington, DC, thousands of postcards that were sent into Warren were placed on display. The exhibition drew in large crowds, many whom waited in line to see the exhibit, and can be credited as the most successful exhibition since the Mapplethorpe show. In 2006, it sponsored Wallsnatchers, an exhibition of graffiti art, at a vacant Staples building in Georgetown. In 2009, major American art collector Mera Rubell of the Rubell Family Collection, selected and curated 36 Washington, DC area artists for a WPA exhibition at the American University Museum. In May 2010, WPA collaborated with The Pink Line Project for Cabaret (re)Revolatire. This event, curated by Alberto Gait√°n celebrated the historic Cabaret ReVoltaire series that was presented by WPA in 1992. The WPA Biennial exhibition OPTIONS, features under-recognized and emerging artists from the mid-Atlantic region. Past exhibitions and programs include, Wall Snatchers, The Experimental Media Series, Seven, Sculpture Unbound, Anonymous I, Anonymous Returns, Anonymous III, Conversions, Punk Festival, and many more. WPA has collaborated with American University, The Ellipse Arts Center, Edison Place Gallery, Washington Sculptor's Group, District of Columbia Arts Center, Flashpoint, Corcoran Gallery of Art and College of Art & Design, Warehouse Arts Complex and Theater, Creative Alliance at The Patterson, Gallery5, and many others.

Architecture The Abijah Thomas House is an octagon house, which is part of the trend of octagon architecture of 1850s America. The building consists of seventeen rooms, ten closets, and a storage room. The exterior walls are made of brick, which were made by slaves on the property. Interior design wise, the house features a rare example of painted ashlar upon plaster wall. Other interior touches include graining, marbleizing and stenciling. History The house was completed in 1857, for Abijah Thomas of Smyth County, who was a property and slave owner, and the owner of a textile plant. The house and the property around it consisted of 400 acres, and was assessed at being worth $5,000 in 1857. =Today= The house sat abandoned for many years and is currently owned by a local resident who seeks to renovate it back to its historical style.

History The website was founded in 1996 by June Kinoshita, funded by an anonymous philanthropic foundation, and launched at the International Conference on Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders in Osaka, Japan, The forum brings together a team of specialists in science writing and editing, data curation, information architecture, project management and technology. Alzforum was established as an independent neutral Non-profit organization, without affiliation to any specific university or research institute. Its relations with the scientific community include an advisory board with leaders in the scientific community representing diverse points of view. At first the site took the form of ‚ÄòPapers of the Week‚Äô listings, including abstracts of all relevant publications (initially manually produced in order to avoid copyright infringement), commentary, virtual audio seminars, and a list of seminal papers in Alzheimer's research. The Web's potential for interactivity was used for informal live chats and commentary on papers by registered users of the site. By the end of the first year there were 1200 users, adding as many as 100 new users a month in the first years of its existence. Operations From 1997, the website also began to develop as a community repository, enabling researchers to deposit data sets. Currently it maintains several databases relating to gene mutations, gene association studies, epidemiological studies, antibodies, drug trials, protocols and antecedent biomarker studies. Of particular note are the AlzGene database of genetic studies of Alzheimer's disease, which has been cited more than 1,200 times in the scientific literature, and the AlzRisk database of epidemiologic studies. The forum acts as an integrator of these diverse sources, linking primary research articles to related news, papers, databases, and discussions . From 2000 onwards a data-driven dynamic system has been used to automatically search and download PubMed citations into a database, and provide tools for editors to post news and comments and crosslink them to related material. The development of semantic web tools is a current and ongoing development. These assist in the identification of hypotheses and related evidence in papers and discussions. SWAN (Semantic Web Applications in Neuromedicine) has resulted from a collaboration between the forum and Massachusetts General Hospital. Work on this continues with the Scientific Collaboration Framework. The forum has become a point of reference for researchers into AD. As of June 2013 it has more than 8300 registered users. It is estimated that 30-50% of researchers from a wide range of institutions and countries studying Alzheimer's internationally are registered or active on the site. The success of Alzforum has resulted in its online disease-specific scientific community framework being cloned in other areas of research into neurological disorders. Multiple Sclerosis Discovery Forum, Pain Research Forum, Schizophrenia Research Forum and PD Online (a site for research into Parkinson's disease, funded by the Michael J. Fox Foundation) are using the same approachDas S, McCaffrey PG, Talkington MW, Andrews NA, Corlosquet S, Ivinson AJ, Clark T.

Early life The son of Edward Morrison Ganong and Margaret A. Lunn, Hardy Ganong was born and educated in St. Stephen, New Brunswick. He was a cousin to the family that founded Ganong Bros. chocolate makers and after completing his schooling went to work in this business. World War I In 1909, Hardy Ganong joined the Canadian Militia, then following the outbreak of World War I enlisted in the Canadian Army. He was sent overseas as part of the Canadian Expeditionary Force where he served on the battlefields of France as a member of the 5th Battalion Canadian Mounted Rifles. He was wounded in the autumn of 1916 during the battles for Vimy Ridge but recovered and returned to duty. Demobilized in 1919, he returned home where, in 1920, he married schoolteacher Mildred Viola Thomas of Calais, Maine with whom he had three children. World War II During peacetime, Ganong remained as a member of the militia, and, by the time World War II broke out, he had risen to the rank of lieutenant colonel. Made commander of the Carleton and York Regiment, he led the regiment as the first Canadian military unit to ship to England for battle duty. In March 1941, Ganong took command of the 3rd Canadian Infantry Brigade and in late 1942 was promoted to major general. Sent back to Canada on the advice of Bernard Montgomery, he was appointed general officer to organize and command the 8th Canadian Infantry Division of the Home Service Divisions. Stationed for a time at Prince George, British Columbia, in October 1943 he was placed in command of the 6th Canadian Infantry Division headquartered on Vancouver Island, where he was in charge of preparations for participation in the invasion of Japan. Ganong was awarded the Efficiency Decoration for his years of voluntary military service and in 1944 was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire. In December 1944, with Canadian participation in the invasion of Japan cancelled and a Pacific coastal defense no longer deemed necessary, he was assigned to command the Allied troops in Newfoundland, where he remained until his retirement in 1945. His son, Russell Edward Ganong, also served during the war with his father's old Carleton and York Regiment. He was killed during the Italian Campaign on March 18, 1944. He was survived by his wife, Mary Mackenzie, and an infant son, Hardy MacKenzie Ganong, born September 29, 1943. Later life Out of the army, Ganong served as honorary aide-de-camp to Governor Generals the Earl of Athlone, Vincent Massey and Georges Vanier. From 1955 to 1962 he was the full-time civil defense co-coordinator with responsibility for the organizing and training of all civil defense forces for the Province of New Brunswick. =Politics= A St. Stephen town councilor for two years, Ganong was the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada candidate in the 1949 Canadian federal election for the riding of New Brunswick Southwest. Of the 12,336 ballots cast, he lost by 58 votes to the Liberal incumbent, A. Wesley Stuart. He ran unsuccessfully against Stuart a second time in 1953. =Sporting and business interests= Ganong was also an active member of the executive committee of the New Brunswick Boy Scouts Association and served as the provincial movement's president. Among his other activities, he was vice- president of the N.B. Division, Canadian Red Cross, president, N.B. Boy Scouts Association, director, Charlotte County Board of Trade, Board member, Connors Bros. Ltd., and president of the New Brunswick Fish and Game Protective Association.

He was also voted president of the New Brunswick Curling Association for 1935‚Äì1936 term, and made its honorary president from 1941 to 1945. As a player, Ganong was 2nd stone on the St. Stephen team that won the 1930 Ganong Cup, a trophy donated by cousin Arthur Ganong given annually to the winner of the provincial curling championship. His team's win earned them the right to compete for the national title in the Brier Cup. As much as he was enthusiastic about the sport of curling, Ganong was equally as passionate about harness racing. St. Stephen had a racetrack and he wrote a column on the sport for the local Saint Croix Courier weekly newspaper. He was also a racing judge at meets throughout New Brunswick and Maine and for two seasons was a judge at Exhibition Park Raceway in Saint John, New Brunswick. Death Ganong and his wife died in February 1963 as a result of an auto accident during a winter snow storm on Route 1 in Charlotte County, New Brunswick while returning home from the city of Saint John. They are buried at the St. Stephen Rural Cemetery.

But later on January 22 on the said year, BOL worship gatherings transferred to Celebrity Sports Plaza in Capitol Hills, Quezon City to accommodate 1,200 members. Pastor Conde had always wanted to show that God Himself provides for Filipino churches, and the Filipinos must break free from colonial mentality. He always wanted to establish that how the Filipino can be independent from the foreign missionaries.Anderson, Allan and Tang, Edmond. (2005) Asian and Pentecostal: the charismatic face of Christianity in Asia.] London: Regnum Books (p 393 to 394) After the People Power Revolution in 1986, Pastor Conde drew inspiration from his Korea Prayer Study Tour and the Prayer Mountain experiences in South Korea, then BOL acquired a piece of land in the mountains in Rizal to build the country's and Southeast Asia's first Prayer Mountain facilities to spread the same spirit of prayer in the Philippines led to building the first Filipino prayer mountain facility on the said year, in 1988, BOL dedicated the Touch of Glory Prayer Mountain, its ministry of intensifying and deepening the prayer lives of the Filipino Christians through fasting. Today it continues as a place dedicated to restoration in prayer and has become a haven for believers from different churches and denominations to pray for the Philippines, Touch of Glory Prayer Mountain is located in Antipolo, Rizal, an hour away from Manila. On April 5, 1987, BOL services move to Circle Theater (now Circle Events Place) located at Timog Avenue, and started to divide into four worship gatherings every Sunday.

BOL also planted another central church in Makati, and had been planting church satellites nationwide. In August 1993, BOL began building its own ministry center along Mother Ignacia Avenue in Quezon City.http://solutionsgeneral.com/PDF/buildings.pdf BOL is an indigenous church, which built without the help of foreign Christian churches, financial assistance, political support, or even with the church partnership, it was built by the Filipino Christians.Anderson, Allan and Tang, Edmond.

On November 29, 1998, the church dedicated Crossroad77 (now known as Crossroad Center) and weekly attendance averaged up to 2,500 each of the four service gatherings. The rapid growth of the church can be attributed to the personal care of new members and neighborhood small groups presided by trained leaders, the ministry center also puts prayer rooms and it houses all the ministries of the church. In 2001, BOL Makati split into two centers and transferred its worship services from Mondragon building to a larger space. BOL Makati is now located on Glorietta 4 (G4), and Greenbelt Onstage, the latter located at the Project Mosaic, 3F Greenbelt 1, Ayala Center, Makati City.

In these journey groups that meet once a week to do Bible study, fellowship and ministry work. The 3rd, 4th and 5th storey of the ministry center was also community center which was supported by BOL. Core values BOL embraces to the Statement of Faith on Holy Scriptures to be the verbally inspired Word of God in its entirety, sixty-six books composing of the Old and New Testaments, the final authority for faith and life. That believes in one triune God, eternally existing in three Persons - Father, Son, and Holy Spirit - co- eternal in being, co-identical in nature, co-equal in power and glory, and having the same attributes and perfections. Embraces the absolutely essential for man to be born again, regenerated by the Holy Spirit, in which he is no longer conformed to the world system but redirected to the things of the Spirit, in order to be saved; and that the only way to salvation is to turn in genuine faith from the heart to Jesus Christ as personal Lord and Savior. The Church, which is the body and espoused bride of Christ, is a spiritual organism made up of born-again persons, not to any specific organization. Believes the great commission that it is the obligation of the saved to witness by life and by word to the truths of the Holy Scripture and to seek to proclaim the Gospel to all mankind. The vision of BOL from the beginning of its ministry work up to present is to build a strong national uniqueness by becoming independent from foreign sources, to rediscover Filipino Christian indigenous spirituality. BOL emphasizes the independence of the indigenous church and is challenging other denominational churches to revive their identity through God's word as well. This belief is founded on the distinction which BOL applied to the uniqueness of the Christian journey by emphasizing the centrality of Christ, the foundation of Scriptures, prayer, worship, operated by the power of God, the way of service through sacrifice and being people of faith.Anderson, Allan and Tang, Edmond. (2005) Asian and Pentecostal: the charismatic face of Christianity in Asia.] London: Regnum Books (p 394 to 395) Congregations BOL have established satellite outreaches local and international, 11 satellite outreaches with weekly attendance of around 15,000 to 20,000 people within Metro Manila.\\\\- Bread of Life Headquarters Attendance Provincial congregations has a total of 20 satellite outreaches, BOL Crossroad Center, BOL Makati and BOL Cebu serves as the Philippine central churches.
