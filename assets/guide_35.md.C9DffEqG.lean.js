In 1822, Jean-Baptiste Jollois, one of the founding fathers of archaeology in the region, carried out excavations on the so-called \\"fontaine de l'√âtuv√©e\\", an ancient water-source which he artificially drained to rediscover if it could still supply the town's public water fountains. In a former cesspit, he found a roughly square (0.6m by 0.55m) stone tablet with a well-preserved votive inscription, datable by its style to the 2nd century. It reads: :::: :::: :::: :::: :::: :::: :\\"To August Acionna, CapillusA Latinized name, as compared to that of his father, probably indicating a Romanized second-generation figure still loyal to the Gallic deities. son of Illiomarus [offered] this portico with these ornaments, in willing and right fulfillment of his vow\\"The original stela was deposited in the new Mus√©e historique d'Orl√©ans on its discovery and, though the original has since disappeared, it is still known from drawings and lithographs Jollois made of it and from a plaster-cast of it now in the Orl√©ans museum. Acionna is not attested in any other sources, but the ending -onna indisputably indicates a Latinized Gallic name. The stela's findspot in an ancient source suggests that she is a water goddess. Her name may be linked to that of the River Essonne - Axiona, Exona, in medieval texts - whose source is in the slopes to the north of the for√™t d'Orl√©ans (this river's upper course is today called the ≈íuf and only takes up the name Essonne at its junction with the Rimarde). Another river of the for√™t d'Orl√©ans, the \\"Esse\\" or \\"Ruisseau des Esses\\", flowing south into the sea in the Bionne (a Celtic name), might also have borne this name. Acionna probably had her sanctuary at the Fontaine de l'Etuv√©e in the commune of Orl√©ans and remains of a Gallo-Roman temple and a section of an aqueduct were excavated in 2007.

Origins and birth Wagstaffe, born about 1611, was probably the seventh and youngest son of Richard Wagstaffe of Harbury in Warwickshire, by his wife Anne, daughter of John Hanslap of Stoneythorpe in the same county. If so, he is probably to be identified with the ‚ÄúJosephus Wagstaf‚Äù, son of Richard, who was christened at Harbury on 13 August 1611. Military career He was a soldier of fortune, and at the beginning of 1642 was major in an Irish regiment in the service of France. In June 1642 he became lieutenant-colonel in the army destined by the parliament for the recovery of Ireland, and in the following autumn held the same rank in Hampden's regiment of foot in the Earl of Essex's army. Taken prisoner by the royalists in January 1643, he changed sides and accepted a commission to raise a regiment for the king. Subsequently he was major-general of foot under Prince Maurice in the west of England, was knighted at Crediton on 27 July 1644, and distinguished himself by his soldierly retreat in the disastrous Battle of Langport. Penruddock uprising In 1655 the western royalists asked for Wagstaffe to be their leader in their intended rising against Cromwell, he being well known to them and generally beloved. Clarendon characterises him as fitted 'rather for execution than counsel, a stout man who looked not far before him, yet he had a great companionableness in his nature, which exceedingly prevailed with those who in the intermission of fighting loved to spend their time in jollity and mirth.' With about two hundred Wiltshire royalists Wagstaffe entered Salisbury early on 12 March 1655, and proclaimed Charles II. The judges on circuit and sheriff were seized in their beds, and Wagstaffe thought of hanging them as a seasonable example, but was prevented by the opposition of Colonel Penruddock and the country gentlemen. Leaving Salisbury with about four hundred men, the royalists marched into Dorset, but gained few recruits on their way. When they entered Somerset their numbers began to diminish, and the few who remained were taken or dispersed by Captain Unton Croke at South Molton on the night of 14 March. Wagstaffe is said to have escaped by leaping his horse over the north wall of the churchyard and a gate in the wall is now known as ‚ÄúThe Wagstaffe Gate‚Äù.The South Molton and District Archive Local History Society‚Äôs web-site, accessed on 18 June 2008 Later life Wagstaffe himself evaded all the searches subsequently made after him, and was back in Holland by July. He survived the Restoration, petitioned for the reversion of an office [which he did not obtain], and received a small grant of some of the late king's goods in 1662.

The site is largely forested and contains a range of habitats including mangrove forest, swamp forest, riverine forest and seasonally-inundated forest. There is also a long strip of sandy beach area and some grassy savanna. Several rivers flow through the park into the estuary, including the River Rembou√©, the River Igombin√© and the River Gomgou√©. Flora The mangrove forests are dominated by Avicennia and Rhizophora species, and these and the golden leather fern (Acrostichum aureum) help stabilise the habitat and slow down water flow. People have been living here since at least the Neolithic era and gather timber, grow cassava and banana, and hunt and fish. Fauna Elephants, gorillas, monkeys, buffaloes, duikers and chimpanzees are present in the rainforest, Hawksbill sea turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata), green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas) and olive ridley sea turtle (Lepidochelys olivacea) visit the estuary and the beaches are used by leatherback sea turtles for breeding. A local conservation organisation monitors the female leatherback turtles as they come ashore to lay their eggs, tags them, guards the nests, operates a turtle hatchery and provides ecological education for the local populace.

In 1894, the grant of the decoration was extended to officers of volunteer forces throughout the British Empire by instituting a separate new decoration, the Volunteer Officers' Decoration for India and the Colonies.

In the United Kingdom, an alternative ribbon is used when the decoration is awarded to officers of the Honourable Artillery Company, while a new regular ribbon was introduced in 1967. * The decoration's original ribbon, which is still being used for awards outside the United Kingdom, is dark green with a 7 millimetres wide lime yellow band in the centre. It is identical to the ribbon of the superseded Territorial Decoration. * Decorations awarded to members of the Honourable Artillery Company (HAC) are suspended from a half dark blue and half red ribbon with yellow edges, representing the racing colours of King Edward VII.. An administrative oversight resulted in members of the HAC, reckoned as the oldest regiment of the British Army, not being made eligible for the Volunteer Long Service Medal until 1906. To compensate the HAC for this omission, that medal was awarded to its members with this special ribbon to distinguish it from regular awards, a distinction continued with subsequent Territorial and reserve long service awards, including the current Volunteer Reserves Service Medal. * Following the formation of the Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve in 1967, the subsidiary title on the bar-brooch was changed from \\"TERRITORIAL\\" to \\"T. & A.V.R.\\" and the dark green and lime yellow ribbon was replaced by a half blue, half green ribbon with a 7 millimetres wide lime yellow band in the centre.

Burway Bridge is a bridge in Ludlow, Shropshire, England. It takes the B4361 road across the River Corve. Original bridge The original Burway Bridge having collapsed in 2007. The gap in Coronation Avenue left by the collapsing of the 1950s bridge. The original bridge was built in the mid-20th century to take the new Coronation Avenue across the Corve, relieving the historic Corve Bridge just upstream. Before its construction the A49 trunk road crossed Corve Bridge; its construction diverted that route, but consequently meant the less-major A4117 road crossed the Corve Bridge in order to meet the A49. The opening of the A49 Ludlow by-pass in 1979 removed these A roads from the vicinity, with the former A49 route crossing Burway Bridge re-classified as the B4361, which remains to the present day. =Collapse= The bridge was demolished on 27 June 2007 following heavy rainfall which caused serious flooding of the River Corve resulting in the collapse of the bridge and a neighbouring house. Rebuilding Undertaken by Shropshire County Council, a temporary Bailey bridge was first opened in August 2007 to partially reopen the B4361. Over the next year, the council's consultants Mouchel designed a permanent bridge and this was constructed by McPhillips (Wellington) Ltd. Constructed to withstand any serious future flooding, the bridge now features a longer span to increase the volume capacity of the River Corve beneath. The new bridge finally opened on 19 January 2009. (The inscription on the bridge reads \\"Burway Bridge 2008\\" as that was the year of its construction.) The bridge now carries across the river not only two-way road traffic, but also a lane for car parking, a wide cycling & pedestrian pavement on one side of the carriageway, and a pedestrian pavement on the other side.

It operated over 50 food stores in the south and east, as well as some other retail businesses, and funeral services. At the time of the merger, Lothian Co-op was owned by 65,000 consumer members on a one member one vote basis. On the 19 August 2008, the board of the society agreed to propose the transfer of the society's engagements to the much larger Co-operative Group. The proposed transfer was considered by Lothian Borders & Angus members at a series of meetings in the autumn and, with a majority of the membership in favour of the proposal, the transfer of engagements took place on 13 December 2008. History Lothian Co-op was the direct successor of nineteenth and early twentieth century consumer co-operatives in its trading area, the oldest being in the border towns of Galashiels and Hawick. The Galashiels co- operative was formed by a mill workers' association that was already operating along similar lines. The Hawick and Galashiels co-operatives were formed in 1839, five years before the Rochdale Pioneers shop opened in England. Therefore, Lothian Co-op was, at the time of merger, probably the oldest continuously trading consumer co-operative in Scotland.Clydebank‚Äì1881 ; Scotmid‚Äì1859 Tranent Co-operative Society was formed in 1862, and took the name East Lothian in 1940 Through 1991, the Galashiels co-operative expanded through mergers to serve the Scottish Borders and Dumfries and Galloway regions. In 1992, Border Regional Co-operative Society merged with East Lothian Co-operative Society (based in Tranent), becoming Lothian and Borders Co-operative Society. In 1998, it absorbed East Angus Co-operative Society of Arbroath, taking its final name and structure. (as of 2008) The Industrial Revolution flooded Scotland's mill and mining towns with workers, whose co- operatives thrived In the early 21st century, growth continued through new construction and acquisitions from other grocers. New construction included a supermarket in Castle Douglas, and purchases included a former SPAR store in North Berwick, a filling station in Lauder, and, notably, nine convenience stores sold by Somerfield in 2006, Lothian Co-op's first operation in Aberdeenshire. Operations Lothian Co-op was a regional co-operative, formed by the gradual amalgamation of numerous local co-operatives. Operating 52 food stores in southern and eastern Scotland, as well as pharmacies, funeral services, post offices, petrol stations, and a furnishings store in Selkirk, it was the smaller of Scotland's two regional consumer co-operatives until 2008, the larger being Scotmid, and one of four altogether. Lothian Co- op was a member (customer owner) of The Co-operative Group, sourcing its food through a UK-wide buying programme called the Co-operative Retail Trading Group.) From 2006, it bought home furnishings stock through the Anglia Buying Group, a national buying programme operated by Anglia Regional Co-operative Society. Funeral and travel premises in Channel Street, Galashiels, photographed in 2009 a few months after the merger with the Co-operative GroupChief executive Bob Jamieson served as a director of The Co-operative Group from 2005. Like most retail consumers' co-operatives in the UK, Lothian Co-op was incorporated as an industrial and provident society, regulated by the Financial Services Authority.As of 2008, smaller regional co-op in Scotland by number of shops (129 versus 52). Making up the four were Clydebank Co-operative Society and The Co-operative Group Ownership and governance Lothian Co-op was at the time of its merger owned by 65,000 consumer members, who invested in equity shares, with share balances averaging ¬£12 each, and earning 3% interest per year. Lothian and Borders Co-op rebuilt the frontage of its Galashiels supermarket in the early 1990s. The site was later purchased by Tesco. It did not pay a patronage dividend to members, though each year around ¬£90,000 of profits was distributed to local causes as ‚ÄúCommunity Dividend Grants‚Äù, and taxable profit was re-invested in the business. A voluntary president and board of directors were elected from among the members holding at least four shares, on a one member one vote basis; the board supervised the chief executive and management. Like many UK listed companies and co-operatives, the board had an audit sub-committee responsible for internal controls, following the 1999 Turnbull Report.

Part II, Ch. 45: \\"The various classes of prophets.\\" The Guide for the Perplexed. Trans. M. Friedl√§nder. 2nd ed. New York: Dover Publications, 1956. pp. 242-244. Print. Hebrew Bible\\"Holy Spirit\\"= The term \\"holy spirit\\" appears three times in the Hebrew Bible: Psalm 51 refers to \\"Your holy spirit\\" (ruach kodshecha) and Isaiah refers twice to \\"His holy spirit\\" (ruach kodsho). Psalm 51 contains a triple parallelism between different types of \\"spirit\\": =\\"Spirit of God\\"= Variations of a similar term, \\"spirit of God\\", also appear in various places in the Hebrew Bible. The Hebrew noun ruac·∏• () can refer to \\"breath\\", \\"wind\\", or some invisible moving force (\\"spirit\\"). The following are some examples of the word ruac·∏• (in reference to God's \\"spirit\\") in the Hebrew scriptures:Translations from Sefaria * Genesis 1:2 \\"a wind from God sweeping over the water\\" See: Darshan, Guy, ‚ÄúRua·∏• ‚ÄôElohim in Genesis 1:2 in Light of Phoenician Cosmogonies: A Tradition‚Äôs History,‚Äù Journal of Northwest Semitic Languages 45,2 (2019), 51‚Äì78. * 1 Samuel 16:13 \\"and the spirit of the LORD gripped David from that day on.\\" * Psalm 143:10 \\"Let Your gracious spirit lead me on level ground.\\" * Isaiah 44:3 \\"So will I pour My spirit on your offspring, My blessing upon your posterity.\\" * Joel 2:28 \\"I will pour out My spirit on all flesh; Your sons and daughters shall prophesy.\\" Rabbinic literature The term ruach haqodesh is found frequently in talmudic and midrashic literature. In some cases it signifies prophetic inspiration, while in others it is used as a hypostatization or a metonym for God.Alan Unterman and Rivka Horowitz, Ruach ha-Kodesh, Encyclopedia Judaica (CD-ROM Edition, Jerusalem: Judaica Multimedia/Keter, 1997). The rabbinical understanding of the Holy Spirit has a certain degree of personification, but it remains, \\"a quality belonging to God, one of his attributes\\".Joseph Abelson,The Immanence of God in Rabbinical Literature (London:Macmillan and Co., 1912). In Rabbinic Judaism, the references to \\"the Spirit of God\\", the Holy Spirit of YHWH, abound, however apart from Kabbalistic mysticism it has rejected any idea of God as being either dualistic, tri-personal, or ontologically complex. The idea of God as a duality or trinity is considered shituf (or \\"not purely monotheistic\\"). =Nature= What the Bible generally calls \\"Spirit of God\\" is called in the Talmud and Midrash \\"Holy Spirit\\" due to the disinclination to the use of the Tetragrammaton.See, for example, Targum to Isaiah 40:13 It is probably owing to this fact that the Shekhinah is often referred to instead of the Holy Spirit. It is said of the former, as of the Holy Spirit, that it rests upon a person. The difference between the two in such cases has not yet been determined. Although the Holy Spirit is often named instead of God,e.g., in Sifre Deuteronomy 31 [ed. Friedmann, p. 72] it was conceived as being something distinct. The Spirit was among the ten things that were created on the first day.Hagigah 12a,b Though the nature of the Holy Spirit is really nowhere described, the name indicates that it was conceived as a kind of wind that became manifest through noise and light. As early as it is stated, \\"the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing,\\" the expression \\"behind me\\" characterizing the unusual nature of the noise. The Shekhinah made a noise before Samson like a bell.Sotah 9b When the Holy Spirit was resting upon him, his hair gave forth a sound like a bell, which could be heard from afar. It imbued him with such strength that he could uproot two mountains and rub them together like pebbles, and could cover leagues at one step.Sotah 17b; Leviticus Rabbah 8:2 Although the lights which accompanied the noise are not expressly mentioned, the frequently recurring phrase \\"he beheld (hetzitz be-) the Holy Spirit\\" suggests that he upon whom the spirit rested saw a light. The Holy Spirit gleamed in the court of Shem, of Samuel, and of King Solomon.Genesis Rabbah 85:12 It \\"glimmered\\" in Tamar (Genesis 38:18), in the sons of Jacob (Genesis 42:11), and in Moses (Exodus 2:12), i.e., it settled upon these individuals.See Genesis Rabbah 85:9, 91:7; Leviticus Rabbah 32:4, \\"nitzotzah\\" and \\"hetzitz\\"; compare also Leviticus Rabbah 8:2, \\"hitkhil le-gashgesh\\" Like everything that comes from heaven, the Holy Spirit is described as being composed of light and fire. When it rested upon Pinchas, his face burned like a torch.Leviticus Rabbah 21, end From the day that Joseph was sold the Holy Spirit left Jacob, who saw and heard only indistinctly.Genesis Rabbah 91:6 When the Temple was destroyed and Israel went into exile, the Holy Spirit returned to heaven; this is indicated in Ecclesiastes 12:7: \\"the spirit shall return unto God\\".Ecclesiastes Rabbah 12:7 The spirit talks sometimes with a masculine and sometimes with a feminine voice, as the word ruach is both masculine and feminine, the Holy Spirit was conceived as being sometimes a man and sometimes a woman. =Individuals possessing the Holy Spirit= The Holy Spirit dwells only among a worthy generation, and the frequency of its manifestations is proportionate to the worthiness. There was no manifestation of it in the time of the Second Temple,Yoma 21b while there were many during the time of Elijah.Tosefta Sotah 12:5 According to Job 28:25, the Holy Spirit rested upon the Prophets in varying degrees, some prophesying to the extent of one book only, and others filling two books.Leviticus Rabbah 15:2 Nor did it rest upon them continually, but only for a time. The stages of development, the highest of which is the Holy Spirit, are as follows: zeal, integrity, purity, holiness, humility, fear of sin, the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit conducts Elijah, who brings the dead to life.Yerushalmi Shabbat 3c, above, and parallel passage Pious individuals act through the Holy Spirit;Tanhuma, Vayechi, 14 whoever teaches the Torah in public partakes of the Holy Spirit.Shir haShirim Rabbah 1:9, end; compare Leviticus Rabbah 35:7 When Pinchas sinned the Holy Spirit departed from him.Genesis Rabbah 60:3; Leviticus Rabbah 37:4; compare Genesis Rabbah 19:6; Pesikta 9a Abiathar was deposed from office as High Priest when he was deserted by the Holy Spirit without which the Urim and Thummin could not be consulted. In Biblical times the Holy Spirit was widespread, resting on those who, according to the Bible, displayed a propitious activity; thus it rested on Eber and (according to Joshua 2:16) even on Rahab.Seder Olam, 1; Sifre, Deuteronomy 22 It was necessary to reiterate frequently that Solomon wrote his three books (Proverbs, Shir haShirim, and Ecclesiastes) under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit,Shir haShirim Rabbah 1:6-10 because there was a continual opposition not only to the wise king personally, but also to his writings. A teacher of the Law says that probably for this reason the Holy Spirit rested upon Solomon in his old age only.Shir haShirim Rabbah 1:10, end The Holy Spirit rested not only on the children of Israel who crossed the Red Sea,Tosefta Sotah 6:2 but, toward the end of the time of the Second Temple, occasionally on common people; for \\"if they are not prophets, they are at least the sons of prophets\\".Tosefta Pesachim 4:2 The Holy Spirit is at times identified with the spirit of prophecy.Compare Seder Olam, 1, beginning; Targum Yerushalmi to Genesis 41:38, 43:14; II Kings 9:26; Isaiah 32:15, 40:13, 44:3; Shir haShirim Rabbah 1:2 Sifre remarks: \\"'I will put My words into his mouth,' means 'I put them into his mouth, but I do not speak with him face to face'; know, therefore, that henceforth the Holy Spirit is put into the mouths of the Prophets.\\"Sifre 170 (to Deuteronomy 18:18) The \\"knowledge of God\\" is the Holy Spirit.Shir haShirim Rabbah 1:9 The division of the country by lot among the tribes was likewise effected by means of the Holy Spirit.Sifre Numbers 132, p. 49a =Works inspired by the Holy Spirit= The visible results of the activity of the Holy Spirit are the books of the Bible, all of which are believed (in Jewish tradition) to have been composed under its inspiration. All the Prophets spoke \\"in the Holy Spirit\\"; and the most characteristic sign of the presence of the Holy Spirit is the gift of prophecy, in the sense that the person upon whom it rests beholds the past and the future. With the death of the last three prophets (Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi), the Holy Spirit ceased to manifest itself in Israel, and only the Bat Kol remained available to the sages.Tosefta Sotah 13:2-4, and parallels Although the Holy Spirit was not continually present, and did not rest for any length of time upon any individual, yet there were cases in which it appeared and made knowledge of the past and of the future possible.ib.; also with reference to Rabbi Akiva, Leviticus Rabbah 21:8; to Gamaliel II, Leviticus Rabbah 37:3 and Tosefta Pesachim 1:27; to Rabbi Meir, Leviticus Rabbah 9:9; etc. Frequently, in rabbinical literature, a single Biblical verse is described as having been spoken by the Holy Spirit (for example, verses in which God speaks in the first person).Sifre Numbers 86; Tosefta Sotah 9:5; Sifre Deuteronomy 355 (six times); Genesis Rabbah 75:8, 84:12; Leviticus Rabbah 4:1 [the expression \\"and the Holy Spirit cries\\" occurs five times], 14:2, 27:2; Numbers Rabbah 15:21; 17:2, end; Deuteronomy Rabbah 11, end =Non-Jews and the Holy Spirit= The opposite of the Holy Spirit is the impure spirit (ruach tum'ah; lit. \\"spirit of impurity\\"). The Holy Spirit rests on the person who seeks the Shekhinah, while the impure spirit rests upon him who seeks impurity.Sifre Deuteronomy 173, and parallel passage On the basis of II Kings 3:13, the statement is made (perhaps as a polemic against Jesus) that the Holy Spirit rests only upon a happy soul.Yerushalmi Sukkah 55a, and elsewhere Among the pagans Balaam, from being a mere interpreter of dreams, rose to be a magician and then a possessor of the Holy Spirit.Numbers Rabbah 20:7 But the Holy Spirit did not appear to him except at night, all pagan prophets being in possession of their gift only then.Numbers Rabbah 20:12 The Torah includes the Balaam section in order to show why the Holy Spirit was taken from the non-Jew‚Äîi.e., because Balaam desired to destroy a whole people without cause.Numbers Rabbah 20:1 A very ancient source explains, based on Deuteronomy 18:15, that in the Holy Land the gift of prophecy is not granted to the non-Jew or in the interest of the non-Jew, nor is it given outside the Holy Land even to Jews.Sifre, Deuteronomy 175 In the Messianic time, however, the Holy Spirit will (according to Joel ) be poured out upon all Israel; i.e., all the people will be prophets.Numbers Rabbah 15, end According to Tanna Devei EliyahuTanna Devei Eliyahu, section 4 the Holy Spirit will be poured out equally upon Jews and pagans, both men and women, freemen and slaves. Relationship to other Jewish concepts The Shekhinah ( ≈°ekƒ´nah; also Romanized Shekina(h), Schechina(h), Shechina(h)) is the English transliteration of a Hebrew word meaning \\"dwelling\\" or \\"settling\\" and denotes the dwelling or settling of the divine presence of God. This term does not occur in the Bible, and is from rabbinic literature.S. G. F. Brandon, ed., Dictionary of Comparative Religion (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1970), p. 573: \\"Shekhinah\\".

He also was the first who used the phrase \\"theory of relativity\\" for Einstein's theory of special relativity. Education He studied from 1884 until 1899 at the University of Hannover, the Johns Hopkins University, the University of Strassburg, the University of Leipzig, and the University of Bonn. In Bonn he habilitated in 1899 and taught there until 1923. In 1903 Bucherer published the first German-language book to be completely based on vector calculus. Theory of relativity Like Henri Poincar√© (1895, 1900), Bucherer (1903b) believed in the validity of the Principle of relativity, i.e. that all descriptions of electrodynamic effects should only contain the relative motion of bodies, not of the aether. However, he went a step further and even assumed the physical non-existence of the aether. Based on those ideas he developed a theory in 1906, which also included the assumption that the geometry of space is riemannian. But the theory was vaguely formulated and in 1908 Walther Ritz showed that Bucherer's theory leads to wrong conclusions with respect to electrodynamics. And contrary to Albert Einstein, he didn't connect his rejection of the aether with the relativity of space and time. In 1904 he developed a theory of electrons in which the electrons contract in the line of motion and expand perpendicular to it. Independently of him Paul Langevin developed a very similar model in 1905. The Bucherer-Langevin model was an alternative to the electron models of: *Hendrik Lorentz (1899), Henri Poincar√© (1905, 1906) and Albert Einstein (1905). in which the electrons are subjected to length contraction without expansion in the other direction * and the model of Max Abraham, in which the electron is rigid. All three models predicted an increase of the electron mass if their velocities are approaching the speed of light. The Bucherer-Langevin model was quickly abandoned, so some experimentalists tried to distinguish between Abraham's theory and the Lorentz-Einstein theory by experiment. This was done by Walter Kaufmann (1901‚Äì1905) who believed that his experiments confirmed Abraham's theory, and disproved the Lorentz-Einstein theory. But in 1908 Bucherer conducted some experiments as well, and obtained results which seem to confirm the Lorentz- Einstein theory and the principle of relativity. With exceptions like Adolf Bestelmeyer with whom Bucherer had a polemical dispute, Bucherer's experiments were regarded as decisive. But it was shown in 1938 that all those experiments of Kaufmann, Bucherer, Neumann etc. showed only a qualitative increase in mass, but were too imprecise to distinguish between the different models. This lasted until 1940, when similar experimental equipments were sufficiently accurate to confirm the Lorentz-Einstein formula, see Kaufmann‚ÄìBucherer‚ÄìNeumann experiments and Tests of relativistic energy and momentum. Bucherer (1906) was the first who used ‚Äî during some critical remarks on Einstein's theory ‚Äî the expression \\"Einsteinian relativity theory / theory of relativity\\" (\\"Einsteinsche Relativit√§tstheorie\\"). This was based on Max Planck's term \\"relative theory\\" for the Lorentz-Einstein theory. And in 1908 Bucherer himself rejected his own version of the relativity principle, and accepted the \\"Lorentz-Einstein theory\\". Later (1923, 1924), Bucherer criticized general relativity in some papers. However, this criticism was rejected because Bucherer misinterpreted Einstein's equivalence hypothesis.

Tutt was born in Yellville, Arkansas, son of Hansford Tutt, a member of a politically influential family in Marion County, Arkansas, and his first wife. When he was a boy, Tutt's family became involved in the Tutt- Everett War, during which his father and other family members were killed. Enlisting in 1862 in Company A, 27th Arkansas Infantry Regiment, Davis Tutt fought for the Confederate States of America in the Trans-Mississippi Theater during the American Civil War. At its end, he decided to go west, stopping first in Springfield, Missouri. It was there that he met Wild Bill Hickok. Despite serving on opposite sides during the war, they became friends and often gambled together. Tutt even loaned Hickok money on occasion. Historians have debated the amount, but Hickok himself stated he owed Tutt $25. The fall out between Tutt and Hickok was due to Hickok's failure to repay the money he owed, worsened by Tutt embarrassingly taking Hickok's watch as collateral. Hickok allowed Tutt to take it, but warned him to never wear it in public. To do so would be humiliating to Hickok. Unfortunately, not doing so would suggest that Tutt was afraid of Hickok. A gunfight was almost the inevitable result. History has forgotten Tutt, but the gunfight on the square in Springfield made Hickok famous. Hickok approached the square and called out Tutt. Tutt responded and the two men faced each other fearlessly. Each fired one shot. Tutt missed, but Hickok's shot was fatal. The gunfight has since become one of the best known of the Old West, has been copied many times since by Hollywood.

It was written and directed by Prathap K. Pothan. It stars Harish and Sonia in the lead roles, along with Lakshmi in a pivotal role, and Kamal Haasan in an extended guest appearance. The screenplay was written by Prathap Pothan and the dialogues were written by Khalid. It was also dubbed in Hindi using the same title Daisy.  Plot  Pradeep Menon is a troubled teenager who studies in a Boarding school in Ooty in the Nilgiris. He is regarded as a trouble- maker and is often punished by his teachers and headmaster, often severely. When beautiful Daisy Thomas joins the school, he makes fun of her on the first day, thus beginning a series of misadventures that result in more punishment for him. This brings him close to Daisy, and they are attracted to each other. Daisy understands why Pradeep is so aggressive and offers him considerable support. She is shocked to see how rude he is toward his mother, Malathi Menon, but is unable to do anything about it. She later learns the reason behind his hatred was that his mother had decided to remarry after his father's death and had started spending less time with him. Things improve considerably when Malathi is confined in a hospital and Pradeep goes to visit her, thereby improving their relationship. Pradeep starts to respond positively to Daisy's support and is all set to turn a new leaf. Then Pradeep's world is turned upside down when he witnesses Daisy in the arms of James ‚Äî a complete stranger. Shocked at this, Pradeep regresses to his self- destructive phase, alienating himself from everyone. He later learns that James is her older brother and that she is a terminally ill patient.

History19th Century= Railcar Dumper, Circa 1900 Heyl & Patterson was founded by Edmund W. Heyl and William J. Patterson in Downtown Pittsburgh, initially as a sales agency for elevator and conveyor chains and elevator buckets. This developed into supplying complete elevators and conveyors. Because it was located in the Coal Region of southwestern Pennsylvania, it was only natural to branch out into the coal industry. In 1891, Heyl & Patterson engineered its first coal breaker, upstate in Bradford, Pennsylvania. By the end of the 19th Century, Heyl & Patterson had set the industry standard for engineering and manufacturing bulk material handling equipment, such as coal tipples, coal preparation plants, pig iron casting machines and various coal cleaning and handling devices. The company was originally composed of contracting engineers, fabricators and erectors. The industries in the company's initial customer base were not only various types of coal plants, but also cement, chemical, steel, glass, blast furnaces, copper mines, ports, foundries, railroads, shipyards and public utilities. Heyl & Patterson's original place of business was a three-story building on Third Avenue in Pittsburgh. In 1894, Heyl & Patterson relocated to Market Street, but had outgrown that building by 1899 and moved to the Monongahela riverside avenue of Water Street (now called Fort Pitt Boulevard). Heyl & Patterson gained some notoriety in its early days through Patterson's marriage to Broadway star Fay Templeton, known for her performances in Gilbert and Sullivan productions. =Early 20th Century= In the early 20th Century, growth of the business and the extension of activities into new fields caused the need for increased space for machine and structural shops. In 1901, Heyl & Patterson acquired land for a manufacturing plant on Pennsylvania Avenue along the Ohio River in Allegheny City, now known as Pittsburgh's North Side. All machine work and fabrication was done at this North Works facility before materials were shipped out to construction site crews. In 1904, Heyl & Patterson pioneered the first cranes to lift entire railroad cars, as well as towers to unload barges filled with ore, coal, sand, and slag. 1905 saw the introduction of coal crushers, coke preparation plants, coal handling bridges and mine car dumpers. 1908 saw the first skip hoists and ore bridges to transfer material at steel mills. In 1924, Heyl & Patterson innovated what would become a staple of the industry - the railroad car dumper. In 1942, Heyl & Patterson received the U.S. Navy \\"E\\" Award for excellence in production achievement, for duties performed during World War II. It was only the sixth recipient since 1900. By 1950, Heyl & Patterson installations could be found in almost every industrial section of the United States and Canada, as well as South America, Europe, Asia and Australia. Though still concentrating in the field of heavy bulk material handling equipment, Heyl & Patterson initiated a diversification policy and added other products to complement its main activities. These products included several that were developed in the company's own research and development department and still others that were handled in the United States for one of Europe's leading engineering firms. As part of its diversification, Heyl & Patterson divided into two business units. The Bulk Transfer Division was formed to design, fabricate, erect, and service the machines that Heyl & Patterson had developed for the bulk material handling industry, as well as more recent product lines such as stackers, reclaimers, belt conveyors, refuse disposal cars and giant loaders for seafaring ships. The Process Division was formed to innovate fluid bed dryer technology to clean and classify coal at coal preparation plants. =Late 20th Century= By 1960, the area around Water Street had been acquired by the city via eminent domain to build the Westinghouse Building, and this necessitated an eventual move to Parkway Center in the Pittsburgh suburb of Greentree, as the very first tenant. Heyl & Patterson participated in a high-profile project for the Public Auditorium Authority of Pittsburgh - the Civic Arena. Applying technology normally used for ore bridges and other bulk material handling machines, Heyl & Patterson designed and manufactured the trucks, gear motors and 480-volt AC motor drive that opened and closed the arena roof. A total of 42 trucks mounted on 78 wheels, 30 of which were individually driven, supported and moved the six moveable sections on the largest stainless steel dome in the world. Moveable Civic Arena Roof Rolls on Wheels Designed by Heyl & Patterson In 1961, Heyl & Patterson opened its Florida Operations Division with an office and fabrication plant on Merritt Island near Cocoa Beach, Florida, at the entrance to Kennedy Space Center. Florida Operations would serve the aerospace community at Cape Canaveral, and developed a system of blast deflectors for the space program launch pads. Later in the decade, Heyl & Patterson opened a Service Center in Charleston, West Virginia as a warehouse to stock spare parts. Heyl & Patterson's North Side manufacturing plant closed in 1970, and was eventually sold to Schneider, Inc., a pipe and sheet metal fabricator. At least two of the buildings still stand, occupied by a furniture warehouse and a bus garage. The Florida Operations Division saw a decline in profits in the 1970s, following the end of the NASA Apollo Program. Attempts were made to expand the scope of its business through maintenance and construction work at the U.S. Navy's Caribbean bases, non-naval construction among the islands and Central America and construction on Merritt Island and at local power plants. It served as the field headquarters for projects in Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba, the Panama Canal Zone and the Bahamas, but was eventually sold off in 1980. As recently as 2006, a Heyl & Patterson sign still stood on the property. In 1985, Heyl & Patterson acquired Edw. Renneburg & Sons Co. of Baltimore, Maryland, a leading designer and manufacturer of energy-saving process equipment since 1874. Renneburg & Sons merged with Heyl & Patterson's Process Division to become the Renneburg Division, and the acquisition broadened Heyl & Patterson's scope of fluid bed equipment and rotary dryers, and enabled it to manufacture equipment to process chemicals, pharmaceuticals, fertilizer, metals, fish meal and food. A pilot plant testing lab facility was built in a different Greentree location, similar to one run by Renneburg, to support the new product lines. =21st Century= By the start of the 21st Century, Heyl & Patterson entered its third century of business, and was now located in the Southpointe business park in nearby Canonsburg, Pennsylvania. In 2007, the company moved to the Pittsburgh suburb of Robinson Township and then to closer to Pittsburgh, in Carnegie, PA, for its final years. The company still designs and manufactures barge unloaders, rail car dumpers, ship unloaders and other material transfer equipment, as well as engineering services and environmental processing equipment, including dryers, coolers and mixers. The company has partners and representatives all over the world, including Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, India, South Korea and Australia. As of 2010, five of the top six coal-fired power plants in the world rely on equipment from Heyl & Patterson. In 2012, Heyl & Patterson celebrated its 125th anniversary in business. On May 6, 2016, Heyl & Patterson filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. In December 2016, the Carrier Process Equipment Group (CPEG), a joint venture of Carrier Vibrating Equipment Inc. and S. Howes LLC purchased Heyl & Patterson's Renneburg Division for thermal processing. Heyl & Patterson DivisionsBulk Transfer Division= Rotary Railcar Dumper The Bulk Transfer Division designs and manufactures variations of rotary railcar dumpers, or \\"wagon tipplers,\\" which are in operation worldwide. These include rotary dumpers, C-shaped rotary (CR) dumpers, closed and open-sided turnover dumpers, and single and multiple car dumpers. They also design and manufacture rail car moving devices such as train positioners, train indexing equipment, CUB and other support equipment. Bulk Transfer also offers material handling equipment such as barge unloaders with both grab and continuous bucket designs, and related specialty machinery. =Renneburg Division= Renneburg Rotary Dryer Originally formed as the Process Division in 1955, it was renamed after the acquisition of Edw. Renneburg & Sons Co. of Baltimore, Maryland in 1985. Renneburg & Sons was founded in 1874, and was a world leader in process equipment. The Renneburg Division handles thermal processing of powders and bulk solids, as well as advanced chemical, mineral and environmental processing equipment, including fluid bed dryers and coolers, rotary dryers and coolers, calciners, agglomerators, presses and mixers. The division produces thermal processing technology that is environmentally sensitive and production-minded, tailored to the needs of the powder and bulk solids, chemical, and mineral thermal processing industries. =Aftermarket Division= Originally a separate entity known as HeylPat Technologies since 1996, the Aftermarket Division was consolidated into Heyl & Patterson in 2009. This division offers replacement parts and upgrades for both of the other divisions, whether products had been manufactured by Heyl & Patterson or other manufacturers. Their field engineers provide onsite mechanical, structural and electrical inspections, and complete engineering studies after an inspection can compare current operating realities with the original design of the equipment. DryFining In 2010, Heyl & Patterson was part of a team to be awarded with Power Engineering magazine‚Äôs 2010 Coal-Fired Project of the Year. The project, ‚ÄúDryFining,‚Äù created a new technology for coal-firing power plants that improves fuel quality, decreases volatile gas emissions, and reduces a plant‚Äôs operating expenses and maintenance costs. The team was led by electric service provider Great River Energy of Maple Grove, Minnesota, and also included the U.S. Department of Energy‚Äôs National Energy Technology Laboratory, Lehigh University‚Äôs Energy Research Center, the Electric Power Research Institute and engineering construction contractor WorleyParsons.

Founded in 2007, the organization aims to increase the quality of education through the creation of open-source digital learning activities combined with teacher training. OLE Nepal's program is currently running in fifty schools in sixteen districts in partnership with Nepal Government's Department of Education (DoE) with support from development partners including Danish Government's Local Grant Authority, United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) and Finnish Government's Funds for Local Cooperation. OLE Nepal and Nepal's DoE recently started the implementation of the One Laptop per Child (OLPC) program in fifteen schools in three new districts. Students from different classes share a set of laptops but each student has one-to-one access to laptops and digital resources during class. In addition to significant cost savings, this model makes it easier for schools and teachers to manage the programs. History In early 2007, Rabi Karmacharya and Bryan Berry left their jobs in the technology sector to launch OLE Nepal. Previously they had been part of a group of volunteers who had been meeting and discussing the possibility of leveraging the One Laptop Per Child laptops to address the challenges faced by educators in the country. They met and discussed with various educators, teachers, experts, activists, community leaders, donors, and government officials going on to form the Board of Directors, and registering the organization. In the process, they received much support from Mahabir Pun, a Nepali teacher and activist who created the Nepal Wireless Networking Project. Dr. Saurav Dev Bhatta also joined as one of the founding members when the organization was officially launched in September 2007. Current projects OLE Nepal's Information and Communication Technology (ICT) education programs are currently running in 50 schools in 16 districts across Nepal benefiting more than 10,000 students. OLE Nepal has also trained over 300 school teachers on how to integrate technology in classroom teaching/learning processes. OLE Nepal has prepared an extensive collection of interactive digital learning materials that are based on the school curricula. OLE Nepal has also developed a digital library that is installed on servers in each school. The introduction of laptops to students and teachers is accompanied by the following activities: * Development and distribution of free and open digital educational content * Preparing teachers to integrate ICT in classroom teaching * Research and development of appropriate technology and network infrastructure * Capacity development =Digital content= OLE Nepal has developed two types of digital content: E-Paath and E-Pustakalaya. E-Paath An interactive science activity in E-Paath E-Paath is a collection of subject-specific, and grade-specific digital learning materials that are conceptualized by educators and curriculum experts. These interactive educational software modules are closely aligned with the national curriculum and are designed to help teachers and students meet the learning objectives outlined in the curriculum. These activities employ various features of technology such as audio, images, animation and text to help students better understand concepts in various subjects. E-Pustakalaya E-Pustakalaya home page E-Pustakalaya is an education-centered digital library containing full-text documents, books, educational videos, audio books, and interactive educational software that can be freely accessed through an intranet or on the Internet. OLE Nepal started the development of E-Pustakalaya with the aim of improving children's reading skills and developing a reading culture in schools by giving them free and open access to age-appropriate reading materials. Users of E-Pustakalaya can browse through various sections looking for items they like, or they can search for specific items based on full or partial author name, title, publisher and/or keywords. Users can read books and documents, view videos, listen to audio clips, play educational games directly from E-Pustakalaya, and in the case of books and documents, download and store for later viewing. The E-Pustakalaya currently holds more than 4,000 titles. While these resources can be accessed online, OLE Nepal has placed special emphasis on making them available in far flung schools that do not have Internet connectivity. E-Pustakalaya is hosted on low-cost low-power servers and installed in schools and community libraries that either do not have Internet connectivity or have low bandwidth connection. =Teacher training= OLE Nepal has developed and delivered training programs to help teachers integrate laptops and digital learning materials in classroom teaching. Teachers receive eight days of training before the deployment of computers in their schools. They take part in discussions and practice teaching to build both their skills and develop their confidence in using digital resources in their class. In-School training is used as a monitoring tool to observe how much the teachers are using the materials in the classroom and what issues they have while doing so. This is conducted 4‚Äì6 weeks after the teacher training mentioned above. Refresher training is organised to help teachers to revise what they learnt in previous training. This project also gives opportunity for teachers to share their issues and lessons learned. For OLE Nepal, it is an evaluation tool to review the effectiveness of the training and discover training strategies and / or content that needs to be reviewed. =Capacity building= OLE Nepal has worked in partnership with various central and local agencies within the Ministry of Education system to ensure that they build the necessary institutional capacity to implement ICT- based education on a national level. The project has benefited from the inputs provided by government trainers, curriculum experts, district level school supervisors, resource persons and teachers. The OLPC project was implemented in partnership with the Department of Education and the District Education Offices in the program districts. The DoE and OLE Nepal have also worked together to promote awareness about ICT-based Education. Teacher trainings have been conducted with help of government trainers who were prepared in providing ICT-based Education training. OLE Nepal has consulted with subject experts from the Curriculum Development Center in the preparation and review of the E-Paath activities. OLE Nepal opts to work with and empower existing resources within the public education system instead of creating a parallel system. Deployment OLE Nepal has deployed over 4000 XO laptops with the E-Paath software to 50 schools in 16 districts in Nepal as of August 1, 2012.

The disease results in progressive sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) that acts bilaterally and asymmetrically, and sometimes affects an individual's vestibular system. AIED is used to describe any disorder in which the inner ear is damaged as a result of an autoimmune response. Some examples of autoimmune disorders that have presented with AIED are Cogan's syndrome, relapsing polychondritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, polyarteritis nodosa, Sjogren's syndrome, and Lyme disease. Research has come to the consensus that AIED is the result of antibodies or other immune cells that cause damage to structures of the inner ear such as the cochlea and vestibular system. Of note, AIED is the only known SNHL that responds to medical treatment, but withholding treatment for longer than three months may result in permanent hearing loss and the need for cochlear implant installation. Although AIED has been studied extensively over the past 25 years, no clear mechanism of pathogenesis has emerged. A recent paper performed a literature review of all relevant articles dating back to 1980, and proposed a mechanism of pathogenesis which includes an inflammatory response and immune cell attack on inner ear structures. This response leads to an over-activation of other immune cells such as T helper cells, resulting in vascular changes and cochlear harm. AIED appears to be a consequence of damaged sensorineural hearing due to electrochemical disturbances, microthrombosis, and immune cell deposition. Additionally, self-reactive antibodies and T-cells contribute to the aforementioned damage. Research has suggested a valuable next step in uncovering AIED pathogenesis is inquiry into the role of interleukin-1Œ≤ (IL-1Œ≤). Signs and symptoms Signs and symptoms of AIED are: *Progressive hearing loss in both ears **Typically will begin in one ear and gradually affect the other **Hearing loss may begin suddenly *Tinnitus (ringing or buzzing in ears) *Decrease in word recognition capability *Loss of balance (vestibular symptoms) **Degree of balance loss can change throughout the course of the disease Causes AIED is generally caused by either antibodies or immune cells that cause damage to the inner ear. There are several theories that propose a cause of AIED: *Bystander damage ‚Äì Physical damage to the inner ear may lead to cytokine release that signals for an immune response. This may be a component of the \\"attack/remission cycle\\" of Meniere's disease. *Cross- reactions ‚Äì Accidental damage of the inner ear by antibodies or T-cells that recognize an inner ear antigen that is similar to a bacterial or viral antigen *Genetic factors ‚Äì Predisposition to developing an autoimmune disorder based on genes inherited *Intolerance ‚Äì The immune system may not be aware of all the antigens present in the inner ear until physical damage releases some of these antigens. As a result, the immune system treats these unfamiliar antigens as foreign and mounts an immune response. Currently, the cross- reactions theory appears to be the favored mechanism of AIED pathogenesis. Diagnosis Since AIED symptoms are fairly common to many hearing loss disorders, it may be difficult to diagnose AIED without performing multiple medical tests. Some examples of these tests include: * Hearing Tests for Progressive Hearing and Balance loss ** Audiometry (measure of hearing acuity and sound intensity) ** Rotatory Chair Test (determines if inner ear is responsible for balance loss) ** Electrocochleography (ECOG) (recording of electrical potential in inner ear due to sound) * Blood Tests for General Autoimmune Diseases ** Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (test for inflammation) ** Rheumatoid Factor (indicator of autoimmune disorders) There are also blood tests specific to inner ear disorders: * Anti-cochlear antibody test (testing for antibodies against cochlear cells) * Lymphocyte Transformation Assay (testing whether an individual has developed a T-cell response against a certain drug) Though it has also been proposed that the use of anti heat shock protein 70 antibodies may be useful in the detection and diagnosis of AIED, there is not enough evidence to confirm the reliability of this method. Treatment AIED treatment is a rapidly changing field. Several medical therapies have been proposed in the treatment of AIED, with corticosteroid therapy being the most effective. However, corticosteroid therapy (specifically with prednisone and dexamethasone) has demonstrated limited effectiveness in some patients, suggesting the need for novel treatment methods. The goal of most AIED treatments is to administer corticosteroids over a certain period of time, re-evaluate hearing at each appointment, and eventually taper off corticosteroid administration. Ideally, patients can be tapered off with hearing fully recovered, though this is the least likely outcome. Often, tumor necrosis factor-Œ± (TNF-Œ±) inhibitors must be administered alongside corticosteroids to achieve a favorable outcome and eventual end to corticosteroid treatment. Recent papers have indicated that the TNF-Œ± inhibitor, infliximab, has the potential to allow for sustained patient improvement and alleviation of symptoms. Cytotoxic agents such as cyclophosphamide and methotrexate have been used in AIED treatment in the past; however, findings have suggested limited symptom alleviation from these drugs.

Political activism Foster Friess in Yellow Slicker 2012 Wisconsin primary Friess has been an active patron of religious and conservative causes. He donated $250,000 to Rick Santorum's re-election campaign in 2006, and at least that amount to the Republican Governors' Association.Isikoff, Michael, \\"Wealthy Wyoming investment fund manager bankrolling pro-Santorum Super PAC\\", NBC News, January 4, 2012. He was instrumental in keeping the political campaign of 2012 presidential hopeful Rick Santorum alive by financing a super PAC, the Red, White and Blue Fund, which ran television advertisements on behalf of Santorum, who was unable to run a television campaign with his own funds.Chrystia Freeland, Plutocrats: The Rise of the New Global Super-Rich and the Fall of Everyone Else, New York: The Penguin Press, 2012, p. 246 According to campaign filings with the Federal Election Commission, Friess's contributions to the Red, White and Blue Fund amounted to more than 40% of its total assets, or $331,000 as of December 31, 2011. In the wake of the 2012 New Hampshire Republican primary, and before the South Carolina primary, Friess told Politico that he was \\"putting together a challenge grant to encourage other wealthy donors to give to the Red, White and Blue Fund, ... he said [the fund] received a $1 million check\\" the day after the New Hampshire vote.Kenneth P.

The million- dollar donation was conveyed in four checks between November 2011 and January 2012. In addition to Santorum's faith, pro-life stance, and hawkish foreign policy leanings, the possibility of defeating incumbent President Barack Obama was a major component of Friess's decision to back Santorum's campaign. Friess reportedly considered major contributions to American Crossroads, the Superpac founded by Republican National Committee chair Ed Gillespie and former George W. Bush White House strategist Karl Rove.Molly Redden, \\"Pac Man: An eccentric Republican billionaire contemplates his next move\\", The New Republic, February 8, 2012. Retrieved April 21, 2018.

At one of the semi-annual, private seminars held by the Koch brothers in June 2011, Friess was recognized for his donation exceeding $1 million to the Kochs' political activities. While being interviewed by NBC correspondent Andrea Mitchell regarding contraception, Friess said, \\"And this contraceptive thing, my gosh, it's so ‚Äì it's such ‚Äì inexpensive, you know, back in my days, they used Bayer Aspirin for contraception.

Friess sponsored a matching grant program to raise $2 million for relief efforts for the 2004 Indonesian tsunami and traveled to the areas most affected by the earthquake and tsunami in order to speak with local church and organization leaders to identify the best efforts to support. He sponsored another matching grant for Hurricane Katrina relief efforts, raising more than $4 million. He supported a YMCA development in Maryvale, Arizona, along with several local mentoring and ministry programs. He is the principal donor behind the Friess Family Community Campus, a $3.7 million complex equipped with football, baseball, softball fields, and a track at Rice Lake High School in his hometown. Foster also gained fame when news of his 70th birthday party spread. At the lavish event he announced he would give one charity nominated by his guests $70,000.

Stagnation followed, and after the Moldavian SSR became independent in 1991, the industry almost completely disappeared. History 1897-1939 The beginnings of Moldovan cinema are difficult to trace, owing largely to the divergent cinematic histories of the left- and right-bank regions, a division which continues today. From 1897 to 1927, film production in Moldova was sparse and remains mostly undocumented. After Bessarabia, now part of Moldova‚Äôs current territorial boundaries, was absorbed into Romania in 1918, the USSR created the Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (MASSR) on the left bank of the Dniester River in 1924. This newly created Soviet republic included land taken from Ukraine as well as modern-day Transnistria, a breakaway region that remains unrecognized by any UN-member nations. At that time, the USSR attempted to modernize and Sovietize the MASSR, which included cryrillicizing the Romanian language, industrializing the region, and educating many of the MASSR‚Äôs film professionals at the Odessa State College of Cinematography in neighboring Ukraine. Most of the films produced by these early Moldovan film professions were documentary works, most of which were propaganda films, such as Protest Rally: Remember Bessarabia (1928), The Bessarabian Agricultural Community (1928), and Five Years of the MASSR (1928). However, the 1928 documentary Everything is Quiet is the most noteworthy film from this period and included an entirely Moldovan film crew. Despite these efforts, the region never had its own national film studio. Throughout the MASSR‚Äôs existence, the Moldovan film industry and Ukrainian film industry were almost one and the same: in 1930, the USSR created the Moldovan cinematography department at UkraFilm, which change its title in 1934 and, again, in 1936. Additionally, many film workers involved with these early MASSR productions were Ukrainian. 1939-1952 In the right-bank region, filmmaking in Bessarabia was virtually nonexistent since its cinematic identity was bound up with that of Romania‚Äôs, which, due to devastation occasioned by World War I, was progressing at a modest pace. After the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact in 1939, which effectively ceded Bessarabia to the USSR, the Soviet army invaded Bessarabia and took control of the region. From 1940 to 1944, Bessarabia experienced its biggest in the field of cinema since 1918. Several Russian-language films were subtitled in the Romanian language, and Soviet filmmakers began producing documentaries and newsreels about the region, such as On the Danube. This cinematic growth came to an end, though, when Nazi Germany and Romania, which had recently aligned itself with the Axis Powers, moved into Bessarabia and crossed the Dniester River into modern day Transnistria. Afterwards, all soviet republics‚Äô film industries were enlisted into the war effort and, like the film industries of the Allied Powers, produced documentaries and newsreels about the USSR‚Äôs military activities. After the USSR recaptured Bessarabia and Transnistria, both regions were devastated by the war. Chi≈üinƒÉu, the capital city of Moldova, was almost entirely destroyed from the bombing campaigns. But the Bessarabian region also faced additional hurdles, as noted by Leonid Brezhnev: Because it was not part of the USSR during the 1920s, Bassarabia remained undeveloped in comparison with its Soviet counterparts. Hence, rapid collectivization and sovietization followed the Second World War. Although there were efforts to cultivate a Moldovan film culture in this period‚ÄîRussian-language films continued to be subtitled in Romanian, the government published soviet newsreels focusing on Moldova, etc.‚Äîthe cinematic situation remained stagnant until the 1950s. 1952-1970 On April 26, 1952, after much planning, the USSR Ministry of Cinematography created the Documentary Film Studio in Chi≈üinƒÉu. During the first year two documentaries, Kodry and Moldovan Cannery appeared. However, these films, like those of the MASSR, lacked a distinctly Moldovan identity. The directors working in Moldova at this point were from Moscow and Odessa, in part because there were no trained Moldovan film professionals. Between 1952 and 1957, six documentaries were screened. Afterwards, more Moldovan filmmakers began to participate in local productions, which caused the MSSR to take an increased interest in the state's role in developing a national film culture. To that end, on January 24, 1957, the MSSR Council of Ministers renamed the national film studio the \\"Studio for Fiction Movies and Chronicle Documentaries from Chi≈üinƒÉu,\\" also known as \\"Moldova-Film\\". Moldova-Film was far more productive than its predecessor. Funded by the State, Moldova-Film turned out 160 feature films, 1,500 documentaries and educational shorts, and over 100 animated films between 1957 and 1992. A few years later, in 1967, the MSSR founded Telefilm Chi»ôinƒÉu, which, like Moldova-Film, received state funding and was similarly productive, producing over 300 documentaries, music videos, and telefilms during its existence. It was during this period that many notable Moldovan filmmakers began receiving training at VGIK in Moscow and returning to Moldova to shoot films in their home country. This allowed Moldovan cinema to develop a distinct identity. During Khruschev's thaw, which ushered increased liberties in artistic expression, Moldovan filmmakers such as Emil Loteanu and Valeriu Gagiu produced films which comprised the ‚ÄúMoldovan Poetic Film,‚Äù a genre which fused realism with romance and enjoyed wide appeal in the USSR. However, as in the rest of the Soviet republics, the state exercised a considerable influence in the content of these films, and with the rise of Leonid Brezhnev as First Secretary came a resurgence of official censorship. Socialist Realism, once de rigueur under Stalin‚Äôs leadership, became, again, the artistic model for film professions; and critiques of Soviet history were vehemently disfavored by party leaders. For instance, Valeriu Gagiu‚Äôs A Taste of Bread (1966), about Moldovan resistance during Stalin‚Äôs tight-fisted agricultural collectivization policies after the Second World War, elicited outrage from party leaders, despite the film‚Äôs enthusiastic reception at film festivals. Hence, in keeping with the state‚Äôs systematic suppression of Moldovan cinema and culture, the Central Committee of the Moldovan Communist Party banned the film in 1970. Other Moldovan films suffered similar fates. 1970-1990 During the post-Thaw era of the 1970s, characterized by stagnation, studios continued to curtail artistic freedoms, though there were a few artistic successes at this time, such as Emil Loteanu‚Äôs LƒÉutarii (1972) and Gypsies Are Found near Heaven (1976). But by the 1980s, perestroika and glasnost occasioned a resurgence of artistic freedom and impressive Moldovan films, like Valeriu Jereghi‚Äôs Iona (1987), Gheorghe Urschi‚Äôs Whoever Swears, He Pays (1989), and Victor BucƒÉtaru‚Äôs Crucifix (1990). =Filmography= In 1957, the first fiction comedy film was called C√Ænd omul nu-i la locul lui (When the man is not himself) after a script written by Ion Druta. In 1968, the first cartoon film, The Goat with Three Kids, was released, a film inspired by Ion Creanga's fairy-tale with the same title. In 1972, the satirical series Usturici appeared. Between 1952 and 1982, 120 fiction movies, 800 documentaries, 750 editions of the cinema magazine Soviet Moldova, 40 editions of Usturici and 40 cartoons were filmed at the Moldova-Film studio. It also dubbed 12 fiction movies and 70 short stories annually by the end of the 1980s. A cinema was built in the beginning of the 1950s in the center of Chi≈üinƒÉu, which is now part of the Moldovan \\"Patria\\" chain. International recognition The first internationally acclaimed success was the film of Moldovan producer Mihail Kalik - Lullaby (), released in 1960 at Moldova-Film studios. The movie was awarded the \\"Prize for Participation\\" at the international cinema competition at the Locarno International Film Festival, bringing attention to the emergent Moldovan film industry. Another international success was Man Is Walking After the Sun (Man Is Following the Sun ), written by Valeriu Gagiu and Mihail Kalik. The world press compared this movie to the Albert Lamorisse movie Le Ballon Rouge, where, just as in the Moldovan movie, the main hero was a little boy. Vadim Derbenev, the cameraman, was awarded the special jury diploma at the International Cinema Festival in Helsinki for his work. Another one of the first Moldovan films was the Ataman of Codru (), which enjoyed success in Asia and Latin America. The viewers called the movie Ataman Kadyr. The Moldovan breakthrough in the world's cinema industry was a film written by Ion Dru≈£ƒÉ and producer and cameraman Vadim Derbenev - Last Month of Autumn (). The film received prizes at the Mar del Plata Film Festival, including the \\"Sympathy Prize of Viewers\\". Evgueniy Lebedev was awarded the main prize of the festival - the \\"Big Southern Cross\\" - in the best male role nomination. La Naci√≥n described the film as a \\"remarkably beautiful work\\". La Prensa wrote \\"This film, amongst all the mess that flooded the cinema world invites us to the sources of the true reachess of life\\". Besides appraisal in Argentina, the movie was awarded the Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival in 1966. At the International Film Festival Kino Pavasaris in Vilnius, the director Vadim Derbenev won \\"Best Production\\". However, in Vilnius, the film was awarded only the second main film prize, the first place being taken by Vytautas ≈Ωalakeviƒçius's film Nobody Wanted to Die (). LƒÉutarii by Emil Loteanu (producer Vitaliy Kalashnikov, composer Eugen Doga) was a success, particularly in Italy. The movie received four prizes, including the \\"Prize of Viewers' Sympathy\\" and the second main prize \\"Silver Shell\\". Norwegian newspaper Arbeiterbladet compared the Moldovan movie to the Broadway musical The Sound of Music. Czech weekly Film a Divadlo wrote \\"Every nation expresses to the best its deepest feelings, but the Moldovan one did it the best\\". In 1975, the movie won in the category of \\"Best Foreign Film\\", leaving behind traditional Hollywood productions. During the week of Soviet Cinema in Naples, the film was awarded the \\"Silver Nymph\\". Red Meadows by Emil Loteanu was also another major Moldovan success at the Locarno International Film Festival. Rom√¢nia LiberƒÉ highlighted the symbolism of this art work, which made it an unforgettable sight\\". Very few films have been made in Moldova since independence: the government has failed to protect its domestic industry and funding is rare (save for occasional co-productions). The country also has the world's second-lowest cinema attendance rate.Steve Kokker and Cathryn Kemp. Romania & Moldova, p.35.

The two eldest girls had died the preceding year and the four surviving children were 6 to 10 years old; they made the soldiers the centre of their imaginative life and their childhood literary efforts. Plot summary Max is an eight-year-old boy whose family has just moved into an old farmhouse in Yorkshire. He discovers some old toy soldiers in the attic and is surprised and delighted to find that they come to life. The soldiers, known as the Twelves, or the Young Men, have different personalities; they are brave, intelligent and very independent, not to mention argumentative. They adopt Max as one of their Genii, or protective spirits, and he begins to spend most of his time watching and thinking about them. He learns from the local parson that they once belonged to the Bront√´s, who wrote stories about their adventures. When his older sister Jane discovers the secret, she becomes as keen on the soldiers as Max is. The local newspaper publishes a letter about the Bront√´ wooden soldiers, from an American professor offering ¬£5,000 (at the time a small fortune) to anyone who finds them. Max and Jane's older brother Philip believes the Morley soldiers may be the Bront√´ ones, and impulsively writes to the professor about them ‚Äì only to deeply regret his act when he too discovers the truth. The soldiers learn that they are in danger of being taken to America and disappear in the night. The children have some anxious moments before they discover that the soldiers have determined to return to their original home in Haworth, now a museum dedicated to the Bront√´s. Their march across the countryside is fraught with peril, but they finally reach safe haven with the protection of the Genii.

Henry S. Lane (1811- 1881) and Joanna Lane (1826-1914). It is located at 212 South Water Street in Crawfordsville, Indiana. Helen Elston Smith, the Lanes' niece, inherited the house after Joanna's death. She willed the house and its contents to the Montgomery County Historical Society on February 26, 1931. 85%-90% of all of the furnishings are either original to the house or belonged to the Elston Family. The house has been a museum since 1931 even though Helen continued to live in the home until the mid-1930s. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1981. It is located in the Elston Grove Historic District. History The Lane Place was added onto an existing three-room brick cottage, which was built in 1831 by Maria and Isaac Elston. Major Isaac Elston was the father of Joanna Lane, Henry's second wife. Sen. Henry Lane purchased this cottage and the surrounding it from Isaac Elston in the fall of 1844 when he and Joanna Elston married. Susan Wallace, the sister of Joanna Lane, met her future husband Lew Wallace at a party that was taking place in the house's formal parlor. Sen. Henry Lane was a lawyer and prominent Indiana politician who served in the Indiana legislature and the House of Representatives while with the Whigs. He was then elected Governor of Indiana in 1860 on the Republican ticket, but was soon elected as a Senator instead and served a term between 1861-67. In 1865 he was the Indiana delegate at Lincoln's funeral. In addition, Sen. Lane was one of the leading men to help form the Republican Party. Additions to the Lane Place As soon as Henry Lane purchased the three room cottage in 1844 the house was too small for his bride and himself. Henry and Joanna were married in February and 1845 and then moved into the cottage where they immediately began adding onto their home. The first addition were two rooms onto the front of the cottage, and two more rooms were added on top of those rooms. The parlor of the cottage was converted into the Lane's Dining Room. The new addition was not connected to the original cottage at this time. In 1870 a Library was added onto the first floor. The 1831 kitchen was converted into a Serving Pantry and a kitchen was added onto the rear of the Pantry. In 1885 Helen Elston Smith came to live with the Lane's and another bedroom was added onto the second story of the house. There was also a porch added onto the first and second story of the house on the north side. The roof of the original sleeping loft was raised and converted into two rooms. In 1900 the breezeway between the old cottage and new editions was enclosed. House Colors The house has been painted various colors since 1845. The Lane Place was painted white through all the additions to the house while Henry and Joanna lived at the property. After Henry's death on June 18, 1881, Joanna painted the house gray in mourning. The house was temporarily painted pink under Helen's ownership from around 1914 to 1920. In 1920 the house was painted yellow. The house remained yellow until 1945 when The Montgomery County Historical Society decided to return it to white. The house has remained white since then. Strawberry Festival The grounds of the Lane are the home of the Annual Crawfordsville Strawberry Festival. The Strawberry Festival was started by Joanna as a social gathering for drinking tea. It is held every year in June.

Retrieved 17 June 2008 from andrea.testname.googlepages.com  Biography  Born in 1920 in Kendallville, Indiana, Meier grew up the oldest of five children in a family of modest means. His father was a German-American Lutheran schoolteacher, choirmaster, and organist. His mother became seriously ill shortly after the birth of her youngest child, and much of the running of the household fell to young Meier.Kathleen Maclay (2007) IN MEMORIAM Richard Meier 1920-2007. Office of Public Affairs, University of California. He earned a bachelor's degree in chemistry from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1940, and a master's and a doctorate in organic chemistry from UCLA.\\"Richard Louis Meier, 86; expert on sustainable planning\\". Los Angeles Times April 6, 2007. Meier earned his Ph.D. in organic chemistry at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in 1944. During World War II, Meier worked as a Standard Oil research chemist in Richmond, California. Even before taking his Ph.D. in organic chemistry at University of California at Los Angeles in 1944, Meier made his mark as a generalist and futurist, persuading the newly established department to teach leading-edge developments in nuclear chemistry and physics. Meier began talking with Berkeley scientists about the post-war implications of atomic energy and weapons. He founded along with his colleagues, what is now called, the Federation of American Scientists, a non- profit organization focused on consolidating scientific knowledge to aid national interests.\\"Professor Emeritus, an Authority on Sustainability, Dies at 86\\". By Vincent Quan. The Daily Californian. Monday, April 9, 2007. During a Fulbright Fellowship in Manchester, England, in 1949-50, Meier shifted his attention to technological solutions for the problems of the world's biggest and poorest cities. As early as 1951, he convinced a University of Chicago colleague, the New Deal ‚Äúbrain-truster‚Äù Rexford Tugwell, of the inevitability of Meier's forecasts. These included a long list of developments, among them the radical improvement of communications using ultra fax and television devices, more effective antibiotics, and ‚Äúadvances toward technological oneness in the world ... followed by tighter organization and by holistic planning devices,‚Äù Tugwell said. Between 1950 and 1956, he taught in the University of Chicago's influential Program of Education and Research in Planning. End 1950s he was among the first members of the Society for General Systems Research. Between 1957 and 1967, he first was a research social scientist in the Mental Health Research Institute at the University of Michigan, focusing on systems theory. At Michigan, Meier and Kenneth Boulding were colleagues, they bounced ideas off each other, and Meier had enormous respect for him. Later he became professor in Michigan's School of Natural Resources, Department of Conservation. Meier moved to the University of California, Berkeley in 1967, and helped establish the new doctoral program in the Department of City and Regional Planning (DCRP). For more than 35 years, he was a faculty member in the Departments of Architecture, Landscape Architecture, and City and Regional Planning in the College of Environmental Design at the University of California, Berkeley. In retirement, Meier continued teaching, writing, and generating new ideas, despite increasing disabilities. His final book \\"Ecological Planning, Management and Design\\" published online in 2003,Richard L. Meier (2003). Ecological Planning, Management and Design. Online manuscript of his final work at berkeley.edu. laid out many of his strategies for creating sustainable communities, particularly for the urban poor in developing countries.

The prize is one of three awards given as part of the J. Anthony Lukas Book Prize administered by the Nieman Foundation for Journalism and by the Columbia University School of Journalism. The prize is named in honor of Mark Lynton, a refugee from Nazi Germany, Second World War officer, and automobile industry executive. In 1939 Lynton was a Jewish German-born student, studying history at Cambridge when he and other German nationals were rounded up and interned in detention camps in England and Canada as enemy aliens, suspected of being Nazi sympathizers. When Lynton was released he joined the British Army, became a tank commander, and was later promoted to Major in the occupying force, Army of the Rhine, where he helped interrogate high-ranking Nazi officers. Lynton memorialized his odyssey in his memoir, Accidental Journey: A Cambridge Internee's Memoir of World War II. The prize was established by his wife, Marion, children, Lili and Michael, and grandchildren, Lucinda, Eloise Lynton and Maisie Lynton, to honor Lynton who was an avid reader of history. The Lynton family has underwritten the Lukas Prize Project since its inception in 1998.

It is contrasted to a point-to-point ticket in that it allows the holder unlimited travel, within the pre-designated area and period, while a point-to-point ticket only permits the holder to travel from a point to another once. It is different from a season ticket in the sense that, while both of them grant unlimited travel to the holder, season tickets normally target commuting travellers, whereas rail passes usually target tourists. Based on this difference, terms of use are thus normally set differently. The first rail pass was issued as the Eurail pass in March 1959. Owing to its success, many other passes have been issued by various railway companies all around the world since then. Type of rail pass Rail passes are issued according to different terms of use. =Continuous pass and Flexipass= There are two ways of counting the valid period of a rail pass. A continuous pass counts the days or months continuously. For example, a 15-day pass is valid for 15 continuous calendar days starting from the day of validation and a one-month pass is valid for a calendar month (so if it is used in February, it is valid only for 28/29 days, contrasted to the 30-day valid period when using a 30-day pass). As continuous pass might not be useful to all travellers, as many of them do not travel everyday, there exists also the flexipass, which allows the holder to only pay for the days they travel. For instance, when a traveller buy a tem-day-in-one- month flexipass, the pass is valid for one month, and he can pick whichever ten days within the valid period to travel with the pass. This gives extra flexibility to the holders. Usually the holder would need to fill in the date he travels on the pass before boarding on the train. =Area= Some countries offer a country pass to travellers such that they could take most of the trains in the country (e.g. BritRail Pass, Japan Rail Pass, Indrail Pass, Korea Rail Pass, etc.). But some countries offer cross-countries rail pass such that pass holders can travel on trains within the designated countries, even crossing the border (e.g. Eurail pass and Interrail). Some countries offer passes which are valid only within certain areas of the country (e.g. JR West Rail Pass, JR Kyushu Rail Pass, etc.). Sometimes, if the train passes through areas where the pass is not valid, travellers would need to pay for that section of the route. For example, if one gets a pass that is valid in Spain and Italy, and would like to take a train from Spain to Italy passing through France, he may need to pay for the French section. =Concession and group pass= Some countries offer concession pass to youth (e.g. age below 26) or elderly. And some other offer group passes, allowing two or more persons to travel together with a lower price (though some may require that all named persons must be travelling together). Concession pass might get more restrictions. For example, one can travel on the Tze-Chiang Limited Express, the fastest train operated by the Taiwan Railways Administration, with the normal TR Pass but not with the Student Pass. =Class= Some passes allow the traveller to travel with both first and second class, but some are restricted to travel in the second-class only, although some might be offered with the option to travel in first-class by paying a supplement. =Type of trains= There could be limitation on the types of trains that one can ride with the rail pass. For example, high-speed trains are excluded in some countries (e.g. TR Pass), and in some other, one can travel on them by paying supplement (e.g. France RailPass). Passengers with a Japan Rail Pass can ride on the Shinkansen, the high-speed railway in Japan. However, they cannot take Nozomi and Mizuho trains, the fastest train services on the T≈çkaid≈ç, San'y≈ç and Ky≈´sh≈´ Shinkansen lines. =Sleeping / Couchette car= In some countries, rail pass holders can travel on sleeper or couchette compartment freely, while some may need to pay some extra fee or are totally restricted from taking sleeper or couchette trains. =Seat reservation= Some pass allow the holders to make seat reservation on trains freely, while some require the holders to pay a supplement. Bonus As tourists are the typical target group of rail passes, there may be bonus discounts in certain sightseeing spots, by showing a rail pass within the valid period. In order to enjoy the discount, some flexipasses require the holder to spend a travel day - fill-in that date on the pass - while others do not; some of the passes also cover the cost of travelling by certain buses, ferries or cable cars. Difference from season ticket A rail pass is different from a season ticket: the former is generally marketed to tourists while the latter is usually marketed to commuters. The terms of use and purchase are set accordingly. Very often, rail passes cannot be used by the local citizens and might not even be available for purchase within their area of use. Another difference is the term of the pass: while it is difficult to find rail pass valid for more than three months, it is common to find season ticket valid for a whole year. Designed for commuting, some season tickets are valid for only one route, while a rail pass is usually valid for an entire area.

The organization focuses on children‚Äôs rights advocacy for shared parenting, the prevention of child abuse and alternative dispute resolution. CRC also run parental access centers where children can spend supervised time with their non-custodial parents and where transfers between parents can occur in a monitored environment. The organization was founded in 1985 by David L Levy, and it is headquartered in Landover, Maryland in the Washington D.C. metropolitan area.Children‚Äôs Rights Council, Home page Activities CRC promotes legislation that works to benefit children through shared parenting. Seeking legislative reform, the organization advocates joint physical custody. CRC also manages 26 Child Access Centers in 11 different states which provide supervised access and visitation of children and serve as safe transfer points for children who are moving from the custody of one parent to another. In addition, CRC conducts research and submits testimony to Congress in regard to the well being of children. The organization's primary focus is to minimize the emotional, physical and economic abuse, neglect and distress of children and the development of at-risk behaviors following relationship breakups between separated, divorce, or never-married parents who are highly conflicted. In 1995, Cynthia L. Ewing testified as a Legal Analyst for CRC that states which had the most \\"intact\\" families had, for the most part, the highest rankings of children's wellness. Goals In support of this commitment to children, CRC has established a set of social goals based on program utilization of the Both Parents Approach model to help highly conflicted parents better cooperate and collaborate in the best interests of their children following break-up of the family. CRC's advocacy and program goals are designed to accomplish the following: Mitigate the long-term damaging effects to children caused by divorce and relationship break-ups; Reduce total children at risk from developing harmful and destructive behaviors; Encourage non-custodial parents to remain emotionally & financially supportive of their child(ren); Advocate increased opportunities for access to non-custodial parents; and Decrease the nature, burden and expense of legal disputes and court interventions caused by persistent parental conflict. Supporters Supporters of Children's Rights Council are from a broad spectrum of backgrounds and from a number of diverse fields. CRC has received donations from celebrities such as Jamie Farr and David Brenner. CRC's former honorary president was Lady Catherine Meyer, Catherine Meyer the wife of the British Ambassador to the U.S., Christopher Meyer.

It is home to the Defence and National Rehabilitation Centre (DNRC). History The manor of Stanford, complete with its stone manor house, was sold in 1661 by the Raynes family to a London alderman, Thomas Lewes (died c. 1702). He was succeeded by his grandson Francis Lewis (c. 1692 ‚Äì 1744), who was an MP and High Sheriff of Nottinghamshire for 1713‚Äì14. The estate then passed to the fourth and last generation of Leweses, Charles Lewes, who died with no heir. After him it passed by marriage to the Dashwood family, of whom the first to occupy the property was Charles Vere Dashwood. He commissioned William Anderson of Loughborough to rebuild the house in brick between 1771 and 1774. The house is constructed in red brick with ashlar dressings, with a hipped slate roof topped with a painted balustrade, built in two storeys with a 7 bay frontage. It then descended in the Dashwood family to Charles Lewes Dashwood, who sold it in 1887 to Richard Ratcliff, a brewer from Burton-on-Trent. Ratcliff employed the local architect W.H. Fletcher to make substantial changes to the house, which included building new 2 storey wings flanking the main block and a new service wing. The house passed on his death in 1898 to his son, also Richard, By 1928 the owner was Richard Snr.'s granddaughter Kathleen, who had married Lawrence Kimball. =Sir Julien Cahn= In 1928 Sir Julien Cahn purchased the Hall from the Kimballs for ¬£70,000 (equivalent to ¬£ as of ). The sea lion pool at Stanford Hall The theatre at Stanford Hall The remains of the lido at Stanford Hall Here Cahn commissioned the architect Percy Morley Horder to build a cricket pitch, nine-hole golf course, bowling green, large trout lake, sea lion pool, penguin pool,sea lion and penguin pools lido, tennis court and thatched pavilion, an enormous outdoor heated swimming pool with coral walls holding fountains and artificial caves added to the fantastic wooded parkland and formal gardens. The largest addition was a theatre designed by Cecil Aubrey Masey built in 1937 for ¬£73,000 (equivalent to ¬£ as of ) which seated 352 people. The walls were decorated with murals by Beatrice MacDermott. It comprised a raked auditorium, orchestra pit and Wurlitzer organ which can be raised and lowered during performances. The organ was made for Th√©√¢tre de la Madeleine, Paris. It was purchased by Sir Julien Cahn for ¬£20,000 and enlarged when it was installed. The house was extensively remodelled over the next decade under the direction of Sir Charles Allom, principal of arguably the finest of the large interior decorating concerns, White Allom Ltd. Together with Queen Mary, Sir Charles advised on the redecoration of Buckingham Palace and had many multi-millionaire clients, such as Henry Clay Frick, whose Fifth Avenue town house now houses the Frick Collection and whose decoration by White Allom is highly regarded. The same is true of Stanford Hall. Stanford Hall retains most of the superb interior structures and installations of Cahn's day, though most of the art moderne marble bathrooms were removed in the 1960s. The furnishings selected with Sir Charles Allom were of the highest quality. The inclusion of many fine antiques, and the theming of the rooms by date and country gave the impression of a house that had evolved over time. By 1940 it was one of the finest and most luxurious of small country houses in the United Kingdom. Cahn died in the White Allom panelled library in 1944, when part of the house was being used for the rehabilitation of wounded soldiers. =Bomber crash= In 1941 a Blenheim bomber crashed onto the cricket pitch in foggy conditions; no one died in the incident.Loughborough Echo 3 February 2012 Page 63 =Co-operative College= The hall was purchased for ¬£54,000 in 1945 (equivalent to ¬£ as of ), by the Co-operative Union to house its Co-operative College. =Raynsway Properties 2001‚Äì2007= The Co-operative College relocated to Holyoake House in Manchester in 2001 and sold Stanford Hall to Raynsway Properties, who planned to convert it into luxury apartments and also build a 147 Bedroom hotel in the grounds. =Chek Whyte 2007‚Äì2011= In March 2007 the Hall was sold by Leicester-based Raynsway Properties for ¬£6.25 million to Chek Whyte Industries, who planned to convert it and built a ¬£60m retirement village within the grounds.Nottingham Evening Post Tuesday February 17, 2009, front page & page 7 In March 2009, the grounds hosted the English schools cross country championships. In October 2009, after the fall in property prices because of the recession, Chek Whyte obtained an Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA) in order to avoid bankruptcy. =Defence and National Rehabilitation Centre (DNRC)= In October 2011 the Hall and its grounds were purchased on behalf of Gerald Grosvenor, 6th Duke of Westminster as a potential site for a ‚ÄòDefence and National Rehabilitation Centre‚Äô (DNRC). The Duke, who served in the Territorial Army since the age of 20 and was committed to supporting military welfare, led a major donor fund raising campaign to cover the capital costs of the Defence element of the proposed new establishment. On 13 June 2013, Rushcliffe Borough Council \\"resolved to grant planning permission... for the redevelopment of the Stanford Hall estate as the potential site for the DNRC\\". On the 10 July 2014 HM Government announced that it had granted approval for the establishment of DNRC at Stanford Hall.http://www.stanfordhallredevelopment.org.uk/ Stanford Hall Estate Redevelopment Work started on the ¬£300m three-year project on 24 August 2015.What‚Äôs happening on site The 7th Duke of Westminster handed over the DNRC facility to the Nation at a Gifting Ceremony held on the Estate on 21 June 2018.

ProgramsNEOintern= NEOintern consists of a free online database where college students anywhere and organizations in Northeast Ohio can find each other for internships and co-ops. NOCHE program managers also present \\"Maximize Your ROI: Return On Intern\\" total internship and co-op management seminars for business and nonprofit leaders, human resource managers and internship/co-op coordinators. =Northeast Ohio Talent Dividend= The Northeast Ohio Talent Dividend is guided by a steering committee of business, education, civic, nonprofit and philanthropic stakeholders and an Action Plan with overarching goals to improve college readiness, increase retention to degree completion and increase degree attainment among adults with some college and no degree. On Wednesday, December 4, 2013, at Cultivating Our Talent, the 2013 Northeast Ohio Talent Dividend Summit, NOCHE announced that Northeast Ohio gained almost 58,000 college degree holders since 2009. Leadership In 2014, NOCHE's Board of Trustees named Robert W. Briggs as president. From 2007 to 2013, Ann Womer Benjamin served as executive director. Ms. Womer Benjamin came to NOCHE after serving in the Governor's Cabinet as Director of the Ohio Department of Insurance. She was in the state legislature for eight years prior to that. Ms. Womer Benjamin is an attorney by trade. Her accomplishments during her tenure at NOCHE were documented in an email to the organization's Board of Trustees in late 2013. Some of those accomplishments are as follows: * $900,000 ‚Äì wage reimbursements administered to more than 400 interns at 100 companies from the Ohio Third Frontier Internship program and others * 18,523 ‚Äì the number of new students registered in NEOintern (a 563 percent increase since ClevelandIntern.net became NEOintern in 2008) * 960 ‚Äì the number of new businesses registered in NEOintern (a 60 percent increase since ClevelandIntern.net became NEOintern) * 65 ‚Äì the number of Northeast Ohio start-up companies receiving internship management services, including placing 180 interns, through the Entrepreneurial Internship Program * 2 ‚Äì the number of Northeast Ohio universities public trustees meetings and annual reports NOCHE has coordinated at the request of the Ohio Board of Regents * a Northeast Ohio Universities Collaboration and Innovation Study Commission report commissioned by the Ohio General Assembly, from which some recommendations had been implemented History The framework for what eventually became NOCHE began in 1951 when a group of locals obtained a grant from the Cleveland Foundation to conduct a study to ‚Äúlook into the condition of higher education in Cuyahoga County and recommend potential avenues of cooperation and coordination.‚Äù As a result of the study, the Cleveland Commission on Higher Education was formed with the following initial members: Baldwin-Wallace College, Case Institute of Technology, Fenn College, John Carroll University and Western Reserve University. =Higher Education in Post-World War II Cleveland= The driving forces for the creation of the Commission were the increase in college-ready students due to the end of World War II, and the GI Bill, which gave military veterans free or reduced tuition. An enrollment increase of 30% in the decade following the war greatly strained the enrollment capacities of the region‚Äôs higher education institutions. In addition, some students lacked a sufficient secondary education that would allow them to succeed in college. To remedy these problems, the Commission recommended the creation of a two-year college in the area. This recommendation eventually led to the formation of Cuyahoga Community College in 1963. However, still no public four-year university existed in Cuyahoga County. The realization of the need for more affordable education led the Commission to push for the creation of a local public university. Because of these efforts, with help from other regional groups, Fenn College became Cleveland State University in 1964. One of the more significant historical events in higher education in Northeast Ohio occurred in 1967, when the Commission and other groups lobbied for the merger of the Case Institute of Technology and Western Reserve University. The merger eventually was realized in 1967 with the formation of Case Western Reserve University. During the late 1980s and into the 1990s, the Commission expanded its membership significantly across Northeast Ohio. To reflect this expanded geographic activity, the Commission changed its name to the Northeast Ohio Council on Higher Education, or NOCHE.

He was the father of Muhammad Dilawar Khanji - Former Governor of Sindh and his claimed successor. Famed for his extravagant lifestyle and his love of dogs, his decision to accede Junagadh to the Dominion of Pakistan following India's Independence led to the Indian Army taking military action. He is credited with pioneering a conservation effort in what is now the Gir National Park that saved India's last few lions from almost certain extinction. Early life Nawabzada Muhammad Mahabat Khanji III was born on 2 August 1900 at Junagadh, the fourth son of HH Nawab Sir Muhammad Rasul Khanji, GCSI (1858‚Äì1911; r. 1892-1911). As the fourth son, Mahabat was not expected to succeed to the musnaid of Junagadh; however, following the death of his three elder brothers by the time he was eight, he was made heir apparent, and succeeded his father upon his death in 1911. Mahabat was educated at Mayo College, and ruled under a regency until his formal accession on 31 March 1920. The following year, he was raised to a 15-gun personal and local gun salute; in 1926, he was knighted. Reign According to Sir Cyril Hancock, the former Resident of Western States, the Nawab was well loved by his people and the state was well administered. Hancock had a high opinion of Nawab's personal qualities. During his reign, the Nawab oversaw the opening of the Willingdon Dam, the construction of the Bahadur Khanji Library (named after his ancestor, the first Nawab) and the opening of the Mahabat Khan Free College. Mahabat Khanji was widely known for his love of animals, particularly dogs. At one point, he owned over 2000 high-pedigree dogs and is known to have spent several thousand rupees on grand birthday and 'marriage' parties for his favourite dogs. However, Mahabat Khanji's love for animals also extended to the regional wildlife, particularly the Asiatic lion, which at the time was on the verge of extinction in India. The Nawab helped to forestall this by preserving vast tracts of the Gir forest in order to provide the lions with a stable habitat. He was also interested in animal husbandry, and his efforts in the field served to greatly improve the breeding stock of the local Kathiawari stallions and of the Gir cows. The accession conflict At the time of Indian independence in August 1947, all of the princely states were advised to accede to either of the two dominions of India or Pakistan. By 15 August 1947, most of these states in the interior of India had chosen to accede to India. Nawab Sir Mahabat Khan, however, spent the summer of 1947 on holiday in Europe. In his absence, his dewan, Sir Shah Nawaz Bhutto, ran the affairs of the state, and he hobnobbed with Muhammad Ali Jinnah to join the state to Pakistan. On 11 August 1947, upon his return from his holiday, the Nawab made the decision to accede to Pakistan and sent an emissary to negotiate with Jinnah. Junagadh's population was predominantly Hindu, with the Muslim population accounting for only about a fifth of its total population. With Pakistan's acceptance of Junagadh's accession on 13 September, the Indian government took drastic action, inducing two of the Nawab's vassals, Mangrol and Babariyawad, to accede to India. The first Home Minister of independent India, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, played a major role in this regard. Sir Mahabat Khanji, his family (including his dogs), and his dewan (prime minister), Sir Shah Nawaz Bhutto, fled by plane to Pakistan on 24 October, never to return. Reportedly one of his begums and her child were left behind in the chaotic escape. Bhutto wrote to Samaldas Gandhi, leader of the Arzi Hukumat (or government in exile), to take over Junagadh. The Indian Army then took over Junagadh on 9 November, installed a new state Governor, and called for a public referendum on the status of the state. The referendum, arranged by the Indian government, was held on 20 February 1948. Of over 200,000 people who voted, 91 percent chose India while the rest chose Pakistan. The following year, on 20 January 1949, Junagadh was merged into the new Indian state of Saurashtra. Exile and death After his exile from Junagadh, Sir Mahabat Khanji and his family settled at Karachi, where he died, aged 59, on 17 November 1959 of Cardiac arrest. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Muhammad Dilawar Khanji, who claimed to be rightful Nawab of the state in absentia. The former Junagadh princely family still resides in Karachi.

He founded and led the Viking Jazz Band, which was active from 1956. BiographyEarly life and career= Arne Bue Jensen was born in Copenhagen, Denmark. At an early age, he became fascinated with jazz, prompted by a pile of records from his brother that included Harry James, Artie Shaw, Tommy Dorsey, Glenn Miller and Bert Ambrose. Bunk Johnson and George Lewis made a strong impression. After World War II, Jensen became a sailor, visiting ports around the world. It was around this time that he started to play jazz. He bought a slide trombone with money he borrowed, which would take him years to repay. A musician from the Royal Danish Orchestra taught him some basics, but otherwise he was self-taught. He played in Copenhagen clubs with other young musicians and bands, including the Royal Jazzman (later the Bohana Jazz Band), Henrik Johansen's Jazz Band, and the Saint Peter Street Stompers, participating as a sideman in several recordings. In the 1950s, Papa Bue worked with the Bonanza Jazz Band, Chris Barber, Adrian Bentzon, and Henrik Johansen. =Viking Jazz Band= Papa Bue's Viking Jazz Band performing in Braunschweig, 7 July 1992 In the mid 1950s, he was part of the entertainment district in Nyhavn. He performed with other young jazz musicians in various informal arrangements. With six musicians he founded the New Orleans Jazz Band in 1956, after a jam session at Cap Horn. Since Jensen was the eldest, he became the bandleader. Given that he was the only band member who was a father, he was given the nickname \\"Papa Bue\\". In late 1957, Jensen renamed the ensemble the Viking Jazz Band. The name came from American journalist and vocalist Shel Silverstein who attended one of their concerts at Cap Horn during a stay in Copenhagen. He subsequently wrote an article about them, calling them the Danish Vikings, explaining that they played original New Orleans and Chicago jazz better than any American band at the time. The band adopted the new name and released their first album as the Viking Jazz Band in 1958. In 1960 their \\"Schlafe Mein Prinzchen\\" sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. At a time when many jazz musicians worked in the Bebop idiom, Bue's style remained based on the Dixieland tradition but also with influences from early swing music. He is considered one of the most significant proponents of his genre. The group remained active into the 1990s, and recorded with musicians such as George Lewis (1959), Champion Jack Dupree (1962), Art Hodes (1970), Wild Bill Davison (1970, 1974), Wingy Manone, Edmond Hall and Albert Nicholas. They also played with George Lewis, Earl Hines, Stuff Smith, Ben Webster. Wild Bill Davison was a permanent band member. It was Papa Bue's Viking Jazz Band which recorded Bent Fabricius-Bjerre's theme music for the Olsen Gang series, now a legendary sequence for the Danes. Jensen released a large number of albums, many of them issued or reissued on Storyville Records, Timeless Records, and Music Mecca. Papa Bue died on 2 November 2011, at the age of 81. =Awards and honors= In 1969, Papa Bue's Viking Jazz Band was the only non-American band to participate in the New Orleans Jazz Festival and Jensen was honored with the \\"Golden Keys to the City\\". In 1989 he received the Ben Webster's Prize of Honour.

It is bright green, frequently with a golden or coppery shine; some individuals are blue or violaceous. It can only be confused with Oedemera flavipes (which does not live in the British Isles), from which it differs by its colour, as well as by the long white pubescence on the head, pronotum and hind tibiae of males. Biology and ecology Oedemera nobilis is abundant in spring on several flower species; the males are very conspicuous by their swollen femora and bright green colour. It feeds on pollen and nectar of Asteraceae, Cyperaceae, Convolvulaceae, Cruciferae, Dipsacaceae, Scrophulariaceae, Poaceae, Papaveraceae, Plantaginaceae, Rosaceae, Rubiaceae and Apiaceae. The larvae develop on dry stems of Spartium and Cirsium. Distribution Western and southern Europe, from the Iberian Peninsula to Greece; it is absolutely common in Mediterranean countries and penetrates in Central Europe to middle of Germany and British Isles; it has reached Denmark, where it is rare and sporadic. It is also recorded from the Maghreb. It is absent from alpine countries and Eastern Europe. In England and Wales, it is presently in a markedly expansive and consolidational phase, which commenced during 1995.

Biographer Johnny Rogan writes about the song \\"It seems that the surer the singer is of his message, the clearer is his enunciation, and that he is more prone to chew on his words when he is less confident in the song itself. This seems true of \\"You Make Me Feel So Free\\", though the message of the title seems clear enough.

After an election that exposed divisions within the Georgia Democratic Party (giving the Georgia Republican Party a shot at the Governor's Mansion for the first time in the twentieth century), segregationist Democrat Lester Maddox was elected Governor of Georgia by the Georgia General Assembly. The voting also brought future President Jimmy Carter to statewide prominence for the first time. Democratic nomination Former Governor Ernest Vandiver was considered the favorite to return to his former job (although governors could not then succeed themselves, they could run again after leaving office), but he dropped out of the race because of health problems. That opened the door for former Governor Ellis Arnall, former Lieutenant Governor Garland T. Byrd, state Senator Jimmy Carter, and two segregationist businessmen, Lester Maddox and James H. Gray, Sr., to run for the Democratic nomination.New Georgia Encyclopedia Gray, a Massachusetts native, publisher of the Albany Herald and founder of what is now Gray Television, was a former Georgia Democratic state chairman who defended segregation in his northern accent before the 1960 Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles. In the primary race, Maddox had often called upon Gray to leave the race, having said that his opponent was \\"going down like the Titanic\\". Gray remained in the race and finished fourth in the primary. He declared neutrality in the Maddox-Arnall runoff election, not openly supporting either candidate. However, one of Gray's associates, Roy V. Harris of Augusta, a member of the Georgia State Board of Regents, supported Maddox over Arnall. Gray supporters attempted to entice Maddox to leave the race with a $100,000 payment. Gray denied involvement in the scheme but would not, on Maddox's request, take a lie detector test.Billy Hathorn, \\"The Frustration of Opportunity: Georgia Republicans and the Election of 1966\\", Atlanta History: A Journal of Georgia and the South, Vol. XXXI (Winter 1987-1988), pp. 38-39 =Democratic primary election results= The primary was held on September 13, 1966. Pursuant to Georgia law, as no candidate received a majority of votes in the primary, a runoff was held on September 27. =Lieutenant Governor= State House Speaker George T. Smith was the Democratic nominee for Lieutenant Governor of Georgia, after he defeated incumbent Peter Zack Geer in the primary. He went on to win the general election.\\"The Advocate\\", University of Georgia School of Law Republican nomination The Republican nominee was U.S. Representative Howard \\"Bo\\" Callaway. He was the first Republican Representative from Georgia since Reconstruction. No other Republicans sought down-ballot constitutional offices. State Senator Holden Eugene \\"Gene\\" Sanders of DeKalb County, a moderate Republican, sought to run for lieutenant governor, but Callaway said that Sanders did not follow the proper procedures. The Republican strategy was to shun all other statewide races for fear that a full ticket would unify the Democrats. The Atlanta Journal, which ultimately endorsed Callaway, claimed that key Republicans were a clique who hoped to build the party from the governor's office. The Athens Daily News depicted traditional Georgia Republican leaders as \\"would-be politicians [who viewed the party as] personal property and who made no real effort to expand into a broad-based and effective political organization.\\"Atlanta History, p. 39 General election results Some people, unhappy with both major nominees, took the \\"Go Bo\\" of Callaway's campaign and expanded it to \\"Go Bo, and take Lester with you\\". A write-in campaign for Arnall prevented any candidate from winning the majority. Georgia law at the time stipulated that the Georgia General Assembly would select the governor if no candidate received more than 50 percent of the popular vote. The legislature, dominated by Democrats, selected Maddox, although Callaway received a larger portion of the popular vote.OurCampaigns.com: GA Governor general election References 1966 Gubernatorial Georgia Category:November 1966 events ","title":"1966 Georgia gubernatorial election"},{"id":"18006633","text":"Philip of Spain in 1554.

Infection may involve the genitals, mouth, and/or rectum. Infected men may experience pain or burning with urination, discharge from the penis, or testicular pain. Infected women may experience burning with urination, vaginal discharge, vaginal bleeding between periods, or pelvic pain. Complications in women include pelvic inflammatory disease and in men include inflammation of the epididymis. Many of those infected, however, have no symptoms. If untreated, gonorrhea can spread to joints or heart valves. Gonorrhea is spread through sexual contact with an infected person. This includes oral, anal, and vaginal sex. It can also spread from a mother to a child during birth. Diagnosis is by testing the urine, urethra in males, or cervix in females. Testing all women who are sexually active and less than 25 years of age each year as well as those with new sexual partners is recommended; the same recommendation applies in men who have sex with men (MSM). Gonorrhea can be prevented with the use of condoms, having sex with only one person who is uninfected, and by not having sex. Treatment is usually with ceftriaxone by injection and azithromycin by mouth. Resistance has developed to many previously used antibiotics and higher doses of ceftriaxone are occasionally required. Retesting is recommended three months after treatment. Sexual partners from the last two months should also be treated. Gonorrhea affects about 0.8% of women and 0.6% of men. An estimated 33 to 106 million new cases occur each year, out of the 498 million new cases of curable STI ‚Äì which also includes syphilis, chlamydia, and trichomoniasis. Infections in women most commonly occur when they are young adults. In 2015, it caused about 700 deaths. Descriptions of the disease date back to before the Common Era within the Old Testament. The current name was first used by the Greek physician Galen before 200 CE who referred to it as \\"an unwanted discharge of semen\\". Signs and symptoms Gonorrhea infections of mucosal membranes can cause swelling, itching, pain, and the formation of pus. The time from exposure to symptoms is usually between two and 14 days, with most symptoms appearing between four and six days after infection, if they appear at all. Both men and women with infections of the throat may experience a sore throat, though such infection does not produce symptoms in 90% of cases. Other symptoms may include swollen lymph nodes around the neck. Either sex can become infected in the eyes or rectum if these tissues are exposed to the bacterium. =Women= Half of women with gonorrhea are asymptomatic but the other half experience vaginal discharge, lower abdominal pain, or pain with sexual intercourse associated with inflammation of the uterine cervix. Common medical complications of untreated gonorrhea in women include pelvic inflammatory disease which can cause scars to the fallopian tubes and result in later ectopic pregnancy among those women who become pregnant. =Men= Most infected men with symptoms have inflammation of the penile urethra associated with a burning sensation during urination and discharge from the penis. In men, discharge with or without burning occurs in half of all cases and is the most common symptom of the infection. This pain is caused by a narrowing and stiffening of the urethral lumen. The most common medical complication of gonorrhea in men is inflammation of the epididymis. Gonorrhea is also associated with increased risk of prostate cancer. =Infants= An infant with gonorrhea of the eyes If not treated, gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum will develop in 28% of infants born to women with gonorrhea. =Spread= If left untreated, gonorrhea can spread from the original site of infection and infect and damage the joints, skin, and other organs. Indications of this can include fever, skin rashes, sores, and joint pain and swelling. In advanced cases, gonorrhea may cause a general feeling of tiredness similar to other infections. It is also possible for an individual to have an allergic reaction to the bacteria, in which case any appearing symptoms will be greatly intensified. Very rarely it may settle in the heart, causing endocarditis, or in the spinal column, causing meningitis. Both are more likely among individuals with suppressed immune systems, however. Cause Multiple views of a Neisseria gonorrhoeae bacterium, which causes gonorrhea Gonorrhea is caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Previous infection does not confer immunity ‚Äì a person who has been infected can become infected again by exposure to someone who is infected. Infected persons may be able to infect others repeatedly without having any signs or symptoms of their own. =Spread= The infection is usually spread from one person to another through vaginal, oral, or anal sex. Men have a 20% risk of getting the infection from a single act of vaginal intercourse with an infected woman. The risk for men that have sex with men (MSM) is higher.Howard Brown Health Center: STI Annual Report, 2009 Active MSM may get a penile infection, while passive MSM may get anorectal gonorrhea. Women have a 60‚Äì80% risk of getting the infection from a single act of vaginal intercourse with an infected man.National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services (20 July 2001). \\"Workshop Summary: Scientific Evidence on Condom Effectiveness for Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD) Prevention\\". Hyatt Dulles Airport, Herndon, Virginia. pp14 A mother may transmit gonorrhea to her newborn during childbirth; when affecting the infant's eyes, it is referred to as ophthalmia neonatorum. It may be able to spread through the objects contaminated with body fluid from an infected person. The bacteria typically does not survive long outside the body, typically dying within minutes to hours. Diagnosis Traditionally, gonorrhea was diagnosed with Gram stain and culture; however, newer polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based testing methods are becoming more common. In those failing initial treatment, culture should be done to determine sensitivity to antibiotics. Tests that use polymerase chain reaction (PCR, aka nucleic acid amplification) to identify genes unique to N. gonorrhoeae are recommended for screening and diagnosis of gonorrhea infection. These PCR-based tests require a sample of urine, urethral swabs, or cervical/vaginal swabs. Culture (growing colonies of bacteria in order to isolate and identify them) and Gram-stain (staining of bacterial cell walls to reveal morphology) can also be used to detect the presence of N. gonorrhoeae in all specimen types except urine. If Gram-negative, oxidase-positive diplococci are visualized on direct Gram stain of urethral pus (male genital infection), no further testing is needed to establish the diagnosis of gonorrhea infection. However, in the case of female infection direct Gram stain of cervical swabs is not useful because the N. gonorrhoeae organisms are less concentrated in these samples. The chances of false positives are increased as Gram-negative diplococci native to the normal vaginal flora cannot be distinguished from N. gonorrhoeae. Thus, cervical swabs must be cultured under the conditions described above. If oxidase positive, Gram-negative diplococci are isolated from a culture of a cervical/vaginal swab specimen, then the diagnosis is made. Culture is especially useful for diagnosis of infections of the throat, recutum, eyes, blood, or joints ‚Äì areas where PCR-based tests are not well established in all labs. Culture is also useful for antimicrobial sensitivity testing, treatment failure, and epidemiological purposes (outbreaks, surveillance). In patients who may have disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI), all possible mucosal sites should be cultured (e.g., pharynx, cervix, urethra, rectum).https://www.cdc.gov/std/tg2015/clinical.htm section on prevention methods Three sets of blood cultures should also be obtained. Synovial fluid should be collected in cases of septic arthritis. All people testing positive for gonorrhea should be tested for other sexually transmitted diseases such as chlamydia, syphilis, and human immunodeficiency virus. Studies have found co- infection with chlamydia ranging from 46 to 54% in young people with gonorrhea. For this reason, gonorrhea and chlamydia testing are often combined. People diagnosed with gonorrhea infection have a fivefold increase risk of HIV transmission. Additionally, infected persons who are HIV positive are more likely to shed and transmit HIV to uninfected partners during an episode of gonorrhea.  Screening  The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends screening for gonorrhea in women at increased risk of infection, which includes all sexually active women younger than 25 years. Extragenital gonorrhea and chlamydia are highest in men who have sex with men (MSM). Additionally, the USPSTF also recommends routine screening in people who have previously tested positive for gonorrhea or have multiple sexual partners and individuals who use condoms inconsistently, provide sexual favors for money, or have sex while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Screening for gonorrhea in women who are (or intend to become) pregnant, and who are found to be at high risk for sexually transmitted diseases, is recommended as part of prenatal care in the United States.Health Care Guideline: Routine Prenatal Care. Fourteenth Edition. By the Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement July 2010.  Prevention  As with most sexually transmitted diseases, the risk of infection can be reduced significantly by the correct use of condoms and can be removed almost entirely by limiting sexual activities to a mutually monogamous relationship with an uninfected person.section: Prevention section: How can gonorrhea be prevented? Those previously infected are encouraged to return for follow up care to make sure that the infection has been eliminated. In addition to the use of phone contact, the use of email and text messaging have been found to improve the re-testing for infection. Newborn babies coming through the birth canal are given erythromycin ointment in the eyes to prevent blindness from infection. The underlying gonorrhea should be treated; if this is done then usually a good prognosis will follow.  Treatment Antibiotics= Penicillin entered mass production in 1944 and revolutionized the treatment of several venereal diseases. Antibiotics are used to treat gonorrhea infections. As of 2016, both ceftriaxone by injection and azithromycin by mouth are most effective. However, due to increasing rates of antibiotic resistance, local susceptibility patterns must be taken into account when deciding on treatment. Adults may have eyes infected with gonorrhoea and require proper personal hygiene and medications. Addition of topical antibiotics have not been shown to improve cure rates compared to oral antibiotics alone in treatment of eye infected gonorrhea. For newborns, erythromycin ointment is recommended as a preventative measure for gonococcal infant conjunctivitis. Among persons in the United States between 14 and 39 years of age, 46% of people with gonorrheal infection also have chlamydial infection. Infections of the throat can be especially problematic, as antibiotics have difficulty becoming sufficiently concentrated there to destroy the bacteria. This is amplified by the fact that pharyngeal gonorrhoea is mostly asymptomatic, and gonococci and commensal Neisseria species can coexist for long time periods in the pharynx and share anti-microbial resistance genes. Accordingly, an enhanced focus on early detection (i.e., screening of high-risk populations, such as men who have sex with men, PCR testing should be considered) and appropriate treatment of pharyngeal gonorrhoea is important. =Sexual partners= It is recommended that sexual partners be tested and potentially treated. One option for treating sexual partners of people infected is patient-delivered partner therapy (PDPT), which involves providing prescriptions or medications to the person to take to his/her partner without the health care provider's first examining him/her.\\"Expedited partner therapy in the management of sexually transmitted diseases\\" . February 2006. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The United States' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) currently recommend that individuals who have been diagnosed and treated for gonorrhea avoid sexual contact with others until at least one week past the final day of treatment in order to prevent the spread of the bacterium. =Antibiotic resistance= Many antibiotics that were once effective including penicillin, tetracycline, and fluoroquinolones are no longer recommended because of high rates of resistance. Resistance to cefixime has reached a level such that it is no longer recommended as a first-line agent in the United States, and if it is used a person should be tested again after a week to determine whether the infection still persists. Public health officials are concerned that an emerging pattern of resistance may predict a global epidemic. The UK's Health Protection Agency reported that 2011 saw a slight drop in gonorrhea antibiotic resistance, the first in five years. In 2016, the WHO published new guidelines for treatment, stating \\"There is an urgent need to update treatment recommendations for gonococcal infections to respond to changing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) patterns of N. gonorrhoeae. High-level resistance to previously recommended quinolones is widespread and decreased susceptibility to the extended-spectrum (third-generation) cephalosporins, another recommended first-line treatment in the 2003 guidelines, is increasing and several countries have reported treatment failures.\\" Prognosis Disability-adjusted life year for gonorrhea per 100,000 inhabitants Gonorrhea if left untreated may last for weeks or months with higher risks of complications. One of the complications of gonorrhea is systemic dissemination resulting in skin pustules or petechia, septic arthritis, meningitis, or endocarditis. This occurs in between 0.6 and 3% of infected women and 0.4 and 0.7% of infected men. In men, inflammation of the epididymis, prostate gland, and urethra can result from untreated gonorrhea.Kumar, Vinay; Abbas, Abul K.; Fausto, Nelson; & Mitchell, Richard N. (2007). Robbins Basic Pathology (8th ed.). Saunders Elsevier. pp. 705‚Äì706 In women, the most common result of untreated gonorrhea is pelvic inflammatory disease. Other complications include inflammation of the tissue surrounding the liver, a rare complication associated with Fitz-Hugh‚ÄìCurtis syndrome; septic arthritis in the fingers, wrists, toes, and ankles; septic abortion; chorioamnionitis during pregnancy; neonatal or adult blindness from conjunctivitis; and infertility. Men who have had a gonorrhea infection have an increased risk of getting prostate cancer. Epidemiology Gonorrhea rates, United States, 1941‚Äì2007 About 88 million cases of gonorrhea occur each year, out of the 448 million new cases of curable STI each year ‚Äì that also includes syphilis, chlamydia and trichomoniasis. The prevalence was highest in the African region, the Americas, and Western Pacific, and lowest in Europe. In 2013, it caused about 3,200 deaths, up from 2,300 in 1990. In the United Kingdom, 196 per 100,000 males 20 to 24 years old and 133 per 100,000 females 16 to 19 years old were diagnosed in 2005. In 2013, the CDC estimated that more than 820,000 people in the United States get a new gonorrheal infection each year. Fewer than half of these infections are reported to CDC. In 2011, 321,849 cases of gonorrhea were reported to the CDC. After the implementation of a national gonorrhea control program in the mid-1970s, the national gonorrhea rate declined from 1975 to 1997. After a small increase in 1998, the gonorrhea rate has decreased slightly since 1999. In 2004, the rate of reported gonorrheal infections was 113. 5 per 100,000 persons. In the US, it is the second-most-common bacterial sexually transmitted infections; chlamydia remains first. According to the CDC African Americans are most affected by gonorrhea, accounting for 69% of all gonorrhea cases in 2010. The World Health Organization warned in 2017 of the spread of untreatable strains of gonorrhea, following analysis of at least three cases in Japan, France and Spain, which survived all antibiotic treatment. History During World War II, the U.S. government used posters to warn military personnel about the dangers of gonorrhea and other sexually transmitted infections. Some scholars translate the biblical terms zav (for a male) and zavah (for a female) as gonorrhea. It has been suggested that mercury was used as a treatment for gonorrhea. Surgeons' tools on board the recovered English warship the Mary Rose included a syringe that, according to some, was used to inject the mercury via the urinary meatus into any unfortunate crewman suffering from gonorrhea. The name \\"the clap\\", in reference to the disease, is recorded as early as the sixteenth century, referring to a medieval red-light district in Paris, Les Clapiers. Translating to \\"The rabbit holes\\", it was so named for the small huts in which prostitutes worked. as cited in the Oxford English Dictionary entry for \\"clap\\" In 1854, Dr. Wilhelm Gollmann addressed gonorrhea in his book, Homeopathic Guide to all Diseases Urinary and Sexual Organs. He noted that the disease was common in prostitutes and homosexuals in large cities. Gollmann recommended the following as cures: aconite to cure \\"shooting pains with soreness and inflammation;\\" mercury \\"for stitching pain with purulent discharge;\\" nux vomica and sulphur \\"when the symptoms are complicated with hemorrhoids and stricture of the rectum. Other remedies include argentum, aurum (gold), belladonna, calcarea, ignatia, phosphorus, and sepia. Silver nitrate was one of the widely used drugs in the 19th century. However, it became replaced by Protargol. Arthur Eichengr√ºn invented this type of colloidal silver, which was marketed by Bayer from 1897 onward. The silver-based treatment was used until the first antibiotics came into use in the 1940s. The exact time of onset of gonorrhea as prevalent disease or epidemic cannot be accurately determined from the historical record. One of the first reliable notations occurs in the Acts of the (English) Parliament. In 1161, this body passed a law to reduce the spread of \\"...the perilous infirmity of burning\\".W Sanger. History of Prostitution. NY, Harper, 1910. The symptoms described are consistent with, but not diagnostic of, gonorrhea. A similar decree was passed by Louis IX in France in 1256, replacing regulation with banishment.P. LaCroix. The History of Prostitution‚ÄîVol. 2. NY, MacMillan, 1931. Similar symptoms were noted at the siege of Acre by Crusaders. Coincidental to, or dependent on, the appearance of a gonorrhea epidemic, several changes occurred in European medieval society. Cities hired public health doctors to treat afflicted patients without right of refusal. Pope Boniface rescinded the requirement that physicians complete studies for the lower orders of the Catholic priesthood. Medieval public health physicians in the employ of their cities were required to treat prostitutes infected with the \\"burning\\", as well as lepers and other epidemic victims.WE Leiky. History of European Morals. NY, MacMillan, 1926. After Pope Boniface completely secularized the practice of medicine, physicians were more willing to treat a sexually transmitted disease.  Research  A vaccine for gonorrhea has been developed that is effective in mice. It will not be available for human use until further studies have demonstrated that it is both safe and effective in the human population. Development of a vaccine has been complicated by the ongoing evolution of resistant strains and antigenic variation (the ability of N. gonorrhoeae to disguise itself with different surface markers to evade the immune system). As N. gonorrhoeae is closely related to N. meningitidis and they have 80‚Äì90% homology in their genetic sequences some cross-protection by meningococcal vaccines is plausible. A study published in 2017 showed that MeNZB group B meningococcal vaccine provided a partial protection against gonorrhea. The vaccine efficiency was calculated to be 31%.

For his birth year, it is likely to be somewhere between 1731 to 1733 as a royal decree was issued in 1743 to select the husband for Princess Hwahyeop. The decree asked for yangban families to submit the names of primary born sons of the same age or up to two years older than the Princess („ÄäÊâøÊîøÈô¢Êó•ËÆ∞„ÄãËã±Á•ñ19Âπ¥2Êúà22Êó•ÔºöÂèà‰ª•Á¶ÆÊõπË®ÄÂïìÊõ∞, ÂíåÂçîÁøÅ‰∏ªÈßôÈ¶¨, Ëá™ÂçÅ‰∏ÄÊ≠≤Ëá≥ÂçÅ‰∏âÊ≠≤ÊèÄÊìá‰∫ã, ÂëΩ‰∏ãÁü£„ÄÇ). As for his death year, in 1775, King Yeongjo dismissed his uncle, Sin Ui (Áî≥Êô¶Ôºå1706-??), from the position of Chief State Counselor. The historian commented that Sin Ui was Sin Gwang-su's uncle without using the word ‚ÄúÊïÖ‚Äù, which would be referring to a deceased person (Ëã±Á•ñ125Âç∑, 51Âπ¥7Êúà1Êó•ÔºöÂëΩÁΩ∑È†òË≠∞ÊîøÁî≥Êô¶„ÄÇ„ÄêÂè≤Ëá£Êõ∞: Êô¶‰ª•ÊïÖÁõ∏Êô©Âºü, ÈÉΩÂ∞âÂÖâÁ∂è‰πãÂèî, Â§§Á∑£ÊàöÁïπ, È©üÈôûÂ§ßÂÆò, Â∞à‰∫ãÈòøË´õ, ÂÆ≥ÂÖ¨Âà©Â∑±, Ë≥ÑË≥ÇÂÖ¨Ë°å, ‰∫∫Ëé´‰∏çÂîæÈÑô„ÄÇ ÂèäÊòØÁΩ∑Áõ∏, ËºøË´ñÂø´‰πã„ÄÇ„Äë).

His third son Gwang-jip was made the adopted son of his younger brother Sin Ui. Among the three brothers, only Gwang-su did not have a record of passing the licentiate examination and had not held any official post except the nominal title of royal son-in-law. He was later impeached of plotting against King Jeongju with Chong Hugyom (ÈÉëÂéöË∞¶Ôºâand was posthumously stripped off his title of royal consort in 1777 (Ê≠£Á•ñ3Âç∑, 1Âπ¥1Êúà29Êó•ÔºöË´´ÊùéÈ°ØÊ∞∏‰∏äÁñè, Ë´ãËøΩÂâäÁî≥ÂÖâÁ∂èÁàµÁß©, ÂéöË¨ôÂÖÑÂºüÁµ∂Â≥∂Êï£ÈÖç‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ÊâπÊõ∞: \\"Áî≥ÂÖâÁ∂è‰∫ã‰æùÊñΩ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶) but had it rehabilitated in 1830. from the Pyongsan Sin Clan (ÌèâÏÇ∞Ïã†Ïî®ÔºåÂπ≥Â±±Áî≥Ê∞è).Pyongsan Sin Clan were originally migrants from China during the warring states period at the end of Zhou Dynasty. The clan first settled in Balhae Kingdom(border land between China and Korea) and moved east to Korea Peninsula after the fall of Balhae to the Khitan. Clan members joined the forces of Wang Geon (Taejo of Koryo) and conquered Silla to establish the Koryo Dynasty, thus gaining the status of aristocrats. The ancestral seat of the clan is in Pyongsan county, Hwanghae province. Princess Hwahyeop was renowned for her beauty and exceptional devotion to her parents, but it is reported that King Yeongjo disliked her due to his disappointment that she was not a male child.It has been 5 years since the death of Crown Prince Hyojang. Yeongjo had been expecting a son before the birth of the Princess. When a girl was born instead, his great disappointment was explicitly recorded in the Sillok - \\"It is not because of this (Princess Hwahyeop's birth) that I can neither eat nor sleep well. But whenever I think of the continuation of the royal bloodline, I feel distressed.\\" (Ëã±Á•ñ 33Âç∑, 9Âπ¥3Êúà 8Êó•Ôºö‰∏äÊõ∞Ôºö\\"‰∫àË±à‰ª•Ê≠§, Ëá≥ÊñºÂØ¢È£üÂ§±ÁØÄ, ËÄå‰ΩÜÂøµ‰∏âÂÆóË°ÄËÑà, ÂøÉ‰∏çÂ¶ÇÂ∏∏Áü£„ÄÇ\\") In the memoirs of Lady Hyegyong, it is said that King Yeongjo forbade Princess Hwahyeop to stay in the same house as his beloved daughter Princess Hwapyeong.

When she got married, he was cold to her husband.JaHyun Kim Haboush, ed., The Memoirs of Lady Hyegy≈èng: The Autobiographical Writings of a Crown Princess of Eighteenth-Century Korea. University of California Press, Berkeley, 1996. Similarly disfavored by their father, Prince Sado had a special affinity for Princess Hwahyeop.When Prince Sado heard about the death of Princess Hwahyeop, he was grief-stricken and sighed \\"I particularly commiserate with this sister.

His grief was expressed in his eulogy dedicated to her.See next section: Eulogies Sometimes in the 10th month of 1750, there was a large epidemics of measles in the capital. Princess Hwahyeop was the first to come down with it.According to Lady Hyegyong, the epidemics of measles broke out at around 21 days after the birth of her first child, Prince Uiso. JaHyun Kim Haboush, ed., The Memoirs of Lady Hyegy≈èng: The Autobiographical Writings of a Crown Princess of Eighteenth-Century Korea. University of California Press, Berkeley, 1996. She subsequently died of measles on the 27th day of the 11th lunar month, 1752, at the age of 19.According to the tradition Chinese counting of \\"sui\\", Princess Hwahyeop would be 20 years old at time of her death. Thus, in Prince Sado's eulogy, he said that she has \\"lived to see twenty springs\\". She did not conceive any child but has an adopted son Sin Chaesan (Hangul: Ïã†Ïû¨ÏÑ†, Hanja: Áî≥Âú®ÂñÑ), an off- spring from Sin Gwang-su's distant cousin.From the records of Pyongyang Sin Ssi genealogy, Sin Gwang-su had not remarry a second legal wife after the death of Princess Hwahyeop. Thus, Sin Chaesan was the only legitimate descendant to his line. However, he would probably have concubines that bore him secondary children whose names would never be recorded in the family genealogy. Tomb Princess Hwahyeop's tomb was discovered in August 2015, in Sampae-dong, Namyangju, Gyonggi-do (‰∫¨ÁïøÈÅìÂçóÊù®Â∑ûÂ∏Ç‰∏âÁâåÊ¥û). This was the original burial site of the Princess with her husband Sin Gwang-su. In the 1970s, the coffins of the couple was shifted to another burial site in Jingeon-myeon (Áúü‰πæÈÇë), Namyangju, by their descendants for an unknown reason. Therefore, only traces of their coffins were found in this original burial site.This piece of information was obtained by the editor (User Milugu) from the reporter who wrote the article on the excavation of Princess Hwahyeop's tomb. http://m.korea.net/english/NewsFocus/History/view?articleId=142918&page;=1 Characters carved on stone blocks placed on the right-hand side of the tomb were used to identify its occupant. The characters read: ÊúâÊòéÊúùÈ≤úÂíåÂçîÁøÅ‰∏ª‰πãÂ¢ìÂØÖÂùê (The burial of Princess Hwahyeop of the Joseon Dynasty). The second excavation in December 2016 unearthed a memorial stone featuring a eulogy dictated by King Yeongjo, a stone chest containing porcelain jars for cosmetics, a bronze mirror, and a wooden comb.http://m.korea.net/english/NewsFocus/History/view?articleId=142918&page;=1 The eulogy by King Yeongjo contained a total of 394 characters written on the back, front, and sides of the memorial stone. The eulogy details the king's final visit to his ill daughter on the 25th day of the 11th lunar month, 1752, two days before her death. It has been remarked that it is rare for a Joseon king to inscribe a stone for a daughter, and has been taken as a sign of King Yeongjo's affection for this particular daughter.http://english.donga.com/Home/3/all/26/835447/1 Eulogies Memorial stone FrontMemorial stone Side and Back The Royal Epitaph of Princess Hwahyeop, buried in PyongChang Village, Geumgok (Yangju)Original TextÔºöÂæ°Âà∂ÂíåÂçèÁøÅ‰∏ªÂ¢ìÂøóÔºåÂ¢ìÂú®ÈáëË∞∑Âπ≥‰∏òÊùë - Á¨¨‰∏ÉÂ•≥ÂíåÂçèÂç≥ÊöéÂ´îÊâÄÁîü‰πü„ÄÇÁô∏‰∏ë‰∏âÊúàÂàù‰∏ÉÊó•Áîü‰∫éÂ§ßÂÜÖÔºåÂ∑≥Êú™Â∞ÅÁàµÔºåÂçÅ‰∏ÄÂ≤Å‰∏ãÂ´ÅÊ∞∏ÂüéÂ∞âÁî≥ÂÖâÁª•ÔºåÂç≥Âà§‰π¶Êôö‰πãÂ≠ê‰πü„ÄÇ‰∏ÅÂçØÁßã‰∏ÉÊúàÂá∫ÈòÅÔºåÂ£¨Áî≥ÂçÅ‰∏ÄÊúà‰∫åÂçÅ‰∏ÉÊó•ÈÄù‰∫éÂ§ßÂØ∫Ê¥ûÁ¨¨„ÄÇÊ∞îÂìÅ‰ªéÂÆπÊ∏ÖÁßÄÔºå‰∫ã‰∫≤‰ª•ËØöÔºå‰∫ãËàÖËã•‰∏Ä„ÄÇËôΩÂ§ÑÊñºÈòô‰∏≠Ê≥¢Ëç°‰πã‰∏≠ÔºåËá™ÂπºËá≥ÈïøÊæπÁÑ∂ÈùôÁÑ∂ÔºåÊó†Â∞ëÈó¥ÁÑâÔºåËã•ÂºóÈóªÁÑâÔºåËã•ÂºóË¶©ÁÑâÔºåÂç≥ÂíåÂçè‰πãÊÄßÂìÅ‰πü„ÄÇÂºóÁÑ∂‰Ωï‰ª•Âæ°‰∏ãÔºå‰Ωï‰ª•ÈΩê‰ºóÂô´ÔºåÂ∏∏Êó∂‰∏∫‰∫à‰πãËØö„ÄÇËôΩÂºóËÉΩËÆ∞ÔºåÂéªÂÜ¨‰∫åÂçÅ‰∫îÊó•ÔºåÁâπ‰∏∫‰∏¥ËßÜ‰πü„ÄÇÈóª‰∫à‰πãÊù•ÔºåÂëΩÂ∑¶Âè≥ËÄåÂ§áÈ•åÂæÖ‰∫àÔºå‰ª§‰æçËÄÖËÄåÊé¢ÈóÆÊù•‰∫à„ÄÇÂëúÂëºÔºÅÂÖ∂Êó∂ÔºåÂ•öËÉΩ‰∏∫Ê≠§ÔºåËÄåÂõ†ÊÅíÊó•‰∏∫‰∫à‰πãÂøÉ‰πüÔºåÂêÅÂóüÂÖ∂Êó•‰∫ãÂ∑≤Êú´„ÄÇËã•ÊÉüÂæÖËßÜÔºåÁªàÊ∞îÂøΩÊòèÁú©Èöæ‰ª•Â†™ÁÑâÔºåÂóüÂèπËá™Ë∞ìÊõ∞ÔºåÂÖ∂Â∞ÜÊ¨∫ÊàëÔºåÂÖ∂Â∞ÜÊ¨∫Êàë„ÄÇÂÖ•ËßÜËÄåË∞ìÊõ∞Ôºå‰∫à‰ªäÂÖ•ÈòôÔºå‰∫à‰ªäÂÖ•ÈòôÔºåËã•ÊòØËÄÖ‰∏âÔºåÊòèÊòèÊ∂îÊ∂îÊº†ÁÑ∂Êó†Â∫îÔºåÊïÖÈ•ÆÊ∂ïËÄåÂõû„ÄÇÁøåÊó•ÊúùÈó¥ÔºåÂåªÊâÄ‰º†ÔºåÂÖ∂ÂêéÁúÅËßâÔºåË∞ìÂÖ∂‰æçËÄÖÊõ∞Ôºå‰ΩïÂºóËßâ‰ΩôÂ•è‰ª•ÂÆâÂõû‰∫ë„ÄÇÈóªÊ≠§ÂºóËßâÊ≥™‰∏ãÊä´Èù¢„ÄÇÈóªÂÖ∂ËÆ°Êù•‰∏¥Ôºå‰∫ãÂ∑≤Ëé´ËøΩ„ÄÇÂëúÂëºÔºÅÊ≠§ÊÄÄ‰Ωï‰ª•ËÆ∞ÁÑâÔºüÁøåÂπ¥Ê≠£Êúà‰∫åÂçÅ‰∫åÊó•Ëë¨‰∫éÊù®Â∑ûÈáëË∞∑Èù¢Â∫öÂêëÂéü„ÄÇËÄåË∞ìÂÖ∂‰∫àÊûùÔºå‰ΩïÂøçËÆ∞ÁÑâÔºåÂ∞§‰∏∫Ê∑±ÊÄÜËÄÖ„ÄÇÁî≥Èó®Âè™Êúâ‰π≥Á´•ÂºóÂç≥Á´ãÂêé‰πü„ÄÇÂøÉÊÄùÁ¥¢Êº†ËÆ∞ÔºåËôΩËçâËçâÊØîËØ∏ÊñáÂÖ∑ÔºåÂ∫∂ÂèØÊÖ∞ÁÅµ„ÄÇÂÖ∂ÂΩï‰∏ÄË°åÊ≥™‰∏ãÂçÅË°å„ÄÇÂëúÂëºÂìÄÂìâÔºÅÂëúÂëºÂìÄÂìâÔºÅ My seventh daughter was born of Yeongbin Yi Ssi ( Lady Seonhui) on the 7th day of the 3rd lunar month of 1733 in the royal palace.

She was composed in disposition and beautiful in appearance, genuine to her kins and devoted to her father-in-law. Despite growing up in the troubling palace,Translator's note (User Milugu): \\"troubling palace\\" refers to either the political turmoil at Yeongjo's court or the fact that Princess Hwahyeop was disfavored by Yeongjo and had received harsh treatments while she was alive Hwahyeop remained tranquil and distant herself from affairs. What remarkable character! Else, how was she able to command respect of the servants and had all mourned wholeheartedly at her passing? Even I was impressed by her sincerity. I could still vividly recall the events on my visit to her on the 25th day (of the 11th month) last winter. Having heard the news of my visit, Hwahyeop had her chamberlains prepared food for me and sent them to me to inquire. She thought for me despite being critically ill. What a considerate daughter she was! I deeply lament the events that day. While awaiting my arrival, Hwahyeop suddenly felt breathless. She was weeping, \\"I am going to fail my father\\" before losing consciousness. Repeating three times, I said to her, \\"I'm about to return to my place\\".Translator's note: the Silok recorded that Yeongjo insisted on visiting Princess Hwahyeop, ignoring protests from various ministers (probably because measles was contagious).

Hearing that, tears ran down my face without my knowledge. I was told that she was planning to come and see me but it was already too late. I am overwhelmed by sorrow. On the 22nd day of the 1st month in the following year, Hwayeop was buried in the plains of Geumgok, Yangju. It saddens me even more to think that she had not had a descendant yet. I will select a child from the Sin family to continue her line. In grief, I penned this draft to console her passing soul. Writing down the story line by line, I cannot hold back my tears.

She was born into the royal family and had grew up (with me) in the palace. She lived to see twenty springs till one frosty snow took her to join the immortals. Who would have expected this? Now I have rarely seen the wild geese flying across the sky.Translator's note: Geese is a popular motif in Chinese poems bearing various symbolic meanings. In the case of Prince Sado, he was lamenting the fact that his sisters (Princess Hwapyeong in 1743 and Princess Hwahyeop in 1752) were departing one after another to the netherworld. Thus the wild geese were rare (he had only three sisters born of the same mother) and getting fewer. He also used wild geese to allude to his sisters in his eulogy dedicated to Princess Hwapyeong.

Its usage is similar in meaning to cracker (especially regarding Texas, Georgia, and Florida), hillbilly (especially regarding Appalachia and the Ozarks),Anthony Harkins, Hillbilly, A Cultural History of an American Icon, Oxford University Press (2004), p. 39. and white trash (but without the last term's suggestions of immorality).Wray (2006) p. xErnest Cashmore and James Jennings, eds. Racism: essential readings (2001) p. 36.Jim Goad, The Redneck Manifesto: How Hillbillies, Hicks, and White Trash Became America's Scapegoats (1998) pp. 17‚Äì19 In Britain the Cambridge Dictionary definition states: \\"a poor, white person without education, esp. one living in the countryside in the southern US, who is believed to have prejudiced ideas and beliefs. This word is usually considered offensive.\\" See online People from the white South sometimes jocularly call themselves \\"rednecks\\" as insider humor. By the 1970s, the term had become offensive slang, its meaning expanded to include racism, loutishness, and opposition to modern ways.Robert L. Chapman, Dictionary of American Slang (1995) p. 459; William Safire, Safire's New Political Dictionary (1993) pp. 653-54; Tom Dalzell, The New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English: J-Z (2005) 2:1603. Patrick Huber, in his monograph A Short History of Redneck: The Fashioning of a Southern White Masculine Identity, emphasized the theme of masculinity in the 20th-century expansion of the term, noting, \\"The redneck has been stereotyped in the media and popular culture as a poor, dirty, uneducated, and racist Southern white man.\\" 19th and early 20th centuriesPolitical term for poor farmers= The term characterized farmers having a red neck caused by sunburn from hours working in the fields. A citation from 1893 provides a definition as \\"poorer inhabitants of the rural districts ... men who work in the field, as a matter of course, generally have their skin stained red and burnt by the sun, and especially is this true of the back of their necks\\".Frederic Gomes Cassidy & Joan Houston Hall, Dictionary of American Regional English VOL.IV (2002) p. 531. Hats were usually worn and they protected that wearer's head from the sun, but also provided psychological protection by shading the face from close scrutiny. The back of the neck however was more exposed to the sun and allowed closer scrutiny about the person's background in the same way callused working hands could not be easily covered. By 1900, \\"rednecks\\" was in common use to designate the political factions inside the Democratic Party comprising poor white farmers in the South. The same group was also often called the \\"wool hat boys\\" (for they opposed the rich men, who wore expensive silk hats). A newspaper notice in Mississippi in August 1891 called on rednecks to rally at the polls at the upcoming primary election: Poor white sharecroppers in Alabama in 1936 By 1910, the political supporters of the Mississippi Democratic Party politician James K. Vardaman‚Äîchiefly poor white farmers‚Äîbegan to describe themselves proudly as \\"rednecks\\", even to the point of wearing red neckerchiefs to political rallies and picnics.Kirwan (1951), p. 212. Linguist Sterling Eisiminger, based on the testimony of informants from the Southern United States, speculated that the prevalence of pellagra in the region during the great depression may have contributed to the rise in popularity of the term; red, inflamed skin is one of the first symptoms of that disorder to appear. =Coal miners= The term \\"redneck\\" in the early 20th century was occasionally used in reference to American coal miner union members who wore red bandanas for solidarity. The sense of \\"a union man\\" dates at least to the 1910s and was especially popular during the 1920s and 1930s in the coal- producing regions of West Virginia, Kentucky, and Pennsylvania.Patrick Huber, \\"Red Necks and Red Bandanas: Appalachian Coal Miners and the Coloring of Union Identity, 1912‚Äì1936\\", Western Folklore, Winter 2006. It was also used by union strikers to describe poor white strikebreakers. Late 20th and early 21st centuries Writers Edward Abbey and Dave Foreman also use \\"redneck\\" as a political call to mobilize poor rural white Southerners. \\"In Defense of the Redneck\\" was a popular essay by Ed Abbey. One popular early Earth First! bumper sticker was \\"Rednecks for Wilderness\\". Murray Bookchin, an urban leftist and social ecologist, objected strongly to Earth First!'s use of the term as \\"at the very least, insensitive\\".Bookchin, Murray; Foreman, Dave. Defending the Earth: A Dialogue Between Murray Bookchin and Dave Foreman. South End Press. 1991. p. 95. However, many Southerners have proudly embraced the term as a self-identifier. Similarly to Earth First!'s use, the self- described \\"anti-racist, pro-gun, pro-labor\\" group Redneck Revolt have used the term to signal its roots in the rural white working-class and celebration of what member Max Neely described as \\"redneck culture\\". As political epithet According to Chapman and Kipfer in their \\"Dictionary of American Slang\\", by 1975 the term had expanded in meaning beyond the poor Southerner to refer to \\"a bigoted and conventional person, a loutish ultra-conservative\\".Robert L. Chapman and Barbara Ann Kipfer, Dictionary of American Slang (3rd ed. 1995) p. 459. For example, in 1960 John Bartlow Martin expressed Senator John F. Kennedy should not enter the Indiana Democratic presidential primary because the state was \\"redneck conservative country\\". Indiana, he told Kennedy, was a state \\"suspicious of foreign entanglements, conservative in fiscal policy, and with a strong overlay of Southern segregationist sentiment\\". Writer William Safire observes it is often used to attack white Southern conservatives, and more broadly to degrade working class and rural whites that are perceived by urban progressives to be insufficiently progressive.William Safire, Safire's political dictionary (2008) p. 612 At the same time, some white Southerners have reclaimed the word, using it with pride and defiance as a self- identifier.Goad, The Redneck Manifesto: How Hillbillies, Hicks, and White Trash Became America's Scapegoats (1998) p. 18 In popular culture *Johnny Russell was nominated for a Grammy Award in 1973 for his recording of \\"Rednecks, White Socks and Blue Ribbon Beer\\", parlaying the \\"common touch\\" into financial and critical success. *Further songs referencing rednecks include \\"Longhaired Redneck\\" by David Allan Coe, \\"Rednecks\\" by Randy Newman, \\"Redneck Friend\\" by Jackson Browne, \\"Redneck Woman\\" by Gretchen Wilson, \\"Redneck Yacht Club\\" by Craig Morgan, \\"Redneck\\" by Lamb of God, \\"Redneck Crazy\\" by Tyler Farr, Red Neckin' Love Makin' Night by Conway Twitty, and \\"Your Redneck Past\\" by Ben Folds Five. *'Picture to Burn' by Taylor Swift is another successful country song using the word 'redneck', this time in a negative way, where the narrator calls her ex-boyfriend a 'redneck heartbreak'. *Frank Zappa's song \\"Lonesome Cowboy Bert\\" which appeared on the soundtrack of \\"200 Motels\\" performed by The Mothers used the term. *Comedian Jeff Foxworthy's 1993 comedy album You Might Be a Redneck If... cajoled listeners to evaluate their own behavior in the context of stereotypical redneck behavior. *Redneck is mentioned several times on Texas-based animated sitcom King of the Hill by Hank Hill's antagonistic neighbor Kahn. Outside the United StatesHistorical Scottish Covenanter usage= In Scotland in the 1640s, the Covenanters rejected rule by bishops, often signing manifestos using their own blood. Some wore red cloth around their neck to signify their position, and were called rednecks by the Scottish ruling class to denote that they were the rebels in what came to be known as The Bishop's War that preceded the rise of Cromwell.Fischer, David Hackett. (1989) Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America. New York: Oxford University Press.redneck (1989); Oxford English Dictionary second edition. Oxford: Oxford University Press. Eventually, the term began to mean simply \\"Presbyterian\\", especially in communities along the Scottish border. Because of the large number of Scottish immigrants in the pre-revolutionary American South, some historians have suggested that this may be the origin of the term in the United States.Herman, Arthur, How the Scots Invented the Modern World. New York: Three Rivers Press, 2001, p. 235. Dictionaries document the earliest American citation of the term's use for Presbyterians in 1830, as \\"a name bestowed upon the Presbyterians of Fayetteville [North Carolina]\\". =Roman Catholics= In Northern England during the 19th and 20th centuries, Roman Catholics were known as rednecks. =South Africa= The exact Afrikaans equivalent, , is used as a disparaging term for English people and South Africans of English descent, in reference to their supposed na√Øvet√© as later arrivals in the region in failing to protect themselves from the sun.

The semi-autobiographical film was shot on the kibbutzim of Ruhama and Nir Eliyahu, and draws on Shaul's memories of growing up on a kibbutz with his mentally unstable and widowed mother.Ines Ehrlich (13 November 2006), \\"Sweet Mud sheds new light on old kibbutz life\\", Ynetnews (retrieved 13 November 2012).  Plot  Set in 1974, Dvir (Tomer Steinhof) is soon to turn 13 and lives with his mother Miri (Ronit Yudkevitz) at a progressive kibbutz populated by people who take pride in their open-minded attitudes. However, they're not so easygoing when it comes to Miri; she's been sent to a mental hospital more than once, and her instability is more than most of the residents want to deal with, leaving Dvir to look after his mother with the help of his older brother Eyal (Pini Tavger). Miri persuades her Swiss boyfriend Stephan (Henri Garcin) to join her at the kibbutz, even though he isn't Jewish, but he isn't welcomed by other residents, and an unpleasant incident involving a neighbor's dog turns the couple into outcasts. In the midst of all this, Dvir is trying to prepare for his bar mitzvah, which at the kibbutz is combined with a severe regimen of survival training; he also gets a crash course in his ongoing maturity when he develops a crush on Maya (Daniel Kitsis), a cute girl his age.

At Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a rating of 82%, based on 11 reviews and an average rating of 7/10. The Toronto Star called it \\"an appealing coming-of-age tale that takes on the difficult issues of mental illness and conformity\\", providing two contrasting views of kibbutz life: on one hand, \\"an idyllic pastoral life where the fruits of labour and a strong sense of community are shared by all,\\" and on the other, \\"a place of rigid rules, where children sleep in segregated quarters away from their parents, baby bottles are dispensed in a regimented maternity ward-type system and where disapproval of individual idiosyncrasies can easily become a communal decision that isolates and ostracizes.\\"Bruce DeMara (15 June 2007), \\"Sweet Mud: Making of a man\\", Toronto Star (retrieved 13 November 2012).

(1990). Play. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press. Play is commonly associated with children and juvenile-level activities, but play occurs at any life stage, and among other higher-functioning animals as well, most notably mammals. Many prominent researchers in the field of psychology, including Melanie Klein, Jean Piaget, William James, Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung and Lev Vygotsky have viewed play as confined to the human species, believing play was important for human development and using different research methods to prove their theories. Play is often interpreted as frivolous; yet the player can be intently focused on their objective, particularly when play is structured and goal-oriented, as in a game. Accordingly, play can range from relaxed, free- spirited and spontaneous through frivolous to planned or even compulsive. Play is not just a pastime activity; it has the potential to serve as an important tool in numerous aspects of daily life for adolescents, adults, and cognitively advanced non-human species (such as primates). Not only does play promote and aid in physical development (such as hand-eye coordination), but it also aids in cognitive development and social skills, and can even act as a stepping stone into the world of integration, which can be a very stressful process. Play is something that most children partake in, but the way play is executed is different between cultures and the way that children engage with play varies universally.  Definitions  The seminal text in the field of play studies is the book Homo Ludens first published in 1944 with several subsequent editions, in which Johan Huizinga defines play as follows: This definition of play as constituting a separate and independent sphere of human activity is sometimes referred to as the \\"magic circle\\" notion of play, a phrase also attributed to Huizinga. Many other definitions exist. Jean Piaget stated, \\"the many theories of play expounded in the past are clear proof that the phenomenon is difficult to understand.\\" There are multiple aspects of play people home in on when defining it. One definition from Susanna Millar's The Psychology of Play defines play as: ‚Äúany purposeful mental or physical activity performed either individually or group-wise in leisure time or at work for enjoyment, relaxation, and satisfaction of real-time or long term needs.‚Äù This definition particularly emphasizes the conditions and benefits to be gained under certain actions or activities related to play. Other definitions may focus on play as an activity that must follow certain characteristics including willingness to engage, uncertainty of the outcome, and productivity of the activity to society. Another definition of play from the twenty-first century comes from the National Playing Fields Association (NPFA). The definition reads as follows: ‚Äúplay is freely chosen, personally directed, intrinsically motivated behaviour that actively engages the child.‚Äù This definition focuses more on the child's freedom of choice and personal motivation related to an activity. Forms People having fun Play can take the form of improvisation or pretense, interactive, performance, mimicry, games, sports, and thrill-seeking, such as extreme or dangerous sports (sky- diving, high-speed racing, etc.). Philosopher Roger Caillois wrote about play in his 1961 book Man, Play and Games and Stephen Nachmanovitch expanded on these concepts in his 1990 book Free Play: Improvisation in Life and Art.Nachmanovitch, Stephen, Free Play: Improvisation in Life and Art. Tarcher/Penguin 1990. Nachmanovitch writes that: Free play gives children the freedom to decide what they want to play and how it will be played. Both the activity and the rules are subject to change in this form, and children can make any changes to the rules or objectives of the play at any time. Some countries in the twenty-first century have added emphasis of free play into their values for children in early childhood such as Taiwan and Hungary. Structured play has clearly defined goals and rules and such play is called a \\"game\\". Other play is unstructured or open-ended. Both types of play promote adaptive behaviors and mental states of happiness. Sports with defined rules will take place within designated play spaces, such as sports fields where, in Soccer for example, players kick a ball in a certain direction and push opponents out of their way as they do so. While appropriate within the sport's play space, these same behaviors might be inappropriate or even illegal outside the playing field. Other designed play spaces can be playgrounds with dedicated equipment and structures to promote active and social play. Some play spaces go even farther in specialization to bring the play indoors and will often charge admission as seen at Children's Museums, Science Centers, or Family Entertainment Centers. Family Entertainment Centers (or Play Zones) are typically For-Profit businesses purely for play and entertainment, while Children's Museums and Science Centers are typically Non-Profit organizations for educational entertainment. The California-based National Institute for Play describes seven play patterns: # Attunement play, which establishes a connection, such as between newborn and mother. # Body play, in which an infant explores the ways in which his or her body works and interacts with the world, such as making funny sounds or discovering what happens in a fall. # Object play, such as playing with toys, banging pots and pans, handling physical things in ways that use curiosity. # Social play, play which involves others in activities such as tumbling, making faces, and building connections with another child or group of children. # Imaginative or pretend play, in which a child invents scenarios from his or her imagination and acts within them as a form of play, such as princess or pirate play. # Storytelling play, the play of learning and language that develops intellect, such as a parent reading aloud to a child, or a child retelling the story in his or her own words. # Creative play, by which one plays with imagination to transcend what is known in the current state, to create a higher state. For example, a person might experiment to find a new way to use a musical instrument, thereby taking that form of music to a higher plane; or, as Einstein was known to do, a person might wonder about things which are not yet known and play with unproven ideas as a bridge to the discovery of new knowledge. Separate from self-initiated play, play therapy is used as a clinical application of play aimed at treating children who suffer from trauma, emotional issues and other problems. Children In young children, play is frequently associated with cognitive development and socialization. Play that promotes learning and recreation often incorporates toys, props, tools or other playmates. Play can consist of an amusing, pretend or imaginary activity alone or with another. Some forms of play are rehearsals or trials for later life events, such as \\"play fighting\\", pretend social encounters (such as parties with dolls), or flirting.Sutton-Smith, B. (1997). The Ambiguity of Play. Cambridge, Massachusetts, Harvard University Press Modern findings in neuroscience suggest that play promotes flexibility of mind, including adaptive practices such as discovering multiple ways to achieve a desired result, or creative ways to improve or reorganize a given situation (Millar, 1967; Shonkoff & Phillips, 2000). Children playing in a sandboxAs children get older, they engage in board games, video games and computer play, and in this context the word gameplay is used to describe the concept and theory of play and its relationship to rules and game design. In their book, Rules of Play, researchers Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman outline 18 schemas for games, using them to define \\"play\\", \\"interaction\\" and \\"design\\" formally for behaviorists.Salen, Katie and Zimmerman, Eric (2003). Rules of Play: Game Design Fundamentals. Cambridge, Massachusetts, The MIT Press Similarly, in his book Half-Real: Video Games between Real Rules and Fictional Worlds, game researcher and theorist Jesper Juul explores the relationship between real rules and unreal scenarios in play, such as winning or losing a game in the real world when played together with real-world friends, but doing so by slaying a dragon in the fantasy world presented in the shared video game.Juul, Jesper (2011). Half-Real: Video Games between Real Rules and Fictional Worlds. Cambridge, MA, The MIT Press Play is explicitly recognized in Article 31 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations, November 29, 1989), which declares: * Parties recognize the right of the child to rest and leisure, to engage in play and recreational activities appropriate to the age of the child and to participate freely in cultural life and the arts. * Parties shall respect and promote the right of the child to participate fully in cultural and artistic life and shall encourage the provision of appropriate and equal opportunities for cultural, artistic, recreational and leisure activities. Children's Games, 1560, Pieter Bruegel the Elder =History of childhood playtime= American historian Howard Chudacoff has studied the interplay between parental control of toys and games and children's drive for freedom to play. In the colonial era, toys were makeshift and children taught each other very simple games with little adult supervision. The market economy of the 19th century enabled the modern concept of childhood as a distinct, happy life stage. Factory-made dolls and doll houses delighted young girls. Organized sports filtered down from adults and colleges, and boys learned to play with a bat, a ball and an impromptu playing field. 20th Century With the rise of motor vehicle traffic in the 20th century, teenagers were increasingly organized into club sports supervised and coached by adults, with swimming taught at summer camps and through supervised playgrounds. Under the New Deal's Works Progress Administration, thousands of local playgrounds and ball fields opened, promoting softball especially as a sport for all ages and both sexes. By the 21st century, Chudacoff notes, the old tension between parental controls and a child's individual freedom was being played out in cyberspace.Chudacoff, Howard, Children at Play: An American History (2008). NYU Press, New York.  Cultural differences of play  Museum of toys ‚Äì Portugal The act of play time is a cross-cultural phenomenon that is universally accepted and encouraged by most communities; however, it can differ in the ways that is performed. Some cultures, such as Euro-American cultural heritages, encourage play time in order to stress cognitive benefits and the importance of learning how to care for one's self. Other cultures, such as people of African American or Asian American heritages, stress more group oriented learning and play where kids can learn what they can do with and for others. Parent interactions when it comes to playtime also differs drastically within communities. Parents in the Mayan culture do interact with their children in a playful mindset while parents in the United States tend to set aside time to play and teach their children through games and activities. In the Mayan community, children are supported in their playing but also encouraged to play while watching their parents do household work in order to become familiar with how to follow in their footsteps. Elephant ‚Äì Mud play All around the world, children use different natural materials like stones, water, sand, leaves, fruits, sticks and a variety of resources to play. In addition, there are groups that have access to crafts, industrialized toys, electronics and video-games. In Australia, games and sports are part of play. There, play can be considered as preparation for life and self- expression, like in many other countries. Groups of children in Efe of the Democratic Republic of Congo can be seen making ‚Äòfood‚Äô from dirt or pretending to shoot bows and arrows much like their elders. These activities are similar to other forms of play worldwide. For instance, children can be seen comforting their toy dolls or animals, anything that they have modeled from adults in their communities. In Brazil, we can find children playing with balls, kites, marbles, pretend houses or mud kitchens, like in many other countries. In smaller communities they use mud balls, little stones or cashews to replace marbles. Child playing around the kitchen At an indigenous community of Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in Colombia, children's play is highly valued and encouraged by leaders and parents. They interact with the children of different ages and explore together different environments to let the children express themselves as part of the group. Some children in the Sahara use clay figures as their forms of playful toys. Toys in general are a representation of cultural practices. They usually illustrate characters and objects of a community. Play time can be used as a way for children to learn the different ways of their culture. Many communities use play to emulate work. The way in which children mimic work through their play can differ according to the opportunities they have access to, but it is something that tends to be promoted by adults. Sports Sportive activities are one of the most universal forms of play. Different continents have their own popular/dominant sports. For example, European, South American, and African countries enjoy soccer (also known as ‚Äòfootball‚Äô in Europe), while North American countries prefer basketball, ice hockey, baseball, or American football. In Asia, sports such as table tennis and badminton are played professionally; however soccer and basketball are played amongst common folks. Events such as The Olympic Games and FIFA World Cup showcase countries competing with each other and are broadcast all over the world. Sports can be played as a leisure activity or within a competition. According to sociologist Norbert Elias; it is an important part of \\"civilization process\\". Victory and defeat in sports can influence one's emotions to a point where everything else seems irrelevant. Sport fans can also imagine what it feels like to play for their preferred team. The feelings people experience can be so surreal that it affects their emotions and behavior. =Benefits in youth= Youth sport can provide a positive outcome for youth development. Research shows adolescents are more motivated and engaged in sports than any other activity, and these conditions predict a richer personal and interpersonal development. Anxiety, depression and obesity can stem from lack of activity and social interaction. There is a high correlation between the amount of time that youth spend playing sports and the effects of physical (e.g., better general health), psychological (e.g., subjective well being), academic (e.g., school grades), and social benefits (e.g., making friends). Electronics over the past 10 years have been looked as a form of playtime but researchers have found that most electronic play leads to lack of motivation, no social interaction and can lead to obesity. Play is originally based on the idea of children using their creativity while developing their imagination, dexterity, physical, cognitive and emotional strength. Dramatic play is common in younger children. For the youth community to benefit from playtime, the following are recommended: * Give children ample, unscheduled time to be creative to reflect and decompress * Give children ‚Äútrue‚Äù toys, such as blocks or dolls for creativity * Youth should have a group of supportive people around them (teammates, coaches, and parents) with positive relationships * Youth should possess skill development; such as physical, interpersonal, and knowledge about the sport * Youth should be able to make their own decisions about their sport participation * Youth should have experiences that are on par with their certain needs and developmental level =Research findings on benefits in youth= With regular participation in a variety of sports, children can develop and become more proficient at various sports skills (including, but not limited to, jumping, kicking, running, throwing, etc.) if the focus is on skill mastery and development. Young people participating in sports also develop agility, coordination, endurance, flexibility, speed, and strength. More specifically, young athletes could develop the following : * enhanced functioning and health of cardiorespiratory and muscular systems * improved flexibility, mobility, and coordination * increased stamina and strength * increased likelihood of maintaining weight Moreover, research shows that regular participation in sport and physical activity is highly associated with lowering the risk of diabetes, heart disease, obesity, and other related diseases. According to research by the Australian Early Childhood Mental Health Initiative, children can be assisted in dealing with and managing stress by developing their sense of optimism when playing sports. Young people also tend to be more nutrition- conscious in their food choices when participating in sport Girls involved in sport tend associate with lower chance of teenage pregnancy, begin smoking, and/or developing breast cancer. Young athletes have shown lower levels of total cholesterol and other favorable profiles in serum lipid parameters associated with cardiovascular disease. Sport provides an arena for young people to be physically active and in result reduce the time spent in sedentary pursuits, such as watching TV and playing video games. Adults Playing weiqi in Shanghai Although adults who engage in excessive amounts of play may find themselves described as \\"childish\\" or \\"young at heart\\" by less playful adults, play is an important activity, regardless of age. Creativity and happiness can result from adult play, where the objective can be more than fun alone, as in adult expression of the arts, or curiosity-driven science.\\"Tim Brown on Creativity and Play,\\" TED talks Some adult \\"hobbies\\" are examples of such creative play. In creative professions, such as design, playfulness can remove more serious attitudes (such as shame or embarrassment) that impede brainstorming or artistic experimentation in design. Imaginative play and role play may allow adult individuals to practice useful habits such as learned optimism, which is helpful in managing fear or terrors. Play also offers adults the opportunity to practice concepts that may not have been explicitly or formally taught (e.g. how to manage misinformation or deceit). Thus, even though play is just one of many tools used by effective adults, it remains a necessary one. Workplace There has been extensive research when it comes to the benefits of play amongst children, youth, and adolescence. Most commonly overlooked are the benefits of play for adults, more specifically, adults who spend a lot of time in the workplace. Many adults in North America are in the workforce and spend half of their waking hours in a workplace environment with little to no time for play.Prodaniuk, Plotnikoff, Spence, & Wilson, 2004 Play in this context refers to leisure-type activities with colleagues during lunch breaks or short breaks throughout the working day. Leisure activities could include, but are not limited to, different forms of physical sport activities, card games, board games, video games and interaction-based type video games, foosball, ping-pong, yoga, and boot-camp sessions. Research shows that playing games may promote a persistent and optimistic motivational style and positive affect.Ventura et al., 2013 Positive affect enhances people's experiences, enjoyment, and sense of satisfaction derived from the activity, during their engagement with a certain task. While people are engaged in their work, positive affect increases the satisfaction they feel from the work, and this has also been shown to increase their creativity and improve their performance on problem-solving tasks as well as other tasks.Erez & Isen, 2002; Isen, Daubman, & Nowicki, 1987; Staw & Barsade, 1993 The development of a persistent motivational style charged with positive affect may lead to lasting work success. Studies show that work and play are mutually supportive. Employees need to experience the sense of newness, flow, discovery and liveliness that play provides. By doing this, it will provide the employee with the sense that they are integrated within the organization, and therefore they will feel and perform better. By incorporating play at work, it will also result in more productivity, creativity and innovation, higher job satisfaction, greater workplace morale, stronger or new social bonds, improved job performance, a decrease in staff turnover, absenteeism and stress. Decreased stress leads to less illness, which results in lower health care costs. Play at work may help employees function and cope when under stress, refresh body and mind, encourage teamwork, trigger creativity, and increase energy while preventing burnout. Studies show that companies that encourage play at work, whether short breaks throughout the day or during lunch breaks experience more success because it leads to positive emotion amongst employees. Risk taking, confidence in presenting novel ideas, and embracing unusual and fresh perspectives are common characteristics associated with play at work. Play can increase self- reported job satisfaction and well-being. Employees experiencing positive emotions are more cooperative, more social, and perform better when faced with complex tasks. Contests, team-building exercises, fitness programs, mental health breaks and other social activities, will make the work environment fun, interactive, and rewarding. Also playfighting, i.e. playful fights or fictive disputes, may contribute to organizations and institutions, as in youth care settings. Staff tries to down-key playfight invitations to ‚Äútreatment‚Äù or ‚Äúlearning,‚Äù but playfighting also offers youth and staff identificatory respite from the institutional regime. W√§sterfors (2016) has found that playfighting is a recurrent pattern in the social life of a youth care institution and sits at the core of what inmates and staff have to deal with  Seniors  Older adults represent one of the fastest growing populations around the world. In fact, the United Nations predicted an increase of those aged 60 and above from 629 million in 2002 to approximately two billion in 2050 but increased life expectancy does not necessarily translate to a better quality of life. For this reason, research has begun to investigate methods to maintain and/or improve quality of life among older adults. Similar to the data surrounding children and adults, play and activity are associated with improved health and quality of life among seniors. Additionally, play and activity tend to affect successful aging as well as boost well-being throughout the lifespan. Although children, adults, and seniors all tend to benefit from play, older adults often perform it in unique ways to account for possible issues, such as health restrictions, limited accessibility, and revised priorities. For this reason, elderly people may partake in physical exercise groups, interactive video games, and social forums specifically geared towards their needs and interests. One qualitative research study found older adults often chose to engage in specific games such as dominoes, checkers, and bingo for entertainment. Another study indicated a common pattern within game preferences among older adults; seniors often favor activities that encourage mental and physical fitness, incorporate past interests, have some level of competition, and foster a sense of belonging. Researchers investigating play in older adults are also interested in the benefits of technology and video games as therapeutic tools. Studies show these outlets can lower the risk of developing particular diseases, reduce feelings of social isolation and stress, as well as promote creativity and the maintenance of cognitive skills. As a result, play has been integrated into physiotherapy and occupational therapy interventions for seniors.Jung, Y., Li, K.J., Ng, J.S., Wong, G.L.C., & Lee, K. (2009). Proceedings from the 6th Australasian Conference on Interactive Entertainment. Australia. retrieved from hdl.handle.net The ability to incorporate play into one's routine is important because these activities allow participants to express creativity, improve verbal and non-verbal intelligence as well as enhance balance. These benefits may be especially crucial to seniors because evidence shows cognitive and physical functioning declines with age. However, other research argues it might not be aging that is associated with the decline in cognitive and physical capabilities. More specifically, some studies indicate it could be the higher levels of inactivity within older adults that may have significant ramifications on their health and well-being. With attention to these hypotheses, research shows play and activity tend to decline with age which may result in negative outcomes such as social isolation, depression, and mobility issues. American studies found that only 24% of seniors took part in regular physical activity and only 42% use the internet for entertainment purposes. In comparison to other age groups, the elderly are more likely to experience a variety of barriers, such as difficulty with environmental hazards and accessibility related issues, that may hinder their abilities to execute healthy play behaviours. Similarly, although playing may benefit seniors, it also has the potential to negatively impact their health. For example, those who play may be more susceptible to injury. Investigating these barriers may assist in the creation of useful interventions and/or the development of preventative measures, such as establishing safer recreational areas, that promote the maintenance of play behaviours throughout elderly life. A significant amount of literature suggests a moderate level of play has numerous positive outcomes in the lives of senior citizens. In order to support and promote play within the older population, studies suggest institutions should set up more diverse equipment, improve conditions within recreational areas, and create more video games or online forums that appeal to the needs of seniors. Other animals Cocker spaniel playing with a monkey doll Evolutionary psychologists believe that there must be an important benefit of play, as there are so many reasons to avoid it. Many animals are often injured during play, become distracted from predators, and expend valuable energy. In rare cases, play has even been observed between different species that are natural enemies such as a polar bear and a dog.\\"Stuart Brown says play is more than fun,\\" TED talks Yet play seems to be a normal activity with animals who occupy the higher strata of their own hierarchy of needs. Animals on the lower strata, e.g. stressed and starving animals, generally do not play. However, in wild Assamese macaques physically active play is performed also during periods of low food availability and even if it is at the expense of growth, which strongly highlights the developmental and evolutionary importance of play. The social cognitive complexity of numerous species, including dogs, have recently been explored in experimental studies. In one such study, conducted by Alexandra Horowitz of the University of California, the communication and attention-getting skills of dogs were investigated. In a natural setting, dyadic play behavior was observed; head- direction and posture was specifically noted. When one of the two dogs was facing away or otherwise preoccupied, attention-getting behaviors and signals (nudging, barking, growling, pawing, jumping, etc.) were used by the other dog to communicate the intent and/or desire to continue on with the dyadic play. Stronger or more frequent signaling was used if the attention of the other dog was not captured. These observations tell us that these dogs know how play behavior and signaling can be used to capture attention, communicate intent and desire, and manipulate one another. This characteristic and skill, called the \\"attention-getting skill\\" has generally only been seen in humans, but is now being researched and seen in many different species. Observing play behavior in various species can tell us a lot about the player's environment (including the welfare of the animal), personal needs, social rank (if any), immediate relationships, and eligibility for mating. Play activity, often observed through action and signals, often serves as a tool for communication and expression. Through mimicry, chasing, biting, and touching, animals will often act out in ways so as to send messages to one another; whether it's an alert, initiation of play, or expressing intent. When play behavior was observed for a study in Tonkean macaques, it was discovered that play signals weren't always used to initiate play; rather, these signals were viewed primarily as methods of communication (sharing information and attention- getting). A dog plays with a ball. One theory ‚Äì \\"play as preparation\\" ‚Äì was inspired by the observation that play often mimics adult themes of survival. Predators such as lions and bears play by chasing, pouncing, pawing, wrestling, and biting, as they learn to stalk and kill prey. Prey animals such as deer and zebras play by running and leaping as they acquire speed and agility. Hoofed mammals also practice kicking their hind legs to learn to ward off attacks. Indeed, time spent in physical play accelerates motor skill acquisition in wild Assamese macaques. While mimicking adult behavior, attacking actions such as kicking and biting are not completely fulfilled, so playmates do not generally injure each other. In social animals, playing might also help to establish dominance rankings among the young to avoid conflicts as adults. John Byers, a zoologist at the University of Idaho, discovered that the amount of time spent at play for many mammals (e.g. rats and cats) peaks around puberty, and then drops off. This corresponds to the development of the cerebellum, suggesting that play is not so much about practicing exact behaviors, as much as building general connections in the brain. Sergio Pellis and colleagues at the University of Lethbridge in Alberta, Canada, discovered that play may shape the brain in other ways, too. Young mammals have an overabundance of brain cells in their cerebrum (the outer areas of the brain ‚Äì part of what distinguishes mammals). There is evidence that play helps the brain clean up this excess of cells, resulting in a more efficient cerebrum at maturity. Marc Bekoff (a University of Colorado evolutionary biologist) proposes a \\"flexibility\\" hypothesis that attempts to incorporate these newer neurological findings. It argues that play helps animals learn to switch and improvise all behaviors more effectively, to be prepared for the unexpected. There may, however, be other ways to acquire even these benefits of play: the concept of equifinality. The idea is that the social benefits of play for many animals, for example, could instead be garnered by grooming. Patrick Bateson maintains that equifinality is exactly what play teaches. In accordance with the flexibility hypothesis, play may teach animals to avoid \\"false endpoints\\". In other words, they will harness the childlike tendency to keep playing with something that works \\"well enough\\", eventually allowing them to come up with something that might work better, if only in some situations. This also allows mammals to build up various skills that could come in handy in entirely novel situations. A study on two species of monkeys Semnopithecus entellus and Macaca mulatta that came into association with each other during food provisioning by pilgrims at the Ambagarh Forest Reserve, near Jaipur, India, shows the interspecific interaction that developed between the juveniles of the two species when opportunity presented itself.B. Ram Manohar and Reena Mathur (1992) Interspecific Play Behaviour between Hanuman Langur Presbytis entellus and Rhesus Macaque Macaca mulatta Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society 89(1):114.  Development and learning  Learning through play has been long recognized as a critical aspect of childhood and child development. Some of the earliest studies of play started in the 1890s with G. Stanley Hall, the father of the child study movement that sparked an interest in the developmental, mental and behavioral world of babies and children. Play also promotes healthy development of parent-child bonds, establishing social, emotional and cognitive developmental milestones that help them relate to others, manage stress, and learn resiliency. Modern research in the field of affective neuroscience (the neural mechanisms of emotion) has uncovered important links between role play and neurogenesis in the brain.Panksepp, Affective Neuroscience 98 For example, researcher Roger Caillois used the word ilinx to describe the momentary disruption of perception that comes from forms of physical play that disorient the senses, especially balance. Studies have found that play and coping to daily stressors to be positively correlated in children.Goldstein & Russ, 2000‚Äì2001Campos, Frankel, & Camras, 2004 By playing, children regulate their emotions and this is important for adaptive functioning because without regulation, emotions could be overwhelming and stressful. Evolutionary psychologists have begun to explore the phylogenetic relationship between higher intelligence in humans and its relationship to play, i.e., the relationship of play to the progress of whole evolutionary groups as opposed to the psychological implications of play to a specific individual. = Physical, mental and social = Various forms of play, whether it is physical or mental, have influenced cognitive abilities in individuals. As little as ten minutes of exercise (including physical play), can improve cognitive abilities. These researchers did a study and have developed an \\"exergame\\" which is a game that incorporates some physical movement but is by no means formal exercise. These games increase one's heart rate to the level of aerobics exercise and have proven to result in recognizable improvements in mental faculties In this study they use play in a way that incorporates physical activity that creates physical excursions. The results of the study had statistical significance. There were improvements in math by 3.4% and general improvements in recall memory by 4% among the participants of the study. On the other hand, other research has focused on the cognitive effects of mentally stimulating play. Playing video games is one of the most common mediums of play for children and adults today. There has been mixed reviews on the effects of video games. Despite this, according to a research conducted by Hollis (2014), \\"[playing video games] was positively associated with skills strongly related to academic success, such as time management, attention, executive control, memory, and spatial abilities ‚Äì when playing video game occurs in moderation\\".Hollis, S. D. (2014). Cognitive effects and academic consequences of video game playing (Order No. 1566326). Play can also influence one's social development and social interactions. Much of the research focuses on the influence play has on child social development. There are different forms of play that have been noted to influence child social development. One study conducted by (Sullivan, 2003) explores the influence of playing styles with mothers versus playing styles with fathers and how it influences child social development. This article explains that \\"integral to positive development is the child's social competence or, more precisely, the ability to regulate their own emotions and behaviors in the social contexts of early childhood to support the effective accomplishment of relevant developmental tasks.Sinclair, J. et al. (1995). Exergame development using the dual flow model. Proc. IE 2009, 1-7. Social benefits of play have been measured using basic interpersonal values such as getting along with peers.Sullivan, C. (2003). The benefits of parent-child play for the social development of preschoolers with varying levels of anxiety problems. ProQuest, UMI Dissertations. One of the social benefits that this researcher has uncovered is that play with parents has proven to reduce anxiety in children. Having play time with parents that involves socially acceptable behaviour makes it easier for children to relate to be more socially adjusted to peers at school or at play Social development involving child interaction with peers is thus an area of influence for playful interactions with parents and peers. = Play in educational practices =  Anji play  Anji play ÂÆâÂêâÊ∏∏Êàè in simplified Chinese ÂÆâÂêâÈÅäÊà≤ in traditional Chinese is an educational method based on children's self-directed play in outside spaces, using simple tools made of natural material. The teachers and instructors only observe and document the children's independent play. The method was created by Cheng Xueqin and is organized in two hours of free play when the children choose the available material they want to use and build structures to play. While planning, experimenting, building and using the structures to play, the children have the opportunity to interact with peers, to think critically about what may work, to discuss the plan and organize the construction hard work. The process is observed and recorded by the teachers and instructors without intervention, even in instances of possible risk. Before and after the two hours of play, the children have the opportunity to express their plans and discuss with their peers. After the play, they get the opportunity to draw, write or explain what they did. Then, they watch the videos recorded the same day and explain how they played and comment on each other's creations. Anji play is also called ‚Äútrue play‚Äù and its guiding principles are love, risk, joy, engagement, and reflection. This method of self-initiated and self-directed play is applied at the pre-schools (to children from 3 to 6 years-old) in Anji county, East China. ReferencesFurther reading * Caillois, R. (2001).

Herbert is a World War II veteran who is an elderly neighbor of the Griffin family who first appeared in the season 3 episode \\"To Love and Die in Dixie\\". He is attracted to young boys, and harbors unrequited love for Chris Griffin, though most other citizens of Quahog are oblivious to his sexuality. Henry defines Herbert as a homosexual pedophile, although speaking in clinical terms this is not the case. Herbert has received mixed reviews from critics, who have expressed varying opinions on the pedophilia-related humor involving the character. Herbert has appeared in various Family Guy merchandise and has made several crossover appearances in The Cleveland Show, a Family Guy spin-off. Role in Family Guy Herbert lives in the fictional town of Quahog, Rhode Island, which is modeled after Cranston, Rhode Island. He is an elderly man who dresses in a baby blue bathrobe and utilizes a walking frame due to his age; his dog Jesse is similarly elderly and decrepit, being unable to use his hind legs. In his first appearance, \\"To Love and Die in Dixie\\" (season 3, 2001), Herbert attempts to seduce Chris inside the house by offering him a popsicle that Herbert insists is in his basement. Despite his pleas, Chris refuses the offer. In the episode \\"The Courtship of Stewie's Father\\" (season 4, 2005), Chris breaks Herbert's window with a baseball and, in attempts to pay off the debt, Chris helps Herbert with chores around his house, much to Herbert's delight. Herbert later invites him to dinner. When Chris gets a new job in \\"Movin' Out (Brian's Song)\\" (season 6, 2007), his brother Stewie takes over his paper route; Herbert tries to seduce him but is rebuffed by Stewie, who refers to him as a \\"perverted old freak\\", though this only furthers his lust for the infant. In the episode \\"Play It Again, Brian\\" (season 6, 2008), Herbert is hired by Peter and Lois to babysit their children Chris, Stewie and Meg, an offer which excites him so greatly, Herbert erupts into the song \\"All I Need is the Girl\\" (though modified to reflect his unrequited homosexual affection for Chris). He claims to have no interest in Meg because of her age and gender, and is disappointed when she is only of the three to bathe him. Herbert has a grand-niece, Sandy, whom he helps attract Chris in the style of Cyrano de Bergerac in the episode \\"Valentine's Day in Quahog\\" (season 11, 2013). In the episode \\"Padre de Familia\\" (season 6, 2007), Herbert is revealed to be a war veteran, as he is shown singing \\"God Bless the USA\\" in a local Veterans Day parade. This is furthered in the season 9 (2011) episode \\"German Guy\\", in which Herbert reveals he was a member of the United States Army Air Forces during World War II and was captured by Wehrmacht forces when he was shot down over Germany while escorting a bombing raid. Although the Nazi forces initially wished to place Herbert in a prisoner-of-war camp, they instead placed him in Dachau Concentration Camp due to their discovery of several pictures of underage boys on his person, prompting them to accuse him of being homosexual. Years later, Herbert discovers his tormentor, SS Lieutenant Franz Schlechtnacht, makes a living in Quahog selling puppets, and becomes frightened by his new friendship with Chris. Herbert has appeared on various occasions in Family Guy spinoffs, such as in various cutaway gags in several episodes of The Cleveland Show. In Laugh It Up, Fuzzball: The Family Guy Trilogy, Herbert appears as Obi-Wan Kenobi. Production Mike Henry created Herbert and provides his voice. Herbert was created by writer and voice actor Mike Henry. Henry met Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane when his brother Patrick was a classmate of MacFarlane's at the Rhode Island School of Design. Henry was invited to write and create characters for Family Guy after the show was picked up. The first character he created was Cleveland Brown, and he later created Herbert. Herbert was not originally a pedophile; Henry pitched the idea to the writers of the show, leading to the decision to make him one. As with most of the other characters he created, Henry voices Herbert. Henry based Herbert's voice and appearance on an elderly man he met when he worked in a grocery store when he was in high school. In an interview Henry described that man as a sweet person. Reception IGN, an American entertainment website, has generally commented positively on him. They pointed out that Herbert is one of the most popular recurring characters in the series, referring to him (with his dog Jesse) as one of the characters that stuck out from the rest. They also noted that one of the reasons Herbert is funny is because of his \\"soft, high-pitched whistling voice\\". Although IGN has praised Herbert in general they have criticized some aspects of him. In their review of \\"Blue Harvest\\", a retelling and parody of the 1977 film Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, recasting the show's characters into Star Wars roles, IGN criticized the choice of putting Herbert in the role of Obi-Wan Kenobi, stating that it never creates any actual humor. They also criticized the constant use of Herbert, commenting that it was entertaining for the first two times, but that it quickly became overused. In their list of \\"What Else Should Family Guy Make Fun Of?\\", IGN commented that Herbert would be perfect to play Major Toht and Hogwarts' new Defence Against the Dark Arts instructor should Family Guy ever decide to make parodies of Raiders of the Lost Ark and Harry Potter, respectively. A February 2015 article written by Hanh Nguyen for TV Guide listed pedophilia among the 12 biggest taboos shown on Family Guy, naming Herbert as the \\"creepiest of all\\" references to the disorder. Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club criticized the character as an example of how the series occasionally fails in its deliberately offensive humor. He called him \\"a black hole of shittiness whose every appearance brings out the worst tendencies of Family Guy\\", adding that his \\"appearance brings every episode he's in to a screeching halt\\". Herbert, along with his dog Jesse, ranked spot number 16 in IGN's \\"Top 25 Family Guy Characters\\". Herbert also ranked number five on IGN's \\"The Cleveland Show Casting Couch\\", which showed characters that IGN would find interesting to put in The Cleveland Show. Merchandise In 2004, the first series of Family Guy toy figurines was released by Mezco Toyz. Each member of the Griffin family and other characters (including Herbert) had their own toy, with the exception of Stewie, of whom two different figures were made. Over the course of two years, four more series of toy figures have been released. Herbert is also featured on the Family Guy: Live in Vegas CD.

He is also Research Chair of the International Psychoanalytical Association (since 2013). Solms founded the International Neuropsychoanalysis Society in 2000 and he was a Founding Editor (with Ed Nersessian) of the journal Neuropsychoanalysis. He is Director of the Arnold Pfeffer Center for Neuropsychoanalysis at the New York Psychoanalytic Institute. He is also Director of the Neuropsychoanalysis Foundation in New York, a Trustee of the Neuropsychoanalysis Fund in London, and Director of the Neuropsychoanalysis Trust in Cape Town. He is the lead educator of the free online course, What is a Mind? on the platform FutureLearn. Background and education Mark Leonard de Gier Solms was born in L√ºderitz in Namibia. His ancestor Johann Adam Solms (1792‚Äì1854) was born in the winegrowing town of Nackenheim in the Electorate of Mainz, and moved to the Cape Colony from the then-Grand Duchy of Hesse in 1838. Solms was not noble and there is no evidence of any relation to the princely House of Solms.Mark Solms and his family are not mentioned in the coverage of the noble and princely Solms family in Genealogisches Handbuch des Adels. Adelslexikon Vol. XIII, Vol. 128 of the entire series. Starke, Limburg (Lahn) 2002, ISSN 0435-2408. The family's ancestors can only be traced to the 18th century and probably adopted the name Solms from a town or territory named Solms, a relatively common practice. Despite the lack of a relation to the princely family Mark Solms and some of his family members have used the coat of arms of the unrelated princely family, including as the logo of his Solms Delta wine estate. Mark Solms was educated at Pretoria Boys High School in South Africa. He then attended the University of the Witwatersrand, where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in Psychology (1984), an Honours degree in Applied Psychology (1985), a master's degree in Research Psychology (1987) and a PhD in Neuropsychology (1992). He emigrated to London in 1988, where he worked academically at University College London (Psychology Department) and clinically at the Royal London Hospital (Neurosurgery Department), while he trained at the Institute of Psychoanalysis (1989-1994). During this period, he established the first neuropsychoanalytic clinical service at the Anna Freud Centre. Contribution to neuropsychoanalysis Mark Solms is best known for his discovery of the forebrain mechanisms of dreaming,Solms, M. (2000). 'Dreaming and REM sleep are controlled by different brain mechanisms'. Behav. Brain Sci., 23: 843-50. and for his integration of psychoanalytic theories and methods with those of modern neuroscience.Solms, M. (1998). 'Preliminaries for an integration of psychoanalysis and neuroscience. Presented at a meeting of the Contemporary Freudian Group of the British Psycho-Analytical Society. He is reportedly the first person to have used the term neuropsychoanalysis. Solms' work tries to connect the theories and findings of psychoanalysis, a science of the mind (subjective thoughts, feelings, memories, etc.), with modern neuroscientific knowledge of the objective anatomical structure and functions of the brain. The renowned case of Phineas Gage, who had traumatic brain injury caused by a tamping iron, is traditionally used to illustrate these connections. Gage was physically recovered but his mind was radically changed and his friends and acquaintances said that he was 'no longer Gage'.Harlow, J. (1868). 'Recovery from the passage of an iron bar through the head'. Massachusetts Med. Soc. Publ., 2: 329-347. According to Solms, these clinical observations demonstrate that the brain and the personality are inextricable. They make it clear that the object of study in psychoanalysis is somehow intrinsically connected with the object of study of neuroscience. Solms is convinced that the only way to fully understand the brain is by bringing back together psychoanalysis and neuroscience. The pivotal aim of Solms' work is to provide an empirical method by which psychoanalysis can rejoin neuroscience in a way that is compatible with Freud's basic assumptions. In order to accomplish that, Solms relies on one of the major developments within neuroscience since Freud's death: the work of Alexander Romanovich Luria. Luria's method identifies the neurological organization of any mental function without contradicting the fundamental assumptions of psychoanalysis. Hence, a viable bridge is established between the concepts of psychology, those of anatomy, physiology and all the other branches of neurological science. Solms elaborates and formulates a new approach to investigate the deeper strata of the mind by implementing neuropsychoanalysis thinking: \\"I am recommending that we chart the neurological organization of the deepest strata of the mind, using a psychoanalytic version of syndrome analysis, by studying the deep structure of the mental changes that can be discerned in neurological patients within a psychoanalytic relationship.\\" Recognition Mark Solms has received numerous awards, notably Honorary Membership of the New York Psychoanalytic Society in 1998, the American College of Psychoanalysts in 2004 and the American College of Psychiatrists in 2015. Other awards include: * Harry Oppenheimer Fellowship Award by the Oppenheimer Memorial Trust (2017) * Sigmund Freud Award by the American Society of Psychoanalytic Physicians (2013) * Eli W. Lane Memorial Award by the Southwest Psychoanalytic Society, University of Arizona [awarded twice] (2012 & 2013) * Sigourney Award by the Mary Sigourney Trust (2011) * Oscar Sternbach Award for Outstanding Dedication and Contributions to Psychoanalysis (2009) * Arnold Pfeffer Prize by the New York Psychoanalytic Institute (2008) * Hans W.

Kaplan-Solms] by the National Association for the Advancement of Psychoanalysis (2001) * International Psychiatrist Lecture by the American Psychiatric Association (2001) * George Sarton Medal by the Rijksuniversiteit Gent, Belgium (1996). Publications He has published widely in both neuroscientific and psychoanalytic journals, including Cortex (journal), Neuropsychologia, Trends in Cognitive Sciences and Behavioral and Brain Sciences. He is also frequently published in general- interest journals, such as Scientific American . He has published more than 250 articles and book chapters, and 6 books. His second book, The Neuropsychology of Dreams (1997), was a landmark contribution to the field. His 2002 book (with Oliver Turnbull), The Brain and the Inner World was a best-seller and has been translated into 13 languages. He is the authorised editor and translator of the forthcoming Revised Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud (24 vols) and the Complete Neuroscientific Works of Sigmund Freud (4 vols). Personal life Solms is married to Karen Kaplan-Solms, who is also a psychoanalyst and neuropsychologist. Together they wrote the book Clinical Studies in Neuropsychoanalysis in 2001, which received the Gradiva Award for Best Book (Science Category) by the National Association for the Advancement of Psychoanalysis, USA.They have a son (Leonard, born in 1996) and a daughter (Ella, born in 2000) and they live near Cape Town, South Africa. Other activities Outside academia, Mark Solms pursues a different passion: winemaking. Solms-Delta is a farm, located in the Franschhoek Valley, with a rich history and prize-winning wines. Solms took over custodianship of the farm in 2001. Its 325-year history was deeply rooted in slavery, but Solms decided to transform the farm into a cooperative. Now, all 180 inhabitants of the land and previously workers for the farm, along with Solms and British philanthropist Richard Astor are co-owners. Solms affirms that worker subjectivity is important for the quality of the final product: \\"Wine is made by hand, and the attitude of the labourers affects what is in the bottle, from the way they tend the vines and select the grapes. If someone is preparing it with resentment and hatred, what will he make?\\" ReferencesExternal links * * Category:1961 births Category:Living people Category:University of Cape Town academics Category:Psychoanalysts Category:University of the Witwatersrand alumni Category:Alumni of Pretoria Boys High School Category:South African people of German descent ","title":"Mark Solms"},{"id":"18006902","text":"Kong Sam Ol (born 1 November 1936) is a Cambodian politician who has been Minister of the Royal Palace since 1998.

The theatre, generally known as \\"The Baxter\\", a performing arts complex in Rondebosch, a suburb of Cape Town, was named in his honour. Early life Baxter was the third son of David William and Jane Baxter, his father being a jute manufacturer. Baxter attended school and college in Dundee and in 1886 he emigrated to South Africa, where he joined William Duncan and Co. in Cape Town, a drapery business of his uncle. When his uncle died in 1895, he became the owner of the business. Public life Baxter showed great interest in political and civic affairs and from 1904 he was a member of the Cape Town City Council and Mayor of Cape Town, from 1907 to 1908. In the organized commerce movement, he served as president of the Cape Town Chamber of Commerce from 1916 to 1918, and again from 1926 to 1928. He was also president of the Association of Chambers of Commerce in South Africa in 1918.

(2001) Business Review Knowledge Spillovers: Cities' Role in the New Economy. Q4 2001. In knowledge management economics, knowledge spillovers are non-rival knowledge market costs incurred by a party not agreeing to assume the costs that has a spillover effect of stimulating technological improvements in a neighbor through one's own innovation.Jaffe, Adam B.; Trajtenberg, Manuel; Fogarty, Michael S. (May, 2000) The American Economic Review Knowledge Spillovers and Patent Citations:Evidence from a Survey of Inventors. Vol. 90, No. 2, Papers and Proceedings of the One Hundred Twelfth Annual Meeting of the American Economic Association, pp. 215-218. Such innovations often come from specialization within an industry. A recent, general example of a knowledge spillover could be the collective growth associated with the research and development of online social networking tools like Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter. Such tools have not only created a positive feedback loop, and a host of originally unintended benefits for their users, but have also created an explosion of new software, programming platforms, and conceptual breakthroughs that have perpetuated the development of the industry as a whole. The advent of online marketplaces, the utilization of user profiles, the widespread democratization of information, and the interconnectivity between tools within the industry have all been products of each tool's individual developments. These developments have since spread outside the industry into the mainstream media as news and entertainment firms have developed their own market feedback applications within the tools themselves, and their own versions of online networking tools (e.g. CNN‚Äôs iReport). There are two kinds of knowledge spillovers: internal and external. Internal knowledge spillover occurs if there is a positive impact of knowledge between individuals within an organization that produces goods and/or services. An external knowledge spillover occurs when the positive impact of knowledge is between individuals without or outside of a production organization. Marshall‚ÄìArrow‚ÄìRomer (MAR) spillovers, Porter spillovers and Jacobs spillovers are three types of spillovers.  Marshall‚ÄìArrow‚ÄìRomer spillover  A business park in Santa Barbara County, California that may generate MAR spillover Marshall‚ÄìArrow‚ÄìRomer (MAR) spillover has its origins in 1890, where the English economist Alfred Marshall developed a theory of knowledge spillovers. Knowledge spillovers later were extended by economists Kenneth Arrow (1962) and Paul Romer (1986). In 1992, Edward Glaeser, Hedi Kallal, Jos√© Scheinkman, and Andrei Shleifer pulled together the _M_ arshall‚Äì _A_ rrow‚Äì _R_ omer views on knowledge spillovers and accordingly named the view MAR spillover in 1992.Glaeser et al., \\"Growth in Cities\\", Journal of Political Economy, 1992 Vol. 100, No. 6 Under the Marshall‚ÄìArrow‚ÄìRomer (MAR) spillover view, the proximity of firms within a common industry often affects how well knowledge travels among firms to facilitate innovation and growth. The closer the firms are to one another, the greater the MAR spillover. The exchange of ideas is largely from employee to employee, in that employees from different firms in an industry exchange ideas about new products and new ways to produce goods. The opportunity to exchange ideas that lead to innovations key to new products and improved production methods. Business parks are a good example of concentrated businesses that may benefit from MAR spillover. Many semiconductor firms intentionally located their research and development facilities in Silicon Valley to take advantage of MAR spillover. In addition, the film industry in Los Angeles, California and elsewhere relies on a geographic concentration of specialists (directors, producers, scriptwriters, and set designers) to bring together narrow aspects of movie-making into a final product. However, research on the Cambridge IT Cluster (UK) suggests that technological knowledge spillovers might only happen rarely and are less important than other cluster benefits such as labour market pooling. Porter spillover Porter (1990), like MAR, argues that knowledge spillovers in specialized, geographically concentrated industries stimulate growth. He insists, however, that local competition, as opposed to local monopoly, fosters the pursuit and rapid adoption of innovation. He gives examples of Italian ceramics and gold jewellery industries, in which hundreds of firms are located together and fiercely compete to innovate since the alternative to innovation is demise. Porter's externalities are maximized in cities with geographically specialized, competitive industries. Jacobs spillover Under the Jacobs spillover view, the proximity of firms from different industries affect how well knowledge travels among firms to facilitate innovation and growth. This is in contrast to MAR spillovers, which focus on firms in a common industry. The diverse proximity of a Jacobs spillover brings together ideas among individuals with different perspectives to encourage an exchange of ideas and foster innovation in an industrially diverse environment. Developed in 1969 by urbanist Jane Jacobs and John Jackson the concept that Detroit‚Äôs shipbuilding industry from the 1830s was the critical antecedent leading to the 1890s development of the auto industry in Detroit since the gasoline engine firms easily transitioned from building gasoline engines for ships to building them for automobiles.  Incoming and outgoing spillovers  Knowledge spillover has asymmetric directions. The focal entity and receives or outflows know-how to others, creating incoming and outgoing spillovers. Cassiman and Veugelers (2002) use survey data and estimate incoming and outgoing spillover and study the economic impacts. Incoming spillover increases growth opportunity and productivity improvements of receivers, while outgoing spillover leads to free rider problem in the technology competition. Chen et al. (2013) use econometric method to gauge incoming spillover, a way that applies for all companies without survey. They find that incoming spillover explains R&D; profits of industrial firms. Policy implications As information is largely non-rival in nature, certain measures must be taken to ensure that, for the originator, the information remains a private asset. As the market cannot do this efficiently, public regulations have been implemented to facilitate a more appropriate equilibrium. As a result, the concept of intellectual property rights have developed and ensure the ability of entrepreneurs to temporarily hold on to the profitability of their ideas through patents, copyrights, and other governmental safeguards. Conversely, such barriers to entry prevent the exploitation of informational developments by rival firms within an industry. On the other hand, when the research and development of a private firm results in a social benefit, unaccounted for within the market price, often greater than the private return of the firm's research, then a subsidy to offset the underproduction of that benefit might be offered to the firm in return for its continued output of that benefit. Government subsidies are often controversial, and while they might often result in a more appropriate social equilibrium, they could also lead to undesirable political repercussions as such a subsidy must come from taxpayers, some of whom may not directly benefit from the researching firm's subsidized knowledge spillover. The concept of knowledge spillover is also used to justify subsidies to foreign direct investment, as foreign investors help diffuse technology among local firms.

Karl Krumbacher assigned him to the first half of the sixth century. He is variously placed by other scholars, from the fifth to the ninth century. However, today it is unquestionable that his life spanned the late sixth/early seventh centuries.  Works  His principal work is a commentary on the Book of Revelation (Patrologia Graeca vol. 106, cols. 215‚Äì458 and 1387‚Äì94) and is the oldest Greek patristic commentary on that book of the Bible. The very first Greek commentary on Revelation barely predates Andrew's work and is attributed to \\"Oikoumenios.\\" Oikoumenios is not a recognized Father of the Church. Therefore, Andrew of Caesarea's work is correctly identified as the earliest Greek Patristic commentary on the Apocalypse. Most subsequent Eastern Christian commentators of the Book of Revelation have drawn heavily upon Andrew and his commentary, which was preserved in nearly 100 complete Greek manuscripts, as well in translation in Armenian, Georgian, and Slavonic manuscripts. Andrew's most important contribution was that he preserved many existing Eastern traditions associated with Revelation, both oral and written. His commentary was so influential that it preserved a specific text type for Revelation, known as the Andreas type. An unpublished study of the work, including an English translation, was made as a thesis by Dr. Eugenia Constantinou in 2008. The English translation of Andrew's commentary has been published by Catholic University of America Press as part of the Fathers of the Church series and became available in November 2011.

He specializes in population economics and applied econometrics. The Assistant Director of the program is Elaine McBeth, who received her Ph.D. from the University of Virginia in 1987. Professor McBeth has been at the College since 1988 and became Associate Director of the Thomas Jefferson Program in Public Policy in 1993. Her teaching interests include monetary theory and policy, financial market regulation, mathematical economics and stabilization policy. =Graduate program= The two-year master's degree (MPP) program is designed to prepare students for career placement at the strategic levels of public policy, both in the public sector and in private sector firms such as regulated industries and consulting firms with government clients.Graduate Program  The Jefferson Program It is limited to 25 new students each fall. Four program areas are offered, with a strong overall emphasis on the applied and analytical skills leading to career placement at the strategic levels of public policy. The TJPPP program is heavily quantitative, so well-suited students often hold backgrounds in mathematics, economics or statistics. =Undergraduate program= Students pursuing the undergraduate major study economics, statistics, politics, law, ethics, and policy domains. This grounding is preparation for further study at the graduate level and for participating effectively in the policy process at government agencies, nonprofit organizations, and private sector firms.  Master's program requirements Required classes= First year MPP students must take or test out of the following classes: * Mathematics and Public Policy * Quantitative Analysis I * Law and Public Policy * The Political Environment * Advanced Microeconomics * Quantitative Analysis II (Econometrics) * Benefit- Cost Analysis * Public Management Second year MPP students must take the following classes: * Policy Research Seminar * Ethics and Public Policy * A law class of the student's choosing, done in conjunction with the William & Mary Law School. =Summer internship= During the summer between students' first and second years, they are required to complete a ten-week internship. Students are expected to obtain an internship within their area of interest and gain relevant work experience. Some recent internship placements include: * Department of Health and Human Services * Lockheed Martin * Deloitte and Touche * Federal Bureau of Investigation * James City County * Project on National Security Reform * American Association for the Advancement of Science * Government Accountability Office * U.S. Coast Guard * Department of State * Red Cross =Washington Policy Dialogues= Two to three times per semester, a small number of TJPPP students go to Washington, DC to hear a set of speakers arranged by the program. The event lasts one day, usually Fridays, and two to three different speakers are heard; all of whom are relevant to a single policy area (education, national security, etc.). The meetings are small and give students opportunity to ask questions about the policy area. Students are required to attend one dialogue per year. =Washington Program= During the Fall Semester of the first year, students take a three-day-long trip to Washington, DC. Students learn primarily about various professional opportunities that await them upon graduation. =Policy research seminar= Students must complete a large policy research project in their third semester in order to graduate. Students are placed into groups with similar policy interests. The project is client driven, so students work with an established member of the policy community to draft a report and present it to multiple audiences.

Located approximately away, the star varies between apparent magnitudes 6.32 and 6.42 over a period of approximately 3.74 days. Spectrum CG Andromedae is also a chemically peculiar star with a strong magnetic field, or Ap star, with a spectral type A0IIspSiSrHg. This means that it's a bright giant star that shows narrow absorption lines and unusual strong lines of silicium, strontium and mercury. Calcium and manganese lines are weaker than expected instead. Other sources report that the stronger lines are of silicium and europium, thus giving a spectral classification B9pSiEu, which has just a slightly different temperature for the blackbody emission in addition to the different lines. Variability Like in Alpha¬≤ Canum Venaticorum variable stars, CG Andromedae shows a variation of luminosity and one in the strength of spectral lines with the same period of approximately 3.74 days. It is thought that this is caused by an inhomogeneous distribution of elements on the surface of the star, which cause an inhomogeneous surface brightness. A shorter period, slightly longer than 2 hours, with an amplitude of 0.011 magnitudes has been observed in the light curve of CG Andromedae; however, with a temperature of 11,000 K, it lies outside the instability strip of the HR diagram where rapidly oscillating Ap stars are located. Magnetohydrodynamic waves propagating in the star could explain the observed variability.

The Bike Train initiative is independently coordinated, promoted, and ticketed service, utilizing existing Via Rail passenger trains, with an additional baggage car containing bike racks for 56 bicycles. Each passenger ticket for scheduled Bike Train departures includes both a passenger seat and a bike rack reservation. The Bike Train initiative was developed in response to the growing tourism demand and economic opportunity for improved transportation access for cyclists between Toronto and the Niagara Region.  History  Project founder Justin Lafontaine conceptualized the idea for the Toronto-Niagara Bike Train Initiative during a trip to the Niagara Region in April 2006. On that trip, he accompanied the Waterfront Regeneration Trust and several others from the region on their annual Lake Ontario Waterfront Trail cycle tour from Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario to Grimsby, Ontario. Impressed with the many trails, diverse landscapes, towns, cities and attractions, he began planning another trip to the region. When discussing the opportunities for cycle tourism with a fellow rider, Justin discovered that there was no convenient transportation option for cyclists between Toronto and the Niagara Region; the existing train service did not provide baggage capacity, and buses usually require bikes to be boxed prior to loading. This led him to Via Rail Canada and other partners to discuss the potential to introduce a Bike Train service ‚Äì a concept that garnered support from government contacts, tourism organizations, small businesses, media and the public. A project proposal was subsequently developed for the Ontario Ministry of Tourism - Investment Development Office and funding for the Pilot Year of the Toronto-Niagara Bike Train Initiative was announced in January 2007. In 2008, The Bike Train received further funding support from the Ontario Ministry of the Environment and the Friends of the Greenbelt Foundation. In 2009, with the support from the Ontario Trillium Foundation, Friends of the Greenbelt Foundation and the Ontario Ministry of Tourism the Bike Train expanded to two new routes. The Ontario North route took passengers from Toronto to North Bay using the Ontario Northland's passenger rail service for a pilot weekend in August.

The photo shows the principal facade along Olive Street. History The Customhouse and Post Office was constructed under the supervision of architect James G, Hill and construction superintendent Thomas Walsh, for a total cost of $5,686,854.68. The third floor of building was occupied by the U.S District Court until 1935, when it moved to new quarters at 12th and Market streets. The Post Office remained until 1970, occupying the main basement and the first floor. A number of Federal agencies were housed on the fourth floor. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri met at this courthouse until 1935, and the U.S. Circuit Court that district met here until that court was abolished in 1912. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit met here from 1891 until 1935. It was transferred from the U.S. General Services Administration to the State of Missouri through the Federal Historic Surplus Property Program in September 2004. It is currently a mixed- use facility serving federal, state, and private purposes. The building was to the downtown campus for Webster University until the campus was relocated to the adjacent Arcade Building upon the completion of its renovation in late 2015. Soon after, Lindenwood University announced it would relocate its downtown campus to Webster University's former space. The Missouri Court of Appeals, Eastern District, also occupies the building.

It was proposed by Pascual Jordan and Eugene Wigner for one-dimensional lattice models, but now two- dimensional analogues of the transformation have also been created. The Jordan‚ÄìWigner transformation is often used to exactly solve 1D spin-chains such as the Ising and XY models by transforming the spin operators to fermionic operators and then diagonalizing in the fermionic basis. This transformation actually shows that the distinction between spin-1/2 particles and fermions is nonexistent. It can be applied to systems with an arbitrary dimension. Analogy between spins and fermions In what follows we will show how to map a 1D spin chain of spin-1/2 particles to fermions. Take spin-1/2 Pauli operators acting on a site j of a 1D chain, \\\\sigma_{j}^{+}, \\\\sigma_{j}^{-}, \\\\sigma_{j}^{z}. Taking the anticommutator of \\\\sigma_{j}^{+} and \\\\sigma_{j}^{-}, we find \\\\\\\\{\\\\sigma_{j}^{+},\\\\sigma_{j}^{-}\\\\\\\\} = 1, as would be expected from fermionic creation and annihilation operators. We might then be tempted to set :\\\\sigma_{j}^{+} = (\\\\sigma_{j}^{x}+i\\\\sigma_{j}^{y})/2 = f_{j}^{\\\\dagger} :\\\\sigma_{j}^{-} = (\\\\sigma_{j}^{x}-i\\\\sigma_{j}^{y})/2 = f_{j} :\\\\sigma_{j}^{z} = 2f_{j}^{\\\\dagger}f_{j} - 1. Now, we have the correct same- site fermionic relations \\\\\\\\{f_{j}^{\\\\dagger}, f_{j}\\\\\\\\}=1; however, on different sites, we have the relation [f_{j}^{\\\\dagger},f_{k}] = 0, where j eq k, and so spins on different sites commute unlike fermions which anti-commute. We must remedy this before we can take the analogy very seriously. A transformation which recovers the true fermion commutation relations from spin-operators was performed in 1928 by Jordan and Wigner. This is a special example of a Klein transformation. We take a chain of fermions, and define a new set of operators :a_{j}^{\\\\dagger} = e^{\\\\left(+i\\\\pi \\\\sum_{k=1}^{j-1}f_{k}^{\\\\dagger} f_{k}\\\\right)} \\\\cdot f_{j}^{\\\\dagger} :a_{j} = e^{\\\\left(-i\\\\pi \\\\sum_{k=1}^{j-1}f_{k}^{\\\\dagger} f_{k}\\\\right)} \\\\cdot f_{j} :a_{j}^{\\\\dagger} a_{j} = f_{j}^{\\\\dagger} f_{j}. They differ from the above only by a phase e^{\\\\pm i\\\\pi \\\\sum_{k=1}^{j-1}f_{k}^{\\\\dagger} f_{k}}. The phase is determined by the number of occupied fermionic modes in modes k=1,\\\\ldots,j-1 of the field. The phase is equal to +1 if the number of occupied modes is even, and -1 if the number of occupied modes is odd. This phase is often expressed as :e^{\\\\left(\\\\pm i\\\\pi \\\\sum_{k=1}^{j-1}f_{k}^{\\\\dagger} f_{k}\\\\right)}=\\\\prod_{k=1}^{j-1}e^{\\\\pm i\\\\pi f_{k}^{\\\\dagger} f_{k}}=\\\\prod_{k=1}^{j-1}(1-2f_{k}^{\\\\dagger} f_{k})=\\\\prod_{k=1}^{j-1}(-\\\\sigma_{k}^{z}). Where the second equality makes use of the fact that f_{k}^{\\\\dagger} f_{k}\\\\in\\\\\\\\{0, 1\\\\\\\\}. The transformed spin operators now have the appropriate fermionic commutation relations :\\\\\\\\{a_i^\\\\dagger, a_j\\\\\\\\}=\\\\delta_{i,j}, \\\\, \\\\\\\\{a_i^\\\\dagger, a_j^\\\\dagger\\\\\\\\}=0, \\\\, \\\\\\\\{a_i, a_j\\\\\\\\}=0. The inverse transformation is given by :\\\\sigma_{j}^{+} = e^{\\\\left(-i\\\\pi \\\\sum_{k=1}^{j-1}a_{k}^{\\\\dagger} a_{k}\\\\right)} \\\\cdot a_{j}^{\\\\dagger} :\\\\sigma_{j}^{-} = e^{\\\\left(+i\\\\pi \\\\sum_{k=1}^{j-1}a_{k}^{\\\\dagger} a_{k}\\\\right)} \\\\cdot a_{j} :\\\\sigma_{j}^{z} = 2a_{j}^{\\\\dagger}a_{j} - 1 Note that the definition of the fermionic operators is nonlocal with respect to the bosonic operators because we have to deal with an entire chain of operators to the left of the site the fermionic operators are defined with respect to. This is also true the other way around. This is an example of a 't Hooft operator, which is a disorder operator instead of an order operator. This is also an example of an S-duality. If the system has more than one dimension the transformation can still be applied. It is only necessary to label the sites in an arbitrary way by a single index.

Overview Dunalastair Water lies at the approximate grid reference of it has an area of 165 hectares, being 2.5 km long and 800 metres wide at its broadest point. It was formed by the damming of the River Tummel by the Grampian Electric Supply Company in 1933 as part of the Tummel hydro-electric power scheme. The reservoir is narrow at its head, taking the form of a slender wooded glen with the Dunalastair estate situated on the northern bank. The reservoir has roads running on both its northern and southern shores, the B846, which is the road between Pitlochry and Rannoch railway station runs on the northern shore while a minor road from Kinloch Rannoch runs on its southern side. The Water is hemmed in by high ground to the north and south, with Beinn a' Chuallaich to the north and Schiehallion to the south. The dam itself is 65 metres wide and has two floodgates and several spillways due to the quantity of water which sometimes needs to be released Into the River Tummel. The main purpose of the dam is to act as an intake which supplies water to an open 15 metre wide concrete aqueduct that runs to the south of the River Tummel. The aqueduct flows for five km losing very little height, keeping to the 200 metre contour before feeding the Tummel hydroelectricity power station at the head of Loch Tummel through two large pipes.

Originally released through Code666 label in early 2000, the album was reissued two years later by Earache's sub-label Elitist. Bonus tracks on the reissue were three songs from the 1998 demo Opera and two remixes; this release was re-titled as Rephormula. At the time, Ephel Duath consisted of Giuliano Mogicato and Davide Tiso, both playing guitar, accompanied by synthesizers and programmed drums. Mogicato was the main composer of the album, but both members of Ephel Duath added their ideas to the arrangements, with influences from old Norwegian black metal mixed with electronic music.  Background  Ephel Duath was formed in Padova, Veneto, in February 1998, initially as a studio project, by the duo of Davide Tiso (vocals, guitar, keyboards) and Giuliano Mogicato (vocals, guitar, bass). The project debuted in October that same year with the demo Opera. This recording sold over 1,000 copies and topped MP3.com's heavy metal charts with over 20,000 free downloads, which drew attention of the newly founded Italian label Code666 who signed the band in late 1999. The duo recorded and mixed the album at Fear Studio in Ravenna, Italy. Phormula was released in May 2000 and was well- received by critics, who generally praised the creativity of musicians as well as their experimental combination of electronic music and extreme metal. However, this success did not prevent the departure of Giuliano Mogicato in June 2001. In a 2008 interview with Avantgarde-metal.com, Davide Tiso discussed the departure of Mogicato: > We have been a great communion for a lot of years, but after the Phormula > recording session, my bandmate Giuliano [Mogicato] became completely > confused regarding the Ephel Duath‚Äôs future. He wanted to move the new sound > to some \\"anti-metal\\" form; Ephel Duath in his conception would be an > instrumental band with percussion, cello and others acoustic instruments. I > preferred to continue alone, because I thought he would destroy the spirit > of the band. Later in 2001, the Code7 agency (a division of the Code666 label) sent the band to sign a four-album deal with Elitist Records, a sub-label of Earache Records. In early 2002, Earache/Elitist decided to re-release Phormula, adding two remixed songs and a sampling of Ephel Duath's original demo, 1998's Opera, as bonus tracks, and changed the title to Rephormula.  Style and influences  The music on Phormula, including that of the bonus tracks on Rephormula, was mainly written by Giuliano Mogicato, then the band's main composer. The band's ideas and arrangements have been influenced by the raw sound of the older era Emperor and Limbonic Art, but incorporated dark, gothic, and avant- garde musical elements in the songs' structures. In a 2002 interview with webzine Chronicles of Chaos, Davide Tiso stated that Ephel Duath compositions are made in a \\"very spontaneous\\" way, and noting the band's complex arrangements, he added: \\"It just flows from within us. We [Davide Tiso and Giuliano Mogicato] love to have spontaneity with what we do, a lot of it comes from the initial guitar lines that act as a skeleton for the song at hand. [...] We try to keep our ideas very open to every style of influence and bring that somehow into what we do.\\"  Reception  Phormula and Rephormula received generally positive reviews. A writer in the Romanian magazine Negura said, \\"It's full of magic and mystery and you can sense there‚Äôs a whole (alchemic) process going on at the same beside the music.\\" Jason Taylor of Allmusic said that the album \\"is certainly one of the most intriguing black metal albums to be released.\\" He also praised the reissue as a \\"welcome introduction\\" to the duo's music. The webzine Chronicles of Chaos praised the album's tempo as \\"simultaneously innovative and enjoyable.\\" Stylus Magazine reviewer Cosmo Lee stated that Phormula \\"ran Norwegian black metal through a funhouse of electronics and demented wackiness.\\" Regarding the use of a drum machine, critics were of different opinions; Pedro Azevedo of Chronicles of Chaos considered it \\"well used [...] despite some less than perfect passages\\", while Negura's writer saw what he called \\"electronic drums\\" (a drum machine was used) as the only negative aspect of the album.

It is located southwest of Chicago and built on of land. Designed by Herbert J. Tweedie and opened in 1898. The course was updated by the Ken Killian and Richard P. Nugent design team. In 2003, 82 bunkers on the course were renovated by architect Bob Lohmann of Lohmann Golf Designs and its construction division, Golf Creations. HistoryThe Golf Phase In the United States= The first golf club to open in the Chicago area was actually open for business a year before the World's Fair. On July 18, 1893, a charter was granted to the Chicago Golf Club, now located in Wheaton, Illinois. The Chicago Golf Club would remain under the leadership of Charles B. Macdonald until the Chicago Golf Club moved from its Belmont location to its current Wheaton location. Although golf courses have sprouted up in the United States on rare occasion since the nation's birth, it wasn't until the game of golf was put on display for the world to see at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago that the sport began gathering a strong following of athletes and fans alike. =Plans For A Private Golf Course close to Chicago= Site of the founding of the Midlothian Country Club Initial meetings which led to the formation of the Midlothian Country club were held in the living room of the residence of Harlow Niles Higinbotham at 2934 S. Michigan Avenue in Chicago. Higinbotham was the president of the World's Columbian Exposition and a director of The Northern Trust Bank and a director and partner of Marshall Field & Co. The house was demolished in 1920 and replaced by a service station.In 1898, a group of wealthy industrialists, bankers and merchants decided to construct the Midlothian Country Club in the southwest outskirts of the City of Chicago. The designer for the course was Herbert James Tweedie, who would go on to form the Belmont Golf Club in 1899 and take over the previous location of the Chicago Golf Club. The property purchased for such a course was farmland and fairly close to the Rexford Crossing whistle stop of the Rock Island Railroad. Although it was not typically a walkable venture to the country club, the club in the early years chose to shuttle its guests from the station via wagon and horse. The Midlothian Country Club became an 18-hole golf course and is quite unique in that every hole has a name. =Quickly Outgrowing Its Initial Plans= According to the introduction published in the 100 Year Anniversary book published by the Midlothian Country Club, it suggests the initial members did not want their location to become known, or in essence hiding the existence of the country club from individuals who patronize country clubs and other member's only groupings. Within a matter of a few years after the Midlothian - Blue Island Railroad was built, the Midlothian Country Club gained some measure of positive attention in golf circles around the world. =The Midlothian - Blue Island Railroad= When the club opened in 1898, its members were compelled to make the two mile journey from the Rock Island's Rexfords Corners railroad station over dirt roads that would become impassable during and after a rainstorm. To overcome this problem, in 1900 members of the club (who included John G. Shedd, Edward C. Potter, and E.P. Turner) chose to construct a railroad for a passenger train that would eventually travel up to fourteen times a day, providing transportation for its members and sometimes the caddies, except during the winter season. These tracks also had sidings which were sometimes used to \\"park\\" the private rail cars of members who would then stay the weekend for a golf event at the country club. Part of the arrangement between the Midlothian - Blue Island Railroad and the Rock Island included the construction of a new train station about a quarter of a mile north of the old Rexford Crossing station, which was named \\"Midlothian\\", and the Rexfords Corners station was demolished. After the village of Midlothian was incorporated in 1927, 147th Street was paved and the spur was no longer needed. Except for the first 670 feet near the Midlothian station which was retained by the Rock Island for use as a team track, the remainder of the line was removed in the fall of 1928, and today no trace of the line remains. The country club itself never owned any shares of the Midlothian - Blue Island Railroad; rather the stock holders were a group of individuals who were also members of the Midlothian Country Club. =Fox Hunting= A rider on horseback with several hounds at a fox hunt sponsored by the members of the Midlothian Country Club.In the earlier days of the 20th Century, members of the club and their guests used to gather for fox hunting activities. The hunts were not held on club property, but rather on 1,500 acres of surrounding farmland that the members arranged to use with the blessing of the neighboring farmers. With this event, the club was seen as \\"rapidly becoming the Onwentsia of the South Side\\". =The Village of Midlothian Annexes the Midlothian Country Club= This property would remain under the governance of Bremen Township and subsequently Cook County until the annexation process of Bremen Heights into the Village of Midlothian was initiated in the mid to late 1950s and completed in the early 1960s.

C. Potter composed a book in which select ownership of the book was determined to be that of a narrow list of individuals and no one else as it included the statement \\"For Private Circulation Only 1900\\" on one of the first few pages. It does not use the term \\"confidential\\" which kept elasticity in relation to copyright laws. The phrase simply prohibited duplication by any other publisher and warned that the book should not be loaned out in a library setting, as example. Entitled Midlothian melodies: Mnemonic Maunderings of the Merry Muse, it was composed with intent on passages having being read at various events and then compiled into a book form. One \\"musing\\" was for the farewell party on September 30, 1899 for the soon to be former President George R. Thorne, one of the key players in the entire development process while others are passages contemplating the intricacies of the game of golf. Major tournaments Judge magazine. In January of that year the club had won the rights to sponsor the Western Amateur Golf Championship tournament, an honor which it had wrested away from the Omaha Country Club and the Del Monte Club of southern California.

Originally there were twenty members. The golf course, which opened in 1911, was designed by Herbert Barker. The first location of the Club was on the east side of Brightwood Avenue, afterwards known as Georgia Avenue, in the neighborhood of Schuetzen Park. Through its history, the club has counted among its members two Five Star Generals, Omar Bradley and Hap Arnold, along with countless politicians, most notably Barack Obama, journalists, CEOs and lobbyists. History The present site on Connecticut Avenue was purchased in 1909 from the Chevy Chase Land Company. The certificate of incorporation is dated August 25, 1909. The design of Frederick B. Pyle for the club house was selected from among four submitted. The golf course, completed in 1911, was designed by Herbert Barker, a noted golfer and course architect of the day. Walter Travis made extensive renovations to the course in 1915. Although there is no newspaper record of the event, the opening of the new Club occurred on January 6, 1911. Early Club minutes were lost. The course was one of the favorite courses of President Woodrow Wilson. The U.S. Open was held at the Club in 1921, won by Englishman, Jim Barnes. President Warren Harding presented the Champion's Trophy. With the exception of the eighth hole, there have been changes (for the better) on all holes of the course. Several acres were added to the original in the 1930s. Other improvements, such as new tee boxes and a better irrigation system, were added in the early part of 2012. The first swimming pool (donated by Donald Woodward) opened in 1925. The Olympic-sized pool was built much later and the entire area was totally renovated in 1978. A profusion of tennis courts have existed from the beginning of the Club. Platform tennis courts were added in the 1960s. Major changes have been made on the 15th, 16th and 17th holes of the golf course, made possible by the construction of a water line through the area by the WSSC under its power of eminent domain. In addition, 2009 saw the completion of a major renovation and addition of the club house, adding an indoor swimming facility, upgraded fitness center, new bowling alley (duckpin), locker rooms, ice skating rink (winter only) and additional parking among other things. Throughout its rich history, only three head golf professionals ever worked at the club, Fred McLeod, William Strausbaugh, and Robert Dolan (its current head PGA Professional). Columbia has a history of counting some of the best amateur golfers in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area among its membership. Martin R. West III, a multiple club champion at Columbia, made the cut in 1973 the Masters Tournament and 1976 U.S. Open; he has competed in 19 United States Amateurs, is a former US Walker Cup team member, and has won numerous area tournaments including nine Maryland Amateurs. The annual club championship, contested in early September, is one of the most prestigious in the DC area. Columbia's MSGA A team has been very successful, winning the competition multiple times (most recently 2017). The course The Columbia course favors shotmaking and finesse over the ability to drive the ball long distances. The natural topography of the area means that Columbia's course is very hilly, with tight fairways and small, undulating greens that are almost universally sloped back to front. Course superintendents generally keep the Columbia greens at a very high speed, and rarely do they roll anything less than an 11 on the Stimp meter. A common saying among members and caddies is that \\"there are only two flat lies at Columbia, on the tee and in your pocket\\". Because of the layout, driving the ball long distances can often get a player into trouble due to deep rough, side-hill lies, pot bunkers, and the aforementioned tight fairways. Almost every approach shot on the golf course plays significantly either uphill or downhill, including severe downhill plays on #2, #5, #12, #14, #15, and #16. Hole #17 at Columbia is a truly unique hole, with only a 200-yard tee shot required to a short but wide section of fairway. From there, the player must chip straight uphill only 70 yards to a green sloped from front to back. The signature hole, however, remains the par 3 16th, which, legend has it, served as Bobby Jones's inspiration for the 12th hole at Augusta National Golf Club. From one of three tee boxes, the hole plays to a very long, narrow green with three distinct levels that is guarded completely along the front by a large pond. Complicating matters are two pot bunkers, one in front of the green and one behind. The hole has been consistently rated among the best in the area, and was ranked by Washingtonian magazine locally. Overall, the par 70 (35-35) course measures in length, with a course rating of 72.3 and slope rating of 139.

Original site The country club was named for the Fresh Meadows neighborhood of Northeast Queens just south of Horace Harding Boulevard now the Long Island Expressway, near 183rd Street. The PGA Championship was held at Fresh Meadow Country Club in 1930, won by Tommy Armour, and the 1932 U.S. Open, won by its former club pro . (Sarazen was the runner-up in 1930, falling in the 36-hole championship match to Armour.) In 1937, the golf course hosted a charity game between John Montague, Babe Ruth, Babe Didrikson, and Sylvania Annenberg, a game that was watched by 10,000 fans, some of whom rushed the golf course and left Babe Ruth's shirt in tatters. In 1941, Ruth played Ty Cobb in a celebrity golf match at the course to benefit the USO, the second of three matches in three cities (Boston, New York, Detroit). Lake Success Under increasing development and tax pressure, the club sold its Queens property in 1946, which was developed as a residential neighborhood (the Fresh Meadows section of Queens) by New York Life Insurance Company. The club then purchased the property, clubhouse, and golf course of the defunct Lakeville Golf & Country Club in Nassau County, which is the club's present course. Approximately five miles (8 km) northeast of the original site, its course was designed by English course architect Charles Hugh Alison, partner of architect Harry Colt.

It converted to an academy in September 2010. It educates 825 students aged 11 to 16. History Mrs H. Anthony took over the role of Headmistress from E. Cole in 2006. The incorporation of the Ninestiles Foundation, and Sir D. Hutt improved the school's reputation. The Multi Use Games Area (M.U.G.A) sports facility was opened in 2007. The Central Technology College was closed in 2010 to make way for a new academy. The former Central Technology College building (located in Cotteswold Road) was used temporary as the academy site, until the new building was completed. In September 2013, the new building was completed and all academy operations were transferred on to the new site (now located on Painswick Road). The building cost around ¬£15 million to construct, but was almost cancelled on several occasions, as local residents were unhappy with possible light pollution and noise the new site would bring. However, after many negotiations, all parties were happy by December 2012 and construction began. As an academy, the school was previously part of the Prospects Academies Trust. The trust oversaw the introduction of a new headteacher 'Mr S Badat', who had worked in many challenging schools previously, for example The Essa Academy in Bolton. However, in May 2014 it was announced that the trust was to cease operations, and Gloucester Academy formally joined the White Horse Federation in March 2015. On June 1st 2020, the academy was officially overtaken by Greenshaw Learning Trust. It was Late January when the switch was prompted. Headteacher, Mr Paul Holroyd, was replaced by Mr Johnathan Heap. High turnover of Headteachers Gloucester Academy has had 13 Headteachers/Principals since opening in 2010. Some of these were substantive Principals whilst others were temporary post holders. This has led to a huge issue with stability at the academy, which has led to a lack of improvement and development as the academy has been in Special Measures or Inadequate for 7 out of the 9 years that it has been in operation. Out of the 19 Principals, only three have been permanent positions: Mr John Reilly: Stepped down as headteacher in September 2013, after overseeing the new building finished and all operations transferred to the new site following a poor ofsted report and weak exam results. Mr Shawk Badat: a so-called ‚Äòsuperhead‚Äô brought to the Academy by Prospects Trust to help raise achievement and improve the 'school community'. Mr Badat also shortened the academy day on Friday, and introduced 'Enrichment Activities' for pupils to take part in. His over all plan was to provide every pupil with their own iPad to use in the class room to aid with their learning. However he resigned on 22 May 2015 due to family commitments. He was later replaced by Mr Ian Frost. Mr Ian Frost: Took over the top job in September 2015, and initially had some success with the school being removed from Special Measures and being rated as Requires Improvement with a Good judgement for Leadership & Management by Ofsted. Despite this, improvements were not sustained and exam outcomes were poor, Mr Frost subsequently resigned with immediate effect in April 2018 following the school being placed in Special Measures for the third time since opening in 2010. He has been replaced for the moment by the current Vice Principal Mr Andy Vinton who is Acting Principal, supported by White Horse Federation's Director of School Improvement Mrs Helen Glass, who was previously Headteacher at Gloucester Academy's predecessor school Central Technology College. In September 2018 it was announced that Mrs Glass had resigned from her role along with three members of the governing body creating yet more instability for the struggling school.

The farm property, first developed in the 1860s, was the residence of future U.S. president Harry S. Truman from 1906 to 1917. The house is part of Harry S. Truman National Historic Site, and is a designated National Historic Landmark. Description and history The Truman Farm Home is located in a commercially developed area of Grandview, between Blue Ridge Boulevard and Interstate 49. The site consists of a farm house (built in 1894-95 after the 1867 house was destroyed by fire); a reconstructed smokehouse; the Grandview post office- turned-garage (Truman moved it to the farm to store his 1911 Stafford automobile); a restored box wagon once used on the farm; and several stone fence posts marking the original boundaries of the farm, plus other original and reconstructed buildings. The farmhouse was built in 1894 by Harry Truman's maternal grandmother, Harriet Louisa Gregg, and is the centerpiece of a remnant of the family's former farm. Truman worked the farm from 1906-1917, when he was 22 years old until he was 33. It was here, said Truman's mother Martha, that Harry got his \\"common sense\\". After his grandmother died, ownership of the property was contested by her heirs, the costs of which eventually forced Martha out of the house in 1940. The President was eventually able to recover much of the property, and considered it a desirable place to establish his presidential library. This did not happen, and Truman sold off most of the land for development in the 1950s. A surviving part of the Truman farm is now owned by the National Park Service, forming part of the Harry S. Truman National Historic Site. There is no visitor center on the site, but the grounds are open for self-guided tours and an audio tour is available. Guided tours were formerly conducted during the summer, but were cancelled in 2013 due to sequestration-related budget cuts.Sequestration Cuts at Park, National Park Service See also *List of National Historic Landmarks in Missouri *National Register of Historic Places listings in Jackson County, Missouri ReferencesExternal links * *Harry S.

It is often sung to the tune St. George's, Windsor by George Job Elvey.  History  Alford wrote \\"Come, Ye Thankful People, Come\\" in 1844 while he was the rector of Aston Sandford church in Buckinghamshire, England. It was first published in Hymns and Psalms in 1844 with seven verses under the title \\"After Harvest\\". \\"Come, Ye Thankful People, Come\\" was set to George J. Elvey's hymn tune St. George's, Windsor in 1858. In 1865, Alford revised the hymn, and it was republished in his Poetical Works with only four verses. In 1861 there had been a number of unofficial revisions of the hymn, including in \\"one in Hymns Ancient and Modern, which led to Alford publishing a footnote in Poetical Works stating his disapproval of these revisions that had been made without his agreement. Despite this, Alford revised the hymn again in 1867 in Year of Praise. Alford was a moderate who attempted to keep good relations between non-conformists and the High Church Anglicans in the Church of England: \\"Come, Ye Thankful People, Come\\" is commonly found in evangelical hymn books as are Alford's \\"Forward be our watchword\\" and \\"Ten thousand times ten thousand\\" . The hymn later gained popularity in the United States where it is used as part of Thanksgiving celebrations. The first verse is written as a celebration of the harvest, calling for people to give thanks to God for it. The last two verses are based on the Parable of the Tares, and discuss the last harvest at the Second Coming of Jesus. Recordings and popular culture The group CantusA Harvest Home recorded this in 2014. Steeleye Span recorded the first verse of the hymn as part of the song Marigold/Harvest Home on the Sails of Silver album. \\"Come, Ye Thankful People, Come\\" was used in the \\"All is Safely Gathered In\\" episode of British sitcom Dad's Army where it is performed by a drunk Walmington-on-Sea platoon at a harvest service. Some scholars assert that this hymn is the one sung by the Cabby in C. S. Lewis's children's book The Magician's Nephew before the creation of Narnia: > He struck up at once a harvest thanksgiving hymn, all about crops being > \\"safely gathered in.\\" It was not very suitable to a place which felt as if > nothing had grown there since the beginning of time, but it was the one he > could remember best. Lyrics 1\\\\. Come, ye thankful people, come, Raise the song of harvest home! All is safely gathered in, Ere the winter storms begin; God, our Maker, doth provide For our wants to be supplied; Come to God's own temple, come; Raise the song of harvest home! 2\\\\. We ourselves are God's own field, Fruit unto his praise to yield; Wheat and tares together sown Unto joy or sorrow grown; First the blade and then the ear, Then the full corn shall appear; Grant, O harvest Lord, that we Wholesome grain and pure may be. 3\\\\. For the Lord our God shall come, And shall take the harvest home; From His field shall in that day All offences purge away, Giving angels charge at last In the fire the tares to cast; But the fruitful ears to store In the garner evermore. 4\\\\. Then, thou Church triumphant come, Raise the song of harvest home! All be safely gathered in, Free from sorrow, free from sin, There, forever purified, In God's garner to abide; Come, ten thousand angels, come, Raise the glorious harvest home! Lyrics in Public Domain =Hymns Ancient & Modern= 2\\\\. All this world is God's own field, Fruit unto his praise to yield; Wheat and tares therein are sown Unto joy or sorrow grown; Ripening with a wondrous power Till the final harvest-hour: Grant, O Lord of life, that we Holy grain and pure may be. 3\\\\. For we know that thou wilt come, And wilt take thy people home; From thy field wilt purge away All that doth offend, that day; And thine angels charge at last In the fire the tares to cast, But the fruitful ears to store In thy garner evermore. 4\\\\. Come then, Lord of mercy, come, Bid us sing thy harvest-home: Let thy saints be gathered in Free from sorrow, free from sin; All upon the golden floor Praising thee for evermore: Come, with all thine angels come, Bid us sing thy harvest home.

The third-party‚Äîwhich can be an agent such as a football agent, an agency, such as a sports-management agency, a company, investors such as a hedge-fund, or a single investor‚Äî\\"takes ownership of all or part of the financial rights to a player\\". In some cases when a footballer is sold, the TPO, not the football club, can benefit from transfer fees and contract negotiations fees. Note that this differs from co- ownership in football, where a player's transfer rights are shared between two clubs. The practice has also been widely used in football in South America, particularly in countries such as Brazil and Argentina, with a system of players, clubs, agents, teams, and investors involved. It is associated with football clubs with few financial options that face financial hardship, and are sometimes insolvent. By 2007, TPOs had become common practice in football in Portugal, Spain and Russia. According to a 2007 article in The Guardian and academic articles, businessmen or other investors buy shares in the economic rights of young players and often cover the costs of their training and accommodation. In return they are entitled to a percentage of a player's future transfer fee. A 2016 article in the Mirror, explained how third-party owners may either purchase a percentage of a player's \\"economic rights\\" from the club, or even purchase a player's contract. Owning the contract allows the third-party owner to increase profits by \\"parking a player\\" at a club temporarily until the player's value appreciates, at which time he is sold to another club and the agent earns a percentage of the transfer fees. In April 2015, FIFA announced the banning of third-party ownership, and specifically prohibited either clubs or players from entering into economic rights agreements with third-party investors. The ban took effect on 1 May 2015. The European Parliament also announced a similar ban in European sports on 11 November 2015 following the passing of Rule 136 of Parliament's Rules of Procedure. In a written declaration, the European Parliament states that third-party ownership raises concerns over the integrity of competitions and introduces risks of criminal activities into sports. According to a 2015 Bloomberg News article, the Football Leaks uncovered secretive \\"financing practice for the global sport\\" with \\"one of the biggest firms investing millions in soccer-player futures\\". One method of circumventing the 2015 FIFA ban is to utilise a floating charge over designated accounts where the proceeds of player transfers is paid into. This was notably used by FC Porto. Regulations At its annual general meeting in June 2008, the English Premier League drafted new rules L34 and L35 to restrict third party ownership of players from the beginning of the 2008‚Äì9 season. However, the FIFA 'third- party' rules differ drastically from the Premier League, which creates substantial gaps in the enforcement of TPO. Premier League rules authorise financial institutions to hold player economic rights - which Maciel & Walton suggests, appears to be a contravention of the all-encompassing FIFA ban. In 2007 as reported in The Guardian, The league's rule U18 had previously stated that the third parties were not permitted to \\"materially influence\\" a club's \\"policies or the performances of its teams\\". In October 2007 it was reported that Football's international governing body, FIFA, was acting to ban 'third- party' ownership. Article 18 of FIFA's Rules on the Status and Transfer of Players does restrict the practice, at least as far as a third party's influence is concerned, stating that: \\"No club shall enter into a contract which enables any other party to that contract or any third party to acquire the ability to influence in employment and transfer related matters its independence, its policies or the performance of its teams\\". In September 2014 UEFA announced they were going to tackle the issue. Later that month FIFA announced they would ban the practice. In July 2015 a Belgian court rejected an appeal against the banning of third-party ownership. By 2016, TPO was strictly forbidden in England. Criticism Third-party ownership became controversial in English football after the arrival at West Ham United of Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano from the Brazilian club Corinthians in August 2006. One unidentified official called it, \\"an unedifying trade in young people that rips the heart out of clubs which try to develop players\\". Gordon Taylor, chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association, said of third-party ownership: \\"It is like trading in human beings. And it's destabilising for outsiders to have a financial interest in players.\\" In April 2015 UEFA and FIFPro spoke out against the practise, stating it should be outlawed. By 2016, FIFA was attempting to tighten rules regarding TPO, which \\"has been described in some quarters as modern-day slavery.\\" Defence Defenders of the practice said that it constitutes a way of sharing the burden of investment in a player. The 'super agent' Pini Zahavi, himself associated with third-party ownership and the companies that invested in players, said: \\"In England they don't understand it at all. It's easier to buy a player who you are unsure about for ¬£10m if you are sharing the risk with a partner. Now, if the player becomes top-drawer and is sold for ¬£30m, then of course you may feel stupid only to own half. But if the player turns out to be merely average or a failure, if he cannot even be sold, you will say, 'Fantastic, the disaster was not only mine'. That's exactly the way it works.\\" The businessman Kia Joorabchian, heavily involved in the third-party ownership of players, defended the arrangement, calling it \\"the South American model and a model that appears all over Europe\\". After the Premiership introduced rules against third-party ownership, lawyer Jean-Louis Dupont claimed that it was illegal. ExamplesCorinthians= In 2004 the Media Sports Investments fund, founded and headed by Kia Joorabchian, purchased a controlling 51% of Corinthians in a 10-year deal. In the wake of MSI's involvement a stream of new players arrived at the club, players who were engaged to play for Corinthians but whose economic rights were partly or wholly owned by the investment fund. By 2006 MSI was listing as its investments not just Corinthians itself but also the players Carlos Tevez, Marcelo Mattos, Gustavo Nery, Roger, Javier Mascherano, Carlos Alberto, Sebasti√°n Dom√≠nguez, Marinho,\\"Media Sports Investments website 30 Nov 2006\\" Retrieved 2010-08-03.

It subsequently emerged that Tevez's economic rights were owned by Media Sports Investments and a second company, Just Sports Inc., while Mascherano was jointly owned by Global Soccer Agencies and Mystere Services Ltd.Bilal, Ahmed. \\"Original Tevez and Mascherano contracts with West Ham\\", Soccerlens.com, 8 June 2007. Retrieved 2010-07-28. All four companies were represented by Kia Joorabchian and the deal was brokered by MSI, whose president Joorabchian had been until June 2006. Due to irregularities in the player's contracts, West Ham United were eventually fined a record ¬£5.5 million by the Premier League. Despite the fine, Tevez was allowed to continue playing for West Ham United. Both players remained in England after the controversy; Tevez moved to Manchester United while Mascherano went to play for Liverpool. Manchester United failed to agree a price with Tevez's owner and he left for city rival Manchester City in summer 2009. Joorabchian subsequently claimed that many Premier League players and teams conceal their third-party ownership of players.Wilson, Bill. \\"Action urged on footballer investment\\" BBC 12 October 2007.

He was born in 1920 in Lahore. He was a brother of filmmaker Mohammad Walli (known as Walli Sahib). New talent introductions Nazim Panipati wrote more than two hundred songs for Hindi, Urdu and Punjabi language films. Indian singer Lata Mangeshkar recorded the first song of her career 'Dil Mera Tora, Mujhe Kahin Ka Na Chora Tere Pyar Ne', music by Ghulam Haider for the film Majboor (1948 film), was also written by Nazim Panipati. This song became popular throughout India. At that time, Master Ghulam Haider had told Nazim Panipati that this unknown girl (Lata Mangeshkar) was destined to become a great singer of India after Noor Jehan. In 1939, Nazim Panipati and his film producer/director brother Walli Sahib first persuaded Pran to become a film actor in Lahore, due to his good looks, after Walli Sahib spotted him at Lakshmi Chowk, Lahore at a Paan Shop. Pran was reluctant and disbelieving, at first, at the offer. Pran (birth name was Pran Krishan Sikand, born in Delhi in a Hindu Punjabi family) could not speak proper Punjabi language at that time because he was raised in Delhi where his father worked. Walli Sahib was offering him to act in a Punjabi film Yamla Jat (1940). So Pran's Punjabi- language skills were polished up by Walli Sahib's songwriter brother Nazim Panipati. Pran went on to become a big film star. Nazim Panipati also introduced Vyjayanthimala (she was from South India, Nazim Panipati taught her Urdu language for films), Johnny Walker and Helen to the Indian Film Industry. Career in Pakistan In 1953, Nazim Panipati migrated to Pakistan. Film Guddi Gudda (1956) was his first Pakistani film which was produced and directed by his brother Walli Sahib. Famous Pakistani film playback singer Saleem Raza and Nazim Panipati also had both worked together at an advertising agency in Lahore for some time. In the mid 1960s, he joined Pakistan Television Corporation and wrote songs for a musical programme named Jhankar. Death Nazim Panipati died on 18 June 1998 in Lahore, Pakistan. He was buried in the Model Town, Lahore graveyard. Notable films Nazim Panipati's major films as a songwriter are: * Yamla Jat (1940) - actor Pran's debut film * Dulla Bhatti (1940) * Khazanchi (1941) * Khandan (1942) * Mangti (1942)- A Punjabi language film * Zamindar (1942) * Naukar (1943 film) * Poonji (1943) * Shirin Farhad (1945) * Doli (1947) * Majboor (1948) * Roomal (1949) * Sheesh Mahal (1950)Profile and filmography of Nazim Panipati on muvyz.com website Retrieved 16 April 2019 * Zamane Ki Hawa (1952) * Danka (1954) * Lakht-E-Jigar (1956)- A Pakistani filmFilmography of Nazim Panipati on IMDb website Retrieved 16 April 2019Nazim Panipati as a scriptwriter and songwriter in film Lakht-e-Jigar (1956) on pakmag.net website Retrieved 16 April 2019 * Guddi Gudda (1956)- A Pakistani film in the Punjabi language * Aaina (1966 film) * Insaniyat (1967 film) Notable songs Popular songs of Nazim Panipati as a lyricist: * Aai Hai Diiwaalii Sakhi Aai Sakhi Aai Re- film Sheesh Mahal (1950) music : Vasant Desai * Dil Mera Tora, Mujhe Kahin Ka Na Chora Tere Pyar Ne- film Majboor (1948) music by Ghulam Haider * Dilli Ki Galiyon Mein- film Doli (1947) music by Ghulam Mohammad * Ham Hain Dukhiya Is Duniya mein...

The district consists of six elementary schools, two middle schools, and a high school. Each elementary and middle school is named after an important figure in Lexington's history. District schools There are nine schools in the Lexington Public School district: * Bowman Elementary School * Bridge Elementary School * Joseph Estabrook Elementary School * Fiske Elementary School * Harrington Elementary School * Maria Hastings Elementary School * Jonas Clarke Middle School * William Diamond Middle School * Lexington High School Elementary schools Lexington's six elementary schools - Bowman, Bridge, Joseph Estabrook, Fiske, Harrington, and Maria Hastings - serve students in kindergarten through 5th grade. =Bowman Elementary School= Bowman Elementary is named for the descendants of Nathaniel Bowman, the progenitor of an important family in Lexington's history. The current principal at Bowman is Jen Courduck. The mascot of the school is the Bowman Bear. =Bridge Elementary School= Bridge Elementary is named for the descendants of Matthew Bridge, to whom the once-farmland around the school site formerly belonged. A mural on the front side of the school building represents \\"working together\\". The current principal at Bridge is Meg Colella. Bridge was a High Performing National Blue Ribbon School in 2010. =Joseph Estabrook Elementary School= Estabrook Elementary is named after Joseph Estabrook (1669‚Äì1733), the first school teacher in Lexington. It is notable for being the oldest Lexington Elementary school. The current principal at Estabrook is Lisa Riendeau. The school garnered nationwide attention from the David Parker controversy, when parents sued the Lexington school system, arguing that their children were being coerced by public school teachers \\"to affirm the correctness and the normalcy of homosexuality\\" and same-sex marriage. The bulk of the legality of the controversy revolved around whether parents have a right to receive parental notification and opt their elementary school children out of such content. Federal courts ruled against the Parkers. =Fiske Elementary School= Fiske Elementary is named for the Fiske family, which circa 1678 was the first family to settle on East Street. The current principal at Fiske is Thomas Martellone. The current facility was constructed between 2005 and 2007. =Harrington Elementary School= Harrington Elementary is named for the Harrington family, which produced many notable town citizens, such as Jonathan Harrington who was killed in the Battle of Lexington, and another of the same name who was the battle's last survivor. The current principal at Harrington is Jackie Daley. =Maria Hastings Elementary School= Maria Hastings Elementary is named after Maria Hastings Cary, a local philanthropist and the founder of the town's main public library, Cary Library. The current principal at Hastings is Louise Lipsitz. Middle schools Lexington's two public middle schools - William Diamond MS and Jonas Clarke MS, commonly referred to as \\"Diamond\\" and \\"Clarke,\\" respectively - serve students between 6th and 8th grade. Students at Diamond are generally fed in through Estabrook, Fiske, and Hastings, and students at Clarke are generally fed in through Bowman, Bridge, and Harrington. Like many middle schools, both Diamond and Clarke operate in an academic team system, in which each grade is broken down into smaller groups of common teachers and students. Each of the grades in both schools are divided into three teams, with one exception. Diamond and Clarke have built a cross-town rivalry bridging academics and athletics. =Academics= Both Diamond and Clarke have been among the top schools in MCAS testing. Academically, both schools offer a comparable curriculum comprising several core subjects in addition to a wide range of electives. Students are required to take courses in math, science, English, and social studies, each of which follows its own track. In math, students are required to take courses ranging up to algebra, with placement and level being determined individually. In science, students are required to take courses in earth science, life science, and chemistry and physics. In social studies, students are required to take courses focusing on ancient civilizations, world geography, and U.S. history in 6th, 7th and 8th grades respectively. In foreign languages, students have the option to take a sequence of courses in French, Spanish, or Mandarin Chinese. The Mandarin Language program is ranked one of the best Mandarin Language programs in the country, and the school and Mandarin teachers have received many awards, such as the Confucius Institute Award and various cash and technological prizes from the Chinese Government. Top students in Spanish have the opportunity to visit Costa Rica, or in past and recent years, Spain, as part of a language and culture immersion trip abroad. Similarly, top students in French have the opportunity to visit Quebec City, and top students in Mandarin have the opportunity to visit Beijing, Jinhua, and Shanghai, China. Students in both schools have the additional opportunity to participate in their respective school's orchestra, band, or chorus. =Sports= Both schools field varsity teams in many sports, including cross-country running, soccer, basketball, track, field hockey, baseball, and softball. =Extracurricular activities= Led by coaches Sarah Doonan at Diamond and Joshua Frost and Jeffrey Woodcock at Clarke, Lexington's middle school math teams are renowned for their successes and mutual rivalry in competitions such as MathCounts, the NEML, the American Mathematics Competitions (AMC), and in the Intermediate Math League of Eastern Massachusetts (IMLEM). Clarke's current run of seven consecutive IMLEM championships was immediately preceded by nine consecutive championships by Diamond. Two Lexington natives have won the Mathcounts national championship: Jonathan L. Weinstein in 1991 and Alec Sun in 2013. Both schools have a plethora of other clubs and teams. =William Diamond Middle School= The school is named after William Diamond, the 16-year-old drummer for the Lexington Minutemen during the Battle of Lexington and Concord. The current principal at Diamond is Jennifer Turner, and the assistant principals are Bayard Klimasmith and Elizabeth Sharp. Prior to the 2010-11 school year, the teams in each grade were named Omega, Delta, and Sigma. To differentiate between grades, one would have denoted teams as Œ©6 or Œî8 and Œ£7. At the beginning of the 2010-11 school year, the 6th grade team teams were renamed Athena, Apollo, and Pegasus; the 7th grade teams Denali, Everest, and K2; and the 8th grade teams, Liberty, Freedom, and Independence. In 2016, another half-team, Artemis, was added to the sixth grade, to compensate for the overlarge class of 2023. In 2017, Artemis was removed and two new half teams, Fuji (7th grade) and Justice (8th grade) were added. In 2018, Artemis appeared again to compensate for the larger amounts of students coming into the school, after the recent renovation. Along with many other extra-curricular activities, Diamond has a school newspaper, called the \\"Diamond Dispatch\\", which is run by the students and a 6th grade English teacher. In addition, a fall play and musical are staged every year in the fall and winter respectively. Both productions are collaborated upon by the drama and technical departments, with the addition of the chorus department for the musical. Students have the option of auditioning for the cast or applying for the stage crew. Although Diamond does not have a formal student- run government, the Student Council determines spirit days, fundraisers, and other matters. It also has a Video dispatch, the is internally called WDMS TV (William Diamond Middle School Television) that produces videos for the school. Many of the 7th and 8th grade French and Spanish classes compete in the National French Exam and National Spanish Exam, respectively. =Jonas Clarke Middle School= The school is named after the local pastor Jonas Clarke, who was present at the standoff at Lexington Green shortly before the shots that started the Revolutionary War. The current principal at Clarke is Dane Despres, and the assistant principals are Mary Barry-Ng and Jonathan Whetstone. The school mascot is Jonas Bark the Bulldog. Jonas Clarke Middle School has been rated one of the top schools in the United States, and received the High-Performing National Blue Ribbon Award in 2013. The teams at Clarke were (mostly, kind of) named after spacecraft. That has since changed in the 2020-2021 school year. The 6th grade teams are named Zoomies, Mercury, Odyssey, and Wolfpack; the 7th grade teams are named Adventurer, Alliance, Lionheart, and Phoenix; and the 8th grade teams are named Apollo, Perseverance, Inspiration, and Curiosity. The S.G.A. (student government association) is the student-run government of Clarke. Clarke also has a school newspaper, called the \\"Clarke Barker\\", which is also run by the students and a 6th grade English teacher. Clarke's other extra-curricular vary in type, however most activities are either academic, artistic or athletic. New activities are created each year by the request of the students, if there is a faculty or parent coordinator. Lexington High School Most students that go through the Lexington Public Schools system end up at Lexington High School. Alternatively, students are given the opportunity to attend the regional vocational school, Minuteman Regional High School, and a few each year decide to take the opportunity. Additionally, some students that go through the Lexington Public Schools system prefer to attend regional private schools. The current principal at Lexington High School is Andrew Stephens, and the assistant principal is Andrew Baker. There are four deans: Scott Kmack, Nicole Canniff, Jaffrie Perrotti, and Kate Herman.

It hosted the U.S. Open in 1952, won by Julius Boros, which ended Ben Hogan's streak of titles at three in three attempts; the Fort Worth native led after two rounds but finished in third place. Northwood has since been the host of several Regional USGA, local North Texas PGA, and AJGA tournaments. The course was originally designed by W. H. Diddel, with many large trees lining the fairways and traditional small greens. The course was redesigned in 1990 by Jay Morrish and Tom Weiskopf. The golf course plays to a par of 70 from the championship tees. The Northwood Club golf course consistently ranks in the Top 20 Golf Courses in Texas by The Dallas Morning News. The Northwood golf course has 007 bentgrass putting greens, along with Northbridge bermuda grass tees and fairways. The roughs are a mix of bermuda, zoysia and fescue grasses. Many mature trees are on the property, including live oak, red oak, pecan, American elm, cedar elm, hackberry and cottonwood. In addition to the 18 hole golf course, current athletic facilities include 16 tennis courts with four indoor courts. A notable Northwood tennis program alumni is tennis professional Bill Scanlon, who began playing tennis at Northwood at nine years of age.

Offshore drilling rigs have similar elements, but are configured with a number of different drilling systems to suit drilling in the marine environment. The equipment associated with a rig is to some extent dependent on the type of rig but typically includes at least some of the items listed below. List of items Simple diagram of a drilling rig and its basic operation #Mud tank #Shale shakers #Suction line (mud pump) #Mud pump #Motor or power source #hose #Draw-works #Standpipe #Kelly hose #Goose-neck #Traveling block #Drill line #Crown block #Derrick #Racking Board (Sometimes referred to as the Monkey Board) #Stand (of drill pipe) #Setback (floor) #Swivel (On newer rigs this may be replaced by a top drive) #Kelly drive #Rotary table #Drill floor #Bell nipple #Blowout preventer (BOP) Annular type #Blowout preventer (BOP) Pipe ram & blind ram #Drill string #Drill bit #Casing head or Wellhead #Flow line Explanation *Bell nipple (#22) is a section of large diameter pipe fitted to the top of the blowout preventers that the flow line attaches to via a side outlet, to allow the drilling mud to flow back to the mud tanks. *Blowout preventers (BOPs) (#23 and #24) are devices installed at the wellhead to prevent fluids and gases from unintentionally escaping from the wellbore. #23 is the annular (often referred to as Hydril named after a manufacturer), and #24 is the pipe rams and blind rams. *Casing head (#27) is a large metal flange welded or screwed onto the top of the conductor pipe (also known as drive-pipe) or the casing and is used to bolt the surface equipment such as the blowout preventers (for well drilling) or the Christmas tree (oil well) (for well production). *Centrifuge (not pictured) is an industrial version of the device that separates fine silt and sand from the drilling fluid. It is typically mounted on top or just off of the mud tanks. *Crown block (#13) is the stationary end of the block and tackle. *Degasser (not pictured) is a device that separates air and/or gas from the drilling fluid. It is typically mounted on top of the mud tanks. *Derrick (#14) is the support structure for the equipment used to lower and raise the drill string into and out of the wellbore. This consists of the sub-structure (structure below the drill floor level) and the mast. *Desander / desilter (not pictured) contains a set of hydrocyclones that separate sand and silt from the drilling fluid. Typically mounted on top of the mud tanks. *Draw-works (#7) is the mechanical section that contains the spool, whose main function is to reel in/out the drill line to raise/lower the traveling block. *Drill bit (#26) is a device attached to the end of the drill string that breaks apart the rock being drilled. It contains jets through which the drilling fluid exits. *Drill floor (#21) is the area on the rig where the tools are located to make the connections of the drill pipe, bottom hole assembly, tools and bit. It is considered the main area where work is performed. *Drill line (#12) is thick, stranded metal cable threaded through the two blocks (traveling and crown) to raise and lower the drill string. *Drill pipe (#16) is a joint of hollow tubing used to connect the surface equipment to the bottom hole assembly (BHA) and acts as a conduit for the drilling fluid. In the diagram, these are stands of drill pipe which are 2 or 3 joints of drill pipe connected and stood in the derrick vertically, usually to save time while tripping pipe. *Drill string (#25) is an assembled collection of drill pipe, heavy weight drill pipe, drill collars and any of a whole assortment of tools, connected and run into the wellbore to facilitate the drilling of a well. The collection is referred to singularly as the drill string. *Elevators (not pictured) are hinged devices that is used to latch to the drill pipe or casing to facilitate the lowering or lifting (of pipe or casing) into or out of the wellbore. *Flow line (#28) is large diameter pipe that is attached to the bell nipple and extends to the shale shakers to facilitate the flow of drilling fluid back to the mud tanks. *Goose-neck (#10) is a thick metal elbow connected to the swivel and standpipe that supports the weight of and provides a downward angle for the kelly hose to hang from. *Kelly drive (#19) is a square, hexagonal or octagonal shaped tubing that is inserted through and is an integral part of the rotary table that moves freely vertically while the rotary table turns it. *Kelly hose (#9) is a flexible, high pressure hose that connects the standpipe to the kelly (or more specifically to the gooseneck on the swivel above the kelly) and allows free vertical movement of the kelly, while facilitating the flow of the drilling fluid through the system and down the drill string. *Racking board (#15) is the catwalk along the side of the derrick (usually about 35 or 40 feet above the \\"floor\\"). The monkey board is where the derrick man works while \\"tripping\\" pipe. *Mud motor (not pictured) is a hydraulically powered device positioned just above the drill bit used to spin the bit independently from the rest of the drill string. *Mud pump (#4) is a reciprocal type of pump used to circulate drilling fluid through the system. *Mud tank (#1) is often called mud pits and stores drilling fluid until it is required down the wellbore. *Setback (#17) is a part of the drill floor (#21) where the stands of drill pipe are stood upright. It is typically made of a metal frame structure with large wooden beams situated within it. The wood helps to protect the end of the drill pipe. *Rotary table (#20) rotates, along with its constituent parts, the kelly and kelly bushing, the drill string and the attached tools and bit. *Shale shaker (#2) separates drill cuttings from the drilling fluid before it is pumped back down the wellbore. *Stand (#16) is a section of 2 or 3 joints of drill pipe connected and stood upright in the derrick. When they are pulled out of the hole, instead of laying down each joint of drill pipe, 2 or 3 joints are left connected and stood in the derrick to save time. *Standpipe (#8) is a thick metal tubing, situated vertically along the derrick, that facilitates the flow of drilling fluid and has attached to it and supports one end of the kelly hose. *Suction line (#3) is an intake line for the mud pump to draw drilling fluid from the mud tanks. *Swivel (#18) is the top end of the kelly that allows the rotation of the drill string without twisting the block. *Traveling block (#11) is the moving end of the block and tackle. Together, they give a significant mechanical advantage for lifting. *Vibrating hose (#6) is a flexible, high pressure hose (similar to the kelly hose) that connects the mud pump to the stand pipe. It is called the vibrating hose because it tends to vibrate and shake (sometimes violently) due to its close proximity to the mud pumps.

The distilleries were joined by a private railway, with a private steam locomotive, the Puggy, to transport coal, barley, peat and barrels between the distilleries. Soon after the railway was established in 1900 the distillery stopped production in the wake of the bankruptcy of Pattison's whisky, a major Scotch Whisky purchaser. Only BenRiachs maltings remained in active use, producing malt for Longmorn. It didn't produce spirit again until 1965 when it was reopened by Glenlivet Distillers Ltd. In 1978 the distillery changed hands, this time to Seagrams. Seagrams became part of Pernod Ricard in 2001 and the BenRiach distillery began operating for just three months of every year.

The complex, located at the corner of Central and Elm in West Gardner, has its origins in a chair manufacturing business established in 1826 by the Heywood brothers. The current brick factory buildings date to the later decades of the 19th century. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history Gardner's long history as a center of chair manufacturing began in 1806, when James Comee began making them with hand tools in 1805. Walter Heywood was an apprentice of his, and with his brother William opened their own shops in the 1820s. Their shop, located near the historic town center, burned in 1834. Levi Heywood, another brother, built a replacement shop on the site of the present surviving factory buildings the following year. This move, and the subsequent economic success of the Heywoods, resulted in a major shift of the town's economic center to West Gardner, where it remains today. The surviving company complex stands on on the east side of downtown Gardner, running from Lake Street in the north to Cross Street in the south. Central Street cuts diagonally across the complex in its northern third. No structures survive from the site's 1835 beginning, which was largely destroyed by fire in 1860. The only building to survive from the rebuilding program that followed is the 1863 building 5; subsequent expansion and building programs transformed the site into the one that survives today. In 1897 the Heywood company merged with the Wakefield Rattan Company, resulting in another expansion. The company suffered from competition and labor problems in the 20th century, and closed its doors in 1978. The surviving buildings have since been repurposed to other uses.

Most of the buildings in the district date to the 19th century, with the majority of houses exhibiting either Greek Revival or Colonial Revival styling. Among the earliest buildings is the First Minister's House at 186 Elm Street, a Georgian/Federal house built in 1792 for Rev. Jonathan Osgood.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Description and history The Jabez Partridge Homestead is located in a rural area of southern Gardner, on the east side of Partridge Road. Its main block is a 2-1/2 story frame structure, with a gabled roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. The main facade is five bays wide, with windows arranged symmetrically around a center entrance. The entrance is flanked by pilasters and topped by a transom window and corniced entablature. Attached to the rear of this block is an older 1-1/2 story frame building, also finished in clapboards. A barn and dairy shed stands across the street. The oldest portion of the house, the ell, was built before 1786, and is generally attributed a construction date of 1772. The house was built by Jabez Partridge, an early settler of the area. Partridge was active in town affairs, signing the petition for the town's incorporation in 1785. The property remained in the hands of Patridge's descendants until 1927, and has been in the Anderson family since then. There is a building that is believed to be a period outhouse on the property.

Developed industrially beginning in the early 19th century, the area now boasts a concentration of late 19th and early 20th century commercial, civic, and industrial architecture. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Description and history The town of Gardner was incorporated in 1785 out of parts of surrounding towns, with its original town center located northeast of the present commercial downtown. It developed beginning in the early 19th century as a center for the manufacture of furniture, in particular chairs, powered by waters of local streams. By the 1840s the town was an acknowledged leader in chair making, employing some 350 people in that trade. The town's civic focus shifted from the original center to be nearer the industrial area. The arrival of railroads in 1847 and 1871 spurred increased growth. The historic district encompasses most of downtown Gardner's historic civic, commercial, and industrial buildings. It is centered around the five-way intersection of Vernon, Parker, Central, Main, and West Lynde Streets. Commercial and civic resources radiate mainly west and south from there, with three large surviving mill complexes to the east. Most of the commercial buildings range in height from one to four stories, while buildings in the industrial mill complexes range up to six stories in height. There are only a few wood-frame residential structures in the area, which typically predate the late 19th-century development period. The district includes the town's major civic buildings, including its town hall, public library, and post office. Buildings individually listed on the National Register include the Garbose Building, the Gardner News Building, the Lake Street Fire Station, and the Heywood-Wakefield Company Complex.

He was a victim of judicial murder after a show trial. Judicial murder is the intentional and premeditated killing of an innocent person by means of capital punishment; therefore, it is a subset of wrongful execution. The Oxford English Dictionary describes it as \\"death inflicted by process of law, capital punishment, esp. considered to be unjust or cruel\\". Judicial murder at OED; retrieved 18 July 2018 An early case in which charges of judicial murder were raised was the Amboyna massacre in 1623, which caused a legal dispute between the English and Dutch governments over the conduct of a court in the Dutch East Indies that had ordered the execution of ten English men accused of treason. The dispute centered around differing interpretations of the legal jurisdiction of the court in question. The English believed that this court had not been competent to try and execute these EIC members, and so believed the executions to have been fundamentally illegal, thus constituting \\"judicial murder\\". The Dutch, on the other hand, believed the court to have been fundamentally competent, and wished to focus instead on misconduct of the particular judges in the court. Another early use of the term occurs in Northleigh's Natural Allegiance of 1688; \\"He would willingly make this Proceeding against the Knight but a sort of Judicial Murder\\".J Northleigh, Natural allegiance, and a national protection, truly stated, being a full answer to Dr. G. Burnett's vindication of himself. vi. p37 (1688); quoted in OED In 1777 Voltaire used the comparable term of assassins juridiques (\\"judicial murderers\\"). The term was used in German (Justizmord) in 1782 by August Ludwig von Schl√∂zer in reference to the execution of Anna G√∂ldi. In a footnote, he explains the term as :\\"the murder of an innocent, deliberately, and with all the pomp of holy Justice, perpetrated by people installed to prevent murder, or, if a murder has occurred, to see to it that it is punished appropriately.\\"‚ÄûErmordung eines Unschuldigen, vors√§tzlich, und so gar mit allem Pompe der heil. Justiz, ver√ºbt von Leuten, die gesetzt sind, da√ü sie verh√ºten sollen, da√ü ein Mord geschehe, oder falls er geschehen, doch geh√∂rig gestraft werde.‚Äú (von Schl√∂zer, p. 273) In 1932, the term is also used by Justice Sutherland in Powell v. Alabama when establishing the right to a court-appointed attorney in all capital cases: > Let us suppose the extreme case of a prisoner charged with a capital offense > who is deaf and dumb, illiterate and feeble minded, unable to employ > counsel, with the whole power of the state arrayed against him, prosecuted > by counsel for the state without assignment of counsel for his defense, > tried, convicted and sentenced to death. Such a result ‚Ä¶ if carried into > execution, would be little short of judicial murder. Hermann Mostar (1956) defends the extension of the term to un-premeditated miscarriages of justice where an innocent suffers the death penalty.Hermann Mostar. Unschuldig verurteilt! Aus der Chronik der Justizmorde. Herbig-Verlag, Munich (1956) The term is often applied to show trials that result in a death penalty, and has been applied to the deaths of Nikolai Bukharin, Milada Hor√°kov√°, and the eleven people executed after the Slansky trial.

First published in 1922, it is in the public domain.Butell, p. 245. Interpretation Stevens, the musical imagist, invokes the muse of poetry for \\"an image that is sure\\" in a kind of music that \\"gives motion to perfection more serene\\" than other forms of music summoned by the human condition. The poet aims at a kind of simplicity and spurns \\"the venom of renown.\\" The poet's muse might be compared in these respects to Socrates' philosophical muse. Socrates condemned the sophists and Stevens' queen rejects vices analogous to theirs in poetry. The dim view of renown poetically reinforces the Adagia dictum: \\"Poetry is, (and should be,) for the poet, a source of pleasure and satisfaction, not a source of honors.\\"Kermode and Richardson, p. 915. The use of the word 'near' is not idiosyncratic but purposeful. \\"Poetry is not personal,\\" as Stevens writes in Adagia.Kermode and Richardson, p. 902. And the clearness is not too clear. The poet's musician resists the intellect, \\"saving a little to endow our feignings with the strange unlike.\\" This is an expression of the Adagia thesis that poetry must resist the intelligence almost successfully.Kermode and Richardson, p. 910. The poem concludes with a reminder of the musical imagist's serious purpose. The poetic musician wears a band \\"set with fatal stones.\\" None of the foregoing proposes an identification of the poem's addressee (certainly not Socrates), a necessary first step in a defensible interpretation.

Groundwater is water present below the ground surface that saturates the pore space in the subsurface. Globally, between 25 per cent and 40 per cent of the world's drinking water is drawn from boreholes and dug wells. Groundwater is also used by farmers to irrigate crops and by industries to produce everyday goods. Most groundwater is clean, but groundwater can become polluted, or contaminated as a result of human activities or as a result of natural conditions. The many and diverse activities of humans produce innumerable waste materials and by-products. Historically, the disposal of such waste have not been subject to many regulatory controls. Consequently, waste materials have often been disposed of or stored on land surfaces where they percolate into the underlying groundwater. As a result, the contaminated groundwater is unsuitable for use. Current practices can still impact groundwater, such as the over application of fertilizer or pesticides, spills from industrial operations, infiltration from urban runoff, and leaking from landfills. Using contaminated groundwater causes hazards to public health through poisoning or the spread of disease, and the practice of groundwater remediation has been developed to address these issues. Contaminants found in groundwater cover a broad range of physical, inorganic chemical, organic chemical, bacteriological, and radioactive parameters. Pollutants and contaminants can be removed from groundwater by applying various techniques, thereby bringing the water to a standard that is commensurate with various intended uses.  Techniques  Ground water remediation techniques span biological, chemical, and physical treatment technologies. Most ground water treatment techniques utilize a combination of technologies. Some of the biological treatment techniques include bioaugmentation, bioventing, biosparging, bioslurping, and phytoremediation. Some chemical treatment techniques include ozone and oxygen gas injection, chemical precipitation, membrane separation, ion exchange, carbon absorption, aqueous chemical oxidation, and surfactant enhanced recovery. Some chemical techniques may be implemented using nanomaterials. Physical treatment techniques include, but are not limited to, pump and treat, air sparging, and dual phase extraction. = Biological treatment technologies =  Bioaugmentation  If a treatability study shows no degradation (or an extended lab period before significant degradation is achieved) in contamination contained in the groundwater, then inoculation with strains known to be capable of degrading the contaminants may be helpful. This process increases the reactive enzyme concentration within the bioremediation system and subsequently may increase contaminant degradation rates over the nonaugmented rates, at least initially after inoculation.Hayman, M, & Dupont, R. R. (2001). Groundwater and Soil Remediation: Process Design and Cost Estimating of Proven Technologies. Reston, Virginia: ASCE Press.  Bioventing  Bioventing is an on site remediation technology that uses microorganisms to biodegrade organic constituents in the groundwater system. Bioventing enhances the activity of indigenous bacteria and archaea and stimulates the natural in situ biodegradation of hydrocarbons by inducing air or oxygen flow into the unsaturated zone and, if necessary, by adding nutrients. During bioventing, oxygen may be supplied through direct air injection into residual contamination in soil. Bioventing primarily assists in the degradation of adsorbed fuel residuals, but also assists in the degradation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as vapors move slowly through biologically active soil.\\"Bioventing\\", The Center for Public Environmental Oversight (CPEO). Retrieved 2009-11-29.  Biosparging  Biosparging is an in situ remediation technology that uses indigenous microorganisms to biodegrade organic constituents in the saturated zone. In biosparging, air (or oxygen) and nutrients (if needed) are injected into the saturated zone to increase the biological activity of the indigenous microorganisms. Biosparging can be used to reduce concentrations of petroleum constituents that are dissolved in groundwater, adsorbed to soil below the water table, and within the capillary fringe.  Bioslurping  Bioslurping combines elements of bioventing and vacuum-enhanced pumping of free-product that is lighter than water (light non- aqueous phase liquid or LNAPL) to recover free-product from the groundwater and soil, and to bioremediate soils. The bioslurper system uses a ‚Äúslurp‚Äù tube that extends into the free-product layer. Much like a straw in a glass draws liquid, the pump draws liquid (including free-product) and soil gas up the tube in the same process stream. Pumping lifts LNAPLs, such as oil, off the top of the water table and from the capillary fringe (i.e., an area just above the saturated zone, where water is held in place by capillary forces). The LNAPL is brought to the surface, where it is separated from water and air. The biological processes in the term ‚Äúbioslurping‚Äù refer to aerobic biological degradation of the hydrocarbons when air is introduced into the unsaturated zone contaminated soil.\\"Bioslurping\\", The Center for Public Environmental Oversight (CPEO). Retrieved 2009-11-29.  Phytoremediation  In the phytoremediation process certain plants and trees are planted, whose roots absorb contaminants from ground water over time. This process can be carried out in areas where the roots can tap the ground water. Few examples of plants that are used in this process are Chinese Ladder fern Pteris vittata, also known as the brake fern, is a highly efficient accumulator of arsenic. Genetically altered cottonwood trees are good absorbers of mercury and transgenic Indian mustard plants soak up selenium well.Stewart, Robert. \\"Groundwater Remediation\\" , 2008-12-23.

Permeable reactive barriers Certain types of permeable reactive barriers utilize biological organisms in order to remediate groundwater. = Chemical treatment technologies =  Chemical precipitation  Chemical precipitation is commonly used in wastewater treatment to remove hardness and heavy metals. In general, the process involves addition of agent to an aqueous waste stream in a stirred reaction vessel, either batchwise or with steady flow. Most metals can be converted to insoluble compounds by chemical reactions between the agent and the dissolved metal ions. The insoluble compounds (precipitates) are removed by settling and/or filtering.  Ion exchange  Ion exchange for ground water remediation is virtually always carried out by passing the water downward under pressure through a fixed bed of granular medium (either cation exchange media and anion exchange media) or spherical beads. Cations are displaced by certain cations from the solutions and ions are displaced by certain anions from the solution. Ion exchange media most often used for remediation are zeolites (both natural and synthetic) and synthetic resins.  Carbon adsorption  The most common activated carbon used for remediation is derived from bituminous coal. Activated carbon adsorbs volatile organic compounds from ground water; the compounds attach to the graphite-like surface of the activated carbon.  Chemical oxidation  In this process, called In Situ Chemical Oxidation or ISCO, chemical oxidants are delivered in the subsurface to destroy (converted to water and carbon dioxide or to nontoxic substances) the organics molecules. The oxidants are introduced as either liquids or gasses. Oxidants include air or oxygen, ozone, and certain liquid chemicals such as hydrogen peroxide, permanganate and persulfate. Ozone and oxygen gas can be generated on site from air and electricity and directly injected into soil and groundwater contamination. The process has the potential to oxidize and/or enhance naturally occurring aerobic degradation. Chemical oxidation has proven to be an effective technique for dense non- aqueous phase liquid or DNAPL when it is present.  Surfactant enhanced recovery  Surfactant enhanced recovery increases the mobility and solubility of the contaminants absorbed to the saturated soil matrix or present as dense non-aqueous phase liquid. Surfactant-enhanced recovery injects surfactants (surface-active agents that are primary ingredient in soap and detergent) into contaminated groundwater. A typical system uses an extraction pump to remove groundwater downstream from the injection point. The extracted groundwater is treated aboveground to separate the injected surfactants from the contaminants and groundwater. Once the surfactants have separated from the groundwater they are re-used. The surfactants used are non- toxic, food-grade, and biodegradable. Surfactant enhanced recovery is used most often when the groundwater is contaminated by dense non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs). These dense compounds, such as trichloroethylene (TCE), sink in groundwater because they have a higher density than water. They then act as a continuous source for contaminant plumes that can stretch for miles within an aquifer. These compounds may biodegrade very slowly. They are commonly found in the vicinity of the original spill or leak where capillary forces have trapped them.\\"Surfactant Enhanced Recovery\\", The Center for Public Environmental Oversight (CPEO). Retrieved 2009-11-29. Permeable reactive barriers Some permeable reactive barriers utilize chemical processes to achieve groundwater remediation. = Physical treatment technologies =  Pump and treat  Pump and treat is one of the most widely used ground water remediation technologies. In this process ground water is pumped to the surface and is coupled with either biological or chemical treatments to remove the impurities.  Air sparging  Air sparging is the process of blowing air directly into the ground water. As the bubbles rise, the contaminants are removed from the groundwater by physical contact with the air (i.e., stripping) and are carried up into the unsaturated zone (i.e., soil). As the contaminants move into the soil, a soil vapor extraction system is usually used to remove vapors.\\"Air Sparging\\", The Center for Public Environmental Oversight (CPEO). Retrieved 2009-11-29.  Dual phase vacuum extraction  Dual-phase vacuum extraction (DPVE), also known as multi-phase extraction, is a technology that uses a high-vacuum system to remove both contaminated groundwater and soil vapor. In DPVE systems, a high-vacuum extraction well is installed with its screened section in the zone of contaminated soils and groundwater. Fluid/vapor extraction systems depress the water table and water flows faster to the extraction well. DPVE removes contaminants from above and below the water table. As the water table around the well is lowered from pumping, unsaturated soil is exposed. This area, called the capillary fringe, is often highly contaminated, as it holds undissolved chemicals, chemicals that are lighter than water, and vapors that have escaped from the dissolved groundwater below. Contaminants in the newly exposed zone can be removed by vapor extraction. Once above ground, the extracted vapors and liquid-phase organics and groundwater are separated and treated. Use of dual-phase vacuum extraction with these technologies can shorten the cleanup time at a site, because the capillary fringe is often the most contaminated area.\\"Dual Phase Extraction\\", The Center for Public Environmental Oversight (CPEO). Retrieved 2009-11-29.  Monitoring-Well Oil Skimming  Monitoring-wells are often drilled for the purpose of collecting ground water samples for analysis. These wells, which are usually six inches or less in diameter, can also be used to remove hydrocarbons from the contaminant plume within a groundwater aquifer by using a belt-style oil skimmer. Belt oil skimmers, which are simple in design, are commonly used to remove oil and other floating hydrocarbon contaminants from industrial water systems. A monitoring-well oil skimmer remediates various oils, ranging from light fuel oils such as petrol, light diesel or kerosene to heavy products such as No. 6 oil, creosote and coal tar. It consists of a continuously moving belt that runs on a pulley system driven by an electric motor. The belt material has a strong affinity for hydrocarbon liquids and for shedding water. The belt, which can have a vertical drop of 100+ feet, is lowered into the monitoring well past the LNAPL/water interface. As the belt moves through this interface, it picks up liquid hydrocarbon contaminant which is removed and collected at ground level as the belt passes through a wiper mechanism. To the extent that DNAPL hydrocarbons settle at the bottom of a monitoring well, and the lower pulley of the belt skimmer reaches them, these contaminants can also be removed by a monitoring-well oil skimmer. Typically, belt skimmers remove very little water with the contaminant, so simple weir-type separators can be used to collect any remaining hydrocarbon liquid, which often makes the water suitable for its return to the aquifer. Because the small electric motor uses little electricity, it can be powered from solar panels or a wind turbine, making the system self-sufficient and eliminating the cost of running electricity to a remote location.\\"The Alternative To Pump And Treat\\" Bob Thibodeau, Water Online Magazine, December 27, 2006.

Born in Palmerstown, County Kilkenny, Grace first played competitive hurling during his schooling at CBS Kilkenny. He arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of fifteen when he first linked up with the Kilkenny minor team. He joined the senior panel during the 1937-38 league. Grace immediately became a regular member of the starting fifteen, and won two All-Ireland medals and six Leinster medals. He was an All-Ireland runner-up on three occasions. As a member of the Leinster inter-provincial team on a number of occasions, Grace won one Railway Cup medals. At club level he won five championship medals having played with √âire √ìg, Carrickshock and Dicksboro. His grandsons, Tommy and P√°draig Walsh, have also enjoyed All-Ireland success with Kilkenny. His granddaughter, Grace, is a key member of the Kilkenny senior camogie team. Grace retired from inter-county hurling before the start of the 1950 championship. In retirement from playing Grace became heavily involved in the administrative affairs of the Gaelic Athletic Association. His tenure as secretary of the Kilkenny County Board spanned five decades. Playing careerClub= Grace began his club hurling career at underage levels with √âire √ìg. He won three minor championship medals with the club during a four-year spell between 1932 and 1935. In 1936 Grace was just out of the minor grade when he joined the √âire √ìg junior team. He won a championship medal in that grade that year following a 6-2 to 4-0 defeat of Moonrue. Both sides resumed their rivalry in the intermediate decider the following year. A huge 8-4 to 1-2 victory gave Grace a championship medal in that grade. By 1940 Grace had joined Carrickshock as the team were about to contest a third successive decider. A narrow 1-4 to 1-2 defeat of Mullinavat gave Grace a first championship medal in the senior grade. Old rivals and Grace's former club √âire √ìg provided the opposition in the 1941 county final, however, Carrickshock finally retained the title following a one-point 4-5 to 3-7 victory. It was Grace's second championship medal. Carrickshock's great run of success continued in 1942 as the club qualified for a fifth successive final. Threecastles, who were appearing in their first decider in thirty-five years, were the opponents, however, a 3-2 to 2-3 victory gave Grace his third championship medal. In 1943 Carrickshock set a remarkable record in Kilkenny hurling by winning a fourth successive championship. The 3-6 to 1-3 defeat of Mullinavat gave Grace a fourth championship medal. Grace added a county football championship medal to his collection in 1948 as St. Paul's defeated Conahy Sarsfields by 1-7 to 0-4 in a replay. By 1950 Grace was playing with Dicksboro. He won a fifth hurling championship medal that year following a 4-6 to 1-5 defeat of √âire √ìg in a replay. =Inter-county= In 1935 Grace was appointed captain of the Kilkenny minor team. He won a Leinster medal following a 7-9 to 1-1 trouncing of Laois. The subsequent All-Ireland decider on 1 September 1935 pitted Kilkenny against Tipperary. A narrow 4-2 to 3-3 victory gave Grace an All-Ireland Minor Hurling Championship medal. Grace made his senior debut in a 1-3 to 5-4 National Hurling League group stage defeat by Limerick on 3 April 1938. In 1939 Grace won his first Leinster medal following a 2-12 to 4-3 defeat of reigning All-Ireland champions Dublin. The subsequent All-Ireland final with Cork on 3 September 1939 is regarded as one of the most famous championship deciders of all-time. The game was an exciting one with an explosive finish, as a spectacular thunderstorm lit up proceedings. Willie Campbell landed a long-range free in the net for an equalizing goal for Cork and a draw looked likely. Terry Leahy doubled on a Paddy Phelan 70-yard free to secure the winning point for Kilkenny on the stroke of full-time. The 2-7 to 3-3 score line gave Kilkenny the victory and gave Grace a first All-Ireland medal. Grace won a second Leinster medal in 1940 following a 3-6 to 2-5 defeat of Dublin. The All-Ireland decider on 1 September 1940 brought Kilkenny and Limerick together for the last great game between the two outstanding teams of the decade. Early in the second-half Kilkenny took a four-point lead, however, once captain Mick Mackey was deployed at midfield he proceeded to dominate the game. Limerick hung on to win the game on a score line of 3-7 to 1-7. In 1943 Grace collected his third Leinster medal following a 3-9 to 2-6 defeat of Dublin. Kilkenny were later defeated by Antrim in the All-Ireland semi-final in one of the greatest hurling shocks of all-time. After surrendering their title the following year, Grace collected a fourth Leinster medal in 1945 following a 5-12 to 3-4 defeat of Dublin. On 2 September 1945 Kilkenny faced near neighbours and fierce rivals Tipperary in the All-Ireland decider. Tipp raced into a stunning lead and left Kilkenny trailing by 4-3 to 0-3 at half- time. Three goals by \\"the Cats\\" in the second period turned the tide, however, it wasn‚Äôt enough as Tipperary won by 5-6 to 3-6. Kilkenny and Dublin renewed their provincial dominance once again in the 1946 decider. In a much closer game Kilkenny won by 3-8 to 1-12, giving Grace a fifth Leinster medal. The subsequent All-Ireland final on 1 September 1946 pitted Kilkenny against old rivals Cork for the first time since 1939. Two quick goals just before half- time, one from the stick of Christy Ring, put Cork in the driving seat. Five more goals followed in the second period as Cork were the 7-5 to 3-8 winners. Grace collected a sixth and final Leinster medal in 1947 following a 7-10 to 3-6 defeat of Dublin once again. On 7 September 1947 Kilkenny faced Cork in a repeat of the previous year's decider. The game itself is often described as the greatest All-Ireland final of them all. Jim Langton and Terry Leahy spearheaded the Kilkenny attack, while Mossy O'Riordan and Joe Kelly scored goals for Cork that nearly won the game. In the end Kilkenny won by 0-14 to 2-7, thus avoiding the ignominy of becoming the first team to lose three-in-a- row. It was Grace's second All-Ireland medal. =Inter-provincial= Grace was a regular on the Leinster inter-provincial team for almost a decade, however, it was a largely unsuccessful period for the eastern province. He won his sole Railway Cup medal in 1941 as Leinster narrowly defeated archrivals Munster by 2-5 to 2-4. Administrative career Grace's dissatisfaction regarding player welfare saw him challenge for the position of county board secretary in late 1947. After being elected to the position he served until his death in 1984.

Early conductors included Vincent O'Brien and, from 1941, Michael Bowles, guest conductors included Aloys Fleischmann and Frederick May. Often called the 'Station Orchestra', many (albeit not regular) public concerts were given and broadcast live from venues such as the Mansion House, Metropolitan Hall and Capitol Theatre. In 1948, the broadcasting authority, now called Radio √âireann (Radio Ireland), expanded the orchestra to symphonic size by opening its membership to musicians from all over Europe. Ireland, as a neutral country during World War II, had been spared damage, so musicians from the wrecked economies of a ruined Europe were easy to attract. The new orchestra was named the Radio √âireann Symphony Orchestra. After Michael Bowles' involuntary retirement (Bowles had objected to recruiting so many foreigners for the 1948 enlargement),Axel Klein: \\"Bowles, Michael\\", in: The Encyclopaedia of Music in Ireland (as above), p. 112. the new orchestra worked for a while without a permanent conductor, commissioning major guest conductors instead such as Jean Martinon and Hans Schmidt-Isserstedt. In 1953, the orchestra found a principal conductor in Milan Horvat, who remained until 1956. In 1961, Ireland added television to its broadcasting service. The name of the new organisation was to be Raidi√≥ Teilif√≠s √âireann (RT√â). The orchestra became known as the RT√â Symphony Orchestra (RT√âSO). By now it was, de facto, the national orchestra of Ireland. Its new chief conductor from 1961 was Tibor Paul. He was succeeded by Albert Rosen, Colman Pearce, Bryden Thomson, and Janos F√ºrst. In 1981, the RT√âSO found a new home when the National Concert Hall opened in Dublin. Also, at about the same time, it expanded its broadcasting activities. Until 1979, RT√â had run only one radio channel and one television channel. In 1979, they established more channels, including an arts station called FM3, which aired numerous concerts by the RT√âSO. In 1989, the orchestra was again expanded and renamed the National Symphony Orchestra of Ireland. George Hurst became principal conductor in 1990. Kasper de Roo succeeded Hurst from 1994 to 1998. Alexander Anisimov became the orchestra's principal guest conductor in 1995 and principal conductor in 1998. Gerhard Markson succeeded Anissimov in 2001 and was principal conductor through 2009. Alan Buribayev was the principal conductor of the orchestra from 2010 to 2016, with Hannu Lintu as the orchestra's principal guest conductor from 2010 and Finghin Collins the orchestra's first-ever Associate Artist. Commencing September 2017, the current Principal Guest Conductor with a contract for three years is Nathalie Stutzmann.https://orchestras.rte.ie/performinggroup/rte-national-symphony- orchestra/, accessed 16 February 2018.

In 2018, it was announced that the National Concert Hall would take over the operation of the orchestra to relieve RT√â's funding position. In September 2016, Jaime Mart√≠n first guest-conducted the RT√â NSO.

Born in Castleconnell, County Limerick, Scanlan first played competitive hurling during his schooling at Limerick CBS. He arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of twenty-six when he first linked up with the Limerick senior team. He made his debut during the 1932 Thomond Feis. Scanlan immediately became a regular member of the starting fifteen and won two All-Ireland medals, five Munster medals and four National Hurling League medals. He was an All-Ireland runner-up on two occasions. As a member of the Munster inter-provincial team on a number of occasions, Scanlan won four Railway Cup medals. At club level he was a three- time championship medallist with Ahane in Limerick and a one-time championship medallist with Liam Mellows in Galway. Throughout his career Scanlan made 32 championship appearances. His retirement came following the conclusion of the 1941 championship. In retirement from playing Scanlan became a highly respected referee at club championship level. Scanlan is widely regarded as the greatest goalkeeper of his era and as Limerick's all-time number one custodian. Playing careerClub= Scanlan began his club career with Young Irelands and enjoyed much success in various tournament games. A lack of competitive games in his native Castleconnell saw Scanlan and his comrades cross the border to Tipperary where they linked up with the Newport club. In 1926 the Ahane club was formed with Scnalan serving on the organising committee. Success was slow in coming, however, after five years the club reached the summit of club hurling in Limerick. A 5-5 to 1-4 trouncing of Croom gave Ahane their first senior title, while it also gave Scanlan, who was captain of the team, his first championship medal. Ahane failed to retain their title, however, Scanlan's team returned to the championship decider once again in 1933. A 1-7 to 1-1 defeat of Croom gave him his second championship medal. Scanlan added a third championship medal to his collection in 1934 as Ahane retained their title following a 6-6 to 3-3 defeat of Kidimo. A move to Galway shortly after this victory saw Scanlan join the Liam Mellows club. He won a championship medal in 1935 as Liam Mellows defeated Ballinderreen in the decider. =Inter-county= Beginnings On 1 May 1932 Scanlan made his competitive debut for Limerick in a 5-5 to 4-1 semi-final defeat of Tipperary in the pre-season Thomond Feis. He was later included as goalkeeper on Limerick's unsuccessful championship team. Dominance In 1933 Limerick emerged as a major force after a decade in the doldrums. Scanlan lined out in his first Munster decider that year, as Limerick faced Waterford. With eight minutes left in the game, some spectators invaded the pitch and the match was abandoned. Since Limerick were winning by 3-7 to 1-2, the Munster Council declared them the champions and Scanlan collected his first Munster medal. The subsequent All-Ireland final on 3 September 1933 saw a record crowd of 45,176 travel to Croke Park to see Limerick face Kilkenny. After being level at the interval, the game remained close in the second half until a solo-run goal by Johnny Dunne sealed a 1-7 to 0-6 victory for Kilkenny. A successful league campaign throughout 1933-34 saw Limerick reach the decider against Dublin. In spite of home advantage, Limerick had to battle hard for a 3-6 to 3-3 victory. It was Scanlan's first National Hurling League medal. The subsequent provincial championship saw Limerick reach the decider, where they played Waterford for the second year in-a-row. The result was much the same, with Scanlan collecting a second Munster medal following a 4-8 to 2-5 victory. The All-Ireland final on 2 September 1934 was a special occasion as it was the golden jubilee final of the Gaelic Athletic Association. Dublin were the opponents and a close game developed. After leading by a point at the interval, Limerick went five clear with time running out. Dublin fought their way back to secure a remarkable draw. An injury ruled Scanlan out of the replay and he was replaced in goal by Tom Shinny. Limerick won at the second attempt on a score line of 5-2 to 2-6. Scanlon added a second league medal to his collection in 1935, as Limerick retained their title in a straightforward league format. Limerick dominated the provincial series of games once again, and lined out in the decider against Tipperary. Scanlan collected a third successive Munster medal following a 5-5 to 1-4 victory. Kilkenny were Limerick's opponents in the subsequent All-Ireland final on 1 September 1935 and, once again, the game was a close affair. Limerick were the red-hot favourites as a record crowd of over 46,000 turned up to watch a hurling classic. In spite of rain falling throughout the entire game both sides served up a great game. At the beginning of the second-half Lory Meagher sent over a huge point from midfield giving Kilkenny a lead which they would not surrender. The game ended in controversial circumstances for Mick Mackey when Limerick were awarded a close-in free to level the game. Jack Keane issued an instruction from the sideline that Timmy Ryan, the team captain, was to take the free and put the sliotar over the bar for the equalising point. As he lined up to take it, Mackey pushed him aside and took the free himself. The shot dropped short and into the waiting hands of the Kilkenny goalkeeper and was cleared. The game ended shortly after with Kilkenny triumphing by 2-5 to 2-4. In 1936 Limerick embarked on a tour of the United States where they defeated a New York team made up of Irish expatriates. As a result of the tour Limerick were awarded a bye into the Munster final where they faced Tipperary. An injured Mick Mackey scored a remarkable 5-3 as Limerick trounced the opposition by 8-5 to 4-3. It was Scanlan's fourth successive Munster medal. For the third time in four years the lure of a Kilkenny-Limerick clash brought a record crowd of over 50,000 to Croke Park for the All-Ireland decider on 6 September 1936. The first half produced a game that lived up to the previous clashes, and Limerick had a two-point advantage at half-time. Jackie Power scored two first-half goals, while a solo-run goal by captain Mackey in the second-half helped Limerick to a 5-6 to 1-5 victory. It was Scanlan's first All-Ireland medal on the field of play. Decline and comeback In 1937 Scanlan secured a third league medal, however, Limerick's bid for a record- equalling fifth successive Munster crown came to an end in the provincial decider when Tipperary were victorious. Limerick entered the record books in 1938 as the first team to win five consecutive National League titles. On a personal level it was a fourth winners' medal for Scanlan. A period of decline followed for Limerick, however, the team returned for their swansong in 1940. After drawing the Munster final with Cork, Scanlan's team were in trouble in the replay. Held scoreless for the entire opening half, Limerick sprang to life for the second period of play. A pitch invasion scuppered the game for ten minutes, however, Limerick held on to win by 3-3 to 2-4 and Scanlan collected a fifth Munster medal. The subsequent All-Ireland decider on 1 September 1940 brought Kilkenny and Limerick together for the last great game between the two outstanding teams of the decade. Early in the second-half Kilkenny took a four-point lead, however, once Mick Mackey was deployed at midfield he proceeded to dominate the game. Limerick hung on to win the game on a score line of 3-7 to 1-7. The win gave Scanlan his second All-Ireland medal. =Inter-provincial= Scanlon also lined out with Munster in the inter-provincial hurling competition. He won his first Railway Cup medal in 1934 as Munster defeated Leinster. Scanlon won three more Railway Cup titles in 1937, 1938 and 1940.

The order ceased existence in 1981. Creation The Order was developed as part of the 1967 centennial year for Canada, as aviation's role in the development of the country came into scrutiny. The honours then awarded for aviation proved to be inadequate, as no other award other than the McKee Trophy existed at the time. Several noteworthy aviators decided that this void needed to be filled. And as a result, the Order of Icarus was founded which honoured those persons still living at the time whose airborne skills had resulted in outstanding benefits to manned flight in Canada. After a lengthy search through various mythologies, the early members settled on the Greek story of Icarus. According to myth, Icarus' father Daedalus, under an unjust sentence of death by King Minos of Crete, created wings of feather and wax with which he and his son could fly to freedom. When an exhilarated Icarus flew too high, the heat of the sun destroyed his wings, melting the wax that held the feathers together. Icarus fell and died in the Icarian Sea, the \\"first airman casualty\\".History of the Order of Icarus, Canada's Aviation Hall of Fame. Retrieved 3 July 2008. Grades Companion is the only grade within the Order, except for the three persons governing the affairs of the Order, who are known as Senior Companions. Insignia The Order's insignia depicts a gilt sunburst around a white enameled figure representing Icarus. The sunburst also figures the cardinal points of the compass. The figure's wings are folded and mismatched to remind Companions of the Order of \\"airborne imperfections\\". Circling the figure, representing a single binding cause, is a knight's belt which displays, in gold letters, the motto \\"Despite Adversity\\". The golden loop which suspends the insignia is adorned with a maple leaf in honor of the Canadian origin of the Order. The neck ribbon has a broad white center stripe which represents flight's purity before the golden sun. The two blue lines which split this stripe suggest \\"the companionship of airmen in adversity\\". The broad band is a blue indicative of unexplored space, while the black bars outlying are reminders of mortality. Eligibility and appointment The basic tenets of the Order are: *membership shall be restricted to those adult persons whose contributions to manned flight while in operational control of an airborne device in free flight, has substantially benefitted Canadian aviation. *it shall number no more than 50 living Companions, inclusive of the three Senior Companions. *it shall in no manner become associated with any group or body politic. *it shall in no manner become indebted to any group, person, society, or government. *it shall in no manner be profited from by any Companion, save that reward of good fellowship and common respect.

A voter typically chooses a candidate (or party) for the legislature, rather than directly voting for specific policies. When doing so, the voter is essentially selecting among bundles of policies that a candidate or a party will enact if in power. Overview Occurring principally in republics, the electorate, rather than directly voting on each individual piece of proposed legislation, must choose a number of candidates (or parties) for the legislature. In so doing, they accept or reject each individual candidate or party and their \\"bundle\\" of positions on various issues. As there may be no candidate who perfectly reflects the views of an individual voter on all the issues of importance to him/her, each voter must prioritize what issues are most important and choose a candidate accordingly. Another form of bundling occurs in races where the candidate has a running mate who is elected on the same ticket, as in U.S. presidential elections. Bundling, as studied in public choice theory is essentially a variant of product bundling: each candidate and party is marketed as a product comprising a bundle of positions and attributes. In party-list proportional representation (particularly closed list variants), bundling may be especially pronounced, as voters select an entire slate of party candidates rather than choosing individual candidates, thus lacking the option of selecting one candidate of a party and not another. Robert Cooter's The Strategic Constitution notes that when voters' demand for a party is inelastic, the party will tend to nominate candidates based more on loyalty than on popularity: \\"Thus, monopoly power of a party decreases the demand of its leaders for loyalty.\\" Bundling in political economy is not to be confused with bundling of donations in campaign finance. It has been argued that bundling can often reduce the cost of political transactions. But it has also been argued that the bundling of policy packages necessitated by indivisibility weakens the signals provided even by well-informed voters.

The campaign was initiated in June 2008, following Davis's surprise resignation as an MP and from his position as the Shadow Home Secretary, and was the platform he used in standing for re-election to his seat in the subsequent Haltemprice and Howden by-election. Davis subsequently won his seat back with 72% of the vote. No established candidates stood against Davis, and no candidate opposing Davis polled more than 8% of the turnout. After winning the by-election, Davis returned to Parliament as a backbencher, vowing to continue the campaign. Davis's resignation followed a parliamentary vote on the Counter-Terrorism Bill, which would extend the maximum detention of terror suspects without charge from 28 to 42 days. Announcing his resignation, he stated his intention to spark a wider public debate on the erosion of civil liberties by the incumbent Labour government, and specifically the policies of the prime- minister Gordon Brown. Davis's motives have produced both praise and criticism, and split public opinion. The campaign was also questioned because Davis's opinions prior to his resignation were in line with those of his party, where, as Shadow Home Secretary, he was in a good position to effect change should the Conservatives win the next general election, predicted for 2010. Criticism was also levelled at the use of, while not un-precedented, the triggering of a by-election to stand on a single issue of principle. Criticism also cited the perceived waste of public money in holding a by-election, estimated to cost ¬£80,000. Background Late on the night of 11 June 2008, a parliamentary vote was held on whether to extend the limit on the period of detention of terror suspects without charge in England and Wales, from 28 to 42 days. The issue had been a contentious one in the media in the preceding weeks, with the prime-minister urging for the extension, following past dropped proposals of 90 days, as being a vital tool in the protection of the British public, in the War on Terrorism. The vote was narrowly passed in the House of Commons by 9 votes, after the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, together with 36 rebel Labour MPs, voted against the government. The vote was passed with the support of the government by the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), who had nine elected MPs. Speaking after his resignation, Davis stated that he intended to induce a wider public debate, and stop \\"the insidious and relentless erosion of civil liberties in Britain\\", in which the detention vote was a \\"watershed\\" in the debate, which also encompassed recent legislation about the increased use of CCTV, the Identity Cards Act 2006 and the expansion of the DNA database, which represented \\"the slow strangulation of fundamental freedoms by this government\\".The Guardian newspaper, 13 June 2008 Timeline Davis's resignation announcement came on 12 June 2008, a day after the passing of the initial vote on detention. Davis gave a post-resignation press conference outside parliament, having been refused the opportunity to do so in the House of Commons by the Speaker. His resignation speech came on the back of a similar newspaper column written by previous Conservative Prime Minister John Major a week earlier. Davis would be the official Conservative candidate.David Davis resigns from Commons, accessed 12 June 2008 Critics initially described Davis's decision as an emotional and knee-jerk reaction, however Davis later stated that the idea to resign if the vote was passed came as early as the previous weekend, and he had discussed standing down with his local party earlier in the week.Press Association, via The Beverley Guardian, accessed 12 June 2008 On suggestions that the Labour Party might not field a candidate because of the nature of the campaign, the safeness of the seat, and the previous bad result for Labour in the 2008 Crewe and Nantwich by-election, Davis stated that \\"we will have the campaign anyway, and find people to argue on both sides of the debate\\". On 13 June, the former editor of The Sun newspaper, Kelvin MacKenzie, announced that he was 90% certain to contest the election, should Labour not stand. He would stand on a pro-42-day detention platform, stating: \\"I have been associated with The Sun for 30 years. The Sun is very, very hostile to David Davis because of his 28 day stance and The Sun has always been very up for 42 days and perhaps even 420 days\\".BBC News Ex-Sun editor 'to take on' Davis, 13 June 2008 MacKenzie did not end up running. On 16 June, an official campaign website, www.daviddavisforfreedom.com,http://www.daviddavisforfreedom.com and a YouTube channel daviddavisforfreedomhttps://www.youtube.com/daviddavisforfreedom were launched. Davis formally stood down as an MP on 18 June 2008, by accepting the position of Steward and Bailiff of the Three Hundreds of Chiltern, which he immediately renounced in order to be able to stand for the by-election; this is the traditional method of resigning from Parliament, since MPs are not permitted to hold most positions in the gift of the Crown without approval from their constituencies. Immediately after the announcement, Labour announced they would not field a candidate. On 19 June, comments by Culture Secretary Andy Burnham contrasting Davis's past political record on libertarian issues, with the views of Liberty director Shami Chakrabarti, whom Davis asked for advice prior to his resignation, brought a threat of litigation from Chakrabarti to Burnham pending an apology. On 20 June, in an appearance on the panel of Question Time, Davis conceded that he was unlikely to be \\"offered his job (in the shadow cabinet) back\\" and the likely setback to his political career was a \\"cost he would have to bear\\" as a result of his decision to resign. On 11 July, Davis was subsequently re-elected to his seat with 72% of the vote. Davis received 17,113 votes, with the closest challenge coming from the Green Party and English Democrats with 1,758 and 1,714 votes respectively. All other candidates lost their deposit due to polling less than 5% of the vote. In his acceptance speechhttp://www.daviddavisforfreedom.com/index.cfm?fa=contentNews.newsDetails&newsID;=63360&from;=list after the by-election, Davis stated that \\"today is not the end of this campaign\\", pledging to continue campaigning against 42-day detention, ID cards and governmental invasion of privacy. Davis returned to Parliament as a backbencher, with no immediate likelihood of a return to the Shadow Cabinet.BBC News Cameron considers Davis's future, 11 July 2008 Reaction While the Conservative party voted against the 42 day extension in the initial poll, in the days following his resignation, Davis's move was characterised by Conservative party leader David Cameron as a \\"very courageous and brave\\" decision, but a \\"personal decision, and not one of the Shadow Cabinet or Conservative Party\\", although the Daily Telegraph newspaper claimed that Cameron believed it was unnecessary for Davis to resign, and had clearly told Davis of his view. Liberty director Shami Chakrabarti described the move as \\"very brave\\".[BBC News] Liberty director demands apology, 19 June 2008 Davis's Campaign Manager in the 2005 Conservative leadership contest, Andrew Mitchell (who in 2010 became the Secretary of State for International Development), although remaining a strong supporter of Davis, was reported by the media to have met him on the House of Commons terrace and was seen to have \\"looked horrified\\" when Davis told him of his decision, and to have vigorously argued with him about it. His friends apparently said later that he was \\"incandescent\\" at not having been consulted beforehand. Davis allegedly replied: \\"It's too late - I've already done it\\", to which Mitchell allegedly responded: \\"You're nuts!\\".David Davis: 'I'm not plotting. I no longer want to be leader' - Daily Telegraph 15 June 2008 Opinion outside Westminster is also sharply divided over Davis's actions. Many media commentators have poured scorn on Davis for precipitating an unnecessary by-election, characterising his actions as \\"quixotic\\", \\"egotistical\\" or even \\"mad\\". Equally, he has been described as \\"new voice of the people\\", and as setting a \\"powerful example\\". The varying opinions have been characterised as \\"a torrent of conflicting views\\". A national poll for The Independent reported that 48% thought Mr Davis was wrong to resign over 42 days detention against 39% who believed he was right. Funding Immediately following his resignation, Conservative party leader David Cameron stated that he would campaign for Davis, but he would receive no funding from Conservative Party HQ.BBC News, Q&A;: David Davis quits, 12 June 2008 On the day after the by-election, Davis stated on BBC Radio 2's Jeremy Vine Show that this lack of party funding had produced an unexpected demonstration of grassroots support for the campaign, with the subsequent donation of ¬£40,000 toward the campaign in small amounts from many sources around the country. Culture Secretary Andy Burnham called on Davis to fund the cost of the by-election to the taxpayer, estimated at ¬£80,000, from his own pocket.BBC News Davis 'should fund by-election', 18 June 2008 See also * Civil liberties in the UK * Detainee ReferencesExternal links * Official campaign website Category:Libertarianism in the United Kingdom Category:Human rights in the United Kingdom Category:Terrorism in the United Kingdom Category:Election campaigns in the United Kingdom Category:2008 in British politics Category:Political campaigns in the United Kingdom Category:2008 in England ","title":"David Davis 2008 by-election campaign"},{"id":"18008663","text":"The Hometown Journal is a weekly newspaper published in Struthers, Ohio and distributed nationally.

The ASBMR has a membership of nearly 4,000 physicians, basic research scientists, and clinical investigators from around the world. Mission The mission of the ASBMR is to promote excellence in bone and mineral research, foster integration of clinical and basic science, and facilitate the translation of that science to health care and clinical practice. The Society‚Äôs broad goals include supporting the educational development of future generations of basic and clinical scientists, and disseminating new knowledge in bone and mineral metabolism. Founding In the 1970s, a growing number of US-based scientists began to focus their research on the understanding of basic bone biology and the disease osteoporosis. This led to the rise of a new field ‚Äì bone and mineral research. In 1974, while attending the annual meeting of The Endocrine Society in Chicago, Illinois, USA, bone scientists Louis Avioli, Claude Arnaud, Norman Bell, William Peck, John Potts and Lawrence Raisz, along with Shirley Hohl, met at the Drake Hotel. The group laid the groundwork for an organization that would promote the study of bone and mineral research, support scientists involved in such research, and facilitate the discussion and exchange of new developments in the field. Three years later, in November 1977, the group‚Äôs goals were realized with the official incorporation of the ASBMR as a nonprofit organization in St. Louis, Missouri, USA. The first ASBMR Annual Meeting was held June 11‚Äì12, 1979 at the Disneyland Hotel in Anaheim, California, USA with approximately 150 people in attendance. Growth In 1984, ASBMR leaders established The Osteoporosis Foundation, which was later renamed the National Osteoporosis Foundation. The Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (JBMR)], the official journal of the ASBMR, was established in 1986. Initially a bi-monthly publication, it became a monthly journal in 1990. Lawrence G. Raisz served as the first Editor-in-Chief of the JBMR. The ASBMR published the first edition of The Primer on the Metabolic Bone Diseases and Disorders of Mineral Metabolism, a textbook for medical and graduate students, in 1990. Murray J. Favus served as the Editor-in-Chief for the first six editions of the Primer. The rise of new pharmacological treatments for osteoporosis in the 1990s, most notably the class of drugs known as bisphosphonates, gave rise to an influx of scientists and clinician- researchers into the field. This influx resulted in a dramatic increase in ASBMR membership and annual meeting attendance. During this period, the ASBMR expanded its advocacy endeavors targeted at U.S. government funding for bone research. The Society was a founding member of the National Coalition for Osteoporosis and Related Bone Diseases (‚ÄúBone Coalition‚Äù) in 1991. ASBMR also became a member of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB). Though conceived as a scientific research society, in recent years, ASBMR has made increasing public and healthcare professional awareness of bone diseases a top priority. The Society launched several educational initiatives aimed at primary care physicians to improve the detection and treatment of bone diseases, and founded the National Bone Health Alliance to serve as a resource and raise public awareness of bone diseases. It has also spearheaded task forces on numerous clinically relevant topics, including: osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical femoral fractures. The Society has also sought to expand the study of bone to those in related fields and to those in emerging areas of the world. Education Annual Meetings = The ASBMR Annual Meeting brings together leading basic, translational and clinical researchers in bone from around the world. The event is held in September or October and attracts nearly 4,000 attendees each year. The scientific program includes poster presentations, plenary lectures, workshops, networking events, ancillary meetings, and a host of other activities. Hallmarks of the ASBMR Annual Meeting include the Gerald D. Aurbach Lecture, the Louis V. Avioli Lecture, and the ASBMR/ECTS Clinical Debate. Abstracts from the meeting‚Äôs poster presentations are published as supplements in the JBMR. A list of past ASBMR Annual Meetings, as well as photos, program and abstracts books and webcasts, can be found on the ASBMR website. = Topical Meetings = The ASBMR began holding topical meetings in 2002 to address specialized research topics within the bone field. Smaller in scale, topical meetings disseminate and discuss in-depth research on a specific area of scientific interest. A list of past ASBMR Topical Meetings, as well as photos, program and abstracts books and webcasts, can be found on the ASBMR website. Publications Journal of Bone and Mineral Research = The Journal of Bone and Mineral Research, the official journal of the ASBMR. The JBMR publishes original manuscripts, reviews, and special articles in basic and clinical science relevant to bone, muscle and mineral metabolism. Manuscripts are published on the biology and physiology of bone and muscle, relevant systems biology topics (e.g. osteoimmunology), and the pathophysiology and treatment of osteoporosis, sarcopenia and other disorders of bone and mineral metabolism. 2016 Journal Citation Reports Impact Factor was 6.3, ranking 15/138 (Endocrinology & Metabolism). JBMR readers include basic scientists and physicians specializing in endocrinology, physiology, cell biology, pathology, molecular genetics, epidemiology, internal medicine, rheumatology, orthopaedics, geriatrics, dentistry, gynecology, molecular biology, nephrology and many other disciplines. The JBMR‚Äôs international editorial board encourages manuscript submissions from around the world. = Primer on the Metabolic Bone Diseases and Disorders of Mineral Metabolism = The Primer on the Metabolic Bone Diseases and Disorders of Mineral Metabolism is a resource for scientists and students seeking an overview of the bone and mineral field and for clinicians who see patients with disorders of bone and mineral metabolism. The text provides valuable information on the symptoms, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of metabolic bone diseases and both common and rare disorders. Authors include internationally renowned experts in the field. = ASBMR e-News Weekly = The ASBMR e-News Weekly is a member newsletter featuring society initiatives and related information on upcoming events, conferences, membership benefits, and other important information. The newsletter keeps members abreast of ASBMR activities‚Äîfrom Council, Committee, task force, and program updates to the role of ASBMR within the bone and mineral field and the scientific and medical community at large. Each issue also includes the most recently published articles in JBMR and highlights current noteworthy news articles pertaining to the bone field from thousands of news sources worldwide.

He was instrumental in the colonization of Nantucket Island in the Massachusetts colony. He was the maternal grandfather of Benjamin Franklin. A Baptist missionary, teacher, and surveyor, his dealings with the native population promoted harmony between the Native Americans and European settlers. Life Peter Folger was born in England, the son of John Folger Jr. and Meribah Gibbs. He left Norwich, Norfolk, England for America in 1635, settling initially in Watertown, Massachusetts, and later moving to Martha's Vineyard, where he worked as a teacher and surveyor. His father, John, a widower, came to the colonies in 1636 and ultimately settled in Martha's Vineyard. In 1644, he married Mary Morrell, whom he met on the voyage from England. Morrell was an indentured servant and Folger bought her freedom from Hugh Peters for ‚Ç§20. They had nine children by 1669, the last of whom, Abiah Folger, married Josiah Franklin, and was the mother of Benjamin Franklin. At the Vineyard, Folger supported himself by teaching school and surveying land. He was hired by Governor Thomas Mayhew and his son Thomas Mayhew Jr. to convert the Native American population to Christianity, during which time he learned to speak the native language. He was a Baptist in faith, and as such was told not to visit with the Puritans on the mainland. Rev. Experience Mayhew, in a letter to John Gardner, Esquire, dated 1694, states that when Thomas Mayhew, Jr. left for England in 1657, he left the care of his church and mission to Peter Folger. From time to time between 1659 and 1662, Folger journeyed to Nantucket in order to survey it for the proprietors. He was an interpreter for Tristram Coffin. In 1663 Folger moved to Nantucket full-time, having been granted a half a share of land by the proprietors, where he was a surveyor, an Indian interpreter, and clerk in the courts. Shortly thereafter, Folger's daughter, Abiah, was born, later to become the mother of Benjamin Franklin, who referred to him fondly in his autobiography. Folger died at Nantucket, Massachusetts, in 1690 and is buried in the Founders Burial Ground. His wife Mary Morrill Folger lived until 1704.

This led to the Rosemount ski boot of 1965, one of the first all-synthetic designs. The ski factory was sold to Bass Sports in 1968, but the Rosemount brand was used until it was purchased by Raichle in 1972. Its success captured the attention of several high-tech companies. Rosemount was acquired by Emerson Electric Company in August 1976. In 2013, Emerson announced the purchase of a new global headquarters location in Shakopee, Minnesota for its Rosemount branded products headquarters.

She later became a missionary in Singapore, where she was captured in the Second World War. The plight of Dryburgh and her fellow inmates such as Betty Jeffrey in a Japanese prisoner of war camp inspired the 1996 film Paradise Road. She wrote The Captives' Hymn while imprisoned. Early life Margaret Dryburgh was born in Nelson Street, Monkwearmouth, Sunderland, UK in 1890. She was the eldest child of Reverend William Dryburgh, minister of St Stephen's Presbyterian Church, and his wife, Elizabeth Webster. The family moved to Swalwell, near Gateshead, when Dryburgh was a baby, where her father worked as minister at Swalwell Presbyterian Church from 1895. When he retired in 1906, the family returned to Sunderland, where their local church was St George's in Stockton Road. Dryburgh trained as a teacher at King's College, Newcastle, after leaving school, later achieving a BA degree from Durham University with distinction in Latin and Education. She then joined the staff of Ryhope Grammar School in 1911, where she taught history, French and Latin for the next six years. She left teaching, however, to become a Presbyterian missionary in 1917, qualifying as a nursing sister to extend her skills. It is believed it was the influence of her mother, a leading light in the Women's Missionary Association, which persuaded her to volunteer for this role. Life as a missionary Dryburgh's first posting as a missionary came in 1919, when she was sent to Shantou in China. Quite by chance, the mission was supported by her family church of St George's, and she was affectionately \\"adopted\\" by the Sunderland congregation as \\"our missionary.\\" It was a critical time in China's history, with a growth in anti-foreign feeling, but Dryburgh managed to learn the Shantou dialect in two years and then started work as a teacher at the Sok Tek Girls' School. Dryburgh moved on to Singapore some years later, where she was appointed principal of the Choon Goan School in 1934. Such was her dedication to the role that, within a very short time, she raised standards so much that it was officially recognised as a secondary school and received Government aid. Dryburgh spent her time outside the classroom helping in the local community. A skilled musician, she organised the training of choirs and was a stalwart of the Women's Fellowship. Fund-raising concerts and charity events in aid of the school were also arranged by Dryburgh, as well as picnics for local children. Former pupils later recalled how she \\"frequently paid for milk for undernourished pupils\\" and encouraged the girls to become teachers. Second World War The outbreak of the Second World War put an end to her missionary work. When Singapore fell in 1942, Dryburgh tried to escape from the advancing Japanese forces by ship, but was captured with other missionaries. The women were taken to a Japanese internment camp at Sumatra, where death from disease and malnutrition was common. Despite the squalid conditions, Dryburgh retained her indomitable \\"British Bulldog\\" spirit throughout, as well as her strong Christian faith. Within days of arriving at the camp, Dryburgh started arranging church services for her fellow inmates, as well as a Glee Club, hymn singing, writing classes and poetry sessions. She also ran a short story club for the prisoners and produced a monthly camp magazine which included articles on cookery, a children's section and a crossword puzzle. Her primary interest, though, was her musical work. After joining forces with fellow musician, Norah Chambers, a graduate of the Royal Academy of Music in London, the pair formed a camp choir. Dryburgh wrote down pages of music from memory, from baroque to contemporary, for the Vocal Orchestra to perform, as well as pieces of her own light classical compositions. The music was arranged in four parts, which were hummed by the women to give the effect of an orchestra, and included pieces by Handel, Chopin, Brahms and Beethoven. Even the Japanese soldiers were said to be amazed at what they heard, inviting themselves to the concerts. The Captives' Hymn was one of the pieces written by Dryburgh, and was sung each Sunday during church services. The concerts continued throughout 1944 and into 1945. The chorus ceased to function, however, once over half of its members had died. Constant hunger and disease eventually took their toll on Dryburgh, who died on 21 April 1945, a few days after the women were transferred to a camp at Loebok Linggau. She had become ill on the three-day journey from Bangka Island camp, and eventually succumbed to dysentery. The remaining inmates buried Dryburgh among some rubber trees at Belau camp on Sumatra two days later. She was later reburied in the Dutch War Grave Cemetery in Java in 1951. Legacy The Captives' Hymn and her other compositions are still performed by women's choirs. A documentary about camp life, Song of Survival, was shown on Channel 4. The film Paradise Road, made in 1996, told the story of life at the camp, with the role of Dryburgh played by Pauline Collins. The Captives' Hymn was used in the film during a burial scene. Dryburgh's name was changed to Margaret Drummond in the film.

Gordon MacRae performs the song in the 1956 film version. The now jobless carousel barker Billy Bigelow, the antihero of the musical, sings this seven-and-a-half minute song just after he has learned he is about to become a father. In it, he happily daydreams over what it would be like to be a father to a boy, but midway through the song, he realizes that it could turn out to be a girl. The song immediately becomes more tender, as he begins to like the idea. At song's end, he considers that a girl needs the very best a father can offer, and decides to get money to provide for her. It is this idea that spurs him on to help his criminal pal Jigger Craigin in committing a robbery, an act which ultimately leads to personal disaster for Billy. Frank Sinatra had recently become a father when he recorded \\"Soliloquy\\" for the first time on May 28, 1946. With the time limitation of about 3:30 on a 10\\" 78-rpm record his 7:57 long recording was released on Columbia's Masterwork label (the classical division) as two sides of a 12\\" record. The song is extremely unusual in that it requires the singer to sing solo (and occasionally speak) for a full seven-and-a-half minutes, in the manner of an operatic aria, without the benefit of an accompanying choral group \\"taking up the slack\\", as is usually the case in long musical numbers (e.g. Ol' Man River). The lengthy song Glitter and Be Gay, from Leonard Bernstein's Candide, makes a similar requirement of the soprano performing it.

She is considered to be a central figure in one of the great art movements of the century. Throughout her career, Noskowiak photographed quite a few subjects those including landscapes, still lives and portraits. Her most well-known, and unacknowledged, portraits are of the author, John Steinbeck. In 1936, Noskowiak was awarded a prize at the annual exhibition of the San Francisco Society of Women Artist. She was also represented in the San Francisco Museum of Art‚Äôs 1939 ‚ÄúScenes from San Francisco‚Äù exhibit. Ten years before her death, Noskowiak's work was included in a WPA exhibition at the Oakland Museum, in Oakland, California. LifeEarly life= Noskowiak was born in Leipzig, Germany. Her father was a landscape gardener who instilled in her an awareness of the land that would later become evident in her photography. In her early years, she moved around the world while her father sought work in Chile, then Panama, before finally settling in Los Angeles, California in 1915. In 1919, she moved to San Francisco to enroll in secretarial school. Interested in photography at an early age, in 1925, Noskowiak would become a receptionist in Johan Hagemeyer's photographic studio in Los Angeles County. Upon expressing her interest in photography Hagemeyer, wrote off dream as a joke in his diary. =Becoming a Photographer= In early April 1929, Noskowiak met photographer Edward Weston at a party and the two began dating immediately; her eventually becoming his model, muse, pupil, and assistant. Weston first taught her to spot photos‚Äîtouching up flaws in prints‚Äîbefore he giving her first professional camera. This camera included no film and for several months Noskowiak worked with Weston pretending to photograph while he taught her the mechanics of photography. During her time with Weston Noskowiak's photography developed tremendously showcasing her understanding of craftsmanship, as well as her own style. Several of Weston's works, such as Red Cabbage Halved and Artichoke Halved, were inspired by Noskowiak's early negatives.Weston even once stated: \\"Any of these I would sign as my own.\\" Dora Hagemeyer (sister-in- law of Johan) wrote that while Noskowiak's photographic style was clean and direct like Weston's, she \\"put into her work something which is essentially her own: a subtle and delicate loveliness.\\" =Group F.64= Photography in the late 1800s and early 1900s was defined by pictorialism, a style that refers to a photographer manipulating an otherwise straightforward photograph in the means of 'creating'. This was in response to claims that photography was not an art but merely scientific documentation. Weston and other photographers began to turn away from pictorialism, with many having growing concerns about their place in photography. In 1932 Noskowiak became an organizing member of the short-lived Group f/64, which included such important photographers as Ansel Adams, Imogen Cunningham, Willard Van Dyke, Weston and his son Brett. Noskowiak's works were shown at Group f/64's inaugural exhibition at San Francisco's M. H. de Young Museum; she had nine photographs in the exhibit ‚Äì the same number as Weston.[5] . =Early Success= In the summer of 1933, Noskowiak, along with Weston and Van Dyke, traveled to New Mexico for scenery shots. Her photographs Cottonwood Tree - Taos, New Mexico, and Ovens, Taos Pueblo, New Mexico both are from this trip and differ from her previous work. Cottonwood Tree is not nearly as intimate as her other works while Ovens is the earliest of her work to focus on human-made culture. Later that summer, she had her first solo show at Denny-Watrous Gallery in Carmel. The exhibition included a series of photographs from New Mexico. She held another solo exhibition at 683 Brockhurst in November. Between 1933 and 1940, she participated in a few of Group f.64 exhibitions, including shows such as the Fine Arts Gallery in San Diego, Fresno State College, and the Portland Art Museum in Oregon. =Group F.64 dissolvement= Noskowiak and Weston broke up in 1935, Group f. 64 disbanded shortly thereafter. Perhaps, due to her frayed relationship with Weston and perhaps because other members of the group were going their separate ways. Although writings from Noskowiak began to dwindle during this time her career did not. Noskowiak also moved to San Francisco and opened a portrait studio this same year. This same year Noskowiak moved to San Francisco to open a portrait studio on Union Street. In 1936, she was one of eight photographers, including Weston, selected for the California region of the Federal Art Project to document California during the Great Depression =Commercial Work= Noskowiak also engaged in commercial work and commissions to make a living. After Groupf.64 dissolved, she spent the next year photographing California artists and their paintings, sculptures, and murals. These images then toured to a variety of public institutions. Though she continued to photograph as an artist, Noskowiak's livelihood from the 1940s on was based on portraiture, fashion and architectural images. Noskowiak photographed many prominent figures such as painter Jean Charlot, dancer Martha Graham, composer Edgard Var√®se, teenage violinist Isaac Stern, and writers Langston Hughes and John Steinbeck. The portrait of Steinbeck is particularly powerful, and is one of only a handful of images of the writer in the 1930s. It is used extensively to this day. She continued commercial photography up until the 1960s, photographing images for manufactures of lamps and stoves, as well as for architects. Photography She primarily focused on landscapes and portraits, specifically between the 1930s and 1940s. Noskowiak embraced straight photography and used as a tool to give newer meaning to her photographs. Her technique emphasizing the forms, patterns, and textures of her subjects, rather than just documenting it. Her earliest works reflect the photographers of her period and their thoughts on pictorialism. In her earliest works, such as City Rooftops, Mountains in Distance (the 1930s), there's a graphicness to how she abstracted the piece. There's the dark, strong industrial structure that contrasts against the light sky. There are almost no logs seen on the buildings, and if they are they are blurred beyond readability. This is an example of the 'New Objectivity' movement, which focused on a sharp, documentary approach to photography. Noskowiak often composed her photographs to intersect her subjects, which gave a more dynamic feel to her photographs. Good examples of these are in her works Kelp (1930) and Calla Lily (1932). The composition crops the visual boundaries of the kelp plant and flower and draws the viewer's eyes to the texture of the plants. Kelp is so abstracted that if not for the title it would be unrecognizable. While in Calla Lily, her use of chiaroscuro gives a luminous almost floating feeling to the photograph. Her photograph, Agave (1933), is an intimate viewing of the cactus plant. Another example of her compositions separating the object from what is shown and emphasis on the beautiful pattern on the plant. Sonya Noskowiak, Calla Lily, 1932 Sonya Noskowiak, Kelp, 1930 Noskowiak utilized the same technique of straight photography in her pictorial portraits and commercial works. The same intimacy shown in Agave can be seen in portrait works such as John Steinbeck (1935) and Barbara (1941). Sonya Noskowiak, John Steinbeck, 1930 In both, she creates an intimate atmosphere, one in which the viewer feels as though they are there interacting with the subjects. Even in her more commercial works, Noskowiak's style and technique still remained. In her untitled 1930s photograph, you have a model with a broad-brimmed hat that conceals her face. The composition of the piece relieves viewers from thinking about the photograph as an advertisement. The cropping and position of the models give closeness, viewers get the feel of being in the moment with the model than an advertisement quality. Noskowiak's Legacy In 1965, Noskowiak was diagnosed with bone cancer, thus then ending her practice in photography. She lived another ten years before passing away on April 28, 1975, in Greenbrae, California. It is hard to say what legacy Noskowiak left behind as the discussion of her work began to dwindle after her break up with Weston. Though there are a few people, such as the director of Weston Gallery in Carmel Richard Gadd, who believes that Noskowiak forged a path for young photographers. In recent years, Noskowiak's work has been included in group shows at Weston Gallery, the Oakland Museum of California and the Portland Museum of Art in Maine. In 2011, thirty-six years after her death, Noskowiak shared an exhibition with Brett Weston at the Phoenix Art Museum. In 2015, eight of Noskowiak‚Äôs works were on view at the Allentown Art Museum in Pennsylvania. The exhibition, named Weston's Women, only acknowledges Noskowiaks and other female artists in their relation to Weston. Her archives, including 494 prints, hundreds of negatives and many letters to Edward Weston, are now housed at the Center for Creative Photography in Tucson, Arizona.

Tapas is the most advanced stage of meditation in which one remains absorbed for long periods in the non-dualistic state of consciousness known as samƒÅdhi.Lt. Gen. Hanut Singh, Shri Shri Shri Shivabalayogi Maharaj: Life & Spiritual Ministration, pp. 180. After he completed tapas, he assumed the name Shivabalayogi, which some devotees had already begun to use for him. The name means \\"Yogi devoted to Shiva and Parvati.\\" Shiva is God in the form of a yogi. Bala is one of the many names for Parvati, God in the form of a yogini. The name reflects that Shivabalayogi is a manifestation of both the male and female aspects of the divine (Ardhanarishwara).Thomas L. Palotas, Divine Play, the Silent Teaching of Shivabalayogi p. 196. Life of Shivabalayogi Maharaj The female aspect represents the invisible energy of the Divine through which the entire creation operates, while the male aspect represents the pure consciousness of existence beyond all imaginations.See for example the definitions here and here Generally, devotees called him simply \\"Swamiji\\" meaning \\"respected Master\\". In common parlance, a bala-yogi is a child yogi, a yogi who has started living as a yogi from childhood. Such a yogi is specially venerated, as in the adage \\"A saint in youth is a saint in truth\\". For three decades he traveled extensively in India and Sri Lanka, initiating over ten million people into dhyana meditation. From 1987 to 1991, he traveled in England and the United States.Thomas L. Palotas, Tapas Shakti pp. 187-188. Thomas L. Palotas, Divine Play, the Silent Teaching of Shivabalayogi pp. 189-190. Shivabalayogi in the West, and Bruce Young, \\"Guru- Disciple,\\" pp. 204-206. Shivabalayogi's teaching is consistent with the Vedanta, emphasizing the need for sadhana (spiritual practice) to achieve Self-realization.e.g. Lt. Gen. Hanut Singh, Shri Shri Shri Shivabalayogi Maharaj: Life & Spiritual Ministration, pp. 98-105.  Childhood  Shri Shivabalayogi Maharaj was born Sathyaraju Allaka on January 24, 1935, in the small village of Adivarapupeta in the rice paddy country of the Godavari River delta in the state of Andhra Pradesh, India.Lt. Gen. Hanut Singh, Shri Shri Shri Shivabalayogi Maharaj: Life & Spiritual Ministration, pp. 2-3. Thomas L.Palotas, Divine Play p. 19 Most of the villagers earned a simple living making cotton sarees and dhoties (man's wraps) on handlooms.Adivarapupeta and Shivabalayogi Maharaj Sathyaraju's father, Bheemanna, was a weaver with very little means and died before Sathyaraju was three.Lt. Gen. Hanut Singh, Shri Shri Shri Shivabalayogi Maharaj: Life & Spiritual Ministration, pp. 3. The young boy was raised by his mother, Parvatamma, and maternal grandfather, Goli Satham. They were among the poorest in the village.Thomas L. Palotas, Divine Play, pp. 19-20. Bruce Young, \\"Guru-Disciple,\\" pp. 27-28. Sathyaraju was by nature extremely determined and honest; he found untruthfulness and injustice particularly difficult to tolerate.Lt. Gen. Hanut Singh, Shri Shri Shri Shivabalayogi Maharaj: Life & Spiritual Ministration, pp. 8-14. Details of Shivabalayogi's childhood, including stories that he told devotees and eyewitness accounts, can be found at Thomas L. Palotas, Swamiji's Treasure pp. 25-36.  Initiation in Tapas  Around the age of twelve, Sathyaraju made his way to the nearby Draksharam temple, where he prayed to Lord Bhimeshwar to grant him peace and also the understanding of his relatives for certain actions he had to take in accordance with his strong moral principles.Lt. Gen. Hanut Singh, Shri Shri Shri Shivabalayogi Maharaj: Life & Spiritual Ministration, pp. 14. Eventually a profound change came over him. In contrast to his normally outgoing nature, he became withdrawn and introverted.Bruce Young, \\"Guru-Disciple,\\" pp. 35. His appetite began to shrink and he lost interest in worldly activities.Bruce Young, \\"Guru-Disciple,\\" pp. 35. Sathyaraju experienced samadhi (enlightenment) on August 7, 1949 when he was fourteen years old.Lt. Gen. Hanut Singh, Shri Shri Shri Shivabalayogi Maharaj: Life & Spiritual Ministration, pp. 23. He was sitting on the bank of the Godavari irrigation canal just outside the village, eating palmyra fruit that he had divided up between him and his eleven friends. As Shivabalayogi described the incident, he was squeezing the fruit when his body began to tremble with vibrations; a bright light emanated from the fruit in his hands, and he heard the cosmic sound of Aum.Lt. Gen. Hanut Singh, Shri Shri Shri Shivabalayogi Maharaj: Life & Spiritual Ministration, pp. 22. Thomas L. Palotas, Tapas Shakti pp. 3-5. Bruce Young, \\"Guru-Disciple,\\" pp 35. As he watched, a black lingam (a lingam symbolizes the absoluteness of the Divinity), about a foot and a half tall, appeared in his hands. The lingam broke in two and a tall, handsome man emerged standing in front of the boy.Lt. Gen. Hanut Singh, Shri Shri Shri Shivabalayogi Maharaj: Life & Spiritual Ministration, pp. 22-23. Thomas L. Palotas, Tapas Shakti pp. 3-5. Bruce Young, \\"Guru-Disciple,\\" pp 35-36. The man was in the form of a jangama devara, an ascetic who worships and dresses like Lord Shiva. His dark skin appeared smeared with light ash. He wore a white cloth (dhoti) wrapped around his waist, a necklace of rudraksha beads, and his matted hair piled on top of his head, all in the manner of the yogis of ancient times.Lt. Gen. Hanut Singh, Shri Shri Shri Shivabalayogi Maharaj: Life & Spiritual Ministration, pp. 23. He was extremely handsome with large, beautiful eyes. A bright light emanated from him, and all Sathyaraju could see was the yogi and the divine light.Lt. Gen. Hanut Singh, Shri Shri Shri Shivabalayogi Maharaj: Life & Spiritual Ministration, pp. 23. The yogi instructed Sathyaraju to sit in a cross-legged position and close his eyes. The yogi touched the boy's forehead at the spiritual third eye (bhrikuti) between the eyebrows, then gently tapped him on top of the head. Sathyaraju immediately passed into samadhi.Lt. Gen. Hanut Singh, Shri Shri Shri Shivabalayogi Maharaj: Life & Spiritual Ministration, pp. 23. Thomas L. Palotas, Tapas Shakti p. 5. Bruce Young, \\"Guru-Disciple,\\" pp 36. None of the eleven other boys with Sathyaraju saw the spiritual vision that he experienced.Thomas L. Palotas, Tapas Shakti pp. 5. Thomas L. Palotas, Divine Play p. 30. Bruce Young, \\"Guru-Disciple,\\" pp. 37. To them their friend was sitting as if in deep meditation. They thought he was acting. But when they were unable to rouse him from this state, they were afraid Sathyaraju was either possessed by a spirit or dead.Lt. Gen. Hanut Singh, Shri Shri Shri Shivabalayogi Maharaj: Life & Spiritual Ministration,\\" p. 24-25. They ran to the village for help. The villagers also tried to wake the boy and carried him back to the front porch of his mother's house, but the young yogi remained in samadhi. When he regained partial outer consciousness, he returned to where he had been initiated.Lt. Gen. Hanut Singh, Shri Shri Shri Shivabalayogi Maharaj: Life & Spiritual Ministration, p. 26. Thomas L. Palotas, Tapas Shakti pp. 33-33. Bruce Young, \\"Guru-Disciple,\\" p 39.  Tapas  Sathyaraju became known as Adivarapupeta Balayogi, the boy yogi of Adivarapupeta. Many of the villagers believed he was acting, probably to earn fame as a holy man (sadhu) and make money. Some abused the boy, hitting him, pouring sugar water over his body so ants would bite him, and even throwing a burning, gasoline-soaked rag on him.Thomas L. Palotas, Divine Play pp. 38-39. Details of Shivabalayogi's tapas, including his own account and those of eyewitnesses can be found at Thomas L. Palotas, Swamiji's Treasure pp. 39-75. See also Bruce Young, \\"Guru- Disciple,\\" pp. 51-53. The Balayogi was in samadhi twenty-three hours a day.Bruce Young, \\"Guru-Disciple,\\" p. 51. In samadhi, Shivabalayogi later explained, there is no awareness of the body or its physical surroundings. Each midnight he would return to ordinary consciousness and would then feel the pain that his body was suffering.Bruce Young, \\"Guru-Disciple,\\" pp. 51-52. The Balayogi moved the place of his meditation to a field where the villagers buried children who died while very young.Lt. Gen. Hanut Singh, Shri Shri Shri Shivabalayogi Maharaj: Life & Spiritual Ministration, pp. 39-40. It was a place the villagers feared at night, so they mostly left the boy alone.Lt. Gen. Hanut Singh, Shri Shri Shri Shivabalayogi Maharaj: Life & Spiritual Ministration, p. 39. There his body suffered from insect, rodent and cobra bites, and the skin on his legs began to rot during the rainy season.Lt. Gen. Hanut Singh, Shri Shri Shri Shivabalayogi Maharaj: Life & Spiritual Ministration, pp. 40-41. His body became stiff from the constant meditation until, as Shivabalayogi described, the yogi who had initiated him into tapas, his divine guru, cured all but his hands.Thomas L. Palotas, Divine Play, p. 51. Bruce Young, \\"Guru-Disciple,\\" p. 59. They always remained partly frozen in the way he clasped them during meditation. For eight years, the Balayogi meditated twenty-three hours every day.Bruce Young, \\"Guru-Disciple,\\" pp. 59. In that time, he mastered meditation in all four cardinal directions (east, north, west and south).Lt. Gen. Hanut Singh, Shri Shri Shri Shivabalayogi Maharaj: Life & Spiritual Ministration, pp. 55-56. Then his divine guru instructed him to meditate twelve hours a day for another four years to complete a full twelve-year cycle.Thomas L. Palotas, Divine Play, pp. 62-65. Bruce Young, \\"Guru-Disciple,\\" p. 66. Through this process, he achieved nirvikalpa samadhi which is described as follows: > \\"Thus with all doubts and thoughts extinguished, His mind now absorbed back > completely into that Self from whence it had originated, He rested now in > that complete Peace beyond all experiences, from which he would no longer go > out.\\"Bruce Young, \\"Guru-Disciple,\\" pp. 66. Shivabalayogi defined tapas as continuously meditating for at least twelve hours each day until one attains God realization. \\"If the duration of meditation increases to about twelve hours then it becomes tapas. Tapas begins when you get into the state of samadhi. One has to do a minimum of twelve hours of tapas a day... When this samadhi stays for an extended period, something like twenty-four hours a day, then God will come down and awaken you.\\"Thomas L. Palotas, Tapas Shakti pp. 272-273. The final realization occurs with Sahaja Samadhi when the Yogi becomes naturally established in the Self (Atman) and sees the world and all in it as different forms assumed by the one Atman.Lt. Gen. Hanut Singh, Shri Shri Shri Shivabalayogi Maharaj: Life & Spiritual Ministration, pp. 158. Shivabalayogi has clarified that it is the same Atman that manifests either as pure Atman, or appears in the form of the 'Ishta Deva' [God].Lt. Gen. Hanut Singh, Shri Shri Shri Shivabalayogi Maharaj: Life & Spiritual Ministration, pp. 62. Shivabalayogi emerged from his unusually intense tapas on August 7, 1961, before a crowd of tens of thousands. Using a microphone and amplifier, the young yogi spoke to the crowd and that first public message was broadcast over radio, then printed and circulated on flyers. In his message, he emphasized the importance of proceeding directly to the goal of spirituality, the supreme peace of Self- realization, and eschewing the temptations and intermediate visions along the way which create more ego and may be nothing but hallucinations of the mind.Lt. Gen. Hanut Singh, Shri Shri Shri Shivabalayogi Maharaj: Life & Spiritual Ministration, pp. 59-60.  Meditation: silent teaching  From 1963 to 1987, Shivabalayogi traveled extensively throughout India, then Sri Lanka. From 1987 to 1991, he traveled to the U.K., U.S.A., and Italy.Thomas L. Palotas, Divine Play, pp. 189-190.Shivabalayogi Maharaj travels in the West. and Bruce Young, \\"Guru-Disciple,\\" pp. 204-206. Everywhere he gave public programs consisting of initiation into meditation (dhyana diksha), giving darshan in samadhi, evoking bhava samadhi (sometimes referred to as spiritual ecstasy), particularly during bhajans (kirtan, spiritual music), and distributing vibhuti and prasad as a form of blessing. He taught in silence through the power of his mere presence.Thomas L. Palotas, Tapas Shakti, pp.208-209. He valued knowledge through direct experience far more than words. On one occasion, Shivabalayogi encapsulated his entire teaching in a simple phrase, \\"Do sadhana.\\"Bruce Young, \\"Guru-Disciple,\\" pp. 177. Shivabalayogi Maharaj encouraged people to meditate for one hour each day. His message was often summarized with the following words: \\"Know truth through meditation, then you yourself will know who you are, your religion, your purpose in life, and your nature. Do not believe what others say and become a slave to religious prejudices. Meditation is your religion. Meditation is your purpose. Meditation is your path.\\"Thomas L. Palotas,Divine Play, p. 280. Swamiji emphasized that it is not simply by closing one's eyes that one meditates ‚Äì the mind has to become quiet. On one occasion, he advised Srinivasa Dikshitar \\"If you surrender mentally to your Guru through service, then automatically your mind gets controlled.\\"Bruce Young, \\"Guru-Disciple,\\" pp. 165. Later when the same disciple translated to another devotee the word \\"sadhana\\" (spiritual practice) as meditation, Shri Shivabalayogi corrected him: > \\"When I said 'sadhana', why are you using the word 'meditation'? \\"Meditation > means that a person will be sitting and closing the eyes. But sadhana can > happen through dhyana (meditation), through bhakti (devotion) and through > seva (service) and in so many ways when one is able to surrender to the > Guru.\\"Bruce Young, \\"Guru-Disciple,\\" pp. 165, 167. The dhyana meditation technique taught by Shri Shivabalayogi is as follows: > Sit, closing the eyes. > Concentrate the mind and sight in between eyebrows. > Do not move your eyeballs or eyelids. > Keep watching there by focusing the attention. > Do not repeat any mantra or name. > Do not imagine anything. > Do not open eyes until the duration of meditation is over.Meditation > technique on www.shivarudrabalayogi.com On other occasions Shivabalayogi did refer to Mantra practices, for example he spoke of hearing the Omkara, the divine sound of Om pervading the universe. He also referred to his use of a Mantra of the sun. The idea was that the whole process would happen spontaneously in the presence of the Guru, and with his blessing. He describes how the crowning accomplishment at the end of tapas was the vision and realisation of the divine form.  Spiritual philosophy: the Yoga Vasistha  When devotees inquired about Shri Shivabalayogi's spiritual philosophy, Swamiji referred them to the Yoga Vasistha. \\"Read the Yoga Vasistha,\\" he would say, \\"Swamiji‚Äôs philosophy is fully expounded in that scripture.\\"Lt. Gen. Hanut Singh, Shri Shri Shri Shivabalayogi Maharaj: Life & Spiritual Ministration, p. 98. The Yoga Vasistha is a dialogue between Sage Vasistha and Sri Rama, in which Vasistha explains that time and space, indeed all visions and thoughts of the mind are, ultimately seen, simply illusions. The pure consciousness of the Self (Cit-Akasha, the space of Consciousness) is the only reality, eternal, all-pervading and existing in itself. To escape illusion and experience this One reality, the mind must be brought into a state of perfect control and freedom from distracting thoughts (samadhi). All that remains is the experience of Supreme Peace, with the potency of all creation. Swamiji described it as follows: > \\"He (meaning the jangama devara) asked me to keep watching in between the > eyebrows, so I just went on watching. I saw all the things happening: then > all the happenings stopped. Suddenly I realized that my attention was on > 'That' which was making it happen. Then the attention settled on 'That' > which was watching. Boundless Supreme Peace was there. Amazing happiness was > there. It was so 'tasty' that one wouldn't ever want to be away from > that.\\"Bruce Young, Guru-Disciple, p. 179. Shri Shivabalayogi's approach is consistent with the Vedanta tradition, and the Yoga Vasistha is considered to be a principal exposition of the advaita vedanta philosophy (of non-dualism). Swamiji taught that the purpose of life is to attain Self-realization, by performing sadhana (spiritual practice) and overcoming the illusions and imaginations of the mind. He also taught that meditation can be used to relieve tension and live a peaceful and stress-free life in the world.Benefits of meditation  Other aspects of Shivabalayogi's mission  Once he was asked, \\"What is Swamiji‚Äôs teaching?\\" He simply replied, \\"Dhyana. Vibhuti. Bhajan. Bhava samadhi.\\" (Meditation. Blessed ash. Spiritual music. Divine ecstasy.)Thomas L. Palotas, Divine Play p. 196. Dhyana. Vibhuti. Bhajan. Bhava samadhi. Swamiji explained that yogis use bhajans to awaken spiritual awareness and prepare students for meditation. Singing songs of devotion to God is an expression of the path of devotion (bhakti). Swamiji once said, \\"Yogi is love.\\"Thomas L. Palotas,Divine Play, p. 211-212. Transcription on www.shiva.org In the bhakti marga (devotional path), the spiritual seeker focuses their mind entirely on a particular deity or 'Ishta', which is their chosen object of devotion. Through this practice they lose the individual ego and gain a larger consciousness. This path is exemplified by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Mirabai and Shri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. \\"Bhava\\" denotes the mood of ecstasy and self-surrender which is induced by the maturing of devotion to one's 'Ishta.'Lt. Gen. Hanut Singh, Shri Shri Shri Shivabalayogi Maharaj: Life & Spiritual Ministration, p. 108. Addressing the understanding of true Bhava Samadhi, Shri Swamiji himself would say, everyone is in some sort of bhava of the guru because of their attachment to the guru. The mind's attachment and devotion is the true bhava.Bruce Young, \\"Guru- Disciple,\\" pp. 186. Only when the bhava has fully ripened does the sadhaka (spiritual seeker) experience \\"bhava samadhi.\\"Lt. Gen. Hanut Singh, Shri Shri Shri Shivabalayogi Maharaj: Life & Spiritual Ministration, pp. 109. For numerous personal experiences of bhava and bhava samadhi, see Thomas L. Palotas,Divine Play, pp. 83-91, and Thomas L. Palotas,Swamiji's Treasure, pp. 319-364. Spiritually mature sadhakas will usually not exhibit any outward signs which may be indicative of the depth of their experiences.Lt. Gen. Hanut Singh, Shri Shri Shri Shivabalayogi Maharaj: Life & Spiritual Ministration, pp. 109-110. The outer playful expressions of Bhava that often occurred during bhajans, such as people getting up and dancing, were controversial throughout Shivabalayogi's public programs, and his own statements on the phenomenon appear inconsistent. However, he was intolerant of any public criticism or interference with devotees' bhava experiences.Thomas L. Palotas,Swamiji's Treasure, pp. 327-328. About bhava samadhi, Shri Shivabalayogi once said: > \\"During this all your bhava (the mind‚Äôs feelings) will get concentrated on > your favorite deity and thus your mind becomes more concentrated, more > single-pointed. Then meditation itself becomes much easier and consequently > one would take up meditation more willingly. \\"It's like giving chocolate to > a child to make it go to school. But one should not settle just for the > chocolate ‚Äì one must go on to school. In the same way, one must > meditate.\\"Bruce Young, \\"Guru-Disciple,\\" pp. 80. Shivabalayogi often used the expression the \\"path of devotion\\" (bhakti marga) to describe spiritual life. To some devotees he would say: > \\"You can win over anything with devotion. If God can be won over by > devotion, rest assured that anything can be won by devotion. You have to > come from devotion to practice meditation. Only then will you get Self > realization. You should begin meditation with devotion. Chanting and bhajans > are for devotion. They are the start for the spiritual path. Just like you > go for the first class in primary school. It‚Äôs like that. Prayer, bhajans, > homa, japa and all these things help you develop further and further on the > spiritual path. Gradually they will bring you into the line of > meditation.\\"Thomas L. Palotas, Divine Play, p. 87. When people asked for blessings and healing, Shivabalayogi typically gave them blessed vibhuti (ash), which symbolizes the formless Divine and is meant to encourage faith on the part of the devotee. Giving prasadam (blessed food) was also very important for him, and devotees often arranged for mass feedings of thousands of people. Shri Swamiji once explained the importance of mass feedings as follows: \\"Look if you eat at a restaurant then it is simply food. But when the food is offered to God it becomes prasadam. During mass feedings if someone contributes even a little food to the occasion, that person‚Äôs bhava (the feelings of the mind) will be purified with this thought, 'May my little contribution be helpful in the feeding of the poor and needy.'\\"Bruce Young, \\"Guru-Disciple,\\" pp. 81-82.  Book  The spiritual teachings of Sri Sivabala Yogi have been published in the book Laghu Guru Upanishad: Spiritual Teachings of Sri Sivabala Yogi.  Death  Shivabalayogi Light Body, April 2, 1994 Shri Shivabalayogi Maharaj passed on, or \\"entered Mahasamadhi\\", in Kakinada, India, on March 28, 1994.Thomas L. Palotas, Divine Play, p.267. Although it was not evident to onlookers, he had been on dialysis since 1991 and for some fifteen years he suffered from diabetes and an injured foot which became infected and never healed. Throughout this time he worked tirelessly to inspire people on the spiritual path. Shivabalayogi often told devotees that yogis do not \\"die\\" in the ordinary sense. They drop their physical bodies through mahasamadhi (the great samadhi), but their presence remains available. \\"If I am not within the bounds of my body I am more available to you\\",Thomas L. Palotas, Divine Play, p. 258. and he often gave Jesus as an example.Thomas L. Palotas, Tapas Shakti, pp. 371-375, and Thomas L. Palotas, Divine Play, p. 203. On April 2, 1994, his body was interred at the ashram in Adivarapupeta near the place where he sat for almost ten of his twelve-year tapas. That tomb is now the Adivarapupeta samadhi.Thomas L. Palotas, Divine Play, pp. 268-270.  Ashrams  During Shivabalayogi's three decades of travel, many properties were donated to him in India as ashrams to be held in trust for the public. The first ashram is in Adivarapupeta, his native village where he completed twelve years of tapas. That is the site of his samƒÅdhi, the tomb where his body is buried, and is a pilgrimage site for devotees particularly for Mahashivaratri, the annual great night of Shiva. In 1963, when Shivabalayogi began traveling in India, a small ashram was established for him in Doddaballapura, a small town north of Bangalore, then the following year in Bangalore on Bannerghatta Road. As he traveled, additional ashrams were established in Sambhar Lake, Dehradun, Hyderabad, Anantapur, Hindupur, and Agra. On August 7, 1977, he established a new ashram in Bangalore at J.P. Nagar, where he later consecrated a temple in honor of the three divine manifestations of God: Brahma and Saraswati the Creator, Vishnu and Lakshmi the Sustainer, and Shiva and Parvati the Destroyers of Illusion. According to one Indian tradition, the worship of Brahma is forbidden, yet Shivabalayogi insisted upon consecrating a deity of the god, thus encouraging people to go beyond blind faith and superstition and to teach that the Divine is only one, but with many names and forms.Bruce Young, \\"Guru-Disciple,\\" pp. 203-204 and The Brahma Vishnu Maheshwara Temple. Shri Shivabalayogi established charitable trusts in London, Portland, Oregon, and North Carolina. After his death, additional trusts and ashrams have been established in India, the United States, Canada, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and Australia.

It has dual tracks throughout the whole line, and the lines between Xuzhou, Jiangsu and Lanzhou, Gansu has been electrified. History The Longhai railway was built over the course of half a century by four different governments of China: the Qing Dynasty, Beiyang Government, Nationalist Republican government and the Communist government of the People's Republic. The first section of the railway, entirely within Henan, from Kaifeng to Luoyang was built from 1905 to 1909 by a venture between the Qing Dynasty and a Belgian joint-stock company backed by France and Russia. This line, known as the Bianliang‚ÄìLuoyang railway, began operation on January 1, 1910. Longhai railway bombarded during World War II. The line was extended eastward to Xuzhou in 1916 and to Haizhou in 1923 with Dutch financing. In the west, the line was extended to Lingbao, Henan in 1927 with Belgian financing. After the Northern Expedition, the Nanjing-based Republican government took control of construction and extended the line further west to Tongguan, Shaanxi in 1931, to Xi'an in 1934, to Baoji, Shaanxi in 1936 and Tianshui, Gansu in 1945. Construction of the Tianshui to Lanzhou section, entirely within Gansu, broke ground in May 1946 but was halted by Chinese Civil War, then resumed under the People's Republic in April 1950 and was completed in July 1953. At this time, the entire Longhai railway entered into operation. No. 8 Bridge on the Longhai railway rebuilt by the PLA Rail Corps in 1950. In the late 1950s through early 1960s, new railways were built from Lanzhou to the west: the Lanxin railway to Xinjiang (later connected to Kazakhstan) and the Lanqing railway to Qinghai (later extended to Tibet). From 1956 to 1970, the section between Zhengzhou, Henan to Baoji, Shaanxi was upgraded to the dual-track line. During the same time, in Henan the line near Sanmenxia was re-routed due to the Sanmenxia Reservoir Project. Zhengzhou to Shangqiu section was converted to dual-track in 1980. The railway is a central section in the New Eurasian Land Bridge.

The division was formed in 1939 and was disbanded in 1945. Its call sign was the . The 35th Division was activated at Tokyo 7 February 1939, simultaneously with 32nd, 33rd, 34th, 36th and 37th divisions. History The division was deployed to China in May 1939 to perform rear area security duties in the Second Sino- Japanese War. It initially operated in Shanxi and northern Henan. From some time in 1940 to March 1944 the 35th Division was stationed in the Kaifeng area of North China.Madej (1981), p. 63 The division was reorganised between 1 May 1943 from standard to garrison division, and this led to the artillery regiment and reconnaissance regiment being removed. The engineer and transport regiments were also downgraded to companies and the sanitation company was replaced by a field hospital. After reorganization, the division was assigned to the 12th army, and participated in the mop-up operations in the Taihang Mountains. In July 1943, it was reinforced by 54th infantry brigade from the 59th division. The 35th Division was selected for service in western New Guinea in early April 1944. The 219th Regiment was detached to garrison the St. Andrew Strait and sailed from Yokohama on 6 April 1944. The divisional headquarters also sailed with the 219th Regiment, but was to trans-ship at Palau and continue to New Guinea.Willoughby (1966), p. 258 The remainder of the division left Shanghai on 17 April 1944 in the Take Ichi convoy.Willoughby (1966), p. 258‚Äì259 The convoy was attacked by United States Navy submarines on 26 April 1944 and 6 May 1944, and was diverted to Halmahera in the Netherlands East Indies to prevent further attacks. Transports carrying elements of the division were sunk during the 6 May 1944 attack, and only four of the division's six infantry battalions which embarked in the convoy and a single artillery battery remained at the end of the voyage.Willoughby (1966), p. 273 The 35th Division was moved forward from Halmahera to Sorong in small ships during May 1944.Smith (1953), p. 233 The 219th regiment was also successfully transferred to New Guinea, though a battalion was left behind to garrison the St. Andrew Strait. Majority of 221st regiment was assigned to garrison Manokwari. Elements of the 35th Division subsequently fought in the Battle of Biak on 27 May 1944 (resulting in annihilation of Japanese garrison) and the Battle of Sansapor on 30 July 1944 on the Bird's Head Peninsula. As a result, the Japanese defenses at Manokwari were isolated as of September 1944.Smith (1953), p. 263, pp. 443-444 and p. 449. The Japanese forces retreated to a final defensive perimeter around Sorong in May 1945, where they thrived until the surrender of Japan on 15 August 1945, thanks to abundant local supplies of Sago-derived foodstuffs.

Approximately 3 km northeast of central Odense, towards Odense Fjord. It has around 10.000 inhabitants and is characterised by a modern housing development project from the 1970s. Since the 1990s, the area has become known throughout Denmark, because of the relatively large numbers of people of foreign descent living in the area. Its many social issues cause it to be officially classified as a ghetto by Danish authorities. Other areas in Denmark with similar characteristics are Gellerup Parken in Aarhus and Mj√∏lnerparken in Copenhagen. Etymology According to a markbog (listing and map of the area's fields) of 1682, the spelling used then was Woldsmose. The latter part of the name is Danish mose (bog or swamp). The first part is probably vold (Old Norse v«´llr), an obsolete word meaning a grass-covered area or plain. Before being developed, the area was low and marshy. Another possibility is the identical word vold meaning rampart (from Low German wal and Latin vallum), but there are no traces of such a fortification in the area. On maps from the 18th century the name Wolfs Mose occurs (literally, 'bog of wolves'). These maps wore often edited by foreign cartographers and have many erratic German-influenced spelling forms. =Jocular meaning= A third identical word vold simply means violence in Danish (a common Germanic word, same as Old English geweald, German Gewalt). As the forms Vollsmose and Voldsmose would be pronounced in the same way in Danish, the name is easy to joke about or associate to violence. This is, however, no joke, as the official name in 1999 according to the Royal Library's registration was Danmark, Fyn, Voldsmose. Vollmose has had much media focus and political attention regarding crime, unemployment and immigration problems in recent years. =Spelling discussion= According to some, the original spelling of the name was Voldsmose, however, when the city of Odense planned to build up the area from around 1964, the prestigious project plan was presented with the spelling Vollsmose. As of today, the Danish Placename Board lists the approved form Vollsmose. In a piece apparently from Fyens Stiftstidende in 1999, it is claimed that the original name of the place was Voldsmose. This would allegedly still have been the officially approved spelling by 1999, but Vollsmose would have been a corrupt spelling introduced by the city of Odense since 1964 and commonly used since then.Kent Kristensen: Det er med \\"d\\" : Om bydelens oprindelige stavem√•de, 10 November 1999, quoted in a collection of Vollsmose newspaper articles from IndvandreNet, an umbrella organisation of immigrants in Denmark Description Vollsmose has relatively large areas of recreational nature, grassy areas, small hills, trees and bushes, marsh areas, ponds and along Odense √Ö. On all four sides of the \\"Firkanten\\" (\\"four sides\\") there are two-laned roads. One side will in 2014 become used more, when a new bridge over the Odense Canal will open. At Fyrreparken (one of the nine \\"parks\\" and \\"gardens\\" or divisions) there is an earlier peat bog, which has been dug out in such a way, that one can walk down the spiral along the walls of the hole to the bottom. There are six parks: Birkeparken (the Birchpark), B√∏geparken (the Beechpark), Egeparken (the Oakpark), Fyrreparken (the Pinepark), Granparken (the Sprucepark) and L√¶rkeparken (the Larchpark), and three \\"gardens\\"; Tj√∏rnehaven (the Hawthorn garden), Sl√•enhaven (the Sloe bush garden) and Hybenhaven (the Dog Rose garden). While the area's \\"parks\\" are made up of multi-storied apartment blocks of varying heights up to 13 stories, the three \\"gardens\\" are 1‚Äì2-storied rows of housing units. B√∏geparken is the largest park with about 450 apartments and 1,600 occupants. In all there are 3,500 apartments in Vollsmose, which are owned by three of Odenses housing organisations, H√∏jstrup Boligforening, Odense Andels Boligforening and Fyns Almennyttige Boligselskab. There are around 10.000 inhabitants in Vollsmose. About 70% of the inhabitants are immigrants or children of immigrants, and nearly all the students at the two schools in the area, Abildg√•rdskole and H. C. Andersen Skole, have parents with immigrant backgrounds. There are almost 80 nationalities. The largest groups come from Libanon, Somalia, Iraq and Turkey, coming as migrant workers in the 1960s and 1970s or as political- or war-refugees. There are many Muslims in Vollsmose, and there is a mosque in Birkeparken. People make do with other rooms. Vollsmose's residents are, on average, younger than in Odense. Over half are under 25 years of age. The average income in 2012 was 175,000 DKK, which is dramatically less than the average in Odense (262,000 DKK). There is a high rate of unemployment in Vollsmose compared to the rest of Odense. In the area there is the architecturally modern Vollsmose Kirke (Vollsmose Church) built in 1975 and two public schools. A third was recently closed. There are also twelve children's institutions, a high school and shopping centre with a good library and meeting centre, and a public swimming pool. Beside the centre is a newly opened centre for youth education. There is a large playground with chickens, rabbits and sheep called B√∏rnebyen (The Children's Town). Vollsmose has a local police station, which no other suburb in Odense has. History The erection of Vollsmose began in the 1960 and was originally a prestige project for the public service sector, which today is reflected in the high quality of the construction. Vollsmose was pictured to the citizens of Odense by the prospect of good apartments, which low income families could afford. Construction of ordinary houses also began to boom. Construction along √Össumvej was finished in the beginning of the 1970s. Construction along Vollsmose All√© was finished in 1982. In 2006 the suburb made headlines on national newspapers when seven individuals living there were arrested and charged for planning allegedly terrorist actions . In 2007 the suburb got its first candidate to national elections, when the former residents association chairperson and public figure from B√∏geparken, Asmaa Abdol-Hamid, stood for the leftist Enhedlisten.Feminist, socialist, devout Muslim: woman who has thrown Denmark into turmoil, Guardian, 16 May 2007 In 2010 an ethnic conflict broke out in the area, where according to police Somali and Palestinians would attack ethnic Danes or set fire to their parked cars. The suburb is classified by the government as an \\"especially vulnerable public housing area\\". In the December 1, 2018 edition of ghettolisten, the Gardens and the Parks are treated separately, with the former being classified \\"merely\\" as a \\"vulnerable residential area\\" (udsat boligomr√•de), whereas the latter continued to be classified a \\"hard ghetto\\". People want to see the area's bad reputation turned to positive. This is hopefully underway as a result of the Odense municipality's massive investment in the area, with reconstruction of the physical framework and social projects with residential participation since 2001. This is known as Odense municipality's special Vollsmose efforts or Helhedsplanen, \\"the holistic plan\\". Initiatives In 2000 the Odense town council passed a Helhedsplan for the area, in order to mend the basic problem areas, and in 2001, together with the Social Ministry, began a so-called quarter-lift-project in Vollsmose. One part of the plan was that the municipality implement the Vollsmosesekretariat, the first group of employed people to oversee operations. The Odense municipality has placed its grants and payments centre and a health centre in Egeparken. The health centre is run in cooperation with Professor Morten Sodemann's immigrant-medical clinic at Odense Universitetshospital. Media Vollsmose has a tradition of having its own media. Earlier, each park had their own little paper. With the Helhedsplan, the suburb has gotten its own local paper, Vollsmose Avisen. As of August 2010 , the editor of Vollsmose Avisen is Thomas Juhl Bruun. The paper comes out every other week and is delivered to the residents, in Vollsmose and in areas not too far away from the place. Vollsmose also has its own homepage, www.vollsmose.dk, which includes a net.tv section. Vollsmose Avisen and vollsmose.dk, as well as Vollsmose Net.tv, all come under Medierhus (Mediahouse) Vollsmose, which is a project under the Helhedsplan. The Medierhus lies in the Vollsmose Kulturhus (Culturehouse, meeting centre), which lies over Vollsmose Bibliotek (Library) in the Vollsmose Torve (marketplace (shopping centre)). All three media departments use residents as journalists, who voluntarily produce both articles for the homepage and the paper as well as for the net-TV. The leader of the Medierhus was Benthe Vesterg√•rd, who was also the public relations officer for Vollsmose, but who has the job right now is unknown, as the next round of the Helhedsplan is just beginning (July 2012), with new staff and new plans, but which again this time will be called Vollsmosesekretariatet.

The center of worship is located in the city of Candelaria in Tenerife. She is depicted as a Black Madonna. The \\"Royal Basilica Marian Shrine of Our Lady of Candelaria\\" (Basilica of Candelaria) is considered the main church dedicated to the Virgin Mary in the Canary Islands and she is the patron saint of the Canary Islands. Her feast is celebrated on February 2 (Fiesta de la Candelaria) and August 15, the patronal feast of the Canary Islands. She is also the patroness of the Western Visayas region enshrined in Jaro Cathedral or the National Shrine of Our Lady of the Candles under the Archdiocese of Jaro (with feast day every 2 February) in the Philippines, and Tatala, one of the barangays in Binangonan, Rizal (also in the Philippines), which celebrates her feast day every February 2. The Municipality of Silang in the province of Cavite, Philippines, also celebrates her feast day from February 1 to 3, with February 2 the main feast day. Legend and appearance According to a legend recorded by Alonso de Espinosa in 1594, a statue of the Virgin Mary, bearing a child in one hand and a green candle in the other (hence \\"Candelaria\\"), was discovered on the beach of Chimisay (G√º√≠mar) by two Guanche goatherds in 1392. This was before the Castilian conquest of the island of Tenerife (the island was not fully conquered until 1496). One of the shepherds tried to throw a stone at the statue, but his arm became paralysed; the other tried to stab the statue with a knife but ended up stabbing himself. The statue was taken by the local guanche mencey to the cueva de Chinguaro. Later, Ant√≥n, a Guanche who had been enslaved and converted to Christianity by the Castilians, returned to Tenerife and recognized the statue as that of the Virgin Mary. He told the mencey of his conversion and the statue was thus venerated by the Guanches, who moved it to the cave of Achbinico (also known as San Blas - \\"Saint Blaise\\"). However, the statue was stolen and taken away to Lanzarote. It was later returned to Tenerife after various events, including an outbreak of the plague, occurred on Lanzarote. At first, the autochthons identified the statue with their goddess Chaxiraxi (the mother of the gods), but later the Christian conquerors imposed the idea that the statue was that of the Virgin Mary. After the appearance of the Virgin and its iconographic identification with this biblical event, the festival began to be celebrated with a Marian character in the year 1497, when the conqueror Alonso Fern√°ndez de Lugo, celebrated the first Candlemas festival dedicated especially to the Virgin Mary, coinciding with the Feast of Purification, on February 2.Medio siglo de fervor en CandelariaHistoria de la Virgen de Candelaria, en p√°gina de turismo de Tenerife Before the conquest of Tenerife, the Guanche aborigines celebrated a festivity around the image of the Virgin during the Be√±esmen festival in the month of August. This was the harvest party, which marked the beginning of the year. Currently, the feast of the Virgin of Candelaria in Canary Islands is celebrated in addition to February 2 also on August 15, the day of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary in the Catholic calendar. For some historians, the celebrations celebrated in honor of the Virgin during the month of August are a syncretized reminiscence of the ancient feasts of the Be√±esmen. The original statue was a medieval gothic sculpture with dark colour and clothing similar to that of the Virgin of Lluch (patron saint of Mallorca) and the Virgin of Montserrat (patron saint of Catalonia). Veneration Eighteenth- century painting depicting the apparition of the Virgin to the Guanches. Ceramic mosaic depicting the Virgin of Candelaria of Tenerife found in the Basilica of the Annunciation in Nazareth (Israel). The first mass was celebrated at Achbinico on February 2, 1497, and the Adelantado Alonso Fern√°ndez de Lugo ordered the construction of a hermitage there, but it was not built until 1526, during the rule of Pedro Fern√°ndez de Lugo. This was the site of the Basilica of Our Lady of Candelaria. The basilica was destroyed by fire and rebuilt in the 19th century. The statue itself was lost when a tsunami carried it out to sea in 1826; the present statue is a copy by Fernando Est√©vez. The statue of the Virgin is dressed in rich robes of different colors and jewels. She was declared patroness of the Canary Islands in 1559, by Clement VIII (and principal patroness in 1867 by Pope Pius IX). The Virgin of Candelaria is widely petitioned to pray for the protection against epidemics, plagues, droughts and volcanic eruptions of Mount Teide and other volcanoes, in a manner similar to the invocation of St. Januarius of Naples to pray for the end of the eruptions of Vesuvius and of St. Agatha of Catania against eruptions of Mount Etna in Sicily. Between October 1964 and January 1965, the Diocese of Tenerife conducted the largest pilgrimage in the history of the Canary Islands. This time, the statue of the Virgin was walked across the towns, cities and municipalities of the island of Tenerife for the first time in history. In the basilica of the Annunciation in Nazareth (Israel) is a mosaic of the Virgin of Candelaria, patron saint of the Canary Islands, along with those of other Marian devotions famous in Spain.La patrona extreme√±a ser√° entronizada en la bas√≠lica de la Anunciaci√≥n (\\"The Extremaduran patron will be installed in the basilica of the Annunciation\\"). 26/02/2012, in elperiodicoextremadura.com. Every year on February 2 and August 15 is celebrated a big party in honor of the Virgin. These days there are thousands of pilgrims and tourists coming to Candelaria from all points of the Canary Islands and other parts of Spain and the world. The feast day is marked by a solemn procession and a religious ceremony, although its most famous component is a re-enactment of the discovery of the statue, with locals dressing up as guanche natives. In addition to that, every seven years the image of the Virgin of Candelaria is transferred for two weeks to the cities of Santa Cruz de Tenerife (capital of the island) and San Crist√≥bal de La Laguna (seat of the Diocese of Tenerife) alternating every seven years between the two cites: in 2002 it was Santa Cruz and in 2009 La Laguna and so to successively. Shrines Basilica of Candelaria (Tenerife) =Basilica of Candelaria and Cueva de Achbinico= The first great Sanctuary to the Virgin of Candelaria was constructed in 1668. After a fire destroyed the ancient basilica, a larger church (the current basilica) was built. The current basilica dates to 1959 and it was constructed on a former hermitage, and can hold 5,000 people. The Cave of San Blas was the first Christian church of the Canaries. It was here the early inhabitants of the Canary Isles first revered the Virgin of Candelaria. The cave is located behind Candelaria's Basilica and is a site of pilgrimage. Achbinico's cave has historical significance as it was here that many baptisms of guanches took place. =National Shrine of Our Lady of Candles (Jaro Cathedral)= The Jaro Cathedral (National Shrine of Our Lady of the Candles) The Jaro Cathedral (National Shrine of Our Lady of Candles) in Jaro, Iloilo City, Philippines, which is the mother church and is under the catholic Archdiocese of Jaro that oversees the provinces of Iloilo, Antique, Guimaras and Negros Occidental in Western Visayas region, is solely dedicated to the Virgin of Candelaria, the patroness of the whole Western Visayas region, Romblon, and Negros Occidental. The feast of Candelaria held every February 2 is one of the largest Roman Catholic feasts dedicated to Marian devotion in the Philippines. The cathedral was built in her honor during the Spanish colonial times in the Philippines. It was declared a National Shrine of the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines (the only Marian shrine in Visayas). =Virgen de Candelaria Chapel (Tatala Chapel)= This is the only chapel in Binangonan, Rizal, that venerates the image of Virgen de Candelaria. Its feast day is celebrated every February 2 with the blessing of the candles and a Solemn Mass. After the Mass, there is a traditional Pandanggo or Prusisyong Karakol in honor of the Virgen de Candelaria de Tatala. =Our Lady of Candelaria Parish Church (Silang, Cavite)= Our Lady of Candelaria Parish Church (Silang) was founded in 1595 and dedicated in honor to Our Lady of Candelaria in 1640. Also commonly known as the Silang Church, it is a Roman Catholic parish in the municipality of Silang, Cavite, in the Philippines under the Roman Catholic Diocese of Imus. It is known for its Spanish colonial architectural style and the rococo influenced retablos. The Church with its retablos was declared as a National Cultural Treasure by the National Museum of the Philippines on 4 February 2011. Strange letters on the original carving of the Virgin In the carved drapery of the Virgin of Candelaria original there were some strange letters whose meaning is still unknown. These were: *Girdle in the neck: ETIEPESEPMERI *On the left sleeve: LPVRINENIPEPNEIFANT *At the bottom of the robe: EAFM IPNINI FMEAREI *In the belt: NARMPRLMOTARE *In the mantle, in the right arm: OLM INRANFR TAEBNPEM Reven NVINAPIMLIFINIPI NIPIAN *At the edge of the left hand: EVPMIRNA ENVPMTI EPNMPIR VRVIVINRN APVI MERI PIVNIAN NTRHN *On the back in the queue: NBIMEI ANNEIPERFMIVIFVE In the Americas and Philippines The cult of the Virgin of Candelaria swept America due to the emigration of Canaries. They brought the devotion as a symbol of their culture, somewhat similar to the diffusion of the cult of St. Patrick by Irish emigrants. On the other hand, the Candelaria image brought to the Philippines has a white image with a child. She is widely venerated in South America and the Caribbean, where she is the patroness of Oruro and La Paz (Bolivia), Medell√≠n (Colombia) (which was founded as Villa de Nuestra Se√±ora de La Candelaria de Medell√≠n), Mayag√ºez (Puerto Rico) (which was founded as Nuestra Se√±ora de la Candelaria de Mayag√ºez), and Manat√≠ (Puerto Rico) (which was founded as Iglesia de Nuestra Se√±ora de la Candelaria y San Mat√≠as). In the Cathedral of San Fernando of Texas (the oldest Catholic cathedral in the United States) is a replica of the Virgin of Candelaria, which is a facsimile of that venerated in the Canary Islands. This is because the city of San Antonio was founded by Canarians. In the Philippines, she is the patroness of Western Visayas and Negros Occidental, and a white version with a child is found in the Jaro Cathedral in Iloilo: it is either of local heavenly origin since its discovery was miraculous being found floating in a river, changing in weight and growing in size or it may be brought by the Spanish immigrants during Spanish colonial rule in the Philippines. Her feast is celebrated every February 2 with pageantry where the Fiesta queen is chosen from prominent Spanish-Filipino families in the district of Jaro. The image and statue is located atop the cathedral and is the only Marian statue crowned by pope and saint in the Philippines, during the visit of Pope John Paul II. The first church of Dilao (now the District of Paco in Manila) was initially dedicated to the Virgen de Candelaria, until its Parish was named to San Fernando. Until now, the Virgin is considered the secondary patroness and attributions are manifested throughout the post war church structure. Syncretism The Virgin of Candelaria is identified or syncretized with other holy entities from other religions: *In Guanche mythology, the Virgin of Candelaria was identified as Chaxiraxi, and her son Chijoraji. *In Cuban Santer√≠a, the Virgin of Candelaria is identified with Oy√° as well as Oba. *In Brazilian Candombl√©, the Virgin of Candelaria is identified with Oshun. *For Andean religions, this dedication is linked to the cult to the Pachamama (Mother Earth). *The Hindu community of the Canary Islands identifies it with the goddess Durga and with Kali.

Psychosis implies the presence of manic symptoms, stupor or catatonia, perplexity, confusion, disorders of the will and self, delusions and/ or hallucinations.

This is a changing clinical state, with transient delusions, fragments of other syndromes, extreme fear or ecstasy, perplexity, confusion and motility disturbances. In the past some experts regarded this as pathognomonic (specific) for puerperal psychosis, but this syndrome is found in other settings, not just the reproductive process, and in men. These psychoses are placed in the World Health Organization‚Äôs ICD-10 under the rubric of acute and transient psychotic disorders. World Health Organization (1992) The ICD-10 Classification of Mental and Behavioural Disorders: Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Guidelines, Geneva, World Health Organization, pages 101-102. In general psychiatry, manic and cycloid syndromes are regarded as distinct, but, studied long-term among childbearing women, the bipolar and cycloid variants are intermingled in a bewildering variety of combinations, and, in this context, it seems best to regard them as members of the same ‚Äòbipolar/cycloid‚Äô group. Together the manic and cycloid variants make up about two thirds of childbearing psychoses. name=\\"Cambridge 2017, p177.\\" =Diagnosis= Postpartum bipolar disorders must be distinguished from a long list of organic psychoses that can present in the puerperium, and from other non-organic psychoses; both of these groups are described below. It is also necessary to distinguish them from other psychiatric disorders associated with childbirth, such as anxiety disorders, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, complaining disorders and bonding disorders (emotional rejection of the infant), which occasionally cause diagnostic difficulties. Clinical assessment requires obtaining the history from the mother herself and, because she is often severely ill, lacking in insight and unable to give a clear account of events, from at least one close relative. A social work report and, in mothers admitted to hospital, nursing observations are information sources of great value. A physical examination and laboratory investigations may disclose somatic illness complicating the obstetric events, which sometimes provokes psychosis. It is important to obtain the case records of previous episodes of mental illness, and, in patients with multiple episodes, to construct a summary of the whole course of her psychiatric history in relation to her life. In the 10th edition of the International Classification of Diseases, published in 1992, the recommendation is to classify these cases by the form of the illness, without highlighting the postpartum state. There is, however, a category F53.1, entitled 'severe mental and behavioural disorders associated with the puerperium', which can be used when it is not possible to diagnose some variety of affective disorder or schizophrenia. The American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, whose 5th edition was published in May 2013, allows the use of a 'peripartum onset specifier' in episodes of mania, hypomania or major depression if the symptoms occur during pregnancy or the first four weeks of the puerperium. The failure to recognize postpartum psychosis, and its complexity, is unhelpful to clinicians, epidemiologists, and other researchers. name=\\"Cambridge 2017, p166.\\" =Onset groups= Postpartum bipolar disease belongs to the bipolar spectrum, whose disorders exist in two contrasting forms ‚Äì mania and depression. They are highly heritable Bertelsen A, Harvald B, Hauge M (1977) A Danish twin study of manic-depressive disorders. British Journal of Psychiatry 130: 330-351., and sufferers (rather less than 1% of the population Ferrari A J, Stockings E, Khoo J P, Erskine H E, Degenhardt L, Vos T, Whiteford H A (2016) The prevalence and burden of bipolar disorder: findings from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013. Bipolar Disorders 18: 440-450.) have a lifelong tendency (diathesis) to develop psychotic episodes in certain circumstances. The ‚Äòtriggers‚Äô include a number of pharmaceutical agents, surgical operations, adrenal corticosteroids, seasonal changes, menstruation and childbearing. Research into puerperal mania is, therefore, not the study of a ‚Äòdisease-in- its-own right‚Äô, but an investigation into the childbearing triggers of bipolar disorder. Psychoses triggered in the first two weeks after the birth - between the first postpartum day (or even during parturition name=\\"Cambridge 2017, p115-116\\". until about the 15th day ‚Äì complicate approximately 1/1,000 pregnancies Kendell R E, Chalmers J C, Platz C (1987) Epidemiology of puerperal psychoses. British Journal of Psychiatry 150: 662-673. . The impression is sometimes given that this is the only trigger associated with childbearing. But there is evidence of four other triggers ‚Äì late postpartum name=\\"Cambridge 2017, p200-204.\\" , prepartum name=\\"Cambridge 2017, p190-195.\\" , post-abortion name=\\"Cambridge 2017, p184-190.\\" and weaning name=\\"Cambridge 2017, p204-206.\\" . Marc√©, widely considered an authority on puerperal psychoses Marc√© L V (1858) Trait√© de la Folie des Femmes Enceintes, des Nouvelles Accouch√©es et des Nourrices, et Consid√©rations M√©dico-l√©gales qui se rattachent √† ce sujet. Paris, Bailli√®re., claimed that they could be divided into early and late forms; the late form begins about six weeks after childbirth, associated with the return of the menses Marc√© L V (1862) Trait√© Pratique des Maladies Mentales, Paris, Bailli√®re, pages 143-147.. His view is supported by the large number of cases in the literature with onset 4-13 weeks after the birth, mothers with serial 4-13 week onsets and some survey evidence Munk-Olsen T, Lauren T M, Petersen C B, Mors O, Mortensen P B (2006) New parents and mental disorders: a population-based study. Journal of the American Medical Association 296: 2582-2589.. The evidence for a trigger acting in pregnancy is also based on the large number of reported cases, and particularly on the frequency of mothers suffering two or more prepartum episodes. There is evidence, especially from surveys Reardon D C, Cougle J R, Rue V M, Shuping M W, Coleman P K, Ney P G (2003) Psychiatric admissions of low-income women following abortion and childbirth. Canadian Medical Association Journal 168: 1253-1256., of bipolar episodes triggered by abortion (miscarriage or termination). The evidence for a weaning trigger rests on 32 cases in the literature, of which 14 were recurrent. The relative frequency of these five triggers is given by the number of cases in the literature ‚Äì just over half early postpartum onset, 20% each late postpartum and prepartum onset, and the rest post-abortion and weaning onset. In addition, episodes starting after childbirth may be triggered by adrenal corticosteroids, surgical operations (such as Caesarean section) or bromocriptine as an alternative to, or in addition to, the postpartum trigger Brockington I F (2017) Non-reproductive triggers of postpartum psychosis. Archives of Women's Mental Health 20: 55-59. . =Course of the illness= With modern treatment, a full recovery can be expected within 6-10 weeks Bergink V (2013) First-onset postpartum psychosis. Thesis, Rotterdam. This is called 'Bergink 2013' in the references. name=\\"Cambridge 2017, p214.\\" . After recovery from the psychosis, some mothers suffer from depression, which can last for weeks or months. About one third suffer a relapse, with a return of psychotic symptoms a few weeks after recovery; these relapses are not due to a failure to comply with medication, because they were often described Delay J, Boitelle G, Corteel A (1948).

Many of these mothers suffer from other bipolar episodes, on the average about one every six years. Although suicide is almost unknown in an acute puerperal manic or cycloid episode, depressive episodes later in life carry an increased risk Sch√∂pf J (1992) Postpartum-Psychosen: Beitrag zur Nosologie. Thesis, Z√ºrich. Klompenhouwer J L (1992) Puerperal psychosis. Thesis, Rotterdam., and it is wise for mothers to maintain contact with psychiatric services in the long term. In the event of a further pregnancy, the recurrence rate is high - in the largest series, about three quarters suffered a recurrence, but not always in the early puerperium; the recurrence could occur during pregnancy, or later in the postpartum period name=\\"Cambridge 2017, p214-5.\\" . This suggests a link between early onset and other onset groups. =Management, treatment and prevention= Pre-conception counselling It is known that women with a personal or family history Jones I, Craddock N (2001) Familiarity of the puerperal trigger in bipolar disorder: results of a family study.

The highest risk of all (82%) is a combination of a previous postpartum episode and at least one earlier non- puerperal episode name=\\"Cambridge 2017, p274.\\" . There is a need to counsel women at high risk before they embark on pregnancy, especially those on prophylactic treatment. The issues include the teratogenic risk, the frequency of recurrence and the risks and benefit of various treatments during pregnancy and breast-feeding; a personal analysis should be made for each individual Jones I, Chandra P S, Dazzan P, Howard L M (2014) Bipolar disorder, affective psychosis, and schizophrenia in pregnancy and the post-partum period. Lancet 384: 1789-1799. , and is best shared with close family members.

Stopping mood-stabilisers has a high risk of recurrence during pregnancy Viguera A C, Whitfield T, Baldessarini R J, Newport D J, Stowe Z, Reminick A, Zurick A, Cohen L S (2007) Risk of recurrence of women with bipolar disorder during pregnancy: a prospective study of mood stabilizer discontinuation. American Journal of Psychiatry 164: 1817-1824. . Pre-birth planning If a mother at high risk becomes pregnant, it is essential to convene a planning meeting. This is urgent because the diagnosis of pregnancy may be late, and the birth may be premature. The meeting should be attended by primary care, obstetric and psychiatric staff, together (if possible) with the expectant mother and her family and (if appropriate) a social worker. There are many issues ‚Äì pharmaceutical treatment, antenatal care, early signs of a recurrence, the management of the puerperium, and the care and safety of the infant. It is important that the psychiatric team is notified as soon as the infant is born. Home treatment and hospitalization It has been recognized since the 19th century Godding W W (1874) Puerperal insanity. Boston Medical & Surgical Journal 10: 317-319. that it is optimal for a mother with puerperal psychosis to be treated at home, where she can maintain her role as homemaker and mother to her other children, and develop her relationship with the new-born. But there are many risks Conolly J (1864) Clinical features of the principle forms of insanity. Lecture 13. Description and treatment of puerperal insanity. Lancet i: 349-354. , and it is essential that she is monitored by a competent adult round the clock, and visited frequently by professional staff. Home treatment is a counsel of perfection and most mothers will be admitted to a psychiatric hospital, many as an emergency, and usually without their babies. In a few countries, especially Australia, Belgium, France, India, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, special units allow the admission of both mother and infant. Conjoint admission has many advantages, but the risks to the infant of admission to a ward full of severely ill mothers should not be understated Margison F R (1981) Assessing the use of a psychiatric unit for mothers and their babies: risks to the babies. M Sc thesis, Manchester. name=\\"Oxford 1996, p556-8.\\" , and the high ratio of nursing staff, required to safeguard the infants, make these among the most expensive psychiatric units.

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome in a case of postpartum psychosis. British Journal of Psychiatry 155: 849-852. . Since the link with bipolar disorder was recognized (about 1970), treatment with mood-stabilizing agents, such as lithium name=\\"Bergink 2013, p20-3.\\" and anti-convulsant drugs, has been employed with success. Electroconvulsive therapy has the reputation of efficacy in this disorder Prothero C (1969) Puerperal psychoses: a long-term study 1927-1961. British Journal of Psychiatry 115: 9-30. , and it can be given during pregnancy (avoiding the risk of pharmaceutical treatment), with due precautions Anderson E L, Reti I M (2009) ECT in pregnancy: a review of the literature from 1941 to 2007. Psychosomatic Medicine 71: 235-242. . But there have been no trials, and Dutch experience has shown that almost all mothers recover quickly without it name=\\"Bergink 2013, p22.\\" . After recovery the mother may need antidepressant treatment and/or prophylactic mood stabilizers; she will need counselling about the risk of recurrence and will often appreciate psychotherapeutic support Jones I, Chandra P S, Dazzan P, Howard L M (2014) Bipolar disorder, affective psychosis, and schizophrenia in pregnancy and the post-partum period. Lancet 384: 1789-1799. . Prevention There is much evidence that lithium can at least partly prevent episodes in mothers at high risk name=\\"Bergink 2013, p45-59.\\" . It is dangerous during parturition, when pressure in the pelvis can obstruct the ureters and raise blood levels name=\\"Cambridge 2017, p233-4\\" . Started after the birth its adverse effects are minimal, even in breast-fed infants Viguera A C, Newport D J, Ritchie J, Stowe Z, Whitfield T, Mogielnicki J, Baldessarini R J, Zurick A, Cohen L S (2007) Lithium in breast milk and nursing infants: clinical implications. American Journal of Psychiatry 164: 342-345. . But these are early days in the control of this malady. The ambition of medicine is to eradicate disease through understanding its causes, and dealing with them. To eliminate the risk of puerperal psychosis in the daughters and descendants of present sufferers, we need to know much more about the bipolar diathesis, and how, in each onset group, episodes are triggered. =Causes= The cause of postpartum bipolar disorder breaks down into two parts ‚Äì the nature of the brain anomalies that predispose to manic and depressive symptoms, and the triggers that provoke these symptoms in those with the bipolar diathesis. The genetic, anatomical and neurochemical basis of bipolar disorder is at present unknown, and is one of the most important projects in psychiatry; but is not the main concern here. The challenge and opportunity presented by the childbearing psychoses is to identify the triggers of early postpartum onset and other onset groups. Considering that these psychoses have been known for centuries, little effort has so far been made to understand the underlying biology Davies W. (2017) Understanding the pathophysiology of postpartum psychosis: challenges and new approaches. World Journal of Psychiatry 7(2):77-88 doi:10.5498/wjp.v7.i2.77. Research has lagged far behind other areas of medicine and psychiatry Brockington I F (2018) Publications on 'puerperal psychosis', 2013-2017. Annals of Women's Health 2: 1-8.. There is a dearth of knowledge and of theories. There is a much evidence of heritability, both from family studies Prothero C (1969) Puerperal psychoses: a long-term study 1927-1961.

British Journal of Psychiatry 150: 662-673., but this is not true of late postpartum or pregnancy onset. There are not many other clues. Sleep deprivation has been suggested Lewis K J S, Foster R G, Jones I R (2016) Is sleep disruption a trigger for postpartum psychosis? British Journal of Psychiatry 208: 409-411..

Psychoneuroendocrinology 74: 363-370.. A recent hypothesis name=\\"Bergink 2013, p75-82.\\" , supported by collateral studies, invokes the re-awakening of auto-immunity after its suppression during pregnancy, on the model of multiple sclerosis or autoimmune thyroiditis; a related hypothesis has proposed that abnormal immune system processes (regulatory T cell biology) and consequent changes in myelinogenesis may increase postpartum psychosis risk Dazzan P, Fuste M, Davies W. (2018) Do defective immune system-mediated myelination processes increase postpartum psychosis risk? Trends in Molecular Medicine 24(11): 942-949 doi:10.1016/j.molmed.2018.09.002. The other promising lead is based on the similarity of bipolar-cycloid puerperal and menstrual psychosis; many women have suffered from both. Late-onset puerperal psychoses, and relapses may be linked to menstruation. Since almost all reproductive onsets occur when the menstrual cycle is released from a long period of inhibition, this may be a common factor, but it can hardly explain episodes starting in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy name=\\"Cambridge 2017, p320-330.\\" . =History= Between the 16th and 18th centuries about 50 brief reports were published; among them is the observation that these psychoses could recur Van Foreest P (1609) Puerperas nonnunquam phreniticas fierit & sineglectim habeantur, sibi ipsis vim inferre. Observationes, scholio 7, lib. 10. , and that they occur both in breast-feeding and non-lactating women Bartholomaeo de Battista a St Georgio (1784) Von der Tollsucht den Kindbetterinnen, in his Abhandlung von den Krankheiten des sch√∂nen Geschlechtes, Vienna, Sonnleithner, pages 113-114 in the 1819 edition. .

These cases have been translated in reference 86, p19-30., an obstetrician from T√ºbingen, reported two cases at length - masterly descriptions which are among the treasures of medical literature. In 1819, Esquirol Esquirol J E D (1819) De l'ali√©nation mentale des nouvelles accouch√©es et des nourrices. Annuaires M√©dicales-chirurgiques des H√¥pitaux de Paris 1: 600-632. conducted a survey of cases admitted to the Salp√™tri√®re, and pioneered long term studies. From that time, puerperal psychosis became widely known to the medical profession. In the next 200 years over 2,500 theses, articles and books were published. Among the outstanding contributions were Delay‚Äôs unique investigation using serial curettage Delay J, Boitelle G, Corteel A (1948. Les psychoses du postpartum: √©tude cyto-hormonale.

Lancet 384: 1789-1799. . Research is needed to improve the care and treatment of afflicted mothers, but it is of paramount importance to investigate the causes, because this can lead to long term control and elimination of the disease. The opportunities come under the heading of clinical observation, the study of the acute episode, long-term studies, epidemiology, genetics and neuroscience name=\\"Cambridge 2017, p369-371.\\" . If mothers, who have suffered from puerperal psychosis, are concerned to encourage research this is a contact i.f.brockington@bham.ac.uk.. In a disorder with a strong genetic element and links to the reproductive process, costly imaging, molecular-genetic and neuroendocrinological investigations will be decisive. These depend on expert laboratory methods. It is important that the clinical study is also ‚Äòstate-of- the-art‚Äô‚Äì that scientists understand the complexity of these psychoses, and the need for multiple and reliable information sources to establish the diagnosis. Other non-organic postpartum psychoses It is much less common to encounter other acute psychoses in the puerperium. =Psychogenic psychosis= This is the name given to a psychosis whose theme, onset and course are all related to an extremely stressful event Str√∂mgren E (1986) Reactive (psychogenic) psychoses and their relations to schizoaffective psychoses. In A Marneros & M T Tsuang (editors), Schizoaffective Psychoses, Berlin-Heidelberg, Springer-Verlag, pages 260-271.. The psychotic symptom is usually a delusion. Over 50 cases have been described, but usually in unusual circumstances, such as abortion Edelberg H, Galant (1925) √úber psychotische Zust√§nde nach k√ºnstlichen Abort. Zeitschrift f√ºr die gesamte Neurologie und Psychiatrie 97: 106-128. or adoption Trixler M, J√°di T, Wagner M (1981) Adoptaci√≥ ut√°ni ‚Äöpost partum‚Äò pszich√≥zisok.

They are occasionally seen after normal childbirth name=\\"Cambridge 2017, p169-171.\\" . =Paranoid and schizophrenic psychoses= These are so uncommon in the puerperium that it seems reasonable to regard them as sporadic events, not puerperal complications. =Early postpartum stupor= Brief states of stupor have rarely been described in the first few hours or days after the birth name=\\"Cambridge 2017, p119-122.\\" . They are similar to parturient delirium and stupor, which are among the Psychiatric disorders of childbirth. Organic postpartum psychoses There are at least a dozen organic (neuropsychiatric) psychoses that can present in pregnancy or soon after childbirth name=\\"Cambridge 2017, p24-67.\\" . The clinical picture is usually delirium - a global disturbance of cognition, affecting consciousness, attention, comprehension, perception and memory - but amnesic syndromes and a mania-like state name=\\"Cambridge 2017, p25.\\" also occur. The two most recent were described in 1980 Yamada N, Fukui M, Ishii K, Shibata H, Okabe H, Ohomiya H, Matsunobu A, Nishizima M 1980) A case of adult form hypercitrullinemia with consciousness disturbance and marked hypertransaminasenemia after delivery.

Rinsho Shinkeigaku 50: 103-107., and it is quite likely that others will be described. Organic psychoses, especially those due to infection, may be more common in nations with high parturient morbidity Ndosi N K, Mtawali M L (2002) The nature of puerperal psychosis at Muhimbili National Hospital: its physical co-morbidity, associated main obstetric and social factors. African Journal of Reproductive Health 6: 41-49.. =Infective delirium= The most common organic postpartum psychosis is infective delirium. This was mentioned by Hippocrates Hippocrates (5th Century BC) Epidemics, book III, volume 1, pages 280-283, in the edition translated by W H S Jones, 1931. : there are 8 cases of puerperal or post-abortion sepsis among the 17 women in the 1st and 3rd books of epidemics, all complicated by delirium. In Europe and North America the foundation of the metropolitan maternity hospitals, together with instrumental deliveries and the practice of attending necropsies, led to epidemics of streptococcal puerperal fever, resulting in maternal mortality rates up to 10%. The peak was about 1870, after which antisepsis and asepsis gradually brought them under control. These severe infections were often complicated by delirium, but it was not until the nosological advances of Chaslin Chaslin P (1895) Confusion Mentale Primitive, Stupidit√©, D√©mence aigu√´, Stupeur Primitive. Paris, Harmattan. and Bonh√∂ffer Bonh√∂ffer K (1910) Die symptomatischen Psychosen im Gefolge von akuten Infektionen und inneren Erkrankungen. Leipzig and Wien, Deutlicke. that they could be distinguished from other causes of postpartum psychosis. Infective delirium hardly ever starts during pregnancy, and usually begins in the first postpartum week. The onset of sepsis and delirium are closely related, and the course parallels the infection, although about 20% of patients continue to suffer from chronic confusional states after recovery from the infection. Recurrences after another pregnancy are rare. Their frequency began to decline at the end of the 19th century Poulsen A (1899) Nogle bem√§rkungen om puerperal psychosen. Hospitals-Tidende, 4 r√§kke, 7: 251-260. , and fell steeply after the discovery of the sulphonamides. Puerperal sepsis is still common in Bangla Desh Halim A, Utz B, Biswas A, Rahman F, van den Broek N (2014) Cause of, and contributing factors, to maternal deaths: a cross- sectional study using verbal autopsy in four districts in Bangladesh.

BMC Pregnancy Childbirth 5: 1-10.. Even in Britain, cases are still occasionally seen name=\\"Cambridge 2017, p27.\\" . It would be a mistake to forget this cause of puerperal psychosis. =Eclamptic and Donkin psychoses= Eclampsia is the sudden eruption of convulsions in a pregnant woman, usually around the time of delivery. It is the late complication of pre-eclamptic toxaemia (gestosis). Although its frequency in nations with excellent obstetric services has fallen below 1/500 pregnancies, it is still common in many other countries. The primary pathology is in the placenta, which secretes an anti-angiogenic factor in response to ischaemia, leading to endothelial dysfunction Roberts J M (1998) Endothelial dysfunction in pre-eclampsia. Seminars in Reproductive Endocrinology 16: 5-15. Tomimatsu T, Mimura K, Matsuzaki S, Endo M, Kumasawa K, Kimura T (2019) Preeeclampsia: maternal systemic vascular disorder caused by generalized endothelial dysfunction due to placental antiangiogenic factors. International Journal of Molecular Science 20: E4246.. In fatal cases, there are arterial lesions in many organs including the brain. This is the second most frequent organic psychosis, and the second to be described Imbert-Gourbeyer (1861) Des paralyses puerp√©rales. M√©moirs de l'Acad√©mie Imp√©riale de M√©decine 25: 46-53.. Psychoses occur in about 5% of cases, and about 240 detailed cases have been reported name=\\"Cambridge 2017, p28-35.\\" . It particularly affects first time mothers. Seizures may begin before, during or after labour, but the onset of psychosis is almost always postpartum. These mothers usually suffer from delirium but some have manic features. The duration is remarkably short, with a median duration of 8 days. This, together with the absence of a family history and of recurrences, contrasts with puerperal bipolar/cycloid psychoses. After recovery, amnesia and sometimes retrograde memory loss may occur, as well as other permanent cerebral lesions such as dysphasia, hemiplegia or blindness. A variant was described by Donkin Donkin A S (1863) On the pathological relation between albuminuria and puerperal mania. Edinburgh Medical Journal 8: 994-1004.. He had been trained by Simpson (one of those who first recognized the importance of albuminuria) in Edinburgh, and recognized that some cases of eclamptic psychosis occurred without seizures; this explains the interval between seizures (or coma) and psychosis, a gap that has occasionally exceeded 4 days: seizures and psychosis are two different consequences of severe gestosis. Donkin psychosis may not be rare: a British series included 13 possible cases name=\\"Cambridge 2017, p35.\\" ; but clarifying its distinction from postpartum bipolar disorder requires prospective investigations in collaboration with obstetricians. =Wernicke- Korsakoff psychosis= This was described by Wernicke Wernicke C (1881) Lehrbuch der Gehirnkrankheiten f√ºr √Ñrzte und Studirende, volume 2.

The pathology is damage to the core of the brain including the thalamus and mamillary bodies. Its most striking clinical feature is loss of memory, which can be permanent. It is usually found in severe alcoholics, but can also result from pernicious vomiting of pregnancy (hyperemesis gravidarum), because the requirement for thiamine is much increased in pregnancy; nearly 200 cases have been reported name=\\"Cambridge 2017, p36-41.\\" . The cause is vitamin B1 (thiamine) deficiency. This has been available for treatment and prevention since 1936 Williams R R, Cline J K (1936) Synthesis of vitamin B1. Journal of the American Chemical Association 58: 1504-1505., so the occurrence of this syndrome in pregnancy should be extinct. But these cases continue to be reported ‚Äì more than 50 in this century ‚Äì from all over the world, including some from countries with advanced medical services Giugale L E, Young O M, Streitman D C (2015) Iatrogenic Wernicke encephalopathy in a patient with severe hyperemesis gravidarum. Obstetrics and Gynecology 125: 1150-1152. ; most are due to rehydration without vitamin supplements. A pregnant woman who presents in a dehydrated state due to pernicious vomiting urgently needs thiamine, as well as intravenous fluids. =Vascular disorders= Various vascular disorders occasionally cause psychosis, especially cerebral venous thrombosis. Puerperal women are liable to thrombosis, especially thrombophlebitis of the leg and pelvic veins; aseptic thrombi can also form in the dural venous sinuses and the cerebral veins draining into them. Most patients present with headache, vomiting, seizures and focal signs such as hemiplegia or dysphasia, but a minority of cases have a psychiatric presentation Kalbag R M, Woolf A L (1967) Cerebral Venous Thrombosis, with Special Reference to Primary Aseptic Thrombosis. Oxford, Oxford University Press.. The incidence is about 10/10,000 births in Europe and North America Lanska D J, Kryscio R J (2000) Risk factors for peripartum and postpartum stroke and intracranial venous thrombosis. Stroke 31: 1274-1282., but much higher in India, where large series have been collected Srinavasan K (1988) Puerperal cerebral venous and arterial thrombosis. Seminars in Neurology 8:222-225.. Psychosis is occasionally associated with other arterial or venous lesions: epidural anaesthesia can, if the dura is punctured, lead to leakage of cerebrospinal fluid and subdural haematoma Jack T M (1982) Post-partum intracranial subdural haematoma. A possible complication of epidural analgesia. British Medical Journal 285: 972 only.. Arterial occlusion may be due to thrombi, amniotic fragments or air embolism. Postpartum cerebral angiopathy is a transitory arterial spasm of medium caliber cerebral arteries; it was first described in cocaine and amphetamine addicts, but can also complicate ergot and bromocriptine prescribed to inhibit lactation. Subarachnoid haemorrhage can occur after miscarriage or childbirth. All these usually present with neurological symptoms, and occasionally with delirium. =Epilepsy= Women with a lifelong epileptic history are liable to psychoses during pregnancy, labour and the puerperium. Women occasionally develop epilepsy for the first time in relation to their first pregnancy, and psychotic episodes have been described. There are over 30 cases in the literature name=\\"Cambridge 2017, p56-58.\\" . =Hypopituitarism= Pituitary necrosis following postpartum haemorrhage (Sheehan's syndrome) leads to failure and atrophy of the gonads, adrenal and thyroid. Chronic psychoses can supervene many years later, based on myxoedema, hypoglycaemia or Addisonian crisis. But these patients can also develop acute and recurrent psychoses, even as early as the puerperium. Shoib S, Dar M M, Arif T, Bashir H, Bhat M H, Ahmed J (2013) Sheehan‚Äôs syndrome presenting as psychosis: a rare clinical presentation. Medical Journal of the Republic of Iran 27: 35-37. name=\\"Cambridge 2017, p59-62.\\" . =Water intoxication= Hyponatraemia (which leads to delirium) can complicate oxytocin treatment, usually when given to induce an abortion. By 1975, 29 cases had been reported, of which three were severe or fatal Ahmad A J, Clark E H, Jacobs H S (1975) Water intoxication associated with oxytocin infusion. Postgraduate Medical Journal 51: 249-252.. =Urea cycle disorders= Inborn errors of the Krebs-Henseleit urea cycle lead to hyperammonaemia. In carriers and heterozygotes, encephalopathy can develop in pregnancy or the puerperium. Cases have been described in carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1, argino-succinate synthetase and ornithine carbamoyltransferase deficiency name=\\"Cambridge 2017, p63-65.\\" . =Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis= The most recent form of organic childbearing psychosis to be described is encephalitis associated with antibodies to the NMDA receptor; these women often have ovarian teratomas. A Japanese review found ten reported during pregnancy and five after delivery Doden T, Sekijima Y, Ikeda J, Ozawa K, Ohashi N, Kodaira M, Hineno A, Tachibana N, Ikeda S (2016) Postpartum anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis: a case report and literature review. Internal Medicine 56: 357-362. . =Other organic psychoses with a specific link to childbearing= Sydenham's chorea, of which chorea gravidarum is a severe variant, has a number of psychiatric complications, which include psychosis. This usually develops during pregnancy, and occasionally after the birth or abortion. Its symptoms include severe hypnagogic hallucinations (hypnagogia) Marc√© L V (1860) L'√âtat mental dans la chor√©e. M√©moir√©s de l'Acad√©mie de M√©decine 24: 30-38. Breton A (1893) √âtat mental dans la chor√©e. Th√®se, Paris, no. 124., possibly the result of the extreme sleep disorder. This form of chorea was caused by streptococcal infections, which at present respond to antibiotics; it still occurs as a result of systemic lupus or anti-phospholipid syndromes. Only about 50 chorea psychoses have been reported, and only one this century; but it could return if the streptococcus escapes control. Alcohol withdrawal states (delirium tremens) occur in addicts whose intake has been interrupted by trauma or surgery; this can happen after childbirth. Postpartum confusional states have also been reported during withdrawal from opium Hill N M (1891) Four cases of puerperal insanity. Transactions of the Iowa State Medical Society 9: 132-134. and barbiturates Baker A A (1967) Psychiatric Disorders in Obstetrics, Oxford, Blackwell, page 61.. One would expect acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) encephalitis to present in pregnancy or the puerperium, because it is a venereal disease that can progress rapidly; one case of AIDS encephalitis, presenting in the 28th week of gestation, has been reported from Haiti Birnbach D J, Bourlier R A, Choi R, Thys D M (1995) Anaesthetic management of Caesarean section in a patient with recurrent genital herpes and AIDS-related dementia. British Journal of Anaesthesia 75: 639-641., and there may be others in countries where AIDS is rife. Anaemia is common in pregnancy and the puerperium, and folate deficiency has been linked to psychosis Thornton W E (1977) Folate deficiency in puerperal psychosis. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology 129: 222-223.. =Incidental organic psychoses= The psychoses, mentioned above, all had a recognized connection with childbearing. But medical disorders with no specific link have presented with psychotic symptoms in the puerperium; in them the association seems to be fortuitous name=\\"Cambridge 2017, p6-73.\\" . They include neurosyphilis, encephalitis including von Economo‚Äôs, meningitis, cerebral tumours, thyroid disease and ischaemic heart disease. Society and cultureSupport= In the UK, a series of workshops called \\"Unravelling Eve\\" were held in 2011, where women who had experienced postpartum depression shared their stories. =Notable cases in history and fiction= Harriet Sarah, Lady Mordaunt (1848‚Äì1906), formerly Harriet Moncreiffe, was the Scottish wife of an English baronet and Member of Parliament, Sir Charles Mordaunt. She was the defendant in a sensational divorce case in which the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII) was embroiled; after a controversial trial lasting seven days, the jury determined that Lady Mordaunt was suffering from ‚Äúpuerperal mania‚Äù and her husband's petition for divorce was dismissed, while Lady Mordaunt was committed to an asylum. E-book . Andrea Yates suffered from depression and, four months after the birth of her 5th child, relapsed, with psychotic features. Several weeks later she drowned all five children. Under the law in Texas, she was sentenced to life imprisonment, but, after a retrial, was committed to a mental hospital. Guy de Maupassant, in his novel Mont-Oriol (1887) described a brief postpartum psychotic episode. Charlotte Perkins Gilman, in her short story The Yellow Wallpaper (1892) described severe depression with psychotic features starting after childbirth, perhaps similar to that experienced by the author herself. Stacey Slater, a fictional character in the long-running BBC soap-opera EastEnders suffered from postpartum psychosis in 2016, and was one of the show's biggest storylines that year. =Legal status= Postpartum psychosis, especially when there is a marked component of depression, has a small risk of filicide. In acute manic or cycloid cases, this risk is about 1% name=\\"Cambridge 2017, p240-6.\\" . Most of these incidents have occurred before the mother came under treatment, and some have been accidental. Several nations including Canada, Great Britain, Australia, and Italy recognize postpartum mental illness as a mitigating factor in cases where mothers kill their children. In the United States, such a legal distinction was not made as of 2009., and an insanity defense is not available in all states. Britain has had the Infanticide Act since 1922. Books written about postpartum psychosis Apart from the two monographs mentioned in the text (references 1 and 86), the following books have been published about these psychoses: Ripping, Dr (1877) Die Geistesst√∂rungen der Schwangeren, W√∂chnerinnen und S√§ugenden.

It is situated approximately 11 miles northwest of Floresville. According to the Handbook of Texas, the community had an estimated population of 443 in 2000. Saspamco was named after the San Antonio Sewer Pipe Manufacturing CompanyTemple, Robert D. Edge Effects: The Border-Name Places, (2nd edition, 2009), iUniverse, , page 324. which began operations around 1901 using the red clay of the area to manufacture tile products. Saspamco is part of the San Antonio Metropolitan Statistical Area. History A post office was opened in 1901, as well as a loading switch with the San Antonio and Aransas Pass Railway. By 1915, the town boasted a population of 125 people as well as two Churches, one Catholic and one Baptist. The town saw its heyday in the 1930s when the Saspamco plant by the same name could produce 120 tons of sewer pipe a day. In 1917, the State of Texas's special legislature granted funds for the now-defunct Saspamco Independent School District to purchase lands in Bexar County to expand its school system. By the 1960s, most of the businesses in Saspamco closed, although the pipe company continued operations for a number of years later. Clay pipe was on the decline, as steel pipe and eventually PVC pipe greatly reduced the demand for the heavy and less reliable clay pipe manufactured in the town. In the mid-1980s, Tyson Foods opened a large poultry hatchery nearby, though this was only open for about 10 years before the facility was relocated elsewhere. For a number of years in the late 1960s until the early 1980s, the quarry left from the brick manufacturing plant was used as a landfill by a private owner who used to charge nominal fees for garbage companies to dump their waste there. In the 1980s, the former TNRCC (now called the TCEQ) closed the facility as a landfill because of a lack of a landfill permit, and not having adequate drainage facilities. During this era the area saw an explosion of both the rodent and the rattlesnake populations. Since then, these populations have returned to normal levels.

His published works, while still available in French translation, largely have been out of print until recently. Home from the Hill and The Ordways are available from LSU Press. In 2015, Open Road Media published the complete works of William Humphrey in digital form. Of significant interest to readers of Humphrey are Wakeful Anguish, A Literary Biography of William Humphrey by Ashby Bland Crowder as well as Far From Home, Selected Letters of William Humphrey edited by Crowder, both available from Louisiana State University Press. Biography William Humphrey was born on 18 June 1924 to Clarence and Nell (Varley) Humphrey in Clarksville, Texas, a region that is culturally southern rather than western. His parents were poor and uneducated, and they moved from house to house because they were unable to keep up with the rent. His father eventually owned and operated an auto repair shop in Clarksville. By the 1950s, Humphrey had escaped his origins: He was thought of as a member of the glittering literati of the northeast, and Vogue magazine featured him in its ‚Äúgallery of international charmers among men,‚Äù along with Marlon Brando, Sir Edmund Hillary, Leonard Bernstein, and John F. Kennedy. But Humphrey thought little of such ‚Äúhonors‚Äù and took no opportunity to capitalize on such chances at fame. He preferred to retreat to his desk and write, thinking any recognition should come from his writing. Unlike Truman Capote and Norman Mailer, and despite his profound desire to be remembered for his literary contributions, Humphrey made very little effort to promote himself. The central event in Humphrey's childhood was the death of his father in a car wreck when the boy was 13. His memoir Farther Off from Heaven, published in 1977, is a moving account of this event's effect on him. He and his mother, Nell Varley Humphrey, moved to Dallas because there was no work for her in Clarksville. Humphrey attended Southern Methodist University and the University of Texas (perhaps at the Austin campus since his papers are archived in their library),Humphrey, William, 1924-1997 William Humphrey Papers 1932-1992, n.d. (bulk 1944-1992) 28 boxes, 1 oversize box, 1 oversize folder, 9 galley folders (11.86 linear feet) Harry Ransom Center, University of Texas at Austin These materials document the family, life, and work of the American writer William Humphrey. The papers contain manuscripts and notebooks covering most of his books and short stories. Also included are large amounts of newspaper clippings, correspondence, and photographs. English, French, and Italian. but never graduated. He left Texas as soon as he could. Humphrey moved to Chicago and then New York City with his play Ambassador Ben in hand to see if he could become a Broadway success. This was in 1945. The play never was performed and never published. Humphrey began to write stories and left New York City to write in Brewster, New York. There Humphrey worked on the farm belonging to Donald Peterson, the producer and director of The Ave Maria Hour on WMCA radio. Humphrey published The Last Husband and Other Stories, his first book of stories, in 1953. Humphrey secured a teaching post at Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York in 1949, the same year he married Dorothy Feinman Cantine,AskArt: Dorothy Feinman Humphrey a painter of considerable talent who had a daughter Toni. He taught at Bard until 1958 when the success of his first novel, Home from the Hill (1958), and its 1960 film adaptation, gave him enough money to quit teaching and devote himself to writing full-time. Career Humphrey wrote 13 books, including five novels, collections of short stories and a memoir. His first novel, Home from the Hill, was made into a 1960 MGM film. While the movie betrays the original intent of the author, and Humphrey claimed never to have seen it, the sale of the movie rights enabled the struggling Humphrey family to pursue a literary life. His second novel, The Ordways, was reviewed by the 'New York Times as \\"Funny, vivid and moving, this is a fine piece of work and a delight to read,\\" and was compared to the writings of William Faulkner and Mark Twain. His books received high praise when they were first published, even from fellow writers. He went on to publish a dozen more books. Humphrey wrote fiction that addressed the Southern past. He once asserted, ‚ÄúI am a destroyer of myths. My whole work has shown the danger and falseness of myths..[especially] the myth of the South‚Äù (‚ÄúNotes on the Orestia,‚Äù 38; MS at Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center, University of Texas at Austin). Home from the Hill (1958) is Humphrey‚Äôs first and most famous novel. It is the story of the aristocratic Hunnicutt family, a holdover from the Old South. The family is fated to end in destruction and destroyed‚Äîbecause of a moral corruption at its core. The novel Hostages to Fortune (1985) represents a return to the tragic mode. Humphrey‚Äôs first novel set outside the South, it portrays a man named Ben Curtis on the day he reenters life after a two-year descent into darkness resulting from his son‚Äôs suicide. His effort to understand why his son committed suicide leads to his own attempted suicide. Richard Lipez said of this novel: \\"To pick up Humphrey‚Äôs extraordinary new novel is to hold an embodiment of grief in your hands. The unrelenting anguish that suffuses this story [is] almost unbearable to behold. It is possible to get through it because the stark poetry of Humphrey‚Äôs work is enthralling.\\" (Newsweek) His last book was September Song (1992), a collection of short stories about old age. The collection of Humphrey‚Äôs letters, Far from Home (2008), provides enlightening analysis of his own works. They also display his relationship with other writers, including Katherine Anne Porter, Theodore Weiss, and Rust Hill. Jonathan Yardley, writing in The Washington Post (issue of 5 July 1992), remarked of Humphrey: \\"Minor, but interesting and admirable. It has been a long time since Humphrey has enjoyed a commercial success, but he has dedicated his life to his writing with a fidelity all too rare in a culture that encourages facile success and empty honor.\\" Bibliography ;Books Note: The titles are listed referencing the original hard cover publishers.

The ESC produces, organises and supports many scientific and educational activities and products aimed at cardiology professionals wishing to increase their knowledge and update their skills.  History  The ESC was founded in 1950 and its headquarters are located in beautiful technology park of Sophia Antipolis in the South of France, between Nice and Cannes. The first European Congress of Cardiology was held in London in September 1950. The most recent statistics show that the association represents a total of 80,000 professionals in cardiology from Europe and the Mediterranean. Aside from its headquarters in Sophia Antipolis the ESC opened the European Heart Agency in Brussels in February 2013, located close to the European Parliament complex, as it is fundamental to the ESC‚Äôs future to build a base in the political capital of Europe.  Structure  The ESC comprises: * 57 National Cardiac Societies * 7 Associations * 15 Working Groups * 7 Councils, covering different sub-specialties of cardiology. Activities reach far beyond the boundaries of Europe, and nearly 90,000 members come from all over the world. The ESC maintains close ties to 57 National Cardiac Societies and 47 Affiliated Cardiac Societies worldwide. Recently, additional infrastructures were developed within associations addressing the special interests and needs of female specialists, and young physicians, such as young Electrophysiologists.  Congresses & Events  ESC Congress 2019, Paris The ESC organises several top cardiology congresses per year, including the ESC Congress. Annual or biennial sub-specialty congresses address acute cardiac care (Acute Cardiovascular Care congress), cardiac imaging (EuroEcho-Imaging congress), prevention and rehabilitation (EuroPrevent congress), ESC Preventive Cardiolgy, nuclear cardiology and cardiac CT (ICNC congress), magnetic resonance (EuroCMR congress), interventional cardiology (EuroPCR congress), heart failure (Heart Failure congress), heart rhythm and electrophysiology (EHRA congress), as well as basic science (Frontiers in CardioVascular Biology congress).

Halford is most noted for his development and promotion of the dry fly technique on English chalk streams. He is generally accepted as \\"The Father of Modern Dry Fly Fishing\\". John Waller Hills, A History of Fly Fishing for Trout (1921) called Halford \\"The Historian of the Dry Fly\\". In Royal Coachman ‚Äì The Lore and Legends of Fly Fishing (1999), Paul Schullery describes Halford: Early life to 1877 Frederic Halford was born Frederic Michael Hyam into a wealthy Jewish family of German ancestry in 1844 in Birmingham, England. His parents, Samuel and Phoebe Hyam, moved to London when Frederic was 7. Samuel Hyam, and his brothers Lawrence and Benjamin, were very prosperous manufacturers of textiles and clothing in Birmingham, Leeds and Manchester. In 1875, all the Hyams changed their name to Halford. At the age of 7, Halford began attending University College School (UCS) in London. When he left UCS in 1860 he went to work in one of the family businesses. Very little is known of his business career except that he retired from business at the age of 45 in 1889 to become a full-time angler. In February 1866, he became an officer in the 36th Middlesex Volunteers for a short period of time, during which he learned how to shoot. His first experience of fishing was in a small London pond at the age of 6 and as a boy he fished the Serpentine and the Long Pool in Hyde Park. As a teenager, he regularly fished the Thames with conventional tackle for sea trout, bream, and pike. His largest fish was a Brown trout from the Thames that weighed in 1870. Halford's first experiences in fly fishing were at the age of 24 in 1868 when, through the generosity of a family friend, he was given a free beat on the River Wandle, a pristine trout stream to the southwest of London.In 1868 the Wandle was about 10 miles outside London and remained a productive trout stream into the 1880s. Today, the Wandle is part of Greater London, has been heavily polluted and is no longer a trout stream, although in recent years it is recovering. In the late 1860s, the dry fly was in use to some extent on the Wandle, but as a fly-fishing technique it was in its infancy. Halford learned the basics of fly fishing on the Wandle, a river he fished regularly every summer until 1881. Chalk stream fly fishing In 1877 Halford became a member of the Houghton Fly Fishers on the River Test. In 1879, in John Hammond's tackle shop in Winchester, Halford met angler George Selwyn Marryat, a meeting that was to change the course of fly-fishing history. They were to be friends for the remainder of Marryat's life. In 1880, Halford found accommodation at Houghton Mill, on the banks of the Test and, with Marryat, began his research for his first book, Floating Flies and How to Dress Them, published in 1886. Halford wanted Marryat to be joint author of the book, but Marryat declined, wishing to remain anonymous. The book was a huge success, and laid the foundations for Halford's legacy as the \\"High Priest of the Dry Fly\\". In 1889, when he was 45, Halford retired from the family business to pursue fly fishing and writing. In that year he published his second book, Dry Fly Fishing in Theory and Practice. Before he died, he fished a variety of beats on the Kennet, the Test and the Itchen but he rarely fished outside the country or away from the chalk streams of the south of England. It was on the Itchen where he met and fished with G. E. M. Skues in 1891. Halford published four other books on dry-fly fishing before his death: Making a Fishery (1895), Dry Fly Entomology (1897), Modern Development of the Dry Fly (1910) and The Dry Fly Man's Handbook (1913), as well as his autobiography An Angler's Autobiography (1903). Halford was among the founding members of the British Flyfishers' Club, a prestigious gentlemen's' club in London devoted to the sport of fly fishing. =Halford vs Skues, dry fly vs nymph= Halford, along with Marryatt, perfected upstream dry-fly fishing in late 19th-century England and treated other forms of fly presentation, such as wet flies and nymphs on English chalk streams, with disdain. By the early 20th century, the Halford dry-fly doctrine had become cultish and to some extent dogmatic. The following passage by Halford epitomises his dogmatic views: When G. E. M. Skues began promoting upstream nymphing techniques on English chalk streams at the turn of the 20th century, there was immediate tension between those who favoured and followed the Halford school of dry-fly fishing and those who chose to use other techniques. There is no evidence that there was ever any personal animosity between the two anglers, only verbal wrangling in the sporting press about the pros and cons of the two techniques. Indeed, Skues's second work The Way of a Trout with the Fly, which codified the upstream nymphing technique, was not published until 1921, well after Halford's death. The debates continued into the 1930s. The Halfordian school claimed that upstream nymphing, although effective, was unethical and bad for the chalk streams, even to the point of banning the use of nymph on some fisheries, while Skues's proponents claimed that the dogmatic dry-fly approach limited opportunities when nymphing was a more appropriate technique. A culmination of sorts took place in February 1938 at the Flyfishers' Club when the so-called \\"Nymph Debate\\" took place. Skues was present to defend nymphing techniques, while many others, chiefly Sir Joseph Ball, defended the Halfordian doctrine. The result was decidedly in favour of Halford's dry-fly techniques to the exclusion of all others, but no one denied the effectiveness of Skues's nymphing methodology. The debate helped cement both Halford's and Skues's seminal roles in the development of modern-day fly fishing. Halford from the frontispiece of his Making a Fishery, 1895 =Influences on American angling= Charles Goodspeed, in Angling in America (1939), his history of American angling, credits Halford's Floating Flies and How to Dress Them as having a significant influence on the introduction of the dry-fly method into America. In 1890 Halford exchanged a series of letters on the subject of dry- fly fishing with American angler, Theodore Gordon, to include a complete set of Halford's favourite dry flies. In 1892, Favorite Flies and Their Histories, by Mary Orvis Mabury devoted a coloured plate to a selection of Halford's dry flies, along with their method of use. Death Frederic Halford was wealthy enough to take winter vacations in Europe and the Mediterranean to escape the English winter weather. He was also an amateur photographer and liked to capture the people and places he visited during his winter trips abroad. Much of his work still survives today and shows that he visited Spain in 1908, Pontresina in 1909, Egypt in 1910 and Biskra in 1911. In February 1914 he was in Tunis. During the return voyage he fell ill with pneumonia on the P&O; liner Morea. He died aboard on 5 March 1914 as the ship was arriving in London on the River Thames. He was 69 years old. After his funeral, praise for Halford in the mainstream British press as well as the sporting press was overwhelming. William Senior, editor of The Field, and a close personal friend of Halford wrote: In the Journal of the Fly Fisher's Club, published shortly after Halford's death, Dr A. C.

Overview  The UMGCCC is located on the medical campus of the University of Maryland in Baltimore, and is part of the university's medical center and its school of medicine as well. All researchers and physicians at the center are also faculty members of the medical school and other professional schools at the University of Maryland, Baltimore. The center actively participates in new drug development and conducts pilot studies and Phase I, II and III clinical trials. In addition to basic and clinical cancer research, cancer center activities include teaching and a strong focus on aggressive treatment for cancer patients in the 40-bed inpatient unit, dedicated Bone Marrow/Stem Cell Transplantation unit, and outpatient facility, which opened in 2005. The center has multidisciplinary clinical programs for all major cancers (breast, brain, cutaneous, head and neck, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, gynecological, hematologic malignancies, and thoracic cancer).  History  The University of Maryland's cancer center began as the intramural program of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) of the NIH. In 1965, the NCI created an intramural program in the Division of Cancer Treatment (DCT) located at the U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS) Hospital in Baltimore. Chemotherapy for cancer was beginning to be recognized as an integral part of modern cancer care, and the NCI was at the forefront of new approaches. The impetus for this off-campus intramural program was the need for additional beds for the NCI's in-house Phase I and Phase II studies. Because the NCI was a Federal organization, officials selected the Federal USPHS Hospital to serve as the source of beds relatively close to the Bethesda campus. The intramural program was formally designated as the Baltimore Cancer Research Center (BCRC) of the NCI. It included 40 beds, an 8-bed intensive care unit (ICU), a radiation oncology unit, and basic science laboratories of pharmacology and biochemistry, each directed by senior NCI personnel. The facility had the advantage of being close to the home campus, and its laboratory base was located in a city with a large patient population for referral for studies. The BCRC was involved in many studies, and the staff were highly productive, publishing multiple peer-reviewed papers in high-quality journals. For example, many patients in the landmark studies of MOPP treatment for Hodgkin's disease were treated at the BCRC. In 1974 the clinical unit of the BCRC moved to the University of Maryland Medical Center, and in 1976 the BCRC laboratories moved into the University of Maryland School of Medicine. The center remained an intramural NCI program under contractual arrangement between NCI and the University of Maryland at Baltimore. In 1978 its name was changed to the Baltimore Cancer Research Program (BCRP). From its inception, the BCRP was very active in clinical research with protocols developed by BCRP staff and via national groups such as the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB). The BCRP was also very active in basic and applied laboratory research in pharmacology, enzymology, immunology, and microbiology. In 1981 the National Cancer Institute divested the Baltimore Cancer Research Program from the federal government, and the University of Maryland School of Medicine and the Medical Center established the University of Maryland Cancer Center. In 1996, the center's name was changed to the Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Cancer Center (UMGCC) in recognition of a $10 million gift by its namesake benefactors: Baltimore philanthropists Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum and in 2008, was selected to be a designated cancer center by the NCI becoming 1 of 64 centers throughout the United States to have earned that distinction. After earning the NCI's highest designation of Comprehensive Cancer Center, the university changed the center's name and , has been called the University of Maryland Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center.

This forced many of the Tavdgiridze to relocate to relatively safer areas such as Kartli, Imereti, and Guria.

Pawned to Brandenburg-Prussia in 1657, it was directly incorporated into the Kingdom of Prussia in 1772. History In the High Middle Ages, the region of the later starostwo was a borderland of the Piast Kingdom of Poland with Duchy of Pomerania and Margraviate of Brandenburg. In 1268, the largely unsettled area was given to the Knights Templar by the Polish duke Przemys≈Ç II.Motsch (2001), p. 70 The order invited German settlers (Ostsiedlung).Motsch (2001), p. 39 The German name Tempelburg for present-day Polish Czaplinek dates back to that era, and derives from the German name of the Knights Templar, Templer. In 1312, the order was dissolved, and its possessions were taken over by the Knights Hospitaller. Draheim Castle (in the area of modern Stare Drawsko) was built in the mid-14th century at the crossing of the trade route via marchionis from Pomeranian Stargard to Danzig and the via regalis from Kolberg to Pozna≈Ñ.Motsch (2001), p. 72 In 1368, during an exchange of territories, Margrave Otto VII of Brandenburg gave the areas around Czaplinek and Wa≈Çcz (Deutsch Krone) to the Polish king Casimir III the Great, who in 1370 established Wa≈Çcz County (powiat Wa≈Çcz) from these accessions: part of the Pozna≈Ñ Voivodeship (palatinate), it consisted of seven loosely connected regions in royal or noble possession subordinate to the judicum castrensis in Wa≈Çcz. Draheim was made one of three (sub-)starosties of the county, the other ones being Usz-Pila (Schneidem√ºhl) and Wa≈Çcz. In addition to the three starosties, four regions consisting of allodial possessions of the von Wedell, von der Goltz and Czarnowski families were also part of the county. These noble families were also in possession of areas in Pomerania, the Brandeburgian Neumark and other parts of Poland, and also of areas within the Draheim starosty. Draheim Castle was a royal possession. The starost of Draheim (also tenutarius or capitaneatus tenutae) was appointed for life by the Polish king, who owned a quarter of the starosty's income.Motsch (2001), p. 71 The starost was in charge of the local administration, military and jurisdiction. His German subjects however, in contrast to peasants on Polish noble estates, were able to appeal his judicial decisions at the court in Wa≈Çcz, and were repeatedly assured this right in respective documents. When in the late 14th century the southwestern territories of Heinrichsdorf- Warlange and Brotzen-Machlin became allodial possessions of the von der Goltz family, who before had held the areas as fiefs, and were thus excluded from the starosty, Draheim lost a direct land route to the rest of Walcz county. Draheim was then surrounded by the Imperial Duchy of Pomerania in the north, east and southeast, with the exception of the small enclave of Gro√ü Poplow- Brutzen which was in the possession of the von Manteuffel family and directly under the Polish crown; in the southeast, Draheim bordered the Neumark exclave Gro√ü Zacharin-Doderlage. The border was not fixed, but varied according to the ability of competing nobles in the frontier region to manifest their respective claims.Motsch (2001), p. 55 When a noble perceived an intrusion into his territory, he and his subjects traditionally reacted with an inequatio, a mounted raid, into the territory of his competitor on the other side of the border. This practice persisted in Walcz county until the late 18th century.Motsch (2001), p. 56 In 1407 German and Polish nobility conquered the castle of Draheim (Stare Drawsko). These robber barons used the region as a base for raids until 1422, when they were defeated by the burghers of Dramburg (Drawsko Pomorskie). In 1438 the Teutonic Knights recognized Polish control of the region. In the 16th century the region largely converted to Lutheranism during the Protestant Reformation. During the counter-reformation, of the three important families only the von der Goltzs remained Protestant, while the von Wedells and Czarnowskis converted to Roman Catholicism, maintaining however a tolerant attitude towards the Protestant settlers. Starost Jan Czarnowski expelled the Protestant preachers in 1625; the churches were restored to Catholicism, although the populace remained largely Protestant. Draheim (Drahim) within the Pozna≈Ñ Voivodeship (in red), as of 1635 Also in the 16th century, conditions for peasants worsened in the neighboring Duchy of Pomerania due to the implementation of stringent serfdom.Motsch (2001), p. 40 Many peasants fled from Pomerania to Draheim and other parts of Walcz county, where the nobles offered them hereditary farmland in deserted villages and clearances which they were to settle according to German law.Motsch (2001), p. 41 The settlers primarily originated in Pomeranian and Neumark areas no more than away from the Draheim border, and their influx continued throughout the 16th and 17th centuries despite protests of their former superiors.Motsch (2001), p. 42 This migration was enhanced by the Thirty Years War, during which Pomerania and Neumark were devastated, while the Polish territories were spared. Orders of the Polish king to expel the refugees were ignored by the local nobles.Motsch (2001), p. 44 New villages were founded according to Magdeburg law: their settlement was organized by a Schulze, usually a rich farmer or burgher, who bought the office from the landlord and worked out the contracts (Privilegien or Lehnsbrieffe [sic!]) with the peasants. Schulzes as well as free peasants and pub owners were required to attend their landlord in arms when it came to the abovementioned border skirmishes with competing nobles.Motsch (2001), p. 48 Since a schulze was able to partition and sell his estate, with the heirs or other acquiring party gaining all privileges of a schulze even if owning only part of such an estate, the number of schulzes increased significantly over time.Motsch (2001), pp. 48,50 This process was enhanced by the landlords, who needed the schulzes' armed services at the border.Motsch (2001), p. 50 In July 1655, during the Second Northern War, Draheim was devastated by a trespassing Swedish army.Motsch (2001), p. 51 A Brandenburgian report noted that no more than 150 inhabitants remained, the rest had fled to nearby areas, but hesitated to return as they were deprived of all their means. Poland pawned Draheim to Brandenburg-Prussia in the 1657 Treaty of Bromberg. This arrangement was confirmed in the 1660 Treaty of Oliva, but Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg, did not take control of the territory until 1668. Berlin subsequently administered the territory through the office of an Amtmann, who had his seat in Draheim Castle. It was later leased to domain tenants. According to the Treaty of Bromberg, Frederick William promised not to infringe upon the rights of the Roman Catholic Church in Draheim. The number of Protestants in the territory gradually shrank. It was not until the reign of King Frederick William I of Prussia (1713-40) that a Protestant church was built in Tempelburg. Draheim's role as a fief of Poland ended with the First Partition of Poland in 1772. The territory was reorganized as part of the Province of Pomerania in 1817; Draheim was included within Landkreis Neustettin, Regierungsbezirk K√∂slin.

Personal life Booth was born September 28, 1923, in Pasadena, where he spent his youth. By age 16 he was a student at the California Institute of Technology. He earned a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering in 1944 and then served two years in the U.S. Naval Reserve. After his discharge he earned a master's degree in business administration and a graduate degree in engineering in 1948, both from Stanford University. Over the years, Booth donated to many causes including the Harvard-Westlake School and the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. He died June 15, 2008, in his home in Los Angeles from complications of ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease.

A. Attanasio, the fourth and final novel in his Radix Tetrad series. It contains the continuing story of the conflict between the humans, z≈çtl, Rimstalkers, other spatial dimensions, and time-travel/temporal distortion as do other novels in the tetrad, though this novel is set in events before In Other Worlds. The book has been republished by Phoenix Pick, an imprint of Arc Manor Publishers. Overview The novel itself is a study of time and space. It features a large cast of primary and secondary characters who inhabit the various ages and major characters who inhabit the entire novel's timespan. Events of the story occur on a 15-planet star system just outside the Milky Way Galaxy and time corridors outside normal time called the \\"Overworld\\". The primary character is a young female Rimstalker named Gai. She is assigned as the Mission Commander to lure the z≈çtl spiderfolk with intelligent life as food and also to find an artifact (the O'ode) in order to kill the z≈çtl. Ultimately, humanity is brought back from the dead as bait for the z≈çtl. Gai and the few soldiers who are left after the z≈çtl attack on the Rimstalker's world have been sent out to create artificial star systems and re-created intelligent lifeforms found in the dust of intergalactic space in order to lure z≈çtl. The Rimstalkers live on a world that is just outside a black hole that created the universe, the edge of spacetime itself. Thus meaning of Gai's people's name, the \\"Rimstalker\\", those who are living on rim of creation. This is ribbon-shaped world that is being devastated by the spider-people called the z≈çtl, for energy. Originally, the z≈çtl were unaware of the Rimstalkers, but once the z≈çtl were informed of the Rimstalker's existence, they immediately attacked populated areas in order to remove further resistance. Time in Gai's world, the Range, is distorted. Seven thousand years in real- time is a weekend in their world. The world is smaller than atom and its gravity is incredibly massive. This gravity is nothing to the inhabitants. Even though in spacetime (The void) where Gai was sent is faster than hers, time is running out for her people. The z≈çtl are devastating her world, so Gai is driven to move quickly. Piloting a special ship that can transverse the gravity well from the range to outer space where energy is easier to create, Gai sets and baits the 'trap'. She has only 7 thousand years of real time in which to find the z≈çtl's nest world before her ship has generated enough power to return home. The book is divided up by \\"Age\\", in which notable events accrue. Gai discovers a human which has been flung back from a distant time \\"Age\\" in which she is victorious. After aiding this human to try to find his lost love, She decides to track him and follow him to ensure that her future is same as the one he came from. The story builds on multiple short stories of people and events that occur in these various time periods. The stories are linked together as being significant events in Chalco-Doror's history. This is also a race to retrieve the z≈çtl killing artifact, the O'ode and stop one man who comes from the future where it all happens. The only means to find the O'ode is try to explore corridors of time in the \\"Overworld\\". This effort takes time and a fantastic amount of power and courage in order to find this artifact. Major characters ; Gai: Mission Commander of Genitrix (the Ship), young Rimstalker warrior who is willing to give up her life to avenge her family and save her people from extinction, whatever the cost. ; Genitrix: The chief Machine Intelligence \\"AI\\" of Gai's ship and the heart and soul of their mission. Designed to search, create, and re-create dead lifeforms to lure z≈çtl to their ship and search for the O'ode artifact through weaves of time. She is programmed with a poetic mind, to help her to be more flexible and creative. ; Lod: Machine Intelligence \\"AI\\" built to regulate the Chalco- Doror (Genitrix)'s engines & gravitational generators. He is an honorable individual who is dedicated to fulfilling Gai's mission. When he projects his mind in physical form, he appears to be a human-shape made of fiery gold. He is also charged with monitoring his \\"brother\\" Saor. His \\"body\\" is used as the Sun of the artificial solar system Chalco-Doror. After experiencing what the z≈çtl had done to a human that he failed to save, Lod has become fearful of being exposed to the z≈çtl. ; Saor: Machine Intelligence \\"AI\\" built to monitor and gather information. He is built into the nose cone/antenna/communication section of Genitrix/Chalco-Doror. His physical body became a miniature black hole when ship transformed into a solar system. He was taken over by a z≈çtl virus and used against Gai. He was antisocial member of Genitrix prior to his personality being re-programmed by the z≈çtl on \\"saving\\" Chalco-Doror from being destroyed. He believes himself a hero to the beings whom live in Chalco- Doror. He is used by the z≈çtl at every turn to fight the Rimstalker, Gai, whom he believes is evil. ; Ned O'Tennis: A human born during the \\"Age of Dominion\\" or the Fourth Age. He is from a technologically advanced, Viking descended warrior race known as Aesirai. He himself is poetic and dislikes how his race of people are using and abusing other human races. He falls in love with a young woman from a wandering tribe-people called the \\"Foke.\\" His honor forces him to defend his home city, N'ym, from rebel forces only be thrown back into time through an ancient link. He later becomes a time compass used by Gai to find future-timeline in which she is victorious. ; Chan-ti Beppu: A Foke tribe woman, who has fallen in love with gentle warrior Ned O'Tennis. When he is flung back in time, she along with two other volunteers begin a journey through time to rescue the time lost warrior she loves so desperately. Notes The character Reena Patai is featured in a previous Tetrad novel Arc of the Dream. She crosses through a time-portal and becomes a notable character in this novel. She is the alleged author of a book that becomes a spiritual manual for survival & guide book to the worlds and their future.

Sci. 103:19854-19859 She identified the first idiotype marker on anti-DNA antibodies in patients with lupus,Journal of Immunology, 133;1852 and discovered that anti-DNA antibodies in patients and mice shared characteristics with antibodies to pneumococcal polysaccharide. Diamond showed that a single base change in a protective anti-pneumococcal antibody could convert it into a potentially pathogenic anti-DNA antibody. She also found that a peptide that binds to 50% of anti-DNA antibodies in lupus patients and mice represents an epitope on glutamate receptors of the brain and can destroy neurons. Antibodies against the epitope are present in the cerebrospinal fluid and in brain tissue of patients with neuropsychiatric lupus. Her work provides a mechanism for aspects of neuropsychiatric lupus, and more generally for acquired changes in cognition and behavior.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. Description and history The Baxter House stands one block off the downtown area of the village of Hyannis, on the south side of South Street at its junction with Pearl Street. The house is located on the west side of its lot, with the smaller carriage house to the east. The house is two stories, with stuccoed concrete walls thick, and a bracketed flat roof topped by an octagonal cupola. Two of its eight sides have entrances: the one facing the street is a simpler entrance sheltered by a bracketed hood, while that facing east is sheltered by a single-story porch extending across that facade, with a spindled balustrade and turned posts. Most of the other facades have two windows on each level; some have only one. The interior of each level has a central square chamber, around which are four smaller rectangular chambers, with the remaining triangular spaces used as closets. The carriage house, one story in height has a similar exterior finish and a smaller footprint, and is topped by smaller octagonal cupola. A two-leaf vehicle entrance is topped by a half-round fan; both the fan and the doors have strap woodwork decoration. The octagonal carriage barn The house was built about 1850 for Rodney J. Baxter, a sea captain engaged mainly in the transatlantic trade. The house was built according to principles articulated by Orson Squire Fowler in The Octagon House, A Home for All, which formed the basis for the designs of numerous similar houses across the country. The house closely follows Fowler's guidelines, including the use of concrete for the walls. At the time of its listing on the National Register in 1987, it was still owned by Baxter's descendants.

Kohlberg & Company‚Äôs use of moderate amounts of debt financing in acquiring companies affords the financial flexibility necessary to attain these corporate objectives. The Firm has been the lead investor and controlling shareholder in all of its fund investments. History The firm was founded in 1987, when American businessman and investor Jerome Kohlberg Jr. resigned from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. over differences in strategy. Kohlberg did not favor the larger buyouts, including Beatrice Companies in 1985 and Safeway in 1986, highly leveraged transactions or hostile takeovers being pursued increasingly by KKR. Instead, Kohlberg chose to return to his roots, acquiring smaller, middle-market companies, and in 1987 he formed Kohlberg & Company along with his son James, who at that time was a KKR executive. Their intent was to concentrate on transactions that could generate returns through revenue growth and operating improvements using only moderate leverage.

Iraq declared war on the newly established Jewish state in 1948 and since then the two countries have technically been in a state of war. Iraqi forces participated in wars against Israel in 1967 and 1973. In 1981, Israel, claiming a threat to its national security, bombed an Iraqi nuclear reactor under construction at Al Tuwaitha, southeast of Baghdad, to which Iraq did not respond. During the Persian Gulf War (1990-91), Iraq fired 42 modified Scud ballistic missiles at Israel, to which Israel did not respond militarily, because of pressure from the United States not to retaliate. Iraq continues to be a strong supporter of the Arab League boycott of Israel. Iraqi passports are invalid for travel to Israel and Israeli passports are invalid for entry into Iraq. Under Israeli law, Iraq and a number of other Arab and Muslim countries are designated \\"enemy states\\" which an Israeli citizen may not visit without a special permit issued by the Israeli Interior Ministry. HistoryUntil the 2003 Iraq War= The British in the 1930s built the Mosul‚ÄìHaifa oil pipeline from Western Iraq through the British-ruled Emirate of Transjordan then to Haifa, in Mandatory Palestine. During the Anglo-Iraqi War, the Irgun - an Israeli independence movement - participated in the British invasion of Iraq. Immediately after the declaration of the establishment of the State of Israel in May 1948, Arab armies, including those of Iraq, invaded the former Mandate Palestine territory, and the oil pipeline to Haifa was shut down, and the pipeline diverted through a branch line to Tripoli in Syria. Following the war, Iraq was the only Arab country not to sign a ceasefire agreement with Israel, and the two countries have technically been in a continuous state of war since 1948. Despite not sharing a border with Israel, Iraq was an important player in the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict. Iraqi troops present in Jordan became involved in the Six-Day War in 1967, suffering 10 dead. The war ended before the Iraqis had time to undertake any serious offensive action. Iraq played a much more important role in the Yom Kippur War, when it sent 30,000 men, 250‚Äì500 tanks, and 700 APCs to the Syrian front just as the Syrians were on the verge of collapse. Combined Syrian, Iraqi and Jordanian counterattacks prevented the Israelis from advancing further into Syria, but failed to push the Israelis back. The war ended in an Arab defeat, with Israeli forces standing 40 km from Damascus. Under Saddam Hussein's rule, Israel regarded Iraq as a major security threat. Military action was taken by Israel when they bombed Iraq's Osirak nuclear reactor in 1981, citing that Saddam Hussein might use it to develop nuclear weapons. Iraq, busy with the Iran‚ÄìIraq War, did not respond. Throughout the war, Israel provided clandestine support to Iran, viewing Iraq as a more serious threat than Iran. During the Gulf War in 1991, without provocation, Iraq fired 42 Scud missiles at Israel, aiming to drag Israel into the war and thus imperil the US-led coalition, in which several Arab countries participated. Upon urging by the United States of Israel to stay out of the war, Israel did not retaliate. According to British author Nigel Ashton, in 1995, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin sent a message to Hussein through King Hussein of Jordan requesting a meeting between him and Hussein. Rabin hoped peace with Iraq might encourage Iran and Syria to do the same. Rabin was assassinated in November, ending the contact between the two governments. Rabin had previously supervised Operation Bramble Bush, a failed 1992 plan to assassinate Hussein with Sayeret Matkal commandos. Saddam Hussein was widely revered in Arab world for his pro-Palestinian stance and he supported several Palestinian guerrilla and militant organisations. During the second Palestinian intifada, Iraq gave monetary support to the families of Palestinian martyrs, including suicide bombers. =Since the 2003 war in Iraq= In 2003, a US-UK led coalition of nations toppled Hussein's government in an effort called Operation Iraqi Freedom. Although Israel was not included in the coalition, there were indications of its support. According to John Kerry, Netanyahu (as a private citizen) was profoundly forward-leaning and outspoken about the importance of invading Iraq. It was reported in the Washington Post that Israel is urging United States' officials not to delay a military strike against Iraq's Saddam Hussein It was also reported that Israeli intelligence provided Washington with alarming reports about Iraq's alleged program to develop weapons of mass destruction. On the contrary, some have argued that Israel did not have much role in pushing for the war. According to former US Undersecretary of Defense Douglas Feith, Israeli officials did not push their US counterparts to initiate the war in Iraq. In an interview with Ynet, Feith stated that \\"what you heard from the Israelis was not any kind of advocacy of war with Iraq\\" and that \\"[w]hat you heard from Israeli officials in private discussions was that they were not really focused on Iraq... [t]hey were much more focused on Iran.\\" Former Iraqi Prime Minister Ayad Allawi said in 2004 that Iraq would not reconcile its differences with Israel. On 1 July 2008, Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak shook hands and met briefly with Iraqi President Jalal Talabani at a conference of Socialist International in Greece. Barak and Talabani were both at the conference as representatives of their respective political parties, Labour and Patriotic Union of Kurdistan. Iraqi MP Mithal al-Alusi has twice visited Israel; once in 2004 and again in 2008, drawing protest from many in the Iraqi government. He has called for diplomatic relations and military intelligence sharing between Iraq and Israel.Iraq may execute MP for Israel visit, Jerusalem Post, 22 September 2008Iraqi court clears lawmaker of charge of visiting Israel: his lawyer, Xinhua, 24 November 2008 During the Gaza War (2008‚Äì09), the Iraqi government condemned Israel for the attack, stating that: \\"the Iraqi government demands a halt to the military operations, that civilians‚Äô lives are not unnecessarily exposed to danger and requests that the international community honour its responsibilities and take the required measures to stop the attack\\". The Dawa Party of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki called on Islamic countries to cut relations with Israel and end all \\"secret and public talks\\" with it. Also, the Iraqi Shia leader Ali al-Sistani, has called for decisive action by Arab and Muslim states for an end to Israeli attacks on Gaza.

Sir Lowry's Pass is a mountain pass on the N2 national road in the Western Cape province of South Africa. It crosses the Hottentots-Holland mountain range between Somerset West and the Elgin valley, on the main national road between Cape Town and the Garden Route. A railway line also crosses the mountain range at this point. The pass is 4 lanes wide and is subject to heavy traffic, especially at the start and end of holiday periods when many people travel in and out of the Cape Town area, and is sometimes seen as an accident black spot. The summit of the pass is at 920m. There is a viewpoint at the summit and this point is also used as a paragliding launch point. Baboons are often seen in this area. The top of the pass was formerly the start of the Boland Hiking Trail, but this section of the trail was closed after a number of deaths due to the difficult hiking conditions. On the Grabouw side, the road passes the Steenbras Dam. Sir Lowry's Pass Village is situated near the base of the pass. History The mountain crossing in that region was known by the indigenous Khoi people as the Gantouw or Eland's Pass, and was used as a stock route. The Dutch and British settlers at the Cape built a rough pass called the Hottentots Holland Kloof Pass following the Gantouw route. The first recorded crossing was in 1664, and by 1821 the pass was seeing 4500 ox-wagons per year crossing into the interior, but the route was so severe that more than 20% of them were damaged. The ruts left by these wagons being dragged over the mountains can still be seen, and were declared a National Monument in 1958. Starting in 1828, a new pass was constructed on the current route that would allow ox wagons to navigate the pass without difficulty. Construction began at a site about 2 km to the south of the Hottentots Holland Kloof, by the engineer Charles Michell using convict labour. The new pass was opened on 6 July 1830, and named after Lowry Cole, the Governor of the Cape Colony at the time. The initial estimated cost of the project at the time was ¬£2,672 8s and 6d (equivalent to ¬£10,300,000 or R220,000,000 in 2014) with an actual cost upon completion of ¬£3,000 (equivalent to ¬£11,580,000 or R256,000,000 in 2014). A toll-house was set-up on the top of mountain to offset the cost of the project to the Cape government collecting ¬£490 in its first two years in addition to additional indirect tax revenue derived from increased use of port facilities and other tolls as a result of the increase in economic activity the pass created. The pass remained unchanged until a railway line to Caledon that runs parallel to the road was built in 1902 and a level crossing halfway up the road's incline was built. The road remained narrow to the extent that vehicles could only pass each other at selected points on the pass. In the 1930s, the pass was widened and tarred; it was further improved in the 1956 when it was further widened. In 1984 the upper parts were widened to four lanes in a reinforced concrete construction at a cost of R4.5 million.

It is best known brand is the Quesada, Casa Magna, Heisenberg & Fonseca line of cigars. Its current president and owner is Manuel \\"Manolo\\" Quesada, Jr. HistoryQuesada family= The Quesada family has been a part of the tobacco world for over a century. When they first arrived in Cuba from Spain they were bakers.Frank Seltzer, \\"Quesada's Quest for Quality,\\" Cigar Magazine, vol. 4, no. 3 (Fall 2007), pp. 82-91. It was in the late 1800s that they began their tobacco business when a debt to the family was paid with tobacco. Antero Gonzales and his brother Constantino started a leaf purchasing company, working as tobacco brokers. At the beginning of the century the brothers split ways and established separate companies and became the two largest exporters of Cuban tobacco, from Cuba to international markets. They have been competing in the world market ever since through several generations. A daughter of Antero Gonzalez married a man named Agustin Quesada, who worked his way up the ranks and ultimately too over the brokerage. These would be the parents of a boy named Manuel Quesada, who was in turn the father of Manuel Quesada, Jr. ‚Äî the current head of MATASA. In 1929, in searching for new and different tobaccos, the Quesada family arrived in the Dominican Republic for the first time. They discovered new tobacco strains there, which were sold profitably to European companies for the manufacture of cigars and cigarettes. While some of its tobacco continued to come from the Dominican Republic, the company remained based in Havana, Cuba. =Exile= The Cuban Revolution of 1960 forced the Quesada family into exile, with Manuel Sr. taking the family, including his 13-year-old son Manolo, to a new life in Santiago in the Dominican Republic. Here Manuel Quesada y Gonzalez bought warehouses and established a new tobacco brokerage in 1961, called Manipuladora de Tobaco. Manolo was sent to attend high school in Miami. Following completion of his high school studies, Manolo went to work in the family business, where part of his job entailed smoking the various varieties of tobacco so as to better describe them to prospective customers. This lead Manolo to become interested in the art of tobacco blending and the idea of becoming a manufacturer of cigars himself. Manolo Quesada became close to a small scale customer of his family's, Juan Sosa, who worked as a cigar manufacturer in Miami, producing a brand called Antillian Cigars. Due to an aging population of experienced cigar-rollers (torcedores) and an increasingly unfavorable employment tax situation, the Sosa operation was joined with Quesada's brokerage, with Quesada handling manufacturing in the Dominican Republic while Sosa remained as the American distributor of the finished product. =Establishment of Manufactura de Tabacos S.A.= A new company was formed by Quesada to handle the manufacture of Antillian Cigars. This new firm, Manufactura de Tabacos, S.A. (commonly known by the acronym MATASA), was established in a new free trade zone in Santiago in June 1974. The company began as a small operation with \\"$100, a chair, and a phone,\\" employing just three rollers.David Savona, \\"Q & A: An Interview with Manuel Quesada,\\" Cigar Aficionado, June 1, 2004. Soon there were 35 rollers producing the Fonseca and Sosa brands for Antillian. Total production in the first year was just 20,000 cigars. MATASA soon underwent a period of expansion, taking over the production of the Ricardo Samuel line on behalf of a major cigar wholesaler of the day, Faber, Coe & Gregg. Additional rollers were hired and trained and within a few years MATASA was producing over 1 million cigars per year. In addition to the products it made for others under contract, the company launched its own brand, called Jos√© Benito. Following the purchase of the non- Cuban version of the Romeo y Julieta brand by Hollco-Rohr, a contract was made with MATASA for production of the line in the Dominican Republic. The cash infusion associated with this expansion enabled MATASA to open its own box factory in 1978. In 1982, cigarmaker Santa Clara, Inc. contracted with MATASA for production of another 1 million cigars in its expanding Santiago operation. In 1984, a further contract was obtained for the production of the Licensiados brand. MATASA continued a period of steady growth for the rest of the decade of the 1980s. =MATASA in the \\"Cigar Boom\\"= For a period of about five years beginning at the end of 1992 the United States experienced a sudden and massive growth in the popularity of premium cigars. The mad demand associated with this so-called \\"Cigar Boom\\" taxed available stocks of every necessary component and pushed production to the limit. New brands and manufacturing facilities sprung up overnight in attempt to capitalize on the faddish demand for cigars in America. Whereas prior to the boom there were approximately a dozen cigar factories in Santiago, near the end of the boom- and-bust cycle in 1997 there were more than 120. While the demand for finished cigars immediately disposed of all production, Manolo Quesada remembers the period as a trying time: > \\"Everybody who came [to the manufacturing in the Dominican Republic] came to > take from us. We lost everything ‚Äî cellophane, boxes, tobacco, bands, > everything. No one was geared to supply the vast amounts of product that was > being demanded.... We told them, 'Take what you want...' We would just train > more rollers, protect our farms better, [and] make box factories.\\" Prices for components skyrocketed, but MATASA carried on without dramatically increasing the price of its product. Ultimately, the Cigar Boom played itself out, with supply outstripping flagging demand and the vast majority of the fly-by-night cigarmakers who began in the early 1990s going out of business. MATASA was among those surviving the cigar bust of the late 1990s. The company suffered an additional hit towards the end of the 1990s when Romeo y Julieta ended its manufacturing relationship with the firm. In 1998, Manolo Quesada's father, Manuel Senior, who had been running the company's leaf brokerage business, died. Faced with difficulty in competing with brokerages in other parts of the Caribbean, Central and South America, the wholesaling of tobacco leaf by MATASA's sibling company, Manipuladora de Tobaccos, was gradually curtailed. The company was particularly hindered by a 35% tax levied by the Dominican government upon exports. =The Early 2000s= Manolo Quesada assembled a new management team around him which included general manager Julio Fajardo, Manolo's brother Alvaro, who as vice president was in charge of the company's farms and fledgling cigarette operation,Mike Jessee, \\"A Unique Vantage Point,\\" Smoke Magazine, vol. 5, no. 2 (Spring 2000). and his nephew Alvarito. Unfortunately, in April 2002 a plane crash took the lives of all three, leaving Manolo to run the company. Today Manolo Quesada works with two daughters ‚Äî Patricia and Raquel, niece Esther and nephew Hostos. More than 300 people work in MATASA's Santiago manufacturing facility. The company produced approximately 15 million cigars in the year 2000. The company's best selling brands are Casa Magna & Quesada Cigars,best known in the medium to full bodied segment and also Fonseca (non-Cuban version), a brand best known for products in the mild-to-medium segment of the taste spectrum. =The Company Today, now known as Quesada Cigars= In 2014 the Quesada family was proud to celebrate the 40th Anniversary of their factory in the Dominican Republic. Manuel Quesada opened up his Matasa facility in 1974 with a roller, a desk, and a telephone. Forty years and millions of cigars later, the Quesada family continues to thrive, making some of the finest, most reputable cigars in the world. There have been many changes over the years through challenges and triumphs, booms and busts, celebrations and tragedies. The only constant has been Manuel‚Äôs love for tobacco, a passion that he has passed on to his daughters, niece and nephews who now work alongside him. To celebrate this milestone, the Quesadas will be implementing many exciting changes. The first of these will be a new name: the Matasa factory and their current distribution company in the United States, SAG Imports, will now be collectively known as Quesada Cigars.

Origins and education Lovell was the son of Benjamin Lovell, rector of Lapworth, Warwickshire, and brother of Robert Lovell, and was born in 1631 or 1632. Aside from his religious calling, his father was a parliamentarian in the English Civil War, serving for a time under Colonel William Purefoy, one of the regicides of King Charles I of England. Salathiel Lovell was accepted into Gray's Inn to read for the Bar in 1648. He worked as a clerk in Buckinghamshire, and as one of the parish trustees of parish lands in Lapworth, before being called to the bar in November 1656. Career He had moved to Northampton by 1661, as evidenced by baptism records for a son, also called Salathiel; was active in the factional politics of the town, and was relied upon as a legal authority, becoming the deputy Recorder of the town. He was active, too, within Gray's Inn, being appointed an ancient of the inn (a junior official role) in 1671 and six years later a bencher, or member of the controlling committee of the Inn. Lovell clearly accommodated himself to the changing post-restoration times, but was suspected of radical whig politics by reason of his alleged involvement, in 1684, in the promulgation of an attack on acquiescence to the concept of the divine rights of kings. In the same year he was counsel for William Sacheverell, a prominent whig, who with others was indicted for a riot at an election for the mayoralty of Nottingham. In June 1688 he became a serjeant-at-law, and four years later he was a candidate against James Selby for the recordership of London. Each candidate obtained twelve votes, and Lovell was elected by the casting vote of the Lord Mayor. On 22 October 1692 he carried up an address of congratulation to William III of England at Kensington Palace on his return from abroad, and an invitation to a banquet at the Guildhall on Lord Mayor's Day, and was thereupon knighted. In 1695, on 24 May, the first day of term, he was called within the bar as king's serjeant, and in the following year became a judge on the Welsh circuit. He continued to be principally occupied with the administration of the criminal law, and in 1700 he petitioned the crown for a grant of the forfeited estate of Joseph Horton of Cotton Abbotts in Cheshire, on the ground that he had been more diligent in the discovery and conviction of criminals than any other person in the kingdom, and that he had been a loser by it, his post only being worth ¬£80 annually (¬£ in ), with few perquisites, and usually being regarded as a mere stepping-stone to a judgeship in Westminster Hall. In June 1700, when the retirement of Baron Lechmere as a Baron of the Exchequer was expected, Lovell was looked on as his successor, but he continued without reward until he was appointed a fifth baron of the exchequer on 17 June 1708, at the age of 76. He had resigned his Welsh judgeship in the previous year, and now vacated the recordership. Judicial reputation Lovell had a reputation for being both corrupt and sadistic. The writer and pamphleteer Daniel Defoe wrote of him: :\\"He trades in Justice and the Souls of Men, :And prostitutes them equally to Gain.\\" Unfortunately for Defoe, Lovell later presided over a trial in which Defoe was found guilty of seditious libel. He sentenced Defoe to pay an impossibly punitive fine, be publicly humiliated for days in a pillory and to serve an indeterminate term of imprisonment; decreeing that Defoe be set free only once he had paid the fine. Defoe's financial circumstances were such that he was unable to pay the fine. Lovell had deliberately structured the punishment to maximise the possibility that Defoe would remain incarcerated for the rest of his life. Lovell also had a reputation for being incompetent. He was 'distinguished principally for his want of memory, and his title of recorder was converted into the nickname of the Obliviscor (forgetter) of London'. Lovell's great-grandson, Richard Lovell Edgeworth, referring to the extent to which Lovell, by the end of his life, had lost his memory, related an anecdote told by his father of a lawyer pleading before Lovell being so rude as to say \\"Sir, you have forgotten the law\\", to which Lovell is reputed to have answered \\"Young man, I have forgotten more law, than you will ever remember\\".Memoirs of Richard Lovell Edgeworth, Esq. by Richard Lovell Edgeworth and Maria Edgeworth, Volume 1, 1821 List of prominent people sentenced by Lovell *Daniel Defoe the writer, journalist and pamphleteer. After Defoe was convicted of seditious libel, Lovell sentenced him to a fine, public humiliation for days in a pillory, and an indeterminate term of imprisonment. *John Law the Scottish economist and financier. After Law was convicted of murdering Edward 'Beau' Wilson in a duel, Lovell sentenced him to death. Family and posterity Lovell was married some time before 1661 to Mary; the couple had some ten sons and four daughters. He died 3 May 1713. A son, Samuel, became a Welsh judge; but only one of the sons outlived Salathiel. Richard Lovell Edgeworth, in his memoirs, provided an impression of Samuel Lovell: :\\"My grandfather, the Welsh (sic) judge, travelling over the sands near Beaumaris, as he was going circuit, was overtaken by the night and by the tide: his coach was set fast in quicksand; the water soon rose into the coach, and his register, and some other attendants, crept out of the windows and mounted on the roof, and on the coach-box. The judge let the water rise to his very lips, and with becoming gravity replied, to all the earnest entreaties of his attendants, 'I will follow your counsel, if you can quote any precedent for a judge's mounting a coach-box'\\" See also * William Chaloner References ;Attribution Category:1631 births Category:1713 deaths Category:English barristers Category:English judges Category:Members of Gray's Inn Category:Knights Bachelor Category:Serjeants-at-law (England) Category:Barons of the Exchequer Category:People from Warwickshire Category:People from Northampton Category:Lawyers from London ","title":"Salathiel Lovell"},{"id":"18010182","text":"Cassady is a grape variety which is greenish-white in color.

The first Cassady grapevine sprang up as a volunteer (unplanted) seedling in the yard of P.H. Cassady at 29 Logan Square, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1847. It did not bear fruit for five years, but when it finally did, the grapes it produced were found by Cassady to be juicy, pleasantly flavoured, and of very good quality. The Cassady grape was propagated and subsequently crossed with the better-known Concord grape to produce a new white grape variety, the Niagara grape, which is the cultivar most commonly used for the production of white grape juice in North America.

Illegal Art originally released the album as a digital download through their website using a \\"pay what you want\\" pricing system. Like much of his previous work, Gillis composed Feed the Animals almost entirely using samples of other artists' music and minor elements of his own original instrumentation. Background Gillis stated that with Feed the Animals, he wanted to produce an album \\"you can sit down, relax, and listen to over and over again, finding out new things\\", in contrast with the fast-paced, frenetic nature of his live performances. Feed the Animals builds on the mashup format of previous Girl Talk albums, with Gillis using over 300 samples of music by other artists to compose the album's fourteen tracks. He produced the album as one long piece of music, which was then subsequently broken into individual songs. Gillis felt that the album \\"works towards a bigger whole\\" and initially considered releasing the album as a single piece without track divisions, but ultimately decided against the idea, as he felt that \\"the end of the album would get so neglected, and if your favorite moment was a 30-second bit at the 40-minute mark, it would be really annoying to have that.\\" Release On June 19, 2008, Feed the Animals was made available for download by Girl Talk's record label, Illegal Art, sells Feed the Animals using a \\"pay what you want\\" system for non-seamless MP3 files.

Truman Historic District is a National Historic Landmark District encompassing sites closely associated with US President Harry S. Truman in Independence, Missouri. It includes the Truman Home at 219 North Delaware, Truman's home for much of his adult life and now a centerpiece of the Harry S. Truman National Historic Site, and the Truman Presidential Library. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1974. When first listed, the district included only the two buildings and a corridor joining them. It was substantially enlarged in 2011 to include more sites and the environment in which Truman operated while living in Independence. History Wallace House (also called the Truman Home), 219 North Delaware Street, Independence, Missouri, would be the home of Harry S. Truman, on-and-off, after his marriage to Bess Wallace, on June 28, 1919 until his death on December 26, 1972. Bess Truman's maternal grandfather, George Porterfield Gates, built the house over a period of years from 1867 to 1895. Bess's mother, Madge Gates Wallace, wanted the couple to live there with her. Bess had lived with her mother after Bess's father, David Willock Wallace, committed suicide in 1903, both of them moving in with Madge's parents. Also in 1919, Harry was putting all of his money into the men's clothing store of Truman & Jacobson open at 104 West 12th St. in downtown Kansas City, so living at the Wallace home made good financial sense. After the haberdashery failed, in 1922, Harry and Bess could not afford to move to a new home. So they would continue living there while Harry paid off the debts from the store. That same year he went into politics, and would eventually move to Washington, D.C. Whenever they came back to Missouri, the Wallace House was their home. The Trumans' only child Mary Margaret was born in the home on February 17, 1924. The site also includes the two adjacent homes of Mrs. Truman's brothers, and, across Delaware Street, the home of the President's favorite aunt and cousins. Guided tours of the site are conducted, and a visitor's center is housed in a nearby historic firehouse. After he retired in 1953, until the Truman Library was opened on July 6, 1957, the Wallace House was also his office. Truman is one of the few Presidents who never owned a home. He would live with family members in his early life, then the Wallace House, rented apartments and houses in Washington (including 4701 Connecticut Avenue), Blair House (the official state visitors' residence), and the White House, but never a house that he had purchased.

Beasley has spent four seasons as a coach at the Major League level. In 2006, he worked as the third- base coach for the Nationals under manager Frank Robinson. He then returned to the Pittsburgh Pirates' organization, where he had spent nearly all of his career to that point, spending the 2007 season as the Pirates' Minor League Infield Coordinator, a role in which he was instrumental in prospect Neil Walker's transition from catcher to third base during spring training. The following year Beasley returned to major-league coaching as the third-base coach on manager John Russell's staff, and he continued in that role until the end of the 2010 season. In total, Beasley spent 18 years with the Pittsburgh organization. Beasley spent five seasons as a manager in the Pirates' farm system, guiding his club to the post-season in all five years and a combined record of 372-258 (.590 winning pct.) during the regular season. He was tabbed by Baseball America as the Double-A Manager-of-the-Year in 2004 after guiding Altoona to the Eastern League championship series (his team lost to New Hampshire). Beasley also served the United States National Team as a coach at the MLB Futures Game in Houston during All-Star week in 2004. In , Beasley returned to the Nationals as manager of the Double-A Harrisburg Senators; then, in ‚Äì, he skippered Washington's top affiliate, the Syracuse Chiefs of the Triple-A International League. The following year, in 2014, Beasley was the co-field-coordinator of instruction in the Washington Nationals' minor- league system.Nats Insider.com In addition to his regular season managerial duties, Beasley also managed the Mesa Desert Dogs during the Arizona Fall League in 2004, guiding the club to an 18-13 record and a first-place finish in the National Division (his club lost out to the Mesa Solar Sox in the Championship Series). After serving as a player/coach for the AA Carolina Mudcats and the Class A Lynchburg Hillcats in 1998, Beasley began his full- time coaching career as the Hitting Coach with the GCL Pirates in 1999. He worked in the same capacity with Lynchburg in 2000. Personal life On February 19, 2016, Beasley was diagnosed with rectal cancer, forcing him to miss the start of the 2016 season. He was declared cancer-free in December 2016.

Let each datum be a finite binary string and a model be a finite set of binary strings. Consider model classes consisting of models of given maximal Kolmogorov complexity. The Kolmogorov structure function of an individual data string expresses the relation between the complexity level constraint on a model class and the least log-cardinality of a model in the class containing the data. The structure function determines all stochastic properties of the individual data string: for every constrained model class it determines the individual best-fitting model in the class irrespective of whether the true model is in the model class considered or not. In the classical case we talk about a set of data with a probability distribution, and the properties are those of the expectations. In contrast, here we deal with individual data strings and the properties of the individual string focused on. In this setting, a property holds with certainty rather than with high probability as in the classical case. The Kolmogorov structure function precisely quantifies the goodness-of-fit of an individual model with respect to individual data. The Kolmogorov structure function is used in the algorithmic information theory, also known as the theory of Kolmogorov complexity, for describing the structure of a string by use of models of increasing complexity.  Kolmogorov's definition Kolmogorov (left) talks on the structure function (see drawing on the blackboard) in (Tallinn, 1973). The structure function was originally proposed by Kolmogorov in 1973 at a Soviet Information Theory symposium in Tallinn, but these results were not published p. 182\\\\. But the results were announced inAbstract of a talk for the Moscow Mathematical Society in Uspekhi Mat. Nauk Volume 29, Issue 4(178) in the Communications of the Moscow Mathematical Society page 155 (in the Russian edition, not translated into English) in 1974, the only written record by Kolmogorov himself. One of his last scientific statements is (translated from the original Russian by L.A. Levin): Contemporary definition It is discussed in Cover and Thomas. It is extensively studied in Vereshchagin and Vit√°nyi where also the main properties are resolved. The Kolmogorov structure function can be written as : h_{x}(\\\\alpha) = \\\\min_S \\\\\\\\{\\\\log S : x \\\\in S , K(S) \\\\leq \\\\alpha \\\\\\\\} where x is a binary string of length n with x \\\\in S where S is a contemplated model (set of n-length strings) for x, K(S) is the Kolmogorov complexity of S and \\\\alpha is a nonnegative integer value bounding the complexity of the contemplated S's. Clearly, this function is nonincreasing and reaches \\\\log \\\\\\\\{x\\\\\\\\} =0 for \\\\alpha = K(x)+c where c is the required number of bits to change x into \\\\\\\\{x\\\\\\\\} and K(x) is the Kolmogorov complexity of x. =The algorithmic sufficient statistic= We define a set S containing x such that :K(S)+K(xS)=K(x)+O(1). The function h_x(\\\\alpha) never decreases more than a fixed independent constant below the diagonal called sufficiency line L defined by :L(\\\\alpha)+\\\\alpha = K(x). It is approached to within a constant distance by the graph of h_x for certain arguments (for instance, for \\\\alpha = K(x)+c). For these \\\\alpha's we have \\\\alpha + h_x (\\\\alpha) = K(x)+O(1) and the associated model S (witness for h_x(\\\\alpha)) is called an optimal set for x, and its description of K(S)\\\\leq \\\\alpha bits is therefore an algorithmic sufficient statistic. We write \`algorithmic' for \`Kolmogorov complexity' by convention. The main properties of an algorithmic sufficient statistic are the following: If S is an algorithmic sufficient statistic for x, then :K(S)+\\\\log S = K(x)+O(1). That is, the two-part description of x using the model S and as data-to-model code the index of x in the enumeration of S in \\\\log S bits, is as concise as the shortest one-part code of x in K(x) bits. This can be easily seen as follows: :K(x) \\\\leq K(x,S) +O(1) \\\\leq K(S)+K(xS)+O(1) \\\\leq K(S)+\\\\logS+O(1) \\\\leq K(x)+O(1), Structure functions h_x(\\\\alpha), \\\\beta_x(\\\\alpha), \\\\lambda_x(\\\\alpha) and minimal sufficient statistic. using straightforward inequalities and the sufficiency property, we find that K(xS)=\\\\log S +O(1). (For example, given S i x, we can describe x self-delimitingly (you can determine its end) in \\\\log S+O(1) bits.) Therefore, the randomness deficiency \\\\log S-K(xS) of x in S is a constant, which means that x is a typical (random) element of S. However, there can be models S containing x that are not sufficient statistics. An algorithmic sufficient statistic S for x has the additional property, apart from being a model of best fit, that K(x,S)=K(x)+O(1) and therefore by the Kolmogorov complexity symmetry of information (the information about x in S is about the same as the information about S in x) we have K(Sx^*)=O(1): the algorithmic sufficient statistic S is a model of best fit that is almost completely determined by x. (x^* is a shortest program for x.) The algorithmic sufficient statistic associated with the least such \\\\alpha is called the algorithmic minimal sufficient statistic. With respect to the picture: The MDL structure function \\\\lambda_x(\\\\alpha) is explained below. The Goodness-of-fit structure function \\\\beta_x(\\\\alpha) is the least randomness deficiency (see above) of any model S i x for x such that K(S) \\\\leq \\\\alpha. This structure function gives the goodness-of-fit of a model S (containing x) for the string x. When it is low the model fits well, and when it is high the model doesn't fit well. If \\\\beta_x (\\\\alpha) =0 for some \\\\alpha then there is a typical model S i x for x such that K(S) \\\\leq \\\\alpha and x is typical (random) for S. That is, S is the best-fitting model for x. For more details see and especially and. =Selection of properties= Within the constraints that the graph goes down at an angle of at least 45 degrees, that it starts at n and ends approximately at K(x), every graph (up to a O(\\\\log n) additive term in argument and value) is realized by the structure function of some data x and vice versa. Where the graph hits the diagonal first the argument (complexity) is that of the minimum sufficient statistic. It is incomputable to determine this place. See. =Main property= It is proved that at each level \\\\alpha of complexity the structure function allows us to select the best model S for the individual string x within a strip of O(\\\\log n) with certainty, not with great probability. The MDL variant The Minimum description length (MDL) function: The length of the minimal two-part code for x consisting of the model cost K(S) and the length of the index of x in S, in the model class of sets of given maximal Kolmogorov complexity \\\\alpha, the complexity of S upper bounded by \\\\alpha, is given by the MDL function or constrained MDL estimator: : \\\\lambda_{x}(\\\\alpha) = \\\\min_{S} \\\\\\\\{\\\\Lambda(S): S i x,\\\\; K(S) \\\\leq \\\\alpha\\\\\\\\}, where \\\\Lambda(S)=\\\\logS+K(S) \\\\ge K(x)-O(1) is the total length of two-part code of x with help of model S. =Main property= It is proved that at each level \\\\alpha of complexity the structure function allows us to select the best model S for the individual string x within a strip of O(\\\\log n) with certainty, not with great probability. =Application in statistics= The mathematics developed above were taken as the foundation of MDL by its inventor Jorma Rissanen. Probability models For every computable probability distribution P it can be provedA.Kh. Shen, The concept of (Œ±, Œ≤)-stochasticity in the Kolmogorov sense, and its properties, Soviet Math. Dokl., 28:1(1983), 295--299 that : -\\\\log P(x) = \\\\log S+O(\\\\log n). For example, if P is some computable distribution on the set S of strings of length n, then each x \\\\in S has probability P(x)=\\\\exp(O(\\\\log n))/S=n^{O(1)}/S. Kolmogorov's structure function becomes : h'_{x}(\\\\alpha) = \\\\min_P \\\\\\\\{-\\\\log P(x) : P(x)>0, K(P) \\\\leq \\\\alpha \\\\\\\\} where x is a binary string of length n with -\\\\log P(x)>0 where P is a contemplated model (computable probability of n-length strings) for x, K(P) is the Kolmogorov complexity of P and \\\\alpha is an integer value bounding the complexity of the contemplated P's. Clearly, this function is non-increasing and reaches \\\\log \\\\\\\\{x\\\\\\\\} =0 for \\\\alpha = K(x)+c where c is the required number of bits to change x into \\\\\\\\{x\\\\\\\\} and K(x) is the Kolmogorov complexity of x. Then h'_{x}(\\\\alpha)=h_{x}(\\\\alpha)+O(\\\\log n). For every complexity level \\\\alpha the function h'_{x}(\\\\alpha) is the Kolmogorov complexity version of the maximum likelihood (ML). =Main property= It is proved that at each level \\\\alpha of complexity the structure function allows us to select the best model S for the individual string x within a strip of O(\\\\log n) with certainty, not with great probability. The MDL variant and probability models The MDL function: The length of the minimal two-part code for x consisting of the model cost K(P) and the length of \\\\- \\\\log P(x), in the model class of computable probability mass functions of given maximal Kolmogorov complexity \\\\alpha, the complexity of P upper bounded by \\\\alpha, is given by the MDL function or constrained MDL estimator: : \\\\lambda'_{x}(\\\\alpha) = \\\\min_{P} \\\\\\\\{\\\\Lambda(P): P(x)> 0,\\\\; K(P) \\\\leq \\\\alpha\\\\\\\\}, where \\\\Lambda(P)=-\\\\log P(x)+K(P) \\\\geq K(x)-O(1) is the total length of two-part code of x with help of model P. =Main property= It is proved that at each level \\\\alpha of complexity the MDL function allows us to select the best model P for the individual string x within a strip of O(\\\\log n) with certainty, not with great probability. Extension to rate distortion and denoising It turns out that the approach can be extended to a theory of rate distortion of individual finite sequences and denoising of individual finite sequences using Kolmogorov complexity. Experiments using real compressor programs have been carried out with success. Here the assumption is that for natural data the Kolmogorov complexity is not far from the length of a compressed version using a good compressor.

It does not follow the highest ground, and the eastern section is only a few feet above sea level. It keeps to the northern edge of the High Weald except in the west where it runs close to the southern edge for a short distance. The HWLT is not a National Trail within the meaning of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949, but a trail of regional importance supported by the High Weald Forum and local authorities in East and West Sussex, and Kent. The route is well signposted in all but a few places, and is marked on the Ordnance Survey Explorer Maps 134, 135, 136 and 125. It follows public rights of way and roads with the occasional permissive path. The geology is alternating sandstones and clays, and the latter can be very muddy in wet conditions so boots are a must except in very dry weather. Some sections become very overgrown in summer with nettles and brambles so shorts are not advisable. The official description of the route, and the landscapes it passes through, are described an online guide available from the High Weald AONB website (see external links)http://www.highweald.org/explore/walking-and-cycling/long- distance-walks/625-high-weald-landscape-trail.html which was updated in 2013. The original guide, \\"Along and Around the High Weald Landscape Trail\\",\\"Along and Around the High Weald Landscape Trail\\" published by the High Weald Forum in May 1999, is long out of print. Route The route is divided into seven sections, each of which starts and ends in a small town or village and can be walked in a day. Each of the seven sections lies predominantly in one of the areas into which the High Weald AONB is subdivided, each having its own dominant landscape (the route does not pass through Ashdown, the Southern Slopes or the Upper Rother areas). The first two sections are in West Sussex in the Western High Weald Area. =Section 1= Section 1 starts at Horsham railway station, and follows a road through a residential area to St Leonard's Forest which is crossed from west to east near Handcross, then turns south through Slaugham to Bolney, and then east to Cuckfield. =Section 2= Section 2 runs NE from Cuckfield through Borde Hill and Ardingly College with a link path to Haywards Heath, and then north to West Hoathly, east past Stone Farm Rocks and Weirwood Reservoir, and north past Standen and Saint Hill Green to East Grinstead station. =Section 3= Section 3 is mainly in East Sussex in the Upper Medway Area. The Forest Way, a path along the old Three Bridges to Tunbridge Wells Central Line, is followed to Forest Row, but the route then runs north of the line in an arc crossing it at Hartfield, through Withyham to Groombridge. The high ground of Ashdown Forest is to the south. =Section 4= Section 4 is in Kent in the Central High Weald area and coincides with the High Weald Walk from Groombridge Place via Harrisons Rocks, Eridge Rocks, High Rocks, Frant, Hawkenbury (from where a link path goes into Tunbridge Wells) and Pembury, to the east of which the High Weald Walk is left, and the route heads east to Matfield. =Section 5= Section 5 is in the Kentish High Weald through orchards via Brenchley, Sprivers Garden, Goudhurst, Cranbrook, Benenden to Rolvenden. =Section 6= Section 6 is in The Kentish High Weald but on leaving Rolvenden the trail drops to within a few feet of sea level before climbing to Tenterden, and turns south past Chapel Down vineyard and Smallhythe Place which was once the harbour master's house of one of England's major ports. It crosses the Isle of Oxney via Wittersham, and joins the Sussex Border Path at the River Rother (crossing back into East Sussex) before climbing to Flackley Ash. =Section 7= Section 7 is in the Brede Area of the Sussex High Weald and passes through Peasmarsh before dropping down to near sea level and its termination at Strand Quay, Rye. Other recognised paths It runs close to or crosses several other long distance paths, from west to east: *Downs Link is some 2 miles west of Horsham *Crosses the Sussex Ouse Valley Way south of Handcross *Runs along the Sussex Border Path in several places including south of East Grinstead and north of Rye *Passes the eastern end of the Worth Way at East Grinstead station *Runs along Forest Way to the SE of East Grinstead, crosses it at Hartfield and passes its eastern end at Groombridge *Crosses the Vanguard Way at Forest Row *Crosses the Wealdway at Withyham *Runs along the southern part of the High Weald Walk south of Tunbridge Wells *Rye is the western end of Saxon Shore Way and the eastern end of the 1066 Country Walk *Rye is also on the Royal Military Canal Path References External links  *High Weald AONB - Homepage of walk with PDF guide and maps *Saturday Walkers Club - Has GPS route of the walk and Ordnance Survey maps *Kent Council site with info on the walk Category:Long- distance footpaths in England Category:Footpaths in Kent Category:Footpaths in East Sussex Category:Footpaths in West Sussex ","title":"High Weald Landscape Trail"},{"id":"18010358","text":"The Norman B.

The musket design was offered by Belton to the newly formed Continental Congress in 1777. Belton wrote that the musket could fire eight rounds with one loading,Diamant, Lincoln (2004). Chaining the Hudson: The Fight for the River in the American Revolution. New York: Fordham University Press, p. 210. and that he could support his claims \\"by experimental proof.\\"Peterson, Harold Leslie (1956). Arms and Armor in Colonial America, 1526-1783. NY: Courier Corporation, pp. 217-218. Belton failed to sell the musket to Congress, and later was unable to sell the design to the British Army a year after the American Revolution. There are no records that indicate that the gun was ever supplied, and it is uncertain if or how exactly the Belton improvement operated.  Musket design  There are no known surviving examples of the musket Belton demonstrated to Congress. The only evidence of its existence is the correspondence between Belton and Congress.Belton's original letter to Congress, April 11, 1777 Belton described the musket as capable of firing up to \\"eight balls one after another, in eight, five or three seconds of time,\\" at a distance of 25 to 30 yards. He also claimed to have a secret method of modifying this weapon to discharge \\"sixteen or twenty [balls], in sixteen, ten, or five seconds of time.\\" Historian Harold L. Peterson argued that because it was described as having a predetermined number of shots and rate of fire, it may have worked with a single lock igniting a fused chain of charges stacked in a single barrel, packaged as a single large paper cartridge. Congress commissioned Belton to build or modify 100 muskets for the military on May 3, 1777, but the order was cancelled on May 15, when Congress received Belton's bid and considered it an \\"extraordinary allowance.\\" After the war, Belton attempted to sell the design to the British Army, without success. Other Belton superposed load guns While no examples of the converted muskets demonstrated to Congress are known, Belton did not give up on the concept of superposed load firearms. After the American Revolution, Belton began looking for buyers for superposed load flintlocks in England. =East India Company Seven shot muskets= Belton then began making superposed load flintlocks, which used a sliding lock mechanism, with the London gunsmith William Jover, and sold them to the East India Company in 1786. An example of a seven shot sliding lock flintlock musket made by Jover and Belton may be found in the Royal Armouries Museum collection in Leeds. This musket, rack numbered 124 (indicating a purchase and issue of at least 124 of the rifles), also has a replaceable chamber section. The replaceable chamber makes this example both a breechloader, and effectively gives it a seven shot replaceable magazine. It is not known if multiple magazines were issued per gun, though this was possible (see here for a similar scenario with percussion revolvers). The lock slides from front to rear, with a second trigger provided that slides the lock from touch hole to touch hole, allowing each successive charge to be ignited. The lock did require cocking and priming between shots; while this would take time, the sliding lock would have provided a much higher rate of fire over a typical single shot musket of the era. The Belton sliding lock design was later improved and used in slightly more successful designs, such as Isaiah Jenning's repeating flintlock rifle. =Four shot pistol design= Today there are two surviving Belton and Jover pistols at the Pitt Rivers Museum at the University of Oxford, having four touch holes which permit four successive discharges.

It is not to be confused with citizen journalism. Further definition Stonbely, S. (2017). Comparing Models of Collaborative Journalism. Center for Cooperative Media. Collaborative journalism can take many forms. One way to categorize collaborations is by duration (either temporary or ongoing), or by the level of integration among collaborators (from no integration to top-level organizational integration). Most collaborations can be placed within a matrix defined by these two variables, as here: Depending on the system of collaboration, individuals may also provide feedback or vote on whether an article is newsworthy. A single collaborative news story, therefore, may encompass multiple authors, varying articles, and ranged perspectives.Whatis.com \\"What is collaborative citizen journalism?\\" 2006, TechTarget Professional and amateur reporters may work together to develop collaborative news articles, or mainstream media sites may gather amateur blog posts to complement reporting.Instablogs \\"Instablogs Tour \\" 2007, Instablogs. Collaborative journalists either contribute directly to stories, sometimes through a wiki-style collaboration platform, or build upon the story externally, often through personal blogs. Through combined authorship, collaborative journalism is thought by some to offer an increased independence of thought and experience unavailable to traditional media.Stelter, Brian. \\"Mainstream News Outlets Start Linking to Other Sites\\" 12 October 2008, New York Times Successful collaborative journalism projects require a participatory ethos with respect for content. History Collaboration among reporters or between newsrooms has been practiced in different forms for more than one hundred years. One of the earliest journalism collaborations was among the newsrooms that made up ‚Äúthe wires‚Äù in the mid-nineteenth century. Yet through most of the twentieth century, especially after the advent of the penny papers, competition between outlets was the norm. Yet even during the height of profitability in the late twentieth century, when competition, not collaboration, was the most salient relationship between newsrooms, it was common practice for journalists on the same beat to collaborate by sharing notes, swapping tips, and in general helping each other out.Graves, L., & Konieczna, M. (2015). Sharing the news: Journalistic collaboration as field repair. International Journal of Communication, 9(0), 1966-84. Formal collaboration during that period was most common within an organization, rather than between. For example, Cable News Network (CNN) was formed in 1980, and codified intra-newsroom sharing ‚Äì between the national headquarters and its television news affiliates ‚Äì with CNN NewsSource, in 1988. However, there is a qualitative difference in the consciousness and intentionality with which collaborations are now being undertaken. The current excitement about collaborative journalism began in the mid-2000s, when publishers, journalism scholars, and foundations began to look at the opportunities made possible by digital networking. =Panama Papers= The Panama Papers project may be the largest example of a journalistic consortium to date. It began sometime in 2015 (date?) when Bastian Obermayer, an investigative reporter with the south German newspaper S√ºddeutsche Zeitung, was contacted by an anonymous source and offered the trove of 11.5 million electronic documents from Mossack Fonseca, the world's fourth biggest offshore law firm detailing a web of secret offshore deals and loans worth billions of dollars, and details of tax avoidance designs in numerous countries. The newspaper's editors decided they could not handle the massive volume of information alone and initiated a collaborative journalistic consortium including more than 140 journalists and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, a project of the nonprofit Center for Public Integrity. Football Leaks (2016/2017) The European Investigative Collaborations (EIC) working with \\"over 60 journalists in 14 countries\\" published a \\"series of articles called Football Leaks‚Äîthe \\"largest leak in sports history\\". Football Leaks \\"led to the prosecution of football superstar Cristiano Ronaldo and coach Jose Mourinho.\\" EIC was established in the fall of 2015 with founding members that include Der Spiegel, El Mundo, M√©diapart, the Romanian Centre for Investigative Journalism (CRJI), and Le Soir.NRC Handelsblad, Netherlands Differentiation from other styles of journalism *Collaborative journalism should not be confused with citizen journalism, which is practiced only by amateur reporters who develop stories by actively reporting, collecting, analyzing and disseminating news and information, often through blogs on the internet. *It is not community journalism or civic journalism, which are practiced only by professionals: **In community journalism, professional reporters focus their coverage on smaller communities, such as neighborhoods, suburbs, or small towns (rather than national or international coverage.) **Civic journalism is the philosophy and practice of professional journalists and newspapers acting as participants within a community, rather than detached spectators. *Collaborative journalism is similar, but not identical, to interactive journalism, in which consumers contribute to a professional news story through commenting and conversing with the reporter. *Wiki journalism is a type of collaborative journalism. Link journalism \\"Link journalism\\", a phrase coined by Scott Karp in 2008, is \\"a form of collaborative journalism in which a news story's writer provides external links within the story to reporting or other sources on the web.\\"Karp, Brian. \\"How Link Journalism Could Have Transformed the New York Times Reporting on McCain Ethics\\" 2008, Publish 2.0 BlogPublish2 \\"What is link journalism? \\" 2009, Publish2. These links are meant to complement, enhance, or add context to the original reporting. Jeff Jarvis, from the Graduate School of Journalism's new media program at the City University of New York, has said that link journalism creates a \\"new architecture of news.\\" Implementation Collaborative journalism has been implemented in several different ways. Wikinews, the \\"free-content online news source,\\" lets any user edit or create a news story, similar in style to Wikipedia. Several mainstream news sites have adopted a collaborative journalism approach toward news, through use of news aggregation. The Washington Post has developed a political site which links to related content from other news sites. NBC links to local newspapers, radio broadcasts, online videos, and blogs on its local television stations' sites. The sites do not separate articles written by NBC staff and links to outside sources. The New York Times has introduced a Times Extra website feature which acts posts links to outside news sites. Commenting on the launch of Times Extra, Marc Frons, CTO for Digital Operations at the New York Times, said:Frons, Marc. \\"Talk to the Times: Chief Technology Officer, Digital Operations\\" 2008, New York Times > ‚ÄúIn the past, I think many news organizations were afraid to link to other > Web sites out of fear that they might be sending people to an unreliable > source or that their readers would never return. But those fears were > largely misplaced and we‚Äôve seen a much more open policy when it comes to > pointing readers at useful content elsewhere on the Web.\\" Other sites exhibit collaborative journalism through aggregation. On the site NewsVine, for example, wire stories from the Associated Press complement user- generated stories and blog posts. Reddit and other news aggregation sites may also act as collaborative journalism sites, depending on where content originates.  Awards for collaborative journalism  Due to the increase in collaborative journalism, several organizations have begun to offer grants or awards for these types of projects. For example, Online Journalism Awards (launched in May 2000) added a new award category for collaborations and partnerships. Clean Energy Wire offers grants for collaborative journalism projects on the topic of energy or the climate. The annual Hostwriter Prize awards money to support pitches and published collaborative projects by journalists. Criticism Collaborative journalism has received some criticism: *Some news stories require secrecy as they develop. Often sources cannot know that they are being investigated or reported on. When a single reporter investigates a person or organization, this secrecy is more likely to be kept. When news stories are developed collaboratively by multiple journalists, however, secrecy is more likely to be lost and the story jeopardized.\\"Collaboration is Queen \\" 2009, DigiDave.org *Quality of collaborative projects may be difficult to assess. Fact-checking may be difficult, as facts come from many different sources. Quality of writing and reporting may also differ among contributors.Haber, Marlan Wynne \\"Strategies of Collaborative Writing and Intellectual Enrichment.\\" 1994 See also *Blog *Citizen journalism * *Democratic journalism *Fact checking *Independent Media Center *Interactive journalism *Media democracy *New media *Newsvine *Old media *Open-source journalism *Operation Leakspin *Participatory media *Publish2 *Social news *Wiki journalism *Wikinews References Category:Collaboration Category:Types of journalism ","title":"Collaborative journalism"},{"id":"18010410","text":"Kulashi () is a small town (daba) in Imereti, Georgia with the population of around 1,702 as of 2014.

A curriculum vitae (), Latin for \\"course of life\\", often shortened as CV or vita (genitive case, vitae), is a written overview of someone's life's work (academic formation, publications, qualifications, etc.). Vitae can be plural or possessive (genitive case in Latin). Vitae often aim to be a complete record of someone's career, and can be extensive. They are (depending on country) used in the same way as a r√©sum√©, which is typically a brief 1‚Äì2 page summary of qualifications and work experience for the purposes of employment, and often only presents recent highlights. In many countries, a r√©sum√© is typically the first item that a potential employer encounters regarding the job seeker and is typically used to screen applicants, often followed by an interview. Vitae may also be requested for applicants to postsecondary programs, scholarships, grants and bursaries. In the 2010s it became popular for applicants to provide an electronic text of their CV to employers using email, an online employment website or using a job-oriented social-networking-service website, such as LinkedIn.  Contents  In the United Kingdom, most Commonwealth countries, and Ireland, a CV is short (usually a maximum of two sides of A4 paper), and therefore contains only a summary of the job seeker's employment history, qualifications, education, and some personal information. Some parts of Asia require applicants' photos, date of birth, and most recent salary information. CVs are often tailored to change the emphasis of the information according to the particular position for which the job seeker is applying. A CV can also be extended to include an extra page for the jobseeker's publications if these are important for the job. In the United States, Pakistan, Canada, Australia, Germany, India, Cuba, and Russia a CV is a comprehensive document used in academic circles and medical careers that elaborate on education, publications, and other achievements. A CV contains greater detail than a r√©sum√©, a shorter summary which is more often used in applications for jobs, but it is often expected that professionals use a short CV that highlights the current focus of their academic lives and not necessarily their full history. A CV is generally used when applying for a position in academia, while a resume is generally used when applying for a position in industry, non-profit, and the public sector.  Etymology, spellings and pronunciation  Curriculum vitae is a Latin expression which can be loosely translated as [the] course of [my] life. In current usage, curriculum is less marked as a foreign loanword. Traditionally the word vitae is rendered in English using the ligature √¶, hence vit√¶,List of words that may be spelled with a ligature although this convention (curriculum vit√¶) is less common in contemporary practice. The plural of curriculum vitae, in Latin, is formed following Latin rules of grammar as curricula vitae, and is used along with curricula vitarum, each of which is debated as being more grammatically correct than the other. In English, the plural of the full expression curriculum vitae is seldom used; the plural of curriculum on its own is usually written as \\"curricula\\",American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition, Houghton Mifflin, 2009 rather than the traditional curriculums.OED, 2nd edition, Oxford University Press, 1989 See also * Applicant tracking system * Background check * Cover letter * Europass ‚Äì European Standardised model * hResume ‚Äì a microformat for marking up r√©sum√©s on web pages * Human resources * R√©sum√© fraud * Video r√©sum√© References External links  * CV guide ‚Äì Massachusetts Institute of Technology ‚Äì Global Education & Career Development, United States * Cover Letter guide ‚Äì Massachusetts Institute of Technology ‚Äì Global Education & Career Development, United States Category:Recruitment Category:Business documents Category:Latin words and phrases ","title":"Curriculum vitae"},{"id":"18010503","title":"Dominic Lam"},{"id":"18010507","title":"Marko ≈†uler"},{"id":"18010509","text":"Lucy Beale is a fictional character from the BBC soap opera EastEnders. The character was played by Eva Brittin-Snell (from 1993 to 1996), Casey Anne Rothery (from 1996 until 2004), Melissa Suffield (from 2004 to 2010), and Hetti Bywater (from 2012 to 2015). Lucy was introduced in December 1993 as the baby daughter of Ian (Adam Woodyatt) and Cindy Beale (Michelle Collins). She is the twin sister of Peter Beale (Dayle Hudson), and has three half siblings, older brother Steven Beale (Aaron Sidwell), younger sister Cindy Williams (Mimi Keene) and younger brother Bobby Beale (Clay Milner Russell). From 2004, when the role was recast to the older Suffield, storylines featuring Lucy focused upon her teenage rebellion. In 2010, Suffield left EastEnders, after she was allegedly axed due to \\"unruly behaviour.\\" On 14 November 2011, it was announced Lucy would be returning in 2012 with Bywater taking over the role. She returned on 12 January 2012. Her storylines have included teenage pregnancy, abortion, cheating in her exams, struggling to cope when Ian has a mental breakdown and runs away, feuding, taking over Ian's businesses, and multiple relationships (including a relationship with her best friend's father, Max Branning (Jake Wood). On 21 February 2014, it was announced that Lucy would be murdered, starting a dark chapter for the Beale family and a whodunnit storyline that would run until the show's 30th anniversary in February 2015 when the identity of the murderer would be revealed. The \\"Who Killed Lucy Beale?\\" storyline was billed as the soap's biggest whodunnit, and was EastEnders' biggest marketing campaign to date. Bywater returned in a flashback episode on 19 February 2015 to explore unanswered questions about the night Lucy died.EastEnders plans 'Who Killed Lucy Beale?' flashback episode ‚Äì EastEnders News ‚Äì Soaps ‚Äì Digital Spy The same episode revealed that Lucy's 10-year-old half-brother Bobby was her killer, after 10 months of secrecy regarding her demise. The character reappeared in 2019 and 2020, portrayed by a body double and using archive footage. Storylines1993‚Äì2010= Lucy and her twin brother Peter Beale (Francis Brittin-Snell) are born in December 1993, to Ian (Adam Woodyatt) and Cindy Beale (Michelle Collins). The twins are born on the same day Ian's father, Pete Beale (Peter Dean), dies in a car accident with his girlfriend, Rose Chapman (Petra Markham). In 1996, Cindy hires a hitman to kill Ian, but he survives and fearing she will be arrested, she goes on the run with Peter and her eldest son, Steven Beale (Stuart Stevens), and she is unable to get Lucy. Ian hires a private investigator, who locates Cindy in Italy and Ian, his stepfather Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) and Phil's brother Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp), go to Italy and take Steven and Peter (now played by Stuart Stevens). Cindy returns to Walford with her boyfriend, Nick Holland (Dominic Taylor), and she wins custody of Steven, Lucy and Peter (now played by Joseph Shade), but is arrested for attempted murder and is remanded in custody, so the children stay with Ian. In November 1998, Cindy dies of complications after giving birth to hers and Nick's daughter Cindy Williams (Eva Wortley and Cydney Parker), who is Lucy's younger half-sister. Steven, Lucy and Peter grow up with various stepmothers: Mel Healy (Tamzin Outhwaite) splits from Ian straight after marrying him in Millennium Eve due to her finding out Lucy was not sick with cancer as initially feared and in July 2003, Ian's wife Laura Beale (Hannah Waterman) gives birth to hers and Ian's son, Bobby Beale (Kevin Curran), who is Lucy and Peter's younger half-brother, and they separate when Ian denies paternity, but she later dies in March 2004. Ian meets Jane Collins (Laurie Brett) at a fair, but Lucy and Peter struggle to bond with her due to Ian's past relationships, but are persuaded by Ian's aunt, Pauline Fowler (Wendy Richard) to give her a chance. Lucy and Peter are both picked on by twins Demi Miller (Shana Swash) and Darren Miller (Charlie G. Hawkins). Progressing into her teens, Lucy becomes rebellious‚Äîstealing, smoking, drinking alcohol, lying, playing truant from school, being surly to Ian and Jane, and taking an interest in boys. Things worsen when Ian employs Craig Dixon (Rory Jennings) in his chip shop. Lucy and Craig are attracted to one another, and despite Craig being five years older than Lucy, they begin dating. Craig is a bad influence on Lucy, and upon discovering their relationship, Ian warns Craig away. Lucy runs away with Craig, unperturbed that he carries a gun and assaulted Patrick Trueman (Rudolph Walker). However, when he tries to press her for sex, she panics and returns to Walford, telling Ian that Craig assaulted Patrick. Craig is arrested for attempted murder; however, Lucy keeps his gun, which he had stashed in her bag. In 2007, Lucy is contacted by a person claiming to be Cindy. It transpires that Steven (now played by Aaron Sidwell) was posing as Cindy to terrorise and kidnap Ian, blaming him for Cindy's death. Steven holds Ian hostage for weeks, while moving in with the Beale family. The situation ends when Steven accidentally shoots Jane with Craig's gun. Ian gets Steven psychiatric help and allows him to live with them, to Lucy's delight. In early 2008, Ian and Lucy argue about a destructive house party Lucy had in his absence. Lucy slaps Ian and he slaps her back; and she runs away. The Beales search for Lucy for weeks, before it is revealed that Steven has been hiding her, turning her against Ian and convincing her to move to France, so he can usurp her place in Ian's affections. Ian discovers the truth and convinces Lucy to come home and banishes Steven. Lucy stays with Jane's brother Christian Clarke (John Partridge) briefly, has a relationship with an older boy, Olly Greenwood (Bart Edwards), decides to take the contraceptive pill and engages in blackmail to earn money. Lucy has sex with Leon Small (Sam Attwater) and gets pregnant; unaware of this, Leon dumps Lucy for Zsa Zsa Carter (Emer Kenny). Not ready to be a mother, Lucy asks Jane to adopt her baby and Jane agrees. Ian, however, is concerned that Jane manipulated Lucy to allow her to adopt the baby as she cannot have one of her own. He makes Lucy watch a video of a woman giving birth and persuades her to have an abortion. They agree to tell Jane that she miscarried. Lucy receives excellent grades in her GCSEs, having paid Adam Best (David Proud) to help her cheat. When the school question the authenticity of her exam results, she admits that she cheated and is told to retake her final year. Lucy decides not to and goes to her grandmother Bev Williams (Diane Langton) in Devon. =2012‚Äì2020= Lucy returns to Walford for the funeral of Pat Evans (Pam St Clement) and is angry to find that Ian is engaged to Mandy Salter (Nicola Stapleton). Lucy dislikes Mandy and tries to stop her marrying Ian. She sabotages Mandy's wedding dress, sets her up, and tries to poison Bobby (now played by Alex Francis) against her, all unsuccessfully. Having noticed Whitney Dean's (Shona McGarty) attraction to Tyler Moon (Tony Discipline), Lucy causes trouble by upset by sleeping with him. Lucy and Whitney are antagonistic but eventually make amends because of they are both friends with Lauren Branning (Jacqueline Jossa). On Mandy and Ian's wedding day, Lucy gives Ian an ultimatum: her or Mandy. She is distraught when he chooses Mandy but Mandy is unhappy and admits she does not love Ian and leaves. Ian has a nervous breakdown and disappears, leaving Bobby with Lucy. Following her father's disappearance, Lucy struggles to keep his businesses afloat and has trouble with Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman) who repeatedly steals money from the caf√© and chip shop. Derek's son, Joey Branning (David Witts), tricks Derek to give him money, which he returns to Lucy. Joey and Lucy like each other and star dating. Lucy decides she does not need Ian and renames the caf√© \\"Cindy's\\". Lauren discovers that Ian is homeless but Lucy refuses to see him. Lauren's parents bring Ian back to Walford, and when Lucy opens the door, she slams it in his face. However, Sharon Rickman (Letitia Dean) convinces her to give Ian another chance and she agrees, providing that the businesses and properties are transferred to her so she will never be in that situation again. Ian agrees and signs the agreement. He eventually returns to work and Lucy promises to be there for him. Joey kisses Whitney, angering her. Eventually, Lauren urges Whitney to tell Lucy, and Lucy breaks up with Joey briefly. They reconcile, despite Joey not having feelings for her. Joey says that it will never work and leaves her. Lucy worries when she finds a lump in her breast, but it is benign. Joey starts dating Lauren, his cousin. Lucy is jealous and splits them up by spiking Lauren's drink with vodka, making Joey believe that Lauren is drinking excessively. Lucy is opposed to Ian's plans to open a restaurant, worried he cannot cope. When Lauren applies for a job as a waitress, Lucy deliberately sets Joey up as Lauren's test customer, hoping she will fail. Although Whitney is chosen, she withdraws her application so Lauren gets the job but is soon sacked. Lucy provokes Lauren, who punches Lucy and smashes the caf√© window. Lauren is arrested but Lucy decides not to press charges. Ian steals cheques from the business account to pay for his new restaurant; Lucy believes that Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks) supplied the extra money. When she discovers the truth, she has a vicious row with Ian, which is interrupted by Peter's (now played by Ben Hardy) return to Walford. Lucy gets upset when Joey insists that they do not have a future together and Ian takes advantage of this, manipulating her into signing a contract that gives control of the businesses back to him. When Lucy discovers what has happened, she and Ian argue and she goes to work for Janine. Lucy develops a rivalry with her colleague, Danny Pennant (Gary Lucy), and they use dirty tactics against each other to gain commission on their pay. However, Lucy discovers Danny is squatting in one of Janine's flats as he is homeless. Danny pleads with Lucy not to tell and she agrees but warns him that she now has power over him. Lucy is pleased when Ian invites his girlfriend, Denise Fox (Diane Parish) and Lucy‚Äôs half-sister Cindy (now played by Mimi Keene) to move in. Lucy and Lauren start up their own letting agents company, called LB Lettings. While having a sexual affair with her best friend Lauren's father, Max, Lucy also has sex with newcomer Lee Carter (Danny-Boy Hatchard). He wants to begin a relationship but Lucy is more interested in Max. Lucy and Max sleep together again, but when Lee compliments her looks, Lucy realises that Lee cares about her and Max is just using her. Lucy is devastated, however, when she sees Lee kissing Whitney. Lucy is shaken when Max shows her photographs of them kissing and reveals that someone e-mailed them to him. Lucy swears she knows nothing about it. Ian begins to show how proud he is of Lucy and her new business, infuriating Cindy. Lucy later spots Lee and Whitney kissing again but meets him in the restaurant to have sex. Lucy breaks down, however, and Lee comforts her. Unbeknownst to Lee and Lucy, Jake sees them through the window. Cindy tells Ian that Lucy was arrested for shoplifting in Devon and is hiding something in her jewellery box. Worried, Ian and Jane open the box, and to their horror, find a bag of cocaine. After being chased out of the restaurant, Lucy angrily shouts at Ian, saying she wishes he was not her father. Ian tells Lucy that she is his favourite child but Peter overhears and leaves in shock. Lucy follows but cannot find him. Shortly after, Lucy gets a text message and leaves the Square. The next day, Lucy's body is found on Walford Common after having been murdered the previous night. That afternoon, police officers DC Emma Summerhayes (Anna Acton) and DS Cameron Bryant (Glen Wallace) tell Ian that Lucy is dead. Ian identifies her body at Walford mortuary. Her funeral takes place, and the police continue to investigate her murder. When Peter proposes to Lauren, he confesses that he supplied drugs to Lucy. After the proposal, Lee finds a video that proves Lauren has given a false alibi. Max, his daughters and Emma are invited for Christmas Day at Ian's. Cindy receives, as a present from a mysterious sender, Lucy's jewellery box. Who it could be and the reason why worries the Beales and their guests. Emma, no longer on the case officially, soon discovers who she thinks killed Lucy and confronts the killer. Before reporting them, Emma is accidentally run over and dies from a brain bleed. Lauren uses Emma's case notes and becomes suspicious as to who killed her. Lauren discovers Lucy was killed at home and writes this in a card to Ian and Jane. Peter, after being told by Lauren that Lucy was killed at home, accuses Ian and Jane but Ian believes Jane is responsible, but realises that her story does not add up and that she is covering for Bobby (now played by Eliot Carrington). Jane explains that she found Lucy on the floor in the living room with Bobby holding her jewellery box‚Äîhaving hit her over the head‚Äîand that Bobby does not know he killed her. The Beales agree to keep it a secret from him. It also transpires that Lucy had been writing a letter to Ian shortly before Bobby hit her, telling her father to wake her when he returns home, that she has resolved to change and she loves him. Bobby gave the letter to Cindy, who gave it to Ian. Over two years after Lucy's murder, Bobby is convicted of the crime and sentenced to three years imprisonment. Bobby (now portrayed by Clay Milner Russell) is released after three years and struggles with his guilt; in the Beale house, he begins seeing visions of Lucy. Casting and development Casey Anne Rothery as Lucy Beale (1999) As a baby and toddler, Lucy was played by Eva Brittin-Snell for the first three years. Casey Anne Rothery took over the role in 1996 and played Lucy for nearly eight years. In August 2004 it was announced that Rothery, along with Joseph Shade, who played Lucy's twin brother Peter Beale, had been axed from EastEnders as producers were looking to mature the characters. The actors were told days before filming their final scenes that they would be leaving. Rothery's family were said to be furious, with a family friend telling The People, \\"It was a bolt out of the blue. She is devastated and has been in tears. To be booted out without any warning is a real kick in the teeth. She rang her dad in tears. He phoned soap bosses to complain and they admitted they could have handled things a lot better.\\" An EastEnders spokesperson said, \\"Joseph and Casey Anne have done a fantastic job. They're written into EastEnders history and everyone will miss them.\\" Casey's final episode aired on 21 September 2004. It was later announced that young actress Melissa Suffield would take over the role, and she first appeared on 28 October 2004. In March 2010, Suffield said that she wished \\"people didn't think I was like [Lucy] in real life because I'm not.\\" In May 2010 it was announced that Suffield had been axed from the show allegedly due to \\"unruly behaviour\\" off-set. In June it was reported that the character would be recast. Suffield left the show on 27 August 2010. In February 2011 an EastEnders spokesperson said that no decision on Lucy's recasting had been made. On 14 November 2011, it was announced the character would be returning to EastEnders in January 2012 with Hetti Bywater taking over the role. Of her casting, Bywater said \\"I'm really excited to be joining such an iconic show as EastEnders, especially becoming part of the Beale household. I'm looking forward to find out what's in store for Lucy and seeing what she's going to get up to when she returns to Walford.\\" After seeing Bywater's first episode, Melissa Suffield said that she has moved on from EastEnders and also wished Bywater good luck in the role. Bywater expressed that she would like Peter Beale to return to the show, with Thomas Law playing him. In 2010, Lucy was involved in a pregnancy storyline, on which Suffield said \\"I'm excited about the storyline because it's something brilliant to get my teeth into. I love playing 'bitch Lucy', but you'll soon see a completely different side to her.\\" The storyline involved Lucy offering to have the baby so that it could be brought up by Ian and her step mother Jane (Laurie Brett). An Albert Square insider said: \\"Lucy's run rings around her father Ian and stepmum Jane for years. Lucy falls pregnant just at a time when Jane's desperate for a child of her own. Jane believes that the baby could be the solution to her dream of having a baby with Ian. =Departure and cameo appearances= On 21 February 2014, it was revealed that Hetti Bywater would leave the show, ending in a \\"raw\\", \\"emotional\\" and \\"gritty\\" storyline, with the character being killed off in the spring. The storyline was somewhat foreshadowed by new executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins stating at an EastEnders press event in December 2013 that \\"there's a big, big Beale story that will hit around Easter and keep going until the anniversary.\\" Treadwell-Collins also stated that it would give Adam Woodyatt (who plays Lucy's father Ian Beale) \\"a big chance to shine\\" throughout the storyline. In the episode dated 18 April 2014, Lucy's lifeless body lay on Walford Common, beginning the storyline. It was revealed on 19 February 2015 that Lucy was in fact killed by her younger brother, Bobby. Ian initially believes that Jane killed her, but it is later revealed that Jane covered for Bobby by placing Lucy's body on Walford Common. Jane reveals to Ian, Peter and Cindy that Bobby is unaware he killed her, and instead believes that she was killed when she headed out later that night in a mugging. The character of Bobby was reintroduced in 2019, having been imprisoned for Lucy's murder for three years, with Clay Milner Russell in the role. Writers chose to explore Bobby's guilt over Lucy's murder and struggle adapting back to Walford, following his return. As part of the storyline, the character of Lucy was reintroduced for a cameo appearance. Bywater did not reprise the role for the appearance, and a body double was hired instead. Other appearances Suffield appears as Lucy in the online spin-off, EastEnders: E20, in 2010, and Bywater portrays the character in the Children in Need 2014 special, \\"The Ghosts of Ian Beale\\", with other women from Ian Beale's past in a concussion-related flashback, shown on 14 November 2014. Bywater also appears as Lucy in the online exclusive clip, called \\"Under Suspicion\\", which sees Jay Brown (Jamie Borthwick) under questioning by the police. Reception In July 2007, Gareth McLean of The Guardian lamented the lack of strong female characters in EastEnders, noting that Lucy \\"is yet to come into her own\\". Fellow Guardian critic Grace Dent commented on the repetitive nature of EastEnders storylines by comparing Lucy's relationship with Jane to the fraught mother-daughter bond between Kat (Jessie Wallace) and Zoe Slater (Michelle Ryan). Lucy was used by Jane Simon of the Daily Mirror to highlight a trend in the soap for husbands to prioritise their \\"Chavvy girlfriends\\" over their \\"doting wives\\", with the critic noting: \\"With Max (Jake Wood) and Rob (Stuart Laing) choosing Stacey and Dawn (Kara Tointon) over Tanya (Jo Joyner) and May (Amanda Drew), the feckless males of Albert Square are clearly voting with their, er, feet. No wonder Lucy Beale has started swigging alcopops on a park bench with a bunch of hoodies. By this time next week she'll have got herself a tattoo, a Staffordshire bull terrier and a chartered accountant lover.\\" When Lucy's brother Steven returned to the show, took Ian hostage and shot Jane, Digital Spy's Dek Hogan noted that: \\"Throughout all of this, credit has to be given to young Melissa Suffield whose role as Lucy has been pivotal. She's done an excellent job as the confused rebellious teenager and hints of Cindy have shone through.\\" Suffield was nominated 'Best Child Actor' in the 2008 Digital Spy awards, but lost to Hollyoaks' Ellis Hollins. When EastEnders embarked upon a storyline which saw Lucy's peer Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty) abused by the ephebophile Tony King (Chris Coghill), the Daily Mirror's Tony Stewart questioned whether viewers would take the plot seriously, given the \\"sexually precocious\\" nature of the soap's storylines, and the fact that only recently, Lucy, who is just a year younger than Whitney, had almost given her virginity to her older boyfriend. When Tony began to groom Lucy's friend Lauren, the Mirror's Maeve Quigley commented: \\"It's just a pity really that Tony didn't decide to turn his attentions to Lucy Beale instead ‚Äì he would be minus a vital piece of his anatomy and his wallet by now.\\" The 2010 storyline in which Lucy falls pregnant and Ian tries to scare her into having an abortion by showing her a DVD of childbirth borrowed from one of his employees prompted a complaint to Ofcom from the woman featured giving birth in the footage shown, alleging \\"that her privacy and that of her baby son had been infringed by the broadcast of two EastEnders episodes.\\" After investigation from Ofcom, the complaint was not upheld as the footage was in the public domain as part of a National Childbirth Trust DVD. Bywater's portrayal of Lucy won her the 'Best Newcomer' award at the 2012 Inside Soap Awards. The episode immediately following Lucy's death earned a nomination for the \\"Best Single Episode\\" award at The British Soap Awards 2014, entitled \\"Lucy's death: The Aftermath\\".

The film is directed by Lawrence Schiller from a screenplay by Mailer. Plot The movie is about the final nine months of the life of Gary Gilmore, beginning with his release from prison at the age of 35 after serving 12 years for robbery in Indiana. He is allowed to fly to Utah to live with Brenda Nicol, a distant cousin who was close to him and agrees to sponsor him. She tries to help him get back to normal life, which he finds extremely difficult after being in prison for so long. He soon moves to live with his uncle Vern, with whom he works in shoe repair, and Vern's wife. Gilmore next moves on to another job, at an insulation factory, where he performs well at first, but starts to have erratic hours and contentious relationships with co-workers. Gilmore meets and becomes romantically involved with Nicole Baker, a 19-year-old separated woman with two young children. Despite his efforts to reform himself, Gilmore begins to fight, steal items from stores, and abuse alcohol and drugs. The people who care for him are distressed to see these patterns re-emerge. Nicole breaks up with Gilmore after he hits her, and she goes into hiding with her children. Gilmore soon murders two men in two separate robberies over two days. His cousin Brenda tells police she suspects Gilmore is involved, and he is taken into custody. He is convicted of one of the murders and sentenced to death under a state law designed to accommodate the US Supreme Court ruling on the death penalty, which found most state laws on capital punishment to constitute \\"cruel and unusual punishment,\\" prohibited under the Constitution. States worked to revise their laws. While his attorneys, the ACLU and his family try to persuade Gilmore to pursue more appeals, he argues to have the sentence carried out and becomes a national media sensation. Publishers and reporters vie to buy his story and film rights. The night before his death, family, friends and lawyers join Gilmore for a party on death row. On January 17, 1977, Gilmore is executed by firing squad, as he chose. His body is then burned after parts are extracted for donation in accordance with his wishes. He was the first person to be judicially executed in the United States after the execution of Luis Monge in Colorado on June 2, 1967.

Design Superposed loads are loads that are placed in the barrel, one on top of the other, so that there is an alternating sequence of (from the breach end) powder, ball, powder, ball, etc., for the desired number of charges. Each charge is accompanied by a corresponding touch hole that allows ignition of that charge. In the simplest case, the matchlock, each touch hole is individually primed and ignited with the match, front to rear. Each ball behind the first acts as a seal, to prevent ignition of the next charge. A four shot superposed load flintlock musket built for militia use in 1824. The lock is positioned to ignite the front-most charge, and the rearward toucholes are protected by rotating covers. Flintlocks using superposed charges often involved a sliding lock, that slid along the barrel and locked in place at each successive touch hole. The lock would be primed, cocked, and fired at each touch hole to discharge successive charges. Some caplock designs used multiple hammers, each impacting a nipple leading to a different charge, allowing true rapid fire. History Designs using superposed loads have appeared periodically throughout firearms history, though they have met with only limited success. They have always been plagued with issues of sequential charges firing together, which can result in a burst barrel and injury to the user. A superimposed load pistol made in Britain by William Mills in approximately 1830 * An early mention of superposed loads is made by Giambattista della Porta in his book Magia Naturalis (published in 1558), wherein he describes a brass gun that could discharge ten or more bullets \\"without intermission.\\" Porta's description is very similar to a Roman candle, in that it uses a propellant charge topped with an undersized ball, followed by a slower-burning charge to add a delay, repeating until the muzzle is reached. The chain of charges is fired by igniting the last layer of slow-burning powder, whereupon the gun fires each charge in succession. * Samuel Pepys also mentions in a 1662 entry of his diary a gun that would discharge seven times, and described it as \\"very serviceable.\\" * A British patent for superposed loads in a single barrel was issued in 1682 to Charles Cardiff. * Another British patent using superposed loads and featuring a sliding lock was issued to John Aitken in 1780.http://www.archivingindustry.com/Gunsandgunmakers/directory- introhistgun.pdf * American inventor Joseph Belton combined the earlier superposed load concepts into the Belton flintlock, which used a sliding lock with multiple touchholes to ignite separated sets of fused charges, allowing multiple shots per pull of the trigger and multiple shots to be fired by repositioning and recharging the lock. Belton attempted to license his invention to the Continental Congress in 1777, and to the British Army and the East India Company in 1784. * An American gunsmith, Isaiah Jennings, produced a superposed load gun mentioned in a New York Evening Post article on April 10, 1822. The article claims the gun consists of a single barrel and lock, which may fire fifteen to twenty charges, which can be fired in the space of two seconds per charge. Jennings' gun adds, in addition to the sliding lock and multiple touchholes of earlier designs, a mechanism for automatically priming the pan of the lock, meaning each shot can be fired by simply cocking the lock and pulling the trigger. A 12-shot, breech-loading flintlock version of Jennings rifle, serial number 1, sold for US$34,000 at auction in 2006. * The Metal Storm design attempted to solve these problems, but was a commercial failure.

Several types of marine camouflage have been used or prototyped: blending or crypsis, in which a paint scheme attempts to hide a ship from view; deception, in which a ship is made to look smaller or, as with the Q-ships, to mimic merchantmen; and dazzle, a chaotic paint scheme which tries to confuse any estimate of distance, direction, or heading. Counterillumination, to hide a darkened ship against the slightly brighter night sky, was trialled by the Royal Canadian Navy in diffused lighting camouflage. Ships were sometimes camouflaged in classical times. Mediterranean pirate ships were sometimes painted blue-gray for concealment. Vegetius records that Julius Caesar's scout ships were painted bluish-green when gathering intelligence along the coast of Britain during the Gallic Wars. Ships were sometimes painted deceptively during the Age of Sail, while both sides in the American Civil War camouflaged their ships, whether to run blockades or for night reconnaissance. Ship camouflage was used in earnest by the British Admiralty in the First World War. The marine artist Norman Wilkinson led research into dazzle camouflage, resulting in the painting of thousands of British and later American ships in dazzle patterns. He intended it not to make ships invisible, nor even to cause the enemy to miss his shot, but to deceive him into taking up a poor firing position. In the Second World War, dazzle was revisited by the Royal Navy and the United States Navy, and applied to a limited extent by other navies. After the Second World War, radar made painted camouflage less effective, though inshore craft continue to use camouflage schemes alongside anti-radar stealth. Early use Roman ships, depicted on a 3rd Century AD sarcophagus Ship camouflage was occasionally used in ancient times. The 3rd century book Imagines notes that Mediterranean pirate ships were sometimes painted blue- gray for concealment. Vegetius writing in the 4th century says that \\"Venetian blue\\" (bluish-green, the same color as the sea) was used in the years 56‚Äì54 BC during the Gallic Wars, when Julius Caesar sent his speculatoria navigia (scout ships) to gather intelligence along the coast of Britain. The ships were painted entirely in bluish-green wax, with sails and ropes the same color. The sailors and marines were also dressed in \\"Venetian blue\\". In the Age of Sail, deception was often used by ships, and paint was applied ad hoc by ships' captains for temporary tactical advantage. A ship might be painted to look like another, it might have its cannon ports hidden by painted canvas to look harmless, or it might have additional cannon ports painted on to appear more powerful. For example, in one of his battles during 1778‚Äì1782, American privateer Jonathan Haraden hid the guns of his ship the General Pickering, to appear as if it were a slow merchant ship. Haraden allowed his ship to be approached at close range by a much faster British privateer, then he quickly pulled the painted canvas away and delivered a full broadside, capturing the enemy. USS Olympia In the American Civil War, camouflage paint was applied by both sides during the Union blockade of 1861‚Äì1865. Blockade runners aiding the Confederates sometimes painted their ships all in mist- gray, to hide themselves in coastal fog. One Union blockade crew may have painted their rowboat white, and its oars, and wore white clothing for a night reconnaissance patrol up an enemy-held river. In the 1890s, German and French fighting ships were being painted gray. American interest in ship camouflage was given official funding in 1898 during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War when white, light gray, and medium gray paint schemes were evaluated for their ability to hide a ship as seen against the distant sky on the horizon. Artist Abbott Handerson Thayer investigated countershading color schemes to \\"paint out\\" natural shadows. The United States Navy switched from gray to white in the 1900s, and in 1907 its Great White Fleet set out to circumnavigate the globe with all-white hulls. The white paint proved to be unsuccessful, and after the return of the Great White Fleet, its ships were painted gray. British ships began being painted gray in 1903; lighter shades were preferred to minimize solar heating in warmer climates. First World War USS Shawmut was the former Eastern steamship Massachusetts converted to lay the 1918 North Sea Mine Barrage. In the First World War, the increasing range of naval guns, and the great fear of high-speed, long-range torpedoes used against warships and merchant ships caused a significant increase in the use of ship camouflage. =Royal Navy= HMT Aquitania wearing dazzle camouflage Patterned ship camouflage was pioneered in Britain. Early in the First World War, the zoologist John Graham Kerr advised Winston Churchill to use disruptive camouflage to break up ships' outlines, and countershading to make them appear less solid, following the American artist Abbott Handerson Thayer's beliefs. Kerr was not an effective political campaigner, and his ideas were abandoned on Churchill's departure from the Admiralty, while his postwar legal action to claim credit for ship camouflage failed. His successor, the marine artist Norman Wilkinson, successfully promoted the idea that Kerr's camouflage sought invisibility rather than image disruption. Under Wilkinson, the Admiralty researched and issued a large number of \\"razzle-dazzle\\" designs, which became known simply as \\"dazzle\\", to counter the threat from submarines. Models were made and painted, often by women artists, and tested in a laboratory by viewing through a periscope. After trials, in October 1917 the Admiralty ordered all its merchant ships to be painted in dazzle patterns. The purpose of dazzle camouflage was not however motion dazzle but course deception, as Wilkinson later explained: The Q-ship HMS Tamarisk Over 4000 British merchant ships and some 400 naval vessels were painted in dazzle camouflage during 1917‚Äì1918. Deceptive measures other than dazzle included the fitting of anti- rangefinder baffles to the masts and yards of battleships such as HMS Emperor of India in 1917. Deceptive mimicry was also practised, with heavily armed Q-ships disguised as merchant ships. =German Imperial Navy= A gun aboard the German Imperial Navy's commerce raider , retracted behind the side of the ship; when not in use the gun was covered with canvas. The German navy put little emphasis on camouflage. After the Battle of Jutland, German naval effort in any case went into submarine warfare. However, Germany made use of disguise, such as by painting ships in the colour schemes of British or neutral shipping. For example, the Kronprinzessin Cecilie was painted to resemble the British liner Olympic, and managed to reach America, evading the British blockade in 1914. In 1915 and 1916, the Germans further made use of commerce raiders, converted freighters with hidden weapons and long range, able to slip through the British blockade and then attack shipping as far away as the south Atlantic. German First World War merchant ships were rarely camouflaged, nor did they use Q-ships, as the Allied navies did not attack merchant shipping. =Other navies= The Allied navies of France and Italy essentially followed Admiralty camouflage practice. In 1913, American camouflage experiments included a submarine painted in a three-color pattern of broad vertical stripes designed by William Mackay, using white stripes to separate green and blue stripes. Wilkinson visited the United States to advise the U.S. Navy on ship camouflage. Dazzle schemes were used on merchant ships, naval transports, and smaller warships. Battleships were camouflaged in a variety of patterns. Second World War Some two-color paint schemes attempted to harmonize with both sea and sky near the horizon. The US Navy painted some ships dark gray with white structures above bridge level. Both the US Navy and the Royal Navy painted ships dark gray on the hull and light gray on the superstructure and turrets. USN measure 12 was a graded system with sea blue low on the hull below the first continuous deck, with ocean gray above that. The top of the masts were painted haze gray. This measure was modified with ocean gray above navy blue low on the hull below the first continuous deck (painted parallel to the waterline rather than the main deck). This bold contrast on a horizontal line near the horizon reduced visibility to surface observers and created the illusion of greater range. This camouflage was considered most effective for gunnery engagements with surface units or shore batteries in areas where aerial observation was unlikely. It was used in the Atlantic and European coastal waters from the end of 1942 through the end of World War II. It was worn by shore bombardment ships in the Pacific from late 1944 after the destruction of Japanese naval aviation capability at the Battle of the Philippine Sea. Similar Admiralty standard schemes were applied beginning in 1944 when it was assumed enemy forces would have radar. Ships were painted light gray overall, except for a sea blue patch low on the hull, either between the main gun turrets or the entire length of the hull. =United States Navy= USS Northampton wearing the false bow wave of measure 5 USS Antietam in measure 32, design 17A-2 In 1935, the United States Navy Naval Research Laboratory began studies and tests on low visibility camouflage for ships. Some measures were deceptive, like a false painted bow wave to give the impression of high speed at all times. Measures making cruisers resemble destroyers were discontinued after causing station-keeping confusion among ships operating in formation. Color schemes included light gray, haze gray, ocean gray, and black. Haze gray was found to provide reasonable protection in the widest range of conditions, and became a standard US Navy paint scheme after World War II. Ocean gray also became a standard paint scheme after the war. Although black is still used for submarines, it was discontinued on destroyers after it had been determined that black ships remained more noticeable than gray ships on even the darkest nights. The US Navy painted some ships sea blue overall for concealment from aircraft. During the Battle of the Coral Sea and the Battle of Midway, ships painted completely blue came under attack less often than ships wearing two-color schemes. On the advice of United States aviators the blue color was darkened and used extensively in the western and southern Pacific from mid-1942 through 1945 to minimize detection and identification by enemy aircraft. Dark blue also proved effective under artificial illumination during night actions. Upper surfaces of aircraft operating from carrier decks were painted a similar shade of blue. Sailors were ordered to wear dungarees rather than white uniforms when topside. The Thayer system was white with large polygonal patches of light sea blue (called Thayer Blue). This measure was most useful in Arctic latitudes with extended twilight and frequent fog and cloud cover. Purity of color was important for full realization of the Purkinje effect where some colors appear lighter and some appear darker at low levels of illumination. Darkening the pattern increased course deception, but increased visibility at night and in haze. Measure 32 was a medium pattern of obtrusive polygons in navy blue or black, against background polygons of lighter grays and greens. This measure emphasized mistaken identity and course deception to complicate submarine attack. Patterns were carried across the bow, and light gray was used aft to blend with the wake. This measure was based on the World War I dazzle system modified by observations in the western Pacific; and was applied to most surface ships in the Pacific during 1944 and 1945. Different patterns were devised for classes with large numbers of ships so the pattern would not identify the class of ship. =Royal Navy= Between the world wars, Royal Navy ships were painted dark gray in the Home Fleet, light gray in the Mediterranean and Caribbean Seas, and white in the Indian Ocean and western Pacific. Many Home Fleet ships were painted medium gray during 1939 and 1940 to decrease visibility from the peacetime dark gray. In the first year of the war British captains largely painted their ships as they saw fit. is believed to have been the first ship to adopt a disruptive camouflage paint scheme in December 1939, and several G-class destroyers of her flotilla used a similar scheme of contrasting stone colored polygons. When concern arose about German aerial reconnaissance of Scapa Flow, some Home Fleet ships were painted with disruptive Flotta schemes of dark brown, light gray, and light green polygons from April to August 1940 for concealment and identity confusion in port. Most Home Fleet ships had been repainted medium gray by December 1940. The Royal Navy painted Mediterranean submarines dark blue in 1940 to reduce submerged visibility to aircraft. Captain Louis Mountbatten's 5th Flotilla of K class destroyers were painted Mountbatten pink in 1940. Mountbatten observed a Union-Castle Liner disappear from convoy during an autumn sunset because of the company's unusual lavender-mauve-gray hull color. Mountbatten reasoned the color would be effective camouflage during dawn and dusk periods, and devised a similar shade by mixing medium gray with a small amount of venetian red. Its effectiveness was much disputed; but it was applied to other destroyers, a few cruisers, and numerous small warships which maintained the scheme through 1944 for use in coastal waters. No Admiralty camouflage section was established until October 1940. Admiralty camouflage schemes promulgated in 1941 were not universally adopted because of difficulties with operating schedules and shortages of some paint pigments. Nearly all destroyers and larger ships wore an Admiralty disruptive camouflage scheme by late 1942; but Commonwealth captains executed official camouflage schemes with greater variation than was customary with American measures. Initial Admiralty disruptive camouflage schemes employed polygons of varying shades of gray, blue and green so at least two of the colors would blend with background sea or sky under different light conditions. Schemes devised for capital ships emphasized identity confusion rather than concealment. became the first ship to receive an official camouflage scheme in January 1941. As more ships received similar schemes through 1941 it became evident the polygons were too small to be differentiated at effective camouflage ranges. Simplified Admiralty light and dark disruptive schemes were promulgated in 1942 to use larger and simpler polygons with no more than four colors. Light disruptive schemes were intended for use in the higher latitudes where skies were often overcast. Dark disruptive schemes used darker colors providing more effective disruption where bright sunlight could be expected. The Admiralty Western Approaches scheme evolved from a camouflage scheme applied to in June 1940 at the suggestion of the naturalist Peter Scott, who was serving aboard that ship. Broke was painted white with large polygonal patches of light gray, light sea blue and light sea green. Broke achieved some notoriety in a collision where the captain of the other ship claimed to have been unable to see Broke. Escort captains observing Broke experimented with similar schemes including polygons of dark gray or dark blue for increased disruptive contrast, while others tried painting their ships entirely white to emphasize concealment. The Admiralty omitted light gray from Peter Scott's scheme. White with large polygonal patches of light sea blue and light sea green was adopted in mid-1941 for use exclusively on destroyers and smaller ships engaged in anti- submarine operations. This was an effective scheme under typical North Atlantic weather conditions of fog and overcast. were delivered painted white with a pattern of sea blue and light gray in an American Western Approaches variant. These were colors used in American camouflage measures; but the pattern was unique to ships produced for the Royal Navy and was replaced by Admiralty schemes and colors during refit. The Home Fleet destroyer scheme was similar to the Western Approaches scheme but used darker shades of blue and gray on the rear third of the ship, to assist in station-keeping. British decks were usually dark gray. The Admiralty's informal approach changed when a branch of the Naval Research Laboratory was established at Leamington Spa under Commander James Yunge-Bateman to test ship camouflage schemes experimentally. Painted models were floated in a large tank and examined against different backgrounds, using theater lamps to simulate varying lighting conditions. An experimental coating able to change color was tested on Royal Navy submarines. On suggestion by Professor Leslie Cromby, lead oxide was applied to the hull, enabling it to become black on application of a solution of sulphite and sea water for night operation. For day sailing, a solution of hydrogen peroxide and sea water would be applied, producing sulphate and returning the hull to a white colour desirable for daytime conditions.

Painting by James Yunge-Bateman, 1943 File:Averof in camo,1942.jpgRHNS Georgios Averof, RN Bombay Station, 1942 =German Kriegsmarine= German Kriegsmarine ships before the Second World War were either light gray overall or had dark gray hulls, and many retained this scheme during the war. The cruiser Deutschland, for instance, had a gray hull and light gray superstructure in 1934. Others had dazzle camouflage, usually in combinations of pale gray, dark gray and sea blue. For example, the hull of the battleship Scharnhorst had a dazzle pattern of stripes on a gray background in 1940, but some of these were later painted out, and the bows forward of the main guns painted black. Scharnhorst was not camouflaged against air observation, her decks fore and aft bearing large black on white swastikas on a red field; her main gun turrets had red (in the Baltic) or yellow tops for air recognition. The battleship Bismarck set out to Norway in dazzle camouflage; this was painted out with gray for her final trip to the Atlantic. The cruiser Admiral Scheer wore a low contrast pattern of irregular dark gray marks on light gray for her superstructure, with a dark gray hull, black waterline and, away from air support while out raiding in 1941, dark gray turret tops. Larger ships often had false bows and sterns painted in a different shade from the rest of the hull to create the impression of the ship being at greater range from the observer. German decks were a very dark gray. Smaller ships operating in the North Sea or Baltic Sea were painted white or a very pale gray to blend in with daytime mist and nighttime phosphorescent organisms. As in the First World War, the Germans again employed disguised commerce raiders, Hilfskreuzer such as Atlantis, Thor and Kormoran. These ships were able to modify their appearance to throw off the searching Allied cruisers.

During the experiments, one side of the test ship was faintly illuminated by projectors mounted outboard. Results were improved with the use of blue-green filters, and then with a photocell to measure the brightness of the night sky. The ship's visibility was reduced, but the technology was inconvenient and never adopted in practice. =Other navies= Italian ships of Mussolini's navy retained its pre-war scheme of light gray overall for its smaller ships, but the larger units mostly had dazzle camouflage of dark gray, light sea blue, light sea green and light gray. Italian foredecks had a high-visibility pattern of red and white diagonal stripes so that their own aircraft would not attack them. Japanese ships were generally not camouflaged. In special tactical situations, camouflage could be improvised, as when the battleships Yamato and Musashi had their decks blackened with a mixture of soot to help them hide while passing through the San Bernardino Strait at night in the October 1944 Battle of Leyte Gulf. Japanese ships largely retained their pre-war dark gray paint scheme, although some major units like aircraft carriers changed to a dark sea green. Some aircraft carriers had their flight decks painted in a dazzle camouflage, but this seems to have been ineffective. By 1945, with the remnants of the Japanese Navy seeking to hide from American air power, its battleships were painted in a variety of camouflage measures. Haruna for example wore olive green overall, its turrets painted light green with gray stripes, whereas Ise's olive dress was broken up with patches of gray, red-brown, yellow, and dark green. Soviet ships were dark gray overall, sometimes with medium gray upperworks. The French Navy used light gray before the war and under the Vichy regime. Free French ships that operated with the British adopted one of the British schemes. Those that were refitted in American shipyards were usually repainted in the American Measure 22.

However, camouflage may have helped United States warships avoid hits from Vietnamese shore batteries which used optical rangefinders. Some U.S. Navy PTF boats were camouflaged experimentally in 1975 with green overall, broken up by patterns of gray and black. USS Freedom, a littoral combat ship, is however said to be the first U.S. Navy ship to have camouflage reminiscent of that used in the World Wars.

Saab Turbo X, the launch vehicle for Saab XWD To achieve optimum take-off performance, Saab XWD is capable of completely locking the front and rear axles, but can also adapt as little as 4% of torque to the rear wheels during highway cruising, thus maximizing fuel economy. To ensure immediate traction, torque distribution can be transferred to the wheel with the most grip in fractions of a second, and using the two couplings the XWD system can send 85% of available torque to a single rear wheel. The ability to transfer torque laterally between the rear wheels is similar to Mitsubishi's Super Active Yaw Control. An ECU continuously collects various data from the car's onboard systems, and in conjunction with the ESC, ABS and TCS calculates the best torque distribution in the driveline. The XWD system debuted on the 2008 limited edition Saab Turbo X, equipped with an electronically controlled limited slip differential (eLSD) and was gradually made available through the rest of the 9-3 line (in sedan and combi body styles).

Despite being of Jewish origin he was also invited to the Germany Davis Cup team, but chose not to accept it. In the 1930s he was ranked world # 6 in singles. Early life Hecht was born in Zsolna, Kingdom of Hungary (today ≈Ωilina, Slovakia), and was Jewish. Tennis career; interrupted by World War II Hecht developed a successful tennis career, many considering him to be the best tennis player in Europe immediately before the Second World War. In the 1930s he was ranked world # 6 in singles. He won the gold medal in singles at the 1932 Maccabiah Games.The Jews of Czechoslovakia; Historical Studies and Surveys, Volume 2, Jewish Publication Society of America, 1968. In 1934 Hecht won the Butler Trophy of Monte Carlo alongside Roderich Menzel, defeating Jacques Brugnon and Jean Lesueur in the final. In singles he was victorious at the Hungarian International Tennis Championships, upsetting Henner Henkel in the semifinal and Ignacy T≈Çoczy≈Ñski in the final. He reached the doubles finals as well, partnering Josef Caska. In late 1935 and early 1936 Hecht and Roderich Menzel toured the Far East, which included a visit to Japan to participate in the Japanese National Championships, where Menzel lost in the final, and despite their united effort they lost in the doubles final as well, both times to title defender Jiro Yamagishi. From there they sailed to India where they were the finalists at the East of India Championships. Arriving home he was defeated in the Czechoslovakian International Championship match by eventual world number one Fred Perry. He was a second straight time finalist in Budapest. From 1930 to 1939 he played for the Czech Republic Davis Cup team, achieving a record of 18-19, and was its Captain. In 1936 Hecht moved to Budapest, the capital of Hungary, and then subsequently sought livelihood in Australia. Hecht was invited to play for the German Davis Cup Team after Germany acquired part of Czechoslovakia, by an aide that was unaware that he was Jewish, but declined. He fled to the United States three days before the Nazi Germany invaded the Czech Lands in 1939. He worked in a munitions factory during World War II.Christopher Hilton (2011).How Hitler Hijacked World Sport; The World Cup, the Olympics, the Heavyweight Championship and the Grand Prix After the war Hecht continued his tennis career, becoming a no. 1 ranked player in the eastern United States.

The name \\"Redcap\\" derives from the breed's unusually large Rose-type comb. British breed standards dictate a length of more than 7 centimetres (3 inches) of length for a Redcap comb. It is covered in small, fleshy points, and has a distinct spike pointing backwards called a \\"leader\\". Combs, wattles and earlobes are all ideally bright red. Characteristics Redcaps are classified as a light fowl, with cocks weighing approximately and hens . Redcaps can be differentiated from similar looking breeds, especially the more popular Hamburgs, by their red earlobes and larger comb. Beaks are horn-coloured. Combs which hang to either side of the face, white earlobes, or a lack of points on the comb are undesirable traits according to the breed standards, and result in disqualification from poultry shows. The breed appears in a single variety of plumage, with various dark hues of red, brown and black. Cocks display a greater diversity of colour, but both males and females have black tails and a crescent shape of black on the edge of most body feathers. Derbyshire Redcaps are a hardy, active breed of chicken that does well in free range conditions. They are well suited for dual-purpose farm flocks, being used for both meat and egg production in addition to their ornamental qualities. Hens do not usually go broody, and lay a good amount of large, white coloured eggs. History The exact breeds that contributed to the creation of the Redcap are unknown, but Golden Spangled Hamburgs, Dorkings, Old English Pheasant Fowl and Black-Breasted Red Games may have been involved. The breed is also very similar in conformation to now-extinct chickens such as the Yorkshire Pheasant and the Lancashire Moonie. Derbyshire Redcaps were common on British farms until the middle of the 20th century, particularly around the southern Pennines. They have never been preferred by intensive farms or commercial operations, and have always been primarily a barnyard fowl. In the 21st century, they are a very rare chicken, with the largest numbers still residing in their home country. The Rare Breeds Survival Trust of the UK lists them as Vulnerable on their watch list. Abroad, Redcaps were admitted to the American Poultry Association's Standard of Perfection in 1888, and are listed as Critical on the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy watchlist.

It was subsequently developed as a principle of civil law systems, usucaption. It is similar to the common law concept of adverse possession, or acquiring land prescriptively. Overview Since mancipatio and in iure cessio were inherently public modes of acquisition of ownership, usucapio was the only private method of the ius civile. Ownership of a thing in Roman law was usually protected forever, until a limit of thirty years was introduced in 426 AD on actions by Theodosius - in other words, preventing the owner of a thing getting it back or seeking damages after thirty years. Usacapio was a form of acquisitive prescription - the passage of time entitled the holder to particular rights of acquisition. This right is a new right, one without reference to any existing rights. Usucapio assisted two cases: where a thing had been transferred improperly (for example, transferring a res mancipi by traditio), or where the transferor of a thing did not hold proper title (for example, sale by a non-owner). Requirements There were five requirements for the acquisition of ownership by usucapio. Firstly, the claimant must have had uninterrupted possession for the required period of time. The claimant must have gained the thing with iusta causa and in good faith (bona fides). The thing claimed must be capable of ownership, and must have been at no time been stolen or taken by force. =Possession= The required period of time was only one year for movables and two years for land. Res universitas, groups of things such as an inheritance which may include both movables and land, also came under the one year rule. This is widely attributed to the time of the Twelve Tables, including by Cicero. The requirement of extended possession is believed to have been originally the only requirement, although certain types of things were exempt. These included stolen things, the res mancipi under another's guardianship, and limes - five-foot strips required between adjoining land holdings. The time period would have formed the prohibitive part in early Rome, where the community was sufficiently small that the owner could easily identify and regain his goods - considering also that if they had been stolen, they could not be usucapted. Usucapio would therefore have been restricted in most cases to informal conveyance of res mancipi. As Rome grew, however, it became more and more likely that the owner would be away for a year or more. The Praetor extended the rules of possession to new cases, which came to form a central part of usucapio: for example, the case of the inheritor believing that formerly borrowed goods are part of his inheritance. =Iusta causa and good faith= Iusta causa (alternatively \\"iustus titulus\\") is a requirement, in essence, that the transfer would have been valid if not for one of the two cases mentioned above. This will be a recognised method of transfer - for example, gift or sale. This has to be in fact; it cannot rest on a mistaken belief in there being a sale or gift, which is the main difference between iusta causa and good faith in practice. Good faith is not easily defined, despite being a common concept in the Roman law. In the case of sale by a non- owner (or another defect in title), then it probably meant that the claimant believed he was becoming owner. However, the receiver of a res mancipi by traditio must surely realise the problem, but this does not prevent usucapio. The burden of proof was on anyone disputing the usucapio to show bad faith. The bad faith had to be shown at the point of the iusta causa - it was insufficient to show that the claimant later realised that the item had come from a non-owner. =Stolen or taken by force= The claimed must be a res habilis, an object capable of private ownership and not otherwise prohibited. Something that had at any point been stolen (furtum) or taken by force could not be usacapted. Furtum was much wider than theft in the modern criminal law (furtum was a civil action), involving most sorts of bad faith interference in another's property. This had the practical effect of extending the good faith requirement to the transferor as well as the transferee - for someone who sold, gifted or otherwise transferred the property of another in bad faith committed furtum. Indeed, that the transferor is a non-owner in fact means normally that at some point there has been furtum. Gaius, in book two of The Institutes gives two counter-examples: firstly, where a borrower has died, and his heir believes the thing to be part of his interitance and sells it; secondly, where a man with a usufruct over a slave woman, ignorant of the law, wrongly believes the child to be his and sells it. Land could not be stolen, but it could certainly be taken by force. In either case (theft or force) it is only if the owner from whom it has been stolen regains it, or considers it lost forever (i.e. abandons it), that a valid usucapio can take place. Given this strict limitation, usucapio must surely only have been about shifting the burden of proof to the claimant from the possessor, whose possession was usually easy to show. However, it remains a departure from usual Roman ideas of ownership. Bonitary ownership and good faith possession The two cases where usucapio could be said to create two classes of people - the \\"bonitary owner\\" where formalities have not been complied with, and the \\"good faith possessor\\" where, for example, the seller is not the owner. Under statute, neither class of persons had any more protection than a mere possessor. As such, their claim lay solely against their immediate dis-possessor, and were without an action against any further dis-possessors. The Praetor granted them further protection, probably in the late Republic. The bonitary owner was protected against anyone, the good faith possessor was protected with regards to everyone except the owner. To deny the owner the right of vindicatio against the good faith possessor would run contrary to the concept of the usucapio, with it effectively completed before the required time had passed. In the case of the bonitary owner, the Praetor provided a defence to the vindicatio if there had been a transfer (improper or not). It was typical of the Praetor to ignore technical formalities to achieve practical benefits, in this case certainty of ownership. If either the bonitary owner or good faith possessor was dis-possessed, he could under the normal law claim a possessory interdict against his dis-possessor, but this did not cover further people if possession had been further transferred. If that immediate dis-possessor was the owner, then the case would be the same as for vindicatio: the bonitary owner would have a claim, but the good faith possessor would not. If the immediate dis-possessor was not the owner, then both the bonitary owner and the good faith possessor would have a claim. This claim was the actio Publiciana. By giving the bonitary owner the protection of an owner, the Praetor had very much weakened the res mancipi distinction and come close to abolishing the need for mancipatio. The Romans did not speak of the bonitary owner as dominus (as a normal owner would be), but rather to say that he had the thing in bonis from which the term \\"bonitary\\" is derived. The Romans considered ownership unique and indivisible: accordingly, one either had the rights of ownership or one did not. The Praetor's distinction made this unclear. Ultimately, Justinian abolished res mancipi, so the bonitary owner became owner and this theoretical problem was solved. However, the position as to the good faith possessor relied on a concept of relative title, part of the common law, but something which was alien to Roman ideas of ownership. The Romans merely considered it possession, thus bypassing the theoretical problem.

Under Saddam Hussein, relations were manageable, especially after the Iran‚ÄìIraq War began in 1980. These manageable relations were soon quelled at the Gulf War, when Saddam's Iraq invaded Kuwait, leading to international sanctions on Iraq and a significant deterioration in Iraqi‚ÄìSaudi relations. In 1990, the land borders between the two countries closed due to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. However, after a due negotiations to reopen the borders to boost the trade relations, Saudi Arabia and Iraq decided to open the borders in October 2019. In 2014 after ISIL invaded Iraq King Abdullah tried to revive relations between Iraq and Saudi Arabia by setting up an embassy there for the first time since the Gulf War. King Abdullah also attempted to increase Iraqi‚ÄìSaudi relations by supporting the coalition in the fight against ISIS in Iraq. Nowadays relations have improved greatly and both countries have emphasized the close historical, religious, ethnic, tribal, linguistic, cultural and geographic ties as well as the promising potential for continuous future cooperation and the need of upholding the current cordial relations between the Saudi Arabian government and the Iraqi government.Will Iraq Realign Toward Saudi Arabia in 2018? - Fair Observer Fair Observer 17 January 2018A New Era Beckons For Iraqi-Saudi Relations War On The Rocks 2 February 2018Iraq keen to maintain strong relations with Saudi Arabia Middle East Monitor 2 April 2018 In 2019, Saudi Arabia opened its consulate in Baghdad. Moreover, 13 agreements were signed between the two countries. Saudi Arabia has also donated $500M to support exports of Iraq and $267M to support development projects. History At the creation of the Sykes‚ÄìPicot Agreement, the Hashemites ruled the kingdoms of Hijaz, Transjordan and Iraq. Once Ibn Saud established dominance in central Arabian Najd, he then proceeded to dominate much of the Arabian Peninsula and, with the help of the highly conservative Ikhwani forces, even conquered the Hashemite Kingdom of Hijaz in 1925. This was the beginning of an ideological struggle between the more conservative Salafi Islam (under Hanbali jurisprudence) and the Hanafi Islam practiced by the ruling Hashemite tribe in Iraq and Jordan. In 1958, no longer would the Hashemites rule Iraq. Instead, Iraq fell under anti-Imperial Arab nationalism, led by Brigadier General Abd al-Karim Qasim. With strong socialist elements, Iraq was seen to move towards the Soviet Union as Saudi Arabia was quietly moving towards the United States. In 1979 Saddam Hussein took control of Iraq and, due to the Iranian revolution in the same year, relations improved between Iraq and Saudi Arabia. Throughout the 1960s and into the early 1970s, Riyadh suspected Baghdad of supporting political movements hostile to Saudi interests, not only in the Arabian Peninsula but also in other Middle Eastern countries. Saudi‚ÄìIraqi ties consequently were strained; the kingdom tried to contain the spread of Arab Nationalism from Iraq by strengthening its relations with states such as Iran, Kuwait, Syria and the United States, all of which shared its distrust of Baghdad. Beginning in late 1974, however, Iraq began to moderate its foreign policies, a change that significantly lessened tensions between Riyadh and Baghdad. It began at the Rabat Arab summit in October 1974, where Jordan invited Iraq to listen to proposals for how it could resolve differences with Iran, Egypt, and the Saudis. Iraq agreed. Iraq responded with a \\"charm offensive\\" that resulted in better relations: > \\"High-level Iraqi officials, including Vice President Saddam Hussein and > President Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr, visited the Kingdom, and ranking Saudis, > like Crown Prince Fahd, paid return visits to Baghdad. Iraq ended propaganda > efforts critical of the Saudi rulers and suspended covert activities in the > Kingdom. In June 1975, the two states settled lingering border issues, > agreeing to divide equally the diamond shaped 'neutral zone' carved out by > the British in the 1920s.\\" Saudi Arabia's diplomatic relations with Iraq were relatively cordial by the time the Iranian Revolution climaxed in 1979. The Saudis and Iraqis felt threatened by the Iranians' announcements that they would export Islamic revolution, and this shared fear fostered an unprecedented degree of cooperation between both countries. Although Riyadh declared its neutrality at the outset of the Iran‚ÄìIraq War in 1980, it helped Baghdad in non-military ways. For example, during the eight year conflict, Saudi Arabia provided Iraq with an estimated US $25 billion in low-interest loans and grants, reserved part of its production from oil fields in the Iraq‚ÄìSaudi Arabian Neutral Zone for Iraqi customers, and also assisted with the construction of an oil pipeline to transport Iraqi oil across its territory. Despite its considerable financial investments in creating a political alliance with Iraq, Saddam Hussein continued to press claims against Kuwait. In August 1990, only two years after Baghdad and Tehran had agreed to cease hostilities, Iraqi forces invaded and occupied Kuwait. Saudi Arabia took action against Iraq, claiming Iraq's actions posed a serious threat to its security, and requested the United States and 32 other countries to bring troops into the kingdom. Riyadh's fears concerning Baghdad's ultimate intentions prompted Saudi Arabia to become involved directly in the war against Iraq during January and February 1991. The kingdom's air bases served as the main staging areas for aerial strikes against Iraqi targets, and for personnel of the Saudi Army who participated in both the bombing assaults and the ground offensive. Iraq responded by firing several Scud-B missiles at Riyadh and other Saudi towns. This conflict marked the first time since its invasion of Yemen in 1934 that Saudi Arabia had fought against another Arab state. Saudi and Coalition forces also repelled Iraqi forces when they breached the Kuwaiti-Saudi border in 1991 ( see Battle of Khafji). https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a360696.pdf Consequently, postwar Saudi policy focused on ways to contain potential Iraqi threats to the kingdom and the region. One elements of Riyadh's containment policy included support for Iraqi opposition forces that advocated the overthrow of Saddam Hussein's government. In the past, backing for such groups had been discreet, but in early 1992 the Saudi's invited several Iraqi opposition leaders to Riyadh to attend a well-publicized conference. To further demonstrate Saudi dissatisfaction with the regime in Baghdad, Crown Prince Abdallah permitted the media to videotape his meeting with some of the opponents of Saddam Hussein. In spite of this, the Saudi leadership opposed the U.S. plan to invade Iraq in 2003 and did not join the Coalition. Their fears and warnings that Iraq would fracture along sectarian and political lines proved accurate. What was worse for Saudi Arabia was the strengthening of the Shi'ites in Iraq, seen as Iran's proxy. This drew the Iranian threat much larger for the Kingdom, forcing them to weaken Iranian influence in Iraq through covertly supporting Al-Qaeda in Iraq (2004 ‚Äì later Islamic State of Iraq 2006, Islamic State of Iraq and Syria 2013, Islamic State 2014.) This of course undermined attempts at reconciliation between the Iraqi and Saudi governments. Iraq has, as a result, always chosen Iran over Saudi Arabia as their closer ally. In 2009, Iraq named its first post-Gulf War ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Ghanim Al-Jumaily. In January 2012, Iraqi foreign minister Hoshyar Zebari stated that Saudi Arabia had named its first ambassador to Iraq since 1990.Saudi Arabia names new envoy to Iraq as Baghdad seeks inclusive Arab League summit The Washington Post 21 February 2012 Fahd Abdul Mohsen Al- Zaid, the Kingdom's ambassador to Jordan, would serve as non-resident ambassador flying regularly from Amman to Baghdad.Kingdom appoints ambassador to Iraq Arab News In 2014, former Prime Minister of Iraq Nouri al-Maliki stated that Saudi Arabia and Qatar started the civil wars in Iraq and Syria, and incited and encouraged terrorist movements, like ISIS and al-Qaeda, supporting them politically and in the media, with money and by buying weapons for them. Saudi Arabia denied the accusations which were criticised by the country, the Carnegie Middle East Center and the Royal United Services Institute. On February 25, 2017, Saudi foreign minister Adel al-Jubeir visited Iraq ‚Äì the first such visit by a Saudi foreign minister since 1990.https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-39090914 In August 2017, it was reported that the border crossing between Iraq and Saudi Arabia would be reopened. This would be the first time the border was open after approximately 27 years.

The percentage retained by the meshulach is sometimes as high as 49%. In response to the public perception of fraudulent meshulachim, some communities (for example, Baltimore) have appointed rabbis or panels to investigate meshulachim and issue them certificates to attest for the validity of their cause.

It features the Bellah√∏j Houses, a functionalist housing project, as well as parkland with an open-air theatre. The 37 metre high hill situated in Bellah√∏j Park is the highest point in Copenhagen. The area offers an extensive view over the skyline of Copenhagen. History and description King Charles X Gustav of Sweden's fortified camp Carlstad was located at the site during his siege of Copenhagen from 1658 to 1660. The area later belonged to a farm which moved out from the village of Utterslev in 1791. The estate was acquired by Copenhagen Municipality in 1932. The area was used for agricultural shows between 1938 and 1967. The old farmhouse was converted into a restaurant in 1938 and is still used as such. Copenhagen Municipality sold the building in 2005 The Bellah√∏j Houses contains 28 tower blocks. Each block has between 9 and 13 floors. The housing project was among the earliest in Scandinavia. It was completed in 1956. The park contains an open-air theatre which was built from surplus earth from the construction of the Bellah√∏j Houses in the 1950s. It was designed by Carl Theodor S√∏rensen and seats 2,000 spectators. In 1965, Copenhagen Municipality built an exhibition centre, Bella Center, which kept its name when it moved to its current location on Amager in 1975. The old building is now used as a sports centre under the name Gr√∏ndal MultiCenter. Other buildings in the area include Bellah√∏j School, a hostel and Bellah√∏j Swimming Centre. The park also contains three or four burial mounds from the Bronze Age. In the southeastern corner is a small wooded area. The trees are mainly beech and ash.

A local primary school, Pensax Church of England school, closed in 2003.Article from the Worcester News, 2002 - 'Pensax Runs Out of Pupils' The name Pensax is a combination of the Celtic words \\"pen\\" (hilltop) and \\"sais\\" (Englishman, Saxon). Unlike many English place names with Celtic elements, the modifier follows the basic noun, as is customary in Celtic languages. This indicates that Brittonic speakers coined the name, rather than Old English speakers borrowing a Brittonic element.John Baker and Jayne Carroll, \\"The Afterlives of Bede's Tribal Names in English Place-Names\\" (2020) The close village of Menith Wood also has a Celtic name meaning mountain/hill, this time derived from the Welsh language word \\"mynydd\\". Nearby, too, lies the River Teme, whose name comes from the Celtic \\"tamesis\\" (the dark one), the same as the rivers Thames and Tame. All of this points to a strong Celtic speaking population having still resided in this area after the Anglo Saxons migrated into the region and took over the local government. Following the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 Pensax Parish ceased to be responsible for maintaining the poor in its parish.

Furthermore, the liberal contingent is much more represented in the non-political civil rights activism and advocacy organizations in Nigeria.

Kassel: AGON Sportverlag VfL made its first appearance on the national stage in 1930 after a successful season in the regional west German league. They were put out of the national playoffs through a 0‚Äì1 loss to Eintracht Frankfurt in the round of 16. A win in the Westdeutscherpokal (West German Cup) propelled the team into the national level playoff once again in 1932, and they again were put out in an eighth final round matchup, this time by Hamburger SV (1‚Äì3). Another Westdeutscherpokal win in 1933 was followed by another eighth final exit, 0:2 to SV M√ºnchen 1860.

They enjoyed success there early on winning consecutive division titles in 1934 and 1935. Their 1935 playoff run ended with a 2‚Äì4 semifinal loss to VfB Stuttgart. After a second-place result the following season the team's performance fell off dramatically and they struggled to remain in the Gauliga. They were relegated in 1939, but returned in the 1941‚Äì42 season and remained in first division competition until the end of World War II. Through this period the club made appearances (1935, 1936, 1939) in the early rounds of the Tschammerpokal tournament, predecessor to today's DFB-Pokal (German Cup). Immediately following the war, Benrath played in the Bezirksliga Berg-Mark and advanced to the regional Niederrhein final where they dropped a 2‚Äì0 decision to Rot-Wei√ü Oberhausen. By 1947, they were part of the Landesliga Niederrhein (III) and in 1949 qualified for the 2nd Oberliga West (II) where they played a single season. They had another single season turn in the second tier in 1954‚Äì55 before capturing an Amateurliga Niederrhein (III) title in 1957. They parlayed that division title into a national amateur championship with a 4‚Äì2 victory over Alemannia 90 Berlin and returned to the 2. Liga-West for a five-year-long stint. VfL earned lower table finishes there until finally being relegated in 1962 to the Amateurliga Niederrhein (III). After more than a decade of indifferent results, the club slipped out of sight into lower level local competition in 1973. Nowadays the club plays in the tier six Landesliga Niederrhein.

The fort was the first U.S. military installation west of the Mississippi, in the newly acquired Louisiana Territory, and served as a starting point for many expeditions to the American West.

Located on the south bank of the Missouri River, in present- day Missouri, Fort Belle Fontaine was first a Spanish military post.Luttig, John C., and edited by Stella Madeleine Drumm, Journal of a Fur-trading Expedition on the Upper Missouri: 1812-1813. Kansas City, MO: The Missouri Historical Society, 1920 After the Louisiana Purchase, by a treaty made between the United States Government, signed by William H. Harrison and representatives of the Native American Sac and Fox tribes (on November 3, 1804), the fort became a fur trading post of the United States Government. Rudolf Tiller served as factor and Colonel Thomas Hunt served as the military commander. The trading post was discontinued after 1808, and from 1809 to 1826 the facility served as a United States military fort. During that time period, from about 1809 to 1815, the fort served as the headquarters of the Department of Louisiana, and was the regional Army headquarters during the War of 1812. Its sister forts were Fort Osage along the Missouri near modern Kansas City, which controlled trade with western Indians; and Fort Madison in what is now Iowa, which controlled trade of the Upper Mississippi. Preservation Part of the site of the fort is preserved as the Fort Belle Fontaine County Park, a unit of the park system of St. Louis County, Missouri. An archaeological site associated with the fort was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016.

The mall is the only regional shopping mall in a radius. The mall's anchor stores are Boscov's, Burlington, and Dick's Sporting Goods. It also features a 16 screen cinema stadium-style Regal Cinemas movie theater. The Centre at Salisbury is the largest shopping mall on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. History Construction began in April 1989 on The Centre of Salisbury, on a parcel. The mall opened for business on July 27, 1990, located just north of the Salisbury Mall, which was built in 1968. The opening signaled the beginning of the end for the aging Salisbury Mall, which came about when it became obvious that an extension of the Salisbury bypass from U.S. Route 13 north over to U.S. Route 50 west was necessary to relieve the downtown congestion. It is no coincidence that The Centre at Salisbury is situated such as it is, at the juncture of two major highways‚Äîenjoying on the one hand, local business from U.S. Route 13, and beach traffic from the bypass on the other. The Centre was built at this location with that vision in mind. The Centre opened with anchors Hecht's, Boscov's, JCPenney, Sears, and Montgomery Ward. The newly built Centre at Salisbury was able to attract more upscale establishments that were absent from the Salisbury Mall, including amenities that were standard at most regional shopping malls, like a food court and a modern 10 screen multi-plex theater (later 16 screens). Before, most shoppers would have to travel more than two hours away to the Baltimore/Washington, DC., Norfolk or Philadelphia metropolitan areas to shop upscale stores. In December 1995, Macerich acquired the mall from developer Salisbury Springhill Ltd. In December 2013, Macerich Salisbury LP sold the mall to Rouse Properties. In 2000, Montgomery Ward announced it would be going out of business. The space formerly occupied by Montgomery Ward was transformed into the new Regal Cinemas with additional outdoor retail space. The Hecht's store became Macy's in 2006 after Federated Department Stores purchased May Department Stores, the owner of Hecht's. On January 15, 2014, it was announced that the JCPenney store would be closing as part of a plan to close 33 locations nationwide. JCPenney closed on May 3, 2014. On December 18, 2017, it was announced that Burlington Coat Factory would open a store in the former JCPenney space. Burlington Coat Factory opened on September 15, 2018. On December 28, 2018, Sears announced that it would be closing as part of a plan to close 80 stores nationwide. The store closed in March 2019. On January 6, 2020, it was announced that Macy's store would be close as part of a plan to close 125 stores nationwide. The store closed in March 2020. Current stores The Centre at Salisbury features 78 stores and eateries, including 3 anchor stores, food court, 16-screen movie theater, and children's softplay area. The food court features a Ruby Tuesday restaurant. Restaurants around the mall include Chuck E. Cheese's, Red Lobster, Olive Garden, Longhorn Steakhouse, and Greene Turtle. A Vernon Powell Shoes is also outside the mall. The Centre at Salisbury is close to other major shopping centers, including The Commons (a DDR Corp - The Commons Property Page The Commons Property Page center, the Lord Salisbury Center, and many other stores, strip malls, and restaurants.

She was considered a hero and a role model for women at one of the last schools she taught at, \\"No 151 en la zona 7\\". Since 1979, she has dedicated herself to social struggles. As a consequence of her constant protesting, she has received thousands of death threats. She has also appeared in Amnesty International videos that portray social struggles in Guatemala.  Politics  Montenegro was elected to Congress in 1996 and, since then, has dedicated herself to monitoring the functions of multiple public institutions, including the armed forces, where she managed to detect abnormal activity that caused the illicit enrichment of several army officials. Since 2004, she has dedicated herself to building her own political party, Encuentro por Guatemala, for which she received public support. Her political party united with Visi√≥n con Valores, which obtained six seats in Congress, giving her another term of office for the 2008-12 legislative session, as second vice president. In October 2019, she lost her parliamentary immunity as a result of accusations of illegal funding of her political party.https://www.publinews.gt/gt/noticias/2019/01/09/reaccion- nineth-montenegro-jueza-recomienda-retirarla-la-inmunidad.html  Awards  She was named person of the year by various magazines and other media reports.

The study involves 25 major epilepsy centers and more than 150 scientists and clinical staff around the United States, Australia and Argentina. The goal is to create a repository of clinical and genetic information on a select group of patients with epilepsy. The hope is that this information will reveal new insights and improve diagnosis and treatment. EPGP is funded by the National Institutes of Health via The National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS). The long- term goal of EPGP is to identify potential molecular targets that could be the basis of much more specific and effective treatments for patients who have epilepsy, and the prevention of epilepsy in those at risk.  Background on genes and epilepsy  Although heredity has been known since antiquity to cause epilepsy, the progress to date in identifying the genetic basis of epilepsy has been limited primarily to the discovery of single gene mutations that cause epilepsy in relatively rare families. For the more common types of epilepsy, heredity plays a subtler role, and it is thought that a combination of mutations in multiple genes likely determine an individual‚Äôs susceptibility to seizures, as well as the responsiveness to antiepileptic medications.  Phenotyping  The approach to teasing apart the more complicated genetic factors in epilepsy requires a very large number of patients whose epilepsy has been extremely well characterized. EPGP investigators will be enrolling 3,750 patients and 3,000 controls over the course of the study. Details about seizure types, EEGs, imaging studies, and effects of treatment will be collected and archived in a central data repository, and all participants will be asked to submit a sample of blood as a source of their DNA. Once this first phase of the study is completed, genomic analyses will be used to identify potential connections between patterns of DNA sequences and specific characteristics of epilepsy in the study population.  Genotyping  Aim 1: Identify genetic variants of common forms of epilepsy = We hypothesize that a substantial portion of the inherited risk of epilepsy and pharmacoresistance is due to a small to moderate number of common frequency (frequency > 1%) allelic variants with modest to moderate relative risks. SubAim 1.1 will identify loci contributing to the occurrence and type of epilepsy. SubAim 1.2 will identify loci associated with pharmacoresponse to AEDs. = Aim 2: Determine genetic influence in rare, severe epilepsy = We will determine the role of de novo copy number polymorphisms (CNPs) in IS, LGS, and PMG/PVNH. We will evaluate the role of inherited CNPs in IS, LGS, and PMG/PVNH.

Widely used for both sport and hunting it has proven itself to be both accurate and reliable. It is an unregulated, pneumatic powered air gun available in both .177 and .22 calibres and with a choice of either single shot or multi-shot. It is one of the cheapest PCP air rifles available in the market. It was designed by BSA designer John Bowkett. Features The gun has a spring-assisted loading bolt, a match-accuracy barrel and a fully chequered stock. It comes equipped with scope mounts and silencer. Stocks in Beech and Walnut available as is a black synthetic stock. It is designed to be a lightweight stalking gun used for hunting vermin like rats and pigeons in cramped areas. It provides a two-stage, adjustable, match grade trigger which can be adjusted to provide a light pull weight. It has a manual safety to avoid accidental discharge. Unlike most other pneumatic air rifles that use the traditional bolt action system, the Ultra features a unique Micro-Movement Cocking (MMC) System for loading. The MMC is operated by means of a plunger at the fore end of the stock. In the UK, it is also available in FAC versions requiring a firearms licence. Shot count The Ultra has an unregulated power supply. Therefore, pellet speeds vary according to the pressure of the cylinder. The Ultra is equipped with a small cylinder, thereby providing very low shot count compared to other pneumatic rifles. It provides about 40 shots/fill in .22 when cylinder is set to 200 bar. The count is 35 shots/fill in .177 when cylinder is set to 232 bar. The lower shot count in .177 is because .177 pellets travel at higher speeds than .22 and hence more 'charge' is required to power them. It is now possible to get after-market pressure regulators fitted to Ultra's which give up to 100 full power (12 ft pound) on one charge. Multi-shot version The Ultra is also available in multi-shot version. This uses the BSA standard 10-shot rotary magazine. The MMC system allows the shooter to reload the rifle without taking the eyes or the rifle off target, thereby allowing the shooter quick follow-up shots. Drawbacks In the UK it is a standard practice to replace the BSA moderators with Weihrauch or Logun silencers to reduce the rifle's report. Separate after market fitments for regulators and bigger cylinders are available. The MMC action also did not enable the shooter to keep on target as the switch to release the probe was under the nose, then the probe would come out in a position behind the shooter's ear. Then the probe would have to be pressed in if using a multishot (not allowed when engaged in target shooting competitions) or a pellet rolled into the breech, then the MMC would have to be pulled back, lifting the barrel. Also, if the shooter wanted a bipod the best way was to put it on backwards so that the legs when folded point towards the trigger. It became popular to replace the BSA Scorpion barrel with that from an Ultra, leading to the \\"Scultra\\" and inspiring the design of the Ultra SE. \\"Ultra SE\\" The latest version (Ultra SE) features BSA's redesigned magazine, which boasts improved reliability over the previous model. The two- stage multi-shot system (MMC) has been replaced with a traditional bolt action assembly that increases the reload speed, and makes fitting and using a bipod considerably easier (due to the removal of the front plunger style cocking system). The hammer/valve assembly has been changed to a new 'Fast Strike' design which is claimed to increase consistency and shot count by around 20%. The factory fitted sound moderator has been replaced with a muzzle brake. The safety has been moved from the right to left hand side so as to not interfere with the bolt action. A pressure gauge is now present on the underneath of the stock, which enables the user to see how much charge is in the rifle.

He was best known for his work in Combat Zone Wrestling (CZW), and was noted for mixing his technical style with hardcore wrestling. In CZW, he was a two-time World Tag Team Champion (with Devon Moore and Lucky 13), two-time Ultraviolent Underground Champion, a one-time World Junior Heavyweight Champion and won Tournament of Death on two occasions. He announced his retirement at Tournament of Death 16, and wrestled his final match on September 9, 2017, which was covered on an episode of The Wrestlers. He also wrestled for Game Changer Wrestling (GCW), Westside Xtreme Wrestling (wXw), Big Japan Pro Wrestling (BJW), IWA Mid-South, IWA East Coast, and IWA Deep-South.

After training for a few months, Havoc made his debut in the student battle royal at Tournament of Death 4 on July 30, 2005. At one point during the match, Havoc was set on fire by fellow wrestler WHACKS.30 July 2005 He made his singles debut at the first annual Chri$ Ca$h memorial show on September 10, 2005.CZW Database - Wrestler Info He defeated fellow CZW Academy graduate Andy Sumner with a Death Valley driver off the ring apron through a barbed-wire board propped up on two chairs outside the ring. He started a long feud with DJ Hyde that included matches on CZW shows as well as STF (Stars of the Future) and NEXT shows. Havoc finally defeated Hyde at CZW's April 2006 show Any Questions? and, post-match, Hyde threw Havoc off of a balcony through a table.http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/_2006/ Havoc won the World Junior Heavyweight Championship at the third annual Chri$ Ca$h memorial show on September 8 by defeating Joker, Scotty Vortekz, \\"Diehard\\" Dustin Lee, and Drake Younger in a five-way match.Online World of Wrestling On December 1, Havoc made it to the finals of IWA Deep South's \\"Carnage Cup\\" tournament before falling to Freakshow.December 1st 'IWA Deep South Carnage Cup Death Match Tournament' A week later, on December 8, at CZW's flagship show, Cage of Death, Havoc was the last member of Team CZW left standing on the top of the cage at the end of the big Cage of Death match.Combat Zone Wrestling (2007)  Online World of Wrestling Havoc won the seventh annual Tournament of Death on May 17, 2008.

He was awarded the Ultraviolent Underground Championship at Decision '08, after then-Champion Drake Younger, who also held the World Heavyweight Championship gave him the title, following a four-way match. Havoc at CZW Tournament of Death 9 in 2010 Havoc made it to the finals of wXw's Gorefest II tournament in Germany, losing to Thumbtack Jack in a lighttubes and barbed- wire pits match. Havoc had defeated Thumbtack Jack the month before in the United States to retain his Ultraviolent Underground Title, which was covered on G4 Underground. During 2009, Havoc was embroiled in a bitter feud with Switchblade Conspiracy founder Sami Callihan. This culminated in the 11th annual Cage of Death match, with Callihan winning and attempting to cut Havoc with a knife, only to be cut off by the returning Necro Butcher. The following year, a feud erupted between Billy Gram's CULT FICTION faction (originally composed of MASADA, , Brain Damage, and JC Bailey) and Havoc's babyface faction, which came to be known as The Suicide Kings (originally Havoc, Eddie Kingston, Drake Younger, and Scotty Vortekz). During this feud, JC Bailey died, Eddie Kingston defected from the company, and Drake Younger turned on his friends, proclaiming himself \\"The Golden Boy\\" and aligning with CF. Devon Moore took the spot of Younger in the Suicide Kings, and toward the conclusion of the feud, occasional CZW participant and midwestern hardcore mainstay, Dysfunction, filled Kingston's spot, to bring the main event for Cage of Death 12 to an even four-on-four match. The Suicide Kings came out of the match victorious, and CF disbanded shortly thereafter. In the midst of that same year, at CZW Best of the Best X, Havoc defeated Jun Kasai to win the Ultraviolent Underground Championship for the second time. Havoc subsequently dropped the UVU belt to MASADA four months later, and the title has since been retired. From the remains of the Suicide Kings faction, Havoc declared that a new group was to be recognized, which he proclaimed to be \\"The Nation of Intoxication.\\" This group initially consisted of Havoc, Moore, and Vortekz, who quickly invited Lucky 13 (formerly CULT FICTION's \\"tHURTeen\\") to join them. Vortekz departed the group and the company shortly thereafter, but the Nation continued to prosper, eventually winning the World Tag Team Championship on two occasions, trading them back and forth with heel group, 4LOKO. The Nation became known almost as much for their drunken shenanigans and comical antics as for their trademark daredevil style, punctuated by the core members' ability to combine exciting high-flying maneuvers with the hard- hitting, risk-taking ultraviolent style that CZW has made its name with. Havoc subsequently become a semi-regular mainstay in Big Japan Pro Wrestling, as one of the most consistent representatives of CZW to compete in the legendary deathmatch promotion. On a 2012 tour, Havoc and his frequent travel partner, Drake Younger, represented CZW as participants in BJW's Round Robin Deathmatch Survivor League, the winner of which was to earn a shot at the BJW Deathmatch title. While both men had respectable showings, neither managed to advance far enough to be in title contention. Toward the end of the tour, Havoc and Younger ‚Äî longtime friends ‚Äî had a very public falling out at the BJW Dojo, in which they came to blows and had to be pulled apart by BJW Dojo members. This sparked a feud between the two that saw the return of long-missing CZW favorite, Scotty Vortekz, who had at different times been tag partners with both men. Vortekz made his allegiances known by siding with Younger to defeat Havoc and fellow Nation of Intoxication member, Lucky 13. In 2013, Havoc came out the victor in CZW's annual Tournament of Death, advancing over the likes of Rory Mondo and Big Japan Wrestling's young deathmatch prospect, Takumi Tsukamoto, then finally defeating his former friend and partner, Scotty Vortekz, in a 444 Lighttubes Death Match, in which eight-foot fluorescent bulbs were attached to the ropes on all four sides and scattered across the floor of the ring. Despite taking a great deal of punishment in the match, Havoc managed to reverse a top rope maneuver into his patented finisher, the General Order 24, onto a massive pile of bulbs for the pin. This makes Havoc one of only three two-time Tournament of Death champions in its fourteen-year history. Havoc lost to Rickey Shane Page in an Ultraviolent Hardcore Match at Cage of Death 18. Page pinned Havoc after giving him a top rope powerbomb through a plate of glass. During that event, the Nation of Intoxication dissolved and Havoc went his own way, getting into a feud with Alex Colon. During Tournament of Death 16, Havoc announced his retirement and that he would face off against Alex Colon at Down With The Sickness. At Once In A Lifetime, Havoc took part in a match against Atsushi Onita and his men from FMW. Havoc lost his match against Alex Colon to a standing ovation as DJ Hyde and the locker room cheered for him. It was then confirmed by CZW officials that Havoc had officially retired from professional wrestling. =Game Changer Wrestling (2020)= Having come out of retirement at a benefit show for Matt Tremont's H2O Wrestling the previous year, Havoc was named as part of a Tokyo tour promoted by Game Changer Wrestling (GCW), where he was involved in tag team deathmatches. On February 3, at Live Fast Die Young, Havoc teamed with Tremont and Isami Kodaka against Drew Parker, Jimmy Lloyd and Toshiyuki Sakuda, where Parker missed a 450 splash but Havoc hit him with a death valley driver for the win. On February 4, at Ready to Die, Havoc teamed with Alex Colon against Kodaka and Sakuda, in which Havoc performed a around the world slam, followed by a death valley driver (called a General Order 24) on Kodaka for the win. On February 5, at Art of War, Havoc teamed with Colon and Tremont against Kodaka, Kenji Fukimoto and Takashi Sasaki. Havoc took the pin after Team Japan performed the super double knees off a ladder onto a bundle of light tubes of which Havoc was underneath. On February 15, at Run Rickey Run, Havoc faced SHLAK in a death match, replacing the injured Masashi Takeda. Towards the end, Havoc went for a death valley driver but missed the moonsault follow up, allowing SHLAK to hit him with two piledrivers on lighttubes and gusset boards for the win. Personal life Havoc was married to Brianne Morrow from 2018 until her death from heart failure on April 4, 2020. Less than two months later, on May 31, Havoc died at the age of 34.

The Liquor Licensing Board of Hong Kong is responsible for licensing of alcohol serving establishments. For consumption on-premises The sale of liquor on a premises for consumption on that premises is not subject to any restriction on sale hours unless a special condition limiting hours is imposed by the Liquor Licensing Board on the liquor licence Cap 109 B laws of Hong Kong reg 17.http://www.legislation.gov.hk/eng/home.htm There are further restrictions if the premises are employing persons under the drinking age therein as to when they can work. ‚ÄîThere is no age restriction on drinking at a private residence or on drinking age at locations that are not the subject of liquor licenses. No licensee shall permit any person under the age of 18 years to drink any intoxicating liquor on any licensed premises - under Regulation 28. Drinking age There is no legal drinking age set in Hong Kong, however, with the effect of the \\"Dutiable Commodities (Amendment) Ordinance 2018\\" (Cap. 109 Hong Kong Law) since November 30, 2018, sale or supply of alcohol / intoxicating liquor to minors (aged below 18) in the course of business is prohibited. The maximum fine for selling or supplying intoxicating liquor to a minor, or selling intoxicating liquor via vending machines, is HK$50,000 on summary conviction. Those who obstruct inspectors during enforcement are liable to a maximum fine of HK$10,000 on summary conviction. Drunk driving The law against what is known as drink driving, impaired driving in Hong Kong is strictly enforced. Hong Kong's maximum blood alcohol level (BAL) is 55 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood, or 0.22 mg alcohol per litre breath alcohol content (BrAC). With effect from 9 February 2009, police officers in uniform can require a person who is driving or attempting to drive a vehicle on a road to conduct a breath test without the need for reasonable suspicion. In the new random breath test operations, the Police will use pre-screening devices to conduct the test to reduce delay and inconvenience to drivers. Fines for drivers found impaired: * Maximum fine of HK$25,000 and imprisonment for 3 years * Disqualification from driving for not less than 3 months on first conviction and not less than 2 years on second or subsequent conviction * Mandated to attend a driving improvement course * Incur 10 driving offence points (The same penalty applies for failing to provide specimens for breath, blood or urine tests without reasonable excuse).

Canine leishmaniasis was first identified in Europe in 1903, and in 1940, 40% of all dogs in Rome were determined to be positive for leishmaniasis.Dereure J., Pratlong F., Dedet, J.P (1999) Geographical distribution and the identification of parasites causing canine leishmaniasis in the Mediterranean Basin. Canine leishmaniasis: an update. Proceedings of the International Canine Leishmaniasis Forum. Barcelona, Spain Traditionally thought of as a disease only found near the Mediterranean basin, 2008 research claims new findings are evidence that canine leishmaniasis is currently expanding in continental climate areas of northwestern Italy, far from the recognized disease-endemic areas along the Mediterranean coasts. Cases of leishmaniasis began appearing in North America in 2000, and, as of 2008, Leishmania-positive foxhounds have been reported in 22 U.S. states and two Canadian provinces.Rosypal, Alexa. (2005) Characterization of Canine Leishmaniasis in the United States: Pathogenesis, Immunological Responses, and Transmission of an American Isolate of Leishmania infantum. Veterinary Clinics of North America Small Animal Practice Journal. Blacksburg, VA. Forms and symptoms Cutaneous * Alopecia * Skin lesions * Ulcerative or exfoliative dermatitis Visceral * Epistaxis (nose bleeds) * Kidney failure > increased urination and drinking * Ocular signs * Progressive loss of weight with decreased appetite * Swollen lymphnodes Cause Numerous strains and subgenus strains of Leishmania exist; with sandfly genome projects still underway, strains are still being discovered.http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/Sequencing/SeqProposals/SandFliesSeq.pdf In the Old World, leishmaniasis transmitted by sandflies of the genus Phlebotomus documented in dogs are: * L. donovani in Sri Lanka * L. infantum (began appearing dogs in the United States in 2000) New World leishmaniasis strains are spread by Lutzomyia; however, research speculates the North American sandfly could be capable of spreading, but this is to date unconfirmed. Dogs are known reservoirs of L. infantum, and the spread of disease from dog to dog has been confirmed in the United States. * Suspected causes of canine visceral leishmaniasis are geographic variants of the Leishmania donovani complex, including L. infantum, L. chagasi and L. donovani. The Mexicana (L. mexicana, L. amazonensis, L. venezuelensis, and L. pifanoi) and Viannia (L. braziliensis, L. guyanensis, L. panamensis and L. peruviana) strains are not commonly found in dogs. Subgenus Viannia strains are found only in Central and South America, all of which cause leishmaniasis in humans. =Transmission= Traditionally, canine transmission is directly from sandfly to dog. Cases in the United States have proven L. infantum transmission from dog to dog by direct contamination with blood and secretions, as well as transplacentally from an infected bitch to her pups. This mode of transmission seems to be unique to the L. infantum Mon1 strain found in the United States. Although in utero transmission is likely the predominant method of disease spread amount the L. infantum Mon1 strain, it is still a viable parasite (has not lost virulence factors associated with sandfly-uptake) which can be transmitted via sandfly bite. A Brazilian study of 63 puppies from 18 L. donovani-infected parents found no evidence of congential or transplacental infection. Diagnosis In the United States, certain breed clubs are strongly recommending screening for Leishmania, especially in imported breeding stock from endemic locations. For reasons yet unidentified The Foxhound and Neapolitan Mastiff seem to be predisposed or at higher risk for disease.Petersen CHF paper 2008 The Italian Spinone Club of America is also requesting all breeders and owners to submit samples for testing; the club reported 150 Spinone Italiano dogs have tested positive in the United States. In the United States, the following veterinary colleges and government bodies assist with testing and treatment of Leishmania-positive dogs: * Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Leishmaniasis in dogs * Iowa State University Department of Pathology * North Carolina State University College of Veterinary Medicine Diagnostic testing includes molecular biology and genetic techniques which provide high accuracy and high sensitivity/specificity. The most commonly employed methods in medical laboratories include Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assays, aka ELISA (among other serological assays) and DNA amplification via Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). The Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) method for detecting Leishmania DNA is a highly sensitive and specific test, producing accurate results in a relatively short amount of time. A study completed in which Foxhounds were tested using PCR showed that approximately 20% of the tested dogs were positive for leishmaniasis; the same population tested with serological/antibody assays showed only 5% positive.Petersen paper find notes Diagnosis can be complicated by false positives caused by the leptospirosis vaccine and false negatives caused by testing methods lacking sufficient sensitivity. Prevention In areas where the known vector is a sandfly, deltamethrin collars worn by the dogs has been proven to be 86% effective. The sandfly is most active at dusk and dawn; keeping dogs indoors during those peak times will help minimize exposure. Unfortunately, there is no one answer for leishmaniasis prevention, nor will one vaccine cover multiple species. \\"Different virulence factors have been identified for distinct Leishmania species, and there are profound differences in the immune mechanisms that mediate susceptibility/resistance to infection and in the pathology associated with disease.\\" In 2003, Fort Dodge Wyeth released the Leshmune vaccine in Brazil for L. donovani (also referred to as kala-azar in Brazil). Studies indicated up to 87% protection. Most common side effects from the vaccine have been noted as anorexia and local swelling. The president of the Brazil Regional Council of Veterinary Medicine, Marcia Villa, warned since vaccinated dogs develop antibodies, they can be difficult to distinguish from asymptomatic, infected dogs.Moreno, Saulo. 2004, October. Brazzil Magazine. Authorized use of Leishmania Vaccine. Made in Brazil. Avail online: http://www.brazzilmag.com/content/view/579/41/ Studies also indicate the Leshmune vaccine may be reliable in treating L. chagasi, and a possible treatment for dogs already infected with L. donovani. Treatment Currently, no cure exists for canine leishmaniasis, but various treatment options are available in different countries. Treatment is best coordinated with veterinary research hospitals. Treatment does vary by geographic area, strain of infection and exhibited symptoms. Dogs can be asymptomatic for years. Most common treatments include: L. donovani * Antimony resistant so amphotericin B is recommended L. infantumhttp://asmcourse.ivic.ve/articulos/urbina/urbina3.pdf * Amphotericin B * Meglumine antimoniate * Miltefosine * Allopurinol There have been no documented cases of leishmaniasis transmission from dogs to humans. Research directions In the United States, research examining the Foxhound and Neapolitan Mastiff is scheduled to continue into 2011 at the University of Iowa. The goals of this project are to screen for the presence of the Leishmania parasite DNA and to be a stepping stone to future research of T-cell function with the hopes of understanding canine leishmaniasis as a model for better understanding human leishmaniasis. * Foxhound submissions forms * Neapolitan Mastiff submission forms Also in the United States, the CDC is monitoring Italian Spinones, with no end date indicated on sample submissions.

This is in contrast to hypertelorism, in which the distance between the whole eyes is increased. Telecanthus and hypertelorism are each associated with multiple congenital disorders. The distance between the inner corners of the eyelids is called the intercanthal distance. In most people, the intercanthal distance is equal to the width of each eye (the distance between the inner and outer corners of each eye). The average interpupillary distance is 60‚Äì62 millimeters (mm), which corresponds to an intercanthal distance of approximately 30‚Äì31 mm. Traumatic telecanthus refers to telcanthus resulting from traumatic injury to the nasal-orbital-ethmoid (NOE) complex. The diagnosis of traumatic telecanthus requires a measurement in excess of those normative values. The pathology can be either unilateral or bilateral, with the former more difficult to measure.  Systemic associations  Telecanthus is often associated with many congenital disorders. Congenital disorders such as Down syndrome, fetal alcohol syndrome, cri du chat syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, Turner syndrome, Ehlers‚ÄìDanlos syndrome, Waardenburg syndrome often present with prominent epicanthal folds, and if these folds are nasal (most commonly are) they will cause telecanthus.  Etymology  Telecanthus comes from the Greek word œÑ·øÜŒªŒµ (tele, \\"far\\") and the Latin word canthus, meaning corner of the eyelid.

Early life Born Cecily April Mead, at Langton Herring, Dorset, in 1920, she was educated as a small child in France and later at St Mary's, Calne, in the west of England. She studied the flute at the Guildhall School of Music, but did not go on to become a professional musician. Marriage and children In 1941, aged 20, she married Kyril Zinovieff, a Russian √©migr√© who took the surname FitzLyon and who worked at the Ministry of Defence. The couple had two sons, Sebastian, who became a business man in France and later in Russia, and Julian, an information specialist. The family lived in Golders Green and later in Chiswick, moving in literary circles and having many Russian friends. Literary career Lorenzo da Ponte, the subject of FitzLyon's first biography FitzLyon learned Russian from her husband's mother. In the 1950s, she approached a publisher with translations of stories by Anton Chekhov which were unknown in the UK, which she had produced jointly with her husband. They were published in 1953 as The Woman in the Case and Other Stories. This was a great success and was quickly followed later the same year by translations of three short novels by Leo Tolstoy (Three Novellas, 1953). Of these, she translated two herself. She continued to translate literature from Russian, French and Italian, but began to concentrate on historical biographies. She published the first life of Lorenzo da Ponte, Mozart's librettist who had been a revolutionary in Venice, debunking Ponte's own unreliable memoirs (The Libertine Librettist, 1955). After that, she translated √âmile Zola's Au bonheur des dames (Ladies Delight, 1957), the correspondence between Romain Rolland and Richard Strauss, and some recent French novels. She produced biographies of two Spanish singers, the daughters of Manuel del P√≥pulo Vicente Garc√≠a: firstly of Pauline Garc√≠a- Viardot, who was a star of nineteenth century France (The Price of Genius, 1964), and later a new life of Pauline Viardot's sister Maria Malibran, one of the most notable opera singers of the century (Maria Malibran: diva of the romantic age, 1987). In researching her book on Viardot, FitzLyon found much on the singer's long relationship with Ivan Turgenev, and in 1983 she wrote the catalogue for the London Theatre Museum's centenary exhibition 'Turgenev and the Theatre'. In 1975 she published Nobody: or, The Disgospel according to Maria Dementnaya, a translation of a Russian samizdat novel, Nikto, which was about the seamy side of the life of Bohemian dissidents and had been smuggled out of Russia in 1966. She went on to translate verse from Russian into both English and French, contributed to Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, and wrote articles and reviews, including work for Encounter, the Times Literary Supplement and The Literary Review. The FitzLyons visited Russia both before and after the collapse of Communism. For about twenty-five years before her death, April FitzLyon was the General Secretary of the Russian Refugees Aid Society, and she made many broadcasts for BBC Radio. At the time of her death, her publisher John Calder called her \\"a scholar of the old school\\".

The goal of these transmissions was to provide colour broadcasting in these intervals for use by television shops and engineers (the 'trade') to adjust their television sets. The earliest such transmission was made in 1956 (on the then sole BBC channel) but regular all day long films ran from autumn 1967; the last one was in August 1973. In all, 158 different films were broadcast; on average, each film was shown 90 times. The frequent broadcasting of the films made them well known to viewers of the time. The one most frequently shown was The Captive River (1960), which was shown 525 times. The short film Giuseppina (1959), which had won an Academy Award, was shown 158 times and became the last trade test colour transmission on August 24, 1973. Other frequently broadcast films included The Home Made Car (1963), The North Sea Quest (BP, 1967), Overhaul (1957), Crown of Glass (1967), Roads to Roam (1967), The Small Propeller (BP, 1967), The Cattle Carters (BP, 1962) ‚Äì with a theme song sung by Frank Ifield, Prospect for Plastics (1962), Evoluon (1968) and Cantagallo.

Her work has been featured at a number of notable galleries and covered in The New York Times, The New Yorker, and The Village Voice.  Works and career  Form follows function in that Taylor employs marquetry in the service of content. She subverts inlay's decorative status by constructing narratives that are neither decorative, nor memorial, nor facile, but rather freezing the abject, mundane and ordinary in time. Marquetry was first popularized under Louis XIV in the 17th century in the unprecedented luxury of Versailles.

Partially preserved in Van Meter State Park, it is the site of one of the largest early Contact Native villages in the region, which was occupied by the Missouri tribe from c. 15th to the late 18th centuries, and was probably the principal village area occupied by them at the time of their first contact with Europeans. The site was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1964. Description The Utz Site is located in central Missouri, north of the city of Marshall and south of Miami. The site is roughly in size, most of which is privately owned land. A small portion is included in an outlying part of Van Meter State Park, whose main feature is the so-called Old Fort; the rest is on private land. It is set on a series of grassy hills, roughly south of the present course of the Missouri River. The site was first noted in the documentary record by French explorers, beginning with Pere Marquette, whose 1673 map placed \\"Messourit\\" Indians here. It appears to have been abandoned about 1728, around the time a French fort on the river to the north was also abandoned, as there is a distinct absence of European trade goods from after that time. The site has been known for some time, due in part to its proximity to the Old Fort's distinctive earthworks, and was first studied archaeologically in the 1940s. The ancestral people preceding the Missouri tribe, who also lived on the Utz site, are defined as Oneota.

The original PC version was updated with a corrected aircraft model once the Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk was declassified and with 256-color VGA graphics instead of the original's 16-color EGA, among other changes. Gameplay The F-19 of the original game, which was published before the real fighter's specifications became public, carried weapons in four weapons bays. Given that the real stealth fighter's payload capacity fell short of that offered in F-19, the sequel gave players the choice of aircraft: a \\"realistic\\" model carrying weapons in only two payload bays, or a variant retaining the four bays of the plane of the first game. In the PC version, both models of fighter resembled the F-117. The new game introduced new theatres of warfare such as Cuba and Operation Desert Storm (in the wake of the Persian Gulf War, the Iraqis were no longer the allied nation that they had been in the previous game). Missions typically encompassed both primary and secondary targets, selected from a variety of objectives from photographing facilities (one selected weapon would have to be a high resolution camera) to bombing various ground targets. An advanced flight plan editing routine allowed you to adjust waypoints to successfully skirt pulse and doppler ground radar sites; the default flight plan would often take the plane's track into areas where it would be detected. Missions started on the runway of the originating base and ended with the pilot successfully landing at the recovery base. A \\"time compression\\" feature allowed the player to speed up the clock during missions. An improved 3D object rendering system, and 256-color graphics, provided improved target viewing on a remote camera view in the cockpit. Likewise, the player could change viewing angles around the plane, outside the plane, and even reverse target view to see the aircraft passing overhead from the position of the target. This last could also be performed from the vantage point of patrolling enemy fighters. The game's missions have the player flying at a low altitude, though the actual F-117 mission profile involved launching weapons from high altitude. In keeping with the \\"stealth\\" nature of the game, most missions were during nighttime, though a cheat command allowed the player to switch the mission to daytime. Points per mission were awarded for success or failure, as well as radar and visual detection, and identification, by enemy installations and aircraft. High scores were naturally awarded for entering enemy airspace, accomplishing the primary and secondary mission objectives, and departing, all without being detected by the enemy. (The game's manual included in-depth discussion of types of radar detection and how to avoid it, called \\"threading the needle.\\") Release Originally released for the PC DOS in 1991, the game was ported to the Amiga, Macintosh and PC-98 in 1993‚Äì1994. Its 3-D engine was also optimised and used to create the graphics for Task Force 1942: Surface Naval Action in the Pacific in 1992. Tommo purchased the rights to this game and digitally publishes it through its Retroism brand in 2015. In October 2014, the game was released on Steam. Reception Computer Gaming World in 1991 called F-117A \\"a great simulation. MicroProse has again created a game that is engrossing, challenging and educational.\\" A 1992 survey in the magazine of wargames with modern settings gave the game four stars out of five. and a 1994 survey gave it three-plus stars. The game received the rating of 93% by Computer and Video Games,Computer and Video Games 119 (October 1991) and scored 92% from Amiga Format. Most of other reviews were less enthusiastic, but usually with the ratings still over 80%.

The campus is located in the borough of Lennoxville, of Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada. Like the other campuses of Champlain Regional College, the Lennoxville campus is an English-language public post-secondary institution. Champlain College Lennoxville shares a campus with its neighbour, Bishop's University. History Champlain Regional College, the fourth English language college established in Quebec, was established on April 7, 1971. The College is named after Samuel de Champlain: seventeenth century explorer, fur trader, writer and far-sighted administrator of New France. With its three widely separated locations, Champlain was the first multi-regional college in the CEGEP network. Champlain Lennoxville was opened in 1972. It is situated in the Eastern Townships on an attractive site which it shares with Bishop's University.  Campus Life  The college in spring.The fact that Champlain Lennoxville is located in a rural setting has contributed to an increasing numbers of students who seek an alternative to continuing their post-secondary education in an urban environment. As a CEGEP located on a university campus, Champlain Lennoxville offers its students complete access to university facilities. Classrooms, library, laboratories, residences, and athletics are shared by university and college students. Champlain Lennoxville has a residential complex which consists of 6 buildings with a total of ninety furnished apartments of 3 or 4 bedrooms. All apartments are designated male or female in co-educational buildings.  The CEGEP System  In the English-language sector of Quebec's educational system, students were formerly able to go directly from high school (after completion of Grade XI) to university. In 1967, the Quebec government passed the General and Vocational Colleges Act, providing for a new level of education following high school, the collegial level. Each college is an independent public corporation, separate from both high schools and universities. These community colleges, commonly called CEGEPs after the initials of the French name, \\"Coll√®ge d'enseignement g√©n√©ral et professionnel\\", are distinctive institutions in Quebec. They offer two-year general programs, leading to university studies, and three-year technological programs serving a wide variety of interests. Tuition-free, the junior colleges are open to all residents of Quebec who have completed secondary level and who can meet the standards required for successful completion of the collegial programs. Programs The CEGEP offers two types of programs: pre-university and technical. The pre-university programs, which take two years to complete, permit students to enter into a 3-year bachelor program in a Qu√©bec university.Champlain College Lennoxville - Prospective Student - Programs - Pre-university *Science Program ‚Äî Pure & Applied Sciences Option *Science Program ‚Äî Health Sciences Option *Science Program ‚Äî Computer Science and Mathematics Option *Social Science ‚Äî General Profile *Social Science ‚Äî Psychology Profile *Social Science ‚Äî Commerce Profile *Social Science ‚Äî Mathematics Profile *Social Science ‚Äî Criminology Profile *Creative Arts, Literature & Languages ‚Äî Creative Arts Profile *Creative Arts, Literature & Languages ‚Äî Languages and Communications Profile *Fine Arts *Liberal Arts (Histoire et Civilisation) The career programs, which take three years to complete, apply to students who wish to pursue a skill or trade.Champlain College Lennoxville - Prospective Student - Programs - Career *Special Care Counselling *Accounting and Management Technology *Computer Information Systems Mobile Information Technology *Nursing Technology In addition, the College provides Continuing Education and services to business.

It is roughly in size, and is bounded by Bouchelle Avenue, Connaway Hall, Rollins Street, and College Avenue. Once in a rural area, the field is now surrounded by built-up portions of Columbia. It is subdivided into plots measuring . History The field was established by Dean J.W. Sanborn, who sought to understand the value of manure as a fertilizer, and the use of crop rotation. In 1914, emphasis was shifted away from manure and toward chemical fertilizers. Other experiments focused on the recovery of exhausted soils. The plots continue to be used today for long-term experimentation on differing schemes for the management of agricultural lands.

WMC was formed from what was the Wisconsin State Chamber of Commerce, the Wisconsin Manufacturers Association and the Wisconsin Council of Safety in 1975. WMC engages in earned media, advocacy and business development. WMC came under fire in 1996 for an issue ad aimed at Democrats in the state. Initially, the ad was forced off the air but WMC sued to have the ad reinstated, citing free speech rights. The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel referred to WMC as \\"the state's most influential business lobbying group\\".  History and composition Building in Madison The Wisconsin Manufacturers Association, which merged with two other Wisconsin business organizations in 1975 to form Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce, was founded in 1911. Paul Hassett was the first president of the newly formed organization, which had approximately 2,500 charter members. Since its inception, WMC has lobbied for the passage of business-friendly legislation in the Wisconsin Legislature. As of 2008, WMC claims over 4,000 charter members among the business community in Wisconsin. It publishes two annual directories: one of state manufacturers and the other a directory of service companies. It also claims to represent 500 000 employees. = 1996 election = During the 1996 election, WMC sponsored a series of 'issue ads' against state democrats. The Wisconsin State Election Board blocked the ads, arguing that WMC violated state and federal election laws by running an election ad as group whose donor base was not divulged to the FEC and state election boards. WMC sued, citing free speech concerns. After two appellate court rulings against WMC, the State Supreme Court ruled narrowly in WMC's favor. _Wis. Mfrs. & Commerce v. State of Wis. Elecs. Bd._, 978 F.Supp. 1200 (W.D. Wis., 1997) State political leaders cited this supreme court case when preparing legislation in later years. = 2008 election = WMC spent more than 1.2 million dollars in support of Michael Gableman's campaign for State Supreme Court Justice, successfully ousting sitting Justice Louis Butler. Justice Louis Butler subsequently asserted that three cases in particular caused WMC to target him. One favored the families of three men killed when a giant crane collapsed during construction of Miller Park; another struck down the cap on medical malpractice damages for pain and suffering, and the third expanded the liability of paint manufacturers in cases of lead poisoning. This spending and subsequent advertisement were criticized by members of the Madison press, the state bar and the Brennan Center, a non-partisan policy center at New York University.  Activities and membership  WMC does not disclose their issue advocacy donors list to the public. WMC lobbies on behalf of its members \\"whenever the state legislature is in session\\" According to the Wisconsin Government Accountability Board, WMC was responsible for 1.1 million dollars in lobbying efforts during the 2007-2009 session of the state legislature. WMC also publishes ratings of Wisconsin legislators on a scale of 0 to 100. In 1989, WMC helped block passage of Wisconsin's family leave act on behalf of their members. In August 2008 the outgoing Chancellor of UW-Madison John Wiley has described the WMC as being \\"hijacked by highly partisan ideologically driven staff\\" and stating \\"WMC routinely opposes most measures favored by labor unions, and most measures aimed at improving the lot of entry-level and low-income workers who are essential to our economy. But this opposition is not a business or an economic position; it is a political position based on an era and an economy that no longer exist.\\" Beyond lobbying efforts, WMC commissions annual surveys of business owners, directories and information, and‚Äîthrough their non-profit Wisconsin Council of Safety‚Äîworkplace safety compliance information. WMC works with the state Department of Workforce Development to secure federal grants to train workers in Wisconsin.

The album was nominated for the 2008 Choice Music Prize. Recording and production Rocky O'Reilly and Shaun Robinson recorded Take the Whole Midrange and Boost It between March and October 2007. According to O'Reilly, the income from commercial usage of tracks from their previous album, Oppenheimer, was crucial in funding the recording of Take the Whole Midrange and Boost It. The band used multi-tracked elements such as layers of distorted guitars to lend a more live sound to the album. They also experimented with recording in different spaces to create distinct reverb effects. Recorded in summer 2007, the track \\"Support Our Truths\\" was the first recording produced at O'Reilly's Belfast studio Start Together. The drums were played inside the building's freight elevator. The band reached out to Matt Caughthran of the hardcore punk band The Bronx to record guest vocals for the track \\"The Never Never\\". Themes Lyrically, the album is rife with pop culture references, especially to American pop culture, due to the band's interest in American film and literature. However, the title of \\"Stephen McCauley for President\\" refers not to the American author but instead to the BBC Radio Foyle host. Reception Take the Whole Midrange and Boost It received generally positive reviews from critics. Tim Sendra, in a review for Allmusic, called the album a \\"self-contained bubble of weird pop giddiness\\". However, Sendra also noted that the album's lack of a \\"clearly defined\\" genre or style might deter wider commercial success. Drowned in Sound reviewer Dom Gourlay wrote that the band was \\"embracing all genres from shoegaze to metal and hip-hop\\". Gourlay concluded that the album was \\"as near to twisted pop perfection as you'll find anywhere\\", though both reviewers expressed a similar sentiment that the album could be sonically cloying, with Gourlay describing it as \\"saccharine\\" and Sendra writing that the music \\"makes no sense but sounds the way cotton candy tastes\\". In a review for Alarm, Mike Hilleary noted the influence of Brian Eno, Kraftwerk, and My Bloody Valentine, among others. The album was nominated for Raidi√≥ Teilif√≠s √âireann's Choice Music Prize, which is awarded annually to one album by an artist residing in the Republic of Ireland or Northern Ireland.

Hemingway moved to Milan, Italy in 1983, where he pursued a writing and translating career. His articles have appeared in several Italian newspapers such as l'Unit√† and Libero, and in American magazines and literary journals. Hemingway is currently working on a collection of short stories. Personal life As revealed in his memoir, Strange Tribe, Hemingway had a difficult childhood. His father suffered from bipolar disorder and his mother, Alice Thomas, is schizophrenic. Hemingway spent his early years being shuffled from one home to another, and dealing with his dysfunctional family. He eventually went to study history and Italian at U.C.L.A. and after graduating moved to Italy, as a way of distancing himself from his troubled family background. One of the unresolved questions for him was how his father, a cross-dresser and transsexual, could fit with the image that the public has of his grandfather as an icon of male masculinity. After leaving Italy and spending a year in Spain and three months in the Medoc in France, Hemingway now lives with his wife, Kristina and his daughter Jacqueline in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

It was first broadcast as part of the BBC's Darwin Seasonhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/darwin/ on BBC One and BBC HD from October to December 2009. The series takes a global view of the specialised strategies and extreme behaviour that living things have developed in order to survive; what Charles Darwin termed \\"the struggle for existence\\". Four years in the making, the series was shot entirely in high definition. Life premiered on 12 October 2009 in the United Kingdom consisting of ten 50-minute episodes. The opening programme gives a general introduction to the series, a second look at plants, and the remainder are dedicated to some of the major animal groups. They aim to show common features that have contributed to the success of each group, and to document intimate and dramatic moments in the lives of selected species chosen for their charisma or their extraordinary behaviour. A ten-minute making-of feature Life on Location aired at the end of each episode, taking the total running time to 60 minutes. Life is produced by the BBC Natural History Unit and The Open University. It is distributed under licence by the BBC in over 50 other countries, including by the Discovery Channel in the United States and Skai TV in Greece. The original script was written and narrated by David Attenborough.  Production Production team = Life was the first series commissioned by the then Network Controller of BBC One, Peter Fincham, just weeks after he took up the post in March 2005. It was reportedly one of the most expensive documentaries ever ordered by the broadcaster, with a budget of ¬£10 million (though the BBC have never confirmed this figure). The Natural History Unit's production team includes series producer Martha Holmes (Life in the Freezer, The Blue Planet) and executive producer Mike Gunton (Gal√°pagos, Life in the Undergrowth). Individual episodes were produced by Rupert Barrington, Adam Chapman, Martha Holmes, Neil Lucas, Patrick Morris and Ted Oakes. The specially-commissioned score was composed by George Fenton and performed by the Band of Life. The opening titles and brand imaging were created by Burrell Durrant Hifle. In February 2007, Gunton revealed that the BBC were looking for a new narrator for the series owing to Attenborough's imminent retirement. However, later that year it was announced that the veteran narrator would be collaborating on both this series and the forthcoming Frozen Planet. = Filming = The first year of production was spent researching possible stories for the series. The Life team contacted scientists and experts around the world in search of new discoveries to film, and new approaches to familiar subjects. Nearly three years of filming followed, involving 150 shoots on all seven continents, many of them full- scale expeditions to remote wilderness areas. New camera technology was used to build on the cinematic techniques first employed in Planet Earth, notably the pioneering use of stabilised helicopter-mounted cameras. The Life crew succeeded in using gyroscopic stabilisation to create steady shots from moving vehicles, even on rough terrain, allowing the cameras to track alongside reindeer and elephant herds for the first time. Miniature high-definition cameras were used extensively for the \\"Insects\\" programme. In the forests of Mexico, the crew erected a spider's web of cables in the canopy to give the sense of flying alongside millions of monarch butterflies. In Zambia, they filmed from a hot air balloon to avoid disturbing the huge flocks of straw- coloured fruit bats. Following recent debate about the use of artifice in natural history programmes, the BBC were more candid about sequences which had not been filmed in the wild. Close-ups of wild clownfish would have disturbed their natural behaviour, so captive animals were filmed in an aquarium at a Welsh university. Despite the best efforts of the film-makers, some sequences ended up on the cutting room floor. Scientists in Arctic Scandinavia had accumulated enough evidence to suggest that golden eagles were the main predators of reindeer calves, but an attack had never been witnessed. After two summers tracking the herds in Finland, cameraman Barrie Britton finally filmed a hunt in full. However, the attack had taken place nearly a mile away, and the footage was too distant to be considered for broadcast. = Television firsts = The budget and timescale for the series enabled the producers to set ambitious filming challenges, and expedition crews brought back several sequences which have never been shown before. Some involved highly specialised hunting behaviour that has only recently been discovered. In the shallow, muddy waters of Florida Bay, one pod of bottlenose dolphins have learned a unique hunting technique called mud-ring feeding. Aerial photography shows the lead dolphin circling a shoal of mullet, flicking its tail flukes to disturb mud on the seabed. The fish trapped inside the mud ring panic and leap out of the water to escape the trap, straight into the waiting mouths of the pod. In Kenya's Lewa Wildlife Conservancy, three cheetah brothers have learned to take on prey many times their own size. They are filmed bringing down an ostrich, but also hunt zebra, eland and oryx. A film crew travelled to the Falkland Islands to follow up reports of an orca that had learned to take elephant seal pups from a nursery pool. On the Indonesian island of Rinca, the first footage of Komodo dragons hunting a water buffalo corroborated new scientific evidence suggesting the dragons used venom to kill their prey. Other sequences had previously proved too difficult to film. The humpback whale heat run has been dubbed \\"the biggest battle on Earth\\", but the whales move so fast that underwater cameras struggle to keep up. The Life crew used cameras mounted on helicopters and boats along with a team of free-divers to follow the action. The biggest filming challenge was to show a year in the life of an oak woodland using timelapse photography. After capturing real-world footage of a Devon wood, the crew rebuilt the entire scene in a studio in Exeter and digitally superimposed 96 separate layers of footage to create the final one- minute sequence. The whole project took two years. Super high-speed cameras capable of shooting up to 8,000 frames per second were used to slow down dramatic action. For the first time, these were used underwater to reveal the hunting behaviour of sailfish. They were also used to show 'Jesus Christ lizards' running on water, the courtship flight of the marvellous spatuletail and flying fish leaving the water. The first footage showing Antarctic killer whales hunting a crabeater seal, but the seal survived. The pebble toad's strange escape method had been caught on tape for the first time.  Broadcast  Life debuted on British television on 12 October 2009, with a standard definition broadcast on BBC One and a high-definition simulcast on BBC HD. The series was sold to international broadcasters by the BBC's commercial arm, BBC Worldwide, and marketed under the BBC Earth brand used for all BBC-produced natural history content. The global success of Life was noted as one of the key factors behind BBC Worldwide's record profits in 2010. The series received its North American premiere on Discovery Channel Canada on 15 November 2009. In the US, the series premiered on 21 March 2010 with Attenborough's narration replaced by Oprah Winfrey reading from a different script tailored to American audiences. Each episode was curtailed in length to accommodate commercial breaks. The behind-the-scenes shorts were dropped for the same reason, and instead were compiled into an eleventh episode. Life was also acquired by several Latin American broadcasters and debuted on 18 March 2010 on Discovery Channel Latin America and Discovery HD Theater, with narration by Colombian singer Juanes. In Israel the series aired in July 2010 as part of the new IBA channel Channel 1 HD and it was narrated by Orna Banay. In Turkey, the series aired in May 2010 on NTV (Turkey). It was narrated by famous Turkish actor Tuncel Kurtiz. In Australia, an edited version (without Life On Location) with Attenborough's narration aired on ABC1 each Sunday at 7:30 pm from 25 July 2010. In Croatia the series aired each Saturday from 2 October 2010 on HRT1.  Episodes  Inside Life  A complementary children's TV series, Inside Life, aired on the CBBC Channel and followed young volunteers as they go behind the scenes with the Life production team and accompany the film-makers on expeditions in the field. It began airing on 13 October 2009. One Life In 2011, BBC Earth used Attenborough's footage of animals to create a documentary film called One Life, narrated by Daniel Craig.  Reception  The series was nominated for six Primetime Emmy Awards in July 2010. These included a nomination for Outstanding Nonfiction Series along with selections in a number of technical categories. The episode \\"Challenges of Life\\" went on to win the Outstanding Cinematography for Nonfiction Programming award. In June 2010, Life won two Rockies at the Banff World Television Festival for best wildlife and natural history programme and best documentary. In October 2010, Life was awarded the Jury's Special Prize at the Wildscreen Festival.  DVD, Blu-ray Disc and book  The series was released in the UK as Region 2, four-disc DVD (BBCDVD3068) and Blu-ray Disc (BBCBD0055) box sets by 2Entertain on 30 November 2009. Region 1 DVD and Blu-ray Discs of both the BBC and Discovery versions of the series were released on 1 June 2010. In Australia, a Region 4, four-disc DVD and Blu-ray Disc was released by ABC DVD/Village Roadshow on 7 October 2010. A hardcover book written by producers Martha Holmes and Michael Gunton accompanies the television series. Life was published in the UK by BBC Books () on 1 October 2009.

Biography  \\"Winter Roundup\\", by Ernest Fiene at the Department of Interior, Washington, D.C, 1938. Ernest Fiene was born in Germany in Elberfeld, Germany on November 2, 1894 to Henry and Maria Fiene. He fled Germany in 1912 to avoid military service in what would become World War I. Traveling first to the Netherlands, he continued on to the United States.The Prints of Ernest Fiene: A Catalogue Raisonn√©-chronology of the artist's life From 1914 to 1918 he studied at the National Academy of Design in New York City, and from 1916 to 1918 at the Beaux Arts Institute. In 1923, Fiene continued his study of printmaking at the Art Students League of New York. In 1921 he married Jeannette Etarre. In 1923, he had his first solo show at the Whitney Studio Club. The show was successful, and he secured an art dealer. His work was decidedly modern, depicting modern life and industry through color and shape through precisionism. From 1928 to 1929 Fiene studied in Paris and traveled in France. In 1932, he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship which allowed him to study mural painting in Italy. His work was sold as lithographs through the Associated American Artists' (AAA) mail-order catalogs for $5 each. Through his association with AAA, Fiene was hired in 1940, along with eight other prominent American artists, to document dramatic scenes and characters during the production of the film The Long Voyage Home, a cinematic adaptation of Eugene O'Neill's plays.\\"Cover Article, American Artist Magazine, September, 1940, pp. 4-14\\" His work was part of the painting event in the art competition at the 1932 Summer Olympics.

They were one of the first \\"Spirit-Filled\\" hardcore bands, along with Unashamed, Overcome, Focused and Zao.  Biography  Between 1990 and 1991, Ikthus, a local punk band consisting of vocalist Dave Bean, guitarist Jason Berggren, drummer Chris Carbonell and bassist Matt Fletcher, was formed. Flecher quit early on and was replaced by Chad Neptune, a friend of the band. Ikthus went on to disband later in 1993. However, Carbonell, Neptune, and Berggren sought to form a new band following this. Carbonell, Neptune, and Berggren eventually united with their friend Josh Colbert, who previously had performed in another Christian hardcore band called Endure. Nick Dominguez, also formerly of Endure and Tension, joined the band as a guitarist. Together, the five created the name of Strongarm. Strongarm released a demo, These Times That Try Men‚Äôs Souls, and had originally planned on signing to Victory Records, but eventually settled on Tooth & Nail Records. Strongarm recorded Atonement in 1995 and released it through Tooth & Nail. The album had been produced by famed hardcore producer Jeremy Staska, who would go on to work with Nonpoint and Poison the Well. Following the album's recording and release, Carbonell and Dominguez were fired from the band by Berggren in hopes to bring in new members. After Carbonell and Dominguez were fired, Strongarm hired on guitarist Bob Franquiz and drummer Steve Kleisath. About six months after the departure of Carbonell and Dominguez, Franquiz and Berggren left the band. Both Carbonell and Domiguez rejoined, while leaving Kleisath on drums. Carbonell had been called in by the members to help try out new vocalists. However, none of the try-outs worked out, with Carbonell decided to try-out himself, earning the vocalist position, after never having performed before. Strongarm released Advent of a Miracle in 1997, marking the first release on the new Tooth & Nail subsidiary Solid State Records. In 1998, Strongarm decided to disband following the release. Most of the members move on to form Further Seems Forever, with Carbonell even being offered the vocalist position. Carbonell declined due to his inability to sing cleanly. A post on Strongarm's website directs fans to Further Seems Forever, the members' new band. In 2000, the band reunited for Furnace Fest. On the song \\"Trials\\", they had their friend and Shai Hulud guitarist Matt Fox on drums. In 2009, there was an unauthorized tribute show at Cornerstone Festival, which caused some controversy. In July 2010, Blood and Ink Records released Strongarm's, Atonement on vinyl.Pelt, Doug Van. . HM Magazine. Retrieved on July 2, 2010. Original vocalist Jason Berggren was featured on a song, \\"The Call\\", by fellow Christian hardcore band, Venia. In later years, there was talk of a reunion from the Advent lineup. However, after meeting and discussing it, certain members were not fond of returning, while others, such as Carbonell, were hopeful to perform with the band once again.

It is now a National Trust property, open to the public. During World War I it was the Stamford Military Hospital. The stately home was designated a Grade One listed-building on 5 March 1959. It has been owned by the National Trust since the death of the 10th and last Earl of Stamford in 1976. Over 340,000 people visited the house in 2014/15, placing it in the ten most popular National Trust houses.National Trust 2014/15 Annual Report , 71 Dunham Massey was built in the early 17th century by the Earls of Warrington, passing to the Earls of Stamford by inheritance; the family still live in part of the house. There were significant alterations, especially internally, at the start of the 20th century.Jenkins, 79‚Äì80 It has historic formal gardens and a deer park. The park and gardens are listed Grade II* on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. It was formerly in the ancient parish of Bowdon, Cheshire.  Main house  Courtyard William Booth, son of Sir George Booth, 1st Baronet, began the building of the hall in the early 17th century on a moated platform. However, the house remained uncompleted by the time of his death and was only completed after the Civil War in the later 17th century by his son, George Booth, 1st Baron Delamer. Internally, the service rooms such as the kitchen have changed little for over a century, and have been restored to reflect their use then.Jenkins, 79‚Äì80 The mansion's service court dates from . The clock tower is inscribed with that date, suggesting that was when improvements were made to the stables. In the 1730s, John Norris was brought in to redesign the whole mansion by the 2nd Earl of Warrington, with a design of brick fa√ßade accentuated by bays and a stone centerpiece. The house was then acquired by the Grey family of Enville Hall via the marriage of Lady Mary Booth, daughter of the 2nd Earl, who oversaw to the remodeling of the landscape, work which was reputedly undertaken by Lancelot Capability Brown. The house remained occupied by the Grey family until the 7th Earl of Stamford‚Äôs marriage to Elizabeth (Bessie) King Billage at which stage the house and wider estates were abandoned for a time. The Earl at this time condemned the snobs of Cottonopolis (Manchester) because of their disrespectful attitude towards his wife Bessie and vowed never to set foot in Dunham Massey Hall again. He married Catherine Cox in August 1855 and although they spent private time at Dunham Massey Hall they never considered this to be their home. Catherine Cox was the second daughter of Henry and Jemima Cox, their first daughter Tamar gave birth to three illegitimate children and namely Sarah Letitia Cox and the niece of the Countess and who Catherine took under her wing, Sarah Letitia lived with her aunt from at least 1851 when the census was taken. The descendants of Sarah Letitia Cox and the relations of the Countess still occupy Enville Hall today. The double courtyard house is built of Flemish bond brick, stone dressings, and a roof of Westmorland and Welsh slate. The external architecture is relatively plain,Jenkins, 79‚Äì80 and was even more so until the house was modified in 1905‚Äì1908 by Compton Hall, after its reoccupation by William Grey, 9th Earl of Stamford. Until this time, the southern front of the building had 11 three-storey bays; in order to make the building look more 17th-century in style, the third, fourth, eighth, and ninth bays were reduced to two stories with dormers, and a centrepiece of three bays was added, with columns each side of the central bay as well as stone pediments. statue and sundial formerly at the front of house A life- sized statue of an exoticised black man wearing only a skirt of feathers, in a kneeling position and holding a sundial above his head, was previously situated at the front of the house. It is believed to have originally been a personification of Africa, produced by the sculptor Andries Carpenti√®re in after a figure by John van Nost for King William III's privy garden at Hampton Court. In June 2020, after numerous calls were made for the removal of statues in Britain with links to the slave trade in the wake of the killing of George Floyd, the National Trust said that the decision had been made to move the statue.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england- manchester-53011156http://altrincham.today/2020/06/10/news/dunham-massey-says- reviewing-statue-depicting-black-figure-carrying-sundial/ = Stamford Military Hospital = A ward inside Dunham Massey Hall as reconstructed in 2015 During World War One, Penelope Grey, Countess of Stamford, wife of the 10th Earl of Stamford, made the stately home available to the Red Cross as a military hospital, becoming known as the Stamford Military Hospital from April 1917 to January 1919.

During his 64 years at Dunham Massey, he accumulated over 1000 pieces of silver. One sixth of the original plate remains at Dunham Massey, with much of the collection being dispersed by the Countess of Stamford and Warrington (who died in 1905), widow of George Grey, Earl of Stamford and Warrington (died 1883). The 10th Earl, Roger Grey, expended much money and effort in returning family heirlooms originally from Dunham Massey. There is a fine collection of oil paintings and watercolours. The relief wood-carving of the Crucifixion by Grinling Gibbons, which hangs in the Library, is the earliest known work by the 17th-century wood carver. It is on this piece of work he was working when he was discovered by John Evelyn in 1671.

He is the son of Borivoje Kojiƒá, a famous sculptor who worked in Paris. Soon after, the family moved to Paris where Nemanja would spend the first seven years. His first tongue was French. He returned with his mother to Belgrade, where he had hard time adapting to school and softening his French accent. By his own account, seeing the 1985 spot for \\"Electric Avenue\\" by Eddy Grant was a revelation that would point his whole life and career towards reggae. He learned the first guitar riffs from Stanimir Lukiƒá \\"Staƒáa\\". When he was 13, Kojiƒá formed a teenage band Mind Rape with friends, playing death metal. Later on, he joined hardcore punk band Dead Ideas as a guitarist. At the age of 15, he was invited by Jovan Matiƒá to play guitar in his reggae act Del Arno Band. Experiences in reggae, punk and metal would inspire Kojiƒá to create his own fusion of those styles. In 1994 Kojiƒá formed his own band, Eyesburn. The band recorded 5 albums, 1 EP and 1 collaboration dub album (with Ank Steadyspear). They had a European tour in 2004, supporting and performing a song, \\"Moses,\\" with Max Cavalera and his band, Soulfly. Eyesburn have officially disbanded in 2017 over the statement on their official Facebook profile , as well as on interview with Coyote. He immediately started new Hard Rock/Stoner Rock band \\"Remedy\\", stating that he will always continue with his Reggae projects. Coyote himself worked outside Serbia on Dark Ages, another Soulfly record, where he plays the song \\"Innerspirit\\" as guest. At the same time he worked with top Serbian hip hop producer Wikluh Sky and French MC King Kyll, making one album under the name Shappa. In Serbia, as a supporting act, he and his bandmates shared stages with artists like Burning Spear, Dub Syndicate, Lee Scratch Perry, Asian Dub Foundation, etc. Coyote also appeared as a session musician and as a guest playing the trombone, guitars or singing for many Belgrade and ex-YU bands, such as Riblja ƒåorba, Discord, Skarps, Irie FM, Dub Rebellion, Who See?, Kanda, Kod≈æa i Neboj≈°a, Darkwood Dub, Block Out, E-Play, Raspect, etc. His solo album \\"What next?!,\\" garnered much success.

As an early pioneer in the field, he has been called the \\"father of agricultural economics\\" in the United States. Taylor established the first university department dedicated to agricultural economics in the United States in 1909 during his time at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. He also had a brief but very influential career in the United States Department of Agriculture from 1919 to 1925, where he helped reorganize its offices and became head of the new Bureau of Agricultural Economics. Coming from a rural farm community himself, Taylor's foremost goal was always to try to improve the living conditions of farmers. Early life Taylor was born in Iowa on a farm near Stockport. Growing up, he witnessed his father, Tarpley Taylor, expand his farm from about to by buying small farms from early settlers. From an early age he was able to see how proper land and economic management reinforced each other. Additionally, Taylor had been impacted by the depressions of the late 19th century, especially that of the 1890s, and what devastating effects they had on farmers. He entered Drake University to do two years of preparatory work, then went on to Iowa State College, where he received his B.S. in agriculture in 1896, then his M.S. in agriculture in 1898. He then joined the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison to earn his Ph.D. Taylor's original intention upon going to Wisconsin was to take up a career as a statesman in order to represent farmers. However he soon realized that his economics study offered more than he was expecting. Later in his career, he stated that \\"90 per cent of what could be done for the farmers was what they could do for themselves by adjusting production.\\" Inspired by economics professor Richard T. Ely, he left in 1899 to travel through Europe, briefly studying economics at the London School of Economics in Britain and at the University of Halle-Wittenberg and the University of Berlin in Germany. His doctoral dissertation was on \\"The Decline of Land Owners Farmers in England,\\" which had him traveling by bicycle to visit more than a hundred farms. Taylor returned to Wisconsin in 1901 to complete his degree in economics in 1902. =Career at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison= He stayed on at the faculty of the University of Wisconsin until 1919. Room was made for him in the Department of General Economics and the School of Commerce to teach economic geography and economic history. However, as he later noted there was nothing in the budget to provide for his area of interest, agricultural economics. Ely suggested that he simply teach the given courses and slowly develop work on agricultural economics. Upon approaching the dean with the idea, he was told there would be no place for such courses for the next ten years. Nevertheless, by the winter of 1902-03, Ely had arranged for fourteen lectures to be given to agricultural students on the economics of farm management. The dean was impressed by the prepared syllabus and eventually Taylor set up an agricultural economics course for four-year students. He devoted himself by 1903 to founding a Department of Agricultural Economics at the University for both research and teaching. Taylor wrote the first agricultural economics textbook in the United States in 1905. He also adapted a dot map system with William J. Spillman to show historical shifts in agricultural production. By 1909 he was successful in creating the new department, the first devoted to agricultural economics in the United States. By this time he had also broadened the scope of the field to include rural sociology. In 1910 he authored the first Wisconsin Experiment Station bulletin on agricultural economics, on the Methods of Renting Farm Lands in Wisconsin. Taylor also worked with the Wisconsin state government after being spurred on by Charles McCarthy, an advocate of cooperation between the government, farmers, and universities. Wisconsin's new Department of Agriculture was asked to provide leadership in improving the marketing of dairy as the state was seeing a recent shift toward greater milk production. Taylor used this as an opportunity to secure funding from the government to create a new faculty position for marketing. For this, he invited his long-time friend and head of the Department of Economics at Iowa State College Benjamin Horace Hibbard. He joined the department in 1913 to become its second faculty member. Taylor was also a founding member of the Farm Management Association, which later became the American Farm Economic Association. He served as its president in 1920. Government career From 1909 to 1910 he assisted the Bureau of the Census to plan its schedule for the agricultural census, as well as for a special census of plantations. Taylor chose to join the United States Department of Agriculture for the chance at giving a national role to agricultural economics, even though the new position meant a large reduction in salary. He moved to Washington D.C. in 1919 to take charge of the USDA's Office of Farm Management and Farm Economics. Not long after his arrival in Washington, the wartime prices of farm products collapsed, which proved disastrous for a great number of farmers. In 1920, President Harding appointed Henry C. Wallace, who knew Taylor and was himself a great supporter of farmers, as the new Secretary of Agriculture. Taylor soon became Chief of the Bureau of Markets and Crop Estimates, while also being part of a commission to reorganize the offices of the USDA. For him this was a chance to consolidate the economics work of the department which had been scattered through many offices. In 1922, Wallace appointed him chief of the new Bureau of Agricultural Economics, which subsumed the former Office of Farm Management and Bureau of Markets and Crop Estimates (today the Agricultural Research Service and Agricultural Marketing Service). Among Taylor's tasks in the USDA were the expansion of agricultural information services, creating foreign outposts for the USDA to better collect information on world production and consumption, standardizing the grading of exported American crops, especially cotton, and inaugurating the Agricultural Outlook Service. He also brought many talented new people into the USDA. Among them, two of his Ph.D. students he had already sent to work with Spillman, Oscar C. Stine and Oliver Edwin Baker, and Lewis Cecil Gray, who he persuaded to go with him to Washington. One of the major issues at the time was the controversy surrounding the first McNary‚ÄìHaugen Farm Relief Bill in 1924 and other farmer subsidies proposals, however Taylor later stated his own involvement was only indirect. The bill was not supported by the White House but had support from much of the Department of Agriculture. Wallace died unexpectedly in late 1924, and Taylor had lost one of his greatest supporters. President Coolidge appointed William Marion Jardine as the new Secretary of Agriculture in 1925. Although he knew Taylor and they possibly were friends, Coolidge appointed Jardine on the condition that he get rid of Taylor. Jardine asked him to step down and he would try to find him a government position of equivalent rank. Taylor ignored the request and carried on his work, stating that he himself never actively supported the McNary-Haugen Bill or any other such program. Taylor was dismissed from his post officially on August 15, 1925. Despite his short government career, he was still able to make major contributions to the Department of Agriculture, which had become one of the first great economic research organizations in the United States. Disappointed by his termination, he went on to give speeches to farm groups, especially in Iowa, with the main message that Washington was more interested in providing cheap food to urban workers than the welfare of farmers. Taylor wrote of his experience in government in 1926 in a 317-page manuscript called \\"A Farm Economist in Washington, 1919-1925.\\" Although intended to be released as a book to the public, it was never published. Later life Taylor returned to his academic career, briefly rejoining Ely, then going to Northwestern University to work with the Institute for Research in Land Economics until 1928. He then went to New England for three years to serve as Director of the Survey of Rural Vermont. Taylor then left the United States and traveled through Japan, China, Korea, and India as a member of the Commission of Appraisal of the Layman's Foreign Missions Inquiry for one year, in which he reviewed the work done by missionaries on rural problems. He then went to Rome to serve as the United States member of the Permanent Committee of the International Institution of Agriculture between 1933 and 1935. He returned to the United States in 1935 on request from Illinois Governor Frank Lowden to serve as Managing Director of the recently created Farm Foundation in Chicago until 1945, where he focused on the broad problems of rural communities and worked to establish a relationship between researchers in the USDA and state agricultural colleges. He also worked closely with Oscar C. Stine on studying the history and development of agricultural economics. In 1936 he also served as president of the Agricultural History Society, of which he was a life member. In 1945 he was transferred to Washington D.C. to serve as Agricultural Economist for the Farm Foundation. This allowed him to devote himself to writing his book, The Story of Agricultural Economics, with his wife Anne Dewees Taylor, and the foundation's sponsorship. With its completion in 1952, Taylor began a study of land scarcity in highly industrialized nations like England, Germany, and Japan, and how their economies were adapting with the loss of their colonies. He stayed active to the end of his life. Taylor regularly attended the meetings of the International Conference of Agricultural Economists until he was 90, and also worked to complete a 100-year history of the original Taylor farm, Tarplewick, started by his parents in Iowa in 1861. Even before his death he had become known as the \\"father of agricultural economics\\" in the United States. However Taylor himself noted the pioneer work of five of his contemporaries in the field along with him: Andrew Boss, William J. Spillman, and George F. Warren, from a background in agronomy, and Benjamin H. Hibbard and Thomas Nixon Carver, who along with himself were students of Richard T. Ely in general economics. Taylor nonetheless embraced this role as a sort of elder statesman, and accepted many visitors to his home, including many young agricultural economists. He found teaching to be the most rewarding part of his career. Taylor was eventually hospitalized by bone cancer of the leg, a terminal illness, but even then continued to see visitors. He died in April 1969 at the Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington. He was survived by his daughter, Esther E. Taylor.

It is supposed to be the deck authored by Le Club Pythagore (French: \\"The Pythagorean Society\\"), a fictional society from the era involved in occultism, spiritualism and magical research. The artwork on the cards is dark and sardonic, with a tinge of madness about them. People are portrayed as bestial, vain or foolish and demons or beasts are in most of the backgrounds. It helps to create the mood that magic is nothing to be trifled with and that there are dark forces all around ‚Äì and even inside ‚Äì us. Major Arcana The Arcana are not numbered. There are also no suit cards. The eleven Upper Arcana cards are full frame and deal with one view. The next nine (or eleven in the later deck) Lower Arcana cards are split-frame and deal with a depiction of the figure on one side of the diagonal line and a bestial parody on the other. Eve and La Midium are the only female cards in the deck. The 20 Major Arcana are: =Upper Arcana= *Le Grand Livre (\\"The Great Book\\") = XXI. The World. Description: A closed book surrounded by four chubby little demons with bestial features and animal heads. Two open the book's cover and a demon issuant from inside is fighting with a demon perched upon the spine of the book. *La Chance (\\"Luck\\") = O. The Fool. Description: A delirious man has a rabbit-headed demon on his back, holds another rabbit-headed demon by his left foot as it hangs from his neck, and has a severed rabbit-demon head on top of his head. All the rabbit demons have four-leafed clovers in their mouths. *L'Archange (\\"The Archangel\\") = XX. Judgment (\\"The Final Trump\\"). Description: The Archangel Michael casting Lucifer out of heaven. *Le Vicaire (\\"The Vicar\\") = XVI. The Tower (\\"The House of God\\"). Description: A tonsured old man in priest's robes who sits between a lion on his right and a sheep on his left. Wrapped around his body is a two-headed dragon whose heads are fighting with each other. *La Lune Noire (\\"The Dark Moon\\") = XVIII. The Moon. Description: A black moon with a malevolent face is sucking three frightened souls into it. It is surrounded with globs of protoplasm, presumably previous victims. *La Mort (\\"Death\\") = XIII. Death. Description: A robed skeletal figure with a scythe raises it to strike. Behind him stands a serpent-like man in a similar robe (like the bestial depiction of Le Juge) armed with a similar scythe who is preparing to strike him down. *Le Diable (\\"The Devil\\") = XV. The Devil (\\"Lust, Separation\\"). Description: A winged, goat-headed being sits cross- legged with his left fist raised up and his right fist downward. Two winged serpents sit back to back in his lap; their tails loop around The Devil's waist and are presumed either conjoined or issuant from the Devil's groin. *Le Sorcier (\\"The Sorcerer\\") = XII. The Hanged Man (\\"Prudence\\"). Description: A robed man with cat-like features plays with a mouse he holds up over his face in his claws before he swallows it. The inference is that the Sorcerer is the Mouse, not the Cat. *Adam = V. The High Priest, IV. The Emperor Description: The reflection in a mirror of a handsome dark-haired man who is admiring himself; the view is of his reversed right profile. He is the same man depicted in La Chance. The mirror is held by sly-looking little demons similar to those surrounding Le Grand Livre. *Eve = II. The High Priestess, III. The Empress. Description: The reflection in a mirror of a beautiful woman who is admiring herself; the view is of her reversed left profile. She is fair- haired, tan-skinned, and brown-eyed, a reverse of the depiction of Adam. The mirror is held by sly-looking little demons. *La Roue de Fortune (\\"The Wheel of Fortune\\") = X. Fate. Description: A dragon and a winged cat fight on top of a wheel while trying to hold on tight. A pair of eagle-headed men climb up the wheel while confronting each other, standing on the backs of human-faced animals with their outer legs and grasping the wheel with their inner legs. Coins fall from the bottom onto the ground beneath it, where they lie in unnoticed stacks. Eve combines the High Priestess and Empress. Adam combines the Emperor and High Priest. This makes them a hybrid of Upper and Lower arcana. The First Edition deck had different Adam and Eve cards. Adam is an attractive fair-haired man and Eve is a beautiful fair-haired woman. They are depicted with their face in profile on a circular mirror split between light and darkness and bordered with branches. Each one faces towards the darkness and away from the light. Adam faces towards the left-hand side of the card and Eve faces towards the right-hand side of the card; each has their back to the other if the cards are placed back to back. =Lower Arcana= These cards show a split view. There are two edges to each Lower Arcana cards in the deck. One edge shows a normal person and the reversed edge shows a bestial parody of that person. One depiction is shown with an animal on his shoulder (sometimes the bestial version) and the other with a demon on his shoulder (sometimes the human version). Both versions have a beast's head issuant from their subject's groins (with obvious symbolism), with the bestial version usually looking more sinister than the human one. This means that there is twice the chance of drawing a Lesser Arcana card. *L'Alchimiste (\\"The Alchemist\\") = XIX. The Sun. *Le Cabaliste (\\"The Cabalist\\") = XVII. The Star. *Le M√©decin / Hippocrate (\\"The Physician\\") = XIV. Temperance. *Le Juge (\\"The Judge\\") = VIII. Justice. *Le Moine (\\"The Monk\\") = IX.

Well over a hundred research studies have examined the polymorphism.  Association with neuropsychiatric disorders  A number of studies have examined the role of this polymorphism in risk of neuropsychiatric disorders , including schizophrenia and depression. It is generally thought that some variants of the polymorphism lead to memory impairment and susceptibility to neuropsychiatric disorders, and a 2007 meta- analysis of case-control studies found a relationship between the SNP and substance-related disorders, eating disorders, and schizophrenia. Another 2007 meta-analysis could, however, find no association between the SNP and schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Meta-analyses of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease also indicate that the SNP has little or no association with these diseases. Also inconsistencies in association studies with depression have been noted. The reason for these inconsistent results have been suggested to stem from several sources, with one recent review arguing that statistical artefact, sampling bias, population stratification and uncontrolled gene-environment interactions are likely to underscore this effect . These same authors recently published a report which found that transgenic mice engineered to express human BDNF as well as carry the Val66Met permutation are selectively sensitive to the glucocorticoid stress hormone corticosterone (rodent equivalent of cortisol), which in turn primes the fear circuitry and hippocampus-dependent memory function of Met/Met homozygous mice . As hippocampal function is a core component of several psychiatric conditions, and stress is a non-specific but substantial risk factor for affective, anxiety, eating and psychotic disorders, Notaras et al. argue that \\"there is a long-term effect of glucocorticoids in 66Met carriers that potentiates the fear circuitry into adulthood, which may increase susceptibility to trauma, events with negative emotional valence and related psychopathology\\". This interpretation is consistent with a suggested role of BDNF and the Val66Met polymorphism in post-traumatic stress disorder, where it has been shown that 66Met variant perturbs extinction learning in both man and mouse. The Val66Met polymorphism alters vulnerability to stress in mice and humans, which likely contributes to PTSD risk. In treatment response studies val/val homozygotes may respond better than met allele carriers with drug resistant depression treated with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation.  Subject variables in healthy humans  One study has reported that met/met carriers tends to have lower body mass index compared to the two other genotypes. Another study showed that subjects with the val/val genotype had higher mean intelligence. The same study found no association with personality traits as measured with the Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire. Also a Polish 2007 study observed no significant relationship between the polymorphism and personality in healthy females. A German 2005 study could though find an association with personality traits measured with NEO-Five Factor Inventory, with Val/Val subjects scoring higher on anxiety and neuroticism dimensions. Large studies and a meta-analysis inclusive of over 15,000 subjects, however, found no association between the Val66Met and Neuroticism.  Other studies  A study in transgenic mice has found that met/met mice exhibits increased anxiety-related behaviors.

When Tabuchi turned 7, his mother encouraged him to learn how to play the violin using the Suzuki method. Career In the mid-1960s, Tabuchi was a sophomore in college and had heard that Roy Acuff was coming to Osaka, Japan. Tabuchi went to his concert and got to meet Acuff backstage. Acuff's music inspired Tabuchi to pursue country and bluegrass music. When Tabuchi was in college, he formed a band called The Bluegrass Ramblers, which led them to win a national contest in Japan. He decided to travel to the United States with his violin and only $500. After living in San Francisco, Kansas City, and Louisiana, Tabuchi moved to Nashville to reconnect with Acuff, who arranged an appearance for Tabuchi to perform at the Grand Ole Opry. Tabuchi later made numerous appearances on the Grand Ole Opry. =The Shoji Tabuchi Show= Tabuchi arrived in Branson around 1980, after performing successfully for a few years. He built one of Branson's most elaborate theaters, which was completed in 1990, and began hosting his own show. Besides country music, The Shoji Tabuchi Show has incorporated polka, gospel, Cajun, Hawaiian, rap, and rock music. Tabuchi has developed a loyal fan base through his Branson show. He employs about 200 personnel at his elaborate 2,000-seat theater, where he performs two shows daily most of the year.Shoji Tabuchi Show The theater was closed due to a backstage fire in May 2017. It reopened on October 22, 2018.Theater Status The Shoji Tabuchi Show garnered considerable attention when it was featured on the RedLetterMedia web series Best of the Worst. The VHS release of the show's third volume first appeared on the inaugural \\"Wheel of the Worst\\" episode on April 30, 2013, and was finally viewed on the fourth \\"Wheel of the Worst\\" episode, which premiered on RedLetterMedia's website on February 28, 2014. It was voted \\"Best of the Worst\\", meaning it was the most entertaining video of the night.

The epicenter was near the city of Bou'in-Zahra in Qazvin Province, a region of northwestern Iran which is crossed by several major faults that is known for destructive earthquakes. The shock measured 6.5 on the scale, had a maximum Mercalli intensity of VIII (Severe), and was followed by more than 20 aftershocks. At least 261 people were killed and 1,500 more were injured. According to the International Institute of Earthquake Engineering and Seismology (IIEES), the earthquake was felt as far away as the capital city of Tehran, approximately east of the epicenter, although no damage was reported there. Most houses in the region were single-story masonry buildings, and virtually all of these collapsed. The public became angry due to the slow official response to victims who needed supplies. Residents of the town of Avaj resorted to throwing stones at the car of a government minister. Background and tectonics The northeastern part of Iran lies across part of the belt of active continental collision between the Arabian Plate and the Eurasian Plate. Iran is crossed by several major faults, with 90% of them being seismically active and subject to many earthquakes each year; the area around the rupture experiences minor quakes almost daily. The most seismically active parts of this area are the Zagros fold and thrust belt and the Alborz mountain range. Qazvin Province, which is located between these two zones, suffers less earthquakes, but these may be more powerful because stresses have longer to build. The Bou'in-Zahra earthquake was located in an area of active thrust faulting and folding, parallel and south of the southern edge of the Alborz mountain range, and was the 11th rupture in the previous two months in central Iran. A seismic inversion of long-period P and SH body-wave seismograms indicated a rupture on a thrust fault that dips 49 degrees to the southwest and had a centroid depth of roughly . The rupture's mechanism of faulting was reverse. Multiple-event relocation of the main shock and aftershock epicenters and discontinuous surface ruptures recorded after the earthquake are compatible with northeastward movement on a southwest-dipping thrust, although maximum recorded displacements were less than would have been expected from the observed magnitude. This suggests that most of the slip did not actually reach the Earth's surface but caused folding at the surface. A previously unmapped thrust with little surface expression, the Abdareh fault, has been identified from the disruption of earlier drainage systems by the growth of the fold in its hanging wall, and is thought to be responsible for the earthquake. Such structures are known as blind thrusts, and have been responsible for many destructive earthquakes in Iran and elsewhere. The geomorphological effects of this particular fold have been partly obscured by the presence of an earlier Neogene topography. The Qazvin region was hit by an even greater earthquake in 1962, which killed 12,200. In 1990 a rupture killed over 40,000 people, injured 60,000, and left more than 500,000 homeless. Damage and casualties KharƒÅghƒÅn twin towers before the earthquake The earthquake occurred at 02:58 UTC (7:28 a.m. Iran Standard Time), while many of the estimated 60 million Iranians affected were in their homes. Its duration was seven seconds, and the epicenter was near the settlement of Bou'in-Zahra in the Khar river valley, a mountainous farming region about from the provincial capital of Qazvin. The greatest damage was across an area best known for its seedless grape harvesting, a getaway for wealthy residents of Tehran. At least 261 people were killed, 1,500 injured, and 25,000 left homeless. An earlier death toll was reported as 500, but this number was believed to be inflated once it became known that some of the severely injured had been mistaken for dead. Most of the dead were women, children and the elderly, as many of the men were working in local vineyards. Over 20 aftershocks were recorded, with magnitudes up to 5.1 on the moment magnitude scale. At least three of these caused further casualties and damage, most of which were within a radius of the main shock. An estimated 5,000 buildings were damaged beyond repair. In the Qazvin province, 120 buildings were demolished and 50 villages suffered massive damage. In the neighboring Hamadan province, 45 villages were destroyed. A large majority of houses in the region were single-story masonry buildings, and virtually all of these collapsed. As non-engineered structures, these could not withstand seismic forces, with structural failure and collapse resulting from wall-to-wall separation and the lack of structural integrity and of a proper lateral system of resisting. Newer structures built in accordance with the Iranian code of practice for seismic-resistant design fared much better. Damage to the historic Kharaqan tomb towers, which were in a good state of preservation before the event, suggests that the earthquake was possibly one of the most powerful in the region for approximately 900 years. At a station from the epicenter, the maximum horizontal and vertical accelerations were recorded to be roughly 0.5 g and 0.26 g. A bridge collapsed as a result of the disaster. Water and irrigation systems were severely damaged near the epicenter, and water facilities were demolished in nine villages. Many of the main water pipelines in the affected areas were damaged or destroyed, causing inadequacies in water availability and quality. Surface cracks were observed in Ab Darreh and Changureh, the villages that suffered the heaviest damage, being roughly from the epicenter. The relatively low levels of damage in the towns of Avaj or Ab- e-Garm in comparison to Changureh and Ab Darreh suggest a focus of damage to the northwest of the epicenter due to northwest propagation. In Changureh, only two buildings were left standing and over 120 casualties occurred. Ab Darreh also fared poorly; the disaster destroyed the town's only mosque, toppled 40 homes and killed at least 20 people. North of Avaj, in the village of Esmailabad, survivors recovered 38 corpses, a ninth of the total population, while searching for the missing, feared trapped in the ruins. In another village in the vicinity, Aliabad, two shepherds were the only known survivors. In the small village of Kisse-Jin, roughly 80 corpses were recovered following the rupture. Survivors crying and beating their heads and faces over loved ones were a common sight on Iranian state television. The cost of the damage was estimated at US$91 million. The quake was felt across a wide area, including the provinces of Qazvin, Gilan, Kurdistan, Zanjan, and Hamedan. Of all these, Qazvin was the most heavily damaged, with an unnamed Qazvin official reporting that 177 had died in the province. It was also felt in the capital of Tehran, roughly east of the epicenter, although no serious damage was reported. However, Iranian journalist Borzou Daragahi reported that in Tehran he saw buildings sway and glass objects shatter. Landslides The Bou'in-Zahra earthquake triggered 59 landslides over an area of about . Landslides formed due to the quake included 47 falls and topples, nine slides, and three lateral spreads. The largest of these slides was a rockslide, 150 √ó 100 m (490 √ó 330 ft), which occurred southeast of Changureh. Landslides triggered by the quake occurred more often in the geologic areas most susceptible to damage, where there were many landslides before. Relief efforts and aftermath The Red Crescent Society sent relief workers, detection dogs, 100 tons of food, 1,000 tents, 2,500 blankets, and mobile kitchens to the earthquake-stricken area. In addition, the Iranian army supplied soldiers, machinery and water trucks. To prevent the spread of disease, villages were sprayed with disinfectants and their inhabitants were given tetanus shots, among other measures. After Iranian officials launched an appeal for assistance, the United Nations Development Programme supplied $50,000. The United Nations' Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) mobilised a United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC) team, deploying five members. Pope John Paul II prayed for the earthquake victims and asked for a \\"generous\\" response. United States President George W. Bush offered aid to Iran, which he had previously called part of an \\"axis of evil\\". According to him, \\"human suffering knows no political boundaries\\" and he stood \\"ready to assist the people of Iran as needed and as desired\\". However, the Iranian government refused his help, though it called for the help of non-governmental agencies. According to Hossein Rahnema, head of the Red Crescent in Changureh, the society \\"levelled an area to put up tents but most people wanted to stay next to their houses to look after their property\\". Survivors instead lit small fires amongst the rubble to protect against freezing temperatures. The Iranian President at the time, Mohammad Khatami, declared three days of mourning and visited earthquake-stricken areas on June 25. Hospitals struggled to cope with the surplus of patients, discharging non-critical ones from their wards. The Associated Press stated that 20 funerals were held on June 23, 2002 at a cemetery overlooking the village of Abdareh. A bank account was started to handle public donations for the families of the dead. Often armed with no more than shovels and spades, soldiers and civilians dug for bodies in the rubble. Other than this, rescue workers were faced with a number of obstacles, including the temperatures of the villages damaged. They were warm during the day, although the villages grew colder at night, making rescue work harder and threatening the health of the homeless and anyone alive and trapped under the debris. Many civilians were discouraged from helping due to fear of aftershocks. According to Gary Oshea of International Rescue, the volunteers did not have enough technical equipment, and the religious leaders seemed unwilling to contribute much. Official rescue work ended on June 24, 2002, when rescue workers said there were no more survivors. =Public reaction= Of the roughly 80 villages that suffered heavy damage, the Iranian government claimed that relief work was mostly complete. Residents of Changureh, however, complained that tents, food, and medicine had not reached them, after waiting in near-freezing temperatures. A man from Avaj stated that only locals helped uncover the body of his child. In protest at Iran's slow response to the tragedy, some 300 people blocked the main road through Avaj. On June 23, \\"dozens\\" of Avaj residents threw stones at Interior Minister Abdolvahed Mousavi-Lari's car in anger at the government's delay in providing relief. They also claimed that the death toll was higher than official reports said it was. =Reconstruction= Electricity was restored to affected areas by June 25. On November 9, 2002, the World Bank granted $225 million towards the reconstruction and economic rehabilitation of the area devastated by the quake. Reconstruction of housing and infrastructure by provincial authorities was interrupted for almost four months (November 2002 ‚Äì February 2003) due to harsh weather conditions. In August 2003, the reconstruction was completed in all villages affected by the earthquake.

In some jurisdictions, such courts may be referred to as Orphans' Courts, or courts of ordinary. In some jurisdictions probate court functions are performed by a chancery court or another court of equity, or as a part or division of another court. Probate courts administer proper distribution of the assets of a decedent (one who has died), adjudicates the validity of wills, enforces the provisions of a valid will (by issuing the grant of probate), prevents malfeasance by executors and administrators of estates, and provides for the equitable distribution of the assets of persons who die intestate (without a valid will), such as by granting a grant of administration giving judicial approval to the personal representative to administer matters of the estate. In contested matters, the probate court examines the authenticity of a will and decides who is to receive the deceased person's property. In a case of an intestacy, the court determines who is to receive the deceased's property under the law of its jurisdiction. The probate court will then oversee the process of distributing the deceased's assets to the proper beneficiaries. A probate court can be petitioned by interested parties in an estate, such as when a beneficiary feels that an estate is being mishandled. The court has the authority to compel an executor to give an account of their actions. In some jurisdictions (e.g. Texas) probate courts also handle other matters, such as guardianships, trusts, and mental health issues (including the authority to order involuntary commitment to psychiatric facilities and involuntary administering psychiatric medication).  Orphans' Court  An Orphans' Court was an organization established in the Chesapeake Bay American colonies during colonization. The major goal of the organization was to protect orphaned children and their right to their deceased family member's estate from claims and against abuses by stepparents and others. Today, at least in Maryland and Pennsylvania, probate courts are still called Orphans' Courts, for historical reasons, hearing matters involving wills of deceased estates which are contested and supervising estates which are probated judicially.Maryland Courts, About the Orphans' Court  Register of Probate  A Register of Probate is an elected position in some jurisdictions in the United States, such as New Hampshire,http://probatecourt.org/ProbateCourt.htm Massachusetts,http://wgbhnews.org/post/look-bottom-ballot-register-probate and Mainehttp://www.washingtoncountymaine.com/probate/duties.html (part of Massachusetts before 1820). Register of Wills is an elected position in jurisdictions such as Maryland.

He was an auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Southwark, and he holds the titular see of Beverley. Early life John Franklin Meldon Hine was born in Tunbridge Wells, part of the Southwark Archdiocese, on 26 July 1938. He is the son of Lieutenant Commander Jack F. W. Hine (RN) and Moira E. Hine. He was educated by the Jesuits at Stonyhurst College and the Xaverian Brothers at Mayfield College. After studying at the Venerable English College, Rome, Hine was ordained as a Catholic priest, on 28 October 1962 for the Archdiocese of Southwark. He served as Vicar General and Chancellor of the Archdiocese before his elevation to the episcopate, and was a Canon of the Cathedral of St George, Southwark and a Monsignor. Episcopal career In 2001, the then Pope John Paul II, on the recommendation of the Apostolic Nuncio and the then Archbishop of Southwark, Michael Bowen, appointed Father Hine as auxiliary bishop for Southwark. He was consecrated by Archbishop Bowen on 27 February 2001, with Bishops Christopher Budd and Crispian Hollis as co consecrators, and assigned the titular see of Beverley. Archbishop Bowen gave him oversight of the Kent Pastoral Area of the Archdiocese, which comprises the deaneries of Canterbury, Chatham, Dover, Gravesend, Maidstone, Thanet and Bishop Hine's home area of Tunbridge Wells. Hine was the most senior of the three auxiliaries in Southwark, having been appointed five years before Bishops Hendricks & Lynch. As such, he substituted for the Archbishop at a number of events, such as the 2008 Chrism Mass, during Archbishop Kevin McDonald's convalescence from a heart bypass operation. He was elected as Diocesan Administrator following Archbishop McDonald's resignation, serving from December 2009 to June 2010, when Archbishop Peter Smith was installed as archbishop. In accordance with Canon Law upon reaching the age of 75, he submitted his resignation from office to Pope Francis. In January 2014 he relinquished his responsibilities for the Kent area of the Diocese of Southwark, and was appointed parish priest of St Andrew's, Tenterden, Kent.

It was fought near Waters Creek in Newport News, Virginia between a group of local Patriot militia and British Army troops. Background A historical sign with information about the skirmish The state of Virginia had not been the scene of significant military activity for most of the American Revolutionary War. This began to change with the arrival in October 1780 of 2,500 British Army troops under Brigadier General Alexander Leslie. These troops established a fortified position at Portsmouth, and began raiding the area for supplies. However, they were ordered to abandon the post by Lieutenant General Charles, Earl Cornwallis in November. In January 1781 another 1,600 troops, this time under the command of the traitor Benedict Arnold, arrived in Virginia. After making a lightning raid on the state capital, Richmond, Arnold and his men settled into winter quarters at Portsmouth.Randall, pp. 581-583 Arnold's presence at Portsmouth was monitored by local Patriot militia, which turned out to respond to raiding and supply expeditions that he sent out. Early on March 8, Arnold sent about 300 men on a raiding expedition to the Newport News area. They were led by Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Dundas, leader of the regiment known as the Royal Edinburgh Volunteers, and included a company of men from John Graves Simcoe's Queen's Rangers.Maxwell, p. 28Randall, p. 581 When the militia were alerted to Dundas' expedition, Colonel Francis Mallory, a resident of Hampton, organized the opposition. Mallory had recently been released from a brief imprisonment on board a Royal Navy ship as part of a prisoner exchange, and had been warned against taking up arms again. Intelligence gained during this time led him to conclusions about the likely route of the expedition, so he tried to set up an ambush at a place called Tompkins' Bridge, crossing the creek between Hampton and York County.Maxwell, pp. 25-26 Skirmish The militiamen divided their forces with the cavalry leading the charge from the front while the infantry fired from the flank. Colonel Mallory himself was killed in the attack, after being wounded by shot, saber and bayonet.Quarstein, p. 23 The militiamen were able to hold off the British forces, forcing them to retreat to Newport News point and eventually their boats. While retreating, Captain Brown was injured and left behind.Rouse, p. 11 NotesReferences  * Waters Creek Waters Creek, Skirmish at Waters Creek, Skirmish at Category:1781 in the United States Category:Conflicts in 1781 Category:History of Newport News, Virginia Category:1781 in Virginia ","title":"Skirmish at Waters Creek"},{"id":"18012901","text":"The Arthur Ross Book Award is a politics-related literary award.

Plot  3D graphics, unusual for the console.alt=From the unseen protagonist's point of view, his handgun is pointed at an enemy soldier standing about thirty feet away. He stands in a pool of water while the enemy is on a slightly elevated stone floor. The outdoor area is bordered by a wooden fence, over which trees and the overcast sky are visible. Features such as ammunition remaining, health, and lives adorn the screen, all in a stylized science fiction-esque font. The plot of Ice Nine is similar to the film The Recruit on which it was previously based. The player takes control of the recruit Tom Carter on a mission to stop an evil plot to steal the diabolical computer virus \\"Ice Nine\\". Over the course of the game, Carter unravels a conspiracy within the CIA.  Reception  Ice Nine was met with lukewarm reviews. It was praised for its above-average graphics and music, but criticized for its boring level design in comparison with earlier shooters such as Ecks vs. Sever.

A small part of the former abbey church remains in use as a chapel, the Nonneseter kapell (\\"Nonneseter Chapel\\"). History Prospect over Bergen made in 1740 shows Lungeg√•rden, built on the foundations of Nonneseter Abbey Nonneseter Abbey is first recorded by name in 1262, but was certainly founded many years earlier, possibly in about 1150.Its foundation may have been connected with that of Lyse Abbey, Os, in 1146 by Sigurd, Bishop of Bergen It was dedicated to the Virgin Mary. The nuns apparently belonged to the Cistercian Order, although this is not confirmed until as late as 1494. In 1507 the nuns were ejected for immoral and unseemly behaviour and the buildings were transferred to the Hospital Brothers of St. Anthony. The nunnery underwent secularisation in 1528, and the premises were converted into a private fortified residence, under the name of Lungeg√•rden, by the new proprietor, Vincens Lunge. A hospital run by the nuns at Nonneseter Abbey was first documented in 1411. It seems probable that this was the forerunner of St. J√∏rgen's Hospital (Sankt J√∏rgens Hospital) which was later associated with the research and treatment of leprosy by Daniel Cornelius Danielssen. Site and buildings The abbey was located on a promontory on the north bank of the Lillestr√∏mmen, a stream which once connected two bodies of water, Store Lungeg√•rdsvannet and Lille Lungeg√•rdsvannet, approximately in the area of the present Kaigaten. The surviving buildings were mostly destroyed by a fire in 1891, and of the monastic buildings there remains nothing to be seen. Of the abbey church there survived the base of the west tower and the Nonneseter Chapel, originally the south chapel off the choir, which after the fire were acquired in 1891 by the Society for the Preservation of Ancient Norwegian Monuments. The single storey remaining of the west tower, the T√•rnfoten (\\"tower foot\\"), measures 8.6 metres square. It was originally clad with dressed stone. In the west wall is a portal with a round arch, and in the east wall another, which would have connected to the body of the church. It is now used as a memorial chapel to the fallen of World War II. The Romanesque tower foot is more old-fashioned in style than the body of the main church apparently was, indicating the possibility that it could have belonged to an older structure predating the arrival of the Cistercians with their characteristic building style. The church lay to the east of the tower. The original building was quite small, but seems to have been extended eastwards in the later 13th century with a new choir and choir chapels; it had a single aisle. The graveyard was to the north of the church, and the monastic buildings to the south, but there are too few remains of them to establish the exact layout. The site was archaeologically excavated in 1872 and again in 1892. Nonneseteren station on the Bergen Light Rail Nonneseter Chapel The Nonneseter Chapel (Nonneseter kapell) at Kaigaten 3 is believed to have been one of the choir chapels. It measures about 8 metres by 7 metres, and contains a vaulted ceiling and Gothic arched windows. It dates from around 1250, which seems to be when the church was extended. Between 1951 and 1989 it was used as a church for deaf persons. It is now used for various purposes, including as a concert hall. It is situated adjacent to the Nonneseteren station of the Bergen Light Rail and near the Bergen Public Library.

She won five Olympic medals in 1964, 1968 and 1972 and five European Championships medals in 1966 and 1970. Her first Olympic medal, the gold in 200 m breaststroke in 1964, was the first Olympic gold in swimming for the Soviet Union. From 1964 to 1966, she set five world records: four in 200 m and one in 100 m breaststroke events. Between 1963 and 1972, she won 15 national titles and set 27 national records. Biography Galina was born in Sevastopol, in the Russian SFSR of the Soviet Union. She married twice and therefore changed her last name first to Stepanova () and then to Ivannikova (). Her father, Nikolai Nikolayevich (1913‚Äì1991) was a submarine captain. Her mother, Sofia Petrovna (1922‚Äì1987) was a nurse and took part in World War II. Galina started swimming in a club in 1959 and until 1966 competed for SKF Sevastopol. By the time of her first Olympics in 1964, she had won several national and international competitions and set national and world records in the 200 m breaststroke. (Her favorite discipline was 100 m breaststroke, but it became an Olympic event only in 1968.) However, she underwent surgery for appendicitis in July, just before the Games, and was not in her top form. She also had a strong rival, Svetlana Babanina, who set a world record in the 100 m breaststroke before the 1964 Olympics. Nevertheless, Prozumenshchikova won the 200 m event, setting a new Olympic record and winning the first Soviet Olympic gold in swimming. Babanina finished third. In 1966, Prozumenshchikova enrolled in the faculty of journalism of the Moscow State University (MSU) and moved to Moscow. That year, she set her final and fastest record for the 200 m breaststroke at 2:40.8‚Äînearly seven full seconds lower than her first record of 2:47.7 in 1964‚Äîwinning a gold medal in the event at the 1966 European Aquatics Championships, as well as taking silver in medley. Two years later, at the 1968 Summer Olympics, she came within one-tenth of a second of taking gold in the 100 m breaststroke. She settled for silver in the 100 m event and bronze in the 200 m breaststroke.They Ruled the Pool: The 100 Greatest Swimmers in History (2013) by John Lohn, pp. 118 In 1969, Prozumenshchikova gave birth to a daughter, Irina, and was on the verge of retiring. However, she returned to competition in 1970, winning gold in the 100 m and 200 m breaststroke and another medley silver at the European Aquatics Championships that year. She swam for the Soviet Union in the 1972 Summer Olympics, repeating her 1968 performances in both the 100 m and 200 m to add two more Olympic medals to her tally, and retired the following year. Prozumenshchikova graduated from MSU in 1976 and was writing sports columns for the major newspaper Izvestia. However, she soon left journalism, and between 1976 and 1980 worked as a sports functionary, and after 1980 as a swimming coach for children at CSKA. Along the way, in the 1970s, she remarried to economist Yuri Ivanovich Ivannikov (born 1950) and had a son, Grigory Yurievich, in 1979. In 1991, she competed in swimming again and set at least 35 national records in the \\"masters\\" category. Prozumenshchikova died aged 66 in Moscow on 19 July 2015 after a long illness, according to the Russian Swimming Federation. Her body was cremated. Awards and honors Prozumenshchikova c. 1972 In 2013, two years before her death, Prozumenshchikova was recognized as one of the \\"100 Greatest Swimmers in History\\" in a book by swim journalist John Lohn. She ranked at number 60 in the book, which highlighted her Olympic and European medals and prowess in setting new world records.

The ballet was created for Mikhail Baryshnikov and premiered on March 3, 1994, at the New York State Theater. Production Jerome Robbins had earlier attempted to choreograph Bach's Cello Suites with dancers Victor Castelli and Peter Boal, although the project was abandoned. He used the music for A Suite of Dances with Mikhail Baryshnikov, who was in his 40s, as the sole dancer instead. As Baryshnikov was touring and Robbins was staging his works in Paris and St. Petersburg, A Suite of Dances was made over the course of two years, and according to Robbins, most of the choreography was made without Baryshnikov's presence, before the ballet, a 16-minutes-long solo, premiered at a performance of the White Oak Dance Project, Baryshnikov's company, with Wendy Sutter on the cello. =Music= The ballet uses the following music from Bach's Cello Suites: *Prelude from Suite No. 1 in G major, BWV 1007 *Sarabande from Suite No. 5 in C minor, BWV 1011 *Gigue from Suite No. 1 in G major, BWV 1007 *Prelude from Suite No. 6 in D major, BWV 1012 Revivals In May 1994, at a New York City Ballet performance, Baryshnikov performed A Suite of Dances as a guest artist, with Sutter also returning. The ballet then entered Paris Opera Ballet's repertory, and New York City Ballet's members danced it for the first time in 1997. In subsequent revivals, the ballet is usually danced by an experienced dancer. In March 1999, eight months after Robbins died, Nicolas Le Riche danced A Suite of Dances at a Robbins tribute gala organized by the Paris Opera Ballet. In 2008, at New York City Ballet's Jerome Robbins Celebration program, Le Riche reprised the role. The ballet has also been performed at Carlos Acosta's solo program in 2009 and the Vail Dance Festival in 2018, by American Ballet Theatre's Herman Cornejo.

The planet was discovered by the radial velocity method, using the European Southern Observatory's HARPS apparatus, in June 2008. It is the second smallest of the planets orbiting the star, after HD 40307 e. The planet is of interest as this star has relatively low metallicity, supporting a hypothesis that different metallicities in protostars determine what kind of planets they will form. Discovery As with many other extrasolar planets, HD 40307 b was discovered by measuring variations in the radial velocity of the star it orbits. These measurements were made by the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) spectrograph at the Chile-based La Silla Observatory. The discovery was announced at the astrophysics conference that took place in Nantes, France between 16 and 18 June 2008. HD 40307 b was one of three found here at the time. Orbit and mass HD 40307 b is the second lightest planet discovered in the system, with at least 4.2 times the mass of the Earth. The planet orbits the star HD 40307 every 4.3 Earth days, corresponding of its location at approximately 0.047 astronomical units from the star. The eccentricity of the planet's orbit was found to not differ significantly from zero, meaning that there is insufficient data to distinguish the orbit from an entirely circular one. The star around which HD 40307 b orbits has a low metallicity, compared to other planet-bearing stars. This supports a hypothesis concerning the possibility that the metallicity of stars during their births may determine whether a protostar's accretion disk forms gas giants or terrestrial planets. The Arizonan astronomer Rory Barnes's mathematical model, in 2009, found that \\"Planet b‚Äôs orbit must be more than 15‚ó¶ from face-on\\"; however it cannot be much more. Characteristics HD 40307 b does not transit and has not been imaged. More specific characteristics, such as its radius, composition, and possible surface temperature cannot be determined.Characterizing Extrasolar Planets, Timothy M. Brown, chapter 3, Extrasolar Planets: XVI Canary Islands Winter School of Astrophysics, edited by Hans Deeg, Juan Antonio Belmonte, and Antonio Aparicio, Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2007, . With a lower mass bound of 4.2 times the mass of the Earth, HD 40307 b is presumably too small to be a jovian planet. This concept was challenged in a 2009 study, which stated that if HD 40307 b is terrestrial, the planet would be highly unstable and would be affected by tidal heating in a manner greater than Io, a volcanic satellite of planet Jupiter; restrictions that seem to bind terrestrial planets, however, do not restrict ice giant planets like Neptune or Uranus. As strong tidal forces often result in the destruction of larger natural satellites in planets orbiting close to a star, it is unlikely that HD 40307 b hosts any satellites. HD 40307 b, c, and d are presumed to have migrated into their present orbits.

The planet was discovered by the radial velocity method, using the HARPS apparatus, in June 2008. Of the six proposed planets in the HD 40307 star system, it is the third-largest, and has the second-closest orbit from the star. The planet is of interest as this star has relatively low metallicity, supporting a hypothesis that different metallicities in protostars determine what kind of planets they will form. Discovery Like the other two exoplanets, HD 40307 b and HD 40307 d, orbiting the star HD 40307, HD 40307 c was discovered by measuring variations in the radial velocity of HD 40307 caused by the star's orbit around the center of mass of the planetary system. These measurements were made by the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher spectrograph apparatus (HARPS) at the La Silla Observatory in Chile's Atacama Desert. The discovery of planets in the HD 40307 system was announced in an astrophysics convention that took place in Nantes, France in mid-June 2008. Orbit and mass HD 40307 c is the third-most massive planet in the system, with a lower mass bound 6.8 times the mass of the Earth. The planet orbits HD 40307 at about 0.08 astronomical units (AU), as compared to the Earth's distance from the Sun at 1 AU; as a result, one year on the planet constitutes approximately 9.6 Earth days. Analysis of the radial velocity data used to detect the planet does not yield a statistically significant deviation from a circular orbit. The star around which the planet HD 40307 orbits has a low metallicity, unusual when compared to other planet-bearing stars. This supports a hypothesis concerning the possibility that the metallicity of stars during their births may determine whether a protostar's accretion disk forms gas giants or terrestrial planets. Characteristics HD 40307 c has not been observed directly and likely does not transit. More specific characteristics (such as surface temperature, composition and radius) cannot be determined.Characterizing Extrasolar Planets, Timothy M. Brown, chapter 3, Extrasolar Planets: XVI Canary Islands Winter School of Astrophysics, edited by Hans Deeg, Juan Antonio Belmonte, and Antonio Aparicio, Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2007, . HD 40307 c has a small mass of at least 6.9 times Earth's, so it was first assumed terrestrial. Later in 2009 a study stated that if HD 40307 c is terrestrial, tidal heating would destabilise it, in a manner greater than this process crushes the Jovian moon Io. Such restrictions as bind terrestrial planets would not restrict ice giant planets like Neptune or Uranus. HD 40307 c might be a sub-Neptune. Since the same tides are predicted to result in the destruction of larger natural satellites of planets located close to their parent star, it is unlikely that HD 40307 c hosts any satellites.
