The brand is named for Phileas Fogg, the protagonist of Jules Verne's Around the World in Eighty Days, and the products are made in Consett, County Durham. When the Phileas Fogg company was sold in the 1990s, its products were rebranded but poorly received, leading to a decline in popularity. The brand was relaunched in 2009. Early years The Phileas Fogg snack range was launched in 1982 by Roger McKechnie, Keith Gill, Ray McGhee and John Pike, who invested £67,000 of their own money. The aim was to create a snack aimed at adults and branded with a recognisable character. The range included different flavours \\"from around the world\\" such as miniature garlic breads and tortilla chips. Decline in the 1990s Between the late 1980s and early 1990s, Phileas Fogg Snacks achieved a turnover of more than £30 million. It was subsequently purchased for £24 million by United Biscuits. The four founders left after the sale while United Biscuits made significant changes to the packaging and identity, precipitating a decline in popularity. 2009 relaunch United Biscuits relaunched the brand in 2009 after research showed a high number of British consumers were still aware of it. As of 2016 the brand is still sold but is now owned by KP Snacks and consists of an entirely different product range.

The iHeartMedia, Inc. outlet is licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to broadcast at 104.7 MHz with an ERP of 90 kW. The station goes by the name 104.7 WNOK and its current slogan is \\"All The Hits.\\" Its studios are in Columbia (west of the Congaree River) and the transmitter is northeast of Columbia in unincorporated Richland County. The station receives exceptional interference from WKQC in Charlotte. The Chester and Lancaster areas are affected the most with interference from both stations. History WNOK-FM signed on the air July 15, 1959, simulcasting much of WNOK's programming which consisted of Pop Standards. During the 1960s, WNOK-FM broke off simulcasting when WNOK went Top 40 and went to the Beautiful Music format. Both stations were sister stations of WNOK-TV/67. In the early 1960s, WNOK-FM broadcast commercial background music on an SCA subcarrier channel with a subcarrier frequency of 23 kHz. This prevented the station from broadcasting stereo because the SCA subchannel occupied part of the frequency band for a stereo signal. In November 1963, WNOK-FM interrupted its background music service to announce that President John Kennedy had been shot in Dallas, Texas. The announcement was heard in department stores and offices throughout the Columbia area. Beginning in the mid-1970s, the station gradually became more contemporary with something of an adult contemporary format. The station went full blown top 40 in December 1976 as \\"Stereo 105\\" and was largely automated. This move proved to be a wise decision as the station enjoyed huge ratings for the remainder of the 1970s and into the 1980s. By 1980, the automation was done away with, replaced with a live airstaff and the station's name became simply \\"105 WNOK\\". By early 1984, the station became \\"104.7 WNOK\\", the first station in Columbia to adopt their actual frequency as part of their name. 104.7 WNOK logo from 2004 to December 9, 2014.

Gibbs is home to the Pinellas County Center for the Arts (PCCA), Business, Economics, and Technology Academy (BETA) and their television production in Communication Arts. The school is named for Jonathan Clarkson Gibbs, a black man who was Superintendent of Public Instruction and Secretary of State in Florida during the Reconstruction era. Gibbs' current principal is Reuben Hepburn.  History  Before Gibbs opened in 1927, Pinellas County had no school for blacks past 6th grade. Families wishing for high school education had to enroll in private, mostly church-run black schools. Gibbs became the county's first public secondary school for blacks, occupying an eight-classroom building that cost $49,490 to build. Proms were held at the Manhattan Casino. In 1966, Gibbs won the black state high school basketball championship. For the 1966-1967 school year, Gibbs became the first black school to join the FHSAA and compete against white schools. In their first year (1967), Gibbs won the basketball state championship. In 1970, public schools in Florida were integrated, and whites began attending Gibbs. Gibbs, however, was still primarily black. To assist their integration goals, the district approved the creation of a magnet program at Gibbs, the Pinellas County Center for the Arts, that would instruct those with artistic gifts. In 2004, Gibbs High School was included in the federal grant received by Pinellas County Schools for the establishment of small learning communities (SLCs). Today, the high school is host to smaller learning communities that have curriculum pathways in Communication Arts, Travel & Tourism, Global Studies and a freshmen Renaissance program. The Pinellas County Center for the Arts program offers high-class and one-on-one training with students in varied art fields. The fields include literary theatre, performance theatre, musical theatre, technical theatre, visual arts, dance, instrumental music, and vocal music. It now also has a new campus that opened to the students in the 2005-2006 school year. In 2006, however, the school was reported to be plagued with rampant violence and defiance fueled by the racial divide in the student population.Tobin, Thomas. Turmoil in class, and cry for help, St. Petersburg Times, December 22, 2006.

William Edwardes, 2nd Baron Kensington (24 April 1777 – 10 August 1852), styled The Honourable William Edwardes until 1801, was a British peer and Member of Parliament. He was the instigator of the infamous Kensington Canal. Kensington was the son of William Edwardes, 1st Baron Kensington, who represented Haverfordwest in the House of Commons for over 50 years, and Elizabeth Warren. He succeeded his father as second Baron Kensington in 1801 but as this was an Irish peerage it did not entitle him to an automatic seat in the House of Lords. He was instead elected to succeed his father as Member of Parliament for Haverfordwest in 1802, a seat he held until 1818. Haverfordwest was considered a pocket borough of the Picton Castle estate and both Kensington and his father held the seat as part of an arrangement with Lord Milford, the owner of the estate and Lord Lieutenant of Pembrokeshire. He belonged to the Whig Party. Lord Kensington married Dorothy Patricia Thomas, daughter of Richard Thomas, in 1797; they had six sons and two daughters. He died in August 1852, aged 75, and Edwardes Square, London W8 is named in his honour. He was succeeded in the barony by his son William. Another son, George Warren Edwardes (1802-1879), became Governor of Labuan. In 1831 he was a prominent supporter of the Reform Bill. References *Kidd, Charles, Williamson, David (editors).

They are commonly used for surveillance but unlike analog closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras, they require no local recording device, only a local area network. Most IP cameras are webcams, but the term IP camera or netcam usually applies only to those that can be directly accessed over a network connection, usually used for surveillance. Some IP cameras require support of a central network video recorder (NVR) to handle the recording, video and alarm management. Others are able to operate in a decentralized manner with no NVR needed, as the camera is able to record directly to any local or remote storage media. The first centralized IP camera was Axis Neteye 200, released in 1996 by Axis Communications.  History  The first centralized IP camera, the Axis Neteye 200, was released in 1996 by Axis Communications and was developed by the team of Martin Gren and Carl-Axel Alm. Though promoted based on its direct accessibility from anywhere with an internet connection, the camera couldn't stream real-time motion video. It was limited to a snapshot image each time the camera was accessed. At the time of launch, it was considered incapable of operating as a motion camera due to what was at the time, \\"enormous\\" bandwidth requirements. Thus it was aimed primarily at the tourism industry. The Axis Neteye 200 was not intended to replace traditional analogue CCTV systems, given that its capability was limited to just one frame per second in Common Intermediate Format (CIF), or one every 17 seconds in 4CIF resolution, with a maximum resolution quality of 0.1MP (352x288). Axis used a custom proprietary web server named OSYS, yet by the summer of 1998, it had started porting the camera software to Linux. Axis also released documentation for its low-level application programming interface (API) called VAPIX, which builds on the open standards of HTTP and real time streaming protocol (RTSP). This open architecture was intended to encourage third-party software manufacturers to develop compatible management and recording software. The first decentralized IP camera was released in 1999 by Mobotix. The camera's Linux system contained video, alarm, and recording management functions. In 2005, the first IP camera with onboard video content analytics (VCA) was released by Intellio. This camera was able to detect a number of different events, such as if an object was stolen, a human crossed a line, a human entered a predefined zone, or if a car moved in the wrong direction.  Standards  Previous generations of analog CCTV cameras use established broadcast television formats (e.g. CIF, NTSC, PAL, and SECAM). Since 2000, there has been a shift in the consumer TV business towards high-definition (HD) resolutions (e.g. 1080P (Full-HD), 4K resolution (Ultra-HD) and 16:9 widescreen format). IP cameras may differ from one another in resolution, features, video encoding schemes, available network protocols, and the API for video management software. IP cameras are available at resolutions from 0.3 (VGA resolution) to 29 megapixels. To address IP video surveillance standardization issues, two industry groups formed in 2008: the Open Network Video Interface Forum (ONVIF) and the Physical Security Interoperability Alliance (PSIA). PSIA was founded by 20 member companies including Honeywell, GE Security, and Cisco. ONVIF was founded by Axis Communications, Bosch and Sony. Each group now has numerous additional members, thus; cameras and recording hardware that operate under the same standard can work with each other.  Wi-Fi home camera  Many consumer-level IP cameras used for home security send a live video stream to a companion app on the user’s phone. IP cameras in the home generally connect to the internet through Wi-Fi, Broadband, or Ethernet cable. IP cameras used to be more common in small businesses than in homes, but that is no longer the case. A 2016 survey of 2,000 Americans revealed 20% of them owned home security cameras. This crossover of IP cameras to home use is partly due to the device’s self- installation. IP cameras don’t require professional installation, saving time for home and business owners. On the other hand, large businesses and commercial spaces, like malls, require high-resolution videos (i.e 4K), many cameras, and professional applications to accommodate the installation and management of the cameras. One of the most popular abilities that Wi-Fi home security cameras have is to view their camera footage via a mobile app or other application software. Many cameras offer features such as a wide-angle lens (around 140 degrees, or pan/tilt up to 350 degrees horizontal, 90 degrees vertical), low-light or night vision, and motion detection. When an event occurs, such as detected motion, users can receive alarms and notifications via an app. Video clips can be stored in a local device such as a micro-SD or through a cloud service. The market size of home security systems reached $4.8 billion dollars in 2018. It had a compound annual growth rate of 22.4% between 2011 and 2018. People in countries that suffer from high crime rates, particularly robbery and theft, are keen to adopt home security cameras. In addition, two countries, the US and China, have a high implementation rate of residential security cameras. Major key players in the home security market are Nest (owned by Google, US), Ring (owned by Amazon, US), Arlo (owned by Netgear, US), and SimpliSafe (US). Hikvision Digital Technology (Ltd) and Leshi Video Tech (China) are the largest IP camera manufacturers. As for the alarm security industry, key players are ADT Inc., Security Services (US), Vivint Inc, and Frontpoint Security Solutions. = IP camera types = Source: Indoor cameras are widely used both residentially and commercially. Depending on their functionality, they're classified as a fixed camera or a pan–tilt–zoom camera (PTZ camera). Fixed cameras are generally used to monitor a set of areas, whereas a PTZ camera can be used to either track motion or manually adjust the monitoring area. Outdoor wired cameras, also known as AC powered cameras, are placed in outdoor environments. They are designed to survive weather conditions, such as heat, cold, and rain, and are generally capable of capturing video in low light conditions. They are often rated IP65/IP67 standards to withstand the outdoor environment. Wired (AC Powered) or Wired free cameras for homes are IP cameras that have their own independent power source, such as a Solar panel or Battery. = Cloud and local storage = Source: Some camera manufacturers offer cloud subscriptions where users may remotely view and download recent video clips by paying recurring subscription fees. Cloud subscription plans typically come with several days of looping storage, and the videos will be overwritten beyond this duration. Some cameras include a micro SD card slot so users may store videos locally. There is no looping as long as the memory card has sufficient space to store the images. However, locally stored video footage can not be accessed remotely.  Considerations  Axis 214 PTZ Camera = Potential benefits = Previous generation cameras transmitted analog video signals. IP cameras send images digitally using the transmission and security features of the TCP/IP protocol. Advantages to this approach include: * Two-way audio via a single network cable allows users to listen to and speak to the subject of the video (e.g., a clerk assisting a customer through step-by-step instructions) * Use of a Wi-Fi or wireless network * Distributed artificial intelligence (DAI)—as the camera can contain video analytics that analyze imagesAlexandr Lytkin. IP Video Surveillance. An Essential Guide, 2012, . * Secure data transmission through encryption and authentication methods such as WPA or WPA2, TKIP or AES * Remote accessibility that lets users view live video from any device with sufficient access privileges * Power over Ethernet (PoE) to supply power through the Ethernet cable and operate without a dedicated power supply * Better image Resolution, typically four times the resolution of an analog camera  Artificial intelligence and Internet privacy  The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has expressed privacy concerns if AI is widely practiced. AI is capable of tracking movements and studying behaviors; moreover, AI can also recognize emotions, and further predict patterns of movement.  Facial recognition system  Facial recognition identifies a human face by analyzing facial features from a picture or video, an example of biometrics. If a camera allows users to set up a database that includes family members and close friends, the system may distinguish whether someone exists in the database. If the camera is capable of providing accurate facial recognition, it can tell if the person it detects is authorized (in the database). The detection of unauthorized persons may prompt the owner to call law enforcement. The footage can be used as a means of identifying and apprehending offenders. = Potential concerns = Concerns include: * Privacy concerns * Average higher purchase cost per camera * Security can be compromised by insecure credentials, given that the camera can be accessed independently of a video recorder. * Public internet connection video can be complicated to set up or using the peer-to-peer (P2P) network. *Data storage capacity concerns = Hacking = If the video is transmitted over the public internet rather than a private network or intranet, the system potentially becomes open to a wider audience including hackers. Criminals can hack into a CCTV system to disable or manipulate them or observe security measures and personnel, thereby facilitating criminal acts and rendering the surveillance counterproductive. This can be counteracted by ensuring the network and device and other devices connected to the main router are secured. In 2012, users of 4chan hacked into thousands of streaming personal IP cameras by exploiting a vulnerability in some models of Trendnet home security cameras. In 2014, it was reported that a site indexed 73,011 locations worldwide with security cameras that used default usernames and passwords, and were therefore, unprotected.

Susan Dimock M.D. (April 24, 1847May 7, 1875) was a pioneer in American medicine who received her qualification as a doctor from the University of Zurich in 1871 and was subsequently appointed resident physician of the New England Hospital for Women and Children in 1872. The hospital, now known as the Dimock Community Health Center, was renamed in her honor after her tragic drowning in 1875. Dimock was traveling to Europe for pleasure and profession when she died in the shipwreck of the SS Schiller off the coast of the Scilly Isles. She is also remembered for becoming the first woman member of the North Carolina Medical Society. Childhood Doctor Susan Dimock was born in Washington, North Carolina, the daughter of Henry and Mary Malvina (Owens) Dimock. The family descended from Thomas Dimock who emigrated from England to Dorchester, Massachusetts in 1637 and later resettled in Barnstable, Massachusetts. Susan Dimock was a distant cousin of Ira Dimock (1827–1917), a silk manufacturer, and she was also related to Henry F. Dimock, a New York City attorney associated with the Whitney family business interests. Her father, who was a native of Limington, Maine, was appointed headmaster of Roxbury High School in 1831 even though he was entirely self-educated. Later he moved to North Carolina where he taught school, studied law and was admitted to the bar, and served as editor of the North State Whig. His wife Mary was also a schoolteacher and supplemented their income by managing a hotel.The National Cyclopaedia of American Biography, Vol. XIX, p. 30. New York: James T. White & Company, 1926. After Dimock's father died in 1863, Susan Dimock was home-schooled by her mother. At the close of the Civil War she moved with her mother to Sterling, Massachusetts, where she attended a girls' school and undertook an ambitious reading of every medical textbook she could borrow. In the fall of 1865 she taught school at Hopkinton, Massachusetts. On January 10, 1866, she entered the New England Hospital for Women and Children where she began to learn medicine by close observation in the wards and dispensary. Dimock was also permitted to attend clinical rounds at Massachusetts General Hospital as well as those of the Eye and Ear Infirmary. Professional life When her application to enroll at Harvard Medical School was rejected, Dimock turned to the medical schools of Europe and was admitted to the University of Zurich in Switzerland in 1868. She graduated with high honors in 1871 and her thesis was published that year in Zurich. The last years of her studies she lived in the family of her friend Dr. med. Marie Heim-Vögtlin, where she felt very happy.Müller, Verena E. (2008). Marie Heim-Vögtlin – die erste Schweizer Ärztin (1845–1916): Ein Leben zwischen Tradition und Aufbruch (in German) (2nd ed.). hier+jetzt Verlag. , p.155 Despite her somewhat dire financial situation she decided to go to Vienna together with fellow Zurich medical graduate Marie Bokowa for a few months, where among others she met Auguste Forel and C. E. Hoestermann. The four of them called themselves the \\"Wiener Quartett\\" (Vienna quartet) and planned on meeting again in July 1875 in Zurich.Hans H. Walser (ed.) (1968). August Forel: Briefe. Correspondance 1864 - 1927 (in German, partly French). Verlag Hans Huber, Bern, pp. 82, 85, 487 After her clinical studies in Vienna and Paris, she returned to the United States. As the all- male North Carolina Medical Society would only grant her honorary membership, Dimock rejoined the New England Hospital for Women and Children, where she was appointed resident physician on August 20, 1872. She greatly improved and increased the service of the hospital, in the course of which she opened the first graded school of nursing in the United States on September 1, 1872. She worked as a surgeon, developed a private practice in obstetrics and gynecology and performed a number of important surgical operations, a number of which were mentioned in the medical journals of the day. Legacy Dimock had long wanted to visit Europe once more; when the opportunity to do so came about in May 1875, Dimock and two of her closest friends—Caroline Crane and Elizabeth \\"Bessie\\" Greene (daughter of reformer William Batchelder Greene)--boarded the iron steamship SS Schiller, bound from New York to Plymouth and Hamburg. On 7 May 1875, Dimock, Greene, and Crane were among the 336 people who lost their lives when the hit the Retarrier Ledges off the Isles of Scilly near the Bishop Rock lighthouse in heavy fog. Dimock was 28 years old. Her gravestone at Forest Hills Cemetery, Boston reads: \\"Susan Dimock. Surgeon and physician to the New England Hospital for Women and Children. Lost in the steamer Schiller on the Scilly rocks. May 8 , 1875\\". \\"At the time of her death, her loss was considered irreparable as there were few, if any, among her sex endowed with the skill and qualified by the requisite training to take her place.\\" - The National Cyclopaedia of American Biography, XIX:30 (1926) In 1939 the North Carolina Department of Conservation and Development erected a historic marker in her honour. In 1996, the original marble gravestone was moved from Boston to St. Peter's Episcopal Church cemetery in Washington, North Carolina because a group in Boston decided to replace it with a granite replica. The New England Hospital for Women and Children, where Susan Dimock trained and worked, now bears her name as The Dimock Center, a multi-service agency including Dimock Community Health Center, behavioral health residential programs, and child and family services.https://dimock.org/about/our-rich- history/https://www.massmoments.org/moment-details/dr-susan-dimock-begins- medical-residency.html See also * Sophia Jex-Blake * Elizabeth Blackwell * Elizabeth Garrett Anderson * Linda Richards, America's first trained nurse, trained by Dimock at New England Hospital for Women and Children Notes References * Gravestone of Dr. Susan Dimock * Mass Moments - Dr Susan Dimock begins residency, August 20th 1872 * Susan Dimock M.D. * 1875 Memoir of Susan Dimock reviewed by Cabinet of Art and Medicine. * Ueber die verschiedenen formen des puerperalfiebers : Nach Beobachtungen in der Züricher Gebäranstalt.

The castle was abandoned in the 18th century, and the remaining ruins were pulled down in 1980, leaving only foundations visible. Cathcart Castle from the south-east circa. 1887 History A plan of the castle published in 1887 Queen Mary's Stone at Cathcart Castle in 1900 The lands of Cathcart were held by the family of that name from the 12th century. In the mid-15th century the head of the family was raised to the peerage as Lord Cathcart, and it is believed that the castle was built at around this time.Salter, p.129 In 1546 the castle passed to the Semple family. It is highly unlikely that Mary, Queen of Scots, would have spent the night before the Battle of Langside (1568) at Cathcart Castle or have watched the battle from a nearby hill called the Court Knowe. The Semples were supporters of Mary's enemies and would have captured her and put an end to her plans before the battle had started.Mason, p.81 Court Knowe is some 60m below the height of Langside village, where the battle took place, meaning Mary would not have been able to see what took place. A more likely site would have been Prospecthill, which lies on the line of her army's approach to Langside.Laird of Langside An alternative version of the story has the Queen living with her kinsfolk, the Stuarts of Castlemilk, whose defensive stronghold at the foot of the Cathkin Braes contained a chamber later known as Queen Mary's Room, where Her Majesty supposedly lodged on the night before the Battle of Langside. The ceiling of this room was ornamented with the Arms of the Stuart monarchs of Scotland.Ure, p.158McDowall, p.40 This is unlikely either, as Mary spent the preceding week at Hamilton, where 6000 troops gathered.Guide to the Battle of Langside 2018 In 1740 the Semples built Cathcart House, also since demolished, nearby, and moved out of the castle, leaving it to ruin. The newly created 1st Earl Cathcart bought back his ancestral home in 1814, although with the intention of selling off the stone rather than living in it. In 1866 the castle was still standing to five storeys, and was surrounded by outbuildings.Williamson, Riches and Higgs, p.540 The lands around the castle were purchased by Glasgow City Council in 1927, and added to Linn Park. In 1980 the remaining ruins were pronounced dangerous, and were pulled down by the council. The site is now a Scheduled Monument.Historic Environment Scotland, SM2105 Architecture The castle was built on the rocky north-east bank of the White Cart Water. It comprised a rectangular tower house, , of five storeys including a vaulted basement. This was supplemented by a curtain wall, enclosing a small barmkin approximately , with the tower at the centre. The curtain wall had round corner towers, and a twin-towered gatehouse to the east. The foundations of the tower house remain to around high. Earthworks to the west of the castle have been interpreted as the remains of an outer bailey or ringwork.NMRS Site Ref.

The trail leads along the north bank of the River Dee from Aberdeen to Ballater in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. The track is now part of the National Cycle Network, as National Route 195. History The old Cambus O'May railway station next to the Deeside Way The Deeside Railway was a line that travelled from Aberdeen to Ballater as a stretch of the Great North of Scotland Railway, it closed in 1966 as part of the Beeching cuts. Its tracks have since been removed, except for a small one-mile section used as the Royal Deeside heritage railway, and the path opened to the public on the former route. While in operation, the railway was used by the British Royal Family during travel to their Scottish retreat at Balmoral, hence the local name the Royal Deeside Line. Interest in using the route for recreational purposes for pedestrians and cyclists began in 1971 with the publication of the Parham Report; in 1992 Kincardine and Deeside District Council undertook a feasibility study into creating the Deeside Way. Some parts of the line were acquired for public ownership and the route has been developed in sections over the years. The Deeside Way is now almost complete between Duthie Park in Aberdeen and the Station Square in Ballater. There is currently a gap in the route east of Aboyne from Kirkton to the Victory Hall, and plans to extend the path from Ballater to Braemar. The route upright The pathway runs from Duthie Park, Aberdeen to Peterculter, with two breaks across quiet country roads and a larger one at the busy Milltimber Brae. It then leaves the route of the old line, following a country road for around a mile along Coalford Croft to Old Manse Wood, whence there is a narrow path into Drumoak. The route follows the A93 North Deeside Road for a few hundred yards to a signposted path that rejoins the former railway line to Crathes, where it is necessary to use another short stretch of the A93 and the A957 to a minor road onto the path once more. This leads past Milton of Crathes, and alongside the Deeside Railway to arrive in Bellfield Park in Banchory. The route then continues on to Potarch, where work was carried out in 2010 to repair footpaths around Scolty Hill which now forms part of the route. From Potarch, the path runs over a bridge before heading alongside the River Dee, and into Kincardine O'Neil. A bridge across Holburn Street in Aberdeen was built in 2005, and in March 2010 another bridge was opened over West Cults Road.Aberdeen City Council (2010). \\"New footbridge leading to historic Deeside Way opened\\" There are plans to eventually improve the line so that all breaks will be bridged providing a safe unbroken path from the Duthie Park to Banchory. The route is to connect up to Ballater via Kincardine O'Neil, instead of following the original line through Lumphanan. Only the route between Banchory and Potarch, and Kincardine O'Neil and Aboyne remain to be completed in order for the path to run completely from Aberdeen to Ballater. Laying of tarmac along sections of the path within built-up areas of Aberdeen has taken place to improve from the current path which floods leading to thick mud patches during the autumn and winter months.

The book received critical acclaim. It won the major prize at the 2006 New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards,\\"Flannery takes top gong at Premier's Literary Awards\\" ABC News Online 23 May 2006 and was short-listed for the 2010 Jan Michalski Prize for Literature.  Description  The book includes 36 short essays predicting the consequences of global warming and has been translated into over twenty languages. The book reviews evidence of historical climate change and attempts to compare this with the current era. The book argues that if atmospheric carbon dioxide levels continue to increase at current rates, the resulting climate change will cause mass species extinctions. The book also asserts that global temperatures have already risen enough to cause the annual monsoon rains in the Sahel region of Africa to diminish, causing droughts and desertification. This in turn, according to Flannery, has contributed to the conflict in the Darfur region through competition for disappearing resources. Further consequences, argued in the book, include increasing hurricane intensity, and decline in the health of coral reefs. The final third of the book discusses proposed solutions. Flannery advocates individual action as well as international and governmental actions. He argues that a few industries such as the coal industry, currently responsible for 40% of the energy consumed in the U.S., remain opponents of needed action. The book retraces the evidence that the American administration , motivated by coal-industry donations to the Republican party, undermines political action by omitting mention of climate change from government documents. The book cites evidence against the argument that conservation is bad for economies.Summary of the book in The Quarterly Conversation.  Impact  In the introduction of Atmosphere of Hope. Solutions to the Climate Crisis (2015), Tim Flannery mention some people who were influenced by reading The Weather Makers (2005)Tim Flannery, Atmosphere of Hope. Solutions to the Climate Crisis, Penguin Books, 2015, pages 1-11 (). He wrote that the book 'alerted' Richard Branson, who recommended it to Arnold Schwarzenegger (Governor of California, who signed the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006) and established the Virgin Earth Challenge as well as the Carbon War Room. Gordon Campbell, Premier of British Columbia, said that he introduced a carbon tax in British Columbia after reading The Weather Makers. The book also alerted Zhou Ji, president of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, 'to the extent of the climate problem'. The book was cited as contributing to Flannery being named Australian of the Year in 2007 for his clear and accessible communication of climate change science and its likely consequences for a fragile planet .

First opened as the Middlesex Infirmary in 1745 on Windmill Street, it was moved in 1757 to Mortimer Street where it remained until it was finally closed in 2005. Its staff and services were transferred to various sites within the University College London Hospitals NHS Trust. The Middlesex Hospital Medical School, with a history dating back to 1746, merged with the medical school of University College London in 1987. History Engraving of Middlesex Hospital seen from the south in 1830 =Development of the hospital= The first Middlesex Hospital, which was named after the county of Middlesex, opened as the Middlesex Infirmary in Windmill Street in 1745. The infirmary started with 15 beds to provide medical treatment for the poor. Funding came from subscriptions and, in 1747, the hospital became the first in England to add lying-in (maternity) beds. The foundation stone for the second Middlesex Hospital, in Mortimer Street, was laid by the hospital's president, the Earl of Northumberland, in 1755. The central block of the new hospital opened in 1757. Over the years extra wings were added but, in 1924, it was decided that the building was structurally unsound and an entirely new building would be required. The Duke of York, later King George VI, having visited the hospital on 26 June 1928 to lay the foundation stone of the new building, returned on 29 May 1935 to open the completed building. The hospital had been completely rebuilt, on the same site and in stages, without ever being closed, paid for by more than £1 million of donations from members of the public. After coming under the management of the Bloomsbury Health Authority in 1980, the Middlesex Hospital became associated with various specialist hospitals in the local area. In 1992 the local urology hospitals, St Paul's, St Peter's and St Philip's, were closed down with services transferred to new accommodation in the Middlesex Hospital. =Middlesex Hospital Medical School= The Middlesex Hospital Medical School traced its origins to 1746 (a year after the foundation of the Middlesex Hospital), when students were 'walking the wards'. The motto of the medical school, Miseris Succurrere Disco, was provided by one of the deans, Dr William Cayley, from Virgil's passage about Queen Dido aiding a shipwreck: Non ignara mali, miseris succurrere disco (\\"Not unacquainted with misfortune myself, I learn to succour the distressed\\"). At the establishment of the then London University (now University College London), the governors of the Middlesex Hospital declined permission of the former's medical students to use the wards of the Middlesex Hospital for clinical training. This refusal prompted the foundation of the North London Hospital, now University College Hospital, in 1834. The medical schools of the Middlesex Hospital and University College Hospital merged in 1987 to form the University College and Middlesex School of Medicine (UCMSM). UCMSM itself merged with the Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine in 1998 to form the UCL Medical School. The Courtauld Institute of Biochemistry of the Middlesex Hospital Medical School was opened by Samuel Augustine Courtauld in 1928, the foundation stone having been laid on 20 July 1927. Its main entrance was in Riding House Street. Courtauld also endowed a Chair of Biochemistry. =Closure and redevelopment= The Middlesex Hospital closed in December 2005. The main hospital building in Mortimer Street was sold to developer Project Abbey (Guernsey) Ltd, a company controlled by Christian and Nick Candy, and was demolished in 2008. The building was used, just before it was demolished, in the film Eastern Promises. Candy and Candy failed in plans to redevelop the site into a 273-apartment luxury accommodation complex, named \\"NoHo Square\\", and transferred the property to the nationalised Icelandic bank, Kaupthing Bank. The site was purchased by Clive Bush and Daniel Van Gelder's Exemplar Properties and Aviva Investors in July 2010. Exemplar decided against retaining either the Candy and Candy designs or the NoHo Square name, and instead appointed new architects in Lifschutz Davidson Sandilands and Sheppard Robson to prepare new designs. Following a public exhibition, a planning application for the proposed scheme was submitted in September 2011. Planning consent for the new development, now called Fitzroy Place, was granted in February 2012. The new development, which combines 295 homes with 240,000 sq ft of offices, including the regional headquarters for cosmetics multinational Estée Lauder, was completed in 2016. =Fitzrovia Chapel = Interior of the restored chapel in September 2015 The former chapel of the Middlesex Hospital by John Loughborough Pearson is now the only surviving building of the Hospital. The chapel was completed after the architect's death under the supervision of his son, Frank, also an architect. The chapel was structurally complete by the mid-1920s; the surrounding hospital was then demolished and rebuilt around it between 1928 and 1929. The chapel was not formally opened until 1929, by which time much of the lavish interior decoration of marbles and mosaic in a mix of Italian gothic and romanesque styles had been added, giving it the appearance it broadly retains today. The chapel is a Grade II* Listed building. The fabric of the chapel was allowed to decline in the closing decades of the Middlesex Hospital, with water ingress through the roof causing substantial damage to the fabric of the building. The chapel fabric and interior was subject to a £2m restoration, and the building re-endowed with maintenance funds by Exemplar Properties. Never consecrated, named or dedicated, the chapel was given the name \\"Fitzrovia Chapel\\". =Paintings of Frederick Cayley Robinson= For nearly 100 years, four giant paintings welcomed visitors to the reception area of The Middlesex Hospital. The Acts of Mercy were painted in 1912 by Frederick Cayley Robinson, a distinctive yet elusive British artist, after being commissioned by Sir Edmund Davis, one of the governors of the hospital. Prior to the demolition of the hospital, the art was purchased by the Wellcome Library. =Notable patients= People reported to have died there include: *William Gerhardie, novelist and playwright (1977)Article by Michael Holroyd. *Peter Sellers, actor (1980) People who have been treated here include: *Winston Churchill (1962) *Jeffrey Bernard (1997)  See also  * List of demolished buildings and structures in London * Central Middlesex Hospital * North Middlesex Hospital * West Middlesex Hospital * John Raymond Hobbs * List of hospitals in England References External links * * Fitzrovia Chapel website * An audio slideshow of the paintings and art of Frederick Cayley Robinson Category:Hospital buildings completed in 1882 Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1757 Category:Hospital buildings completed in the 18th century Category:Hospital buildings completed in 1928 Category:University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust Category:NHS hospitals in London Category:1745 establishments in England Category:Hospitals established in the 1740s Category:2005 disestablishments in England Category:Defunct hospitals in London Category:Demolished buildings and structures in London Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 2008 Category:Fitzrovia ","title":"Middlesex Hospital"},{"id":"9462998","text":"Liang Court (Simplified Chinese: 亮阁, Traditional Chinese: 亮閣, Pinyin: Liàng Gé) is a former shopping mall located in the vicinity of Clarke Quay, on the Singapore River. It was part of a mixed-use complex that includes the hotel Novotel Clarke Quay (formerly Hotel New Otani) and Somerset Residences. History Developed by the Wuthelam Group in collaboration with Daimaru Inc, Liang Court opened in January 1984 as the first major shopping mall along River Valley Road. At that time of opening, it had Japanese department store and supermarket chain Daimaru, lifestyle bookstore Kinokuniya, Chinese restaurant Tung Lok Signatures, karaoke chain Party World, consumer electronics chain SAFE Superstore and more than 60 speciality tenants mostly catering to Japanese expatriates. Above Liang Court were two 25-storey tower blocks occupied by Hotel New Otani Singapore and serviced apartment Somerset Liang Court, which opened in November 1984. In 2000, Rainforest Cafe opened in the lower floors but was closed in 2004 due to declining patronage. In 2003, Daimaru closed down due to declining sales and restructuring. Its supermarket section was taken over by Meidi-Ya and department store section taken over by electronics chain Audio House and smaller shops. Hotel New Otani's management was taken over by Accor Hotels in December 2004, and was subsequently renamed Novotel Singapore Clarke Quay. The mall changed hands twice, having been sold to Pidemco Land in 1999 and subsequently sold to the Asia Retail Management Fund in 2006. Under ARMF management, the mall underwent major refurbishment works in 2007, coupled with a repositioning of its image. The space once taken up by Daimaru was reconfigured into smaller shops, and Audio House was relocated to Level 4. The basement shops were replaced by Japanese restaurants and shops catering to Japanese expatriates. Refurbishment works were completed in 2010. Uniqlo opened at the mall's ground floor in November 2013. In August 2016, Audio House closed down its only mall-based store. Following declining business, the mall was sold to a joint venture between CapitaLand and City Developments Limited in March 2019. Kinokuniya closed its store in April 2019, following the end of its 32-year lease, with various shops and restaurants following suit by the end of that year. All shops were eventually closed in April 2020, along with the hotel and serviced apartments. In November 2019, CapitaLand and its subsidiary Ascott REIT, along with City Developments Limited announced that Liang Court will be redeveloped into a mixed-use, integrated development featuring two residential towers with 700 condo units, a retail mall, a hotel managed by Marriott International under the Moxy brand and a 192-unit Somerset serviced residence. The new development is expected to open in phases from 2024, with the Moxy Hotel opening in 2025.

He succeeded Donald MacDonald as the party's leader, after MacDonald lost his seat in the 1945 general election. He represented the electoral district (riding) of Cape Breton East in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly from 1945 until 1956.

Previous MP  The seat had become vacant when the constituency's Conservative Member of Parliament (MP), John Eastwood, resigned his seat following his appointment as a Metropolitan Police magistrate. He had been Kettering's MP since the 1931 general election, when he defeated the sitting Labour MP Samuel Perry.  Candidates  The Conservative candidate was John Profumo, a British Army officer and son of a prominent barrister of Italian origin. During the Second World War unopposed by-elections were common, since the major parties had agreed not to contest by-elections when vacancies arose in seats held by the other parties; contests occurred only when independent candidates or minor parties chose to stand. However, William Ross, a local steelworker and Labour Party councillor in Corby, wanted to contest the seat. He was disowned by his local Labour Party and by the party's National Executive Committee, and stood as a \\"Workers' and Pensioners' Anti- War\\" candidate.  Result  On a turnout barely half of that at the 1935 general election, Profumo held the seat comfortably, with 73% of the votes. After a successful career in the army (where he rose to the rank of Brigadier and was awarded an OBE), he was defeated at the 1945 general election. He returned to Parliament in 1950, and rose to become Secretary of State for War in 1960, before his career was destroyed in 1963 by a political scandal which became known as the Profumo affair.

Free hydrogen atoms are able to bind to the SiO2 silica glass compound forming hydroxyl (OH)—a chemical compound that interferes with the passage of light through the glass. The problem is particularly relevant to fiber optic cables—particularly in oil and gas wells where fiber optic cables are used for distributed temperature sensing. Hydrogen can be present due to the cracking of hydrocarbons in the well. The darkening of the fiber can distort the DTS reading and possibly render the DTS system inoperable due to the optical loss budget being exceeded. To prevent this, coatings such as carbon are applied to the fiber, and hydrogen capturing gels are used to buffer the fiber, and other proprietary techniques may be used to prevent hydrogen atoms from reaching the glass fiber via the cable sheath.

Biography Isaac Wayne was born in County Wicklow, Ireland, in 1699 to Captain Anthony Wayne, veteran of the Battle of the Boyne. In 1722, Capt. Anthony Wayne moved to Pennsylvania with Dutch-born wife, Hannah Faulkner, eight of their nine children, and Wayne's close friend and fellow veteran, John Hunter. It is speculated that Hannah was the daughter of one of the better-rewarded Dutch officers. They settled on a estate in Easttown, Chester County, in what became the town of Paoli in 1724. Their stone home called Waynesborough is now a designated historical site and open for public tours. Isaac, the ninth child, stayed in England to finish his education and joined the family two years later. Isaac was 40 years old when his parents deeded their estate to him under the condition that he was to pay an annuity to his parents for the remainder of their lives. He built up the largest tannery in Pennsylvania, grew grain, and feed-crops. His militia commission enabled him to go out when the Indians rose or threatened, as he did during the French and Indian War between 1755 and 1758. When he was reaching forty, he took as his bride Elizabeth Iddings of Philadelphia, who was probably 10 years younger. Isaac and Elizabeth Iddings Wayne had four children: * Anthony Wayne, a major general during the American Revolution * Hannah, who married Samuel Van Leer, a Captain during the American Revolution, owner of a large Iron business and nearby historical homes. * Ann, who married Capt.

Geom selected Prince Anseung, a descendant of king Bojang, to become the new king of the revived Goguryeo. 《新唐书卷二百三十六·列传第一百四十五》 This new Goguryeo was greatly assisted by Silla and its ruler, Munmu of Silla. 《三国史记卷七·新羅本紀七·文武王十四年》 Two factions arose from within the kingdom, and the infighting resulted in the assassination of Geom Mojam on King Anseung's orders. Geom Mojam's death left the restored Goguryeo gravely weakened. Anseung surrendered to King Munmu shortly after the event, and was given the title \\"King of Bodeok\\" as well as the Silla Royal surname \\"Kim\\". 《新唐书·高丽传》:“总章二年，己巳二月，王之庶子安胜，率四千余户，投新罗。””《三国史记卷八·新羅本紀八·神文王三年》 The exact number of Goguryeo people that followed Anseung into Silla is unknown, but it is thought that most of them became a part of the Kingdom of Bodeok. 《三国史记卷七·新羅本紀七·文武王十八年》The Kingdom of Bodeok was demolished in 683 by King Sinmun, son of King Munmu, mostly due to the possible threat of rebellion by the Goguryeo people.

It was designed by architects Leon and Lionel Levy in a modified International Style, and included both a low building with exhibition space and a 26-story office block. The project also included the construction of a housing development directly behind the complex. The Coliseum was planned by Robert Moses, an urban planner and the chairman of the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority (TBTA). In 1946, it was proposed to build a convention center within a new Madison Square Garden building at Columbus Circle. This plan was not successful, nor was another plan for Metropolitan Opera House. After years of delays, the Coliseum was approved in 1953, and construction started in 1954. The Coliseum hosted its first exhibits on April 28, 1956, followed by hundreds of conventions over the next four decades. The Coliseum supplanted the Grand Central Palace as the city's main convention center until the 1980s, when the Coliseum was superseded in that role by the Javits Center. The TBTA's successor, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), started looking for buyers in order to raise money for its operations. Boston Properties attempted to negotiate a lease between 1987 and 1994. The site was ultimately bought by a joint venture between Time Warner and The Related Companies in 1998, and the Coliseum was demolished in 2000 to make way for the Time Warner Center.  Description  The Coliseum was located on the west side of Columbus Circle. It occupied the block from West 58th to West 60th Streets between Eighth and Ninth Avenues. One block of 59th Street was decommissioned to make way for the complex. The Coliseum contained four exhibition floors, including a -square, three-story void for exhibiting large items, such as sailboats and airplanes. The exhibition space did not contain any windows; its exterior was instead sheathed in plain white stone. The space had three separate entrances and could host up to six shows at the same time. Nine elevators and five escalators were installed in this part of the building, as was a two-lane truck ramp. Upon the Coliseum's opening, one of the freight elevators was said to be larger than any other elevator in existence, except for the airplane elevators present on aircraft carriers. The attached office building had 26 stories and was covered in white and gray brick. The complex was designed by Leon and Lionel Levy. The complex cost $35 million to build, of which $26.5 million came from toll revenues collected by the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority (TBTA). The sculptor Paul Manship was commissioned to design four plaques for the Coliseum. The four plaques depicted the federal, state, city, and TBTA seals. Just before the Coliseum was demolished, the MTA removed the plaques for restoration. Christopher Gray of The New York Times criticized the complex as a \\"low point for New York's public buildings\\". He said that the visual relationship between the windowless convention space and the grid-shaped facade of the office building \\"was awkward at best\\". Gray quoted another magazine, Art News, as stating that the complex contained a \\"total lack of relation to its site\\". After the Coliseum's demolition was completed in 2000, Joyce Purnick of the Times wrote, \\"What was always wrong about the Coliseum was its original conception. It was, as an exhibition hall, broad and impenetrable, a wall of blond brick. There it sat at the gateway to Central Park—an unblinking barrier.\\" Coliseum commemorative stamp A U.S. postage stamp commemorates the Fifth International Philatelic Exhibition as well as the Coliseum. History =Planning= The Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority's chairman, Robert Moses, first envisioned a convention center for New York City in 1944. Separately, in 1946, the Madison Square Garden Corporation proposed building a large sports arena along the western edge of Columbus Circle between 58th and 60th Streets, supplementing the existing Madison Square Garden (MSG) ten blocks south. The nine-story MSG annex would include a 25,000- to 27,000-seat arena, a convention space, and a 2,000-car garage. The convention space would the world's largest. The TBTA would build the new MSG building and issue bonds to finance construction, and the city would take over the building after the bonds were paid off. In this original plan, the structure would have been located above 59th Street. The cost of construction was projected at $25 million; the land itself was said to cost $5 million. The plans were delayed in February 1947, when the New York State Assembly's Ways and Means Committee failed to act on a bill that would have authorized the construction of the new MSG building. Supporters of the project stated that New York City had already lost the opportunity to host several large expositions due to the inadequate facilities at the Grand Central Palace, the city's only convention center at the time. In April 1948, Governor Thomas E. Dewey signed a bill that authorized the MSG annex's construction. However, due to disagreements among the MSG Corporation's board of directors, the project was put on hold in April 1949. During this delay in the plans, several private interests purchased large tracts of land on the site of the proposed MSG annex. Negotiations resumed in October of that year, with the expectation that construction would begin in spring 1950. By this time, the project was known as the \\"Columbus Circle Coliseum\\". In The Power Broker, Moses biographer Robert Caro states that the Coliseum's name \\"reveals Moses' preoccupation with achieving an immortality conferred on the Caesars of Rome\\". In May 1951, the city offered the Metropolitan Opera and New York Philharmonic a chance to build a new opera house and operate it tax-free on part of the Coliseum's land. The New York Times described it as Moses's \\"new approach\\" toward the project. At this point, the land for the Coliseum had still not been acquired. By July 1951, more than half the $1 million cost for the proposed Metropolitan Opera House's site had been raised. By January 1952, the opera had achieved $900,000 of the cost of acquisition, which had jumped to $1.2 million. However, the plan for a Metropolitan Opera House at Columbus Circle was dropped in March 1952. Moses later said that the problems surrounding the site, including internal conflicts among the Metropolitan Opera's directors regarding whether the opera should simply rebuild its existing opera house. The Columbus Circle Coliseum was included in the Columbus Circle Urban Renewal Plan, published in 1952. In April 1952, the Federal Housing and Home Finance Agency advanced $40,000 toward slum clearing. Slightly more than half of the plot was to contain an apartment complex so Moses could receive two-thirds federal funding for clearing the slums on the site. The two-thirds federal funding for slum clearing could only be approved by the Federal Housing Administration if at least half the site were used for housing. Thus, housing took up the western 51% of the block, facing Ninth and Columbus Avenues, while the Coliseum took up the eastern 49%, facing Columbus Circle. By October 1952, Moses said that builders were ready to start construction on the Coliseum, but he emphasised that the MSG arena was no longer part of the plan. In December of that year, the plan to build a convention center and two 12-story residential towers was submitted to the New York City Board of Estimate and Mayor Vincent R. Impellitteri. The Board of Estimate quickly voted to approve the Coliseum project because of an expected turnover in Housing and Home Finance Agency leadership, which in turn was occurring due to the election of President Dwight D. Eisenhower that year. = Construction and opening = Looking west from Columbus Circle toward the superblock once occupied by the New York Coliseum, now occupied by the Time Warner Center As part of the Coliseum project, Moses condemned the area from West 58th to West 60th Streets on the west side of Columbus Circle. However, the start of construction was delayed by a lawsuit from a taxpayer who wanted an injunction on the acquisition. The Grand Central Palace held its last show in late 1953, and due to the delays in building the Coliseum, it was anticipated that New York City would not have a convention space for the following three years. An appeals court gave the city the right to acquire the land for the project in October 1953, and the city obtained the land in November of that year. The Coliseum project, as well as the related development of housing, was approved in December 1953. It replaced the Gotham National Bank Building as well as smaller tenement and retail buildings. In the original plan, there would have been a separate office building and convention center, but the two structures were combined in a late revision to the plan. There would also be a 900-space parking lot under the Coliseum. The cornerstone for the Coliseum was laid on October 22, 1954. Seventy-five subcontractors from forty construction trades were hired to build the Coliseum. In May 1955, an accident occurred in which an component of the exhibition space collapsed while concrete was being poured into it. The accident injured 50 workers and killed one. A subsequent investigation found no evidence of criminal negligence. The Coliseum opened on April 28, 1956, with three exhibitions: the New York International Auto Show, the National Photographic Show, and the International Philatelic Exhibition. One observer wrote of the new convention center, \\"The Coliseum is extraordinary in many ways. Its vastness must be seen—from the inside—to be believed\\". Ground was broken for the housing to the west of the Coliseum on May 1, 1956, three days after the center's official opening. It was complete by September 1957. The new housing development, called Coliseum Park, consisted of two 15-story buildings at 58th and 60th Streets with 590 units between them, as well as a park separating the two buildings. By the first anniversary of the Coliseum's opening, over three million people had visited the convention center. Additionally, 70% of the attached office building had been leased. The opening of the Coliseum, as well as other nearby projects such as a new tube for the Lincoln Tunnel, gave rise to a new zoning plan for the Far West Side of Manhattan. This rezoning allowed for a series of new developments in the formerly blighted Hell's Kitchen neighborhood. The number of renters in Hell's Kitchen also increased following the Coliseum's opening. In 1959, a bilateral agreement was made between the United States and Soviet Union. As part of the agreement, the American National Exhibition was to be held in Moscow, and the Russians were to host the Soviet National Exhibition at the New York Coliseum from June 29, 1959, to late July 1959. Sputnik, the Soviet satellite launched in 1957, was a focal point amidst exhibits on Soviet industry and agriculture, as were musical and theatrical performances.U.S. National Archives and Records Administration, College Park, MD, Record Group 306 (USIA), entry 1050, box 7, hereafter NARA 306/1050/7; “Memorandum of Agreement between U.S.–U.S.S.R. Representatives Pertinent to the Staging of a U.S. Exhibit in Moscow,” NARA 306/1050/7; protocol agreement of 10 September 1958 on exchange of exhibitions, Gosudarstvennyi arkhiv Rossiiskoi Federatsii (GARF) f. 9518, op. 1, d. 595, l. 131(correspondence relating to American exhibition, Moscow 1959). By 1967, the Coliseum had hosted 247 major events with a total of 24 million visitors. The Coliseum had a tax agreement with the city, wherein the city government would collect a portion of the TBTA's revenue rather than collect taxes on the Coliseum property. Within the first ten years of the Coliseum's opening, the city had collected almost $9.1 million from the TBTA. Up to the end of 1986, the Coliseum hosted 1,246 events. Conventions held at the Coliseum included the New York International Auto Show; the International Flower Show; the International Home Expo; the New York Coliseum Antiques Show; the National Photographic Show; and the Philatelic Exhibition. Until the 1970s, the Coliseum was usually hosting one show at any given time. However, the Coliseum had a limited amount of space, and exhibitions started to move to other cities with larger convention centers. A larger replacement, the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, was announced in 1979. =Closure and demolition= The Javits Center effectively supplanted the Coliseum as the major exhibit space in New York City. By the time of the announcement of the Javits Center, the Coliseum had become dated and redundant. In 1984, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), by now the parent of the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, announced that it was placing the property for sale. The MTA and the city jointly owned the property, and all proceeds would go to improving the MTA's transit systems. In 1985, the architect Moshe Safdie revealed his plans for twin 70-story-high towers at the site. Representatives for over 100 developers and architectural firms showed interest in the redevelopment of the Coliseum. The plan received opposition from the community. Many community members expressed concerns that the proposal did not fit in with the mostly residential character of the surrounding neighborhood of Lincoln Square. They stated that the twin towers would cast long shadows over Central Park, across the circle. Critics also expressed concern about the project's impact on traffic around Lincoln Square. Notable opponents included the Municipal Art Society, who, led by former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, filed a lawsuit to try to stop the project from being approved. The Coliseum was shuttered in 1986 with the expectation that it would be demolished as soon as an agreement with developers was finalized. Fourteen proposals for the redevelopment of the Coliseum site were submitted. Ultimately, there were two finalists: a joint venture between Boston Properties and Phibro-Salomon Inc., and another between New York Land Company and Kumagai Gumi. Boston Properties' plan was unanimously approved by the New York City Council in December 1986. In 1987, the MTA agreed to sell the Coliseum and its office building to Boston Properties for $477.5 million. Under Boston Properties' plan, the Coliseum would be demolished by 1988 and replaced by a headquarters for Salomon Brothers, a subsidiary of Phibro- Salomon. Boston Properties would also have renovated the New York City Subway's 59th Street–Columbus Circle station for $40 million as part of the project. The new Salomon Brothers headquarters would have been called the \\"Columbus Center\\". The developer, Boston Properties CEO Mortimer Zuckerman, then entered negotiations with the MTA and the city. The MTA wanted a down payment, so Zuckerman placed a $5.7 million letter of credit for his portion of the sale, while Salomon Brothers paid the other $39.8 million. Due to continuing opposition from the community, Zuckerman downsized the proposal so that the towers were 58 and 68 stories high. In January 1988, Salomon Brothers withdrew from the project due to the October 1987 stock market crash. After Zuckerman threatened to sue Salomon Brothers, they reached a settlement of between $55 million and $60 million. In December 1988, a state court ruled that the proposed building violated the city's own zoning ordinances and nullified the sale. New York City and Boston Properties renegotiated the deal to call for a 52-story structure with a reduced price of $357 million for the site. Boston Properties tapped David Childs to redesign the building. In the interim, the MTA, seeking to make some use of the site once the future of the Boston Properties site became unclear, reopened the Coliseum on an interim basis in 1992 for smaller events, primarily a thrice-a-year antiques show. Some homeless individuals also squatted at the building when it was abandoned. The Time Warner Center, which replaced the ColiseumThe failure to close the sale of the New York Coliseum was having negative effects on the MTA's finances. In August 1990, the agency announced that several improvement projects worth $500 million would need to be delayed if the coliseum was not sold by the end of 1991. Zuckerman continued to negotiate with the MTA, but faced problems when Mayor David Dinkins refused to call Zuckerman's letter of credit until just before leaving office in 1993. In early 1994, newly elected mayor Rudy Giuliani requested that a third party appraise the site, which Zuckerman wanted to purchase for $100 million. While the third party determined that the New York Coliseum site was worth $57 million, MTA chairman Peter Stangl said that the site was worth $200 million. By 1994, the sale had still not been finalized, and in April of that year, Giuliani requested a third-party appraisal of the site. If the contract was not signed that month, Zuckerman would lose his $33 million down payment. As a result, the real estate developer exercised an option for a 55-day postponement in signing the deal. In May 1994, Zuckerman proposed to buy the site for $80 million, less than a quarter of the original price. The MTA refused, saying that any price less than $100 million was unacceptable. The $80 million sale price was agreed-on in June. However, when the deadline for signing the contract passed in July 1994, Zuckerman still had not signed the contract, and negotiations between him and the MTA collapsed. By this time, the plans for Columbus Center had been reduced three times. Zuckerman lost $17 million as a result of the deal's cancellation, while the MTA was able to sever its strained relationship with Zuckerman. By October 1994, the MTA was deciding whether to keep using the Coliseum or to proceed with trying to find a buyer. In the late 1990s, another attempt to sell the Coliseum was made, this time to an investment firm headed by Israel Englander, who proposed to build luxury apartments and a ballroom on the site. However, with the real estate market rebounding, a critical $50 million tax break was withdrawn by then-mayor Rudolph Giuliani (who saw a tax break for a property that would not draw permanent jobs to the site as unnecessary), at which point Englander's Millennium Partners walked away from the project. By 1997, there were nine bids for the redevelopment of the Coliseum site. At this point, the entire area around Columbus Circle was being redeveloped, but six separate government agencies were handling different parts of the process. The president of the Municipal Art Society said, \\"This is the last time in our lifetime that such an important chunk of Manhattan is going to be up for redesign and rebuilding. [...] 'This one has got to be done right. It can't be just another development.\\" In 1998, the MTA finally agreed to sell the property to a joint venture of Time Warner and The Related Companies for $345 million. Time Warner would use the land to build its world headquarters. Like the original plan, Time Warner's proposed headquarters consisted of twin towers. However, the new plan differed in that the towers were only 55 stories tall, had a glass facade, and ran along the circumference of Columbus Circle, with the towers' sides running parallel to Broadway's diagonal route through the circle. The Coliseum closed for good in January 1998. Following asbestos abatement, demolition of the Coliseum and its attached office building began in the winter of 2000 and was complete by that summer. The Time Warner/Related joint project, now called the Time Warner Center, now stands on the site.

Scan conversion or scan converting rate is a video processing technique for changing the vertical / horizontal scan frequency of video signal for different purposes and applications. The device which performs this conversion is called a scan converter. The application of scan conversion is wide and covers video projectors, cinema equipment, TV and video capture cards, standard and HDTV televisions, LCD monitors, radar displays and many different aspects of picture processing.  Mechanisms and methods  Scan conversion involves changing the picture information data rate and wrapping the new picture in appropriate synchronization signals. There are two distinct methods for changing a picture's data rate: ;Analog Methods (Non retentive, memory-less or real time method) This conversion is done using large numbers of delay cells and is appropriate for analog video. It may also be performed using a specialized scan converter vacuum tube. In this case polar coordinates (angle and distance) data from a source such as a radar receiver, so that it can be displayed on a raster scan (TV type) display. ;Digital methods (Retentive or buffered method) In this method, a picture is stored in a line or frame buffer with n1 speed (data rate) and is read with n2 speed, several picture processing techniques are applicable when the picture is stored in buffer memory including kinds of interpolation from simple to smart high order comparisons, motion detection and … to improve the picture quality and prevent the conversion artifacts.US patent US4220969 / CA1103345A1, Kazuhiko Nitadori, \\"Digital scan converter\\", published September 2, 1980. assigned to OKI Electric Ind.

It is named after the Acts of Union 1800 with Ireland. The street is approximately one mile long (0.8 miles) and a feat of engineering skill involving the partial levelling of St. Catherine's Hill and the building of arches to carry the street over Putachieside. The Denburn Valley was crossed by Union Street by Union Bridge (constructed 1801–05). The Union Street holds the record of the 'Worlds largest single span granite bridge' at across. History Union Street was built to relieve the strain of the small, cramped streets that caused problems for people coming into the city. It was built higher than the old town and was designed to include the five entrances from the city: Queens Road - Rubislaw from Hazelhead; George Street from Inverurie and Morayshire; King Street from the north from Bridge Of Don, Peterhead and Fraserburgh; Market Street, which leads to the fishing town of Torry; and Holburn Street to the Ruthrieston and Garthdee areas.Diane Morgan - Granite Mile: The Story Of Aberdeen's Union Street The street was designed in the beginning of the 19th century under plans suggested by Charles Abercrombie and nearly bankrupted the city. The Denburn River still runs under Union Bridge but has been covered over by a dual carriageway road. The Aberdeen tram network operated through Union Street from 1874 to 1958. Work began in May 2020 to partially pedestrianise the street and to widen the pavements. The street has been completely pedestrianised between Bridge Street and Market Street, with buses routed through Guild Street instead. The street continues to be used by many of Aberdeen's bus services. Shops and markets Some of the large shops on or accessed directly from Union Street are Marks and Spencer (on St. Nicholas Street), HMV, Mostyn McKenzie, Cruise, AllSaints, Lakeland, Debenhams (in the Trinity Centre) and Sports Direct. The street was home to Bruce Miller's notable musical instrument shop (established 1900) until June 2011, when it closed. Shopping centres include the St Nicholas & Bon Accord and the Trinity Shopping Centre. In addition there are bars and a number of nightclubs on the street, a former cinema building, and a grand façade fronting the churchyard of the Kirk of St. Nicholas. Jamie Oliver also opened an Italian restaurant in the former Esslemont & Mackintosh department store sometime in 2013, however this closed in January 2017. In 2012, HSBC opened its biggest Scottish branch on the street. Pret A Manger also opened. Union Street International Market Part of Union Street was occasionally closed off to traffic for the Aberdeen International Street Market until it was moved to Union Terrace, which is adjacent to Union Terrace Gardens. The market is usually held during the springtime. In the runup to Christmas, elaborate Christmas lights are displayed on gantries above and across the street. A ceremony is usually held to mark the illumination of these lights. Granite Mile The Granite Mile is a local name for the long stretch of road that encompasses Union Street. Granite Mile begins at the Castlegate, and the Mercat Cross, near Justice Street . It follows the length of Union Street to Holburn Junction.

The report identified five major defects in planning which it believed had become evident by the end of 1983: * Public capital expenditure rose during the oil boom at a much faster rate than Nigeria's physical, technical or financial abilities. * Huge expenditure on particular industrial projects did not yield expected returns because of \\"inappropriate choices in their selection, size, design, location and management.\\" * Government policies laid too much emphasis on industrialisation, without regard to Nigeria's resource base and comparative advantage. * Frequent changes in fiscal and monetary policies created planning problems for the private sector. * The exchange rate of the naira was not managed \\"to reflect the basic strength of the economy and the need to encourage domestic production.\\"ANDREW GOWERS, \\" Devastating chronicle of mismanagement.\\" 25 February 1985,, Financial Times (London, England) In 1995, he became the Chairman of the Niger Delta Environmental Survey, a non- governmental organisation that conducted scientific studies on environmental and social impact assessment of oil exploration in the Niger delta.

He began his career in 1899 in Moscow, working in the Art Nouveau style. After relocating to Saint Petersburg in 1905, he became an established master of the Neoclassical Revival movement. Following the Russian Revolution of 1917 Fomin developed a Soviet adaptation of Neoclassicism and became one of the key contributors to an early phase of Stalinist architecture known as postconstructivism. Early years Born in Oryol, Fomin received a classical Classical Russian gimnasia was an elite form of high school, biased towards Greek and Roman studies education at a high school in Riga, and studied mathematics at the Moscow University. In 1894, he joined the Imperial Academy of Arts in Saint Petersburg but was expelled in 1896Russian bio: Лисовский В.Г., \\"И.А. Фомин\\", М, 1979. Other sources place expulsion in 1897 for political activities. After a year of studies in France, Fomin settled in Moscow and passed the tests for a contractor’s license. He worked for Lev Kekushev and Fyodor Schechtel, two leading masters of Art Nouveau. Schechtel assigned him to Moscow Art Theatre project, which exposed Fomin to the public and eventually brought him his first own commissions. Art Nouveau (1899-1903) This section is based on \\"Architecture of Moscow Moderne\\" by M. V. NaschokinaRussian: Нащокина М.В. Архитекторы московского модерна. М., Жираф. 1998.С.216 Fomin's early style was related to Schekhtel's and Austrian Jugendstil. His first and most notable work was the Wilhelmina Reck mansion in Skatertny Lane.Yakov Reck, head of construction company, commissioned many buildings in Moscow. As a result, there are at least five Reck Mansions The building is loosely modeled after the Elvira Studio by August Endell (1896, destroyed 1944); instead of Endell’s marine motifs, Fomin decorated his work with plaster flowers and majolica inserts. The same floral motifs were used in the iron gates. The building still stands, albeit rebuilt beyond recognition. Fomin continued working for the Reck family, who sponsored Art Nouveau. In 1902-1903, he organized the \\"Exhibition of Art and Architecture of New Style\\", showcasing his works in interior design. Fomin contracted top-level furniture makers, foundries and ceramic plants for his own designs, but also displayed works by guests like Charles Rennie Mackintosh, Joseph Maria Olbrich, Koloman Moser and Russian artists. Fomin established himself as a promoter of Art Nouveau. However, his attempts to forge the new Architectural Society failed. In 1902, he set up the Construction College in Moscow, with a separate class for women. Neoclassicism (1903-1917) Novy Peterburg, perspective plan, 1912 Novy Peterburg, completed building, 1914 Fomin acquired a solid reputation, but did not have an architect’s license yet. He returned to St.Petersburg in 1905 and completed Leon Benois' course at the Academy of Arts in 1909, winning a one- year study tour to Greece, Egypt and Italy. At this time, Neoclassical Revival became the leading style in St. Petersburg, and the most technologically advanced. Banks and department stores, who favored the style, could afford a steel frame and concrete slab floors. A combination of money and technology allowed the mix of classical columns and arches with large glass surfaces.\\"Commerce in Russian Urban Culture 1861-1914\\", ed. William C. Brumfield, The Woodrow Wilson Center Press, ch.8,9,10 ; Russian edition: . Online illustrated Russian version www.cultinfo.ru Fomin's turn to Neoclassicism is traced to 1903, when he applied to the contest for Count Volkonsky estate with a neoclassical draft. In 1904, Fomin published his Revival Manifesto in Mir Iskusstva magazine, pledging to architectural legacy of Catherine and Alexander I. \\"These days, everyone wants to be individual, to invent his own, and in the end we cannot see neither a dominant style, nor a trace of those who can eventually create it\\". Fomin believed in a universal idea uniting everyone, and in an architectural style that could serve it. He promoted the Academy's exhibitions in \\"History of Russian Art\\" (1909) and \\"History of Architecture\\" (1911), as vigorously as he did his Art Nouveau shows. Fomin was an outspoken advocate for building preservation, leading a campaign against the conversion of historical mansions into rental apartment buildings.Russian: Т.А.Славина. \\"О трех петербургских владениях графов Строгановых\\", www.slavina-ltd.ru Fomin completed numerous interior renovations,Russian: Anna Starostina, \\"Pre-revolutionary interiors by Ivan Fomin\\" www.archi.ru and two new buildings (Polovtsov mansion,Russian: Anna Starostina, \\"Polovtsov Mansion\\", photo gallery www.archi.ru English: Jason Grant, \\"Polovtsov Dacha\\", history of the building www.nostalgicglass.org and Abamelek-Lazarev mansionRussian: Anna Starostina, \\"Abamelek Mansion\\", photo gallery www.archi.ru ). His greatest urban projects of this time, interrupted by the outbreak of World War I, didn’t materialize in full. Novy Peterburg (Goloday Island development) was a huge Palladian fantasy. In 1911 a British investment company led by Riccardo Gualino, launched a development project on a 1 square kilometer lot in the western Goloday Island, awarding general planning to Fomin. Building design was split between Fomin and Fyodor Lidval. Fomin wanted to recreate the monumental imperial classics in a middle class community. Only a fraction of his plan materialized before World War I. One building, a school on Kakhovsky Street, stands today. Revolutionary years (1918-1926) In 1918, Fyodor Lidval left for Sweden. Fomin stayed in St. Petersburg. The Russian Civil War stopped all new construction; the few architectural jobs concentrated in monumental propaganda and city planning. Fomin managed to secure the chair of Petrograd (St.Petersburg) Zoning commission, and designed the Field of Mars landscape (1920–1923). Fomin trained a new generation of architects at VKhUTEMAS/VKhuTEIN, at the same time developing his own concept of proletarian classicism. He asserted that a universal architecture must borrow essential principles from classicism, but the details of classicism are not important. As a result, the new architectural order can be simplified to a laconic set of basic elements, not bound by strict proportions. In practice, like all theories, it worked for good architects (like Fomin himself) but could not help mediocre imitators. The last ten years (1926-1936) Narkomtiazhprom contest entry, 1934 Kursky rail terminal contest entry, 1933 Kursky rail terminal, main concourse - contest entry, 1933 Ministry of Railways (Tank Engine Building) was Fomin's experiment with constructivist architecture, 1930 In 1929, Fomin relocated to Moscow. There, he completed the Dynamo building,Dynamo sports club was operated by NKVD. Dynamo building stands next to NKVD headquarters on Lubyanka an experiment halfway between modern art and his own neoclassicism. The building, using steel frame and concrete slab floors, looks like an industrial object, but the paired columns, Fomin's trademark, give away its classical origin. In 1933, when all Moscow architects were assigned to 20 Mossovet workshops, Fomin is appointed to lead Design Workshop No.3. Here, he designed his three last projects (two will be completed after his death). According to Selim Khan-Magomedov, Fomin was one of the two forerunners of so-called postconstructivism, an early stage of Stalinist architecture (the other was Ilya Golosov). Postconstructivism is defined as classical shapes without classical details, an attempt to reinvent new styling to replace classical order. Fomin eventually disposed with it in favor of true neoclassicism (as did all Stalinist architecture).Russian: Russian: С.О.Хан-Магометов. «Архитектура Советского авангарда».Т1. Москва. Стройиздат. 1996 (S.O. Khan- Magomedov, \\"Soviet avantgarde architecture\\", 1996) Fomin took part in all of the major architectural contests of his time: *1932-34 Kursky Rail Terminal *1932-33 Palace of Soviets *1934 Narkomtiazhprom *1934 Moscow Metro first stage. He did win and completed one of the Metro jobs. Palace of Soviets was won by Boris Iofan, construction began with enormous publicity but was terminated by German attack of 1941. His other two contests did not get beyond concept drafts. Unlike Ivan Zholtovsky, who abstained from the lowly work on subway stations, Fomin eagerly joined the contest for the Metro. He competed on the Krasniye Vorota (Red Gates) against former constructivist Ilya Golosov, whose entry appeared to be a true Doric Greek classic. Unfortunately for Golosov, extremely hard geological conditions required heavy, wide support pylons. His otherwise fine draft was not feasible for 1935 technology, giving way to Fomin's simple red granite design - a tribute to the old Red Gates, demolished in 1932. This station opened to public in 1935, while Fomin was alive. He designed one more station, Teatralnaya (then Ploschad Sverdlova), which was completed two years after his death. His last project on the ground, Government of Ukraine building in Kiev, was approved for construction in 1934. This 10-story building, the earliest example of true Stalin's Empire Style, was hailed as the way to build and spawned numerous imitations. A peculiar feature is the quilt-like ornament on the columns. Fomin knew very well that a 25-meter bare column will look unnatural; the quilt warms up an otherwise dull shape. Column capitals also differ from their Corynthian prototypes: at this height, he reasoned, fine Greek details would be lost, so he simplified and enlarged leaves of his ornament. Legacy Fomin died of a sudden stroke English: \\"A Vanishing Legacy\\", Joy Ziegeweid, 25.08.2006, The Moscow Times in 1936 and was interred at Novodevichye Cemetery; Teatralnaya and Government of Ukraine were completed by other architects. After World War II, the Government of Ukraine building became a staple of Soviet textbooks on architecture, a model of Stalin's Empire. Fomin's son, Igor Ivanovich Fomin (born 1904) also became an architect, working primarily in Saint Petersburg. A constructivist in his twenties, he later completed various Stalinist projects like Schemilovka residential district and Ploschad Vosstania metro station. Similarity of initials (I.I. Fomin vs. I.A. Fomin) frequently confuses journalists. Fomin's Moscow studio and museum (at the back alley of Prospect Mira, 52, where he had lived in apartment 43) was slated for demolition by the City of Moscow in summer of 2006; preservationists are struggling to save the memorial building.English: \\"Under Threat\\", 2006-07-12, Moscow Architecture Preservation Society Buildings Government of Ukraine, Kiev House of Prince S.

CTCF is involved in many cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, insulator activity, V(D)J recombination and regulation of chromatin architecture.  Discovery  CCCTC-Binding factor or CTCF was initially discovered as a negative regulator of the chicken c-myc gene. This protein was found to be binding to three regularly spaced repeats of the core sequence CCCTC and thus was named CCCTC binding factor.  Function  The primary role of CTCF is thought to be in regulating the 3D structure of chromatin. CTCF binds together strands of DNA, thus forming chromatin loops, and anchors DNA to cellular structures like the nuclear lamina. It also defines the boundaries between active and heterochromatic DNA. Since the 3D structure of DNA influences the regulation of genes, CTCF's activity influences the expression of genes. CTCF is thought to be a primary part of the activity of insulators, sequences that block the interaction between enhancers and promoters. CTCF binding has also been both shown to promote and repress gene expression. It is unknown whether CTCF affects gene expression solely through its looping activity, or if it has some other, unknown, activity.  Observed activity  The binding of CTCF has been shown to have many effects, which are enumerated below. In each case, it is unknown if CTCF directly evokes the outcome or if it does so indirectly (in particular through its looping role). = Transcriptional regulation = The protein CTCF plays a heavy role in repressing the insulin-like growth factor 2 gene, by binding to the H-19 imprinting control region (ICR) along with differentially-methylated region-1 (DMR1) and MAR3. =Insulation= Binding of targeting sequence elements by CTCF can block the interaction between enhancers and promoters, therefore limiting the activity of enhancers to certain functional domains. Besides acting as enhancer blocking, CTCF can also act as a chromatin barrier by preventing the spread of heterochromatin structures. =Regulation of chromatin architecture= CTCF physically binds to itself to form homodimers, which causes the bound DNA to form loops. CTCF also occurs frequently at the boundaries of sections of DNA bound to the nuclear lamina. Using chromatin immuno-precipitation (ChIP) followed by ChIP-seq, it was found that CTCF localizes with cohesin genome-wide and affects gene regulatory mechanisms and the higher-order chromatin structure. It is currently believed that the DNA loops are formed by the \\"loop extrusion\\" mechanism, whereby the cohesin ring is actively being translocated along the DNA until it meets CTCF. CTCF has to be in a proper orientation to stop cohesin. =Regulation of RNA splicing= CTCF binding has been shown to influence mRNA splicing. DNA binding CTCF binds to the consensus sequence CCGCGNGGNGGCAG (in IUPAC notation). This sequence is defined by 11 zinc finger motifs in its structure. CTCF's binding is disrupted by CpG methylation of the DNA it binds to. On the other hand, CTCF binding may set boundaries for the spreading of DNA methylation. CTCF binds to an average of about 55,000 DNA sites in 19 diverse cell types (12 normal and 7 immortal) and in total 77,811 distinct binding sites across all 19 cell types. CTCF’s ability to bind to multiple sequences through the usage of various combinations of its zinc fingers earned it the status of a “multivalent protein”. More than 30,000 CTCF binding sites have been characterized. The human genome contains anywhere between 15,000-40,000 CTCF binding sites depending on cell type, suggesting a widespread role for CTCF in gene regulation. In addition CTCF binding sites act as nucleosome positioning anchors so that, when used to align various genomic signals, multiple flanking nucleosomes can be readily identified. On the other hand, high-resolution nucleosome mapping studies have demonstrated that the differences of CTCF binding between cell types may be attributed to the differences in nucleosome locations. Methylation loss at CTCF-binding site of some genes has been found to be related to human diseases, including male infertility. Protein-protein interactions CTCF binds to itself to form homodimers. CTCF has also been shown to interact with Y box binding protein 1. CTCF also co-localizes with cohesin, which extrudes chromatin loops by actively translocating one or two DNA strands through its ring-shaped structure, until it meets CTCF in a proper orientation. CTCF is also known to interact with chromatin remodellers such as Chd4 and Snf2h.

National team coaching =Assistant stints with the junior national team= In 1976, thirty-two-year-old Ivković was brought in as assistant coach of the Yugoslav under-18 (junior) national team by its newly appointed head coach Luka Stančić. At the 1976 European Championship for Juniors in Santiago de Compostela, the team featuring youngsters Aco Petrović, Miško Marić, and Predrag Bogosavljev won gold. Two years later at the 1978 European Championship for Juniors in Roseto degli Abruzzi, the Stančić-Ivković duo was back again to lead a new batch of Yugoslav under-18 junior prospects featuring Petar Popović, Bogosavljev, and Ivan Sunara. The team won bronze this time. Ivković got hired to be KK Partizan's head coach a few weeks after the championship, his first top-level head coaching job. In 1980, Ivković, who by now had a bit of a head coaching resume behind him and was about to sign for Greek League runners-up Aris, still agreed to assist Stančić again at the 1980 European Championship for Juniors held at home in Celje. With a roster featuring Goran Grbović, Zoran Čutura, Branko Vukičević, and Žarko Đurišić, the team got silver after losing to the Soviets in the final. =Head coach= In summer 1983, Ivković coached the Yugoslavian team featuring 18-year-old Dražen Petrović at the Universiade in Edmonton, getting silver after losing to Canada in the final. Four years later, barely three weeks after assisting Krešimir Ćosić at EuroBasket 1987, Ivković got to coach Yugoslavia again at the Universiade, this time at home in Zagreb. The team, featuring now 22-year-old European superstar Petrović, won gold in dominant fashion. Also in 1987, Ivković succeeded Ćosić as head coach of the senior Yugoslavian national basketball team, and held the post until the breakup of Yugoslavia, in 1991. Ivković then assumed the head coaching position of the senior FR Yugoslavia. He guided the team to a gold medal at EuroBasket 1995, in the country's first official appearance since the UN lifted sanctions against FR Yugoslavia. Following EuroBasket, Željko Obradović took over as head coach, while Ivković assumed the role of team manager. Both Obradović and Ivković remained in their posts until jointly resigning in November 2000, following a 6th-place finish in the 2000 Summer Olympics.Ivković i Obradović podneli ostavke.

With three other trade associations, it is represented on the UK government's Strategic Forum for Construction through the Construction Alliance. History It was founded in 1896. Structure A non-profit organisation, the National Federation of Builders (NFB) is an independent federation which supplies business and training services to builders, constructors, contractors and house builders across England and Wales. Its website provides a public list of NFB-approved builders and a find a builder service. The NFB includes the House Builders Association (HBA), NFB Heritage, the Major Contractors Group (MCG) and NFB Cymru. The organisation has three main departments looking after member concerns; training, policy and membership services. Membership is split into eight regions; Southern, South West, Eastern, Midlands, North East, North West, London and Wales. NFB members are eligible for offers, discounted products and services through Associate members and advice lines. Policy The NFB policy team is split into construction and housebuilding, allowing it to campaign on different agendas. = Construction = After a long campaign, the NFB was instrumental in the implementation of the prompt payment code, which checks when large business pays their suppliers. Working alongside Peter Aldous, the NFB lobbied for retentions to be put into trust, meaning if there are any insolvencies in the supply chain, those who are owed money are insulted from any losses. = Housebuilding = The British Governments housing white paper, titled, 'Fixing the broken housing market' had a heavy focus on 'diversifying the housing market' and was largely influenced by the HBA, who has been lobbying the Government to understand the negative impact of housing policy on small and medium sized housebuilders (SMEs) over the last twenty years, which saw 80% of SMEs leaving the industry in the last thirty years. The Government has been persuaded to do more to help SMEs, who train four in five construction apprentices and are the predominant rural employers by improving housing site allocations in local plans. The HBA secured policy in the housing white paper update, that meant at least 10% of the sites allocated for residential development in local plans should be on sites of 0.5 hectare or less. This is in addition to the windfall allowance. The HBA had initially asked for this percentage to be 30%, after 20% was proposed; however, this was downgraded after push back from local authorities. Previous collaborations with Natural England on their district licensing for the Great Crested Newt proved that there was an appetite and ability for the construction industry to support conservation while improving the planning process. The HBA therefore became involved on writing guidance and setting metrics for biodiversity net gain, which leaves the environment in a better state than when development began. As the only building trade association who rejected exemptions for small sites, the HBA is certain that the policy can be a springboard to both protect the environment and establish a new conservation and biodiversity industry. Work on ongoing for net gain, which will be mandated sometimes in 2019.

The related process of the scattering of light by light, also a consequence of vacuum polarization, was not observed until 1998. In both cases, it is a process described by quantum electrodynamics. Image:Delbruck scattering.svgThe Feynman diagram of Delbrück scattering. The wavy line represents a photon and the double line an electron in the external field of a nucleus. Image:Delbruke scattering lowest.svgThe lowest order diagram has four vertices and consists of two incoming photons, which annihilate into a virtual electron-positron pair, which then annihilates into two real photons again.  Discovery  From 1932 to 1937, Max Delbrück worked in Berlin as an assistant to Lise Meitner, who was collaborating with Otto Hahn on the results of irradiating uranium with neutrons. During this period he wrote a few papers, one of which turned out to be an important contribution on the scattering of gamma rays by a Coulomb field due to polarization of the vacuum produced by that field (1933). His conclusion proved to be theoretically sound but inapplicable to the case in point, but 20 years later Hans Bethe confirmed the phenomenon and named it \\"Delbrück scattering\\".Biographical Memoirs: Volume 62 pp66-117 \\"MAX LUDWIG HENNING DELBRÜCK 4 September 1906 - 10 March 1981\\" BY WILLIAM HAYES http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=2201&page;=66 In 1953, Robert Wilson observed Delbrück scattering of 1.33 MeV gamma-rays by the electric fields of lead nuclei. Addendum: Delbrück scattering is the coherent elastic scattering of photons in the Coulomb field of heavy nuclei. It is one of the two nonlinear effects of quantum electrodynamics (QED) in the Coulomb field investigated experimentally. The other is the splitting of a photon into two photons. Delbrück scattering was introduced by Max Delbrück in order to explain discrepancies between experimental and predicted data in a Compton scattering experiment on heavy atoms carried out by Meitner and Kösters.(with a comment of M. Delbrück) Delbrück’s arguments were based on the relativistic quantum mechanics of Dirac according to which the QED vacuum is filled with electrons of negative energy or - in modern terms – with electron-positron pairs. These electrons of negative energy should be capable of producing coherent-elastic photon scattering because the recoil momentum during absorption and emission of the photon is transferred to the total atom while the electrons remain in their state of negative energy. This process is the analog of atomic Rayleigh scattering with the only difference that in the latter case the electrons are bound in the electron cloud of the atom. The experiment of Meitner and Kösters was the first in a series of experiments where the discrepancy between experimental and predicted differential cross sections for elastic scattering by heavy atoms were interpreted in terms of Delbrück scattering. From the present point of view these early results are not trustworthy. Reliable investigations were possible only after modern QED techniques based on Feynman diagrams were available for quantitative predictions, and on the experimental side photon detectors with high energy resolution and high detection efficiency had been developed. This was the case at the beginning of the 1970s when also computers with high computing capacity were in operation which delivered numerical results for Delbrück scattering amplitudes with sufficient precision. A first observation of Delbrück scattering was achieved in a high-energy, small-angle photon scattering experiment carried out at DESY (Germany) in 1973, where only the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is of importance. Agreement was obtained with predictions of Cheng Wu which later were verified by Milstein and Strakhovenko. These latter authors make use of the quasi-classical approximation being very different from the one of Cheng and Wu. It could however be shown that both approximations are equivalent and lead to the same numerical results. The essential breakthrough came with the Göttingen (Germany) experiment in 1975 carried out at an energy of 2.754 MeV. In the Göttingen experiment Delbrück scattering was observed as the dominant contribution to the coherent-elastic scattering process, in addition to minor contributions stemming from atomic Rayleigh scattering and nuclear Rayleigh scattering. This experiment was the first where exact predictions based on Feynman diagrams, were confirmed with high precision and, therefore, has to be considered as the first definite observation of Delbrück scattering. For a comprehensive description of the present status of Delbrück scattering see. Nowadays, the most accurate measurements of high-energy Delbrück scattering are performed at the Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics (BINP) in Novosibirsk (Russia). The experiment where photon splitting was really observed for the first time was also performed at the BINP. Clarification: There are a number of experimental works published previously to the 1975 Göttingen experiment (or even to the Desy 1973 one). Most notable Jackson and Wetzel in 1969 and Moreh and Kahane in 1973. In both these works use was made of higher energy gamma rays compared with the Göttingen one, conferring a higher contribution of the Delbrück scattering to the overall measured cross section. In general, in the low energy nuclear physics region i.e. < 10-20 MeV, a Delbrück experiment measures a number of competing coherent processes including also Rayleigh scattering from electrons, Thomson scattering from the point nucleus and nuclear excitation via the Giant Dipole Resonance. Apart from the Thomson scattering which is well known, the other two (namely Rayleigh and GDR) have considerable uncertainties. The interference of these effects with Delbrück is by no means \\"minor\\" (again \\"at classical nuclear physics energies\\"). Even at very forward scattering angles, where Delbrück is very strong, there is a substantial interference with the Rayleigh scattering, the amplitudes of both effects being of the same order of magnitude (see ).

One particular advantage of some algebraic modeling languages like AIMMS, AMPL, GAMS, MathProg, Mosel, and OPL is the similarity of their syntax to the mathematical notation of optimization problems. This allows for a very concise and readable definition of problems in the domain of optimization, which is supported by certain language elements like sets, indices, algebraic expressions, powerful sparse index and data handling variables, constraints with arbitrary names. The algebraic formulation of a model does not contain any hints how to process it. An AML does not solve those problems directly; instead, it calls appropriate external algorithms to obtain a solution. These algorithms are called solvers and can handle certain kind of mathematical problems like: * linear problems * integer problems * (mixed integer) quadratic problems * mixed complementarity problems * mathematical programs with equilibrium constraints * constrained nonlinear systems * general nonlinear problems * non-linear programs with discontinuous derivatives * nonlinear integer problems * global optimization problems * stochastic optimization problems  Core elements  The core elements of an AML are: * a modeling language interpreter (the AML itself) * solver links * user interfaces (UI) * data exchange facilities  Design principles  Most AML follow certain design principles: * a balanced mix of declarative and procedural elements * open architecture and interfaces to other systems * different layers with separation of: ** model and data ** model and solution methods ** model and operating system ** model and interface = Data driven model generation = Most modelling languages exploit the similarities between structured models and relational databases by providing a database access layer, which enables the modelling system to directly access data from external data sources (e.g. these Database and spreadsheet table handlers for AMPLtable handlers for AMPL). With the refinement of analytic technologies applied to business processes, optimisation models are becoming an integral part of decision support systems; optimisation models can be structured and layered to represent and support complex business processes. In such applications, the multi-dimensional data structure typical of OLAP systems can be directly mapped to the optimisation models and typical MDDB operations can be translated into aggregation and disaggregation operations on the underlying model History Algebraic modelling languages find their roots in matrix- generator and report-writer programs (MGRW), developed in the late seventies. Some of these are MAGEN, MGRW (IBM), GAMMA.3, DATAFORM and MGG/RWG. These systems simplified the communication of problem instances to the solution algorithms and the generation of a readable report of the results. An early matrix-generator for LP was developed around 1969 at the Mathematisch Centrum (now CWI), Amsterdam.Jac. M. Anthonisse, An input system for linear programming problems, Statistica Neerlandica 24 (1970), 143-153. Its syntax was very close to the usual mathematical notation, using subscripts en sigmas. Input for the generator consisted of separate sections for the model and the data. It found users at universities and in industry. The main industrial user was the steel maker Hoogovens (now Tata Steel) where it was used for nearly 25 years. A big step towards the modern modelling languages is found in UIMP , where the structure of the mathematical programming models taken from real life is analysed for the first time, to highlight the natural grouping of variables and constraints arising from such models. This led to data-structure features, which supported structured modelling; in this paradigm, all the input and output tables, together with the decision variables, are defined in terms of these structures, in a way comparable to the use of subscripts and sets. This is probably the single most notable feature common to all modern AMLs and enabled, in time, a separation between the model structure and its data, and a correspondence between the entities in an MP model and data in relational databases. So, a model could be finally instantiated and solved over different datasets, just by modifying its datasets. The correspondence between modelling entities and relational data models, made then possible to seamlessly generate model instances by fetching data from corporate databases. This feature accounts now for a lot of the usability of optimisation in real life applications, and is supported by most well-known modelling languages.

It is filmed almost entirely from the physical points-of-view of the characters, and viewers can hear the interior monologues of Mark and Jez. At the beginning of the series, Mark is attracted to his colleague Sophie (Olivia Colman), and Jez tries to break through into the music business. As the series progresses, it becomes clear that Jez is unlikely to be successful. Jez falls in love with Nancy (Rachel Blanchard), an American Christian, and they marry to get her a visa. She leaves him and Jez later has relationships with Michelle, Elena and Zahra. Mark begins to question his love for Sophie. They also marry, though Mark does not want to, and Sophie leaves him right after the wedding ceremony. Months later, they have sex once; the condom breaks and Sophie discovers she is pregnant. Sophie does not know if he, Jez or Jeff is the father. A DNA test reveals Mark to be the father, and the estranged couple have a son.

Plants of Chungtia  Chungtia villagers of Nagaland, India, have a strong reliance on plants as medicines. Previous studies have shown that 31 Chungtia medicinal plants (and parts therein) used customarily for skin related treatments possess antimicrobial properties against skin pathogens, strongly supporting the use of these plants by the Chungtia villagers. Five plants, namely Albizia lucidior, Begonia picta, Cassia floribunda, Holboellia latifolia, and Maesa indica have no previous studies on their antimicrobial properties, while Prunus persica has only antimicrobial activity reported on its fruit, with no reports on its roots, which are used by the Chungtia villagers. These six plants for their antimicrobial properties against dermatologically relevant pathogens and undertake phytochemical analysis of the most active species, Prunus persica.Fitzgerald‐Hughes, Deirdre, Marc Devocelle, and Hilary Humphreys. \\"Beyond Conventional Antibiotics for the Future Treatment of Methicillin‐Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus Infections: Two Novel Alternatives.\\" FEMS Immunology & Medical Microbiology 65, no. 3 (2012): 399-412. The presence of pathogenic bacteria and fungi can cause skin infections and exacerbate the healing of and seriousness of sores and wounds. Skin disease and infections cause a significant global disease burden, and with the escalating occurrence of multidrug resistant microorganisms, there is heightened concern that the rates of skin infections will only worsen.Belhadj, Feten, Imen Somrani, Neyssene Aissaoui, Chokri Messaoud, Mohamed Boussaid, and M Nejib Marzouki. \\"Bioactive Compounds Contents, Antioxidant and Antimicrobial Activities During Ripening of Prunus Persica L. Varieties from the North West of Tunisia.\\" Food Chemistry 204 (2016): 29-36. Much research effort is therefore being focused on identifying new antimicrobial compounds, including those isolated from nature. Since the introduction of conventional antibiotics in the 1950s, there has been little use of plant derivatives as antimicrobials. However, interest in using phytochemicals (products from secondary plant metabolism) for the treatment of microbial infections has increased from the late 1990s following the poor efficacy of conventional antibiotics, due in part to their often excessive and inappropriate use in mammalian infections.Valgas, Cleidson, Simone Machado de Souza, Elza FA Smânia, and Artur Smânia Jr. \\"Screening Methods to Determine Antibacterial Activity of Natural Products.\\" Brazilian Journal of Microbiology 38, no. 2 (2007): 369-80. The Chungtia villagers have developed a wealth of knowledge on medicinal flora over many generations. An ethnobotanical study documented 37 medicinal plants used by Chungtia villagers for the treatment of skin related ailments consistent with a microbial aetiology.Soković, Marina, Jasmina Glamočlija, Petar D Marin, Dejan Brkić, and Leo JLD van Griensven. \\"Antibacterial Effects of the Essential Oils of Commonly Consumed Medicinal Herbs Using an in Vitro Model.\\" Molecules 15, no. 11 (2010): 7532-46. =Selection of plants for antimicrobial testing= Previously reported the customary uses by Chungtia villagers of 38 plants for the topical treatment of skin related ailments of a likely microbial aetiology. Following an extensive literature review on the antimicrobial activities and antimicrobially active extracts/chemical constituents of these plants, it was found that extracts from 21 of the plants, including relevant plant parts used by the Chungtia villagers, have previously been analysed for their antimicrobial properties, 12 were reported for possessing antimicrobial activity in a different plant part and compounds with antimicrobial activities have been isolated from fourteen of them.Edwards, Ruth, and Keith G Harding. \\"Bacteria and Wound Healing.\\" Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases 17, no. 2 (2004): 91-96. These findings strongly support the customary uses of these plants by the Chungtia villagers. Five Chungtia plants, namely Albizia lucidior, Begonia picta, Cassia floribunda, Holboellia latifolia, and Maesa indica have no prior studies on their antimicrobial properties, while only fruit of Prunus persica have been previously studied for antimicrobial activity, with no reports on the roots used by the Chungtia villagers. These six plants were therefore selected for antimicrobial studies.Das, K, RKS Tiwari, and DK Shrivastava. \\"Techniques for Evaluation of Medicinal Plant Products as Antimicrobial Agent: Current Methods and Future Trends.\\" Journal of Medicinal Plants Research 4, no. 2 (2010): 104-11. While all the tested plant extracts showed activity against at least two microorganisms in the MTT microdilution assay, only the P. persica extract was active when tested using the disc diffusion method. The discrepancy in results between these two methods is not uncommon. While the disc diffusion assay is a commonly used method for the antimicrobial screening of medicinal plants, the activity measured as the zone of inhibition is influenced by numerous factors including the size and polarity of the compounds present. Moreover, filter paper discs, which are commonly used and were utilised in this study, can also influence results. Paper discs are composed of cellulose, which possesses many free hydroxyl groups which render the surface of the discs hydrophilic.Cowan, Marjorie Murphy. \\"Plant Products as Antimicrobial Agents.\\" Clinical microbiology reviews 12, no. 4 (1999): 564-82. Therefore, polar compounds can adsorb to the surface of the discs and not diffuse into the medium. As a consequence, some polar compounds that possess antimicrobial activity may not show a zone of inhibition in the disc diffusion assay. Non-polar compounds would not be influenced by the hydroxyls on the surface of the paper, but because of their hydrophobic nature may not diffuse through the aqueous medium resulting in false negatives. Large molecules also often diffuse poorly. Thus, some antimicrobial compounds may not be identified using a disc diffusion assay. On the other hand, the accuracy of the MTT microdilution assay can be compromised by samples that are coloured (such as plant extracts), redox active and/or samples that are not soluble in the medium, which is predominantly aqueous. Although more toxic solvents such as methanol or acetone can be used for water-insoluble compounds (no more that 2% final concentration), DMSO is a popular alternative due to its comparatively lower toxicity. Regardless of the solvent used, some of the compounds might still precipitate which will reduce interaction between the sample tested and the bacteria and as a result limit the sample activity. Therefore, a combination of the disc diffusion assay with at least one other assay is often preferred for screening.Tan, Joash Ban Lee, and Yau Yan Lim. \\"Critical Analysis of Current Methods for Assessing the in Vitro Antioxidant and Antibacterial Activity of Plant Extracts.\\" Food chemistry 172 (2015): 814-22. =Isolation and antimicrobial activity of extracts and compounds of P. persica= As the extract of the roots of P. persica demonstrated good activity in both the disc diffusion and MTT microdilution assays, it was selected for further chemical analyses. The Chungtia villagers consume the liquid from fresh roots of P. persica soaked in water to treat typhoid and the seed endosperm is eaten to treat dysentery and diarrhoea. The liquid from the roots and aqueous decoctions of the leaves are also used to treat skin related infections. Except for the roots, all plant parts from this species have been reported for various pharmacological properties, such as antioxidant, anti- inflammatory activities, and hepato- and cardio-protective properties. To the best of our knowledge, the only antibacterial activity reported of this species is for the roots.Soković, Marina, Jasmina Glamočlija, Petar D Marin, Dejan Brkić, and Leo JLD van Griensven. \\"Antibacterial Effects of the Essential Oils of Commonly Consumed Medicinal Herbs Using an in Vitro Model.\\" Molecules 15, no. 11 (2010): 7532-46. Antimicrobial screening of Chungtia medicinal plants used customarily for skin related ailments, i.e. Albizia lucidior (roots), Begonia picta (leaves), Cassia floribunda (leaves), Holboellia latifolia (leaves), Maesa indica (leaves) and Prunus persica (roots) against dermatologically relevant microorganisms showed that all of the plants possess various levels of antibacterial activity. This supports the customary use of these species. Investigation of the n-hexane and EtOAc fractions of the root extract of P. persica using bioassay-guided isolation techniques led to the isolation of ent-epiafzelechin-(2α→O→7’,4α→8’)-(-)ent- afzelechin (1, S. aureus MIC 156 µg/mL, MRSA and MDRSA MIC 312 µg/mL, E. coli β-, S. typhimurium and P. aeruginosa MIC 2500 µg/mL), afzelechin (2, not active), α-cyanobenzyl benzoate (3, S. aureus, MDRSA and MRSA 78 µg/mL, E. coli β- MIC 312 µg/mL and P. aeruginosa MIC 625 µg/mL), β-sitosterol (4, S. aureus, MDRSA, MRSA and E. coli β- MIC 2500 µg/mL, S. typhimurium MIC 625 µg/mL, P. aeruginosa MIC 1250 µg/mL) and stigmast-4-en-3-one (5, S. aureus, MDRSA and MRSA MIC 156 µg/mL, E. coli β- MIC 312, S. typhimurium MIC 625 µg/mL and P. aeruginosa MIC 1250 µg/mL). Very good antimicrobial activity of the isolated compounds 1 and 3 and good activity of compound 4 against a range of dermatologically relevant bacteria supports the traditional application of this plant to treat skin related ailments. This is the first report of the isolated compounds 1 and 3 possessing antimicrobial activities as well as the first report of ent-epiafzelechin-(2α→O→7’,4α→8’)-(-)ent-afzelechin and α-cyanobenzyl benzoate being isolated from genus Prunus.

The Aprilia RS250 features a race oriented motorcycle with technology derived from Aprilia's racing experience. It is inspired by the Aprilia RSW250 Grand Prix motorcycle used by riders such as Valentino Rossi, Max Biaggi and Loris Capirossi in MotoGP races. History The RS250 was designed by Aprilia to resemble their GP250 bike to celebrate their success in the championship. The Aprilia RS250 is powered by a modified Suzuki RGV250 (VJ22) engine which is prepared by Aprilia, changes include a revised ECU, Aprilia-designed expansion chambers, barrels and airbox. The twin 34 mm flat slide Mikuni carburettors are retained from the RGV. Chassis The frame is a cast twin spar aluminium/magnesium alloy with thin-walled monocoque reinforcements, with the engine as a fully stressed member manufactured by Benelli for Aprilia. The banana swingarm is made out of the same polished aluminium alloy as the rest of the frame. The reason for the swingarm's banana shape is to allow the expansion chambers to run unobstructed under the engine to improve ground clearance in turns. The forks are 41 mm Showa (on the MY98+ models) inverted units and are adjustable compression and rebound, the rear suspension is a Sachs mono-shock which is adjustable for preload, compression and rebound. The front brakes of the RS 250 are Brembo dual 298 mm discs with Brembo Oro four-piston calipers. The rear brake is a single 220 mm disc with a Brembo twin-piston caliper. The front & rear rims are lightweight, 5 spokes, cast aluminum rims are 3.50x17 up front (3.0x17 on the older models) and 4.50x17 out back that require tires of 120/60x17 and 150/60x17, respectively.

It will display maximum and average speed readings in kilometers or miles per hour, an adjustable rev limiter warning zone indicator, water temperature in choice of scale, battery charge indicator, a clock, and a chronometer that can remember up to 40 lap times. Revision In 1998, Aprilia released an all new look for the RS250, also referred to as RS250GP1 to celebrate Aprilia's victory in the 250 cc GP racing class. Its appearance is similar to Marco Melandri's RSWGP250 bike, with the same engine and frame as the pre-1998 model. The bike has a dummy ram-air intake. Changes include: *Revised overall bike styling with more modern senses. *New Showa front forks and adjustable rear ride height *New style instrument panel with new functionality. * New rims and tyres: the front rim is now a 3.5x17, instead of 3.0x17 as used on pre-1998 model.

The books are written in the style of a diary. Each book sees her trying to solve a mystery of the royal court. The stories are set in 1569 and 1570, and there are twelve books so far; Assassin, Betrayal, Conspiracy, Deception, Exile, Feud, Gold, Haunted, Intrigue, Jinx, Keys, and Loot. The first book, Assassin, was published in 2004.  Authors  The first three books, Assassin, Betrayal, Conspiracy, and the later Feud, were written by Patricia Finney, and the other books are co-written by Sara Volger and Jan Burchett. All authors write under the pseudonym \\"Grace Cavendish\\". Series The series is written in alphabetical order, leading to hopes that there would be another 14 (M–Z); however, none have been published for the past 8 years. * Assassin by Patricia Finney, Doubleday, 2004, * Betrayal by Patricia Finney, Doubleday, 2004, * Conspiracy by Patricia Finney, 2005 * Deception by Sara Volger & Jan Burchett, 2005 * Exile by Sara Vogler & Jan Burchett, 2006 * Feud by Patricia Finney, 2006 * Gold by Sara Vogler & Jan Burchett, 2006 * Haunted by Sara Vogler & Jan Burchett, 2006 * Intrigue by Sara Vogler & Jan Burchett, 2008 * Jinx by Sara Vogler & Jan Burchett, 2008 * Keys by Sara Vogler & Jan Burchett, 2009 * Loot by Sara Vogler & Jan Burchett, 2010 Characters There are a number of recurring characters who appear in all the books. The main characters are Lady Grace Cavendish and Queen Elizabeth the First. =Lady Grace Cavendish, Maid of Honour= Lady Grace Cavendish is the youngest Maid of Honour to Queen Elizabeth I. In the first book, Assassin she is thirteen years old; by the eleventh, Keys, she is fifteen. She is the Queen's dearest goddaughter and rather a favourite with her at Court. She is an orphan like her friends Ellie and Masou. Both her parents, especially her mother, play memorial roles in all the books and both died heroic, tragic deaths. Her father died when she was two, fighting a war in France, and her mother unintentionally drank poison intended for the Queen, put there by the Papist Guises. Her best friends work at Whitehall Palace and follow the Queen on progress. Ellie Bunting, an orphaned laundry maid, and Masou Al-Ahmed, an African acrobat from Will Somer's acrobatic troupe, are both very close to Grace. However, they have to keep their friendship a secret due to the vast difference between their stations in life. The only time Grace mentions them is in her daybooke. Sharp and clever, Grace always solves a new mystery in a short deadline and is quietly rewarded by the Queen. Grace has to keep her investigations a secret, but she nearly always informs Masou and Ellie, and they are her trusty friends who help her with the investigations when she needs a companion and they sometimes try to do some of their own investigation in their spare time. She is always very discreet about her being the Queen's Lady Pursuivant and her adventures are closely guarded secrets. Grace never wants to get married as she wants to be like the Queen and stay at the Royal Court as long as she wishes to. However, in the 1st book (Assassin) she has three suitors, Lord Robert, Sir Gerald and her horse riding instructor Sir Charles. Fortunately, she does not have to marry one of them after a murder case when Sir Gerald is found dead with a knife in his back and Lord Robert is under suspicion. Ever since the death of her beloved mother, Lady Margaret Cavendish, all of the Maids of Honour, Ladies in Waiting and especially the Queen (who was very close to Grace's mother) has been kind to her and took her on as a Maid of Honour at the age of twelve. Unlike all the other Maids of Honour, Lady Grace loves to climb trees in orchards when she walks the dogs. In Whitehall, she mainly climbs a cherry tree that reminds her of her mother. When Grace walks the Queen's dogs, she always goes to visit her friends Masou and Ellie in a hideout. Every time the Queen wants to move to another Palace, Masou and Ellie find a little hideaway in the orchard to go in there in their spare time, when they are not helping Lady Grace solve a new mystery. The thing that Grace hates is when Ellie and Masou have to treat her like a Maid of Honour, and call her \\"mistress\\" and \\"lady\\". When Masou does, he performs elaborate bows. Grace states she always finds it hard not to laugh when he does. =Queen Elizabeth= Elizabeth I (7 September 1533 – 24 March 1603) was Queen of England and Ireland from 17 November 1558 until her death in early 1603. Sometimes called \\"The Virgin Queen\\", \\"Gloriana\\", or \\"Good Queen Bess\\", Elizabeth was the fifth and last monarch of the Tudor dynasty. Elizabeth was the daughter of King Henry VIII and Queen Anne Boleyn. Elizabeth was born a princess, but her mother, Anne Boleyn, was executed three years after her birth on false accusations of treason, heresy, witchcraft and infidelity, and through her mother's disgrace Elizabeth was declared illegitimate. In 1558 Elizabeth succeeded her half-sister, the devoutly Catholic Mary I of England, during whose reign she had been imprisoned for nearly a year on suspicion of supporting Protestant rebels. It was a difficult time for Elizabeth. She was known to take a diamond from her jewels and scratch into a Tower window the words, \\"Much suspected of me, nothing proved can be, quote Elizabeth, prisoner.\\" She was a very fond and helping godmother and guardian to Lady Grace, but whether or not that's true in real life nobody knows the truth. She was certainly a devoted and protective woman to her Ladies-in-Waiting and Maids of Honour. =Dr Cavendish= Dr Cavendish is Grace's loving uncle and the head physician at Court. He is a fond uncle of Grace and one of her only relatives. He is very upset by Grace's mother's death and for many years after the tragedy he is known to be lost in his own world. He is usually in one of two states – drunk or hung over. Despite all this he loves Grace very dearly and Grace is very fond of him and loves him a lot more than she realises. Dr Cavendish is always careful to upgrade Grace's physical state and regularly check her health standards. =Olwen and Fran= Olwen is Lady Sarah's tiring woman. She is kind and cheerful and comforts Lady Sarah when Sarah is upset. In Betrayal, Olwen is abducted, threatened, tied up, treated despicably, and used as hostage to lure Lady Sarah unwittingly into abduction too. Cruel Captain Derby, Olwen's captor, threatens to cut off Olwen's hands if Lady Sarah refuses to marry him, and throws her into the brig. Naturally, this is the cause of much distress for both Olwen and Lady Sarah. Fran is Mary Shelton's tiring woman. She is not mentioned much in the series and she also helps Lady Grace along with Olwen. =Penelope Knollys, Carmina Willoughby and Lucy Throckmorton= Penelope Knollys is one of Grace's fellow Maids of Honour. She follows the Queen on progress and shares a bedroom with Lady Jane Coningsby and Carmina Willoughby. Penelope always cowers away from the antics of Lady Sarah Bartelmy and Lady Jane Coningsby. Penelope is quite small and plain, and always follows Lady Sarah and her advice on clothes. In Book 7, Gold, Penelope gets married, thus leaving the Queen's service. Carmina is bright and bouncy. In Feud, she suffers from poisoning from Orpiment, given to her by Lady Horsely for revenge on her son's accidental death through jousting. Also, after the crisis of a fire at St Bartholemhew's Fair in Smith Field, Book 10, Jinx, she becomes very superstitious and jumpy, full of dire warnings. She is friends with Lucy Throckmorton and loves having a good chatter over a mystery, she and Lucy both share the love of gossip. Lucy Throckmorton is a terrible gossip. She appears to replace Penelope after her marriage and is not in all the books - considerably startles some readers by popping up suddenly in Book 10! Lucy is best friends with Carmina, gossips all the time and likes having long, boring, detailed conversations about sleeves and gowns in the latest styles. =Ellie Bunting= Ellie is a laundry maid at Queen Elizabeth's court, who later in the series (the book Haunted) becomes Lady Grace's tiring woman by way of reward for an act of bravery in defeating a villain in broad daylight, in front of the rest of the Court. She is very good friends with Grace and Masou and she often assists them in solving the hardest of mysteries. Ellie is very superstitious - in Jinx and Haunted she insists upon carting a massive bag of amulets around with her, even when sailing down the Thames and walking the dogs through muddy fields! She is very considerate, as looks are concerned she is thin as she is fed little. She has brown hair and a rounded face with many scars. Like her friends Grace and Masou, she is an orphan as her parents died of the sickly plague. In Feud, she talks about how her parents died, pushing back tears as she shows Grace the scars on her neck. The deputy laundress, Mrs. Fadget, treats Ellie badly, forcing her to work long hours without a break, and tries to suck up to Grace when Grace visits the laundry to make up excuses to drag Ellie out of her work to talk to her. (These excuses often involve numerous unwashed chemises and precious silk handkerchiefs that need scrubbing from ink stains.) In the second book, Betrayal, Mrs. Fadget treats Ellie so badly she gets quinsey. While Grace is on a Captain Drake's ship, Mary Shelton cares for Ellie until Grace comes back with Lady Sarah. By that time Ellie is much better. In Exile, Book 5, Ellie is falsely accused of stealing the Heart of Kings. The Heart of Kings is the most famed and fabled jewel in the world and is the most treasured possession of the Court's noble foreign visitor (Banoo Yasmine from Sharkand, A.K.A. The Holy Lands). Luckily Ellie is proved innocent and Grace is the one to give out the \\"good tidings\\". Ellie is later upgraded to tiring woman after she catches a criminal and she takes great care and time with Grace's hair and appearance and often accompanies her on her missions. =Masou al-Ahmed= Masou is a Muslim boy and a skilled tumbler in Queen Elizabeth's court. Like Ellie, he is rewarded later in the series and becomes one of the Queen's very own Fools after performing an act of bravery. He is good friends with Grace and Ellie and helps them solve mysteries. When Lady Sarah was captured by Captain Derby in Betrayal, Masou helps Lady Grace save her and her tiring woman Olwen. Masou is from Africa and never knew his mother, who died at his birth. His father died of consumption after arriving in England when he was very young. He is cheeky, fun and boastful about his skills. He is especially good at juggling with fire. In the third book, Conspiracy, Masou looks after Gypsy Pete when he was hurt by a firework. He likes to try and scare the girls and in Haunted, Grace says it is the first time she has seen him speechless (when he is granted the honor of Court Fool, and quickly becomes the Queen's favourite). =Lady Sarah Bartelmy= Lady Sarah Bartelmy is one of Grace's fellow Maids of Honour and shares a bedchamber with Grace. She is two years older than Grace and is a lively and flirtatious girl. She is exceedingly picky over her makeup and hair and drives her chambermaids mad with her constant fussing over pearls and hair arrangements. She is the wealthiest of all the Maids of Honour and spends a month wearing every gown before begging for a new one. Not much is known about Lady Sarah's past, childhood or family except that she is an exceedingly wealthy young heiress and her family owns a large estate called Bartelmy House a hundred miles away from the Queen's residence. Lady Sarah is very pretty, with becoming copper coloured locks and a large bosom. She is the poor Maid of Honour who has to sit for hours on end while the Queen's artist paints her because Queen Elizabeth has no time to spare. She also pretends to be the Queen at a masque where the Queen plays a cunning prank on her courtiers. In the second book, Lady Sarah and her tiring woman Olwen are captured by Captain Derby. Lady Sarah's enemy at Court is her fellow Maid of Honour Lady Jane Coningsby. In Deception Sarah creates a rude rhyme mocking Lady Jane's lack of skating technique, which she sings in front of six young gentlemen, a large congregation and Lady Jane. Grace writes it down in her daybooke. Lady Jane then sings one back about three large spots (interpretative the 'three blind mice'), staring at Lady Sarah whilst singing it. They constantly vie each other for the most men following them After the tenth book, Lady Sarah is being wooed by a Gentleman of the Guards named Daniel Cheshire. He writes love poetry for her, which she receives very happily, and by the end of the twelfth book they are hand-fasted to wed. They are extremely happy together. =Lady Jane Coningsby= Lady Jane Coningsby is a new Maid of Honour at Whitehall Palace who took the place of a banished Maid of Honour, Katharine Broke, who was sent home in disgrace after a scandal with the Duke of Norkfolk's young nephew. Lady Jane is not the most popular amongst the other Maids of Honour. Lady Jane's number one enemy at Court is Lady Sarah Bartelmy, her fellow Maid of Honour. They both despise each other. Since Lady Jane lately came to Court, she has had countless squabbles with arrogant Lady Sarah. Lady Jane despises Lady Sarah, and fights with her almost constantly. She is always searching for ways to outdo Lady Sarah in gaining the attention of the young gentlemen. Lady Jane is very pretty, as is her rival Sarah Bartelmy. Jane has an exceedingly tall elegant figure and long, carefully styled blonde ringlets 'foaming down her back', as one of the dafter court gentlemen wrote in a poem. Her father was the ambassador to the French Court at one time, so she gives herself fancy airs and graces. Jane often uses her eloquently superior way of public speaking to demean her rival Lady Sarah and update herself as supposedly the most beautiful and attractive of all the Maids at Court. Jane also thinks she knows more about fashion than anyone else because the French Court was so fashionable at the time her father was ambassador and wears a lot of French- style apparel. She is very jumpy about her clothes and her reputation for her beauty. Every other Maid of Honour is very fed up of Lady Jane and Lady Sarah quarrelling. Like many other Maids of Honour and Ladies in Waiting at the Court of Queen Elizabeth I, Jane's dreams are to find a man of money and rank to marry. She has a love of flirting, and uses her reputation of ultimate beauty to propel and strengthen that love. In Betrayal, Lady Jane is jealous of Lady Sarah because Lady Sarah attracts two piratical but nevertheless gallant, flirtatious, generous, handsome, dashing young sea captains to her beauty and wealth on a visit to Tillbury Docks while Jane herself, who constantly considers herself ultimately beautiful, is positively ignored, even when she deliberately steps into a muddy puddle wearing her best shoes, simply in the hope of attracting a little attention from Captain Drake and Captain Derby. Jane is very attractive and has a little group of young courtiers following her, wherever she goes. Jane constantly complains that Lady Sarah has all the gentlemen to herself, but despite her steadfast complaints, she does know that men of the Court go positively moony over her for a range of different reasons: her flirtatious manner, her beauty, and her wealth, the fact that she is an heiress, that she is exceedingly well-born, and that she has wealthy parents. In the 12th book, Loot, before the celebrations for the Queen's 12th year on the throne, Lady Jane and Lady Sarah have a fight over who gets to wear a crimson velvet dress. They have a tug of war, suggested by Lady Sarah, over it which results in Lady Jane ripping the dress in half. =Mary Shelton= Mary Shelton is a Maid of Honour at the Court. She has been very kind to Lady Grace since Grace's mother died. When Ellie is sick with quinsy and Lady Sarah appears to have run off with a piratical sea captain, Mary stays at Whitehall and nurses Ellie. Meanwhile, Grace is away at sea with her hair cut short, pretending to be a boy. Mary is not entirely clueless about Grace's secret role at Whitehall Palace as Lady Pursuivant, and is Grace's sidekick when necessary. However, she never questions Grace's activities. Mary is quiet, loving, gentle and friendly. She loves to gossip and hates climbing trees and walking the dogs. She doesn't like mice. As Grace quotes in her daybooke, \\"She doesn't like mice, rats or lizards, or any small scuttly creature for that matter, but at least she has some sense.\\" Mary Shelton is not entitled to the qualifications of the title 'Lady', but she was well-born enough to serve the Queen, which in turn gave her a decent position at Court in the Queen's favour. Mary has many nieces and nephews, as well as many friends and relatives. Little is known of Mary's possible background, but we think her mother is dead and she is possibly an orphan. In real life Mary Shelton did exist and after a while became the Lady of the Bedchamber to Queen Elizabeth I, a great honour. She was well known for being irritating, and was once slapped across the cheek by the Queen herself, a happening proven by historical evidence! =Mr Daniel Cheshire= Mr Daniel Cheshire is Lady Sarah's suitor. He is a member of the Gentlemen's Guard at Court and has rank and wealth. He is tall, slim, young and handsome with reddish-blonde hair. In Book 10, Jinx, Lady Sarah is badly burned in a fire, but Daniel Cheshire remains steadfast and ever loyal to her, bringing trinkets, gifts and love poetry. It is this which convinces Grace that Daniel Cheshire is a truly good and worthy suitor. They are in love by the end of Book 10, and by the end of Book 12 they are formally handfasted to be married. =Will Somers= Will Somers is the Queen's fool and head of the Queen's troupe. He is Masou's boss and Masou often makes excuses to him so that he can discreetly slip out to Grace. Somers runs the troupe and produces acts for the Queen and her Court, especially at large feasts. He and his troupe entertain the Queen in her Presence Chamber. Will Somers was actually a real person and he was Henry VIII's personal 'fool' as well as Elizabeth 1st. He is not mentioned too much in the books. =Mrs Champernowne= Mrs Champernowne is in charge of the Maids of Honour. She is strict and often reprimands Grace; in Assassin, Grace is out at night once, and Mrs. Champernowne threatens to spank, or \\"birch\\" Grace! However, when one of the Maids of Honour is ill, she takes good care of them. She is a very important character throughout the series. Mrs Champernowne was a real person, unlike some of the characters in the Lady Grace Mysteries. She looked after Queen Elizabeth I as a baby. In Feud, she reveals unknowingly, the last clue to the mystery of Carmina's poisoning to Grace. She hates it when Grace climbs trees and run down the corridors because she believes it is not \\"lady like\\". Mrs Champernowne is Welsh, and Grace states that she has a sing-song voice. =Mr Hatton= Mr Hatton is the head of the Gentlemen Guard. He often makes the arrests after Lady Grace has solved a mystery. He considers Lady Grace to be a silly Maid of Honour who always gets in the way for example, in deception when Grace goes with Mr Hatton she gets throttled with a knife. Sometimes, Mr Hatton is too rash and arrests the wrong person because of what seems obvious – one example is in book 11 Keys when he wrongly accuses the clockmaker's apprentice for murdering Mr Urseau. He loves the Queen in the stories. Book Synopses = Assassin = Lady Grace Cavendish, an orphaned Maid of Honour to Queen Elizabeth I, must choose between three suitors that the Queen has chosen for her. In her heart, Grace doesn't want to marry any of them - it's merely a forced choice between ancient Sir Charles, snooty, bullying Sir Gerald and penniless, tongue-tied Lord Robert. However, disaster soon strikes - one of her suitors is found murdered and another is apparently guilty! Lady Grace is unconvinced and seeks to find the true killer with the help of her loyal friends, Ellie the laundrymaid and Masou the acrobat. In the hustle and bustle of the Elizabethan Court, our heroine must solve her first mystery, hindered by false trails and the limited privacy that comes with her status. But being the Queen's favorite maid of honour means life isn't always easy and sometimes the most useless things come in as quite useful. = Betrayal = A trip to the docks to visit the handsome sea captain Sir Francis Drake sets the Court in a flutter, and when Grace's fellow Maid of Honour, the vain Sarah Bartelmy mysteriously disappears, Lady Grace assumes that she has run away to marry the pirate captain. However, a trail of clues leads the Lady Pursuivant to suspect a kidnapping! With the help of her tumbler friend Masou, she stows away on Drake's ship, determined to save her friend's reputation. After a few minutes of the day, you could see it and then you could get it. When Lady Grace was a really good one, yesterday we made it. = Conspiracy = Queen Elizabeth I flees London for the summer, avoiding the outbursts of plague, and takes herself and her Court off to the sleepy English countryside, where village after village welcome and honour the Queen as their blessed sovereign and queen. When they get to the grand country home of Lord Robert Dudley, the Queen's lost love, the grand Swedish Prince Sven has come to court the Queen, to Lord Robert's disgust. In the flurry of excitement, Grace finds herself being ardently courted by one of Lord Robert's henchmen, who also speaks Swedish. That night, in the midst of entertainment, bad luck seems to haunt the Queen. Saddles on horses slip, statues collapse and fireworks go awry, injuring a little boy. Grace plunges for the third time into the hustle and bustle of Queen Elizabeth's Court as she tries to unravel the mystery of the murderous intent of a hidden presence. No-one is beyond suspicion, and Grace knows she cannot let anyone pull the wool over her eyes. = Deception = Six months have passed and snow lies thick upon the ground as Queen Elizabeth's favourite goddaughter paces through the palace, desperate to attend the Frost Fair. A temper tantrum from the Queen sends the Maids and Ladies fleeing the palace, determined to see the fair. But their evening is ruined when a strangled corpse is found upon the ice, with two of the Queen's new coins bound to his eyes. The Maids are rushed back to the palace in a state of emergency, leaving Grace with yet another mystery to explore. Her searches for justice take her all over London and beyond, to find a most unlikely villain... = Exile = Spring is inching forwards and the wondrous Banoo Yasmine has come to Court, begging for a loan from Queen Elizabeth. The Court is bewitched by the exotic wonders of the beautiful young woman and one of Grace's closest friends begins yearning after the Banoo's approval. When the Banoo Yasmine's most precious possession goes missing, guards scramble through the palace in the vain hope of overturning the jewel. Suddenly the shout goes up that the Heart of Kings ruby has been found! Everyone rejoices, including Grace, until she asks after the thief's name. In horror, she learns that the finger has been pointed at one of her best friends. In proving Ellie Bunting's innocence, Grace crashes through the castle and Court, earning a record for clumsiness and finding a lot more as well... = Feud = The Court painters have arrived and the Queen is too busy to pose for paintings, so Sarah Bartelmy takes her place. Lady Grace is fascinated by the painters and their skill, when suddenly a friend of hers falls dangerously, mysteriously ill. Grace suspects that it is not a natural illness, but a botched assassination attempt... or was it botched? Scrambling through the palace, Lady Grace finds out a devastating truth that changes the very way she looks at the rest of her fellow courtiers forever... = Gold = One of the Queen's Maid of Honour is getting married. However, the preparations are interrupted when Her Majesty's gold is stolen! Another mystery for the secret Lady Pursuivant.

But when a spooky figure, apparently the ghost of the first Earl, appears there is a big uproar, and Lady Grace has to pursue the Queen to stay at the manor for a few more days, so that she can solve the mystery, because she is sure the ghost is only an impostor. An impostor who is aiming to destroy the nobleman's dreams and his manor. Assisted by her friends Lady Grace uncovers the ghost's real identity along with a bit of the manor's history. = Keys = When the Queen's clockmaker, Mr Urseau is found dead in his workshop with a dagger in his chest and a key clutched in his hand the finger is pointed to his apprentice. But Lady Cavendish is certain he is not the murder. Who would have possibly wanted the royal clockmaker dead? What are these secret meetings Mr Urseau had been attending to? And does the key have anything to do with his death? When Grace finds out that the dagger was not intended for Mr Urseau's chest but the Queen's, she is resolved to find the villain as soon as possible. = Loot = It has been twelve years since Elizabeth I was crowned England's Queen. The whole court is alive with the celebrations and many foreign visitors have come to see the monarch wear the famous Crown Jewels. But when the crown of St Edward is stolen from a guarded room, it is up to Lady Grace, Ellie and Masou to find the thief and make sure the foreign guests are not disappointed. Will the daring Lady Pursuivant find the villain before Her Majesty is publicly humiliated...?

He notably served as Comptroller of the Household from 1880 to 1885 and as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard from 1892 to 1895. Background Edwardes was the eldest son of Captain William Edwardes, 3rd Baron Kensington, by his wife Laura Jane Ellison, daughter of Cuthbert Ellison, of Hebburn Hall, Hebburn, County Durham.thepeerage.com William Edwardes, 4th Baron Kensington Political career Edwardes was elected to the House of Commons for Haverfordwest in 1868, a seat he held until 1885. In 1872 he succeeded his father as fourth Baron Kensington but as this was an Irish peerage it did not entitle him to a seat in the House of Lords and he was able to remain a member of the House of Commons. When the Liberals came to power in 1880 under William Ewart Gladstone, Kensington was admitted to the Privy Council and appointed Comptroller of the Household (government whip in the House of Commons), a post he held until the government fell in 1885. Following the abolition of his Haverfordwest constituency in 1885, Kensington sought election for Hornsey, but was unsuccessful. In 1886, he was created Baron Kensington, of Kensington in the County of Middlesex, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, which gave him a seat in the House of Lords. The same year the Liberals returned to power under Gladstone, and Kensington served briefly as a Lord-in-waiting (government whip in the House of Lords) from March until the fall of the government in July. The Liberals were out of office for the next six years, but returned to power in 1892, when Gladstone appointed him Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard. He retained this office when Lord Rosebery became Prime Minister in 1894. The Liberal government fell the following year, and Kensington never returned to office. Apart from his political career he also held the honorary post of Lord Lieutenant of Pembrokeshire between 1872 and 1896.leighrayment.com Peerages: Kaberry of Adel to Kilmarnock Local government Kensington was elected to Pembrokeshire County Council at the first county elections in 1889.

The illusion is created by an interlaced grill of warm (e.g., 40°C/104°F) and cool (20°C/68°F) bars. When someone presses a hand against the grill, he or she experiences the illusion of burning heat. But if the person presses against only a cool bar, only coolness is experienced; if the person presses against only a warm bar, only warmth is experienced. Researchers have used the illusion to demonstrate that burning pain sensation is in fact a mixture of both cold and heat pain and that it is only the inhibition of the cold pain \\"channel\\" that reveals the heat component. The illusion is demonstrated by positioning the middle finger in cold water and the ring and index fingers in warm water. Due to shortcomings in the body map - multisensory representation of the body - and this particular sensory input configuration, the brain is tricked into thinking the middle finger is in the warm water and the index and ring fingers in cold water. In an fMRI experiment of the illusion, researchers recently observed an activation of the thalamus not seen for control stimuli. Also, activity in a portion of the right mid/anterior insula correlated with the perceived unpleasantness of the illusion.

Recorded since the 13th century, the church was destroyed in the Great Fire of 1666, then rebuilt by the office of Sir Christopher Wren. The rebuilt church was demolished in 1840. Early history St. Bartholomew was dedicated to the apostle who, by tradition, was martyred in Armenia by being flayed alive. The Royal Exchange was opened next to the church in 1571. The earliest surviving reference to the church is in a document of 1225/6. As this was 3½ centuries before the foundation of the Royal Exchange, early references to the church are as “St. Bartholomew the Less” or “Little St. Bartholomew”, to distinguish it from the priory of St Bartholomew-the-Great. In 1547, upon the dissolution of the monasteries, the nearby chapel that stood within St Bartholomew's Hospital itself, was renamed St Bartholomew the Little, as a parish church. -- now St. Bartholomew-the-Less. In the interim between this date and the building of the Royal Exchange, the church later called “St. Bartholomew-by-the-Exchange” became lytyll saynt Bathellmuw besyd sunt Antony's. According to John Stow the church was rebuilt by an alderman assisted by a sheriff in 1438. In 1509, a south chapel was added by Lord Mayor and Draper Sir William Capel, whose mansion was in the parish. Although he was rector of St Magnus-the-Martyr, Miles Coverdale - the creator of the first complete translation of the Bible into English - was buried in St. Bartholomew-by-the-Exchange in 1568.\\"The London Encyclopaedia\\" Hibbert,C; Weinreb,B; Keay,J: London, Pan Macmillan, 1983 (rev 1993,2008) Upon the destruction of the church, his remains were moved to St. Magnus’. Rebuilding St. Bartholomew-by-the-Exchange was one of 89 churches destroyed in the Great Fire. An entry in Robert Hooke’s diary of 1674 records a decision to pull down the damaged steeple. Rebuilding began the following year and finished in 1683 at a total cost of £5077. Parish boundary mark on wall of the Bank of England The plan of the new church was irregular as it was built on the foundations of its predecessor. Only the west face of the church, on Bartholomew Lane, was exposed. This was three bays wide, the central bay being equal in width to the two outer bays combined. The two outer bays had large round headed windows, while the central bay had a Venetian window above the main entrance. The tower was in the south west corner and was built of brick, with a parapet on top. In the middle of each side was an open arch supported by ramps. This was either a whimsical design or preparation for a steeple that was never erected. Inside, the church was divided into a nave and two aisles by two rows of eight columns which also supported a clerestory. St. Bartholomew’s was one of the few Wren churches to have a protruding chancel. In addition to the tower, also projecting from the quadrilateral body from the church was a chapel on the south side – on the site of the 1509 Capel chapel and a vestry room on the north east corner. Carlos described the church’s interior as “light and graceful”. Demolition In 1838, the Royal Exchange, which had also been rebuilt after the Great Fire, burnt down. In order to improve access to the site of the Exchange, the Corporation of London petitioned Parliament for permission to demolish St. Bartholomew-by-the-Exchange – as well as the neighbouring St. Benet Fink, so that Threadneedle Street could be widened. This was granted and the church demolished in 1840. Edward John Carlos, writing in The Gentleman's Magazine prophesied: “The apathy with which the removal of St Bartholomew’s church will be remembered and felt when perhaps the loss of this church will be found a trifle in comparison with the wholesale destruction to which, ere long, the churches of the metropolis may chance to be destined”. The parish was combined with that of St Margaret Lothbury and proceeds of the sale of the site were used to build St. Bartholomew Moor Lane. This church, designed by Charles Robert Cockerell, was a replica of St. Bartholomew-by-the-Exchange and included much of its furnishings. This, in turn, was demolished in 1902 and the £20,400 realised from the sale of this site were used to build St. Bartholomew Stamford Hill.Photo of site in 2008 Cockerell also designed the Sun Life Assurance building that was erected on the site of the demolished church. This, in turn, was demolished and the site is now occupied by the Royal Bank of Scotland. Since the demolition of St. Bartholomew's, 31 City churches have been lost due to demolition or bombing during World War II.

It is located in Fairbury, Illinois. History The consolidated Prairie Central district was created in 1985 by merging three districts. Those three districts' high schools were Fairbury Cropsey High School, Forrest-Strawn-Wing High School, and Chatsworth High School. Upon completion of the merger, the new district chose to locate their high school in the building that was formerly known as Fairbury-Cropsey Junior-Senior High School, a building that dated from the 1940s. The building that had housed Forrest-Strawn-Wing High School—built just a couple of years prior to consolidation—was chosen to be the location of the new district's junior high school. In 2004 the district expanded further expanded with the addition of the students from the former Chenoa High School. Upon the change of the school's name, the mascot and school colors were also changed. The new mascot selected was the Hawks, and the new colors were white, Columbia blue, and navy.

The line is very wide and very deep, and it originates in the photosphere, just like any other absorption line. Several other lines are superimposed on it. In the center, the emission due to the K line itself, which takes place in the chromosphere. Zoom on the emission core. W0 is defined as the difference in wavelength between the points on either side of the emission at an average intensity between the K1 minimum and the K2 maximum The Ca II K line in cool stars is among the strongest emission lines which originates in the star's chromosphere. In 1957, Olin C. Wilson and M. K. Vainu Bappu reported on the remarkable correlation between the measured width of the aforementioned emission line and the absolute visual magnitude of the star. This is known as the Wilson–Bappu effect. The correlation is independent of spectral type and is applicable to stellar classification main sequence types G, K, and Red giant type M. The greater the emission band, the brighter the star, which is correlated with distance empirically. The main interest of the Wilson–Bappu effect is in its use for determining the distance of stars too remote for direct measurements. It can be studied using nearby stars, for which independent distance measurements are possible, and it can be expressed in a simple analytical form. In other words, the Wilson–Bappu effect can be calibrated with stars within 100 parsecs from the Sun. The width of the emission core of the K line ( ) can be measured in distant stars, so, knowing W0 and the analytical form expressing the Wilson–Bappu effect, we can determine the absolute magnitude of a star. The distance of a star follows immediately from the knowledge of both absolute and apparent magnitude, provided that the interstellar reddening of the star is either negligible or well known. The first calibration of the Wilson–Bappu effect using distance from Hipparcos parallaxes was made in 1999 by Wallerstein et al. A later work also used W0 measurements on high-resolution spectra taken with CCD, but a smaller sample. According to the latest calibration, the relation between absolute visual magnitude (Mv) expressed in magnitudes and W0, transformed in km/s, is the following: M_V=33.2-18.0 log(W_0) The data error, however, is quite large: about 0.5 mag, rendering the effect too imprecise to significantly improve the cosmic distance ladder. Another limitation comes from the fact that the measurement of W0 in distant stars is very challenging, requires long observations at big telescopes. Sometimes the emission feature in the core of the K line is affected by the interstellar extinction. In these cases an accurate measurement of W0 is not possible. The Wilson–Bappu effect is also valid for the Mg II k line. However, the Mg II k line is at 2796.34 Å in the ultraviolet, and since the radiation at this wavelength does not reach the earth's surface it can only be observed with satellites such as the International Ultraviolet Explorer. In 1977, Stencel published a spectroscopic survey that showed that the wing emission features seen in the broad wings of the K line among higher luminosity late type stars, share a correlation of line width and Mv similar to the Wilson–Bappu effect.

The New York Institute of Technology (NYIT) was established in 1955, and is located in New York, NY, USA. The 1950s The founders of New York Institute of Technology, and in particular Alexander Schure, Ph.D., started the college with the purpose of creating a career-oriented school that focused on giving students the training necessary to succeed in their chosen careers.\\"Let the anniversary celebrations begin\\" NYIT Magazine, Fall 2006 New York Institute of Technology began in operations in 1955 in New York City with only nine students. Schure served as New York Institute of Technology's first president. The function of higher education was highly debated at the time. There was growing concern that American schools and colleges were failing to meet critical national demands, particularly the need for scientists, engineers, and high-level technicians. This anxiety, in turn, generated another concern – fear that humanities studies would become overshadowed by an emphasis on science and engineering. NYIT's first administrators created a balance, a coexistence of career training and liberal arts education. Leaders of the college took an early stand, committing NYIT to a policy of access. In addition to opening its doors to high school graduates who wanted to attend, NYIT created an extensive range of student services to help ensure the college's success. The career-focused mission of the school and its \\"access to opportunity\\" mission were well received in the marketplace, resulting in rapid enrollment growth. By the 1958–1959 academic year, NYIT had more than 300 students and the time had come to expand its physical operations. In April 1958, the college purchased the Pythian Temple at 135-145 W. 70th St. in Manhattan for its main center. NYIT's original Brooklyn location soon became home to the college's division of general studies. The Manhattan building, adjacent to the planned Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, was an ornate 12-story structure with a columned entranceway. Built in 1929 at a cost of $2 million, it included among its features a huge 1,200-seat auditorium. Also in 1958, New York Institute of Technology sponsored the first National Technology Awards, created by Frederick Pittera, an organizer of international fairs and a member of the NYIT Board of Trustees, to help raise funds for NYIT science and technology laboratories. The awards, held at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, were attended by several hundred guests, with entertainment provided by the U.S. Air Force Band. 36th President of the United States Lyndon Johnson was the keynote speaker. His speech was broadcast nationally by the ABC Radio Network. Among the honorees were Dr. Wernher von Braun and Major General Bernard Schriever, Commanding General of the Ballistic Air Command. Photos, press clippings, and audio tapes of the event are on view at the Lyndon Johnson Library at Austin, Texas. The 1960s In 1960 NYIT received a provisional charter from the Board of Regents to operate as a four-year college with the ability to grant bachelor's degrees. (The permanent charter was granted in 1962.) In the early 1960s, enrollment was already reaching 1,500 students, and it was time to look for a bigger campus. A temporary site in Syosset, N.Y., was opened while school officials searched for a permanent home. Many prospective sites were examined before the officials decided on one of Long Island's most famous properties – a 280-acre (1.1 km²) tract of the Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney estate in Old Westbury. Later, the college would acquire a number of neighboring properties in Brookville and Old Brookville, joining together more than 700 acres (2.8 km²) of the fabled stretch of Gold Coast estates that thrived on Long Island's North Shore during the Roaring '20s. Half of New York Institute of Technology’s 1,050 acres Old Westbury campus is located in the Village of Brookville. Many estate buildings and stables were renovated into classroom space. The School of Architecture and Design, for example, is housed in what was once Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney's state-of-the-art chicken coop. Feathers and manure were once burned in underground ovens behind the structure, and the smell from this furnace occasioned many complaints from adjoining estates. In 1924 Violet Doyle, the daughter of a local blacksmith, contracted typhus and died after drinking water from a contaminated well near the building. A lawsuit resulted, and the building was left vacant until NYIT repurposed it as classrooms in 1965. Thirty-five hundred students attended NYIT in fall 1965, an increase of 1,000 over the previous year. More importantly, the college's enrollment figures now included students from other states and countries. The young college quickly became a leader in using educational technology. With the help of a grant from the Carnegie Corporation of New York, the school set out to develop an automated, self-instructional engineer training system. \\"When the system [is] completed,\\" the foundation said in its 1964 annual report, \\"it may serve as a model for other engineering technician programs throughout the country, offering one … solution to the severe manpower and teacher shortage in the field.\\" NYIT was also building a reputation for research in other areas. In 1965, an applied-research laboratory was established to bring the full resources of the faculty and its facilities to bear on the solution of important technology problems for government and industry. Long before personal computers were invented, NYIT was involved in efforts to use mainframes as a teaching tool. The institute received its first computer, donated by the CIT Financial Corporation, in 1965. Three years later, the college received two grants totaling approximately $3 million from the federal government – one to develop a system of individualized learning through the use of computers; the other to develop a computer-based course in general physics for midshipmen at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md. Student organizations also increased during the 1960s: NYIT's Old Westbury student newspaper, the Campus Slate, put out its first issue in September 1966; the first Old Westbury student drama production, \\"Tea and Sympathy,\\" was performed in November 1966; and the Old Westbury Student Activity Center opened in December 1969. Manhattan students were equally busy, introducing their own student newspaper, the Scope, and producing plays like \\"You Can't Take It With You\\" in 1964. In 1965, WNYT, the college's first radio station, began broadcasting in the basement cafeteria. The 1970s 1970 was the year that NYIT was accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools, the regional body that oversees educational standards. In addition, NYIT launched its first master's program, a Master of Business Administration, and started its alumni association, the first organization created to help graduates network after leaving school. College-wide enrollment reached 5,000 students during this time, with the Manhattan campus bursting at the seams. In 1971, Muhammad Ali visited NYIT. At the start of the 1971–1972 academic year, NYIT moved that campus to several floors of a newly constructed 45-story skyscraper at 888 Seventh Avenue. But as enrollment grew over the next few years, the Manhattan campus moved to larger facilities at its current location at 61st Street and Broadway in 1976. Renovations continued at the Old Westbury campus, with the former Alfred I. du Pont mansion opening in 1972 as the de Seversky Conference Center. Named after longtime NYIT board member and aviation designer Alexander P. de Seversky, the center provided a wonderful environment to train students in the college's culinary arts, hospitality management, and communication arts programs. New degrees were also added to NYIT's career-training programs during this time. In 1973, the college received approval to award Bachelor of Architecture degrees and was accredited by the National Architecture Accrediting Board in 1977. In 1974, another legendary program began at NYIT. Many of today's most sophisticated 3-D computer animation techniques descend from NYIT's Computer Graphics Lab (CGL), which would pioneer the field for nearly two decades. The CGL's roster was a digital dream team. Prominent members included future Pixar Animation Studios President Edwin Catmull and co-founder Alvy Ray Smith; Walt Disney Feature Animation Chief Scientist Lance Joseph Williams; DreamWorks animator Hank Grebe; Computer Media Artist Rebecca Allen and Netscape and Silicon Graphics founder Jim Clark. Researchers at the New York Institute of Technology Computer Graphics Lab created the tools that made entirely 3D CGI films possible. NYIT CG Lab was regarded as the top computer animation research and development group in the world during the late 70s and early 80s.Brief History of the New York Institute of Technology Computer Graphics Lab (retrieved 30 June 2012)A compilation of NYIT images and information can be found on Paul Heckbert's site(retrieved 30 June 2012) But computer graphics were not NYIT's only successes in the entertainment industry. The invention of the digital noise reducer by William E. Glenn, Ph.D., earned the college its first television Emmy award in 1978. Glenn's research at the school's Science and Research Center also led to the college receiving a patent in 3-D technology in 1979. NYIT embarked on one of its biggest endeavors during the late 1970s – it launched a medical school, the New York College of Osteopathic Medicine (NYCOM), the first osteopathic medical school in the state. It has since grown to enroll the largest number of medical students on a single campus in the United States. The 1980s In 1980, NYIT's student-run newspaper The Campus Slate conducted interviews with Oscar-nominated actress Diane Lane and The Beach Boys. NYIT's sports teams scored a number of victories during the 1980s. The men's basketball team returned to the NCAA Division II playoffs in 1980, making it all the way to the national championships before losing 80–74 to Virginia Union. The baseball team also returned to the NCAA Division II playoffs in 1980 and continued to perform at the top of its game as it moved to NCAA Division I in 1983. A new era was ushered in when NYIT's founding president, Alexander Schure, Ph.D., Ed.D., took up the role of chancellor in 1982, and his son, Matthew Schure, Ph.D., was named president of the college. NYIT continued to expand, opening a third campus in Central Islip, N.Y., in September 1984. The expansive campus featured Georgian-style brick buildings grouped and connected by roads lined with century-old trees. It was also home to the college's first on-campus residential facility. In order to serve those who could not attend classes at one of its three campuses, the college launched American Open University of NYIT in November 1984. The forerunner to today's online colleges, this \\"virtual campus\\" allowed students to work at their convenience using home computers. The World Health Organization designated the medical school in 1988 as one of three collaborative centers for occupational medicine in the United States. The 1990s NYIT's own advertising program advanced that year with the creation of a student-run advertising agency, the Carleton Group, at the Central Islip campus. During this time, NYIT was one of only two colleges in the state offering a concentration in advertising. NYIT's commitment to distance learning remained a priority as upgrades were constantly developed. In 1991, COSY, an early Internet tool, featured group capability and provided statistical reports on student and faculty participation. Shifting to the Collegis tool set in 1998 allowed faculty members to use more sophisticated files, including multimedia, and made available a 24-hour help desk. In 1991, the school graduated its 1,000th physician. NYCOM established a minority and disadvantaged Post Baccalaureate Future Physicians Program in 1994. The Campus Voice, the student-run newspaper of the Central Islip campus, begins publication in 1992 and soon becomes known for its investigative reporting. Controversial articles included uncovering management improprieties by food service provider, Lackmann Culinary Services which forced NYIT to cease negotiations on extending their contract, and a front page reprinting of a letter signed by then-NYIT Vice President of Academic Affairs and current NYIT President, Dr. Edward Guiliano, outlining his plan to retire the school's policy of scheduling few classes on Friday. The letter was leaked to The Campus Voice by faculty. In the letter, Dr. Guiliano admitted the decision would be unpopular with students but ended with, \\"...they'll have no choice because they are a captive audience.\\" The decision to uphold the \\"few classes on Friday\\" policy was announced within hours after the story went public. NYIT's School of Engineering made headlines in 1995 when a team of students took first place in the U.S. Department of Energy's Clean Air Road Rally in Los Angeles, Calif. The team spent three years designing and building a high- performance hybrid electric car that beat out 43 other vehicles. In 1996, The Campus Voice placed 2nd in the category of Best Overall College Newspaper by the Society for Collegiate Journalists. The year 1997 marked another NYIT first as the men's lacrosse team won the college's first national championship when it captured the NCAA Division II title. In 1998, NYCOM opened the Adele Smithers Parkinson's Disease Center. Among its many initiatives, the center provides medical care, promotes community awareness and Parkinson's disease education, fosters scientific studies and medical research, and helps individual patients achieve and maintain the best quality of life possible while coping with the disease. In 1998 NYIT opened a program in China. Within the next seven years, the college would establish programs in Canada and the Middle East. In 1999, Bill Gates spoke at NYIT and received NYIT's Presidential Medal. The 2000s In 2000 Edward Guiliano, Ph.D., was named the college's third president. After September 11, 2001, security became a major global concern, and NYIT received a $300,000 federal grant to build a new cybersecurity lab to meet the growing need for students trained to defend organizations against cyber attacks. In 2002, NYIT expanded its Manhattan campus and in 2003 launched Ellis College of NYIT, an online school created to serve working adults. In that year, NYIT also installed the fastest broadband network on the East Coast. In 2003, NYIT opened its Bahrain campus to students seeking an American-style education in the Middle East. In 2004, plans were announced to reorganize the Central Islip campus into a community service facility with most of the academic programs relocated to the Old Westbury and Manhattan campuses. Remaining in Central Islip were the culinary arts program and its restaurant, the Epicurean Room; the Vocational Independence Program (VIP) for students with learning disabilities; a family medical center; the Technology-Based Learning Research Center; and the BOCES and Head Start programs. In 2005, NYIT participated in its first Solar Decathlon, an international competition sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy. NYIT was one of 19 colleges internationally and the only school in the New York metropolitan area participating in the competition. The team, composed of students and faculty, captured fifth-place honors. Since 2005, NYIT has been offering degree programs in Abu Dhabi, the capital city of the United Arab Emirates. The NYIT campus is located in the Center of Excellence for Applied Research and Training (CERT) Technology Park. NYIT-Abu Dhabi became the first American university in Abu Dhabi. The classrooms feature the latest technologies, including smartboards and high-tech computers, as well as an extensive library collection and excellent parking facilities. At NYIT-Abu Dhabi, students have a number of extra- and co-curricular activities in which they can participate. The NYIT-Abu Dhabi Speakers Series invites prominent business, government, and educational leaders to campus to lecture on important 21st-century topics. Past presenters include U.S. Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings. In 2007, NYIT co-hosted the International Energy Conference and Exhibition in Daegu, South Korea. In that year, the university also received $500,000 in federal funding to develop a \\"green print\\" initiative to research alternative fuel technology and determine the university's carbon footprint. In 2008, NYIT installed a state-of-the-art 3-D motion capture lab for its Fine Arts program at its Old Westbury campus. The system allows the university to use state-of-the-art \\"Hollywood-style\\" technology to teach the next generation of computer animators. Later that year, NYIT was awarded a $130,000 research contract by United Space Alliance to help NASA scientists design the crew module of the Orion spacecraft using 3-D motion capture technology. NYIT's College of Osteopathic Medicine also uses 3-D motion capture technology to help doctors better identify mobility and stability problems in patients with Parkinson's disease. NYIT sponsored the first annual International Water Conference in July 2008 at the United Nations in New York City. The event brought together representatives from non- governmental organizations, international corporations, and universities to discuss the need to safeguard the planet's water resources. The following year, NYIT sponsored its second U.N. event, the International Energy Conference (August 31-September 1, 2009) to welcome energy secretaries, policy makers, and executives from multinational companies to examine opportunities and innovations in the field of sustainable technology. Notable commencement speakers at NYIT during the 2000s included George Pataki, the 53rd Governor of New York, Sanjay Kumar, chairman and CEO of CA Technologies and Chuck Schumer, United States Senator from New York, among others. The 2010s In 2016, NYIT placed first at the Long Island regional round of the New York State Business Plan Competition, Stony Brook University placed second. In 2016, NYIT beat dozens of global competitors to take first place in The VEX Robotics Competition. In 2016, the National Security Agency and the Department of Homeland Security designated NYIT as a National Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense Education. In 2016, NYIT received a $0.3 million grant for smartphone security research from National Science Foundation. Many celebrities visited NYIT including Patch Adams, Carey Mulligan, Gloria Steinem, Meryl Streep, Mark Ruffalo and Leslee Udwin, among others.

Following contradictory reports about the circumstances of his death and apparent anomalies about the issuing of the death certificate and other procedures, several conspiracy theories have gained currency. Many of these concern the serious corruption in the Vatican Bank (Istituto per le Opere Religiose), possibly linked to Freemasonry, which is forbidden by church law. None of the claims has been substantiated. Rationale Discrepancies in the Vatican's account of the events surrounding Pope John Paul I's death – its inaccurate statements about who found the body; what he had been reading; when, where, and whether an autopsy could be carried out – produced a number of conspiracy theories, many associated with the Vatican Bank, which owned many shares in Banco Ambrosiano. Some conspiracy theorists connect the death of John Paul in September 1978 with the image of the \\"bishop dressed in white\\" said to have been seen by Lucia Santos and her cousins Jacinta and Francisco Marto during the visitations of Our Lady of Fátima in 1917.John Paul I at Catholic Counter- Reformation Chapter 4 of Whole Truth about Fátima , sections 7, 8 and 9, webpage found 2010-04-29. In a letter to a colleague, John Paul had said he was deeply moved by having met Lucia and vowed to perform the Consecration of Russia in accordance with her vision.Quoted in Camillo Bassotto's book My Heart Is Still in Venice, a biography of John Paul I (Krinon, 1990). Conspiracy theories =David Yallop= David Yallop's 1984 book In God's Name proposed the theory that the pope had been in \\"potential danger\\" because of corruption in the Vatican Bank (known officially as the Institute for Works of Religion or Istituto per le Opere di Religione), the Vatican's most powerful financial institutionBen Walsh, The Pope’s Overlooked Legacy: Reforming The Vatican Bank.

The Guardian, 2015-08-13 and is known to have involved the bank's head, Bishop Paul Marcinkus, along with Roberto Calvi of the Banco Ambrosiano. Marcinkus, at the time head of the Vatican Bank, was indicted in Italy in 1982 as an accessory in the $3.5 billion collapse of Banco Ambrosiano.Margalit Fox, Archbishop Marcinkus, 84, Banker at the Vatican, Dies. New York Times, 2006-02-22. Calvi was a member of P2, an illegal Italian Masonic lodge.Calvi murder: The mystery of God's banker, The Independent, June 7, 2007 He was found dead in London in 1982, after disappearing just before the corruption became public. His death was initially ruled suicide and a second inquest – ordered by his family – then returned an open verdict. Upon publication of his book, Yallop agreed to donate every penny he made from sales to a charity of the Vatican's choice if they agreed to investigate his central claim, that when the body of the pope was discovered, his contorted hand gripped a piece of paper that was later destroyed because it named high- ranking members of the curia who were Freemasons and others who had a role in numerous corruption scandals and the laundering of mafia drug money. One of the names believed to be on the paper was that of Bishop Paul Marcinkus, who was later promoted by Pope John Paul II to Pro-President of Vatican City, making him the third most powerful person in the Vatican, after the pope and the secretary of state. None of Yallop's claims, which are unproven, has thus far been acknowledged by the Vatican, although Yallop disclosed the amount of Masonic Lodge members from the Curia, whom he alleged to be Freemasons, within the pages of his book.Declaration on Masonic Associations, Vatican website, in English. There is a papal ban of Freemasonry, and it is forbidden by Church law for a Roman Catholic to be a Freemason. Yallop specifically summarized his conspiracy theory in his book: Three archbishops—Marcinkus, Villot and Cody—conspired with three Mafia types—Calvi, Sindona and Gelli—in the murder of John Paul I. “It was clear that these six men—Marcinkus, Villot, Cody, Calvi, Sindona and Gelli—had a great deal to fear if the papacy of John Paul I should continue… all of them stood to gain in a variety of ways if John Paul I should suddenly die.”In God’s Name June 1984, David Yallop. p. 6 =John Cornwell= In his book A Thief in the Night, British historian and journalist John Cornwell examines and challenges Yallop’s points of suspicion. Yallop’s murder theory requires that the pope’s body be found at 4:30 or 4:45 a.m., one hour earlier than official reports estimated. He bases this, inter alia, on an early story by Vatican Radio and the Italian news service ANSA that garbled the time and misrepresented the layout of the papal apartments. Yallop says he had testimony from Sister Vincenza Taffarel (the nun who found the pope's body) to this effect but refused to show Cornwell his transcripts. =Abbé Georges de Nantes= Theologian Abbé spent much of his life building a case for murder against the Vatican, collecting statements from people who knew the pope before and after his election. His writings go into detail about the banks and about John Paul I's supposed discovery of a number of Freemason priests in the Vatican, along with a number of his proposed reforms and devotion to Our Lady of Fátima.Search for \\"Luciani\\" at CRC =Lucien Gregoire= Gregoire builds on his forerunners, benefiting by events not available to the others when they wrote their books. “I owe a great debt of gratitude to my predecessors…had Yallop not laid out the blueprint, had Cornwell not told the truth, had Manhattan not struck on the plot; I could have never written my book.”The Vatican Murders 2017 Lucien Gregoire p. 217 Avro Manhattan linked the CIA to the murder of John Paul I. “The CIA resolved to destroy John Paul I before he would destroy a Vatican subservient to the will of the USA.”The Dollar and the Vatican 1988 Avro Manhattan p.147 In September 1978, with the growing likelihood that U.S President Jimmy Carter would cut off funds to strongman Anastasio Somoza, the CIA feared if Nicaragua fell to the Marxist Sandinistas, the USA would soon be looking at a half-dozen mini-Cubas in Central America.The Harvard Crimson September 19, 1978 Carter Must End Aid to Somoza Suspected CIA covert agent, the Archbishop of Chicago, Cardinal John Cody visited the Polish cardinal (John Paul II) in Krakow during the papacy of John Paul I.In God’s Name 1984 David Yallop. p. 189 What Gregoire brings to the table is the complete record of the courts that tried the bank scandal—from the first transaction that took place on October 22, 1978 six days after John Paul II took office which investor was first contacted on September 15, 1978 midway thru the papacy of John Paul I,Tribunal Latour vs. Ambrosiano, Paris 22 Oct 1985 to the last transaction in 1981 when Banco Ambrosiano was caught funneling hundreds of millions of dollars through the Vatican Bank to Nicaragua and Panama to the benefit of Somoza and the Contras and to a lesser extent Solidarity.The Vatican Murders 2017 Lucien Gregoire p. 403 Hence, Gregoire’s conspiracy theory: ”The conspiracy that planned the Vatican-Ambrosiano Bank ScandalBanco Ambrosiano swindled investors of $1.3 billion routing it through the Vatican Bank to the Contras to crush Liberation Theology (Marxist revolution of the poor) in Central America was the same conspiracy that plotted the murder of John Paul I.”The Vatican Murders 2017 Lucien Gregoire p. 9 =Tridentine Mass= According to the Catholic Traditionalist Movement, their founder Fr. Gommar DePauw was to have gone to Rome to help John Paul I reestablish the Tridentine Mass. > [Fr. DePauw] stated on the 15th anniversary of the pope’s death: “Well, I > tell you one thing, if he had remained Pope, you wouldn’t have me here at > the Chapel because with that beautiful official letter signed by the > Secretary of State, also came an unofficial message that I better start > packing my suitcase, that there was a job waiting for me in Rome, in the > Vatican, to help Pope John Paul I bring the Truth back to the Church. Well, > it wasn’t to be and the Lord, Who knows what He does, obviously wanted me to > be in this Chapel. … What was I going to do in Rome? Well let’s just forget > it.” Other prominent Traditionalist Catholic websites, not related to CTM, have suggested John Paul I may have been assassinated to prevent restoration of the Tridentine Mass. =Fr. Charles Murr= In his 2017 book The Godmother: Madre Pascalina, Fr. Charles Murr writes about the coincidence that Pope John Paul I had attempted to discipline Cardinal Sebastiano Baggio, who appointed many \\"liberal\\" bishops including, later, the sex abuser Theodore McCarrick, and that Cdl. Baggio was the last person to have seen Pope John Paul I alive. = Anthony Raimondi = In his book published in 2019, Anthony Raimondi, a nephew of Lucky Luciano, says he helped his cousin Archbishop Paul Marcinkus kill the pope by force-feeding the latter with valium. The reason given was that John Paul had allegedly threatened to expose \\"a massive stock fraud run by Vatican insiders\\". Raimondi says that plans were made to also assassinate John Paul II had the latter decided to expose the fraud. Raimondi says that \\"If they take [the pope’s body] and do any type of testing, they will still find traces of the poison in his system.\\" In popular culture Malachi Martin's 1986 book Vatican: A NovelMartin, Malachi, Vatican: A Novel, Harper & Row, New York, 1986 is a novel based on recent papal history. Although officially a work of fiction, Martin proposes the theory that the pope was murdered by the Soviet Union because he would abdicate the benign policy of his two predecessors, John XXIII and Paul VI, towards accommodating communism, and once again condemn it as an atheistic totalitarian ideology. Martin believed that the church structure was infiltrated for decades by illuminati agents who reached positions of high influence and rank, such as Jean-Marie Villot, at that time Cardinal Secretary of State. In December 1986, a play by Mark E. Smith of British post-punk band The Fall, Hey! Luciani: The Life and Codex of John Paul I, was staged for two weeks in London, starring performance artist Leigh Bowery. It drew on conspiracy theories about the pope's death. A single, \\"Hey! Luciani\\", reached number 59 on the UK singles chart.The Story of The Fall, \\"Hey! Luciani\\", www.dailyreckless.com. Retrieved 5 February 2018 The 1990 motion picture The Godfather Part III featured a story element depicting Società Generale Immobiliare, the largest real estate company in the world (whose former largest shareholder was the Holy See and the Vatican Bank) involved in organised crime during and after the death of the old pope, and the election of a fictional cardinal named Lamberto to the papacy. Lamberto, an ally to central character Michael Corleone, takes the papal name \\"John Paul I\\" and, like the real Pope John Paul I, he mysteriously dies in his bed after a brief papal tenure. However, unlike the actual pope, who was thin and slight in appearance, this version of John Paul I was dark-haired, stocky and muscular. In the 2002 novel The Company: A Novel of the CIA by Robert Littell, Pope John Paul I is murdered by a KGB hired killer. The Last Confession is a play written in 2007 by Roger Crane. It is a thriller that tracks the dramatic tensions, crises of faith, and political manoeuvrings inside the Vatican surrounding the death of Pope John Paul I. The play toured the UK in the spring of 2007, before being transferred to the Theatre Royal, Haymarket, with a cast including David Suchet. It was subsequently broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on 4 October 2008. In October 2010 the play was brought to continental Europe by the Antwerp Theater Group \\"De Speling\\". Suchet reprised the role at the Ahmanson Theater in Los Angeles in July 2014 and the Comedy Theatre in Melbourne in September 2014.

April 2011 The Maldon Mud Race is an annual fun race held in spring (originally in the winter, now in late April or early May) at Promenade Park in Maldon, Essex, England, in which entrants compete to complete a dash, in thick mud, over the bed of the River Blackwater. The race is organised by the Lions & Rotary clubs of Maldon and Maldon District Council which raises money for charity. History The Maldon mud race began in 1973 when a regular at a local pub was challenged to serve a meal on the riverbank dressed in a dinner jacket. The challenge evolved into a race across the river to a waiting barrel of beer, drinking a pint of beer there and racing back. The barrel of beer has long disappeared and the race has become a charity event, with many participants wearing fancy dress. The event is watched by thousands of spectators and raises tens of thousands of pounds for charity. The 2010 race postponed from December until Easter 2011, because of extreme cold weather and later that year it was announced that the race would switch permanently from winter to spring. Brian Farrington, from the Rotary Club of Maldon, said: \\"It doesn't make any difference in regard to the race itself, because people still get covered in mud. ... Our main concern is health and safety and then how much money we can raise for charity.\\" The race can only take place when the tide is low enough to allow participants to cross the river safely. Participants start from one bank and make their way to the other side, negotiate 200 metres of mud along the river and then return to the original river bank. (Registration required.) In 2009, the race was run twice, on 4 January and 27 December, after the 2008 event was postponed due to high tides. About 250 competitors took part in the December 2009 event and it has increased in size every year since. In 2014 the race was held on 26 May and once again attracted hundreds of competitors. The latest race took place on Sunday 1 May 2016.

It adjoins Dr Williams's Library and is within sight of University College London. The church is used by the Anglican mission Euston Church for Sunday services and its English Chapel, at its east end, by Forward in Faith for weekday services. It has been a Grade I listed building since 10 June 1954, one of 129 such Christian buildings in London. Construction and design Westminster Abbey from a comparable viewpoint – note the central tower and transept rose window. Early English Neo-Gothic in style and cruciform in plan, the church was built by Raphael Brandon between 1850 and 1854 (with Brandon's interior designed in 1853) for the Victorian church movement the Catholic Apostolic Church (also known as \\"Irvingites\\"). It is built of Bath stone, with a tiled roof. The structure is incomplete, lacking two bays on its liturgical west side (which prevented the construction of a planned façade – the west end remains unfinished, in brick apart from entrance in stone) and (like the abbey) a crossing tower (including a 150 ft spire – the tower base that was built has mostly blind arcading). Its cruciform plan is made up of a nave with full triforium and clerestory, side aisles, sanctuary and Lady Chapel. All of the church's exterior corners have octagonal corner turrets with gabled niches and terminating in spires with gablets. The façade has pinnacled buttresses and corbelled parapets. View of the south side of the east end of the Church of Christ the King. The main entrance is at the east end, from Gordon Street, through a gabled porch with angle buttresses (with mouldings, a pointed-arch door and a two-light and oculus plate tracery window above the door) which links onto the Lady Chapel via an octagonal turret and two-light room. (There is also a north side entrance approached by a cloister walk from the porch.) The five-bay nave (only 13 feet lower than that of Westminster Abbey) has a gabled east facade with three large lancets below five smaller ones – on the inside, it has a timber hammer beam roof with angels and central bosses of snowflake design, as well as a double-arcaded triforium. It also contains a cathedra for its Angel (roughly equivalent to Bishop) of the Catholic Apostolic Church. The crossing is made up of roll-moulded arches on clustered columns. The transepts are gabled, with two layers of three lancets below a rose window. The south transept's windows (the originals) are the most notable – the lancets have Christ in Majesty with ranks of saints, apostles and angels and earth below, whilst its rose window is by Archibald Nicholson and has a dove in the centre surrounded by musician angels and cherubim and seraphim. The church's three- bay sanctuary has a roof with stone rib-vaulting and foliated bosses, along with a sanctuary lamp by Augustus Pugin. The three-bay Lady Chapel (formerly the English Chapel) is beyond this sanctuary, separated from it by a screen behind the high altar with open traceried window to the chapel. The chapel itself has a richly painted timber roof and stone angel along with an east facade with arcaded lancet windows below a small rose window and gable, along with gabled and pinnacled buttresses. In 1853, a fine organ was erected by Gray and Davison. It was a three manuals organ with pedals, containing 13 stops on the Great-organ, 12 stops on the Swell-organ, 10 stops on the Choir- organ and 8 on the pedal. In total there were 6 couplers. A specification of the organ as it now is can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register. One of the first organists was Edmund Hart Turpin. In 1903 a subb bass 16 ft was added to the choir-organ.Charles William Pearce, A Biographical Sketch of Edmund Hart Turpin, 1911 Annette Peach, in her entry for Brandon in the Dictionary of National Biography, writes: \\"The Catholic Apostolic Church in Gordon Square, London, was built between 1850 and 1854 and, though reproducing features recorded by the Brandon brothers in their scholarly works, this extremely large church was criticized by a contemporary for its lack of originality of design.RIBA Sessional Papers, 10 Recent scholars, however, have drawn attention to the combination of 13th- and 15th-century Gothic precedents in its design, which offer a tangible record of the Brandon brothers' study of ecclesiastical architecture.\\"http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/3264G. Stamp and C. Amery, Victorian buildings of London, 1837–1887: an illustrated guide (1980), 40–41 The church was designated a Grade I listed building on 10 June 1954. University Church From 1963 to 1994, it was known as the University Church of Christ the King and served the Anglican Chaplaincy to the Universities and Colleges of the Diocese of London. In practice it was a worship centre for students living in the university halls nearby, but was also used occasionally for London-wide events, with a very strong emphasis on music in worship (under the successive musical directorships of Ian Hall, Alan Wilson and Simon Over). This new role was begun with a morning Eucharist at which the Bishop of London, the Right Reverend Robert Stopford, celebrated and an Evensong with the former Bishop of London, J. W. C. Wand, preaching), both on 6 October 1963. During this period, a Thanksgiving Eucharist was celebrated on 27 November 1988 for the 25th anniversary of this role, with the Right Reverend Michael Marshall preaching and, on 6 December 1983, the memorial service for Nikolaus Pevsner was held here.Pevsner service – JSTOR access required The last Sunday service was held on 28 June 1992, but a weekday Eucharist continued to be celebrated in the English Chapel. The last chaplaincy service was conducted on Ash Wednesday (16 February) 1994 by the Reverend Alan Walker of the University of Westminster; The Diocese surrendered its lease on the church to the Trustees on 30 June. A popular student venue, the Crypt Café, ran in the basement for several years until that date. Euston Church  right Euston Church, a Church of England Bishop's Mission Order plant, started meeting in the church from September 2015, with services at 10.30am and 5pm. Forward in Faith The Lady Chapel / English Chapel at the east end of the Church is used by the Anglican Forward in Faith movement. Mass is celebrated on each weekday at 12.30pm.

Biography He was born in Vitina, Ljubuški municipality, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kingdom of Yugoslavia to Bosniak parents Šefkija and Selima, from where he moved in 1920 to Fojnica. There he spent most of his youth and always came back regardless of all the other places he went to. After finishing primary school in Fojnica, he started grammar school in Sarajevo, and finished it in 1936. This is when his literary and political work started. In those ages he managed to publish few short stories, and to get arrested for participating in youth strikes. In 1937 he started studying pedagogy at the University of Belgrade Faculty of Philosophy. His literary works started to appear in many papers, but also his political engagement rose. Even before he turned 30 the World War II started. For a year he worked in Fojnica and Sarajevo as illegal cooperator, thus in spring of 1942, one day before joining the partisan army he was arrested in Sarajevo and taken to Jasenovac concentration camp, where he was executed shortly afterwards. Works In his writings, he used authentic Bosnian speech and dialect, spoken by uneducated common situations in their common lives, who were the main protagonists of his works. His most famous story is \\"Majka\\" (mother) where he describes the life of a common woman, her devotion to her family, especially her children. The topic of the story is the death of one of her children, who is suddenly hit by a car. The story explains the whole lot of the life of women and the childhood of a narrator (probably the writer himself, but evident is the usage of Ich form). List of works All Dizdarević's works were published after his death. This is the list of titles and their first editions. List is in Serbo- Croatian, but possible translations into English are also given. There is no record that any of his works are translated into English until today. :Pripovijetke (Svjetlost, Sarajevo, 1948), Short Stories :Prosanjane jeseni (Džepna knjiga, Sarajevo, 1959), The Autumns That were Dreamt Away :Sabrana djela (Svjetlost, Sarajevo, 1968), Collected Works :Blago u duvaru (Zadrugar, Sarajevo, 1983), Treasure in the Wall Adaptations Dizdarević's story \\"Blago u duvaru\\" was adapted into film under the same name by Aleksandar Jevđević in 1975 for TV Sarajevo.

It took place in autumn 1223, at the southern border of Volga Bulgaria. The Bulgars retreated and the Mongols pursued them. Then the main Bulgar forces ambushed the Mongols. Background Timeline for the Expedition of Subutai and Jebe (the Mongol reconnaissance of the western steppes) • 12 January 1221, Muhammad II of Khwarezm Shah of Khwarezm dies on the run from the Mongols on the island of Abeskum during Jenghiz Khan’s destruction of the Khwarezmid Empire campaign • Jenghiz Khan summons his general Subutai to Samarkand upon hearing the news of the Shah’s death; Subutai gives a report on how best to defeat the new Shah, Jalal ad-Din (Muhammed’s son); Subutai requests not to be part of the final campaign and proposes to reconnoiter the west bank of the Caspian Sea and the steppes beyond - Jenghiz accepts this plan and assigns two tumens (20,000 men) to Subutai and his other best general, Jebe, under the condition that the campaign not take more than two years and that on their return march they find and join with the Khan’s son Jochi in the east to engage the Volga Bulgars • Subutai rejoins Jebe at their camp near the Caspian (delta of the Kura river) - the “reconnaissance in force” begins at the end of February 1221 • the Mongols invade Georgia and annihilate George IV of Georgia’s much larger forces on the plain of Khuman • the Mongols sack Margha and Hamadan • the Mongols move into Georgia again towards Derbend and are attacked by King George IV with another army - the Mongols destroy it and George IV escapes with only his rearguard • the Mongols cross the Caucasus with great hardship in winter to the Fergana valley and are to find a 50,000 man army waiting for them of Cumans assembled by their khagan Kotian and his Bulgar, Khazar, and Avar allies under the command of Kotian’s brother Yuri and son Daniel • the Mongols engage the Cumans but can make no headway due to their unfavorable position and they withdraw - the Mongols resort to bribing the Cumans with half of their spoils taken from Georgia if they will join them - the Cumans agree but after taking payment they break camp under darkness and leave their allies • the Mongols attack and destroy the remaining Cuman allied forces and impress those survivors considered useful into their army • the Mongols with great speed overtake the Cumans who had fled towards Astrakhan on the Volga and extirpate them - both Yuri and Daniel are killed and the Cumans massacred to a man - the Mongols recover their treasure used in the ‘bribe’ - on news of this defeat many Cumans flee west to the borders of Hungary and the Byzantine Empire's trading station on the Sea of Azov • the Mongols sack Astrakhan • Subutai and Jebe split their force - Jebe marches west to the river Don to await Subutai who marches south to the Sea of Azov to ensure the Cumans cannot threaten their expedition from the rear - Subutai's force destroys the towns along the shore and what Cumans they find and meet Venetian merchants from Europe for the first time - he makes a pact with them to destroy Genoese trading posts in exchange for information on the West and military intelligence on the kingdoms there • Jebe makes an alliance with the chief of the Brodniki, Polskinia, and 5,000 Brodniki troops join his forces on the Don • Subutai destroys the Genoese trading station of Soldaia (Sudak) on the Crimea, then rejoins Jebe - their army now has perhaps 25,000 men - they march unopposed to the Dniester river • Autumn and Winter 1222, the Mongol army marches up and down the Dniester using terror tactics to maintain security from attack - scouting parties are sent as far west as possible to gather military intelligence on southern Russia and the states along the borders of the Carpathian mountains • their objective completed, the Mongols begin the march home to Mongolian territory • Kotian had fled north with the remnants of such Cumans as he could and was pleading for an alliance with the Russian princes against the Mongols - at a conference the Russian princes of Galicia (Mstislave the Daring), his son-in-law Daniel of Volynia, Prince Oleg of Kursk, and the Princes of Kiev and Chernigov agree to join Kotian to stop the Mongols - Duke Yuri of Suzdal promises to send an army under the command of his nephew the Prince of Rostov - the nominal strength of this allied force was 80,000 men • the Mongols are aware via their spies and scouts that a military action is being planned against them - the allied Russian and Cuman forces are approaching from several directions • the Mongols cross the Dnieper where the expected rendezvous with Jochi does not take place - Jochi is supposedly ill in the east and is delayed • the Mongols send ambassadors to the Princes of Chernigov and Kiev to attempt peace - the Russians kill the ambassadors - a second Mongol embassy arrives to declare war • the Mongols were still under the Khan's orders to suppress the Volga Bulgars, but this cannot be safely done with enemies in their rear - the elimination of the Russian threat was a military necessity • Subutai and Jebe leave 1,000 men under the command of Hamabek on the east bank of the Dnieper to delay the Russian crossing for as long as possible - this rearguard was able to inflict heavy casualties but was eventually overwhelmed and destroyed and Hamabek was captured and executed • May 1223, the Mongols are slowly retreating over land they had excellent knowledge of north of the Sea of Azov - their mobility allowed them to easily outpace the Russian forces but they had decided on a confrontation with them - on 31 May 1223 they stopped along the western side of the river Kalka (Kalmyus) • Battle of the Kalka River - the Mongol forces, numbering at this point perhaps 23,000 - exterminate the combined Cuman- Russian armies - some 40,000 Russian and Cuman soldiers are killed - the Mongol tactics and weaponry, with which the Russians had no prior experience, are superior to the rather unorganized assault by the allied armies - the Mongols pursue the remnants of the allied forces to the Dneiper • the Prince of Kiev had retreated with his army mostly intact back to the Dnieper, not having been part of the reckless charges at Kalka; however they were overtaken by the Mongols and eventually massacred in their fortified camp • the Prince of Rostov stopped and returned with his army to Suzdal upon the news of the defeat at Kalka to prepare for an attack, but it never came - the Mongols had resumed their march east John Chambers, The Devil's Horsemen: The Mongol Invasion of Europe, Atheneum, 1979. p. 17-30Rene Grousset, The Empire of the Steppes, Barnes & Noble with Rutgers Univ. Press, 1970. p. 245-247David Morgan, The Mongols, Blackwell Cambridge MA & Oxford UK, 1986. p. 71 This Mongol campaign had killed perhaps as many as 200,000 soldiers of various nations and never lost a major battle. At this point in history, the Mongol army was the finest army in the world - it was professional, extremely well trained and equipped, a Mongol rose through the ranks based on his merit rather than his position in Mongol society, and generals such as Jebe and Subutai along with the Great Khan had developed revolutionary tactics all controlled with iron discipline. Its mobility was unmatched by any other military force. The utilization of the Mongolian horse (steppe pony) allowed for survival of their steeds in areas where other horses would starve or die from conditions. The Mongol commanders also realized the quality of their army and were not impressed by the mere size of the opposing forces of their enemies. In this way they could stand and hold, and their various tactics would often cause an enemy to break and retreat in a panic that inevitably lead to a rout from Mongol mounted archers and lancers. They often employed siege engines and engineers from China and Persia in their ranks to enable them to take fortified cities - however, this would not have been practical on the fast-campaign of Jebe/Subutai.Stephen Turnbull, Ghenghis Khan & The Mongol Conquests, 1190-1400, Osprey Publishing, 2003. This was the army now marching to face the Bulgars on the Volga. The Volga Bolgars/Bulgars had built up a powerful state in the second half of the 7th century between the Sea of Azov and the Kuban valley. They were apparently of Turkic origin and related to the Kutrigur Huns. Some of them migrated to Europe, forming an empire there in the Balkans. The rest slowly moved northward in the direction of Kama and Kazan to found Great Bulgaria.Rene Grousset, The Empire of the Steppes, Barnes & Noble with Rutgers Univ. Press, 170. p. 176 The Volga Bulgars on the Volga-Kama region embraced Islam in 922, becoming an important trade center between the Islamic world and Europe. The Volga Bulgars formed a settled civilisation with towns and Islamic culture till the Mongol invasion. Although there were peaceful relations with Kievan Rus in the 10th and 11th centuries, the principality of Vladimir-Suzdal was expanding its domain on the middle Volga during the 12th century, and their attempts to monopolize the Volga trade resulted in hostilities with the Volga Bulgars. Various Bulgar towns and villages were conquered by the Russians - Brjahimov (old Bulgar), which forced the Bulgars to establish a new capital at Bilar (Biljarsk, Biler), and eventually the most important Bulgar town on the eastern side of the Volga, Osel, was captured.Zimonyi Istvan: \\"History of the Turkic speaking peoples in Europe before the Ottomans\\". The lectures include the history of the Turkic speaking peoples of Eastern Europe from the Huns to Kipchaks 4-14th century. The Bulgar state had been weakened by these conquests. Battle During the mopping-up operations of the Mongols on the Dnieper, a messenger arrived from the Great Khan ordering Subutai and Jebe to return to the Volga River, locate Jochi, and return with him to Mongolia.John Chambers, The Devil's Horsemen: The Mongol Invasion of Europe, Atheneum, 1979. p. 30 According to historian John Chambers, \\"The delayed arrival of the reinforcements which were at last advancing towards the Volga and the absence of Jochi from a preliminary briefing with his father had not been due to illness. Jochi was an imaginative and determined commander, as his campaigns in Khwarizm had shown, but his headstrong independence had made him unreliable . . . He (the Khan) had hoped that under the influence of his two most distinguished generals Jochi might return to (the Khan's) camp where they could flaunt a family loyalty that would crush any hope of intrigue (by Jochi's detractors.)\\" Jochi brought a single tumen (10,000 men) to reinforce the army of Jebe/Subutai, meeting on the west bank of the Volga. The old directive was no longer in force per the orders from the messenger, but the return journey home gave them the opportunity to reconnoiter the north-western boundaries of the Mongol Empire. They reduced the Bulgars on the west bank of the Volga before an attack was made further north. The entire historical record of the Battle of Samara Bend consists of a short account by the Muslim historian Ibn al-Athir, writing in Mosul some away from the event. According to the expert-opinion of historian Peter Jackson,Email inquiry October 15, 2012 to Professor Peter Jackson the most accurate translation of the passage is contained in D.S. Richards' book, The Chronicle of Ibn al-Athir for the Crusading Period from al-Kāmil fī’l-ta'rīkh. Part 3: The Years 589–629/1193–1231, The Ayyūbids after Saladin and the Mongol Menace., vol.3, quoted below: deel. Account of the Tatars' return from the lands of the Rus and the Qipjaq to their ruler After the Tatars had treated the Rus as we have described and plundered their country, they withdrew and went to the Bulghars in the year 620 [1223-1224]. When the Bulghars heard of their approach, they laid ambushes for them in several places. They then marched out to engage them and drew them on until they had passed the ambush site. They emerged behind their backs, so that they were caught in the middle. They fell to the sword on every side. Most of them were killed and only a few escaped. There is another version, however. They numbered about four thousand and they set out for Saqsin on the way back to their ruler, Chingiz Khan. The lands of the Qipjaq became free of them and the survivors returned home. Some less-recent sourcesDe Hartog, Genghis Khan: Conqueror of the World, B.Tauris, London, 1988, p.122-123 speculate about the losses in this battle, but in Peter Jackson's expert-opinion, the second passage relates to the size of Jebe/Subutai's army, not the number of Mongol \\"survivors\\" from the ambush - however, there is no mention in the alternative tale of any encounter with the Bulgars. In this history, no mention is made of who commanded the military probe that was ambushed, or how large it was. Historian A.H. Halikov identifies the Bulgarian army commander as Ilgam Khan.A.H. Halikov, Kazan: Publishing house, 1994, p. 24 Based on the record of Jebe and Subutai's entire careers, masters of ambush themselves, a military conundrum exists in that a weakened Bulgar state would be able to defeat them. However, if Jochi was in command, it may be significant that upon the return of the Mongol force to Mongol territory, Jochi entered his father's tent, interrupting an audience, knelt before the throne, and placed Jenghiz's hand upon his forehead, the Mongol stance for utter submission.John Chambers, The Devil's Horsemen: The Mongol Invasion of Europe, Atheneum, 1979. p. 31 Various historical secondary sources - Morgan, Chambers, Grousset - state that the Mongols actually defeated the Bulgars, Chambers even going so far as to say that the Bulgars had made up stories to tell the (recently crushed) Russians that they had beaten the Mongols and driven them from their territory. Whatever the case, after this battle the Mongols skirted the Urals defeating the Saxin tribes there and then moved south to defeat the eastern Cumans- Kipchaks-Kanglis, where their army was destroyed and their khagan killed; subsequently they were forced to pay a large tribute to the Mongols. This would hardly have been possible if the Mongol force had been severely damaged at the Battle of Samara Bend. Numbers The details about the Bulgar ambush have not survived. Aftermath The reverse (if one indeed occurred) at the \\"Battle of Samara Bend\\" did not stop the Mongol expedition from reducing the Saxin tribes and defeating the Kanglis afterwards. Laden with tribute, the Mongols then returned home. However, Jebe Noyan - one of the Khan's greatest generals and friends - died of a fever on the Imil River in Tarbagatai on the journey. In 1236, the Mongols under Batu and Subutai returned to Bulgaria and made it part of the Mongol Empire.  References   Bibliography  * История Татарстана, Казань, \\"ТаРИХ\\", 2001.

It was the first, maybe only, game released by this company. The game is set on the continent of Disia in the fantasy world Draimia, the company's trademark setting. The game can be played by two or more players, although the typical game is played with four players. Each game represents a battle between armies in the Bautadon stadium in the land of Grytland. Each player builds and controls an army of one to five characters, represented by character cards. Additional arena cards represent spells, artifacts and strategies that are played upon the players' own cards or on cards in opponents' armies.  Game play  Draim Arena is played with several different rule sets; two basic rule sets are presented on the official website, and two additional tournament setups for each rule set. The two rule sets are called 9-card and 30-card, based on the number of cards used. Most of the rules are common to both rule sets and the difference is primarily the number of cards in the deck. In the game players put armies against each other and the player whose army is defeated loses the game, the winner is the player that in the end stands alone. The armies are built one character at a time, a player cannot attack opponents during a turn that a new character is added to the army and players therefore have to balance play between reinforcing the army and playing aggressively to defeat opponents. The use of character cards are central to the game; these form the army and are required, in order to play arena cards. Each character can take damage two times, the first time they are turned, and the second they are dead and put in the grave. Cards in the grave cannot be used during the rest of the same game. Turned characters can be healed, either by the use of certain arena cards or by turning another character in your own army during phase two. This last choice prevents that same player from attacking or playing a character card that turn, however and this should therefore be considered. Game play is built around four phases that divide each player's turn. These four phases allow different actions and card types to be played. Every time a player starts a turn it begins with phase one and continues through all four until the turn is over and next player starts. The phases allow the following:1. play phase 1 arena cards. 2. play a new character card, switch places between two characters, heal a character or attack a player. 3. preparation for battle (only in case of attack during phase 2). 4. battle (only in case of attack during phase 2). If attack is chosen during phase two a special tactical die is used to decide which character in the attacking and the defending armies will fight. The fight during phase four is primarily decided with the use of another die, called battle die. The use of dice has been compared with pencil- and-paper Role-playing games and set this game apart from most other card games. 9-card In this rule set each player build a deck of nine cards, with a free mix of character cards and arena cards. All cards are played in the hand from the start and can therefore be played at any time. 30-card In this rule set each player uses a total of 30 cards. 25 arena cards and 5 character cards. The major difference from 9-card play is that all arena cards are put in a library from start and are therefore not available to play. To make the cards in the library available the player has to do one of two things, either turning a character in phase one and draw one card from the library or by killing a character in an opponent army. Tournament play Two different tournament formats are used in official play; emperor and conqueror. The difference between them are basically that emperor is a format with pre-made decks and conqueror is a variation of sealed deck. During play in conqueror format some changes are applied, primarily concerning how many instances of each card and card type can be used.  Deck building  Like in other Trading card games, deck building is a central part of the strategy of the game, since this offers a chance to build a unique deck and surprise your opponents. Depending on which type of game you prefer, 9 or 30 cards, the setup of the deck can vary greatly. The use of arena cards is often more central in play with 30 cards. In 30-cards, the deck may only include one of each character and two of each arena card. 9-card, only allows one instance of each card. During tournaments in the conqueror format, there is no limit to this, and a deck can have any number of each card. The deck however cannot be bigger than 20 cards in this format.  Story background  The game is set in a fantasy world called Draimia. Like other comparable fantasy worlds such as Middle- earth, this is a high fantasy setting, featuring a number of different creatures and species unique to this world. The game also features an open use of magic and enchanted artifacts that enhance characters in a number of ways. The company behind the game posted on their now-defunct Swedish official website that a number this world would be used for a number of other properties, such as comic books, a board game and a Role-playing game. The story behind the game was meant to be released a bit at a time, so that players would find out more about it as it progressed.

Almost all of his works were written jointly with Alexandre Chatrian under the name Erckmann-Chatrian. Ėmile Erckmann (left) with Alexandre Chatrian Life =Youth= He was born in Phalsbourg (Moselle), in Lorraine, and matured there. His mother died in 1832 and he was sent to boarding school. He obtained his baccalaureat at Nancy before studying law at Paris from 1842. His first published work was Du recrutement militaire (\\"On military recruitment\\", 1843). Two years later he failed his third year of law and returned to Phalsbourg, ill with typhoid, where in the spring of 1847 he made the acquaintance of Alexandre Chatrian, a teacher. They became friends and spent their summer holidays together. While staying at Paris, Erckmann witnessed the Revolution of 1848: inspired, they founded a political society in Phalsbourg and a short-lived newsletter at Strasbourg. Their politics were republican and nationalistic. At the beginning of the 1850s they began publishing in Le Démocrate du Rhin, expecting quick success, but after several years they became disillusioned. A play performed at Strasbourg in 1850, L'Alsace en 1814, was banned after just two performances. Erckmann moved to Rosny-sous-Bois and resumed his study of law in 1854. His father, Jean-Philippe, died in February 1858. =Success= Recognition came in 1859 and they became well known as fantasy writers under the joint pseudonym of Émile Erckmann-Chatrian. (Tales of supernatural horror by the duo that are famous in English include \\"The Wild Huntsman\\" (tr. 1871), \\"The Man-Wolf\\" (tr. 1876) and \\"The Crab Spider\\"). They moved together to Paris, where they lived close to the east railway station and returned frequently to Lorraine. By 1868, Erckmann was wealthy enough to buy back the sawmill at Grosshammerweyer. In the same year the publisher Hetzel bought exclusive rights to their work. In August 1870, Erckmann was at Phalsbourg at the time of Mac-Mahon's defeat. With the Franco-Prussian War, the works of the two lorrains gained a popularity which was closely related to nationalistic desires for revenge and nostalgia for the \\"blue line of the Vosges\\" (i.e. the return of Alsace-Lorraine from Germany to France). From 1872, Erckmann spent most of his time on the novels while Chatrian busied himself with their plays: it is likely that the joint pseudonym was now appearing on works that were no longer composed jointly. In September, Erckmann moved into a house at Saint- Dié, owned by the Goguel family, and the following year he went on a tour of the eastern Mediterranean: Egypt, Libya, Syria and Greece. Political entanglements started to make life difficult: he met Victor Hugo in 1874 as a result of his republican enthusiasms. He was forced to sell the sawmill in 1877. =Later years= In 1881 the Goguels complained about his relationship with their stewardess, Emma Flotat, and the couple moved out temporarily to Toul, where Erckmann became very ill with jaundice. The next year, German authorities gave Erckmann permission to travel to Phalsbourg. The last work signed Erckmann-Chatrian was L’Art et les grands idéalistes (1885). In 1886 Erckmann refused to sign a new contract that had been negotiated by Chatrian with their publisher, Hetzel. On 13 March 1887, Chatrian, at this time battling mental illness, wrote to Erckmann that he was paying ghost-writers out of their common royalties. This was the end of their association and their friendship. In 1888 Erckmann was diagnosed with diabetes, and the year after, his visa expired. No longer allowed to reside in his home town, he moved to Lunéville where he stayed until his death in 1899. Chatrian predeceased him in 1890. Works by Erckmann alone *Essai sur le remplacement militaire (1844) After the death of Chatrian, Erckmann published: *Kaleb et Khora (1891) *La Campagne du Grand-père Jacques (1892) *Alsaciens et Vosgiens d’autrefois (1895) *Fables alsaciennes et vosgiennes (1895)  External links  * Erckmann-Chatrian, first Website entirely dedicated to the Lives and Works of Erckmann-Chatrian (in French).

The station plays national and local alternative music as well as jazz all day on Sunday. It is owned by Louisville Public Media. History The station was founded in 1954 by the Louisville Free Public Library as a classical music station. It was a sister station to WFPL. In 1975, the station received the entire inventory of classical music recordings from WHAS-FM (now WAMZ-FM), which had discontinued the format after a nine-year run. In 1993, the Free Public Library and the University of Louisville's WUOL-FM (which had competed against WFPK for classical listeners for over 15 years) joined forces to form the Public Radio Partnership, now Louisville Public Media. At that time, WFPK adopted its current format. Programming WFPK hosts the weekly series Live Lunch, which features local and national acts performing live in front of a studio audience in the station's performance studio. Guests of Live Lunch have included Tommy Emmanuel, Will Oldham, Alejandro Escovedo, The Subdudes, Jonatha Brooke, The Decemberists, Over the Rhine, The Derek Trucks Band, Amos Lee, Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros and local Louisville bands My Morning Jacket, The Muckrakers and Digby. In 2007, the station released Best of WFPK Live Vol. 1, a limited-edition CD that contained recordings from the series; the disc was given away as an exclusive premium for new members during the spring 2007 membership drive. Since then, it has released 10 more member-exclusive CDs containing more live songs recorded during Live Lunch and other in-studio performances. A very popular weekend show, Woody's Roadhouse (12 mid-6am Saturday) specializes in heritage R&B;, C&W;, Blues, Rockabilly and classic Southern Quartet Gospel.

The photographs he produced during his visit to the colony in 1851 ranged in subject from antiquities and landscapes to portraits, court- photography, model studies and nudes. His monograph was published in black and white with a coloured quire of nearly 400 photographs. His photograph of Borobudur was the first picture of the monument that showed the results of the first restoration c. 1873. Early life Isidore van Kinsbergen was born in Bruges in 1821 (at that time, Bruges was part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands). Having studied painting and singing in Paris, he joined a French opera group that travelled to Batavia (the present day Jakarta) in 1851. After several performances the group left the Dutch East Indies, but Van Kinsbergen decided to stay there. He became interested in the new medium of photography, particularly in using the albumen print technique. He opened the first albumen print processing shop in Batavia. Commissions In 1862, the General Secretary of East Indies Alexis Loudon invited van Kinsbergen to join the government mission to Siam (present day Thailand) in February 1862 to cover the 1860 Treaty of Friendship, Trade and Navigation between the Netherlands and Siam. It was van Kinsbergen's first government assignment and he used the occasion to capture a number of curiosities in the country. During that period, the Batavia Society of Arts and Sciences, whose main interests were in archaeological research and conservation, became interested in the newly invented albumen print medium. The society felt that the world should know more about Javanese culture as expressed in the old inscriptions, statues, customs and temples. The Society arranged an archaeological tour around Java, headed by J.F.G. Brumund, a priest of the Batavian Evangelic Community and a specialist in Javanese. The Society also commissioned van Kinsbergen to accompany Brumund during his tour in order to illustrate Brumund's publication of Javanese culture and antiquities. The government granted permission for this tour, with the restriction that all wet-prints (cliches) would be government property and that extra printing would only be allowed with permission from the government. As part of his contract with the Batavian Society, van Kinsbergen had to take photographs of Borobudur, which had just been cleaned and restored. However, when he went to photograph the Panataran Hindu temple complex in East Java in 1867, he ran out of chemicals. In his enthusiasm for photographing the many reliefs of the temple complex, he used up so many glass slides that he could not go to Borobudur as he had intended to. The Society was nervous about van Kinsbergen's delay, so they did not grant his request to supply new slides. However, van Kinsbergen's photographs satisfied the Society and he became renowned as \\"the Society's Photographer\\". His work on repairing the system for managing water flow during his trip in the Dieng Plateau in order to photograph the Javanese Hindu temple there was avidly praised by the Society. The board then decided that van Kinsbergen was no longer obliged to follow Brumund's directions, but should pursue his own vision. Brumund published his work in 1868, but without the full illustrations of van Kinsbergen. Later in 1872, van Kinsbergen published photographs of monuments in Java, but he was criticized for missing some important ruins, for instance, those in the east of Kediri. Although Brumund's publication included drawings of Borobudur, the Batavia Society still felt that it was incomplete. In April 1873, van Kinsbergen set off to the monument. Cleaning, digging and other technical difficulties delayed his start in taking pictures until August that year. The wet monsoon season further hampered his work, resulting in a series of only 43 photographs taken between August to December. The Society was disappointed with the number of photographs, although satisfied with the printing and artistic quality. Photographic styles Isidore van Kinsbergen was known as a perfectionist. During his work in Borobudur, he selected the statues and panels which had been preserved best to take pictures of. He preferred a non-frontal angle, which shows a better depth of the relief and the skills of the relief maker. To stress its timeless beauty, van Kinsbergen blocked out the original background in the negative film instead of putting up a black curtain during photographing. There are some criticisms of van Kinsbergen's photographs. He missed some details and sometimes his series was unbalanced. Trained as an artist, his works lacked archaeological descriptions, the main purpose of his contract. The printing quality, however, is beyond question and he had success showing the beauty of classical Javanese arts. His photographs were shown to the public both in the 1873 International Exhibition in Vienna and the 1878 World Exhibition in Paris. His works can be seen in several places, including the National Museum in Amsterdam.

He was born near Massillon, Ohio and attended Massillon Washington High School, where he played as a back on the football team under head coach Paul Brown. James was a key part of a Massillon team that went undefeated in 1940. After graduating, he followed Brown to Ohio State and played there as a halfback. Ohio State won its first national championship in 1942 when James was on the team. After a three-year stint in the U.S. Army during World War II, James returned to play a final season at Ohio State in 1946. He then signed with the Detroit Lions of the National Football League (NFL), where he stayed for a year before rejoining Brown, who had become head coach of the Cleveland Browns in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC). James spent eight seasons in Cleveland, playing as a defensive halfback on five championship teams, including two in the AAFC in the late 1940s and three in the NFL in the 1950s. He left football after playing briefly for the Baltimore Colts in 1956. Later in life, he worked as a salesman at a trucking company. He died in 2007. High school and college James grew up in Genoa, a small community in between Canton, Ohio and Massillon, Ohio. The oldest of five children, one of his younger brothers included Don James, a Hall of Fame coach for Kent State and the University of Washington. He attended grammar school there through the eighth grade, but the town did not have a high school and students could choose to attend either Massillon Washington High School or the rival Canton McKinley High School. James at first decided to attend Canton, but Bud Houghton, an assistant coach of Massillon's football team, saw him playing in an informal scrimmage on a street corner and convinced him to come to Massillon. He played football there for three years under head coach Paul Brown. Playing as a back, James was part of a Massillon team that went undefeated in 1940. He scored a touchdown in a 28–0 victory over Toledo's Waite High School, the biggest game of the year; Massillon came into the matchup having won 30 games in a row, while Waite had won 18 straight. James attended Ohio State University starting in 1941, the same year Brown was hired as the school's head football coach. He played on the freshman team in his first year, moving to the varsity team in 1942. Ohio State finished the season with a 9–1 win–loss record and won its first-ever college football national championship. James, who played as a halfback, was injured in a late-season game against the University of Illinois. This caused him to miss Ohio State's annual game against arch-rival Michigan, but he returned for the final game of the season against Iowa Pre-Flight, a military squad. James ran for a 54-yard touchdown on that game's first play and later added a punt return for a touchdown as Ohio State won 41–12. James enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1943 and served for three years during World War II. He returned to Ohio State in 1946 and played on the varsity team again. The Buckeyes finished with a 4–3–2 record under coach Paul Bixler. Professional career James signed with the National Football League's (NFL) Detroit Lions in 1947. He was still eligible to play in college at the time, but wartime rules allowed him to skip to the professional ranks and play for the Lions, who had selected him in the 1947 NFL Draft. James broke his arm in the second game of the season, and he sat on the sidelines for the rest of the year. Detroit did not renew his contract, and the Cleveland Browns of the All-America Football Conference (AAFC), a team coached by Paul Brown, picked him up. He started at right defensive halfback in 1948 opposite Tommy Colella and intercepted four passes as the Browns went 15–0 and won the All-America Football Conference championship. Brown was pleasantly surprised by his abilities on defense. \\"Tommy always was a pretty good man on defense at Massillon and Ohio State\\", he said in 1948. \\"But his play this year has even surprised those of us who knew him in high school and college. I think we're definitely improved at defensive right half over last year.\\" James continued to be a key defensive player for the Browns in 1949, when the team won another AAFC championship behind a staunch defense and an offense led by quarterback Otto Graham and fullback Marion Motley. The AAFC dissolved after the season, however, and the Browns moved to the NFL. Cleveland's first year in the NFL was the best of James's career: he intercepted nine passes, setting a club record that stood until 1978. The team finished the season with a 10–2 record and beat the Los Angeles Rams to win the NFL championship. James made an interception in the game. He also held the ball for placekicker Lou Groza on the game-winning field goal with under a minute to play. Cleveland reached the championship in each of the ensuing three years, but lost each time, once to the Rams and twice to the Detroit Lions. James intercepted five passes and recovered two fumbles in 1953 and was selected for the Pro Bowl, the NFL's annual all-star game. The Browns went on to win the NFL championship again in 1954 and 1955. James was moved from defensive halfback to safety in 1955 later in his career and was hampered by injuries. Brown released the 33-year-old James on waivers before the 1956 season, which allowed other teams to pick up his contract. Brown said it was \\"one of the toughest things I've had to do in football\\" because of the effort James put out. James had worked in the offseason as a sporting goods salesman and had an offer to join a trucking firm, but said he wanted to continue his football career for one more year. He was picked up by the Baltimore Colts but left the team in October after injuring his shoulder. He ended his NFL career with 34 interceptions, all with the Browns, tying him for eighth place in team history. Later life and death After his football career, James worked in the trucking business as a salesman, retiring at age 69. He had three sons, Tom, who resides in Michigan, Robert, who also went into the trucking business, and Mike who became the head track coach at Massillon Washington. James died in 2007 of congestive heart failure.

From the darkness of the fallout, mutants and a race of vampires known as the Nobility have spawned. They rule the weak with no remorse. Once bitten by a Nobility, one is cursed to become a member of the undead. Villagers cower in fear, hoping and praying for a savior to rid them of their undying nightmare. All they have to battle this danger is a different kind of danger – a Vampire Hunter. Enter D – a lone, mysterious Vampire Hunter sought out by the desperate Doris Lang. Bitten by the vampire lord Count Lee, Doris is destined to her eternal fate… Can D deliver her from her curse and bring her to salvation, or will she forever be part of the unholy dead? Differences between the novel and film While the story remains intact, the manga takes some liberties with the narrative and character designs. Larmica returns to being blonde, but Doris is depicted with Red hair in the colored splash page after the cover. Certain events are shuffled around while others are slightly changed to take place at the same time as another. In the original Novel, Greco is killed by Larmica, but in the manga he is fatally wounded by Rei Ginsei (much like in the film). D's fight against Golem, Gimlet and Chullah remains the same as the novel (though Chullah may have survived this time around) while his triumph over Rei is slightly different (in the novel, D exploited Rei Ginsei's powers to finish the mutant, while in the manga he severs Rei's other hand, causing him to be decapitated by his own shrike blade). The ending appears to take elements from both the novel and film, in which D is seen safe and sound, leaving on horse back (in the novel, he doesn't appear after his conversation with Larmica-the film has Doris and Dan bidding their bodyguard farewell). D left his pendant in the care of Dan, not even returning to retrieve it after he vanquishes Count Lee.

Inaugurated by King Charles XIV John and still officially carrying his name, it was designed by the architect Fredrik Blom as a neoclassical octahedral temple inspired by the Pantheon in Rome, borrowing the coffered ceiling while substituting the oculus for the temple-shaped lantern light. On all sides, the plain white walls restored in 1998 are pierced by portals whose four pillars support semi-circular lunettes. Inside the cruciform exterior, the interior sheet of the wooden double cupola is supported by paired doric columns and rounded arches. Accompanying the painted altarpiece are niches with statues of the apostles and two plaster groups.

Its stated goal was to bring \\"an end to tyranny and the establishment of a constitutional and democratic legitimacy\\" to Libya. The NCLO was formed in 2005 and helped to organize some of the initial protests which led to the Libyan Civil War. Background In May 2005, the Organizing Committee for the National Conference of the Libyan Opposition held a series of weekly meetings to discuss and develop an agenda for a conference \\"to put together practical approaches for following up on many efforts made by various Libyan political groups and individuals in their challenge of the Libyan dictatorship\\" of Muammar Gaddafi. The National Conference for the Libyan Opposition was formed on 26 June 2005 in London. Composed primarily of opposition advocates and activists living outside Libya, the Conference met sharing three demands: ::#The relinquishing of all Colonel Muammar Gaddafi’s revolutionary, political, military and security powers; ::#The formation of a transitional government run by individuals who are recognized of being trustworthy and have the capabilities to run the country for a period no longer than one year, in order to bring the country back into constitutional life; and ::#Establishment of a constitutional and democratic state built on key concepts such as political and cultural diversity and peaceful transition of government powers; a state that guarantees fundamental freedom and human rights, that establishes the rule of law, equality and equal opportunity to all Libyan citizens without any form of discrimination; that protects and develops national resources, and endows balanced foreign relations built on mutual respect. Following the 2005 Conference, the NCLO agreed on a mission to call for a medium to address the Libyan people and the need to create a legal mechanism for prosecuting the leaders of the Gaddafi regime. The Conference has since been using the internet and social networking sites such as Facebook as political tools to organize and garner support. Libyan civil war During the Libyan Civil War, the NCLO aided in organizing the 17 February \\"Day of Rage\\", stating that \\"all\\" groups opposed to Gaddafi both within Libya and in exile planned the protests in memory of the demonstrations in Benghazi on 17 February 2006 that were initially against the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons, but which turned into protests against Gaddafi. The NCLO's website disappeared sometime after the end of the civil war, and the organization is now presumed to have disbanded as its purpose is fulfilled and several of its member groups no longer exist.

Kennedy (−1923), is a full-rigged steel ship moored on the western shore of the islet Skeppsholmen in central Stockholm, Sweden, now serving as a youth hostel. The ship was constructed by the Whitehaven Shipbuilding Company, located at Whitehaven in the English county of Cumberland (present-day Cumbria), and launched in February or March of 1888. Her original owners were Charles E. Martin & Co of Dublin and she was originally known as Dunboyne, after the town of Dunboyne in County Meath, Ireland. Her maiden voyage was from Maryport, Cumberland, to Portland, Oregon, and she subsequently made voyages between Europe, Australia and the west coast of North America.Lloyd's Register of Shipping 1887–8 The Dunboyne was sold to Norwegian owners in 1909, and then sold on to the Swedish shipping company Transatlantic in 1915. Her new owners renamed her G. D. Kennedy, but sold her on the Swedish Navy in 1923. The Navy gave the vessel her present name after the shipbuilder and Vice Admiral Fredrik Henrik af Chapman (1721–1808). She was used as a training ship and as such she made several trips around the world, running aground at Port Aleza, Puerto Rico, on 13 July 1934. Her final voyage was in 1934, but she served as a barracks ship during World War II (1939-1945). In 1947 the Stockholm City Museum saved the ship from being broken up, and since 1949 af Chapman has been managed by the Svenska Turistföreningen (STF, Swedish Tourist Association). It serves as a youth hostel with 285 beds. During 2008 the ship underwent a comprehensive restoration. While the ship was being worked on in a drydock, the adjacent youth hostel Skeppsholmen remained open. Usually, the af Chapman and Skeppsholmen – not to be confused with the islet of the same name, on which both are situated – are run as a single hostel, with the af Chapman offering accommodation and Skeppsholmen housing the reception, a kitchen for guests, and other facilities.

Many 20th century authors entered into the debate, often sharing their ideas in their own fiction and non-fiction writings. History Winslow Homer, The New Novel, 1877 The novel was well-defined by the 19th century. In the 20th century, however, many writers began to rebel against the traditional structures imposed by this form. This reaction against the novel caused some literary theorists to question the relevancy of the novel and even to predict its 'death.' Some of the earliest proponents of the \\"death of the novel\\" were José Ortega y Gasset, who wrote his Decline of the Novel in 1925 and Walter Benjamin in his 1930 review Krisis des Romans (Crisis of the Novel). : Döblin finds fault with the novel, since it focuses on individual characters or in its classic form of the Bildungsroman even recounts the education of the one protagonist. In his critique of the novel as genre, Döblin echoes considerations of both the literary discourse in Germany, which reflects on what has been called the 'crisis of narration', and the philosophical debate on the vanishing subject. In the 1950s and 1960s, contributors to the discussion included Gore Vidal, Roland Barthes, and John Barth.John Barth, \\"The Literature of Exhaustion\\", The Atlantic, 1967 Ronald Sukenick wrote the story The Death of the Novel in 1969. In 1954, Wolfgang Kayser argued that the death of the narrator would lead to the death of the novel - a view that has since been contested by many people. Meanwhile, Alain Robbe-Grillet argued that the novel would be likely to atrophy and die as a literary form if it did not advance beyond 19th century structures; this admonition led to his creation of the New Novel or Nouveau roman. Tom Wolfe in the 1970s predicted that the New Journalism would displace the novel. Italo Calvino is considered to have turned round the question \\"is the novel dead?\\", as \\"is it possible to tell stories that are not novels?\\"Eugenio Bolongaro, Italo Calvino and the Compass of Literature (2003), p. 130. Causes 250px As for causes, Robert B. Pippin connects the 'death of the novel' with the rise of nihilism in European culture. Saul Bellow, discussing Ravelstein which was loosely a portrait of Allan Bloom, commented on a connection to the idea that they are really saying that there are no significant people to write about. On the other hand, David Foster Wallace, The New York Observer, October 13, 1997 connected the 'death of the novel' with the mortality of the post-war generation of American novelists. Will Self discussed the idea of the death of the novel, as a microcosm of the wider debate about the death of the book itself, in relation to the transition from a Gutenberg era of printing to the post-Gutenberg era of the information age. He has even questioned the longevity of the bookshelf, let alone the book. Technological change is often identified as a major possible cause. Anxieties about the disappearance of the book, as well as the novel, have been common throughout the 20th century. Henry Kannberg sees the post-Gutenberg age as being one where the entire morphology of literature may transform as a result of 'hyper-literacy' and the exponential abundance of texts. He argues that there may be a rebirth of the novel, or the birth of a descendant to it. Similar observations were made by Marcus du Sautoy who argued that technology allows for changes to books and novel-writing that are only just beginning to be explored. Critical response Contemporary scholars such as Kathleen Fitzpatrick argue that claims of the novel's death were highly exaggerated, and that such claims often reflect anxiety about changes in the twentieth-century media landscape, as well as more submerged anxieties about social changes within the United States itself.The Anxiety of Obsolescence: The American Novel in the Age of Television (Vanderbilt UP, 2006) For Salman Rushdie, the postwar notion of the 'death of the novel' is one that has tended to exhibit certain First World assumptions based on imperialistic nostalgia.

(Official Appointments and Notices)\\", The Times, 3 January 1842; p. 3; Issue 17870; col E. Trollope returned to Lincolnshire to become vicar of Rauceby in 1841. In 1843, his maternal relative, Sir John Thorold, appointed him to the rectory of Leasingham, Lincolnshire, and he held this living for fifty years. In 1867, he was collated to the archdeaconry of Stow. The high point of his career in the church came in 1877, when he was made Bishop of Nottingham. It was to a large extent the result of Trollope’s hard work as a fundraiser that the new see of Southwell, was established in 1884. Despite Trollope's efforts at the restoration of the Great Hall, next to Southwell Minster,Southwell Minster as a Bishop's Palace, the Ecclesiastical Commissioners thought it unfit for purpose and the first Bishop of Southwell lived for a time at Thurgarton Priory.Thurgarton Though Nottingham was included in the new Diocese of Southwell, Trollope retained the See of Nottingham and remained suffragan bishop for the Diocese of Lincoln until his death. Antiquarian and historical interests Trollope was particularly interested in architecture and antiquities. He became a member of the Lincolnshire Diocesan Architectural Society in 1855, and became its editorial secretary in 1857 and its Chairman in 1867. He was an active writer and researcher with several books and many articles published. He is now mainly remembered as the author of Sleaford and the Wapentakes of Flaxwell and Aswardhurn in the County of Lincoln (1872). He also wrote a life of Pope Adrian IV (1856), a manual of sepulchral memorials (1858), a work on ancient and medieval labyrinths and turf mazes (1858), and genealogies of the Thorold and Trollope families (1874 and 1875). Personal life Trollope married twice, and had two daughters by his first marriage. He died at his home, Leasingham Rectory, on 10 December 1893, and was buried at Leasingham on 14 December.The Times, 1 January 1894; p. 14; Issue 34149; col A \\"Obituary for 1893\\".

Life Gordon was born in New Hampton, New Hampshire, on April 19, 1836. His father, Baptist deacon John Calvin Gordon, was a Calvinist named after John Calvin. His mother was Sally Robinson Gordon. A.J. Gordon was named after Adoniram Judson, a Baptist missionary to Burma who had recently completed a Burmese translation of the Bible. Gordon experienced a Christian conversion at age 15 and thereafter sought to become a pastor. He graduated from Brown University (then a Baptist affiliated school) in 1860 and Newton Theological Institution in 1863. In 1863, he married Maria Hale and became pastor of Jamaica Plain Baptist Church in Roxbury, Massachusetts. In 1869, he became pastor of Clarendon Street Baptist Church in Boston, a fairly affluent church. Under Gordon's leadership, Clarendon Street Church was described as \\"one of the most spiritual and aggressive in America\\". The church is no longer in operation. Gordon became a favored speaker in evangelist Dwight L. Moody's Northfield conventions.Ernest Gordon, Adoniram J. Gordon: A Biography with Letters and Illustrative Extracts Drawn from Unpublished or Uncollected Sermons and Addresses (New York: Fleming H. Revell Co., 1896), 17. Every summer Gordon returned to his hometown in New Hampshire and often preached at the Dana Meeting House. Gordon became suddenly ill with influenza and bronchitis and died at age 59 on February 2, 1895. He is buried in Forest Hills Cemetery. A son, Ernest Barron Gordon, published a biography of his father in 1896, titled Adoniram Judson Gordon, a Biography with Letters and Illustrative Extracts Drawn from Unpublished or Uncollected Sermons and Addresses, which is still in print. College In 1889, with the help and backing of Clarendon Street Church, he founded Gordon Bible Institute and served as its first president. His wife, Maria, was secretary and treasurer until 1908. Gordon's school was founded primarily to train missionaries for work in the Congo. Writings and teachings Gordon edited two hymn books and wrote the hymn tunes for at least fifteen hymns, including \\"My Jesus, I Love Thee,\\" a hymn that has been included in nearly every evangelical hymnal published from 1876 to the present time. In his book The Ministry of the Holy Spirit, Gordon wrote, \\"It seems clear from the Scriptures that it is still the duty and privilege of believers to receive the Holy Spirit by a conscious, definite act of appropriating faith, just as they received Jesus Christ\\" (see Baptism with the Holy Spirit). His most remembered work is probably The Ministry of Healing, a highly revered book on divine healing—physical, mental, and spiritual.Dr. R. A. Torrey Gordon located healing in Christ's Atonement, meaning it was universally available through faith in Christ. He prayed for the sick privately, however, and did not integrate healing into his regular church ministry. The Ministry of Healing became a standard work among early Pentecostals. Quotes One of his most often-quoted sayings still is \\"You can do more than pray after you have prayed, but you cannot do more than pray until you have prayed.\\"More Than 27,000 Great Quotations To Inspire You!

Akan art is known for vibrant artistic traditions, including textiles, sculpture, Akan goldweights, as well as gold and silver jewelry. The Akan people are known for their strong connection between visual and verbal expressions and a distinctive blending of art and philosophy. Akan culture values gold above all other metals, so the artwork and jewelry made of gold reflects a great deal of value, whether it be made for appearance, artistic expression, or more practical trading purposes. Goldweights One of the most popular pieces of Akan art are the Akan goldweights. The gold weights were made of copper, bronze, and brass. They were cast using a method of casting known as lost-wax technique or \\"cire perdue\\". Goldweights were created for economic transactions involving gold. Although it is not clear when the convention of weights were first introduced, scholars suggest that the Akan first traded gold with Muslim merchants from the West African interior, long before European contact. Their weight system correspond to the Islamic weight system of North Africa, and appear to be part of early sub-Saharan trade. The gold weights served a vast amount of roles in their culture and everyday life. Akan goldweights are used as counterbalances on the scales used in gold trade, visual representations of oral tradition, representations of proverbs, as pictographic script in social and political system, and in the knowledge system of the Akan people. Goldweights were used in everyday trade and commerce, as well as in accounting, as a type of fraction or counter. According to the Akan scholar Nitecki, Akan gold weights were \\"created and used like spoken language to commemorate social or historical events or entities, to express philosophical or religious views, aspirations, and dreams, or simply to ask questions, or to express displeasure\\". The Akan pyramids were concrete testimonials to how the artist felt about themselves and major life events and dilemmas such as marriage, children, injustice, and personal and statewide conflicts. There are four major categories of gold weights, based on what was depicted. The first kind of gold weights depict people. The second consist of the local flora and fauna. The third category are likened to man-made objects. The final category are abstract and open for interpretation by individual. Jewelry Akan cultural jewelry has a variety of forms. The Akan people make neck-wear, wrist bands, elbow-wear, knee-wear, and ankle-wear. Gender-specific jewelry includes hat pins and headbands for men and earrings and hairpins for the women.

This skyscraper stands on the site of Victor Horta's Art Nouveau '. (Photo taken from ). In urban planning, Brusselization (UK and US) or Brusselisation (UK variant) (, ) is \\"the indiscriminate and careless introduction of modern high-rise buildings into gentrified neighbourhoods\\" and has become a byword for \\"haphazard urban development and redevelopment\\". The notion applies to anywhere whose development follows the pattern of the uncontrolled development of Brussels in the 1960s and 1970s, that resulted from a lack of zoning regulations and the city authorities' laissez-faire approach to city planning.  Brussels  = From the 1960s to the 1980s = The original Brusselization was the type of urban regeneration performed by the city of Brussels in connection with Expo 58. In order to prepare the city for Expo 58, buildings were torn down without regard either to their architectural or historical importance, high-capacity square office/apartment buildings were built, boulevards were created and tunnels dug. Among the most controversial was the large-scale demolition of townhouses for development of the high-rise business district in the Northern Quarter. All of these changes were designed to quickly increase the number of people working and living in the city and improve transportation. Further radical changes resulted from Brussels's role as the center of the EU and NATO, beginning with the construction of the European Commission headquarters in 1959. The introduction of a high-speed rail network in the 1990s was the latest excuse to speculate on multiple rows of properties for modern office/hotel redevelopment, which led to the razing of neighborhood blocks near Brussels-South railway station. These changes caused outcry amongst the citizens of Brussels and by environmentalist and preservationist organizations. The demolition of Victor Horta's Art Nouveau ' in 1965 was one focus of such protests, (see photograph on right for what now stands on its site), as was the construction of the IBM Tower in 1978. Many architects protested, and it was the architectural world that coined the name Brusselization for what was happening to Brussels. Architects such as and formulated an anti-capitalist urban planning theory, as a rejection of the rampant modernism that they saw overtaking Brussels. = Historical precedent and underpinnings for modernization in Brussels = The 1950s was not the first time that the city had been radically altered by major redevelopment. Two prior sweeping changes to the urban fabric of Brussels were the straight-lined central avenues modeled after Paris, which were created by covering and diverting the Senne river, and the North–South railway connection, which took around 40 years to finish (1911–52) and which had left swaths of the city center filled with debris and craters for decades. Another precedent is the erecting of the Palace of Justice, the largest building in the world constructed in the 1800s. André de Vries asserts that the penchant for heavy-handedness can be traced back to the reign of Leopold II in the late 19th century, and possibly even all the way back to the bombardment of the city by Louis XIV's troops in 1695. \\"There is barely one building still standing\\", he says, \\"from before 1695, with the exception of some churches and the Town Hall\\". Leopold II sought to give Brussels the image of a grand capital city of an imperial/colonial power. By the middle 20th century there was a tacit alliance between urban development entrepreneurs and local government, with a modernist agenda and with their sights set firmly on large- scale development projects. The citizens of Brussels were largely left out of the process. = The 1990s: From Brusselization to façadism = Brusselization in contemporary Bucharest. In the early 1990s laws were introduced restricting the demolition of buildings that were deemed to have architectural or historical significance; and in 1999 the city authorities' urban development plan explicitly declared high-rise buildings to be architecturally incompatible with the existing aesthetics of the city centre. This led to the rise of what was termed ' — the destruction of the whole interior of a historic building while preserving its historic façade. These laws were the Town Planning Act 1991, which gave local authorities the powers to refuse demolition requests on the grounds of historical, aesthetic, or cultural significance, and to designate architectural heritage zones; and the Heritage Conservation Act of 1993, which gave the government of the Brussels Capital Region the power to designate buildings to be protected for historic reasons. However, this system had its deficiencies. Whilst the Capital Region government could designate historic buildings, it was the nineteen municipal authorities within it that were responsible for demolition permits. Not until the introduction of a ' system was this internecine conflict resolved.

The site is approximately 300 feet by 300 feet and is situated on the Kentish Coast in Sandgate, Kent. History Plunkett position In 1793, the French Revolution reached its climax when the Revolutionary Government issued orders to execute King Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette. Two weeks later, on 1 February, the French republic declared war on Great Britain, which then braced itself for invasion. At that time British land-based defences were woefully inadequate as Great Britain had always relied on the Royal Navy for its defence. To prepare for invasion in 1794 British Parliament purchased a large piece of land at Shorncliffe, the obvious place for initial fortifications to be built as it was just 20 miles away from the French coast, so close, in fact, that the locals could see the smoke from the camp fires of Napoleon's waiting army.Time Team Shorncliffe Redoubt, Sandgate, Kent Later further defences were added to the Kent Coast including the 28-mile-long Royal Military Canal, started in October 1804 and finished in June 1805, which stretches from Cliffend to Seabrook.Royal Military Canal Also Martello Towers were built between 1805 and 1808 to bolster the defences.Martello Towers Colonel William Twiss, a military engineer, designed the redoubt. Once built, the site became home to the 43rd (Monmouthshire) Regiment of Foot, 52nd (Oxfordshire) Light Infantry Regiment, the 95th Rifles, and the light infantry brigades who Sir John Moore trained when he was stationed there in 1802. Construction There have been many different maps of the Redoubt through the ages as the site was reshaped and redesigned for different functions and changing military tactics. The one aspect that has always remained the same is the earthwork outer walls. The only slight change made to these was on the seaward side during the Victorian era where the wall was lowered so that the Commandant and his wife could look out to sea. The method of construction of the earthwork walls was totally different from that of earlier earthworks. In earlier walls, the earth was merely dug out and piled so that the wall would be formed (Figure 1). This would lead to the topsoil being at the bottom and the stonier substrate being at the top. This method of construction was optimal before the widespread use of cannon. The design of the Shorncliffe walls was different, and showed careful forethought and engineering (Figure 2). The turf was lifted and put to one side, followed by the topsoil. The stony substrate was then used to create the core of the wall, and a layer of top soil was placed over it and compacted. Then a further layer of stony substrate was added with another layer of top soil to cover it. It is surmised that the turfs were then placed at the bottom of the mound to create extra stability and to promote growth of the grass for protection from the weather. This method of construction leads to a wall with strong foundations better able to withstand cannon fire than previous earthworks. The defensive ditches dug around the Redoubt were about 5 metres deep. With the earthen ramparts beyond, the Redoubt was well defended. Some maps show heavily fortified magazines, but archaeological digs have failed to find them. It turns out that the maps were more guidelines for the construction of a much larger star fort which was never built due to the change of infantry tactics brought forward by Colonel Coote Manningham and Sir John Moore.

In 1680-1750 it was used as an archive, and then as a corn stable until 1794 when rebuilt as a barrack.

He serves as Associate Editor of the Journal of Financial Markets. Sugato completed high school at St. Xavier's School in Calcutta. He graduated from Jadavpur University in Calcutta with a Bachelor of Technology in Chemical Engineering before relocating to the United States for graduate studies. Chakravarty obtained a Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Kentucky, and his PhD in Finance from Indiana University. Career Over his career, Dr. Chakravarty has taught and researched in interdisciplinary fields of psychology, marketing, finance and mathematics. His primary research areas include market microstructure, banking and asset pricing involving stock, options and fixed income securities, and spans both domestic and foreign markets. He is probably best known for his work on the decimalisation of stock prices, insider trading, and stealth trading. At Purdue, he is best known for teaching a Personal Finance course that teaches undergraduates the basic skills of money management, credit, insurance and retirement. The course also covers all popular and current topics and relates them back to the basic principles. The class is structured around a football cliché: \\"Offense wins games but defense wins championships.\\" Professor Chakravarty argues that to win the game of life one needs to have solid offensive and defensive strategies. Investments (including those for retirement) is an offensive strategy while insurance is a defensive strategy. Credit plays the role of good special teams in that a judicious use of credit can move the line of scrimmage from one's 20-yard line to the 45 or 50 yard line and thereby makes it easier to score a personal finance touchdown. The class boasts enrollments of over 400 students every semester and is an elective in almost all majors across the West Lafayette campus. Publications Dr. Chakravarty's research has appeared in leading academic journals, including the Journal of Finance, Journal of Financial Economics, Journal of Business, Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, Journal of Empirical Finance, and the Journal of Financial Markets. His work has been written about in leading newspapers like the Wall Street Journal, Barron's, Investor's Business Daily and many others. His research has also been used as evidence in hearings by the US Congress. Professor Chakravarty's research impact is provided in Google Scholar (https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_A6bNxYAAAAJ) and is upwards of 5732. Teaching Dr. Chakravarty has also been a pioneer in the broad area of student learning in large classrooms. At heart is the commonly reported concern that students are distracted in large auditorium lecture formats commonly employed by all major universities in the US and elsewhere to teach popular classes. Accordingly, Dr. Chakravarty has forged new ground by using social media as a vehicle to encourage student participation and learning through the specific use of a technology known as \\"Hotseat\\" (a variant of Twitter), by opening a simultaneous back channel of communication among students and between the students and the instructor during classroom lectures. Thus, through HotSeat, his students can ask questions or opine on a topic being discussed in real time and engage in a real interaction with the instructor and among fellow students in the room. The details of this ongoing social experiment have been extensively written up in the USA Today, the New York Times, as well as featured in an article in The Chronicle of Higher Education. Awards Professor Chakravarty has won research awards including the Barclay's Global Investors Research Award for the best paper on Australasian Markets (with P. Kalev and L.

Since the middle of the 19th century, the community, counting according to some sources nearly 20% of all Dalmatian population in 1840, suffered from a constant trend of decreasing presenceFor example in the Austrian Census of 1857 the Dalmatian Italians were only 45,000 -or nearly 15% of the Dalmatia without the Quarner islands (read and now numbers only around 1,000–4,000 people. Throughout history, though small in numbers in the last two centuries, it exerted a vast and significant influence on the region. They are currently represented in Croatia and Montenegro by the Italian National Community (Italian: Comunità Nazionale Italiana) (CNI). The Italo-Croatian minorities treaty recognizes the Italian Union (Unione Italiana) as the political party officially representing the CNI in Croatia. The Italian Union represents the 30,000 ethnic Italians of former Yugoslavia, living mainly in Istria and in the city of Rijeka. Following the positive trend observed during the last decade (i.e., after the dissolution of Yugoslavia), the number of Dalmatian Italians in Croatia adhering to the CNI has risen to around one thousand. In Dalmatia the main operating centers of the CNI are in Split, Zadar, and Kotor. History =Roman Dalmatia and the Middle Ages= Roman Dalmatia was fully Latinized by 476 AD when the Western Roman Empire disappearedTheodor Mommsen in his book \\"The Provinces of the Roman Empire\\" During the Barbarian Invasions, Avars allied with certain Slavic tribes, invaded and plundered Byzantine Illyria. This eventually led to the settlement of different Slavic tribes in the Balkans. The original Roman population endured within the coastal cities and in the inhospitable Dinaric Alps. The Dalmatian cities retained their Romanic culture and language in cities such as Zadar, Split and Dubrovnik. Their own Vulgar Latin, developed into the Dalmatian language, a now extinct Romance language. These coastal cities (politically part of the Byzantine Empire) maintained political, cultural and economic links with Italy, through the Adriatic Sea. On the other side communications with the mainland were difficult because of the Dinaric Alps. Due to the sharp orography of Dalmatia, even communications between the different Dalmatian cities, occurred mainly through the sea. This helped Dalmatian cities to develop a unique Romance culture, despite the mostly Slavicized mainland. Map of the Venetian Republic, c. 1000. The Republic is in dark red, borders in light red. In 997 AD the Venetian Doge Pietro Orseolo II, following repeated complaints by the Dalmatian city-states, commanded the Venetian fleet that attacked the Narentine pirates. On the Ascension Day in 998, Pietro Orseolo assumed the title of \\"Dux Dalmatianorum\\" (Duke of the Dalmatians), associating it with his son Giovanni Orseolo. This was the beginning of the Venetian influence in Dalmatia, however, while Venetian influence could always be felt, actual political rule over the province often changed hands between Venice and other regional powers, namely the Byzantine Empire, the Kingdom of Croatia, and the Kingdom of Hungary. The Venetians could afford to concede relatively generous terms because their own principal aims was not the control of the territory sought by Hungary, but the economic suppression of any potential commercial competitors on the eastern Adriatic. This aim brought on the necessity of enforced economic stagnation for the Dalmatian city-states, while the Hungarian feudal system promised greater political and commercial autonomy. In the Dalmatian city states, there were almost invariably two opposed political factions, each ready to oppose any measure advocated by its antagonist. The origin of this division seems here to have been economic. The farmers and the merchants who traded in the interior naturally favoured Hungary, their most powerful neighbour on land; while the seafaring community looked to Venice as mistress of the Adriatic. In return for protection, the cities often furnished a contingent to the army or navy of their suzerain, and sometimes paid tribute either in money or in kind. The citizens clung to their municipal privileges, which were reaffirmed after the conquest of Dalmatia in 1102–1105 by Coloman of Hungary. Subject to the royal assent they might elect their own chief magistrate, bishop and judges. Their Roman law remained valid. They were even permitted to conclude separate alliances. No alien, not even a Hungarian, could reside in a city where he was unwelcome; and the man who disliked Hungarian dominion could emigrate with all his household and property. In lieu of tribute, the revenue from customs was in some cases shared equally by the king, chief magistrate, bishop and municipality. These rights and the analogous privileges granted by Venice were, however, too frequently infringed, Hungarian garrisons being quartered on unwilling towns, while Venice interfered with trade, with the appointment of bishops, or with the tenure of communal domains. Consequently, the Dalmatians remained loyal only while it suited their interests, and insurrections frequently occurred. Zadar was no exception, and four outbreaks are recorded between 1180 and 1345, although Zadar was treated with special consideration by its Venetian masters, who regarded its possession as essential to their maritime ascendancy. The doubtful allegiance of the Dalmatians tended to protract the struggle between Venice and Hungary, which was further complicated by internal discord due largely to the spread of the Bogomil heresy; and by many outside influences, such as the vague suzerainty still enjoyed by the Eastern emperors during the 12th century; the assistance rendered to Venice by the armies of the Fourth Crusade in 1202; and the Tatar invasion of Dalmatia forty years later (see Trogir). =Republic of Venice (1420–1796)= Venetian Republic and the Republic of Ragusa in 1560. In 1409, during the 20-year Hungarian civil war between King Sigismund and the Neapolitan house of Anjou, the losing contender, Ladislaus of Naples, sold his \\"rights\\" on Dalmatia to the Venetian Republic for a meager sum of 100,000 ducats. The more centralized merchant republic took control of the cities by the year 1420 (with the exception of the Republic of Ragusa), they were to remain under Venetian rule for a period of 377 years (1420–1797). The southernmost area of Dalmatia (now part of coastal Montenegro) was called Venetian Albania during that time. In these centuries a process of gradual assimilation took place among the native population. The Romance Dalmatians of the cities were the most susceptible because of their similar culture and were completely assimilated. The Venetian language, which was already the lingua franca of the Adriatic area, was adopted by the Latin Dalmatians of the cities (speakers of the Dalmatian), as their own vernacular language. This process was aided by the constant migration between the Adriatic cities and involved even the independent Dubrovnik (Ragusa) and the port of Rijeka (Fiume) . The Slavic population (mainly Croats) was only partially assimilated, because of the linguistic unsimilarity and because the Slavs were mostly situated in the hinterland and the islands. The Dalmatian language, however, had already influenced the Dalmatian dialect of the Croatian language, the Chakavian dialect, with the Venetian dialect influencing the Albanian language.Bartoli, Matteo. Le parlate italiane della Venezia Giulia e della Dalmazia Starting from the 15th century, Italian replaced Latin as the language of culture in the Venetian Dalmatia and in the Republic of Ragusa. On the other hand, more and more Slavs (Catholic and Orthodox) were pushed into Venetian Dalmatia, to escape the Ottomans. This resulted in an increase of the Slavic presence in the cities. =Napoleonic era (1797–1815)= 1807: Dalmatia inside the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy In 1797, during the Napoleonic wars, the Republic of Venice was dissolved. The former Venetian Dalmatia was included in the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy from 1805 to 1809 (for some years also the Republic of Ragusa was included, since 1808), and successively in the Illyrian Provinces from 1809. In the census of 1808 declared to be Venetians (Italian speaking) about 33% of the Dalmatians, mostly in urban areas. After the final defeat of Napoleon, the entire territory was granted to the Austrian Empire by the Congress of Vienna in 1815. This marked the beginning of 100 years (1815–1918) of Austrian rule in Dalmatia and the beginning of the disappearance of the Dalmatian Italians (who were reduced from nearly 30% in 1815 to just 3% at the end of WW1, due to persecutions, assimilation policies and emigration). =Austrian Empire (1815–1918)= \\"Distribution of Races in Austria–Hungary\\" from the Historical Atlas by William R. Shepherd, 1911. During the period of the Austrian Empire, the Kingdom of Dalmatia was a separate administrative unit. After the revolutions of 1848 and after the 1860s, as a result of the romantic nationalism, two factions appeared. The Autonomist Party, whose political goals of which varied from autonomy within the Austro-Hungarian Empire, to a political union with Italy. The Croatian faction (later called Unionist faction or \\"Puntari\\"), led by the People's Party and, to a lesser extent, the Party of Rights, both of which advocated the union of Dalmatia with the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia which was under Hungarian administration. The political alliances in Dalmatia shifted over time. At the beginning, the Unionists and Autonomists were allied together, against the centralism of Vienna. After a while, when the national question came to prominence, they split. In 1867, the Empire was reorganized as the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Rijeka and the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia were assigned to the Hungarian part of the Empire, while Dalmatia and Istria remained in the Austrian part. The Unionist faction won the elections in Dalmatia in 1870, but they were prevented from following through with the merge with Croatia and Slavonia due to the intervention of the Austrian imperial government. The Austrian century was a time of decline for the Dalmatian Italians. Starting from the 1840s, large numbers of the Italian minority were passively croatized, or had emigrated as a consequence of the unfavorable economic situation. According to the Italian linguist Matteo Bartoli, by the end of the Venetian rule, 33% of the Dalmatian population was Venetian-speaking.Seton-Watson, \\"Italy from Liberalism to Fascism, 1870–1925\\". pag. 107 According to two Austro-Hungarian censuses,Perselli, Guerrino. I censimenti della popolazione dell'Istria, con Fiume e Trieste, e di alcune città della Dalmazia tra il 1850 ed il 1936 the Dalmatian Italians formed 12.5% of the population in 1865 and 3.1% in 1890. =The interwar period (1918–1941)= Following the conclusion of World War I and the disintegration of Austria-Hungary, the vast majority of Dalmatia became part of the newly formed Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later renamed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia). Italy entered the war on the side of the Entente in 1915, after the secret London Pact, which granted to Italy a large portion of Dalmatia. The pact was nullified in the Treaty of Versailles due to the objections of American president Woodrow Wilson and the South Slavic delegations. However, in 1920 the Kingdom of Italy managed to get after the Treaty of Rapallo, most of the Austrian Littoral, part of Inner Carniola, some border areas of Carinthia, the city of Zadar along with the island and Lastovo. A large number of Italians (allegedly nearly 20,000) moved from the areas of Dalmatia assigned to Yugoslavia and resettled in Italy (mainly in Zara). Relations with the Kingdom of Yugoslavia were severely affected and constantly remained tense, because of the dispute over Dalmatia and because of the lengthy dispute over the city-port of Rijeka, which according to the Treaty of Rapallo had to become a free state according to the League of Nations, but was annexed to Italy on 16 March according to the Treaty of Rome. In 1922 Fascism came to power in Italy. The fascist policies included strong nationalistic policies. Minority rights were severely reduced. This included the shutting down of educational facilities in Slavic languages, forced Italianization of citizen's names, and the brutal persecution of dissenters. In Zara most Croats left, due to these oppressive policies of the fascist government. The same happened with the Italian minority in Yugoslavia. Although, the matter was not entirely reciprocal: the Italian minority in Yugoslavia had some degree of protection, according to the Rapallo Treaty (such as Italian citizenship and primary instruction). All this increased the intense resentment between the two ethnic groups. Where in the 19th century there was conflict only on the upper classes, there was now an increasing mutual hatred present in varying degrees among the entire population. =World War II and post-war= Yugoslavia The Kingdom of Yugoslavia was invaded by the Wehrmacht in 1941 and parts of Dalmatia were annexed to Italy as the Governatorate of Dalmatia with Zadar as its capital. The local population was subject to violent forced italianization by the fascist government. Several concentration camps were established by Italian authorities to house these \\"enemies of the state\\", including the infamous Gonars and Rab concentration camps. The Italian authorities were not able to maintain full control over the hinterland and the interior of the islands, however, and they were partially controlled by the Yugoslav Partisans after 1943. Following the Italian capitulation of 1943, the German Army took over the occupation after a short period of Partisan control (officially, the Governorship of Dalmatia was handed to the control of the puppet Independent State of Croatia). During this period a large proportion of the coastal city population volunteered to join the Partisans (most notably that of Split, where a third of the total population left the city), while many Italian garrisons deserted to fight as Partisan units and still others were forced to surrender their weapons and equipment. As Soviet troops advanced in the Balkans in 1944, a small-scale evacuation took place in Zadar, while Marshall Josip Broz Tito's Partisans (since 1942 recognized as Allied troops) simultaneously moved to liberate the remainder of Axis-occupied Dalmatia. Split was henceforth the provisional capital of Allied-liberated Croatia. In 1943–44 the city of Zadar suffered 54 air raids by the Allies and it was severely damaged, with heavy civilian casualties. Many civilians had already escaped to Italy when the Partisans controlled the city. After World War II Italy ceded all remaining Italian areas in Dalmatia to the new SFR Yugoslavia. This was followed by a further emigration, referred to as the Istrian exodus, of nearly all the remaining Italians in Dalmatia. Italian language schools in Zadar were closed in 1953, due to a dispute between Italy and Yugoslavia over Trieste. In 2010 a kindergarten for the small Italian community of Zadar was going to be opened, promoted by the local Italian association, but the local Croatian authorities refused to open the school because the number of attending children was too small. Indeed, the issue was of administrative nature because the administration claimed that the Italian ethnicity had to be proved by the ownership of an Italian passport. Due to the restrictions imposed to the double nationality of the Italian minority in Yugoslavia after 1945, this requirement could only be met by a limited number of children. This administrative difficulty has been solved in 2012 and the opening of the kindergarten took place in 2013. Population decline =Reasons= There are several reasons for the decrease of the Dalmatian Italian population following the rise of European nationalism in the 19th century:Seton-Watson, Italy from Liberalism to Fascism, 1870–1925. pag. 47–48 * The conflict with the Austrian rulers caused by the Italian \\"Risorgimento\\". * The emergence of Croatian nationalism and Italian irredentism (see Risorgimento), and the subsequent conflict of the two. * The emigration of many Dalmatians toward the growing industrial regions of northern Italy before World War I and North and South America. * Multi generational assimilation of anyone who married out of their social class and/or nationality – as perpetuated by similarities in education, religion, dual linguistic distribution, mainstream culture and economical output. =Stages= The process of the decline had various stages:Colella, Amedeo. L'esodo dalle terre adriatiche. Rilevazioni statistiche. p. 54 * Under the Austrian starting from the 1840s, as a result of the age of Nationalism, the birth of Italian irredentism, and the resulting conflict with the Croatian majority and the Austrian rulers. * After World War I, as a result of the creation of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia (where all Dalmatia was included, save Zadar and some northern Dalmatian islands), there was an emigration of a large number of Dalmatian Italians, mainly toward Zadar. * During World War II, Italy occupied large chunks of the Yugoslav coast and created the Governorship of Dalmatia (1941–1943), with three Italian provinces, Zadar, Split and Kotor. Zadar was bombed by the Allies and heavily damaged in 1943–44, with numerous civilian casualties. The most of the population moved to Italy. * After World War II Italy ceded all remaining Italian areas in Dalmatia to the new SFR Yugoslavia. This was followed by a massive emigration of nearly all the remaining Dalmatian Italians participating in the Istrian Exodus from former territories of the Kingdom of Italy. Some have become world-renowned, such as the fashion designer Ottavio Missoni, the writer Enzo Bettiza and the industrial tycoon Giorgio Luxardo, founder of the Maraschino liquor distillery. Modern-day presence in Dalmatia The Dalmatian Italians were a fundamental presence in Dalmatia, when the process of political unification of the Italians, Croats and Serbs started at the beginning of the 19th century. The 1816 Austro-Hungarian census registered 66,000 Italian speaking people between the 301,000 inhabitants of Dalmatia, or 22% of the total Dalmatian population.Montani, Carlo. Venezia Giulia, Dalmazia – Sommario Storico – An Historical Outline The main communities are located in the following coastal cities: * in Croatia: Zadar, Split, Trogir, and Šibenik. * in Montenegro: Kotor, Perast, and Budva. Following the Italian emigration from Dalmatia and the events Petacco, Arrigo. L'esodo, la tragedia negata degli italiani d'Istria, Dalmazia e Venezia Giulia following World War II, the Dalmatian Italians communities were drastically reduced in their numbers. Today according to the official censuses, only a few hundred citizens in Croatia and Montenegro declared themselves ethnically Italian. It has been claimed by the Italian Communities in Dalmatia that the official census of 2001 underestimated the real number of Italian Dalmatians – because several thousand Croatian citizens of Italian descent might not have declared their real ethnicity for various reasons. While this claim remains difficult to assess, it has been a subject of a controversy regarding the Italian Community of Zadar. Currently it counts 500+ members and yet only has 109 registered residence declared Italian (as per 2001 census). It has been suggested that this could be due to unresolved legal disputes over property that was nationalised under Yugoslavia's Stanarsko Pravo initiative and nominally returned (with protected tenants) after the 1990s Croatian Independence (under the new legal term Zaštićeno Najmoprimstvo). The implied property rights as stipulated by the Croatian Law gives credence to the idea that owners of property with protected tenants have a stronger case claiming back vacant possession if they were: * Residence of Croatia (hence holders of a Croatian Identity Card) * Ethnic Croats (by way of self declaration) * Pillars of the Community and its Business Network (with ties to the local power structure) Regardless of the above, it could therefore be argued that the local Italians, Croatian Lombards, Istro-Romanians and the Regionalist Dalmatians & Istrians remain unprotected as minorities; (right under the nose of the European Union). Furthermore it could be added that without consenting to rules and regulations of assimilation (that essentially discredit an individual's rights to his/her own nationality in both Croatia and the wider European Union, credential accreditation towards legal representation become subject to local judgements and interpretations that seem to separate from the legal views of the Supreme Court of Croatia. In that sense we could speculate that claiming to be Italian could be seen as a form of a rebellion against Croatia; something that creates complications in legal disputes where the government (with enforced protected tenants on private land) already remains complicit. =Croatian Venetists= A contemporary reaction to both the Italian irredentist movement and the inadequate legal representation of Italians in Croatia by the Republic of Croatia (and hence the European Union), appears to have spawned a number of self identifying markers among the descendants of (both titled & untitled) former merchant classes of mixed Croatian (mostly Istrian and/or Dalmatian) and North Italian (mostly Venetian, and/or Friulian) extractions. The two most popular self identifications of this kind remain; Croatian Venetists, and Venetian Lombards (most of which explicitly self identify as Croatian, and implicitly as mentioned above). How they perceive Italy and the general Italian ethnicity remains unclear. However, while its historical context, in part by the colonial elements of the Republic of Venice, Italian unification & the legacy of two world wars, remains a controversial issue at best, it does suggest a much larger presence of people of Italian and Venetian descent in Croatia than previously thought. Since Croatia's much talked about adoption of Italian as one of the national languages of Croatia (particularly in Istria), curtailing language rights for Venetian Language speakers however, may have triggered conflicting identity issues of cultural affiliations between Italians of various regions of Italy, and Croatia. Particular note of reference point towards the Venetian independence referendum, 2014, and Venetian autonomy referendum, 2017 in Italy, which may have weakened the Italian language in the Northern Adriatic Basin since. =Main Dalmatian Italian associations= In contemporary Dalmatia there are several associations of Dalmatian Italians, mainly located in important coastal cities: * The Italian Community of Zadar (Comunità Italiana di Zara). Founded in 1991 in Zadar, with an Assembly of around 500 members. The current president is Rina Villani (who has been recently elected in the Zadar county, or Županija). The former president of the CI, Dr. Libero Grubišić, started the first Italian courses in the city after the close of all the Italian school in Zadar in 1953. The actual vice president, Silvio Duiella, has promoted the creation of an Italian Choral of Zadar under the direction of Adriana Grubelić. In the new offices, the CI has a library and organizes several courses of Italian and conferences. The office of the community was the target of a criminal fire in 2004. * The Italian Community of Split (Comunità Italiana di Spalato). Was created in 1993 in Split, with an office near the city's trademark Riva seashore. The president is Eugenio Dalmas and the legal director is Mladen Dalbello. In the office, the CI organises Italian language courses and conferences. This CI has 97 members. * The Italian Community of Mali Lošinj (Comunità Italiana di Lussinpiccolo). Created in 1990 in the northern Dalmatian island of Lošinj. This CI was founded thanks to Stelio Cappelli (first president) in this little island, that was part of the Kingdom of Italy from 1918 to 1947. It has 461 members under the actual leadership of Anna Maria Saganici, Livia Andrijčić and Andrino Maglievaz. The activities are run in a place offered by the local authorities. The library has been donated by the local Rotary Club. * The Italian Community of Kotor (Comunità Italiana di Cattaro), in Kotor is being registered officially (with the \\"Unione Italiana\\") as the Italian Community of Montenegro (Comunità degli Italiani del Montenegro). In connection with this registration, the \\"Center for Dalmatian Cultural Research\\" (Centro di Ricerche Culturali Dalmate) has opened in 2007 the Venetian house in Kotor to celebrate the Venetian heritage in coastal Montenegro. * The \\"Dante Alighieri\\" Association. The \\"Dante Alighieri\\" is an Italian government organization that promotes Italian language in the world, with the help of the Italian speaking communities outside Italy. In Dalmatia is actually present in: * Zadar * Split * Dubrovnik * Kotor Culture Old Zadar city gates. The British Encyclopedia states that: > \\"....The monuments left in Dalmatia by the Romans are numerous and precious. > They are chiefly confined to the cities; for the civilization of the country > was always urban, just as its history is a record of isolated city-states > rather than of a united nation. Beyond the walls of its larger towns, little > was spared by the barbarian Goths, Avars and Slavs; and the battered > fragments of Roman work which mark the sites of Salona, near, and of many > other ancient cities, are of slight antiquarian interest and slighter > artistic value. Among the monuments of the Roman period, by far the most > noteworthy in Dalmatia, and, indeed, in the whole Balkan Peninsula, is the > Palace of Diocletian at Split. Dalmatian architecture was influenced by > Constantinople in its general character from the 6th century until the close > of the tenth. The oldest memorials of this period are the vestiges of three > basilicas, excavated in Salona, and dating from the first half of the 7th > century at latest. Then from Italy came the Romanesque. The belfry of S. > Maria, at Zadar, erected in 1105, is first in a long list of Romanesque > buildings. At Rab there is a beautiful Romanesque campanile which also > belongs to the 12th century; but the finest example in this style is the > cathedral of Trail. The 14th century Dominican and Franciscan convents in > Dubrovnik are also noteworthy. Romanesque lingered on in Dalmatia until it > was displaced by Venetian Gothic in the early years of the 15th century. The > influence of Venice was then at its height. Even in the relatively hostile > Republic of Ragusa the Romanesque of the custom-house and Rectors' palace is > combined with Venetian Gothic, while the graceful balconies and ogee windows > of the Prijeki closely follow their Venetian models. In 1441 Giorgio Orsini > of Zadar, summoned from Venice to design the cathedral of Šibenik, brought > with him the influence of the Italian Renaissance. The new forms which he > introduced were eagerly imitated and developed by other architects, until > the period of decadence – which virtually concludes the history of Dalmatian > art – set in during the latter half of the 17th century. Special mention > must be made of the carved woodwork, embroideries and plate preserved in > many churches. The silver statuette and the reliquary of St. Blaise at > Dubrovnik, and the silver ark of St. Simeon at Zadar, are fine specimens of > Italian jewelers' work, ranging in date from the 11th or 12th to the 17th > century ...\\". In the 19th century the cultural influence from Italy originated the editing in Zadar of the first Dalmatian newspaper, in Italian and Croatian: Il Regio Dalmata – Kraglski Dalmatin, founded and published by the Italian Bartolomeo Benincasa in 1806. The Il Regio Dalmata – Kraglski Dalmatin was stamped in the typography of Antonio Luigi Battara and was the first done in Croatian language. The Dalmatian Italians contributed to the cultural development of theater and opera in Dalmatia. The Verdi Theater in Zadar was their main symbol until 1945. Contessa Gabriella De Lupi — painter, philosopher, philanthropist humanitarian. Contemporary notable Dalmatian Italians Across the centuries Dalmatian Italians made with their life and their works a large influence on Dalmatia. However, it would somehow arbitrary to attribute a nationality to the Dalmatians living before the Napoleonic time. Indeed, only at the beginning of the 19th century the concept of national identity started to build up. For this reason, hereafter are reported only the notable Dalmatian Italians living after 1800, in chronological order of birth. * Pier Alessandro Paravia (Zadar 1797 – Turin 1857) – Writer * Niccolò Tommaseo (Šibenik 1802 -1874) – Linguist, journalist and essayist * Antonio Bajamonti (Split 1822 – 1891) – Italian mayor of Split * Lovro Monti (Knin 1835-1898) - politician * Arturo Colautti (Zadar 1851 – Rome 1914) – Journalist, writer and opera composer * Roberto Ferruzzi (Šibenik 1853 – 1934) – painter * Antonio Tacconi (Split 1880 – Rome 1962) – Senator and last Italian mayor of Split * Alessandro Dudan (Vrlika 1883 – Rome 1957) – Politician and historian * Girolamo Luxardo (Zadar 1887–1944) – Owner of the former \\"Maraschino\\" liquor distillery in Zadar * Tino Pattiera (Cavtat 1890 – 1966) – tenor * Mila Schön (Trogir 1916 – Quargnento 2008) – Stilist * Gabre Gabric (Imotski 1917) – Athlete * Ottavio Missoni (Dubrovnik 1921 – Sumirago 2013) – International fashion designer * Enzo Bettiza (Split 1927) – Journalist and international writer * Renzo de' Vidovich (Zadar 1934) – Writer, journalist and director of \\"Il Dalmata\\" * Gianni Garko (Zadar 1935) – Actor * Armando Marenzzi (Šibenik 1963) – football manager * Giovanni Rosso (Split 1972) – Former footballer for the Croatian national team * Ana Grepo (Split 1975-Osijek 2011) – Model * Fausto Budicin (Pula 1981) – Footballer * Paolo Marinelli (Rijeka 1995) – Basketball player =Organizations and periodicals= Many Dalmatian Italians are organized in associations such as: * Associazione nazionale Venezia Giulia e Dalmazia * Comunità di Lussinpiccolo. * Comunità chersina nel mondo * Libero Comune di Zara in esilio (Free Commune of Zadar in exile) * Società Dalmata di Storia Patria The most popular periodical for Dalmatian Italians is Il Dalmata, published in Trieste by Renzo de' Vidovich.

He joined the band in 1964/1965, two years after its foundation. He appeared on Quo's first three albums – Picturesque Matchstickable Messages from the Status Quo, Spare Parts and Ma Kelly's Greasy Spoon – and wrote \\"To Be Free\\", the b-side of the second Quo single, \\"Black Veils of Melancholy\\". The track \\"Umleitung\\" was a co-composition with bassist Alan Lancaster, but was not released until the first album after Lynes' departure, 1971's Dog of Two Head. Lynes left the band in 1970, and was eventually replaced by Andy Bown in 1977. \\"We were frightened out of our lives to play without him,\\" recalled Lancaster, \\"because the organ had always drowned out the bad bits.\\" According to the group's producer John Schroeder, who wrote the booklet notes for the 3-CD compilation The Early Years, Lynes was 'the quietest member of the group' and 'somehow always seemed to be the odd one out'. He had fallen in love on tour, claiming he could see how serious the other band members (Lancaster, Francis Rossi, Rick Parfitt and John Coghlan) were about fame and glory, and that he just wanted to settle down to a life with his newfound love. \\"I was shocked, but Roy was like that,\\" recalled Rossi in 2001. \\"He'd met a bird in some petrol station a week earlier, and they're still married today.\\" In the group's autobiography Just for the Record (1993), Parfitt said Lynes was 'a bit laid back, the Open University type who liked tinkering and finding out about things,' and Rossi remarked that he showed up at a gig in New Zealand about ten years later to say hello; 'He seemed a much happier bloke.' He is still active in Australia and has continued to perform in his own right. On Quo's 2000 tour of Australia, Lynes played keyboards with them onstage in Brisbane. Lynes has also occasionally contributed keyboards and vocals to Australian tribute band Statoz Quo.

Characteristics of such binding sites may be used for predicting DNA-binding sites from the structural and even sequence properties of unbound proteins. This approach has been successfully implemented for predicting the protein–protein interface. Here, this approach is adopted for predicting DNA-binding sites in DNA-binding proteins. First attempt to use sequence and evolutionary features to predict DNA-binding sites in proteins was made by Ahmad et al. (2004) and Ahmad and Sarai (2005). Some methods use structural information to predict DNA-binding sites and therefore require a three-dimensional structure of the protein, while others use only sequence information and do not require protein structure in order to make a prediction. Web servers Structure- and sequence-based prediction of DNA-binding sites in DNA-binding proteins can be performed on several web servers listed below. DISIS predicts DNA binding sites directly from amino acid sequence and hence is applicable for all known proteins. It is based on the chemical-physical properties of the residue and its environment, predicted structural features and evolutionary data. It uses machine learning algorithms.Ofran , Y. Mysore , V. and Rost B. Prediction of DNA-binding residues from sequence Bioinformatics 23(13):i347-53 (2007) DISIS2 receives the raw amino acid sequence and generates all features from it, such as secondary structure, solvent accessibility, disorder, b-value, protein- protein interaction, coiled coils, and evolutionary profiles, etc. The amount of predicted features is much larger than of DISIS (previous version). Finally, DISIS2 is able to predict DNA-binding residues from protein sequence of DNA-binding proteins.

Despite the earthquake's moderate scale magnitude of 5.8, its relatively shallow depth (15.0 km) resulted in strong surface shaking, with a maximum perceived intensity of X (Extreme) on the Mercalli intensity scale. Between 12,000 and 15,000 people (about a third of the city's population of the time) were killed and another 12,000 injured with at least 35,000 people left homeless, making it the most destructive and deadliest earthquake in Moroccan history. Particularly hard hit were Founti, the Kasbah, Yachech (iḥšaš) and the Talbordjt area. The earthquake's shallow focus, close proximity to the port city of Agadir, and unsatisfactory construction methods were all reasons declared by earthquake engineers and seismologists as to why it was so destructive.  Earthquake  While the shock was recorded by seismographs around the world, few of these stations were close enough to the scene to locate the epicenter with high accuracy, but with what information was available the instrumental location was determined to have been to the north-northwest of the Kasbah. Macroseismic observations (establishing the locations with the highest observed intensity) placed the epicenter about north of Yachech. A sequence of minor foreshocks preceded the main event. The first shock occurred on 23 February with an intensity of III or IV (Weak to Light) and on the day of the disaster, a more significant foreshock with an intensity of VI (Strong) caused alarm around the lunchtime hour.. The mainshock took place on the third day of the Muslim observance of Ramadan, immediately collapsing many hotels, apartments, markets, and office buildings. Underground water mains broke and sewer systems crumbled. The Kasbah, a dilapidated fortress which had stood for centuries, crumbled on the side of a hill. With no water pressure and most fire stations having collapsed (killing their occupants) many fires were left burning in the resort city of Agadir with few firefighters and resources to fight them. With nearly seventy percent of the city in ruins, no rescue operations were able to be initiated or arranged from within Agadir. By morning the French army and sailors from the United States Sixth Fleet approached the coast, anchored, and prepared for the rescue process. British author Gavin Maxwell was staying in Morocco at the time of the disaster and his book The Rocks Remain opens with a vivid description drawn from his own experiences and those of others in the area, including important personages in the Moroccan government who numbered among his friends. = Response = Mohammed V broadcast a request that all cities of Morocco prepare and send aid. He and his son, Crown Prince Moulay Hassan, flew to the area along with several cabinet ministers to observe the impact firsthand. In his role as Imam, he gave special dispensation to rescue workers to set aside the requirement to abstain from food and drink during daylight in Ramadan, but many workers nevertheless continued to fast. Military planes from France and the United States flew into Agadir to assist with the relief effort. The Moroccan Army provided emergency aid and helicopters arrived from the Ben Guerir Air Base, around 100 miles away. Upon arrival, Rear Admiral Frank Akers (commander of the U.S. fleet air arm in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean) toured the scene and reported that the Agadir hospital was in ruins. One of the many victims of the disaster was author and lawyer Robin Maugham. He was treated at a hospital in Casablanca for minor injuries he received while at the Saada resort when it collapsed – he had been trapped under a fallen beam for several hours. The city of Agadir was evacuated two days after the earthquake in order to avoid the spread of disease. USGS ShakeMap showing the intensity of the earthquake The rescue work was hampered both by the level of destruction and by the weather – temperatures were unusually high for the time of year, reaching 104 °F (40 °C) in the shade. Rapid putrefaction of the thousands of corpses created a foul and unhealthy atmosphere, and adherence to the Ramadan fast caused further strain on rescue workers. Many victims also refused medical treatment, believing that to accept it would constitute breaking their fast. Rescue workers were equipped with gas masks, and quicklime was spread over areas where rescue was considered hopeless, to destroy the rotting corpses – the risk of killing buried survivors as well being accepted. Disinfectant and DDT were sprayed over the ruins from lorries and helicopters to control disease and kill the swarms of flies which were attracted to the scene. The ruins also became infested by rats from the destroyed sewer network and rat poison was spread to kill them; larger animals, such as stray dogs and cats which fed on the human corpses, were shot. Looters were also attracted to the destruction; they were shot on sight and their bodies dumped in mass graves along with those of the victims. These measures were viewed as callous and brutal by those remote from the scene, but given the scale of the destruction and the rapid infestation of the ruins by potential carriers of disease, drastic measures were necessary in order to prevent still further loss of life from epidemic. = Damage = View of Agadir following the earthquake Construction in Agadir progressed rapidly between 1945 and 1955, with specific conditions that may have contributed to the high degree of destruction. Challenging designs were often undertaken with untrained workers, and a lack of good supervision was typical, along with an accelerated effort to finish the job. As there had been no serious earthquakes prior to 1960, construction in the city had been done without consideration of seismic activity. Masonry buildings of more than one story did not fare well, but reinforced concrete structures varied dramatically in their response. For example, some of the highest of this type collapsed completely, while a good number of them resisted the shock well, and some others escaped damage altogether. In most cases of complete collapse, the design of the buildings lacked with respect to building regulations, as these were not a primary concern of the architects and inadequate enforcement of the ordinances was also a factor. Many quarters of the city consisted entirely of buildings constructed from rammed earth. These had essentially zero earthquake resistance and disintegrated completely into dust. In these areas rescue work was impossible and survival rates were negligible; for example, in the Talbourdjt area, out of 5,000 inhabitants fewer than ten survived.  Tsunami  The newspaper report on 2 March 1960 described how a tsunami was reported to have come ashore shortly after the earthquake, stating \\"A tidal wave curled in across the white beaches and lanced into the town. The city dock was cut in two, a Spanish shipmaster radioed.\\" A tsunami disaster was later refuted by a report from the American Iron and Steel Institute after a team of earthquake engineers, including Ray W. Clough from the University of California, Berkeley, surveyed the damage and building failures throughout the Agadir area in March 1960. The report of their findings stated that the port facilities suffered damage due to fairly uniform subsidence in the harbor area that was responsible for knocking over five large cranes, but no evidence of nor any reliable witness to large waves was found, with the exception of a Dutch freighter crew who stated that large swells in the harbor did cause the separation of their mooring lines at the time of the earthquake. A report in a 1964 issue of the Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America also denied the existence of a destructive tsunami because of a lack of evidence from a nearby tide gauge.

The two main forms of land transport can be considered to be rail transport and road transport. Systems Several systems of land transport have been devised, from the most basic system of humans carrying things from place to sophisticated networks of ground-based transportation utilising different types of vehicles and infrastructure. The three types are human-powered, animal powered and machine powered =Human powered transportation= Human-powered transport remains common in developing countries. Human powered transport, a form of sustainable transportation, is the transport of people and/or goods using human muscle-power, in the form of walking, running and swimming. Modern technology has allowed machines to enhance human power. Human-powered transport remains popular for reasons of cost-saving, leisure, physical exercise, and environmentalism; it is sometimes the only type available, especially in underdeveloped or inaccessible regions. Although humans are able to walk without infrastructure, the transport can be enhanced through the use of roads, especially when using the human power with vehicles, such as bicycles and inline skates. Human-powered vehicles have also been developed for difficult environments, such as snow and water, by watercraft rowing and skiing; even the air can be entered with human-powered aircraft. =Animal-powered transportation= Animal-powered transport is the use of working animals for the movement of people and goods. Humans may ride some of the animals directly, use them as pack animals for carrying goods, or harness them, alone or in teams, to pull sleds or wheeled vehicles. =Road transportation= The Harbor Freeway is often heavily congested at rush hour in Downtown Los Angeles. A road is an identifiable route, way or path between two or more places. Roads are typically smoothed, paved, or otherwise prepared to allow easy travel; though they need not be, and historically many roads were simply recognizable routes without any formal construction or maintenance.Lay, 1992: 6–7 In urban areas, roads may pass through a city or village and be named as streets, serving a dual function as urban space easement and route. The most common road vehicle is the automobile; a wheeled passenger vehicle that carries its own motor. Other users of roads include buses, trucks, motorcycles, bicycles and pedestrians. As of 2002, there were 590 million automobiles worldwide. Automobiles have caused air pollution which results to people getting Asthma . Road transport offers a complete freedom to road users to transfer the vehicle from one lane to the other and from one road to another according to the need and convenience. This flexibility of changes in location, direction, speed, and timings of travel is not available to other modes of transport. It is possible to provide door to door service only by road transport. Automobiles offer high flexibility and with low capacity, but are deemed with high energy and area use, and the main source of noise and air pollution in cities; buses allow for more efficient travel at the cost of reduced flexibility.Cooper et al., 1998: 278 Road transport by truck is often the initial and final stage of freight transport. =Rail transportation= alt=White electric train with red cheatline emerging from tunnel in the countryside Rail transport is where a train runs along a set of two parallel steel rails, known as a railway or railroad. The rails are anchored perpendicular to ties (or sleepers) of timber, concrete or steel, to maintain a consistent distance apart, or gauge. The rails and perpendicular beams are placed on a foundation made of concrete, or compressed earth and gravel in a bed of ballast. Alternative methods include monorail and maglev. A train consists of one or more connected vehicles that run on the rails. Propulsion is commonly provided by a locomotive, that hauls a series of unpowered cars, that can carry passengers or freight. The locomotive can be powered by steam, diesel or by electricity supplied by trackside systems. Alternatively, some or all the cars can be powered, known as a multiple unit. Also, a train can be powered by horses, cables, gravity, pneumatics and gas turbines. Railed vehicles move with much less friction than rubber tires on paved roads, making trains more energy efficient, though not as efficient as ships. Intercity trains are long-haul services connecting cities;Cooper et al., 1998: 279 modern high-speed rail is capable of speeds up to , but this requires specially built track. Regional and commuter trains feed cities from suburbs and surrounding areas, while intra-urban transport is performed by high-capacity tramways and rapid transits, often making up the backbone of a city's public transport. Freight trains traditionally used box cars, requiring manual loading and unloading of the cargo. Since the 1960s, container trains have become the dominant solution for general freight, while large quantities of bulk are transported by dedicated trains. =Other modes= alt=Oil pipeline winding through cold Alaskan country-side. In the background are mountains, partly snow-capped Pipeline transport sends goods through a pipe; most commonly liquid and gases are sent, but pneumatic tubes can also send solid capsules using compressed air. For liquids/gases, any chemically stable liquid or gas can be sent through a pipeline. Short-distance systems exist for sewage, slurry, water and beer, while long-distance networks are used for petroleum and natural gas. Cable transport is a broad mode where vehicles are pulled by cables instead of an internal power source. It is most commonly used at steep gradient. Typical solutions include aerial tramway, elevators, escalator and ski lifts; some of these are also categorized as conveyor transport. =Connections with other modes= Airports Airports serve as a terminus for air transport activities, but most people and cargo transported by air must use ground transport to reach their final destination. Airport-based services are sometimes used to shuttle people to nearby hotels or motels when overnight stay is required for connecting flights. Companies provide rental car, private bus and taxi services while mass transportation is usually provided by a municipality or other source of public funding. Several major airports, including Denver International and JFK International, provide many types of ground transportation, often by working with livery companies and similar businesses. Smaller airports might only have a few private rental companies and a bus service. Larger airports tend to offer several different transportation options. Larger airports also sometimes have light rail and/or roads that loop around an airport to provide access from multiple terminals. Seaports As with air transport, sea transport typically requires use of ground transport at either end of travel for people and goods to reach their final destinations. Significant infrastructure is used at ports to transfer people and goods between sea and land systems. Elements =Infrastructure= Bridges, such as Golden Gate Bridge, allow roads and railways to cross bodies of water. Infrastructure is the fixed installations that allow a vehicle to operate. It consists of a way, a terminal and facilities for parking and maintenance. For rail, pipeline, road and cable transport, the entire way the vehicle travels must be built up. Terminals such as stations are locations where passengers and freight can be transferred from one vehicle or mode to another. For passenger transport, terminals are integrating different modes to allow riders to interchange to take advantage of each mode's advantages. For instance, airport rail links connect airports to the city centers and suburbs. The terminals for automobiles are parking lots, while buses and coaches can operate from simple stops.Cooper et al., 1998: 275–76 For freight, terminals act as transshipment points, though some cargo is transported directly from the point of production to the point of use. The financing of infrastructure can either be public or private. Transport is often a natural monopoly and a necessity for the public; roads, and in some countries railways and airports are funded through taxation. New infrastructure projects can have high cost, and are often financed through debt. Many infrastructure owners therefore impose usage fees, such as landing fees at airports, or toll plazas on roads. Independent of this, authorities may impose taxes on the purchase or use of vehicles. Because of poor forecasting and overestimation of passenger numbers by planners, there is frequently a benefits shortfall for transport infrastructure projects.Bent Flyvbjerg, Mette K. Skamris Holm, and Søren L. Buhl, \\"How (In)Accurate Are Demand Forecasts in Public Works Projects\\", Journal of the American Planning Association 71:2, pp. 131–146. =Vehicles= A Fiat Uno in 2018 A vehicle is any non-living device that is used to move people and goods. Unlike the infrastructure, the vehicle moves along with the cargo and riders. Unless being pulled by a cable or muscle-power, the vehicle must provide its own propulsion; this is most commonly done through a steam engine, combustion engine, or electric motor, though other means of propulsion also exist. Vehicles also need a system of converting the energy into movement; this is most commonly done through wheels, propellers and pressure. Vehicles are most commonly staffed by a driver. However, some systems, such as people movers and some rapid transits, are fully automated. For passenger transport, the vehicle must have a compartment for the passengers. Simple vehicles, such as automobiles, bicycles or simple aircraft, may have one of the passengers as a driver. Users =Public= Public land transport refers to carriage of people and goods by government or commercial entities which is made available to the public at large for the purpose of facilitating the economy and society they serve. Most transport infrastructure and large transport vehicles are operated in this manner. Funds to pay for such transport may come from taxes, subscriptions, direct user fees, or some combination. The vast majority of public transport is land-based, with commuting and postal delivery being the primary purposes. =Commerce= Commercial land transport refers to carriage of people and goods by commercial entities made available at cost to individuals, businesses, and the government for the purpose of profiting the entities providing the travel. Most infrastructure used is publicly owned, and vehicles tend to be large and efficient to maximize capacity and profit margins. Freight shipping and long-distance travel are common uses served by commercial land transport. =Military= Military land transport refers to carriage of people and goods by the military or other operators for the purpose of supporting military operations, both in peacetime as well as in combat areas. Such activity may use a combination of public infrastructure as well as military-specific infrastructure and in many cases is designed to operate with little or no infrastructure when necessary. Vehicles can range from basic commercial or even private vehicles to those specifically designed for military use. =Private= Private land transport refers to individuals and organizations transporting themselves and their own people, animals, and goods at their own discretion. Vehicles used are typically smaller, though publicly owned infrastructure is often used for travel. Function Relocation of travelers and cargo are the most common uses of transport. However, other uses exist, such as the strategic and tactical relocation of armed forces during warfare, or the civilian mobility construction or emergency equipment. =Passenger= A local transit bus operated by Transperth in Perth, Australia A taxicab operated in New York City, United States Passenger transport, or travel, is divided into public and private transport. Public transport is scheduled services on fixed routes, while private is vehicles that provide ad hoc services at the riders desire. The latter offers better flexibility, but has lower capacity, and a higher environmental impact. Travel may be as part of daily commuting, for business, leisure or migration. Short-haul transport is dominated by the automobile and mass transit. The latter consists of buses in rural and small cities, supplemented with commuter rail, trams and rapid transit in larger cities. Long-haul transport involves the use of the automobile, trains, coaches and aircraft, the last of which have become predominantly used for the longest, including intercontinental, travel. Intermodal passenger transport is where a journey is performed through the use of several modes of transport; since all human transport normally starts and ends with walking, all passenger transport can be considered intermodal. Public transport may also involve the intermediate change of vehicle, within or across modes, at a transport hub, such as a bus or railway station. Taxis and buses can be found on both ends of the public transport spectrum. Buses are the cheaper mode of transport but are not necessarily flexible, and taxis are very flexible but more expensive. In the middle is demand-responsive transport, offering flexibility whilst remaining affordable. International travel may be restricted for some individuals due to legislation and visa requirements. =Freight= Freight transport, or shipping, is a key in the value chain in manufacturing.Chopra and Meindl, 2007: 3 With increased specialization and globalization, production is being located further away from consumption, rapidly increasing the demand for transport.Chopra and Meindl, 2007: 63–64 While all modes of transport are used for cargo transport, there is high differentiation between the nature of the cargo transport, in which mode is chosen.Chopra and Meindl, 2007: 54 Logistics refers to the entire process of transferring products from producer to consumer, including storage, transport, transshipment, warehousing, material-handling and packaging, with associated exchange of information.Bardi, Coyle and Novack, 2006: 4 Incoterm deals with the handling of payment and responsibility of risk during transport.Bardi, Coyle and Novack, 2006: 473 Freight train with shipping containers in the United Kingdom Containerization, with the standardization of ISO containers on all vehicles and at all ports, has revolutionized international and domestic trade, offering huge reduction in transshipment costs. Traditionally, all cargo had to be manually loaded and unloaded into the haul of any car; containerization allows for automated handling and transfer between modes, and the standardized sizes allow for gains in economy of scale in vehicle operation. This has been one of the key driving factors in international trade and globalization since the 1950s. Bulk transport is common with cargo that can be handled roughly without deterioration; typical examples are ore, coal, cereals and petroleum. Because of the uniformity of the product, mechanical handling can allow enormous quantities to be handled quickly and efficiently. The low value of the cargo combined with high volume also means that economies of scale become essential in transport, and whole trains are commonly used to transport bulk. Liquid products with sufficient volume may also be transported by pipeline. History Bullock team hauling wool in Australia Humans' first means of land transport was walking. The domestication of animals introduces a new way to lay the burden of transport on more powerful creatures, allowing heavier loads to be hauled, or humans to ride the animals for higher speed and duration. Inventions such as the wheel and sled helped make animal transport more efficient through the introduction of vehicles. However, water transport, including rowed and sailed vessels, was the only efficient way to transport large quantities or over large distances prior to the Industrial Revolution. The first forms of road transport were horses, oxen or even humans carrying goods over dirt tracks that often followed game trails. Paved roads were built by many early civilizations, including Mesopotamia and the Indus Valley Civilization. The Persian and Roman empires built stone-paved roads to allow armies to travel quickly. Deep roadbeds of crushed stone underneath ensured that the roads kept dry. The medieval Caliphate later built tar-paved roads. Until the Industrial Revolution, transport remained slow and costly, and production and consumption were located as close to each other as feasible. The Industrial Revolution in the 19th century saw a number of inventions fundamentally change transport. With telegraphy, communication became instant and independent of transport. The invention of the steam engine, closely followed by its application in rail transport, made land transport independent of human or animal muscles. Both speed and capacity increased rapidly, allowing specialization through manufacturing being located independent of natural resources. Modes of road transport in Dublin, 1929 With the development of the combustion engine and the automobile at the turn into the 20th century, road transport became more viable, allowing the introduction of mechanical private transport. The first highways were constructed during the 19th century with macadam. Later, tarmac and concrete became the dominant paving material. After World War II, the automobile and airlines took higher shares of transport, reducing rail to freight and short-haul passenger.Cooper et al., 1998: 277 In the 1950s, the introduction of containerization gave massive efficiency gains in freight transport, permitting globalization.Bardi, Coyle and Novack, 2006: 211–14 International air travel became much more accessible in the 1960s, with the commercialization of the jet engine. Along with the growth in automobiles and motorways, this introduced a decline for rail transport. After the introduction of the Shinkansen in 1964, high-speed rail in Asia and Europe started taking passengers on long-haul routes from airlines. Early in U.S. history, most aqueducts, bridges, canals, railroads, roads, and tunnels were owned by private joint-stock corporations. Most such transportation infrastructure came under government control in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, culminating in the nationalization of inter-city passenger rail service with the creation of Amtrak. Recently, however, a movement to privatize roads and other infrastructure has gained some ground and adherents.Clifford Winston, Last Exit: Privatization and Deregulation of the U.S. Transportation System (Washington, D.C.: Brookings Institution, 2010). Impact =Economic= Transport is a key component of growth and globalization, such as in alt=Skyline of city at dawn. A major highway winds itself into the downtown area. Transport is a key necessity for specialization—allowing production and consumption of products to occur at different locations. Transport has throughout history been a spur to expansion; better transport allows more trade and a greater spread of people. Economic growth has always been dependent on increasing the capacity and rationality of transport.Stopford, 1997: 2 But the infrastructure and operation of transport has a great impact on the land and is the largest drainer of energy, making transport sustainability a major issue. Modern society dictates a physical distinction between home and work, forcing people to transport themselves to places of work or study, as well as to temporarily relocate for other daily activities. Passenger transport is also the essence of tourism, a major part of recreational transport. Commerce requires the transport of people to conduct business, either to allow face-to-face communication for important decisions or to move specialists from their regular place of work to sites where they are needed. =Planning= Transport planning allows for high utilization and less impact regarding new infrastructure. Using models of transport forecasting, planners are able to predict future transport patterns. On the operative level, logistics allows owners of cargo to plan transport as part of the supply chain. Transport as a field is studied through transport economics, the backbone for the creation of regulation policy by authorities. Transport engineering, a sub-discipline of civil engineering, must take into account trip generation, trip distribution, mode choice and route assignment, while the operative level is handled through traffic engineering. The engineering of this alt=Aerial view of roundabout, a junction of several streets. Vehicles traverse around the roundabout, which is surrounded by buildings, mostly multi-storey Because of the negative impacts made, transport often becomes the subject of controversy related to choice of mode, as well as increased capacity. Automotive transport can be seen as a tragedy of the commons, where the flexibility and comfort for the individual deteriorate the natural and urban environment for all. Density of development depends on mode of transport, with public transport allowing for better spatial utilization. Good land use keeps common activities close to people's homes and places higher-density development closer to transport lines and hubs, to minimize the need for transport. There are economies of agglomeration. Beyond transportation some land uses are more efficient when clustered. Transportation facilities consume land, and in cities, pavement (devoted to streets and parking) can easily exceed 20 percent of the total land use. An efficient transport system can reduce land waste. Too much infrastructure and too much smoothing for maximum vehicle throughput means that in many cities there is too much traffic and many—if not all—of the negative impacts that come with it. It is only in recent years that traditional practices have started to be questioned in many places, and as a result of new types of analysis which bring in a much broader range of skills than those traditionally relied on—spanning such areas as environmental impact analysis, public health, sociologists as well as economists—the viability of the old mobility solutions is increasingly being questioned. European cities are leading this transition. =Environment= alt=Looking down a busy road, which is banked on both sides by tall buildings, some of which are covered in advertisement billboards Transport is a major use of energy and burns most of the world's petroleum. This creates air pollution, including nitrous oxides and particulates, and is a significant contributor to global warming through emission of carbon dioxide, for which transport is the fastest-growing emission sector. By subsector, road transport is the largest contributor to global warming.Climate forcing from the transport sectors, Jan Fuglestvedt, Terje Berntsen, Gunnar Myhre, Kristin Rypdal, and Ragnhild Bieltvedt Skeie, January 15, 2008, vol. 105, no. 2, PNAS.org Environmental regulations in developed countries have reduced individual vehicles' emissions; however, this has been offset by increases in the numbers of vehicles and in the use of each vehicle. Some pathways to reduce the carbon emissions of road vehicles considerably have been studied.Data on the barriers and motivators to more sustainable transport behaviour is available in the UK Department for Transport study \\"Climate Change and Transport Choices \\" published in December 2010. Energy use and emissions vary largely between modes, causing environmentalists to call for a transition from road to rail and human-powered transport, as well as increased transport electrification and energy efficiency. Other environmental impacts of transport systems include traffic congestion and automobile-oriented urban sprawl, which can consume natural habitat and agricultural lands. By reducing transportation emissions globally, it is predicted that there will be significant positive effects on Earth's air quality, acid rain, smog and climate change.

In 1915, the Salvation Army started its Life Saving Guards for girls in New Zealand. Chums, for boys, and Sunbeams, for girls, were for established for younger children. In 1916 the Salvation Army Life Saving Scouts and the Dominion Boy Scouts affiliated. A Territorial Life- saving Scout and Guard Organiser, Ensign A.H. Charker, was appointed in 1918. The popular reputation of the Salvation Army from the 1914-18 World War I and misgivings over the demise of the Dominion Boy Scouts and establishment of The Boy Scouts Association New Zealand Branch increased the popularity of the Life Saving Scouts in the 1920s and, as a charity and mission work of The Salvation Army, the Life Saving Scouts continued to be successful in New Zealand during the economic depression of the 1930s.

The hotel comprises two early buildings, individually known as Västra/Östra boställshuset (\\"The Western/Eastern Residence House\\"), located along the Långa raden (\\"The long row\\"). The two buildings were built in 1699-1702 to accommodate the 200 bodyguards of King Charles XII. They were built to the design of Nicodemus Tessin the Younger using bricks from several palaces, in Ekolsund, Gripsholm, Nyköping, Eskilstuna, and Svartsjö. As Charles spent most of his reign on the battlefields, however, neither building was used for the original purpose, serving instead to house the poor and homeless. Poor and homeless people of Stockholm emerged in great numbers following Sweden's defeat at the Battle of Poltava in 1709, but were considerably decimated by the Black Death, which hit the city the following year. As Sweden started to create its fleet of galleys in 1715, these two buildings were gradually transformed from hospitals into offices and workshops for the fleet. By the 1770s, when the commissioner's office was relocated to a separate building, the two buildings were exclusively used by the officers and officials on the island as spacious residences, each disposing up to 17 rooms. In the mid 19th century a canteen for clerks and officials was built in the western building, and both buildings together began to be known as the Långa raden. The buildings were refurbished in 1958-1959 to serve the Swedish Navy administration and the Naval Officers Society (Sjöofficerssällskapet). The Naval Officers Society started using the buildings from the mid 19th century onward. In 2009 the two buildings were converted into the Hotel Skeppsholmen, a 79-room hotel. The hotel's reception and restaurant are located in the Östra boställshuset along with some of the rooms. The Västra boställshuset contains the remaining rooms. The conversion was led by Stockholm-based architects Claesson Koivisto Rune. The buildings have been government listed buildings since 1935.

The film, which was directed by John Ford, was adapted from John Creasey's novel of the same name. Although this is the first film to feature the named character of George Gideon, Jack Hawkins had already played a very similar role in the British film The Long Arm two years earlier. Plot The film follows a day in the life of Detective Chief Inspector George Gideon of the Metropolitan Police. His day starts when he receives information that one of his officers has been taking bribes. Despite his hectic schedule, his wife reminds him his daughter has a violin recital that evening; she also tells him her aunt and uncle are coming for tea before the concert. This becomes a recurring theme throughout the film, as Gideon is continually hampered in his efforts to finish work and return home. On the way to Scotland Yard he drops his daughter off at the Royal College of Music, but is stopped by a young constable for running a red light. Once at his office, he calls in the detective whom a \\"snout\\" [i.e. informant] has told him is taking bribes and suspends him. Gideon then gets word that an escaped mental patient from Manchester is on his way to London. Meanwhile, an audacious gang is robbing payrolls. The mental patient is soon arrested, but not before he has killed the daughter of his former landlady. Gideon wants to congratulate personally the policeman who made the arrest, only to discover it is the same young officer who gave him a summons for his early morning traffic offence. Various jobs then preoccupy the chief inspector while his detectives continue to investigate the bribery case. News then arrives that the suspended policeman has been run down by a car — whose tire tracks match one used in the earlier payroll jobs. After Gideon visits the dead officer's wife, evidence soon emerges that links the dead detective to a woman, Mrs. Delafield, who went to clubs he frequented. Gideon goes to her address and discovers that the woman's husband Paul was responsible for the robberies, because he wanted the financial means to be a painter. The husband then tricks his wife into holding a gun on Gideon while he makes his escape. The detective uses his calm manner to defuse the situation. But before he can return home, the phone rings again. A safety deposit firm has been robbed by a gang of rich socialites who have been cornered inside. When the police finally draw them out, Gideon catches one of the gang himself. But he loses his temper when he finds out that the elderly night watchman was killed in cold blood by the man he arrested, telling him \\"you'll hang for this, you rich nobody!\\" Finally Gideon gets home. His wife tells him that their daughter has met a nice young man at her recital. It turns out it's the young constable again. He had been holding the chief inspector's concert ticket all day following their first encounter that morning. This led him to meet Gideon's daughter, who is quite taken by him. But finally, just as they are all sitting down to supper, the phone rings one last time. A man believed to be Paul the painter has been arrested at London Airport. The film concludes with a final irony. The young constable, who is driving Gideon to the airport, is stopped by another policeman as he races through the capital's foggy streets for running a red light — and is unable to produce his driving licence!

It helps ensure that the employee makes his or her appointed rounds at the correct intervals and can offer a record for legal or insurance reasons. Such systems have existed for many years using mechanical watchclock-based systems (watchman clocks/guard tour clocks/patrol clocks). Computerized systems were first introduced in Europe in the early 1980s, and in North America in 1986. Modern systems are based on handheld data loggers and RFID sensors. The system provides a means to record the time when the employee reaches certain points on their tour. Checkpoints or watchstations are commonly placed at the extreme ends of the tour route and at critical points such as vaults, specimen refrigerators, vital equipment, and access points. Some systems are set so that the interval between stations is timed so if the employee fails to reach each point within a set time, other staff are dispatched to ensure the employee's well-being. An example of a modern set-up might work as follows: the employee carries a portable electronic sensor (PES) or electronic data collector which is activated at each checkpoint. Checkpoints can consist of iButton semiconductors, magnetic strips, proximity microchips such as RFIDs or NFC- or optical barcodes. The data collector stores the serial number of the checkpoint with the date and time. Later, the information is downloaded from the collector into a computer where the checkpoint's serial number will have an assigned location (i.e. North Perimeter Fence, Cell Number 1, etc.). Data collectors can also be programmed to ignore duplicate checkpoint activations that occur sequentially or within a certain time period. Computer software used to compile the data from the collector can print out summaries that pinpoint missed checkpoints or patrols without the operator having to review all the data collected. Because devices can be subject to misuse, some have built-in microwave, g-force, and voltage detection. System composition It combines readers, tags and software. =Guard patrol reader= The first Guard tour system were the touch readers with software. Upon further development, more working modes for the readers became available. Such as RFID and GPS. And the communication of readers and software was connected with USB cables or download stations. For USB connection, the Pogo Pin connection is very popular. Because the contacts with gold-plating are very stable and waterproof. Newer, light-weight guard touring systems utilize QR codes or barcodes rather than expensive electronic components. A mobile phone app is used to scan (take a photo) of the QR code which creates a time stamp in the system. =Guard patrol tags= The reader needs to read the tags to record the information, such as the time and tag's ID. Then upload the information to software to get the report. * Guard ID tags: there are touch ibuttons or RFID tags. The guard ID tags replace the name of guard. * Checkpoint tags: there are touch ibuttons or RFID tags. The checkpoint tags replace the checkpoints which guards need to patrol. * Event wallets: there are many event tags in it. And they are touch ibuttons or RFID tags. Each tag means one event thing. When the reader reads the tag, it will get the event. For example, fire, stolen, broken. * QR Codes:some systems use QR codes or barcodes instead of electronic tags and the associated readers. The codes are often printed on stickers which can be easily placed nearly anywhere, changed (to ensure accountability) or added to change touring routes. *Virtual Tags: Advanced IoT sensors (BLE based) are now deployed as Virtual Tags. The Guard may or may not be aware of the location of these tags. For more info on virtual tag based systems, see gps.two-t.com =Guard patrol software= There are three types of guard patrol software. They are desktop, local network client-server, and web-based versions. The desktop version can only work on one computer. The local network client server type can work using the local area network. The web-based version can work everywhere with internet access. In the analog age, the device used for this purpose was the watchclock.The Detex Watchman's Clock Album, Philip Haselton. Accessed May 24, 2007. Watchclocks often had a paper or light cardboard disk placed inside for each 24-hour period. The user would carry the clock to each checkpoint, where a numbered key could be found (typically chained in place). The key would be inserted into the clock where it would imprint the disk. At the end of the shift or 24-hour period an authorized person (usually a supervisor) would unlock the watchclock and retrieve the disk. As development of guard tour system, the device can work with more functions. Such as send data real-time by GPRS to software and GPS location and tracking mode. In software, we set up the Patrol Department, Patrol Route, Guard, Checkpoint, Event and Patrol Plan in general, depending on the software purchased. The software will then have specific tours set for officers to complete, being able to indicate whether the inspection was completed properly or not, with the ability to note a specific temperature of an inspection, or make any kind of notes necessary. Guard Tour software systems seem to be becoming the norm in tracking tours for officers. Examples of this software would be GuardTools, the Guard Tour System by UniGuard, Silvertrac Software,Silvertrac Software SequriX,SequriX Trackforce,Trackforce QR-Patrol,QR-Patrol Kugadi,Kugadi GigaTrak GigaTrak TrackTik,TrackTik PatrolLIVE,PatrolLIVE Orna,Orna Guarnic.Guarnic GuardMetricsGuardMetrics YoutilityYoutility, Reslink SolutionsReslink Solutions and GPS by Two-T Technologies. New touring solutions rely on cloud- based Software as a Service (SaaS) combined with mobile or fixed on-site devices. These offer the advantages of lower installation and maintenance costs, forgoing the need for hardware, software upgrades, data backups and computer maintenance. On-site systems need all the usual software patches, backups and periodic hardware replacement. In operation, the role of the watchclock system, described above, has largely been replaced by some combination of GPS, RFID/NFC, or QR coded labels. Users prove that they have visited particular locations or performed tasks by scanning these tags or via GPS generated maps. These technologies result in lower costs, while increasing the flexibility of the systems to handle changes or new uses. This is important when routes change, or if a solution is needed on short notice. Tag- based touring systems typically utilize a mobile phone or tablet app to scan the tags and then upload that information along with a time stamp, phone's location information, and optionally other information the guard enters into the app on the phone. These systems provide instant access to tour information as it is uploaded by the application or device carried by the user, rather than requiring the officer to return to an upload station.Summarizes product descriptions gathered from companies offering these systems in references 4-15. Usages Although this technology was initially developed for the security market, there are other uses. Some include: * Public transport time table verification * Hotel and hospital housekeeping logging * Verification of patients being attended in hospitals by nursing staff * Provide due diligence reports for retail slip & fall liability reduction * Monitoring staff working outside of normal business hours & lone worker protection Criticisms For routes which have significant outdoor exposure GPS units have proven to be an effective means of tracking security and law enforcement patrol behavior. GPS systems do not function in the most vulnerable areas such as indoors or underground. Accordingly, systems using assisted GPS have been developed.

He supported the Parliamentary cause in the English Civil War. Biography Harley was born in Brampton Bryan Castle, Herefordshire, the son of Sir Robert Harley, KB, and his third wife Brilliana, the daughter of Edward Conway, 1st Viscount Conway. He was educated at Gloucester, Shrewsbury School and Magdalen Hall, Oxford. He was a student of Lincoln's Inn in 1641. In 1642, he took up arms in the Parliamentary cause against the King in 1642, though disapproving of military supremacy in the nation. He was shot in the arm during a skirmish in Gloucestershire in August 1644.Noted in the Parliamentarian newsbook Mercurius Civicus, number 63, 1–8 August 1644 (British Library, Thomason Tracts E.4[28]) In 1646 he was elected Member of Parliament for Herefordshire as a recruiter to the Long Parliament and was excluded in 1648 under Pride's Purge. In 1656 his father died and he inherited his estates, he was also elected MP for Herefordshire again in the Second Protectorate Parliament. He was elected MP for Herefordshire again in 1660 for the Convention Parliament. At the Restoration, Charles II made him Governor of Dunkirk in 1660. He was elected MP for Radnor in 1661 for the Cavalier Parliament and was re-elected in February 1679 for the First Exclusion Parliament. In the second election of 1679 he was elected MP for Herefordshire again, and was re-elected in 1681. He supported the revolution of 1688 and was re-elected for Herefordshire in 1689, in 1693 and 1695. Harley was a conscientious upholder of the rights of the people, who showed their appreciation by sending him continuously to Parliament. Though a churchman himself, he fought against any form of persecution of the dissenters, was without party prejudice, and was remembered more for his practical benefactions than for such theoretical performances as A Scriptural and Rational Account of the Christian Religion (1695). Family Harley was married twice. On 26 June 1654 he married, Mary, daughter and coheir of Sir William Button of Parkgate, Tawstock, Devon. They had four daughters, one of whom was called Elizabeth. On 25 February 1661 he married Abigail, daughter of Nathaniel Stephens of Eastington, Gloucestershire. They had four sons (one of whom predeceased his father) and one daughter, Abigail. He had two notable sons Robert (later Earl of Oxford) and Edward (1664–1735).

In 1861, Sears opened an architectural studio with Charles Amos Cummings. Together as Cummings and Sears, they designed many significant buildings, primarily ecclesiastical and academic, in and around Boston, including Brechin Hall and the Stone Chapel at Phillips Academy in Andover, the Old South Church on Copley Square (1875), and the Cyclorama (1884). The firm of Sears and Cummings was also capable of designing utilitarian projects and did the design of a number of aqueducts and railroad bridges. They formed a development company which intended to construct an elevated railway in Brooklyn, New York Kings County Elevated Railway but being out of towners were not able to get political co-operation and sold off the design and rights. The executive in charge was Judge Hiram Bond. In 1896, Sears was hired by Isabella Stewart Gardner to design her home, Fenway Court, in Boston's Fenway neighborhood.

Plot Set in the backyard of a blue- collar South Philadelphia neighborhood early in the summer of 1973, the comedy-drama focuses on the 21st birthday celebration of Harvard student Francis Geminiani. In attendance are his divorced blue collar father Fran and Fran's widowed girlfriend Lucille, next-door neighbor Bunny Weinberger and her overweight son Herschel, and Francis' classmates, the wealthy WASP Hastings siblings; Judith (who seeks romance with Francis) and Randy (the object of Francis' unexpressed affection), who have arrived unexpectedly, much to their friend's dismay. All are dysfunctional to varying degrees, and the interactions among them provide the play with its comic and dramatic moments. Production history Playwrights Horizons first staged the play in December 1976 with a cast that included Jonathan Hadary, Jon Polito, and Sigourney Weaver. The following March it was mounted by the Circle Repertory Company with Hadary (Herschel Weinberger), Jessica James (Bunny), Danny Aiello (Fran), Anne De Salvo (Lucille), Carol Potter (Judith Hastings), and Robert Picardo (Francis Geminiani). Critical response encouraged the producers to transfer the play to Broadway. The Broadway production, with the same cast directed by Peter Mark Schifter and supervised by Marshall W. Mason, opened on May 21, 1977 at the Little Theatre and closed on September 6, 1981 after 1,819 performances. A 1980 screen adaptation, written and directed by Richard Benner, was entitled Happy Birthday, Gemini. The cast included Madeline Kahn, Rita Moreno, Robert Viharo, Alan Rosenberg, David Marshall Grant, and Sarah Holcomb. Showtime created a \\"staged for video\\" version for cable television in 1982, starring Danny Aiello (Fran), Anne De Salvo (Lucille), and Scott Baio (Francis).

Life  Lafosse was Professor of Trombone at the Conservatoire de Paris from 1948 to 1960, where he took over from Henri Couillaud. He was also the brother of Marcel LaFosse (1895–1969) who played second trumpet with the Boston Symphony Orchestra from 1928 until the mid-1950s. He wrote a book entitled Méthode complète pour le trombone in three volumes published in 1921 (first two volumes) and 1946 (third volume). In it he famously describes the practise of playing with vibrato as vulgar and glissandos of questionable taste. It also should be apparent that the French trombones of the period could not play the fifth partial D in tune in the closed slide position (1st) so 4th position is used more frequently. There are just three pages of an appendix to cover the bass trombone. He also composed a piece for brass quintet with drums, entitled \\"Suite Brève\\". The Suite Brève is available on indésens Records (France) on physical CD (2008) as well as downloading on In the 1920s and 1930s he recorded in orchestras with Stravinsky.

He worked in techniques such as pastels, lithography, watercolor, chalk, oil painting and etching. He was best known for his elegant portraits of young women. Biography Charles Joshua Chaplin was born on 8 June 1825 in Les Andelys, Eure, France. His mother, Olympia Adelle Moisy, was French, whereas his father, John Chaplin, was an art broker from England. Charles Chaplin spent his whole life in France, becoming a naturalized citizen in 1886.Morant 143-152 He studied at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris from 1840, and he took private lessons in the studio of Michel Martin Drolling, whose apprentices included Paul Baudry, Jules Breton and Jean-Jacques Henner. Later he also taught at the École des Beaux-Arts. In 1845, he entered the Paris Salon, the official art exhibition of the Académie des Beaux-Arts, as a portrait and landscape painter with the painting Portrait of the Artist's Mother. Chaplin conducted art classes specifically for women at his studio, including Marie Joséphine Nicolas. The American artist Mary Cassatt, the French artist Louise Abbéma and the English artist Louise Jopling were among Chaplin's students. His son Arthur Chaplin was also a painter. Chaplin died on 30 January 1891 in, aged 65, Paris as a wealthy man and is buried in the Père Lachaise Cemetery.Ankele & Ankele Career =Early work= The Bird's Nest, Private collection, 1860. Chaplin made his debut at the Salon with portraits, but he also painted landscapes, particularly the countryside of Auvergne. His early works, from 1848 to 1851, were painted in a manner characterized by an interest in realism, a style established in the French Second Republic, that had the motto Liberté, égalité, fraternité, and was ruled for three years by the republican government of France from the 1848 Revolution until the 1851 coup by Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte. Realism was an artistic movement that began in France in the 1850s, after the 1848 Revolution. From the late 18th century Romanticism dominated French art and literature but was spurned by Realists, who revolted against the display of the emotions of the Romantic movement, seeking to depict real and characteristic contemporary individuals and situations with truth and accuracy. Chaplin painted many works in his early days, including floral studies that were displayed at the Salon de las Flores. Later, in the late 1850s, he abandoned naturalism, his earlier style, exchanging it for a more graceful, elegant and supple technique that brought him a certain notoriety in France during his time as a portrait painter; as such he embraced the idyllic and voluptuous and fashionable style of the prominent French painter, François Boucher (1703–1770). He also embraced the tradition of the great English portraitists. He developed his very own style of painting but was inspired by the British painters Joshua Reynolds and Thomas Gainsborough. He used to engrave the works of the Dutch artist Pieter Paul Rubens and gained further influence from his work. =Later work= Gradually the muddy colours used by Chaplin transformed into white, grey and pink, depicting his models with an opalescent, mother-of-pearl complexion by applying a subtle palette of rosy flesh tones and light greys. After painting portraits and trying his skills on ornamental painting, Chaplin took up genre painting in the 1850s. His favourite subjects are the feminine grace of a young woman’s everyday life. He portrays women in several poses: resting; grooming; singing; and reading. He captures them with lightness and carelessness and accentuates the decorative elements of the composition. Empress Eugénie, the wife of Napoleon III and an admirer of the \\"Pompadour style\\", rapidly fell under the enchantment of the painter's neo-Rococo works. Chaplin was among Napoleon III and Empress Eugénie’s favourite court artists. In 1859, when his portrait of Aurora was banned by the judges of the Salon as \\"too erotically suggestive\\", Napoléon III defended Chaplin and overturned the disqualification order. He was similarly valued as an interior decorator and was appointed to remodel the decor of Empress Eugénie's rooms. His sensual portraits of women and young girls, often with models posed erotically in hazy surroundings and frequently wearing transparent clothing, attracted the interest of the high society and aristocracy of Paris during the French Third Republic (1870-1940) guaranteeing his success and wealth. He was one of the most popular painters of his time, but nowadays his work is almost unknown, in spite of the fact that his works hang in many major museums around the world. He employed his Rococo style for his mythological scenes and genre scenes paintings. His genre pictures formed a significant part of his work. In 1861, working as a decorative painter. Chaplin painted the doors and several glass panels above them of the Salon des Fleurs in the Tuileries Palace. The Palace was gutted by fire in 1871 and its ruins swiftly demolished. He also undertook decorating work in the Salon de l’Hémicycle of the Palais de l’Elysée. =Honours and awards= A Song Silenced, Private collection. As a member of the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture, Chaplin exhibited his paintings at the Paris Salon, the official exhibition venue of members' work. He began exhibiting his paintings at the French Artists' Salon in 1845 and was represented there habitually each year. These exhibitions made him one of France's most famous portrait artists. Commencing in 1847, his work was exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy in London. During his lifetime, he received acclamation for his artistic talents by the award of several medals: a third class medal in 1851; a second class medal the following year; and an Honour Medal in 1865. He was declared Chevalier de la Légion d’Honneur in 1879, also known as The National Order of the Legion of Honour.Roederer 101-102. Chaplin was elevated to Officier in 1881. Chaplin's artistic talent was admired by renowned writers, painters and critics such as Arsène Houssaye, Émile Zola and Théophile Gautier. Édouard Manet felt Chaplin knew \\"the smile of a woman\\". It was his portraits of young women that gained him particular success. His works can be viewed in the French museums of Bordeaux, Bayonne, Bourges, Mulhouse, Paris, Reims, Rouen, Saintes, Charente-Maritime, and the Louvre Museum Graphic Art Database. Outside France his works can be found in the Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Harvard Art Museums in Massachusetts and the Indianapolis Museum of Art in Indiana. Chaplin has several paintings in a public collection in the United Kingdom at the Bowes Museum. One of Chaplin's paintings was sold at an auction in Paris on 5 June 1922. Described by the auctioneer as a landscape painting by Charles Chaplin, it achieved an unexpectedly high price for an artist considered to have \\"fallen into oblivion\\". Most of the bidders mistakenly believed it was a work of art by the comedian and actor Charlie Chaplin and thought they would acquire a remarkable find.

The GBOE Gifted Education Rule was initiated November 13, 1997, reinitiated January 8, 1998 and then adopted on February 12, 1998 in the final form.  \\"Giftedness\\" under Georgia law  According to Georgia law, a gifted student is: > a student who demonstrates a high degree of intellectual and/or creative > ability(ies), exhibits an exceptionally high degree of motivation, and/or > excels in specific academic fields, and who needs special instruction and/or > special ancillary services to achieve at levels commensurate with his or her > abilities. Two Options for Eligibility: Option A - GaDOE rule 160-4-2-.08 (1990): A student must meet eligibility requirements in both Mental Abilities and Achievement. # Mental Ability(CogAt): 99th percentile (K-2) or 96th percentile (3-12) on a standard test of mental ability- Composite Score only # Achievement (ITBS): 90th percentile in total battery, total reading or total math section of a standardized achievement battery. Option B - GaDOE rule 160-4-2-.038 (1997): The Multiple-Criteria eligibility rule is based upon (1) mental ability, (2) achievement, (3) creativity and (4) motivation. # Mental Ability: To be eligible for programs in grades K-2, a student must score in the 99th percentile on a standardized test of mental ability and in the 96% percentile for grades 3-12. # Georgia law also requires that students score at or above the 90th percentile on the battery, math or reading section of a standardized achievement test. # A student must also score at or above the 90th percentile on the total battery score of a standardized test of creative thinking, or (b) receive a score at or above the 90th percentile on standardized creativity characteristics rating scale, or (c) receive from a panel of three or more qualified evaluators a score at or above 90 on a scale of 1-100 on a structured observation/evaluation of creative products and/or performances. # Motivation is determined with a standardized motivational characteristics rating scale, receive from a panel of three or more qualified evaluators a score at or above 90 on a scale of 1-100 on a structured observation/evaluation of student generated products and/or performances, or (c) have a grade point average of at least 3.5 on a 4.0 scale.  Educator requirements  For a teacher to teach a gifted students in a designated gifted education class, they must be certified by the Georgia Professional Standards Commission and either hold the Gifted In-field Endorsement or the Gifted P-12 Consultative.  Delivery models  =Direct services= Resource Class (K-12) -- All students must have been identified as gifted using criteria established by the Georgia State Board of Education. The Resource Class Model is designed to meet the needs of gifted learners outside the regular classroom/core curriculum—-it provides students time to explore areas of interest in depth; opportunity to dig into complex, interdisciplinary studies; activities to help them develop research skills, creative thinking and creative productivity skills; time to be together with intellectual peers (which is important for both social-emotional and motivational reasons). The Resource Model is not intended for delivery of core content instruction, but the classes should have an academic content foundation focused on interdisciplinary enrichment activities. Advanced Content Class (6-12) -- This is the most used delivery model for gifted education services in the middle and high schools in Georgia. Students are homogeneously grouped on the basis of achievement and interest in a specific academic content area. The local school district may elect to include other high-achieving students who are not identified as gifted but who have demonstrated exceptional ability and motivation in a particular content area. Depending on the needs of the students, the services might include: # Advanced Placement (AP) or International Baccalaureate (IB) Courses—The teacher must have the appropriate content area certification. In addition, the teacher must (a) have been trained by the College Board in that specific AP course and have had at least 10 clock hours of staff development in characteristics of gifted learners and curriculum differentiation for gifted students; or (b) hold the gifted endorsement. # International Baccalaureate (IB) Courses—The teacher must have the appropriate content area certification. In addition, the teacher must (a) have been trained by the International Baccalaureate Program in that specific IB subject area and have had at least 10 clock hours of staff development in characteristics of gifted learners and curriculum differentiation for gifted students; or (b) hold the gifted endorsement. #Honors Courses—The teacher of a locally developed honors course curriculum must have the appropriate content area certification and hold the gifted endorsement in order to count the gifted students in the class at the gifted FTE weight. Cluster Grouping (K-12) -- Identified gifted students are placed as a group of 5-8 into an otherwise heterogeneous classroom, rather than being dispersed among all of the rooms/courses at that grade level. General education teachers differentiate instruction for students based on their area of strength or interest. =Indirect services= Collaborative Teaching (K-12) -- Direct instruction may be provided by a regular classroom teacher, but there must be substantial, regularly scheduled collaborative planning between the content area teacher and the gifted education specialist (the teacher with the gifted endorsement who is serving as the instructional facilitator). Mentorship/Internship (9-12) -- A gifted student works with a mentor to explore a profession of interest. Joint Enrollment/Postsecondary Options-- High school students may be enrolled in college, university, or technical school courses.

Description and characteristics  These fish have big, fleshy lips and tend to live on coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific in small groups or pairs. They will often associate with other fishes of similar species; several species of sweetlips sometimes swim together. They are usually seen in clusters in nooks and crannies or under overhangs. At nightfall, they venture from their shelters to seek out their bottom-dwelling invertebrate prey, such as bristleworms, shrimps, and small crabs. Sweetlips colouring and patterning changes throughout their lives. For example, Plectorhinchus polytaenia develops more stripes with age. Juvenile sweetlips generally look quite different from the adults, and often live solitary lives on shallower reef sections. Juveniles may be banded or spotted and are usually a completely different colour from the adults of their species. Small juveniles have an undulating swimming pattern, possibly mimicking poisonous flatworms as a means of predator avoidance.Debelius, H. Asia Pacific Reef Guide. 2001. Debelius, H.

These materials find use in specialized optical settings, such as focusing elements in research spectrophotometers. Compared to the more common zinc selenide-based optics, materials such as thallium bromoiodide enable transmission at longer wavelengths. In the infrared, this allows for measurements as low as 350 cm−1 (28 μm), whereas zinc selenide is opaque by 21.5 μm, and ZnSe optics are generally only usable to 650 cm−1 (15 μm).  Monohalides  Thallium(I) iodide has the CsCl crystal structure The monohalides all contain thallium with oxidation state +1. Parallels can be drawn between the thallium(I) halides and their corresponding silver salts, for example thallium(I) chloride and bromide are light sensitive and thallium(I) fluoride is more soluble in water than the chloride and bromide. ;Thallium(I) fluoride :TlF is a white crystalline solid, with a mp of 322 °C. It is readily soluble in water unlike the other halides. The normal room temperature form has a similar structure to which has a distorted rock salt structure with essentially five coordinate thallium, the sixth fluoride ion is at 370 pm. At 62 °C it transforms to a tetragonal structure.

History  Viduzia has been inhabited since ancient times. It was a boundary between two Illyrian Tribes, inhabited by Docleatae and Pleraei. After the down fall of Illyrian kingdoms, Roman Settlers from the nearby town of Travunia (Today's; Trebinje), moved in and established homesteads and farms. Later on, as Roman Rule decreased, autonomous regions started to form in the Balkans. In the 10th century the highlands were added to Travunia, which at that time was still largely untouched by Slavic invasions. By 968, Croatian King Krešimir exiled his son, Prince Leghec to Trebinje, where he fell in love with Lovizzia, a court maid that gave him seven sons. Leghec raised a rebellion of the people and created a vassalage of the Croatian Kingdom, but the Croatian occupation was expelled and dynastic control re-established with the help of Ragusa subsequently with Boleslav's son Sylvester; who ruled justly. Perhaps; Ragusa (with an overwhelming Romanised population), felt threatened by Croatian Expansion. After all, Croatians, like many other Slavic tribes, only converted to Christianity in name, and were still known as pirates, and invaders. Or perhaps, Ragusa wanted to expand themselves. In any case, by the 14th century, Ragusa had made its name by expanding well, right along the coast, while Travunia got swallowed by the long awaited Slavic invasions. For the proceeding five centuries, Viduzia stayed isolated, as the local inhabitants slowly started drifting south-westwards, into the Peljesac Peninsula, and finally (during the Ottoman invasions) into the Island of Korcula and beyond.  Geography  Its terrain is dotted with ancient church ruins and fortifications, starting from around 200 BC onward. Climate The climate of Viduzia is typically Mediterranean, warm and dry. However, the legendary bora is a strong, cold wind from the north that occurs mostly in the winter and spring. The higher regions of Vudizia get snow in winter. The temperature can be as high as 44 °C. The climate in Viduzia results from the combination of three factors: \\\\- high annual daylight hours \\\\- limited precipitation (snow, rain, etc.); in winter the wind drives out the clouds after short but intense downpours. \\\\- dry weather (the area could have dryness one month and rain the following, but still have significant dryness overall) External links * Catholic Encyclopedia: Latin Church Category:Geography of Bosnia and Herzegovina de:Lateinische Kirche id:Ritus Latin it:Rito latino it:Chiesa latina ro:Ritul latin ru:Латинский обряд ","title":"Viduzia"},{"id":"9465340","text":"David Carlsson (born 28 June 1983) is a Swedish bandy player who currently plays for Vetlanda BK as midfielder.

Originally the school was located in Milton-Freewater, Oregon, where the City Hall building is situated today. It was the first Seventh-day Adventist academy in the Pacific Northwest. Its sister school is Upper Columbia Academy. In 1892, Milton Academy joined Walla Walla College (now Walla Walla University) and was renamed Walla Walla College Academy. It academically separated from the college in 1935, and was accredited by the State in 1937. When a new elementary school, Clara E. Rogers Elementary School, was built in 1953, the academy moved to the old elementary school building. In 1964, another move brought the school to its current location and the academy became known as Walla Walla Valley Academy (WWVA). WWVA has several music groups including the concert band, Praise Ringers (bell choir), string orchestra, choir, and WWVA Singers, who present programs for various church, civic, and school activities. Academics The required curriculum includes classes in the following subject areas: Religion, English, Oral Communications, Social Studies, Mathematics, Science, Physical Education, Health, Computer Applications, Fine Arts, Personal Finance, and Electives. Spiritual aspects All students take religion classes each year that they are enrolled. These classes cover topics in biblical history and Christian and denominational doctrines. Instructors in other disciplines also begin each class period with prayer or a short devotional thought, many which encourage student input. Weekly, the entire student body gathers together in the auditorium for an hour-long chapel service. Outside the classrooms there is year-round spiritually oriented programming that relies on student involvement. Athletics WWVA is currently in the Eastern Washington Athletic Conference. Other teams include DeSales, Dayton-Waitsburg, Liberty Christian, Columbia, Tri-Cities Prep, White Swan, Lyle/Wishram, and Mabton. In the fall WWVA competes in co-ed soccer, cross country running, and women's volleyball. The varsity soccer and volleyball teams compete in the annual Fall Classics, an Adventist high school tournament, hosted by the neighboring Walla Walla University. In the winter students may compete in men's and women's basketball. At the end of the season, they compete in a similar tournament hosted by Walla Walla University called the Friendship Tournament. In the spring, WWVA offers track and field, co-ed baseball, and co-ed golf. WWVA also offers a program called AcroKinghts, an acrobatics team. While not technically a sport, with the team performing at various venues instead of competing against other acrobatic teams. It is offered year-round and students are awarded with credits. The team does a bi-annual mission trip to various countries with past trips including Belize and Jamaica. The team's largest performance to date was at the March 12, 2013 Portland Trail Blazers game against the Memphis Grizzlies.

He was a devotee of the Sacred Heart, a Eucharistic minister, and household head of the Couples for Christ. Soon, Judge Voltaire Y. Rosales started receiving offers of money and threats to his life. He remained steadfast in his commitment to the highest ideals and the noblest standards of his legal education at the College of Law of the Ateneo De Manila University. Judge Rosales would later convict a vindictive drug addict and criminal named German Agojo. Agojo would be sentenced to life imprisonment at Bilibid Prison, Muntinlupa. Even as the threats to Judge Rosales's life became more ominous, he refused to follow up his transfer to a safer jurisdiction. He believed that if he should be killed in the line of duty, it only meant that God had decided to call him and he was ready to meet his destiny. On June 10, 2004, Judge Voltaire Y. Rosales was ambushed and assassinated by shooters riding-in-tandem. Death and legacy On June 10, 2004 he was assassinated a few meters away from his court. It was suspected that his assassination was related to the Agojo drug case he was handling as a Heinous Crimes Judge. Despite the many threats to his life by the drug lord, determined to let justice be done though the heavens fall, Judge Voltaire Rosales convicted the drug dealer. Awards and recognition Since his murder he has been honored with the Ka Pepe Diokno Champion of Human Rights Award, the Lux in Domino by the Ateneo de Manila University, a Special Citation from the Provincial Peace and Order Council of Batangas (2004), a Kampon ni Pakakak Award (2004), the Fraternal Order of Utopia's President's Awards for Excellence (2005), and the Barangay Dasmariñas Government Service/ Law Award (2006). On June 10, 2014, Ateneo Law School honored Judge Rosales by dedicating a law school classroom in his name. The room, now called the \\"Executive Judge Voltaire Y. Rosales Room\\" was blessed after a Red Mass in his honor. Effects of his death on the judiciary After his assassination in 2004, the Supreme Court of the Philippines abolished the heinous crimes court (Courts tasked to decide cases on kidnapping, robbery, murder and other felonies punishable by death or capital punishment) in order to diffuse concentration of heinous crimes on a single Judge. In 2009, a notorious drug lord whom Judge Rosales convicted of violating the Philippine Dangerous Drugs Act was suspected of sending death threats to Supreme Court Justice Arturo Brion Justice Brion reportedly blocked the acquittal of the drug lord and affirmed the conviction of the death sentence. Judge Voltaire Y. Rosales has come to be known for being \\"fearless, upright and evenhanded\\" bringing honor to the maligned judicial system of the Philippines.

The mall opened in 1967 and was renovated and renamed in 2004. The mall's anchor stores are Burlington and JCPenney. There are 2 vacant anchor stores that were last occupied by Macy's and Sears. The mall was previously owned by Walton Street Capital LLC of Chicago until May 2013 when Vintage Real Estate acquired the mall with plans to renovate and turnaround the struggling mall. As of January 8, 2020, the mall is now owned by Hull Property Group.https://www.masslive.com/worcester/2020/01/leominsters- mall-at-whitney-field-was-sold-for-16-million-on-christmas-eve-to-georgia- retail-real-estate-company.html History The mall's food court as of 2014 The Mall at Whitney Field opened in 1967 as the \\"Searstown Mall\\". The mall originally opened with Sears, R. H. White, and Bradlees as anchors. Market Basket was next to W.T. Grant with an outside entrance and was where Toys \\"R\\" Us was. The mall was expanded substantially in the 1980s adding a long wing created from the closed R. H. White building, leading to a new JCPenney store. In 1992 Sage-Allen closed their store at the mall and was replaced by a Service Merchandise store. Around that time, Toys \\"R\\" Us built a store that was attached to Bradlees, but only had an exterior entrance. Market Basket is now located on an outlot. In 1999, more changes came to the mall. Service Merchandise closed their store in 1999 and as a result, the long side wing leading to their old store emptied out. In 2000, the mall big-boxed the wing turning much of it into an Old Navy store along with replacing Service Merchandise with a Circuit City store. After Bradlees departure in 2001, the mall was left with a large vacancy. The former Bradlees store was later demolished in 2002 and its former mall entrance was replaced with an outdoor entrance to the mall. In the same year, Filene's opened a large two-level store at the mall, one entrance down from the former Bradlees store. In 2004, the mall was extensively renovated and renamed to \\"The Mall at Whitney Field\\", most likely an attempt to bring shoppers to the mall from the more affluent I-495 suburbs, rather than only bringing in shoppers from the immediate cities of Fitchburg and Leominster. In 2007, The Mall at Whitney Field was sold for $82 million to Walton Street Capital LLC of Chicago with Jones Lang LaSalle continuing as the mall's manager. Circuit City was later closed and replaced with Ultimate Electronics in 2010. The chain went out of business only a year later. Steve & Barry's became Jo-Ann Fabrics in 2010. In 2013, The mall changed ownership once again. The mall was sold from Walton Street Capital LLC of Chicago to California-based Vintage Real Estate for an undisclosed price. Vintage Real Estate bought the center with plans to renovate and turnaround the struggling mall. They also took over management from Jones Lang LaSalle. Immediately after Vintage Real Estate acquired the mall, they announced the signing of a ten-year lease with Burlington Coat Factory to occupy the former Circuit City space that has been vacant for years. Burlington Coat Factory expects the store to open in early 2014. Old Navy, which used to have an exterior entrance only, moved into a vacant space inside the mall in order to accommodate the addition of Burlington Coat Factory. The new store opened in spring 2014 and features both an interior and exterior entrance. On March 14, 2018, Toys \\"R\\" Us announced that they will be closing all 800 locations in the U.S., including the Mall at Whitney Field location due to bankruptcy. The store closed on June 29, 2018. In August 2018, Jones Lang LaSalle once again took over management of the mall, led by their longtime general manager Elizabeth Kelley. In March 2019, Gardner Furniture Outlet opened in the former Toys \\"R\\" Us space. On November 7, 2019, it was announced that Sears would be closing as part of a plan to close 96 stores nationwide. The store closed on February 15, 2020.https://www.businessinsider.com/sears-to-close-96-more- stores-kmart-list-sears-transformco-2019-11 On January 7, 2020, it was announced that Macy's would also be closing in April 2020 as part of a plan to close 29 stores nationwide which left Burlington and JCPenney as the only anchors left.https://www.sentinelandenterprise.com/2020/01/07/leominster- macys-set-to-close/ On January 8, 2020, the mall was sold once again, this time to Hull Property Group.https://www.masslive.com/worcester/2020/01/leominsters-mall-at-whitney- field-was-sold-for-16-million-on-christmas-eve-to-georgia-retail-real-estate- company.html In March 2020, the Chuck E.

The most commonly used form was the mechanical clock systems that required a key for manual punching of a number to a strip of paper inside with the time pre-printed on it. Recently, electronic systems have increased in popularity due to their light weight, ease of use, and downloadable logging capabilities The Detex Watchman's Clock Album, Philip Haselton.

This increase in the electronic systems led the largest U.S. manufacturer of watchclocks, Detex, to discontinue all of their mechanical watchclocks on December 31, 2011 including the Detex Newman which had been manufactured for 130 years. Watchclocks often had a paper or light cardboard disk or paper tape placed inside for a set period of time usually 24 hours for disk models, and 96 hours for tape models. The user would carry the clock to each checkpoint where a numbered key was mounted (typically chained in place, ensuring that the user was present). That key was then inserted into the clock, turned, and imprint the disk with the key number. The paper disk or tape had the times pre printed and the key impressed the key number on the corresponding time. After the shift (or Specified time period) an authorized person (usually a supervisor) would unlock the watchclock and retrieve the disk or tape and insert a new one. In the case of Detex brand clocks, each time the cover is opened or closed a mechanical device would puncture the disk or tape at the current time, if a disk had more than 2 perforations on it, it proved that the clock had been opened and possibly tampered with, or records forged. > \\"The approximately five pound circular watchclock was enclosed in a black > leather pouch attached to a leather strap and carried over the shoulder. > Inside buildings mounted near doors, were watchclock stations consisting of > a small metal box with a hinged lid, which contained a numbered key affixed > by a twelve-inch chain.

The provincial charter, issued by William III and Mary II in 1691, was modified, and certain of its terms were clarified (hence the name \\"explanatory\\" being applied to this charter). Background The issuance of the Explanatory Charter was the result of a series of disputes between the Massachusetts General Court, the elected body representing the people of the province, and the crown-appointed royal governor, Samuel Shute. In 1720 Shute claimed the authority to veto the General Court's choice of speaker, and dissolved the legislature when it refused to elect someone else. He was again upset that the legislature voted to adjourn for one week in 1721, claiming it violated his authority to control the legislature's meetings. He raised these issues with the Privy Council of George I, which in 1725 issued the Explanatory Charter. Charter The modification of the William and Mary charter granted the governor the power to suspend the House of Representatives. It also clarified that the House of Representatives was allowed to choose its own speaker, subject to the governor's approval, and that it was allowed to adjourn for no more than two days. Later modifications to the Massachusetts provincial charter In 1766, another attempt was made to further modify the Explanatory Charter. The result was the choice of the council and superior court judges to be taken away from the legislature, appointment of sheriffs given to the governor, the selection of juries to the sheriffs, and forbade town meetings, except for elections or by special permission of the governor. In the wake of the 1773 Boston Tea Party, the British Parliament approved a series of acts, known as the Intolerable Acts, designed to punish Massachusetts in particular. One of these acts, the Massachusetts Government Act, essentially suspended the charter and gave the crown-appointed governor wide-ranging powers. General Thomas Gage was appointed royal governor in 1774, and implemented the Massachusetts Government Act, dissolving the provincial legislature. Members of the legislature met anyway, and established the Massachusetts Provincial Congress, which de facto governed most or all of Massachusetts from 1774 until the ratification of a Constitution or Form of Government for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in 1780.

It currently serves as a museum and archives. The building is purported to be the last standing of 11 such identical stations built around the world during the First World War.  Early Land Use  The building sits on land developed by early settlers James Pearl and Lady Anne Pearl.  HM Wireless Station  In 1914, the site was selected by the British Admiralty for a First World War communications post. It was constructed in 1915 by the Marconi Telegraph Company to serve the British Navy. It was built to intercept secret German naval transmissions, track icebergs, and track ships in distress: > The Admiralty designated H.M. Wireless Station at Mount Pearl as its North > Atlantic Intelligence Centre. Members of the Marconi Company were recruited > in to the British Navy and sent to work in the wireless station under the > command of Officer Lieutenant G.L.J. Wolley. In comparison to other wireless > stations in Newfoundland during that time, the H.M. Wireless station was > among the most powerful, employing state-of-the-art equipment that allowed > transmission and reception of signals over 1000 miles away. The station was guarded by members of the Newfoundland Royal Naval Reserve. On February 24, 1918, the HM Wireless Station received the distress signal from the SS Florizel', which had run aground near Cappahayden. The message read \\"S.O.S. Florizel ashore near Cape Race. Fast going to pieces.\\" The station relayed the message to the Bowring Brothers shipping agent and rescue ships were prepared. The station was dismantled in 1925 and the property was put up for auction.  Farm and Office Use  The property was sold in 1927 to Heber Parsons, who converted the wireless station into a farm house. The three 305 foot towers were used by the newly formed VONF radio station. In 1967 the property was sold to a housing development named Admiralty Wood. Later, it served as the offices for the local Housing Corporation.  Admiralty House Museum and Archives  In the 1990s, the City of Mount Pearl acquired the wireless station to rehabilitate and restore as a community facility and work began to the designs of architect William MacCallum: > The exterior work consisted of a new roof, clapboard and the restoration of > the large veranda. The wing that originally housed the commander of the > station was stripped revealing an original chimney and fireplace, and a > mantel was found to replicate the original.

Restoration > refurbishment was carried out under the supervision of Master Carpenter > Howard Roberts. The restoration cost was reported in 1996 as $700,000. Admiralty House Museum and Archives opened in the building in 1997. The site was officially opened by the H.R.M. Duke of Edinburgh on 23 June 1997. Since then, the building has housed a museum, with exhibits on the history of Mount Pearl, Guglielmo Marconi and wireless communications, the wreck of SS Florizel, and HMS Calypso (later HMS Briton), a training ship for the Newfoundland Royal Naval Reserve before and during World War I. The museum also house several collections and fonds detailing life in early 20th Century Canada. These include photos and documents from both World Wars. The Museum is affiliated with: CMA, CHIN, and Virtual Museum of Canada. In 2018, the museum halted construction work in its parking lot area when excavation revealed the footings of one of the original Marconi towers. In 2019, it partnered with local Landwash Brewery to brew a commemorative ale to mark the community's role in the 1919 transatlantic Daily Mail aviation prize. The ale was premiered at the launch of an exhibit detailing the story of the transatlantic air race from the perspective of St. John's socialite and photographer Margaret Carter.

Course Nevern estuary The source of the river is a spring on the southwest slope of Frenni Fawr, near Crymych. It flows southwest for a short distance, then to the north and then generally west, skirting the northern slopes of the Preseli Hills. Principal tributaries are Afon Bannon (L - i.e. left, facing downstream), Afon Brynberian (L) and Nant Duad (R). Nevern Bridge The river is bridged by several lanes and the B4329 Eglwyswrw to Crosswell road before passing beneath the A487 at Felindre Farchog. It is bridged by the B4582 at the Grade II-listed Nevern Bridge, then winds along wooded valleys until reaching its estuary at Newport, where it is bridged for the final time at Feidr Pen-y-Bont. The river discharges into the sea at Newport's old port area of Parrog where it is possible to ford the river on foot, with caution, at low tide.

W. 1987. Mycotoxins, mycotoxicoses, mycotoxicology and mycopathology. Mycopathlogia 100:3-5. In the food industry it is important to adopt measures that keep mycotoxin levels as low as practicable, especially those that are heat-stable. These chemical compounds are the result of secondary metabolism initiated in response to specific developmental or environmental signals. This includes biological stress from the environment, such as lower nutrients or competition for those available. Under this secondary path the fungus produces a wide array of compounds in order to gain some level of advantage, such as incrementing the efficiency of metabolic processes to gain more energy from less food, or attacking other microorganisms and being able to use their remains as a food source. Mycotoxins are made by fungi and are toxic to vertebrates and other animal groups in low concentrations. Low-molecular- weight fungal metabolites such as ethanol that are toxic only in high concentrations are not considered mycotoxins. Mushroom poisons are fungal metabolites that can cause disease and death in humans and other animals; they are rather arbitrarily excluded from discussions of mycotoxicology. Molds make mycotoxins; mushrooms and other macroscopic fungi make mushroom poisons. The distinction between a mycotoxin and a mushroom poison is based not only on the size of the producing fungus, but also on human intention. Mycotoxin exposure is almost always accidental. In contrast, with the exception of the victims of a few mycologically accomplished murderers, mushroom poisons are usually ingested by amateur mushroom hunters who have collected, cooked, and eaten what was misidentified as a harmless, edible species.Moss, M. O. 1996. Mycotoxins. Mycol. Res. 100:513-523. Mycotoxins are hard to define and are also very difficult to classify. Mycotoxins have diverse chemical structures, biosynthetic origins, myriad biological effects, and produce numerous different fungal species. Classification generally reflects the training of the categorizer and does not adhere to any set system. Mycotoxins are often arranged by physicians depending on what organ they effect. Mycotoxins can be categorized as nephrotoxins, hepatoxins, immunotoxins, neurotoxins, etc. Generic groups created by cell biologist are teratogens, mutagens, allergens, and carcinogens. Organic chemists have attempted to classify them by their chemical structures (e.g., lactones, coumarins); biochemists according to their biosynthetic origins (polyketides, amino acid-derived, etc.); physicians by the illnesses they cause (e.g., St. Anthony's fire, stachybotryotoxicosis), and mycologists by the fungi that produce them (e.g., Aspergillus toxins, Penicillium toxins). None of these classifications is entirely satisfactory. Aflatoxin, for example, is a hepatotoxic, mutagenic, carcinogenic, difuran- containing, polyketide-derived Aspergillus toxin. Zearalenone is a Fusarium metabolite with potent estrogenic activity; hence, in addition to being called (probably erroneously) a mycotoxin, it also has been labeled a phytoestrogen, a mycoestrogen, and a growth promotant.Clin Microbiol Rev. 2003 July; 16(3): 497–516.  Types of Mycotoxins  Citrinin: Citrinin was first isolated from Penicillium citrinum prior to World War II;Hetherington, A. C., and H. Raistrick. 1931. Studies in the biochemistry of microorganisms. Part XIV. On the production and chemical constitution of a new yellow colouring matter, citrinin, produced from glucose by Penicillium citrinum Thom. Phil. Trans. R. Soc. London Ser. B 220B:269-295. subsequently, it was identified in over a dozen species of Penicillium and several species of Aspergillus (e.g., Aspergillus terreus and Aspergillus niveus), including certain strains of Penicillium camemberti (used to produce cheese) and Aspergillus oryzae (used to produce sake, miso, and soy sauce).Manabe, M. 2001. Fermented foods and mycotoxins. Mycotoxins 51:25-28 More recently, citrinin has also been isolated from Monascus ruber and Monascus purpureus, industrial species used to produce red pigments.Blanc, P. J., M. O. Loret, and G. Goma. 1995. Production of citrinin by various species of Monascus. Biotechnol. Lett. 17:291-294. Aflatoxins: The aflatoxins were isolated and characterized after the death of more than 100,000 turkey poults (turkey X disease) was traced to the consumption of a mold-contaminated peanut meal.Blout, W.

The four major aflatoxins are called B1, B2, G1, and G2 based on their fluorescence under UV light (blue or green) and relative chromatographic mobility during thin-layer chromatography. Aflatoxin B1 is the most potent natural carcinogen known Squire, R. A. 1981. Ranking animal carcinogens: a proposed regulatory approach. Science 214:877-880 and is usually the major aflatoxin produced by toxigenic strains. It is also the best studied: in a large percentage of the papers published, the term aflatoxin can be construed to mean aflatoxin B1. However, well over a dozen other aflatoxins (e.g., P1. Q1, B2a, and G2a) have been described, especially as mammalian biotransformation products of the major metabolites.Heathcote, J. G., and J. R. Hibbert. 1978. Aflatoxins: chemical and biological aspects. Elsevier Scientific Publishing Company, Amsterdam, The Netherlands The classic book Aflatoxin: Scientific Background, Control, and Implications, published in 1969, is still a valuable resource for reviewing the history, chemistry, toxicology, and agricultural implications of aflatoxin research. Fumonisins: Fumonisins were first described and characterized in 1988.Bezuidenhout, S. C., W. C. A. Gelderblom, C. P. Gorst-Allman, R. M. Horak, W. F. O. Marasas; G. Spiteller, and R. Vleggaar. 1988.

The most abundantly produced member of the family is fumonisin B1. They are thought to be synthesized by condensation of the amino acid alanine into an acetate-derived precursor.Sweeney, M. J., and A. D. W. Dobson. 1999. Molecular biology of mycotoxin production. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 175:149-163. Fumonisins are produced by a number of Fusarium species, notably Fusarium verticillioides (formerly Fusarium moniliforme = Gibberella fujikuroi), Fusarium proliferatum, and Fusarium nygamai, as well as Alternaria alternata f. sp. lycopersici.Rheeder, J.

The major species of economic importance is Fusarium verticillioides, which grows as a corn endophyte in both vegetative and reproductive tissues, often without causing disease symptoms in the plant. However, when weather conditions, insect damage, and the appropriate fungal and plant genotype are present, it can cause seedling blight, stalk rot, and ear rot.Nelson, P. E., A. E. Desjardins, and R. D. Plattner. 1993. Fumonisins, mycotoxins produced by Fusarium species: biology, chemistry and significance. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 31:233-252. Fusarium verticillioides is present in virtually all corn samples.Marshall, E. 1983. Yellow rain experts battle over corn mold. Science 221:526-529. Most strains do not produce the toxin, so the presence of the fungus does not necessarily mean that fumonisin is also present.Plumlee, K. H., and F. D. Galey. 1994.

Toxicol. 2:499-524 Nevertheless, many mycotoxin reviews reiterate erroneous species lists. Patulin: Patulin, 4-hydroxy-4H-furo[3,2c]pyran-2(6H)-one, is produced by many different molds but was first isolated as an antimicrobial active principle during the 1940s from Penicillium patulum (later called Penicillium urticae, now Penicillium griseofulvum). The same metabolite was also isolated from other species and given the names clavacin, claviformin, expansin, mycoin c, and penicidin.Ciegler, A., R. W. Detroy, and E. B. Lillejoj. 1971. Patulin, penicillic acid and other carcinogenic lactones, p. 409-434. In A. Ciegler, S. Kadis and S. J. Ajl (ed.), Microbial toxins, vol. VI: fungal toxins. Academic Press. New York, N.Y. A number of early studies were directed towards harnessing its antibiotic activity. For example, it was tested as both a nose and throat spray for treating the common cold and as an ointment for treating fungal skin infectionsCiegler, A. 1977. Patulin, p. 609-624. In J. V. Rodricks, C. W. Hesseltine, and M. A. Mehlman (ed.), Mycotoxins in human and animal health. Pathotox Publishers, Inc., Park Forest South, Ill. However, during the 1950s and 1960s, it became apparent that, in addition to its antibacterial, antiviral, and antiprotozoal activity, patulin was toxic to both plants and animals, precluding its clinical use as an antibiotic. During the 1960s, patulin was reclassified as a mycotoxin. Trichothecenes: The trichothecenes constitute a family of more than sixty sesquiterpenoid metabolites produced by a number of fungal genera, including Fusarium, Myrothecium, Phomopsis, Stachybotrys, Trichoderma, Trichothecium, and others.Cole, R. J., and R. H. Cox. 1981. Handbook of toxic fungal metabolites. Academic Press, New York, N.Y.Scott, P. M. 1989. The natural occurrence of trichothecenes, p. 1-26. In V. H. Beasley (ed.), Trichothecene mycotoxicosis: pathophysiologic effects, vol. I. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FlaUeno, Y. (ed.). 1983. Trichothecenes: chemical, biological and toxicological aspects. Elsevier, Amsterdam, The Netherlands The term trichothecene is derived from trichothecin, which was the one of the first members of the family identified. All trichothecenes contain a common 12,13-epoxytrichothene skeleton and an olefinic bond with various side chain substitutions. They are commonly found as food and feed contaminants, and consumption of these mycotoxins can result in alimentary hemorrhage and vomiting; direct contact causes dermatitis.Beasley, V. R.

Zearalenone: Zearalenone (6-[10-hydroxy-6-oxo-trans-1-undecenyl]-B-resorcyclic acid lactone), a secondary metabolite from Fusarium graminearum (teleomorph Gibberella zeae) was given the trivial name zearalenone as a combination of G. zeae, resorcylic acid lactone, -ene (for the presence of the C-1′ to C-2 double bond), and -one, for the C-6′ ketone.Urry, W. H., H. L. Wehrmeister, E. B. Hodge, and P. H. Hidy. 1966. The structure of zearalenone. Tetrahedron Lett. 27:3109-3114 Almost simultaneously, a second group isolated, crystallized, and studied the metabolic properties of the same compound and named it F-2.Christensen, C. M., G. H. Nelson, and C. J. Mirocha. 1965. Effect on the white rat uterus of a toxic substance isolated from Fusarium. Appl. Microbiol. 13:653-659Mirocha, C. J., C. M. Christensen, and G. H. Nelson. 1967. Estrogenic metabolite produced by Fusarium graminearum in stored grain. Appl. Microbiol. 15:497-503 Much of the early literature uses zearalenone and F-2 as synonyms; the family of analogues are known as zearalenones and F-2 toxins, respectively. Perhaps because the original work on these fungal macrolides coincided with the discovery of aflatoxins, chapters on zearalenone have become a regular fixture in monographs on mycotoxins (see, for example, Mirocha and Christensen Mirocha, C. J., and C. M. Christensen. 1974. Oestrogenic mycotoxins synthesized by Fusarium, p. 129-148. In I. F. H. Purchase (ed.), Mycotoxins. Elsevier, Amsterdam, The Netherlands and Betina Betina, V. 1989. Bioactive molecules vol. 9. Mycotoxins: chemical, biological and environmental aspects. Elsevier, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Nevertheless, the word toxin is almost certainly a misnomer because zearalenone, while biologically potent, is hardly toxic; rather, it sufficiently resembles 17β-estradiol, the principal hormone produced by the human ovary, to allow it to bind to estrogen receptors in mammalian target cells Kuiper-Goodman, T., P. M. Scott, and H. Watanabe. 1987. Risk assessment of the mycotoxin zearalenone. Regul. Toxicol. Pharmacol. 7:253-306 Zearalenone is better classified as a nonsteroidal estrogen or mycoestrogen. Sometimes it is called a phytoestrogen. For the structure- activity relationships of zearalenone and its analogues, see Hurd Hurd, R. N. 1977.

Symptoms generally includes pain at the base of the thumb which is worse with use of the hand. The anatomic snuffbox is generally tender and swelling may occur. Complications may include nonunion of the fracture, avascular necrosis, and arthritis. Scaphoid fractures are most commonly caused by a fall on an outstretched hand. Diagnosis is generally based on examination and medical imaging. Some fractures may not be visible on plain X-rays. In such cases a person may be casted with repeat X-rays in two weeks or an MRI or bone scan may be done. The fracture may be preventable by using wrist guards during certain activities. In those in whom the fracture remains well aligned a cast is generally sufficient. If the fracture is displaced then surgery is generally recommended. Healing may take up to six months. It is the most common wrist bone fracture. Males are affected more often than females. Signs and symptoms Anatomical snuff box People with scaphoid fractures generally have snuff box tenderness. Focal tenderness is usually present in one of three places: 1) volar prominence at the distal wrist for distal pole fractures; 2) anatomic snuff box for waist or midbody fractures; 3) distal to Lister's tubercle for proximal pole fractures. =Complications= Scaphoid pseudarthrosis, before and after treatment with Herbert screw. Vascular supply of the scaphoid comes from two different vascular pedicles. 20-30% of the blood supply (a.) comes from the volar branch of the radial artery and enters the bone at the tubercle. 70-80% comes from (b.) the dorsal branch of the radial artery and travels towards the proximal pole. Avascular necrosis (AVN) is a common complication of a scaphoid fracture. Since the scaphoid blood supply comes from two different vascular branches of the radial artery, fractures can limit access to blood supply. Risk of AVN depends on the location of the fracture. * Fractures in the proximal 1/3 have a high incidence of AVN (~30%) * Waist fractures in the middle 1/3 is the most frequent fracture site and has moderate risk of AVN. * Fractures in the distal 1/3 are rarely complicated by AVN. Non union can also occur from undiagnosed or undertreated scaphoid fractures. Arterial flow to the scaphoid enters via the distal pole and travels to the proximal pole. This blood supply is tenuous, increasing the risk of nonunion, particularly with fractures at the wrist and proximal end. If not treated correctly non-union of the scaphoid fracture can lead to wrist osteoarthritis. Symptoms may include aching in the wrist, decreased range of motion of the wrist, and pain during activities such as lifting or gripping. If x-ray results show arthritis due to an old break, the treatment plan will first focus on treating the arthritis through anti- inflammatory medications and wearing a splint when an individual feels pain in the wrist. If these treatments do not help the symptoms of arthritis, steroid injections to the wrist may help alleviate pain. Should these treatments not work, surgery may be required.  Mechanism  Scaphoid fractures occur in three locations: (A) Distal tubercle, (B) waist, and (C) proximal pole. Fractures of scaphoid can occur either with direct axial compression or with hyperextension of the wrist, such as a fall on the palm on an outstretched hand (FOOSH). Using the Herbert classification system, there are three main types of scaphoid fractures. 10%-20% of fractures are at the proximal pole, 60%-80% are at the waist (middle), and the remainder occur at the distal pole. Diagnosis Fracture of the tubercle of the scaphoid bone of the wrist Scaphoid fractures are often diagnosed by PA and lateral X-rays. However, not all fractures are apparent initially. Therefore, people with tenderness over the scaphoid (those who exhibit pain to pressure in the anatomic snuff box ) are often splinted in a thumb spica for 7–10 days at which point a second set of X-rays is taken. If there was a hairline fracture, healing will now be apparent. Even then a fracture may not be apparent. A CT Scan can then be used to evaluate the scaphoid with greater resolution. The use of MRI, if available, is preferred over CT and can give one an immediate diagnosis. Bone scintigraphy is also an effective method for diagnosis fracture which do not appear on Xray.

CC-BY 3.0 Treatment Treatment of scaphoid fractures is guided by the location in the bone of the fracture (proximal, waist, distal), displacement (or instability) of the fracture, and patient tolerance for cast immobilization. Non displaced or minimally displaced waist and distal fractures have a high rate of union with closed cast management. The choice of short arm, short arm thumb spica or long arm cast is debated in the medical literature and no clear consensus or proof of the benefit of one type of casting or another has been shown; although it is generally accepted to use a short arm or short arm thumb spica for non displaced fractures. Non displaced or minimally displaced fracture can also be treated with percutaneous or minimal incision surgery which if performed correctly has a high union rate, low morbidity and faster return to activity than closed cast management. Fractures that are more proximal take longer to heal. It is expected the distal third will heal in 6 to 8 weeks, the middle third will take 8–12 weeks, and the proximal third will take 12–24 weeks. The Scaphoid receives its blood supply primarily from lateral and distal branches of the radial artery. Blood flows from the top/distal end of the bone in a retrograde fashion down to the proximal pole; if this blood flow is disrupted by a fracture, the bone may not heal. Surgery is necessary at this point to mechanically mend the bone together. Percutaneous screw fixation is recommended over an open surgical approach when it is possible to achieve acceptable bone alignment closed as minimal incisions can preserves the palmar ligament complex and local vasculature, and help avoid soft tissue complications. This surgery includes screwing the scaphoid bone back together at the most perpendicular angle possible to promote quicker and stronger healing of the bone. Internal fixation can be done dorsally with a percutaneous incision and arthroscopic assistance Slade JF 3rd, Gutow AP, Geissler WB. Percutaneous internal fixation of scaphoid fractures via an arthroscopically assisted dorsal approach. J Bone Joint Surg Am. 2002;84-A Suppl 2:21-36. doi:10.2106/00004623-200200002-00003 or via a minimal open dorsal approach , or via a volar approach in which case slight excavation of the edge of the trapezium bone may be necessary to reach the scaphoid as 80% of this bone is covered with articular cartilage, which makes it difficult to gain access to the scaphoid.  Epidemiology  Fractures of the scaphoid are common in young males. They are less common in children and older adults because the distal radius is weaker contributor to the wrist and more likely to fracture in these age groups. Scaphoid fractures account for 50%-80% of carpal injuries. Terminology These are also called navicular fractures (the scaphoid also being called the carpal navicular), although this can be confused with the navicular bone in the foot.

T E Lawrence and the Arab Revolt 1916–1918, a scene (probably a set piece for cinema representation), showing a crowd of soldiers, both local and Indian, at Wejh, a port on the Red Sea coast north of Yenbo, 1913 (First World War, Pre-1914) Overview Arab cinema refers to the film industry in the Arab world. There is no single description of Arab cinema since it includes films from various countries and cultures of the Arab world and therefore does not have one form, structure, or style. In its inception, Arab cinema was mostly an imitation of Western Cinema. However; it has and continues to constantly change and evolve. Arab Cinema is a constantly changing and evolving industry. It mostly includes films made in Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Kuwait, Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia. However, Egypt is a pioneer among Arab countries in the field of cinema. Each country in the region has its own unique characteristics and identifiable brand of cinema. Elsewhere in North Africa and the Middle East, film production was scarce until the late 1960s and early 1970s when filmmakers began to received funding and financial assistance from state organizations. This was during the post-independence and is when most Arab cinema took root. Most films produced at that time were funded by the state and contained a nationalistic dimension. These films helped to advance certain social causes such as independence, and other social, economic and political agendas. A sustained film industry was able to emerge in Egypt when other parts of the Arab world had only been able to sporadically produce feature- length films due to limited financing. Arabic cinema is dominated by films from Egypt. Three quarters of all Arab movies are produced in Egypt. According to film critic and historian Roy Armes, the Cinema of Lebanon is the only other cinema in the Arabic-speaking region, beside Egypt's, that could amount to a national cinema.Armes, Roy. Arab Filmmakers of the Middle East: a Dictionary, page 26 While Egyptian and Lebanese cinema have a long history of production, most other Arab countries did not witness film production until after independence, and even today, the majority of film production in countries like Bahrain, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, and the United Arab Emirates is limited to television or short films. There is increased interest in films originating in the Arab world. For example, films from Algeria, Lebanon, Morocco, Palestine, Syria and Tunisia are making wider and more frequent rounds than ever before in local film festivals and repertoire theaters. Arab cinema has explored many topics from politics, colonialism, tradition, modernity and social taboos. It has also attempted to escape from its earlier tendency to mimic and rely on Western film devices. In fact, colonization did not only influence Arab films, but it also had an impact on Arab movies theaters. Apart from the history of Arab cinema, recently the portrayal of women became an important aspect in the production of Arab cinema. Arab woman shaped a great portion of the film industry in the Arab world by employing their cinematic talents in improving the production of Arab films. However, the production of Arab cinema has declined in the last decades and many filmmakers in the Middle East gathered to hold a meeting and discuss the current state of Arab cinema.  Origins  = Film production in Arab cinema = The Arab cinema did not flourish before the national independence of each of them, and even after, the films production of the Arab cinema was restricted to short-length films. However, there were exceptions for some of them. For example, Egypt scored the highest number in producing films for cinema amongst Arabs and produced more than 2,500 feature films. During the 1950s and 1960s Lebanon produced 180 feature films. Two full-length Kuwaiti films were produced at the end of 1970s, and a full-length Bahraini film was produced in 1989. Syria produced around 150 films, Tunisia approximately 130, 100 films produced from each of Algeria and Iraq, Morocco almost 70, and Jordan’s productions were less than 12. = Impact of conflict on Egyptian and Palestinian cinema = The history of the Arab cinema primarily revolved around was impacted by political challenges such as the Egyptian revolution of 1952, the defeat of Israel in 1967 and the Palestinian resistance. However, during the Egyptian revolution of 1952 the feudalism system was substituted with a nationalism ideology led by the Rais. This new government have impacted the film industry in which many of the film produced were ‘social realism’ films depicting the real life of Egypt. Many of the films produced by Salah Abou Seifin 1952 were neorealism such as Master Hassanwhich portrayed the difficulties of the different classes in Cairo. Moreover, this system is said to be derived from the Italian neorealism, however, it wasn't very successful as only a few films were produced. After the defeat of the 1967, where Israel defeated the Arab nation, An Association of New Cinema was introduced and in 1968, the representatives of this association wrote a manifesto which call for “the emergence of a new cinema with deep roots in contemporary Egypt” where “It is necessary to establish a real dialogue within the Egyptian culture in order to create new forms”. However, the Palestinian resistance has inspired many of the Arab filmmakers since the 1948 to produce films about their struggle. In fact, in 1972, an Association of Palestinian was developed to bring all the Arab filmmakers together who their work was about the Palestinian resistance.  Movie theaters in the Arab world  The influence of films and cinemas on Arabs was due to the effect of the West on the Arab World, therefore, natives were not the owners for the movie theaters that are located in their own lands. The first cinema in Egypt was built by the French company Pathé in 1906 in Cairo, aside from the cinématographe that is owned by the Lumière Brothers in Alexandria and Cairo. In 1908 a cinema was opened in Jerusalem that is called Oracle by the Egyptian Jews. Where in Tunisia they had the Omnia Pathé which did not launch before 1907. In 1908, in some of Algerian cities, the cinemas were built in places depending on the population of Europeans who live in Algeria, like Oran for example. Less than 20 years later, most of the Arab countries had more than a theatre for films screening. In Saudi Arabia and North Yemen cinemas were not accepted or prohibited because of religious objections. But in 1960s to 1970s this issue was, in general, solved and accepted by King Faisal, the king of Saudi Arabia. However, in alliance with the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia Muhammed Bin Salman's vision of 2030, which calls to expand the artistic, cultural, and entertaining fields in the country, there opened the first Cinema in Jeddah on April 18, 2018.https://www.alarabiya.net/ar/saudi-today/2018/04/18/شاهد- افتتاح-أول-سينما-في-السعودية-بعد-غياب-35-سنة  Full-length Arab films  Full-length feature films began to be produced locally in the Arab world after the 1920s. Like the Syrian film Al-Muttaham Albari’ (The Innocent Accused) which was presented in 1928, Mughamarat Ilyas Mabruk (The Adventures of Ilyas Mabruk) in Lebanon 1929, the Egyptian film Laylain 1927. At this time, the process of inserting the sound into movies used to be done in Paris, and Egypt were able to produce two sound film, one is entitled Awlad Al-Bhawat (Sons of Aristocrats) and the other is Unshudat Al-Fu’ad (The Song of the Heart). Although these films are produced in the Arab World, they mostly are directed, produced, or had any artistic sides from foreigners or immigrants.  Role of women in Arab cinema  Women succeeded in representing 6 percent of the total number of feature filmmakers in the Maghreb during the 1990s, and less in percentages in the Middle East.Armes, R. (2015). New voices in arab cinema. Retrieved from https://ebookcentral.proquest.com The first 35mm feature film that is directed by an Algerian woman is called Rachida, by director Yamina Bachir-Chouikh, and it was released in 2002 to be screened in cinemas. In the 2000s number of women in film medium increased and was likeable in Lebanon, Morocco, and Tunisia. Arab women directors were more considerable to women's lives in the Arab World. Arab women also pioneered in screenwriting, where some as the Algerian novelist and the prize-winning Assia Djebar and Hafsa Zinaï-Koudil made their own feature films. One was released in 1978 and the other in 1993. Women from the Middle East who were interested in filmmaking, were cared of since they, who were born during the 1960s and 1970s, were sent to study about this medium in the United States, such as Najwa Najja rfrom Palestine and Dahna Abourahme from Lebanon, and others who studied Paris, Canada, and New York. Therefore, the European style in their feature films is quietly noticeable, apart from the effect of colonisation.Rizi, N. (2015). New Voices in Arab Cinema by Roy Armes. Film Quarterly, 69(2), 90–92. doi:10.1525/fq.2015.69.2.90 Arab filmmaker women also had an important role in providing sense of civil war traumas that happened during the war. Also, providing some of social issues in films; the social issues were specifically related to women, like the sexual abuse issues for example. Director Yamina Bachir-Chouikh was so considerate to reveal these kinds of stories, which some, preferred to keep buried because they did not want to face this unpleasant reality.Jones, C. (2014). Le Cinéma de l'urgence: Revisiting Yamina Bachir-Chouikh's Rachida and Djamila Sahraoui's \\"Barakat!\\" Dalhousie French Studies, 103, 33–43. Retrieved from http://www.jstor.org/stable/43487462  Rise of young Arab filmmakers  The young generation of filmmakers born in the 1960s had used the cinema as a way of expressing their national identity and the political history of their country, since the Middle East have experienced many political uprisings including wars and invasions. Although these independent filmmakers had their own cinematic approaches, they were heavily influenced by the West, especially France through European film training and other program that were offered. These young Arab filmmakers produced films concerning issues related to the freedom of expression and the role of women in society. In fact, Arab filmmakers such as Nadia El Fani and Laila Marrakchi made films that were sexually explicit and unlikely to be depicted in the Arab cinema. These female filmmakers and many others, especially from Lebanon, Tunisia and Morocco focused on shedding light on woman's issues in the Arabic screen. However, Armes believes that “the views of the 2000s generation [of filmmakers] are defined by the pressures and possibilities of globalization.” Many of the young Arab independent filmmakers have hybrid identities and the different personal and global references are reflected in their films and Rizi describes this form of issue as “transnationality.” For example, the producer of the Last Friday is Palestinian-Jordanian who was raised in Saudi Arabi and worked in the city of Amman. These cosmopolitan identities of independent Arab filmmakers have given them access to major funding institutions. The rise of the new technology in the Middle East have aided in the production of documentary films by young filmmakers through the availability of equipment. In fact, the film Five Broken Cameras by a Palestinian director speaks of the influence of these technologies in the region. Apart from documentaries, feature films were covering issues about national identity, diaspora and nostalgia as they were aiming to connect the outsiders with the Arab society. For example, the Algerian feature film Bled Number is about an Algerian who left France and returned to Algeria as his family greeted him with love and support. These young Arab filmmakers reflect their national, political and historical context of their countries into their films and also discusses issues related to criticism, freedom of expression and woman's role hoping for a brighter future.

With the goal of encouraging independent and auteur-based cinema, eligible filmmakers now have access to financial grants, screenwriting and pitch workshops, and personal meetings with industry mentors and experts.  Current state of Arab cinema  In the 21st century, many Arab filmmakers and cultural commentators are concerned about the current state and production of the Arab cinema. In November 2000, Arab filmmakers from eleven different countries across the Middle East held a meeting to further address this issue and discuss the future of the Arab cinema, as they are of the opinion that Arab cinema has been declining in popularity and quality. In fact, during the meeting, many of the directors, including the Omani, Kuwaiti, Emirati and Saudi participants believed there wasn't any film industry in their country to talk about. According to the Iraqi director, the film industry in his country has been suffering since the 1990s. The Palestinian filmmaker, Elia Suleiman, said that there are no interesting Arab films to watch any more. Moreover, even Egypt, ‘the Hollywood of the Arab world’ is declining and is unable to compete with Hollywood cinema and the American imported films. As, “the number of domestic productions has dramatically shriveled – from over sixty films a year in the 1960s to a little over a dozen a year today – and even those are being pushed out of theaters by the American imports”. One of the solutions, which the Egyptian filmmaker and director of El Medina, Yousry Nasrallah, came up with, is to establish a cinema for screening only Arab films, and he also ensures that there are people who are willing to invest in his project. One of the potential reasons for the decline in the production of the Arab cinema is due to the political conflicts. For example, the Palestinian cinema was introduced in 1976 and has always dealt with politics. Many of the films produced were documentaries about wars and refugee camps. Moreover, filmmakers across the Middle East such as Rashid Masharawi, Ali Nassar and many others began to also develop films on the Palestinian and Israeli conflict. According to Nana Asfour, the fall of the Arab cinema is partially due to the great restrictions and censorship the Arabs put on directors who produce challenging films such as Ziad Doueiri and Randa Chahal Sabbagand who travel to the West to screen their films. She concludes by saying that “If enough Arab filmmakers follow their [directors'] lead and if enough Arabs learn to appreciate and nurture their domestic talent, Arab cinema could very well find itself a worthy companion to the acclaimed film industry of neighboring Iran.\\"  See also  *Cinema of Egypt *Cinema of Lebanon *Cinema of Syria *Cinema of Jordan *Cinema of Libya *Cinema of Iraq *Cinema of Morocco *Cinema of Algeria *Cinema of Tunisia *Cinema of Saudi Arabia *Cinema of United Arab Emirates *Cinema of Qatar *Cinema of Kuwait *Cinema of Bahrain *Cinema of Oman *Cinema of Palestine *Cinema of Yemen *Cinema of Sudan References Further reading *Josef Gugler (ed.)

Kemes remained almost exclusively Welsh-speaking. =12th century= Following Henry I's death in 1135, anarchy followed due to conflict between rival claimants. Gruffydd took the opportunity to reconstruct Deheubarth. Raising an army, Gruffydd conquered much of former Deheubarth including Cemais by 1136. Robert fitz Martin was expelled from the lands. His son, William Fitz Martin, received Kemes as a dowry when he married Angharad, a daughter of Rhys ap Gruffydd.The Lords of Cemais, Dillwynn Miles, Haverfordwest, 1997 In 1189, King Henry II died, and Rhys went to Oxford to render homage to Henry's successor Richard the Lionheart;Dictionary of National Biography, 1885-1900, Volume 48, entry for Rhys ap Gruffydd, John Edward Lloyd he had been accompanied by Prince John (Richard's brother), but Richard actively refused to meet Rhys,The English in the Twelfth Century: Imperialism, National Identity, and Political Values, Prof. John Gillingham, 2000, London, p. 59 which made Rhys furious. In 1191, despite an previous oath not to do so, Rhys seized Cemais from William Fitz- Martin, and gave it to his son, Gruffydd. Rhys, however, had an older, bastard, son, Maelgwn, who had become a bitter rival of his brother; Welsh inheritance law allowed bastards to inherit, but Rhys preferred the English practice, which did not, and had been grooming Gruffydd as his successor. Maelgwn attacked Cemais, and took it from Gruffydd, eventually imprisoning his own fatherRhysin Nevern castle; a younger son, Hywel, eventually released him. When war broke out upon Rhys's death in 1197, between Maelgwn and Gruffydd, William fitz Martin re-established his control of Kemes, founding a new caput at Newport; the eventual victor of the warMaelgwndid not displace him. =13th century= Kemes remained with William's descendants during the 13th century; even though it was captured by Llywelyn Fawr in 1215 and his grandson in 1257, on both occasions the Fitz-Martins successfully recovered it.Newport Castle, Dillwyn Miles in The Archaeological Journal, issue 119, 1962 p.340 In 1326, two years after his similarly named father, the reigning Lord Martin (the Fitz having been dropped earlier in the previous century) died childless, and the Lordship was inherited by his sister, Joan, and her husband, James Audley. The Barons Audley arising from their marriage held the Lordship of Kemes until 1497, when the 7th Baron Audley rebelled against King Henry VII, failed, and was thus executed for high treason, with his lands declared forfeit. =16th century Pembrokeshire = In 1534, Henry VIII transferred the lands from the crown to John Tuchet, 8th Baron Audley, as an English feudal barony. Henry had already decided upon the course which would see the status of Marcher Lord entirely abolished the following year, by the first of the Laws in Wales Acts. This Act transformed the former Marcher Lordship of Kemes and the surrounding Marcher Lordship of Pembroke (together with Dewisland) into Pembrokeshire. Pembrokeshire was administratively subdivided into Hundreds, with Cemais largely falling into the new Hundred named Cemais,As defined in the 1851 census except for the parish of Llantood (which became part of the neighbouring Cilgerran hundred). A small portion of the former Cantref of Gwarthaf was also included in the Hundred of Cemais.

However, in 1981 Rabia was assassinated by the sons of party rival Jabr Muadi for allegedly refusing to keep to the rotation agreement.

He wrote several letters to the King Henry III of England describing miserable situation in the Holy Land. He initiated cooperation with other two military orders since there had been much rivalry among them before. This was agreed upon by their Grand Masters: Hugo de Revel of Hospitaliers and Anno von Sangershausen of Teutonic Knights. In 1266 the large Templar fortress of Safed was besieged by Egyptian Mameluks under Baibars, the new Sultan of Cairo, after a failed attempt to conquer Pilgrim's Castle. It appears that the fortress garrison was betrayed by a hired Syrian soldier. All Templars (and Hospitallers) were beheaded after they refused to convert to Islam. Other fortresses fell next, among them Beaufort, only recently acquired by the Templars. Also, the city of Antioch fell to Baibars and was never again held by Christian forces. The fall of Antioch left Templar fortresses in the Amanus Mountains easily accessible to attackers. Gaston, an immensely strong fortification on the road to Syria, was defended only by a small Templar garrison. Nevertheless, they decided to hold the fortress, but were betrayed by one of the brothers. Meanwhile, the Grand Master Thomas Bérard sent a messenger carrying an order to retreat to La Roche Guillaume. In February 1271, he ordered the surrender of Chastel Blanc with permission to retreat to Tortosa. In June, Montfort, the last inland fortification of Christians in the Holy Land, was yielded. Bérard sent messages to the pope asking for help, and the pope responded by calling for an Eighth Crusade, which never arrived. After the loss of Crac des Chevaliers by the Hospitallers in 1271 a ten-year truce was agreed between the Christians and the Muslims. According to \\"The Chronicle of the Templar of Tyre\\", Bérard died on 25 March 1273. References *Read, Piers Paul. The Templars. Da Capo, 1999. *Addison, Charles G.

He is often cited as one of the first people to use the word \\"modernism\\" in his 1908 book Modernism and Romance, in which he writes, \\"there are characteristics of modern life in general which can only be summed up, as Mr. Thomas Hardy and others have summed them up, by the word, modernism\\" (p. ix). Biography Scott-James was educated at Brasenose College, Oxford, and graduated in 1901. The Dictionary of National Biography states that Scott- James \\"possessed a strongly developed social conscience: this manifested itself at many different points in his career in activities which, if distinct from his literary gifts, at the same time enriched them\\" (872). In 1914, Scott-James, then a close friend of Wyndham Lewis, became the editor of the New Weekly, which did not survive the outbreak of war later that year. During the war, Scott-James enlisted in the Royal Garrison Artillery and fought in France, and by the end of the war he had risen to the rank of Captain and in 1918 was awarded the Military Cross. In 1934, Scott-James took over the editorship of the influential magazine, the London Mercury from J. C. Squire, in which he published many canonically recognized authors of modernism. The last issue of the London Mercury in April 1939 contained W. H. Auden's \\"In Memory of W. B. Yeats.\\" His daughter Anne Scott-James also became a prominent journalist.

He was the last Grand Master to preside in Palestine. Biography Guillaume was born around 1230, to be the youngest son of Guichard II of Beaujeu, Seigneur of Montpensier and Catherine, daughter of Guillaume VIII son of Dalfi d'Alvernha. He joined the Knights Templar in 1253, where he probably participated in the Seventh Crusade. He later went to the Kingdom of Jerusalem by 1260 or 1261, then he was captured during an ambush in the region of Tiberias, but released shorty after along with John II of Beirut and John de Embriaco. He was also part of the War of Saint Sabas, which deeply divided the nobility of the Crusader States and military orders. Hence, Baibars, Mamluk Sultan of Egypt, took the opportunity to conquer many Christian fortresses including Beaufort Castle, and destroy the Principality of Antioch. In 1271, he became commander of the Templars in Tripoli. Later on, he was appointed as Grand Master of the Knights Templar to succeed Thomas Bérard in 1273. During his tenure the new Mamluk Sultan, Qalawun, easily conquered Latakia, after an earthquake in March 1286, which was the only remaining port in the Principality of Antioch, followed by the County of Tripoli in 1289, which had ignored Beaujeu's warnings. In 1290, Qalawun marched on Acre, the capital of the remnant of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, but died in November before launching the attack. His son Al-Ashraf Khalil, however, decided to continue the campaign. Beaujeu led the defence of the city. At one point during the siege, he dropped his sword and walked away from the walls. His knights remonstrated. Beaujeu replied: \\"Je ne m'enfuis pas; je suis mort. Voici le coup.\\" (\\"I'm not running away; I am dead. Here is the blow.\\") He raised his arm to show the mortal wound he had received - an arrow had penetrated his mail under his armpit so that only the fletches were visible. Beaujeu died of his wound and the city fell to the Mamluks, signalling the end of Crusader occupation of the Holy Land.

He was educated at Boksburg High School and studied computer science at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg while working for De Beers' industrial diamond division. After graduation, he set up a computer software company, Frisoft Software, which he sold to Q Data (now named Business Connection) in 1994. He was a technical director with Q Data until he left South Africa in 1997. He moved to the UK in 1997 with his partner, Henry Badenhorst, to set up QSoft Consulting, an information technology consultancy firm. After a friend complained that he was too busy to look for a new boyfriend, they launched the Gaydar internet dating website in November 1999 from their home in Twickenham. The website rapidly became very popular and by 2007, Gaydar had nearly 4 million users in 23 countries. The Gaydar brand expanded into other areas: Frisch was chairman of GaydarRadio, a digital radio station founded in 2002. Badenhorst and Frisch's personal partnership broke up in 2006, although they remained business partners. Frisch was found dead below the window of his eighth-floor flat in Wandsworth, South London.

The aircraft crashed into the Holy Trinity Church of England School, demolishing three houses and the Sad Sack Snack Bar. The death toll was 61, including 38 children.The History of Freckleton, Carnegie Publishing Ltd, Peter Shakeshaft, 2001, p. 245 Crash Two newly refurbished B-24 heavy bombers, being made ready for delivery to the 2nd Combat Division, departed USAAF Base Air Depot 2 at Warton Aerodrome on a test flight at 10.30 am. Due to an approaching violent storm, both were recalled. By the time they had returned to the vicinity of the aerodrome, however, the wind and rain had significantly reduced visibility. Contemporary newspaper reports detailed wind velocities approaching ; water spouts in the Ribble Estuary; and flash flooding in Southport and Blackpool. On approach from the west, towards runway 08, and in formation with the second aircraft, First Lieutenant John Bloemendal, pilot of the first Consolidated B-24H Liberator USAAF serial number 42-50291 (named Classy Chassis II), reported to the control tower that he was aborting landing at the last moment and would perform a go-around. Shortly afterwards, and out of sight of the second aircraft, the aircraft hit the village of Freckleton, just east of the airfield. Already flying very low to the ground and with wings near vertical, the B-24's right wing tip hit a tree-top and was ripped away as it impacted with the corner of a building. The rest of the wing continued, ploughing along the ground and through a hedge. The fuselage of the 25-ton bomber continued, partly demolishing three houses and the Sad Sack Snack Bar that catered specifically for American servicemen from the airbase, before crossing Lytham Road and bursting into flames. After part of the aircraft hit the infants' wing of Freckleton Holy Trinity School, fuel from the ruptured tanks ignited and produced another sea of flames. The clock in one classroom stopped at 10.47 am. 52 people (the three crew members on the B-24, 34 children, one teacher, six American servicemen, one RAF airman and seven Snack Bar staff) died instantly, with nine others (four children, one teacher, an American serviceman and three RAF airmen) later dying in hospital from their injuries. Investigation The official report stated that the exact cause of the crash was unknown, but concluded that the pilot had not fully realised the danger that the storm posed until he was into his final approach, by which time he had insufficient altitude and speed to manoeuvre, given the probable strength of wind and downdraughts that must have prevailed. Structural failure of the aircraft in the extreme conditions was not ruled out, although the complete destruction of the airframe had precluded any meaningful investigation. Noting that many of the pilots coming to the UK commonly believed that British storms were little more than showers, the report recommended that all U.S. trained pilots should be emphatically warned of the dangers of British thunderstorms. Memorials The memorial in Freckleton, shortly after the 60th anniversary of the disaster A memorial garden and children's playground were opened in August 1945, in memory of those lost, the money for the playground equipment having been raised by American airmen at the Warton airbase. A fund for a memorial hall was started, and the hall was finally opened in September 1977. In addition to a memorial in the village churchyard, a marker was placed at the site of the accident in 2007.\\"We salute you...

The Joint Maritime Training Center (JMTC), previously known as the Special Missions Training Center (SMTC), is a joint United States Coast Guard, Navy, and Marine Corps training facility located on Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. JMTC's mission is to provide relevant and credible Maritime Security Training and Operational Testing and Evaluation in support of Department of Defense and Department of Homeland Security missions. JMTC comprises four main divisions: Weapons, Port Security, Engineering / Logistics, and Fast Boat. History The origins of the Joint Maritime Training Center lie in the Coast Guard Port Security Unit Training Detachment (PSU TRADET). Originally located in Port Clinton, Ohio, the PSU TRADET was tasked with improving the mission effectiveness, unit readiness, and providing pre-deployment support for the Coast Guard's Port Security Units (PSUs). In November 1998 PSU TRADET relocated to Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, North Carolina and by the summer of 2001 its mission had expanded to include non-lethal weapons and the Fast Boat Center of Excellence, as well as conducting training for cutter small boats over-the-horizon tactics designed to enhance interdiction abilities in counter narcotics operations. After the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, the PSU TRADET began training the newly created Coast Guard Maritime Safety and Security Teams (MSSTs). The unit grew and evolved to accommodate the broadened responsibilities and growing inter-agency and international training requests. In August 2002, the name of the command changed to Coast Guard Special Missions Training Center (SMTC) to better incorporate its multi- faceted capabilities. SMTC was commissioned as a Headquarters unit on 29 July 2003. In 2003, the U.S. Navy established a training detachment within SMTC to train Mobile Security Force (MSF) personnel as Tactical Coxswains and Crewmen, and in 2004 added crew served weapons training. The Marine Corps also established a small boat training detachment (SBTD) to support USMC operational requirements. In 2006, the NAVDET and MARDET commenced a two-year training surge for the Navy's new Naval Expeditionary Combat Command (NECC) Riverine Force. In 2008, SMTC completed the move to four new buildings within Courthouse Bay, and the unit was renamed for the second time as the Joint Maritime Training Center (JMTC) to more accurately reflect the unit's diverse range of multi-service military personnel and training center.

The Weapons Division identifies, tests, evaluates and develops tactics, techniques and procedures for maritime delivered weapons technologies. Additionally, the Weapons Division provides weapons training and support to both Fast Boat and Port Security Divisions. Training includes various service small arms, such as the M240B, M2 Browning machine gun and the Mk 19 grenade launcher crew-served weapons system. JMTC also operates Fire Arms Training Simulator IV (FATS), which supports crew served weapons training and tactics development. =Port Security Division = The Port Security Division provides Port Security Unit (PSU) and Maritime Safety and Security Team (MSST) training in counter-terrorism and force protection tactics, techniques, and procedures. Courses include chemical, biological, and radiological defense, basic skills courses, pier and vehicle searches, and military operations in urban terrain (MOUT). The Port Security Division also maintains a group of cultural guides and charts, maps, imagery and publications of strategic ports worldwide. =Engineering/Logistics Division= The Logistics Department, part of the Engineering and Logistics Division, provides the support, supplies and maintenance for all activities at JMTC. Procurement and contracting are done through various sources including those used by Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune as well as UNICOR, General Services Administration and commercial vendors. The Engineering Division handles all of the aspects of the vehicle and boat maintenance from routine preventative maintenance to ordering parts for vehicles used during training. =Fast Boat Division= The Fast Boat Division provides standardized, safe and relevant fast boat tactics and training to students. Inherent in this mission is the requirement for knowledgeable instructors, who maintain proficiency in the most up-to-date fast boat tactics, techniques and procedures for all US Coast Guard, US Navy, and US Marine Corps small boats. Within the Fast Boat Division, there are two sections: the Tactical Coxswain section, which instructs Navy Mobile Security Forces (NMSF), Maritime Safety and Security Teams (MSST), and Port Security Unit (PSU) coxswains, and the Cutter Boat Over-the-Horizon (CB-OTH) section, which teaches counter-narcotic operations to the cutter fleet.

Specifically, an entity should either be forbidden entirely, only one should be allowed, or any number of them should be allowed. Although various factors outside that particular software could limit this number in practice, it should not be the software itself that puts a hard limit on the number of instances of the entity. Examples of this rule may be found in the structure of many file systems' directories (also known as folders): * 0 – The topmost directory has zero parent directories; that is, there is no directory that contains the topmost directory. * 1 – Each subdirectory has exactly one parent directory (not including shortcuts to the directory's location; while such files may have similar icons to the icons of the destination directories, they are not directories at all). * ∞ (infinity) – Each directory, whether the topmost directory or any of its subdirectories, according to the file system's rules, may contain any number of files or subdirectories. Practical limits to this number are caused by other factors, such as space available on storage media and how well the computer's operating system is maintained. Note that violations of this rule of thumb do exist: for example, some file systems impose a limit of 65,536 (i.e. 216) files to a directory.

It has a high angle expansion section (20 to 50 degrees) right behind the nozzle throat; this is followed by a gradual reversal of nozzle contour slope so that at the nozzle exit the divergence angle is small, usually less than a 10 degree half angle. An ideal nozzle would direct all of the gases generated in the combustion chamber straight out the nozzle. That would mean the momentum of the gases would be axial, imparting the maximum thrust to the rocket. In fact, there are some non-axial components to the momentum. In terms of a momentum vector, there is an angle between the axis of the rocket engine and the gas flow. As a result, the thrust is lowered by varying amounts. The bell or contour shape is designed to impart a large angle expansion for the gases right after the throat. The nozzle is then curved back in to give a nearly straight flow of gas out the nozzle opening. The contour used is rather complex. The large expansion section near the throat causes expansion shock waves. The reversal of the slope to bring the exit to near zero degrees causes compression shock waves. A properly designed nozzle will have these two sets of shock waves coincide and cancel each other out. In this way, the bell is a compromise between the two extremes of the conical nozzle since it minimizes weight while maximizing performance. The most important design issue is to contour the nozzle to avoid oblique shocks and maximize performance. In his classic textbook, George P. Sutton credits Dr. G. V. R. Rao with working out the mathematics of the optimal bell nozzle design in 1955, while working at Rocketdyne.G.V.R. Rao Contoured Rocket Nozzles.

The satellite was built, launched and maintained by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). Weighing around 680 kg at launch, its applications will mainly be towards cartography in India. It was launched by a PSLV-7 rocket on 10 January 2007. Description Cartosat-2 carries a state-of-the-art panchromatic (PAN) camera that take black and white pictures of the earth in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The swath covered by this high resolution PAN camera is 9.6 km and their spatial resolution is less than 1 metre. The satellite can be steered up to 45° along as well as across the track. Cartosat-2 is an advanced remote sensing satellite capable of providing scene- specific spot imagery. The data from the satellite will be used for detailed mapping and other cartographic applications at cadastral level, urban and rural infrastructure development and management, as well as applications in Land Information System (LIS) and Geographical Information System (GIS). The first imagery, received on 12 January 2007, covered a length of 240 km from Paonta Sahib in Shivalik region to Delhi. Another set of imagery of about 50 km length covered Radhanagari to Sagoan in Goa. Analysis of the first imagery received at National Remote Sensing Agency's data reception station at Shadnagar, in Hyderabad, confirmed excellent performance of the on-board camera. Cartosat-2's panchromatic camera can produce images better than 1 metre in resolution, compared to the 82 cm panchromatic resolution offered by the Ikonos satellite. India had previously purchased images from Ikonos at about US$20 per square kilometre; the use of Cartosat-2 will provide imagery at 20 times lower cost. At the time of Cartosat-2's launch, India was buying about per year from Ikonos.

They were designed in Poland, in cooperation with the Soviet Navy and were built in Poland between 1967 and 2002. They now serve in several different navies, and some have been converted to civilian use. The name comes from the Stocznia Północna shipyard (Northern Shipyard) at Gdańsk, where they were built. 107 were built by 1986 (last 16 by Stocznia Marynarki Wojennej (Naval Shipyard) at Gdynia, Poland). In 2002, one ship of a modernised design NS-722 was built in Gdynia for Yemen. Characteristics The Polnocny-class ships are classified as medium landing ships in the Russian Navy, and are loosely equivalent to Western tank landing ships. They are equipped with a bow ramp that allows beach landings. The Polnocny-C version can carry 12 BMP-2 armored personnel carriers, or 4 Main Battle Tanks, or 250 Infantry Soldiers with their weapons like 82 mm Mortars and ATGMs, or 250 tons of rations & stores. Unlike their Western counterparts, these ships can provide substantial fire support for landed troops with their onboard multiple rocket launchers. Other armament consists of anti-aircraft guns and short-range surface-to-air missiles. Variants The Polnocny class comprises several sub-types that vary in size and capacity: *Polnocny-A (Project 770) (46 built): :Displacement: 800 tons full load :Length: 73 m :Speed: *Polnocny-B (Project 771) (36 built): :Displacement: 834 tons full load :Length: 73 m :Speed: *Polnocny-C (Project 773) (24 built) :Displacement: 1150 tons full load :Length: 81.3 m :Speed: *Modified Polnocny-C (Project 776) Amphibious Assault Command Ship (1 built - ORP Grunwald) :Displacement: 1253 tons full load :Length: 81.3 m :Speed: *Polnocny-D (Project 773U) (4 built) :Displacement: 1233 tons full load :Length: 81.3 m :Speed: :Aircraft facility: One helicopter platform *NS-722 class (1 built in 2002) :Displacement: 1,410 tons full load :Length: 88.7 m :Speed: :Aircraft facility: One helicopter platform Operational service Built in large quantities, the Polnocny-class ships were once the mainstay of the Soviet amphibious forces, and gave the Soviet naval infantry an effective force projection capability.

It was specifically catered to children, with the purpose of educating, entertaining, and enriching children's lives in the greater Los Angeles area. It was modeled after the children's museums in Boston, Indianapolis and Brooklyn. It opened to the public on June 11, 1979, and was located for 21 years at the Los Angeles Mall in the Los Angeles Civic Center. The museum featured a city street (with cars and motorcycles) with a sewer system that could be crawled through, Grandma's attic with wearable costumes, a large Lego play area, Sticky City consisting of large stuffed fabric blocks with velcro that stuck to each other and could be used for building, a TV studio where children could be camera operators or news anchors, a large photosensitive wall that would imprint shadows when the strobe light went off, a workshop where visitors could make their own Zoetrope animations, and other activities. It is also said to be the site where Rodney King had been the victim of police brutality on March 3rd, 1991 which resulted in the LA Riots. Closing and bankruptcy Due to the need for space and access the museum's Board of Governors decided to close the museum on August 27, 2000, with the intention of creating two new facilities: one in Little Tokyo, Los Angeles, and another at the San Fernando Valley's Hansen Dam. The Little Tokyo facility was indefinitely postponed in October 2002, and while construction of the Hansen Dam facility was begun with bond money in October 2005, the non-profit running the museum was unable to raise sufficient funds to populate the interior. The museum filed for bankruptcy on April 17, 2009, after investor Bruce Friedman had his assets frozen by a judge at the request of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in March 2009, having accusing him of stealing $17 million from investors. His donation of $10 million was subsequently withdrawn. The museum needed a further $22 million for construction to be completed. The city of Los Angeles had also invested over $10 million. Discovery Cube Los Angeles The City of Los Angeles entered into a partnership with Discovery Cube Orange County to take over and operate the empty Hansen Dam facility. City funding was allocated in April 2012, and federal funding was approved in January 2013. This satellite campus, named Discovery Cube Los Angeles, opened on November 13, 2014.

As chairman and founder of Villa Group, he is one of the country's wealthiest businessmen. Ibrahim ran for the Jumhooree Party in the presidential elections of 2013, but lost in the first round. Business career In 1969, he began work as a clerk at the government hospital in Malé. In 1973, he left the hospital to work as a manager at M/S Alia Furniture Mart. He subsequently worked for Crescent, a trading organisation of the Government, for a short period. In 1974 he joined an outlet of the Maldivian government's Bodu Store, now known as the State Trading Organisation. Two years later, he set up his own trading business in commodities such as rice, tobacco, diesel and kerosene, which proved to be profitable and the business experienced rapid growth. He later expanded his business with a small loan of US$2,000 from State Bank of India (SBI), which is still his primary banker. After four years, Ibrahim was able to purchase his first shipping vessel, an old fishing vessel converted to carry cargo and oil, to facilitate oil imports. By April 14, 1986, Ibrahim's business was registered under the name of Villa Shipping and Trading Company Limited (Villa). Since then, the company has diversified its business with substantial national share in diverse industries such as tourism, transport, construction, manufacturing, gas, cement trade, media and communication, in addition to general trading with sole distributorships of international products. Shell and Agfa are among the brand names represented by Villa in the Maldives. Private jet landing at Maamigili Airport The shareholders of the holding company, Villa Shipping & Trading Company Private Limited (VSTC) are Qasim Ibrahim and one of his wife, Rabia Hussain, holding 95% and 5% respectively. For strategic reasons, Villa Shipping (Singapore) Pte Limited was incorporated in Singapore on December 19, 1991, a 100% subsidiary. The paid up capital by Villa Shipping (Singapore) now stands at S$500,000. On 14 July 1996, with the primary objective of promoting Villa resorts, Villa Holidays Touristik GmbH opened in Frankfurt, Germany and was incorporated with a paid-up capital of DM 500,000. The company acts as a wholesaler for holiday packages to the Maldives, an agent for sales of hotel rooms, sale of air tickets, and a vehicle for acquiring and trading of tourism related properties and real estate such as hotels and resorts worldwide. It has since become a major subsidiary to promote the Group's own resorts, Fun Island, Paradise Island, Sun Island, Holiday Island and Royal Island. Villa Hotels, Tokyo and Villa Hotels, Hong Kong were established in 2001 and 2002 respectively. Ibrahim has also funded many infrastructure projects in several islands across the archipelago, most notably in developing harbours, construction of schools and mosques. He is currently working on setting up a full-fledged General Hospital in Maamigili Island, which will have the first cancer treatment facility in the country. Signing of MoU to develop the Maamigili General Hospital Master Plan Political career Acting President of Maldives. Ibrahim was first elected as a Member of Parliament in 1989. In addition, he has held and still holds various other posts in a number of government committees and regional trade bodies. * Presidential Candidate of the Jumhooree Party - due on 7 September 2013 * President of the Judicial Services Commission (JSC) *Member of Parliament * Minister of Home Affairs * Presidential Candidate of the Jumhooree Party - October 2008 elections * Leader of the Jumhooree Party : 2008 - * Governor of the Central Bank of Maldives - July 2005 to July 2008 * Minister of Finance - July 2005 to July 2008 *Governor of Maldives Monetary Authority : 2005 - 2007 *Board member of the Bank of Maldives *Board member of the Maldives Ports Authority (Government Appointment) *Vice-President of the Maldives Association of Tourism Industry (MATI) *President of the Maldives National Chamber of Commerce and Industry (MNCCI) *President of the SAARC Chamber of Commerce and Industry He resigned from his post as the Minister of Finance and Treasury on 10 July 2008 to stand for the first multi-party presidential elections in October 2008, as the candidate of the Jumhooree Party. He also resigned from his position as the Deputy Leader of the Dhivehi Rayyithunge Party (DRP) on the same day. Ibrahim joined the MDP-led coalition in the second round of the elections, helping Mohamed Nasheed to secure a historic victory and bring an end to the thirty-year one-man rule of Maumoon Abdul Gayoom. Ibrahim initially joined President Nasheed's government as Minister for Home Affairs but resigned 20 days later, citing indifference in governing policies, especially in relation to Mr. Nasheed's privatisation policies. He since became a vocal opposition to Mr. Nasheed's government and is accused of having funded the anti-Nasheed protests that began in early 2012, ultimately leading to Nasheed's resignation after pressure from police and the army on 7 February, 2012. Political activism and imprisonment Ibrahim has been imprisoned on politically motivated cases during Gayoom's regime as well as during Nasheed's brief reign. He was arrested in 2009 on suspicion that he was bribing MPs to vote against the government of President Nasheed. He was later released without charge. He is currently representing the Maamigilee Constituency in Maldives Parliament. =Imprisonment= Qasim Ibrahim was arrested for speaking against the government on rally held by the Maldives United Opposition. He was accused of leading a failed bid in March to impeach Speaker Abdulla Maseeh Mohamed, a close ally of president Abdulla Yameen. Controversies In July 2010, the State Minister for Finance Ahmed Assad stated in a Presidents Office Press Brief that Maldives was facing hurdles in borrowing money because a specific Majlis member was borrowing a large sum of money which in turn was lowering the country’s credit rating. It was stated that this Member has made a request to the government to give him a ‘letter of no objection’ to borrow a further large sum, he said. Though the Minister refused to name the Majlis member at the conference but it is widely assumed in the Maldivian media that the Majlis member is Qasim Ibrahim. In September 2008, the Auditor General submitted a report to the People’s Majlis which was issued on the website of the Auditor General’s office, to the effect that Villa Group had been found to be involved in illicit trading of shares. In February 2013, Qasim Ibrahim who is the Parliament’s representative to the Judicial Service Commission (JSC), accused UN Special Rapporteur on Independence of Judges and Lawyers Gabriela Knaul of lying and joking about the state of the Maldivian judiciary. Knaul’s highlighted that the JSC – mandated with the appointment, transfer and removal of judges – was unable to perform its constitutional duty adequately in its current form. Her comment was among a number of preliminary observations on the Maldives’ judiciary and wider legal ecosystem, following an eight-day fact-finding mission. When Qasim Ibrahim was Finance Minister, controversy reigned regarding the tourism investment by the European Investment Bank (EIB). The European Investment Bank (EIB) has invested €50 million to support tourism development after the tsunami. According to the ECD in Colombo, there was no co-ordination between EIB and ECD during the design stage for the loans. Only after the ECD reported on indications of misuse of money to EIB were some consultations held. Overall co-ordination between EIB and ECD is very limited.http://www.oecd.org/countries/maldives/47234192.pdf References External links * The Official Website Of Villa Group * Official Facebook Page * Official Twitter account Category:Maldivian businesspeople Category:Living people Category:Dhivehi Rayyithunge Party politicians Category:Jumhooree Party politicians Category:Finance ministers of the Maldives Category:Government ministers of the Maldives Category:Governors of Maldives Monetary Authority Category:Speakers of the People's Majlis Category:Members of the People's Majlis Category:People from Malé Category:1951 births ","title":"Qasim Ibrahim"},{"id":"9466167","text":"Christmas in July is a 1940 comedy film written and directed by Preston Sturges based on his 1931 play A Cup of Coffee. It was Sturges' second film as writer-director, after The Great McGinty, and stars Dick Powell and Ellen Drew. Plot Dr. Maxford (Raymond Walburn) is thoroughly exasperated. He is supposed to announce on national radio the winners of a slogan contest for his Maxford House Coffee; the first prize is $25,000. Maxford's jury is deadlocked by the stubborn Mr. Bildocker (William Demarest). As a result, the program ends without an announcement. One of millions of contestants, office worker Jimmy MacDonald (Dick Powell) dreams of winning, hoping to validate his faith in himself, provide some luxuries for his mother (Georgia Caine), and marry his girlfriend Betty Casey (Ellen Drew). Betty, among others, does not understand his slogan: \\"If you can't sleep at night, it's not the coffee, it's the bunk.\\" As a joke, three of his co-workers place a fake telegram on Jimmy's desk informing him that he has won. Jimmy's boss, J. B. Baxter (Ernest Truex), is so impressed, he promotes Jimmy on the spot to advertising executive, with his own office, a private secretary (Betty), and a raise. Tom Darcy, one of the pranksters, tries to clear things up before they go too far, but loses his nerve. When Jimmy arrives to collect the check, Dr. Maxford assumes his committee finally reached a decision without informing him, and writes a check to Jimmy. Jimmy and Betty go on a shopping spree at Shindel's department store. After telephoning Maxford to confirm the check is good, Mr. Shindel gives Jimmy credit to buy an engagement ring for Betty, a luxury sofa-bed for his mother, and presents for all of their neighbors. When the truth comes out, Shindel descends on Jimmy's street to try to repossess his merchandise. Maxford follows them and confirms Jimmy did not win. In the commotion, Shindel learns that Maxford's signature is genuine; instead of reclaiming the merchandise, he tries to force Maxford to pay for it. Tom and the other two pranksters admit they are to blame. That night, Jimmy and Betty confess to Baxter. Betty's heartfelt plea persuades Baxter to let Jimmy try to prove himself and keep his promotion, although on a very short probationary period and with no raise. Meanwhile, Bildocker bursts into Maxford's office to announce that the other jury members have finally given in and accepted his choice for the grand prize winner: Jimmy.

Moore, Frank Moran, Franklin Pangborn, Victor Potel, Dewey Robinson, Harry Rosenthal, Julius Tannen and Robert Warwick. *This was the fourth of ten films written by Sturges in which Demarest appeared (see note).Demarest appeared in Diamond Jim (1935), Easy Living (1937), The Great McGinty (1940), Christmas in July (1940), The Lady Eve (1941), Sullivan's Travels (1941), The Palm Beach Story (1942), The Miracle of Morgan's Creek (1944), Hail the Conquering Hero (1944) and The Great Moment (1944) *Sturges makes a cameo appearance as a man at a shoeshine stand. Production The working titles for Christmas in July were \\"The New Yorkers\\", \\"Something to Shout About\\" and \\"A Cup of Coffee\\", the latter of which was the name of the play Sturges wrote in 1931 on which the film was based. A Cup of Coffee remained unproduced until 1988, when Soho Rep in New York City mounted a production. In 1934, Universal hired Sturges to direct a film based on the play, but that project fell through when the studio found other work to assign him, including doctoring the script of Diamond Jim. Once that task was completed, Sturges' mentor at the studio, producer Henry Henigson, left, leaving nobody at Universal to champion Sturges' project.

It is a passionate defense of Prussian Lithuanian (Lietuvininkai) language and culture, rallying people to resist Germanisation attempts. However, at the same time the poem proclaimed love and loyalty to the Kaiser signifying that the rally was cultural and not political. It was inspired by Enlightenment ideas that archaic languages and traditions of minorities should be cherished, studied, and preserved. The poem was first published in the Prussian Lithuanian newspaper Lietuwißka Ceitunga in 1879. The poem was set to music in 1908 by the composer Stasys Šimkus and became the unofficial anthem of Lithuania Minor. Its shortened version using only the 1st and 4th stanzas relevant to both Lithuania Minor and Lithuania Major and replacing Lietuvininkai with Lietuviai (Lithuanians), was proposed to become the National Anthem of Lithuania after Lithuania established its nation state in 1918. Although it did not become the national anthem of the country, its popularity continued as a patriotic song which often could be heard during the Singing Revolution. The musical theme of the song was used by the Lithuanian radio (before World War II), Sąjūdis television programming, and news broadcast of Lithuanian National Radio.

The falls move in several distinct steps, beginning in a twin set of upper falls, moving down a small gorge, and culminating in a high-volume drop. It is named for the Linville River, which goes over the falls. Linville Falls has the highest volume of any waterfall on the Northern Edge of the Blue Ridge Mountains.North Carolina DPI Waterfall Website Natural history Linville Falls marks the beginning of the Linville Gorge, which is formed by the Linville River, which continues on after the falls before finally ending near Lake James. History According to personnel at Linville Falls, the falls were used by local Native Americans to execute prisoners. No one is known to have survived a fall over the final plunge, except for kayaker Pat Keller in 2010. The following is from the CARNEGIE Hero Fund Commission \\"Charles W. Davis, 23, beekeeper, saved Hallie L. Hartman, 20, from drowning, Linville Falls, North Carolina, August 30, 1928. Miss Hartman fell into the Linville River and was carried 300 feet through swift water and dropped 30 feet over a fall into a pool in which the water was 45 feet deep and very cold. The banks of the pool were high and precipitous. Davis descended high rock ledges with difficulty to a low ledge at the pool, becoming winded. Fully clothed, he swam 40 feet through rough water to Miss Hartman, who was unconscious. Grasping her, he swam 15 feet with great exertion against a strong undercurrent that pulled toward the falls and then swam 65 feet farther to a low point at the bank. As he tried to push Miss Hartman upon the bank, he fell to his knees from fatigue but got to his feet quickly and placed Miss Hartman upon the bank. After prolonged efforts, Miss Hartman was revived.\\" The falls were donated to the National Park Service in 1952 by John D. Rockefeller, Jr. He provided about $100,000 for purchase of the land, including a area surrounding the falls and a part of Linville Gorge, from Giulia Luginbuhl of Des Moines, IA, whose father, F. W. Hossfeld of Morganton, NC, had purchased the property about 1900.Asheville Citizen-Times, Ashville NC, Jan. 13, 1952, pg. 1 At one time, the upper section of the main plunge was the same height as the lower section, however, flooding caused the upper section to collapse on top of the lower falls, making the lower falls a considerably longer plunge. Visiting the falls 280px 280px The falls is owned by the National Park Service, which operates a visitor center and several miles of non-handicapped accessible trails with 4 overlooks for the falls. The Upper Falls trail leads to the top of the falls, where visitors can see the small twin upper falls and the water spiraling through a small canyon on its way to the main falls. The Erwin's View trail leads to 2 overlooks, the Chimney View overlook (0.7 miles) and the Erwin's View overlook (0.8 miles). The Plunge Basin Trail leads to the Plunge Basin Overlook, which provides a view of the falls from the other side of the river. Finally, the Gorge Trail, which branches off from the Plunge Basin trail, leads to an area near the foot of the falls.

He also spent three seasons (1907–09) in Major League Baseball as manager of the Philadelphia Phillies of the National League. Biography A native of Peabody, Massachusetts, Murray began his minor league managing career at age 25 with the Quincy, Illinois, Ravens of the Central Interstate League in 1889. After winning back-to-back pennants at Quincy and Joliet of the Illinois–Iowa League in 1891–92, Murray spent nine seasons (1894–1902) as skipper of the Providence Grays of the top-level Eastern League (a forerunner of today's International League). He then spent four winning seasons as manager of the Jersey City Skeeters of the Eastern circuit, taking one league pennant. His record as a minor league manager was 1,234 victories and 876 defeats over 18 seasons, a winning percentage of .585, one of the highest among longtime minor league managers. Murray then took the helm of the Phillies in 1907, inheriting a fourth-place team that had won only 71 games during . Murray promptly led the Phils to 83 victories and a third- place finish in 1907, but his club finished games in arrears of the league champion Chicago Cubs. His club also won 83 games, but fell to fourth, 16 games behind Chicago. When the 1909 Phillies tumbled even further, to 74 wins and a fifth-place finish, games behind the Pittsburgh Pirates, Murray was replaced as manager by Red Dooin. His career record as a major-league manager was 240–214 (.529). He died in Youngstown, Ohio, at the age of 72. References *Bucek, Jeanine, ed. dir., The Baseball Encyclopedia.

Under the Childers Reforms it amalgamated with the 47th (Lancashire) Regiment of Foot to form the Loyal North Lancashire Regiment in 1881. History Albermarle Bertie by George Romney =Raising of the Regiment= The regiment was raised by Major General Albermarle Bertie as the Loyal Lincoln Volunteers, in response to the threat posed by the French Revolution, on 23 September 1793. However, no levy money would be provided.. The original complement was composed of the Militia of Lincoln volunteering to serve in the new regiment: the regiment was embodied in January 1794. On 25 January 1794, the Loyal Lincoln Volunteers were redesignated as the 81st Regiment of Foot. The regiment was quartered in Lincoln and Gainsborough.. The first commander was Lieutenant Colonel Lewis. =Napoleonic Wars= 1795 – 1797: West Indies After a year's service in Ireland, the regiment was detailed to serve under Major-General Ralph Abercromby in the West Indies. The regiment sailed from Southampton and arrived in the West Indies in March 1794.. The regiment was sent as reinforce British operations on Saint-Domingue in what is now the Haiti.. As was common during the era, the European troops of the regiment suffered heavily from tropical diseases, in particular yellow fever. By November 1795, less than a year after, the regiment's losses to illness were so heavy that it was temporarily amalgamated with another battalion, of the 32nd Regiment, to produce a unit that would be combat effective. Despite the capture of the French defences at Bompard, the British Expedition to St. Dominque was a failure. In April 1797, the regiment was ordered to return to the England.. 1797 – 1802: Guernsey and South Africa After returning home from the West Indies, the regiment spent much of the year recruiting and refitting. The regiment was made part of the garrison for Guernsey beginning in October 1797. During this time, the rank and file took up a subscription to help support the war effort, each non- commissioned officer and enlisted man contributing between two and seven days pay to the war effort.. In 1798, the regiment was dispatched to help put down an uprising in the Cape Colony. Arriving in the new year, the regiment was quartered at Cape Town. Although sent to put down an insurrection, most of the regiment's fighting was against Rarabe tribesmen under their chief Gaika. On 5 May 1799 a party of the regiment's grenadier company was ambushed by Rarabe tribesman. All but the detachment's drummer were killed in the fighting. Emboldened by their success, Gaika's force attacked the regiment at its encampment on the Sunday River. The Rarebe were repulsed with heavy casualties by the regiment.. This was the regiment's last major action during its stay in the Cape Colony. For the next four years, the regiment continued to garrison the colony until the Treaty of Amiens in 1802. With the signing of the treaty, the men of the regiment were offered the chance to volunteer to serve in India in different regiments, for a sizable bounty, or to return to England with their regiment. More than six hundred of the regiment volunteered for Indian service, many being sent as replacements with the 22nd Regiment of Foot.. 1803 – 1807: Ireland, Sicily, and Maida The Battle of Maida July 1806 After South Africa, the regiment returned to England as the Amiens peace was ending. Once back in England, the regiment began recruiting and eventually had enough men to bring the battalion up to full strength as well as for a reserve battalion. The 2nd battalion of the regiment was formally embodied on 15 October 1803 at Mills Bay Barracks in Plymouth under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Knight.. Under the initial plan, the 1st battalion would be for universal service while the 2nd battalion would be kept for home service in the British Isles. As such, in 1804, the 2nd battalion was stationed in Ireland, initially at Kinsale, but later moved to Cork.. In 1805, the 1st battalion was assigned to Lieutenant General Sir James Craig's expeditionary group. The 1st battalion participated in the invasion of Naples,. but then retreated to Sicily once word of the Napoleon's victory at Ulm was received.. Still in Sicily in 1806, the 1st battalion was part of Major General John Stuart's force that attacked the French in Calabria. On 4 July 1806, Stuart's force engaged the French at the Battle of Maida. After stopping the initial French advance with musket fire, Stuart ordered forward Colonel Acland's brigade (including the 1st battalion). At bayonet point, the 1st battalion, together with 78th Regiment of Foot, drove off the French Forty-second regiment, as well as two battalions of Polish infantry before pausing to fire into the now exposed flanks of the French forces. Among the spoils of the battle was a silver tortoise snuff box, taken as a trophy by the 1st battalion and kept as a regimental trophy of the battle. For its actions, the regiment was granted the battle honour Maida and voted the thanks of Parliament.. Despite its victory at Maida, the 1st battalion soon withdrew to Sicily after Stuart's campaign failed to produce a general uprising against the French. The 1st battalion remained on Sicily, participating in the unsuccessful relief of Colonel Hudson Lowe's forces at Capri,. as well operations to prevent the French from taking Sicily until withdrawn in 1812.. 1808 – 1809: Spain and Walchren In September 1808, the 2nd battalion was transferred to join Lieutenant General Sir John Moore's command. Along with the rest of the 15,000 men, the 2nd battalion was destined for Corunna where it took part in Moore's campaign in northern Spain during the winter of 1808 to assist the Spanish Armies against Imperial France.. It retreated with the rest of Moore's forces to Corunna. On 16 January 1809, as part of Lieutenant-General David Baird's division guarding the right flank of the British forces, the 2nd battalion fought in some of the heaviest fighting of the battle. The 2nd battalion advanced in support of the 42nd Regiment of Foot and the 50th Regiment of Foot. Despite being driven back from their initial gains, the 2nd battalion counter-attacked with the 42nd and 50th regiments and then held their position until relieved.. With the surviving units of Moore's army, the 2nd battalion was withdrawn by sea to England the next day. For their part in the battle, the regiment was granted the battle honour \\"Corunna\\".. After refitting in England, the 2nd battalion was assigned to Lord Chatham's command for the Walcheren Campaign. During the siege of Flushing, the principal action which the 2nd battalion participated, the battalion casualties were 3 killed and 5 wounded. Over the next five months, malaria and other diseases cost the battalion 298, nearly a third of its authorized strength.. Along with the rest of Chatham's command, the 2nd battalion was withdrawn in December 1809. 1812 – 1813: Spain and The Netherlands The Battle of Castalla April 1813 After spending almost six years defending Sicily, the 1st battalion was withdrawn and assigned to Lieutenant-General Frederick Maitland's expedition to Catalonia.. Maitaland's expedition was a feint to help with the main Allied thrust in 1812. After an aborted initial landing, the 1st battalion landed in Spain in August 1812. Throughout the rest of the year, the campaigned continued on inconclusively in the region of Alicante.. Eventually, after Maitland relinquished command due to illness, General Sir John Murray assumed command of the expedition in 1813.. With him came an addition 12,000 men, the Anglo-Sicilian force contained approximately 16,000 men. They were opposed by Marshal Louis-Gabriel Suchet.. Advancing, Murray's command, and the 1st battalion, encountered and defeated Suchet's forces at the Battle of Castalla on 13 April 1813.. A month later, after besieging the city of Tarragona,. the 1st battalion retreated offshore with the rest of Anglo-Spanish-Sicilian force when General Murray was fooled into believing that advancing French columns were significantly larger than they actually were.. After Murray's relief and replacement by Lieutenant General Lord William Bentinck, the 1st battalion returned with the rest of the force to the region around Alicante.. With the Duke of Wellington's victory at Vittoria, Succhet began a withdrawal from Valencia and Catalan. Bentick's force began its slow, ineffective pursuit.. 1814: Holland and North America After spending the previous four years in England and Jersey supplying the 1st battalion with drafts of men and officers, the 2nd battalion were dispatched as reinforcements to General Sir Thomas Graham's expedition to the Low Countries.. Arriving in February 1814, they were assigned to the 2nd Division's 2nd Brigade. The 2nd battalion did not participate in the ill-fated assault on Bergen op Zoom on 8 March 1814. With Napoleon's abdication after signing the Treaty of Fontainebleau, the 2nd battalion remained in the Netherlands, stationed at Brussels, rather than being despatched to North America to fight against the United States.. Meanwhile, the 1st battalion, along with the rest of its brigade was transferred, upon Napoleon's abdication, from Spain to North America. Arriving in August 1814, the 1st battalion landed in Quebec and was ordered to move south. However, the 1st battalion missed the major engagements of the 1814 campaign. With the news of peace in March 1815, the 1st battalion remained in garrison until later in 1815 when word of Napoleon's escape from Elba spread.. 1815: The Hundred Days The 1st battalion embarked for Europe on 15 June 1815:. it missed the final campaign against Napoleon but served in the occupation army in France until April 1817 at which time it was posted to Ireland. The 2nd battalion had been held in reserve in Brussels since Napoleon's abdication. However, upon learning that Napoleon had left Elba, the battalion was put back on war footing. The 2nd battalion was assigned to the 10th Brigade under Major-General John Lambert, part of Lieutenant General Lowry Cole's 6th Division. With the rest of the division, the 2nd battalion missed the Battle of Quatre Bras on 16 June 1815. The 2nd battalion was still in the process of concentrating at the time of the battle. Even after the rest of the brigade was ready and on the road, the 2nd battalion was still left behind to guard the hospitals and treasury in Brussels.. Just as its sister battalion missed the campaign, the 2nd battalion were held out of the fighting during the Hundred Days. The next year, the 2nd battalion were disbanded.. =The Victorian era= 1817 – 1853: Garrison Duty in Canada, Gibraltar, The West Indies, England and Ireland The regiment garrisoned the Ireland until being transferred to Canada in 1822. After seven years in Canada, the regiment were sent to the West Indies, spending two years in Bermuda before being returned to England in 1831.. After rotating through stations in England and Ireland, the regiment was on the move again, being stationed at Gibraltar in 1836, reinforcing the garrison there when tensions started to escalate during the First Carlist War. After nine years on the Rock, the regiment was once again sent back to the West Indies. Three years in the West Indies' outposts of Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago, and St. Kitts were followed by years in Canada. The regiment would be returned home to England in 1847.. After serving in various stations in England and Ireland, the regiment was sent on foreign service again, this time to India in 1853.. 1853 – 1863: India, Sepoy Mutiny, and the North-West Frontier The Martyr's memorial at Meerut commemorating the Indian rebels who died in the fighting in 1857 The regiment arrived in India in 1854. Initially sent to Meerut, the regiment were eventually sent to Lahore in 1857 on the eve of the Indian Rebellion. There they were stationed at the Meean Meer cantonment with three infantry battalions, one cavalry regiment, and some artillery units of the East India Company. On the eve of the mutiny, many of the officers were on leave, despite evidence that something was happening.. When word reached the Punjab of the mutiny, the regiment disarmed the Company battalions at Meean Meer during a surprise parade inspection.. The initial operation took the mutineers by surprise, and they were disarmed without no casualties. As the sepoy units at Meean Meer were being disarmed, three companies of the regiment tricked their way into the fort guarding Lahore, surprising and disarming the native infantry units there as well.. With the recapture of Dehli in September 1857, British control of the Punjab became easier as the rebellion in lost its momentum. By February 1858, the situation had improved to the point where the regiment could be transferred to the North-West Frontier.. The regiment was assigned to Major-General Sir Sydney Cotton's Sittana Field Force. The objective of Cotton's command was to carry out a punitive expedition against Hindustani fanatics who had been instrumental in the mutiny of a native regiment stationed near Peshawar... Crossing through the Daran pass, the regiment participated in the destruction of the stronghold at Mangal Thana.. After destroying the fortifications at Mangal Thana, the expedition turned its attention to the main fanatic base at Sittana. Despite resistance from the Fanactics, the upper and lower Sittana villages were captured by the British forces, including the regiment. After burning them to the ground, Cotton's expedition returned to British India. The success of the expedition resulted in a treaty between the various tribes and the British leading to the expulsion of the Hindustani Fanatics as well as an agreement by the various tribes to resist attempts by the Fanatics to return.. 1864 – 1874 England and Gibraltar The regiment would not see any further active service in India during its tour of duty there. In 1864, after nearly ten years in India, the regiment returned to England after surviving sailing through a hurricane.. The regiment would recruit and rotate through the various posts in England and Ireland from 1865 until 1870 when the regiment was once again posted to Gibraltar.. 1878 – 1881 Second Afghan War and Amalgamation The interior of Ali Masjid, following the battle in November 1878 Returning to in India in 1878, the regiment was tasked with taking part in the Second Anglo- Afghan War. Assigned to The Peshawar Valley Field Force, under the command of Lieutenant General Sir Sam Browne, the regiment took part in the Battle of Ali Masjid in November 1878. As part of Brigadier-General Frederick Appleyard's brigade, the regiment participated in the front assault into the Khyber Pass. As part of the Cardwell Reforms of the 1870s, where single-battalion regiments were linked together to share a single depot and recruiting district in the United Kingdom, the 81st was linked with the 47th (Lancashire) Regiment of Foot, and assigned to district no. 12 at Fulwood Barracks in Lancashire. On 1 July 1881 the Childers Reforms came into effect and the regiment amalgamated with the 47th (Lancashire) Regiment of Foot to form the Loyal North Lancashire Regiment.

His act led to the incarceration of family boss Raymond Patriarca, Jr. and other top family members. History Born in the West End section of Boston, Mercurio grew up working in the family bakery in Malden, Massachusetts. He had a fleeting resemblance to actor John Garfield. In 1954, at eighteen years old, Mercurio was an accomplice in a holdup in Revere, Massachusetts. He was sentenced to life in prison. In 1964 he was pardoned by Governor John A. Volpe. After serving time in prison again, from 1978–86, for trying to sell $23 million worth of stolen securities in an FBI entrapment. Mercurio established a successful Italian food shop in the Prudential Tower in Boston. When he came out of prison, Mercurio was disgruntled with the Patriarca family because they had not helped his family with money while he was incarcerated. Meanwhile, the Irish-American Winter Hill gangsters and FBI informants Whitey Bulger and Steve Flemmi gave his girl money every week. They got along since he was the go between for Jerry Angiulo, the boss of Boston's mob that had suzerainty over Winter Hill. Mercurio was soon working for the Patriarca family, serving as a liaison between them and the Irish Winter Hill Gang in Boston. Bulger and Flemmi thought they might be able to flip him for their handler, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agent John Connolly. During the 1980s, the FBI obtained incriminating evidence on Mercurio by electronic surveillance at his food shop. After Anguilo was sent to prison, the new leadership of Boston's mob thought they had a perfect meeting place at Mercurio's shop. An underground parking garage and a freight elevator to the room where they conducted business. They figured that they could not be followed, and therefore could not be bugged. The only problem was that Steve Flemmi was invited up to discuss business. He drew FBI agent John Connolly a map of how to get there, so he could bug the place. The FBI gathered enough evidence to indict Mercurio and others for extorting a couple of elderly bookmakers for a quarter of a million dollars. Because he was being pressured and threatened by opposite forces, Mercurio became an FBI informant, in 1987.http://www.answers.com/topic/1989-in-organized-crime FBI informant Mercurio lured mobster Francis \\"Cadillac Frank\\" Salemme to a meeting in June 1989, outside a Saugus, Massachusetts International House of Pancakes restaurant, where gunmen ambushed the unarmed Salemme as restaurant patrons dining inside ducked for cover. Wounded in the chest, Salemme took cover in the restaurant's vestibule, but ran back outside to prevent bystanders from being hurt, suffering a wound to his leg. In 1989, Mercurio informed the FBI about an upcoming family induction ceremony at a home in Medford, Massachusetts. Mercurio surreptitiously recorded the ceremony, the first time in U.S. history that a mob induction was taped. Attendees at the ceremony included Raymond Patriarca, Jr., underboss Nicholas Bianco; consigliere Joe Russo; and caporegimes Biaggio Digiacoma, Vincent Ferrara, Matthew Guglielmetti, Dennis Lepore, and Robert Carrozza. While the ceremony was taking place, Mercurio even turned down the television volume in the home to improve the recording. Mercurio's recordings led to the prosecution and conviction of dozens of criminals. In 1991, Patriarca pleaded guilty to racketeering and conspiracy charges and was sent to prison for seven years. After Patriarca's indictment, Mercurio disappeared from New England to avoid indictment himself. Mercurio said he innocently met FBI special agent, John Connolly, in the Prudential Center in the fall of 1987, after Vanessa's had been searched. He was still disgruntled from the humiliation of being successfully bugged, accused the FBI of trying to plant evidence during their secret forays into the store and bragged that the Mafia had outsmarted them. He was trying to best John Connolly in a battle of insider information. Connolly calmly rattled off the name of the Patriarca crime family's inside source for law enforcement information. Mercurio had unknowingly confirmed that the Patriarca crime family had a law enforcement source, and he knew what it meant if the FBI exposed his Top Echelon Informant status. Angelo's conversation restored Stephen Flemmi's Top Echelon Informant status in November 1987. In less than a year, Mercurio had joined Flemmi as a Top Echelon Informant, and was constantly feeding the FBI inside information on his associates in the Patriarca crime family. In some ways he even supplanted Bulger and Flemmi in importance- the FBI and the Organized Crime Strike Force were targeting the Patriarca crime family, Robert Carrozza, J.R. Russo and Vincent Ferrara, and as a member of their inner circle, Mercurio was privy to information that even Flemmi could not obtain. He threw himself into his informant role enthusiastically- even though he had been the best man at Vincent Ferrara's first wedding, this did not stop him from thoroughly informing on the illicit activities of his old friend. Mercurio's value as an informant made protecting him a priority. Prison time In 1994, Mercurio was convicted in Georgia of possessing 150 pounds of marijuana and was sent to prison there. He was also arrested because he tried to shoplift a $500 Shimano fishing reel in a Sandy Springs sporting goods store. He put the fishing reel in his pocket and just walked out of the store, giving the manager at the front a \\"stop me, I dare you, look\\". The manager, a marathon runner, gave chase, and Mercurio made it about two blocks before collapsing on the sidewalk. Mercurio was booked on shoplifting but released since the alias he was using that day was not in the FBI national crime database. A short time later, though, he was pulled over on suspicion of drunk driving, and this time his fraudulent driver's license was a match. When word got back to the Boston FBI that Mercurio had been arrested, FBI Special Agent Michael Buckley visited him in jail. Soon afterward, he pleaded guilty in the Vincent Ferrara case. The government asked for nine years. Despite his obvious role in the attempted murder of Frank Salemme, it was significantly less time than J. R. Russo, Vincent Ferrara and Robert Carrozza received. Not only that, but federal prosecutors recommended that it be served concurrently with Mercurio's ten- year sentence in Georgia. In June 1997, Mercurio was brought back to Boston from prison in Georgia to testify in the trial of Patriarca boss Frank Salemme. His revelation in court as a government informant was a tremendous surprise to the Patriarca family. After this testimony, Mercurio was sent back to prison. In 2000, Mercurio's sentence was reduced. On his release from prison, Mercurio entered the Federal Witness Protection Program and was secretly relocated to Arkansas. According to Mercurio's lawyer, Mercurio in later years was conflicted about becoming an informant and betraying the Patriarca family but believe he himself was the victim of their betrayal. Death On December 11, 2006, Mercurio died of a pulmonary embolism in Little Rock, Arkansas.

It has a repertoire based on funk but also including samba, jazz and Brazilian rhythms. History Compared to other soul-funk groups, such as Kool & the Gang and Earth, Wind and Fire, Banda Black Rio developed a particular style of instrumental soul music fusing together elements from a number of genres. WEA had just been established in Brazil, and they wanted to create a band that could be the pioneer of this movement; so they contacted Oberdan Magalhães, a renowned saxophonist, who accepted the challenge together with trumpet player Barrosinho, keyboards and arrangements Cristovao Bastos, guitars and arrangements Claudio Stevenson, bass Jamil Joanes, trombone Lucio Silva and formed Banda Black Rio. Mixing R&B;, jazz and samba elements, Banda Black Rio was one of the first to undertake the fusion of Essential Brazilian Music with International Black Music. They were brought together in 1976. Banda Black Rio was often associated with soul-funk bands such as Kool & the Gang, Earth, Wind and Fire, Herbie Hancock, and others. The band recorded six albums: the instrumental Maria Fumaça (1977), Gafieira Universal (1978) and Saci Pererê (1980). They were also invited to take part in other artists' albums, such as Luiz Melodia, Raul Seixas, Sandra de Sa, Emilio Santiago, Alcione, Carlos Dafe, and recorded a live album with Caetano Veloso entitled Bicho Baile Show and Global Brazilians in 1985. The album was released in 1995. The present band are the sons of the original members. Two albums came out from this new generation of Black Rio.

History Beverly Crest was developed as an exclusive 250-lot subdivision between Coldwater Canyon and Trousdale. Developer George Read marketed it as a community of \\"motion picture celebrities and other notables.\\" Geography Beverly Crest is east of Coldwater Canyon Drive and borders the city of Beverly Hills on the east and south. It is in Coldwater Canyon in the Beverly Hills Post Office area, though it is part of the city of Los Angeles. It consists of properties located on Lindacrest Drive, Readcrest Drive, Beverlycrest Drive, Lloydcrest Drive, Waynecrest Drive, Gilcrest Drive, Claircrest Drive, Ridgecrest Drive, Cerrocrest Drive, Meadow Drive and 1300-1631 Schuyler Road. It is included in the Crests Neighborhood Association and lies in the Bel Air–Beverly Crest Community Plan area of Los Angeles, which encompasses multiple neighborhoods (including Bel Air, Benedict Canyon, Beverly Glen, Laurel Canyon, and the northern portion of Holmby Hills).SurveyLA: Historic Resources Survey Report: Bel Air – Beverly Crest Community Plan AreaRegular Meeting of the Board, Wednesday, January 27, 2016 7:00–9:00 P.M., Bel Air–Beverly Crest Neighborhood Council The Beverly Crest Neighborhood Area, officially named in 2008, lies in Los Angeles census tract 2611.01, block group 2 (as of 2008).Communication from Application to Rename Community Beverly Crest, by Ron Galperin, 2008-01-24Council File: 08-0312, BEVERLY CREST / COMMUNITY NAMING AND RENAMING APPLICATION The name \\"Beverly Crest\\" is sometimes used more broadly to refer to a larger section in the Bel Air–Beverly Crest Community Plan area, in the hills above the city of Beverly Hills.NAMING / RENAMING OF A COMMUNITY, REQUEST FOR DEPARTMENTAL EVALUATION, Report from City Planning to City Clerk, 2008-05-08. \\"Historical research indicates that the proposed name, 'Beverly Crest,' would accurately reflect the historical and cultural significance of the area. ... The Community Plan text does not include specific information on the history or boundaries of the area; however, historical research suggests that George E. Read originally named the area Beverly Crest when he began to subdivide the area in 1923. ... Further, the name 'Beverly Crest' is also geographically accurate because this area is located in the hills above the City of Beverly Hills, and is within the larger section of the Bel Air-Beverly Crest Community that is commonly referred to as 'Beverly Crest.'\\" As mapped by Mapping L.A., the area of Beverly Crest is roughly triangular, with Sherman Oaks to the north, Bel Air to the southwest and the city of Beverly Hills to the southeast. The borders are mapped by the Los Angeles Times to run along Mulholland Drive on the north; Stone Canyon Road to the west, then Beverly Glen Boulevard below Stone Canyon Reservoir to Sunset Boulevard on the far south. The southeastern boundary with Beverly Hills is complex, and most of Beverly Crest lies within the so-called Beverly Hills Post Office, defined as ZIP code 90210 outside the city of Beverly Hills proper. The neighborhood of Hollywood Hills West is nearby on the east. Demographics The following data applies to Beverly Crest within the boundaries established by Mapping L.A.: The 2000 U.S. census counted 10,852 residents in the 8.24-square-mile Beverly Crest neighborhood—or 1,318 people per square mile, among the lowest population densities for the city and the county. In 2008, the city estimated that the population had increased to 11,569. In 2000 the median age for residents was 45, which was high for city and county neighborhoods. The percentages of residents aged 35 and older were among the county's highest. According to demographic surveys, in 2000 the median age of residents was 45 years old, which made Beverly Crest have one of the highest median ages for any of the neighborhoods in Los Angeles, behind only Century City and Bel-Air. The Los Angeles Times considered the neighborhood \\"not especially diverse\\" ethnically within Los Angeles, given its relatively high percentage of Caucasian residents. The breakdown was whites, 87.5%; Asians, 4.0%; Latinos, 3.4%; blacks 1.7%; other races 3.3%. Iran (28.6%) and the United Kingdom (8.6%) were the most common places of birth for the 25% of the residents who were born abroad—which was an average percentage for Los Angeles as a whole. The median yearly household income in 2008 dollars was $169,282, considered high for the city and the county. Renters occupied 10% of the housing stock, and house- or apartment-owners held 90%. The average household size of 2.4 people was considered typical for Los Angeles. The 5.6% of families headed by single parents was low for city and county neighborhoods. The percentages of married people in Bel Air were among the county's highest—63.4% for men and 59.5% for women. There were 896 veterans, or 10.2% of the population, a high proportion compared to the rest of the city and county. Education More than two-thirds (67.6%) of Beverly Crest residents aged 25 and older had earned a four-year degree by 2000, a high percentage for the city and the county. The percentages of residents in that age range with a bachelor's degree or greater were high for the county. The Los Angeles Unified School District operates public schools serving Beverly Crest. One school is within the boundaries of Beverly Crest—Harvard-Westlake, a private middle school at 700 North Faring Road.

Her mother was a teacher at the Camberwell School of Art and her father was recorded as an agent. Biography Hope first went to a school in Romiley, but then attended the Manchester High School for Girls, with her twin sister Muriel. In 1918 she started training at the Slade School of Art in London on a scholarship of £20 and in 1926 won the Prix de Rome for her etching The Adoration of the Shepherds, which was subsequently shown at the Royal Academy. She studied under Henry Tonks (1862-1937), Philip Wilson Steer (1860-1942) and John Wheatley (1892-1955). At this time she was living at 40 Downshire Hill, Hampstead, N.W, the same house where Mark Rutherford, the novelist, lived in 1852. When she visited South Africa in 1935, her former teacher at the Slade School, Professor John Laviers Wheatley, offered her a teaching post at the Michaelis School of Fine Art at the University of Cape Town. She founded the school's printmaking and engraving department. In 1938 she accepted the post of Senior Lecturer in Fine Art at the University of Natal in Pietermaritzburg, where she remained until 1957. From here she made frequent painting trips to the Drakensberg and Transkei, occasionally accompanied by her friend and fellow painter, Phyllis McCarthy. The Centre for Visual Art at the University of Natal has been entrusted with a donation of her works. Rosa Hope designed the tile tableau of the Great Trek Centenary in the Irene Post Office in 1939. In January 1923 she was elected an Associate of the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers and Engravers. She exhibited drawings at the New English Art Club, the Redfern Gallery, Old Bond Street and Messrs. P. and D. Colnaghi at the Grosvenor Galleries. She was a member of the Society of Graphic Art, the Hampstead Society of Artists and the Print Collectors’ Club. She exhibited with the South African Society of Artists (SASA) until 1942.

The male skeleton is on the left, and the female skeleton is on the right. The Lovers of Valdaro, also known as the \\"Valdaro Lovers,\\" are a pair of human skeletons dated as approximately 6,000 years old. They were discovered by archaeologists at a Neolithic tomb in San Giorgio near Mantua, Italy, in 2007. The two humans appear to have died facing each other with arms around each other, thus reminiscent of a \\"lovers' embrace\\". Archaeologist Elena Maria Menotti led the excavation. The pair are a male and female no older than 20 years old at death and approximately in height. The male skeleton was found with a flint arrowhead near the neck. The female had a long flint blade along the thigh, plus two flint knives under the pelvis. Osteological examination found no evidence of violent death, no fractures, and no microtrauma, so the most likely explanation is the flint tools were buried along with the people as grave goods. The skeletons were displayed briefly in public for the first time in September 2011 at the entrance of National Archaeological Museum of Mantua, thanks to the effort of the association Lovers in Mantua which was seeking a permanent home for the ancient couple. Seven years after their discovery, on 11 April 2014, they were permanently displayed inside a glass case in the National Archaeological Museum of Mantua, a museum within the perimeter of the Ducal palace of Mantua.

After his retirement as a Minor League Baseball (MiLB) player, Leyva moved into coaching. His Major League Baseball (MLB) coaching stops included the St. Louis Cardinals, Toronto Blue Jays (on two separate occasions), Milwaukee Brewers, and Pittsburgh Pirates. Leyva was the manager of the Philadelphia Phillies from though early . Playing career Born in Ontario, California, Leyva, who is of Mexican-American descent, attended the University of LaVerne, and was selected by the St. Louis Cardinals in the 24th round of the 1975 Major League Baseball Draft. He was an infielder who threw and batted right-handed, stood tall and weighed . In three seasons (1975–77) in the Cardinals' farm system, he appeared in 253 games played and batted .267 with 208 hits, eight home runs and 109 runs batted in. Managing career Leyva began his managing career at age 24 with the rookie- level Johnson City Cardinals of the Appalachian League in 1978. By 1983, he was manager of the parent Cardinals' Double-A farm team, the Arkansas Travelers of the Texas League. Leyva then served on the big-league coaching staff of Whitey Herzog's Cardinals for five seasons, 1984–1988. He was the first base coach for the National League-champion Cardinals in 1985, and the third base coach for the NL-champion Cardinals in 1987. In 1989, Leyva was hired as manager of the Phillies by his former farm director in St. Louis, Lee Thomas. The Phillies won only 67 of 162 games during Leyva's inaugural season at the helm, and finished last in the National League East Division. In 1990, his team won ten more games and finished fourth, but still played eight games below the .500 mark. When the 1991 Phillies dropped nine of their first 13 games, Leyva was ousted on April 23. His career totals as a Major League manager were 148 victories and 189 defeats (.439). Coach with Blue Jays, Brewers and Pirates Corey Hart in 2007 After managing the Toronto Blue Jays' Triple-A farm team, the Syracuse Chiefs, Leyva spent 4½ seasons (July 1993 through 1997) as the third-base coach of the Blue Jays, his first term in the job. As a major league manager and coach, Leyva has worn #16 with every team he has been with, except for his first year in Toronto in 1993, during which he wore #45 as #16 was already taken. He later worked at multiple levels of the Chicago White Sox farm system before spending one season as third-base coach of the Milwaukee Brewers in 2007. Leyva was listed as the 2008 manager of the Kingsport Mets of the Appalachian League, a rookie-level affiliate of the New York Mets, before the Blue Jays rehired him as their third base coach on June 20, 2008, when Cito Gaston replaced John Gibbons as the club's manager.Baseball America, 2008 Directory On October 30, 2009, Leyva was reassigned as the Blue Jays' bench coach, with Brian Butterfield taking over as third base coach for the team. On November 8, 2010, former Seattle Mariners manager Don Wakamatsu was named Toronto's bench coach, ending Leyva's tenure at that post. On November 24, 2011, Leyva was named the Pittsburgh Pirates' third base coach, under new manager Clint Hurdle. On November 5, 2014, the Pirates announced that Leyva would be moved to first base coach and Rick Sofield would move from first base to third base. On October 22, 2016, the Pirates announced that Leyva was reassigned within the organization to an advisory position and would no longer coach. Coach in Venezuela Leyva managed the Cardenales de Lara of the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League in 1995-1996 season, and who lost the final of that season against the Navegantes del Magallanes 4 games for 3. For the 2000-2001 season, he again managed the Cardenales, leading them to his fourth championship in Venezuela, defeating the team that defeated him four years before in six games. Seven years later, he returned to Venezuela to manage the Navegantes del Magallanes in the 2008-2009 season, but was dismissed because of the team's poor record. Leyva's younger brother, Al, is an assistant coach with the Willmar Stingers of the Northwoods League.

It is a biodiversity hotspot with its various ecosystems ranging from the Himalayas in the north to the evergreen rain-forests in the south, the desert sands of the west to the marshy mangroves of the east. India, lying within the Indomalayan realm, is home to about 7.6% of mammal, 14.7% of amphibian, 6% of bird, 6.2% of reptilian, and 6.0% of flowering plant species.Indira Gandhi Conservation Monitoring Centre (IGCMC), New Delhi and the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP), World Conservation Monitoring Centre, Cambridge, UK. 2001. Biodiversity profile for India India's forest lands nurture about 500 species of mammals and 2000+ bird species. This richness of Indian wildlife has been celebrated since time immemorial. Four of India’s national symbols consist India’s mammals. India is one of the most biodiverse regions of the world and contains three of the world’s 36 biodiversity hotspots – the Western Ghats, the Eastern Himalayas, and the Indo-Burma hotspot. It is one of the seventeen megadiverse countries. The country has seven Natural World Heritage sites, eleven Biosphere Reserves in the World Network of Biosphere Reserves and thirty seven Ramsar Wetlands. In response to decrease in the numbers of wild animals, human encroachment and poaching activities, the government of India established a system of national parks and protected areas in 1935, which was subsequently expanded. In 1972, India enacted the Wildlife Protection Act and Project Tiger to safeguard crucial habitat. Further, federal protections were promulgated in the 1980s. India has about 2,714 endemic Lichen species. In 2020, the Lichen Park in India was developed by the Uttarakhand Forest Department in Munsiyari.  Geographic origins  Many Indian species are descendants of species originating in Gondwana, of which India originally was a part. Peninsular India's subsequent movement towards, and collision with, the Laurasian landmass set off a mass exchange of species. However, volcanism and climatic change 20 million years ago caused the extinction of many endemic Indian forms.K. Praveen Karach. (2006). Out-of-India Gondwanan origin of some tropical Asian biota Soon thereafter, mammals entered India from Asia through two zoogeographical passes on either side of the emerging Himalaya. As a result, among Indian species, only 12.6% of mammals and 4.5% of birds are endemic, contrasting with 45.8% of reptiles and 55.8% of amphibians Notable endemics are the Nilgiri langur and the brown and carmine Beddome's toad of the Western Ghats. India harbours 172, or 2.9%, of IUCN-designated threatened species.Groombridge, B. (ed). 1993. The 1994 IUCN Red List of Threatened Animals. IUCN, England, Switzerland and Cambridge, UK. lvi + 286 pp. India is located at the junction of three realms namely Afrotropical, Indomalayan and Paleoarctic, and therefore, has characteristic elements from each of them, spurring migration of avifauna from these regions.  Fauna  Snow Leopard in Hemis National Park India is home to several well-known large animals, including the Indian elephant, Indian rhinoceros, Bengal tiger, Asiatic lion, Indian leopard, snow leopard, and clouded leopard.Bears include sloth bear, the Himalayan black bear, the Himalayan brown bear,and deers and antelopes include the chausinga antelope, the blackbuck, chinkara, chital, sambar (deer), Tibetan antelope, goa (antelope, Kashmir stag, and the barasinga. It is home to big cats like Bengal tiger and Indochinese tiger, Asiatic lion, Indian leopard, Indochinese leopard, snow leopard, and clouded leopard. Various species of caprines, including Bhutan and Mishmi takin, Himalayan and red goral, Himalayan serow, red serow, Himalayan tahr, and Nilgiri tahr, as well as the kiang and Indian wild ass can be found. Reptiles like king cobra, Indian cobra, Indian python, reticulated python, and gecko are common. Birds include Indian peacock, great Indian hornbill, painted stork, greater and lesser flamingo, and Eurasian spoonbill.  Flora  There are about 18500 taxa of flowering plants from India. The Indian Forest Act, 1927 helped to improve the protection and security of the natural habitat. Many ecoregions, such as the shola forests, also exhibit extremely high rates of endemism; overall, 33% of Indian plant species are endemic.Botanical Survey of India. 1983 Flora and Vegetation of forest cover ranges from the tropical rainforest of the Andaman Islands, Western Ghats, and Northeast India to the coniferous forest of the Himalaya. Between these extremes lie the sal-dominated moist deciduous forest of eastern India; teak-dominated dry deciduous forest of central and southern India, and the babul-dominated thorn forest of the central Deccan and western Gangetic plain.Tritsch, M.E. 2001. Wildlife of India Harper Collins, London. 192 pages. Important Indian trees include the medicinal neem, widely used in rural Indian herbal remedies. Bamboo gardens are extremely common in jungles as well as villages. States like Sikkim and West Bengal have orchids. The national flower of India, the lotus flower, is common in lakes and ponds. Fungi The diversity of fungi and their natural beauty occupy a prime place in the biological world and India has been a cradle for such organisms. Only a fraction of the total fungal wealth of India has been subjected to scientific scrutiny and mycologists have to unravel this unexplored and hidden wealth. One-third of the fungal diversity of the globe exists in India. The country has an array of 10 diverse biomes including Trans-Himalayan zone, Himalaya, Desert, Semi-Arid zone, Western Ghats, Deccan Peninsula, Gangetic Plain, North-Eastern India, Coasts and Islands where varied dominating regimes manifest. This enables the survival of manifold fungal flora in these regions which include hot spot areas like the Himalayan ranges, Western Ghats, hill stations, mangroves, sea coasts, freshwater bodies etc. Many fungi have been recorded from these regions and from the country, in general, comprising thermophiles, psychrophiles, mesophiles, aquatic forms, marine forms, plant and animal pathogens, edible fungi and beneficial fungi and so on. The number of fungi recorded in India exceeds 27,000 species, the largest biotic community after insects. The true fungi belong to the KingdomClassification of Organisms Wikipedia Kingdom (biology) Fungi which has four phyla, 103 orders, 484 families and 4979 genera.

Conservation Article 48 of the Constitution of India says, \\"The state shall endeavour to protect and improve the environment and to safeguard the forests and wildlife of the country\\" and Article 51-A states that \\"it shall be the duty of every citizen of India to protect and improve the natural environment including forests, lakes, rivers, and wildlife and to have compassion for living creatures.\\"Krausman, PR & AT Johnson (1990) Conservation and wildlife education in India. Wild. Soc. Bull. 18:342-347 The committee in the Indian Board for Wildlife, in their report, defines wildlife as \\"the entire natural uncultivated flora and fauna of the country\\" while the Wildlife (protection) Act 1972 defines it as \\"any animal, bees, butterflies, crustacea, fish, moths and aquatic or land vegetation which forms part of any habitat.\\" Despite the various environmental issues faced, the country still has rich and varied wildlife. Large and charismatic mammals are important for wildlife tourism in India, and several national parks and wildlife sanctuaries cater to these needs. Project Tiger, started in 1973, is a major effort to conserve the tiger and its habitats.Project Tiger Accessed February 2007 At the turn of the 20th century, one estimate of the tiger population in India placed the figure at 40,000, yet an Indian tiger census conducted in 2008 revealed the existence of only 1,411 tigers. 2010 tiger census revealed that there are 1700 tigers left in India.NDTV As per the latest tiger census (2019), there are around 2967 tigers in India. Various pressures in the later part of the 20th century led to the progressive decline of wilderness resulting in the disturbance of viable tiger habitats. At the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) General Assembly meeting in Delhi in 1969, serious concern was voiced about the threat to several species of wildlife and the shrinkage of wilderness in India. In 1970, a national ban on tiger hunting was imposed, and in 1972 the Wildlife Protection Act came into force. The framework was then set up to formulate a project for tiger conservation with an ecological approach. However, there is not much optimism about this framework's ability to save the peacock, which is the national bird of India. George Schaller wrote about conservation of tigers in IndiaShashwat, D.C.

As of 2018-19, there are 870 protected areas including 104 National Parks, 551 Wildlife Sanctuaries, 88 Conservation Reserves and 127 Community Reserves covering a total of 1,65,088.57 km² of geographical area which is approximately 5.02% of the country. In addition there are 50 Tiger Reserves, 18 Biosphere Reserves and 32 Elephant Reserves. Hundreds of India's bird populations are in serious decline, according to a study spanning over 25 years.https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/india-birds-decline-species- biodiversity-climate-crisis-a9342371.html In 2020 the Indian government created the world's first sea cucumber reserve in Lakshadweep-Dr KK Mohammed Koya Sea Cucumber Conservation Reserve, the largest marine conservation reserve - Attakoya Thangal Marine Conservation Reserve and the first protected area for marine birds in India - PM Sayeed Marine Birds Conservation Reserve.  Extinctions in recent times  Illustration of a Himalayan quail from A. O. Hume's work. Last seen in 1876. The exploitation of land and forest resources by humans along with capturing and trapping for food and sport has led to the extinction of many species in India in recent times. These species include mammals such as the Asiatic cheetah, wild zebu, Indian Javan rhinoceros, and Northern Sumatran rhinoceros. While some of these large mammal species are confirmed extinct, there have been many smaller animal and plant species whose status is harder to determine. Many species have not been seen since their description. Gir forest in India has the only surviving population of Asiatic lions in the world. In the late 1960s, there were only about 180 Asiatic lions. There were 523 Asiatic lions in the Gir sanctuary in Gujarat state which in 2018 increased to more than 600. Some bird species have gone extinct in recent times, including the pink-headed duck (Rhodonessa caryophyllacea) and the Himalayan quail (Ophrysia superciliosa). A species of warbler, Acrocephalus orinus, known earlier from a single specimen collected by Allan Octavian Hume from near Rampur in Himachal Pradesh, was rediscovered after 139 years in Thailand.Threatened birds of Asia Accessed October 2006The Nation, 6 March 2007  Cultural Influence  The varied and rich wildlife of India has had a profound impact on the region's popular culture. India's wildlife has been the subject of numerous tales and fables such as the Panchatantra or the Jataka Tales.

The northern section, between Nuremberg and Ingolstadt, is a track built between 1998 and 2006. It is in length with nine tunnels (total length: ). In order to minimize damage to the environment, it runs for the most part right next to Bundesautobahn 9. The southern section, between Ingolstadt and Munich, is 19th-century track. Its southern section has been upgraded for up to . Between 2010 and 2013, further upgrades to the midsection of the track will be done. The minimum speed on the Munich- Ingolstadt section should then be , with in the middle and 200 km/h in the southern section. Both long-distance and regional services operate on the line. Intercity-Express trains reach the tracks' 300 km/h speed-limit. InterCity and RegionalExpress trains travel at a maximum speed of 200 km/h. The Allersberg-Express, a RegionalBahn shuttle service, is operated between Allersberg and Nuremberg. The line was officially inaugurated on May 13, 2006. Limited operation with a twice-hourly long-distance service started on 28 May 2006. The line has been in full operation since December 2006. Compared to the former track via Augsburg, it cut off , or about 30 minutes journey time on long-distance and an hour on regional trains. Most of the track is equipped with Linienzugbeeinflussung and GSM-R. ETCS was planned to be introduced in 2009, although this seems to be delayed until at least 2017. The total costs (as of January 2006) were about €3.6 billion. The line is part of the Line 1 of Trans-European Transport Networks (TEN-T). History The Irlahüll Tunnel () is one of the longest and steepest (20 permille) rail tunnels in Germany. The Munich–Ingolstadt line was opened in 1867 and was extended to Treuchtlingen as the Ingolstadt–Treuchtlingen line in 1870. The first proposal for a high-speed line dates back to 1983, when the Nuremberg section of Deutsche Bundesbahn proposed a more direct line between Nuremberg and Munich. The project was added to the 1985 federal traffic infrastructure plan. The following years were marked by heated debate on the route of the line, in particular if it should run via Ingolstadt or Augsburg. While the Ingolstadt line is much more direct () than the existing Augsburg route (), the metropolitan area of Augsburg is considered much larger than Ingolstadt's. Apart from concerns that fewer long-distance trains would run via (and stop at) Augsburg, there were also concerns about the environmental effects of the of track that had to be built from scratch. Large-scale construction began in 1998, when numerous disputes had finally been settled and the total cost was estimated to be €2.3 billion. The €1.3 billion cost increase arose from numerous geological problems found during construction and additional works required to meet environmental and security concerns. On 2 September 2006, Österreichische Bundesbahnen (ÖBB) locomotive 1216 050 (Siemens Eurosprinter) set a new world record for locomotives with a top speed of ; reached near Hilpoltstein.

His father, Archibald Glen Kidston, was a grandson of the original A.G. Kidston, founder of the firm A.G. Kidston & Co,The Kidston family who was a metal and machinery merchant in Glasgow with interests in the Clyde Shipping Company, local solicitors, accountants and banking interests amalgamated into the Clydesdale Bank. Kidston was a member of the well-known Bentley Boys of the late 1920s, and possibly the wealthiest of that already wealthy set. Kidston was one of the four, core Grosvenor Square-based Bentley team drivers, whose day-long parties passed into contemporary legend. A Lieutenant Commander in the Royal Navy, he was torpedoed twice (in the consecutive sinkings of and ) in the same morning during the action of 22 September 1914 against German submarine under the command of Commander Otto Weddigen. Following repatriation he served in the dreadnought , with the British Grand Fleet at the Battle of Jutland, running gunnery orders on open deck under direct enemy fire. Kidston served on several leading-edge British submarines, including the notorious , which he served on in North Sea trials. During the trials the X1 embedded itself in the seabed as its gauges were faulty. In December 1926 he received command of an H-class submarine, the Beardmore-built , built at Portsmouth. Away from his duties as a submariner, he was an early pioneer of naval flight. Glen Kidston competed in numerous motor races including the Monte Carlo Rally, Isle of Man TT motorcycle races, and Shelsley Walsh hillclimb. As a naval amateur he raced a Sunbeam motorcycle up the hill climb in Hong Kong and conducted speed trials on the sands, bringing the bike with him in his submarine which was patrolling the China Station. Kidston entered the 1929 Irish Grand Prix Éireann Cup at Phoenix Park but was narrowly beaten by the Alfa Romeo of former Russian Imperial Guard officer Boris Ivanowski. This was achieved at the expense of Britons Glen Kidston and Henry Birkin, whose Bentleys were second and third respectively. He also owned and raced the first Bugatti in the UK and entered the Le Mans 24-hour race in 1929 and 1930. On the second occasion he won the race, driving a Bentley Speed Six in partnership with Woolf Barnato, with the Bentley team delivering a 1-2-3-4 victory. In 1929 Kidston was travelling from Croydon to Amsterdam in a German airliner. 21 mins into the flight he sensed an imminent crash and assumed the safety position, likewise assisting his fellow traveller Prince Eugen von Schaumberg-Lippe. On impact, Kidston kicked out the fuselage whilst alight all over and doused himself in the wet grass. He re-entered the burning wreckage to save the badly burned Prince who subsequently died; the flames prevented him assisting others. Kidston fought through a mile of woodland at night to summon help. As he flagged a motorist down, his clothes were still smoking. He was then hospitalised with extensive burns. Kidston was the sole survivor. (Source: Canberra Times Friday 8 November 1929, p. 5). Kidston was a renowned big game shot and travelled on pioneering safaris in remote Kenyan districts. Films of these expeditions, of his early naval and other aviation and Bentley teamwork are held at the British Film Institute due to their quality and pioneering footage. In April 1931, Kidston completed a record breaking flight from Netheravon, Wiltshire to Cape Town, South Africa. He completed the journey in just 6½ days, flying his own specially adapted Lockheed Vega monoplane and averaging 131 mph. However, Kidston was never to make the return trip. After earlier near misses in aeroplane, motorcycle, speed boat and even submarine accidents, Kidston was killed, only a year after his Le Mans triumph, when his borrowed de Havilland Puss Moth broke up in mid-air while flying through a dust storm over the Drakensberg mountains. News of Kidston's death broke in the London evening papers and Margaret Whigham (later Duchess of Argyll) and Barbara Cartland, both amongst Kidston's lovers, claim in their memoirs to have fainted on leaving the theatre and seeing the headlines. The Hollywood femme fatale Pola Negri is also reputed to have known Kidston.  Family  He married Nancy Miriel Denise Soames in 1925 and had a son, Archibald Martin Glen (1927–1978). Cath Kidston is his granddaughter.  Memorials  Kidston's gravestone at St. Peter's in Glasbury-upon-Wye on the Welsh borders, his childhood home, reads \\"Time and tide wait for no man\\", and has a sundial. A memorial to him, an aluminium propeller set in stone, stands at the crash site ().

As presently defined, the southern crested caracara is restricted to central and southern South America. It formerly included the northern crested caracara (C. cheriway) of the southern United States, Mexico, Central America and northern South America, and the extinct Guadalupe caracara (C. lutosa) as subspecies. Similarly to its relatives, it was formerly placed in the genus Polyborus. Description It has a total length of 50–65 cm (20–26 in) and a wingspan of 120–132 cm (47–52 in). Weight is 0.9-1.6 kg (2-3.5 lbs), averaging in 7 birds from Tierra del Fuego.Info about the southern caracara at Zootierliste.deCRC Handbook of Avian Body Masses, 2nd Edition by John B. Dunning Jr. (Editor). CRC Press (2008), . Individuals from the colder southern part of its range average larger than those from tropical regions (as predicted by Bergmann's rule) and are the largest type of caracara. In fact, they are the second largest species of falcon in the world by mean body mass, second only to the gyrfalcon. The cap, belly, thighs, most of the wings and tail-tip are dark brownish, the auriculars, throat and nape are whitish-buff, and the chest, neck, mantle, back, uppertail-coverts, crissum (the undertail coverts surrounding the cloaca) and basal part of the tail are whitish-buff barred dark brownish. In flight, the outer primaries show a large conspicuous whitish-buff patch ('window'), as in several other species of caracaras. The legs are yellow and the bare facial skin and cere are deep yellow to reddish- orange. Juveniles resemble adults, but are paler, with streaking on the chest, neck and back, grey legs, and whitish, later pinkish-purple, facial skin and cere. It can be separated from the similar northern caracara by its more extensive barring on the chest, brownish and often lightly mottled/barred scapulars (all blackish in northern), and pale lower back with dark barring (uniform blackish in northern). Individuals showing intermediate features are known from the small area of contact in north-central Brazil, but intergradation between the two species is generally limited.

It mainly feeds on carcasses of dead animals, but will steal food from other raptors, raid bird nests, and take live prey if the possibility arises (mostly insects or other small prey, but at least up to the size of a snowy egret), it may also eat fruit. It is dominant over the black and turkey vulture at carcasses. It is typically solitary, but several individuals may gather at a large food source (e.g. dumps). Breeding takes place in the austral spring/summer in the southern part of its range, but timing is less strict in warmer regions. The nest is a large open structure, typically placed on the top of a tree or palm, but sometimes on the ground. Average clutch size is two eggs.

An isolated population occurs on the Falkland Islands. It avoids the Andean highlands and dense humid forest, such as the Amazon rainforest, where it is largely restricted to relatively open sections along major rivers. Otherwise, it occurs in virtually any open or semi-open habitat and is often found near humans. Status Throughout most of its range, it is common to very common. It is likely to benefit from the widespread deforestation in tropical South America. It is therefore considered to be of Least Concern by BirdLife International. References * Dove, C. & R.

The red-legged seriema inhabits grasslands from Brazil south of the Amazon to Uruguay and northern Argentina. It is estimated that its range covers an area of 5.9 million km2, although it is not found everywhere in this region. The species is absent from the Mata Atlântica and planalto uplands along the coast of Brazil. Like the black- legged seriema, farmers often use them as guard animals to protect poultry from predators and sometimes human intruders. Taxonomy The red-legged seriema was described in 1766 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the twelfth edition of his Systema Naturae. He coined the binomial name Palamedea cristata. The red-legged seriema is now the only species placed in the genus Cariama that was introduced by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760. The specific epithet cristata is Latin for \\"crested\\", \\"plumed\\" or \\"tufted\\". The German naturalist Georg Marcgrave used the Latin word Cariama for the red-legged seriema in his Historia naturalis Brasiliae which was published in 1648. The name is derived from the Portuguese word çariama for the red-legged seriema which in turn comes from the Tupi language word sariêma for a crested bird. Description Close-up of Cariama cristata It is 75 to 90 cm (30 to 36 in) long and weighs about 1.5 kg, with a fairly long neck, tail, and legs. The plumage is medium brown above with black markings; pale brown on the head, neck, and breast; and white on the belly. The tail has a black band near the tip and a white tip. The beak and legs are red, and the eyes are yellow. Soft feathers emerge from the base of the bill to form a fan- shaped crest. Many other characteristics are shared with the black-legged seriema (Chunga burmeisteri), the only other living member of its family. Some of these traits are discussed in the Cariamidae article. The song has a quality described as \\"a cross between 'the serrated bark of a young dog and the clucking of turkeys'\\". At the loudest part of the song, the bird has its neck bent so its head is touching its back. Both members of a pair as well as young down to the age of two weeks sing; often one member of a family starts a song just as another finishes, or two sing simultaneously. The song can be heard several kilometres away; in Emas National Park, Brazil, in 1981–1982, observers often heard four red-legged seriemas or groups singing at once. The full song consists of three sections: #Repeated single notes at constant pitch (1,200 to 1,300 Hz) and duration but increasing tempo #Repeated two- or three- note subphrases of slightly higher pitch with increasing tempo #Subphrases of up to 10 notes, shorter ones rising in pitch and longer ones falling, two- subphrase combinations increasing in number of notes and tempo and then decreasing in tempo. Their song was notably sampled by Boards of Canada on their track \\"Happy Cycling\\" on their debut album Music Has the Right to Children, which was taken from the Vangelis album La Fête Sauvage. Ecology The red-legged seriema prefers grassland habitat to any other. Though it likes to inhabit lush meadows near rivers, it will not readily move into wetlands or crop fields. It is usually seen singly or in pairs, but sometimes in groups up to four, apparently families. It typically walks on the ground and can easily run faster than a human in its habitat. It will flee a car on foot at speeds up to 25 km/h (15 mph) before flying. In one conflict between two birds, they jumped at each other feet-first, keeping their balance by flapping. This species nests on the ground or in a bush or tree up to three m above the ground. In the latter case adults jump into the nest rather than fly.

These mobile brothels were in some cases officially organised by the army. They consisted of large trailer trucks in which up to ten women would work.The International Encyclopaedia of Sexuality: Vietnam, retrieved on March 10, 2007 The first references to these BMCs were in World War I, and they are noted particularly in the Indochina War and the Algerian War. Almost absent in France after World War II, there were many during the Indochina War and the war in Algeria. Subsequently, only the Foreign Legion still used them but closed the last BMC on French soil, in Guyana, in 1995. The BMC in Djibouti was still operating until 2003. History The tradition of bringing \\"brothels to soldiers\\" was started during the Third Crusade by Philip II of France. He was so shocked by the extent of sodomy and rapes committed by the Crusaders that he arranged for a full boat of \\"girls of joy\\" to be sent from France. The first BMCs probably appeared during the period of military control of Algeria (1830-1870), following its conquest by the French army. The BMCs remained limited to the army in Africa until the First World War. They then arrived in France with the arrival of indigenous units from the colonies. The military command did not want indigenous soldiers to have sex with local women for racist and classist reasons, but also to prevent the troops getting infected by venereal diseases, such as syphilis, which was not curable at the time (Penicillin was only available from 1944). Despite this, four years of war saw the infection of 400,000 men. Initially, no official designation was given to the BMCs. The acronym first appeared in the 1920s with the regulation of signs in the French army, and from then BMCs were mentioned in military documents. Military officials actively provided prostitutes for their troops. The \\"association des maitres et maitresses d'hôtels meublés de France et des colonies\\" played an almost official co-ordinating role. It was governed by a law of 1 July 1901, and located at 73 rue de Nazareth, Paris. The prostitutes were volunteers. The military brothels multiplied during the interwar period, as almost every town with a garrison or a regiment had a BMC. During the colonial wars, the organisation and attendance of BMC was public knowledge and encouraged by the army, especially in Indochina and Algeria (\\"the candy box\\"). In France, brothels were prohibited by \\"Loi Marthe Richard\\" in 1946. However, in 1947, the Ministry of the Armed Forces authorised the continued use of BMCs for North African units while stationed in Metropolitan France, the prostitutes for these BMCs coming from Algeria.

Husiatyn is located in present-day Ukraine. It started with the Rebbe Rabbi Mordechai Shraga Feivish Friedman, the youngest son of Rabbi Israel Friedmann of Rizhin. Reb Mordechai Shraga Feivish was only 16 when his father died and when he turned 30 in 1865, he moved to Husiatyn where he established a large Hasidic court. He died during the spring of 1894 and was succeeded by his son Reb Yisroel who took over the position of rebbe in Husiatyn until 1912. At the outbreak of World War I, he together with other Rebbes of Rizhin moved to Vienna, subsequently settling there. From time to time he made trips to visit his chassidim that remained in Galicia. The Admorim of Rizhin were known for their love of the Land of Israel, and Reb Yisroel’s feelings were especially deep. When one of the rebbes of Rizhin died, plans were made to establish a Rizhin section in the Jewish cemetery in Vienna. The rebbe of Husiatyn stated that there would be no need to take him into account as he proposed to emigrate to Eretz Israel. And so it was, during the 1930s, Reb Yisroel made plans to make aliyah. He traveled around Europe to bid farewell to his followers and warn them of the impending danger. He urged them to make aliyah and leave Europe. As a result of the increased anti-Semitism he had witnessed, himself being a victim of stone throwers in a Viennese street, he had visions of what was to befall the Jewish people in the years to come. In Cracow he was reported to have instructed: \\"Whoever has some sense should flee while he can - even in his slippers!\\" To the Jews who came to the train station in Lvov to greet him he said: \\"Whoever can sell his property should do so, and those who are unable to sell should leave everything and flee from here, even if only with a sack on his back!\\" In 1937 the rebbe docked at Haifa and settled in Tel Aviv. Aged 80 and the only surviving grandson of the Rizhiner Rebbe, he was considered the \\"elder\\" of the rebbes of Rizhin. During the summer months he would reside in Jerusalem until the 3rd of cheshvan, the yartzeit of his grandfather. On that day he would visit the Western Wall and go to pray at the grave of the holy Ohr Hachaim on the Mount of Olives. He led his Hasidim for over 50 years until he died in Tel Aviv aged 92. In his will he requested to be buried on the Mount of Olives and if that was not possible, in Safad or Tiberias. When he died on the fifth day of Hanukkah 1949, the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem was inaccessible being under Jordanian control. As he died on a Friday there was also not enough time to organise a plot in the ancient Jewish cemetery in Safed. He was therefore buried in Tiberias amongst the students of the Baal Shem Tov. His son-in-law, Rabbi Yaakov Freidman, a son of the Bohusher Rebbe, Rabbi Yitzchok Friedman, was appointed as the new leader. He continued the dynasty until his death in 1957 when his son Reb Yitzchok took over. Reb Yitzchok only had one son, Mordechai Shraga, who died at a young age. When Reb Yitzchok died in 1968, the Husiatyn dynasty ended. Today the Husiatyn Beth midrash on Bialik Street, Tel Aviv, continues to be used for prayer and study.

Painting more than 400 portraits over the course of his career, he depicted most of the leading figures of the Danish Golden Age, including the writer Hans Christian Andersen, the painter Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg, the sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen, the physicist Hans Christian Ørsted and the theologian N. F. S. Grundtvig. Although Jensen experienced considerable commercial success, he received little official appreciation from the artistic establishment of his day. In particular, the art historian and critic Niels Lauritz Høyen criticized his style, finding his paintings 'unfinished'. Early life and education Jensen was born at Bredstedt in Nordfriesland. From 1810 to 1816, he attended the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen where he studied under Christian August Lorentzen. From 1817 to 1818, he studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Dresden. Time abroad H. E. Freund portrayed during Jensen's stay in Rome, 1818-20 In 1818, he traveled to Rome by way of Vienna, Venice, Bologna and Florence. When he arrived, he joined the large colony of Danish-German artists' who lived in the city at the time and also met the sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen. During his years in Rome, Jensen painted small, informal portraits of many of his fellow artists, including the writer Bernhard Severin Ingemann who visited Rome from 1818 to 1819, and the sculptor Hermann Ernst Freund, Thorvaldsen's closest associate from 1818 to 1828. After leaving Rome, he made an unsuccessful attempt to establish himself as a portrait painter in Hamburg. Success and criticism Back in Copenhagen in the winter of 1822/23, the portrait scene was dominated by Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg's sober, Neoclassical style, yet Jensen's more psychological portraits won immediate popularity. Up through the 1820s, he portrayed a large number of prominent members of Danish society but in spite of his commercial success he received little appreciation from art critics or from the establishment at the Academy and when a professorial chair became vacant after Christian August Lorentzen died in 1828 he was passed by. Carl Friedrich Gauss, 1840 After 1830, commissions dwindled and he experienced financial difficulties. In response, he started collaborating with the historical collections at Frederiksborg Castle, painting both copies of older pictures and originals. This led to a controversy with Niels Lauritz Høyen, an influential art historian and critic who, from the beginning, had been critical of his style, finding his pictures 'unfinished'. From 1837, he increasingly looked to other countries for customers. By the Pulkovo Observatory, which opened near Saint Petersburg, he was commissioned to paint 11 portraits of leading international scientists. His painting of Carl Friedrich Gauss from that series remains the most famous portrait of the mathematician. Other portrayed scientists included the astronomer Wilhelm von Struve. Late life The 1840s brought a further decline in orders, prompted by his political views which were not in line with the nationalist tendencies at the time as well as by continued criticism from Høyen. Eventually, after completing more than 400 portraits, he stopped painting. His last two works, portraits of Andreas Christian Krog (1854) and the theologian Andreas Gottlob Rudelbach, are considered to be among his best. For the remainder of his life, he worked as an assistant at the Royal Print Collection and as a conservator, supplementing his income by selling paintings from his large art collection.

Biography In the 1340s Pål Knutsson was an ombudsman who owned much of the Tveit farm at Tysnes in Hordaland. By 1348 he had been promoted to judge of the Gulathing within the district of Gulen. In November 1354 Pål Knutsson was commissioned by King Magnus of Sweden and Norway to travel to Greenland and to assess the state of affairs there. The Orders of King Magnus to Paul Knutson (Royal Library of Copenhagen) The Bishop of Gardar in Greenland as well as the Bishops of Oslo, Bergen, Stavanger, Hamar, Orkney, as well as Iceland (Skalholt and Holar), were subject to the Archdiocese of Nidaros. Gardar diocese in Greenland was without a bishop during the decade following the death of Bishop Árni in 1347. Greenland was without a Bishop until Bishop Álfur was ordained in 1368. Ivar Bardsson served as principal of the diocese during the interim period. Ivar Bardsson was appointed Canon at the Bergen Cathedral after having spent time in Greenland as a substitute for the Bishop of the diocese. Bardsson expressed concern about the preservation of Christianity among the settlers in the Western Settlement of Greenland .Ivar Bårdsson (Store norske leksikon)Garðar (Store norske leksikon) King Magnus however was ruling Norway only as regent for his son, King Haakon, who came of age a few months later. There is no evidence that the proposed expedition ever sailed, except for the negative evidence that the 1354 order seems to be the only document mentioning Knutson after 1348. Although this indicates that Knutson survived the arrival of the Black Death (Svartedauden) plague at Bergen in 1349, many other government officials throughout the country did not. Arne Einarsson Vade, Archbishop of Nidaros, died in 1349 during the Black Death, along with the entire diocese staff and a breakdown in record-keeping means that it is very difficult to tell what was actually happening in the years following the plague.Arne Einarsson Vade (Store norske leksikon) Svartedauden (Store norske leksikon) Some later day historians, including Hjalmar Holand, have asserted that Knutson's expedition may have journeyed deep into North America and created the Kensington Runestone.Kensington Runestone ( North American Rune Stones) Note Unlike most earlier documents relating to Knutson, this order only survives via a 16th-century Danish translation, so its precise significance is open to interpretation.

Conchobar appears as a historical figure for the first time when, in the year 802, the high-king Áed Oirdnide mac Néill of Cenél nÉogain, Conchobar's brother-in-law (possibly father-in-law) portioned out the lordship of Clann Cholmáin between Conchobar and Ailill. Ailill was Conchobar's brother, but in the following year at Rathconnell, Conchobar killed his brother to take the whole lordship for himself.Hudson, \\"Conchobar mac Donnchada (d. 833)\\". Only five years later Conchobar, allied now with the king of Connaught, campaigned for the High- Kingship. He met and defeated his former patron Áed Oirdnide, but it was not until Áed's death in 819 that Conchobar was recognized as High-King. Even then Conchobar had to deal with the opposition of Áed's cousin, Murchad mac Máele Dúin. The latter was able to form an alliance with one of Conchobar's own subject kindreds, the Síl nÁedo Sláine. Conchobar soon became aware of the treachery, and in 822 he took revenge on this kindred in \\"an especially horrific slaughter\\".Hudson, \\"Conchobar mac Donnchada (d. 833)\\". In 823 Conchobar formed an alliance with Feidlimid mac Crimthainn, King of Munster (820–847). However, Conchobar's attempts to subordinate Munster and its king proved intolerable to Feidlimid, and from 827 onwards Feidlimid mac Crimthainn was a source of opposition.Hudson, \\"Conchobar mac Donnchada (d. 833)\\"; Moody, Martin, and Byrne, (eds.), Maps, Genealogies, Lists, p. 193, n. 26. Conchobar died in unknown circumstances in 833, to which renewed Viking raids formed the backdrop. He is buried at Clonard Abbey.Moody, Martin, and Byrne, (eds.), Maps, Genealogies, Lists, p. 193, n. 25.

The Wolfsburg-Berlin section was built as a new line and runs largely parallel to the Lehrter Bahn (the old Berlin-Hanover railway) opened in 1871. The whole line was opened officially on 15 September 1998 and has been in commercial service since 20 September 1998. The overall Hanover-Berlin project (including the reorganization and upgrading of the Lehrter Bahn) was carried out as German unity rail project no 4 (VDE 4) of the federal transport plan.  Project  The line consists of five sections: upgraded line between Hanover and Lehrte (for operations up to 160 km/h) and between Lehrte and Wolfsburg (200 km/h), the new and upgraded line between Wolfsburg and Oebisfelde (68 km altogether); the 148 km-long new line between Oebisfelde and Staaken (250 km/h) and the connection between Staaken and the Berlin Stadtbahn and Berlin station (60 to 160 km/h). Due to its flat profile the line has few structures, apart from a cut-and-cover tunnel under the Elbe Lateral Canal (c. 1975) and four large bridges over the Mittelland Canal, the Elbe, the Havel and the Havel Canal. The line was the first German line which was mostly constructed with slab (ballast-less) track.  Stations  * Berlin Hauptbahnhof * Berlin-Spandau * Stendal * Wolfsburg * Hannover Hauptbahnhof  Planning  In the 1980s planning began on an improved line for ICE trains for transit traffic (people who were allowed to transit, but did not have a visa to visit East Germany) between West Germany and West Berlin. In September 1988, the governments of West Germany and East Germany began negotiations in relation to the development of the Lehrterbahn for speeds up to 200 km/h.Jahresrückblick 1988 − Neu- und Ausbaustrecken. In Die Bundesbahn 1/1989, S. 58 Options available were: *Northern route via Wolfsburg and Stendal to the old Lehrte railway *Southern route via Magdeburg and Potsdam to the Berlin-Potsdam-Magdeburg railway In 1990 the northern route was chosen; it was the shortest and fastest connection between Berlin and Hanover and was used by the long-distance high-speed trains before World War II. The option that was favored had the transit tracks parallel with, but separately from, the existing tracks of the Lehrterbahn, which would remain available for internal East German traffic. The existing line would be used from Wolfsburg to Hanover as an upgraded line. The new and upgraded line was intended for passenger traffic and the original line for goods traffic. At several points the new and original lines were to be interconnected, including Rathenow and Stendal. On 28 June 1990 the transport ministers of the two still separate Germans States, Horst Gibtner and Friedrich Zimmermann signed an agreement to build a high-speed line along the existing Lehrtebahn, following two years of negotiations.Helmut Weber, Gernot Arnhold: Schnellverbindung Hannover–Berlin: Abschnitt Oebisfelde–Staaken ein Jahr nach Planungsstart. In Die Bundesbahn 10/1991, p 977 ff. It was originally planned that the high- speed line would be used by an hourly IC/ICE line between Hanover and/or Braunschweig and Berlin. As a result of the expected increase of traffic due to German reunification four lines had been adopted by 1991: *Berlin–Hannover–Ruhr Area *Berlin–Hannover–Bremen *Berlin–Wolfsburg–Braunschweig–Kassel–Frankfurt *Berlin–Stendal–Salzwedel–Uelzen–Hamburg Taking into regional, suburban and freight trains, planning was based on 200 trains each day (in both directions) between Berlin and Stendal for the high-speed and original routes. In consequence, it was decided that the design speed for the high-speed line would be 250 km/h, the original line would be developed for a design speed of 160 instead of 120 km/h and earthworks and structures on the largely single- track original route between Staaken and Stendal would make provision for a second track.  Construction  Berlin-Hamburg line near Spandau Building began on 11 November 1992 with the beginning of work on the 812 m-long Elbe bridge at Hämerten. Parallel to the building of the new line, Lehrterbahn was reorganised. At the same time construction commenced at Berlin Spandau long- distance station and on the Weddel loop line, a 21 km-long connection between Fallersleben (near Wolfsburg) and Weddel (near Braunschweig). The 16.7 hz traction current line between Oebisfelde and Rathenow, which was brought into service on 14 March 1995, was the first traction current connection established between west and east Germany. The last viaduct was finished in October 1997 with the bridge over the Havel Canal. During the building phase, archaeologists carried out approximately 4,000 digs in Brandenburg and made discoveries in 30 places, including finds of some objects that were over 1,500 years old. Numerous test and acceptance runs were made with ICE S trains at up to 331 km/h between April and August 1998. Services commenced on 24 May 1998 on the Vorsfelde-Stendal section. On 15 September 1998 the whole line was officially opened. In 2005 long-planned changes began on the eastern side of Lehrte station. On 15 January 2007 two new bridges were opened as a flying junction in Lehrte, overcoming congestion at the junction. When work on points is completed in 2008, the running speed of the main line will be raised from 60 to 120 km/h. The Federal government plans to invest € 376 million for upgrades between Hanover and Lehrte between 2006 and 2010.Bundesministerium für Verkehr, Bau und Stadtentwicklung: Investitionsrahmenplan bis 2010 für die Verkehrsinfrastruktur des Bundes, April 2007 =Great bustard protection area= East of Rathenow, near Buckow, the line runs by the 6,400 ha nature reserve of Havelländisches Luch. It is one of the last refuges in Germany for the vulnerable great bustard, one of the heaviest flying birds of the world. There were extensive discussions until 1995 in relation to measures to protect the birds, including consideration of the building of a six-km long tunnel for approximately DM one billion. In order not to disturb the birds, this would have required about seven years to build. A cut-and-cover tunnel would have cost DM 500 million. A deviation around the entire area was also examined. In order to protect the endangered species, for a length of six km (between the 153 and 158 km marks) seven metre-high embankments were built to assist the over-flight of the birds, which have quite slow and low take-offs. The cost for this work was DM 35 million. On a 17 km-long section (between the 148.5 and the 165.5 km marks) the third track of the parallel Lehrterbahn was omitted and trains from it run on the new line. In addition on this section, the overall height of the electrification supply lines is reduced and the maximum speed is reduced to 200 km/h. An area of approximately 300 hectares was added to the nature park as compensatory habitat. This work delayed the planned opening from 1997 to 1998. = Commencement of operations = On 24 May 1998 the Wolfsburg-Oebisfelde-Stendal section of the new line entered service. The whole new line was officially opened on 15 September 1998 by the Chancellor Helmut Kohl, DB boss Johannes Ludewig and Berlin Mayor Eberhard Diepgen. In Berlin Ostbahnhof the opening ICE was officially named the “Claus Graf Stauffenberg”, before it ran to Hanover via Stendal and Wolfsburg as ICE18952. With the timetable change on 20 September 1998 the travel time between Berlin and Hanover was reduced from four hours and twelve minutes (1990) to one and a half hours; the Berlin-Frankfurt time was reduced to an even four hours. The drastic travel time reduction on the new line led to rising passenger numbers, as a result of the cancellation of the competing air services between Berlin and Hanover. With the opening of the high-speed line, the two state capitals of Magdeburg and Potsdam lost their ICE connections. As a consequence there were violent protests, which led for some time to the reinstatement of occasional ICEs between Berlin and Wolfsburg on the old line.  Service  Several ICE/IClines run across the line: *ICE:: Berlin−Hannover−Hamm−Essen−Düsseldorf−Cologne or Hamm−Wuppertal− Cologne. This line is operated hourly by ICE 2 trains that are divided into two trains at Hamm. * ICE: Berlin−Braunschweig−Kassel−Wilhelmshöhe−Frankfurt− Mannheim−Basel or Mannheim−Stuttgart−Munich. It operates to Mannheim each hour, then alternating every two hours to Basel or Munich. This line also runs over the Hanover-Würzburg high-speed line and uses ICE 1s. * IC: Berlin− Hannover−Osnabrück−Münster or Osnabrück−Bad Bentheim−Amsterdam every two hours, branching every four hours in Osnabrück. = Running speeds = The new line is regularly operated between the 178 km-mark of the Lehrterbahn (near Vorsfelde) and the 118 km-mark (near Berlin-Staaken) at 250 km/h; in the great bustard protection area (148 to 166 km-marks) the maximum speed is 200 km/h. The upgraded line in the Lehrte–Wolfsburg–Oebisfelde section is designed for 200 km/h. On 13 August 2001 an ICE S ran on the new line at 393 km/h. This is the second highest speed that has been achieved so far on German railways. In 2011 the part from Ribbeck to Wustermark was upgraded for 300 km/h and use of the eddy current brake during regular operation.

It was created in 1974 when the Tabqa Dam was closed. Lake Assad is Syria's largest lake with a maximum capacity of and a maximum surface area of . A vast network of canals uses water from Lake Assad to irrigate lands on both sides of the Euphrates. In addition, the lake provides drinking water for the city of Aleppo and supports a fishing industry. The shores of Lake Assad have developed into important ecological zones.  Project history  The first plans for a dam in the Syrian part of the Euphrates date to 1927, but these were not carried out. In 1957, an agreement was reached with the Soviet Union for technical and financial aid for the construction of a dam in the Euphrates, and in 1960 a financial agreement was signed with West Germany. Another agreement to finance the project was signed with the Soviet Union in 1965. The project included a hydroelectric power station in the Tabqa Dam, and the construction of a vast irrigation network capable of irrigating of land on both sides of the Euphrates. Construction of the dam lasted between 1968 and 1973 and the flooding of the reservoir commenced in 1974 by reducing the flow of the Euphrates. The project was completed under the presidency of Hafez al- Assad as part of his modernization policies and agricultural reforms. In 1975, Iraq complained that the flow of the Euphrates had been reduced below an acceptable level and threatened to bomb the Tabqa Dam; mediation by Saudi Arabia and the Soviet Union eventually settled this dispute. = Rescue excavations in the Lake Assad region = In anticipation of the flooding of the Tabqa Dam reservoir, an intensive, international program of archaeological rescue excavations was carried out in the threatened area between 1963 and 1974. As part of this program, excavations have been carried out at sites ranging in date from the Late Natufian to the Ottoman period. Excavated sites include Tell Abu Hureyra, Emar, Habuba Kabira, Mureybet, Tell es-Sweyhat, Tell Fray and Dibsi Faraj. At Qal'at Ja'bar, a castle on a hilltop that would be turned into an island by the flooding of Lake Assad, a protective glacis was built and two minarets at Mureybet and Meskene were relocated to an area beyond the flood zone.  Characteristics  The maximum capacity of Lake Assad is at a surface area of , making it the largest lake in Syria. The actual capacity is, however, much lower at , resulting in a surface area of . The proposed irrigation scheme suffered from a number of problems, including the high gypsum content in the reclaimed soils around Lake Assad, soil salinization, the collapse of canals that distributed the water from Lake Assad, and the unwillingness of farmers to resettle in the reclaimed areas. As a result, only were irrigated from Lake Assad in 1984. In 2000, the irrigated surface had risen to , which is 19 percent of the projected . Lake Assad is the most important source of drinking water to Aleppo, providing the city through a pipeline with of drinking water per year. The lake also supports a fishing industry. Syro–Turkish part of the Euphrates basin showing the location of the Tabqa Dam (Barrage de Tabqa) and Lake Assad directly west of italt=Refer to caption The western shore of the lake has developed into an important marshland area. On the southeastern shore, some areas have been reforested with evergreen trees including the Aleppo pine and the Euphrates poplar. Lake Assad is an important wintering location for migratory birds and the government has recently undertaken measures to protect small areas along the shores of Lake Assad from hunters by downgrading access roads. The island of Jazirat al-Thawra has been designated a nature reserve. During the Syrian Civil War, water levels in Lake Assad have dropped significantly. This drop is possibly caused by the power station of the Tabqa Dam, which pumps more water out of the lake than is supplied by the Euphrates.

Plot summary An unnamed narrator marries Morella, a woman with great scholarly knowledge who delves into studies of the German philosophers Fichte and Schelling, dealing with the question of identity. Morella spends her time in bed reading and teaching her husband. Realizing her physical deterioration, her husband, the narrator, becomes frightened and wishes for his wife's death and eternal peace. Eventually, Morella dies in childbirth proclaiming: \\"I am dying. But within me is a pledge of that affection... which thou didst feel for me, Morella. And when my spirit departs shall the child live.\\" As the daughter gets older the narrator notices she bears an uncanny resemblance to her mother, but he refuses to give the child a name. By her tenth birthday the resemblance to Morella is frightening. Her father decides to have her baptized to release any evil from her, but this event brings the mother's soul back into her daughter. At the ceremony, the priest asks the daughter's name, to which the narrator replies \\"Morella\\". Immediately, the daughter calls out, \\"I am here!\\" and dies. The narrator himself bears her body to the tomb and finds no trace of the first Morella where he lays the second. Analysis The narrator's decision to name his daughter Morella implies his subconscious desire for her death, just as he had for her mother.Kennedy, J. Gerald. \\"Poe, 'Ligeia', and the Problem of Dying Women\\" collected in New Essays on Poe's Major Tales, edited by Kenneth Silverman. Cambridge University Press, 1993. p. 119.

Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall Inc., 1967. p. 39 Poe explores the idea of what happens to identity after death, suggesting that if identity survived death it could exist outside the human body and return to new bodies.Morella He was influenced in part by the theories of identity by Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling, whom he mentions in the story.Campbell, Killis. The Mind of Poe and Other Studies. New York: Russell & Russell, Inc., 1962: 13. There are a number of possible origins for the name \\"Morella\\". It is the name of the Venerable Mother Juliana Morell (1595–1653), who was the fourth Grace and tenth Muse in a poem by poet Lope de Vega. \\"Morel\\" is the name of black nightshade, a poisonous weed related to one from which the drug belladonna is derived. It occurs in Presburg (now Bratislava), a reputed home of black magic where Morella is said to have received her education. =Major themes= Poe features dead or dying women in many of his tales (see also \\"Berenice\\", \\"Ligeia\\") and resurrection or communication from beyond the grave (see \\"Eleonora\\", \\"The Fall of the House of Usher\\"). Publication history \\"Morella\\" was first published in the April 1835 issue of the Southern Literary Messenger, and a revised version was re-printed in the November 1839 issue of Burton's Gentleman's Magazine. The first publication included a 16-line poem of Poe's called \\"Hymn\\" sung by Morella, later published as a stand-alone poem, \\"A Catholic Hymn\\". Adaptations \\"Morella\\" is the title of one segment of Roger Corman's 1962 film Tales of Terror. The film stars Vincent Price, Peter Lorre, and Basil Rathbone. The film has two other segments named after \\"The Black Cat\\" and \\"The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar\\".

It stars Deborah Kerr, Stewart Granger and Richard Carlson. It was adapted by Helen Deutsch, directed by Compton Bennett and Andrew Marton and released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Plot Allan Quatermain (Stewart Granger), an experienced hunter and guide, reluctantly agrees to help Elizabeth Curtis (Deborah Kerr) and her brother John Goode (Richard Carlson) search for her husband, who disappeared in the unexplored African interior while searching for the legendary titular mines. They have a copy of the map he used. A tall, mysterious native, Umbopa (Siriaque), joins the safari. Allan has no use for women on a safari, but during the long and grueling journey, he and Elizabeth begin to fall in love. The party encounters Van Brun (Hugo Haas), a lone white man living with a tribe. They learn that he met Curtis. However, when Allan recognizes him as a fugitive who cannot afford to let them go, they take him hostage to leave the village safely. Van Brun tries to shoot Allan, killing his faithful right-hand man Khiva (Kimursi), instead. Allan dispatches Van Brun and the party flees from the angry villagers. When they finally reach the region where the mines are supposed to be, they are met by people who resemble Umbopa. They discover that their companion is royalty; he has returned to attempt to dethrone the evil usurper King Twala (Baziga). Umbopa leaves with his supporters to raise a rebellion, while Allan, Elizabeth and John travel to a tense meeting with Twala. With his last rifle bullet, John kills a would-be attacker, temporarily quelling the natives. The king's advisor, Gagool (Sekaryongo), communicates that they have seen Curtis and leads them to a cave that contains a trove of jewels and the skeletal remains of Elizabeth's husband. While they are distracted by this grisly discovery, Gagool sneaks away and triggers a booby trap that seals them inside the cave. They find a way out through an underground stream and return to Twala's kraal, just as Umbopa and his followers arrive. Umbopa's people have an unusual method of deciding a disputed kingship. The two claimants duel to the death. Despite cheating by one of Twala's men, Umbopa wins. Afterwards, he provides an escort for his friends' return trip.

Sam Zimbalist was assigned the job of producing. In October 1948 Helen Deutsch was assigned to write the script. MGM typically made one or two big \\"overseas\\" spectacles a year around this time. When Quo Vadis was postponed, it was decided to film King Solomon's Mines on location in Africa. Production equipment was trucked in, with a total travel distance of over , using a convoy of Dodge trucks. =Adaptation= Like virtually all film versions, this also changes Haggard's plot to include a female lead. But it strays even further from the novel than the 1937 British adaptation King Solomon's Mines. There are several African characters in the book, particularly Umbopa, a king in disguise. In the earlier film, Paul Robeson received top billing for the role, whereas in this version, Umbopa's importance is greatly reduced. =Casting= Deborah Kerr was announced as the female lead in July 1949. MGM wanted Errol Flynn to co-star. The same month Compton Bennett was signed to direct; he had just finished That Forsyth Woman for MGM with Flynn. Flynn eventually chose instead to star in Kim. Stewart Granger was signed instead in August 1949. Richard Carlson was cast in September. =Shooting= Filming took place at the following locations in Africa: Murchison Falls in Uganda; Astrida, \\"the land of giant Watusis\\"; Volcano Country and Stanleyville in the Belgian Congo; Tanganyika; and Rumuruti and Machakos in Kenya. The film marked the beginning of Eva Monley's career as a Hollywood location scout and producer, specializing in Africa. Monley received her first film job as a script supervisor and assistant during production of King Solomon's Mines. Additionally, the cave scene was filmed in the Slaughter Canyon Cave in Carlsbad Caverns National Park and other scenes at nearby Sitting Bull Falls in Lincoln National Forest, both in the state of New Mexico, in the Southwestern United States. In February 1950, after five months of location filming in Africa, Andrew Marton replaced Compton Bennett as director. The official reason given was Bennett fell ill but there were rumours that Bennett had a falling out with some of the cast. Reception =Critical= Bosley Crowther of The New York Times wrote that \\"there is more than a trace of outright hokum in this thriller ... but there is also an ample abundance of scenic novelty and beauty to compensate.\\" Variety called it a \\"striking adventure film\\" with \\"high excitement in meetings with wild savages and beasts and a number of excellently staged fights-to-the-death.\\" Harrison's Reports called it \\"a highly spectacular romantic adventure melodrama that has the rare quality of holding an audience captivated from start to finish.\\" John McCarten of The New Yorker wrote, \\"'King Solomon's Mines' undertakes to show what a safari through Africa might have been up against fifty years ago. In this, I think, the picture, which was shot in the African highlands, succeeds admirably.\\" The Monthly Film Bulletin called it \\"a somewhat stilted epic, strangely lacking in excitement\\", with Kerr seeming \\"miscast and out of place.\\" =Box Office= The film was the third most popular film at the British box office in 1951. It was also a big hit in France, with admissions of 4,108,770.Box office information for Stewart Granger films in France at Box Office Story According to MGM records, the film earned $5,047,000 in the US and Canada. It made $4,908,000 elsewhere. After production and other associated costs were deducted, the movie made a profit of $4,049,000, which made it MGM's most successful film of 1950, and the second highest-grossing film of that year in the United States. Awards and nominations Robert L. Surtees won the Academy Award for Best Cinematography, Color, while Ralph E. Winters and Conrad A. Nervig won for Best Film Editing. The film was nominated for Best Picture. Other film versions Other films based on H. Rider Haggard's novel include: * The 1936 British film King Solomon's Mines, directed by Robert Stevenson and Geoffrey Barkas and starring Paul Robeson and Cedric Hardwicke. * In 1959, MGM released a film titled Watusi loosely based on Haggard's novel. That film was directed by Kurt Neumann and starred George Montgomery, Taina Elg and Rex Ingram. Reviews of the 1959 film indicate that MGM used some footage of the earlier film for Watusi. Modern sources indicate that leftover footage from its 1950 film was also used in the 1977 Canadian- British film King Solomon's Treasure. * Another film based on Haggard's Allan Quatermain is the 1987 Cannon release Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold, which was filmed concurrently with its 1985 King Solomon's Mines and also starred Richard Chamberlain and Sharon Stone. * The 2004 two-part TV miniseries King Solomon's Mines starred Patrick Swayze and Alison Doody. Radio adaptation King Solomon's Mines was presented on Lux Radio Theatre on December 1, 1952. The one-hour adaptation featured Kerr and Granger in their screen roles.

Military career Sámano was a member of a distinguished family with a long tradition in the militia. In 1771 he entered the military as a cadet, and by 1779 he was a lieutenant. He was also a professor of mathematics at the Military Academy of Barcelona, where he remained five years. In 1780 he moved to the Indies -- first to Puerto Rico, later to Cuba, and finally to Cartagena de Indias (in modern Colombia). In 1785 he returned to Europe. In 1789 he was promoted to captain and fought in the war with revolutionary France, under the command of General Ventura Caro. In one battle he was wounded in both thighs. In 1794 he was transferred back to New Granada, at his request. He became governor of Riohacha in 1806, where he repelled a British attack. From Riohacha he went to Bogotá, accompanied by 30 cavalry troops. There he volunteered for the service of Viceroy Antonio José Amar y Borbón to fight against the insurgents. As a colonel, Sámano was in command of the Auxiliar Battalion in Bogotá at the time of the Florero de Llorente (Cry of Independence) on July 20, 1810. His second in command was José María Moledo, who together with other officers not only sympathized with the revolution, but took an active part in it. That night Sámano remained in his quarters, guarded by Moledo and Baraya, who had sworn allegiance to the rebel junta in Bogotá. In the early morning of July 21, Colonel Sámano took an oath before the president of the Junta, José Miguel Pey. Pey ordered that he be relieved of his command of the Auxliar Battalion. Lieutenant Colonel Moledo was named to replace him. Sámano was issued a passport so that he could leave New Granada. He returned to Spain, where he was commissioned to pacify the region of Quito and Guayaquil. From Quito he directed the military operations against the rebels in New Granada. In 1813 he was named by Governor Toribio Montes to lead an expedition to recover the southern part of the Viceroyalty of New Granada. He got as far as the city of Popayán, which he occupied on July 1, 1813. There he proclaimed the authority of the Constitution of Cádiz. He was promoted to brigadier. Sámano was defeated by Antonio Nariño in the Battle of Alto Palacé on December 30, 1813, and again in the Battle of Calibío on January 15, 1814. He fled with a reduced group of soldiers to Pasto. There he was replaced by Field Marshal Melchor Aymerich, because, according to Governor Toribio Montes, though Sámano was loyal to the Crown and had much military experience, more audacious tactics were needed for a royalist victory. He returned to Quito, where he was given command of another expedition to New Granada. His command in Pasto was restored, and on June 29, 1816 he won a decisive victory at Cuchilla del Tambo over the rebel Liborio Mejía. Two hundred fifty were killed, and the Royalists took 300 prisoners and all of the rebels' arms and equipment. On July 1, 1816 Sámano's troops again occupied Popayán. Among the patriots taken prisoner was José Hilario López, who unexpectedly escaped execution and later became president of New Granada (1849–53). Sámano ordered the execution of rebel leader Carlos Montúfar. After promoting him to field marshal, Morillo gave Sámano command of Bogotá as commanding general of New Granada. He arrived in Bogotá on October 23, 1816, where he began a program of repression without the approval of Viceroy Francisco Montalvo y Ambulodi. He founded three tribunals: the Permanent Council of War, empowered to issue death sentences against the rebels; the Council of Purification, authorized to judge rebels not meriting the death penalty; and the Junta of Confiscation, intended to seize the possessions of others compromised in the rebellion. Among the rebels executed were Camilo Torres, Francisco José de Caldas, Joaquín Camacho, Frutos Joaquín Gutiérrez, Antonio Villavicencio, Antonio Baraya, Liborio Mejía, Jorge Tadeo Lozano, Policarpa Salavarrieta, Alejo Sabaraín, and María Antonia Santos Plata. As viceroy In August 1817 Sámano was named viceroy, governor and captain general of the reborn Viceroyalty of New Granada, and president of the Audiencia of Bogotá. By royal decree he was granted the Grand Cross of the Order of San Hermenegildo, for his services to the Crown. He took formal possession of his new offices on March 9, 1818. He founded the Academy of Medicine in Bogotá. However, the Audiencia formally complained of his administration to Madrid. News of the defeat of José Barreiro forces in the Battle of Boyacá arrived in the capital. Sámano quickly fled to Cartagena de Indias, where they refused to recognize his authority. (He was unpopular there because of his reputation for repression.) He sailed for Jamaica, but soon returned to Panama. He remained there without administrative or military control until his resignation. In August 1819, old and sick, he resigned as viceroy. He remained in Panama until his death in July 1821, awaiting permission to return to Spain.

Boxley (born 1952) is an American artist from the Tsimshian tribe in Alaska, most known for his prolific creation of Totem Poles and other Tsimshian artworks. Boxley was raised in Metlakatla, Alaska, home to many Tsimshian people. His works, done in traditional Tsimshian style and technique, have had international reach, and he is known as one of the most prolific contemporary makers of Totem Poles in the world. He has created over 70 poles, which have been displayed in notable places like Disney World, Florida and the Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian, where it is permanently displayed. His other carvings are in the collections of various museums, and owned by royal families and nobles across Europe and Asia. He has also played a part in reviving Tsimshian culture, creating Tsimshian dance groups, reviving the traditional ceremony called Potlatch, and passing on knowledge of Tsimshian language. Boxley currently lives in Lynnwood, Washington, and his son’s, particularly David R. Boxley, are also successful artists and carvers. He is a member of the Laxsgiik (Eagle clan), and his four Tsimshian names include one meaning \\"First to Potlatch\\" and one meaning \\"He Who Works with the Cedar.\\"  Early life  Boxley was born in Ketchikan, Revillagigedo Island, Alaska, in 1952, but grew up in Metlakatla, Alaska. He was mostly raised by his grandparents, and would spend most of his time with them as a child. Due to nearly a century of cultural oppression in Alaska towards the Tsimshian, traditional Tsimshian culture was nearly extinct in Metlakatla, and in the region as a whole, while Boxley was growing up. Unlike most children around him, Boxley was surrounded by traditional Tsimshian culture in his childhood. This was on account of his grandparents, who both spoke the Tsimshian language and knew many traditions of the past. He first learned to carve from his Grandfather, who he often describes as his “hero”. He described his grandfather as a man who “could build anything” and would pass on knowledge to Boxley, such as what wood should be used to carve, and how to create his own tools. His first works were those he helped carve with his grandfather growing up, and he still currently uses an adze made with the help of his grandfather in every carving project. Apart from this, Boxley claims he had been interested in being an artist “since third grade”. After High School, Boxley attended Seattle Pacific University, and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1974. He then spent ten years working as a High School teacher and basketball coach in Seattle, Metlakatla and Washington. During this time, he began to seriously research the traditional art and culture of the Tsimshian. He studied the works of previous Tsimshian artists, and artists of other Pacific Northwest Coast artists such as the Haida and Tlingit. He also studied the works that the ancestors of these tribes left behind. Boxley also used libraries, art classes, museums, heritage sites and others, as well as taking some classes from a prominent Tsimshian artist at the time- Jack Hudson. However, Boxley mostly taught himself from his own research, and learned many traditional art styles and methods that had been lost to time. This soon overtook his teaching, and Boxley eventually decided to become a full time artist and carver in the mid 1980s.  Career and works  = Early Work (mid-1980s – 1990s) = Since the mid 1980s, Boxley has worked on many commissions. One of his first major ones was for the ‘Talking Stick’ for the 1990 Goodwill Games. Boxley designed the crown of the stick, and made it a symbolic symbol of peace between the United States and then Soviet Union, depicting the American eagle and the Russian bear together. The stick even had messages by the countries respective leaders at the time- President George H.W. Bush. and President Mikhail Gorbachev- engraved in it. It was a significant work that had a global audience, with the stick being carried across states similar to the Olympic Torch. Since this period, his reputation has grown as an elite carver and he has garnered an international reach. = Totem Poles (1980s–present) = Boxley is best known for his Totem Poles, which have been displayed across the U.S, Canada and Europe. They have been displayed in various notable areas.  Walt Disney World  Three of Boxley’s poles stand at the Canada Pavilion in Epcot Center in Walt Disney World, Florida. He was asked to create a new totem pole for the center in 1998, alongside the two fiberglass ones that already stood in the Center. This was done in an effort to give the Center greater authenticity, as the theme park was taking multiple initiatives to be more authentic. Then, in 2017, Disney commissioned Boxley to create two more poles to replace the fiberglass ones. These poles have since been lauded for their attempts at authenticity, but to some culture critics make the claim that putting the poles into a tourist setting might result in them losing their cultural significance.  National Museum of the American Indian  David Boxley and his son, David R. working on a Totem Pole in the National Museum of the American Indian Another of Boxley's poles is currently in the Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian in Washington D.C, where it is permanently displayed. This is significant as the Museum usually rotates their exhibitions and keeps only popular or iconic artworks on permanent display. It was Boxley’s 70th pole, made out of a 500 year old cedar tree, and he was helped to carve it by his son David. The Museum is coveted by Native American artists, and a spot in the museum is very sought after. Boxley is very proud to have a pole in the museum, and was especially glad that the Tsimshian tribe and his village of Metlakatla were broadcast to a national and global audience due to the pole being raised. He is the second contemporary Totem Pole carver in the world to have a pole in the Museum, after Nathan Jackson.  Metlakatla and the U.S  In addition to having poles stand internationally, he has carved most of the poles in his native village of Metlakatla. In 1982, he made the town’s first raised pole, and has since made others, alongside carver Wayne Hewson. Together, they have made 11 out of Metlakatla’s 13 totem poles. Most of his poles stand across the U.S and Canada. Many of these hold personal meaning, such as the one that stands outside Northwest Hospital in Seattle, dedicated to his deceased sister-in-law. Another is one of three poles in Metlakatla that stand next to each other. Boxley made the largest one, which stands 30ft tall, in honour of his grandfather. = Other works (1980s–present) = In addition to Totem Poles, Boxley has made many other items, such as bentwood boxes, masks, rattles, prints, panels and paintings. Many of these works are in the collections of galleries, museums and art auctions across the United States and Europe. He has formed a strong relationship with Quintana Galleries in Portland, Oregon, where his work has become a permanent fixture. Many of the items are also in the collection of various world leaders, such as in Germany, the King of Sweden, and the Emperor of Japan. = Passing on Knowledge (2010s–present) = Boxley continues to carve today, and in recent years has dedicated efforts to training and teaching younger generations of Tsimshian people his knowledge and techniques. His sons, David and Zachery, have notably followed their father’s line of work and are both successful carvers in their own right. David R. Boxley in particular has garnered his own reputation as a talented carver, and has started making Totem Poles himself. Boxley now works with his sons, stepson and nephew on most of his works. In 2019, Boxley formally took on an apprentice, Dylan Sanidad, through The Washington State Arts Apprenticeship Program, whom he will teach traditional Tsimshian carving.  Art style and techniques  Boxley’s works are done in a very traditional manner and he focuses on a uniquely Tsimshian art style. Boxley originally borrowed heavily from different Pacific North West Coast styles, such as Haida and Tlingit, but in the mid 1980s, his style began to look more explicitly Tsimshian. He has described his style as “Alaskan Tsimshian”- specific to the Alaskan branch of the Tsimshian. For his Totem Poles, he uses old red cedar trees, as they are the trees that his Tsimshian ancestors were surrounded by. However, he has given up some traditional materials for modern ones. An example is using latex paint instead of traditional Tsimshian pigments, such as copper oxide and charcoal mixed with salmon eggs and urine. Despite this, Boxley stresses the importance of keeping everything as traditional and authentic as possible.  Revival of Tsimshian culture  Since the 1980s, Boxley has also contributed to the revival of Tsimshian culture as a whole, and his work in this regard has been praised by Tsimshian communities. As a result of his efforts, he was given the title of “culture bearer” by his Tsimshian tribe. He has stated that this title is the greatest honour he has received. His work has also been praised by others outside of the Tsimshian community. Quintana Galleries in Portland said of Boxley: “Not all of the artists [in the museum] were reviving a culture, but he was”. Similarly, the director of the National Museum of the American Indian, Kevin Gover, stated: “David Boxley has been instrumental in revitalizing the cultural traditions of carving, song, and dance in his Tsimshian community”. One of Boxley’s revival efforts was restarting the “Potlatch”, a traditional ceremony practiced by indigenous groups in the Pacific North West Coast of the U.S and Canada. In 1982, Boxley lead the first Potlatch in Metlakatla in over a century, also making songs and dances for the event as well as raising a Totem Pole he made. He has since lead other Potlatches across the Pacific Northwest. Another of Boxley’s contributions is the starting and leading of traditional Tsimshian dance groups. The most notable of these is the “Git-Hoan”, meaning “People of the Salmon”, currently lead by Boxley’s son David. The group has performed across the United States, Canada and Europe, to wide success and acclaim. The Git- Hoan combines traditional Tsimshian song, language and dance, along with masks, costumes and instruments made by Boxley. Boxley is also concerned with authenticity in the Git-Hoan performances, having researched song style, dances, costumes and ornaments using primary material such as a 1913 silent film and a wax audio reel. All of these authentic traditions are therefore showcased to an international audience. The Git Hoan dancers did multiple performances at the Disney Epcot Center, as part of the dedication ceremony for the two poles he raised there in 2017. These performances have been praised for bringing authenticity to the park and showcasing true Native American culture to audiences. It has been one of the few genuine Native American performances at the park since its creation. Boxley is also concerned with the preservation of the Tsimshian language, which has only approximately 70 speakers left in Alaska. He has also played a role regarding this; with he and his son David being involved in Tsimshian language classes. In addition to this, both Boxleys write songs for their Git-Hoan dance group using the traditional Tsimsian language. They consciously do this to expose people to the language. Due to his efforts, Metlakatla has had a strong revival in traditional culture, and younger generations of the Tsimshian tribe have had the chance to be surrounded by traditional Tsimshian culture.

He says that after every goal he scores, he says a prayer for his grandfather. Chacana began to play football in his neighborhood and local tournaments. He was scared at first about playing actual club football though because he did not have enough money for shoes. =Playing career=  Start in Argentina  At the age of 16, Chacana began training with Club Atlético San Martín de Tucumán after being pressured to by his grandfather. The club supplied Chacana with a pair of football boots and occasionally with transportation to training. In 1997, he played his first professional match for San Martín in a Primera B Nacional match. Slowly, he cracked the first team and started to score goals. During a league match against Club Atlético Tucumán, officials from River Plate were impressed by his play. The next day Chacana found himself on a bus to Buenos Aires. The players at River Plate gave him the nickname, \\"El Burrito de Tucumán\\" because of the resemblance between him and Ariel Ortega. Because Chacana entered though in midseason, he could only take part in Copa Libertadores matches. At the end of the season, Ramón Díaz was appointed manager and Chacana left for Quilmes. Kuwait After a short time at Quilmes, Chacana made his first departure to the Middle East. His time at Al Arabi was cut short due to the Iraq War. Israel In 2003, he arrived at Liga Artzit side Hapoel Nazareth Illit. Club officials told him that since his wife, Priscila Radusky, is Jewish, he would receive special benefits as a new immigrant under the Law of Return. Originally, Chacana was not interested in immigrating, but was later convinced. After just one season, he was released by Nazareth Illit. He returned to San Martín de Tucumán but felt that he needed to return to Israel in order to prove people wrong. Israeli agent, Gilad Katsav, arranged for him to join Hapoel Ashkelon where he became an instant success and fan favorite. He was given a new nickname in Ashkelon, \\"El Loco Lindo\\" and achieved celebrity in the city. During his season at Ashkelon, the club reached the semi-final of the Israel State Cup and gained promotion to the Liga Leumit After a short term at Hapoel Kfar Saba, Chacana left for Ironi Kiryat Shmona. When the season ended, Chacana signed a US $50,000 contract with Hapoel Ramat Gan of the Liga Leumit, despite having an offer from F.C. Ashdod in the Israeli Premier League. The primary reason for Chacana's signing with Ramat Gan, was because a fan of the club was willing to pay for the entire treatment of his sons bout with leukemia. When his contract ended with Hapoel Ramat Gan, he had an unsuccessful trial with Maccabi Petah Tikva. Though having more offers from Israeli clubs, Chacana signed a new one-year deal with Slovenian side, NK MIK CM Celje. During his debut match against NK Maribor, he scored his team's second goal in a 3:3 draw. His family remained in Israel though, where his son underwent further treatments at Sheba Medical Center.

His grand manner subjects often included Greco-Roman allusions or themes. Biography Born in San Sebastiano Curone near Alessandria, he moved to Pavia. In Pavia, he studied with Carlo Bianchi and Antonio Galli Bibiena. He moved to Bologna, in 1778, where he entered the studio of Domenico Pedrini and Ubaldo Gandolfi. He soon moved to Rome and found work in the decoration of the Palazzo Altieri. Between 1780 and 1786, he worked in various studios in Rome, under, for example, Pompeo Batoni and Christoph Unterberger.

In Bologna, he decorated the Palazzi Aldini, Marescalchi, Lambertini Ranuzzi, and Baciocchi. In Rome, he worked in the palace of the Embassy of Spain, Palazzo Quirinale, and he also did work in Forlì, Ferrara, Ravenna and Venice. He befriended the Napoleonic French leaders, and traveled to Paris where he painted frescos in the villa of the Secretary of State of the Kingdom of Italy.

Though not much is publicly available on the dealings of the organization, with exception to internal information shown in a leaked manual published in 2013, members often cite the provision of political, professional and financial support of FSU community leaders and efforts that strengthen the university's public standing. Its membership consists of student leaders from various factions of campus, included but not limited to: SGA, Seminole Student Boosters,Student Foundation and the Interfraternity and Panhellenic councils. In its relatively young 30-year history, Burning Spear has become one of the most secretive and influential collegiate secret societies in America.  History  Burning Spear was founded on July 14, 1993 by three students.http://www.fsunews.com/story/news/2017/02/27/lets-take-look-burning- spear-florida-state-secret-society/98488520/ Perhaps the most notable of its three founders is famed civil rights lawyer Benjamin Crump, who has been involved in some of the most notable cases of the 21st century. By August 1993, sixteen students joined together to charter this new organization, and within one year's time seven additional students would be initiated into membership. The original intention of the group was to promote the Heisman campaign for Charlie Ward, which was successful. This newfound influence led to expansion of Burning Spears' goals. Events Derrick Brooks Burning Spear serves as the host of the Clock & Seal annual homecoming banquet at FSU. Former keynote speakers of Clock & Seal include: * Florida Trend publisher Lynda Keever * Florida Supreme Court Justice Raoul Cantero * Former Florida Senate President and current Florida State University President John Thrasher * United States Senator Bill Nelson * Governor Charlie Crist * Seminole Boosters Director Charlie Barnes * NFL All-Pro Derrick Brooks * Representative Ray Sansom * NFL All-Pro Marvin Jones * Football Coach Jimbo Fisher Burning Spear also sponsors the Seminole Spirit Drum, which beats nonstop outside of Doak Campbell Stadium for 72 hours prior to a football game against a major rival. The organization is also responsible for the Guardian of the Flame Awards, recognizing faculty member excellence annually. Most recently the society has coordinated with FSU Head Football Coach Jimbo Fisher's Kidz 1st Fund. Controversies Charlie Crist Burning Spear has claimed existence for only twenty-six years, but there are dissenting opinions that say the society has operated in one form or another for a much longer time. Their control of campus and state politics has been compared to The Machine at the University of Alabama and the Skull and Bones society of Yale University. There are a large number of Burning Spear alumni from Florida State now in the legislature and the organization is also said to control a political action committee that gives campaign contributions to candidates that attended Florida State. Multiple Student Government Association Political Party leaders have also openly claimed affiliation, including several elected Student Body Presidents.

Other instructional resources of which she was principal author are \\"Phonemic Awareness in Young Children\\" (1997) for emergent and remedial reading students, CTB/McGraw-Hill's \\"Fox in a Box,\\" an award-winning, standards-based literacy assessment kit, and \\"Odyssey: A Curriculum for Thinking,\\" a research- validated program on thinking skills originally developed for the Republic of Venezuela. Adams has served as Literacy Advisor for \\"Sesame Street\\" and has been Senior Advisor for Instruction for PBS's \\"Between the Lions\\" since its inception. She is currently a Visiting Professor in the Cognitive and Linguistic Sciences Department at Brown University and Chief Scientist at Soliloquy Learning, a software company which she co-founded in 2000 to use automated speech recognition to support learning to read. The firm's software is called the Soliloquy Reading Assistant. The Reading Assistant software was acquired by Scientific Learning in 2008. In 2013, :http://products.brookespublishing.com/ABC-Foundations-for-Young- Children-P637.aspx she published what is probably her best-known book, ABC Foundations For Young Children, in which she presented evidence proof that most American children finishing first-grade still can't name and write all of the alphabet letters.

Although the name would suggest room boxes generally only represent typical rooms such as those found in houses or other buildings (bedrooms, kitchens, offices, etc.), room boxes are used for all sorts of environments – exterior views as well as interior ones, realistic ones as well as fantastical ones. While some miniaturists concentrate their efforts specifically on room boxes, many use them to take a break from larger projects, such as dollhouses or miniature villages, to create a smaller environment on a different theme. A room box can be tailored to one’s interests or mirror an important step in life - for example, a bakery or restaurant scene might be created by or for a baker or cook, and a wedding dress storefront might be created for a bride to be or as a reminiscence of one's wedding. Making a room box is often a first step to learning new techniques in miniature making; such projects are popular at miniaturists' events where attendees have only 1–2 days to make and finish a project. Once techniques are perfected in these smaller settings, craftspersons and hobbyists often reapply them to larger projects. Room boxes are a cost- and time-effective way to make miniature settings without attempting larger setups such as a dollhouse or train set. Commercially bought room boxes tend to be made of wood, pressed wood products or plywood, with the top and front window made of removable clear acrylic that lets in light and enables access and viewing from two perspectives. Dimensions usually meet standard dollhouse proportions (\\"1:12 scale\\" in dollhouse speak means that 1\\" in the dollhouse world represents 1' in the real world), but anyone can make a room box from a leftover shoebox, orange crate, etc. and adapt an idea to suit the box's scale. Since any material can be used, whether leftover or new, people of all economic classes express themselves through this craft. One elaborate example of 1:12 scale miniature rooms are the 68 miniature Thorne Rooms, each with a different theme, were designed by Narcissa Niblack Thorne and furniture for them was created by craftsmen in the 1930s and 1940s. They are now at the Art Institute of Chicago, Phoenix Art Museum.Thorne Miniature Rooms - The Art Institute of Chicago As evidenced in the recent increase in craft book and magazine publishing on different types of miniatures, interest in making room- boxes for miniature settings has steadily grown since the 1990s. Room boxes have even found a place during prime-time television: the winter 2007 season of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation included a clever storyline recurring throughout the season, where a murderer named The Miniature Killer leaves clues for investigators in the form of intricately made 3-D room boxes showing scenes of the crimes she committed, reproduced in scale miniature.

Its teleomorph is Filobasidiella bacillispora, a filamentous fungus belonging to the class Tremellomycetes. C. gattii causes the human diseases of pulmonary cryptococcosis (lung infection), basal meningitis, and cerebral cryptococcomas. Occasionally, the fungus is associated with skin, soft tissue, lymph node, bone, and joint infections. In recent years, it has appeared in British Columbia, Canada and the Pacific Northwest. It has been suggested that global warming may have been a factor in its emergence in British Columbia. It has also been suggested that tsunamis, such as the 1964 Alaska earthquake and tsunami, might have been responsible for carrying the fungus to North America and its subsequent spread there. From 1999 through to early 2008, 216 people in British Columbia have been infected with C. gattii, and eight died from complications related to it. The fungus also infects animals, such as dogs, koalas, and dolphins. In 2007, the fungus appeared for the first time in the United States, in Whatcom County, WashingtonRare, deadly tropical fungus moves into Whatcom County  KOMO-TV - Seattle, Washington  Local & Regional and in April 2010 had spread to Oregon. The most recently identified strain, designated VGIIc, is particularly virulent, having proved fatal in 19 of 218 known cases. Nomenclature C. gattii has recently been divided into five species. These are C. gattii, C. bacillisporus, C. deuterogattii, C. tetragattii, and C. decagattii.  Disease summary  Cryptococcal disease is a very rare disease that can affect the lungs (pneumonia) and nervous system (causing meningitis and focal brain lesions called cryptococcomas) in humans. The main complication of lung infection is respiratory failure. Central nervous system infection may lead to hydrocephalus, seizures, and focal neurological deficit.  Environmental occurrence  Soil debris associated with certain tree species has been found frequently to contain C. gattii VGIII MATα and MATa, and less commonly VGI MATα, in Southern California. These isolates were fertile, were found to be indistinguishable from the human isolates by genome sequence, and were virulent in in vitro and animal tests. Isolates were found associated with Canary Island pine (Pinus canariensis), American sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), and Pohutukawa tree (Metrosideros excelsa). Leading up to the study one of the authors, Scott Filler, sent his daughter Elan to obtain and culture fungal samples in the greater Los Angeles area; one of these turned out to be C. gattii. Her work was presented at the Los Angeles County Science Fair, and she was credited as an author on the publication. Lead author Deborah Springer said, \\"Just as people who travel to South America are told to be careful about drinking the water, people who visit other areas like California, the Pacific Northwest, and Oregon need to be aware that they are at risk for developing a fungal infection, especially if their immune system is compromised.\\"  Epidemiology  The highest incidences of C. gattii infections occur in Papua New Guinea and Northern Australia. Cases have also been reported in other regions, indicating its spread to India, Brazil, Vancouver Island in Canada, and Washington, and Oregon in the United States. Unlike Cryptococcus neoformans, C. gattii is not particularly associated with human immunodeficiency virus infection or other forms of immunosuppression. The fungus can cause disease in healthy people, potentially due to its ability to grow extremely rapidly within white blood cells. In the United States, C. gattii serotype B, subtype VGIIa, is largely responsible for clinical cases. The VGIIa subtype was responsible for the outbreaks in Canada; it then appeared in the U.S. Pacific Northwest. According to a CDC summary, from 2004 to 2010, 60 cases were identified in the U.S.: 43 in Oregon, 15 from Washington, and one each from Idaho and California. Slightly more than half of these case were immunocompromised; 92% of all isolates were of the VGIIa subtype. In 2007, the first case in North Carolina was reported, subtype VGI, which is identical to the isolates found in Australia and California. In 2009, one case was identified in Arkansas. The multiple clonal clusters in the Pacific Northwest likely arose independently of each other as a result of sexual reproduction occurring within the highly sexual VGII population.Billmyre RB, Croll D, Li W, Mieczkowski P, Carter DA, Cuomo CA, Kronstad JW, Heitman J. Highly recombinant VGII Cryptococcus gattii population develops clonal outbreak clusters through both sexual macroevolution and asexual microevolution. MBio. 2014 Jul 29;5(4):e01494-14. doi: 10.1128/mBio.01494-14. PMID: 25073643 VGII C. gattii have probably undergone either bisexual or unisexual reproduction in multiple different locales, thus giving rise to novel virulent phenotypes.  Transmission  The infection is caused by inhaling yeasts or spores. The fungus is not transmitted from person to person or from animal to person. A person with cryptococcal disease is not contagious. Symptoms Most people who are exposed to the fungus do not become ill. In people who become ill, symptoms appear many weeks to months after exposure. Symptoms of cryptococcal disease include: * Prolonged cough (lasting weeks or months) * Sputum production * Sharp chest pain * Shortness of breath * Sinusitis (cottony drainage, soreness, pressure) * Severe headache (meningitis, encephalitis, meningoencephalitis) * Stiff neck (prolonged and severe nuchal rigidity) * Muscle soreness (mild to severe, local or diffuse) * Photophobia (excessive sensitivity to light) * Blurred or double vision * Eye irritation (soreness, redness) * Focal neurological deficit * Fever (delirium, hallucinations) * Confusion (abnormal behavior changes, inappropriate mood swings) * Seizures * Dizziness * Night sweats * Weight loss * Nausea (with or without vomiting) * Skin lesions (rashes, scaling, plaques, papules, nodules, blisters, subcutaneous tumors or ulcers) * Lethargy * Apathy Diagnosis Culture of sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage, lung biopsy, cerebrospinal fluid or brain biopsy specimens on selective agar allows differentiation between the five members of the C. gattii species complex and the two members of the C. neoformans species complex. Molecular techniques may be used to speciate Cryptococcus from specimens that fail to culture. Cryptococcal antigen testing from serum or cerebrospinal fluid is a useful preliminary test for cryptococcal infection, and has high sensitivity for disease. It does not distinguish between different species of Cryptococcus. Treatment Medical treatment consists of prolonged intravenous therapy (for 6–8 weeks or longer) with the antifungal drug amphotericin B, either in its conventional or lipid formulation. The addition of oral or intravenous flucytosine improves response rates. Oral fluconazole is then administered for six months or more. Antifungals alone are often insufficient to cure C. gattii infections, and surgery to resect infected lung (lobectomy) or brain is often required. Ventricular shunts and Ommaya reservoirs are sometimes employed in the treatment of central nervous system infection. People who have C. gattii infection need to take prescription antifungal medication for at least 6 months; usually the type of treatment depends on the severity of the infection and the parts of the body that are affected. *For people who have asymptomatic infections or mild-to-moderate pulmonary infections, the treatment is usually fluconazole. *For people who have severe lung infections, or infections in the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord), the treatment is amphotericin B in combination with flucytosine.

He was inducted into the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame and the National Crew Hall of Fame, and he is regarded as one of the most powerful strokes to ever sit in a shell. Life While just a toddler, Holtz was abandoned by his father. Finances were such that Carl would have to take a job with the local Sears Roebuck store, a position he held for two years until he had saved up enough money to afford collegiate tuition. Carl enrolled in the College of Agriculture at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. One of his most influential professors was the famed Aldo Leopold, who passed along a deep appreciation for the land and a sense of conservationism. Athletics, sports, and activities were very important to Carl, as he felt he always had to be active or doing something. On a whim, he joined the Badger football team as a freshman, and remained on the Freshman/Junior Varsity team for the year (in those days, football programs had dedicated lower-level teams beneath Varsity, and \\"redshirting\\" was not yet existent). There, he encountered the likes of All-American Pat Harder, who he befriended and who... Holtz enlisted in the United States Army Air Force late in 1942 and was sent off for training in Kansas and Texas. He was given the class-nickname of \\"Tarzan\\". He was cross-trained, and received both a navigator's badge and a bombardier's badge. He flew many bombing missions over Germany. CHAMPION OARSMAN He was unsurpassed as a stroke in University of Wisconsin rowing. He led his crew of 8 - some of whom were to become his friends for life - to win the prestigious Eastern Sprints in 1946, the same year he was named All-American. In 1948 Holtz followed his rowing coach, Allen Walz, to Yale, where he coached the freshman crew. Joint-owner in a Connecticut blueberry farm, he decided to move back home to Wisconsin to look for a larger farm on which to raise his growing family. In 1957 Holtz purchased a dilapidated farm just outside Mukwonago, Wisconsin known as Mayflower Farm, a misnomer for the wild Pasque flowers that grow on its prairies. To supplement income for his family, Holtz took up a job as a Rural Letter Carrier in the area, servicing the villages and towns of Mukwonago, Vernon, Caldwell, and North Prairie. Death Carl Holtz died, quietly, from complications due to Alzheimer's disease early in the morning of July 8, 2006. He had been diagnosed with the disease approximately three years earlier. Notables * On June 7, a week prior to the June 13, 1948 \\"25th Anniversary of the Opening of Yankee Stadium\\" celebration the New York Yankees hosted, Babe Ruth visited Yale to present his autobiographical manuscript to the Yale baseball team. A parade was improvised, and Holtz was quickly approached to lend his grey Chevrolet convertible to transport Ruth down the parade route. Holtz owned the only convertible in New Haven, and thus drove the \\"Sultan of Swat\\" around the campus and presented him for the dedication ceremony. At the field, team captain George H. W.

It is closely related to the game of rounders. In the tradition of bat-and-ball games, Baseball has roots going back centuries, and there are references to \\"baseball\\" from the beginning of the eighteenth century, and \\"rounders\\" from 1828. Baseball emerged as a distinct sport in 1892 when associations in Wales and England renamed the sport in favour of the more traditional rounders.  History  Bat-and-ball games in Britain have a long history and a game called “base ball\\" was attested in 1700 when a vicar in Maidstone decried its playing on a Sunday. Jane Austen also included a passing reference to the game in Northanger Abbey. = Development and Foundation (1880s to 1892)= American professional baseball teams toured Britain in 1874 and 1889, and had a great effect on similar sports in Britain. In Wales and Merseyside, a strong community game had already developed with skills and plays more in keeping with the American game and the Welsh began to informally adopt the name \\"baseball\\" (Pêl Fas), to reflect the American style. By the 1890s, calls were made to follow the success of other working class sports (like Rugby in Wales and Soccer in Merseyside) and adopt a distinct set of rules and bureaucracy. During the 1892 season rules for the game of \\"baseball\\" were agreed and the game was officially codified. This was followed by the 'Liverpool Rounders Association' and the 'South Wales Rounders Association' renaming themselves for \\"Baseball\\" and by the end of the season, baseball teams from Liverpool and Lancashire were invited to play matches at Cardiff Arms Park with the express purpose of popularising \\"the improved version of the old-fashioned game of rounders\\". = Edwardian boom and first internationals (1892 to 1918)= The growth and popularity of the early game saw the first approach from American baseball to amalgamate the sports but no agreement was reached. As the number of amateur clubs expanded in Cardiff, Newport and Merseyside a Wales-England fixture was proposed to promote the sport further. The inaugural international match was held on 3 August 1908 at the Harlequins Ground in Roath, Cardiff (St Peter's RFC). Wales won the match 122–118 with batsmen and captain Lew Lewis hitting a number of balls 'over the house tops'. The game in Cardiff had already become a popular summer pursuit among the city's rugby players and the match saw three Cardiff RFC players take the field, including Viv Huzzey, who also represented Wales in rugby union and rugby league. The next international was held in 1914 at Goodison Park, Liverpool. The English won the match in front of 4,000 spectators, but annual internationals would not start until after the war. =Cultural impact and women's games (1918 to 1929)= Ticket for a match \\"In Welsh and American style\\" at Cardiff Arms Park In 1905 the South Wales and Monmouthshire Baseball Association had just fifteen member clubs, by 1921 the game had become ubiquitous in its heartland cities, with the newly renamed Welsh Baseball Union comprising sixty clubs, all within the Cardiff and Newport areas. The game continued to gain popularity during the interwar period and was an \\"integral part of local culture\\" in Cardiff and Newport. Schoolboy leagues were established, and Cardiff saw the first schoolgirls league. Welsh baseball was notable for its female participation which began during the First World War among the young women working in factories. A women's league was set up in Cardiff in 1922 and in 1926 the first women's international match took place between Wales and England. The crowd at the 1924 Cardiff Arms Park men's international reached 10,000 spectators for the first time and the 1925 fixture at the Police Athletic Ground, Liverpool, saw a crowd of 12,000. The growth of the international fixture had brought increased scrutiny on the game's arbitration and rules, as such the English Baseball Association and the Welsh Baseball Union formed the International Baseball Board to oversee the internationals in 1927. =Depression, war and the American game (1929 to 1948)= The Great Depression saw further increases in the number of clubs and players, and local club matches would attract thousands of spectators as community sports provided a welcome distraction during a turbulent period. The Cardiff & District League boasted 37 teams by 1929, 19 of which were based in the working class areas of Splott and Grangetown alone. The 1930s saw American baseball's popularity peak in Britain with professional teams sharing grounds with soccer clubs (10,000 spectators attending the biggest games), and saw the British team winning the inaugural Baseball World Cup in 1938. The American game was supported by more touring teams from America and Japan; this afforded the Welsh teams a chance to test themselves against the more widely appreciated (and often professional) American teams. In one such game on August 27, 1938, the Penylan club side beat the London Americans at Cardiff Arms Park. The contest saw one innings under \\"Welsh\\" rules, and three innings under U.S. rules. The decade also saw further moves to establish American baseball on Merseyside. The moves met with a mixed reception among players of the British game with some apprehensive the move would end the older game in England. Although British baseball would survive, the American league had a detrimental effect throughout the decade, with players, crowds and backers leaving the sport for a professional career in a game gaining support throughout England. An American league was also established in Cardiff in 1939, but the professional American game ended with the outbreak of war, and would never regain such widespread popularity. =Post War zenith (1948 to 1970)= Although internationals ceased during wartime, sides would stage successful games with the crews of American warships using either American or Welsh rules. Home victories emboldened the local's belief in the ability of the Welsh players. This pride and belief was evident when the annual internationals resumed in 1948 at Cardiff's Castle Grounds, with a record 16,000 spectators in attendance and Welsh legend Ted Peterson leading Wales to victory. This increasing popularity of the game saw it develop a distinct community appeal. In addition to the now established clubs, churches, stores, factories, and bars would form teams, and the game became the heart of social activities for many, especially in Cardiff. The sport was also enjoying popularity In England, with a number of Exhibition games played in London and teams established in Bristol and Coventry. The 1950s and 1960s saw more dominance for the Welsh game. Welsh legend Paddy Hennessey made his international debut in the 1957 win over England. He would go on to be widely recognised as a great of the game, and the fastest bowler of the era. The 1964 International saw Hennessey (as captain) demolish his rivals' batting line up for a record six runs in 30 balls and just nine minutes in front of a crowd of 6,000 at the Maindy Stadium. This record is notable as it would not be surpassed for 50 years, when Wales international Matthew Hopkins managed the same feat for the loss of just one run in the 2014 fixture at Whiteheads Ground, Newport. The record remains one of the longest standing in global sports. =Decline in popularity (1970 to 2000)= The sport gained a new audience as live coverage of the international fixture and some club matches became a feature of Welsh television in the 1970s and 1980s, but the last decades of the century were generally characterised by a continued decline in attendances and participation. The international fixture continued to draw interest with BBC Cymru Wales broadcast highlights of the international game until the 1990s; by then the match was seen as a curiosity with radio and TV features the limit of its national exposure. The prospect of watching Wales' star rugby players play the game also ended in 1995 with the introduction of professional contracts, ceasing their unsanctioned participation in other sports. = Modern era= By 2006 participation levels in England had slumped considerably to a point where only four clubs remained active: All Saints, Anfield, Breckside and Townsend. The centenary international was held in Cardiff on 19 July 2008, with Wales winning their tenth victory in a row by an innings and 44. As well as the full international, similar internationals are held for 'B' teams and for junior grades. The match was the 83rd international played between the two nations, and was Wales' 61st victory; England had won 20 and two games were declared draws due to inclement weather (1957 and 1998). Spectator numbers were reported to be between 1,000–2,000. The annual England–Wales fixture continued until 2015 when England withdrew, unable to field enough players. The end of the international fixture (and the exposure it brought the game) had a dramatic effect on player numbers in Wales. By 2017, the Welsh men's league and cup fixtures were abandoned mid-season due to a lack of players at some member clubs. Since then the men's game has continued through ad-hoc fixtures. The women's league remains in operation. Subsequent years have seen the Welsh Baseball Union working with local councils to reintroduce the sport into high schools. This has seen the sport played beyond its traditional areas (especially the South Wales Valleys), as the game allows for mixed gender participation, is easy to understand, and can be adapted to accommodate a high number of players.  Notable players  Among those who achieved fame through their baseball exploits were Ted Peterson, whose international appearances stretched from the 1930s to 1960s, and Paddy Hennessey, renowned for his fast bowling. The sport's appeal to winter footballers attracted a number of players more notable for their rugby or soccer careers. Welsh Rugby players Viv Huzzey, Terry Holmes, Mark Ring, David Bishop,and Wigan Rugby League legend and record points scorer Jim Sullivan all played the sport, often during rugby's off season. Association footballers include Welshmen John Toshack, George Whitcombe, Terry Yorath, Nathan Blake and Phil Dwyer, and Everton and England football star Dixie Dean.  Differences between the British/Welsh and North American games  The sport differs in a number of ways from the internationally known game of North American baseball. * Delivery of the ball – The ball is thrown underarm, similar to softball. As in cricket the delivery is known as bowling. In North American baseball it is delivered overhand, sidearm, or underarm and is called pitching. * Number of players – There are 11 players in a team with no substitutions allowed. North American baseball uses nine players on a team (not counting a \\"designated hitter\\"); while substitutions are allowed, a player who leaves the game may not re-enter it. * Number of innings – (Note that British baseball uses the cricket terminology of \\"innings\\" as both singular and plural, while baseball uses \\"inning\\" for the singular.) In British baseball, each team has two innings. An innings ends when all 11 players are either dismissed or stranded on base. A regulation game of North American baseball consists of nine innings, and each team's half of an inning ends when three outs (dismissals) are recorded. * Posts/Bases – Where North American baseball has bases the British version has 'posts' (sometimes referred to as bases). These are designated by poles rather than bags. * Bat – the bat has a flat striking surface, where in North American baseball it is entirely round. * Scoring system – In British baseball a player scores a run for every base he/she reaches after hitting the ball. He or she will not subsequently score when moving around the bases on another player's hit. The equivalent of a home run scores four runs. As in cricket a bonus run can be awarded for excessively-wide deliveries. In North American baseball, a player scores a run only on a successful circuit of all four bases, whether on his own or another player's hit, or by other means such as a walk or stolen base. * Uniform – Players wear colourful jerseys and shorts with Welsh teams often wearing rugby kits and English teams wearing soccer uniforms. * Field of play – The British game has no foul area, a ball can be legally hit (and scored off of) in any direction, where in North American baseball it has to be hit in the zone bounded by the lines to first base and third base. Despite these similarities with cricket, the game is much more like North American baseball in style and operates on a near identical, but smaller, diamond. There are also many similarities to rounders, which is often considered a transitional game between cricket and baseball. The basic concepts of British baseball cross-blend the basic concepts of cricket and the more standard versions of rounders.  In popular culture  The sport is the subject of a song, \\"The Baseball Song\\", by The Hennessys, from their album Cardiff After Dark.

Aaron Clark (October 16, 1787 – August 2, 1861) was an American politician who became the second popularly elected Mayor of New York, serving two one-year terms from 1837 to 1839. He was a member of the Whig Party. Early life Clark was born in Worthington, Massachusetts. He grew up in Pawlet, Vermont, attended Union College in Schenectady, New York, and fought in the War of 1812. Political career After the war, Clark moved to Albany, New York, and was Clerk of the New York State Assembly from 1814 to 1820. Afterwards he removed to New York City where he worked in banking, ran a lottery, and became involved in local politics. He served as alderman, a powerful position in the charged political climate of the city. He was elected mayor in 1837 and 1838 for one year terms, and was defeated in 1839. =Election of 1837= The main event of that year was the financial Panic of 1837, in which the economy collapsed following several years of boom. New York real estate values plummeted. Many were unemployed, some were homeless. There was widespread dissatisfaction among the working and middle class residents during what were called the \\"hard times\\". To relieve the plight of the people, Alderman Clark focused on reviving the economy. Following his party's program of internal improvements, he proposed that shipping piers be built at public expense around the waterfront so as to stimulate trade and create jobs. An incautious statement that his proposal would \\"raise the price of every lot 5 x 100 feet west of Broadway $5,000 at a jump.\\"Documents of the Board of Aldermen, 1836, #80, as cited in Myers, Ch. XII fit in with the perception by many Democrats that the Whigs were the \\"party of the rich\\", and the Democrats pushed instead for \\"poor relief\\" (direct handouts). 1837 also saw the rise of the \\"Equal Rights Party\\", which came to be known as the Locofocos. The Locofocos split from the Democrats in 1835, and opposed both internal improvements and poor relief. They stood instead for laissez-faire, against monopoly, and against the consolidation of money and power. In 1837 the Locofocos fielded Moses Jacques, Tammany Hall Democrats nominated John J. Morgan, and Clark was the Whig candidate. The fledgling faction was popular enough to split the Democratic vote, propelling the Whigs to victory in both the mayoral and city council races. The vote tallies were 16,140 for Clark, 12,974 for Morgan, and 3,911 for Jacques. The election led to much soul-searching in Tammany Hall, and forced the main Democratic faction to take the Locofocos' concerns seriously. =Election of 1838= After Clark's first term, the privations of the hard times combined with the perception that the policies of the Whig administration favored the rich made Clark profoundly unpopular among a part of the poorer majority. In 1838, the newly reconciled Democrats fielded Tammany Hall leader Isaac Varian. Nevertheless, they were not successful in unseating Clark: Varian received 19,411 votes to Clark's 19,930, a difference of only 1.3%. It may be (and was widely believed at the time) that the Whigs resorted to massive fraud in securing the election. In 1838 there was no voter registration law, and the elections were administered by Whig-appointed officials. Allegations included violent intimidation, multiple voting in different precincts, importation of \\"voters\\" from other jurisdictions, and other improprieties. =Election of 1839= 1839 saw a Varian-Clark rematch, with massive electoral fraud being perpetrated this time by both parties. Varian won with 21,072 votes to Clark's 20,005. Following the election, a widespread outcry resulted in the passage of a voter registration bill during Varian's first term. The bill regularized electoral procedure in the city and served to decrease the incidence of fraud in future elections. Later life As mayor, Clark lived on Broadway near Leonard Street, a few short blocks north of the New York City Hall. There he attempted to gain the favor of society by giving frequent balls, which earned him the nickname \\"Dancing Mayor\\".New York's Great Industries: Exchange and Commercial Review, p. 62, Historical Publishing Company, New York (1885) (available from Google Books) After ending his political career, Clark returned to business and became a patron of Hamilton College, which still awards an annual prized for oratory named in his honor. Clark endowed the prize with a gift in 1859, shortly before his death.The Clark Prize homepage at Hamilton College Personal Clark married Catherine Maria Lamb in 1815. With her he had six children, five of whom lived past childhood. Catherine died in 1832, and Clark never remarried. He died in Brooklyn, New York on August 2, 1861.Obituary, The New York Times, August 4, 1861, at 8 Both he and his wife are buried in the Clark family crypt at the New York Marble Cemetery on Manhattan's Lower East Side.

Overview The science of scotobiology gathers together under a single descriptive heading a wide range of approaches to the study of the biology of darkness. This includes work on the effects of darkness on the behavior and metabolism of animals, plants, and microbes. Some of this work has been going on for over a century, and lays the foundation for understanding the importance of dark night skies, not only for humans but for all biological species. The great majority of biological systems have evolved in a world of alternating day and night and have become irrevocably adapted to and dependent on the daily and seasonally changing patterns of light and darkness. Light is essential for many biological activities such as sight and photosynthesis. These are the focus of the science of photobiology. But the presence of uninterrupted periods of darkness, as well as their alternation with light, is just as important to biological behaviour. Scotobiology studies the positive responses of biological systems to the presence of darkness, and not merely the negative effects caused by the absence of light. Effects of darkness Many of the biological and behavioural activities of plants, animals (including birds and amphibians), insects, and microorganisms are either adversely affected by light pollution at night or can only function effectively either during or as the consequence of nightly darkness. Such activities include foraging, breeding and social behavior in higher animals, amphibians, and insects, which are all affected in various ways if light pollution occurs in their environment. These are not merely photobiological phenomena; light pollution acts by interrupting critical dark-requiring processes. But perhaps the most important scotobiological phenomena relate to the regular periodic alternation of light and darkness. These include breeding behavior in a range of animals, the control of flowering and the induction of winter dormancy in many plants, and the operational control of the human immune system. In many of these biological processes the critical point is the length of the dark period rather than that of the light. For example, \\"short- day\\" and \\"long-day\\" plants are, in fact, \\"long-night\\" and \\"short-night\\" respectively. That is to say, plants do not measure the length of the light period, but of the dark period.Bidwell, R.G.S. 1979. Plant Physiology, MacMillan Publishing Co., Inc., New York. One consequence of artificial light pollution \\"Ecological Consequences of Artificial Night Lighting\\", edited by Catherine Rich and Travis Longcore, Published by Island Press, 2006, 458pp, . is that even brief periods of relatively bright light during the night may prevent plants or animals (including humans) from measuring the length of the dark period, and therefore from behaving in a normal or required manner. This is a critical aspect of scotobiology, and one of the major areas in the study of the responses of biological systems to darkness. In discussing scotobiology, it is important to remember that darkness (the absence of light) is seldom absolute. An important aspect of any scotobiological phenomenon is the level and quality (wavelength) of light that is below the threshold of detection for that phenomenon and in any specific organism. This important variable in scotobiological studies is not always properly noted or examined. There are substantial levels of natural light pollution at night, of which moonlight is usually the strongest. For example, plants that rely on night length to program their behaviour have the capacity to ignore full moonlight during an otherwise dark night. If this ability had not evolved, plants would not be able to respond to changing night-length for such behavioural programs as the initiation of flowering and the onset of dormancy. On the other hand, some animal behavioural patterns are strongly responsive to moonlight. It is thus most important in any scotobiological study to determine the threshold level of light that may be required to interfere with or negate the normal pattern of dark-night activity. Etymology In 2003, at a symposium on the Ecology of the Night held in Muskoka, Canada, discussion centered around the many effects of night-time light pollution on the biology of a wide range of organisms, but it went far beyond this in describing darkness as a biological imperative for the functioning of biological systems.The Ecology of the Night. An International Symposium: Darkness as a Biological Imperative. Muskoka, Canada, 22–24 September 2003; Chair, Peter L.E. Goering. Proceedings are available online at www.muskokaheritage.org/ecology-night/ Presentations focused on the absolute requirement of darkness for many aspects of normal behaviour and metabolism of many organisms and for the normal progression of their life cycles. Because there was no suitable term to describe the Symposium's main focus, the term scotobiology was introduced. The word is derived from the Greek scotos, σκότος, \\"dark,\\" and relates to photobiology, which describes the biological effects of light (φῶς, phos; root: φωτ-, phot-). The term scotobiology appears not to have been used previously, although related terms such as skototropismStrong, D.R. and Ray, T.S. (1975). Science 190, #4216, pp 804-806. and scotophyleWork of E.

The main campus is in Benton Township, Michigan with regional campuses in Niles and South Haven. The Welch Center for Wine & Viticulture opened on the main campus in 2019. History Lake Michigan College was founded as Benton Harbor Junior College in 1946MCCAA - Lake Michigan College CityTownInfo - Lake Michigan College within the city of Benton Harbor when voters approved an initiative to create a junior college. In 1954, Benton Harbor Junior College was redesigned into the Benton Harbor Community College and Technical Institute (CCTI). In 1963, a vote in Berrien County was held and affirmed to plan to create a county college district. A tax of up to one mill was approved for operation and building needs and a six-person board of trustees was established as the governing body of the college. CCTI was renamed again in 1964 to Lake Michigan College. Construction on the Napier Avenue Campus, which is now the main campus, began in 1965 when the board of trustees approved the purchase of a parcel of land in Benton Township. Campuses The college operates between three campuses: the main campus, located off Napier Avenue in Benton Harbor, the Niles Campus at Bertrand Crossing, and the South Haven campus. Classes are also offered at several off-campus locations and online. While primarily a commuter campus throughout its history, LMC began construction of the college's first on-campus residence hall, Beckwith Hall, at the Napier Avenue campus in the summer of 2013 and was occupied by its first residents in the fall of 2014.Lake Michigan College - Campus Explorer A Siena Heights University satellite campus Siena Heights University Locations is housed at the Benton Harbor campus, although Western Michigan University has transferred ownership of the building which housed its Southwest extension over to Lake Michigan College; this building is now known as the Todd Center, and houses the Business, Computer Science and Education departments as of Fall 2018. The South Haven campus was completed in 2003 after South Haven School District residents voted to join the Lake Michigan College district, the M-TEC training facility was completed in 2000 and the Bertrand Crossing campus in 1998.Lake Michigan College History After a proposed millage failed, the board of trustees put the M-TEC facility up for sale in 2008.Lake Michigan College to cut mfg. programs In January 2015, Lake Michigan College sold the 44,000 square foot M-TEC building to the Whirlpool Corporation. Programs previously housed at the M-TEC facility were relocated to the Hanson Technology Center, which opened to the public at Lake Michigan College’s Napier Avenue Campus in the fall of 2016. The campus consolidations should save Lake Michigan College money through operational efficiencies. Athletics Lake Michigan College is a member of the NJCAA Region 12NJCAA Region 12 - Lake Michigan College Profile and the MCCAA Western Division. The college's athletic teams were known as the \\"Indians\\" from 1946 until 2012, representing the school's historic connection to the Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians of Southwest Michigan. In February 2012, after several college staff and student meetings with the Pokagon Tribal Council, it was announced that the school would adopt a new team nickname in an effort put forward by student leaders to increase school spirit and mascot visibility while still honoring the historical connection to the Pokagon. On April 24, 2012, the college officially announced \\"Red Hawks\\" as its new team name for all sports, inspired by the red-tailed hawk which appears on the flag of the Pokagon Nation.Lake Michigan College Changes Mascot and Logo Former Women's Basketball Head Coach, Jason Cooper, led the LMC Women's Basketball team for ten years, compiling a 247-71 win-loss record, including six visits to the NJCAA National Tournament in eight years. The team finished the 2011-2012 season as the #2 ranked team in the country.Athletics - Women's Basketball The LMC women are eighth in total NJCAA appearances, the most of any MCCAA team. The men's basketball team placed 7th in the nation in 2005, and Doug Schaffer, former Athletic Director and Men's Basketball Head Coach, was named Michigan Community College Athletic Association Athletic Director of the Year for 2005. Lake Michigan College also has baseball, softball, volleyball, and men's and women's soccer teams as well as club sports. Former Detroit Tigers pitcher Duane Below pitched for the baseball team in 2005-06. The Lake Michigan College Cheer Team has performed consistently well in Universal Cheerleading Association events, earning numerous awards, most recently two consecutive Leadership Awards in 2012 and 2013. LMC's mascot, Rocky the Red Hawk, has become a popular part of all sporting events and college activities since his debut in 2012.

The show featured amateur acts lip- synching to popular songs. The show aired on weekends from 1984 to 1988.The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows 1946-Present. Ballantine Books. 2003. pg. 970. The show's title is a reference (and spoof) to Irving Berlin's 1929 song & Taco's 1983 cover Puttin' on the Ritz. Description The show grew out of lip synching contests developed by William \\"Randy\\" Wood, who by 1982 had realized that his contests had grown so popular nationally that he needed to stage them on a broader scale. The planning process eventually grew into Puttin' on the Hits with Chris Bearde and Dick Clark serving as executive producers. Clark's son, Richard A. Clark, produced with Wood serving as the consulting producer. MCA Television served as distributor. Puttin' on the Hits was taped in Hollywood, California at Universal City Studios. Contestants would often dress up in costumes and use props to make their act more outrageous. This varied from a seemingly severed head singing \\"I Ain't Got Nobody\\" to an Aretha Franklin drag act using couch cushions for breasts. Other acts were more conservative and placed emphasis on performance. The competition was conducted as many other televised performance contests (e.g. Star Search) were. Each act was judged by a panel of celebrity judges based on their originality, appearance & lip-sync abilities. The judges could award a maximum of ten points per category, and their score totals were combined to give an act a total score of up to ninety points. In the event of a tie, the judges made a final decision to determine each winner. Each season was conducted as a tournament. Winners of a preliminary round received $1,000. Winning in the semifinal round was worth $5,000 to an act. At the end of the season, the winners of the semifinals competed in a grand championship final with $25,000 going to the winning act. Each contestant was given complimentary gifts and a videotape of their performance. Following the conclusion of the fourth season's tournament, the three previous season champions were invited back to compete once more against the winner of that season. The winning act won an additional $25,000. Puttin' on the Hits has been credited with launching the career of the group Troop, and Jazzmun, a drag performer who can be seen in many contemporary television shows. Kato Kaelin was another notable contestant, appearing during the show's third season performing Steppenwolf's \\"Born to Be Wild\\". Kids' version A short-lived spinoff called Puttin' on the Kids hosted by Michael Young also aired in the 1986-87 season, also distributed in syndication. Celebrity judges awarded savings bonds to two weekly winners.

Task parallelism focuses on distributing tasks—concurrently performed by processes or threads—across different processors. In contrast to data parallelism which involves running the same task on different components of data, task parallelism is distinguished by running many different tasks at the same time on the same data. A common type of task parallelism is pipelining which consists of moving a single set of data through a series of separate tasks where each task can execute independently of the others. Description In a multiprocessor system, task parallelism is achieved when each processor executes a different thread (or process) on the same or different data. The threads may execute the same or different code. In the general case, different execution threads communicate with one another as they work, but this is not a requirement. Communication usually takes place by passing data from one thread to the next as part of a workflow. As a simple example, if a system is running code on a 2-processor system (CPUs \\"a\\" & \\"b\\") in a parallel environment and we wish to do tasks \\"A\\" and \\"B\\", it is possible to tell CPU \\"a\\" to do task \\"A\\" and CPU \\"b\\" to do task \\"B\\" simultaneously, thereby reducing the run time of the execution. The tasks can be assigned using conditional statements as described below. Task parallelism emphasizes the distributed (parallelized) nature of the processing (i.e. threads), as opposed to the data (data parallelism). Most real programs fall somewhere on a continuum between task parallelism and data parallelism. Thread-level parallelism (TLP) is the parallelism inherent in an application that runs multiple threads at once. This type of parallelism is found largely in applications written for commercial servers such as databases. By running many threads at once, these applications are able to tolerate the high amounts of I/O and memory system latency their workloads can incur - while one thread is delayed waiting for a memory or disk access, other threads can do useful work. The exploitation of thread-level parallelism has also begun to make inroads into the desktop market with the advent of multi-core microprocessors. This has occurred because, for various reasons, it has become increasingly impractical to increase either the clock speed or instructions per clock of a single core. If this trend continues, new applications will have to be designed to utilize multiple threads in order to benefit from the increase in potential computing power. This contrasts with previous microprocessor innovations in which existing code was automatically sped up by running it on a newer/faster computer. Example The pseudocode below illustrates task parallelism: program: ... if CPU = \\"a\\" then do task \\"A\\" else if CPU=\\"b\\" then do task \\"B\\" end if ... end program The goal of the program is to do some net total task (\\"A+B\\"). If we write the code as above and launch it on a 2-processor system, then the runtime environment will execute it as follows. *In an SPMD (single program, multiple data) system, both CPUs will execute the code. *In a parallel environment, both will have access to the same data. *The \\"if\\" clause differentiates between the CPUs. CPU \\"a\\" will read true on the \\"if\\" and CPU \\"b\\" will read true on the \\"else if\\", thus having their own task. *Now, both CPU's execute separate code blocks simultaneously, performing different tasks simultaneously. Code executed by CPU \\"a\\": program: ... do task \\"A\\" ... end program Code executed by CPU \\"b\\": program: ... do task \\"B\\" ... end program This concept can now be generalized to any number of processors. Language support Task parallelism can be supported in general-purposes languages either built-in facilities or libraries. Notable examples include: * Ada: Tasks (built-in) * C++ (Intel): Threading Building Blocks * C++ (Intel): Cilk Plus * C++ (Open Source/Apache 2.0): RaftLib * C, C++, Objective-C (Apple): Grand Central Dispatch * D: tasks and fibers * Go: goroutines * Java: Java concurrency * .NET: Task Parallel Library * Delphi (System.Threading.TParallel) Examples of fine-grained task-parallel languages can be found in the realm of Hardware Description Languages like Verilog and VHDL.

Elminius modestus) is a species of barnacle in the family Austrobalanidae, native to Australia, Tasmania and New Zealand, but now spread to Britain and the north west coasts of Europe. It reaches a maximum size of about in diameter. Description A. modestus is a pearly grey, semi- translucent barnacle. It is composed of four distinct plates and leans a little to one side. Distribution and habitat A. modestus originated in Australia and was first seen in British waters, in Chichester Harbour, during the Second World War. It was believed to have arrived on the hulls of ships, or possibly the larval stages travelled in bilge water. It has become very common in southern England and Wales and is spreading northwards, but the spread may be limited by the temperature of the sea. It is found on the upper middle shore and is tolerant of low salinity levels where fresh water enters the sea. It avoids exposed positions. It had reached the Scottish Borders by 1960 and Shetland by 1978. It is found on the Atlantic coasts of Europe from Gibraltar to Germany. Ecology Nauplius of A. modestus A. modestus is a suspension feeder. It has feathery appendages which beat rhythmically to draw plankton and other organic particles into the shell for consumption. Eggs are laid and develop into nauplius larvae which are released into the phytoplankton. These then develop into cyprid larvae which later settle and cement themselves onto a rocky substrate. In the British Isles, A. modestus competes with Semibalanus balanoides, whereas in southern Europe it also competes with Chthamalus spp. It is particularly successful because it grows fast, tolerates reduced salinity, has a lower temperature tolerance than Chthamalus spp and a higher tolerance than Balanus spp. It is also a threat to native species because it reaches maturity in its first season and can produce several broods of larvae per year. It has an extended habitat as it grows both high up the shore and in the neritic zone.

Although it is located in Orange County it is included as part of the San Diego National Wildlife Refuge Complex. It was established in 1972. The refuge is a collaboration between the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the Department of the Navy. It serves as a critical habitat and winter stopover for many birds along the Pacific Flyway. Among the birds found at the refuge are great blue herons and the three endangered bird species: California clapper rail, California least tern, and Belding's Savannah sparrow. The refuge is located within Naval Weapons Station Seal Beach. Public access in the refuge is limited or restricted to once-a month tour (last Saturday of each month) as it is located within an active military base.\\"Seal Beach National Wildlife Refuge.\\" Seal Beach National Wildlife Refuge. U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service. Web. 7 Dec. 2014. . Habitat =Subtidal habitat= The subtidal zone is the shallow, near-shore area below the intertidal zone, the land between the high and low tide marks. Subtidal is permanently inundated, except for rare lowest low tide events. There are four tidal basins created for the restoration of wetland: Forrestal Pond, Case Road Pond, 7th Street Pond, and Perimeter Pond, which are currently supporting the subtidal habitat in the Refuge. Tidal water from Anaheim Bay supports the ponds. Dominating plants in these subtidal habitat is eelgrass, and mudflat portions in the habitat is supporting many invertebrate species. =Intertidal channels and tidal mudflat habitats= The complex system of tidal channels delivers moisture and nourishment (oxygen and nutrients) throughout the habitat and providing food or pathway to food for fish and other organisms. The soil of intertidal flats is a combination of clay, silt, sand, shells, and organic matter, with algae as dominant plants. Mudflats contain organisms which are a major food source for worms and invertebrates. Fishes, sharks and rays would often come to the mudflats with the tides and feed on transient or permanent residing fish. Shorebirds also depend on preying invertebrates on the mudflats. = Coastal salt marsh habitat= Coastal salt marsh habitat, situated above mudflats, contains salt tolerant vegetation. It is the predominant habitat in the refuge with 565-acre land occupied. It is a nesting, feeding and cover area for bird and fish including the endangered light-footed clapper rails and Belding's Savannah sparrow. A study on light- footed clapper rail was conducted since 1979. One of the study area is in the salt marsh in Anaheim Bay, the coastal salt marsh located in the Seal Beach National Wildlife Refuge. The environment of salt marsh was described: \\"The surrounding land lands are flat or gently sloping and provide little drainage into the bay. Consequently there are very little fresh water input other than winter rains… Most of the vegetation is characteristic of the low and middle littoral zones and is completely inundated by a 1.8 m tide (Mean Lower Low Water).\\" A list of major plants in the marsh was also provided: cordgrass (dominant plants at lower elevation), pickleweed and saltwort (dominant in middle elevation), seablite, saltgrass, sea lavender, arrowgrass, Jaumea carnosa, and Frankenia grandiflora. The dominating plants in the upper zone are glasswort and pickleweed. In the highest elevation (which sometimes is referred to as wetland/upland transition), there are no remaining native species. Oil extraction beneath the bay led to the marsh subsiding. From 1957 to 1970, elevation dropped 12.5 cm and by 1984, dropped by 25 cm. = Upland habitat= 41 acres within 65 acres of the uplands areas were built into roads, railroad tracks or others manmade structures. Most of these areas were originally wetland but were replaced for agricultural or military practices in the 19th century. * Hog Island Situated in the southern part of the Refuge, Hog Island was the only place that supported native vegetation, although none of it has been left for today. There are three \\"arms\\" stretching out of the land (military used in the past) planted with native vegetation today to support and shelter upland birds, especially during high tides. * NASA Island The island is completely manmade, built in the 1960s for rocket testing until 1977. It is leveled today and covered with sand to provide a nesting site for the least tern. * Non native upland One of these upland islands, located in the 7th Street Pond, supports non-native vegetation including five-horn smotherweed, common thistle, Maltese star-thistle, milk thistle, tumbleweed, black mustard, and the native pickleweed. Another one, in Case Road Pond, supports native intertidal vegetation, and some of the non-native vegetation mentioned. Historical change Night aerial view of Seal Beach, California, and vicinity, from the south. The large dark rectangle is the Naval Weapons Station Seal Beach, and the dark blob that extends it to the coast is the Seal Beach National Wildlife Refuge. In the lower right, the dark area separated from the ocean by the lighted California Highway 1 is the Bolsa Chica Ecological Reserve in Huntington Beach. In 1944, the Department of the Navy acquired about 5,000 acres of land in and around Anaheim Bay from the Alamitos Land Company. Although the Navy purchased the land, the California State Lands Commission held all of the submerged lands within the station. In May 1954, the Service contacted the Navy, regarding a potential hunting program on their land; however, the Navy rejected permission. Between 1954 and 1956, the Service made several additional proposals to the Navy for managing its lands including raising food crops to support waterfowl. In 1963, Congressman Richard Hanna told the Service he was interested in establishing a Refuge between Huntington Beach and Seal Beach. This cooperative plan for 600 acres of tidal marsh on Naval Weapons Station Seal Beach (NWSSB) was approved in 1964 through a three-way agreement among the Navy, the Service, and the California Department of Fish and Game. In 1971, there was a new discussion about establishing a Refuge at this location. This ultimately triggered political intervention by U.S. Congressman Craig Hosmer and California State Senator Dennis Carpenter. Through the efforts of Congressman Hosmer, President Nixon signed Public Law 92-408 in August 1972, authorizing the establishment of a National Wildlife Refuge on the NWSSB. The Refuge was officially established on July 11, 1974 when the Notice of the Establishment, which included the specific boundaries of the Refuge, was published in the Federal Register. Environmental change Loss of habitat In 1989, there was a big trapping of hundreds of foxes at Seal Beach National Wildlife Refuge. The red foxes were killed because they put a significant threat to two endangered species of birds, light-footed clapper rail and the California least tern. Even though an animal rights group had requested an injunction to prohibit trapping and maiming the foxes at the refuge, U.S District Judge refused to grant it. Thus, hundreds of foxes were sacrificed to preserve the light-footed clapper rail and the California least tern. Nowadays, no foxes or other predatory mammals can be seen at Seal Beach National Wildlife Refuge. Toxic Contamination In 1995, there was a study that U.S Navy has found elevated levels of toxic chemicals in the carcasses and food of endangered birds at the Seal Beach National Wildlife Refuge. The elevated levels of cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, nickel and zinc, all poisonous heavy metals, were found in dead California least terns and light-footed clapper rails. However, these potentially toxic substances were not only found in the birds, but also found in smaller animals normally eaten by them. They also found small amounts of PCBs and DDT, a dangerous pesticide that was banned by the Endangered Species Act in 1973. To find the cause, the Navy assessed the impacts of ponds on the refuge on the birds. They found that there was a construction of the pond by the Port of Long Beach that has raised the volume and velocity of the bay water flowing into the refuge. The toxic materials affect the birds with altered growth patterns, reduced survival, loss of appetite, lethargy, difficulty in reproducing, and even killing the birds. Studies Study of the endangered light-footed clapper rail was conducted in 1979. This study mainly focuses on the three remaining largest populations in Anaheim Bay, Upper Newport Bay and Tijuana Marsh in San Diego county. Study of the California least tern nesting season was conducted in 1980. This study mainly focuses on previously color-banded least tern chicks nesting behavior in the Seal Beach National Wildlife Refuge. A least tern nesting site was prepared in the refuge in 1978 for the study.

It is based on a novel of the same name by Jean Cocteau.  Plot  The film is set during World War I, as Paris is expected to fall to the Germans. The Princesse de Bormes, a widow, helps wounded soldiers by evacuating them from the front and bringing them to her villa in Paris for medical care. However, the authorities will not give the Princess and the soldiers passes to return to Paris. The situation changes when an innocent 16-year-old boy, Guillaume Thomas de Fontenoy, joins the authorities and is mistaken as the nephew of the popular General de Fontenoy. Thomas is able to use his position of posing as the general's nephew to cut through the red tape, in order to help the Princess. She is entranced by Thomas, and her daughter, Henriette, falls in love with him. However, Thomas feels impelled to see more war action. Later, he is caught behind enemy lines when he is moved with a military unit into the heat of battle.

Reception In a contemporary review from the Monthly Film Bulletin, noted that film treated war as \\"fantasy\\" with Franju's film as being an \\"almost fairy-tale fantasy of figures moving in a mystical land where everything seems predetermined\\" and noted that \\"Emmanuele Riva gives a hauntingly beautiful performance as the Princess, and Fabrice Rouleau looks exactly right as Thomas; and the commentary, finely spoken by Jean Marasi, is for once in accord with the images and mood of the film.\\" The review concluded that \\"Franju has captured the spirit of Cocteau's novel, the point at which the surface glamour of war becomes the awful reality of its suffering.\\" References  External links  * * Category:1965 films Category:Adaptations of works by Jean Cocteau Category:French black-and-white films Category:French films Category:1965 drama films Category:Films directed by Georges Franju Category:Films set on the French home front during World War I Category:Western Front (World War I) films Category:Films set in Paris Category:Films with screenplays by Jean Cocteau ","title":"Thomas the Impostor"},{"id":"9468199","text":"Floodland is a children's fantasy novel by Marcus Sedgwick, published on 2 March 2000 by Orion Children's Books.

The program, now published by McGraw-Hill Education, has sparked debate.  History  Everyday Mathematics curriculum was developed by the University of Chicago School Math Project (or UCSMP ) Chicago educational- retrieved in 2004 which was founded in 1983. Work on it started in the summer of 1985. The 1st edition was released in 1998 and the 2nd in 2002. A third edition was released in 2007 and a fourth in 2014-2015.Max Bell was Project Director and James McBride was Project Director  Curriculum structure  Below is an outline of the components of EM as they are generally seen throughout the curriculum. ;Lessons: A typical lesson outlined in one of the teacher’s manuals includes three partsExample of typical lesson online- retrieved in April 2009 * Teaching the Lesson—Provides main instructional activities for the lesson. * Ongoing Learning and Practice—Supports previously introduced concepts and skills; essential for maintaining skills. * Differentiation Options—Includes options for supporting the needs of all students; usually an extension of Part 1, Teaching the Lesson. ;Daily Routines: Every day, there are certain things that each EM lesson requires the student to do routinely. These components can be dispersed throughout the day or they can be part of the main math lesson. * Math Messages—These are problems, displayed in a manner chosen by the teacher, that students complete before the lesson and then discuss as an opener to the main lesson. * Mental Math and Reflexes—These are brief (no longer than 5 min) sessions “…designed to strengthen children's number sense and to review and advance essential basic skills…” (Program Components 2003). * Math Boxes—These are pages intended to have students routinely practice problems independently. * Home Links/Study Links—Everyday homework is sent home. Grades K-3 they are called Home Links and 4-6 they are Study Links. They are meant to reinforce instruction as well as connect home to the work at school. ;Supplemental Aspects Beyond the components already listed, there are supplemental resources to the program. The two most common are games and explorations. * Games— “…Everyday Mathematics sees games as enjoyable ways to practice number skills, especially those that help children develop fact power…” (Program Components 2003). Therefore, authors of the series have interwoven games throughout daily lessons and activities.  Scientific support for the curriculum  What Works Clearinghouse ( or WWC ) WWC: is a database math interventions prepared by a contractor for the U.S. Department of Education) reviewed the evidence in support of the Everyday Mathematics program. Of the 61 pieces of evidence submitted by the publisher, 57 did not meet the WWC minimum standards for scientific evidence, four met evidence standards with reservations, and one of those four showed a statistically significant positive effect. Based on the four studies considered, the WWC gave Everyday Math a rating of \\"Potentially Positive Effect\\" with the four studies showing a mean improvement in elementary math achievement (versus unspecified alternative programs) of 6 percentile rank points with a range of -7 to +14 percentile rank points, on a scale from -50 to +50.Interpretation: An average (50th percentile rank) student taught with Everyday Math could be expected to perform on average as well on the measurements used in the various studies as a student in one of the comparison programs performing at the 56th percentile rankWhat Works Clearinghouse Intervention Report on Everyday Mathematics, updated April 2007 - retrieved 2009-04-11  Criticism  After the first edition was released, it became part of a nationwide controversy over reform mathematics. In October 1999, US Department of Education issued a report labeling Everyday Mathematics one of five \\"promising\\" new math programs.Jackson, A.;Notices of the American Mathematical Society,2000 The perceived endorsement of Everyday Mathematics and a number of other textbooks by an agency of the US government caused such outrage among practicing mathematicians and scientists that a group of them drafted an open letter to then Secretary of Education Richard Riley urging him to withdraw the report. The letter appeared in the November 18, 1999 edition of the Post and was eventually signed by more than 200 prominent mathematicians and scientists including four Nobel Laureates (one of whom, Steven Chu, has since become Secretary of Energy), three Fields Medalists, a National Medal of Science winner from the University of Chicago, and the some chairs of math departments.departments : at Caltech, Cornell, Stanford, UC Irvine, University of Maryland, University of Rochester, University of Wisconsin, and Yale University The debate has continued at the state and local level as school districts across the country consider the adoption of Everyday Math. Two states where the controversy has attracted national attention are California and Texas. California has one of the most rigorous textbook adoption processes and in January 2001 rejected Everyday Mathematics for failing to meet state content standards.California State Board of Education 2001 Mathematics Adoption Report, January 2001 Retrieved April 19, 2009 Everyday Math stayed off the California textbook lists until 2007 when the publisher released a California version of the 3rd edition that is supplemented with more traditional arithmetic,California State Board of Education 2007 Mathematics Primary Adoption Report, (2008)- Url retrieved April 19, 2009 reigniting debate at the local level.quote by Samuels,D,2009-04- 14, \\"Palo Alto school-URL retrieved April 19, 2009 In late 2007, the Texas State Board of Education took the unusual step of rejecting the 3rd edition of Everyday Math State Board of Education Summary of Action Items, November 16, 2007 Retrieved April 19, 2009 after earlier editions had been in use in more than 70 districts across the state.

Designed by the city architect Johan Eberhard Carlberg (1683-1773) in 1728 and completed in 1731, the warehouse was where the Crown kept grains and other goods collected as taxes paid in kind. By 1795 it was briefly used to store the royal trophies before it was rebuilt into an Army storage in 1795.

It originally aired on ABC on 26 November 1965. The episode was directed by Gerry O'Hara and written by Roger Marshall.  Plot  Steed and Mrs Peel swerve to avoid a dog and crash into a tree. The clock in the car smashes and stops just before 11 o'clock. Steed knows the area well and the two set out on foot and visit the old RAF base. They enter the lounge and find it set for a party but everyone is absent. They do not yet notice that the clock has stopped at 11 and the fish in the tank have frozen still. Outside they find a car with petrol flooding and nobody attending to it. The other buildings of the base are empty and a milk cart abandoned. Seeing the name Geoffrey in the book, they visit his quarters and also find it empty and an electric shaver still running. They find the air control tower empty and then spot the milkman fleeing across the tarmac who is shot dead. Looking for the culprit, they find a rabbit alive but unconscious, and later the body of the milkman disappears. Steed and Mrs Peel separate and investigate the base further. Mrs Peel discovers the body of the milkman on his float as a deafening shrill noise and quake shakes through the base. When the noise eventually stops, Steed returns to the lounge to get himself a drink at the bar, whereupon he discovers the frozen fish and stopped clock. Outside he discovers a vagrant looking in the dustbins. Steed gives him a drink in the lounge and the vagrant says he also experienced the shrill noise. A dog enters which belongs to the gate tender and is known to the vagrant. Steed approaches the gate house and is struck unconscious by a falling barrier. The scene then returns to the crashed car and Steed emerging from it as if the crash had just happened. Mrs Peel is missing. Steed returns to the base and finds the lounge bustling with activity; he is greeted by old comrades. They tell Steed that Mrs Peel had rung them telling that she was unable to attend, and they say there is no tramp living on the premises. Outside he discovers the dog who leads him to the dead body of the tramp, just as the milkman drives off (with the body of the original milkman on the back). The milkman takes the body into the cook house. When Steed approaches he finds the apparently dead milkman alive and well and busy. The milkman and an accomplice take out new bodies from the medical centre and put them on the back of the float. Steed investigates the clinic. He overpowers a guard and discovers Mrs Peel tied up and unable to recall anything since the accident. Looking at the equipment, Mrs Peel surmises that the people in the airbase had been hypnotized and programmed to potentially create sabotage. As Steed plays with an ultrasonic device the people in the lounge hear the shrill deafening noise over the speakers as he and Mrs Peel realize that is what has happened. One of Steed's old friends and an accomplice show themselves and hold Steed and Mrs Peel and gunpoint. They reveal a plan to auction off the 30 hypnotically programmed military people to the highest bidder. Steed and Mrs Peel overcome these criminals but not before laughing gas is set off leaving them in hysterics.

In 1934, he introduced women's suffrage to Tabasco, making him the second governor to do so after Felipe Carrillo Puerto of the Yucatán twelve years earlier. In Mexico, Garrido Canabal's Tabasco was one of several \\"vying with one another for the title 'Laboratory of the Revolution'.\\"Gilbert M. Joseph (ed.), The Mexico Reader (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2002): 411. As Governor, however, he also issued rigid decrees against corsets and alcohol and outlawed tombstones. When Lázaro Cárdenas was elected president in 1934, his first cabinet was hand-picked by his patron, Plutarco Elías Calles, the \\"Jefe Máximo\\" and power behind the presidency.Cline, Howard F. The United States and Mexico, second edition. Cambridge: Harvard University Press 1961, p. 219. Calles named fellow anticlerical Garrido Canabal as Secretary of Agriculture to Lázaro Cárdenas's cabinet. Garrido Canabal brought the Red Shirts to Mexico City. Soon after Cárdenas took office, he turned against Garrido Canabal. In 1935, after Garrido Canabal ordered his Red Shirts to kill Catholic activists in Mexico City seeking to return to Tabasco, Cárdenas forced Garrido Canabal to step down and into exile in Costa Rica.Krauze, Enrique. \\"THE TROUBLING ROOTS OF MEXICO'S LÓPEZ OBRADOR: Tropical Messiah\\". The New Republic. June 19, 2006. Dismissing Garrido Canabal was part of Cárdenas's political maneuvering against Calles, who had expected to continue to be the power behind the presidency. Politically, eliminating Garrido Canabal and Calles gained Cárdenas the grudging support of the Roman Catholic Church in Mexico.Cline, United States and Mexico, p. 220. Garrido Canabal's paramilitary groups were subsequently disbanded. He was allowed to return to Mexico in 1941 and died two years later of cancer in Los Angeles, California.  Literary portrayal  The lieutenant in Graham Greene's The Power and the Glory is clearly based on Garrido Canabal,Barbara A. Tenenbaum and Georgette M. Dorn (eds.), Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture (New York: Scribner's, 1996). though his name is never mentioned. The novel's protagonist is a (also unnamed) \\"whisky priest\\", a theme often used in Garrido Canabal's antireligious propaganda.

It was created by Olof Melin (1849–1940), an officer in the Swedish Army. He was a teacher of the Gabelsberger shorthand system in the Swedish army, but he was dissatisfied with it so he created an alternate system, that today is known as the Melin System. Basic forms The basic forms of the Melin System are the consonants, vowels, and combinations. In addition there are a large number of ending forms as well as abbreviations. The basic forms are shown below: {  frame  frame  frame } Some of the vowels and consonants have the same shapes, but they are distinguishable from their context, as vowels are always written from the bottom up and consonants from the top down.

Solutor was also the name of a member of the group of martyrs, along with Valentine and Victor, who died at Ravenna around 305 AD. Solutor, along with Octavius and Adventor (), (died ca. 284 AD) is patron saint of Turin. Historical detail regarding these martyrs is sparse; their memory is preserved because the three were mentioned in a sermon by Maximus of Turin. However, Maximus makes no precise geographic or temporal references regarding Solutor, Octavius, and Adventor.San Solutore Their legend states that they were members of the Theban Legion during the end of the 3rd century. While the legion's leader, Saint Maurice, was killed at Agaunum, along with many other soldiers, Solutor, Adventor, and Octavius managed to escape. Adventor and Octavius, however, were caught at the Dora Riparia and killed there. Solutor would be killed at a quarry near the Dora Baltea near Caravino. A matron of Ivrea collected their bodies in a quadriga and carried them to Turin. Veneration In 490, Victor of Turin, bishop of the city, enlarged the church that housed their relics. In 1006, a monastery, San Solutore in Turin, was established by Bishop Gezo of Turin. The relics of the three martyrs, together with those of Saint Juliana and Saint Gozzelino (Goslino), second abbot of San Solutore, were transferred to the Turinese sanctuary known as the Consolata after Francis I of France ordered the demolition of San Solutore. In 1619, the relics were translated to the new church of the Holy Martyrs (Santi Martiri) on the Via Garibaldi. This church was built with the support of the Piedmontese pontiff Pius V and Emmanuel Philibert. The relics are still found at this church. According to legend, a vision of the Virgin Mary appeared in a dream to John Bosco in 1844 or 1845 and revealed the site of the martyrdom of Adventor and Octavius. The Basilica dell'Ausiliatrice was built on the spot.SALESIANI DON BOSCO-SDB/ Casa Madre TORINO-VALDOCCO / Santuario-Basilica Maria Ausiliatrice - 3 The cult of Saint Solutor is particularly strong in the diocese of Ivrea, and he is also venerated in Caravino, Romano Canavese, and Strambino.

Landing is the final phase in flight, in which the aircraft returns to the ground. The average vertical speed in a landing is around ; greater vertical speed should be classed by crew as hard. Crew judgment is most reliable to determine hard landing, as determination based on recorded acceleration value is difficult and not advisable, partially because there is no recording of true vertical acceleration.Guillaume Aigoin, Characterising hard landings / EASA EOFDM Conference, 12 January 2012, page 7: \\"The vertical parameter is neither vertical nor an acceleration … It is the normal load factor in the aircraft reference frame is not sufficient for assessing contact severity!\\" Hard landings can be caused by weather conditions, mechanical problems, over-weight aircraft, pilot decision and/or pilot error. The term hard landing usually implies that the pilot still has total or partial control over the aircraft, as opposed to an uncontrolled descent into terrain (a crash). Hard landings can vary in their consequences, from mild passenger discomfort to vehicle damage, structural failure, injuries, and/or loss of life. When an aircraft has a hard landing, it must be inspected for damage before its next flight. Hard landings can cause extensive damage to aircraft if not carried out safely or properly. On , a Boeing 767 of All Nippon Airways landed with such force that a large crease formed in the aircraft's skin. When the final approach isn't stabilised, the crew should abort and go around, as expressed by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau after investigating the hard landing of a Malaysia Airlines Airbus A330 in Melbourne Airport coming from Kuala Lumpur on 14 March 2015. For helicopters, a hard landing can occur after mechanical or engine damage or failure when the rotor(s) are still intact and free to turn. Autorotation, in which airflow over the rotors keeps them turning and provides some lift, can allow limited pilot control during descent. As an unpowered descent, it requires considerable pilot skill and experience to safely execute. A hard landing of a spacecraft such as a rocket stage usually ends with its destruction and can be intentional or unintentional. When a high- velocity impact is planned (when its purpose is to study consequences of impact), the spacecraft is called an impactor.

The Cumulus Media outlet is licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to broadcast at 98.5 MHz with an ERP of 6 kW. Its studios are located at the Granby Building in Cayce and the transmitter is in Columbia northeast of downtown. History WOMG's former \\"Oldies 103\\" logo prior to 2008 98.5 was allocated in the early 1990s as part of an FCC docket that would allow the Columbia metro area several new radio stations. The license was eventually awarded to Lexington Communications, which applied for the WLXC call letters. Before construction started, Lexington Communications agreed to sell the station to HFS Communications, another group, on the condition that WLXC was operated by the company for a period of one year before completing the transaction.\\"Radio Station Doesn't Plan To Change Its Tune\\", The State newspaper, November 4, 1995 Studios for the station were constructed in the town of Lexington while the transmitting facilities were built near the village of Red Bank.

The station also produced and aired significant high school sports content that featured live play-by-play of all area schools' football and basketball programs. WLXC programming even featured live play-by-play coverage of the 1995 Dixie Youth World Series held in Lexington, SC. While the station gained the rights for several national and regional sporting events, it had struggled in landing sporting events from the area's two most-popular teams: the University of South Carolina and Clemson University, primarily because both teams were already locked up in the Columbia market on other stations.\\"All-Sports Radio Station Still Seeking Programming Hits\\", \\"The State\\" newspaper, September 30, 1995 At one point, WLXC came close to acquiring Clemson sporting rights when their radio network was sold to a different syndication group.

Baker at the time was the owner of WWBZ in McClellanville and had also recently acquired WNCK in Port Royal. Both stations operated a Charleston-based syndicated Beach music format known as \\"The Breeze\\", which Baker partially owned. In December, after weeks of rumors, WLXC announced that the format would be changed to \\"The Breeze\\" as well. Airstaff on \\"The Breeze\\" network included veteran brother duo Leo and Woody Windham for mornings (both have been fixtures for many years in the Columbia radio market as well as part-owners of the network), Tanya Roberts (a former WOMG air talent) for middays, Bob Boswell for afternoons, and Eddie Zomerfield for nights. Iconic DJ DANGER DAN (Elm) was an integral part of the Network in the 1990s doing nights and weekends. He produced the Duke and Clemson Sports broadcasts and the Stingrays Hockey broadcasts.

Despite these changes, WLXC failed to gain traction in the Columbia ratings over the next couple of years, although it had a small but loyal following.

It began in 1978, and is currently presented by Graham Bell and Ed Leigh. History Originally launched in 1978 on the back of the 1976 Winter Olympics, later forming part of Sunday Grandstand and presented and commentated on by British broadcasting luminaries such as Ron Pickering and David Vine (who presented the show for 20 years until he took semi-retirement in 1996), the show focused primarily on the blue riband events of downhill skiing and Special Slalom. Following the final edition of Grandstand in early 2007, Ski Sunday became one of the longest-running BBC Sports television programmes still being broadcast; the 2008 series was the 30th. Format As the British appetite for alpine skiing changed over time, the programme experimented with different formats and time-slots. In recent years the show has been presented by, amongst others, Hazel Irvine, Matt Chilton, former British Olympic skier Graham Bell and Ed Leigh. The 2008 season started on 20 January in an extended prime time slot (Sundays 7pm to 8pm GMT) and was broadcast weekly on BBC2 for eight weeks. The 2008 revised format covered most forms of competition skiing and snowboarding as well as covering travelogue and entertainment features.Revamped Ski Sunday returns to BBC Two, BBC, 17 December 2007 The series also offered interactive features via the BBC Red Button service. The 2009 series began on 10 January with a special preview programme presented by Graham Bell covering a summer trek in the Alps. The 2009 series-proper started on 18 January, and was again broadcast on BBC2 and BBC Red Button.Winters sports on the BBC BBC, 10 January 2009 Prior to the launch of the 2009 season, it was reported that the more general winter sports content of the 2008 format was not popular with viewers,Ski Sunday fails to satisfy race fans The Telegraph, 11 January 2009 and the BBC acknowledged: \\"we didn't get things quite right last year. Ski racing fans wanted more of the action and our new viewers wanted more adventure.\\"Ski Sunday returns BBC Blog, 11 January 2009 Consequently, for 2009 the show was divided into two programmes: Ski Sunday and High Altitude; the former covering ski racing and the latter, \\"mountain adventure\\". For the 2010 season, High Altitude was dropped and a stand-alone Ski Sunday comprised one half-hour programme weekly, shown around 5pm on BBC2 on Sunday evenings. It consisted largely of events coverage, plus a new clothing, equipment and technology slot, with further events covered and a worldwide skiing weather report accessible afterwards via the Red Button digital services. Bell and Leigh continued to present. For the 2011 season, Ski Sunday returned on 9 January 2011 on BBC2 and ran until 2 February 2011 with Ski Sunday Extra available via the BBC Red Button interactive services. Ski Club of Great Britain, 22 December 2010 The show's format continued the 2010 approach, focusing on coverage of the unfolding alpine ski racing season interspersed with occasional featured segments on alternative winter sports such as Crashed Ice downhill skating and snowboard events. The format for the 2012 series remained largely unaltered, continuing to focus on the key alpine ski racing events with extended (and sometime live) coverage via the BBC's interactive service. Short magazine pieces also focused on winter sport personalities (such as Jenny Jones), events (such as Slopestyle) and travelogues. In 2013 for its 35th series, former Olympic skeleton champion Amy Williams joined the team. Theme tune The iconic theme music to the programme, \\"Pop Looks Bach\\" by Sam Fonteyn, has changed very little over the years and is well-known to the British public. It has been re-mixed and sampled many times over. The music has also been used as the theme tune for the BBC's coverage of the Winter Olympics until the 2006 Games. In the US, the religion-oriented radio show The World Tomorrow used Pop Looks Bach as its opening music during the 1980s. It was first recorded for the Boosey & Hawkes Music Library in 1970, and was not written for the BBC. It has similarities to the opening of Bach's famous Fugue in D minor, which is referenced to by a church organ in the background instrumentation of the original recording.

His father was Alfonso Gumucio Reyes, a leader of the Movimiento Nacionalista Revolucionario (MNR), Minister of Economy during the Government of Víctor Paz Estenssoro, and Ambassador to Uruguay and Spain. He is the author of several books on film and [communication for social change, as well as documentary films, photographic exhibits and hundreds of articles in journals. He has worked in five continents on social development projects, as a communication for development specialist. Because of his involvement as progressive journalist he has twice been forced to live in exile, first living in Paris from 1972 to 1978, and later in Mexico from 1980 to 1984. He studied filmmaking at the Institut des hautes études cinématographique (IDHEC) and the University of Vincennes, in Paris. Back in Bolivia in 1978 he directed a number of documentaries on cultural and social issues, as he worked at the Centro de Investigacion y Promocion del Campesinado (CIPCA), a Bolivian NGO, and published as a journalist in various daily newspapers and weekly journals. Since the mid-1980s his work in development communication programs has taken him to Africa, Asia, the South Pacific, Latin America and The Caribbean, serving for various international organizations. He worked with UNICEF in Nigeria and Haiti, and as an international consultant for FAO, UNDP, UNESCO, The Rockefeller Foundation, AusAID and Conservation International. He is the Managing Director for Programmes at the Communication for Social Change Consortium and familiar with issues of child rights, environment, indigenous populations, arts and culture, human rights, community organization, health and sustainable development.  Books Gumucio Dagron has published over twenty books, including poetry, narrative and studies on literature, film and communication: Provocaciones, his first book (1977) is a collection of in- depth interviews with 14 important Bolivian writers, among them: Jesus Lara, Augusto Cespedes, Oscar Cerruto, Jaime Saenz, Pedro Shimose, Renato Prada Oropeza and Raul Teixido. His studies on Bolivian and Latin American cinema trace the evolution of this art form in his region and home country: Historia del Cine Boliviano (Mexico, 1982); Cine, Censura y Exilio en América Latina (1979); Les Cinémas d’Amerique Latine (Paris, 1981) written in French, in collaboration with French film critic Guy Hennebelle; El Cine de los Trabajadores (Managua, 1981), and Luis Espinal y el Cine (1986). Issues of communication, participation and development are at the core of other of his books: Las Radios Mineras de Bolivia (1989) written in collaboration with Bolivian journalist Lupe Cajías; Comunicación Alternativa y Cambio Social (1990); Conservacion, Desarrollo y Comunicacion (1990); NGO Puzzle (Nigeria, 1993) in collaboration with G.K. Ngeri Nwagha; Popular Theatre (Nigeria, 1994); Making Waves: Participatory communication for social change (New York, 2001), a research project for The Rockefeller Foundation, published in Spanish, English and French; and Communication for Social Change Anthology: Historical and Contemporary Readings (New York, 2006), edited in collaboration with Thomas Tufte, launched at the World Congress of Communication for Development (WCCD) in Rome, October 2006. Bolivie (Paris, 1981, published by Editions Le Seuil), is an essay on his home country, covering history, politics, culture and other issues. La Máscara del Gorila (Mexico, 1982), is his account on the Bolivian military coup of 1981 and was awarded with the National Literature Award of the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes of Mexico (INBA). His poetry books include: Antología del asco (1979), Razones técnicas (1980), Sobras completas (1984), Sentímetros (1990) and Memoria de Caracoles (2000). His short stories, poems and essays have been selected in about 30 anthologies and collections, among them those edited by John Downing, Julianne Burton, Manuel Vargas, Raquel Montenegro, Cecilia Pisos, Víctor Montoya, Rosario Santos, Jan Servaes, Bruce Girard, Paulo Antonio Paranagua, Ángel Flores, Tim Barnard, Sandra Reyes, and Alan O'Connor.  Films  Gumucio Dagron studied film in France and worked as assistant director to Alan Labrousse and Jorge Sanjines, and as a scriptwriter for Antonio Eguino. Dagron's first film as director, Señores Generales, Señores Coroneles (1976), is a documentary portraying the role of the Bolivian army and the CIA in the 1971 military coup that interrupted the democratic process in Bolivia; it includes interviews with Philip Agee, former CIA agent, and Régis Debray. During the late 1970s and early 1980s Dagron directed short documentary films on social and cultural issues, including Tupaj Katari, 15 de noviembre (1978), El Ejército en Villa Anta (1979), Comunidades de Trabajo (1979), Cooperativa Sandino (Nicaragua, 1980), Domitila: la mujer y la organización (1980), Primo Castrillo, poeta (1984). In 1983 he co-directed with Eduardo Barrios, a documentary for UNESCO on the miners community radio stations: The voice of the mines. Dagron's documentary film Bolivia: Union Rights (1988), part of the People Matter series produced by AVISE, was aired by the Dutch television. He later directed Oloruntoba (Nigeria, 1994), a portrait of the Nigerian artist; Sous Lavi (Haiti, 1997); La Primerisima (2003) and Voices from the Magdalena: Communication for Peace (Colombia, 2006), a report on community radio stations working in a war-torn region of Colombia. Dagron has been active as a film critic during the 1980s and 1990s, publishing his columns in journals of Latin America, Europe, North America and Africa.  Photography  Over the years, his photographic work has been shown in personal and collective exhibits on Bolivian landscapes and people (Altiplano, 1989) and portraits of artists from Latin America (Retrato Hablado, 1990). After four years working in Nigeria, he presented his series on children (Age of Innocence, Nigeria 1994 and (Bagaje Africano, Bolivia 1995). In Haiti he exhibited people and landscapes (Trois- sur-Haiti, 1997). Other photography shows include: Imágenes de Bolivia (París, 1973), Reflejos y Transparencias (La Paz, 1988), Nueve Fotógrafos (La Paz, 1990), Paisaje y Medio Ambiente (La Paz, 1995). Some of his photographs have been distributed by Gamma agency, and through the German news agency DPA, along with his articles on Latin American culture. Books such as Realizando el Futuro published by the Corporación Andina de Fomento (CAF), Ciudad de La Paz, Luz, Magia y Tradición published by the Municipality of La Paz, included his photographs, as well as Imágenes del Trabajo, awarded at the 4th International Art Contest organized by the International Labour Organization (ILO) in 1986. His photographic work has been used in book covers, calendars, magazines and journals of Latin America. In 1983 he wrote the first historical perspective on Bolivian photography, which was published in the monthly journal Bolivia 2000 with the title \\"Primera Aproximación a la Fotografía en Bolivia\\". Later, in 1986 Cóndor, a quarterly review published in Switzerland, printed his article \\"Breve Vistazo a la Fotografía Boliviana\\". He is a founding member of the Bolivian Society of Photography (Sociedad Boliviana de Fotografía) and served as Secretary for Media Relations for the 1986–88 period. He was elected President of the Bolivian Circle of Professional Photographers (Círculo de Boliviano de Fotografía) for 1995–96.  Journalism  Alfonso Gumucio Dagron has published over a thousand articles and short essays in approximately one hundred newspapers, journals and magazines of Latin America, Europe, North America, Asia and Africa.

The governments of Italy, Germany and, to a lesser extent, Portugal contributed money, munitions, manpower and support to Nationalist forces, led by Francisco Franco. The governments of the Soviet Union and, to a lesser extent, France and Mexico, aided the Republicans, also called Loyalists, of the Second Spanish Republic. The aid came even after all the European powers had signed a Non-Intervention Agreement in 1936. Although individual sympathy for the plight of the Spanish Republic was widespread in the liberal democracies, pacifism and the fear of a second world war prevented them from selling or giving arms. However, Nationalist pleas were answered within days by Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini.Stanley C. Payne, The Spanish Revolution (1970) pp 262–76 Tens of thousands of individual foreign volunteers travelled to Spain to fight, the majority for the Republican side. International non-intervention Non- intervention had been proposed in a joint diplomatic initiative by the governments of France and the United Kingdom, which responded to antiwar sentiment. France was also worried that sympathisers of the Nationalists would cause a civil war in France.Beevor (2006). p. 374. Non-intervention was part of a policy aimed at preventing a proxy war and the escalation of the war into a second world war.Stone (1997). p. 134. On 3 August 1936, Charles de Chambrun presented the French government's non-intervention plan, and Galeazzo Ciano promised to study it. The British, however, immediately accepted the plan in principle.Hugh Thomas, The Spanish Civil War (1961). p. 257. The next day, it was put to Germany by André François-Poncet. The German position was that such a declaration was not needed. A similar approach was made to the Soviet Union. On 6 August, Ciano confirmed Italian support in principle. The Soviet government similarly agreed in principle if Portugal was included and Germany and Italy stopped aid immediately.Thomas (1961). pp. 257–258. On 7 August, France unilaterally declared its non-intervention.Alpert (1998). p. 45. Draft declarations had been put to German and Italian governments. Such a declaration had already been accepted by the United Kingdom, Belgium, the Netherlands, Poland, Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union, renouncing all traffic in war matériel, direct or indirect.Thomas (1961). p. 258. Portuguese Foreign Minister, Armindo Monteiro,See also :pt:Armindo Rodrigues de Sttau Monteiro was also asked to accept but held his hand. On 9 August, French exports were suspended.Alpert (1998). pp. 45–46. Portugal accepted the pact on 13 August unless its border was threatened by the war.Thomas (1961). p. 259. On 15 August, the United Kingdom banned exports of war materiel to Spain. Italy agreed to the pact, signing on 21 August. The was a surprising reversal of views has been put down to the growing belief that countries could not abide by the agreement anyway. On 24 August, Germany signed.Thomas (1961). p. 261.Alpert (1998). p. 44. The Soviet Union was keen not to be left out. On 23 August, it agreed to the Non-Intervention Agreement,Alpert (1998). p. 51. which was followed by a decree from Joseph Stalin banning exports of war matérial to Spain, thereby bringing the Soviets into line with the Western powers. =Non-Intervention Committee= It was then that the Non-Intervention Committee was created to uphold the agreement, but the double-dealing of both the Soviet Union and Germany had already become apparent.Thomas (1961). pp. 263–4. The ostensible purpose of the committee was to prevent personnel and matériel reaching the warring parties, as with the Non-Intervention Agreement. The committee first met in London on 9 September 1936.Beevor (2006). p. 378.Involved were Albania, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Norway, Poland, Romania, Turkey, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom and Yugoslavia. (Thomas (1961). p. 277.) It was chaired by the British W. S. Morrison. France was represented by Charles Corbin, Italy by Dino Grandi and the Soviet Union by Ivan Maisky. Germany was represented by Joachim von Ribbentrop, and Portugal, whose presence had been a Soviet requirement, was not represented.Thomas (1961). p. 278. The second meeting took place on 14 September.Beevor (2006). p. 385. It established a subcommittee to be attended by representatives of Belgium, Czechoslovakia, France, Germany, Italy, the Soviet Union, Sweden and the United Kingdom to deal with the day-to-day running of non-intervention. Among them, however, the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Italy dominated, perhaps worryingly so. Soviet non-military aid was revived but not military aid.Thomas (1961). p. 281. Meanwhile, the 1936 meeting of the League of Nations began.Thomas (1961). p. 283. There, Anthony Eden convinced Monteiro to have Portugal join the Non- Intervention Committee. Álvarez del Vayo spoke out against the Non- Intervention Agreement, claiming that it put the rebel Nationalists on the same footing as the Republican government.Thomas (1961). pp. 283–4. The Earl of Plymouth replaced Morrison as the British representative.Thomas (1961). p. 284.Preston (2006). p. 159. A member of the British Conservative Party, he often adjourned meetings to the benefit of the Italians and Germans, and the committee was accused of having an anti-Soviet bias. On 12 November, plans to post observers to Spanish frontiers and ports to prevent breaches of the agreement were ratified. France and the United Kingdom became divided on whether to recognise Franco's forces as a belligerent, as the British wanted, or to fail to do, as the French wanted.Thomas (1961). p. 332. That was subsumed by the news that the Italian and German governments had recognised the Nationalists as the true government of Spain. The League of Nations condemned intervention, urged its council's members to support non- intervention and commended mediation.Thomas (1961). p. 336. It then closed discussion on Spain, leaving it to the committee.Alpert (1998). p. 105. A mediation plan, however, was soon dropped. The Soviets met the request to ban volunteers on 27 December, Portugal and did so on 5 January and Germany and Italy on 7 January.Thomas (1961). p. 340. On 20 January, Italy put a moratorium on volunteers since it believed that supplies to the Nationalists were now sufficient. Non-intervention would have left both sides with the possibility of defeat, which Germany, Italy and the Soviet Union, in particular, were keen to avoid.Thomas (1961). pp. 342–3. =Control plan= Observers were posted to Spanish ports and borders, and both Ribbentrop and Grandi were told to agree to the plan, significant shipments already having taken place.Thomas (1961). p. 394. Portugal would not accept observers but agreed to personnel attached to the British embassy in Lisbon. Zones of patrol were assigned to each of the four nations, and an International Board was set up to administer the scheme. There were Italian assurances that Italy would not end non-intervention.Thomas (1961). p. 396. In May, the committee noted two attacks on the patrol's ships by Republican aircraft.Bulletin of International News (1937). p. 3. It iterated calls for the withdrawal of volunteers from Spain, condemned the bombing of open towns and showed approval of humanitarian work.Thomas (1961). pp. 439–440. Germany and Italy stated that they would withdraw from the committee and from the patrols without guarantees of no further attacks.Thomas (1961). p. 441. Early June saw the return of Germany and Italy to the committee and the patrols.Thomas (1961). p. 456. Attacks on the German cruiser Leipzig on 15 and 18 June made Germany and Italy once again withdraw from patrols but not from the committee.Bulletin of International News (1937). pp. 4–5. That prompted the Portuguese government to remove British observers on the Spanish-Portuguese border.Bulletin of International News (1937). p. 6. The United Kingdom and France offered to replace Germany and Italy, which, however, believed that they would be too partial.Bulletin of International News (1937). p. 7. Germany and Italy requested for land controls to be kept and for belligerent rights to be given to the Nationalists to allow rights of search to be used by both the Republicans and the Nationalists to replace naval patrols.Thomas (1961). p. 457. A British plan suggested naval patrols to be replaced by observers in ports and ships, with land control measures being resumed.Thomas (1961). p. 463.Bulletin of International News (1937). pp. 9–10. Belligerent rights would not be granted until substantial progress was made on the volunteer withdrawal. It culminated in a period during 1937, when all of the powers were prepared to give up on non-intervention. By the end of July, the committee was in deadlock, and the aims of a successful outcome to the Spanish Civil War was looking unlikely for the Republic.The English Historical Review (1975). p. 104. Unrestricted Italian submarine warfare began on 12 August. The British Admiralty believed that a significant control effort was the best solution to attacks on British shipping.The English Historical Review (1975). p. 105. The committee decided that naval patrols did not justify the expense and would be replaced with observers at ports.Thomas (1961). p. 467. The Conference of Nyon was arranged by the British for all parties with a Mediterranean coastline, despite appeals by Italy and Germany for the committee to handle piracy and the other issues that the conference was to discuss.Thomas (1961). pp. 475–6. It decided for French and British fleets to patrol the areas of sea west of Malta and to attack any suspicious submarines.Thomas (1961). p. 476. Also, warships that attacked neutral shipping would be attacked.Thomas (1961). p. 477. Eden claimed that non-intervention had stopped a European war. The League of Nations reported on the Spanish situation by noting the \\"failure of non- intervention\\". On 6 November, the plan to recognise the Nationalists as belligerents, once significant progress had been made, was finally accepted.Thomas (1961). p. 502. The Nationalists accepted on 20 November and the Republicans on 1 December. On 27 June, Maisky agreed to send two commissions to Spain to enumerate foreign volunteer forces and to bring about their withdrawal. The Nationalists, wishing to prevent the fall of the sympathetic British government led by Neville Chamberlain, were seen to accept the plan.Thomas (1961). p. 542. National non-intervention =United Kingdom and France= Plaque honouring the British soldiers of the International Brigades who died while they defended the Spanish Republic at the monument on Hill 705, Serra de Pàndols. The British government proclaimed neutrality, and its foreign policy was to prevent a major war by appeasement of Italy and Germany. British leaders believed that the Spanish Republican government was the puppet of extreme-left socialists and communists. Accordingly, the British Cabinet adopted a policy of benevolent neutrality towards the military insurgents, a covert aim being to avoid any direct or indirect help to the Republic. Public opinion was divided, with a clear majority demanding another major war to be avoided. The British establishment was strongly anticommunist and so tended to prefer a Nationalist victory. However, Popular Front elements on the left strongly favoured the Republican cause.Tom Buchanan, Britain and the Spanish Civil War (Cambridge UP, 1997). The ambassador to Spain, Sir Henry Chilton, believed that a victory for Franco was in Britain's best interests and so worked to support the Nationalists. British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden publicly maintained the official policy of non-intervention but privately expressed a preference for a Nationalist victory. Eden also testified that his government \\"preferred a Rebel victory to a Republican victory\\".Podmore p7 Admiral Lord Chatfield, the British First Sea Lord in charge of the Royal Navy, was an admirer of Franco, and the Royal Navy favoured the Nationalists during the conflict.Beevor (2001) As well as permitting Franco to set up a signals base in Gibraltar, a British colony, the British allowed the Germans to overfly Gibraltar during the airlift of the Army of Africa to Seville. The Royal Navy also provided information on Republican shipping to the Nationalists, and was used to prevent the Republican navy shelling the port of Algeciras. The German chargé d'affaires reported that the British were supplying ammunition to the Republicans. During the fighting for Bilbao, the Royal Navy supported the Nationalist line that the River Nervión was mined and told British shipping to keep clear of the area, but it was badly discredited when a British vessel ignored the advice, sailed into the city and found that the river was unmined, just as the Republicans had claimed. However, the British government discouraged activity by its ordinary citizens supporting either side. The Labour Party was strongly for the Republicans, but it was heavily outnumbered by Conservative Party in the British Parliament.Alpert (1998) p.65 notes that rank-and-file members of the Labour Party may have been opposed to helping the Republic. the left in France wanted direct aid to the Republicans.Thomas (1961). p. 279.Alpert (1998). p. 46. The Labour Party would reject non-intervention in October 1937.Preston (2006). p. 143. The British Trades Union Congress was split since it had a strong anticommunist faction.Alpert (1998). p. 65. Both the British and French governments were committed to avoiding a second world war. France was reliant on British support in general. Prime Minister, Leon Blum, the socialist leader of the Popular Front, feared that support for the Republic would lead to a civil war and then a fascist takeover of France.Preston (2006). p. 144. In Britain, part of the reasoning was based on an exaggerated belief of both German and Italian preparedness for war.Alpert (1998). p. 59. The arms embargo meant that the Republicans' chief foreign source of matériel was the Soviet Union, and the Nationalists received weapons from Italy mainly and Germany. The last Spanish Republican prime minister, Juan Negrín, hoped that a general outbreak of war in Europe would help his cause by compelling Britain and France to help the Republic at last. Ultimately, neither Britain nor France intervened to any significant extent. The British supplied food and medicine to the Republic but actively discouraged Blum and his French government from supplying weapons. Claude Bowers, the US ambassador to Spain, was one of the few ambassadors friendly to the Republic. He later condemned the Non-Intervention Committee by saying that each of its moves had been made to serve the cause of the rebellion: \\"This committee was the most cynical and lamentably dishonest group that history has known\\". Winston Churchill, who initially was an enthusiastic supporter of non-intervention, later described the workings of the committee as \\"an elaborate system of official humbug\\". Following the withdrawal of Germany and Italy from patrols, the French considered abandoning border controls or perhaps leaving non-intervention. However, the French were reliant on the British, who wished to continue with patrols. Britain and France thus continued to labour over non-intervention and judged it effective although some 42 ships were estimated to have escaped inspection between April and the end of July.Thomas (1961). p. 458. In trying to protect non-intervention in the Anglo-Italian meetings, which he grudgingly did, Eden would end up resigning from his post in the British Foreign Office.Thomas (1961). p. 514. On 17 March 1938, Blum reopened the French border to arms traffic, and Soviet arms flowed in to the Republicans in Barcelona. Britain and France officially recognized the Nationalist government on 27 February 1939.Thomas (1961). p. 583. Labour leader Clement Attlee criticised the way it had been agreed, calling it \\"a gross betrayal... two and a half years of hypocritical pretense of non-intervention\\".Thomas (1961). p. 584. =United States= The flag of an unidentified unit of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. When the Spanish Civil War erupted, US Secretary of State Cordell Hull followed American neutrality laws and moved quickly to ban arms sales to both sides. On 5 August 1936, the United States had made it known that it would follow a policy of non-intervention but failed to announce it officially.Thomas (1961). p. 260. Five days later, the Glenn L. Martin Company enquired whether the government would allow the sale of eight bombers to the Republicans; the response was negative. The United States also confirmed it would not take part in several mediation attempts, including by the Organization of American States. US President Franklin Roosevelt initially ruled out US interference publicly with these words: \\"[there should be] no expectation that the United States would ever again send troops or warships or floods of munitions and money to Europe\\".Thomas (1961). p. 334. However, he privately supported the Republicans and was concerned that a Nationalist victory would lead to more German influence in Latin America.Tierney, p.83 On 6 January 1937, the first opportunity after the winter break, both houses of the US Congress passed a resolution banning the export of arms to Spain.Thomas (1961). p. 338.It passed by 81-0 in the US Senate and 406-1 in the US House of Representatives. (Thomas (1961). p. 338.) Those against the bill, including American socialists, communists, and even many liberals, suggested that the export of arms to Germany and Italy should be halted as well under the Neutrality Act of 1935 since foreign intervention was a state of war in Spain. Hull continued to doubt the extent of German and Italian operations, despite evidence to the contrary.Thomas (1961). p. 339. In 1938, as the tide had turned against the Loyalists, Roosevelt attempted to bypass the embargo and ship American aircraft to the Republic via France. The embargo did not apply to nonmilitary supplies, such as oil, gas, or trucks. The US government could thus ship food to Spain as a humanitarian cause, which benefited mostly the Loyalists.Tierney, p.123 Some American businesses supported Franco. The automakers Ford, Studebaker and General Motors sold a total of 12,000 trucks to the Nationalists. The American-owned Vacuum Oil Company in Tangier refused to sell to Republican ships and at the outbreak of the war. The Texas Oil Company rerouted oil tankers headed for the Republic to the Nationalist- controlled port of Tenerife and illegally supplied gasoline on credit to Franco. Despite being fined $20,000, the company continued its credit arrangement until the war ended. The Nationalist spent almost $1 million a month on tires, cars and machine tools from American companies between 1937 and 1938.Tierney, p.68 After the war had ended, José María Doussinague, an undersecretary at the Spanish Foreign Ministry, stated that \\"without American petroleum and American trucks, and American credit, we could never have won the Civil War\\".Beevor, p.138 After the war, several American politicians and statesmen identified the US policy of isolation as disastrous.Preston (2004) p. 145.Tierney, pp. 5, 139 That narrative changed during the Cold War, when Franco was viewed as an ally against the Soviet Union.Tierney, p.150 Support for Nationalists =Italy= Republican propaganda poster stating, \\"The claw of the Italian invader intends to enslave us\\". The Italians provided the \\"Corps of Volunteer Troops\\" (Corpo Truppe Volontarie). The use of the troops supported political goals of the German and Italian fascist leaderships, tested new tactics and provided combat experienc so that troops would be prepared for any future war.Brian R. Sullivan, \\"Fascist Italy's military involvement in the Spanish Civil War\\", Journal of Military History (1995) 59#4 pp 697–727. The Italian contribution amounted to over 70,000 to 75,000 troops at the peak of the war. The involvement helped to increase Mussolini's popularity. The Italian military aid to Nationalists against the anticlerical and anti-Catholic atrocities that were committed by the Republicans was exploited by Italian propaganda targeting Catholics. On July 27, 1936 the first squadron of Italian airplanes, sent by Mussolini, arrived in Spain.Sullivan, \\"Fascist Italy's military involvement in the Spanish Civil War,\\" Journal of Military History (1995) Volume 59 Issue 4 pp 697–727. The government of Fascist Italy participated in the conflict by a body of volunteers from the ranks of the Italian Royal Army (Regio Esercito), Royal Air Force (Regia Aeronautica) and the Royal Navy (Regia Marina), which were formed into an expeditionary force, the Corps of Volunteer Troops (Corpo Truppe Volontarie, CTV). The maximum number of Italians in Spain fighting for the Nationalists, was 50,000 in 1937.Thomas (1961) p.634. Probably, a total of 75,000 Italians fought in Spain for the Nationalists.Thomas (1986), p. 985 Italians also served in the Spanish-Italian Flechas Brigades and Divisions. The airborne component of Aeronautica pilots and ground crew were known as \\"Aviation Legion\\" (Aviazione Legionaria) and the contingent of submariners as Submarine Legion (Sottomarini Legionari). About 6,000 Italians are estimated to have died in the conflict. The New York Times correspondent in Seville, Frank L. Kluckhohn, reported on 18 August that \\"the presence of the Italian destroyer Antonio da Noli here means that an ally has come to help the insurgents\\".Gannes, Harry and Repard, Theodore.

London 1936 Mussolini sent massive material aid to Italian forces in Spain that included: *one cruiser, four destroyers, and two submarines; *763 aircraft, including 64 Savoia-Marchetti SM.81 bombers, at least 90 Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 bombers, 13 Br.20 bombers, 16 Ca.310 bombers, 44 assault planes, at least 20 seaplanes, more than 300 Fiat CR.32 fighters, 70 Romeo 37 fighters, 28 Romeo 41 fighters and 10 other fighter planes, and 68 reconnaissance planes; *1,801 artillery pieces, 1,426 heavy and medium mortars, 6,791 trucks, and 157 tanks; *320,000,000 small arms cartridges, 7,514,537 artillery rounds, 1,414 aircraft motors, 1,672 tons of aircraft bombs and 240,747 rifles.Thomas (1961) pp 634 & 635. Also, 91 Italian warships and submarines participated in and after the war, sank about 72,800 tons of shipping and lost 38 sailors killed in action. Italy presented a bill for £80,000,000 ($400,000,000) in 1939 prices to the Francoists.Thomas (1961) p. 635. Italian pilots flew 135,265 hours during the war, partook in 5,318 air raids, hit 224 Republican and other ships, engaged in 266 aerial combats reported to have shot down 903 Republican and allied planes and lost around 180 pilots and aircrew killed in action. =Germany= Despite the German signing of a non-intervention agreement in September 1936, various forms of aid and military support were given by Nazi Germany in support of the Nationalists, including the formation of the Condor Legion as a land and air force, with German efforts to fly the Army of Africa to Mainland Spain proving successful in the early stages of the war. Operations gradually expanded to include strike targets, and there was a German contribution to many of the war's battles. The bombing of Guernica, on 26 April 1937, would be the most controversial event of German involvement, with perhaps 200 to 300 civilians killed.http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6583639.stm The legacy of Guernica German involvement also included Operation Ursula, a U-boat undertaking and contributions from the Kriegsmarine. The Condor Legion spearheaded many Nationalist victories, particularly in the air dominance from 1937 onward; 300 victories were claimed, as opposed to some 900 claimed by Italian forces.Westwell (2004). p. 88. Spain provided a proving ground for German tank tactics as well as aircraft tactics, the latter being only moderately successful. Ultimately, the air superiority, which allowed certain parts of the Legion to excel, would not be replicated because of the unsuccessful 1940 Battle of Britain.Westwell (2004). pp. 88–89. The training provided to Nationalist forces by the Germans would prove at least as valuable as direct actions. Perhaps 56,000 Nationalist soldiers were trained by various German detachments in Spain, who were technically proficient and covered infantry, tanks and anti-tank units; air and anti-aircraft forces and those trained in naval warfare.Westwell (2004). p. 87. Probably a total of 16,000 German citizens fought, mostly as pilots, ground crew, artillery men, tankmen, and military advisers and instructors. About 10,000 Germans were in Spain at the peak, perhaps 300 of which were killed. German aid to the Nationalists amounted to approximately £43,000,000 ($215,000,000) in 1939 prices.Thomas (1961). p. 634.Westwell (2004) gives a figure of 500 million Reichmarks. That was broken down in expenditure to 15.5% for salaries and expenses, 21.9% for direct delivery of supplies to Spain and 62.6% for the Condor Legion. (No detailed list of German supplies furnished to Spain has been found.) =Portugal= Emblem of the Portuguese volunteers \\"Viriatos\\". Upon the outbreak of the civil war, Portuguese Prime Minister António de Oliveira Salazar was officially neutral but favoured the Nationalists.Tom Gallagher. Portugal: a twentieth-century interpretation. Manchester, England, UK: Manchester University Press, 1983. Pp. 86. Salazar's Estado Novo held tense relations with the Republic since it held Portuguese dissidents to his regime.Filipe Ribeiro De Meneses. Franco and the Spanish Civil War. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2001. Pp. 96. Portugal played a critical role in supplying the Nationalists with ammunition and logistical resources.Antony Beevor. The Battle for Spain; The Spanish Civil War, 1936–1939. Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2006, pp. 116, 133,143, 148, 174, 427. Direct military involvement involved \\"semi-official\\" endorsement by Salazar of an 8,000–12,000-strong volunteer force, the \\"Viriatos\\". For the whole war, Portugal was instrumental in providing the Nationalists with a vital logistical organisation and by reassuring Franco and his allies that no interference whatsoever would hinder the supply traffic directed to the Nationalists that crossed the borders of the Iberian countries. The Nationalists even referred to Lisbon as \\"the port of Castile\\".Antony Beevor. The Battle for Spain; The Spanish Civil War, 1936–1939. Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2006. Pp. 116, 198. In 1938, with Franco's victory increasingly certain, Portugal recognized Franco's regime and, after the war in 1939, signed a treaty of friendship and non-aggression pact, the Iberian Pact. Portugal played an important diplomatic role in supporting Franco, including insisting to British government that Franco sought to replicate Salazar's Estado Novo and not Mussolini's Fascist Italy. =Vatican= Vatican City Among many influential Catholics in Spain, mainly composed of conservative traditionalists and people belonging to monarchist groups, the religious persecution was squarely blamed on the Republic. The ensuing outrage was used after the 1936 coup by the propaganda of the rebel faction and readily extended itself. The Catholic Church took the side of the rebel government and defined the religious Spaniards who had been persecuted in Republican areas as 'martyrs of the faith', selectively ignoring the many believing Catholic Spaniards who remained loyal to the Republic and even those who were later killed during the persecution and the massacres of Republicans. The devout Catholics who supported the Republic, included high-ranking officers of the Spanish Republican Army such as the Republican General Vicente Rojo Lluch, as well as the Catholic Basque nationalists who opposed the rebels.Stanley G. Payne. The Franco regime, 1936–1975. Madison, Wisconsin, USA; London, England, UK: University of Wisconsin Press, 1987, pp. 201. Initially the Vatican refrained from declaring too openly its support of the rebel side in the war, but it had long allowed high ecclesiastical figures in Spain to do so and to define the conflict as a \\"Crusade\\". Throughout the war, however, Francoist propaganda and influential Spanish Catholics labelled the secular Republic as \\"the enemy of God and the Church\\" and denounced it by holding it responsible for anticlerical activities, such as shutting down Catholic schools, killing of priests and nuns by exalted mobs and desecrating religious buildings.Juliàn Casanova. The Spanish Republic and Civil War. Cambridge University Press, 2010, pp. 139. Forsaken by the Western European powers, the Republicans depended mainly on Soviet military assistance, which played into the hands of the Nationalists, who portrayed the Republic as a \\"Marxist\\" and godless state in Francoist propaganda. Its only other official support was from the anti- Catholic and nominally-revolutionary Mexico. By means of its extensive diplomatic network, the Holy See used its influence to lobby for the rebel. During an International Art Exhibition in Paris in 1937 in which both the Nationalist and the Republican governments were present, the Holy See allowed the Nationalist pavilion to display its exhibition under the Vatican flag although the Nationalist flag was still not officially recognised.Antony Beevor, The Battle for Spain: The Spanish Civil War 1936–1939, By 1938, Vatican City had already officially recognised Franco's Spanish State and was one of the first countries to do so.Stanley G. Payne. The Franco regime, 1936–1975. Madison, Wisconsin, USA; London, England, UK: University of Wisconsin Press, 1987, pp. 156. Regarding the position of the Holy See during and after the war, Manuel Montero, a lecturer at the University of the Basque Country, commented on 6 May 2007:Manuel Montero a El País, 6/5/2007, «Otros \\"mártires\\" de la Guerra Civil» =Nationalist foreign volunteers= Volunteer troops from other countries fought with the Nationalists but only a few as national units. Among the latter were Eoin O'Duffy's 700-strong Irish Brigade and the 500-strong French Jeanne d'Arc company of the Spanish Foreign Legion, which was formed mostly from members of the far-right Croix de Feu. Also, 8,000 Portuguese, known as Viriatos, fought for Franco although never as a national unit. Another 11,100 volunteers from countries as diverse as Spanish Guinea, the Philippines, the United States, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Venezuela, Puerto Rico, Peru, Bolivia, Haiti, Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras, Ghana, Bolivia, Ecuador, Panama, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Suriname and Australia fought for the Nationalists.Othen, Christopher. Franco's International Brigades (Reportage Press, 2008) p217 In 1937, Franco turned down separate offers of national legions from Belgium, Greece, and exiled White Russians that had been made by foreign sympathisers.Othen, Christopher. Op cit. p177, p164, p139 Ion Moța, the Romanian deputy leader of the Legion of the Archangel Michael (or Iron Guard), led a group of seven Legionaries who visited Spain in December 1936 to ally their movement to the Nationalists by presenting a ceremonial sword to survivors of the Siege of Alcazar.Othen, Christopher. Op cit. p102 In Spain, the Legionaires decided, against the orders that had been given to them in Bucharest, to join the Spanish Foreign Legion. Within days of joining, Moța and Vasile Marin, another prominent Legionary, were killed on the Madrid Front at Majadahonda. After the extravagant and widely-publicised funerals of Ion Moța and Vasile Marin, they became a prominent part of the Legion's mythology. The Norwegian writer Per Imerslund fought with the Falange militia in the war in 1937. The British journalist Peter Kemp served as an officer with a Carlist battalion for the Nationalists and was wounded. =Irish volunteers= The St. Patrick's saltire flag of the National Corporate Party, an Irish fascist movement that dispatched the Irish Brigade to support the Nationalists and fight against the Republicans. Despite the declaration by the Irish government that participation in the war was illegal, around 700 of Eoin O'Duffy's followers (\\"The Blueshirts\\") went to Spain to fight on Franco's side. Both sides were former IRA members. On its arrival, however, O'Duffy's Irish contingent refused to fight the Basques for Franco since it saw parallels between its recent struggle and Basque aspirations of independence. It saw its primary roles in Spain as fighting against communism and for fascism and defending Catholicism. =International= Anticlericalism and the murder of 4,000 clergy and many more nuns by the Republicans made many Catholic writers and intellectuals cast their lot with Franco, including Evelyn Waugh, Carl Schmitt, Hilaire Belloc, Roy Campbell, Giovanni Papini, Paul Claudel, J. R. R. Tolkien and those associated with the Action Française. Others, such as Jacques Maritain, François Mauriac and Georges Bernanos, initially supported Franco but later grew disenchanted with both sides. Many artists with right- wing sympathies, such as Ezra Pound, Gertrude Stein, Wyndham Lewis, Robert Brasillach and Pierre Drieu La Rochelle voiced support for the Nationalists. Brasillach collaborated with Maurice Bardèche on his own Histoire de la Guerre d'Espagne and the protagonist in Drieu La Rochelle's novel Gille travels to Spain to fight for the Falange. Lewis's The Revenge for Love (begun 1934) details the anarchist-communist conflict in the years preceding the war and though it is not a Spanish Civil War novel, it is often mistaken for one. Other nationals *The Portuguese furnished about 8,000 troops for the Nationalists, known as Viriatos after the Viriatos Legion (Legião Viriato).Othen, Christopher. Op cit p.79 *About 500 Frenchmen fought for the Nationalists, most in the Jeanne d'Arc company of the Spanish Foreign Legion.Othen, Christopher. Op. cit. p.217 *Over 1,000 volunteers from other nations served in the Nationalist forces, including Filipinos, Britons, Finns, Norwegians, Welsh People, White Russians, Haitians, Americans, Mexicans, Belgians, Venezuelans, Puerto Ricans, Romanians and Turks. *An estimate 30,000-40,000 Latin Americans (from Peru, Colombia, Venezuela, Chile, Argentina, Puerto Rico, Brazil, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Honduras, Ecuador, Bolivia, Dominican Republic, El Salvador fought in the Nationalist ranks. They were religious catholics and they felt they were fighting a crusade or a reconquista against atheists, communists and anarchists. *Probably 75,000 Moroccan Arabs Regulares fought in the Nationalist ranks.Thomas (1986), p. 985. Spanish Morocco was then an independent protectorate and so the Moroccans were not Spanish citizens. They were feared by the enemy and the local civilian population because they spared no one and \\"killed everyone\\", according to an interview with a Moroccan veteran. According to Professor Balfour, \\"The Moroccan troops involved felt they were fighting a jihad against atheists and communists. Another motivation was money and gaining a foothold in the (Iberian) peninsula\\". *Despite its name, the Spanish Foreign Legion, which fought for the Nationalists, had mostly Spanish citizens.Thomas (1986), p. 94. Support for Republicans =Soviet Union= Due to the Franco-British arms embargo, the Republican government could receive material aid and purchase arms only from the Soviet Union. To pay for the armaments, the Republicans used US$500 million in gold reserves. At the start of the war, the Bank of Spain had the world's fourth-largest reserve of gold, about US$750 million, despite some assets being frozen by the French and the British governments. The Soviet Union also sent more than 2,000 personnel, mainly tank crews and pilots, who actively participated in combat, for the Republicans.Compass 1996 Other countries aided the Republicans by selling weapons and providing volunteer military units. Throughout the war, the efforts of the Republican government to resist the Nationalists and their foreign supporters were hampered by Franco-British 'non-intervention', the long supply lines and the intermittent availability of weapons of widely variable quality. The Franco-British naval embargo allowed Germany and Italy to reinforce their armies in Spain and hampered only Soviet efforts to arm the Republicans. According to an official Soviet source, more than 2000 Soviet citizens served in Spain, many of them being awarded the Soviet honours and 59 being awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union.История Второй Мировой войны 1939–1945 (в 12 томах) / редколл., гл. ред. А. А. Гречко. том 2. М., Воениздат, 1974. стр.54–55 The maximum number of Soviets in Spain at any time is believed to have been 700, and the total during the war is thought to have been between 2,000 and 3,000. Estimates for the pilots of Spanish Republican Air Force from the Soviet Union who took part in the conflict are given at 1,000.Thomas (1986), p. 984 The Republic sent its gold reserve to the Soviet Union to pay for arms and supplies. The reserve was worth $500,000,000 in 1939 prices.Viñas, A. (1976) \\"The Gold, the Soviet Union\\": pp.233 In 1956, the Soviet Union announced that Spain still owed it $50,000,000. Other estimates of Soviet and Comintern aid totaled £81,000,000 ($405,000,000) at 1939 values. The German military attaché estimated that Soviet and Comintern aid amounted to the following: *242 aircraft, *703 pieces of artillery, *731 tanks, *1,386 trucks, *300 armored cars *15,000 heavy machine guns, *500,000 rifles, *30,000 sub-machine guns, *4,000,000 artillery shells, *1,000,000,000 machine gun cartridges, *over 69,000 tons of war material, and *over 29,000 tons of ammunition.Thomas (1961) p. 643. Much of the material was purchased in France, Czechoslovakia, the United States, the United Kingdom and Mexico.Thomas (1961) pp. 636, 640–643, inclusive. The Republic was continuously swindled and shortchanged in its purchases.Howson, pp 109–110 The Republic also made poor choices in buying ammunition. The arms trade has a standard that with every rifle, 1,000 rounds of ammunition are included; with every machine gun, 10,000 rounds are included; and with every artillery piece, 2,400 shells are included to prevent the hardware from becoming useless by a lack of ammunition. However, many of the purchases fell far short of that standard.Howson, p 109 Soviet foreign policy considered collective security against German fascism to be a priority,Stone (1997). p. 137. and the Comintern had agreed a similar approach in 1934.Preston (2006). p. 136. It walked a thin line between pleasing France and not being seen to hinder both the world revolution and communist ideals. It was also the time of the first significant Soviet trials of the Old Bolsheviks. The Soviet press and opposition groups were entirely against non-intervention. =Mexico= The Mexican government supported fully and publicly the claim of the Spanish Republican government. Mexico refused to follow the non-intervention proposals of France and Britain. Mexican President Lázaro Cárdenas saw the war as similar as the Mexican Revolution although much of Mexican society wanted a Nationalist victory. Mexico's attitude was an immense moral comfort to the Republic, especially since major Latin American governments (Colombia, Brazil, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Haiti, Dominican Republic, Bolivia, Argentina, Chile and Peru) sympathised more or less openly with the Nationalists. However, Mexican aid could mean relatively little in practical terms since the French border was closed and the German, Italian and Portuguese dictators remained free to supply the Nationalists with a quality and a quantity of weapons that was far beyond the power of Mexico, which could furnish only $2,000,000 in aidThomas (1961) pp. 637–638. and provide only some material assistance, which included rifles, food and a few American-made aircraft, such as the Bellanca CH-300 and the Spartan Zeus, which had served in the Mexican Air Force. =France= On 21 August 1936, France signed the Non-Intervention Agreement.Alpert (1994). p. 43. However, Blum's government provided some aircraft to the Republicans by covert means. Potez 540 bomber aircraft (nicknamed the \\"Flying Coffin\\") by Spanish Republican pilots Dewoitine aircraft and Loire 46 fighter aircraft were sent from 7 August to December 1936 to Republican forces.Alpert (1994). pp. 46–47. The French also sent pilots and engineers to the Republicans.Werstein (1969). p. 139. Also, until 8 September 1936, aircraft could freely pass from France into Spain if they had been bought in other countries.Alpert (1994). p. 47. =Other countries= Research conducted by Gerald Howson after the collapse of the Iron Curtain showed that Poland was second, after the Soviet Union, in selling arms to the Republic. In the autumn of 1936, Poland was the only nation to offer arms to the Republic in any quantity, according to Howson. At the time, the Republic was in great need since the Nationalists were threatening Madrid.Howson, p 111 Other countries selling arms to the Republicans included Czechoslovakia and Estonia. Also, $2,000,000 came from the United States for humanitarian purposes. =International volunteers= American veterans displaying the brigade's banner in 1967 Volunteers from many countries fought in Spain, most of them on the Republican side. About 32,000Thomas (2001) p. 942 men and women fought in the International Brigades, including the American Lincoln Battalion and the Canadian Mackenzie–Papineau Battalion, which were organised in close conjunction with the Comintern to aid the Spanish Republicans. Perhaps another 3,000 fought as members of the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) and the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (POUM) militias. Those fighting with POUM most famously included George Orwell and the small ILP Contingent. While not supported officially, many American volunteers such as the Abraham Lincoln Brigade fought for the Republicans. \\"Spain\\" became the cause célèbre for the left-leaning intelligentsia across the Western world, and many prominent artists and writers entered the Republic's service. As well, it attracted a large number of foreign left-wing working-class men for whom the war offered not only idealistic adventure but also an escape from Great Depression unemployment. Among the more famous foreigners participating on the Republic's side was George Orwell, who went on to write about his experiences in Homage to Catalonia. Orwell's novel Animal Farm was loosely inspired by his experiences and those of other members of POUM at the hands of Stalinists when the Popular Front began infighting, and his experiences also inspired the torture scenes in his Nineteen Eighty-Four. Ernest Hemingway's novel For Whom the Bell Tolls was inspired by his experiences in Spain. George Seldes reported on the war for the New York Post. The third part of Laurie Lee's autobiographical trilogy, A Moment of War, is also based on his Civil War experiences. Norman Bethune used the opportunity to develop the special skills of battlefield medicine. As a casual visitor, Errol Flynn used a fake report of his death at the battlefront to promote his movies. In the Philippines, a pro-Republican magazine, Democracia, had writers, including antifascist Spaniards, Filipino-Spaniards and Filipino progressives such as Pedro Abad Santos, the chairman of the Socialist Party of the Philippines, and Bishop Gregorio Aglipay, of the Philippine Independent Church. International Brigades Polish volunteers fighting for the Republic. Probably 32,000 foreigners fought in the communist International Brigades An estimated 3,000 volunteers fought in other Republican forces during the conflict. Additionally, about 10,000 foreigners participated in medical, nursing and engineering capacities.Thomas (2001) pp 941–2 The International Brigades included 9,000 Frenchmen, of whom 1,000 died; 5,000 Germans and Austrians of whom 2,000 died and also about 3,000 from Poland. The second-highest number was from Italy with 3,350 men. Then came the United States (2,800 men with 900 killed and 1,500 wounded) and the United Kingdom (2,000 with 500 killed and 1,200 wounded). There were also 1,500 Czechs, 1,500 Yugoslavs, 1,500 Canadians, 1,000 Hungarians; and 1,000 Scandinavians (about half of whom were Swedes). The rest came from a \\"claimed\\" 53 countries, 100 Chinese, and 800 Swiss volunteered, 300 of whom would be killed. About 90 Mexicans participated,Thomas (2001) pp 942–3 and at least at least 80 Irish citizens. It has been estimated that between 3,000 and 10,000 of the volunteers were Jews, from various countries.Thomas (1961) p. 637. About 200 volunteers were from Palestine (of both Jewish and Arab origin). Approximately a third of Irishmen who fought for Republicans died, the group being primarily socialists, trade unionists, and former IRA members. The \\"Connolly Column\\" of the International Brigades was named after the Irish socialist leader who had been executed by the British after the 1916 Easter Rising, James Connolly. Patriotism invoked to oppose invader Patriotism was invoked by both sides, which presented the struggle as one of the Spanish people against foreign invaders. The instrumental use of nationalism by the Republican came from the communists. The heroic Spanish people said to be rising against foreign invaders, who were directed by traitors belonging to the upper classes, the clergy and the army, which were now at the service of the \\"fascist-imperialist world coalition\\". The \\"true\\" Spain was represented by the lower classes. Outside the \\"nation in arms\\" were bourgeois traitors, fascists, clergymen and \\"false revolutionaries\\" (dissident communists, radicals, anarchists etc.) who were \\"serving fascism\\". With the exception of the anti-Stalinist communists of the POUM, Nationalist rhetoric that was developed by the Communist Party of Spain soon extended to other left-wing and Republican literature. Republican propaganda made use of pre-existing icons that depicted foreigners in certain ways. The Italians were presented as effeminate, cowardly and presumptuous and the Germans as arrogant. The Foreign Legionnaires were presented as an international mob of criminals and thieves. Cartoons in the Republican press often depicted the rebel army as a multinational gang of foreign mercenaries. The presence of Moorish troops was exploited from the outbreak of the conflict, and Moorish troops were presented as black-faced, barefoot, hungry and eager to steal and kill: \\"The Moors were supposedly wild and cowardly, uncivilized and anxious to rape white women; the memory of the Reconquista, the centuries-long Spanish struggle against the Moors, was invoked. Only a few appeals during the first months of the war were aimed at convincing the 'Moorish proletarian brother' to desert\\". Spanish nationalist sentiment was used by the Loyalists to present the struggle as one for the patria (fatherland) and its Catholic essence, which stated to be under the threat of becoming a \\"Russian colony\\", the fault being of traitors and \\"international agents\\". \\"Anti-Spain\\" was embodied by liberalism, atheism, freemasonry, international Jewry and regional separatism. The communist invader was a dehumanised foreigner, the \\"wolves of the Russian Steppes\\". A legionnaire officer emphasised that the war was one \\"of Spaniards against Russians!\\" Francoist propaganda presented the enemy as an invading army or the puppet of foreign powers. The involvement of Moorish troops in a Catholic crusade was explained by the Nationalists as that of defenders of religion in the face of the godless, anticlerical, anti-Islamic and Jewish supporters of the Republic. Nationalists were forced to ignore Rif War propaganda, which had presented Moors as brutal and savage. The presence of Italian and German troops on the rebels' side was hidden as much as possible.'Nations in arms against the invader', Xose-Manoel Nunez Seixas, essay in The Splinterring of Spain, Cambridge University Press, 2005  Foreign correspondents  Foreign press coverage of the Spanish Civil War was extensive, with around 1000 foreign newspaper correspondents working from Spain.Preston, Paul.

Biography  = Philosophical production = Sgalambro did not have titles or degrees for business cards: how he became a writer of philosophy – whose books are translated into French, German and Spanish – is a mystery that he was not able to explain. Beginning In 1945 he worked jointly with the review Prisma (directed by Leonardo Grassi): the first writing is Paralipomeni all'irrazionalismo. In 1947 he matriculated at the University of Catania: From 1959 on along with Sebastiano Addamo, he wrote for the magazine Incidenze (founded by Antonio Corsano). His first article for the journal was Crepuscolo e notte (that has been printed again in 2011). In the intervening period of time, he wrote for the journal Tempo presente (directed by Nicola Chiaromonte and Ignazio Silone). In 1963, at the age of 39, he got married. The incomes coming from the citruses (heredited from his father) was not enough anymore, so he chose to integrate it by do a thesis for a degree and teaching at school. In the late 1970s he to organize his thoughts in systematic work. Then at the age of 55, he sent his first book, La morte del sole, to the editor Adelphi: In the following years, with the same editor, he published: Trattato dell'empietà, Anatol, Del pensare breve, Dialogo teologico, Dell'indifferenza in materia di società, La consolazione, Trattato dell'età, De mundo pessimo and La conoscenza del peggio e Del delitto. In the meanwhile, in the early 1990s, with some friends he established a small editorial activity in Catania: De Martinis. On the inside, Sgalambro managed pamphlets, publishing a pair of works (Dialogo sul comunismo and Contro la musica) and printed some operas by Giulio Cesare Vanini and Julien Benda. = Collaboration with Battiato = In 1993 he encountered Franco Battiato, accidentally, during the presentation of a common friend's poetry book. After few days, Battiato asked him to a meeting to propose to him the libretto for the opus Il cavaliere dell'intelletto about Frederik II of Hohenstaufen: From 1994 until his death he collaborated on almost everyone of Franco Battiato's projects. For him he wrote: * the libretti of the opera Il cavaliere dell'intelletto, Socrate impazzito, Gli Schopenhauer and Campi magnetici; * the lyrics of many pop music albums (L'ombrello e la macchina da cucire, L'imboscata, Gommalacca, Ferro battuto, Dieci stratagemmi, Il vuoto, etc.); * the screenplays of the movies Lost Love, Musikanten (about the last years of Beethoven's life) and Niente è come sembra, of the television transmission Bitte keine réclame and of the documentary Auguri don Gesualdo (about Gesualdo Bufalino). Starting in 1998 he penned song lyrics for Patty Pravo (Emma), Fiorella Mannoia (Il movimento del dare), Carmen Consoli (Marie ti amiamo) and Milva (Non conosco nessun Patrizio). In 2000 he published the single La mer, containing the cover of the famous song by Charles Trenet. In 2001 he published the album Fun club, produced by Franco Battiato and Saro Cosentino, containing evergreen songs like La vie en rose (by Édith Piaf) and Moon river (by Henry Mancini), but even the ironic Me gustas tú (by Manu Chao). In 2007 he lent his voice to the DC-9 airliner in Pippo Pollina's opera Ultimo volo (\\"Last flight\\"), about the 1980 loss of Itavia Flight 870 in the Ustica massacre. In 2009 he published the single La canzone della galassia, containing the cover of The galaxy song (taken from Monty Python's The meaning of life), sung with the Sardinian-English group Mab.

The film is an adaptation of the autobiographical chapters from the best selling 1993 book of the same name by radio personality Howard Stern, developed from a script written by Len Blum and Michael Kalesniko. It follows Stern's life from boyhood and his rise to success in radio. Stern and several of his radio show staff star as themselves, including newscaster and co-host Robin Quivers, producers Fred Norris and Gary Dell'Abate, and comedian Jackie Martling. The film also stars Mary McCormack, Allison Janney, and Paul Giamatti. After a proposed film featuring Stern as his superhero character Fartman fell through, development for a new film began in 1994, several months following the release of Private Parts. Stern signed with Rysher Entertainment, who agreed to fund it, and teamed with Reitman who thought a biographical take on Stern's life was best suited for a film. Production was delayed after Stern rejected 22 scripts from several screenwriters until he accepted one developed by Blum and Kalesniko in late 1995. Filming took place in the New York City area and Washington, D.C. from May to November 1996 with a budget of $28 million, during which Stern continued to host his radio show each weekday morning. Numerous celebrities and family members of the radio show staff make cameo appearances in the film. The soundtrack is formed of songs from several rock bands as well as two original tracks featuring Stern performing with Rob Zombie and the Dust Brothers. Released in the United States on March 7, 1997 by Paramount Pictures, Private Parts ranked at number one on the US box office in its opening weekend with a gross of $14.6 million. It grossed a domestic total of $41.2 million at the end of its theatrical run. It received mostly positive reviews from film critics, a group whom Stern made a conscious effort to please, including the public who did not listen to the radio show or were not fans of his. In 1998, the film was released on DVD and Stern won a Blockbuster Award for Favorite Male Newcomer for his performance. Stern shot additional scenes for a censored version of the film prior to its premiere television broadcast on the USA Network in 1999. Plot Following his appearance at the MTV Music Video Awards as his superhero character Fartman, radio personality Howard Stern boards his flight home and is seated next to Gloria who is visibly repelled by him. Stern, thinking she sees him as a moron, begins to tell his life story, starting with the verbal abuse he received as a boy from his father Ben. As a youngster, Stern dreams of being on the radio after visiting his father's recording studio and grows up to be a quiet, socially awkward teenager. He decides to work in radio and studies Communications at Boston University. He becomes a DJ at WTBU, the college station, and meets his girlfriend Alison. After graduating, Howard works at WRNW in Briarcliff Manor, New York and is promoted to program director, which allows him to marry Alison. He leaves after being asked to fire a fellow DJ and moves to WCCC in Hartford, Connecticut, where he befriends DJ Fred Norris. Howard adopts a more casual attitude on the air, becoming more open and upfront. He and Fred attend the premiere of actress Brittany Fairchild's new film. The three leave early for Fairchild's hotel room, where she strips for a bath and convinces Howard and Fred to join in. Brittany's behavior becomes more sexual, and an embarrassed Howard leaves. When Alison finds his wet underwear in their car and believes he has been unfaithful, she leaves him. Howard leaves Hartford for WWWW in Detroit, Michigan and is miserable, but Alison goes to Detroit and forgives him. WWWW then switches to country music, and Howard quits. Howard starts at WWDC in Washington, D.C. in 1981 and meets his news anchor Robin Quivers, whom he encourages to riff with him on the air. They refuse orders from boss Dee Dee for constantly breaking format. One of their antics, in which Howard assists a female caller to reach orgasm, almost gets him fired until a ratings boost forces Dee Dee to keep him and hire Fred to the team. Meanwhile, Alison announces her pregnancy, but it ends in miscarriage. Although they cheer each other up by joking about it, Howard makes light of the situation on the air, which greatly upsets Alison. With Alison pregnant again, Howard gets his dream offer to work in New York City at WNBC, where he has the chance to become a nationwide success. However, upper management at NBC hired Howard not realizing what his show was like until they see a news report about him. Program director Kenny \\"Pig Vomit\\" Rushton offers to keep Howard in line or he will force him to quit. Howard, Fred, and Robin ignore Kenny's restrictions on content until a risque Match Game with comedian Jackie Martling causes Rushton to fire Robin. The show fails in her absence and her replacement quits after Howard's interview with an actress who swallows a kielbasa sausage. Robin is eventually brought back, but Howard's antics continue with a naked woman in the studio, resulting in Kenny cutting off the broadcast. Howard gets the show back on the air and gets into a physical altercation with Kenny in his office. In 1985, Howard becomes number one at WNBC and Kenny tries to gain Howard's friendship but is turned down flat. Howard thanks his fans with an outdoor concert by AC/DC. During the performance, Alison is rushed to the hospital and gives birth to a daughter. Back on the flight, it is revealed that Howard has told his story to Gloria and believes he could get her, but stays \\"loyal\\" to Alison. He meets Alison at the airport and his daughters run to greet him. During the end credits, Stuttering John rants about his absence in the film. Mia Farrow then presents an Academy Award for Best Actor for Howard at the awards ceremony, who appears as Fartman once again, but Howard falls from mid-air and the audience applauds. Kenny is out of radio and now manages a shopping mall in Alabama and blames Howard for his downfall. During his outbursts, his swearing is drowned out by jackhammer noises.

He first announced the film, which Stern claimed \\"came from nowhere ... top of my head\\", during an appearance on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. That November, Variety reported that screenwriter J. F. Lawton was hired to write and direct the film titled The Adventures of Fartman. The film, which was budgeted between $8–$11 million, was expected to go into production in May 1993 with David Permut assigned as producer under his Permut Presentations banner. According to Lawton, The Adventures of Fartman revolved around the superhero and his alter ego, a magazine publisher in the mold of Screw magazine's Al Goldstein.Lawton directs Stern in wind-breaking film variety.com, November 25, 1992 On June 28, 1993, Lawton revealed more information for Time. \\"There's a lot of nudity, some harsh language, a lesbian love scene, and the main character works for an underground sex magazine. We told New Line Cinema the plot, and they said, 'Yeah, it sounds great. But can't we make it PG-13?'\\"Hollywood's Summer: Just Kidding Time Magazine, June 28, 1993 Soon after, Stern became unhappy with the idea of making a PG-rated film and had disputes with New Line Cinema over the merchandising rights. Coupled with the quality of the scripts being drafted, the project was shelved in 1993 before the production could begin. Its cancellation affected Stern, who became depressed as \\"I'd gone on air and said, 'I'm going to make a movie.' I sort of felt like a liar. I looked like I had failed.\\" =Development= A film project remained inactive until the release of Stern's first book, the part memoir and part commentary Private Parts, in October 1993. It became the fastest selling book in publisher Simon & Schuster's history after five days of release. In the following month, Stern's agent had started to contact film studios with the aim of adapting the book into a feature film. In the following months, Stern entered an agreement with film and television content management company Rysher Entertainment, who wished to provide funding for a film. This led to Stern working with Rysher founder Keith Samples, Paramount producer David Kirkpatrick, director John G. Avildsen in September 1994 and, in August 1994, screenwriter Peter Torokvei, who was hired to complete a \\"production rewrite\\" of a script already prepared. Torokvei claimed a set of line producers, production secretary, and film coordinators had \\"seemed to be in place\\" upon his arrival to New York City, but the project underwent the first of several delays over the film's story. Torokvei completed a draft, but it was not signed off. Stern, who had the power of final script approval, went on to reject around 22 subsequent revisions, sometimes from day to day, as he grew dissatisfied with their content. Torokvei estimated he had worked on as many as five redrafts with Stern, adding: \\"On any given scene we did the day before, [Stern] would say, 'That's old,' or 'That's boring.' He wanted to freshen the scenes every day. I'd have to remind him that it had worked the day before\\". In one abandoned version, Stern recalled a scene that had former radio show regular Richard Simmons \\"in a tutu in my house chasing my children and saying he can't baby-sit them. How fucking ridiculous.\\" Around this time, Kirkpatrick had mentioned a film with as many as 75 cameo appearances, including Arnold Schwarzenegger and radio show regular Jessica Hahn. In addition to Torokvei, assistance over the scripts were developed by Michael Kalesniko, co-author of Private Parts Larry \\"Ratso\\" Sloman, Laurice Elehwany, and Rick Copp. Kalesniko recalled a note that detailed Stern riding down Fifth Avenue on an elephant. He said that Kirkpatrick saw the film as an \\"Annie Hall for the nineties\\". Following several script rejections, Avildsen ceased his involvement with the film by November 1994. Kirkpatrick claimed Avildsen wished for a \\"story of an underdog taking on the issue of free speech—a man against the system, whereas Kirkpatrick had the idea of a film \\"in the tradition of Help! (1965) and A Hard Day's Night (1964)\\". Ivan Reitman, producer of the film. By February 1995, Stern had yet to approve a final script. The studio executives believed Stern rejected so many drafts was because he was too afraid to be in a feature film, and so suggested Jeff Goldblum to play as himself. Stern insisted he was not afraid, and felt the idea of someone other than himself playing the role would lead to \\"the biggest box office bomb in history\\". Following Avildsen's departure, Stern turned to producer and director Ivan Reitman for his thoughts on the rejected scripts as he thought Reitman \\"could see if I was being unreasonable\\". A long time fan of Stern's, Reitman had suggested to Stern that he make a film about his life as early as 1991 and pitched his vision, a biographical film with Stern starring as himself, \\"almost documentary in feel\\", as he believed one based on real events from his life, rather than \\"a fantasy life for him that was silly and salacious\\", were strong and funny enough for a film. Stern agreed, and subsequently asked Reitman to come on board as producer and help develop a script. Reitman focused on a script that centered more on what Stern was like off the air, and brought in writer Len Blum to help with the task and brought Kalesniko back into the fold; Blum was skeptical about working on the film because he did not understand Stern's appeal, but his opinion changed after Reitman brought him to New York City to sit in on Stern's radio show for two days. Blum said, \\"On the flight home I asked myself, 'Should I do this?' And I realized I had laughed harder in the last two days than I had in the past 20 years.\\" In the following months, Blum and Kalesniko collaborated on a script with Stern that he finally approved, which then underwent further revisions for Blum to incorporate Stern's improvisations and speech patterns. During his visit to the show, Blum talked to Quivers, Norris, Dell'Abate, and Melendez about how they first met Stern and recorded the conversations. In a November 1995 interview during promotion of his second book Miss America, Stern announced: \\"It's bizarre and funny. We're green-lighted to go into production\\". =Pre-production and casting= Auditions for roles began before Stern had accepted a final script. On October 8, 1994, auditions for actors to play \\"a pre-teen, mid-teen and late-teen Howard\\" were held at the Palladium in New York City. The sessions were organised by casting director Avy Kaufman. Auditions were also planned in Burbank, California, Chicago, and Cleveland. Four scenes for the actors were set up: Stern preparing for a date while reciting a soliloquy on the human condition, a talk with his father on current events, making a prank call, and attempting to hide the evidence after smoking in his bedroom. Subsequent casting was overseen by Phyllis Huffman. After the film was green-lit in 1995, Stern announced the start of pre-production during on radio show with Reitman and Thomas as guests, on February 13, 1996. Reitman estimated the process would last for ten weeks. Stern wished for Reitman to direct the film as well as produce it, but Reitman suggested Betty Thomas for the role after the two had wrapped up working on The Late Shift. Thomas was not a fan of Stern's, but her boyfriend was an avid listener and Reitman pushed her to read the script. She described it as \\"very interesting\\" and travelled to New York City to observe Stern doing his radio show. \\"After a while, Howard came out. When he took my hand, he was shaking. He was so vulnerable and scared. I couldn't believe it. I saw something in his eyes that I loved. Right then, I wanted to do the movie.\\" Stern found working with Thomas particularly enjoyable who collaborated well and had a calming effect on him during shooting. In April 1996, McCormack was cast as the role of Stern's wife Alison.Fleming, Mike. \\"Hollywood Buzz; McCormack Lands a 'Private' Part\\", New York Daily News, April 28, 1996. Stern had initial doubts about her, describing her as perhaps \\"too fancy\\", but Thomas insisted she was the right choice after their initial try out scene. Julia Louis-Dreyfus was an early choice, but she backed out because she wanted to spend time with her family. In June 1996, late-night talk show host David Letterman agreed to a cameo appearance for a scene that recreated one of Stern's appearances on Late Night with David Letterman on NBC. The show's stage and set was reproduced, but Letterman refused to wear a hairpiece that matched his hairstyle at the time.\\"Dave's Hair Off-Limits\\", Honolulu Star-Bulletin, June 10, 1996, page C-4. The film stars model Carol Alt as Gloria. Initially, Alt had little interest in appearing in the film because she wanted \\"to stay uncontroversial and classy\\" and avoid being associated with Stern's \\"crazy image\\", but she changed her mind after reading the script and later praised Reitman for its quality.Benza, A.J. and Michael Lewittes. \\"Hot Copy: Howard's beginning & end\\", New York Daily News, June 10, 1996. In June 1996, auditions were held in New York City for the role of Mandy, a part that had seven lines of dialogue with full frontal nudity.Benza, A.J. and Michael Lewittes. \\"Hot Copy: Auditioning for 'Parts', New York Daily News, June 12, 1996. As many as 25 women tried out for the role, including some who worked as topless dancers, but producers rejected all of them on the basis of their appearance or quality of acting.Benza, A.J. and Michael Lewittes. \\"Hot Copy: Howard faces Stern lawsuit; Private parting\\", New York Daily News, June 19, 1996. The role was given to porn star Jenna Jameson. Actor Richard Portnow secured the role as Stern's father Ben. Portnow met Ben in person, and picked up various idiosyncrasies from him which he incorporated into his acting, such as gesticulating his finger whenever he speaks. The film features actor Luke Reilly portraying Don Imus, a long time radio rival of Stern's who hosted mornings at WNBC. The woman who played Irene the Leather Weather Lady was the same person who called into Stern's radio show while he worked at WWWW in 1980 and is considered the first of Stern's radio show Wack Pack. During his preparation in acting as his younger self, Stern listened to tapes of his radio shows from his twenties, noticing his voice \\"locked in this very high register\\". At one point, Stern asked Thomas if he should take acting lessons before filming, and watched a \\"how-to\\" video by Michael Caine that Thomas had given him. =Filming= Silvercup Studios in New York City, one of the filming locations. Principal photography began on May 2, 1996, with Northern Lights Productions in charge of filming. Shooting took place in several locations–Westchester, New York, Washington, D.C., New Jersey, and the Manhattan, the Bronx, Queens, and Brooklyn areas of New York City. Interior shots were filmed at Silvercup Studios in Long Island City. Stern would do his radio show from 6:00 a.m. until around 10:30 a.m. and travel to the set straight after to resume shooting. Make up would last three to four hours, followed by filming until as late as 9:00 p.m. At one point, filming only took place from Thursday to Monday and lasted until 11:00 p.m. A temporary apartment was built on the Silvercup lot for Stern to live in while shooting took place in order to remove the need for him to commute to and from his family home in Long Island. Interior scenes, including the reconstruction of seven replica radio studios where Stern worked in his career, were reconstructed at the Silvercup. Stern requested that he operate real and working radio equipment in the replica studios so he could hear himself talk. The scenes at WRNW were filmed in the same building that housed the real radio station in Briarcliff Manor, New York. The scene with Stern working at WWWW as Hopalong Howie was the first to be filmed. He recalled he had \\"no confidence\\" in his ability at that point and struggled with the concept of shooting a film to a set script. It took three days for Stern to settle down; Thomas noticed Stern during this time was \\"a little tight, trying too hard\\". Reitman noticed a considerable improvement in Stern's acting after several weeks of filming as he became more comfortable in front of the camera. Portnow noticed Stern enjoyed the process as filming went along, picking up \\"mechanics of doing take after take very quickly\\" and the ease of altering his delivery of lines in different ways. The scenes inside the plane with Alt were shot inside a Lockheed L-1011 TriStar parked at Newark Liberty International Airport. For the scenes that featured a young Stern in high school, filming was done at Union High School, which comedian Artie Lange, who was part of the radio show from 2001 to 2009, graduated from. Several scenes during Stern's college years were filmed at Lehman College in the Bronx. A metal stunt penis was placed in Stern's trousers to create the illusion of an erection during the film premiere screening scene. The night when Stern meets Alison for the first time in Boston was shot at the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn. Northern Lights offered nearby residents three-day parking vouchers in nearby lots to encourage them to move their cars. Stern recalled that porn star Jenna Jameson was so comfortable being naked on the set, she stayed without clothes when the crew were at the craft service table. Stern was a regular guest on Late Night with David Letterman, and the studio wished to incorporate one of his appearances into the film. However, the studio could not obtain permission to use the footage, so Letterman agreed to take part in a reenactment. Stern donned several customised wigs throughout the film and never displayed his real hair. In the scene where Stern apologizes to McCormack at his hotel, actress Teri Hatcher had visited the set and was standing several feet away from the camera. Stern had difficulty in achieving a satisfactory reaction for the scene where he finds out that Alison is pregnant. Thomas assisted by approaching Stern and telling him that she had been diagnosed with ovarian cancer, which was in fact a lie. Stern's genuine response and shock to the news produced what Thomas was looking for, and Stern used that as a guide for his on-screen reaction. In one incident, McCormack started smoking a cigarette while wearing a pregnant costume which got several concerned looks from the public. The AC/DC concert scene was filmed at Bryant Park in July 1996. Filming was set to finish on July 30, 1996, but it was extended until mid- August. Following a wrap-up party held to commemorate the end of filming, Stern had a consultation booked for rhinoplasty in early September 1996 before he was to embark on the film's promotional tour. However, Thomas called him shortly beforehand to announce that several scenes had to be re-shot and a change in Stern's appearance would affect the film's continuity. Reitman then contacted Stern, informing him to avoid surgery until production was complete as Paramount owned his face. In October 1996, Stern flew to Los Angeles to view a rough cut of the film that was around 2-and-a-half hours in length, among a small audience in Reitman's personal theater. Around 45 minutes of footage was to be cut. Among the scenes that were filmed but not used included one filmed at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, where Stern and John Stamos were on stage dressed in just a towel covering their lower half, with women in the crowd of 800 people urging them to drop them.Rush, George, and Joanna Molloy. \\"Rush & Molloy: Surveillance\\", New York Daily News, July 11, 1996, page 14. A man found a collection of video tapes containing several dailies of the film in a recycling bin, and returned them to Stern. The final scenes were shot in New York City and Washington, D.C. over a three-day period from November 22, 1996. Stern did not announce the trip beforehand in order to prevent fans from disrupting filming. He announced, on November 25, that filming was complete. =Post-production= Thomas said the film was difficult to edit as Stern \\"never used the same words twice\\" for each take. During the Christmas period in 1996, the film was subject to a test screening in California. In January 1997, test screenings were held in San Jose, California and Seattle, Washington, the latter of which Stern's radio show was not syndicated to at the time. Stern was told the audience gave the film the highest positive response since Forrest Gump (1994) and one Indiana Jones film. =Music= Stern recorded his parts to \\"Tortured Man\\" in December 1996 with writing assistance from Martling and Norris. Release =Promotion= Stern underwent an extensive media tour to promote the film, appearing on several television shows and granting magazine and newspaper interviews. He was a cover feature of Rolling Stone magazine for the second time in his career. Stern also appeared on the front covers of Movieline, Vanity Fair, MAD, Penthouse, Entertainment Weekly, and TV Guide. The tour included a visit to Los Angeles. Stern appeared at the end of an episode of Wheel of Fortune that aired on the same day as the premiere, giving host Vanna White flowers and a gift while plugging the film. =Theatrical run= Private Parts premiered in New York City at The Theater at Madison Square Garden on February 27, 1997. The star-studded event, attended by 4,200 people, included a live performance of \\"The Great American Nightmare\\" by Stern and Zombie, and Porno for Pyros on a stage built outside the venue. The film's theatrical wide release in the United States followed on March 7 to 2,138 theaters. In its opening weekend, it ranked first place in the North American box office with a gross of $14,616,333, averaging a gross of $6,836 per theater. Jungle 2 Jungle came in second place. In its second week, the film dropped to third place. The number of theaters screening the film rose in its third week to a peak of 2,217 before the number decreased to its low of 1,848 a week later. At the end of its theatrical run in the United States, the film grossed a total of $41,230,799, coming in as the 56th highest-grossing film of 1997 in the country. To promote the film in the European markets, Stern attended the 1997 Cannes Film Festival in Cannes, France on May 12. He appeared at the festival with two topless women and a 40-foot inflatable picture of himself placed on the shore by the event provided by Rysher. The balloon attracted French security who threatened to shoot it down before Rysher associates agreed to take it down. It was reinflated after French president Jacques Chirac left the event as he visited on the same day. In 2006, a poor-quality rough cut of the film was leaked on the Internet containing alternate dialogue and music, deleted scenes, and a different ending. Some of the deleted scenes, such as Stern being escorted out of the WNBC building, appeared in the film's original trailer and publicity materials before they were cut. =Reception= Private Parts received mostly positive reviews from critics. In a review for the Chicago Tribune, critic Gene Siskel gave the film three and a half stars out of five. He pointed out the \\"predictable\\" scenes of \\"lesbian jokes and toilet humor\\", but the \\"wonderful love story\\" between Stern and Alison is the most surprising aspect and preferred Stern's character off the air than the one on the radio. Siskel concluded his review by singling out the scenes of Stern courting Alison, his eagerness to have a baby, and his apology to Alison as \\"signature moments\\" of the film. Roger Ebert reviewed the film for the Chicago Sun-Times, giving it three stars out of four. He said that the film has enough to satisfy the diehard Stern fans and appeal to the general audience at the same time, and he praised Stern and Quivers for playing \\"convincing, engaging versions of themselves\\" in their feature film debut, something he claims even \\"seasoned actors\\" claim is difficult. Ebert noted Thomas's directing skills made the film play out like a film and not a series of filmed radio broadcasts. Todd McCarthy of Variety gave a positive review, calling the film \\"a lean, crisp and very entertaining picture.\\" On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 75% \\"Certified Fresh\\" rating, based on 53 reviews, with an average rating of 6.5/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \\"A surprisingly endearing biopic about the controversial shock-jock Howard Stern that is equally funny and raunchy.\\" Metacritic reports a score of 67 out of 100, based on 19 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". =Accolades= For his performance, Stern won the Blockbuster Entertainment Award for \\"Favorite Male Newcomer\\". The awards are given by the result of write-in votes from fans and Stern won by a wide margin. Stern was nominated for a Golden Satellite Award for \\"Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture – Comedy\\". He was also nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award for \\"Worst New Star\\". For her directing work, Thomas won the audience award at Karlovy Vary International Film Festival (1997). She was also nominated for Crystal Globe in Karlovy Vary which went, at the end, to Ma Vie en Rose by Alain Berliner. American Film Institute recognition: * AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Laughs – Nominated =Television broadcasts= In April 1997, the USA Network agreed to pay $7 million for the rights to air the film for nine years, from 1999. The editing featured on-air explanations from Stern for the pixelization and bleep censors required to air the R-rated film. Stern appeared in new taped segments in which he occasionally pauses the film to comment on it. USA premiered the film even though no alternate scenes had been filmed to replace the nudity nor had any alternate dialogue been recorded to replace the profanity for television broadcasts. The nudity was simply pixelized and the profanity bleeped. In 2007, VH-1 began airing this version. The film premiered in 1080 High Definition on Universal HD on March 11, 2008. =Home media= When the film was released on video, some store customers objected to the original cover featuring Stern with no clothes on. An alternative version of the cover was produced featuring Stern fully clothed.

The term gained popularity after Max Doerner's 1921 book The Materials of the Artist and Their Use in Painting: With Notes on the Techniques of the Old Masters However, Doerner made some conclusions about the usage by painters and Mischtechnik which today are no longer considered completely accurate.  Egg tempera  Mischtechnik can be a method of painting with egg tempera, used in combination with oil based paints and resins to render a luminous, resonant realism. The egg yolk of the egg tempera is a naturally occurring emulsion of water and oil. As such, the old masters found ways of extending the natural advantages of its emulsion to create lean, siccative, smoothly transitional, semi-transparent layers of paint. The visual effects created by working in the mixed technique essentially rely upon the phenomenon of light refracting through many subsequent layers of paint. One common approach is to transpose the main compositional elements of a value study onto a panel using India ink, then slowly build up volume by alternating egg tempera with an overall glaze of oil paints mixed with resin, producing a jewel-like effect. The technique can be very time consuming and demanding. It is unforgiving of pentimenti, yet full of delightful surprises, since many unexpected colors can naturally arise during the ongoing glazing process.  History  In the twentieth century artists such as Otto Dix, Ernst Fuchs and Egon von Vietinghoff, as well as Surrealist and visionary artists such as Philip Rubinov Jacobson, Brigid Marlin or Mati Klarwein, used the technique. Nicolas Wacker taught his own version of the technique at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris during the late 1960s and 1970s. Many contemporary painters credit their knowledge of the technique to him.

He originally called the collection Epistolarum mearum ad diversos liber (\\"a book of my letters to different people\\") but this was later shortened to the current title. Petrarch discovered the text of Cicero’s letters in 1345, which gave him the idea to collect his own sets of letters. It wasn't until four or five years later however, that he actually got started. He collected his letter correspondence in two different time periods. They are referred to as Epistolae familiares and Seniles. Epistolae familiares (a.k.a. Familiar Letters) was largely collected during his stay in Provence about 1351 to 1353, however was not ultimately completed until 1359 when he was in Milan. Petrarch had this collection of letters copied onto parchment in 1359 by a certain ingeniosus homo et amicus with another complete copy done in 1364. He added letters in 1366, bringing his first collection of letters to 350. He broke these down and sorted them into 24 volumes. This first collection of letters called Epistolae familiares were actually written between the years 1325 and 1366 (the first translation into English was done by historian James Harvey Robinson in 1898 in his book The First Modern Scholar and Man of Letters). In January 1350 Petrarch wrote a lengthy letter to his dear friend (\\"Socrates\\" as Petrarch liked to call him) dedicating the collection to him. He requests his friend to keep the letters safely out of sight of the censors and critics. Letters of Seniles Petrarch begun a second collection of letters in 1361, also known as Letters of Old Age. It contains 128 letters written between 1361 and 1373.JSTOR A New Fragment of Petrarch's Epistolae Seniles by K. V. Sinclair; Speculum, Vol. 40, No. 2 (Apr., 1965), pp. 323-325 It is also broken down and sorted into volumes (18 books). The final letter, the first and only of the 18th book is his incomplete Letter to Posterity. Some English translations of this collection of letters that are out of copyright are available heretranslation into English were done by historian James Harvey Robinson (New York: G.P. Putnam, 1898) in his book The First Modern Scholar and Man of Letters. A complete English translation is also available in two volumes from Italica Press, translated by Aldo S. Bernardo, formerly Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Italian and Comparative Literature, State University of New York at Binghamton.http://www.italicapress.com/index265.html Letters of interest *Letter to Posterity *Ascent of Mont Ventoux  Litterae variae  There are many letters that Petrarch lost or did not keep a copy of. Others he destroyed the originals of for fear they would bring much criticism to his larger collection. There is a collection of 59 of these letters by Giuseppe Fracassetti.  Sine nomine  This special set (Book Without A Name) of letters Petrarch was too fond of to let out of his hands of some nineteen letters was kept out of the main body of Familiar Letters to give respect to the papacy and the controversial lavish lifestyle practiced at Avignon. Liber sine nomine is an epitome of this same work in one volume without a title (which is 19 letters).

It is also the name of the narrow strait between the village and the island of Årø. It has a population of 314 (1 January 2020)BY3: Population 1st January, by urban areas The Mobile Statbank from Statistics Denmark and is part of the municipality of Haderslev and the regional entity Region of Southern Denmark, as well as the parish of Øsby. In spite of its slight size, Aarøsund has a significant part in Danish history. Archaeological surveys have shown the area to have been inhabited since the Iron Age with the occurrence of an abundance of flint tools suggesting an even earlier settlement here. In 1231 King Valdemar's cadaster mentions the King's sovereignty of the ferry route between Aarøsund and Assens on the island of Fyn. In 1640 the Royal Danish mail services decided on the Assens-Aarøsund ferry service - instead of the ferry service connecting Middelfart and Snoghøj - to be part of the most important, Danish postal route of its day, København- Hamburg. The ferry estate, situated close to the water front, has provided shelter for many a famous person waiting for a safe fare to Fyn, not least many Danish Kings. Hans Christian Andersen, the world-famous writer of fairy tales, noted his stays in Aarøsund in his travel diaries.Årøsund og H.C. Andersen (in Danish) At the end of the 16th century the Danish King, Christian IV, planned construction of a ship in Haderslev, but with the fjord being sanded up, he instead chose Aarøsund as the site of construction.T.O. Achelis: Haderslev i gamle dage Modersmaalets Trykkeri 1926 The landmark of the village is the lighthouse, seen here on the right. The current lighthouse was constructed during the German occupation of Sønderjylland 1864-1920, but the first lighthouse was set up as early as 1777.Årøsund fyrtårn (in Danish) Traditionally the village attracted scores of tourists in the summer, Danish and foreign alike (in particular German), due to its charming fishing village atmosphere, but numerous reconstructions of the harbour has left the waterfront less attractive than before. It is still, however, considered a prime site for fishing among anglers. A couple of kilometres south of the village itself Denmark's largest camping ground, Gammelbro camping, has room for around 900 guests. Aarøsund Badehotel is another, more luxurious option for an overnight stay. It was built in 1903, and underwent extensive renovation during the 1990s, meaning it appears virtually newly built. Scores of summer houses close to the beach and a newly established bed and breakfast () offer yet more options. A marina was constructed just north of the old harbour in 1988 and has a capacity of 151 boats. In conjunction with the marina an old train engine shed houses Aarøsund Bådebyggeri, a small ship yard that vows to good workmanship. The area is also home to a community center () and a fishing restaurant. Midway between the old harbour and the camping ground an old German bunker, constructed around the time of World War I, appears on the beach. During World War I, it formed part of \\"Sicherungsstellung Nord\\", a German line of 900 bunkers spanning the region of Sønderjylland, constructed to halt an eventual English invasion via the coast of Jutland. In the local dialect, Sønderjysk, the bunker is called \\"Æ Unnestan\\".

The site is located just north of Hardesty and east of Guymon in the Oklahoma Panhandle. The earthen Optima Lake Dam (National ID # OK20510) was completed in 1978 by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, with a height of 120 feet, and a length at its crest of 16,875 feet. Although designed to contain a maximum of 618,500 acre-feet of water, the lake never reached more than 5 percent of its capacity,Wahl, K & R. L.

Rapid declines in streamflow related to large-scale pumping from the High Plains Aquifer, also known as the Ogallala Aquifer, coincided with the completion of dam construction to make this lake a dramatic example of unanticipated environmental impacts. The US Army Corps of Engineers website states (emphasis in original): > \\"Visitors should be aware that the lake's level can be very low. Depending > on rainfall and evaporation rates, the lake may offer no water-based > recreation and may not be suitable for swimming, fishing, boating or other > activities.

History The project was originally included as part of the Flood Control Act of 1936, as modified by the Flood Control Act of 1950,Section 216 Initial Appraisal Report, Optima Lake, September 2010, US Army Corps of EngineersThe impact of Title II of Public Law 516-81st Congress, cited as The Flood Control Act of 1950, was that Optima had to be built in such a way as not to negatively impact Canton Lake, further downstream on the North Canadian River. The Arkansas River Basin section of the Act states with respect to Optima, “The Chief of Engineers is authorized to so design, construct and operate the Optima Reservoir, authorized by the Flood Control Act of 1936, as amended and supplemented, that, taken with the existing Fort Supply and Canton Reservoirs, there will remain at all times to the maximum extent practicable, conservation storage capacity in the Canton Reservoir authorized by existing law.” but planning and political wrangling delayed the start of construction until 1966. The intent was for the reservoir to fill primarily from the flow of the Beaver River, also known as the North Canadian River. Normal flow on the Beaver River, from 1937 to 1966, averaged 32.2 cubic feet per second. The river had occasional floods, including an October 1923 flood amounting to 109,000 acre-feet of water, and a September 1941 flood in which the Beaver's flow increased to 44,200 cubic feet per second. The river's most recent flow of significance was in October 1965 at 17,800 cubic feet per second. In the end the project was authorized for flood control, drinking and irrigation water in the relatively dry Oklahoma panhandle, recreation, and fish & wildlife conservation. The Guymon Chamber of Commerce, which enthusiastically backed the project, published a pamphlet that touted its expected virtues. The brochure forecast that the lake would be deep, and its arms would flood up to up Beaver River and along its tributary, Coldwater Creek. During the 12 years of construction by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, flow of the Beaver dropped. It was later recognized that, because the source of the Beaver was the underground Ogallala Aquifer, being the water table beneath far western Oklahoma and parts of seven other Western states, and because of increased pressure on said aquifer due to expanded irrigation and drinking water withdrawals, the river's flow was being reduced to a trickle. The $46.1-million project was completed in 1978. The dam was constructed as compacted earthfill embankment with gated outlet works and a 1,500-foot long uncontrolled saddle spillway. The top of the dam is at of elevation above sea level. The specifications put the top of the maximum pool at , the top of the flood control pool at , the top of the conservation pool at , and the top of the inactive pool at . The conservation pool was designed to hold 117,500 acre-feet of water, with 76,200 acre-feet designated to be available as a water supply. The flood pool capacity was designed for 229,500 acre-feet, while absolute maximum capacity of the lake was set at 618,500 acre feet. Regarding expected visitorship, the Corps remained optimistic in 1979 and declared, \\"The optimum visitation for the project is 600,000 annual visitors and will be reached in 2014.\\" But water flow in the Beaver, 1977–1987, averaged only 7 ft3/s, far less than the 32.2 ft3/s historical average. In the mid-'80s, the Corps began to recognize that the reduced flow of the Beaver was permanent and the reservoir was not going to fill: the maximum lake level was achieved May 31, 1980 at an elevation of 2722.90 feet, whereas the very bottom of the conservation pool was intended to be 2726.00 feet. Subsequently, the flow in the Beaver dropped even further. In the last five years (1989-1993) the U.S. Geological Survey could measure its current near Guymon, the Beaver's flow averaged less than one-fifth of 1 ft3/s.Actually .1864 of 1 cubic foot per second, calculated from the annual data at the U.S. Geological Survey Website waterdata.usgs.com, accessed 2017-05-23, using search parameters Surface Water, Historical Observations, Site Number, 07232500, Annual Statistics, checking the box for Discharge Cubic Feet Per Second, and submitting. The Corps formally closed the park in 1995 although the site remained open to the public. With funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, about 161 decaying structures including picnic enclosures, campsites, restrooms, dump stations and numerous power poles, were demolished by September 2010 for safety reasons. As of 2014, the project was receiving 2000 to 5000 visitors annually. A spending controversy erupted in 2009, when the Corps wanted to use $1.2 million of economic stimulus money to replace rotting guardrails on each side of the paved road across the top of the Optima Dam used by approximately 15 cars a day. Public criticism caused the Corps to instead gate and padlock the road at a cost of $1000. Per the Corps’ September 2010 Section 216 Initial Appraisal Report on Optima Lake, the Corps continues to spend approximately $160,000/year for annual inspections of dam structures, detailed inspections at 5-year intervals, and repairs as budgets allow. That same report indicates the existing dam structures (gate tower, stilling basin, uncontrolled spillway and outlet works) remain in operational condition. In the 1973 Environmental Impact Statement done by the Corps during the planning process, a “dry lake” option for the project was considered which would have provided for no water retention during normal periods, but would have created an area available as a flood containment pool in the event of abnormally large water events in the area. That concept for Optima was rejected in favor of an active water-containment reservoir, although the project as it currently exists is consistent with the “dry lake” option.As stated in the 2012 report, “Optima Lake regulates flow in the Beaver River at Beaver but does not sustain a water supply yield.” The Beaver does occasionally still carry off surface flooding after heavy rains, as in April 2016 when the river was flowing near Guymon for the first time in decades following two days of intense rains that caused Texas County to be declared a disaster area. The overall project included the Optima National Wildlife Refuge, run by the US Fish and Wildlife Service, being initially along Coldwater Creek—which has its confluence with the Beaver upstream from the dam-- and the Optima Wildlife Management Area, public hunting lands managed by the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation, initially along the Beaver. However, the decreased size of the lake itself has led to Optima National Wildlife Refuge being increased to , and the area managed by Oklahoma, including licensed Corps lands above and below the dam, increasing to .

Positive illusions are a form of self-deception or self-enhancement that feel good, maintain self- esteem or avoid discomfort, at least in the short term. There are three general forms: inflated assessment of one's own abilities, unrealistic optimism about the future, and an illusion of control.. The term \\"positive illusions\\" originates in a 1988 paper by Taylor and Brown. \\"Taylor and Brown's (1988) model of mental health maintains that certain positive illusions are highly prevalent in normal thought and predictive of criteria traditionally associated with mental health.\\" There are controversies about the extent to which people reliably demonstrate positive illusions, as well as whether these illusions are beneficial to the people who have them.... Types In the above-average effect, people regard themselves more positively than they regard others and less negatively than others regard them. Positive attributes are judged to be more descriptive of themselves than of an average person, whereas negative ones are judged to be less descriptive of themselves than of an average person.. Despite the fact that it is statistically impossible for most people to be superior to their peers, rather than being equally aware of ones strengths and weaknesses, people are more aware of their strengths and not very aware of their weaknesses. This effect has been widely recognized across traits. and abilities. including the different abilities of driving,. parenting,. leadership, teaching, ethics, and general health. This effect is also evident in memory; most people also tend to perceive their ability to remember as better than it actually is. The illusion of control is an exaggerated assessment of the individual's personal control over environmental circumstances such as the roll of dice or flip of coin. Optimism bias is a tendency for people to overestimate their likelihood of experiencing a wide variety of pleasant events, such as enjoying their first job or having a gifted child, and somewhat underestimate their risk of succumbing to negative events, such as getting divorced or falling victim to a chronic disease. This illusory nature of optimism is also evident in peoples' under-estimation of the time taken for a variety of tasks. Origins Like many forms of human perception, self-perception is prone to illusion. Positive illusions have been commonly understood as one of the apparent effects of self-enhancement, a desire to maximize the positivity of one's self-viewse.g., . and a function of boosting self-esteem. It might be due to the desire to see oneself more favorably relative to one's peers. These kinds of self-serving attributions seemed to be displayed by positive self-viewers only. In fact, the negative- viewers were found to display the opposite pattern.e.g., . Research suggests that there may be some genetic contributions to the ability of developing positive illusions. Early environment also plays an important role, in which people are more able to develop these positive beliefs in nurturing environments than in harsh ones. Alternative explanations involve dimensions like the easiness and commonness of the tasks. In addition, tasks that shifted attention from the self to the comparative target would stop people overly optimising. The cultural prevalence also has a significant role in positive illusions. Although it is easy to document positive illusions in individualistic Western cultures, people in collectivist East Asian cultures are much less likely to self-enhance and, indeed, are often self-effacing instead.. Most studies find that people tend to have inflated views of themselves. The research indicates that the relationship between people's self-evaluations and objective assessments is relatively weak. One explanation for this is that most people only have mild positive illusions. However, according to recent studies there is evidence that there are significant individual differences between the strength of positive illusions people have. Therefore, some people may have extremely inflated self-views, some mild and some very little and when examined across a population this effect appears weak.. Benefits and liabilities Positive illusions can have advantages and disadvantages for the individual, and there is a controversy over whether they are evolutionarily adaptive. The illusions may have direct health benefits by helping the person cope with stress, or by promoting work towards success. On the other hand, unrealistically positive expectations may prevent people from taking sensible preventive action for medical risks.. Research in 2001 provided evidence that people who have positive illusions may have both short term benefits and long term costs. Specifically, self-enhancement is not correlated with academic success or graduation rates in college. =Mental health= Taylor and Brown's Social Psychological Model of mental health has assumed that positive beliefs would be tied to psychological well-being, and that positive self-evaluations, even unrealistic, would promote good mental health. The reference to well-being here means the ability to feel good about oneself, to be creative and/or productive in one's work, to form satisfying relationships with other people and to effectively combat stress when necessary. Positive illusions are particularly useful for helping people to get through major stressful events or traumas, such as life-threatening illnesses or serious accidents. People who are able to develop or maintain their positive beliefs in the face of these potential setbacks tend to cope more successfully with them, and show less psychological distress than those less able. For example, psychological research shows that cancer survivors often report a higher quality of life than people who have never had cancer at all. This could be physiologically protective because they have been able to use the traumatic experience to evoke an increased sense of meaning and purpose. This relates to the concept of psychological resilience or an individual's ability to cope with challenges and stress. Self-enhancing was found to be correlated with resilience in the face of the 9/11 tragedy among participants either in or near the towers. People also hold positive illusions because such beliefs often enhance their productivity and persistence with tasks on which they might otherwise give up. When people believe they can achieve a difficult goal, this expectation often creates a sense of energy and excitement, resulting in more progress than would otherwise have been the case. Positive illusions can be argued to be adaptive because they enable people to feel hopeful in the face of uncontrollable risks. In addition, there seems to be a relationship between illusions and positive mood. Studies have found that the direction of this relationship is that positive illusions cause positive mood states.e.g., . However, more recent findings found that all forms of illusion, positive or not, were associated with more depressive symptomsSuch as or . and various other studies reject the link between positive illusions and mental health, well-being or life satisfaction, maintaining that accurate perception of reality is compatible with happiness.Such as , and . When studying the link between self-esteem and positive illusions, identified a group which possessed high self-esteem without positive illusions, and that these individuals weren't depressed, neurotic, psychotic, maladjusted nor personality disordered, thus concluding that positive illusions aren't necessary for high self-esteem. Compared to the group with positive illusions and high self-esteem, the nonillusional group with high self-esteem was higher on self-criticism and personality integration and lower on psychoticism.. A meta-analysis of 118 studies including 7013 subjects found that slightly more studies supported the idea of depressive realism, but these studies were poorer in quality, used non-clinical samples, were more readily generalized, used self-reports instead of interviews and used attentional bias or judgment of contingency as a method of measuring depressive realism, as methods such as recall of feedback and evaluation of performance showed results counter to depressive realism. Another recent meta- analysis supports Taylor and Browns central claim. Its results indicate that different forms of self-enhancement are positively linked to personal adjustment (high subjective well-being and low depressiveness). Self- enhancement was not only linked to self-ratings of personal adjustment, but also to adjustment ratings made by informants (including clinical experts). Furthermore, self-enhancement was also a longitudinal predictor of personal adjustment. =Physical health= Apart from having better psychological adjustment with more active coping, the ability to develop and sustain positive beliefs in the face of setbacks has its health benefits. Research with men who had the HIV virus, or already diagnosed with AIDS has shown that those who hold unrealistically positive assessments of their abilities to control their health conditions take longer to develop symptoms, experience a slower course of illness, as well as other positive cognitive outcomes, such as acceptance of the loss. =Potential liabilities= There are several potential risks that may arise if people hold positive illusions about their personal qualities and likely outcomes. First of all, they might set themselves up for unpleasant surprises for which they are ill-prepared when their overly optimistic beliefs are disconfirmed. They may also have to tackle the consequences thereafter. However, research suggests that, for the most part, these adverse outcomes do not occur. People's beliefs are more realistic at times when realism serves them particularly well: for example, when initially making plans; when accountability is likely or following negative feedback from the environment. Following a setback or failure, all is still not lost, as people's overly positive beliefs may be used again in a new undertaking.. A second risk is that people who hold positive illusions will set goals, or undertake courses of actions which are more likely to produce failure than success. This concern appears to be largely without basis. Research shows that when people are deliberating future courses of actions for themselves, such as whether to take a particular job or go to graduate school, their perceptions are fairly realistic, but they can become overly optimistic when they turn to implementing their plans. Although there is no guarantee that one's realistic prediction would turn out to be accurate, the shift from realism to optimism may provide the fuel needed to bring potentially difficult tasks from conception to fruition. A third risk is that positive self- perceptions may have social costs. A specific source of evidence of the self- serving pattern in ability assessment examined the use of idiosyncratic definitions of traits and abilities. The authors suggested that the social costs occur when one's definition of ability is perceived to be the only one relevant to achievement outcomes. In other words, wherever people fail to recognise when other plausible definitions of ability are relevant for success, estimates of their future well-being will be overstated. A fourth risk is that it may be harmful to realize that one's actual competence does not match up to their illusions. This can be harmful to the ego and result in actually performing worse in situations such as college. Although positive illusions may have short-term benefits, they come with long-term costs. Positive illusions have been linked with decreasing levels of self-esteem and well-being, as well as narcissism and lower academic achievement among students.; ; . Negative counterparts Although more academic attention has focused on positive illusions, there are systematic negative illusions that are revealed under slightly different circumstances. For example, while college students rate themselves as more likely than average to live to 70, they believe they are less likely than average to live to 100. People regard themselves as above average on easy tasks such as riding a bicycle but below average on difficult tasks like riding a unicycle. as cited in . In 2007 Moore named the latter effect the \\"worse-than-average effect\\".. In general, people overestimate their relative standing when their absolute standing is high and underestimate it when their absolute standing is low. Mitigation Depressive realism suggests that depressed people actually have a more realistic view of themselves and the world than mentally healthy people. The nature of depression seems to have its role in diminishing positive illusions. For example, individuals who are low in self-esteem, slightly depressed, or both, are more balanced in self-perceptions. Likewise, these mildly depressed individuals are found to be less vulnerable to overestimations of (their) control over events and to assess future circumstances in biased fashion. However, these findings may not be because depressed people have fewer illusions than people who are not depressed. Studies such as show that depressed people believe they have no control in situations where they actually do, so their perspection is not more accurate overall. It might also be that the pessimistic bias of depressives results in \\"depressive realism\\" when, for example, measuring estimation of control when there is none, as proposed by . Also, and found that when replicating Alloy and Abramson's findings the overestimation of control in nondepressed people only showed up when the interval was long enough, implying that this is because they take more aspects of a situation into account than their depressed counterparts. Two hypotheses have been stated in the literature with regard to avoiding the drawbacks of positive illusions: firstly by minimising the illusions in order to take the full advantage of the benefits,. and secondly through making important decisions. According to Roy Baumeister, a small amount of positive distortion may be optimal. He hypothesizes that those who fall within this optimal margin of illusion may provide for the best mental health.

Lee Ermey. It is a remake of the 2003 film Midsommer. Plot Teenager Megan (Elisabeth Harnois), still distraught over her twin sister Sophie's suicide, reluctantly agrees to join her friends on a summer trip to a lake house in the bayous of Louisiana. On the way at a gas station, they meet Nick (Tyler Hoechlin), who provides the group with information on voodoo and other local superstitions. As soon as they arrive at the house, Megan suspects Sophie is trying to communicate with her, as a solstice — the time when our world and the next are closest — approaches. Megan goes running and trips, splitting her nail (something she had foreseen in several nightmares). As she limps back to the house, she meets a suspicious local resident, Leonard (R. Lee Ermey); inside his van, she finds a hat identical to one Sophie had owned. The night before the solstice, Nick joins the group at the house for dinner. Megan tells him about Sophie's key chain, something she is trying to get rid of but it keeps returning, and that she thinks she is being haunted by Sophie's lost ghost. The six of them later go swimming and Nick calls for any spirits with wine; Megan is dragged under the water. Megan then, advised by Nick, wraps the key chain in a white cloth and buries it outside, which he says should expel the spirit. She goes for a bath, finding mud running out of the taps, and then sees the key chain lying on the floor. The following day, Megan goes to Leonard's house and, inside, finds a young girl's bedroom (presumably his daughter); newspaper cuttings explain a young girl called Malin disappeared from the town a year earlier. Megan realises she is being haunted by Malin, not Sophie. Megan takes Nick to where she tripped on her run, followed by the group of friends, including Christian (Shawn Ashmore) who brings a gun. Nick and Megan get split up, and Christian almost shoots Nick. Megan then digs up Malin's body and finds that the key on the key chain is for Malin's bicycle, which was buried with her. They call the local police. Christian finally admits that the year before, when they all came to the lake house without Megan, he and Sophie were on a drive and accidentally hit Malin. In fear of being arrested, they buried her in the forest, and Sophie later committed suicide as she could not bear the guilt. Malin's ghost appears, and Christian runs away towards the road. Megan chases him through the forest but before she can reach him, he is hit by the police car that had been called out. The ending shows Megan at Malin's grave. When Leonard arrives home, he finds Malin's key chain on the porch, put there by Megan. Megan and Nick decide to go to the city together to start a life together.

It had a theatrical release on June 19 in Russia, and a US television debut on Lifetime Television on July 26, before release in South Korea, Netherlands, Italy, the United Kingdom, Iceland and Mexico. Critical response Solstice has received mixed reviews from its continued worldwide release. Don Sumner of Best Horror Movies felt the production values were comparable with large-budget films and that both the story and performances were believable and genuine, making the film interesting enough to keep the viewer's attention. However, he also felt that the expected scares and suspense might make for an argument that the film was not a horror and was actually a ghostly drama/thriller. Bloody Disgusting felt that the music score was the only highlight in an otherwise boring film, granting that as a remake of the Danish film Midsommer, where the story, overused locale, etc. could not be attributed to Myrick or the other new writers, it is wondered why the choice was made to not make it more interesting, as even the feeling of danger was not present. Dread Central also found the pacing to be lagging when they wrote \\"The pacing of Solstice drags the viewer to the finish line nearly half asleep\\". And in referring to director Daniel Myrick, \\"Coming from a guy whose body of work has been anything but cookie-cutter, Solstice disappoints with its surprising blandness and heavy-handed mediocrity.\\" E-Splatter was also disappointed in Myrick's work, comparing it negatively to The Blair Witch Project and writing that it was \\"a bit of a bummer to see the filmmaker behind such a kick-ass movie helming a direct-to-video horror film that's as tame as this. As reviled as it was by some horror fans, 'The Blair Witch Project' definitely had an edge. This film absolutely, positively has none.\\" Home media The film was first released to DVD on January 1, 2008 in the US with a commentary track by the director.

History  Built in 1663 as one of the first major structures the Swedish Navy constructed on the island, the length of the building still reflects its original use as a rope walk (repslagarbana), a building where strands were stretched out to be twined into ropes (the length of the building thus being of strategic importance). It took ten years to build but only four years before it was devastated in a fire, and, because the Navy was relocated to Karlskrona in 1680, it was never used for the original purpose again. During the fatale year 1697 the building was used to accommodate beggars and homeless, only to be ravaged by the fire at the Palace Tre Kronor within a few days. King Charles XII two years later ordered his architect Nicodemus Tessin the Younger to redesign the wrecked building into stables for his bodyguards, troops mostly used on the battlefields. However the stables remained mostly unused and Tessin had to redesign the building into an arsenal in the 1720s. In summer 1731, parts of the building were used for a short period to house the lions and tigers of King Frederick I, after which the building was called Fredriks lejonkula (\\"Fredericks lion lair\\") for many years. A storey was added in 1855 and another in 1916 over the northern part used by the East-Asian Museum since 1963.

The same year the King confirmed to him the lands of Horshopcleuch in the barony of Lammermuir, Berwickshire, which had been forfeited by Archibald Douglas, 6th Earl of Angus. In 1542 a confirmation was made by Cardinal David Beaton of the grant of the lands, bailliary, and barony of Tyninghame, made earlier by James Beaton, Archbishop of Saint Andrews on 9 July 1535, to Robert Lauder of The Bass and the heirs male of his body.

At St. Andrews, on 1 May 1562, \\"a Letter\\" was made out to Robert Lauder of The Bass, elder, giving him a licence for all the days of his life to be exempt from military service, providing always that his eldest son and heir apparent, with his household and folks etc., would serve in his stead. Despite this, and his age, he came out in support of Mary, Queen of Scots and accompanied her, James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell, and their 2000-strong army from Dunbar Castle to confront the confederate Lords at Carberry Hill on 14 June 1567. On 5 July 1568, at Edinburgh, Gasper Home was granted an escheat of the goods of Robert Lauder of The Bass, including his cattle and other goods on the steading and lands of Eddringtoun and the dues of the mill thereof, in the sheriffdom of Berwick, the said Robert being convicted as a fugitive for taking part with Archibald, Earl of Argyll, Claud Hamilton, and others in the battle of Langside in support of Mary, Queen of Scots. On 22 September 1568, at Edinburgh, a Precept of Remission was granted to Robert Lauder of Bass, Sir Robert Lauder of Popill, his son and heir apparent, John and Patrick Lauder, his sons, William Aslowane, servitor of the said laird ('servitoris dicti domini'), Charles Lauder, servitor of the said Robert in The Bass, and Archibald Lauder, also servitor of the said Sir Robert, for taking part with others at Langside, and for the treasonable keeping of the castle and fortalice of The Bass against the King (sic) and his authority after the said Robert had been commanded to deliver it. Loan to Mary, Queen of Scots The Privy Council Registers record that \\"the late Robert Lawder of The Bass\\" had loaned two thousand pounds to Queen Mary and Darnley. This had not been repaid, and Sir Robert's curator and executor [and son-in-law] David Preston of Craigmillar was now suing Sir John Stewart of Traquair as one of those who had guaranteed the loan. The argument was that \\"the said laird of Craigmillar and Elizabeth Hay, Lady Bass, relict and executrix of the said Robert\\" expected Sir John Stewart to pay up. They won this round. However it returned, on appeal, to the Privy Council on 3 and 19 October 1579, and again on 27 September 1580. The matter was never settled and by 1581 Elizabeth Hay, Lady Bass, had died and no-one pursued it further. Death The Testament testamentar (first Will) registration in the Edinburgh Commissariot on 19 April 1577, stated that \\"an honourable man, Robert Lauder of Bass, died in June 1576\\".

He also wrote several novels, also about wealthy people. Biography Birmingham was born in Andover, Connecticut in 1929 to Editha Birmingham (née Gardner) and Thomas Birmingham, a lawyer of Irish descent . He was not born into an upper-class family, but attended the elite Hotchkiss School, of which he later recalled \\"there were no blacks, maybe one Chinese person, who was the son of a missionary, and a quota on Jews.\\" He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in English from Williams College in 1950, and then worked as an advertising copywriter for Needham Harper Steers (now DDB Worldwide) in New York City. Among his clients was the popular magazine Ladies' Home Journal, for which Birmingham was credited with coining the slogan \\"Never underestimate the power of a woman.\\" He was a teacher of writing at the University of Cincinnati and also studied for a time in England. He married Janet Tillson in 1953 and they had three children, but later divorced. Birmingham had a great interest in the upper classes, and wrote numerous books about the wealthy in the United States, generally focusing on their ethnicity, national origins, and geographic locale. His biographies include those of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Wallis Warfield Windsor, and novelist John Marquand. His study of the African-American upper class — Certain People — generated some controversy and was panned by The New York Times. His other books, however, were often acclaimed. His trilogy of books on American Jews: Our Crowd: The Great Jewish Families of New York, The Grandees: America's Sephardic Elite, and The Rest of Us: The Rise of America's Eastern European Jews are perhaps his best known works. Our Crowd was on The New York Times Bestseller List for 47 weeks; its notoriety led to people often mistakenly assuming Birmingham was Jewish himself.

I do not think he does a single good thing or smart thing in any of the stories.\\" As Crescenzo summarized, For Crescenzo, the decision to begin the story at the beginning of the 20th century was consciously chosen due to the events that would unfold in future acts: In a 2007 interview, Casey stated at that time that he had the overall story of The Dear Hunter mapped out. Casey produced and recorded the EP by himself with the assistance of his brother on drums and mother on backing vocals. Act I: The Lake South, The River North was released in September 2006 on Triple Crown Records. Shortly after the release of Act I, Casey recruited Luke Dent of the recently split band Faraway for vocals and keyboards and Erick Serna as a second guitarist. Luke brought in his brother Sam on drums and Erick brought long-time friend Josh Rheault in to play bass. The band entered the studio in late 2006 to record the follow-up to Act I. Recording finished in early 2007, during which time, the band was featured in Alternative Press' \\"100 Bands You Need to Know in 2007.\\" =Act II: The Meaning of, and All Things Regarding Ms. Leading= Act II: The Meaning of, and All Things Regarding Ms. Leading was released May 22, 2007. Originally, the band had written almost 2 hours of music for the album, but managed to trim the run time down to 80 minutes so as to fit on a single compact disc. Act II reached No. 39 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart.[ Billboard], Allmusic The band supported the album by touring with As Tall As Lions, Saves the Day, Say Anything, Thrice, Chris Conley, The Format, Scary Kids Scaring Kids, Boys Night Out, Circa Survive, Ours, and Fear Before the March of Flames. The band filmed a music video for the song \\"The Church and the Dime\\". A book based on the story of Act II was released as part of the deluxe edition of Act III: Life and Death. Artist Kent St. John was selected to do the illustrations. Prior to a string of dates with Circa Survive, Josh Rheault and brothers Sam and Luke Dent left the band. Temporary replacements for the tour dates included Cliff Sarcona and Julio Tavarez of As Tall As Lions (drums and bass, respectively), Christopher Tagliaferro of Tiger Riot (bass), and Andy Wildrick of The Junior Varsity (guitar/keys). Wildrick later joined the band as a permanent member, along with Sagan Jacobson of Crown Atlantic on bass and Casey's brother Nick on drums. The Dear Hunter embarked on their first headlining tour in mid-2008 with Lydia, Eye Alaska, and You, Me, and Everyone We Know. On December 9, 2008, it was announced that Nate Patterson, Casey's former bandmate in The Receiving End of Sirens, would begin playing bass for the band, as Sagan Jacobson had left. =Act III: Life and Death= After the headlining tour, The Dear Hunter entered the studio to record Act III: Life and Death.\\"Act III release date.\\" Absolutepunk.net. April 5, 2009. During this time, former bassist Josh Rheault announced on tour that he had rejoined The Dear Hunter on acoustic guitar, backing vocals, and keyboards. Act III was released on June 23, 2009 on Triple Crown Records. =The Color Spectrum= Between the release of Act II and Act III, Crescenzo was also conceiving a multi-album arc related to the color spectrum. On April 23, 2010, Crescenzo announced that The Dear Hunter would take a break from the Acts project to focus on this concept. He also stated that Act IV would most likely not be seen for quite some time. He later announced that the project, titled The Color Spectrum, would consist of nine EPs, each corresponding to a certain color (specifically, Black, Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet and White). On February 24, 2011, Alternative Press announced the EPs would be released in multiple formats, including a physical CD containing select tracks from each of the EPs. At some point prior to the completion of The Color Spectrum, Josh Rheault and Erick Serna both left the band to pursue their respective musical projects. Subsequent to the release of The Color Spectrum, The Dear Hunter performed the entire three-hour set of EPs in a single show and released it as a DVD, entitled The Color Spectrum DVD. =Migrant= The Dear Hunter went in to the studio in 2012 with producer Mike Watts to record Migrant, the first album under Crescenzo's new imprint label, Cave & Canary Goods, which is a unit of Equal Vision Records. Prior to recording the album, Crescenzo expressed his excitement over working with Watts and further noted that Migrant represents another deferral of the next Act record, a consideration that Crescenzo weighed before moving forward. Migrant, which is the first album released by The Dear Hunter that does not have a concept, was released on April 2, 2013. Crescenzo remarked that the non-conceptual nature of Migrant presented a new challenge: \\"I've been in the rhythm of writing conceptually. It’s a challenge for me to be more transparent and more honest and more directly from the heart and not filtering it through something. So I think that was really exciting; it was really refreshing.\\" Remarking on the less rock-oriented and relatively streamlined nature of Migrant, Crescenzo noted that: =Act IV: Rebirth in Reprise= On March 3, 2015 Casey Crescenzo announced that Act IV: Rebirth in Reprise was well under way and should be released by the end of 2015. This was announced in conjunction with The Dear Hunter's live album that was released the same day. The live album, The Dear Hunter – Live, features songs from the string quartet tour from mid-2013. On June 16, the single \\"A Night on the Town\\" became available for streaming on the band's official website, and the album became available for preorder. On the preorder form, the release date of the album was said to be September 4, 2015. The album debuted at No. 39 on the Billboard 200 selling approximately 7,000 copies, both career highs for the band. The Dear Hunter then embarked on a Fall US Tour with bands CHON and Gates. =Act V: Hymns with the Devil in Confessional= On June 22, 2016 Casey Crescenzo announced via Facebook that Act V: Hymns with the Devil in Confessional was set for a September 9, 2016 release. The album debuted at #48 on the US Billboard 200 and #6 on the Independent Albums chart, becoming their 2nd best charting success so far. The band embarked on a month-long North American tour with Gavin Castleton and Eisley in late September, finishing with a show in San Francisco accompanied by Awesome Orchestra. The show focused mainly on Act IV and V and a few tracks off the first Acts. In an interview with Pop Matters, Casey announced the next Dear Hunter record will be unrelated to the Acts. = All Is as All Should Be = On September 12, 2017, The Dear Hunter announced a headlining tour with The Family Crest and Vava. On September 13th, The Dear Hunter announced a six track EP titled All Is as All Should Be. It was released on December 1, 2017 through Cave And Canary Goods. = The Fox and the Hunt = On February 14, 2020, The Dear Hunter released an orchestral LP in collaboration with composer Brian Adam McCune and San Francisco-based group Awesöme Orchestra through Cave and Canary Goods. The Fox and the Hunt repurposes and expands upon orchestral parts recorded for Act IV and Act V into a fully realized instrumental album.

It is the only high school in the Ravenna School District and serves students primarily in Ravenna and Ravenna Township. The school's colors are blue, white, and red and its athletic teams are known as the Ravens.  History  The previous home of Ravenna High School from 1923–2010. It was demolished in 2013. Ravenna High School was established in 1858, first meeting in a grocery store along West Main Street before moving to the new Union School building on Chestnut Street after it opened in December 1859. The first graduating class from the school was in 1862 and included two students. The Union School building would serve as home to all grades in the Ravenna City Schools until enrollment growth necessitated the construction of a new high school building. The next building, which stood on what is now Highland Avenue, opened in 1883 with an addition built in 1910. The addition still stands as is known as Walnut School, though it is no longer used as a school. The next home of Ravenna High School, located at the intersection of Clinton Street and East Main Street, opened in August 1923 after an August 1921 groundbreaking. It initially contained 28 classrooms, an auditorium, and a gymnasium. Additions were added to the building first in 1958–1959 with the Coll Annex on the north side and later in the late 1960s with Whittaker Hall on the south side of the building. In 1960, Ravenna Township High School was merged with Ravenna High School. Prior to that time, Ravenna High School was often referred to as \\"Ravenna City High School\\" to distinguish it from the township school. The new building under construction in September 2009 with the Coll Gymnasium in center. In 2006 voters approved a bond issue to fund construction of a new high school with assistance from the state of Ohio. The building was built adjacent to the district's existing athletic facilities on North Chestnut Street and was completed and dedicated in August 2010. The district carried two names from the old building to the new one as the school's main gym is named the \\"James L. Coll Gymnasium\\" while the field house gym is named the \\"James A. Whittaker Field House\\". The previous school building at the corner of East Main and Clinton Streets was put up for sale in 2010. It was unsuccessfully auctioned off along with remaining contents inside in April 2011. Because the state funded a majority of the new high school project, the building it replaced had to be sold or demolished and could be used for a public school. On November 22, 2011, it was publicly announced following a board vote that the old high school would be demolished. Historic and nostalgic items from the school were removed with some being moved to the new high school. Asbestos removal and other interior preparation work took place during the middle part of 2012. Demolition of the old Ravenna High School began on October 16, 2012 and was completed in March 2013. A new center for higher education, named the Ravenna Learning Center, was planned for the site with a satellite campus of Stark State College as the anchor, but plans fell through in May 2015. The site remains vacant as of 2016. Subscription required to access full article Campus and facilities The Ravenna High school building contains of space and includes the main gym, auxiliary field house gym, auditorium, cafeteria, and around 45 classrooms. The main gym has retractable bleacher seating for 1,125 and the auditorium has seating for 600 with 300 additional retractable seats that can expand into space in the cafeteria. The field house gym includes a rubberized surface which has two full-size basketball courts and an elevated walking track. The building also has two courtyards that separate the three academic sections of the building which are used for natural lighting and can also be used for outdoor teaching space. The building was dedicated August 28, 2010. The campus is and located in northern Ravenna along North Chestnut Street. The district first purchased the land in 1973 but nothing was built at the site until 1999 when athletic facilities were constructed, funded mainly by private donations and the sale of personal seat licenses. Prior to that time, outdoor sports were held at the old Gilcrest Stadium and various locations throughout the area. The campus includes Portage Community Bank Stadium which has a seating capacity of 5,000 and features an eight-lane all-weather running track and artificial playing surface. The stadium, one of the first in Ohio to have FieldTurf, became one of the first in the country to have a non-traditional field color when blue turf was installed in 2013 instead of the traditional green. A baseball field, softball field, eight tennis courts, and a cross country course are also on campus.

Built just south of the Skeppsholmen Church in 1853, and designed by Fredrik Blom, the original purpose of the building was to train the Navy staff in the complicated handling of the canon sloops and dinghies, the former in length and operated by 14 pairs of oars pulled by 54 men, and the latter half the size. Another benefit of the building was the shipyard on the eastern shore being sealed off, as the main entrance at the time was found on the eastern side. However, the rowing vessels were discontinued in 1871, and the building therefore enlarged in 1881, as designed by Blom's successor Victor Ringheim to adapt to new warfare technology. In 1955, the National Museum of Fine Arts moved into the building, and three years later the Moderna Museet under Pontus Hultén. As the latter museum was rebuilt and enlarged to the design by Rafael Moneo, starting 1994, the Drill House became part of the new complex and is from 1998 accommodating the Museum of Architecture.

He continued his studies in sculpture and architectural ornamentation at a number of European art academies. These included, in 1905, the School of Applied Art in Munich at the height of the Jugendstil movement; in 1907, the neo-classical studio of Marius-Jean-Antonin Mercié at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris; the Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts in Brussels, then a center of Art Nouveau, under symbolist and idealist artists Victor Rousseau and Constant Montald; and in 1912 he left Europe, joining the Bezalel School of Art in Jerusalem (see below). =Ottoman and British Mandate Palestine= Poster for the Society for the Promotion of Travel in the Holy Land. 1929 Lithograph Studies Under the influence of Boris Schatz, the founder of the Bezalel School of Art, Raban moved to the Ottoman Palestine in 1912 during the wave of Zionist immigration known as the Second Aliyah. Here he continued his studies at the Bezalel school. Teaching activity Two years after following Schatz's call, Raban joined the faculty of the Bezalel school. Here he headed the Repoussé Department, taught anatomy and composition, painting and sculpture.AATC Artists - Ze'ev Raban Raban also became director of the Graphics Press and the Industrial Art Studio. In 1914 his designs constituted the majority of the works created in the Bezalel workshop. Raban taught at Bezalel until the school had to close down in 1929 due to financial difficulties. Tower of David exhibition In 1921, he participated in the historic art exhibition at the Tower of David in Jerusalem, the first exhibit of Hebrew artists in Palestine, which became the first of an annual series of such exhibits. Artistic style and range =Style= Raban is regarded as a leading member of the Bezalel school art style, in which artists portrayed both Biblical and Zionist themes in a style influenced by the European Jugendstil (similar to Art Nouveau) and by traditional Persian and Syrian styles. Like other European art nouveau artists of the period, such as Alphonse Mucha, Raban combined commercial commissions with uncommissioned paintings. \\"Raban easily navigated a wealth of artistic sources and mediums, borrowing and combining ideas from East and West, fine arts and crafts from past and present. His works blended European neoclassicism, Symbolist art and Art Nouveau with oriental forms and techniques to form a distinctive visual lexicon. Versatile and productive, he lent this unique style to most artistic mediums, including the fine arts, illustration, sculpture, repousee, jewellery design, and ceramics.\\" Sotheby's auction file =Book illustration and graphic design= Good examples of Raban's specific eclectic mix of European and Oriental styles are his illustrated editions of the Book of Ruth, Song of Songs, Book of Job, Book of Esther, and the Passover Hagadah. Known are also his playing cards, where in the suit of leaves, the King is Ahasuerus, the Queen is Esther, and the Jack is Haman. He also designed a wide range of day- to-day objects, including commercial packaging for products such as Hanukkah candles and Jaffa oranges, bank notes, tourism posters, and insignia for Zionist institutions. =\\"Bezalel ceramics\\" (tile murals)= Raban collaborated with other artists to produce versions of his work as ceramic tile murals, of the so-called \\"Bezalel ceramics\\" type, a number of which can still be sees on buildings in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, including the Bialik House. The 1925 Lederberg house, at the intersection of Rothschild Boulevard and Allenby Street features a series of large ceramic murals designed by Raban. The four murals show a Jewish pioneer sowing and harvesting, a shepherd, and Jerusalem with a verse from , \\"Again I will rebuild thee and thous shalt be rebuilt.\\"Chaim Nachman Bialik Home, in Batia Carmiel, Tiles Adorned City; Bezalel Ceramics on Tel Aviv Houses, 1923-1929, Eretz Israel Museum, Tel Aviv, copyright 1996, book in Hebrew and some English with illustrations =Architectural decoration= Raban designed the decorative elements of such important Jerusalem buildings as the King David Hotel and the Jerusalem YMCA.

Each window depicts an event in the life of one of the principal Hebrew prophets, Jeremiah, Elijah, Elisha, Ezekiel, Moses, and Isaiah. In 2015 one of his works received international attention. The President of Israel, Reuven Rivlin visited at the White House with U.S. President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for the December 2015 Hannukah celebration. Israel's First Lady Nechama Rivlin joined her husband in lighting a menorah made in Israel by Raban, and loaned by the North Carolina Museum of Art's Judaic Art Gallery.

His stage name comes from the fact that he was born near the source of the river Lippe.  Life  Jürgen von der Lippe was born Hans- Jürgen Dohrenkamp in Bad Salzuflen, and grew up in Aachen, where he attended the Kaiser-Karls-Gymnasium and was a Catholic altar boy. (Today he is an agnostic). His father was the barkeeper in a striptease bar. From 1966 to 1970 he trained as a signaller in the Bundeswehr, leaving the armed forces a lieutenant. In 1976 he, Hans Werner Olm and others founded the music group Gebrüder Blattschuss (The Blattschuss Brothers – literally, Blattschuss is a hunting term for a shot through the shoulder into the heart; figuratively, it means getting one's point across succinctly.) From 1986 to 1988 he was married (his second marriage) to the famous German television presenter Margarethe Schreinemakers. Before his career in show business, he began studying German language and literature, philosophy and linguistics in Aachen and Berlin, but without graduating.  Television career  Jürgen von der Lippe's first major success was Donnerlippchen (Little Thunder Lips) on WDR television station. He went on to present another very successful dating show, Geld oder Liebe (Money or Love) on ARD; this finished in 2001 after twelve years on air. Some other public service broadcasting programmes of his included WWF Club (1980 to 1990), So isses (\\"That's how it is\\"), Die Goldene Eins (\\"The Golden No. 1\\"), Hast Du Worte (\\"Got words?\\"), Wat is? (\\"Whassup?\\"), Lippes Lachmix (\\"Lippe's Comedy Mix\\") and Was liest Du? (\\"What are you reading?\\"). On commercial television he presented the show Blind Dinner (Sat.1, 2001), and since 2001 he has presented the humorous Sat.1 review of the year's events, Wer zuletzt lacht (\\"He who laughs last\\"). In spring 2004 he played the main role of Father Erdmann in the comedy series Der Heiland auf dem Eiland (\\"The Saviour on the Island\\") on RTL Television. The first series of six episodes was very successful. The second series ran from 23 February 2005, this time with eight episodes. Jürgen von der Lippe had already played a Catholic priest in the comedy ', in which he also played a brothel manager and a Foreign Legionnaire. As of 2007, he sometimes appears in the improvisational comedy series Schillerstraße, playing the role of Cordula Stratmann's father. Since 15 July 2006, von der Lippe has also presented the programme Extreme Activity on the commercial station ProSieben.  Career as a singer  In 1976 von der Lippe founded the \\"Gebrüder Blattschuss\\", which lasted until 1979. His greatest musical success, however, was Guten Morgen, liebe Sorgen (\\"Good morning, dear worries\\"), which made it to first place in the ZDF hit parade in July and August 1987.  Stage programme  Von der Lippe's stage appearances have been sold in large numbers as soundtracks and videos. Typically, he dissects odd quirks and everyday events, expertly poking gentle fun at them, with plenty of self-irony. He makes playful use of amusing borrowed words and synonyms in German. The main themes are marriage, relationships between men and women and the way people act in certain situations. He often brings in fictitious \\"autobiographical\\" stories supposed to be from his youth or childhood, often based on his old \\"arch enemy\\" \\"Udo Lohmeier\\". Each show generally has a topic running through it. When on tour, von der Lippe also likes to vary the content of his stage shows, integrating current events. One recurring element over the years has also been von der Lippe's parodies of well-known German stars such as Udo Lindenberg, Peter Maffay and Helge Schneider. Many of his sketches are literal translations from Bill Cosby (e.g. Rache = revenge) or George Carlin (e.g. interview with Jesus). During his career, von der Lippe has created many characters who appear and reappear in monologues and songs, often played by von der Lippe himself in costume. These include a naive Catholic priest who reflects on human behaviour (often sexual), a postal worker from the Sauerland, with an appropriate accent, and \\"Kalle\\", a Berlin heavy metal fan.

For some years after his execution, the Jewish community in Metz marked the anniversary of his death (25 Tevet) as a day of fasting.Natalie Zemon Davis, Women on the Margins: Three Seventeenth-century Lives (Harvard University Press, 1995), p. 17. On 25 September 1669 (the eve of Rosh Hashanah) a small child went missing in the woods outside the village of Glatigny, about ten miles east of Metz. Levy had been seen riding towards Metz the same day, and was accused of having abducted the child, although he had an alibi for the time of the disappearance.Edmund Levin, The Exoneration of Raphael Levy, Wall Street Journal, Feb. 2, 2014. Accessed 10 October 2016. Charges were brought against Levy in the Parlement of Metz on 3 October. Even before the trial a child's body was found in the woods, partially eaten by animals, but it was too disfigured to be identified as that of the missing child.Augustin Calmet, Histoire de Lorraine, vol. 6 (Nancy, 1757), 706-709. Levy refused to confess to the crime despite torture, but was nevertheless convicted and sentenced to death by the Parlement. Offered an opportunity to become a Christian, he declared that he had lived a Jew and would die a Jew. The Parlement applied to Louis XIV to have the 95 Jewish families in Metz expelled from the province, but the king prohibited any further action in the matter.

For example, phobias related to survival, such as snakes, spiders, and heights, are much more common and much easier to induce in the laboratory than other kinds of fears. According to Martin Seligman, this is a result of our evolutionary history. The theory states that organisms which learned to fear environmental threats faster had a survival and reproductive advantage. Consequently, the innate predisposition to fear these threats became an adaptive human trait. The concept of preparedness has also been used to explain why taste aversions are learned so quickly and efficiently compared with other kinds of classical conditioning.

He graduated at the top of his class, earning the Espada de España (Sword of Spain). In 1937, Marín returned to Paris, attending France's Superior Officers War College, graduating with honorable mention and the highest grades. When he returned to Peru, he was appointed to a senior position with the Army General Staff ( (EMGE)), a post he still held during the actions of the Ecuadorian–Peruvian War of 1941. In 1946, Marín was promoted to Brigadier General and appointed Director of the Chorrillos Military School, a position he left in 1947 when the President of Peru, José Bustamante y Rivero, appointed Marín as Minister of War in his cabinet. In 1948, Marín chaired the Commission of Military Institutes, in charge of proposing a new set of fundamental policies upgrading the preparedness the Peruvian armed forces. This led to the creation of a cabinet-level Ministry of Defence in Peru, as well as the creation of the Center of Advanced Military Studies ( (CAEM)).

This massive storm, was the same storm that opened present-day Oregon Inlet. The new inlet at Hatteras became a profitable inlet, because it gave the Inner Banks, NC a quicker and easier route to travel to and from the Gulf Stream. It was easier to come into this inlet from the north than to Ocracoke. Because of the increase in commerce, Hatteras Village Post Office was established in 1858. The initial invasion of the North Carolina coast on Hatteras Island during the Civil War, called the Battle of Hatteras Inlet Batteries, came from Hatteras Inlet on August 28–29, 1861. The two Confederate forts guarding the inlet quickly fell.  Hatteras Inlet today  The inlet today is approximately two miles across, but this distance changes daily because of the convection of brackish water. No bridge crosses Hatteras Inlet.

He was also leader of the Independent Liberals during the 1960s. Biography Felix Pinchas Rosenblüth (later Rosen) was born in Berlin, Germany. He was brought up in Messingwerk Finow and attended the Wilhelms Gymnasium in Eberswalde from 1892 to 1904. In 1905 he left to study law at the universities of Freiburg and Berlin, graduating in 1908. He served in the Imperial German Army in World War I. Always active in Zionist circles, Rosen was Chairman of the Zionist Federation of Germany from 1920–1923, and eventually migrated to Mandatory Palestine in 1926 where he practiced as a lawyer and helped create the Central European Immigrants Association. Rosen was married three times, first to Annie Lesser with whom he had two children, Hans and Dina, who with their mother settled in London in 1933 and whom Rosen visited regularly until the end of his life. In 1935 he married Hadassah Calvary with whom he had a daughter, Rivka, who died in 1942 aged seven; Hadassah died of cancer in 1945. In 1950 he married Johanna Rosenfeld (born Ettlinger) who also predeceased him. Through his second and third wives he gained four step sons. Political career In 1942 Rosen founded the New Aliyah Party, and was elected to the Assembly of Representatives on its list in 1944. In 1948 he was among the signatories of the Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel, which he helped create. (In 2019 Israel's Supreme Court ruled that drafts of the declaration, commissioned by Rosen from fellow-lawyer Mordechai Beham, were of national importance and State, not private, property.) In the 1949 elections, the New Aliyah Party became the Progressive Party, winning Rosen a seat in the Knesset. In 1950, when David Ben-Gurion was unable to form a coalition, the President gave the task to Rosen, as head of the Progressive Party. Rosen handed the reins to Mapai, recognizing its indispensability.The Politics of Compromise: State and Religion in Israel, Ervin Birnbaum Rosen became the country's first Minister of Justice, an office to which he brought a strong reputation for intellect and probity. He retained his seat and Ministerial position in the 1951, 1955 and 1959 elections. Soon after the 1959 election the Progressive Party merged with the General Zionists to form the Liberal Party. The new party won the third largest number of seats in the 1961 elections but was not invited into the coalition, and Rosen lost his ministerial position. In order to consolidate opposition to Mapai's hegemony within Israeli politics, the Liberal Party merged with Herut to form Gahal. Rosen, however, was unhappy with the merger, and led a breakaway of seven MKs to found the Independent Liberals. He was elected to the sixth Knesset but resigned from the Knesset on December 23, 1968, and retired from politics. His departure from the political stage was greeted by one newspaper as, \\"The end of the aristocracy\\" and in another by a cartoon captioned: \\"Another Channukah miracle! ... An MK resigns because of age.\\" Rosen was a long-term friend of David Ben-Gurion who broke with Rosen after the Lavon affair, a botched Israeli sabotage operation in Egypt, in which Rosen sided with Lavon who had been (almost certainly falsely) accused of masterminding the mission, after which it is said Ben-Gurion refused to talk to Rosen again.

He was the leader of the 1980 Irish hunger strike. Background Hughes was born into an Irish Nationalist Catholic family from the Lower Falls Road area of Belfast, Northern Ireland. He became a member of the Merchant Navy in the late 1960s, believing it would reduce the income burden on his father. He became involved in the republican movement after the 1969 riots, believing he would be protecting his community from loyalist mobs. He was a cousin of Charles Hughes, who was the O/C of D Company in the Provisional IRA Belfast Brigade during the Falls Curfew, and was shot and killed in March 1971 by the Official Irish Republican Army's Belfast Brigade during a feud between the Provisional and Official IRAs.Provos The IRA & Sinn Féin, pp. 58, 79. IRA activity Hughes joined the Irish Republican Army in 1969, sided with the Provisional faction in the split of 1969–70, and was \\"on the run\\" in Belfast by 1970. From 1970 to 1972 Hughes was involved in a number of attacks on British soldiers and bank robberies to raise funds for the republican movement. Hughes was an excellent military strategist and was key to the IRA's early success in Belfast against the British Army especially in and around the Falls Road area of Belfast, sometimes carrying out along with his unit as many as five military operations a day against either the British Army or RUC. Hughes described his normal day during that period as \\"you would have had a call house [a safe meeting place] and you might have robbed a bank in the morning, done a float [gone out in a car looking for a British soldier] in the afternoon, stuck a bomb and a booby trap out after that, and then maybe had a gun battle or two later that night.\\"Unknown.\\"Brendan Hughes\\" Socialist Review 1 September 2006.

The British Army had prevented Catholic families, who had been intimidated by Loyalists from their homes in Rathcoole, from moving into empty houses in Lenadoon Avenue. There was a confrontation between the crowd and soldiers who fired rubber bullets. Following this the IRA opened fire on the troops thus ending the ceasefire. As Officer Commanding (OC) of the Provisional IRA Belfast Brigade, he was the main organiser of Bloody Friday, the biggest bombing attack ever carried out by the organisation in Belfast. On 21 July 1972, the IRA exploded 22 bombs all over the city leaving nine people dead, including two British soldiers, an Ulster Defence Association (UDA) member, two teenage boys, and a mother of seven; 130 people were injured.Moloney, Ed (2010). Voices From the Grave: Two Men's War in Ireland.

I have a fair deal of regret that 'Bloody Friday' took place...a > great deal of regret...If I could do it over again I wouldn't do it.Moloney, > p.105 =Initial prison escape= On 19 July 1973 Hughes was arrested on the Falls Road along with Gerry Adams (later President of Sinn Féin between 1983 and 2018) and Tom Cahill. They were interrogated for more than 12 hours at the Springfield Road Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) barracks and later at Castlereagh before being transported to Long Kesh. On 8 December Hughes escaped inside a rolled-up mattress in the back of a dustcart, and fled across the border to Dublin. After ten days he had returned to Belfast after assuming a new identity, becoming a travelling toy salesman named \\"Arthur McAllister\\". For five months Hughes lived in Myrtlefield Park near Malone Road, and was believed to be the new O/C of the IRA in Belfast following the arrest of Ivor Bell in February. On 10 May 1974, Hughes was arrested following a tip-off, and the house was found to contain a submachine gun, four rifles, two pistols and several thousand rounds of ammunition. Hughes was subsequently sentenced to fifteen years in prison.Provos The IRA & Sinn Féin, pp. 160–162. Three years after his arrest Hughes was involved in a fracas, and received an additional five-year sentence for assaulting a prison officer. As he was convicted after 1 March 1976, Hughes was transferred from the compounds to the H-Blocks and lost his Special Category Status. He refused to wear a prison uniform and joined the blanket protest. Shortly after arriving in the H-Blocks, Hughes became the O/C of the IRA prisoners, and in March 1978 ordered the prisoners to begin the dirty protest.Brits, pp. 228–229 Whilst in prison Hughes formed a friendship with Shankill Butchers and Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) member Robert Bates, who later foiled a UVF plot to assassinate Hughes.Moloney, Ed (2010). Voices From the Grave: Two Men's War in Ireland. Faber & Faber. p.259-260 Hunger strike Hughes was the Officer Commanding during the 1980 hunger strike. Against the wishes of the IRA Army Council, on 27 October 1980, Hughes along with six other republican prisoners, including Tom McFeely, John Nixon, Sean McKenna, Tommy McKearney and Raymond McCartney, refused food and started a hunger strike.Provos The IRA & Sinn Féin, pp. 230–235. During the second month of the hunger strike the British Government, led by Margaret Thatcher, sent an intermediary to inform Hughes of a possible compromise, despite previously having publicly rejected any compromise. Hughes had promised one of the hunger strikers, Sean McKenna, that if McKenna slipped into a coma that Hughes would end the hunger strike and as McKenna was on the verge of death, Hughes found himself in a dilemma. Hughes assumed that the compromise was in good faith and ended the hunger strike after 53 days. However, when the document arrived at the prison there was disappointment at the final position of the British government.Hunger Strikes and Death of Bobby Sands BBC Website.

Bobby Sands had taken over as leader of the republican prisoners in the prison after Hughes began his strike. On 1 March 1981, Sands began the second hunger strike, which Hughes opposed.Moloney, pp.241–247 Release Hughes was released from prison in 1986, and returned to live in Belfast, staying initially at the home of Gerry Adams. He was appointed to the IRA's Internal Security Unit and liaised between IRA Northern Command and rural units in Tyrone and Armagh. In 1990, Hughes appeared at a press conference in Bilbao organised by Batasuna, the political wing of the Basque nationalist paramilitary group ETA, to support an amnesty for ETA prisoners. He resigned from the Army Council in 1994. At the start of the 21st century, he became increasingly critical of the political direction of the Sinn Féin leadership. In 2000, he criticised the Sinn Féin leadership for allowing building firms in west Belfast to pay low wages to former prisoners and stated his belief that the republican leadership had sold out on their ideals to achieve peace in Northern Ireland. In October 2006, Hughes was pictured on the front page of the Irish News wearing an eye patch, after he underwent an operation to save his sight which had been badly damaged due to his hunger strike.

Definition Sometimes called \\"remedial\\" or \\"developmental\\" writing, basic writing (BW) was developed in the 1970s in response to open admissions policies. BW can refer to both a type of composition course and a field of study. The term \\"basic writing\\" was coined by Mina Shaughnessy, a pioneer in the field of basic writing, to distinguish it from previous terms like \\"bonehead\\" or \\"remedial\\". BW courses are designed to teach formal written standard English to students deemed under-prepared for first-year composition. Institutions typically enroll students in BW courses based on standardized or placement test scores, with standards varying by institution. In the early work of Mina Shaugnessy BW is traditionally characterized by texts that demonstrates a lack of understanding of the rules of formal written English, specifically within the context of academic discourse, which may manifest as nonstandard syntax, grammar, spelling, punctuation, usage, mechanics, organization, and clarity. However, BW has shifted its focus from error correction to other composition interests, including the writing process, rhetoric, development, and diversity. BW as a field of study tends to resist narrowly defining basic writers. Shaughnessy characterized basic writers as \\"those that had been left so far behind the others in their formal education that they appeared to have little chance of catching up, students whose difficulty with the written language seemed of a different order from those of the other groups, as if they had come, you might say, from a different country, or at least through different schools, where even modest standards of high-school literacy had not been met.\\"Shaughnessy, Mina. Errors and Expectations. New York: Oxford UP, 1977, p. 2 Basic writers have been characterized as students who are first-generation, non-traditional, English language learners, racial minorities, or members of disadvantaged socioeconomic groups. However, further research shows that basic writers are more diverse nationally than allowed for within these broad generalizations. The research in the field also advocates for the educational and socio- political status of basic writers. Deborah Mutnick explains: \\"It [basic writing] signifies struggles for inclusion, diversity and equal opportunity; debates over standards and linguistic hegemony; the exploitation of faculty and staff on the academic margins; and the policies that opened and not threatened to close higher education's doors to masses of people. It has played a key role not only in providing opportunities for research on adult literacy but also in illuminating the politics of writing in terms of race, class, ethnicity, and other social structures that would have remained invisible in the mostly white, middle-class classrooms that have traditionally constituted the 'mainstream.'\\" Since the mid 2000s, scholars from both writing studies, education, and other fields have sought to complicate the knowledge and practices of basic writing, calling into question the distinction between \\"basic\\" and \\"college-ready\\" writing and writers. Reform efforts in the last decade have blurred what once was a bold distinction between the two groups.Two-Year College English Association. TYCA White Paper on Developmental Education Reforms. http://www.ncte.org/library/NCTEFiles/Resources/Journals/TETYC/0423-mar2015/TETYC0423White.pdf?_ga=2.161082741.998692016.1573825009-1951967772.1531341836 2015. History Early versions of basic writing instruction in the United States started at Harvard between 1890 and 1910, when college enrollments nearly doubled. Modern basic writing originated in the 1970s when the City University of New York (CUNY) instituted an open admission policy for all New York City residents. In 1966, prior to open admissions, CUNY had instituted the SEEK program (Search for Education, Elevation, and Knowledge) which was designed as a pre-collegiate program that was meant to prepare students who were not yet ready to enter the university for full admission. As the open admissions policy caused college enrollments to nearly double at CUNY, Mina Shaughnessy headed the basic writing program to meet the demand for more writing instruction for under-prepared students. Since the late 1970s, many colleges and universities have created open admissions policies, and have in turn created BW programs across the country. From its inception, basic writing has faced political and institutional opposition. Some saw open admissions as a way to overwhelm colleges with the \\"wrong kind of students\\", and others, including the famous editorial \\"Why Johnny Can't Write\\", criticized what they saw as the lowering standard of writing instruction. In 1976 CUNY cut the budget for the basic writing program and started charging tuition for open admissions students, measures that had dramatic negative effects on both students and educators in the basic writing program. Similar efforts to reduce or eliminate BW courses were revived in the 1990s and have continued to the present day. Major theorists =Mina P. Shaughnessy= Mina P. Shaughnessy (pronounced MY-NA SHAWN-ES-EE), involved with the SEEK program at CUNY, was a proponent of open admissions for City College (part of the CUNY system) and became director of the BW program once City College opened its doors to all. Shaughnessy worked hard not only to design a curriculum for students that seemed alien to the professors that literally did not know what to do with students who seemed not to be able to put two words together, in some cases, but to understand and categorize the characteristics of basic writers in order to understand them better, and be able to teach them more effectively. For this purpose, Shaughnessy compiled four-thousand placement essays written by students as part of the entrance process into City College and classified the errors that she found, trying to understand the logic behind spelling, syntax, grammar, etc., that seemed, at best, scattered and, at worst, completely arbitrary. She published her results in the book Errors and Expectations (1977). Her main conclusion is that these writers are not scattered or arbitrary, but that they have created systems of written English based on misunderstood rules, half-understood lessons on punctuation, their own local or familial dialects, among others, and have logically created their own systems of written English. It is not that these students do not understand communication, but they simply have not been taught or have misunderstood the rules of written formal English. Shaughnessy's work was considered groundbreaking and Errors and Expectations is still considered the seminal book in the field of BW. And although she died in 1978, and other scholars have made contributions to the field, Shaughnessy remains its leading figure today. Shaughnessy is arguably the most prominent name in the field of BW. She helped create the atmosphere of academic respectability BW needed to become recognized as a legitimate scholarly field. Her 1977 book, Errors and Expectations, set the tone for much (if not all) of the BW scholarship that followed. BW scholars, whether they agree with Shaughnessy or not, are still responding to her. She resolutely held that such students could be taught how to effectively write. It is teachers of BW and not BW students that need to radically alter their views toward the teaching and learning of writing. In her 1976 speech, \\"Diving In: An Introduction to Basic Writing\\", she asserted that \\"teachers (need to) realize and accept the need to remediate themselves regarding the needs and learning styles of basic writers.\\" =Shaughnessy's legacy= Later scholars critiqued some aspects of Shaugnessy's work. Min Zhan Lu, for example, problematized Shaugnessy's essentialist view of language, expectation that basic writers adjust to mainstream linguistic standards, and failed to acknowledge politica, economic, and institutional contexts that shape the designation of basic writers and basic writing. Lu's critique applied to other big names in the field of BW including Mike Rose (see below). Other notable scholars of BW, however, like Laura Gray-Rosendale have claimed that such critiques of Shaughnessy do not hold much critical weight. \\"Shaughnessy's works,\\" themselves, she claims, \\"render ambiguous if not outright defy many such negative characterizations.\\" Also, David Bartholomae (see below) has defended Shaughnessy's emphasis on error in BW students' writing (though he still advocates refocusing BW to help students learn various academic dialects). Adjusting the focus a bit, \\"Bartholomae extends Mina Shaughnessy's hope that teachers, especially basic writing teachers, will examine how they view errors in student writing. For example, he suggests that teachers who cannot understand student prose do not read the prose as complex texts and thus do not find the logic at work in many errors.\\" =David Bartholomae= David Bartholomae is Professor of English and Chair of the English Department at the University of Pittsburgh. Bartholomae's most- referenced publication about BW is the book chapter \\"Inventing the University,' in which he unpacks the audience and purpose of writing for the academy, particularly from the perspective of students new to this discourse community. Bartholomae writes: \\"\\"Every time a student sits down to write for us, he has to invent the university for the occasion--invent the university, that is, or a branch of it, like history or anthropology or economics or English. The student has to learn to speak our language, to speak as we do, to try on the peculiar ways of knowing, selecting, evaluating, reporting, concluding, and arguing that define the discourse of our community. Bartholomae asserts that (though important) error should not determine the efforts of or relationship between BW teachers and their students. Rather, BW teachers should recognize that the language they demand from their BW students (typically short, direct, non-abstruse sentences) is not the language that they (the teachers) typically write and publish in. Students experience such disconnect between what they learn from their writing classes and what their discipline specific course require of them that they are often left to their own devices to figure out how to write acceptably in any given discipline. To resolve this, Bartholomae believes that BW teachers should immerse their students with academic writing (peer-reviewed journal articles, book chapters, etc.). BW students thus get a healthy exposure to sufficient sums of \\"academic\\" language in a teacher-assisted environment. This, Bartholomae claims, should help BW students make the transition more quickly to start writing \\"academically.\\" The idea that academics might personally strive to exhibit a clear, cogent, and elegant style in their articles and chapters, and thus model good writing for their students to emulate, is not entertained. =Mike Rose= Mike Rose is Professor of Social Research Methodology at UCLA. He is best known in the BW community for his part autobiographical/part pedagogically philosophical book, Lives on the Boundary. Rose's main interests in the study of thinking and learning include the \\"study of the factors – cognitive, linguistic, socio-historical, and cultural – that enhance or limit people's engagement with written language.\\" As well as, \\"The development of pedagogies and materials to enhance critical reading and writing, particularly at the secondary and post-secondary level, and particularly with 'underprepared' or 'at risk' populations.\\" Additionally, Rose has argued for the term basic writing as opposed to the terms \\"developmental\\" or \\"remedial\\" which have the connotations of medical terminology. = Kelly Ritter = Kelly Ritter is Professor of Associate Dean of Curricula and Academic Policy and Professor of English and Writing Studies in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences and is best known for her historical work on basic writing in college. In her landmark book publication, Before Shaughnessy: Basic Writing at Yale and Harvard, 1920-1960, Ritter asks readers to reconceptualize the sorting phenomenon that frames basic writing as a course, phenomenon or identity that emerges with the notable work of Mina Shaughnessey actually reflects a much longer history of \\"social sorting\\" that has existed not just in open-access institutions but in the most selective of colleges. By examining the history of Yale students who were assigned to take courses—colloquially called the \\"Awkward Squad,\\" Ritter aims to help scholars develop a \\"better, more historically informed schemata for first-year writing programs, one that is cognizant of the role that local values play in shaping definition.\\"  Reform Efforts  Reform efforts nationally have taken the form of many different interventions, some of them originating from faculty working in open-access institutions, and others imposed from legislative mandates at the state level. These efforts focus on reducing the amount of pre-college or remedial coursework that students are required to complete prior to taking degree-credit courses, responding to research suggesting that students who take remedial coursework are less likely to be retained to college. Some of the efforts include the following: * Accelerated Learning Program: Faculty at the Community College of Baltimore County developed a program that moved students assessed as needing remedial coursework into a college-credit writing course with additional support in the form of class time and more intensive small group instruction. * AB 705 (California): AB 705 is a bill signed by the governor of California that took effect in 2018. The California Community Colleges Office of Assessment and Placement notes that \\"AB 705 was written to clarify existing regulation and ensure that students are not placed into remedial courses that may delay or deter their educational progress unless evidence suggests they are highly unlikely to succeed in the college-level course\\". Community College teachers and administrators have sought to adjust their curriculum and placement mechanisms to respond to the legislation. *Writing Studio: A writing studio model is an approach to supporting students' transition to college writing by including a component of instruction that takes place in what Grego and Thompson call a \\"third space\\" outside of the traditional classroom. Features of writing studio include facilitated small group interaction and \\"interactive, mentored feedback.\\" See also *Composition studies *Cooling out *First-year composition *Literacy *Theories of rhetoric and composition pedagogy References External links * Bartholomae, David. \\"The Tidy House: Basic Writing in the American Curriculum.\\" Journal of Basic Writing, vol. 12, no. 1, 1993, pp. 4–21. https://wac.colostate.edu/jbw/v12n1/bartholomae.pdf * Council on Basic Writing Blog, https://cbwblog.wordpress.com. * Duttagupta, Chitralekha, and Robert J.

Its board of directors includes representatives of a number of skateboarding companies who in turn represent a membership base of \\"skateboard manufacturers, distributors, contest organizers, ramp designers and individuals\\". History The IASC was established in 1995 by Jim Fitzpatrick, with the goal of promoting skateboarding, increase participation, saving its members money and educating the community about skateboarding. Its members include skateboard manufacturers, distributors, skatepark designers and contest organisers. Its current board of directors includes representatives of Dwindle Distribution, Sole Technology, Wabsono International, Transworld Skateboarding, DVS Shoes, Sector 9, Black Box, Nike Skateboarding, Element, Tum Yeto (Tod Swank), The Skateboard Mag, DC Shoes, Vans and Blitz Distribution (Per Welinder). Initiatives =Go Skateboarding Day= Skaters at a Go Skateboarding Day event in Calgary, Canada. The IASC established an annual Go Skateboarding Day (usually June 21 each year) to encourage skateboarders around the world to go skateboarding, hold competitions and generally promote skateboarding and to encourage non-skaters to consider buying a skateboard.LIFE Goes Skateboarding, 1965 by Bill Eppridge (Time magazine - LIFE) =Anti-blank-deck campaign= In part, the initial establishment of the association was prompted by industry concerns about the sale of blank (un-branded) skateboard decks. In 1994, during the months before the establishment of the association, representatives of various skateboarding companies met to discuss their concerns. In particular, companies were concerned about the proliferation of un-branded decks for sale in skate shops and other retail outlets that had not been produced by one of the major skate brands. These decks carried no logos or associated designs and were produced by manufacturers that (according to the companies) did not contribute to the sponsorship of skateboarders, venues or events.Transcript of Meeting (29 January 1994, Poway, California) The association was officially established the following year. In 2007, the IASC released a report, produced in conjunction with Transworld Skateboarding titled, Under Fire: A special report on the skate hard-goods market.\\"Under Fire\\" Five Years Later: Happy Anniversary IASC by Bud Stratford (Everything Skateboarding, January 2012) In it, the IASC detailed the impact of blank deck sales on the wider industry and encouraged skaters to only buy and ride branded decks and to wear branded clothing at competitions. The IASC also resolved to encourage media outlets to only publish stories with images that included skaters supporting their sponsors' brands. Blitz Distribution, an IASC member company, established www.aworldwithoutpros.com to support the campaign. A number of skaters and industry representatives established www.aworldwithoutceos.com as a direct counter-argument to the claims made by the IASC. Both sites have since been taken down. As a result of the campaign, a number of manufacturers discontinued direct sale of blank decks (though a number continued to supply IASC member companies). =Liability laws= During the late-1990s, founding director Jim Fitzpatrick and the IASC campaigned for reform of California's public liability laws as they pertained to skateboarding in particular. The campaign was successful and laws were changed in 1997 to introduce liability limits.The Skateboard: The Good, The Rad, and the Gnarly by Ben Marcus & Lucia Daniella Griggi (MVP Books, 2011) =Just One Board= In 2012, the IASC and the Go Skateboarding Foundation (established by the IASC to run Go Skateboarding Day) launched the non-profit Just One Board initiative.Just One Board Makes Its Mark On Go Skateboarding Day by Kelli Hargrove (Transworld Skateboarding, 13 June 2012) Just One Board seeks to collect used skateboards and refurbish them for distribution to underprivileged children.Next Up receives 50 complete skateboards from Just One Board (Next Up Foundation, 5 November 2012) References  External links  *Official site of the IASC *Member companies of the IASC Category:Skateboarding ","title":"International Association of Skateboard Companies"},{"id":"9469521","text":"Data-dependent jitter (DDJ) is a specific class of timing jitter. In particular, it is a form of deterministic jitter which is correlated with the sequence of bits in the data stream. It is also a form of ISI. Properties Depending on characteristics of the signal and transmission topology, previously transmitted symbols can affect the edge cross over time. This creates a probability distribution for the timing of the signal edge, which is usually recorded in a PDF. DDJ's PDF is always a series of pulses at the locations where a specific bit pattern experiences a cross over. Therefore, in order to get an accurate measure of the DDJ in a particular system, a large number of bit patterns must be analyzed (often just a PRBS) unless an analytical solution can be found.

His league and championship career with the Tipperary senior team spanned thirteen seasons from 1980 to 1993. Born in Borrisoleigh, County Tipperary, Ryan was raised in a strong hurling family. His father, Tim Ryan, and his uncles, Ned Ryan and Pat Stakelum, won All-Ireland medals with Tipperary between 1949 and 1951. Ryan enjoyed his first hurling successes with Templemore CBS. Here he won an All-Ireland medal in 1978. Ryan first appeared for the Borris-Ileigh club at juvenile and underage levels, before eventually joining the club's senior team. The highlight of his club career came in 1987 when he won an All-Ireland medal. Ryan also won one Munster medal and three county championship medals. Ryan made his debut on the inter-county scene at the age of sixteen when he was selected for the Tipperary minor team. He enjoyed two championship seasons with the minor team before subsequently joining the under-21 team with whom he won back-to-back All-Ireland medals in 1980 and 1981. By this stage Ryan had also joined the Tipperary senior team, making his debut during the 1980-81 league. Over the course of the following thirteen seasons, he won All-Ireland medals in 1989 as captain and in 1991. Ryan also won five Munster medals and one National League medal. He played his last game for Tipperary in August 1993. Ryan was joined on the Tipperary team for much of his career by his brother Aidan. After being chosen on the Munster inter-provincial team for the first time in 1984, Ryan was an automatic choice on the starting fifteen for the following three years. During that time he won two Railway Cup medals.

The office originated as a purely monastic devotion inspired by Psalm 118:62, At midnight I arose to give thanks unto Thee for the judgments of Thy righteousness (LXX),Throughout this article, the Septuagint numbering of the Psalms is used. To see the difference between the two numbering systems, see the relevant table in the article, Kathisma. and also by the Gospel Parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins (). The name of the Midnight Office is sometimes translated as \\"Nocturns\\"; but this is misleading, as in the West \\"Nocturn\\" refers to a division within the completely different office of Matins. Originally, monks would rise in the middle of the night to sing praises to God. Saint Symeon the New Theologian mentions Psalm 118, a significant component of the Midnight Office on weekdays, being said privately in the cells before Matins. Bishop Hilarion Alfeyev, St. Symeon the New Theologian and Orthodox Tradition (Oxford University Press, 2000), p. 79. Today, in most places where the Daily Cycle is observed, the Midnight Office is combined with Matins and the First Hour into one of the three daily aggregates called for in the Typikon.Kovalchuk, Feodor S., Abridged Typicon, 2nd ed. (St. Tikhon’s Seminary Press, South Canaan, PA, 1985), pp 17-19. Concerning the Midnight Office, Saint Mark of Ephesus says: \\"The beginning of all the hymns and prayers to God is the time (kairos) of the midnight prayer. For, rising from sleep for it, we signify the transportation from the life of the deceit of darkness to the life which is, according to Christ, free and bright, with which we begin to worship God. For it is written, The people who sat in darkness saw a great light\\" ( and ). Patrologia Graeca 160, 1165D [Tr. Protopresbyter George Dion. Dragas, On the Priesthood and the Holy Eucharist (Orthodox Research Institute, Rollinsford, NH, 2004) p. 48]. The general tone of the office is one of penitence, tempered by an attitude of hopeful expectation. In the Russian tradition the Midnight Office often begins with the reading of the Morning Prayers in common, which otherwise would be said privately by the brethren in their cells. At the conclusion of the Midnight Office, just as at the end of Compline, it is traditional in many places for everyone present to venerate the icons and relics of the saints that are present in the temple (church building). In Greek Prayer Books, a modified form of the Midnight Office is used for Morning Prayers for laymen, while a modified form of Small Compline is used for evening prayers. In Oriental Orthodox Christianity and Oriental Protestant Christianity, the office is prayed at 12 am, being known as Lilio in the Syriac and Indian traditions; it is prayed by all members in these denominations, both clergy and laity, being one of the seven fixed prayer times.  History  From the time of the early Church, the practice of seven fixed prayer times have been taught; in Apostolic Tradition, Hippolytus instructed Christians to pray seven times a day \\"on rising, at the lighting of the evening lamp, at bedtime, at midnight\\" and \\"the third, sixth and ninth hours of the day, being hours associated with Christ's Passion.\\" With respect to midnight prayer and the ablutions preceding it, Hippolytus wrote: Eastern Orthodox Christianity =Structure of the Service= The Midnight Office can be divided into four parts:The Festal Menaion (Tr. Mother Mary and Archimandrite Kallistos Ware, Faber and Faber, London, 1984), p. 74. # Opening--The usual beginning prayers that open most Orthodox offices: a blessing by the priest and prayers by the reader, including the Trisagion and the Lord's Prayer, ending with the call to worship, \\"O come, let us worship God our King....\\" # First Part--Psalm 50 and a Kathisma from the Psalter (differing according to the day of the week—see below), Nicene Creed, Trisagion and Lord's Prayer followed by the Troparia and prayers, concluding with a blessing by the Priest. During Lenten services there follows the Prayer of Saint Ephrem.Normally, the Prayer of Saint Ephrem is said once, with three prostrations; but on the first day of Great Lent (Clean Monday) it is said twice, with four prostrations and twelve bows. # Second Part--\\"O come, let us worship...\\" and Psalms 120 and 133, followed by the Trisagion, Troparia of Repentance, an intercession and a blessing by the priest. # Conclusion--Next follows a mutual asking of forgiveness between the priest and all the brethren. Then the priest says a litany during which everyone slowly and quietly chants \\"Lord, have mercy,\\" concluding with a final blessing by the Priest. At the present time, the Midnight Office will take one of four forms, depending upon the particular day: (a) Weekdays, (b) Saturday, (c) Sunday, and (d) a unique form which is observed only on Holy Saturday as part of the Paschal Vigil. =Weekdays= The distinguishing feature of the Midnight Office on weekdays is the reading of the Seventeenth Kathisma comprising Psalm 118, the longest Psalm in the Bible, in the First Part of the office. The troparia chanted in the First Part are the Troparia of the Bridegroom: \\"Behold, the Bridegroom cometh at midnight...\\", recalling the Parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins. The first of these troparia is also solemnly chanted at Matins during Holy Week, from which the Matins service on these days derives its name of \\"Bridegroom Prayer.\\" =Saturday= On Saturday, Psalm 118 is always read at Matins as kathisma,Except during Bright Week (Easter Week), when no psalms at all are read. so here it is replaced by the Ninth Kathisma, comprising Psalms 64-69. The troparia in the First Part are different from those used on weekdays. Before the Second Part, a special Prayer of Saint Eustratius is read. =Sunday= On Sunday, Psalm 118 is often (though not always) read at Matins, so it is not read at the Midnight Office. The psalm is normally replaced by a Canon to the Holy Trinity, composed by St. Theophanes, according to the tone of the week in the Octoechos. Since the Sunday services, which celebrate the Resurrection of Christ, are normally longer than the weekday services, the Midnight Office is shortened. The Nicene Creed, Troparia and prayers from the First Part, as well as the entire Second Part of the service are omitted. Instead, after the canon, special hymns to the Trinity by Saint Gregory of Sinai are chanted, followed by the Trisagion, the Lord’s Prayer and resurrectional hymn called the Ypakoë in the tone of the week. The Prayer to the Most Holy Trinity by Mark the Monk is read and then the mutual asking of forgiveness, Litany and dismissal. In the Russian tradition, an All-Night Vigil is celebrated every Sunday (commencing in the evening on Saturday), and so the Midnight Office and Compline are usually omitted. In some places the Midnight Office is read on Sunday morning before the Little Hours and Divine Liturgy. The Greeks do not normally celebrate an All-Night Vigil on Sunday, so they read the Midnight Office in its usual place before Matins on Sunday morning. =Holy Saturday= On Great and Holy Saturday, the Midnight Office takes a very particular form in which it is celebrated on only this one night of the year. Holy Saturday is often the only time that the Midnight Office will be read in parishes. It is the last office found in the liturgical book that contains the services of Great Lent, the Lenten Triodion. The Office is read around the epitaphios, a shroud embroidered with the image of Christ prepared for burial in the Tomb, which has been placed on a catafalque in the center of the church. After the Opening and Psalm 50, the Canon of Great Saturday is chanted (repeated from the Matins service the night before) as a reflection upon the meaning of Christ’s death and His Harrowing of Hell. During the last Ode of the Canon, the priest and deacon carry the epitaphios into the sanctuary and lay it upon the Altar, where it will remain throughout the Paschal season as a reminder of the burial cloth left in the Empty Tomb (). Then a brief litany is read and the priest says the dismissal. All lights in the church are extinguished, and everyone waits in silence and darkness for the stroke of midnight, when the Resurrection of Christ is to be proclaimed. Due to the all-importance of the Passion and Resurrection of Christ, the Midnight Office is not read in church from Thursday in Holy Week until after Thomas Sunday (The Sunday after Easter), except for the Paschal Vigil. If the Office is chanted during this time, it is done so privately. If one reads the Midnight Office privately during Bright Week the format used is that of the Paschal Hours. Oriental Orthodox Christianity =Syriac Orthodox Church, Indian Orthodox Church and Mar Thoma Syrian Church= In the Syriac Orthodox Church and Indian Orthodox Church (both of which are Oriental Orthodox Churches), as well as the Mar Thoma Syrian Church (an Oriental Protestant denomination), the Midnight Office is known as Lilio and is prayed at 12 am using the Shehimo breviary. =Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria= In the Coptic Orthodox Church, an Oriental Orthodox denomination, the Midnight Praise is prayed at 12 am using the Agpeya breviary.

The vast majority of Bosnian Americans (especially those of Bosniak or mixed ethnic heritage) immigrated to the United States during and after the Bosnian War which lasted from 1992–95. Nevertheless, many Bosnians immigrated to the United States as early as the 19th century. The largest Bosnian American population can be found in Saint Louis, Missouri, which boasts the largest number of Bosnians in the world outside Europe. While official census reports from the 2001 Census indicate that there are 121,938 Bosnian-Americans in U.S., it is estimated that today there are some 500,000 Americans of full or partial Bosnian descent living in the country. History =Early period= The first Bosnians settled in Chicago in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, joining other immigrants seeking better opportunities and better lives. As the former Yugoslavia continued to find its identity as a nation over the last century, the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina sought stability and new beginnings in the city of Chicago many intending to return to their homeland. Those of these early (Bosnian) immigrants who were of Muslim faith were early leaders in the establishment of Chicago's Muslim community. In 1906, they established Dzemijetul Hajrije (The Benevolent Society) of Illinois to preserve the community's religious and national traditions as well as to provide mutual assistance for funerals and illness. The organization established chapters in Gary, Indiana, in 1913, and Butte, Montana, in 1916, and is the oldest existing Muslim organization in the United States. =Post World War II= Chicago's Bosnian community received a new influx of migrants after World War II who were displaced by the war and Communist takeover. This new wave of refugees included many well-educated professionals, some of whom were forced to take lower-skilled jobs as taxi cab drivers, factory workers, chauffeurs, and janitors. As the population increased in the early 1950s, the Muslim community invited Sheik Kamil Avdich, a prominent Muslim scholar, to become the first permanent imam (religious minister). Under Imam Kamil's leadership, the Bosnian Muslim Religious and Cultural Home was established to raise funds for a mosque, which opened on Halsted Street in 1957. In 1968, the organization's name was changed to the Bosnian American Cultural Association, and in the early 1970s it purchased land in Northbrook to build a larger mosque and cultural center. The Islamic Cultural Center of Greater Chicago has remained an important center for Bosnian Muslim religious activity, serving Bosnians and non-Bosnian Muslims in the Chicago metropolitan area. =Bosnian War (1992–1995)= The war in Bosnia and Herzegovina from 1992 to 1995 brought the largest influx of Bosnians to St Louis, which became the most popular United States destination for Bosnian refugees. It is estimated that 40,000 refugees moved to the St. Louis area in the 1990s and early 2000s, bringing the total St. Louis Bosnian population to some 70,000. In Chicago, the Bosnian community has largely settled in the northern part of the city, between Lawrence and Howard, from Clark to Lake Michigan. Many refugees suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of gruesome experiences in concentration camps and the death of family and friends. The Illinois Department of Human Services founded the Bosnian Refugee Center in 1994 with the help of public and private agencies to assist the newcomers, and in 1997 it became the nonprofit Bosnian & American Community Center. Staffed by Bosnian refugees from all backgrounds, the center serves all refugees by providing community services that include educational and family programs, counseling, and cultural activities.  Communities  The largest Bosnian American communities in the US are found in St. Louis (Bevo Mill's \\"Little Bosnia\\"); followed by Chicago, Jacksonville, New York City, Detroit, and Houston. Atlanta has Georgia's largest Bosnian American community with approximately 10,000 in the metro area. Approximately 10,000 Bosnians live in Phoenix, Arizona. Other large Bosnian American communities can be found in the San Francisco Bay Area, as well as in Indianapolis, Hackettstown, New Jersey; Seattle, Washington, Grand Rapids, Michigan; Bowling Green, Kentucky; Erie, Pennsylvania; Nashville, Hartford, Connecticut, Salt Lake City, Portland, Oregon; Utica, New York; Waterloo, Iowa; Fort Wayne, Indiana; Boston; Louisville, Kentucky and Syracuse, New York.

They produce a range of upright and cylinder vacuum cleaners for domestic and commercial use. Sebo vacuum cleaners are endorsed by Allergy UK (the British Allergy Foundation).Newly Endorsed Products Sebo stands for SEmigewerbliche BOdenpflege, German for semi- commercial floor care.http://sebo.esc58.com/res/docs/SEBO_PORTRAIT_EN.PDF History and commercial heritage SEBO was established in 1978 by two German engineers, Klaus Stein and Heinz Kaulig, who were seeking to build a reliable, powerful and easy to use commercial upright vacuum cleaner. Klaus Stein had previously worked at Vorwerk, the manufacturer of the Kobold vacuum cleaner since 1929. The first SEBO factory was located in Velbert, West Germany in a disused weaving factory where they developed in 1978 the SEBO 350 upright commercial vacuum cleaner. http://www.sebo.de/de/unternehmen.html The 350 was their first upright vacuum cleaner and it was engineered for commercial uses. The company understood that most cleaning staff weren't motivated to perform simple maintenance or be concerned about the operational status of the machine; their job was to clean the floor and their employer provided a machine so that they could do their job. If the machine was \\"complicated\\" for the employee to use, then the machine isn't any good. They still had to vacuum, but didn't care that the machine needed the disposable filter bag to be changed, readjusted for different floor surfaces, or that there was a clog somewhere. With that in mind, it offered a degree of functionality that didn't require the user to read an operations manual before using. It was equipped with a commercial-grade motor that could run continuously for 1000 hours or 41 days. The 350 was designed to pass the hardest test; to survive the abuse and neglect of cleaning professionals. Due to the patented technical features that allowed effective cleaning of all kinds of carpets and bare floors, plus the ability to clean in the tightest corners, the 350, which indicated that the brush vibrator bar was , was sold and used in hotels, hospitals and offices. With the addition of features like a clutch-protected brush roller, a by-pass motor and hospital-grade filtration, the first SEBO found acceptance in the market by 1979. Commercial cleaning manufacturers such as Windsor Kärcher and Jeyes Hygiene re-branded SEBO uprights under their own name during the early 1980s. In 1986, the SEBO 360 was launched to replace the 350. The 360 had a simple, electronic surface height adjustment feature that would automatically raise or lower the carpet nozzle based on different cleaning surfaces. It would also notify if there was a brush obstruction or if the disposable filter bag was full. By 1998, the company celebrated 20 years of SEBO Stein & Co. and the 1,500,000th unit built was a SEBO AUTOMATIC X1. Launched in May 2014, the new SEBO EVOLUTION commercial upright brings more improvements to the existing range. SEBO's products are offered in two formats, canisters and uprights. The models consist of the 350, 360 and successor 370 models and the BS36/46 models dependent on floor head widths for the commercial and retail market. =Upright models= SEBO \\"Automatic X\\" /X1/X1.1/X4/X5 In 1991, SEBO began to branch into the domestic market with an upright cleaner known as \\"Automatic X1\\" upright and built from commercial components and low energy release motor. A re-designed version of the earlier 360, the BS36 was also introduced. Other manufacturers offered an integrated attachment hose that would extend for cleaning hard to reach areas or dusting, but the Automatic X1 included a holster wand that was easily removed from the machine and stored simple cleaning attachments on the back. Featuring a low watt 850 watt motor, computer controlled height adjustment, a lifetime guaranteed drive belt system, S-Class filtration, easy access block-check doors and an easy access brush-roll with shut off mechanism to sense clogs or obstructions, the X1 Automatic is designed to be user/owner repairable. The design continues on with the cosmetic X1.1, X4 and X5 with increased motors from 1150 watts to 1300 watts. SEBO's commercial machines continued to supply the industry market with commercial products as well as bigger floor head versions such as X2 and X3, two versions that are still available to buy in other European countries. Eventually the X1A receives a higher motor increase to 1000 watts before it is replaced by the X1.1 in 1999. The X1.1 remains to be a UK specific model only compared to the X4 Extra with slightly uprated motor power to 1300 watts. Both models with different colours are available to buy in the UK. A larger \\"big foot\\" model based on the X4 was also launched a few years later, called the \\"X5,\\" available worldwide. In September 2014, the X series is modified to reduce the maximum motor input power from 1300W to 1100W, and it is known as \\"X series ECO\\". X1.1, X4 and X5 all have an 1100 watt motor and only differ from different specs and colours. In March 2015, SEBO presents the X4 Pet Boost upright with a central push button for deeper cleaning option on carpets and hard floors. Private franchise labels are introduced to exclusive SEBO models such as X4 Pro for Euronics stores and X4 Excel for the British John Lewis Department Stores. SEBO Dart/Felix In 2005, SEBO launched the \\"swivel neck\\" upright, which meant the connector to the motorized brush cleaning unit could turn aiding in flexibility. The SEBO Dart, aimed at the commercial market and its domestic equivalent, the \\"Felix\\" with additional features that domestic customers demand, to include interchangeable floor heads or a power nozzle that are available for both machines to deal with a variety of floor types. The floorhead/powerhead can also be removed from the main body, and the handle folded down to convert the unit into a portable, handheld cleaner in a canister mode. The powerhead fitted to all Felix models (Not Dart) is the ET-1 (premium) type which has a foot pedal recline similar to the X series. The ET1 features a manual 4 position height adjustment dial to suit different flooring types. LED control panel indicates brush roll monitoring at all times if height adjustment is set too high and automatic shut off of the motor if brushroll becomes obstructed, strained or jammed. The brush roll motor can be switched off manually for use on hard floors, and automatically shuts off when the machine is in the upright locked position. Like the X series, the brush roll can be easily removed for cleaning or replacement. In 2010, SEBO introduces the \\"DISCO\\" polisher buffer. With an optional hard floor round crystal and polishing discs for polishing and cleaning hard floors, the DISCO head can be used with both Felix and Dart models. The Dart 3 comes as a package with the Disco head. Other than a similar attachment for Kirby Vacuum Cleaners, the Felix/Dart is the only machine offering this feature. The Dart 1 and Dart 2 machines feature a similar power head range to the Felix, and in 2 widths, 31 cm, and 37 cm (similar to the commercial BS36 and BS46 and SM1/SM2) but no facility to shut off brush roll is offered for longevity of usage in commercial areas. The Dart 4 is supplied with the SEBO \\"Kombi\\" floor head and offers variable suction control. Other versions of Dart has fixed suction. All models feature a 3.5 litre bag capacity and piston bag full indicator set into the lid of the bag housing. A unique feature of the Felix and the Dart is that the main exhaust filter also forms the covering of the bag compartment, and on the Felix, can be customised with different colour fabric designs. Sebo supply a 3 layer electrostatic fabric disposable bag for the Felix/Dart, which is an improvement on earlier paper bags. The original SEBO Felix/Dart is rated at 1300W for the suction motor and 175W for the powerhead motor. The new EU directive for reducing vacuum cleaner wattage from September 2014 means a whole re-launch for SEBO products. Felix & Dart are fitted with 700 watts for the domestic market and 1000 watt Dart models for the commercial markets. A new F9 filter has been redesigned and fitted to the SEBO Felix Pet, designed to give heat protection and increased allergen retention. SEBO Evolution 300/350/450 Launched in 2014, consisting of three (Evolution 300, 350 and 450) models with varying cleaning widths, this range is literally an \\"evolution\\" of the old BS36/46 commercial, incorporating refreshed styling similar to the BS36/46, but differences include a power on/off kick switch on the side of the cleaner head, single motor, and re-designed cord replacement. In the UK, this range replaces the 370 Comfort uprights. =Canister models= SEBO \\"Airbelt C\\" SEBO's first cylinder/canister vacuum cleaner for the domestic market, the C series was launched in 1995 and though sited as a main rival to Miele and other premium brands, the C series offered an eco-friendly 1500 watt motor when most of the rivals had much more powerful motors. Equipped with an award-winning Ergo-handle and a highly efficient filter system called \\"AirBelt,\\" the C series quickly became a worldwide success. The AirBelt design acts to diffuse clean air from the main filters on board the vacuum and emits clean air from the sides of the vacuum cleaner as opposed to the top of the vacuum that can affect the breathing of the owner at time of usage. With a foot-operated roller suction dial and a comfort handle, also copied by Miele on their later machines, SEBO's highly compact C series also uses the X series large disposable dust bag, loaded from underneath the machine to cut costs and extend accessibility. The design amasses awards from the Good Housekeeping Institute and was the first cylinder vacuum on the market to be credited with the British Allergy Foundation seal of approval among other organisations. By using the same capacity large dust bag as the X1 Automatic upright, this feature allowed buyers to independently choose between an upright vacuum or a more compact cylinder vacuum. Eventually SEBO launched the C1, C2.1 and premium C3 series with an electric power nozzle floor head, known as \\"ET-H.\\" The C Series is long discontinued, but parts and accessories are still available. SEBO \\"Airbelt D\\" In 2010, SEBO replaced the C series vacuum with the D1, D2, D3 and D4 series - the largest cylinder vacuum SEBO has ever produced for the domestic market and specifically designed for large homes. Designed in collaboration with Achim Heine, Professor of product design and member of the German Design Council, whose timeless design is famous with Braun's small appliances, this innovative new vacuum emanates form and function, led by SEBO's original design knowledge. For example, the circular front, with its patented airbelt bumper, is ideal for negotiating obstacles, houses an easy to remove filter inside, and allows a large capacity 6 litre disposable high filtration dust bag. An extra long 12m cable contributes to an incredible 15.5m cleaning range, twice the cord length that other German brands supply. To give maximum performance the air path has been optimised and a cone shaped hose has also been used, which improves suction and prevents clogging. A new turbo fan motor uses the latest turbine technology to give superlative cleaning power that reduces motor noise and the vacuum carries on with the famous AirBelt clean air diffuser bumper as well as protecting both the vacuum and general usage in a home. The D series vacuum cleaner is an instant success with GHI. Red Dot Award and other organisations approving this model for its excellent new filtration design and usage. SEBO also add the ET-1 power head option and handle remote control with the white D4 model called the \\"D4 Premium\\", and in late 2011, a commercial version known as the \\"Professional D\\" is also launched with an pigtail interchangeable industry manual cord, low eco friendly 1200 watt motor and a design specifically catered for the commercial market. The D4 Premium also features a unique novel ring of blue LED's around the control dial that highlights visual suction speed according to motor speed. Lower models such as the D2 Storm, D2 Titan, and D2 Total only have a single LED next to the rotary power adjustment knob to indicate power on status. The D series features a mechanical piston bag full indicator next to the hose outlet, and 4 swivel castors on the underside for maximum movement in space restricted areas. As of March 2014 most UK domestic models of the D series including the D4 Premium are fitted with a 2100W motor. To comply with the EU directive, the latest D2 series from SEBO features a range of 700 watt or 1200 watt models to replace older 1600 watt/2100 watt models. The ET-1 power nozzle remains unchanged rated at 175 watts. In other countries and Germany, the D1 and D3 series offer several different permutations including a lower energy model with 1200 watts. SEBO Airbelt E Designed in conjunction with a German design specialist, the E Airbelt cylinder vacuum features a 3.5 litre dust capacity, lightweight and space efficient design with a one touch cord rewind, a motor protection system built in and a new filtration system. It is intended to eventually replace the AIRBELT K series compact vacuum and will be available in E1 and E3 models. Models with 700 watts and 1200 watts are available, as is the E3 Premium with ET-1 power nozzle. SEBO \\"Airbelt K\\" The K1 and K3 series \\"compact\\" cylinder vacuum was launched in 2002, designed to offer domestic homes with a smaller version of the C series. Using a four layer filtration 3 litre dust bag, (also with the bag door forming part of the underside of the machine) and similar Hospital grade filter system developed on the C series, the K series was also awarded with the British Allergy Foundation seal of approval and carried on with the AirBelt Clean Air diffuser design. Unlike the C series, the K series has only 3 swivel castors. The K is designed to be space efficient and smaller than the C series. Initially fitted with an 1800 watt motor to compete in the market with rivals and featured a new 500gram lighter tube and hose system earned design awards for this model. Also equipped with a longer domestic market hose and 6 metres of cable length, the K series remains popular. SEBO further offered the K1 \\"Komfort\\" featuring two different floor heads - a parquet head and full size turbo brush; the K1 \\"Pet\\" which included a turbo mini head and full size turbo brush, (but no specific head for hard floors); the K3 \\"Vulcano\\" with a remote electronic suction control added to the handle grip and supplied with the Deluxe Kombi head plus the full size turbo brush, and a small dusting brush; and the K3 \\"Premium\\" top of the range model, with remote control handle grip, dusting brush and an electric ET-H power head similar to the C3. As from early 2014, SEBO have now started supplying the K3 Premium with the later ET-1 powerhead which is fitted to the current Felix range, and the D4 Premium. All models in the K series have an orange bag full indicator light, and the Vulcano and Premium models also have a green \\"mains on\\" / standby light. K1 models have a lightweight crushproof hose that swivels both ends, but the K3 Vulcano and Premium have a heavier electric hose that does not swivel at the machine end, so does tend to be a slightly more unwieldy in use. In 2011, SEBO further enhanced the K series with a longer 2.1 metre hose on higher variant models (Komfort, Pet, Vulcano and Premium) and 1.8 metres on the red base model K1 Airbelt. Later, 1800 watts remained the standard for the base level K1 Airbelt, whilst 2100 watt motors were fitted to all other K models, to compete with Miele's 2200 watt vacuums. To conform to EU Directive (EU) No 666/2013 of 8 July 2013, SEBO launched an updated K1 Eco Comfort Plus with a 700 watt motor to comply with the impending EU law requiring vacuum cleaners to be limited to 1600 watts (from Sept 2014) and later (by 2017) to 900 watts. The K3 Vulcano variant is discontinued in September 2014, following the new ECO range introduction, although SEBO have launched both 1200 watt models alongside the 700 watt models. SEBO Duo Cleaning System In addition to their vacuum cleaners, SEBO also offer a dry powder cleaning agent for carpets which they call \\"Duo P\\" This powder can be distributed across carpet using a sprinkler dispenser, and scrubbed into the carpet with a brush or the SEBO Duo Daisy, which is a wheeled long handled brush, for easier distribution of the powder. Alternatively, for optimum penetration of the powder deep into carpet pile, the motorized SEBO Duo cleaning machine can be used, which achieves the best results on large areas of carpet. After the powder has been allowed to permeate the carpet fibres for an hour, it can be vacuumed up, with any vacuum cleaner.

History Cinema in Morocco has a long history, stretching back over a century to the filming of Le chevrier Marocain (\\"The Moroccan Goatherd\\") by Louis Lumière in 1897. Between that time and 1944, many foreign movies were shot in the country, especially in the Ouarzazate area. In 1944, the Moroccan Cinematographic Center (CCM), the nation's film regulatory body, was established. Studios were also opened in Rabat. In 1952, Orson Welles' Othello won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival under the Moroccan flag. However, the Festival's musicians did not play the Moroccan national anthem, as no one in attendance knew what it was. Six years later, Mohammed Ousfour would create the first Moroccan movie, Le fils maudit (\\"The Damned Son\\"). In 1968, the first Mediterranean Film Festival was held in Tangier. In its current incarnation, the event is held in Tetouan. This was followed in 1982 with the first national festival of cinema, which was held in Rabat. In 2001, the first International Film Festival of Marrakech (FIFM) was also held in Marrakech. Film industry in Morocco =Directors= Morocco has known a first generation of directors in the 70s-90s.
