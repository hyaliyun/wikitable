Their music is a fusion of rock, cumbia, and Mexican traditional music like mariachi and son, creating the genre called guacarrock (rock and guacamole). The band was always distinguished by a festive and irreverent musical fusion, celebrating the culture of the nacos and integrating sketches and albures in its lyrics and concerts. Its style, standard rock, was combined with satirical lyrics that portrayed urban life and popular culture in Mexico City. In their song \\"Guaca Rock de la Malinche\\", they coined the phrase Todo lo naco es chido (Everything tacky is cool), trying to re-vindicate the popular culture of the lower socio-economic classes. Botellita de Jerez pioneered a lot of trends from contemporary art in Mexico and the United States, since it incorporated motifs from popular use, such as lucha libre, popular dances and slang, which are now commonly used among the upper classes as well. The name of the band comes from a Mexican saying used as rebuttal in an argument: \\"Botellita de jerez, todo lo que me digas, ser√° al rev√©s\\", which literally means: \\"Bottle of sherry, all you say to me will be otherwise\\" However, the equivalent English idiom is: \\"I'm rubber, you're glue, whatever you say bounces off me and sticks to you.\\" One of their most notable songs is \\"Ni√±a de mis ojos\\" included in the LP of the same name, which has been released on the albums \\"El Ultimo Guacarrock\\" and \\"Superespecial Un Plug\\". The signature songs of Botellita de Jerez are \\"Guacarrock\\", \\"El Guaca Rock de la Malinche\\", \\"Alarmala de Tos\\", \\"Oh Denny's\\" and \\"Abuelita de Batman\\" (The Granny of Batman) which became the first cumbia-rock of the rock band, the song is notable for its parody-music video filmed in Colonia Santa Mar√≠a la Ribera in Mexico City.  Feature film  In 2010, Sergio Arau (known as his stage name of Uyuyuy within the band) directed a mockumentary entitled \\"Naco es Chido\\", detailing the aftermath of the band's fictional break-up and subsequent reunion (called \\"arrejunte\\"). All three members of the band star as themselves, along with interviews with various Mexican musicians and other personalities, including Carlos Monsivais (shortly before his death) and writer Laura Esquivel. The film is a comedic homage to both the Botellita de Jerez act as well as its multi-generational fandom, combining real interviews, news reports, edited music videos and actual footage from the band's early years to tell their quasi-fictional story. It was released to an overwhelmingly limited run in selected Mexican theaters, being neglected by major distributors and later made available in DVD to the public in either bootlegs or the band's self-produced copies. In March 2013, the band announced that, after 30 years in the Mexican rock scene, Botellita de Jerez was over.

Double digging is a gardening technique used to increase soil drainage and aeration. It involves the loosening of two layers of soil, and the addition of organic matter. Double digging is typically done when cultivating soil in a new garden, or when deep top-soil is required. On poor or heavy soils, or for vegetable gardens, double digging might be required every 3‚Äì5 years. In other cases, double digging is only really needed on starting a new garden, or on total replanting. First the top layer is dug off with a spade, forming a shallow trench, and then the under-layer (at the bottom of the trench) is dug with a fork. When breaking up the lower layer, organic matter such as compost is usually added to the soil. If the soil is in need of other minerals like gypsum or phosphorus this can also be added here. A second trench is then started, backfilling the first trench. This process is repeated until the whole bed has been treated. There will be soil left over from the first trench, which is used to fill the last trench. Walking on top of the bed will tend to compact it, so the gardener must be sure to protect the soil from too much foot traffic.

Basis Businesses choose call avoidance techniques because person- to-person service calls are time-consuming and costly and should be accessed only when there is no viable option. Voice calls can then be reserved for high priority customers, complex service requests, or emergency situations where the quick response of skilled phone agents is essential. Concerns It is impractical and expensive for call centers to provide a live answer for every caller during peak demand periods such as certain times of the day, days of the week, or seasons. Callers in urgent need to discuss an issue with a live person are typically put on hold along with callers whose request could be better served through other channels. Both are competing for valuable talk time. Strategies With the spread of the Internet and email access, contact centers are moving toward self services via a searchable knowledgebase, Interactive Voice Response (IVR), or computer generated emails. Password resets are the most popular form of website self-service where clients are asked pre-established confidential questions that verify credentials before the system sends them a temporary password. Other typical areas to employ call avoidance strategies include the following: *Voice message indicating wait times, unusual activity, downtime, etc. *Web forms that gather pertinent information before a call is answered *Electronic chat via the Internet *Online software update notices of upgrades to prevent security or virus breaches *Blogs, Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ), web site links to common problems *Simpler, clear and concise product documentation and descriptions *Automatic return policies and procedures *Reports that identify key problem areas for corrective action, i.e., additional instruction/training References * Last, Rober S.; \\"Please Don‚Äôt Call Us: Building a Customer- friendly Call Avoidance Strategy for the Support Center\\", Help Desk Institute Newsletter, November/December 2007 * Contact Babel; Getting Call Avoidance Right, A White Paper August, 2007 See also * Call centre * Help desk * Helpdesk and incident reporting auditing * Incident tracking system * Service desk (ITSM) * Technical support * Customer service * Virtual assistance (in German) Category:Telemarketing ","title":"Call avoidance"},{"id":"14924819","text":"Portrait of Joos de Damhouder engraved by Philip Galle Joos de Damhouder (25 November 1507, Bruges ‚Äì 22 January 1581, Antwerp), also referred to as Joost, Jost, Josse or Jodocus (de) Damhouder, was a jurist from Bruges, in the County of Flanders (then part of the Seventeen Provinces). His writings had a lasting influence on European criminal law. Life Born in Bruges, de Damhouder studied law in Leuven and Orl√©ans. After obtaining his doctorate in 1533, he practiced law as an advocate in Bruges. In 1537 he was appointed legal advisor of the city authorities, from which office he retired in 1550 to become clerk of the urban criminal court. In 1552 he was made a member of the Council of Finance by Mary of Hungary, governor of the Habsburg Netherlands, and held that office until 1575. He died 1581 in Antwerp, six years after his wife, with whom he had had three daughters and a son. Writings Praxis rerum civilium, 1596 edition His principal work was the Praxis rerum criminalium (1554), a manual on the practice of criminal law, which he almost entirely plagiarised from an unpublished text by Filips Wielant and from other works. The book was a great success and saw numerous translations in other European languages, partly due to de Damhouder's novel approach of illustrating the various crimes and procedural stages with woodcuts. He later published a complementary work on civil law, the Praxis rerum civilum (1567), which was also an unattributed translation of a work by Wielant. Witch trials The most immediate impact of de Damhouder's works was on the witch trials of the time, in which the Praxis rerum criminalium and its translations were cited regularly as fundamental works. The Praxis dedicated a lengthy 64 paragraphs to witchcraft, copied in large part from Paulus Grillandus's Tractatus de sortilegiis. According to the Praxis, witchcraft was a heinous crime that went unpunished too often because of the ignorance of magistrates, and which also covered love charms, fortune-telling, astrology and other superstitious practices. De Damhouder expanded on this by providing detailed practical advice (backed up by examples from his own court practice) on how to conduct interrogations of suspected witches under torture. These included, for example, the recommendation to shave off all hair and to inspect all orifices of the suspect, in order to uncover hidden magical amulets that would make the wearer withstand torture. He asserted that a single indication of guilt was sufficient for torture to be applied to achieve a confession, though he did recognize that too much torture can produce false confessions.

It was placed on the United States National Register of Historic Places in 1986. With History Because of its proximity to the Main Street mercantile area, Merchants Avenue became a natural residential location for many businessmen and professionals. Home designs were influenced by the gilded age attitude toward architecture. This resulted in many different architectural styles used in the district, including Greek Revival, Italianate, Second Empire, Queen Anne and Spanish Colonial. The predominate building materials used were either the locally manufactured yellow brick or wood, framed into houses with clapboard walls and shingled roofs. Notable buildings These are some of the notable buildings in the district, listed in the general order built. The procession of architectural styles is similar to the rest of southern Wisconsin. * The Dwight Foster house at 414 Foster Street is Fort Atkinson's oldest frame house. It was built in 1841 by Charles Rockwell and sold to Foster a few years later. The house has a simple gabled-ell form with Greek Revival style frieze and cornice returns. In the early years Foster used the house as an inn and post office. It was first built on Main Street, but later moved to its current site at the Hoard Museum. The lumber used was floated down the Rock River from Watertown. Wooden pegs are used throughout and it has cherry cellar stairs. * The Peter Craig house at 513 Foster St. is a cottage built of cream brick in 1855. Its style is Gothic Revival, characterized by the steep roof, the delicate brackets, and symmetry. * The Arthur R. Hoard House at 323 Merchants Ave is the most elaborate building in the district. It was built between 1853 and 1865 for George P. Marston as a 2-story Italianate house, then expanded and restyled as Queen Anne in 1898 by Hoard. * The Joseph Winslow house at 109 S. Third St is a small, Second Empire-style house built in 1861 with a central front tower. * The Hoard Historical Museum at 407 Merchants Avenue was built in 1864 for merchant Reuben White, a two-story brick house with Gothic Revival brackets under the eaves. A wing was added in 1875 and in 1906 Frank Hoard doubled the size of the building and renovated it with an Arts and Crafts motif. The Hoard family donated the building to the city in 1956 for use as a museum. Since then three major additions have been added, including the National Dairy Shrine in 1981. * The M.H. Ganong house at 332 Merchants Ave is a fine 2-story cream brick Italianate home built 1871-73, with broad eaves, oculus windows, and other windows with carved hood molds. Ganong was a prominent merchant, ran a stagecoach line, and served as mayor and postmaster. In the 1930s Harriet Hoard Becker remodeled the house. * The Frank Allen house at 507 Foster is another 2-story cream brick Italianate house with wide eaves and hood molds above the windows, built in 1876 with a 2-story bay window on its south side. * The Horace Willard/Della & Chester Caswell house at 303 Merchants Ave is a two-story house with a Second Empire- styled mansard roof built in 1881. Otherwise it is rather like the Italianate houses above, with cream brick walls, hood molds above the windows, and a two- story bay window. The home is accompanied by a mansard-roofed garage. Horace Willard, a physician, had it built for his daughter Della and her husband Chester Caswell, who was a banker. * The George Klein house at 500 Whitewater Ave is a 2.5-story house with a somewhat Craftsman style and a carriage house out back. * The Herbert Vickery house at 430 Whitewater Ave is a 2.5-story late Queen Anne-styled house built in 1908 for Vickery, a merchant. Hallmarks of the style are its asymmetry, the corner tower, and the complex hip roof. A 2-story horse barn sites toward the back of the lot. * The O.W. Donkle house at 506 Whitewater Ave is a 2.5-story house built in 1910 for Donkle, a cashier at Fort Atkinson Savings Bank. The general massing and varied textures are Queen-Anne-ish. The Palladian windows, returned eaves, and pediment in the front porch are Classical Revival details, which is a typical mix for late Queen Anne. * St. Peter's Episcopal Church at 302 Merchants Ave is a Spanish Colonial Revival church built in 1928. It has a stucco exterior, buttresses, and a stylized bell tower. The church was designed by Eschweiler and Eschweiler of Milwaukee.

Biography Halevy was born Ernst Levi in Wei√üenfels, Germany and educated at the Universities of Freiburg, G√∂ttingen and Berlin. He immigrated to what was then the British Mandate of Palestine in 1933 after Adolf Hitler became Chancellor of Germany, and studied at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Halevy was a Magistrate Judge in Jerusalem during the Mandate period, from 1938 until Israel's declaration of independence in 1948. He served as a District Judge and the President of the Jerusalem District Court until 1963 when he was appointed to the Supreme Court of Israel. Halevy was the sole judge in what became known as the \\"Kastner trial,\\" a libel lawsuit against Malchiel Gruenwald, a hotelier, who accused Rudolf Kastner of having been a Nazi collaborator. Halevy allowed the scope of the trial to be expanded and ruled that Kastner had indeed, in his words, \\"sold his soul to the devil.\\" Kastner was later assassinated and Halevy's ruling was mostly overturned by the Supreme Court. The manner in which he conducted the trial was criticized. Halevy was the sole judge at the trial of the Kafr Qasim massacre's perpetrators, and in his decision famously wrote, \\"The distinguishing mark of a manifestly illegal order is that above such an order should fly, like a black flag, a warning saying: 'Prohibited!'\\" He was later a judge at the trial of Adolf Eichmann, along with Yitzhak Raveh and Moshe Landau. In 1969 Halevy resigned from the court in order to enter politics. He was elected to the Seventh Knesset for the Gahal (Herut-Liberal Bloc) list, and again to the Eighth Knesset in 1973 after Gahal had merged into Likud. He later left the party to sit as an independent MK. In the 1977 elections, he was returned to the Knesset on Dash's list, but the party split up after a year, and Halevy joined the Democratic Movement, before leaving to again sit as an independent. During the Ninth Knesset he also served as deputy speaker. Today a street in his birthplace Wei√üenfels is named after him. He was married for many years to Luba. They had a son and daughter.

He is portrayed by child actor Robert \\"Rusty\\" Stevens. Larry Mondello appears in 68 of the show's 234 episodes over the first few seasons. Although Larry is mentioned in the premiere episode, \\"Beaver Gets 'Spelled\\", it isn't until the eighth episode, \\"Beaver's Crush\\", that he actually makes an appearance. Larry is Theodore \\"Beaver\\" Cleaver's chubby, not very bright classmate and best friend distinguished for his apple- eating, candy bar-munching habits. Larry has a knack for leading Beaver astray and getting him into trouble. Larry's mother, Margaret (portrayed by Madge Blake), is a nervous, exasperated parent, whose husband is so perennially out- of-town on business, the phrase \\"If your father were home . . .\\" comes out of her mouth, at some point, in almost every episode in which she appears. Mrs. Mondello sometimes takes Larry to Beaver's father for discipline. Larry's father makes one brief appearance, however; he is seen talking to Larry backstage in the second-season episode, \\"School Play\\". Larry has older siblings, including a married brother and an unmarried, unseen, and unattractive (according to Larry) 18-year-old sister (age mentioned in the 3rd season) and a little brother mentioned in the 1958 Episode 'Beaver & Henry', who live at home. In one episode, Mrs. Mondello catches Larry and Beaver reading Larry's sister's diary. Reports from various characters on the show indicate Larry's home life is one of \\"hollering\\" and physical punishments. Larry and Beaver have an on-again/off-again relationship. The boys sometimes quarrel but make up when the clouds pass. They are in the same class together at Grant Avenue Grammar School and are forced to attend ballroom dance lessons at Miss Spencer's School of the Dance on Saturdays. In the first season episode Beaver's Short Pants, Larry taunts Beaver at school for having \\"girl's stockings\\" and calls him a \\"sissy\\" for wearing a formal short pants suit with kneesocks, provoking Beaver to punch Larry in the stomach. Larry runs away from home in one episode ‚Äî but only as far as Beaver's bathroom where he sleeps in the bath tub. In another episode, Larry throws his mother's pin money out the window, picks it up later, and claims the money fell from an airplane. Actor Stevens left the show when his family moved from Burbank, California, to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, a move which brought Stevens's acting career to an end. According to Barbara Billingsley (in her TV Archive interview), his character was written out because of his overly ambitious stage mother causing grief with the producers.

The inaugural performance was Les Mousquetaires de la reine, a comic opera by Fromental Hal√©vy, followed a few days later by La Juive, Hal√©vy's most famous opera. Today, the opera house is one of the country's national historic monuments. It is currently the home of the Op√©ra Toulon Provence M√©diterran√©e, under the direction of Claude-Henri Bonnet.

History of the Toulon Opera House  The Toulon Opera House (Fr: Le Grand The√¢tre de Toulon) was one of a wave of lyric opera houses built in France and Europe in the middle of the 19th century, and it represented the exuberant style of the Second Empire. Its construction began on 5 March 1860, two years before the start of construction of the Palais Garnier. The designer was L√©on Feuch√©res, who had renovated the Marseille Opera House and built the opera house in Avignon. He died in 1860, and the work was finished by Paris architects Charpentier, p√©re et fils. The 15-meter canvas on the ceiling was painted and its plaster ornament designed by Louis Duveau, who also created the ceiling of the Grand Salon of the Imperial Apartments in the Napoleon Wing of the Louvre. The opera house was the setting for the French film ' (The Curse of Belphegor), by Georges Combret, in 1966.

The line ran from downtown Chicago to Jackson Park, with branches to Englewood, Normal Park, Kenwood, and the Union Stock Yards. The first of the line opened on June 6, 1892, and much of its route is still used today as part of the Green Line of the Chicago \\"L\\" system. Chicago and South Side Rapid Transit Railroad The Chicago and South Side Rapid Transit Railroad Company was incorporated on January 4, 1888, and secured a franchise from the City of Chicago on March 26 of that year to construct an elevated railroad between Van Buren Street and 39th Street (Pershing Road). The franchise required the company to build along a right of way immediately adjacent and parallel to one of the alleys from Van Buren Street to 37th Street, rapidly earning the line the nickname of the \\"alley L\\". On April 2, 1892 the city authorized the extension of the line as far south as 71st street, and a further extension along 63rd Street was passed on April 7, 1893, the total cost of construction was estimated at $6,750,000. A 6-car train carrying 300 guests made the inaugural run along first section of the line‚Äîrunning between a station at 39th Street and the Congress Terminal downtown‚Äîon May 27, 1892, and the line opened to the public ten days later. Initially the journey from 39th street to downtown took 14 minutes and cost 5¬¢. The line was gradually extended over the following months, with the route reaching Jackson Park on May 12, 1893 to provide service to the World's Columbian Exposition. Rolling stock on the line included 46 Forney-type (0-4-4) steam locomotives that were built at the Baldwin Locomotive Works in Philadelphia, and 180 -long wooden passenger cars. The first 20 locomotives were delivered coupled into a single train in April 1892. The South Side Elevated railroad provided 24-hour service, a major advantage when compared to Chicago's cable railroads which required daily overnight shutdown for cable maintenance.Cudahy, Brian J. Destination Loop. Brattleboro, Vermont: Stephen Greene Press; 1982. p.13 After midnight, two trains ran on the line, providing service every 20 minutes; in contrast, rush- hour service required 18 trains to maintain a schedule with a 3-minute headway. Bankruptcy and takeover When the World's Columbian Exposition closed, lack of development along the southern portion of the route led to plummeting passenger numbers. The Chicago and South Side Rapid Transit Railroad Company went into receivership in 1895 and was sold under foreclosure on September 16, 1896 for $4,100,100. The South Side Elevated Railroad was formed to take over the route in 1897. Service was extended into the newly built Union Loop on October 18, 1897 connecting the South Side Elevated Railroad with the Lake Street Elevated Railroad, the Metropolitan West Side Elevated Railroad, and (after 1900) the Northwestern Elevated Railroad. These other companies used third rail electrification to power their trains so the South Side Elevated Railroad enlisted Frank Julian Sprague to convert its rolling stock to electrical power. Sprague used his previously untested system of multiple-unit train control (MU) whereby multiple self-powered cars could be linked together and controlled by a single person, making the South Side Elevated Railroad the first in the world to use MU operation. Branches As ridership increased, the South Side Elevated Railroad constructed additional branches. A branch to Englewood opened in stages between 1905 and 1907 (with the short Normal Park branch opening in 1907), and branches to Kenwood and the Union Stock Yards‚Äîboth running on tracks owned by the Chicago Junction Railroad‚Äîopened in 1907 and 1908 respectively. Consolidation In 1913 Chicago's four elevated railroad companies came together to form the Chicago Elevated Railways Collateral Trust establishing crosstown services for the first time, and in 1924 all four companies were formally united to form the Chicago Rapid Transit Company. The Chicago Transit Authority took over the assets of the CRT in 1947. The Normal Park branch closed in 1954 and the Kenwood and Stock Yards branches were abandoned in 1957 but most of the rest of the route of the South Side Elevated Railroad continues in service as part of the CTA's Green Line.

It is one of many gene families related to the atonal gene in Drosophila. Other positive regulators of neuronal differentiation also expressed during early neural development include NeuroD and ASCL1. In neural crest cells, the neurogenin family is essential for neurogenesis in the developing dorsal root ganglia and development of the sensory lineage.  Neurogenin-1  Neurogenin 1 (Ngn1) is a Class-A basic- helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor that acts as a regulator for neuronal differentiation, and acts by binding to enhancer regulatory elements on genes that encode transcriptional regulators of neurogenesis. In order for Ngn1 to bind with high fidelity with genomic DNA, it must dimerize with another bHLH protein. Ngn1 is a proneural gene because its expression is seen prior to neural lineage determination, indicating it plays a role in neuronal differentiation. =Neuronal differentiation= In E14 rats, when Ngn1 is present in the cerebral cortex, it binds to the CBP/p300/Smad1 transcriptional co-activator complex, which recruits it to the enhancer box upstream of the gene in the promoter for neuronal genes. Binding of Ngn1, to the enhancer box, induces the transcription factor NeuroD to bind to its own enhancer boxes, inducing the genes involved in neuronal differentiation. Regulation by BMP Bone-morphogenetic-protein (BMP) signaling is responsible for the expression of the transcriptional co-activators CBP, p300, and Smad1. In the presence of Ngn1, BMPs promote neuronal differentiation in stem cells through binding of all endogenous CBP/p300/Smad1 to Ngn1, and being recruited toward the neuronal promoters, causing neuronal differentiation. In the embryonic forebrain, Ngn1 is associated with dorsal patterning and cell fate specification, with the patterning molecules and proneural proteins establishing the spatial domains of both proneural and homeodomain protein expression. This is critical for the initiation of neurogenesis. Regulation by LIF In the presence of Ngn1, the leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) pathway is inhibited by Ngn1 blocking STAT activation. Normally, the STAT binding site promotes GFAP transcription through binding the STAT1/3 complex, which is activated through the LIF pathway. =Glial differentiation= Along with supporting neuronal differentiation, when expressed in embryonic neural tissue, Ngn1 also acts to inhibit glial differentiation. In the absence of Ngn1, the CBP/p300/Smad1 transcriptional co-activator complex is recruited to and binds to activated STAT1/3, which in turn causes the expression of GFAP, causing glial differentiation. In the presence of Ngn1, inhibition of gliogenesis occurs through Ngn1 binding to the CBP/p300/Smad1 transcriptional co-activator complex, recruiting it away from STAT1/3. Regulation by BMP In cases of low levels of Ngn1, BMPs promote glial differentiation. Since Ngn1 is the limiting factor, CBP/p300/Smad1 is able to interact with STAT1/3 and induce gliogenesis. Regulation by Notch Activation of the notch pathway, causes the inhibition of proneural bHLH genes, such as Ngn1, which allows for the CBP/p300/Smad1 to interact with STAT1/3 and induce gliogenesis. Along with the embryonic rat, it was also seen in zebrafish that the repression of Ngn1 by Notch, promotes glial lineage in neural crest and central nervous system formation through the inhibition of neuronal differentiation. In addition to the Notch pathway activating the transcriptional factors involved in the promotion of gliogenesis, it is possible that these same factors are involved in the inhibition of other fates. Regulation by LIF In the absence of Ngn1, the LIF pathway is able to activate STAT1/3, which allows for the promotion of GFAP transcription via the STAT binding site. The promotion of GFAP transcription induced glial differentiation.  Neurogenin-2  Neurogenin 2 (Ngn2) is a bHLH transcription factor involved in both neurogenesis and neural specification. This protein binds to enhancer-box regulatory elements on the promoters of many genes related to neurogenesis and neural specification. For sufficient DNA binding, Ngn2 must form a dimer with an enhancer protein. =Neurogenesis and glial inhibition= Ngn2 is a transcription factor that both increases expression of proneural genes and drives neural fate by inhibiting expression of glial genes in neural progenitor cells (NPCs). This was observed in mice lacking Ngn2 and mash-1 (another proneural bHLH transcription factor), which have more glia in the cortex and decreased capacity to generate neurons. Olig2 expression in what will become NPCs precedes Ngn2 and promotes its expression. During the switch from neural progenitor fate to glial fate, Ngn2 is downregulated and Nkx2.2, which inhibits proneural genes, is upregulated. Glial fate switch was reduced by inhibiting Nkx2.2 and Olig2 in neural progenitors while allowing the expression of Ngn2. The ability of Olig2 to induce expression of Ngn2 is reduced when Nkx2.2 is expressed. =Neural specification= Mice lacking Ngn2 have fewer motor neurons and ventral interneurons, indicating that Ngn2 plays a role in specification of these neurons. Pan-neuronal fate Heterodimerized Ngn2/enhancer protein complex can bind to enhancer boxes to promote transcription of genes related to a non-specified neuronal fate. V2 interneuron fate When an enhancer box of a promoter that has been bound by the Ngn-2/enhancer protein complex is also bound by a dimer of the adaptor nuclear LIM interactor (NLI) bound to two LIM homeobox protein 3 (Lhx3), genes related to V2 interneuron identity are expressed. Motor neuron fate A dimer of the adaptor NLI bound to two islet 1 (Isl1) proteins and each Isl1 is bound by Lhx3 is called the LIM-homeodomain (LIM-HD) transcription complex. When an enhancer box of a promoter that has been bound by the heterodimerized Ngn2/E-protein complex, the LIM-HD transcription complex is able to bind to drive expression of genes related to motor neuron fate, but only if Ngn2 has been properly phosphorylated. Ngn2 has two serines, S231 and S234, which can be phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase 3 (Gsk3). Phosphorylation of Ngn2 enables interaction with LIM-homeodomain proteins, leading to ventral neural fate and motor neuron specification. The importance of this phosphorylation was determined by using mice that express a mutated form of Ngn2 protein which has the serines from the previously mentioned phosphorylation sites mutated into alanines, which cannot be phosphorylated. These mutant mice have a decreased number of motor neurons and an increased number of V2 interneurons, suggesting that phosphorylation is necessary for driving expression of genes related to motor neuron fate but not V2 interneuron fate and non-specified neural fate.  Neurogenin-3 Neurogenin 3 (Ngn3) is another member of the bHLH family of transcription factors. Ngn3 functions in the differentiation of endocrine pancreas cells. Although its key function is in the pancreas, intestinal cells and neural cells express Ngn3 as well. Several studies have highlighted the importance of Ngn3 for differentiation of endocrine cells. In mice, Ngn3 is present in cells as the pancreas begins to bud and glucagon cells are formed. There are several pathways that Ngn3 works through. Ngn3 is a crucial component in pancreatic development and plays a supporting role in intestinal as well as neuronal cell development. Studies have demonstrated that knockout of Ngn3 in mice leads to death shortly after birth possibly due to after effects of severe diabetes. Further studies are taking place to investigate Ngn3‚Äôs possible role as a treatment for diabetes and regeneration of cells in the pancreas. Neurogenin 3 (NGN3) is expressed by 2-10% of acinar and duct cells in the histologically normal adult human pancreas. NGN3+ cells isolated from cultured exocrine tissue by coexpressed cell surface glycoprotein CD133 have a transcriptome consistent with exocrine dedifferentiation, a phenotype that resembles endocrine progenitor cells during development, and a capacity for endocrine differentiation in vitro. Human and rodent exocrine cells have been reprogrammed into cells with an islet cell-like phenotype following direct expression of NGN3 or manipulation that leads to its expression. = Phases of pancreatic development = The development of the pancreas is broken up into three phases, primary phase, secondary phase, and tertiary phase. Ngn3 is active in the primary and secondary phase. In the primary phase Ngn3 assists in Œ± cell differentiation and in the secondary phase another wave of Ngn3 assists in differentiation of Œ≤ cells, pancreatic polypeptide cells, and Œ¥ cells. Differentiation is marked as complete after the secondary phase. Ngn3 allows for the commitment of pancreatic progenitor cells to become an endocrine multipotent pro-precursor. = Modulation via notch pathway = The Notch pathway is one of the key modulators of Ngn3. The binding of Delta and Serrate, activation ligands for the Notch pathway, activates the Notch surface molecule. This allows the Notch intracellular domain to activate RBK-JŒ∫ to translocate into the nucleus. This complex then activates hairy and enhancer of split (HES)-type proteins, which are inhibitors of Ngn3. The cells that allow the Notch/RBK-JŒ∫ complex to enter are the ones that will not be differentiated into pancreatic cells because Ngn3 is suppressed. It‚Äôs important to mention that Ngn3 has three HES1 binding sites adjacent to the TATA box sequence that allow for the regulation of this transcription factor. = Downstream targets of Ngn3 =  NeuroD  Ngn3 can also activate the neurogenic differentiation factor 1(NeuroD1) like most of its other family members through the enhancer boxes present in its structure. Being that NeuroD1 is expressed along with Ngn3 in differentiating cells, it is considered one of the transcription factors downstream targets.  Pax4  Another important target is paired box gene 4 (Pax4), which plays a major role in Œ≤ cell and Œ¥ cell differentiation. Ngn3 works hand-in-hand with HNF1Œ± to activate the Pax4 promoter to induce specific cell differentiation.  Nkx2.2  Another transcription factor that may be a downstream target of Ngn3 is Nkx2.2 because it‚Äôs often coexpressed with it. Studies have shown that disrupting Nkx2.2 expression results in problems with Œ± and Œ≤ cell differentiation.

In the game, ducks fly one at a time across the screen, and the player shoots at them using a light gun attached to the game cabinet. The player gets three shots per duck; ducks change direction away from missed shots and fall to the bottom of the screen when hit. A screen overlay adds images of reeds and a tree branch, and an image of a duck is added to a row at the top of the screen whenever a duck is hit. Games continue until a time limit, set by the machine operator, is reached. Development of Qwak! began in 1974, finishing in November. It was presented at the November 1974 Music Operators of America (MOA) Music & Amusement Machines Exposition for release that month. The game was not commercially successful; according to Ralph H. Baer, it sold approximately 250 units. A two-player clone game by U.S. Billiards, Duck Shooting, was produced around the same time, and Qwak! has been noted as a possible inspiration for the 1984 Nintendo Entertainment System light gun game Duck Hunt. Gameplay Qwak! is a duck hunting arcade game in which the player uses a rifle-shaped light gun to fire at targets on the screen. One duck at a time flies across the screen, with each duck appearing in a different place on the sides of the screen and flying in different paths. The player is allowed three shots to hit the duck as it flies across the screen. As with other light gun games, a hit is registered if the gun is pointed at the duck or similar light source when the trigger is pulled; no projectile is fired. When a shot is fired, a mark appears on the screen where the player was aiming; if the shot misses the duck, it changes direction away from the bullet. If the player hits a duck, it falls to the ground, and a hunting dog runs over and collects it. Each duck hit adds a small image of a duck to a row at the top of the screen. A screen overlay shows an image of marsh reeds and a tree branch. The gun is attached to the game cabinet by a metal cord, and is holstered in a small circular recess in the cabinet when not in use. Attempting to remove the gun sounds an alarm buzzer. Each game costs a quarter, and runs until the time limit runs out. Machines have adjustable time limits or can be set to run each game indefinitely, starting the score count over when the start button is pressed. Development The game was developed by Atari, Inc. beginning in 1974; the earliest schematics in the service manual are from June 1974, while the last is from November. The schematics bear the logos of both Atari and Kee Games, a subsidiary company set up by Atari in 1973 in order to reach more distributors, which was merged with Atari in December 1974. The game was announced and shown at the Music Operators of America (MOA) Music & Amusement Machines Exposition on November 1‚Äì3, 1974, for release that month. It was then advertised in the December 7 issue of Cash Box. Qwak! was released in a standard upright arcade cabinet with a black and white raster television monitor inset, with the rifle holster and start button below as the only controls. The reeds and tree branch overlay is screen printed in color onto a clear panel in front of the monitor, and is backlit by the screen; the screen is lit with a gray background instead of a black one in order to produce this effect. When the gun is triggered, the duck additionally flashes white briefly, so as to be detected by the light gun; the relative brightness of the screen makes this effect less obvious than with other similar light gun games. Qwak! was not the first light gun video game; it was preceded by the arcade game Balloon Gun (August 1974) and a light gun game for the Magnavox Odyssey video game console (1972), as well as non-video game light gun games since the 1936 Seeberg Ray-O-Lite. Legacy Qwak did not perform well commercially; according to Ralph H. Baer in his book Videogames: In the Beginning, it sold only approximately 250 units. In the November 16, 1974 issue of Cash Box, U.S. Billiards announced a two-player clone game titled Duck Shooting; the game features a projected seven foot by seven foot screen instead of a monitor, and allows two players to shoot at multiple ducks at once. In 1982, Atari developed a prototype for a touch-screen duck themed game similarly titled Qwak. With the goal of \\"Help[ing] mama duck and her three ducklings get home safely\\", the player shifts picture blocks into place to create a safe path for the ducks to get home. The player's score in the 15 levels is determined by how long the ducks are on-screen and by how many get home safely. Critics have noted the similarity between Qwak! and the 1984 Nintendo light gun game for the Nintendo Entertainment System titled Duck Hunt. Nintendo used that similarity in a 1986 court case attempting to invalidate a patent held by Sanders Associates; the patent, filed by Ralph Baer, was for the light gun peripheral used in the Magnavox Odyssey light gun game and held to be infringed on by Duck Hunt. Nintendo unsuccessfully claimed that Baer had based his patent not only on the Odyssey work but also on Qwak! as seen by him at the 1974 MOA show.

The situation in the area after the 1994 ceasefire. Armenian forces of Nagorno- Karabakh currently control almost 9% of Azerbaijan's territory outside the former Nagorno Karabakh Autonomous Oblast. Azerbaijani forces control Shahumian and the eastern parts of Martakert and Martuni. Armenians have lived in the Karabakh region since the period of antiquity.Hewsen, Robert H. Armenia: A Historical Atlas. Chicago: Chicago University Press, 2001. In the beginning of the 2nd century BC. Karabakh became a part of Armenian Kingdom as province of Artsakh. In the 14th century, a local Armenian leadership emerged, consisting of five noble dynasties led by princes, who held the titles of meliks and were referred to as Khamsa (five in Arabic). The Armenian meliks maintained control over the region until the 18th century. In the early 16th century, control of the region passed to the Safavid dynasty, which created the Ganja-Karabakh province (beylerbeydom, b…ôyl…ôrb…ôylik). Despite these conquests, the population of Upper Karabakh remained largely Armenian.Cornell, Svante E. The Nagorno-Karabakh Conflict . Uppsala: Department of East European Studies, April 1999. Karabakh passed to Imperial Russia by the Kurekchay Treaty, signed between the Khan of Karabakh and Tsar Alexander I of Russia in 1805, and later further formalized by the Russo-Persian Treaty of Gulistan in 1813, before the rest of Transcaucasia was incorporated into the Empire in 1828 by the Treaty of Turkmenchay. In 1822, the Karabakh khanate was dissolved, and the area became part of the Elisabethpol Governorate within the Russian Empire. After the Russian Revolution of 1917, Karabakh became part of the Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic, but this soon dissolved into separate Armenian, Azerbaijani, and Georgian states. Over the next two years (1918‚Äì1920), there were a series of short wars between Armenia and Azerbaijan over several regions, including Karabakh. In July 1918, the First Armenian Assembly of Nagorno-Karabakh declared the region self-governing and created a National Council and government.The Nagorno-Karabagh Crisis: A Blueprint for Resolution, New England Center for International Law & Policy Later, Ottoman troops entered Karabakh, meeting armed resistance by Armenians. In April 1920, while the Azerbaijani army was locked in Karabakh fighting local Armenian forces, Azerbaijan was taken over by Bolsheviks. Subsequently, the disputed areas of Karabakh, Zangezur, and Nakhchivan came under the control of Armenia. During July and August 1920, however, the Red Army occupied mountainous Karabakh, Zangezur, and part of Nakhchivan. Later on, for basically political reasons, the Soviet Union agreed to a division under which Zangezur would fall under the control of Armenia, while Karabakh and Nakhchivan would be under the control of Azerbaijan. In addition, the mountainous part of Karabakh that had come to be named Nagorno-Karabakh was granted an autonomous status as the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast, giving Armenians more rights than were given to Azerbaijanis in ArmeniaTobias Debiel, Axel Klein, Stiftung Entwicklung und Frieden. [Fragile Peace: State Failure, Violence and Development in Crisis Regions]. Zed Books, 2002; p.94 and enabling Armenians to be appointed to key positions and attend schools in their first language. With the Soviet Union firmly in control of the region, the conflict over the region died down for several decades. The Armenians in Karabakh were not repressed to a substantial extent. Their situation was undoubtedly better than of the Azerbaijanis in Armenia who lived in Zangezur in an equally concentrated manner, though without possessing any autonomy. Local schools offered education in Armenian but taught Azerbaijani history and not the history of the Armenian people; the population had access to Armenian- language television broadcast by a Stepanakert-based channel controlled from Baku, and later directly from Armenia as well, though in an unfavourable manner.T.K.Oommen.

The autonomy of Nagorno-Karabakh led to the rise of Armenian nationalism and the Armenians' determination in claiming independence. With the beginning of the dissolution of the Soviet Union in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the question of Nagorno-Karabakh re-emerged. According to Human Rights Watch, Azerbaijani OMON and Soviet military forces jointly started \\"a campaign of violence to disperse Armenian villagers from areas north and south of Nagorno-Karabakh, a territorial enclave in Azerbaijan where Armenian communities have lived for centuries\\".HRW Report on Soviet Union Human Rights Developments [in 1991]. Human Rights Watch, 1992. \\"However, the unstated goal was to \\"convince\\" the villagers half are pensioners to relocate permanently in Armenia.\\" This military action was officially called \\"Operation Ring\\", because its basic strategy consists of surrounding villages (included Martunashen and Chaykand) with tanks and armored personnel carriers and shelling them. Azerbaijani villagers were allowed to come and loot the empty Armenian villages, while more than ten thousand Armenian villagers have been forced to leave Azerbaijan. The majority Armenian population started a movement that culminated in the unilateral declaration of independence. =Armenians in Nakhchivan= The Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic of Azerbaijan. The cemetery at Julfa depicted in a photograph taken in 1915. Armenians had a historic presence in Nakhchivan (In Armenian ’Ü’°’≠’´’ª÷á’°’∂ (Nakhijevan)). According to an Armenian tradition, Nakhchivan was founded by Noah, of the Abrahamic religions. It became part of the Satrapy of Armenia under Achaemenid Persia c. 521 BC. In 189 BC, Nakhchivan was part of the new Kingdom of Armenia established by Artaxias I. In 428, the Armenian Arshakuni monarchy was abolished and Nakhchivan was annexed by Sassanid Persia. In 623 AD, possession of the region passed to the Byzantine Empire. Nakhchivan itself became part of the autonomous Principality of Armenia under Arab control. After the fall of the Arab rule in the 9th century, the area became the domain of several Muslim emirates of Arran and Azerbaijan. Nakhchivan became part of the Seljuk Empire in the 11th century, followed by becoming the capital of the Atabegs of Azerbaijan in the 12th century. In the 1220s it was plundered by Khwarezmians and Mongols. In the 15th century, the weakening Mongol rule in Nakhchivan was forced out by the Turcoman dynasties of Kara Koyunlu and Ak Koyunlu. In the 16th century, control of Nakhchivan passed to the Safavid dynasty of Persia. In 1604, Shah Abbas I Safavi, concerned that the lands of Nakhchivan and the surrounding areas would pass into Ottoman hands, decided to institute a scorched earth policy. He forced the entire local population, Armenians, Jews and Muslims alike, to leave their homes and move to the Persian provinces south of the Aras River. Many of the deportees were settled in the neighborhood of Isfahan that was named New Julfa since most of the residents were from the original Julfa (a predominantly Armenian town). After the last Russo-Persian War and the Treaty of Turkmenchay, the Nakhchivan khanate passed into Russian possession in 1828. The Nakhchivan khanate was dissolved, and its territory was merged with the territory of the Erivan khanate and the area became the Nakhchivan uyezd of the new Armenian Oblast, which was reformed into the Erivan Governorate in 1849. A resettlement policy implemented by the Russian authorities encouraged massive Armenian immigration to Nakhchivan from various parts of the Ottoman Empire and Persia. According to official statistics of the Russian Empire, by the turn of the 20th century Azerbaijanis made up 57% of the uyezd's population, while Armenians constituted 42%. During the Russian Revolution of 1905, conflict erupted between the Armenians and the Azerbaijanis, culminating in the Armenian-Tatar massacres. In the final year of World War I, Nakhchivan was the scene of more bloodshed between Armenians and Azerbaijanis, who both laid claim to the area. By 1914, the Armenian population was at 40% while the Azerbaijani population increased to roughly 60%. After the February Revolution, the region was under the authority of the Special Transcaucasian Committee of the Russian Provisional Government and subsequently of the short-lived Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic. When the TDFR was dissolved in May 1918, Nakhchivan, Nagorno-Karabakh, Zangezur (today the Armenian province of Syunik), and Qazakh were heavily contested between the newly formed and short- lived states of the Democratic Republic of Armenia (DRA) and the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic (ADR). In June 1918, the region came under Ottoman occupation. Under the terms of the Armistice of Mudros, the Ottomans agreed to pull their troops out of the Transcaucasus to make way for the forthcoming British military presence. After a brief British occupation and the fragile peace they tried to impose, in December 1918, with the support of Azerbaijan's Musavat Party, Jafargulu Khan Nakhchivanski declared the Republic of Aras in the Nakhchivan uyezd of the former Yerevan Governorate assigned to Armenia by Wardrop. The Armenian government did not recognize the new state and sent its troops into the region to take control of it. The conflict soon erupted into the violent Aras War. By mid-June 1919, however, Armenia succeeded in establishing control over Nakhchivan and the whole territory of the self- proclaimed republic. The fall of the Aras republic triggered an invasion by the regular Azerbaijani army and by the end of July, Armenian troops were forced to leave Nakhchivan City to the Azerbaijanis. In mid-March 1920, Armenian forces launched an offensive on all of the disputed territories, and by the end of the month both the Nakhchivan and Zangezur regions came under stable but temporary Armenian control. In July 1920, the 11th Soviet Red Army invaded and occupied the region and on July 28, declared the Nakhchivan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic with \\"close ties\\" to the Azerbaijan SSR. A referendum was called for the people of Nakhchivan to be consulted. According to the formal figures of this referendum, held at the beginning of 1921, 90% of Nakhchivan's population wanted to be included in the Azerbaijan SSR \\"with the rights of an autonomous republic.\\" The decision to make Nakhchivan a part of modern-day Azerbaijan was cemented March 16, 1921, in the Treaty of Moscow between Bolshevist Russia and Turkey. The agreement between the Soviet Russia and Turkey also called for attachment of the former Sharur- Daralagez uyezd (which had a solid Azerbaijani majority) to Nakhchivan, thus allowing Turkey to share a border with the Azerbaijan SSR. This deal was reaffirmed on October 23, in the Treaty of Kars. In the years following the establishment of Soviet rule, Nakhchivan saw a significant demographic shift. Its Armenian population gradually decreased as many emigrated. According to statistics published by the Imperial Russian government in 1916, Armenians made up 40% of the population of the Nakhchivan uyezd.Hovannisian. Republic of Armenia, vol. I, p. 91. The borders of the uyezd were redrawn and in the 1926 all-Soviet census 11% of region's population was Armenian,.Nakhchivan ASSR in the 1926 All-Soviet Census By 1979 this number had shrunk to 1.4%. The Azerbaijani population, meanwhile increased substantially with both a higher birth rate and immigration (growing from 85% in 1926 to 96% by 1979). The Armenian population saw a great reduction in their numbers throughout the years repatriating to Armenia and elsewhere. Some Armenian political groupings of the Republic of Armenia and the Armenian diaspora, among them most notably the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF) claim that Nakhchivan should belong to Armenia. However, Nakhchivan is not officially claimed by the government of Armenia. But huge Armenian religious and cultural remnants are witness of the historic presence of Armenians in the Nakhcivan region (Nakichevan, sometimes Nakhijevan in Armenian).

The screenplay by Dwight Taylor was the first to focus on the Alcoholics Anonymous program as a means of overcoming an addiction to liquor. Plot summary Jenny Carey is a budding actress whose developing career is threatened by an increasing dependence on alcohol spurred by her self-destructive romance with theatre director Tony Collins. Reformed drunk Alan Miller attempts to help her by introducing her to AA, but his growing interest in her strains his marriage to Edna, who suspects his motive for assisting Jenny is more than humanitarian. Principal cast * Joan Fontaine as Jenny Carey * Ray Milland as Alan Miller * Teresa Wright as Edna Miller * Richard Derr as Tony Collins * Douglas Dick as Baker Production notes Screenwriter Dwight Taylor based the character of Jenny on his mother, stage actress Laurette Taylor, whose struggle with alcoholism kept her from acting for years at a time. She was a longtime friend of director/producer George Stevens' uncle, theatre critic Ashton Stevens. Joan Fontaine, in San Francisco for the film's premiere, told reporters Jenny Carey was one of her more difficult roles \\"partly because I've never been drunk.\\" In order to achieve a convincing performance, she said, \\"I talked to members of Alcoholics Anonymous and watched my friends at cocktail parties.\\" Reception =Critical response= The New York Times reviewer Bosley Crowther commenetd: \\"Mr. Stevens' production and the direction he has given this film . . . are as sleek and professionally efficient as any you are going to see around.

History Georgios Tsolakoglou with Wehrmacht officers arrives at Macedonia Hall of Anatolia College in Thessaloniki, to sign the surrender (April 1941) After the fall of Greece, General Georgios Tsolakoglou was appointed as Prime minister of the new Greek government on April 30, 1941. As King George II had left the country with the legitimate Greek government-in-exile, the new regime avoided all reference to the Greek monarchy and used Hellenic State as the country's official, generic, name. The collaborationist regime lacked a precise political definition, although Tsolakoglou, a republican officer, considered the Axis occupation as an opportunity to abolish the monarchy, and announced its end upon taking office.Bernhard R. Kroener, Germany and the Second World War Volume V/II, Oxford University Press, 2003, p. 44 The existence of a native Greek government was considered necessary by the Axis powers, in order to give some appearance of legitimacy to their occupation, although it was never given more than an ancillary role. The country's infrastructures had been ruined by the war. Raw materials and foodstuffs were requisitioned, and the government was forced to pay the cost of the occupation, giving rise to inflation, further exacerbated by a \\"war loan\\" Greece was forced to grant to Nazi Germany. Requisitions, together with the Allied blockade of Greece, resulted during the winter of 1941-42 in the Great Famine (Greek: ŒúŒµŒ≥Œ¨ŒªŒøœÇ ŒõŒπŒºœåœÇ), which caused the deaths of an estimated 300,000 people. The Hellenic State lacked the infrastructures and latitude for action to face the great difficulties of the Occupation period; it was also devoid of any political legitimacy, and was widely considered a puppet government. Tsolakoglou demanded greater political rights for his government, and soon threatened to resign. The proclamation of a mandatory work service in Germany for Greek citizens proved widely unpopular and hastened the fall of Tsolakoglou: on 17 November 1942, he was sacked and replaced by his deputy, Konstantinos Logothetopoulos. The new government announced that 80,000 Greek citizens were to be sent to Germany. This led to widespread demonstrations and strikes, and the decision was eventually revoked. Logothetopoulos, who had protested against the measures taken by the Axis occupation authorities, was himself sacked on 6 April 1943. Against the wishes of the Italians, who favored Finance Minister Sotirios Gotzamanis, he was replaced by Ioannis Rallis, a monarchist politician. Rallis, who was looking beyond the German withdrawal from Greece to the restoration of the post-war political order, and who was alarmed by the growth of the mostly Communist-dominated Greek resistance, obtained German consent for the creation of the Security Battalions, armed formations that were used in anti-partisan offensives. The collaborationist Greek government ceased to exist after the withdrawal of German forces and the liberation of the country in October 1944. Tsolakoglou, Logothetopoulos (in Germany, where he had escaped to) and Rallis were all arrested, along with hundreds of collaborationists. The restored government set up the so-called Trials of Collaborationists (I Diki ton Dosilogon) to judge collaborators,Markos Vallianatos, The untold history of Greek collaboration with Nazi Germany (1941-1944) but it made not the major efforts it had announced to punish collaborators: this contributed to the escalation of political enmities in Greece, which in turn played a part in the outbreak of the Greek civil war.Charles R. Schrader, The withered vine: logistics and the communist insurgency in Greece, 1945-1949, Greenwood Press, 1999, p. 38 Government and politics Ioannis Rallis The regime was first led by Georgios Tsolakoglou, the general who signed the unconditional surrender of the Hellenic Army to the Germans. However, he was sacked a year later and replaced by Konstantinos Logothetopoulos, who himself was sacked in 1943. The last prime minister of the Hellenic State was Ioannis Rallis, who led the collaborationist regime until its dissolution in 1944. Georgios Bakos, a Greek Army major general, served as the minister of national defense, a position which Rallis had previously held in the regime. The Hellenic State was widely viewed as a puppet government and was unpopular with the Greek people. =Collaborationist government-in-exile= After the liberation of Greece, a new collaborationist government had been established at Vienna, during September of 1944, formed by former collaborationist ministers. It was headed by the former collaborationist minister . During 1945, Tsironikos tried by a Special Collaborators Court and sentenced to death. On 10 May 1945, he was arrested at Vienna by the Allied forces and sent to Greece, where he was imprisoned.ŒüŒπ Œ§œÉŒπœÅŒøŒΩŒØŒ∫ŒøœÇ Œ∫Œ±Œπ Œ§Œ±Œ≤ŒøœÖŒªŒ¨œÅŒ∑œÇ œÉœÖŒΩŒµŒªŒÆœÜŒ∏Œ∑œÉŒ±ŒΩ, ŒïœÜŒ∑ŒºŒµœÅŒØŒ¥Œ± ¬´ŒïŒªŒµœÖŒ∏ŒµœÅŒØŒ±¬ª, Œ†Œ±œÅŒ±œÉŒ∫ŒµœÖŒÆ 11 ŒúŒ±ŒêŒøœÖ 1945, œÉŒµŒªŒØŒ¥Œ± 2.

However, they are known for committing atrocities against the civilian population. An officer named Georgios Bakos served as the minister of national defense.

Kalil House, built in 1955 on the same street), and one of a modest number of Wright designs in the northeastern United States. The house was built for Dr. Isadore Zimmerman and his wife Lucille. The house is now owned by the Currier Museum of Art because of the Zimmermans' decision to donate the home to the public after their death. The museum provides tours of the building, which is the only legal access to the grounds. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Description and history The Zimmerman House is located in a residential setting in northern Manchester, at the southwest corner of Heather and Union streets. It is a single-story structure, set on a floating concrete slab. It is organized around a large L-shaped central chimney, and covered by a deeply overhanging roof. The rooms are arranged in a single line, except with an open carport at one end. The interior is largely finished in cypress wood. The house was designed in 1950 by Frank Lloyd Wright in his Usonian style for Dr. Isadore and Lucille Zimmerman. It has two bedrooms, is based on a four foot module, and is constructed of red glazed brick with Georgia cypress trim (less expensive than tidewater cypress). John Geiger,https://jgonwright.net/ Archival website originally created by John Geiger (deceased) then an apprentice in Wright's Taliesin Fellowship, was sent to New Hampshire to supervise the construction of the Zimmerman house. He is responsible for the completion of the project and much of its final changes for the clients. Wright redesigned the house around a rock just outside the front entrance. Wright's design extended to include the interior furniture and furnishings. This includes a musical quartet stand,http://www.steinerag.com/flw/Artifact%20Pages/PhRtS333Music.htm, as well as the mailbox. Wright also specified the plantings for the garden. The property was maintained by the Zimmermans according to Wright's plan, and was donated to the Currier Museum of Art in 1988. The museum offers tours of the property. They begin at the museum (150 Ash Street in Manchester), which provides shuttle service to the house, in order to minimize traffic in the residential neighborhood. No other access to the property is permitted. See also *National Register of Historic Places listings in Hillsborough County, New Hampshire References * Storrer, William Allin.

It connects the highways Norwegian National Road 150 and Norwegian National Road 4 (Trondheimsveien). The junction has existed since the 19th century, and has grown considerably in size since then. It was enhanced with a roundabout in 1957, and was connected with National road 150 in 1962. The increase in traffic was greater than the capacity of the junction, and thus a bridge was constructed that redirected Trondheimsveien above the roundabout. Further restructuring was done in 1992, when a local tramway line was redirected outside of the interchange, and in 1994, when Riksvei 150 was directed below the roundabout. The Norwegian Public Roads Administration plans to connect the L√∏ren Tunnel, a planned tunnel over National road 150, with the Sinsen interchange in late 2008. \\"North of the Sinsen Interchange\\" is common expression in the Norwegian district debates, where inhabitants of Oslo are accused of being ignorant of the country north of the interchange. The expression cropped up in revues during the 1960s, and is probably due to that Sinsen then was the end point for the main road leading into Oslo from the north.

In 1959, inspired citizens of Northampton County rallied for its preservation after it became known that the State Highway Department had plans to build a new concrete bridge in its place. Kreidersville Covered Bridge became one of the first covered bridges to be recognized for preservation by a committee of enthusiasts. In 1959, they formed a State organization called \\"The Theodore Burr Covered Bridge Society of Pennsylvania\\". The society was named for the arched truss patented by Theodore Burr and used in the construction of the bridge. In 1960, The Burr Covered Bridge Society, together with The Harmony Grange and local citizens, influenced the Northampton County Commissioners to accept ownership after the Pennsylvania State Highway Department restored the bridge. Kreidersville Covered Bridge crosses the Hokendauqua Creek. Its length is 116 feet. On September 30, 1961, State, County and local representatives took part in the re-dedication of the bridge, then known as Solt's Bridge. Kreidersville Covered Bridge in olden days was known in the community as \\"Hummel's - Koch's - Solt's Bridge.\\" They were names of families who lived near the bridge in years gone by. The Kreidersville Covered Bridge is a Burr truss wooden covered bridge that crosses the Hokendauqua Creek in Allen Township, Northampton County, Pennsylvania. Its length is 116 feet. The bridge is now owned by the township and is the only covered bridge remaining in Northampton County.

McLeod and starring Robert Taylor, Greer Garson and Lew Ayres. It was rushed into production by MGM studio chief Louis B. Mayer to capitalize on the attention and publicity generated by Greer Garson in her first film appearance, Goodbye Mr. Chips, released seven months earlier.\\"Greer Garson Makes Second Film\\" (The Age, October 4, 1940)  Plot  Following an establishing shot of the New York City skyline, an elevator in a busy office building opens and happy-go-lucky Sky Ames (Lew Ayres) steps out. In a joyful mood, singing to himself, he takes out a ring, puts it on third finger of his left hand and goes to the door marked \\"Eaton, Eiton, Piper & Holland Advertising Agency\\". Inside, Miss Wilson (Sara Haden), secretary to his best friend, Jeff Holland (Robert Taylor) tells him that Jeff is in a meeting. Showing her the ring, Sky explains that during the first vacation he took without Jeff, he met \\"the most wonderful girl in the world\\". In Jeff's office, Mr. McIntyre (George Barbier) the ill-tempered health-tonic tycoon is complaining to Jeff and his elderly deaf partner, Mr. Piper (Richard Carle) that after spending a million dollars per year on advertising, he has the right to anticipate better results and, \\"if you can't put over this health tonic, I'll take the account to another advertising firm that can\\". He leaves, telling Jeff that he expects to see him at the 3 o'clock board meeting, angrily adding \\"sharp\\". Spotting Sky, Jeff asks about his trip to Nassau and Sky invites him for lunch at the Colony, a luxury restaurant renowned for its elite patronage.Bence, Bill. \\"The Colony Restaurant\\" (posted May 19, 2010) Upon entering the Colony, while Sky is completing his hat check, Jeff spots a beautiful woman (Greer Garson) and when Sky asks, \\"what is it?\\", tells him, \\"just about the nicest thing I ever saw in my life, that's all\\". Sky then introduces the woman, Linda Bronson, to Jeff and asks, \\"do you like her well enough to marry her?\\" and Jeff answers, \\"Uh-huh, will you marry me?\\". Sky explains that he meant himself and Jeff says, \\"well, I'm sorry, old man, but I'm gonna marry her, too\\". Leaving Sky behind, Jeff leads Linda to a table and when she informs him that her wedding to Sky is \\"next week\\", offers to marry her \\"tomorrow\\" and tells Sky, \\"you're going to be our best man\\". When Linda says to Sky, \\"your friend here works pretty fast\\", Sky answers, \\"well, he could work a lot faster if he tried. For instance, he could elope with you and not tell me anything about it, you know, just send me back a postcard\\". Meanwhile, back at the office, Piper is worried that Jeff hasn't returned for the meeting with McIntyre. He tells Miss Wilson to call the restaurant, while, at the table, Sky explains his ideas about time and memory, \\"if you really want to forget a thing, you musn't try to forget it\\", and Jeff reacts with, \\"there he goes again, that same old theory\\". Jeff persists with Linda in front of Sky and, when a telephone is brought to the table, Jeff pretends that Miss Wilson's call is really in regards to Sky, because his office has been looking for him \\"all over town\\". When Linda tries to leave along with Sky, however, since she has a hairdresser's appointment, Jeff holds her by the arm and says that he will take care of the check and look after Linda. As he departs, Sky mentions that he will see Linda that evening at her house and says, \\"funny they should have called me at your office\\". Back at Jeff's office, Piper is apologizing on the phone to McIntyre for Jeff's absence at the meeting, while McIntyre, with his assistant Sky standing next to him, is becoming increasingly angry and asks Sky, \\"what did you do with him?\\". Sky replies, \\"well, he was all right when I left him at the Colony ‚Äî he was with my girl\\". At the Colony, Jeff and Linda are still sitting, while the other tables are now empty, the headwaiter, Marcel (Armand Kaliz) answers the phone and, as Jeff waves his arms, says, \\"he's not here\\". As evening arrives at the mansion of Linda's parents, the fashionably dressed guests are awaiting Linda who is late. The exasperated father (Reginald Owen) asks Linda's mother (Billie Burke), \\"how on earth does she expect us to know somebody we've never even met?\\" and she responds, \\"Oh, don't be silly, dear ‚Äî I never knew you before I met you, did I?\\" The doorbell rings and the butler opens the door to Sky. Mrs. Bronson greets him and says, \\"come meet your father-in-law, now, he's my husband, you know, but I call him George\\". As Sky is introduced to the guests and Mr. Bronson, the doorbell again rings and Linda arrives with Jeff, explaining that she lost all track of time. While she goes up to change, Jeff is introduced to Mrs. Bronson's sister, Mrs. Carruthers (Laura Hope Crews) and is subsequently discomfited by all the attention and the talk about horses and saddles, with Sky doing his best to put him ill at ease and expose him as someone out of his element. The next day, at the stables, everyone is wearing riding clothes for the fox hunt. Jeff, who is wearing Mr. Bronson's outfit, manages to break the top hat and then fall into the mud hole during a jump. As Linda offers her hand to pull him out, he manages to drag her into the big mud puddle. Walking from the puddle, they go into a barn and start taking off their wet clothes and then kiss, as the hunting party, with the disapproving Mr. Bronson and Sky in the lead, arrives. Mrs. Bronson exclaims, \\"tally tally ho, tally ho\\". Later, Linda and Sky are playing golf and she says that from now on Jeff will be out of her mind and she'll never see him again. Sky advises her to do the opposite ‚Äî make a date with Jeff and see him as often as she can, \\"that's the only way you can ever really put him out of your mind\\". She quickly agrees, but says that it would be only to say goodbye. With the Perisphere and other structures of the 1939 World's Fair in the background, Jeff and Linda are walking amidst the crowds at the fairgrounds. They sit on the bench of miniature transportation train and try to say goodbye, but start reminiscing about the amusing events in which they have participated and decide to elope. As they kiss, the minitrain stops in front of the Niagara Falls Building and a member of the crowd observing them shouts out, \\"hey, aren't you folks going to see Niagara Falls?\\" and Jeff replies, \\"I'll say we are\\". The next day, Linda arrives at Jeff's office, but he is too busy to remember. Disappointed, she leaves, but Jeff runs after her and, together, they rush into a cab. During the ride, they make plans for the future, but, holding the documentation for McIntyre's campaign with him, he stops the cab in front of McIntyre's building and rushes inside, promising to be right back, but McIntyre insists that he stay. Sky, who is in charge of McIntyre's research laboratory, comes in and McIntyre wants him to show Jeff around the facility and explain the chemical experiments which he is conducting. Dr. Schmidt (Sig Rumann), a German-accented scientist in the laboratory explains that they have invented a forgetfulness drug which makes the patient lose the memory of being sick or the shock of an accident or even the accident itself. By the time Jeff comes out, Linda has gotten tired of waiting and left the cab to return home in the suburb of White Plains. Jeff tells the cabdriver (unbilled Syd Saylor) to drive to White Plains, but as he catches up with Linda's cab, the chase attracts the attention of a motorcycle cop (Paul Hurst) who stops them. Jeff and Linda tell him that they are eloping so he leads them to the home of Judge Milliken (Henry Travers) who knows Linda's family and performs the ceremony. Outside, the motorcycle cop tears up the ticket and says, \\"suckers\\". As Jeff and Linda unpack in their half-renovated house, their butler (Halliwell Hobbes) informs them that Sky, whom Linda called, is downstairs. Sky is disheartened and offers low-key congratulations, but Linda tries to cheer him up, saying that the three of them are friends for life. She asks Jeff and Sky how long they have known each other and when they say twenty-one years, she tells Jeff, \\"let's adopt Sky\\". They both kiss her and she says, \\"just one happy triangle\\". Planning his honeymoon boat trip, Jeff is once again delayed by McIntyre, while at Linda's family home, her parents are planning a surprise party. Waiting for Jeff, Sky and Linda have been killing time playing backgammon. Eventually, Jeff arrives and rushes with Linda and Sky to White Plains where the guests, including Judge Milliken, have been drinking and waiting so they can jump out and shout \\"surprise\\". Coming into the room where the guests are hiding, Jeff tells Linda that he hates to come here and that he can't have a good time because \\"I have to look at that sour puss of your old man's all evening\\", adding that \\"I think he's a stuffed shirt and an old crab and a bore\\" and expanding about \\"that crowd of gibbering idiots he always has around him, like your half-wit aunt Letty, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap\\". Going further, he mentions \\"that potato-faced judge who married us, you know, Milliken\\". Just then, Mrs. Bronson rings the bell for all the hidden guests to come out and their faces are dismayed and angry, especially that of Mr. Bronson. During the dinner, Mr. Bronson interrupts himself on any topic that Jeff criticized, especially horses, while Jeff gets a call from Piper that he needs to see McIntyre before the honeymoon trip or the account will be lost. Asking Sky to cover for him and take Linda to the pier, Jeff rushes off. As Sky, Linda and Linda's family watch from the pier, the ship departs and Jeff still has not arrived. Linda tells Sky that she's through waiting and, as Jeff finally gets to the pier, she walks away without a word. In judge's chambers, Linda and Jeff have \\"interlocutory decree granted ‚Äî final decree to become effective at the end of three months\\". In the laboratory, Sky hears Dr. Schmidt pronounce that the forgetfulness drug is ready for testing, and returns to his office to find Jeff sleeping on his couch. Jeff says that he can't get Linda out of his mind and is unable to concentrate on anything else. At that point, Dr. Schmidt comes in and gives the vial of the forgetfulness drug to Sky who has an idea. He invites Jeff as his guest to a boxing match and as they arrive at Jeff's house, they run into Linda who explains that \\"I got my 'junk'\\". She tells Sky that couldn't see boxing because she \\"couldn't seem to rest last night\\". Sky offers \\"a little pick-up\\" for everybody and puts the drug into Jeff's and Linda's drink. The next morning, Piper has an anxiety attack when Jeff turns the office upside down, because he's completely forgotten everything that has happened in the last six months, including all the ad campaigns and work orders that he himself had ordered. He now feels happy and energetic and also surprised that Sky returned from Nassau so soon. Sky takes him to lunch at the Colony where he spots Linda sitting exactly as she was when he first saw her. They go through the same motions and say the same things with Linda remembering that she and Sky were on the boat from Nassau the day before. Sky leaves to go back to his office and Linda takes Jeff home to introduce him to her mother who is astonished to see them back together and happy. Mr. Burton, however, walks in and says, \\"young man, how dare you set foot in this house?\\". Jeff leaves hastily, but he and Linda decide to have a date for that evening. As Jeff is dressing for dinner and awaiting Linda, Sky arrives and tries to talk to him, but just then, Linda arrives. She compliments Jeff on his home and tells him that it is exactly the type of decor that she would have arranged herself. As Jeff shows her around the house, the butler gives her a pair of silk pajamas and tells her, \\"I'm sorry madam, I'm afraid you'll have to wear these for tonight\\". Offended, she tells Jeff that she'll be leaving. The butler returns with slippers, calling her \\"Mrs. Holland\\". She no longer feels offended and Jeff asks her if she believes in love at first sight and she says, \\"at lunch today\\". Jeff tells her, \\"let's get married\\" and they kiss. He says, \\"tonight\\" and suggests they sneak out the back to avoid Sky. As they speed along, they are pulled over by the same motorcycle cop who stopped them on their first wedding day. Saying \\"sixty-five miles an hour\\", he looks at them, recognizing them as the same couple and again escorts them to Judge Milliken's house. The surprised judge tells them, \\"You don't have to get married ‚Äî the ceremony isn't necessary ‚Äî why, I mean, all you have to do is to start living together\\". Linda responds, \\"well, I thought I was fairly modern\\" and Jeff adds, \\"it's the last thing I expect to hear from a man in your position\\", with the cop interjecting, \\"either they get married or go to jail\\", so the judge invites them in, with the cop adding, \\"and I'll be the witness\\". Later that evening, as Sky is asleep on the couch, Jeff carries Linda over the threshold of their new/former home. They explain to Sky that they are sorry, but they got married, with Linda adding, \\"it just seemed to happen ‚Äî I guess it had to happen\\". Just then the doorbell rings and Mr. McIntyre brusquely walks in, congratulating Jeff on his new promotional campaign which is \\"the greatest stroke of advertising genius I've ever come across\\". He tells Jeff that a new contract will be waiting upon his return from the honeymoon. Sky offers a toast and Jeff and Linda invite him along on their honeymoon, \\"we'd have a lot of fun, the three of us\\". Sky declines, \\"two's a honeymoon\\". He correctly guesses that they plan to honeymoon in Niagara Falls and adds, \\"once I hoped to go there on a honeymoon myself\\". Linda then announces that she's going to have a baby. Jeff and Sky react with consternated expressions and then Sky takes the vial of forgetfulness fluid from his pocket, pours it all into his own glass, drinks it and stares directly into the camera for the fadeout.

Assigning it 1 star (out of 5), The Motion Picture Guide states that \\"Garson's U.S. debut was not an auspicious one\\", describing the film as a \\"weak attempt at a romantic comedy\\". Further indicating that \\"no star can triumph over a clunky script and that the play is the thing\\", the review concludes, \\"it's a bore to watch, despite a few amusing moments and some crackling dialogue.

He served as archbishop of Bologna from 1921 until his death, and was elevated to the cardinalate in 1923. Biography Nasalli Rocca di Corneliano was born in Piacenza to a family of nobility; his nephew was Mario Nasalli Rocca di Corneliano, who became a cardinal as well in 1969. He received the Sacrament of Confirmation in 1880, and his first Communion in 1881, while he was a student at Collegio Vida in Cremona. After being given the clerical tonsure in 1888 by Bishop Giovanni Scalabrini, Nasalli Rocca di Corneliano entered the seminary in Piacenza, where he studied philosophy, theology, canon law, scuola tomista, and moral theology. He continued his education at the Collegio dei Ss. Ambrogio e Carlo at Rome in October 1891, and the Collegio Lombardo, where he studied with Carlo Perosi and Luigi Sincero. Nasalli Rocca was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Scalabrini on 8 June 1895, and then did pastoral work in Piacenza until 1896. He then went to Rome to attend the Pontifical Gregorian University, from where he obtained his doctorate in theology in 1895, and Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy, earning a doctorate in canon law in 1898. The young priest collaborated with Bishop Giacomo Radini-Tedeschi in organising Catholic Action in Rome and the rest of Italy, and, in 1899, he entered the service of the Roman Curia, upon his nomination as an apprendista in the Sacred Congregation of Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs with its secretary, Felice Cavagnis. He became canon coadjutor of the Liberian Basilica in 1899, rising to become full canon in 1902. Nasalli Rocca was raised to the rank of Domestic Prelate of His Holiness on 5 May 1902, and protonotary apostolic on the following 31 May. From 1904 to 1906, he served as Apostolic Visitor for the Sacred Visit of Rome, the dioceses of Ancona, Penne ed Atri, Recanati e Loreto, Teramo e Fermo, Bojano e Campobasso, and for many Italian seminaries. On 25 January 1907, Nasalli Rocca was appointed Bishop of Gubbio by Pope Pius X. He received his episcopal consecration on the following 10 February from Cardinal Vincenzo Vannutelli, with Archbishop Paolo Barone and Bishop Raffaele Virili serving as co-consecrators, in the Liberian Basilica. He was later named Titular Archbishop of Thebae and Privy Almoner of His Holiness on 6 December 1916, and an Assistant at the Pontifical Throne on 9 December of that same year. After becoming an ecclesiastical assistant to the Italian Catholic Youth in June 1921, Nasalli Rocca was appointed Archbishop of Bologna on 21 November 1921. Pope Pius XI created him Cardinal-Priest of S. Maria in Traspontina in the consistory of 23 May 1923. He served as papal legate to several religious ceremonies and events between 1923 and 1946, and was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 1939 papal conclave, which selected Pope Pius XII. Cardinal Nasalli Rocca died in Bologna, at the age of 79. He is buried in the basilica of Madonna di S. Luca.

Its seat is the village of Konopnica, which lies approximately west of the regional capital Lublin. The gmina covers an area of , and as of 2019 its total population is 13,963 (12,790 in 2013). Konopnica is a suburban borough of Lublin, some 10 km to the south west of the town. When driving from the town you can see the changes on the landscape from an urban agglomeration, through estates of singlefamily houses and, finally, to the typically Polish countryside of golden fields and green meadows. The borough of Konopnica is made up of 20 villages and hamlets in which, within an area of 92.75 km2, live over 10,000 people. Half of the inhabitants live off farming almost three-guarters of the land in the borough is agricultural. Mainly cereals and sugar beet are grown. Fruit growing is rapidly. The location provides good conditions for development of trade and services. A good road network ensures good communications with Lublin. The Lublin-Warsaw railway line, which runs through the borough, increases the transportation possibilities. The railway runs along the border between two distinct geographical areas. The area to the north of railway line on the Na≈Çƒôczowski Plateau which is characterised by a richly sculpted terrain. In this part of the borough can be found the highest point in the Lublin, at a height of 252 m above sea level, and a network of picturesque loess ravines. Stretching away on the other side of the railway line is the Be≈Ç≈ºycka Plain. The flat quiet scenery of large fields and meadows reveals the most distant corners of the borough. There are two large forests in the borough at Radawiec Du≈ºy and Tereszyn, as well as some smaller woods with a total area of over 5 km¬≤. History Belfry from the mid-17th century in Konopnica Slav settlements existed in this area in the early Middle Ages. Archaeological digs carried out in the 1980s confirm this. During the first half of the 14th century Motycz was one of the more important places in the Lublin area, lying on the main trading route to Russia, while during the second half of the 14th century, that role was being fulfilled by Konopnica. The first reports about the place are from 1342 - Konopnica was at that time a royal village and its today is reflected in the borough's coat of arms. In 1400 the chronicles of Jan D≈Çugosz mention the church at \\"Conopnicza\\" it was a wooden temple dedicated to St. Katarzyna.

Father Healey is a communications specialist, MA, with experience in the United States and Eastern Africa. Early life Healey was born in Detroit, Michigan on April 29, 1938. His grandfather was horse trainer T.J. Healey and his mother was a homemaker. He attended Maryknoll Seminary, graduating with a B.A. in 1961. In 1966 he graduated with a masters of theology from the University of Missouri. In 1981 he received a further graduate degree from Creighton University. Healey is the brother of Thomas J. Healey. Missionary work In 1968, Healey became a Maryknoll missionary priest, relocating to East Africa and becoming the leader of the social communications office of the Association of Member Episcopal Conferences in Eastern Africa. While in Africa, Healey recorded the traditional proverbs of cultures including Sukumu of Tanzania‚Äîtrying to demonstrate how the use of these proverbs could be used for evangelizing methods. His written collections also include his experiences from his missionary expeditions, and highlights the spiritual tradition of the areas he has taken up residence in. In describing his work Mary Ann Brussat wrote that, ‚ÄúThe reader will find material on creation, life, family, community, good times and bad times, joy and celebration, cultural matters, and seeds of God in African soil.‚Äù He remained in East Africa for the duration of his career, developing and writing about small Christian communities within areas dominated by alternate religions. He has also worked with members of other faiths as an author and evangelist. In his analysis of African faith stories, Healey has called them a ‚Äúfifth gospel‚Äù, a controversial phrase that describes the use of faith stories for expressing Christian ideas to those of a non-Christian background. Much of his written work has tried to establish a model of evangelizing in Africa that can be followed by other missionaries. Communities where Healey has worked include Nairobi, Kenya, as well as Rulenge, Musoma, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. In Tanzania he has also served as the Mission Awareness Committee of the Catholic Men Religious Superiors' Association. Additional nations he has worked in include Uganda and Zambia. Other work In 1968 he founded the Social Communications Office of the Association of the Catholic Bishops Conferences in Eastern Africa, and in 1969 he was the press secretary for the Pope‚Äôs visit to Uganda. Between 1979 and 1982, Healey then served as the Spiritual Director of the Maryknoll School of Theology. Recognition In 1969 Healey received the Pro Ecclesia Papal Medal of the Vatican.

Biography Jahn was born in Magdeburg, Germany, to a family of publishers. He was schooled in Berlin and joined the Wandervogel (German reform youth movement), while in Highschool (Gymnasium) in Berlin-Charlottenburg. In 1912 he participated in the 1912 Stockholm Olympics in the 800m event. He was eliminated in the first round of the 800 metres competition, while his friend Hanns Braun moved up to take the bronze medal. Jahn became a leader in the German Youth Reform Movement (Wandervogel). As such he co-led the IWV (Jungwandervogel) for many years with Willie Jansen, participating at the famous 1913 Hohen Meissner meeting. As the Wandervogel movement was concerned with health and life reform for German youth, track and field became a central element of life in the organization, which led to Jahn's ultimate appearance at the 1912 Olympics. A statue of Jahn as a Greek Olympic athlete (Der Sieger) was created by Prof. Peterich and is currently on display in the German Museum of Athletics (Deutsches Sportmuseum) in Berlin, close to the Olympiastadion. Besides track and field, Jahn was very engaged in kayaking trips (Wanderpaddeln), another facet of the outdoors activities of the Wandervogel. A crucial element of the Wandervogel movement that shaped Jahn's life was the rediscovery of German folk songs. Jahn was an accomplished guitar and lute player, as well as a composer of songs in the German folkloristic style. His best-known song \\"Laue Luft kommt blau geflossen\\" was to set music to the words by German poet Eichendorff. Other songs include \\"Wir wollen zu Land ausfahren\\" und \\"Aus feuchtem Grunde\\". A number of books that compile his compositions have been published. Plans to run the family publishing business in Berlin were thwarted by World War II, which destroyed the art publishing business and the community newspaper. Wilhelm Jahn was the editor in chief of the genealogical journal Familie, Sippe, Volk in Berlin. He later served in Denmark as an Officer (Major) of the German Armed Forces and contracted tuberculosis in a British POW camp after the war. The family, which had been scattered due to the allied terror bombing of Berlin, reunited in a displaced people's camp in Ovelg√∂nne in the late 1940s. His wife, Maria Jahn (nicknamed \\"Tuck\\") suffered serious health problems from the displacement experience and the unsanitary conditions, which led to her early demise shortly after World War II. Jahn himself never fully recovered from tuberculosis and ultimately succumbed to it in 1973, in his new residence in Hannover-Kleefeld. He is buried in the public cemetery in Ilten, Lower-Saxony, Germany (close to Hannover).

Her childless marriage to Grand Duke of Lithuania and later King of Poland Alexander Jagiellon was a constant source of tension between the Grand Duchy of Moscow and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Instead of guaranteeing peace, Helena's marriage gave her father Ivan III an excuse to interfere in Lithuanian affairs accusing Alexander of mistreating Helena and repressing Orthodox believers. This became the pretext to renew the Muscovite‚ÄìLithuanian Wars in 1500. The war ended with a six-year truce in 1503; the Grand Duchy of Lithuania lost about a third of its territory. Despite political tensions and religious differences, the marriage was a loving one and the royal couple was close. After her husband's death in 1506, Helena wanted to return to Moscow but was not allowed. When she planned to run away, she was arrested and reportedly poisoned. Biography =Early life and marriage plans= Birth of Helena from the Illustrated Chronicle of Ivan the Terrible Helena, possibly named after her great-grandmother Empress Helena Draga≈°,Duczmal (2012), p. 125 was the eldest surviving child of Ivan III, Grand Prince of Moscow, and his second wife Sophia Palaiologina, niece of the last Byzantine Emperor Constantine XI Palaiologos. Helena was an older sister of Grand Prince of Moscow Vasili III of Russia. Little is known about Helena's childhood in Moscow, but it is known that she was literateDuczmal (2012), p. 126 and very attractive. When Helena was eight, Jan Zabrzezi≈Ñski and Ivan Yuryevich Patrikeyev discussed a marriage between Helena and one of the sons of the Polish King Casimir IV Jagiellon.Duczmal (2012), pp. 126‚Äì127 At the time Poland was looking for allies in the Polish‚ÄìOttoman War (1484‚Äì1504), which broke out after the Ottomans captured Kiliya and Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi, two major ports on the Black Sea.Duczmal (2012), p. 127 In 1489, Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor, was looking for a Russian alliance in the Austrian‚ÄìHungarian War and against Polish claims to the Kingdom of Hungary, which were based on inheritance of Polish queen Elizabeth of Austria. The Emperor proposed to have Helena and her younger sister Theodosia marry into his family, but Ivan III refused and instead suggested the Emperor's widowed son Maximilian I. The Emperor entertained the proposal, but did not take it too seriously. At the same time Sophia's brother Andreas Palaiologos in consultation with Filippo Buonaccorsi advised her to seek an alliance with Poland.Duczmal (2012), p. 128 Nevertheless, an alliance between the Emperor and Moscow without a marriage agreement was concluded in August 1490. The alliance lost its relevance after the Peace of Pressburg (1491) and further proposals to marry Helena off to Maximilian or his son Philip did not gain much support. In August 1492, shortly after the death of Polish King Casimir IV Jagiellon, Ivan III of Russia attacked the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, launching what would become a series of Muscovite‚ÄìLithuanian Wars. John I Albert became King of Poland while Alexander Jagiellon became Grand Duke of Lithuania. The Muscovite army was successful and a peace with Moscow, guaranteed by a marriage between Alexander and Helena, became a priority for Lithuania. An \\"eternal\\" peace treaty was concluded on February 5, 1494. The agreement marked the first Lithuanian territorial losses to Moscow: the Principality of Vyazma and a sizable region in the upper reaches of the Oka RiverKiaupa (2000), p. 221 ‚Äì the lost area was estimated to be approximately . A day after the official confirmation of the treaty, Alexander Jagiellon was betrothed to Helena (the role of the groom was performed by Stanislovas Kƒôsgaila).Petrauskas (2009), p. 463 =Uncrowned Grand Duchess of Lithuania= Alexander Jagiellon meets Helena in Vilnius (painting by Nikolai Dmitriev- Orenburgsky) Helena's Orthodox faith created a number of complications. Alexander had to receive a special permission from Pope Alexander VI to marry a non-Catholic and sign a formal agreement with Ivan III in October 1494 that Helena would not be forced to convert. Alexander wanted to add that if she wished so herself, Helena could convert, but Ivan III adamantly rejected the amendment.Duczmal (2012), p. 129 Ivan III left Helena with detailed instructions on how to behave, whom to invite for lunch, where to pray (she was prohibited from visiting Catholic churches).Duczmal (2012), p. 130 Ivan III also requested that Alexander would build an Orthodox church in Vilnius Castle Complex. In January 1495, Helena, accompanied by eighty nobles and servants, departed Moscow towards Vilnius. She reached Vilnius on February 15, 1495, and the same day the couple was married. The marriage ceremony was a complex combination of Catholic and Orthodox traditions. Helena prayed and prepared in the Cathedral of the Theotokos before moving to Vilnius Cathedral. She was dressed in a traditional Russian wedding dress. The wedding ceremony was officiated by Catholic Wojciech Tabor, Bishop of Vilnius, and Orthodox Foma, priest who accompanied Helena from Moscow.Banionis (1998), p. 279 Reportedly Helena did not bring much dowry (jewelry, three icons, silver and gilded dishes, expensive fabrics, furs, a carriage with horses) and Alexander did not gift her with lands after the wedding (he did so only in August 1501).Duczmal (2012), pp. 130‚Äì131 In Vilnius, Helena faced a delicate political situation. For example, it seems that Queen Elisabeth of Habsburg was purposefully late to her son's wedding and kept pressuring her schismatic daughter-in-law to convert. Helena refused and Elisabeth left insulted and angry not only with Helena but with Alexander as well.Duczmal (2012), pp. 131‚Äì132 On one hand, Helena wanted to avoid a conflict with Catholic nobility and clergy, on the other she had to obey her father. Ivan III sent her secret letters with political instructions,Duczmal (2012), p. 133 but she did not get involved in her father's political intrigues and was loyal and obedient to her husband.Duczmal (2012), p. 131 She made donations to Orthodox Holy Spirit Church and Monastery in Vilnius, a church in Minsk, and Supra≈õl Lavra, but did not make any grand gestures in support of Orthodoxy.Duczmal (2012), p. 132 She did not protest when in May 1495 her Russian servants were sent back to Moscow on suspicion that they might be Russian agents and spies. Even in daily life the couple faced struggles. For example, when they traveled, Alexander would enter a city alone as it was customary to go to a church after the official reception; Helena would enter the city few hours later.Duczmal (2012), p. 137 Despite political and religious tensions, the marriage was a loving one and the royal couple remained close. It seems that Helena was pregnant twice (in 1497 and 1499), but both pregnancies ended in miscarriages.Duczmal (2012), p. 134 Some historians see Helena's influence in Alexander's 1497 donation to the St. Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery in Kiev, 1499 economic and judiciary privilege to Orthodox clergy, and 1504 religious freedom guarantee to Orthodox peasants, however that is doubtful as Helena was passive in politics and tried to avoid conflicts.Duczmal (2012), pp. 132‚Äì133 Around 1498, Joseph Bolharynovich, Metropolitan of Kiev, and Wojciech Tabor, Bishop of Vilnius, attempted to persuade Helena to support a church union as it was envisioned at the Council of Florence ‚Äì the Orthodoxs would retain their traditions, but would accept the pope as their spiritual sovereign. Helena refused, but Ivan III used it as one of casus belli when he renewed the war with Lithuania in May 1500. At the time Poland, Lithuania's ally, was engaged in the Polish‚ÄìOttoman War (1484‚Äì1504) and could not offer assistance. The Muscovite army scored victories in the Battles of Vedrosha and Mstislavl and captured several Lithuanian fortresses.Stevens (2007), p. 58 =Uncrowned Queen of Poland= Wedding of Alexander and Helena from the Illustrated Chronicle of Ivan the Terrible Helena's situation became further complicated when John I Albert died in June 1501 and Alexander was elected as the new King of Poland in October 1501. The Polish nobility did not want an Orthodox queen and pressured her to convert. Polish nobles, including Bishop Erazm Cio≈Çek and Cardinal Fryderyk Jagiello≈Ñczyk, discussed the issue of royal divorce.Nowakowska (2007), pp. 134‚Äì135 From Pope Alexander VI they obtained Alexander's absolution from his marital oath and duties to Helena as well as from the promise to Ivan III not to force Helena to convert. The pope went further and ordered Alexander to put effort in convincing Helena to convert.Duczmal (2012), p. 135 Despite their efforts, Helena did not convert and the royal couple remained close. When Krak√≥w priests insulted Helena when she had an Orthodox service in one of the chapels of the Wawel Cathedral, Alexander wrote to his brother Fryderyk Jagiello≈Ñczyk asking to discipline the priests. Alexander even gifted land near Minsk and Mogilev to Helena to assure her financial independence.Duczmal (2012), pp. 134‚Äì135 Alexander was crowned as King of Poland in December 1501; as an adherent to the Eastern Orthodox beliefs, Helena was ineligible to become Queen of Poland and was never crowned.Stone (2001), p. 33 Officially she was only \\"wife of Grand Duke of Lithuania\\" but she referred to herself as queen. Alexander obtained a rescission of Pope Alexander's orders to convert her to Catholicism from Pope Julius II in August 1505.Duczmal (2012), p. 136 Peace negotiations between Lithuania and Moscow began in mid-1502. Helena was not directly involved in the negotiations. In March 1503, Lithuanian envoys brought her letters to various family members to Moscow. Her passionate plea to Ivan III to end the war and bring peace is often cited as proof of her intelligence and devotion to her Lithuanian subjects, but the letter could be a product of Lithuanian diplomats. Ivan III replied scolding his daughter. Nevertheless, a six-year truce was concluded; the Grand Duchy of Lithuania lost about or a third of its territory.Norkus (2009), pp. 60‚Äì62 In June 1505, Alexander suffered a stroke which paralyzed his left side. During summer his health improved enough to allow him to ride a horse. In October 1505, Helena's father Ivan III died leaving her brother Vasili III on the Russian throne. The tension between Lithuania and Moscow lessened as the new Grand Prince wanted to consolidate his power without starting another war. In spring 1506, Alexander's health deteriorated after an exhausting journey from Lublin to Vilnius and an inappropriate medical treatments.Duczmal (2012), p. 138 Despite his worsening condition, Alexander called Seimas in Lida so that he could transfer the Grand Duchy of Lithuania to his brother Sigismund I the Old. In Lida, Alexander wrote his last will asking Sigismund to take good care of Helena. The Seimas was interrupted by the news of an invasion by the Crimean Khanate. The King was hastily evacuated to Vilnius, further weakening his health, while Michael Glinski organized defense and won the Battle of Kletsk. =Widow= Alexander died on August 19, 1506. Helena was thirty and without children. She wanted to return to Moscow, but marshal Wojciech K≈Çoczko and other nobles forced her to stay in Vilnius. Helena's brother Vasili III attempted to use her influence in an unsuccessful bid to become King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, but Helena refused to interfere. The relationship between Helena and her brother- in-law Sigismund I the Old seems to have been cold but polite. She continued to live in Vilnius Castle Complex and was granted further lands in Bra≈Ñsk and Sura≈º in January 1507. The Muscovite‚ÄìLithuanian War resumed in April 1507. Helena and her treatment once again was at the center of political intrigues. Vasili III, just like his father, claimed that Helena was being forced to convert and even claimed that Sigismund attempted to poison Helena. Rumors circulated that Helena aided rebellious Michael Glinski who defected to Moscow, but the charge lacks proof. However, the war ended in October 1508. In 1511, Helena expressed her wishes to return to Moscow, but Sigismund would not allow it.Duczmal (2012), p. 139 The relationship between Lithuania and Moscow remained tense. Sigismund and his advisers were afraid that Helena could provide valuable intelligence to Vasili III. Also, Helena led a rather frugal lifestyle and amassed substantial wealth. Sigismund wanted that money to remain in Lithuania rather than be taken to Moscow where it could be used to finance the Muscovite army. He also did not want additional complications of Helena transferring her Lithuanian landholdings to a Russian prince. Helena decided to return to Moscow in secret. She left her money ‚Äì fourteen large boxes of gold, silver and jewels ‚Äì to a Franciscan monastery in Vilnius. The plan was for her to meet Vasili's men in Braslaw, which belonged to her and was located on the Lithuania‚ÄìRussia border. The plan was divulged by a servant and the Franciscans refused to ship the boxes. Helena was arrested and held in Trakai and later Bir≈°tonas. Such treatment of the widow angered her brother Vasili III. Sigismund replied that Helena was not arrested, but simply warned that living near the unstable border was unsafe. The situation became a pretext for another war between Lithuania and Moscow. In 1513, Helena reached Braslaw and died there suddenly. According to a rumor, she was poisoned by Miko≈Çaj Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç.Duczmal (2012), p. 140 It is unknown what happened to Helena's money she left with the Franciscans as there is no record that Sigismund, who was relieved to hear about her death, inherited it. Historians proposed a theory that Helena was murdered by Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç to steal the money, but it cannot be proven. Vasili III demanded Helena's assets, both money and land, from Sigismund and investigated her death.

Built from 1978 to 1980, it spans a distance of over the delta, making it, along with the Jubilee Parkway across Mobile Bay to its south, among the longest bridges in the nation. It was named in honor of Walter K. Wilson, a Chief of Engineers with the United States Army Corps of Engineers and long-term resident of Mobile. He was credited with being one of the first people recognizing the need to construct a high-level bridge on Interstate 65 over the Mobile River that would not impede waterway development. The state of Alabama named the bridge in his honor after completion of construction in 1978. Dolly Parton Bridge The bridge has red warning lights atop the parallel support arches which, when combined with the shape of the supporting arches when approached from certain directions, have caused the bridge to gain the nickname \\"Dolly Parton Bridge\\". Two long, low viaducts connect the eastern side of the delta to the main span May 22, 2014 fire On May 22, 2014 the bridge suffered damage in the northbound portion due to extreme heat caused following an accident involving two semi-trailer trucks. The accident occurred approximately from the arch portion of the bridge. One truck carrying petroleum barrels, stopped due to a previous accident, was rear ended by another truck, with an explosion ensuing. The driver of the tractor which impacted the trailer was killed. The subsequent fire and extreme heat generated caused significant damage to the concrete deck. The bridge was temporarily closed for two days and then reopened to one lane of northbound traffic. The Alabama Department of Transportation estimated it would take several months to replace the top 8 inches of the concrete deck over an unspecified area of the damaged bridge. The two northbound lanes were completely closed during construction, with the two southbound lanes divided into one southbound and one northbound lane.

Development The IA 38 was an experimental cargo aircraft based on research by Reimar Horten. It was an all-metal tailless shoulder-wing swept monoplane, with the vertical control surfaces instead located near the tips of the wings. The short, stubby fuselage was fitted with retractable tricycle landing gear. Power was provided by four I.Ae. 16 El Gaucho radial engines mounted within the wings, driving pusher propellers mounted clear of the wing trailing edges. The two-man cockpit was faired into the leading edge of the wing. A cargo compartment within and below the wing was capable of carrying 6100 kg (13,448 lb) of freight using a rear access door. The prototype was completed in 1959, however problems with engine cooling delayed the first flight to 9 December 1960. Horten was forced to use the IA 16 engines which were below the power rating of the intended powerplants. As a result, the craft was severely underpowered and showed a poor performance. After the project was cancelled, the IA 38 was placed in the grounds of the Aeronautical School, where it was used as a static display until a fire (suspected to have been an act of arson) destroyed the aircraft's skin. The remains of the plane were scrapped afterwards.

The documentary shows Attenborough searching for the identities of preserved creatures inside a piece of Baltic amber that was given to him by his adoptive sister when he was twelve years old. It then shows how a group of scientists can reconstruct an entire twenty million-year-old ecosystem through pieces of Dominican amber. Examples include a tadpole preserved in amber after falling from a bromeliad. Attenborough then discusses the scientific feasibility of DNA being preserved in amber, and the science behind the 1993 hit techno-thriller Jurassic Park, in which his elder brother Richard Attenborough starred as John Hammond. Several attempts were tried, with DNA eventually being recovered from a weevil that was several million years older than Tyrannosaurus rex. Attenborough reasons that a few old, rare pieces of amber may contain DNA.

Biography Murray was born on September 23, 1898, in Charlotte, North Carolina. He attended to North Carolina State College, where he played college baseball for the Wolfpack. In , when he was 23, he broke into the Major Leagues on May 8 with the New York Yankees. He was mainly a relief pitcher, although started two games (out of 22 pitched in all). He was 4-2 with a 3.97 ERA. The next two years Murray spent with the Boston Red Sox On January 30, 1923, Murray was traded to the Red Sox with Camp Skinner and Norm McMillan for star pitcher Herb Pennock and $50,000. In , nearly half of the games he pitched in he started; however, he did worse than he did the year before, going 7-11 with a 4.91 earned run average. His seven wins that season were a career high, though. In 1924, Murray went back to mainly relief pitching, and did even worse than he did the previous two years. He finished with a record of 2-9 and an earned run average of 6.72; he had one of the worst seasons out of all of the pitchers on the team. That was the final year he played with the Red Sox. He did not play at all in , and went with the Washington Senators in 1926. He was converted to a starting pitcher, didn't pitch as much, but still had the second best season of his career (behind his rookie season). He finished at 6-3 with a mediocre 5.63 ERA. In twelve games pitched he only gave up one home run, very good for a pitcher. Murray pitched 1927 with the Senators as well. His amount of pitching time continued to decline, and it turned out that 1926 was his final season as a starting pitcher; 1927 was spent as a little-used relief man. Murray did not pitch at all for the next five years. He made a comeback with the Chicago White Sox in 1933, but only pitched two games. His final game was played May 1 of that year, and at age 34, that marked the end of his Major League career. Murray died on October 18, 1955, in Memphis, Tennessee. He was buried in Brownsville, Tennessee.

Synopsis  The documentary follows Attenborough as he joins Ambunti Patrol No 19/1970-71 (3 May to 10 June 1971), led by ADC Laurie Bragge, crossing through a previously unexplored region in search of an uncontacted people known as the Bikaru. However, a setback is encountered when a translator from Bisorio could not be found. After several weeks in the interior, with no sighting of any Bikaru people, the expedition eventually encounters signs of human habitation and, toward the conclusion of their journey, they are approached by a small tribe of Biami natives who allegedly had never before had contact with the outside world. The curious and friendly tribe engages in some minor trading with the expedition. They become alarmed, however, when Attenborough and company attempt to follow them to their homes. The tribe suddenly disappears into the forest and are not seen again. After this point the BBC crew were flown out and the rest of the patrol returned to Ambunti.

The three specifically targeted both civilian and government buildings which included boulevard cafes, the homes of magistrates, police stations and the Chamber of Deputies.Porter, Bernard. The Origins of the Vigilant State: The London Metropolitan Police. Woodbridge, UK: Boydell & Brewer, 1991. (p. 101) Biography A cabinet maker by trade, Meunier had joined the French anarchist movement during the early 1890s. According to Charles Malato, it was said of Meunier that he was \\"...the most remarkable type of revolutionary illuminist, an ascetic and a visionary, as passionate for the search for the ideal society as Saint-Just, and as merciless as seeking his way towards it.\\" During the trial of the notorious anarchist known as Ravachol, Meunier set off a bomb at the Lobau Barracks, the site of the Communard massacres, on 15 March 1892. On 25 April, the day before Ravachol was to be sentenced, the Cafe Very in which Ravachol was arrested was also bombed killing the owner and a customer as well as injuring numerous others.Pyle, Christopher H.

He would remain there for 14 years until his death in 1907, following a failed escape attempt.

In the mid-1840s he purchased the land claim, along with Asa Lovejoy, for the site which would become Portland, Oregon. Overton sold his share shortly thereafter to Francis Pettygrove. According to historian Harvey W. Scott, who published a comprehensive history of Portland in 1890, little was known about Overton. It was generally agreed that he originated from Tennessee and settled in Oregon City, possibly arriving with Joseph Gale by way of California, though he spent his first months in Oregon, from November 1, 1841 to the early part of 1842, working at the Methodist mission at The Dalles. Overton was described by James W. Nesmith as a \\"desperate, rollicking fellow.\\" He and Lovejoy visited a site along the Willamette River between present-day Jefferson and Washington streets while traveling from Fort Vancouver to Oregon City by canoe in 1843 or 1844. The site had been previously cleared of trees, perhaps by natives, and had become a popular stopping point for those traveling the Willamette. It was generally agreed that a large city would be established somewhere in the vicinity of the confluence of the Willamette and Columbia rivers. Overton wanted to make a claim on the land, but prevailed upon Lovejoy to record the claim of , and the two men set about clearing more trees and building habitable dwellings. Overton's cabin was open in the front‚Äîeffectively a shed. The original Portland plat was 16 blocks, laid out in 1845. Overton \\"drove staves and shingles\\" on the site, and sold them at Oregon City. He offered to sell his share to Jimmie Stephens, a cooper, for 300 barrels, but Stephens declined. Lovejoy and Pettygrove were considering platting a city on the site. Overton sold his share of the land claim to Pettygrove for $50, though he had to pay Lovejoy $60 for improvements the two made on Overton's land. He then departed for Texas, upon hearing that his mother was ill and living there. It was rumored that he was hanged in Texas. Overton Street in Northwest Portland is named after him.

Inductees are from both accounting academia and practice. Since its inception in 1950 at The Ohio State University, it has honored 106 influential accounting professors, professional practitioners, and government and business accountants from the United States and other countries. One, two, or three awards are issued most years. There were four in 2000, 2018, and 2019. There were no inductees for 2016 or 2017, nor were there awards in 1966-67 or in 1969-73. Selection to The Accounting Hall of Fame is intended to honor and recognize distinguished service and contributions to the progress of accounting in any of its various fields. Evidence of such service includes contributions to accounting research and literature, significant service to professional accounting organizations, wide recognition as an authority in some field of accounting, advancement of accounting education, and public service. A member must have reached a position of eminence from which the nature of his or her contributions may be established. Now hosted by the American Accounting Association (AAA), The Accounting Hall of Fame was established in 1950 at The Ohio State University (OSU). In 2017, OSU entered into an agreement with the American Accounting Association to transfer the authority to host of the Hall of Fame to the AAA. Since 2017 The Accounting Hall of Fame Transition Team, appointed by the AAA Board of Directors and chaired by Past-President Bruce Behn, who convenes the electors and administers the process, has made the selections. Induction of the 2020 members was held during the virtual Annual Meeting of the American Accounting Association, in August 2020.  Overview  The Hall of Fame describes: \\"While selection to the Hall of Fame is intended to honor the people so chosen, it is also intended to be a recognition of distinguished service contributions to the progress of accounting in any of its various fields. Evidence of such service includes contributions to accounting research and literature, significant service to professional accounting organizations, wide recognition as an authority in some field of accounting, advancement of accounting education, and public service. A member must have reached a position of eminence from which the nature of his or her contributions may be judged.\\" \\"Election to The Accounting Hall of Fame is perhaps the only longstanding national award for accountants -- and probably the only international one as well -- in which both academic and practicing accountants vie for the same award.\\"Jensen Induction into The Accounting Hall of Fame is one of the higher honors available within accounting academia. The only comparable awards in the United States may be two awards of the American Accounting Association: the Notable Contributions to Accounting Literature Award Awardhttp://aaahq.org/Education/Awards which has been received by many of the Hall of Fame inductees, and the rare Seminal Contributions to Accounting Literature Award, which has only been awarded seven times. The sublist of inductees who are accounting academics, thus, includes many of the most notable accounting academics. An accounting of 36 inductees during the first 26 years of the award identifies that 20 were chiefly active in public accounting (including 6 who were founders of major public accounting firms), 10 were university professors, 4 were government officials (including 3 chief accountants of the SEC), and that 2 were most prominent in industry.Burns and Coffman, 344. The Accounting Hall of Fame Pin The recipients of the award are otherwise highly decorated: 21 of the first 36 are recipients of the AICPA's highest honor, its Gold Medal award; 15 received the Alpha Kappa Psi Accounting Foundation Award; at least 15 received honorary degrees, one was knighted in England; and one received \\"the highest honor the U.S. federal government can bestow upon a career civilian employee, the President's Award for Distinguished Federal Civilian Service.\\"Burns and Coffman, 346. In a keynote speech at the 50th anniversary of the Hall of Fame, hosted by The Ohio State University and The Academy of Accounting Historians, Lynn Turner, then chief accountant of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (Washington D.C.), noted the influence of George O. May and numerous other recipients upon the evolution of accounting and auditing practice and principles \\"that makes our system of accounting the greatest in the world\\".Turner The award has always been intended to honor world-level contributions. The majority of recipients have been Americans, perhaps reflecting the historic leadership of America in the development of accounting regulations and in formal accounting research as much as reflecting the U.S.-based hosting of the award. Accounting standards co-evolved with the New York Stock Exchange and other public financial markets which have a scale and history in the U.S. not matched by public markets in most other countries. Englishman Sir Arthur Lowes Dickinson was one of the earliest inductees, honored in 1951 for establishing principles of consolidated accounting for conglomerate companies such as U.S. Steel while he was senior partner of Price-Waterhouse in the U.S. during 1901 to 1913.

It grows to a maximum of long. The body is mainly white, with a series of yellow dots running at diagonal lines over the sides (see photo). A black band extends from the caudal peduncle along the bases of the dorsal and anal fins. There is a narrow black eyestripe edged with yellow. C. selene belongs to the large subgenus Rabdophorus, which might warrant recognition as a distinct genus. In this group, it appears a somewhat distant relative of the Black-backed Butterflyfish (C. melannotus) and the Spot-tailed Butterflyfish (C. ocellicaudus). They are all of oval shape, silvery with yellow fins and snout, ascending diagonal stripes (yellow in C. selene, dark in the others), and black markings around the eyes, on the caudal peduncle, and sometimes on the back. Next closest seem the Saddle Butterflyfish (C. ephippium) and the Dotted Butterflyfish (C. semeion), but these are already so distant that their ancestors are thought to have diverged from those soon after the Rabdophorus lineage started to diversify.Fessler & Westneat (2007), Hsu et al. (2007) The Yellow-dotted Butterflyfish is found on coastal reefs, primarily on rubble slopes from in depth. It feeds on benthic invertebrates.

In 2004, Siegle went freelance, editing a section for Marie Claire UK magazine and became a columnist on ethical living for The Observer. She has written a number of books including Green Living in the Urban Jungle (Green Books 2001), A Good Life (Guardian books, contributing author) and To Die For: is fashion wearing out the world? (Fourth Estate 2011). To Die For was nominated for the Orwell Prize 2012. It forms the basis of the 2015 documentary The True Cost, by director Andrew Morgan. Siegle appears in the movie and was one of the executive producers. =Television= Siegle is a reporter on the nightly BBC One programme The One Show, having joined in 2007.

It is located inside the City Hall. The ZAM permanent collection represents major movements in art from the Nineteenth Century to the present. Established in 1970 by Ruth Zigler with 20 works of art and nine dioramas, the ZAM collection has grown to include over 600 objects. Description The ZAM's exhibitions, which rotate quarterly, include thematic selections from the Permanent Collection, travelling exhibitions, and those curated by ZAM staff. ZAM's collection includes local, national, and international works of art, with an aim to chronicle the development of visual art in Louisiana. Focusing on work of the nineteenth through twenty-first centuries, the museum's fine and decorative arts embody Louisiana's history and culture, while placing this local art within the global scene. This context provides an appropriate backdrop for the museum's focus on emerging Louisiana artists. Highlights from the collection include work by John James Audubon, Charles Sprague Pearce, Helen Turner, Angela Gregory, Clementine Hunter, Ellsworth Woodward, Alexander Calder, Helen Gerardia, Alexander Drysdale, and a large collection of work by William Tolliver. History Ruth Zigler started ZAM' with a trust fund in 1963. An avid collector, she also donated her personal art collection and the Clara Street house that she and her late husband, Fred B. Zigler, had owned since 1908. In anticipation of an expanding art collection and to house nine large wildlife dioramas, Ruth added two wings onto the home in 1969. TheZAM's formally opened to the public in 1970. The ZAM collection now includes works of art by local, national, and European artists. The collection consists of two- and three-dimensional works from the nineteenth through twenty-first centuries, ranging from folk to Impressionist paintings, from native crafts to bronze sculptures, and from carved wood to photography. In December 2015, ZAM moved into the City Hall building. The new facility provided more space for the collection and a location that would allow more interaction with the other cultural entities of Jennings. *Zigler Art Museum Category:Museums in Jefferson Davis Parish, Louisiana Category:Art museums in Louisiana Category:Natural history museums in Louisiana Category:Art museums established in 1970 Category:1970 establishments in Louisiana ","title":"Zigler Art Museum"},{"id":"14925904","text":"Gmina Trzebiesz√≥w is a rural gmina (administrative district) in ≈Åuk√≥w County, Lublin Voivodeship, in eastern Poland.

Born in Havana, Pazos earned a doctorate from the University of Havana in 1938. He was a member of the Cuban delegation to the 1944 Bretton Woods conference. In 1946, he joined the staff of the fledgling International Monetary Fund that had been established at the Bretton Woods conference. He worked there for three years before returning to Cuba in 1950 to head the newly established National Bank of Cuba for two years at the behest of Cuban President Carlos Pr√≠o Socarr√°s. After Fulgencio Batista took power in Cuba through a military coup d'√©tat in 1952, Pazos became active in supporting the resistance against Batista. Batista's rule came under increasing assault during the 1950s, and he and the Cuban military soon found themselves fighting against a young Castro and the forces of his 26th of July Movement. At the time, Castro was waging a guerrilla campaign in the mountainous Sierra Maestra region of Cuba. Batista had declared that Castro had been killed; however, Pazos arranged for The New York Times reporter Herbert Matthews to come and meet Castro in February 1957. The resulting interview refuted Batista's claims, and gave Castro and his revolutionaries international attention. In July 1957, Castro convened a meeting in the Sierra Maestra between his group of rebels and pro-Capitalist representatives, including Pazos. Pazos' signature on the July 12 Sierra Manifesto was meant to help reassure the Cuban people that the revolutionaries were not radical ideologues. Pazos and his family were forced to flee Cuba soon after its release. After Castro's victory in 1959, Pazos returned to Cuba and once again headed the National Bank of Cuba. However, he soon found himself becoming increasingly disillusioned with the new Cuban government. In April 1959, Castro and his aides, including Pazos, visited the United States. Many had suspected that the purpose of the visit was to ask for economic aid, but Castro forbade Pazos from making any such requests. Pazos privately expressed his frustrations to officials at the U.S. State Department and Treasury Department. Pazos' confidence was further weakened when Castro ordered the arrest and imprisonment in October 1959 of Huber Matos, an anti-Communist revolutionary who had recently resigned from office. After Castro angrily denounced the United States for being complicit in the \\"bombing\\" of Havana with thousands of anti-Castro leaflets by the ex- Air Force Chief Pedro Luis Diaz Lanz, Pazos decided to resign. He tendered his resignation on October 23, 1959 to President Osvaldo Dortic√≥s Torrado. Pazos transferred the Presidency of the National Bank of Cuba to Che Guevara on November 26, 1959 and was allowed to leave Cuba soon afterward. Pazos ended up working at the Alliance for Progress and the Inter-American Development Bank, writing many economic articles on Latin America, before retiring in 1975 to Venezuela. He died in Puerto Ordaz. He had three sons and a daughter. His son Felipe starred alongside Spencer Tracy in the 1958 film adaptation of Ernest Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea.

It currently stands as the 3rd-tallest International Style skyscraper in the city, behind the BOK Tower and the Bank of America Center. The building, with its black and white grid exterior floodlighted at night, is a Tulsa landmark. History The building was completed in 1971. It was originally constructed to serve as the world headquarters of Cities Service Oil and Gas Corp., when it moved its headquarters from the famous Cities Service Building in New York City. At one point, the building had 2,300 employees, with transferees from New York, Bartlesville, and Philadelphia. During that time, the company was Tulsa's largest private employer.\\"Dallas group purchases OXY building,\\" Tulsa World, November 17, 1998.

However, as Cities Service and the Citgo brand underwent a series of corporate transformations‚Äîfirst being sold to Occidental Petroleum Corporation, then to Southland Corporation, and ultimately to Petr√≥leos de Venezuela‚Äîthe company's needs changed. Cities Service eventually moved its headquarters out of downtown Tulsa, first to a tower in south Tulsa, then ultimately leaving Tulsa and moving the headquarters to Houston in 2004.

It was organized on January 24, 1913 in Montclair, New Jersey by Emerson Brooks. Although independent of the Boy Scouts of America, it was the precursor of the BSA's Cubbing program now known as Cub Scouting. Background As early as 1911, Ernest Thompson Seton, the Chief Scout of the BSA, had developed a program for the Boy Scouts of America named Cub Scouts of America that was never implemented. Chief Scout Executive James E. West felt that having BSA programs for younger boys under 12 would draw away boys from the core Scouting program. Unofficial programs for younger boys started around this time, under names such as Junior Troops or Cadet Corps. Emerson Brooks, a Boy Scout commissioner, started the Boy Rangers in 1913 and it came to the attention of the BSA. West encouraged further formation of the Boy Rangers of America, as an organization separate from the BSA, and they were incorporated in New York on March 6, 1918. Boy Rangers were organized as a tribe of eight boys and an adult; up to six tribes would form a lodge. Rank levels were Paleface, Papoose, Brave, Hunter, Warrior and Hi-Pa-Nac. The programs used American Indian themes and the Great Laws were based on the BSA version of the Scout Law. The official publication was the magazine The Boy Ranger. The BSA obtained the rights to Baden-Powell's The Wolf Cub Handbook in 1916 and used it in unofficial Wolf Cub programs starting in 1918. The BSA finally began some experimental Cubbing units in 1928 and in 1930 the BSA began registering the first Cubbing packs. Many Boy Ranger lodges converted to Cubbing and the Indian themes of the Boy Rangers were incorporated into early Cubbing programs. Membership numbers are difficult to determine. Some sources state that \\"at its height\\" in the 1920s, the Boy Rangers had over 8,000 members in over 700 lodges throughout 47 states, while another states they had 1039 lodges in 1940. When Emerson Brooks died in 1948, his obituary claimed \\"200,000 members in forty states and several foreign countries.\\" The Boy Rangers mainly merged into the BSA with the birth of Cubbing in 1930. It was reported that Lewis Lawes became the president of the Boy Rangers in 1941. Some lodges‚Äî such as the one formed in Wellesley, Massachusetts in 1926 ‚Äîcontinued locally through the 1980s. The Great Laws survive as a Cub Scout song that is sung to the tune of Yankee Doodle. Fictional Boy Rangers When Columbia Pictures produced the 1939 film Mr. Smith Goes to Washington the Boy Scouts of America refused to allow their name to be used. Columbia created a fictional Boy Rangers for the film with different uniforms. The same organization reappeared in the studio's Blondie in Society (1941).

The name alludes to Mikrokosmos, a set of piano pieces by B√©la Bart√≥k, one of Crumb's favorite 20th-century composers. The first volume of the set was composed in 1972, while the last was completed in early 1979; the first performance of all four volumes in sequence was given by Yvar Mikhashoff, Aki Takahashi, Stephen Manes, Freida Manes, Jan Williams and Lynn Harbold, in Buffalo, New York, on 12 June 1980. Volume I Makrokosmos, Volume I was composed in 1972 for pianist and friend David Burge (who previously commissioned and premiered Crumb's Five Pieces for Piano (1962)). The collection is subtitled Twelve Fantasy-Pieces after the Zodiac and is scored for amplified piano. Its contents are as follows: * Part 1: # Primeval Sounds (Genesis I) (Cancer) # Proteus (Pisces) # Pastorale (from the Kingdom of Atlantis, ca. 10,000 B.C.) (Taurus) # Crucifixus [SYMBOL] (Capricorn) * Part 2: # * The Phantom Gondolier (Scorpio) # Night-Spell I (Sagittarius) # Music of Shadows (for Aeolian Harp) (Libra) # The Magic Circle of Infinity (Moto Perpetuo) [SYMBOL] (Leo) * Part 3: # * The Abyss of Time (Virgo) # Spring-Fire (Aries) # Dream Images (Love-Death Music) (Gemini) # Spiral Galaxy [SYMBOL] (Aquarius) The last piece of each part is notated in such a way that the score forms an image: a cross (piece 4), a circle (piece 8), and a spiral (piece 12). Burge premiered Volume I at Colorado College, Colorado Springs, on 8 February 1973. Volume II The second volume of Makrokosmos was completed in 1973. It largely follows the organizational scheme of the first volume, bears the same subtitle (i.e. Twelve Fantasy-Pieces after the Zodiac) and is also scored for amplified piano. Crumb has stated that the two volumes form a sequence of 24 fantasy-pieces. Volume II comprises the following works: * Part 1: # Morning Music (Genesis II) (Cancer) # The Mystic Chord (Sagittarius) # Rain-Death Variations (Pisces) # Twin Suns (Doppelg√§nger aus der Ewigkeit) [SYMBOL] (Gemini) * Part 2: # * Ghost-Nocturne: for the Druids of Stonehenge (Night-Spell II) (Virgo) # Gargoyles (Taurus) # Tora! Tora! Tora! (Cadenza Apocalittica) (Scorpio) # A Prophecy of Nostradamus [SYMBOL] (Aries) * Part 3: # * Cosmic wind (Libra) # Voices from \\"Corona Borealis\\" (Aquarius) # Litany of the Galactic Bells (Leo) # Agnus Dei [SYMBOL] (Capricorn) Similarly to Volume I, the last piece of each part is notated so that the score forms an image: two circles (piece 4), a cowrie-like shape (piece 8), and the peace sign (piece 12). The collection was premiered by Robert Miller at the Alice Tully Hall, New York City, on 12 November 1974. Volume III A collection of five pieces completed in 1974 and titled Music for a Summer Evening forms the third volume of Makrokosmos. It departs considerably from the previous two. Commissioned by the Fromm Music Foundation for Swarthmore College, the work is scored for two amplified pianos and percussion (two players), contains fewer pieces, and does not associate any of the pieces with Zodiac signs. The contents are as follows: # Nocturnal Sounds (The Awakening) # Wanderer-Fantasy # The Advent (including Hymn for the Nativity of the Star-Child) # Myth # Music of the Starry Night Three of the pieces bear an epigraph: piece 1 from Salvatore Quasimodo's poem Ulysses' Isle, piece 3 from Pascal, and piece 5 from Rilke. Music for a Summer Evening was premiered by Gilbert Kalish and James Freeman (piano), Raymond DesRoches and Richard Fitz (percussion) at Swarthmore College, Pennsylvania, on 30 March 1974. John Keillor has written, ‚ÄúIt is a work so successful and openhearted that Makrokosmos III is among the most frequently performed avant-garde chamber works from the second half of the twentieth century.‚Äù Volume IV The collection that forms the fourth instance of Makrokosmos is titled Celestial Mechanics, and subtitled Cosmic Dances for Amplified Piano, Four Hands. It was completed in April 1979. # Alpha Centauri # Beta Cygni # Gamma Draconis # Delta Orionis The cycle was premiered by Gilbert Kalish and Paul Jacobs at the Alice Tully Hall, New York City, on 18 November 1979.

It is one of the oldest members of this family, first conceived of in 1966 as a theoretical tool, with the first implementation appearing in 1968. Refal was intended to combine mathematical simplicity with practicality for writing large and sophisticated programs. One of the first functional programming languages to do so, and unlike Lisp of its time, Refal is based on pattern matching. Its pattern matching works in conjunction with term rewriting. The basic data structure of Lisp and Prolog is a linear list built by cons operation in a sequential manner, thus with O(n) access to list's nth element. Refal's lists are built and scanned from both ends, with pattern matching working for nested lists as well as the top-level one. In effect, the basic data structure of Refal is a tree rather than a list. This gives freedom and convenience in creating data structures while using only mathematically simple control mechanisms of pattern matching and substitution. Refal also includes a feature called the freezer to support efficient partial evaluation. Refal can be applied to the processing and transformation of tree structures, similarly to XSLT.  Basics  A Refal Hello World example is shown below. $ENTRY Go { = ;} Hello { = ; } The program above includes two functions named Go and Hello. A function is written as the name of the function followed by the function body in curly braces. The Go function is marked as the entry point of the program using the $ENTRY directive. One could think of expressions in the function bodies as function \\"calls\\" in Lisp-like syntax. For example, the Hello function appears to call the built-in Prout function with the string 'Hello world' as the argument. The meaning and the mechanism of the call, however, is quite different. To illustrate the difference, consider the following function that determines whether a string is a palindrome. Pal { = True; s.1 = True; s.1 e.2 s.1 = ; e.1 = False; } This example shows a function with a more complex body, consisting of four sentences (clauses). A sentence begins with a pattern followed by an equal sign followed by a general expression on the right hand side. A sentence is terminated with a semicolon. For example, the pattern of the second sentence of the function is \\"s.1\\" and the expression is \\"True\\". As the example shows, patterns include pattern variables that have the form of a character identifying the type of the variable (what the variable matches) followed by the variable identifier. The variables that begin with an \\"s\\" match a single symbol, those that begin with an \\"e\\" match an arbitrary expression. The variable identifier can be an arbitrary alphanumeric sequence optionally separated from the type identifier by a dot. A function executes by comparing its argument with the patterns of its sentences in the order they appear in the definition, until the first pattern that matches. The function then replaces the argument with the expression on the right hand side of the matched sentence. If the result of a function application includes a subexpression in angle brackets (as it will after the third sentence of our example is applied), the result is further processed by Refal by invoking the function identified by the first symbol in the brackets. Execution stops when the result has no more angle brackets to expand in this way. The function Pal can thus be read informally as: \\"If the expression is empty, replace it with True. Otherwise if the expression is a single symbol, replace it with True. Otherwise if the expression is a symbol followed by an arbitrary expression e.2 followed by the same symbol, replace it with the expression . (In other words, throw away the two identical symbols at the beginning and the end and recurse). Otherwise replace the expression with False. (The pattern e.1 always matches).\\" The following are three step- by-step execution traces annotated with the sentence numbers applied at each step to produce the next (#3) (#3) (#1) True (#3) (#2) True (#3) (#3) (#3) (#4) False We can now see that the Hello World example in fact executes as the sequence of the following expression transformations: Seed the machine with the initial expression marked by $ENTRY: (apply the sentence in Go) (apply the sentence in Hello) (Prout is a built-in that prints and expands to nothing) (nothing to apply; stop) Other examples =Factorial= Fact { 0 = 1; s.N = <* s.N >>; } Here 0 matches 0 the number and produces 1. On any other symbol which is a number, multiply it with the result of (Fact (- s.N 1)) Note the prefix style of operators. =Factorial with loops= Fact { s.n = ; }; Loop { 0 s.f = s.f; s.n s.f = <* s.n s.f>>; } As can be seen s.n acts as the loop counter. =Equality= Equal { (e.1)(e.1) = T; (e.1)(e.2) = F; } Here the function is defined as, if given two terms, and the terms are same then the first clause matches and produces True. else the second clause matches and produces False. An important property of Refal is that all functions in refal are single argument. (But may be decomposed into terms in an expression as above.) =If= Defining control structures is easy If { T Then (e.1) Else (e.2) = e.1; F Then (e.1) Else (e.2) = e.2; } Here the e1 is evaluated only when the expression entered matches 'True' Then e1 Else e2 the same for e2. =Squeeze blanks= Squeeze { e.1'__'e.2 = ; e.1 = e.1; } (Using '_' in place of space char so as to make the function call clear.) The first clause matches whenever the function Squeeze encounters double blanks in its input expression, and replaces it with a single blank. The second clause matches only when the first one did not, and returns the resultant value which is the current expression. =Squeeze using explicit looping= Squeeze { '__'e.1 = ; s.A e.1 = s.A ; = ; };  References  * External links *Refal homepage Category:Tree programming languages Category:Pattern matching programming languages Category:Functional languages Category:Term-rewriting programming languages Category:Homoiconic programming languages ","title":"Refal"},{"id":"14926153","text":"Gmina ≈Åaziska is a rural gmina (administrative district) in Opole Lubelskie County, Lublin Voivodeship, in eastern Poland.

Description Adult males grow to 28‚Äì37 mm, and females grow to 34‚Äì50 mm. They are brownish or greenish, and as they age the color will darken. Some nymphs can be bright yellow. There are black grooves on the pronotum. The male has bootlike appendages at the end of its abdominal tip. There are inverted chevrons along the hind femur, and the hind part of the tibia is yellowish with black spikes. All adults have yellow tarsi and antennae, or in some cases reddish-yellow antennae.

Within its range, it is most often found in heavily weeded areas and grasslands, and even in vacant lots and other urban areas. This species is not migratory, but can travel a few miles to search for food. In the northern part of its range, M. differentialis is about as numerous as the two-striped grasshopper (Melanoplus bivittatus), but in the southern part of its range greatly outnumbers it. Life cycle Differential grasshopper seen in Arlington, Texas, USA There is one generation per year. An adult female lays up to six egg masses in soft soil, each of which can contain 40‚Äì200 eggs. The eggs begin embryonic development the summer they are laid, then enter diapause for the winter, to hatch over a period of about two weeks in early summer of the next year. After hatching, nymphs take about 32 days to reach adulthood. Their development is well synchronized, and most nymphs transform to winged adults during a period of just a few days. Differential grasshoppers are polyphagous, eating both grasses and forbs, but experiments have shown that they grow faster if fed forbs. The most favored food plants tend to be giant ragweed (Ambrosia trifida), common sunflower (Helianthus annuus), and prickly lettuce (Lactuca serriola). Adults can detect a chemical change in wilted lettuce and sunflowers, and will tend to avoid such plants. Agricultural problems A differential grasshopper on top of someone's pants The young grasshoppers feed on various grains, alfalfa and hay crops, while adults attack corn, cotton and deciduous fruit crops. A single swarm can destroy a crop in a few days. Because this species tends to feed in large swarms, it can be a serious threat to farming over most of its range.

With a history dating to 1745, it is one of the oldest surviving market buildings of its type in the nation. This portion, which survives from a longer structure originally extending all the way to South Street, was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1966, and is the centerpiece of the Head House Square historic district. History Established on Lombard Street in 1745 by mayor Edward Shippen and Joseph Wharton, a wealthy merchant,, p. 25 and named \\"New Market\\" to distinguish it from the established market on High (now Market) St., the market was used well into the 19th century. It originally consisted of 16 stalls created by two rows of brick pillars supporting a gable roof and arched ceiling over an open market area, known as the Shambles. By 1797 it had extended to South Street, where it ended in a firehouse, which was later demolished, and eventually extended north to Pine Street as well. In 1804, Joseph Wetherill, a wealthy merchant and master builder, encouraged the City of Philadelphia to erect the Head House at the north end of New Market (Second Street), for which he loaned the city $1,000.\\" Wetherill, Joseph (1740 - 1820): Master Builder; Lumber Merchant; Philadelphia Inspector of Lumber\\" Philadelphia Architects and Builders website The Head House, a Georgian-style brick firehouse with Federal-style ornamentation, was built at the north end of the market; the building's cupola once housed a firebell. The firehouse is the oldest extant in the United States, and is now used as a community center. The market reached its greatest extent, all the way to South Street, by 1811. The market section between Pine and Lombard underwent a major restoration in 1923, which replaced the roof and a number of brick piers. The Head House has also undergone restoration. The site was declared a National Historic Landmark on November 13, 1966.Listing at National Park Service It is a contributing property of the Head House Square National Historic District. It was restored in 1994 by the Head House Conservancy, a non-profit organization. Head House Square Buildings on the square The area around the building, known as Head House Square (or Headhouse Square), features cobblestone streets and a park, as well as one of the oldest continuously run farmer's markets in the nation. The farmer's market is open on Sundays from the first week in May through the week before Christmas, from 10 am to 2 pm, selling locally grown produce and other farm products. The area, which comprises 22 contributing properties over , was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district in 1972. The houses surrounding the square are from the late 18th to early 19th centuries, and the area was extensively restored in the 1950s and 1960s. The houses have always been used both as residences and as commercial buildings. Most are typical middle class examples of their time, though the John Ross House at 401 S. 2nd was one of the largest townhouses of its day. It was visited by George Washington.

The population in 2001 was 421 people, falling slightly to 401 at the 2011 Census. History The name 'Eltisley' hints at its origin as an Anglo-Saxon settlement among woodland. Eltisley (Hecteslei) is mentioned in the Domesday Book: \\"In Longstow Hundred. The Canons of Bayeux hold 3 hides in Eltisley. Land for 9 ploughs. In lordship 1¬Ω hides; 3 ploughs there; 6 villagers with 10 smallholders have 6 ploughs. 5 cottagers; 6 slaves. Meadow for 3 ploughs; woodland, 20 pigs. The total value is and always was ¬£13. Earl Algar held this manor\\"..Cambridgeshire History: Eltisley Eltisley has a large village green, which is at the junction of two ancient roads running from Cambridge to St Neots and from St Ives to Potton. The church, dedicated to St Pandionia and St John the Baptist, stands immediately west of the green and several buildings from the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries stand along its edge, suggesting that the green has been at the centre of the village for a long time. In 1868 it was earmarked for parishioners' recreation and exercise, and cricket is played there in summer. Eltisley Cricket Club was established in 1854 and a thatched pavilion stands on the village green.Eltisley Cricket Club In 1967 an episode of the ITV television series The Prisoner filmed location scenes featuring a cricket match, for the episode The Girl who was Death, on this green. Until 1868, when it was turned into allotments, another green was sited to the east. It appears that there have been at least two centres to the village since medieval times,'Parishes: Eltisley', A History of the County of Cambridge and the Isle of Ely: Volume 5 (1973), pp. 46-59. Date accessed: 9 August 2008. and in 1456, villagers were distinguished as living in either 'le Estende' or 'le Upende'; The parish's population doubled between 1801 and 1871, possibly because of its good road links. In addition to the St Neots‚ÄìCambridge and St Ives‚ÄìPotton roads, the lane towards Caxton may also have been important (judging from its impact on that end of the village, which is known locally as Caxton End). After 1871 the population began to decline, and by 1961 only 253 people lived in Eltisley parish. During World War II, several babies were born in Mill House on The Green in Eltisley, the local nurse‚Äìmidwife, Mrs Nell Rose (1905-1990), having taken in pregnant mothers for their confinements.'Gravestones in Eltisley Church': Eltisley History Society In 2000, the Eltisley Historical Society published The Eltisley Millennium Book, which records the history of the village and the village as it was in the year 2000.Local Heritage Initiative: Eltisley Governance Eltisley has a Parish Council.6villages.co.uk: Eltisley The parish is represented on the South Cambridgeshire District Council by two councillors for the Papworth Everard wardSouth Cambridgeshire District Council: Electoral wards and on Cambridgeshire County Council by one councillor for the Papworth electoral division.Office of Public Sector Information: The South Cambridgeshire (Electoral Changes) Order 2008 It is in the parliamentary constituency of South Cambridgeshire, represented at the House of Commons by Anthony Browne.UK Parliament: Find your MP Geography Eltisley parish is on the border of the historical county of Huntingdonshire. Its borders are marked by isolated trees in many places, rather than following distinct geographical features. Eltisley village is on the western edge of the parish, south of the A428 road 'Cambridge Road' west of its junction with the A1198. The county town of Cambridge is 11 miles (18 km) to the east and the nearest town, St Neots, is 5.5 miles (9 km) west. London is 50 miles (80 km) south. Croxton is the next village west and Cambourne lies to the east. Papworth Everard is to the north along the B1040 and Waresley to the south. The parish is largely flat and ranges from 47 to 65 metres above sea level.Ordnance Survey: Getamap The soil is a heavy clay on gault which, coupled with the terrain, made drainage difficult. Eastern Brook flows towards Caxton and is a tributary of the Bourn Brook. Eltisley Wood had reached its modern state by the early 19th century; a small wood at Papley Grove, in the north of the parish, is presumably what is left of the woodland that belonged to the prioress of Hinchingbrooke. Demography At the time of the 2001 census, 421 people were resident in Eltisley parish. All were white; 75.7% described themselves as Christian, 0.7% followed another religion and 23.6% were not religious or did not state a religion.Cambridgeshire County Council: Parish Census 2001 profile Landmarks Two plaques in the churchyard's lych gate commemorate Eltisley men who were killed in the First and Second World Wars.Roll of Honour: Eltisley Some 17 buildings and constructions in Eltisley are listed, including a red telephone box,Images of England: Telephone Kiosk a village pumpImages of England: Village pump and a mile stone on the St Ives road.Images of England: Milestone Religious sites By around 1230, Eltisley parish church was dedicated to St Pandionia (or Pandwyna), who was said to have been a nun in the parish in the 10th century. Robert Palmer, vicar in 1575, destroyed a well in the churchyard where St Pandionia's body was meant to have been buried originally (in 1576 he was accused of taking church paving for his own use, permitting the vicarage to be used as an ale-house and playing cards when he should have been in church). Her body was said to have been reburied in the church in 1344 and the dedication to St John the Baptist was added later. The oldest part of the current building, the aisled nave, dates from around 1200. The tower and spire were probably built around the 15th century. Robert Palmer may have defaced some monumental effigies during his incumbency and in 1644, William Dowsing destroyed a St Christopher. A strong gust of wind blew out the north window of the chapel in the 17th century and the whole north-west corner was rebuilt in the early 17th century. In 1878, ¬£1,000 was spent on restoring the whole church. It is a Grade II* listed building.Images of England: Church of St John the Baptist and St Pandionia In 1835 a Wesleyan Methodist chapel was constructed; in 1851 the congregation numbered 120 and 45 children came to Sunday school. In 1901 it could hold 140 people but was sold in 1964. A Primitive Methodist chapel was built near the green in 1846 and was still in use in 1968. In 1897, the vicar estimated that 40 out of 90 households in the parish were dissenters.

History  The main market hall Fruit and vegetable hall Designed in the Federation Romanesque style, the architects were Joseph Herbert EalesJ. H. Eales was a Victorian architect who later redesigned parts of the interior of the Weld Club. and Charles Oldham.Often working in partnership with Alfred Cox, Charles Lancelot Oldham was later responsible for such buildings as the P&O; Building in Phillimore St, Fremantle , Wellington Buildings on the corner of William and Wellington Streets, Perth, the former Town Hall in Geraldton, the Murchison Club Hotel in Cue, and buildings at 151-165 Beaufort Street , 18 & 20 Howard Street , and 452-460 William Street in Perth. Oldham died in 1920, but his company exists to this day as Oldham Boas Ednie-Brown Pty Ltd. The foundation stone was laid by Premier of Western Australia Sir John Forrest on 6 November 1897, and the principal construction was carried out between 1898 and 1902 at a cost of ¬£8268. The interior walls are mainly rough washed limestone, with a high iron roof supported by timber columns. The perimeter of the markets is lined with small shops, and the main entry to the market is through ornate stone arches on the Henderson St and Market Street frontages. The buildings functioned as a wholesale food and produce market until the 1950s, when this was taken over by the Perth Metropolitan Markets on Wellington Street. The original verandahs were demolished, and the main body of the market buildings was used as a packing and distribution centre until the early 1970s. The buildings then sat vacant until they were restored by the Fremantle City Council in 1975 using funding from the National Estate grants program, and reopened on 31 October 1975. While the basic structure was retained, the internal layout was altered to accommodate permanent retail stalls, a bar was built in one corner, and the verandahs were replaced. An area known as Farmer's Lane was established to the north of the main market hall, which housed temporary fruit and vegetables stalls covered with tarpaulins and umbrellas.This image shows the service yard at the rear of the markets before the establishment of Farmer's Lane. Part of this area was damaged by fire in May 1992, prompting the building of a new Fruit and Vegetable Hall using tin and timber recycled from the Leach Highway wool stores. This extension won a commendation from the Royal Australian Institute of Architects in 1993, and the Fremantle Markets were permanently entered on the Register of Heritage Places in November of that year.

Little is known about his life there other than he was in a business partnership, he was a participant in Methodist services at the John Street Chapel and formed a friendship with the Reverend Charles Inglis, the rector of Trinity Church where he was a regular communicant. In 1783, Barry was part of a large group of loyalists, including many Methodists, who left New York and ended up in Nova Scotia. In Shelburne he taught school and then became involved in a very successful partnership with his brother in Liverpool. They were involved in West Indies fish, lumber, sugar, and rum trade, as well as agricultural produce. British dry goods were imported for sale in Nova Scotia and stores were operated in many locations. They serviced these with a small fleet of vessels in which they had a substantial interest. Barry had four sons, all of whom were successful in business in the colony. His one son, John Alexander Barry married a daughter of William Black, a prominent Methodist minister and was elected to the 13th General Assembly of Nova Scotia. Robert's Methodism contributed to the family's success by providing close business ties within the colony. His life is a good example of the importance that evangelical Protestantism had in that area of Canada.

After the kidnapping, Rojas was named as Betancourt's vice-presidential candidate. In 2006, it was revealed that Rojas had given birth to a boy named Emmanuel while in captivity. The father is a FARC guerrilla.‚Äú The Colombian Politician With An Incredible Back Story‚Äù NPR [25-02-2014] Rojas had last been seen publicly in a video released by the guerrilla group in 2003. However, on January 10, 2008, Rojas and former congresswoman Consuelo Gonz√°lez were freed after six years in captivity. Betancourt was rescued on July 2, 2008.  Operation Emmanuel  On December 27, 2007, the FARC guerrilla group was said to be planning the imminent release of Rojas, together with her son and congresswoman Consuelo Gonz√°lez, in a one-sided prisoner release negotiated by Venezuelan president Hugo Ch√°vez. Chavez planned their release in an operation dubbed Operation Emmanuel, using Venezuelan aircraft and with the support of the Red Cross. Delay The FARC delayed the release of the hostages because the child, Emmanuel, was missing. According to reports, the FARC had placed the child in custody of a peasant family, and he could not be found in time for the scheduled hostage release. In the meantime, the Colombian government learned that a child fitting Emmanuel's description was in the custody of the Colombian Institute for Family Welfare (ICBF) on December 31, 2007. On January 2, 2008, the government called the FARC's bluff and verified that the child was Emmanuel. Subsequently, on January 4, according to the Colombian government, the child was subjected to a mitochondrial DNA test. According to the Institute of Legal Medicine of Colombia, the test verified that he is in fact Clara Rojas' son. FARC subsequently confirmed this. Emmanuel had become ill as a baby, and Rojas had allowed her son to be taken to a doctor for care on the condition that he would be returned to her. Instead, he was placed into the care of a peasant who did not know to whom the child belonged. = Release = After being temporarily suspended, Operation Emmanuel resumed, and on January 10, 2008, a humanitarian commission headed by the International Committee of the Red Cross flew in two Venezuelan helicopters to a location in Colombia that FARC had designated the previous day. Rojas and Gonz√°lez were then released to the care of the commission.www.miamiherald.com/news/breaking_news/story/373967.htmlYahoo News: 2 hostages freed by Colombian rebels USA Today -video-: Colombian rebels free 2 hostages On January 13, 2008, Rojas was reunited with Emmanuel; it was the first time she had seen her son after being parted from him for more than two years.

Srbija do Tokija (), meaning \\"Serbia to Tokyo\\", is a slogan and catch-phrase dating back to the early 1990s. In 1991, Serbian (then-Yugoslav) football club Red Star Belgrade won the European Cup and the worldwide title in Tokyo, Japan, winning the Intercontinental Cup. This was the greatest success of any football club ever in Yugoslavia, and was much envied by the other nations at the time of increased ethnic tensions. The phrase has been used by Serbian football fans to taunt fans from rival ethnic groups in the beginning of the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s. The phrase is evoked by both Serbian nationalists, and Serbs jokingly mocking Serb exceptionalism alike. Origin of the phrase On May 29, 1991, as inter-ethnic relations in Yugoslavia were growing tenser, Red Star defeated French team Olympique de Marseille to win the European Cup ‚Äì the first Yugoslav team to do so. As the winners of the European Cup, Red Star Belgrade earned a place in the Intercontinental Cup, which was held at the Tokyo National Stadium. Exultant fans coined the phrase to glorify their team's upcoming adventure. On December 8, Red Star won the Intercontinental Cup, defeating Chilean team Colo-Colo. By that time, the tension that had underlain the European Cup match had ignited into the Yugoslav Wars, with a short-lived war in Slovenia, and a full-scale war in Croatia. In this context, the phrase's associations with Serbian victory made it particularly appealing to nationalists and militarists.

Many of these fossils consists only of spines and other fragments, and it is not certain that they belong to the same type of organism. Other specimens appear to be more complete and to represent sessile, bag-like organisms with a soft skin armored with star-shaped calcareous sclerites from which radiate sharp spines. Classifying the chancelloriids is difficult. Some paleontologists classify them as sponges, an idea which chancelloriids' sessile lifestyle and simple structure make plausible. Other proposals suggest that they were more advanced, or at least originated from more advanced ancestors; for example chancelloriids' skins appear to be much more complex than those of any sponge. It has been suggested that chancelloriids were related to the \\"chain mail\\" armored slug-like halkieriids, which are important in analyses of the Cambrian explosion. While the sclerites of the two groups are very similar right down to the microscopic level, and therefore unlikely to have evolved independently, the large dissimilarity in the body plans of the two groups creates a puzzle which is hard to resolve. Occurrence Chancelloriid fossils have been found in many parts of the world, including various parts of Asia (e.g. Siberia, China, Mongolia), Australia's Georgina Basin, Canada's Burgess Shale, and the United States. The earliest known fossils come from the small shelly fossil assemblage of the Anabarites trisulcatus Zone of the Lower Nemakit-Daldynian Stage, Siberia and its analog in China is the Anabarites trisulcatus-Protohertzina anabarica Zone of the basal Meishucunian Stage. The fossil record suggests that chancelloriids declined rapidly during the Late Cambrian, and they were probably extinct by the end of the Cambrian. Free full text without images at They were first described in 1920 by Charles Doolittle Walcott, who regarded them as one of the most primitive groups of sponges. Description The chancelloriids had bag-like bodies with an orifice at the top, and show no evidence of internal organs. The different species show a variety of shapes and sizes, for example: Chancelloria eros was a slim cone with the narrow end at the bottom, typically long and in diameter at its widest point; Allonnia junyani formed a disk or cylinder usually in diameter, and the tallest were about long. Most of the fossils consist of collections of mineralized hard parts called sclerites, and an assembly that is thought to have belonged to one individual is called a scleritome. Many specimens consist only of scattered sclerites, whose form is used to classify them, and some specimens have not yet been assigned to a species or even genus. Individual sclerites had star-shaped bases that lay flat against the body and one spine projecting outwards at a right angle. The sclerites had internal cavities and in fact many are preserved as castings of the cavities filled with phosphate. It is thought that when the animals were alive these cavities were filled with tissues that secreted the hard outer coverings. It is not clear what the hard substance of the walls was since it has been replaced or converted to a different crystalline form. This suggests it was a slightly unstable material such as aragonite, a form of calcium carbonate. Some sclerites appear to be on top of the skin, other covered by it, and some appear partly covered. Lifestyle Chancelloriids probably lived on muddy sea-floors, as their sclerites increase in size from the bottom to the top, and all had thickenings at the bases, which are regarded as anchors; they are often preserved in attachment to other organisms or shelly debris. They were very likely filter- feeders. Since the sclerites were external and non-interlocking, they could not have functioned as supporting \\"struts\\". Since the body was sessile and attached to the sea-bed, the sclerites would not have aided locomotion by increasing traction. So the only conceivable function for the sclerites appears to be defence against predators, rather similar to the spines on modern cacti. Classification The classification of chancelloriids is difficult, contentious and important to paleontologists' view of the evolution of multi-celled animals. Walcott classified chancelloriids as sponges, a view that was first queried by Bengston and colleagues, who considered the hollow, multi-part spicules to be quite unlike anything secreted by a sponge. Butterfield and Nicholas (1996) argued that they were closely related to sponges on the grounds that the detailed structure of chancellorid sclerites is similar to that of fibers of spongin, a collagen protein, in modern keratose (horny) demosponges such as Darwinella. However Janussen, Steiner and Zhu (2002) opposed this view, arguing that: spongin does not appear in all Porifera, but may be a defining feature of the demosponges; the silica-based spines of demosponges are secreted by specialist sclerocyte cells that surround them, while mineralized chancellorid sclerites were hollow and filled with soft tissues connected to the rest of the animal by restricted openings in the bases of the sclerites; chancellorid sclerites were probably made of aragonite, which is not found in demosponges, and the only sponges that use aragonite are the sclerosponges, whose soft bodies cover hard, often massive skeletons made of either aragonite or calcite, another form of calcium carbonate; sponges have loosely bound-together skins called pinacoderms, which are only one cell thick, while the skins of chancellorids were much thicker and shows signs of connective structures called belt desmosomes. In their opinion the presence of belt desmosomes made chancellorids members of the Epitheliazoa, the next higher taxon above the Porifera, to which sponges belong. They thought it was difficult to say whether chancellorids were members of the Eumetazoa, \\"true animals\\" whose tissues are organized into Germ layers; chancellorids' lack of organs such as sense organs, muscles and a gut would seem to exclude them from the Eumetazoa; but possibly chancellorids descended from Eumetazoans that lost these features after becoming sessile filter-feeders. Porter (2008) argued that the sclerites of chancelloriids are extremely similar to those of the halkieriids, mobile bilaterian animals that looked like slugs in chain mail and whose fossils are found in rocks from the very Early Cambrian to the Mid Cambrian. The hollow \\"coelosclerites\\" of halkieriids and chancelloriids resemble each other at all levels: both have a thin external organic layer, and an internal \\"pulp cavity\\" that is connected to the rest of the body by a narrow channel; the walls of both are made of the same material, aragonite; the arrangement of the aragonite fibers in each is the same, running mainly from base to tip but with each being closer to the surface at the end nearest the tip. Porter thought it extremely improbable that totally unrelated organisms could have developed such similar sclerites independently, but the huge difference in the structures of their bodies makes it hard to see how they could be closely related. This dilemma, she suggested, may be resolved in various ways: * One possibility is that chancelloriids evolved from bilaterian ancestors but then adopted a sessile lifestyle and rapidly lost all unnecessary features. However the gut and other internal organs have not been lost in other bilaterians that lost their external bilateral symmetry, such as echinoderms, priapulids, and kinorhynchs. * On the other hand, perhaps chancelloriids are similar to the organisms from which bilaterians evolved. That would imply that the earliest bilaterians had similar coelosclerites. However, there are no fossils of such sclerites before , while Kimberella from , which shows no evidence of sclerites, was almost certainly a bilaterian. * One solution to this dilemma may be that preservation of small shelly fossils by coatings of phosphate was common only for a relatively short time, during the Early Cambrian, and that coelosclerite-bearing organisms were alive several million years before and after the time of phosphatic preservation. In fact there are over 25 cases of phosphatic preservation between and , but only one between and . * Alternatively, perhaps the ancestors of both chancelloriids and halkieriids had very similar but unmineralized coelosclerites, and at some intermediate time independently incorporated aragonite into these very similar structures.

Playwright In 1971, he became co-artistic director of the Citizens Theatre in Glasgow, until his retirement in May 2003. During that time, he directed fifty productions and wrote fifteen plays for the company including The De Sade Show (1975), Chinchilla (1977), Summit Conference (1978 ‚Äì later seen in the West End with Glenda Jackson, Georgina Hale and Gary Oldman), A Waste of Time (1980), Don Juan (1980), Webster (1983), In Quest of Conscience (1994), Britannicus (2002) and Cheri (2003). Translator MacDonald translated over seventy plays and operas from ten different languages; in her obituary for MacDonald, Sarah Jones wrote \\"...it was for his translations, stemming from his ability to speak at least eight languages fluently, that MacDonald may well be best remembered. He brought a diet of Goethe, Lermentov, Gogol, Goldoni and Racine, not only to Glasgow audiences, but to those around Europe and America...\\". He translated five of Friedrich Schiller's plays, which led Michael Billington to write in 2005, \\"why is Schiller no longer box-office poison? The first crucial fact is that actable versions of the plays are now readily available. MacDonald was the great pioneer in this area, but Jeremy Sams, Francis Lamport, Mike Poulton and several others have also rid the plays of swagger and fustian.\\" MacDonald's translations include The Threepenny Opera, Tamerlano, Die Entf√ºhrung aus dem Serail, The Barber of Seville, Aida, Beaumarchais' The Marriage of Figaro, Cocteau's Orpheus and The Human Voice, D√ºrrenmatt's Conversation at Night, Fassbinder's Shadow of Angels, Genet's The Balcony, The Blacks and The Screens, Gogol's The Government Inspector, Goethe's Tasso and Faust I and II, twelve of Goldoni's plays, Ibsen's Brand and Hedda Gabler, Lermontov's Maskerade, Lorca's The House of Bernarda Alba, Moli√®re's School for Wives and Dom Juan, Pirandello's Enrico Four, Racine's Ph√®dre, Schiller's Mary Stuart, The Maid of Orleans and Don Carlos, Chekhov's The Seagull, Verne's Around the World In Eighty Days, Wedekind's Lulu and Goethe‚Äôs Clavigo. His translations of Rolf Hochhuth include his works The Representative, Soldiers and Judith. One of MacDonald's early successes was War and Peace, which he had translated from Erwin Piscator's 1955 German stage adaptation of Tolstoy's novel. MacDonald's version reached Broadway in 1967. With Giles Havergal, he adapted Thomas Mann's novella Death in Venice for a one-man production in 1999. Following a run in Glasgow, the production has traveled to several theaters in Europe and the USA. Death MacDonald died of a heart attack, aged 74.

History  The Grand Theatre is housed in the historic Lougheed Block, which was built in 1912 by Sir James Alexander LougheedJames Alexander Lougheed when Calgary had a population of only 50,000 people. The building was designed by L.R. Wardrop and owned by Lougheed and Taylor, a firm established by Sir Lougheed. The Lougheed Block was built as a multi-purpose commercial building, accommodating retail stores, offices, living quarters, and The Grand Theatre on the ground floor. The Grand was the biggest theatre in the Pacific Northwest at the time and attracted well-known performers such as Sarah Bernhardt, Fred Astaire, Ethel Barrymore, the Marx Brothers, George Burns, Arthur Rubinstein, and Paul Robeson, among others. The Grand Theatre was also the centre of Calgary's social and political life and served as a venue for political rallies, debates, and speaking engagements. Both the Liberal and Conservative Parties held rallies at the theatre as did Nellie McClung of the \\"Famous Five,\\" Prime Minister Robert Borden, and Premier William Aberhart. The original Grand Theatre was fashioned with 1,350 seats (810 on the main floor and 540 in the upper gallery) and boasted the largest stage in Canada when it first opened. The Grand was considered modern for its time as all 15 of the dressing rooms below the stage had hot and cold running water as well as electric lighting. The theatre was also equipped with an automatic sprinkler system. In 1957, with the opening of The Southern Alberta Jubilee Auditorium, The Grand Theatre became primarily a movie house, an incarnation that lasted for almost 50 years. In 2005, local theatre company Theatre Junction Society, raised $12 million to purchase The Grand, thus saving it from demolition. Theatre Junction transformed the old theatre into the Theatre Junction GRAND.http://www.theatrejunction.com/ In December 2018, the theatre rebranded itself to The Grand.

He made the first winter ascent of four of the eight-thousanders: Shishapangma in 2005, Makalu in 2009, Gasherbrum II in 2011, and Nanga Parbat in 2016., He also ascended Everest four times in 2000, 2002, 2006, 2010. Moro is also an experienced helicopter pilot. In 2013, Moro and two other rescue experts carried out the world's highest long-line rescue operation on a helicopter, on Lhotse, at 7800m. On 12 November 2015, he set a new flight altitude world record, (Category E-1a Max Takeoff weight less than 500 kg), in an ES 101 Raven, turboshaft powered helicopter, (6705m).  Early life  Born in Bergamo, Italy to middle-class parents, he grew up in the borough of Valtesse and was strongly supported by his father in his passion for the mountains. His father was a climber and biker at a high level and also created a lively and international environment around him. He started climbing the Presolana and other massifs of the Alpi Bergamasche at the age of 13, however he continued his studies until graduating cum laude at the university.  Mountain climbing career  Moro began his climbing activity in the Grigne near his home city and in the Dolomites. His father was his first mentor, followed by Alberto Cosonni and Bruno Tassi. In this period he was primarily involved in rock climbing, an activity he has never given up. In 1992 he participated in his first Himalayan expedition to Mount Everest. One year later Moro climbed Aconcagua, achieving the first winter ascent of that peak. During his career, he has attempted a number of mountains including Cerro Mirador and Makalu in 1993; Shishapangma and Lhotse in 1994, Kangchenjunga in 1995. In 1996 Moro climbed the west wall of Fitz Roy (3341 m in Patagonia) in 25 hours from the base to the summit and back to the base. In the same year, he climbed Shishapangma South (8008 m) without oxygen in 27 hours using skis in the descent from 7100 meters. In 1997 he summited Lhotse. In Winter 1997 he attempted the South face of Annapurna. During this attempt, his climbing companions Anatoli Boukreev and Dimitri Sobolev died in an avalanche. He tried Everest again in 1998; summited four peaks Pik Lenin (7134 m), Peak Korzhenevskaya (7105 m), Ismoil Somoni Peak (7495 m, formerly known as Pik Kommunizma), Pik Khan Tengri (7010 m) with young Kazakhstan guide Denis Urubko; then summited Everest with him in 2000 and Marble Wall in winter 2001. In 2002 he summited three peaks: Mount Vinson, Cho Oyu and Everest; summited three peaks: Broad Peak, Elbrus and Kilimanjaro in 2003, summited Baruntse along a new route and tried Shishapangma and Annapurna in 2004; Batura and Batokshi peaks in 2005, Broad Peak in winter 2006 and 2007. In 2005 he achieved the first winter summit of Shishapangma, with Piotr Morawski. In 2006 he completed a solo south‚Äìnorth traverse of Everest descending from the top in five hours. In 2008 he made (with Herv√® Barmasse) the first ascent of Beka Brakai Chhok (6950 m Karakorum). The climbing was in pure alpine style and in 43 hours. In January 2009 Moro made the first winter ascent of Makalu with Denis Urubko, and in February 2011 the first winter ascent of Gasherbrum II with Denis Urubko and Cory Richards. In April 2013, along with Ueli Steck and Jonathan Griffith, he was involved in a brawl with a group of Sherpas, with the incident being reported worldwide. In February 2016, he completed the first winter ascent of Nanga Parbat with Alex Txikon and Ali Sadpara.Nanga Parbat: summit and first winter ascent by Simone Moro, Ali Sadpara and Alex Txikon In February 2018, he completed the first winter ascent of Peak Pobeda, Sakha along with fellow Italian mountaineer Tamara Lunger.https://www.planetmountain.com/en/news/alpinism/simone-moro-tamara- lunger-first-winter-ascent-pik-pobeda-siberia.html Rescue missions in Nepalese Himalayas In May 2001 he tried to traverse Everest‚ÄìLhotse: during an attempt on the wall of Lhotse at 8000 metres he abandoned the climb to search, rescue and save English alpinist Tom Moores. Moro was a recipient of the Fair Play Pierre de Coubertin trophy from UNESCO, the Civilian Gold Medal from Italian president Carlo Azeglio Ciampi and the David A. Sowles Memorial Award from the American Alpine Club. Tom Moores recalls his meeting with Moro this way: In 2009, he bought a helicopter with his own money to carry out search and rescue operations in the Nepalese Himalayas for Nepalese people. He has piloted the helicopter several times to rescue alpinists, sherpas, trekkers and people in remote areas. Charitable work In 2003, Moro projected and financed a school for 396 Sherpa children in the Nepalese village of Syadul. The objective of the project, carried with an Italian foundation, was to prevent early school leaving in the area. The school was opened in 2005. It is located in a village a thousand meters above sea level and three hours from the nearest road. Near the Nanga Parbat base camp, he financed, built and donated to the Pakistani district of Gilgit Baltistan a small masonry building for local shepherds and a small hospital in the village of Ser.

It is often found in association with Cloudina. Its tube has a \\"tube-in-tube\\" structure composed of several thin layers. It bears prominent longitudinal sculptures and / or irregular rings, which were formed by the wrinkles of tube layers, and weaken gradually towards the inner layers. The organism probably had a sessile life-style, lying on the sea floor. Sinotubulites and Cloudina (discovered in 1972) are currently the two earliest known fossils of organisms that mineralized shells when alive, and are often found in the same fossil beds. It is remarkable that Cloudina specimens often have tiny holes bored in them, which are attributed to predators, while no such borings have been found in Sinotubulites. This suggests that Sinotubulites had evolved features that made it a much less attractive target than Cloudina. As a result, both organisms are important in analyses of the Cambrian explosion, as predation and the appearance of mineralised components are often cited as possible causes of the \\"explosion\\".

It hinges on the idea that when presented with charity, in some location such as a soup kitchen, a person will act in one of two ways: using the charity to improve their situation, or coming to rely on charity as a means of survival. The term Samaritan's dilemma was coined by economist James M. Buchanan. The argument against charity frequently cites the Samaritan's dilemma as reason to forgo charitable contributions. It is also a common argument against communism and socialism, claiming that state aid is equivalent to charity, and that the beneficiaries of such aid will become slothful or otherwise negligent members of society. The more aid that is received the less likely the recipient will seek out a permanent solution for their condition. The dilemma's name is a reference to the biblical Parable of the Good Samaritan.  Samaritan's dilemma in disaster preparedness  A study published in 2016 looked at 5089 major natural disasters in 81 developing countries over a 33-year period. Results showed that among the countries that received natural disaster relief had less incentives to provide their own natural disaster protections. This effect is exacerbated the poorer and less-developed the country is that receives the aid.  Samaritan's dilemma in economics In subsidized credit programs, for example, easy credit is handed to farmers who need a lower interest rate. Incentives play a large part in these types of programs, as governments, as well as workers both benefit from the government benefits. This is because governments want to maximize the amount of borrowers, and farmers are likely to overstate their level of need for assistance from the government in subsidized credit programs. According to the Foundation for Economic Education, \\"Cheap credit extended by the Farm Credit System and the Farmers Home Administration during the inflationary period of the late 1970s was partly responsible for the dramatic increase in farm bankruptcies and financial stress of agriculture during the mid-1980s.\\"  Avoiding the Samaritan's dilemma  Much foreign aid comes in the form of monetary compensation for damages or direct relief such as food or water. This type of direct aid does not provide any incentive for the recipient to become independent. By introducing incentives that developing countries can meet by building up natural disaster protection the effects of the Samaritan's dilemma can be effectively mitigated.

History Information on the beginnings of Bolton baseball are scarce. The earliest known details date back to 1938. The then named Bolton Scarlets Baseball team played their first game at Raikes Park in Bolton against a team from Oldham in May 1938. The modern team began in the summer of 2002 while Matthew Norburn was the General Manager and player for Manchester A's Baseball Club. Frustrated with the lack of direction and commitment Norburn decided to look into setting up a new club in his hometown of Bolton. After early talks with the Bolton Local Authority, who were eager to have a baseball team set up in Bolton plans moved forward. Norburn recruited fellow player Barrie Joyce from Manchester to help set the club up. Norburn and Joyce finished off the season in Manchester and Norburn resigned as the club's GM. Bolton Baseball Club took the team name of Brewers and went about preparing for 2003 baseball season, with only two team members. The Brewers soon secured a council grant that would ensure adequate equipment could be purchased. As the 2003 season came closer Bolton had built up a good roster size with former junior players and people new to the sport. However the planned baseball field would not be ready till the end of the inaugural season. In a last minute deal Bolton Baseball agreed to join CMB Sports Club located in Lostock and became known as CMB Baseball Club. Bolton Baseball Club remained part of CMB Sports Club for 3 years before making a move to their own facility. The team took this opportunity in 2006 to rename the team to the Blaze. The move to a new ground proved to be one of the biggest mistakes the club would ever make. The new ground provided by the Local Authority turned into a money pit. The ground situated off Slack Lane, Westhoughton was continually flooded by poor drainage. Looking to put a brave face on and play the season opener on this poor attempt of a field, Bolton awaited visiting team Humber. After looking at the state of the field, Humber refused to play at that site. The teams did however manage to locate a suitable site across town to play the game at Markland Hill Playing Fields. With no official home field, Bolton played the rest of the 2006 season at two different locations. During the 2006 off-season major interest was put to the local council for use of the Markland Hill playing fields. After many discussions with the council it was agreed that Bolton Baseball Club could use the field. The field was renamed the Ballpark at Stapleton Avenue. Since the 2007 season the Blaze have invested heavily in developing the ball park in the aim that it will become one of the best facilities in the country. During 2007 a junior baseball team was re-introduced into the Bolton community, originally headed by John Baxendale and later to be fulfilled by Andrew Lee Heaton. The junior team, named the Bears, entered league play in 2008. In 2009 the junior team was taken over by Dave Clugston who is still currently the junior team manager. In 2008 the Bolton Blaze changed its name to Bolton Robots of Doom after a much- maligned voting process. The name change was met with a mixed reaction from its own players. Some embraced the outlandish new name, whilst others remained unimpressed; so much so that one player duly quit the team citing the name change as being utterly ridiculous. As one fan on a public forum put it...\\"You cannot make this stuff up!\\". Nevertheless, club GM, Matthew Norburn, pressed on and remained unmoved by any criticism. Once the name was formally announced in the public domain, it again was greeted with varied reactions. Local team rivals scorned and ridiculed the club, whilst baseball fans bought into the spirit of such an unusual name, to the point where fans of the MLB's New York Mets began a thread on a fans' forum grandslamsingle.com discussing what they felt was a unique and inspired team name. One thing was guaranteed, no other baseball team had the name Robots of Doom. Over the next few years, the team would evolve on a playing level. By introducing more talented players into the team Bolton R.o.D. would develop from its status as perennial division whipping boys, to serious divisional contenders. The team would also begin to take part in mid-season European tournaments, beginning in Dublin in 2008 where on the opening day Bolton R.o.D. almost upset the British allstar team, Northern Knights and kept within touching distance of the Irish national side, Team Ireland. Then it was off to the Netherlands in 2009 & 2010, where the standards of baseball were at higher levels than had previously encountered. These elements combined would ultimately lead the club to its first ever playoff appearance in 2009, and a second playoff appearance in 2010 following the club's greatest success when it won AA/A North Division Title with a winning record of 18‚Äì6. 2010 also saw the club's first ever win on European soil against Hagen Chipmunks of Germany, and ultimately finishing 4th narrowly losing by 1 run to the tournament favourites Rouen Dragons of France. In 2010 the club were featured in a two-page article entitled 'Bolton's Batmen' in Lancashire Life magazine, which covered the club's history and involvement in the Bolton community, and club GM Matthew Norburn was interviewed for BBC Radio live on air. This was Norburn's final act as club GM before returning to his native Canada and handing over General Manager's role over to Dom Clarke who lead the club into the 2011 season.

The newspaper has daily editions (sold at $1) and Sunday/Thanksgiving Day editions (sold at $2). The paper is particularly notable for its Pulitzer Prize-winning picture of Baby Jessica McClure when she was rescued from her well in neighboring Midland, Texas. The American was owned by Freedom Communications until 2012, when Freedom papers in Texas were sold to AIM Media Texas. History In 1895, William C. \\"Uncle Billy\\" Griffin came to Odessa from Midland and began publishing Ector County's first newspaper the Odessa \\"Weekly News\\". The \\"Weekly News\\" lasted only one year, and was followed by six other short-lived weekly publications until August 1927, when production of Odessa \\"Times\\" and Odessa \\"News\\" began. In October 1928, the two weekly papers were merged as the Odessa \\"News-Times\\". The towns of Penwell and Goldsmith supported, for a short time during oil boom of the 1930s, the only Ector County newspaper known to have been published outside Odessa. The first daily newspaper, the \\"Daily Bulletin\\", began in 1936, and the \\"New-Times\\" followed in 1937. On Oct. 2, 1940, R. Henderson Shuffler consolidated the \\"Daily Bulletin\\" and the \\"News-Times\\" into the \\"Odessa American\\", which he sold on Aug. 11, 1945. Ownership of the newspaper changed twice before Aug. 13, 1948, when it was purchased by Raymond C. Hoiles of Freedom Newspapers, Inc. That company, which later became Freedom Communications, sold the Odessa American along with its other Texas properties to AIM Media Texas, LLC, on May 18, 2012.

Sheridan based his work on John Vanbrugh's The Relapse (1696), removing much of the bawdy content. The play was reworked as one of three plot strands in a 1982 revival by Alan Ayckbourn, with the action taking place in the Royal Hotel, Scarborough. The first performance was on 8 December that year. It is a technically demanding piece as the actors are required to take on several roles, with quick changes between scenes as the play switches from the 18th century to World War II to the present day. Ayckbourn updated the production when it returned to the Stephen Joseph Theatre in the town during 2007‚Äì2008. Plot The hero of the play, Tom Fashion, arrives penniless in Scarborough, attended by but one faithful servant, Lory, who privately informs the audience that he will never desert his master until he pays him his wages. Fashion has come to visit his rich elder brother, Lord Foppington, whom he hopes to be able to beg money from. When he arrives, he finds his friend, Colonel Townley, also in town. Townley tells him that Lord Foppington is about to be married to a rich young lady, the daughter of Sir Tunbelly Clumsey, a gentleman of the region. However, he also learns that the two have never met, and are communicating through a go-between, who was an old ally of Fashion's, one Dame Coupler. He determines if possible to outwit his brother, and by marrying the girl, obtain her fortune. The colonel promises to help him, and they soon also are able to enlist the support to another acquaintance of theirs, Loveless. He was the more inclined to help them as Lord Foppington had recently had the audacity to make love to his wife, Amanda. The plot thickens as Colonel Townley's beloved Berinthia comes on the scene; he sees her as a frustratingly capricious woman, but she mainly acts this way because she wants to severely test her admirer's fidelity before accepting his proposals, not satisfied with his previous loose way of life. In anger, to make her jealous he pretends to make love to Amanda himself, who rigidly repulses him, and not comprehending his game, Loveless in turn begins to persecute Berinthia. Eventually their complicated diversion comes to light, and with it settled, the more serious game of stealing Lord Foppington's intended can proceed. Tom Fashion goes to Dame Coupler, and obtains letters of introduction from her at Sir Tunbelly's house. Quickly ingratiating himself there, the father agrees for them to be wedded the next week, but Tom bribes Miss Hoyden's nurse to marry at once, before Lord Foppington's imminent arrival. When he comes, they manage to keep up the pretense of his being an impostor for a little, but eventually some friends of his appear, and Tom is forced to own to the deception. However, the couple is already safely married and thus Tom gains his desired end ‚Äì a bride, a fortune, and the utter discomfiture of his brother.

Lions have been hunted since antiquity.

These hunts nearly resulted in the extermination of lion populations in North Africa by 1100 BC. Commemorative artwork has been found telling of how during a single hunt, pharaoh Amenhotep III killed more than 100 lions. =Assyria= In ancient Assyria, lion hunting was a ritualized activity reserved for kings. These hunts were symbolic of the ruling monarch's duty to protect and fight for his people.British Museum - Room 10a: Assyria: Lion hunts The Lion Hunt of Ashurbanipal, a sequence of Assyrian palace reliefs from the North Palace at Nineveh dating from about 645 BC in the British Museum in London show King Ashurbanipal hunting lions.Lions in Stone: Lion hunting in Assyria In fact the \\"royal lion hunt\\", was the staged and ritualized killing by the king of lions already captured and released into an arena. The realism of the lions has always been praised, although the pathos modern viewers tend to feel was perhaps not part of the Assyrian response.Reade, Julian, Assyrian Sculpture, pp. 72-79, 1998 (2nd edn.), The British Museum Press, The Assyrian kings hunted lions for political and religious purposes, to demonstrate their power. To get the lion out of his cage and onto the Syrian plains, a servant would raise a door and start running. Then the lion would get beaten by dogs and beaters, so that the lion would go to the king. The king would kill the lion from a chariot with his bow and arrow or spear. Sometimes the king would kill it on foot with a sword. He would do this by holding it by the mane and then thrusting the sword into the lion's throat. Then, when the lion was killed, the king would pour a Liquid over it and give a speech to the cities(?) god to thank him, so the lion's evil spirit wouldn't come back and haunt him. Expert spearmen and archers would protect the king. Sometimes the king would invite some nobles to accompany him. =Caucasus= Before the end of the 10th century, Asiatic lions were hunted by 'Shirvanshakhs' in South Caucasia. =Greece= Depiction of a hunting scene on a dagger blade, 16th century BC Mycenae, Greece. A lion hunt shown in gold work on a belt plaque, Late Roman, 4th century, Turkey. Lions were present in the Greek peninsula until classical times; the prestige of lion hunting was shown in Heracles' first labour, the killing of the Nemean lion, and lions were depicted as prominent symbols of royalty, as for example in the Lion Gate to the citadel of Mycenae. =Republic of South Africa= The first South African legislation on the killing of predators was established in 1656. Six realen were awarded to those who shot or captured lions. In the 1890s, over 4000 lions were killed both inside and outside Kruger National Park in an effort to boost game populations. Between 1903 and 1927, no fewer than 1,272 lions were killed by park personnel. Maasai lion hunting The Maasai people have traditionally viewed the killing of lions as a rite of passage. Historically, lion hunts were done by individuals, however, due to reduced lion populations, lion hunts done solo are discouraged by elders. Most hunts are now partaken by groups of 10 warriors. Group hunting, known in Maasai as olamayio, gives the lion population a chance to grow. However, in Kenya, where this practice is illegal, olamayio may be used as a reason for retaliatory killing against lions suspected of killing livestock. Maasai customary laws prohibit killing a sick or infirm lion. The killing of lionesses is also prohibited unless provoked. At the end of each age-set, usually after a decade, the warriors count all of their lion kills to compare them with those hunted by the former age-set in order to measure accomplishment. =Group hunting= Moghul Lion Hunt Empikas (warrior delegation) plan a lion hunt in advance in secret. Only the warriors are permitted to know about the day of the hunt. The secret is considered so important that Ilbarnot (young warriors) from the same age-set are denied information regarding the hunt, due to the older warriors fearing discovery from anti-hunt groups. If a warrior is found guilty of spreading rumours, he is punished through beating. In addition, the guilty warrior will be looked down upon throughout his entire age group's cycle. =Solo hunting= Solo lion hunting requires confidence and advanced hunting skills, requiring a dedicated warrior. Unlike group hunting, solo lion hunting is usually not an organised event, sometimes occurring when a warrior is out herding cattle. =The journey= The lion hunt starts at dawn, when elders and women are still asleep. The warriors meet discreetly at a nearby landmark where they depart to predetermined areas. Before departing, the Ilmorijo (older warriors) filter out the group in order that only the bravest and strongest warriors take part. The resulting group is known as Ilmeluaya (fearless warriors). The rejected young warriors are commanded by older warriors to keep the information of the hunt confidential, until the return of their favoured colleagues. There have been cases whereby older warriors have forced warriors to give up their excess weaponry, seeing as it is considered insulting to bring more than a spear which is sufficient to kill a lion. After a successful hunt, a one-week celebration takes place throughout the community. The warrior who struck the first blow is courted by the women and receives an Imporro, a doubled-sided beaded shoulder strap. The warrior wears this ornament during ceremonies. The community will honor Olmurani lolowuaru (the hunter) with much respect throughout his lifetime. =Body parts= The Maasai do not eat game meat, and use the bodies of their killed lions for three products; the mane, tail and claws. The mane is beaded by women of the community, and given back to the hunter, who wears it over his head on special occasions. After the meat ceremony, when a warrior becomes a junior elder, the mane is thrown away and greased with a mixture of sheep oil and ochre. This sacrificial event is done to avoid evil spirits. The lion's tail is stretched and softened by the warriors, then handed over to the women for beading. The warriors keep the tail in their manyatta (warriors camp), until the end of warriorhood. The lion tail is considered the most valuable product and after graduation, the warriors must gather to pay their last special respect to the tail before it is disposed of. Hunting methods =Spot & stalk= This method is typically employed by sport hunters with the assistance of a professional hunter and at least one native tracker. A walk-and-stalk is very action packed when the encounter occurs. Lions are unpredictable, nimble and fast, meaning that if it was not killed in the first shot, it can be very vindictive. If wounded, it can lie in wait and potentially charge at the hunter, targeting just one person in the hunting party with the intent to kill. Lions largely prefer to inhabit wooded savannah grasslands, meaning that hunting them during the summer is a very difficult task, as the mane camouflages well with the underlying undergrowth. Most people use a .375 caliber rifle to kill instantly. =Hounding= Throughout history all manner of pariahs, hounds, terriers and mongrels have been used by man in the pursuit of lion in Africa and (in ancient times) the Middle East. Most notably among these lion hunting dogs is the Rhodesian Ridgeback. Hounding for lion (and subsequent use of the Rhodesian Ridgeback for this purpose) saw its greatest popularity and participation levels during the \\"Great White Hunter\\" period, essentially the second half of the 19th century and earliest decades of the 20th century. As hounding for lion has been on the decline since that time, hounding for leopard has seen an inversely proportional increase in popularity. This transition may be due at least in part to the increasing popularity of American and Continental scent hounds among African houndsmen and P.H.'s, as leopard are much less likely to make their stand on solid ground (as lion tend to do), and are much more likely to bay to tree. Although, commensurate with their increasing popularity, several packs of such scenthounds are in regular use today by P.H.s and guides as lion hunters throughout southern Africa. This method of lion hunting involves the hunter releasing a pack of dogs bred for this purpose in an area known for high levels of lion activity or over fresh spoor/tracks. The pack will track the lion and then hold the lion at bay until the hunter can close the distance and kill the lion at close range. =Baiting= This common method involves the hunter lying in ambush from a constructed blind about 30-50 yards off from a bait, usually an ungulate carcass, after hanging or fastening the carcass to a tree in a likely area. The bait is then checked every day until there is evidence of a hungry lion present in the area. A large spoor or long black-tipped hairs on the bait signal the building of a blind. The blind is built on the ground or in a tree nearby where the hunter will lie in wait usually in mid-afternoon or early mornings. Controversy Ernest Hemingway, 1934; sport hunting in the 19th and 20th centuries caused massive declines in the lion population. Taxidermied Lion and Blue Wildebeest, Namibia Lion hunting is a subject of controversy in modern times. Currently, the lion is listed as a vulnerable species by the IUCN, and some subspecies are listed as endangered. Fewer than 20,000 survive in the wild, a reduction of 60% in the last two decades. There were estimated to be 1.2 million lions in 1880.National Geographic Society Big Cats Initiative Lion Decline Map Retrieved July 29, 2015 This decline is mainly due to poaching of them and their prey, further influenced by excessive legal trophy hunting and habitat destruction. In addition to the direct population loss from trophy hunting, opponents argue that trophy hunting of lions primarily kills large males, leading to a smaller and potentially less healthy lion population. Also, when a dominant male is killed it often leads to other deaths when male lions fight for the slain lion's pride and then kill its cubs to eliminate genetic competition. Opponents note that tourism to look at live animals contributes much more to the local economy than trophy hunting of lions does. It is estimated that only 3% of revenue generated by lion hunting actually goes to the communities affected by it. Proponents of trophy hunting argue that it is a tool that can be used to raise money for local communities and conservation organizations, and that a limited amount of trophy off-take will not harm animals at a population level. It is estimated that trophy hunting generates at least $201 million USD per year in the 23 sub-Saharan African countries that allow it. The mean trophy fee for hunting one lion in Namibia is approximately 22,000 USD, and hunters also spend money on services such as safari packages, lodging, and tour guides. In the summer of 2015, the killing of Cecil, a popular lion in Zimbabwe, by an American tourist created a significant international backlash against the hunter and of the practice of hunting lions. The majority of trophy body parts from lion hunting go to the United States.

He also was a member of the Winnipeg Blue Bombers in the Canadian Football League. He played college football at Oregon State University. Early years Born in Los Angeles, California to Romanian immigrant parents Nick and Persida Paulescu, he was fluent in Romanian before he could speak English. Paulescu played basketball, soccer, track and football at Whittier Christian High School in La Habra, California. He earned four letters in football and soccer, and two in track and field. In addition to kicking, Paulescu also played wide receiver, running back and defensive back. As a junior, he scored three touchdowns, intercepted two passes and kicked a prep career-best 43-yard field goal in one game. He also scored 17 goals for the soccer team. As a senior, he was named team defensive MVP and first-team All-Olympic League as a kicker. Paulescu played in the 605 All-Star game in the summer of 2002. College career Paulescu accepted a football scholarship from Fullerton College under head coach Gene Murphy in 2003. As a freshman in 2002, he averaged 36.7 yards on 53 punts. His special teams coach was Jim Wren, who was USC's punter in 1996 when Mike Riley was the offensive coordinator. As a sophomore, Paulescu was the fifth-leading scorer among California Junior College players as a kicker. He scored 73 points in 10 games (37-37 PAT, 12-17 FGs) booted a 57-yard field goal against Santa Monica College, and was perfect on all three attempts over 41 yards. He made a 25-yarder in overtime to give Fullerton a 24-21 win over Riverside City College on November 15. He averaged 45.6 yards on 46 attempts during the regular season, with a long of 84 yards, raising his average to 46.5 yards after three playoff games as a punter. He also bettered his all-time long punt with an 86-yarder against Santa Monica College in the U.S. Bank Beach Bowl on November 22. He was selected first team All-American by J.C. Grid-Wire and by J.C. Athletic Bureau, earned first-team All-Mission Conference; first-team All-California J.C. Region IV, and first-team All-California as selected by the California Community College Football Coaches Association. Paulescu transferred to Oregon State University, where as a junior he received honorable-mention All-Pac-10 and OSU Special Teams Co-MVP honors. He began his senior year on the Ray Guy Award watch list and averaged 43 yards per punt, ending his OSU career with 48 punts downed inside the 20-yard line ‚Äì 24 each season. He was the Pac-10 Special Teams Player of the Week in 2005, after having six punts downed inside the 20-yard line, including two at the 1-yard line, in a win at No. 18 California. He made 21 punts of 50-plus yards during his career, including a career-best of 69 yards against Washington State University in 2004. As a senior, he posted 56 punts for a 43-yard average and was named to the Pac-10 All-Conference first-team, marking the first punter in OSU history to earn such a distinction. He finished his college career as arguably the top punter in the program's history.

Asante (born December 1979) is a British-born broadcast journalist, editor and environmentalist of Guyanese and Ghanaian descent. Early life Asante was born in London to a Guyanese, South American mother and Ghanaian, West African father, who met as students at the University of Cambridge. She is a princess of the royal family of Oyemum in Ghana, via her grandmother who was Queen mother of Shama District (formerly known as the Shama Ahanta East Metropolitan District), in the Western Region of Ghana, with ancestral linage from the Asante Akim North Region. She is both Fante and Ashanti. Asante spent her early and primary school years with her grandparents in both Demerara and Linden, Guyana before returning to the United Kingdom for secondary education in North London. Together with her mother she emigrated to Canada at where she later studied Humanities at the University of Alberta.\\"Radio 3 Presenters ‚Äì Shaheera Asante\\". BBC. Retrieved 24 February 2010. Cite web requires website= (help) Career Asante began working as a music and entertainment television presenter in Canada working for Citytv, Much Music, Vancouver Television and Rogers Cable. During the late 1990s, she produced and presented various entertainment and music programmes including her own programme, World Music Express, at the time one of the youngest presenters of what was then the first dedicated world music show of its kind in North America. Africa's music icons Manu Dibango, Baaba Maal, Oumou Sangare, Angelique Kidjo and Femi Kuti among others appeared as guests on Asante's show, which earned her a Best Ethnic and Cultural Expression TV Series Award, in both 1998 and 1999, from the Cable Television Awards in New York. Asante returned to the United Kingdom in 2000, and became a presenter for BBC Radio 3's Late Junction from 2001 to 2007, during this time the show won a Sony gold award in 2003 for Music Programming. She then co-created and presented BBC's first online African show Africa on Your Street. dedicated to promoting African content and culture. Asante worked across the BBC networks as freelance presenter, producer and writer. In 2004, she wrote and presented radio documentaries including Somaliland and Goddess in Every Woman for BBC World Service. In London, Asante curated several high-profile exhibits for \\"Africa 05\\" to promote more positive images of Africa and Africans in the media. Asante said she was \\"fed up of the negative images of Africa in the media. which negated positive and empowering stories and people\\". In 2007, she created Ghana 50 and Forward Africa as two large-scale contemporary curatorial exhibitions, at the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, the opening of which music producer Quincy Jones attended. She has also lectured on contemporary African art and society at the Hayward Gallery in London and continues to be a creative pioneer for contemporary African culture. In March 2007, Asante co- hosted Resistance and Remembrance, an event at the British Museum to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the Abolition of the Transatlantic Slave Trade. An apparent decision by BBC Radio 3's Late Junction executive producer Andrew Kurowski to temporarily replace her on one of the Late Junction programmes, to accommodate a more \\"English folk-roots season of music\\" according to Asante, was criticised in The Times by music columnist Paul Donovan: \\"Asante, was incensed to be told by e-mail by the show‚Äôs producer Andrew Kurowski, that for her next scheduled programme she would not be presenting, but would be temporarily replaced by Mark Russell, who had not been a presenter of the programme since 2001. She regards the stated reasons as spurious.\\" In response to this comment the BBC stated: ‚ÄúTo our knowledge, Shaheera hasn‚Äôt made these accusations to us. She is on contract, and no decision has been made to take her off Late Junction, or the Radio 3 network.\\" Asante continues as a freelance producer for other BBC networks, and insisted that there were no hard feelings between her and BBC Radio 3, and that the station \\"did not represent the entire BBC broadcasting network\\". Asante said she had \\"enjoyed many years at BBC to date\\" and \\"continues to have a close affinity with her producers and other staff\\" and was \\"committed to great programme making\\". Environmental advocacy Asante founded the first Cambridge Eco-Living Festival, (2017-2019) in the iconic city of Cambridge in which she created a city-wide #GoPlasticFreeDay and the UK's first pop up eco lifestyle centre within a retail shopping centre.

CyArk's mission is to \\"digitally record, archive and share the world's most significant cultural heritage and ensure that these places continue to inspire wonder and curiosity for decades to come.\\" CyArk's website CyArk's founder, Ben Kacyra, stated during his speech at the 2011 TED Conference that the organization was created in response to increasing human and natural threats to heritage sites, and to ensure the \\"collective human memory\\" is not lost while making it available through modern dissemination tools like the internet and mobile platforms.Video of Ben Kacyra's speech at the TED 2011 conference The organization is known for its work with a number of partners in producing high-quality digital scanning of World Heritage Sites, such as Angkor Wat, Pompeii, Chichen Itza, the Eastern Qing tombs, Nineveh, the Antonine Wall, Mount Rushmore, and many others. History Profile of Tikal Temple II CyArk was founded in 2003 by Iraqi expatriate and civil engineer Ben Kacyra. In the 1990s, Kacyra was instrumental in the invention and marketing of the first truly portable laser scanner. The scanner, called the Cyrax, was designed for surveying purposes, and was produced by Cyra Technologies. In 2001, Cyra Technologies and all rights to the invention were sold to the Swiss firm Leica Geosystems. After sale of the company, Ben Kacyra dedicated his energy to using the new technology to document archaeological and cultural heritage resources, and to the CyArk organization. CyArk's primary focus has been the digital documentation of threatened ancient and historical architecture. This architecture includes sites such as Colorado's Mesa Verde, Italy's Pompeii, Wyoming's Fort Laramie, and Kacyra's native Mosul in Iraq ‚Äì also known as the biblical Assyrian city of Nineveh. CyArk has generated a fairly large amount of publicity since its inception. Initially, this was in part due to the relevance of Kacyra's life story to the ongoing Iraq War, during which much of the country's cultural patrimony was destroyed amidst a spasm of looting and heavy military damage to important historical sites such as Babylon and Samarra. As the public face of the CyArk organization, Ben Kacyra became a popular speaker at conferences such as Google's Zeitgeist (2008), and TEDGlobal (2011), describing his life story and the potential of digital preservation to save the \\"collective treasure\\" of global heritage. In recent years, however, he has taken on more of an advisory role, while the independent non-profit organization CyArk has gathered considerable momentum. As of 2014, CyArk has become a major entity in the historic preservationist and cultural resource/heritage management communities. The 2014 CyArk 500 Annual Summit was held at the National Archives Building in Washington, D.C. The theme was \\"Democratising cultural heritage: Enabling access to information, technology and support.\\" Project focus 3-dimensional projection of Tikal Temple II CyArk seeks to help preserver heritage sites around the world through utilizing digital documentation to support the work of heritage managers and further connect people with the history of these sites. According to the site's website, they work across three principle areas: conservation, recovery, and discovery.CyArk Website CyArk's digital data may be useful for professionals monitoring and managing gradual architectural deterioration at cultural sites.Interview with Ben Kacyra in National Geographic (October 2010) This data could also make it possible to generate blueprints for reconstruction following catastrophic events, such as the Afghan Taliban's notorious demolition of the Bamiyan Buddhas in 2001 or the 2010 destruction by suspected arson of the Royal Tombs of Kasubi, Uganda. The Kasubi Tombs were digitally preserved by CyArk a year before their demise, providing a lasting digital record and potential blueprint for reconstruction. In 2019, CyArk launched Open Heritage 3D in partnership with Historic Environment Scotland and the University of Southern Florida to make digital data of heritage sites available to download online for people to use for educational purposes. According to CyArk's online mission statement, the dissemination of free digital content about heritage sites can help encourage additional visits by tourists, and invigorate communities with revenue from cultural tourism. Youth and educators will benefit from free, publicly accessible historical and site information, including some Creative Commons- licensed content. And finally, the creation of digital records ensures not only that the sites will never be lost forever; it also provides a digital resource to facilitate the continued mining of information over time as technologies and methods of information extraction evolve.

CyArk is now primarily funded through individual project funding, corporate in-kind support, and foundation grants/donations. Corporate funders as of 2014 include Microsoft, IBM, Iron Mountain, Autodesk, and Trimble Navigation.

He began his career in silent films in 1921. By the time of his final performance in 1951, he had appeared in over 350 films, nearly all of them in small and/or uncredited bit parts. Ring is probably best known today for his role as Harvey Yates, a con artist and accomplice to fellow con artist Penelope, played by Kay Francis in the Marx Brothers first film The Cocoanuts (1929). He also appeared in uncredited small parts in two other Marx films, Monkey Business (1931) and A Day at the Races (1937). Biography Born in Massachusetts, he was the brother of actress Blanche Ring and the first husband of actress/dancer Charlotte Greenwood (from 1915‚Äì1922; divorced). He died on July 17, 1967 in Hollywood, California, aged 74. Reviews The Cocoanuts was Ring's most prominent role. In the New York Times review on May 25, 1929, Mordaunt Hall singled Ring out for criticism: \\"Cyril Ring, in an amateurish fashion, does the honors as the conspiring Mr. Yates, whose great hope in this adventure is to cash in on Mrs. Potter's gems. Mr. Ring, who has impersonated regiments of villains on the silent screen, here plays his part as though everybody but his determined female partner were both sightless and deaf.\\" Marx Brothers historian Matthew Coniam observed, \\"It seems to me he makes a perfectly good job of villainous Harvey Yates in The Cocoanuts.

She has been successful in establishing a concert career in North America, Europe and Asia. She has composed several original compositions, and has adapted music ranging from major classical repertoire to video game soundtracks to Taiwanese folk songs for the organ and other instruments. Education and career Chen began piano studies at a young age, studying with Jane Smisor Bastien and Lori Bastien Vickers. At age fifteen, she began studying organ, first with Leslie Robb, and later with Monte Maxwell, Chapel Organist for the United States Naval Academy. After only two years of lessons, she was accepted into the Juilliard School, where she studied first with John Weaver and then with Paul Jacobs, completing her undergraduate degree in 2005 and her graduate degree in 2006. In 2006, she was accepted for a Fulbright Fellowship and spent the next year composing and performing in Taiwan, where she played an important role in increasing exposure to the pipe organ in that country. In 2007, she was accepted into the Artist Diploma program at Yale University, where she studied with Thomas Murray. She performs a wide variety of repertoire, and in addition to works from the standard repertory, she has premiered both her own compositions and works of fellow Juilliard composers such as Teddy Niedermaier and Ola Gjeilo. Chen has been the recipient of numerous awards. In 2003, she won the Region IX regional convention of the American Guild of Organists. In 2004, she made it to the final round of the Augustana/Reuter National Organ Undergraduate Competition, returning next year to win first place.Augustana/Reuter Organ Competition past winners While at Juilliard, she was awarded the John Erskine Prize for scholastic and artistic distinction. In 2005, she recorded her first CD and DVD at Heinz Chapel in Pittsburgh. In 2004 and 2006, she was invited to perform at the AGO National Conventions in Los Angeles and Chicago. In addition to her academic studies, she maintains a busy performing career both in the states and abroad. She has recently performed in San Diego, Dallas, New York, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore, among other places. Notable upcoming performances include her debut at the Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, and a performance of Messiaen's \\"La Nativite du Seigneur\\" at Christ Church in New Haven, Connecticut, in celebration of the 100th anniversary of his birth. Recently, Chen was appointed to the position of Organist and Artist in Residence at Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. In addition to her role as organist, Chen will also oversee a new annual concert series at the church. Reviews \\"Chelsea played with confidence, style, and imagination at a level that many older performers would surely envy. She went on to win the Augustana Arts/Reuter competition in Denver in 2005, and superbly presented a fully memorized program to an American Guild of Organist's Winter Conclave in Las Vegas in January 2006, and appeared again for the AGO in Chicago [at the National Convention] this summer. All of 21 years old, at the time Chelsea was also invited to play at the Heinz chapel of the University of Pittsburgh, during an American Institute of Organbuilders Conference. On that occasion she shared music which she herself had composed--honoring her father and his Chinese ancestry--a Taiwanese Suite based on folk melodies. Both Bach and Reger surely would have approved of the formidable talent of our soloist Chelsea Chen. The [organ's] future is in the hands as players such as Chelsea Chen who not only perform exceptionally well but also compose for the organ and encourage other friends of their generation to write for it too.\\"Michael Barone - Pipedreams #0704 \\"I believe that I spied the figures in the stained glass windows dancing along with Chelsea's music. Ms. Chen is to be congratulated for an excellent recital. She presented herself in a professional, well-informed and humble manner.\\"Bob Riday - Lehigh Valley Chapter of the AGO \\"At [organbuilders] conventions I generally listen intently to the instrument, appreciate the efforts of the organist, and pay relatively little attention to the performances. But I was powerless to ignore the playing of Chelsea Chen. It's easy to qualify, to say 'she's great...for one so young!' Playing like that is captivating, regardless of age. It wasn't just that I enjoyed her selections or agreed with her choice of stops. She does not play the organ. She makes the organ her instrument for making music. Her every move is musical. Every piston she pushes, every manual change, every tiny nudge of the shades is a fluid part of her music. I watched her left hand playing the almost inaudible accompaniment in the Bach 'Badinerie'. Every note perfectly attacked and released. Not fussy, just perfect. If Chelsea Chen is a harbinger of the generation on the horizon, there's going to be a lot of organbuilding to do.\\"Journal of American Organbuilding, Volume 20, No. 1 Footnotes External links *Chelsea Chen Website *Chelsea Chen Recordings and Sheet Music Category:1983 births Category:Living people Category:American organists Category:Women organists Category:Composers for pipe organ Category:People from San Diego Category:21st-century American women musicians Category:21st- century organists Category:21st-century American keyboardists ","title":"Chelsea Chen"},{"id":"14927599","text":"Gmina W≈Çodawa is a rural gmina (administrative district) in W≈Çodawa County, Lublin Voivodeship, in eastern Poland, on the border with Belarus and Ukraine.

In some rural communities, the extraction and sale of ice continues to be a primary natural resource for local economies. Ice merchants extract the blocks with an axe by hand and transport them down from the mountains atop mules. The unit of sale is usually an ice block weighing approximately 40 kilos which is sold to Shikashika vendors. Each block sells for approximately 17 USD. In turn, Shikashika is sold for approximately 15 cents in plastic bags with colorful sweet syrups at Andean festivals and on market day. The word Shikashika is onomatopoeia from the Amerindian language Quechua.

The rivalry was the second oldest in the Big 12 Conference and third oldest west of the Mississippi River. However, it ended following the 2010 game, when Nebraska and Missouri met in league play for the last time prior to Nebraska's 2011 move to the Big Ten Conference. In November 2011, Missouri announced that it would join the Southeastern Conference in July 2012. Series history The Tigers and Cornhuskers have met 104 times since 1892, dating back to the formation of the Western Interstate University Football Association. The rivalry remained competitive through 1978, with Nebraska leading the series 37‚Äì32‚Äì3 up to that point. However, starting in 1979, Missouri lost the next 24 games. Following a close overtime game in Columbia in 1997, the rivalry began to gain attention once again. A miraculous touchdown catch by Nebraska's Matt Davison tied the ballgame at the end of regulation, which allowed #1 Nebraska to barely escape a loss to unranked Missouri. Davison caught the ball after it bounced off the hands, chest, foot of a Missouri safety and foot of teammate Shevin Wiggins in what is now known as the famous Flea Kicker play. Nebraska went on to share the national title with Michigan. An unranked Missouri finally broke through in 2003 with a 41‚Äì24 victory over #10 Nebraska. Fans, players, and coaches from both sides had remarked that in recent years the rivalry had returned to the levels of intensity that was felt prior to the late 1980s. A Missouri campus tradition came to an end following the Tigers' win over Nebraska in 2005. Anytime the goalposts were torn down at Faurot Field, they were carried out of the stadium, around the columns, and then finally to Harpo's Bar and Grill at 29 S. Tenth Street in downtown Columbia, in a tradition that dated back to 1971. Students rushed the field and tore down the goal posts following the Missouri wins in 2003 and 2005. Following the 2005 incident, 20 fans were arrested on trespassing charges and the university announced it would be forming an internal task force to reduce fan rowdiness. In May 2006, Missouri athletic director Mike Alden announced that collapsible goalposts would be installed for the upcoming 2006 season, hoping to end any future incidents with students rushing the field to tear down the goalposts. End of the rivalry On June 11, 2010, the Nebraska Cornhuskers announced that its regents unanimously voted to end the university's affiliation with the Big 12 Conference, and would be joining the Big Ten Conference beginning with the 2011 season. Therefore, the October 30, 2010 contest between these two teams was the last unless the programs meet in a future non-conference game or postseason bowl game. On November 6, 2011, the Missouri Tigers announced their decision to leave the Big 12 for the Southeastern Conference beginning with the 2012 season. Due to both Nebraska's and Missouri's move to the Big Ten and SEC respectively, there are actually several opportunities for the teams to possibly meet in a bowl game each season. Three bowls feature the Big Ten and SEC as their contracted matchup, in addition to the possibility that other bowls can take teams from the Big Ten or SEC if their contracted conferences fail to produce enough bowl- eligible teams. Victory Bell The Victory Bell (sometimes known as the Missouri‚ÄìNebraska bell) was awarded to the winner of the Nebraska and Missouri football game annually. The exchange was organized by the Innocents Society of Nebraska and QEBH of Missouri. The tradition dated back to 1892 when these teams first met, when the bell was taken from a church in Seward, Nebraska by members of Nebraska fraternities Phi Delta Theta and Delta Tau Delta. At the time, the members of the two fraternities occupied the same house. When the two groups moved into separate houses, there was a dispute over who should keep the bell. Annual scholastic or athletic contests were held, with the bell being used as a trophy. This rivalry abated, yet still the ownership of the bell was left in question. In 1926, Missouri athletic director Chester D. Brewer suggested an annual award be established for the annual Missouri- Nebraska football game. The bell was selected to be the prize to end the conflict between the fraternities, and the letters 'M' and 'N' were engraved on opposite sides of the bell. The exchange was coordinated by the Innocents Society and Missouri's prestigious Q.E.B.H. Society. Missouri won the first game in 1927 7‚Äì6. The scores from the games up through 2005 are engraved on the bell. With Nebraska's victory over Missouri in the final league meeting of these teams on October 30, 2010, Nebraska's Memorial Stadium became the apparent final home of the Victory Bell, though a commemorative bell will be produced for permanent display at the University of Missouri. It is possible that the Victory Bell could change hands again if the teams meet in a future non-conference game or postseason bowl game.

Motivation  Much software testing is merely hopeful, seeking to exercise the software system in various ways to see whether any faults can be detected. Testing may indeed reveal some faults, but can never guarantee that the system is correct, once testing is over. Functional testing methods seek to improve on this situation, by developing a formal specification describing the intended behaviour of the system, against which the implementation is later tested (a kind of conformance testing). The specification can be validated against the user- requirements and later proven to be consistent and complete by mathematical reasoning (eliminating any logical design flaws). Complete functional testing methods exploit the specification systematically, generating test-sets which exercise the implemented software system exhaustively, to determine whether it conforms to the specification. In particular: * Full positive testing: confirms that all desired behaviour is present in the system; * Full negative testing: confirms that no unintended behaviour is present in the system. This level of testing can be difficult to achieve, since software systems are extremely complex, with hundreds of thousands of states and millions of transitions. What is needed is a way of breaking down the specification and testing problem into parts which can be addressed separately. = Scalable, Abstract Specifications = Mike Holcombe first proposed using Samuel Eilenberg's theoretical X-machine model as the basis for software specification in the late 1980s.M. Holcombe (1988) 'X-machines as a basis for dynamic system specification', Software Engineering Journal 3(2), pp. 69-76. This is because the model cleanly separates the control flow of a system from the processing carried out by the system. At a given level of abstraction, the system can be viewed as a simple finite state machine consisting of a few states and transitions. The more complex processing is delegated to the processing functions on the transitions, which modify the underlying fundamental data type X. Later, each processing function may be separately exposed and characterized by another X-machine, modelling the behaviour of that system operation. This supports a divide-and-conquer approach, in which the overall system architecture is specified first, then each major system operation is specified next, followed by subroutines, and so forth. At each step, the level of complexity is manageable, because of the independence of each layer. In particular, it is easy for software engineers to validate the simple finite state machines against user requirements. = Incrementally Testable Specifications = Gilbert Laycock first proposed a particular kind of X-machine, the Stream X-Machine, as the basis for the testing method. The advantage of this variant was the way in which testing could be controlled. In a Stream X-Machine, the fundamental data type has a particular form: X = Out* √ó Mem √ó In*, where In* is an input stream, Out* is an output stream, and Mem is the internal memory. The transitions of a Stream X-Machine are labelled with processing functions of the form œÜ: Mem √ó In ‚Üí Out √ó Mem, that is, they consume one input from the input stream, possibly modify memory, and produce one output on the output stream (see the associated article for more details). The benefits for testing are that software systems designed in this way are observable at each step. For each input, the machine takes one step, producing an output, such that input/output pairs may be matched exactly. This contrasts with other approaches in which the system runs to completion (taking multiple steps) before any observation is made. Furthermore, layered Stream X-Machines offer a convenient abstraction. At each level, the tester may forget about the details of the processing functions and consider the (sub-)system just as a simple finite state machine. Powerful methods exist for testing systems that conform to finite state specifications, such as Chow's W-method.T. S. Chow (1978) 'Testing software design modelled by finite state machines', IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 4 (3), pp. 178-187.  Specification Method  When following the (Stream) X-Machine methodology, the first stage is to identify the various types of data to be processed. For example, a word processor will use basic types Character (keyboard input), Position (mouse cursor position) and Command (mouse or menu command). There may be other constructed types, such as Text ::= Character* (a sequence of characters), Selection ::= Position √ó Position (the start and end of the selection) and Document ::= Text √ó Selection √ó Boolean (the text, a possible selection, and a flag to signal if the document has been modified). = High-Level Specification = The top-level specification is a Stream X-Machine describing the main user interaction with the system. For example, the word processor will exist in a number of states, in which keystrokes and commands will have different effects. Suppose that this word processor exists in the states {Writing, Selecting, Filing, Editing}. We expect the word processor to start in the initial Writing state, but to move to the Selecting state if either the mouse is dragged, or the shift-key is held down. Once the selection is established, it should return to the Writing state. Likewise, if a menu option is chosen, this should enter the Editing or Filing state. In these states, certain keystrokes may have different meanings. The word processor eventually returns to the Writing state, when any menu command has finished. This state machine is designed and labelled informally with the various actions that cause it to change state. The input, memory and output types for the top-level machine are now formalised. Suppose that the memory type of the simple word processor is the type Document defined above. This treats a document as a text string, with two positions marking a possible selection and a flag to indicate modification since the last save-command. A more complex word processor might support undoable editing, with a sequence of document states: Document ::= (Text √ó Selection)*, which are collapsed to one document every time a save- command is performed. Suppose that the input type for the machine is: In ::= Command √ó Character √ó Position. This recognises that every interaction could be a simple character insertion, a menu command or a cursor placement. Any given interaction is a 3-tuple, but some places may be empty. For example, (Insert, 'a', Œµ) would represent typing the character 'a'; while (Position, Œµ, 32) would mean placing the cursor between characters 32 and 33; and (Select, Œµ, 32) would mean selecting the text between the current cursor position and the place between characters 32 and 33. The output type for the machine is designed so that it is possible to determine from the output which processing function was executed, in response to a given input. This relates to the property of output distinguishability, described below. = Low-Level Specification = If a system is complex, then it will most likely be decomposed into several Stream X-Machines. The most common kind of refinement is to take each of the major processing functions (which were the labels on the high-level machine) and treat these as separate Stream X-Machines. In this case, the input, memory and output types for the low-level machines will be different from those defined for the high-level machine. Either, this is treated as an expansion of the data sets used at the high level, or there is a translation from more abstract data sets at the high level into more detailed data sets at the lower level. For example, a command Select at the high level could be decomposed into three events: MouseDown, MouseMove, MouseUp at the lower level. Ipate and Holcombe mention several kinds of refinement, including functional refinement, in which the behaviour of the processing functions is elaborated in more detail, and state refinement, in which a simple state-space is partitioned into a more complex state-space. Ipate proves these two kinds of refinement to be eventually equivalentFlorentin Ipate (1995) Theory of X-Machines with Applications in Specification and Testing, PhD Thesis, Department of Computer Science, University of Sheffield. Systems are otherwise specified down to the level at which the designer is prepared to trust the primitive operations supported by the implementation environment. It is also possible to test small units exhaustively by other testing methods. = Design-For-Test Conditions = The (Stream) X-Machine methodology requires the designer to observe certain design for test conditions. These are typically not too difficult to satisfy. For each Stream X-Machine in the specification, we must obtain: * Minimal Specification: The specification must be a minimal finite state machine. This means that the state machine should not contain redundant states, that is, states in which the observable transition behaviour is identical to that in some other state. * Deterministic Specification: For each state of the machine, at most one of the processing functions œÜ should be enabled for the current memory and next input value. This ensures that the required behaviour to be tested is predictable. * Test Completeness: Each processing function œÜ must be executable for at least one input, with respect to all memory states. This ensures that there are no deadlocks, where the machine is blocked by the current state of memory. To ensure test completeness, the domain of a function œÜ may be extended with special test inputs that are only used during testing. * Output Distinguishability: It must be possible to distinguish which processing function was invoked from its output value alone, for all memory-input pairs. This ensures that the state machine can be decoupled from the processing functions. To ensure output distinguishability, the codomain of a function œÜ may be extended with special test outputs that are only relevant during testing. A minimal machine is the machine with the fewest states and transitions for some given behaviour. Keeping the specification minimal simply ensures that the test sets are as small as possible. A deterministic machine is required for systems that are predictable. Otherwise, an implementation could make an arbitrary choice regarding which transition was taken. Some recent work has relaxed this assumption to allow testing of non-deterministic machines.F. Ipate and M. Holcombe (2000) 'Testing non-deterministic X-machines'. In: Words, Sequences, Grammars, Languages: Where Biology, Computer Science, Linguistics and Mathematics Meet, Vol II, eds. C Martin-Vide and V. Mitrana, Kluwer. Test completeness is needed to ensure that the implementation is testable within tractable time. For example, if a system has distant, or hard-to-reach states that are only entered after memory has reached a certain limiting value, then special test inputs should be added to allow memory to be bypassed, forcing the state machine into the distant state. This allows all (abstract) states to be covered quickly during testing. Output distinguishability is the key property supporting the scalable testing method. It allows the tester to treat the processing functions œÜ as simple labels, whose detailed behaviour may be safely ignored, while testing the state machine of the next integration layer. The unique outputs are witness values, which guarantee that a particular function was invoked.  Testing Method  The (Stream) X-Machine Testing Method assumes that both the design and the implementation can be considered as (a collection of) Stream X-Machines. For each pair of corresponding machines (Spec, Imp), the purpose of testing is to determine whether the behaviour of Imp, the machine of the implementation, exactly matches the behaviour of Spec, the machine of the specification. Note that Imp need not be a minimal machine - it may have more states and transitions than Spec and still behave in an identical way. To test all behaviours, it must be possible to drive a machine into all of its states, then attempt all possible transitions (those which should succeed, and those which should be blocked) to achieve full positive and negative testing (see above). For transitions which succeed, the destination state must also be verified. Note that if Spec and Imp have the same number of states, the above describes the smallest test-set that achieves the objective. If Imp has more states and transitions than Spec, longer test sequences are needed to guarantee that redundant states in Imp also behave as expected. = Testing all States = The basis for the test generation strategy is Tsun S. Chow's W-Method for testing finite state automata, chosen because it supports the testing of redundant implementations. Chow's method assumes simple finite state machines with observable inputs and outputs, but no directly observable states. To map onto Chow's formalism, the functions œÜi on the transitions of the Stream X-Machines are treated simply as labels (inputs, in Chow's terms) and the distinguishing outputs are used directly. (Later, a mapping from real inputs and memory (mem, in) is chosen to trigger each function œÜ, according to its domain). To identify specific states in Imp, Chow chooses a characterization set, W, the smallest set of test sequences that uniquely characterizes each state in Spec. That is, when starting in a given state, exercising the sequences in W should yield at least one observable difference, compared to starting in any other state. To reach each state expected in Spec, the tester constructs the state cover, C, the smallest set of test sequences that reaches every state. This can be constructed by automatic breadth-first exploration of Spec. The test-set which validates all the states of a minimal Imp is then: C \\\\otimes W, where \\\\otimes denotes the concatenated product of the two sets. For example, if C = {, } and W = {, }, then C \\\\otimes W = \\\\\\\\{\\\\langle ac \\\\rangle, \\\\langle ad \\\\rangle, \\\\langle bc \\\\rangle, \\\\langle bd \\\\rangle \\\\\\\\}. = Testing all Transitions = The above test-set determines whether a minimal Imp has the same states as Spec. To determine whether a minimal Imp also has the same transition behaviour as Spec, the tester constructs the transition cover, K. This is the smallest set of test sequences that reaches every state and then attempts every possible transition once, from that state. Now, the input alphabet consists of (the labels of) every function œÜ in Œ¶. Let us construct a set of length-1 test sequences, consisting of single functions chosen from Œ¶, and call this Œ¶1. The transition cover is defined as K :=C \\\\cup C \\\\otimes \\\\Phi_{1}. This will attempt every possible transition from every state. For those which succeed, we must validate the destination states. So, the smallest test-set T1 which completely validates the behaviour of a minimal Imp is given by: T_{1} ::=C \\\\otimes W \\\\cup C \\\\otimes \\\\Phi_{1} \\\\otimes W. This formula can be rearranged as: : T_{1} ::=C \\\\otimes\\\\left(\\\\Phi_{0} \\\\cup \\\\Phi_{1}\\\\right) \\\\otimes W, where Œ¶0 is the set containing the empty sequence . If Imp has more states than Spec, the above test-set may not be sufficient to guarantee the conformant behaviour of replicated states in Imp. So, sets of longer test sequences are chosen, consisting of all pairs of functions Œ¶2, all triples of functions Œ¶3 up to some limit Œ¶k, when the tester is satisfied that Imp cannot contain chains of duplicated states longer than k-1. The final test formula is given by: : T_{\\\\mathrm{k}} ::=C \\\\otimes\\\\left(\\\\Phi_{0} \\\\cup \\\\Phi_{1} \\\\ldots \\\\cup \\\\Phi_{\\\\mathrm{k}}\\\\right) \\\\otimes W. This test-set completely validates the behaviour of a non-minimal Imp in which chains of duplicated states are expected to be no longer than k-1. For most practical purposes, testing up to k=2, or k=3 is quite exhaustive, revealing all state-related faults in really poor implementations.

During Angola's civil war, Cuban forces fought alongside the Marxist‚ÄìLeninist People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) government; against the Western-backed National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) and National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA) guerrillas who were aided by the South-African army. The present day outcome of the war resulted in the MPLA changing from a Marxist‚ÄìLeninist party to a multi-party democratic system based on Neoliberal principles (the MPLA also dropped the \\"Labour Party\\" extension to its name as a clear sign of dropping their Communist aspirations). From an economic stand point, Cuba has lost its preferred status among Angolans and South Africa has become the biggest single investor and trading partner with Angola (outside oil sales). Pedro Rosso Leal is the current ambassador of Cuba to Angola. History =1960s= Cuba's relationship with Angola started in the 1960s as part of the \\"Second Revolution\\" movement announced by Fidel Castro. The movement intended to bring Marxism‚ÄìLeninism to Africa starting primarily in Zaire (today known as the Democratic Republic of the Congo). The failed attempt to make a foothold in the Zaire presented various lessons to Cuba which were used in identifying better candidate nations, leaders and better opportunities for success. Jonas Savimbi, the future President of UNITA, met with Fidel Castro's ally and revolutionary Che Guevara in 1965. Guevara told his superiors he did not trust Savimbi, and Savimbi possibly presented a danger. This was probably linked to the fact that Savimbi did not have any notable aspirations towards Marxism‚ÄìLeninism. However, to Cuba's surprise, Agostinho Neto (the then leader of the MPLA) had a very strong Marxist leaning which suited the Cuban agenda. In the 1960s Cuba mobilized a task force to assist Agostinho Neto to build an army and carry out a terror campaign against the Portuguese colonial masters with the intent of gaining independence and installing a Marxist state. =1975= In 1975, in response to the demands of the Carnation Revolution, Portugal decided to pull out of its African colonies. By this time Cuba had already infiltrated and commenced large scale activities in the Portuguese colonies of Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique and Angola. Of these African colonies, Angola has vast amounts of oil and an abundance of other natural resources. Given that the 1970s became the awakening of the oil age and knowing that Angola's large oil reserves would serve well to make it a rich and strong backer of a Marxist expansion, Cuba focused on primarily supporting Angolan Marxist rebel movements over the liberation movements of other Portuguese colonies, thus beginning the special relationship between Cuba and Angola. Portugal set Angola's independence date for 11 November 1975. Three prominent liberation movements contended for the role of leading the newly formed independent country, namely: UNITA, FNLA and the MPLA. Each of the three movements received foreign assistance, UNITA from western countries, FNLA from China (and later from the West) and MPLA from the Soviets and Cuba. Although many exhaustive attempts were made (by Portugal) to get the three movements to agree to a peaceful democratic system of power sharing (with multi-party democracy), the specter of being the sole ruler of Angola seemed to undermine any peaceful solution. Cuba added to the failure of the Alvor Accord (to bring the three parties together) by inducing MPLA to believe that with Cuba's backing they could dominate any military confrontation and win Angola's rule. With the failure of the Alvor Accord, the stage was set for a high-noon shoot-out among the three parties in a win-all competition. The victor would become the all mighty leader of Angola. It seemed a foregone conclusion that the party who held control over Luanda (the capital city) on 11 November 1975 would be recognized as the governing party. This put the MPLA (who had a base following in Luanda) at a natural advantage. The other two parties then sought foreign military assistance to take on the Cuban-backed MPLA and make an attempt to gain control of Luanda. Castro dismissed the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the heads of Cuba's Revolutionary Armed Forces (MINFAR) and the Air Force between August 20 and September 5 so they could put all their energy into planning and orchestrating Cuba's invasion of Angola. The Soviets, aware of Castro's plans, opposed Castro's invasion plans (as the Soviets correctly believed the Cubans could set off greater discord in the cold war d√©tente) but stood by him. Castro asked Leonid Brezhnev for staff officers to train People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola (FAPLA) fighters and transportation for Cuban soldiers, requests the USSR ignored. The Soviets did send military advisers to council MPLA leaders in Brazzaville. The Cuban government gave the MPLA 12,000 M-52 rifles from Czechoslovakia, 133 RPGs from Bulgaria, mortars, light artillery, and machine guns. Cuba's leaders appointed Ra√∫l Diaz Arg√ºelles as commander of the Cuban Military Mission in Angola. Arg√ºelles, subordinate to General Abelardo Colom Ibarra, the First Deputy Minister of the FAR, traveled with 480 soldiers from Cuba to Lisbon, Portugal and then to Luanda. They escaped detection, arriving on August 21, by posing as tourists. None of them carried weapons. Many carried luggage packed with cash. The intense effort by the Cubans made the MPLA the leading military power. Seeing the mass of Soviet-made military weapons arriving in Angola (destined for Cuban forces and MPLA cadres), Savimbi made a desperate appeal to the West for assistance. The USA Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) had been tracking the Communist build-up in Angola and understood the gravity of the situation. Although the CIA wanted to intervene in a large scale, the USA laws (Clark Amendment) severely restricted the CIA intervention in undeclared wars. The CIA attempted to circumvent their own legislation and employed a limited number of mercenaries engaged in Angola. The CIA also turned to South Africa (at the time an apartheid state) for assistance in response to the Cuban build-up. South Africa had invested in the Caluque Hydro Scheme in Southern Angola (which fed into Namibia) and had a natural fear of the effects of instability in Angola ‚Äì thus South Africa initially sent troops to protect the Hydro Scheme (and later intervened in the civil war). The government of the Soviet Union, well aware of South African activity in southern Angola, flew Cuban soldiers into Luanda one week before November 11, the declared date of independence. While Cuban officers led the mission and provided the bulk of the troop force, 60 Soviet officers in the Congo joined the Cubans on November 12. The Soviet leadership expressly forbade the Cubans from intervening in Angola's civil war, focusing the mission on containing South Africa. Cuba ignored Soviet pleas and undertook a full large-scale invasion with a staggering 35,000 troops landing in Angola at the peak of their invasion. In 1975 and 1976 most foreign forces, with the exception of Cuba, withdrew. The last elements of the Portuguese military withdrew in 1975. The USA found themselves in a political impasse with internal government support and discord over the Angola issue (of which Cuba and the USSR took advantage). Eventually in February 1976 the Tunney Amendment passed forbidding the US from participating in Angola. Without US official support the South African military commenced their withdrawal in February 1976. On the other hand, Cuba's troop force in Angola increased from 5,500 in December 1975 to 11,000 in February 1976. FNLA forces were crushed by Operation Carlota, a joint Cuban‚ÄìAngolan attack on Huambo on January 30, 1976.Angola Reds on Outskirts of Pro-Western capital city, January 30, 1976. The Argus, page 10, via NewspaperArchive.com. By mid-November, the Huambo government had gained control over southern Angola and began pushing north. =1977= Angolan government and Cuban troops had control over all southern cities by 1977, but roads in the south faced repeated UNITA attacks. Savimbi expressed his willingness for rapprochement with the MPLA and the formation of a unity, socialist government, but he insisted on Cuban withdrawal first. \\"The real enemy is Cuban colonialism,\\" Savimbi told reporters, warning, \\"The Cubans have taken over the country, but sooner or later they will suffer their own Vietnam in Angola.\\" Government and Cuban troops used flame throwers, bulldozers, and planes with napalm to destroy villages in a area along the Angola-Namibia border. Only women and children passed through this area, \\"Castro Corridor,\\" because government troops had shot all males ten years of age or older to prevent them from joining the UNITA. The napalm killed cattle to feed government troops and to retaliate against UNITA sympathizers. Angolans fled from their homeland; 10,000 going south to Namibia and 16,000 east to Zambia, where they lived in refugee camps. Foreign Secretary Lord Carrington of the United Kingdom expressed similar concerns over British involvement in Rhodesia's Bush War during the Lancaster House negotiations in 1980. =Shaba invasions= Shaba Province, Zaire. 1,500 members of the Front for the National Liberation of the Congo (FNLC) invaded Shaba, Zaire from eastern Angola on March 7, 1977. The FNLC wanted to overthrow Mobutu and the Angolan government, suffering from Mobutu's support for the FNLA and UNITA, did not try to stop the invasion. The FNLC failed to capture Kolwezi, Zaire's economic heartland, but took Kasaji, and Mutshatsha. Zairian troops were defeated without difficulty and the FNLC continued to advance. Mobutu appealed to William Eteki of Cameroon, Chairman of the Organization of African Unity, for assistance on April 2. Eight days later, the French government responded to Mobutu's plea and airlifted 1,500 Moroccan troops into Kinshasa. This troop force worked in conjunction with the Zairian army and the FNLA of Angola with air cover from Egyptian pilots flying French Mirage fighter aircraft to beat back the FNLC. The counter-invasion force pushed the last of the militants, along with a number of refugees, into Angola and Zambia in April. Mobutu accused the Angolan government, as well as the Cuban and Soviet governments, of complicity in the war. While Neto did support the FNLC, the Angolan government's support came in response to Mobutu's continued support for Angola's anti-Communists. The Carter Administration, unconvinced of Cuban involvement, responded by offering a meager $15 million-worth of non-military aid. American timidity during the war prompted a shift in Zaire's foreign policy from the U.S. to France, which became Zaire's largest supplier of arms after the intervention. Neto and Mobutu signed a border agreement on July 22, 1977. =Nitista revolt= Neto's Interior Minister, Nito Alves, had successfully put down Daniel Chipenda's Eastern Revolt and the Active Revolt during Angola's War of Independence. Factionalism within the MPLA became a major challenge to Neto's power by late 1975 and he gave Alves the task of once again clamping down on dissension. Alves shut down the Cabral and Henda Committees while expanding his influence within the MPLA through his control of the nation's newspapers and state-run television. Alves visited the Soviet Union in October 1976. When he returned, Neto began taking steps to neutralize the threat he saw in the Nitistas, followers of Alves. Ten armored cars with the FAPLA's 8th Brigade broke into S√£o Paulo prison at 4 a.m. on May 27, killing the prison warden and freeing more than 150 supporters, including 11 who had been arrested only a few days before. The brigade took control of the radio station in Luanda at 7 a.m. and announced their coup, calling themselves the MPLA Action Committee. The brigade asked citizens to show their support for the coup by demonstrating in front of the presidential palace. The Nitistas captured Bula and Dangereaux, generals loyal to Neto, but Neto had moved his base of operations from the palace to the Ministry of Defence in fear of such an uprising. At the time, Cuba had already in place an agreement with Neto to receive approximately $1,000 per Cuban (in Angola) making the Angolan invasion a very profitable venture for the Cubans. Any upset to this venture would not be tolerated by the Cubans. For this reason in a blatant intervention in domestic affairs of Angola, Cuban troops retook the palace at Neto's request and marched to the radio station. After an hour of fighting, the Cubans succeeded and proceeded to the barracks of the 8th brigade, recaptured by 1:30 p.m. While the Cuban force captured the palace and radio station, the Nitistas kidnapped seven leaders within the government and the military, shooting and killing six.George (2005). Pages 129-131. While Cuban soldiers actively helped Neto put down the coup, Alves and Neto both believed the Soviet Union supported Neto's ouster. Ra√∫l Castro sent an additional four thousand troops to prevent further dissension within the MPLA's ranks and met with Neto in August in a display of solidarity. In contrast, Neto's distrust in the Soviet leadership increased and relations with the USSR worsened. The oil producing exclave of Cabinda (located in Zaire/DRC) was a separate colony of Portugal that was for a short while place the governorship of the Portuguese Angolan Governor. At the time of liberation, Cabinda was lumped into the Angolan custodianship and quickly absorbed by the MPLA as being part of Angola. The self-determination rights of the people of Cabinda a geographically separate nation was ignored by the MPLA and Cuban government. The Popular Movement for the Liberation of Cabinda, a Cabindan separatist rebel group, attacked a Cuban base near Tshiowa on August 11.Kalley (1999). Page 12. The Cuban forces repelled any attacks on the oil fields of Cabinda and placed over 2,000 soldiers guarding oil production facilities owned by American companies creating a stark irony in the Cuban publicized propaganda. =1978= UNITA released a communiqu√© from Paris on November 13, 1978, detailing an anti-UNITA attack by 20,000 troops from Portugal, Cuba, Katanga, East Germany, and the MPLA. =1980s= Cuba's relationship with Angola altered, the military command would transfer to the Soviets and the Cubans would focus on a more humanitarian and infrastructure program. During this time period Cuba implemented some impressive assistance to the MPLA in setting the foundation for a true Marxist state with Communist values. The Cubans brought over doctors, teachers and engineers. Cuban medical assistance was so great that Spanish became known as the language of medicine in Angola. This key aspect of Angolan-Cuban relations still lasts to this day. Besides providing teachers to Angola, Cuba also provided bursaries for Angolans to study at Cuban universities. A clear positive and good intention was shown by Cuba in the sectors of medicine and health. Unfortunately Cuban intervention in the other sectors (agriculture and civil infrastructure) was undermined by the Marxist ideals and Cuban experiments. Cuban sugarcane is bigger and has a higher yield than Angolan sugarcane. Based on this simple principle, Cuba exterminated all Angolan sugarcane and substituted it with the 'better' Cuban sugarcane. Unfortunately, the Cuban sugarcane did not adapt to the Angolan environment and failed. It a fell swoop, Cuba had wiped out all Angolan sugarcane. With the Angolan sugarcane industry decimated, Cuba cannibalized the Angolan sugarcane mills and took the parts back to Cuba. Cuba built many houses as part of a widespread housing program using an industrialized construction technique that was also experimental and turned to failure. Today, Angolans refer to the dilapidated houses as the \\"Cuban Cages\\". The accumulation of small incidents began to strain the relationship between Cuba and Angola: Cuban forces were to be seen as the saviors of Angola and were given special privileges over Angolans. Privileges which the Cubans appear to have abused. Any minor dispute would normally be resolved in favour of the Cubans, and a growing sense that Angolans were second class citizens in their own country raised resentment. After all the Angolans originally fought to gain liberation from the Portuguese colonials only to be subjected to a Cuban system of discrimination. Probably the biggest downfall in the relation between Angola and Cuba (during this period) was the systematic plundering of Angolan property by the Cubans. Under the Marxist principle all property belonged to the state. As an example, under the definition of 'all property' domestic cars that one would normally believe to belong to individuals now belong to the state. However, due to the conflict and social upheavals many Portuguese citizens fled Angola, abandoning their cars. Many high ranking Cuban soldiers came across these abandoned cars and helped themselves to them. Senior Angolan officials were insulted to find many Angolan cars with Angolan license plates driving the streets of Havana. Many similar incidents such as the Cuban plundering of rare woods in Cabinda began to show strain in the relationship between Angola and Cuba. The relationship between Angola, Cuba and the Soviet Union was ironically heavily funded by sales of oil to capitalistic countries. Both the Soviet Union and Angola were large scale exporters of oil providing funds for the various Cuban initiatives. During the years 1984 to 1988 the world price of oil tumbled (eventually leading to the collapse of the Soviet Union) and Angola's ability to fund Cuban ventures was severely cut to the point that Angola could no longer afford to pay for any foreign assistance and went into debt. With no money to go around and internal strains between the Angolans and Cubans, by the mid to late 1980s the bi- lateral relationship changed dramatically. For Cuba there were no longer any revenues from Angola but instead a very expensive operation of funding a military and civilian force in Angola. Cuba was also suffering their own hardships based on a command economy that had systematically become too expensive to run. Although the two sides still had a respectful relationship the soon departure of the Cuban occupiers was a foregone conclusion. The imminent collapse of the Soviet Union lead to a desperate attempt to severely weaken the military foes in preparation for the MPLA to 'go it alone'. Under the leadership of the Soviet General, in late 1987 an attack was planned to break the back of UNITA. The attack would be launched from Cuito Cuanavale and make a move on UNITA's stronghold of Mavinga. The Cuban military correctly raised concern on the whole attack process as the Cubans had made a similar attempt in 1985 when the South African forces intervened and the entire attack turned into a disastrous failure. Nonetheless, the attack proceeded and as in 1985, the South Africans intervened and the attack was again a disastrous failure with the MPLA/Soviet troops being halted at the Lomba river by the South Africans. It was at the battle at the Lomba river that MPLA realized that impending departure of both the Cubans and Soviets would leave them alone and severely weakened. The MPLA decided to enter negotiations with the prime objective of getting the South Africans out of Angola and hopefully battle UNITA without foreign intervention. In a number of follow-up battles, the South African and UNITA troops drove the MPLA/Soviet troops back to Cuito Cuanavale and besieged the town of Cuito Cuanavale. Fidel Castro realized that his dream of having Angola as a strong Marxist state in Africa and a spring board to spread Marxism in Africa would quickly evaporate if he did not lend assistance to MPLA. Castro reacted in support of the MPLA by sending 35,000 troops to the Cuito Cuanavale stage. However, peace negotiations had progressed and Cuba needed to become a participant in the negotiations to ensure at least a form of honourable departure from Angola. With Cuban presence at the table, the negotiations became known as the \\"Tripartite Accord\\". Cuba attempted to break the siege of Cuito Cuanavale but found that the South African G5 Howitzer gun had created havoc, severely disrupting the supply route to Cuito (the supply route became known as the \\"Road of Death\\"). Castro turned his troops southward and made a direct advance on the Namibian border in an attempt of a last honourable attack. Again the South African G5 gun was used to terrifying results halting the advance. Without consulting the MPLA and the Soviets, Castro launched his MiG fighter jets, initially trying to remove the G5 guns, but on the same flight, they turned and attacked the Caluque hydro scheme. This attack almost undermined the peace negotiations and again strained the relationship between Cuba and Angola (and the Soviet Union). Soon after the negotiations and the accord was reached, Cuba implemented their prescribed program of removing their troops from Angola which was completed by May 1991. Although Cuba bargained hard for various concessions, related to the Angola situation there were some instrumental points that Cuba conceded: # Their support for the (then) Marxist-leaning African National Congress (ANC) would stop. # UNITA would be allowed to get support from the US after the process was complete. Cuba also had to concede on certain points pertaining to Namibia and South Africa (which are not part of this topic). The two concession points made by Cuba and the MPLA allowed South Africa to deal with the ANC in its own way and allowed the US to continue support to UNITA in producing a power shift once the foreign forces had left Angola. =Post-Peace Accord relationship= With the Peace Accord complete, the South African forces withdrew from Angola and went about enacting the democratic hand over of Namibia. Cuba withdrew all its troops and now faced the full brunt of the collapse of the Soviet Union. Having focused so much of its finite resources to the Second Revolution primarily in Africa with the main focus on Angola, Cuba's own economy was in a state of tatters. ;For Cuba With no revenue from the Soviets and no revenue from Angola, Cuba's economy imploded and Cuba entered, what Fidel Castro called the \\"Special Period in Peace Time\\" and a 34% drop in their GDP. ;For Angola Initially with Cuba, the Soviets and South Africa out of Angola, the MPLA thought they could use the left over advanced Soviet Military equipment and deliver the final blow to UNITA on their own. None of the parties contended with the USA providing support to UNITA, causing a power shift. This time the MPLA no longer had a major backer, they faced a military impasse and a world where multi-party democracy with Capitalistic economies were showing success. The MPLA realized that a new political and economic vision was needed to answer both their military woes and their economic aspirations. At the third congress of the People the MPLA decided that the Marxist‚ÄìLeninist policy had brought more suffering than relief and was dropped. The MPLA changed their course and opened the door for a multi-party democracy based on a capitalistic economy. Renewed peace negotiations were held with UNITA which this time lead to an election. However following the Halloween Massacre UNITA rejected the election results and turned to arms. UNITA and other opposition parties claimed the elections were rigged. However this time the USA did not support UNITA and both parties returned to war. The MPLA did not turn to Cuba for renewed assistance but in a twist of irony, the MPLA government employed the services of a South African mercenary group \\"Executive Outcomes\\" to help fight UNITA. The MPLA as an elected government fully recognized in the entire international community teamed up with military forces from their previous foe to oust UNITA. With superior training and bushwar tactics from the South Africans coupled with the impressive Soviet military weaponry still in stock, the MPLA were able to eventually drive UNITA back. The eventual defection of one of Savimbi's senior generals also helped to corner and eradicate Savimbi. References Further reading * Gleijeses, Piero. \\"Moscow's Proxy?

A member of the Salesians, he was the first member of that order to become a bishop and the first to be made a cardinal. Biography Cagliero was born in Castelnuovo d'Asti on 11 January 1838 and studied at its seminary and later the University of Turin. He entered the Pious Society of St. Francis de Sales, more commonly known as the Salesians, in 1851. He received the clerical habit from St. John Bosco himself and was reputed to be his favorite pupil. Cagliero was also a classmate of St Dominic Savio and Bl. Michael Rua. He was ordained to the priesthood on 14 June 1862, and then taught at the Salesian House of Studies in Turin until 1875. Cagliero led the first ten Salesians to America and established five houses in Uruguay and Argentina between 1875 and 1877, after which he became spiritual director of his society and the first General Director of Daughters of Mary Help of Christians in Turin. He was made Pro- Apostolic Vicar of new vicariate in Northern Patagonia, in Argentina, on 20 November 1883. On 30 October 1884, Cagliero was appointed Titular Bishop of Magydus by Pope Leo XIII, receiving his episcopal consecration on the following December 7 from Cardinal Gaetano Alimonda. After being promoted to Titular Archbishop of Sebastea on 24 March 1904, he served as Apostolic Visitor to the dioceses of Bobbio, Piacenza, Savona, and Tortona in 1904. Cagliero was named Apostolic Delegate to Costa Rica on 10 June 1908, to Honduras on 19 December, and to Nicaragua on 26 December. Pope Benedict XV made him Cardinal-Priest of San Bernardo alle Terme in the consistory of 6 December 1915. Cagliero opted for the order of Cardinal-Bishop and assumed the suburbicarian see of Frascati on 16 December 1920. He was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 1922 papal conclave, which elected Pope Pius XI. Cardinal Cagliero died in Rome in 28 February 1926 at the age of 88. He was initially buried in the sepulchre of the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith in Campo Verano cemetery, but his remains were transferred in 1964 to Mater Misericordiae Cathedral in Viedma.

Globensky (November 15, 1830 ‚Äì February 12, 1906) was a writer and politician. C.A.M. Globensky was the grandson of August Franz Globensky, a Polish surgeon who fought alongside Hessian mercenaries for the British during the American Revolutionary war, settling in Verch√®res, Quebec, and the son of Lieutenant-Colonel Maximilien Globensky. Career He was born in Saint-Eustache, Lower Canada and was educated at the Seminaire de Ste-Therese and the College de Montreal. Globensky was seigneur of Milles-Isles. An expert in agriculture, C.A.M. Globensky published a number of articles on the subject and was president of the Agricultural Society of Two Mountains. In 1854, he married Virginia Marguerite Dumont. In 1868 and 1869 he wrote a series of articles on the development of railways in Quebec. Beginning in 1873, he published widely read political articles in Le Monde and La Minerve. In 1883 he published a book, La R√©bellion de 1837 √† Saint-Eustache, dedicated to defending the memory of his father against accusations of not supporting the Patriotes in the 1837 Rebellion as well as providing a political analysis of the uprising. In an 1875 by-election, he sought a seat in the House of Commons of Canada as an Independent representing Two Mountains. During the election campaign, the loyalist sympathies of his family were the subject of debate, but he was elected nevertheless. Disliking politics, he resigned his office the following year. In 1888 he was offered a seat in the Senate of Canada but declined. Globensky also served as mayor of Saint-Eustache. He died in Saint-Eustache at the age of 75. Today, his home located at 233 rue Saint-Eustache in Saint- Eustache, Quebec, is home to a museum displaying information about and relics from the Battle of Saint-Eustache in 1837.

The canal was completed in 1949 and is currently operated by the Coachella Valley Water District. Construction of the Coachella Canal began in the 1930s by the Six Companies, Inc., but was interrupted by World War II. After the war, work was resumed on the canal and deliveries of water began in the late 1940s. The canal was mostly earth-lined when it was first constructed, except for the last 38 miles, which were concrete-lined. Today, most of the canal is lined with concrete to prevent water loss from seepage. Grass eating fish are stocked in the canal to prevent water loss to aquatic vegetation.

Background Marchi is tall and weighs 198 lb. He is from Leme, S√£o Paulo and is of Italian descent on his father's side. He currently resides in Ferris, Texas, US. He rode his bulls right-handed. His special interests include soccer, team roping, and surfing. He also enjoys hanging out with fellow Brazilian riders such as Alex Marcillio and Robson Aragao. Career He debuted late in the 2004 Built Ford Tough Series (BFTS) season, qualifying for his first-ever PBR World Finals and finishing 41st in the world. After finishing in the runner-up position for the PBR World Championship in three consecutive years, he won his first title in 2008. Statistically, Marchi was one of the most consistent riders on the tour. He qualified for the PBR World Finals all 15 years of his career (2004 to 2018). In 2005, Guilherme Marchi was the biggest threat to Justin McBride‚Äôs dream of being the PBR World Champion. McBride won, Marchi came in second, however, he was the PBR World Finals event winner that year. In 2006, Marchi once again failed to win when fellow Brazilian Adriano Moraes came from behind to claim the PBR World Championship, with Marchi placing second. Yet again, in 2007, Marchi finished the season in the number two position behind Justin McBride at the PBR Finals in Las Vegas. In 2008, he dominated the PBR circuit, riding nearly 75% of his bulls, winning five events, and earning over $1.5 million (nearly three times as much as any other PBR rider) on his way to his first PBR season crown. In March 2014, in the opening round of the Bass Pro Chute Out at Talking Stick Resort Arena in Phoenix, Arizona, Marchi became the first bull rider to successfully complete 500 qualified rides in the PBR, riding 04 Pandora‚Äôs Pyxis. On April 8, 2017, Marchi rode Z61 Shocker for 86.25 points in Round 2 of the Stanley Performance In Action Invitational in Billings, Montana. The ride was on the BFTS tour as usual. In doing so, he became the first PBR rider to reach 600 qualified rides. He received a commemorative Montana Silversmiths belt buckle. On August 12, 2018, Marchi announced that 2018 would be his final year of bull riding, with the intention of retiring after the PBR World Finals. He finished his professional career with 635 qualified rides, the most ever in PBR history, as well as over $5.3 million in career earnings. Retirement Marchi officially retired from bull riding following his victory at the 2018 PBR Brazil event in Goi√¢nia, Goi√°s. Honors On November 5, 2019, Marchi was inducted into the PBR Heroes and Legends Celebration: Ring of Honor. Personal On April 19, 2018, Marchi married long-time girlfriend Maria in Texas.

Early life and family George Pereira was descended from an old Roman Catholic family of Portuguese origins, which had profited in the 19th century from the Chinese trade, notably in Macao. He was eldest of the three sons of Edward Pereira by the Hon. Margaret Anne Stonor, eighth daughter of Thomas Stonor, 3rd Baron Camoys of Stonor Park, Oxfordshire. He was educated at The Oratory School in Edgbaston, where his younger brother Edward Pereira ('E.P.') (1866‚Äì1939) was later principal and benefactor. A third brother was Major General Sir Cecil Pereira (1869‚Äì1942), a distinguished commander in the Second Boer War and the First World War. Soldier George Pereira was commissioned into the Grenadier Guards as a lieutenant on 23 August 1884, and was promoted to captain on 4 November 1896.Hart‚Ä≤s Army list, 1903 Promoted to major on 2 May 1900, he served in China (1900) with the 1st Chinese Regiment, where he received the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for his services during the Boxer Rebellion. In April 1902 he was in charge of bringing to South Africa a reinforcement of 500 officers and men of the Grenadier Guards for the 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the regiment, serving there during the Second Boer War. The war ended shortly after their arrival, in June 1902, and he returned home with other men of the 2nd battalion on the SS Galeka in October 1902. During the First World War, he served on the Western Front as officer commanding the 47th Brigade (from January 1916 to November 1917) and then the 43rd Brigade (1918). He was one of the great characters of the 16th Division. Known to the men as 'Hoppy' because of lameness after a riding accident, he was an irascible fire-eater and firm disciplinarian; characteristics he combined with an obvious concern for the welfare of his men. \\"Every officer and soldier of his brigade swears by him\\", one of his battalion commanders wrote. Explorer Pereira had served as British Military attach√© in Peking from 1905 to 1910 and was fluent in Chinese. He made many adventurous journeys in China and Tibet, frequently travelling thousands of miles on foot. He was the first European to walk from Peking to Lhasa, when he described the Amne Machin massif in eastern Tibet in 1921-2, sometimes reckoned among the great geographical discoveries of the twentieth century. His journey from Yunnan along the Tibetan border in 1923 was his last, as he died of some internal trouble just before reaching Kantze (where he was buried), near Batang, Sichuan, in October 1923. His journals of Chinese exploration were edited shortly after his death. Further extracts from his journals have been published recently (2004‚Äì) in the Guards' Magazine, edited by his great nephew, Edward Pereira.

It was the first peer-to-peer lender to register its offerings as securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and to offer loan trading on a secondary market. At its height, LendingClub was the world's largest peer-to-peer lending platform.Schumpeter Peer review The Economist January 5, 2013; Accessed March 22, 2013. The company claims that $15.98 billion in loans had been originated through its platform up to December 31, 2015. LendingClub enabled borrowers to create unsecured personal loans between $1,000 and $40,000. The standard loan period was three years. Investors were able to search and browse the loan listings on LendingClub website and select loans that they wanted to invest in based on the information supplied about the borrower, amount of loan, loan grade, and loan purpose. Investors made money from the interest on these loans. LendingClub made money by charging borrowers an origination fee and investors a service fee. LendingClub also makes traditional direct to consumer loans, including automobile refinance transactions, through WebBank, an FDIC-insured, state- chartered industrial bank that is headquartered in Salt Lake City Utah. The loans are not funded by investors but are assigned to other financial institutions. The company raised $1 billion in what became the largest technology IPO of 2014 in the United States. Though viewed as a pioneer in the fintech industry and one of the largest such firms, LendingClub experienced problems in early 2016, with difficulties in attracting investors, a scandal over some of the firm's loans and concerns by the board over CEO Renaud Laplanche's disclosures leading to a large drop in its share price and Laplanche's resignation. In 2020, Lending Club acquired Radius Bank and announced that it would be shutting down its peer-to-peer lending platform. Existing account holders will continue to collect interest on existing notes until each loan is paid off or goes into default, but no new loans are available for individual investing. History LendingClub was initially launched on Facebook as one of Facebook's first applications. After receiving $10.26 million in a Series A funding round in August 2007, from venture capital investors Norwest Venture Partners and Canaan Partners, LendingClub was developed into a full-scale peer-to-peer lending company. On April 8, 2008, LendingClub temporarily suspended new lender registration, canceled its affiliate program and entered a \\"quiet period\\" while it awaited approval to issue promissory notes to lenders. On June 20, 2008, LendingClub filed an S-1 statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) seeking the registration of $600 million in \\"Member Payment Dependent Notes\\" to be issued on its Web site. On August 1, 2008, LendingClub filed an amendment to its Form S-1 outlining new interest rate formulas as well as more details on a \\"resale trading system\\". On October 14, 2008, LendingClub announced its completion of the SEC registration process, posted the filed prospectus on its website, and resumed new lender registration. Notes issued on or after October 14, 2008 represent LendingClub securities rather than direct obligations of the ultimate borrower and are tradable (can be bought and sold) on the Foliofn trading platform. In March 2009, LendingClub raised $12 million in a Series B funding round led by Morgenthaler Ventures. =Pre-IPO growth= In April 2010, the company raised $24.5 million in a Series C funding led by Foundation Capital and joined by existing investors including Morgenthaler Ventures, Norwest Venture Partners and Canaan Partners. In August 2011, LendingClub raised an additional $25 million in venture capital from Union Square Ventures and Thomvest, owned by the Thomson family of Thomson-Reuters. This led to LendingClub earning a $275 million post-money valuation and an increase of $80 million in valuation from the preceding year. Thomson-Reuters founder Peter J. Thomson also invested an unspecified amount of his personal fortune into LendingClub. In fall 2011, LendingClub's headquarters moved to downtown San Francisco; its earlier offices were located in Sunnyvale and Redwood City. Co- founder Soul Htite moved to China to start Dianrong.com, a peer-to-peer lending company based in Shanghai. In 2012, the company employed about 80 people, with Renaud Laplanche continuing as the company CEO and chairman of the Board of Directors. The company averaged about $1.5 million in loan originations daily, with a total of $600 million since its founding. In April 2012, LendingClub's SEC registration from 2008 was renewed for $1 billion USD in Member Payment Dependent Notes and became effective on April 10, 2012. In June 2012, the company received $15 million in new funding from Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and $2.5 million of personal investments from John J. Mack. Kleiner Perkins partner Mary Meeker joined Mack on LendingClub's board of directors. This led to a $570 million valuation of the company. In November 2012, LendingClub surpassed $1 billion in loans issued since inception and announced they were now cash flow positive. In May 2013, Google Capital purchased a stake in LendingClub. LendingClub also began partnering with smaller banks in order to help streamline their small loans operations. In June 2013 the company partnered with Titan Bank in Texas and Congressional Bank in Maryland in order to help them facilitate loans that would have been otherwise unprofitable for them.Lending Club CEO on Getting a Loan Without a Bank CNBC March 14, 2013; Accessed March 16, 2103 =Initial public offering (IPO)= In March 2014, LendingClub began providing loans to small businesses. In April 2014 LendingClub acquired Springstone Financial. In May 2014 LendingClub formed a partnership with Union Bank. On August 27, 2014, LendingClub filed for an IPO with the SEC, the offering taking place in December 2014. On December 10, 2014, the company raised almost $900 million in the largest U.S. tech IPO of 2014. The stock ended the first trading day up 56%, valuing the company at $8.5bn. Stevenson Place, San Francisco, the location of LendingClub headquarters =Car loans and mortgages= Laplanche told Forbes in April 2015 that LendingClub would expand into car loans and mortgages. LendingClub also announced a partnership with Google to extend credit to smaller companies that use Google's business services. The company signed partnerships with Google, Alibaba.com, BancAlliance, and HomeAdvisor, including vetting community bank lenders for BancAlliance (a group of 200 banks), in order to send people on its platform to various community finance institutions. That year LendingClub partnered with Opportunity Fund, announced by former President Bill Clinton at the Clinton Global Initiative. The partnership intended to provide $10 million to small businesses in areas of California that are underserved by lenders. LendingClub and other small business lenders partnered with Sam‚Äôs Club to deliver its ‚Äúbusiness lending center‚Äù product. In August 2015 the company created Lending Club Open Integration (LCOI). In October, the company launched a multi-draw line of credit product for small businesses. =Scandal and struggle, 2016-2017= Like other peer-to-peer lenders including Prosper, Sofi, and Khutzpa.com, LendingClub experienced increasing difficulty attracting investors during early 2016. This led the firm to increase the interest rate it charges borrowers on three occasions during the first months of the year. The increase in interest rates and concerns over the impact of the slowing United States economy caused a large drop in LendingClub's share price. In April 2016, a LendingClub employee reported to Laplanche that the dates on approximately $US 3 million in the firm's loans appeared to have been altered. LendingClub's internal auditor engaged an outside firm to investigate the report. This investigation found additional problems with loans, including that $US 22 million in loans which had been sold to the Jefferies investment bank did not in fact meet the bank's investment criteria. LendingClub bought these loans back from the bank and resold them. The New York Times reported that the investigation found that Laplanche had not disclosed to the board that he owned part of an investment fund which LendingClub was considering purchasing. The Wall Street Journal also stated that Laplanche was found to have not fully disclosed what he knew about the problematic loans. On 6 May LendingClub's board made it clear to Laplanche that he no longer had their confidence, leading to his resignation on 9 May. The Wall Street Journal reported that Laplanche had been fired by the board. Three of the firm's other managers had also been fired or had resigned by that time as a result of the problematic loans. LendingClub's stock price fell by a further 34 percent after Laplanche's departure was announced. This placed the stock price at 70 percent of the price at the time of the firm's initial public offering. As a result of the incident, the Securities and Exchange Commission was reported to be investigating LendingClub's disclosures to investors. In December 2017 the Financial Times reported that LendingClub \\"has struggled to overcome the effects of a governance scandal last May\\", and that the firm \\"has battled to keep big investors buying loans\\" despite improvements to its internal governance. These challenges have led it to raise its loss estimate, and have led to further drops in its share price. At this time many other peer to peer lending companies were also experiencing difficulties. =End of P2P platform, 2019-2020= In an interview with Business Insider in December 2019, executive Valerie Kay noted that LendingClub had switched focus to institutional investors as well as its traditional peer-to-peer lending through a new project called \\"Scale\\", focused on delivering representative samples of loans instead of individual loans - labeled its \\"Select\\" program. LendingClub has grown to $10.8 billion in annual loan originations in the year 2018. In April 2020, the company announced it would lay off around one third of its employees in anticipation of the economic downturn resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. In August 2020, the company discontinued its secondary trading platform, hosted by Folio, reducing liquidity for existing peer-to-peer investors. In October 2020, the company ceased all new loan accounts on their website as part of restructuring into a neobank after the acquisition of Radius Bank. As of December 31, 2020, Lending Club will no longer operate as a peer-to-peer lender. Business model =Overview= LendingClub enabled borrowers to create loan listings on its website by supplying details about themselves and the loans that they would like to request. All loans were unsecured personal loans and could be between $1,000 - $40,000. On the basis of the borrower‚Äôs credit score, credit history, desired loan amount and the borrower‚Äôs debt-to- income ratio, LendingClub determined whether the borrower was creditworthy and assigned to its approved loans a credit grade that determined the payable interest rate and fees. The standard loan period was three years; a five-year period was available at a higher interest rate and additional fees. The loans can be repaid at any time without penalty. Only investors in 39 US states were eligible to purchase notes on the LendingClub platform. However, eligibility differs when purchasing notes on the secondary market, FolioFN. Borrowers from all but two US states were eligible to apply for a loan. Investors were able to search and browse the loan listings on LendingClub website and select loans that they wanted to invest in based on the information supplied about the borrower, amount of loan, loan grade, and loan purpose. The loans could only be chosen at the interest rates assigned by LendingClub, but investors could decide how much to fund each borrower, with a minimum investment of $25 per note. Investors make money from interest. Rates vary from 6.03% to 26.06%, depending on the credit grade assigned to the loan request. The grades assigned to these requests ranged alphabetically from A to G, with A being the highest-grade, lowest-interest loan. Each of these letter grades had five finer-grain sub-grades, numbered 1 to 5, with 1 being the highest sub-grade. LendingClub made money by charging borrowers an origination fee and investors a service fee. The size of the origination fee depended on the credit grade and ranges to be 1.1‚Äì5.0% of the loan amount. The size of the service fee was 1% on all amounts the borrower pays. The company facilitates interest rates that are better for lenders and borrowers than they would receive from most banks. It averaged between a six and nine percent return to investors between its founding and 2013. However, because lenders are making personal loans to individuals on the site, their gains are taxable as personal income instead of investment income. Therefore, income from LendingClub loans may be taxed at a higher rate than investments that are taxed at the capital gains rate. =Loan ownership= After the notes were issued, LendingClub purchased the loans from the issuing bank and notes became the obligations of LendingClub, and not of the ultimate borrower: LendingClub has promised to pay the noteholder monies it receives from the borrower less its service fees, while the holders of LendingClub notes have the status of unsecured creditors of LendingClub. This means that there is a risk that the investor may lose all or part of the investment if LendingClub becomes insolvent or declares bankruptcy, even if the ultimate borrower continues to pay. Until August 2020, investors had the ability to put notes up for sale before the notes have reached maturity. This service was offered in a partnership with FOLIOfn Investments which charged a 1% fee on note sales, making LendingClub the first peer-to-peer lending network to offer a secondary market for peer-to-peer loans. Other peer-to-peer lending networks, such as Khutzpa.com, subsequently also partnered with FOLIOfn Investments to offer a secondary market. Effective August 28, 2020, the secondary market for trading Lending Club notes was discontinued. As of 2016, a high proportion of funds for LendingClub-facilitated loans came from hedge funds. During May of that year, LendingClub was seeking to sell hundreds of millions of dollars worth of loans as bonds as part of a strategy to overcome difficulties in accessing sufficient funding. = Credit risk = When initially founded, LendingClub positioned itself as a social networking service and set up opportunities for members to identify group affinities, based on a theory that borrowers would be less likely to default to lenders with whom they had affinities and social relationships. It developed an algorithm called LendingMatch for identifying common relationship factors such as geographic location, educational and professional background, and connectedness within a given social network. After registering with the SEC, LendingClub stopped presenting itself as a social network and maintaining that social affinity will necessarily reduce the defaulting risk. It now presents the algorithm just as a search tool for investors to find Notes they would like to purchase, using borrower and loan attributes such as the length of a loan term, target weighted average interest rate, borrower credit score, employment tenure, homeownership status, and others. To reduce default risk, LendingClub focuses on high-credit-worthy borrowers, declining approximately 90% of the loan applications it received as of 2012 and assigning higher interest rates to riskier borrowers within its credit criteria. Only borrowers with FICO score of 660 or higher can be approved for loans. The statistics on LendingClub's website state that, as of December 31, 2016, 62.3 percent of borrowers report using their loans to refinance other loans or pay credit card debt. = Loan performance statistics = As of June 30, 2015, the average LendingClub borrower has a FICO score of 699, 17.7% debt-to-income ratio (excluding mortgage), 16.2 years of credit history, $73,945 of personal income and takes out an average loan of $14,553 that s/he uses for debt consolidation or for paying off credit card debts. The investors had funded $11,217,348,156 in loans, with $1,911,759,192 coming from Q2 2015. The nominal average interest rate is 14.08%, default rate 3.39%, and an average net annualized return (net of defaults and service fees) of 8.93%.Earn Solid Returns Lending Club; Accessed March 22, 2013 The average returns of investment for LendingClub lenders are between 5.47% and 10.22%, with 23 straight quarters of positive returns as of the second quarter of 2013. Recognition In 2011 and 2012 the company was named to as one of the AlwaysOn Global 250. LendingClub is the winner of the World Economic Forum 2012 Technology Pioneer Award.

She was his partner in these enterprises and in other activities.Denis Herbstein, Dame Diana Collins, The Guardian, 2 June 2003. She was born at Stutton Hall, Suffolk. She gave up reading English at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, to marry Collins, then Dean of Oriel College and later Chairman of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. Years of activism In 1940, her husband joined the RAF as a chaplain. In 1946 the Collins' convened a public meeting at Oxford Town Hall, calling for Christians to involve themselves in social and political action. This led directly to the formation of Christian Action, with John Collins as the chairman. Diana Collins edited Christian Action's journal. The Collins' friends included Sir Stafford Cripps, Bishop Trevor Huddleston, the Lord Chancellor, Gerald Gardiner, Victor Gollancz, J.B. Priestley, Jacquetta Hawkes, Bertrand Russell and Oliver Tambo. All were active in the anti-capital punishment, anti-nuclear proliferation, anti-apartheid and other progressive causes. They launched the Defence and Aid Fund to support black South Africans. Diana Collins travelled incognito to South Africa when her husband was banned from entering that country. The Collins' raised large sums of money for the legal defense of their causes by the best barristers, including the defence of Nelson Mandela at the Rivonia trial. Following her husband's death in 1982, Collins became a trustee of the International Defence and Aid Fund for Southern Africa until 1991, and remained on the Council of Christian Action.

Discovered during the Palomar‚ÄìLeiden survey at Palomar in 1960, it was later named after the warrior Thersites from Greek mythology. The presumed carbonaceous C-type asteroid belongs to the 50 largest Jupiter trojans and has a rotation period of 10.48 hours.  Discovery  Thersites was discovered on 24 September 1960, by Dutch astronomer couple Ingrid and Cornelis van Houten at Leiden, on photographic plates taken by Tom Gehrels at the Palomar Observatory in California. On the same day, the group discovered another Jupiter trojan, 1869 Philoctetes. The body's observation arc begins with a precovery taken at Palomar in March 1954, more than 6 years prior to its official discovery observation. = Palomar‚ÄìLeiden survey = The provisional survey designation \\"P-L\\" stands for Palomar‚ÄìLeiden, named after the Palomar and Leiden observatories, which collaborated on the fruitful Palomar‚ÄìLeiden survey in the 1960s and 1970s. Gehrels used Palomar's Samuel Oschin telescope, also known as the 48-inch Schmidt Telescope, and shipped the photographic plates to Cornelis and Ingrid van Houten at Leiden Observatory, where astrometry was carried out. The trio are credited with the discovery of several thousand minor planets.  Orbit and classification  Thersites is a dark Jovian asteroid orbiting in the leading Greek camp at Jupiter's Lagrangian point, 60¬∞ ahead of the Gas Giant's orbit in a 1:1 resonance (see Trojans in astronomy). It is also a non-family asteroid in the Jovian background population. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 4.7‚Äì5.9 AU once every 12 years and 3 months (4,478 days; semi-major axis of 5.32 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.11 and an inclination of 17¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic.  Physical characteristics  The Trojan asteroid has been assumed to be a carbonaceous C-type asteroid. = Rotation period = In July 1994, a first rotational lightcurve of Thersites was obtained from photometric observations by Italian astronomer Stefano Mottola using the former Dutch 0.9-metre Telescope at ESO's La Silla Observatory in northern Chile. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of hours with a brightness variation of magnitude (). The best-rated lightcurve by Robert Stephens at the Center for Solar System Studies from June 2016 gave a period of 10.48 hours and an amplitude of 0.27 magnitude (). Follow-up observation in 2017 gave a similar period of 10.412 hours (). = Diameter and albedo = According to the space-based surveys carried out by the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Thersites has a low albedo of 0.055 and measures 78.9 and 68.2 kilometers in diameter, respectively. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for a carbonaceous asteroid of 0.057, and calculates an intermediate diameter of 70.08 kilometers with an absolute magnitude of 9.5.  Naming  This minor planet was named from Greek mythology after Thersites, a Greek warrior who wanted to abandon Troy's siege during the Trojan War and head home. The given name also refers to the fact, that the asteroid was discovered farthest from the Lagrangian point. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 1 June 1975 ().

Biography McAlister was born in Los Angeles, California, and started her acting career at the early age of 6, starring opposite Edna Mayo and William Burns in the 1915 film Despair. As a child actor she would star in thirty six films by the time she reached the age of 18. Her best known film during that time would be her lead role in Sadie Goes to Heaven, which also starred Russell McDermott and Jenny St. George, which was St. George's first and only film role. In 1927 she was one of thirteen girls selected as \\"WAMPAS Baby Stars\\", alongside Sally Phipps, Martha Sleeper and Frances Lee, among others. The following year, in 1928, she would star in four films, the last of which would be Loves of an Actress, starring Rudolph Valentino's former lover Pola Negri. In 1929 her career took a downward turn, and she had no roles that year. With the advent of \\"talking films\\", her transition was not successful. She had a minor supporting role in the 1930 film On the Level, starring Victor McLaglen, and that same year she had an uncredited role in Madam Satan, which would be her last. After fifteen years in the business as an actress and a total of 43 films to her credit, her career was over at the age of 21. She eventually settled in Del Mar, California, where she was living at the time of her death on May 1, 1991, aged 82.

It was discovered on September 24, 1960, by the Dutch and Dutch‚ÄìAmerican astronomers Cornelis van Houten, Ingrid van Houten- Groeneveld and Tom Gehrels at Palomar Observatory on Palomar Mountain, California. The asteroid was named after Philoctetes from Greek mythology. On the same night, the same group also discovered 1868 Thersites.  Orbit and classification  Philoctetes orbits in the Lagrangian point of the Sun‚ÄìJupiter system, in the \\"Greek Camp\\" of Trojan asteroids. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 4.9‚Äì5.6 AU once every 11 years and 11 months (4,353 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.07 and an inclination of 4¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic.  Physical characteristics  According to the survey carried out by NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, Philoctetes measures 22.7 kilometers in diameter, and its surface has an albedo of 0.104. As of 2017, the body's rotation period and shape remain unknown.  Survey designation  The survey designation P-L stands for Palomar‚ÄìLeiden, named after Palomar Observatory and Leiden Observatory, which collaborated on the fruitful Palomar‚ÄìLeiden survey in the 1960s. Gehrels used Palomar's Samuel Oschin telescope (also known as the 48-inch Schmidt Telescope), and shipped the photographic plates to Cornelis Johannes van Houten and Ingrid van Houten-Groeneveld at Leiden Observatory. The trio are credited with several thousand asteroid discoveries.  Naming  This minor planet was named after the Greek mythological figure Philoctetes, famed archer and participant in the Trojan War, where he killed Paris, son of the Trojan King Priam.

The dark Jovian asteroid has a rotation period of 16.4 hours and belongs to the 100 largest Jupiter trojans. It was named after Stentor from Greek mythology, a Herald of the Greeks during the Trojan War.  Orbit and classification  Stentor is a Jovian asteroid orbiting in the leading Greek camp at Jupiter's Lagrangian point, 60¬∞ ahead of the gas giant's orbit in a 1:1 resonance . It is a non- family asteroid in the Jovian background population. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 4.7‚Äì5.7 AU once every 11 years and 10 months (4,327 days; semi- major axis of 5.2 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.10 and an inclination of 39¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with its official discovery observation at La Silla in October 1976.  Physical characteristics  Stentor is an assumed C-type asteroid. = Rotation period = In June 2016, a rotational lightcurve of Stentor was obtained from photometric observations by Brian Warner at the Center for Solar System Studies (CS3) in California. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.10 magnitude (). An alternative period solution (1:1.5 alias of 24.88 was also obtained. Stentor was previously observed at CS3 by Daniel Coley and Robert Stephens in February 2013, gave an alternative period solution of hours with an amplitude of 0.09 magnitude. This approximately a 1:2 alias is now superseded by the shorter period above (). = Diameter and albedo = According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Stentor measures 50.76 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo 0.082, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for a carbonaceous asteroid of 0.057 and calculates a diameter of 58.29 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 9.9.

He was the first black Olympic athlete from Canada, competing in the 1912 Summer Olympics. Howard was born in the United States to Robert and Cornelia Howard. He came to Winnipeg in 1907 with his father. In addition to his domination of Canadian sprinting, he also played baseball as a catcher on the Crescent Creamery Baseball Club in Winnipeg. He was cited by major Canadian media as Canada's best gold medal hope for the 1912 Olympics. During training for the Olympics, he ran into conflicts with chief coach Walter Knox; according to the Manitoba Free Press of June 27, 1912, Knox accused Howard of insubordination, and, in an era when discrimination against black athletes was common, threatened to expel him from the team. The efforts of the Amateur Athletic Union of Canada kept Howard on the team. In the Olympics in Stockholm, he was hindered by a stomach ailment and stress resulting from discord with coach Knox, and was eliminated in the semi-finals of the 100 metres competition as well as of the 200 metres event. He was also a member of the Canadian relay teams which were eliminated in the semi-final of the 4x100 metre relay competition and in the first round of the 4x400 metre relay event. During World War I, he served as a sapper with the Canadian Railway Troops, then transferred to the 11th and 18th Canadian Reserve Battalions and later served with the Canadian Army Medical Corps, most likely as a stretcher-bearer. He competed in the 1919 Inter-Allied Games held in Paris where he won the bronze medal in the 100 metres race. He returned to Canada about two years after going to Europe with a white English wife, Edith (n√©e Lipscomb). They homesteaded in Ste. Rose du Lac, north of Winnipeg, but were forced to leave by hostility to the interracial marriage. Howard found work as a railway porter. Later, the marriage broke up. He is the grandfather of Olympic sprinters Harry Jerome and Valerie Jerome.

It was discovered on 24 October 1976, by Danish astronomer Richard Martin West at ESO's La Silla Observatory in northern Chile. The dark Jovian asteroid is the principal body of the proposed Epeios family and was named after Epeius from Greek mythology.  Orbit and classification  Epeios is a Jupiter trojan in a 1:1 orbital resonance with Jupiter. It is located in the leading Greek camp at the Gas Giant's Lagrangian point, 60¬∞ ahead on its orbit . It orbits the Sun at a distance of 4.9‚Äì5.5 AU once every 11 years and 11 months (4,350 days; semi-major axis of 5.22 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.06 and an inclination of 9¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with its official discovery observation at La Silla in October 1976. = Epeios family = Fernando Roig and Ricardo Gil- Hutton identified Epeios as the principal body of a small Jovian asteroid family, using the hierarchical clustering method (HCM), which looks for groupings of neighboring asteroids based on the smallest distances between them in the proper orbital element space. According to the astronomers, the Epeios family belongs to the larger Menelaus clan, an aggregation of Jupiter trojans which is composed of several families, similar to the Flora family in the inner asteroid belt. However this family is not included in David Nesvorn√Ω HCM-analysis from 2014. Instead, Epeios is listed as a non-family asteroid of the Jovian background population on the Asteroids Dynamic Site (AstDyS) which based on another analysis by Milani and Kne≈æeviƒá.  Naming  This minor planet was named from Greek mythology after the Greek warrior Epeius, leader of the contingent from Phocis during the Trojan War. Epeius also built the wooden Trojan Horse. He then chose the other 29 soldiers who would accompany him inside. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 1 July 1979 ().  Physical characteristics  = Rotation period = As of 2018, no rotational lightcurve of Epeios has been obtained from photometric observations. The body's rotation period, pole and shape remain unknown. = Diameter and albedo = According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Epeios measures 37.98 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.064.

In March 2019 CytoDyn filed with the US FDA the first part of the BLA for leronlimab (PRO140) as a combination therapy with HAART in HIV. In December 2019, the company affirmed plans to complete the BLA in January 2020 with potential FDA approval in 2Q'20. CytoDyn is also conducting an investigative monotherapy trial of leronlimab (PRO140) for HIV. If successful, once per week self-administered leronlimab would represent a paradigm shift in treatment of HIV. CytoDyn is also currently investigating the use of Leronlimab (PRO140) in various solid tumors. On February 18, 2019, CytoDyn announced it will begin 8 pre-clinical studies on melanoma, pancreatic, breast, prostate, colon, lung, liver, and stomach cancer. On November 23, 2018, CytoDyn received FDA approval of its IND submission and allowed to initiate a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial for metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) patients. In May 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Fast Track Designation for Leronlimab (PRO 140) for use in combination with carboplatin for the treatment of patients with CCR5-positive mTNBC. In July 2019, CytoDyn announced the dosing of first mTNBC patient under compassionate use. Simultaneously, the phase 1b/2 trial for treatment-na√Øve mTNBC patients is active and anticipates top line data in 2020. If successful, the data from treatment-na√Øve mTNBC patients could serve as the basis for potentially seeking accelerated US FDA approval. On November 11, 2019, CytoDyn reported that the first TNBC patient injected under its na√Øve protocol (not previously treated for triple-negative breast cancer) demonstrated significantly reduced levels of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and decreased tumor size at two-week and five-week observation intervals compared to baseline observations. CTCs are a potential surrogate endpoint in oncology trials, with reduced levels suggesting long-term clinical benefit. In May 2019, CytoDyn also initiated a pre-clinical study of Leronlimab (PRO 140) to prevent nonalcoholic steatohepatitis with The Cleveland Clinic. In November, the company reported positive results. Mechanism of action PRO 140 is a lab-made antibody that functions as an entry inhibitor. PRO 140 binds to the CCR5 receptor on the CD4 cells, and interferes with HIV's ability to enter the cell. PRO 140, a humanized form of a PA14 antibody, is a chemokine- receptor CCR5 monoclonal antibody and can inhibit CCR5 tropic HIV-1 at concentrations that do not antagonize the natural activity of CCR5 in vitro. HIV-1 entry is mediated by the HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins gp120 and gp41. The gp120 will bind CD4 and the CCR5co receptor molecule, and this triggers gp41-mediated fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. CCR5 is needed for the entry of the virus and the infection of healthy cells. PRO 140, the anti- CCR5 monoclonal antibody, can stop HIV from entering the cell and stop viral replication. It prevents the virus-cell binding at a distinct site in the CCR5 co-receptor without interfering with its natural activity. Unlike other entry inhibitors, PRO 140 is a monoclonal antibody. The mechanism of inhibition is competitive rather than allosteric. As such, it must be injected to be effective. However, once inside the body, PRO 140 binds to CCR5 for >60 days,\\"Progenics Pharmaceuticals' HIV Drug, PRO 140, Receives FDA Fast-Track Designation\\" . Press release, 22 February 2006.

In 1766 he obtained his doctorate from the University of Leiden, and subsequently returned to Geneva in order to practice medicine. Vieusseux is remembered for his pioneer work with neurological disorders. In 1806 he provided an early clinical description of bacterial meningitis -- this being in regards to an 1805 epidemic of the disease in the vicinity of Geneva. In 1887 Anton Weichselbaum (1845‚Äì1920) of Vienna isolated the agent of meningitis, now known as meningococcus. In 1808 he provided the first clinical description of lateral medullary infarction to the Soci√©t√© m√©dicochirugicale de Gen√®ve, and in 1810 described this condition to the Medical and Chirurgical Society of London. However, this disease was later to become known as \\"Wallenberg's syndrome\\", named after neurologist Adolf Wallenberg (1862‚Äì1949), who in 1901 provided a precise anatomical description of the disorder from an autopsy. Vieusseux also distinguished himself as an early advocate of vaccinations for treatment against smallpox.

On 8 August 1980, a fire broke out killing ten people, including both locals and holiday makers. The tragedy was covered as part of the RT√â television series Disasters in summer 2007. The blaze Just after midnight on Friday 8 August 1980, a call was made to the emergency services after a fire had been discovered in a small corridor to the back of the main bar, and going towards the main staircase used by the hotel's guests. The fire broke out at the height of the summer season, with sixty guests, mainly couples and families, booked in on the night, while a function was also taking place in the main dance hall of the hotel. Initially, the town's own fire brigade was dispatched, and was to be aided by other units from across the northwest including Ballyshannon, Donegal Town, Killybegs, Letterkenny and Manorhamilton. As panic spread throughout the town, many locals and holiday makers rushed to the hotel in an effort to rescue some of those who had been trapped inside, with people jumping from the upper floors of the building into blankets held by those below. The fire spread rapidly and burned so intensely that cars parked on the street outside burst into flames. Ambulances were sent from Ballyshannon and Sligo to bring the many injured to hospital, while the fire brigade fought the blaze throughout the night.Bundoran Fire Brigade Site about fire, including photos of the aftermath Aftermath The fire brigade and Garda forensic experts launched an investigation into the blaze, as the remains of the hotel smouldered for several days afterwards. The fire had killed five adults and five children, including the entire Brennan family from Naas, County Kildare, while the body of a Belfast baby, Nicola Lamont, was never found in the rubble. Despite calls from the victims' families and D√°il debates for a public enquiry into the circumstances surrounding the fire, similar to that held after the Stardust fire several months later, none was ever held.Oireachtas Records Calls for an investigation were made again in 2002, when the Fine Gael Senator Jim Higgins called for the Garda handling of the fire to be investigated as part of the Morris Tribunal, an enquiry into police corruption in County Donegal. Higgins said that the fire warranted inclusion in the tribunal's work as claims had been made by the owner of the hotel that Garda√≠ had tampered with the evidence. However, the terms of reference were not extended to include the fire.Fine Gael Press Release, 11 Aug 2002: FG seek extensions to terms of reference of tribunal into alleged garda misconduct in Donegal; viewed 11 April 2008 RT√â programme  In 2007, RT√â's Disaster series investigated the circumstances surrounding the fire. It put forward extracts from the original investigation which stated that it was an electrical fault that had caused the blaze, and stories surrounding the fire of the poor upkeep of the hotel, including allegations that coins had been used rather than electrical fuses. The programme focused mainly on the Kinsella family from Artane in Dublin who lost two of their children in the fire, and on the unfortunate nature of their deaths. It was the family's first visit to the seaside town, and due to a mix up with bookings the family was split up with the two parents sleeping in separate rooms to their four young children.RT√â 'Disasters' site Sean McEniff, a member of the town council, criticised the programme claiming it would reopen old wounds for the families involved and that it was better left in the past.Ocean FM News Remembrance At the time of the tragedy, it was one of the worst fires in Irish history, but the following St Valentine's Day (14 February 1981), 48 people died in the Stardust fire at a club in Artane, Dublin (48 had also died in a cinema fire at Dromcolliher in 1926). The Bundoran fire was for a long time not commemorated physically, although in the aftermath of the RT√â programme the town council voted in favour of a memorial plaque to the ten victims. There was a reluctance to place a plaque on the site of the fire from both councillors and members of the new hotel's board.Bundoran Town Council Minutes The site of the Central Hotel lay vacant for several years, but is now occupied by the Grand Central Hotel and Apartments. However, on Sunday 8 August 2010, a memorial to those who died in the hotel fire was unveiled in the town, exactly 30 years after the tragedy. Families and relatives of the victims attended prayer services in two churches and an unveiling of the memorial seat with the names of the victims inscribed on it.

She was the sister of Sir Robert Vernon, Comptroller of the Household to Queen Elizabeth I, and of Susan Vernon, second wife of Sir Walter Leveson, and a first cousin of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex. Her paternal great-grandfather, Humphrey Vernon, was the grandson of John Talbot, 2nd Earl of Shrewsbury and his wife, Lady Elizabeth Butler, the daughter of James Butler, 4th Earl of Ormond. Humphrey's wife, Alice Ludlow, was the great-great-great-granddaughter of Henry IV of England through his son Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester.

By her mother, Elizabeth was also a great-granddaughter of George Hastings, 1st Earl of Huntingdon and Lady Anne Stafford, daughter of Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham and his wife Lady Katherine Woodville.  Marriage and children  On 30 August 1598 Elizabeth married Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton, who has been suggested as the dedicatee of Shakespeare's sonnets. The marriage occurred after Elizabeth discovered she was pregnant. Upon discovering this, the Queen had both Elizabeth and her husband locked in Fleet Prison and, after their release, the pair were never again received into her favour. Later, when Elizabeth was pregnant she wrote to her husband asking him to buy her a stomacher of scarlet cloth lined with plush to keep her warm while riding, and bring his portrait 'very finely done'.HMC Calendar of the Manuscripts of the Marquis of Salisbury, vol. 15 (London, 1930), pp. 203-4.

She was widowed and suffered the loss of her first son through an epidemic that killed both when on a military expedition in the Netherlands in 1624. She died, aged 83, in 1655. Shakespeare connection theory A German professor of English, Hildegard Hammerschmidt-Hummel, has proposed a theory, mainly based on an apocryphal sonnet that she claims was written by William Shakespeare, and evidence from portraits, that Elizabeth Wriothesley was a lover of the poet. Her eldest daughter Penelope is, according to this theory, a child of Shakespeare. The author stresses that in this way, Lady Diana Spencer would be a descendant of William Shakespeare.(In German) Hildegard Hammerschmidt-Hummel: Das Geheimnis um Shakespeares 'Dark Lady'. Dokumentation einer Enth√ºllung Darmstadt: Primus-Verlag 1999 Questions have been raised about this theory, namely why the Earl of Southampton would have risked certain royal displeasure from the Queen by marrying Elizabeth if she was pregnant with somebody else's illegitimate child.

The distillery is owned by Angus Dundee plc and produces one malt whisky, with the remainder of production sold to blenders or used within Angus Dundee plc for use in blended whisky brands. History The Glencadam Distillery was founded in 1825, by merchant George Cooper, about 200 yards from Brechin Distillery. David Scott was proprietor from 1827 to 1837. The distillery changed hands a number of times between 1837 and 1891. Gilmour, Thompson & Company Limited purchased the distillery in 1891 and used some of the Glencadam product in their Royal Blend brand of blended whisky. The distillery, as with most others, reduced production during World War II owing to fuel and grain rationing. Hiram Walker bought the distillery in 1954, they were bought by George Ballantine & Son Ltd two years later, and ownership of the distillery eventually passed to Allied Domecq through further consolidation in the industry. Allied Domecq mothballed the distillery in 2000 before selling the distillery to the present owners, Angus Dundee plc in 2003. Angus Dundee also own the Tomintoul Distillery. The present owners quickly resumed production and the product from the distillery is used in their own blended and vatted malt whisky products, as well as being sold to other blenders. As of July 2010 Glencadam Malt Whisky is available in a range of official bottlings aged 10 to 21 years, as a component of Ballantine's and Stewart's Cream of the Barley blended whiskies, Angus Dundee's own blended and vatted whiskies, and in a number of other blended brands. Independent bottlings are also readily available, both as single malt and as vatted malts. In November 2008, Angus Dundee plc re-launched the Glencadam line with new packaging and added a new 10 year-old single malt. Then, in July 2010 the company added three new expressions: a 21-year-old, a 12-year-old finished in port wood, and a 14-year-old finished in an oloroso sherry cask.

The United States Navy chose the name \\"Project Yehudi\\" for an early 1940s precursor to stealth technology. A song with the title and catchphrase \\"Who's Yehoodi?\\" was written in 1940 by Bill Seckler and Matt Dennis. It was covered by Kay Kyser and more famously by Cab Calloway. The final stanza of the song is: > The little man who wasn‚Äôt there > Said he heard him on the air > No one seems to know from where > But who's Yehoodi? Both the catchphrase and the song eventually lost all of their original connection with Menuhin. Its double meaning of \\"Who Is Jewish?\\" -- the word \\"Yehudi\\" means \\"Jew\\" in the Hebrew language -- was emphasized in a short sound film (\\"soundie\\") of the song with variant lyrics made in 1943 with singer Lane Truesdale and the Kingsmen, in which a \\"living portrait\\" of a stereotypical Jew with black hat and long beard leers inappropriately at Truesdale's swinging hips before finally announcing \\"I'm Yehoodi!\\" The national swing dance / lindy hop community website Yehoodi derives its name from this catchphrase, as popularized by the Cab Calloway version of the song.

Jean's elder sister June wed Oscar Levant in 1939, to whom she remained married until his death in 1972, and by whom she had three children. The sisters began performing in \\"vaudeville\\" at an early age. This brought Jean to the attention of studios, and led to a small role in the film Bottoms Up (1934), starring Spencer Tracy.

History The French Rite is intimately linked to the birth of Freemasonry in France and was founded in France in 1786.Yves Hivert Messeca, Le Rite fran√ßais in Encyclop√©die de la Franc-Ma√ßonnerie, ed. La Pochoth√®que (LDP). British exiles brought the Modern rite to France and this was little by little passed onto the French Rite.GLTSO Rites, retrieved 30 October 2013 Though this hybrid form is no longer known as the French Rite, it sometimes takes that name to distinguish it from the Scottish Rites from which it was initially formed. In order to guarantee that French Freemasonry would have a national dimension, the Grand Orient de France organised the standardisation of \\"Modern\\" hexagonal (or French, from the perceived shape of the country) rites from 1782 onwards, and in 1785 the model was fixed for the first three degrees in a \\"blue lodge\\", which showed a strong English influence in contrast to the Scottish Rites. However, it was only in 1801 that the Grand Orient de France printed the rules of this rite under the title R√©gulateur du Ma√ßon, containing several additions and amendments to the former version, which had circulated from lodge to lodge in discrete manuscript form. The Rite underwent several further reforms, and in 1858 the \\"Murat French Rite\\" (returning to the foundations of the Constitutions of Anderson without making lasting change to the rite) was imposed. As well as the sub-rites already mentioned, there is also a \\"French Rite of 1801\\". = In Adogmatic Freemasonry = After the 1877 Great Schism, the Grand College of Rites of the Grand Orient de France decided on a new reform. This took place in 1879 and removed from the French Rite any formulas with religious connotations (such as the reference to the Grand Architect of the Universe and the duties towards God). An 1886 commission headed by Louis Aimable concluded an adogmatic form of the rite, giving it a hint of positivism ‚Äî after this date the rite is known as the \\"Aimable French Rite\\". It underwent less important reforms in 1907, and then remained unchanged until 1938. In that year Arthur Groussier (Grand Master of the Grand Orient de France) began a new reform initiative in an attempt to return the rite to its roots after the sum of additions and suppressions which had rendered it hard-to-understand and soulless. The definitive version ‚Äî known as the \\"Groussier French Rite\\" ‚Äî was completed in 1955 under the authority of Paul Chevalier. In the 1960s and 70s, several masons such as Ren√© GuillyHerv√© Vigier (ed.), La Renaissance du Rite fran√ßais traditionnel, Ed. T√©l√®tes. sought the original essence of the French Rite and made a new attempt to reanimate its initiatory and symbolic character. Ren√© Guilly was the prime force behind the creation of a chapter of the Traditional French Rite, a chapter which still exists today within the National French Lodge. In 1974, another chapter was formed in Paris on the instigation of a member of the Traditional and Symbolic Grand Lodge of the Op√©ra. Through its offshoots, the latter led to the creation of a sovereign college of the Traditional French Rite, within a multi-jurisdiction framework. = In Regular Freemasonry = Other masons' research led them to Brazil and it was the Supreme Council of the Modern Rite for Brazil which finally accorded them a patent to establish a French Grand Chapter in 1989. This was a rebirth of the \\"Re-established Modern French Rite\\" after 150 years' absence, under the name \\"Traditional French Rite\\" and purging all later or external additions, modifications and influences. This makes it the closest rite to that practiced in France in the second half of the 18th century. In the words of Roger Girard, \\"the specificity of the French Rite is exactly what no other rite has\\". Practice =Jurisdictions= In continental freemasonry, 80% of lodges practising the French Rite belong to the Grand Orient of France, but it is also practised by some lodges in other jurisdictions such as the Grande Loge Traditionnelle et Symbolique Op√©ra, the Grande Loge Mixte de France and the Loge Nationale Fran√ßaise. It is also the official rite of the Grand Orient of Poland. In 1973, the GODF issued the patent of the French Rite to the Grande Loge F√©minine de France, and so this jurisdiction developed a version of the Rite adapted to its specific needs. In the regular Grande Loge Nationale Fran√ßaise, it is worked by approximately 10‚Äì15% of the lodges. It has spread to Belgium, Luxembourg, Brazil, the Netherlands, Greece, Spain and Switzerland (and formerly in Louisiana), although outside France it is mainly a minority Rite (especially found in lodges founded by the Grand Orient of France). =Degrees= The French Rite system is a regime of seven grades or degrees: In a \\"blue lodge\\": # Apprentice # Companion # Master Four orders: * First order (4th degree): Secret Elect * Second order (5th degree): Scottish Grand Elect * Third order (6th degree): Knight of the Orient * Fourth order (7th degree): Sovereign Rose-Cross Prince, Perfect Freemason, Grand Commander of the Temple A fifth order has existed ever since the Rite's origins, and is first mentioned in the first version of its Regulations in 1801. It is practised by the Grand Orient de France, the Grande Loge Nationale Fran√ßaise and the Women's General Grand Chapter of France. Its main ritual (of the 80 rituals which Masons of this order have to study) is very close to that of the 28th Degree of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite corresponding to the \\"Knight of the Sun\\". =Spirituality= The French Rite is often felt to be the most 'lay' rite of Freemasonry practiced within the Grand Orient de France, an adogmatic jurisdiction which removed such traditional elements as the Volume of the Sacred Law and all mention of the Grand Architect of the Universe from the rite. In the form practiced by the regular Grande Loge Nationale Fran√ßaise, it is the rite most similar to that of the 1717 Premier Grand Lodge [of London], one of the possible founding rites of Freemasonry, perpetuating several fundamentals (such as the position of columns J and B and of the candlesticks around the lodge carpet, the 2 brief blows and one longer blow, the moving of the right foot) which the \\"Antient\\" lodge later changed.

Achievements On 26 April 1939 Fritz Wendel set the world air speed record of , flying the Messerschmitt Me 209 V1. He broke the record set on 30 March 1939 by Hans Dieterle flying the Heinkel He 100 V8. Wendel's record stood for 30 years, until broken by Darryl Greenamyer in 1969. The Me 209 V1's fuselage relic in Krakow, Poland The relic fuselage of the Me 209 V1 still exists in the Polish Air Museum at Krakow. On 18 July 1942 in Leipheim near G√ºnzburg, Nazi Germany, Wendel test flew the \\"V3\\" third prototype of the Messerschmitt Me 262 jet-powered combat aircraft design. This flight was significant as it was conducted with twin Junkers Jumo 004 jet engines for the first time. The earlier-built Me 262 V1 had flown first on 8 April 1941 with a nose-mounted piston engine. Emergencies On 5 September 1940, Flugkapit√§n Wendel, while performing a series of diving trials on Me 210 V2, Werknummer 0002, WL-ABEO, lost the starboard tailplane in the final dive and bailed out, the twin-engined fighter crashing at Siebent√≠schwald, Germany. This was the first of many losses of the type.Green, William, \\"The Warplanes of the Third Reich\\", Galahad Books, New York, 1986, , , p. 611. On 25 March 1942, Wendel took the first prototype Me 262V1, PC+UA, on its first jet-powered flight but the experimental BMW 003 gas turbojet engines it was fitted with both failed and he was forced to limp the prototype airframe back to Augsburg on the nose-mounted Jumo 210 inverted-V12 piston engine installed for initial airframe testing.Price, Dr. Alfred, \\"Messerschmitt Me 262: Missed Opportunity or Impossible Dream?\\", International Air Power Review, AIRtime Publishing Inc., Westport, Connecticut, 2007, , p. 129. Wendel worked for Messerschmitt until the collapse of Nazi Germany in 1945. Later life After the war Wendel became director of a local brewery but continued flying sports planes until a circulatory ailment forced him out of the cockpit. A few days before his death he was released from hospital where he underwent treatment for the circulatory condition. Wendel was found dead at his home in Augsburg, Germany, on Sunday 9 February 1975 with a hunting rifle at his side. Police said that relatives found his body but could not rule immediately whether his death was suicide or an accident. He was 59. Wendel was survived by his wife and a 21-year-old son.United Press International, \\"Jet Fighter Pioneer Pilot Dies in Germany\\", Playground Daily News, Fort Walton Beach, Florida, Monday 10 February 1975, Volume 29, Number 407, page 2A.

Located in Tehran, it is supervised by the Iranian Parliament and dates back to 1906. Articles 54 and 55 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran define the objectives and responsibilities of SAC, the most important duty of the organization being the preparation of the government's Budget Liquidation Report, as specified by article 55 of the Constitution. The state body is tasked with controlling \\"financial operations and activities of all ministries, institutions, government companies and other organizations which in any manner whatsoever benefit from the state budget.\\" Since 2010, SAC has been charged with supervising the Iranian Economic Reform Plan. SAC also monitors the Oil Ministry‚Äôs deposits into the state treasury on a monthly basis. It is also in charge of the supervision of the National Development Fund. \\"$1 billion missing oil money\\" In May 2009, SAC reported that 1 billion was missing from Oil Stabilization Fund. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad says the issue of the 'missing' $1 billion from the country's currency reserve fund is in fact an \\"accounting error.\\" However, the claim prompted a firm response from SAC which rejected any talks of \\"accounting errors\\" and rebuked the government for providing \\"insufficient answers\\" in the case of the missing $1.058 billion oil money. SAC defended both methodology and accuracy of its work and revealed that there had been 1463 cases of infractions regarding the country's 2007-2008 budget. According to SAC's report, illegal payments to some government officials accounted for a large part of the infractions while there were also cases in which the government had acted against the articles of the budget law. In December 2010, Supreme Audit Court (SAC) Director Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli said that the case was mentioned in a report presented to the Majlis and the report neither called it fraud nor said the money was missing, but only referred to it as \\"a deficit in the account\\". Babak Zanjani According to head of Iran‚Äôs Supreme Audit Court Amin-Hossein Rahimi, Babak Zanjani‚Äôs role in the course of transferring the country‚Äôs oil revenues involved breach of law because he did not provide collateral for his multi-billion dollar oil contracts with the government.http://presstv.com/detail/2014/03/11/354193/iran-sends-teams- abroad-over-fraud-case/ As a consequence, Iran was not able to obtain a complete payment for the oil it sold following the international oil embargo.http://www.payvand.com/news/14/feb/1135.html Criticism According to Freedomhouse \\"SAC is little more than a ceremonial body because judges appointed by the regular judiciary often overturn its verdicts\\". They are also not permitted to inspect any of the finances related to the Revolutionary Guards, which is where most of the corruption within the country is believed to originate. Asked whether Transparency International's recent report on administrative corruption in Iran corresponds to the findings of the Supreme Audit Court, SAC Director Fazli said the report is based on criteria that the SAC does not recognize. \\"This does not mean that Iran rejects the report and the country should make efforts to fulfill their criteria,\\" he added.

Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada had experienced a severe heart attack and wondered whether he would live to present the world with a translated version of the \\"divine pastimes\\" of Krishna on earth. Prabhupada had translated the Second Canto of the ≈örƒ´mad BhƒÅgavatam, but knew that many years of work remained before he would reach the Tenth Canto, where these accounts of Krishna are contained. He therefore decided to write Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, also known as KRSNA Book, before undertaking the remaining cantos. Once Prabhupada had completed the manuscript, he requested that Shyamsundar Das, one of the founding devotees of the Radha Krishna Temple in London, ask George Harrison of the Beatles if he would finance its publication.Tillery, p. 72. The sum required was $19,000 for an initial print run of 5000 copies.Greene, p. 158. Harrison's support for the Hare Krishna movement had been crucial to the establishment of ISKCON's UK operation in 1969,Clayson, pp. 268‚Äì69, 439. and his production of the London devotees' hit single \\"Hare Krishna Mantra\\" had promoted ISKCONLavezzoli, p. 195. and the 5000-year-old Maha Mantra worldwide.Dwyer & Cole, p. 31.Tillery, pp. 151‚Äì52. Shyamsundar was loath to impose further on Harrison, but Prabhupada insisted, saying: \\"You will see. Krishna will help you to say it.\\"Greene, pp. 158‚Äì59. The acharya also emphasised the importance of the book since, although Krishna's name was now being heard throughout the West, people had no knowledge of the deity's life or his physical appearance.Greene, p. 159. Shyamsundar passed on Prabhupada's request during dinner at the house of the London sculptor David Wynne, who had just helped Harrison choose a marble slab for an altar he was donating to the new temple. The devotee recalls that a thunderstorm raged outside that evening, and Harrison's reaction became \\"grimmer and grimmer\\" as it became clear that he was being asked to provide further financial assistance.Tillery, pp. 72‚Äì73. In Shyamsundar's account, there was then a flash of lightning outside, accompanied by a loud clap of thunder, and all the lights in the house went out.Tillery, p. 73. When the power had been restored, Harrison said, \\"Well, there's no arguing with that, is there?\\" and agreed to finance the publication. Harrison authorised the printing in March 1970.Tillery, p. 161. The book was printed in Japan by the company Dai Nippon, with advance copies arriving in England by May that year. Contents The Tenth Canto of the BhƒÅgavatam details the activities and pastimes of Krishna at Vrindavan. Within this book, Swami Prabhupada describes the historical events that occurred approximately 5000 years ago. The book included 54 pages of colour illustrations, with a painting on the front cover that depicted Krishna with his consort Radha.Greene, pp. 158, 160. Author Joshua Greene writes of this first edition: \\"It was massive ‚Äì a foot tall, weighing two pounds, and running [to] almost four hundred pages ‚Ä¶ The book was mysterious and beautiful.\\"Greene, p. 160. Prabhupada invited Harrison to supply the foreword, which begins: \\"Everybody is looking for Krishna. Some don't realize that they are, but they are.\\"Greene, pp. 161‚Äì62. According to Greene, since 1970, KRSNA Book has been translated into twenty languages and has sold over 5 million copies.Greene, p. 163.

History Brown County, Indiana was created in 1836 from portions of Monroe, Delaware, Jackson and Bartholomew Counties. The land had been acquired from the Native American tribes in two parts based on a treaty line that ran southeast to northwest. Known as the \\"Ten O‚ÄôClock Treaty Line\\" and later referred to as the ‚ÄúIndian Boundary Line,‚Äù the land southwest of the line was obtained in 1809 in the Treaty of Fort Wayne (1803) known as ‚ÄúHarrison‚Äôs Purchase\\". The land northeast of the line was obtained in 1818 in the Treaty of St. Mary‚Äôs, known as the ‚ÄúNew Purchase.‚ÄùBlanchard, Charles, Editor. Counties of Morgan, Monroe, and Brown, Indiana: Historical and Biographical. Chicago, IL: F.A. Battey & Co., 1884. The area encompassing the village of Story was opened to European settlement on September 30, 1809. The so-called ‚ÄúTen O‚Äôclock Treaty‚Äù opened three million acres (12,000 km) to settlement, the boundary being a line running from Raccoon Creek on the Wabash River near Montezuma to Seymour, marked by a shadow cast at 10:00 a.m. each September 30. That line passed through the heart of what would become the village of Story. Today, that line is denoted by the Story Monument in the center of Story‚Äôs village green. The village of Story is named for Dr. George P. Story, who received a land patent for 173 acres from President Millard Fillmore in 1851. This original land patent is on display at the Story Inn. During the early 1850s, Dr. Story moved from Ohio to settle on the acreage. Family farms, the doctor‚Äôs medical practice, a township school and a grist mill were established over the following twenty years, prompting local reference to the area as \\"Storyville\\". Formal creation of the village of Story occurred in 1882, when Dr. Arnold S. Griffitt continued operation of the medical practice and farming operations, and established a dry goods store that housed the first post office. The village‚Äôs first church congregation was also founded. The Story-Griffitt House (a c.1858 I-house) is now part of Story Inn.Brown County, Indiana. Tax Duplicates, 1848-49, 1851, 1958-59, 1876-77. Original documents, Brown County Historical Society. Story grew in regional importance during the nineteen teens as other villages in Van Buren Township, Brown County, Indiana began to fade. Due to regional prominence of the general store it continued to remain viable into the 1950s. During the 1880s and 1890s, the village centered around the store and grist mill, first owned and operated by Dr. Griffitt and later by Willard Fulks. A saw mill was later added and previously written narratives indicate Story also had a blacksmith shop and a slaughterhouse, both of which were commonly found in small rural villages. In 1900, the store and grist mill were sold to Alra and Mary Wheeler. They lived in the Queen Anne style architecture Wheeler-Hedrick House (1894) across from the store and now part of the Story Inn. After enlarging the original store building sometime between 1911 and early 1915, the building burned in November 1915. Following the fire, one report claimed of Wheeler‚Äôs store that ‚Äúhis stock was one of the largest in the county.‚Äù‚ÄúOne Pair of Shoes All That Is Saved From $18,000 Fire.‚Äù Brown County Democrat [Nashville] 25 Nov 1915, pg. 5. www.newspapers.com Viewed 31 Jan 2017. The set back was short lived, however, as a new, two-story store building was soon constructed with \\"Wheeler General Store\\" prominently painted across the upper facade. Business continued to be successful for the Wheelers‚Äîthe store supplied several huckster wagons that traveled the region each week and the business included operation of the grain mill. Oral interviews claim the store served as the wool-buying center for the county, with Wheeler taking the wool to mills in Seymour, Indiana, and that it employed six full-time employees. Growth and success of the village and the need to supply huckster wagons prompted another resident to open a second store sometime in the 1920s. However, it had closed by the early 1930s. One source from 1929 states of Story, ‚Äúthe village is now a prosperous little town containing two stores, a non-denominational church, school, and several residences in the midst of fertile farming land.‚Äù‚ÄúBrown County Villages Past and Present.‚Äù Gladys E. Ralphy, 1929. Clipping files, Towns and Communities, Folder 1, Brown County Historical Society. Wheeler died in 1921 and in early 1924, Albert and Susan Hedrick purchased the general store, saw mill, the Wheeler home and a small amount of additional land surrounding the buildings. The Hedricks purchased the store and associated businesses in partnership with their oldest son, Ralph, and the store was renamed \\"Hedrick & Son Grocery\\". The 1920s into the 1930s were the busiest years for the general store and its associated operations during the Hedrick family ownership. The store sold a wide assortment of necessities including farm equipment, clothing, shoes, local produce and meat. A March 1924 ad shows the store was one of only a handful of Brown County locations offering Certified Seed Potatoes.‚ÄúStory.‚ÄùBrown County Democrat [Nashville] 27 Mar 1924, pg. 6. www.newspapers.com Viewed 3 Feb 2017. Meat sold in the store was also processed onsite, with thirty-five hogs butchered in one year alone. By 1930, Ralph and his wife, Brunell, and their young son, Robert, were living in the c.1920 house immediately adjacent to the store. Among other duties, Ralph was operating the saw and feed grain mills and his youngest sister, Clotha, was a sales person in the store. She became known for her pickled bologna.Reed, Richard F., ‚ÄúBrown County Folks.‚Äù Brown County Genealogical Society, 1995. pg. 66-68, from original printing in Brown County Democrat [Nashville] 3 Jul 1974. Farming in the hilly, rocky terrain of what is today the Hoosier National Forest region was a difficult undertaking. Marginal farms with poor soil were made worse with soil run off from clear cutting of the forests. When the government began offering to buy their land in the 1920s for creation of Brown County State Park (opened 1929), many farmers gladly accepted. With the coming of the Great Depression (1929‚Äì1933), many families also abandoned their farms in search of work elsewhere, a departure not unlike that narrated in John Steinbeck's, The Grapes of Wrath. Brown County lost half of its population between 1930 and 1940 and much of the farming ceased. Creation of Yellowwood State Forest, Hoosier National Forest and the Charles C. Deam Wilderness Area displaced even more from the area.Ayers, Helen C. The Stuff of Legends: Tales of Van Buren Township of Brown County‚Äôs People. Bloomington, IN: AuthorHouse, 2006. For these reasons, Brown County is 80% forested today (second-growth, but still impressively mature). The loss of population, and thus customers, began the decline of Story's commercial prosperity. The United States Army Corps of Engineers flooded the area west of Story in 1960, creating Monroe Reservoir known as Lake Monroe (Indiana), the state's second largest man-made lake. The town of Elkinsville, Indiana was abandoned and the road that once connected to State Road 46, past the home and studio of artist T. C. Steele (and what is now the T.C. Steele State Historic Site), was closed, cutting Story‚Äôs access to Bloomington, Indiana via Elkinsville Road. Elkinsville Road serves as Story‚Äôs main street, but it now dead-ends four miles (6 km) to the west at a fallen iron bridge. Further isolated, Story‚Äôs decline continued. Clotha operated the store until 1969, installing a lunch counter to serve park visitors and passing motorists, and operating the only fuel service for the surrounding area. The c.1937 Standard Service gold and red crown gas pumps still stand today in front of the building. This paucity of capital was, in retrospect, a blessing. Little new construction followed the Great Depression, and fortuitously, no one attempted to ‚Äúmodernize‚Äù the venerable but aging structures at Story when the rest of the nation embarked upon a campaign to eliminate unsightly wooden floors, stamped tin metal ceilings and globe lighting and replace them with shiny asbestos floor tiles and dropped fiberboard ceilings sporting snazzy new recessed neon bulbs. Likewise, nature has reclaimed most of Brown County, and today the area surrounding Story is wild and natural. Story sits at the edge of Salt Creek, a labyrinthine system of quiet, slow-moving tributaries which now form the backwaters of Lake Monroe. This moist bottomland, now under the protection of the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, is a spectacular spawning ground for fish and fowl alike, a place of serenity and raw beauty found nowhere else in Indiana. Story Inn The general store continued to operate to some degree through the 1970s. In 1978, Benjamin (one name) and his wife, Cynthia Schultz, purchased four and a half acres that included the grocery store, grist mill, barn, and a small rented house. They initially occupied the second floor of the store building as their residence. Benjamin, an architect and builder with restaurant experience, and Cynthia, a former restaurant owner, jointly pursued their vision of creating a bed and breakfast. In this manner, the \\"Story Inn\\" was born. In the decade that followed the couple re-assembled the nearly 24 acres that today defines the old town, converting the upstairs of the grocery store and the surrounding cottages into guest homes and making the name \\"Story Inn\\" synonymous with the town itself. The business prospered as destination B&B;'s gained popularity. Benjamin and Cynthia Schultz sold the Story Inn in 1992, and the town once again fell into hard times. A federal bankruptcy was followed by receivership, and the entire town was sold at sheriff's sale on February 14, 1999, to an entity owned by Rick Hofstetter, an Indianapolis attorney and preservationist, and Frank Mueller, a German-born restaurateur. Hofstetter and Mueller had previously helped to renovate the iconic Athenaeum (Das Deutsche Haus) in Indianapolis, Hofstetter serving as the first President of the Athenaeum Foundation (from 1992-4) and Mueller as the manager of the Rathskeller Restaurant in its basement (from 1993-5). Today, the Athenaeum is recognized as a National Historic Landmark. The village of Story, Indiana, is now a country inn/bed & breakfast offering fine dining, catering, and accommodations. The second floor of the Old General Store (Wheeler-Hedrick General Store; local lore is that it was also once a Studebaker buggy dealership where wagons and buggy were assembled) has been renovated into four quaint bed & breakfast accommodations notable for their year-round occupant, the ‚ÄúBlue Lady.‚Äù The Blue Lady is a mirthful albeit innocuous apparition with flowing white robes whose cheeky behavior has been observed by Story Inn employees and recorded in guest books since the 1970s. The Treaty House, Doc Story‚Äôs homestead (Story-Griffitt House), the Alra Wheeler homestead (Wheeler- Hedrick House), the Carriage House, the Old Mill (Grain Mill), the Pruitt- Schultz House and another c.1930 house have each been tastefully and authentically renovated into guest cottages, many with kitchenettes and hot tubs. Story‚Äôs Old General Store, replete with its creaky wooden floors, pot- bellied stove and long-retired Standard Oil Crown gas pumps out front, is now a celebrated gourmet restaurant open year-round serving breakfast, lunch and dinner. Much of the history of Story, Brown County and the region which straddles the Ohio River, is humorously depicted in Rick Hofstetter's book, Kentuckiana Roads: A Freidenker's Story of Life in America's Flyover Middle (Algora Publishing, NY: 2017). In March, 2019, the village was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Story Inn hosts the annual Indiana Wine Fair in May.

The community is home to the camp and conference center of the Episcopal Diocese of Indianapolis, which opened in 1957. History The Bilhiemer family built the original house (now called the Main House) and tried to farm the property. The farm failed and a man named Charlie Murphy bought the property. History tells that the Mr. Murphy tried to run a gambling operation out of the property. This too failed. The leadership of Jim and Marian Mara in the early 1950s got Waycross off the ground. The summer camping program of the Diocese began in the 1940s and sessions were held at rented facilities. The Mara‚Äôs and Father Edward Callanan, Jr. purchased the original property. Additional property was added along the years, including south of the main house (known as the Golf Course), and a large area that included land and a house that had been part of the Hickory Hill Farms operation. Bud Reahard and family purchased the Hickory Hill land. Hickory Hill became the site of the Hickory Hill Camp program, where campers learned primitive camp skills while staying in teepees, covered wagons or cabins. The name Waycross is described in the book edited by John Simmons, The History of Way cross-Hickory Hill Episcopal Camps 1957-1997. ‚ÄúThe camp just happens to lie at the imaginary intersection of a cross that overlays the intersection of a cross that overlays the Episcopal Diocese of Indianapolis.

Roberts The Confederation Poets were the first Canadian writers to become widely known after Confederation in 1867.Article, \\"Confederation Poets: Canada, 1880s-1920s\\", in Henderson, Helene, and Jay P. Pederson, editors, Twentieth-Century Literary Movements Dictionary (Detroit: Omnigraphics Inc., 2000), 84-85. Charles G. D. Roberts (recognized in his lifetime as \\"the father of Canadian poetry\\") led the group, which had two main branches: One, in Ottawa, consisted of the poets Archibald Lampman, Duncan Campbell Scott, and William Wilfred Campbell. The other were Maritime poets, including Roberts and his cousin, Bliss Carman. The four major poets in the group were Roberts, Carman, Lampman and Scott, with Lampman \\"most often regarded as the finest poet\\" in the group, according to the Twentieth- Century Literary Movements Dictionary. Isabella Valancy Crawford, c.1919 The group, which thrived from the 1890s to the 1920s, generally paid attention to classical forms and subjects, but also realistic description, some exploration of innovative technique and, in subject matter, an examination of the individual's relationships both to the natural world and modern civilization. None of the above poets ever used the term \\"Confederation Poets\\", or any other term, for themselves as a distinct group. Nothing indicates that any of them considered themselves a group. In fact, they \\"were in no way a cohesive group.\\"W.J. Keith, \\"Poetry in English 1867-1918,\\" Canadian Encyclopedia (Edmonton: Hurtig, 1988), 1696. As a group, the \\"Confederation Poets\\" were formed by a retroactive process of canonization: \\"Malcolm Ross's retrospective application of the term ‚ÄòConfederation poets‚Äô is a good example of canon- making along national lines. Several reasons have been given for treating the Confederation Poets as a distinct group. Roberts, Lampman, Carman, and Scott were among the first critically acclaimed poets to be published after the formation of the Dominion of Canada\\". As \\"Confederation Poet\\" Archibald Lampman said about encountering \\"Confederation Poet\\" Charles G.D. Roberts's work: > One May evening somebody lent me Orion and Other Poems, then recently > published. Like most of the young fellows about me I had been under the > depressing conviction that we were situated hopelessly on the outskirts of > civilization, where no art and no literature could be, and that it was > useless to expect that anything great could be done by any of our > companions, still more useless to expect that we could do it ourselves. I > sat up all night reading and rereading Orion in a state of the wildest > excitement and when I went to bed I could not sleep.\\"Archibald Lampman > 1891,\\" Colombo's All-Time Great Canadian Quotations, Highbeam.com, Web, Mar. > 28, 2011. There are biographical and literary connections among the Confederation poets. They were about the same age, b born in the early 1860s. Francis Zichy motes: \\"Roberts and Carman were cousins; Roberts briefly edited Goldwin Smith's Toronto literary magazine The Week, in which Carman published his first poem.\\" Lampman also published in the Week, and he and Roberts became friends by mail. In the early 1890s, when Carman worked on the editorial staffs of The Independent and The Chapbook, and other American magazines, he published poems by the other three. =At the Mermaid Inn= Duncan Campbell Scott \\"Lampman and Scott were close friends; with Wilfred Campbell they began the column \\"At the Mermaid Inn\\" At the Mermaid Inn‚Äô in the Toronto Globe, in 1892.\\" The original idea was to raise some money for Campbell, who was in financial difficulty. As Lampman wrote to a friend: \\"Campbell is deplorably poor.... Partly in order to help his pockets a little Mr. Scott and I decided to see if we could get the Toronto \\"Globe\\" to give us space for a couple of columns of paragraphs & short articles, at whatever pay we could get for them. They agreed to it; and Campbell, Scott and I have been carrying on the thing for several weeks now.\\"John Coldwell Adams, \\"William Wilfred Campbell ,\\" Confederation Voices: Seven Canadian Poets, Canadian Poetry, UWO. Web, Mar. 21, 2011. \\"Scott ... came up with the title for it. His intention was to conjure up a vision of The Mermaid Inn Tavern in old London where Sir Walter Raleigh founded the famous club whose members included Ben Jonson, Beaumont and Fletcher, and other literary lights.\\"John Coldwell Adams, \\"Duncan Campbell Scott ,\\" Confederation Voices, Canadian Poetry, UWO, Web, Mar. 30, 2011. Campbell expressed some unorthodox opinions in the column, including an outline of the history of the cross as a mythic symbol; when readers of the Globe demanded an apology, Campbell apologized for overestimating their intelligence, further angering the readership and his fellow columnists.\\"Campbell, William Wilfred,\\" Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online. Web, Mar. 20, 2011. The column ran only until July 1893. In that year Campbell left to take a full-time position in the Department of Militia and Defence. With his financial crisis over, the column to an end. Poetry Archibald Lampman The Confederation writers' poetry, while including some Canadian elements of style and content, showed the strong influence of English Victorian verse.Ken Norris, \\"The Beginnings of Canadian Modernism ,\\" Canadian Poetry: Studies/Documents/Reviews, No. 11 (Fall/Winter, 1982), UWO. Web, Mar. 25, 2011. As is clear from the Lampman quote, what Roberts was striving for, and what Lampman was responding to, was not the idea of a distinctly Canadian poetry, a poetry 'of our own'. Rather, it was that of a Canadian, 'one of our own,' writing \\"great\\" poetry. Irrespective of their explicit statements about nationalism, in terms of their aesthetics the Confederation Poets were not Canadian nationalists, but thorough-going cosmopolitans. They did not aim to create a Canadian literature; they aimed at a world class literature created by Canadians. In the late 19th century world class literature meant British literature, which was Victorian by definition. The Confederation Poets were writing in the tradition of late Victorian literature; and like most in that tradition, the most obvious influences on them were the Romantics. The Confederation poets were the first to publish works in this traditional style while using Canadian events and places in their poetry: Roberts's Tantramar, Carman's Grand Pr√©, Lampman's Lake Temiscamingue, Scott's Height of Land, Campbell's Lake Region. Canadian readers for the first time had the opportunity to read poetry by Canadians, with Canadian content. As Frye put it, \\"The impact of Lampman, Carman, Roberts, and D.C. Scott on Canadian poetry was very much like the impact of Thomson and Group of Seven painting two decades later,\\" wrote literary critic Northrop Frye. \\"Contemporary readers felt that whatever entity the word Canada might represent, at least the environment it described was being looked at directly.\\"Northrop Frye, \\"from 'Letters in Canada' 1954,\\" The Bush Garden (Toronto: Anansi, 1971), 34. Frye saw other parallels between those four poets and the Group of Seven: \\"Like the later painters, these poets were lyrical in tone and romantic in attitude; like the painters, they sought for the most part uninhabited landscape.\\" The Oxford Companion to Canadian Literature says: \\"All four poets drew much of their inspiration from Canadian nature, but they were also trained in the classics and were cosmopolitan in their literary interests. All were serious craftsmen who assimilated their borrowings from English and American writing in a personal mode of expression, treating the important subjects and themes of their day, often in a Canadian setting. They have been aptly called the first distinctly Canadian school of writers.\\"\\"Confederation Poets,\\" Oxford Companion to Canadian Literature, Answers.com, Web, Apr. 7, 2011 Evaluation =Canonization= Bliss Carman Like Thomson and the Group of Seven, the Confederation Poets became the new country's canon. This canon- building began even in their lifetimes. In 1883 Roberts's friend Edmund Collins published his biography, The Life and Times of Sir John A. MacDonald, which devoted a lengthy chapter to \\"Thought and Literature in Canada,.\\" Collins lost no time in dethroning what had been English Canada's top poets, the 'three Charleses': Charles Heavysege, Charles Sangster, and Charles Mair. \\"Collins allots Heavysege only one paragraph, dismisses Sangster‚Äôs verse as 'not worth a brass farthing,' and ignores Mair completely.\\" In contrast, Collins devoted fifteen pages to Roberts. \\" more than anyone else, Edmund Collins is probably responsible for the early acceptance of Charles G.D. Roberts as Canada‚Äôs foremost poet.\\" In Songs of the Great Dominion (1889), anthologist W.D. Lighthall pronounced that \\"The foremost name in Canadian song at the present day is that of Charles George Douglas Roberts.\\" Lighthall included poetry by Roberts (who had published two books by then), by Lampman, Campbell, and F.G. Scott (one book each), and also by Carman and D.C. Scott, although neither had published a book at that time. \\"The publication in 1893 of a little anthology called Later Canadian Poems, edited by J.E. Wetherell, was a defining event in bringing attention to the Confederation Poets as a group.\\" The 'three Charleses' are gone: Roberts, Lampman, Carman, Campbell, the Scotts, and George Frederick Cameron are the male poets represented. That would be the pattern repeated in subsequent anthologies, with minor variations: like A Treasury of Canadian Verse (1900), which Campbell boycotted; or The Oxford Book of Canadian Verse (1913), which Campbell edited, and \\"devoted more pages to his own poetry than that of anyone else.\\" The same poets were included in the books on Canadian literature that began appearing in the new century: Archibald MacMurchy's Handbook of Canadian Literature (1906), followed by T.G. Marquis's English Canadian Literature (1913). \\"The decade following the First World War saw the appearance of five more handbooks on Canadian literature.... As different as these five books are from each other, they all recognize the accomplishments of the Confederation Poets as an important advance in Canadian literature.\\" =Debunking= William Wilfred Campbell As the canon, the Confederation Poets set the standard. Their work became the type of poetry Canadian readers wanted and expected, and therefore Canadian magazines published. Since that standard was Romantic and Victorian, the Confederation Poets were blamed by some for retarding the development of Modernist poetry in Canada. For example, the Twentieth-Century Literary Movements Dictionary says of them that: \\"Their legacy of Realism, Romanticism, and nationalism was so powerful that it lasted well into the first decades of the 20th century, beyond when much of their best work had been published,\\" according to the . Certainly that was a complaint of the Montreal Group or McGill Movement, \\"a group of young intellectuals under the influence of Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot.... In Montreal the assault was spearheaded by The McGill Fortnightly Review (1925-1927), edited chiefly by two graduate students, A.J.M. Smith and F. R. Scott (son of Frederick George Scott).\\" \\"In various editorials, Smith argued that Canadian poets must go beyond the ‚Äòmaple-leaf school‚Äô of Bliss Carman, Archibald Lampman, Duncan Campbell Scott, and Charles G.D. Roberts in favour of free verse, imagistic treatment, displacement, complexity, and a leaner diction free of Victorian mannerisms.\\"Geoff Hancock, \\"McGill Fortnightly Review - (1925 ‚Äì 7),\\" Encyclopedia of Literature, JRank.org. Web, Mar. 25, 2011. The intentionally disparaging term \\"Maple Leaf School\\" was picked up from the progressive magazine Canadian Forum, which was waging a similar crusade for literary modernism. \\"Probably the most resounding salvo by the Canadian Modernists is F. R. Scott‚Äôs 'The Canadian Authors Meet,' the first draft of which appeared in The McGill Fortnightly in 1927. One of its six stanzas lampooned the attention given to the Confederation Poets\\":John Coldwell Adams, \\"The Whirligig of Time,\\" Confederation Voices, Canadian Poetry, UWO.ca, Web, Mar. 28, 2011. ::::The air is heavy with Canadian topics, ::::And Carman, Lampman, Roberts, Campbell, Scott, ::::Are measured for their faith and philanthropics, ::::Their zeal for God and King, their earnest thought. However, such complaints ignore that modernist poetry was being written in the 1920s: by W.W.E. Ross, Dorothy Livesay, Raymond Knister, and even a couple of the Confederation Poets themselves. By the 1930s Roberts had begun introducing the themes and techniques of Modernist poetry into his work. (See, for example, \\"The Iceberg\\" from 1931.) Scott had been doing the same since the early 1920s. (See, for example, \\"A Vision\\" from 1921.) After he had won a reputation as an anthologist of Canadian poetry (The Book of Canadian Poetry 1943, Modern Canadian Verse 1967), Smith changed his opinion of the Confederation Poets' work, blaming his earlier disparagement on youthful ignorance: \\"Bliss Carman was the only Canadian poet that we had heard of and what we heard, we didn't care for much. It was only later, when I began to compile books on Canadian poetry, that I found that Lampman, Roberts and Carman had written some very fine poetry.\\"Anne Burke, Critical Introduction , \\"Some Annotated Letters of A.J.M. Smith and Raymond Knister,\\" Canadian Poetry: Studies/Documents/Reviews, Number 11 (Fall/Winter 1982), UWO, Web, Mar. 26, 2011. =Re-evaluation= Frederick George Scott The rehabilitation of the Confederation writers began with a rise of Canadian nationalism during the late 1950s, in what has been called \\"a cultural moment inspired by the founding of the Canada Council (1957), and the establishment of the New Canadian Library, with [Malcolm] Ross himself as general editor.\\" Ross's Poets of the Confederation rolled off the press as New Canadian Library Original N01. \\"As Hans Hauge puts it, Ross ‚Äòis beginning to construct a national literature and he does so by providing it with a past, that is to say, by projecting the project of a Canadian national literature into the past‚Äô (‚ÄòThe invention of national literatures‚Äô, in Literary responses to Arctic Canada, ed. J√∏rn Carlsen, 1993).\\" Ross's claim was that his four Confederation Poets were Canadians who \\"were poets - at their best, good poets.\\" \\"Here, at least, was skill, the possession of the craft, the mystery. Here was another - one like oneself. Here was something stirring, something in a book by one of ourselves,' something as alive and wonderful in its own way as the [achievements] of the railway builders. Our empty landscape of the mind was being peopled at last.\\" Ross de-emphasized, but did not question, the modernist debunking of the Confederation Poets: \\"It is natural enough that our recent writers have abandoned and disparaged 'The Maple Leaf School' of Canadian poetry. Fashions have changed. Techniques have changed.\\" Indeed, fashions and techniques do change; and by the mid-1980s the modernist presumptions behind the Montreal Group's debunking were themselves being questioned. \\"A proper recognition of his nineteenth-century contexts can enhance our appreciation of Carman, and of his Confederation peers,\\" Tracy Ware wrote in Canadian Poetry in 1984 \\"I am suggesting that Confederation poetry be given the respect that is customarily accorded the poetry of the McGill movement. Such a critical approach might succeed in removing the pervasive but dubious anti-Romantic tenets of Canadian modernism, tenets that have lingered here long after they have been questioned elsewhere.\\"Tracy Ware, \\"The Integrity of Carman‚Äôs 'Low Tide on Grand Pr√©',\\" Canadian Poetry: Studies/Documents/Reviews No. 14, UWO, Web, Apr. 16, 2011. In the same issue, Canadian Poetry editor D.M.R. Bentley, using Lampman's term for himself, dubbed the Confederation school \\"Minor Poets of a Superior Order,\\" and argued that \\"What James Reaney has recently written of Crawford, Lampman and Roberts can be extended to Carman, Scott, Campbell, Sherman, Pickthall and others: they 'wrote well and were of note.'\\"D.M.R.

After graduating from the Police Training School at Hastings, he began his career as a law enforcement officer. After several years with the Sierra Leone Police Force, Seisay traveled to Europe to continue his studies where he read engineering at the Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden. While he was a student, Seisay had a life-changing meeting with Martin Luther King Jr. in Stockholm, which deepened his interest in nonviolent activism. Seisay earned a master's degree in political science at Long Island University. He is a Ph.D. candidate at The New School in New York City.Radio Monitoring Report: Vol. 1, Issue #0101 International League for Human Rights  Diplomatic career  In 1967, Seisay founded the Sierra Leone Ex-Police Officers Association. He was elected as their representative to the Civilian Rule Committee, that was going to restore civilian rule in Sierra after the military government of Andrew Juxon-Smith. In 1968, Juxon Smith's government was overthrown in the Sergeants' Coup. Seisay was then appointed Deputy Commissioner of the Sierra Leonean Police Force by the ruling junta. Seisay proved to be most efficient in this post, especially considering the difficult political climate, and skillfully helped manage the transition. Seisay was initially tapped to serve as Sierra Leone's Ambassador to Egypt but was instead appointed Consul General to the United States. He was stationed in New York where he served for six years.Sierra Leone Politics New York Times, 14 October 1969The Jewish Theological Seminary: Letters of Dr. Louis Finkelstein He worked to secure educational scholarships for Sierra Leonean students in various fields, primarily education. Under his leadership, the Sierra Leone Consulate became financially self-sufficient. Seisay also served as Dean of the Consular Corps. He sat on the Fifth Committee of the United Nations General Assembly for several years.Administrative & Budgetary/5th Committee3d Largest Diamond Is Found in Africa New York Times, 15 April 1969  Fight for democracy  After Steven's declared a one-party state, Seisay's cousin John Amadu Bangura staged an unsuccessful military coup. Bangura was later executed for treason. Seisay became an opponent of the Stevens government. He left his post as Consul General and began to protest the decline of democracy in Sierra Leone.Political Freedom in Sierra Leone New York Times He publicly criticized Stevens' regime in the New York Times.  Political exile  In 1974, Seisay went into self-imposed political exile. Among his allies were his older brother Solomon G. Seisay, director of prisons, and former Prime Minister Albert Margai until Margai's death in 1980. Seisay aided Sierra Leoneans who fled from persecution to get political asylum in the United States. In 1987, Seisay's political exile ended when Joseph Saidu Momoh became president of Sierra Leone.  Later career and private life  Seisay became an executive in the private sector. Based in the United States, he continued to work internationally and remained devoted to the cause of re-establishing democracy in Sierra Leone. In the early 1960s, he married a member of the Swedish aristocracy and they raised their family in Westchester County, New York. He has lectured at several universities, including Dartmouth, and published a number of articles and op-eds most notably in West Africa and Christian Science Monitor.

He advised the leaders of the optometry profession who were responsible for setting up the Victorian College of Optometry in 1939 and 1940 and helped plan the first four-year optometry course. He was involved again when the optometry course was transferred to the university. Wright married Julia Violet Bell, a nurse, on 24 September 1932 at Camperdown, Victoria; they subsequently divorced. On 22 July 1964 he married Meriel Antoinette Winchester Wilmot, his secretary since 1941, in the registry office, Kensington, England.Peter McPhee, \\"Wright, Sir Roy Douglas\\", Dictionary of Australian Biography. The young Roy Douglas Wright of the 1930s sported circular glasses frames, while an older, more refined Wright turned his attention to a more edgy rectangular frame style by the early 1980s. He was a colourful supporter of causes, as his biography \\"Pansy Wright ‚Äî A biography of Roy Douglas Wright\\" by Peter McPhee (1999) attests. He challenged students, colleagues and institutions, asserting at one time: \\"Whatever you do, whether you do it well or do it badly, do it brilliantly. Avoid mediocrity on all accounts\\". In the Australia Day Honours of 1983, he was made a Knight (AK) of the Order of Australia. He was the brother of Sir Reg Wright, a long- serving Liberal Senator from Tasmania, who was also knighted, and who died only ten days later, on 10 March 1990.
