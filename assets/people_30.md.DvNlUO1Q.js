It spans about of land. The college is one of the several academic institutions running in the same campus managed by Udai Pratap Educational Society. History Udai Pratap College is situated in the North Western part of the holy city of Varanasi in India. The campus is spread over 100 acres. This College was conceptualized and created by a philosopher and saint king Late Rajarshi Udai Pratap Singh Judeo. The beginning was made when Late Rajarshi Udai Pratap Singh Ju Deo, founded Hewett Kshatriya High School in Varanasi in 1909which was raised to the level of an Intermediate College in 1921 and was rechristened Udai Pratap Intermediate College, Varanasi. The institution was further elevated to the level of a degree college in 1949 when it commenced undergraduate classes in Arts and Commerce. This was followed by the beginning of Science classes in 1950, Agriculture in 1963 and B.Ed in October 1972. Post graduation in some subjects of science and arts was initiated in July 1970 and in agriculture in July 1972. The college was the first in Uttar Pradesh to be conferred autonomy by the University Grants Commission in July 1991 and it has grown to its present status and known as Udai Pratap College, Varanasi. The college is co-educational in character. The neat and clean and well maintained campus comprises 30 departments in arts, science, commerce, education and agriculture faculties and offers teaching programmes leading to B.A., B.Sc., B.Com., B.Sc.(Ag), M.A., M.Sc., M.Com, M.Sc. (Ag), B. Ed. Ph.D. programme is available in almost all the subjects in arts, science, commerce and agriculture. Post-graduate diplomas are offered in computer application and environmental science. The college follows annual system of academic work in Faculty of Science, Arts, Commerce, and Education. The Faculty of Agriculture follows the semester system as well as credit system. Founder – Rajarshi Udai Pratap Singh JuDeo Udai Pratap College, Varanasi was founded in the year 1909 as a high school. It owes its existence to Rajarshi Udai Pratap Singh JuDeo, Raja of Bhinaga. Though born a raja he became a sanyasi (recluse) for the welfare of society. He was born on 3 September 1850 and died in 1913. He founded Hewett Kshatriya High School in Varanasi which has grown into Udai Pratap Autonomous College, Varanasi. On the occasion of laying the foundation stone of Hewett Kshatriyo High School on 25 November 1909, Rajarshi sent a massage to be read at the time which sums up his philosophy about education and can be of much use to the mankind in the present environment of terror and violence. \\"....Knowledge was given to man to bless and not to harass mankind. The education that does not further the ends of Universal peace and progress is not deserving of the name. ...'we must not efface from our minds the fact that we are not only born in the land of Rama and Buddha but that we also lay claim to the same blood flowing in our veins; the one most cheerfully renounced his crown and his kingdom in obedience to his father and his king; while the other did the same in order to preach universal love and peace...\\" Rajarshi had held several posts in the government. He was advisor to the Education Commission. He was made member of Union Public Service Commission in 1886. In acknowledgement and recognition to his erudition, he was chosen fellow of Allahabad and Calcutta Universities. He was a social and political thinker and expressed his views about several matters like democracy etc. He regularly contributed articles on various social, academic and political issues in a famous British paper \\"Nineteenth Century.\\" He wrote a number of books and several articles and had a rare command of the English language. Apart from establishing the college, he established an orphans' home, Bhinga Raj Anathalaya at Kamachchha in Varanasi and also created a permanent fund by donating it Rs. 1,23,000/- to meet the recurring expenses. He donated thousands and lacs of rupees to several social organizations, to name a few- KG Medical College, Luclanow; Moolghandh Kuti Vihar,Sarnath; Calvin Taluqedar College, Lucknow; Hindi Pracharini Sabha. He also created several permanent funds for providing scholarships to students from the interest earned. Office bearers DR.

This effect is mainly caused by the surrounding ligands that are complexed to the metal and it is the ligands that are involved in the reduction chemistry instead of the metal due to electronic destabilization by being significantly distanced from the metal. Sterically induced reductions commonly involve metals found in the lanthanoid and actinoid series.  Background  Divalents Lanthanides are extremely reducing (can reduce alkali cations) compounds. Of these divalent lanthanides, Samarium(II) iodide, SmI2, is a common reducing agent that is used in a variety of synthetic applications, mainly because all other divalent lanthanides are unstable. Complexes of Sm(II) have also been investigated and used in similar applications. However, even though Sm(II) complexes and compounds have had tremendous success when used in conjunction with a variety of substrates. There have been instances where chemistry of certain materials cannot be performed due to unclean reactions in which products are not easily isolated from reaction mixtures when Sm(II) compounds are used to perform the desired reduction. In these cases, adjusting the size of the metal (which is commonly and easily done for the trivalent lanthanide compounds) may fine tune the nature of a specific reaction, which should produce desired and clean products. One drawback to this notion is that Sm(II) is uniquely stable compared to other divalent lanthanides, where the other metals in the series tend to exist freely in the trivalent state. The discovery and application of sterically induced reductions allows the unique reducing properties and chemistry to be applicable to all of the lanthanide metals while remaining in their more stable trivalent state. When Sm(III) is complexed with (pentamethylcyclopentadiene) to give the compound , this trivalent species has been shown to have the same reducing reactivity of the Sm(II) derivative.Evans, William J. The Expansion of Divalent Organolanthanide Reduction Chemistry Via New Molecular Divalent Complexes and Sterically Induced Reduction Reactivity of Trivalent Complexes. Journal of Organometallic Chemistry 647 (2002) 2-11. Sm+2 vs Sm+3 Reductions The top reaction is the Sm(III) derivative and the bottom involves the Sm(II) derivative. Notice that the oxidation state of the metal in the top reaction does not change, while the oxidation state changes in the bottom one. If the metal was involved in the reduction the oxidation states should have changed (+3 to +4). For the trivalent compound this is not the case, thus the ligands themselves must be involved in the reduction process via the following redox reaction: : → e− \\\\+ 1/2 But ligand induced reductions are not new and have been known to happen with a variety of lanthanide complexes. However, steric factors must also be considered on the reactivity of the Sm(III) complex as less crowded structures do not have any reductive activity. For years, it was thought that (C5Me5)3Sm was not a possible compound due to the huge strain of cone angles greater than 120 degrees. However, this compound is formed from the Sm(II) complex, and X-Ray structures of the Sm(II) complex have shown that there was enough room for a third spot. Also, X-ray structures of (C5Me5)3Sm show that the C5Me5s are 0.1 Angstroms farther from the metal than normally predicted and expected. This increased distance, forced by sterics, makes the ligands have less electronic stability and may be a possible reason for the observed redox reaction of the ligands instead of the metal. Sm is a typical and well studied metal due to its unusual stability in a divalent and trivalent state. With the discovery of sterically induced reductions other lanthanide metals can now be studied in their more stable trivalent state, which can allow for more control of reduction reactions by tuning the reaction based on the metal size and electronics.

On moonlit nights from as early as 1836, people would find food missing from their cabins, even though an intruder would have had to step over sleeping dogs to reach it. Families stopped fattening hogs, because a fat hog would inevitably be replaced by a scrawny one. Though valuables such as watches or money were never taken, sometimes tools would disappear only to reappear later, beautifully polished. Occasionally searchers would find a camp, but \\"The Thing\\" never returned while they waited.Shadows on the Land: An Anthology of Texas Historical Marker Stories - The Wild Man of the Navidad The creature was most often described as covered in short brown hair and very nimble, which allowed for it to elude capture for many years. The Rev. Samuel C.A. Rogers, a circuit-riding minister in the area, first saw a total of three footprints in the spring of 1845 and continued to spot them for several years before all but the largest disappeared. Although some believe the creatures survived for many years, Rogers wrote that in 1850, the largest hunt for the wild man was organized, and the hunters did trap a man in a tree, surrounded by baying dogs, horses and men with guns.Wildman of the Navidad: Truth or Tall Tale? from The Victoria Advocate This is where the legend diverges into varying versions - the most common being that the captured man was actually a solitary African who wore no clothes and spoke no English. In 1851, a sailor who spoke the man's African dialect reportedly came traveling through the area. It turned out that the \\"wild man\\" was a prince who'd been sold into slavery as a child. After reaching Texas, he and a companion had escaped, but the companion had died from exposure after a few years.

According to the Minister of Justice, Chief Bayo Ojo, the law was pushed by President Olusegun Obasanjo following the international conference on HIV/AIDS (ICASA) in 2005. The proposed bill calls for five years imprisonment for anyone who undergoes, \\"performs, witnesses, aids, or abets\\" a same-sex marriage. It would also prohibit any display of a \\"same-sex amorous relationship\\" and adoption of children by gays or lesbians.\\"Nigeria: Obasanjo Must Withdraw Bill to Criminalize Gay Rights\\", Reuters AlertNet. March 23, 2006. URL accessed on March 26, 2006 The bill is expected to receive little or no opposition in Parliament. The same-sex marriage ban would make Nigeria the second country in Africa to criminalize such unions. In 2005, the Ugandan constitution was amended to ban same-sex marriage.Uganda bans same-sex marriage The same bill would also call for five years imprisonment for involvement in public advocacy or associations supporting the rights of lesbian and gay people. Included in the bill is a proposal to ban any form of relationship with a gay person. The intent of the bill is to ban anything remotely associated with being 'gay' or just gay in the country. In February 2006, the United States State Department condemned the proposal. In March 2006, 16 international human rights groups signed a letter condemning the bill, calling it a violation of the freedoms of expression, association and assembly guaranteed by international law as well as by the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights and a barrier to the struggle against the spread of AIDS.

Nigeria is a nation opposed to homosexuality and the passage of the bill received little opposition from the people. The bill voids marriage contracts between people of the same sex and persons aiding and abetting same sex marriages. However, there already existed a bill criminalizing homosexuality and questions were raised about the importance of the new bill.Adetoun Teslimat Adebanjo. (2014). Culture, morality and the law: Nigeria’s anti-gay law in perspective. International Journal of Discrimination and the Law December 2015 vol. 15 no. 4 256-270 The major difference is that, the bill went further than the previous criminal and penal codes by prohibiting same sex marriages and actions aiding same sex unions by Nigerian citizens. Persons witnessing, officiating or supporting gay acts or weddings can be charged in court. The law is a way to use scare tactics to discourage same sex unions. In 2018, LGBT activists who have worked extensively in the country on LGBT issues and court cases involving LGBT persons all agree that the law has never been used to convict anyone in any homosexuality-related cases. This, they believe, is because the law itself is incoherent. In addition, many cases involving suspected LGBT persons lack proper evidence and sometimes there’s no evidence at all. That makes it impossible for prosecutors to present a winnable case and prove that any crime has been committed.https://76crimes.com/2018/12/15/6-surprising-facts-about-nigerias- anti-gay-marriage-law/  See also  *LGBT rights in Nigeria *Same Sex Marriage (Prohibition) Act 2006 *Recognition of same-sex unions in Africa  References  Category:LGBT rights in Nigeria Category:Nigerian law Nigeria ","title":"Recognition of same-sex unions in Nigeria"},{"id":"22809694","text":"Kevin Francis Dwyer (12 February 1929 – 12 July 2020) was a New Zealand cricketer who played seven first-class matches for Auckland in the Plunket Shield.

There is an underground lake situated in the caves called Martel Lake, which is about 115 m in length and 30 m in width, and its depth varies between four and twelve meters. It is named after the French explorer and scientist Édouard-Alfred Martel, considered the founding father of speleology, who was invited to explore the cave 1896. While German cave explorer, M.F. Will, had mapped the White and Black cave in 1880, Martel found two more caves, as well as the underground lake. The caves are open to the public and one of the main attractions on Mallorca. The visit ends with a classical concert performed by four musicians on a boat.

The actress was cast in the role following a competitive audition process. Jones began filming her first scenes in February 2009. She made her first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 18 May 2009. The character was created as part of a new generation of the Ramsay family, along with her brother Harry (Will Moore) and sister Kate (Ashleigh Brewer). Sophie is the youngest of three siblings introduced to the show. Sophie departed on 29 March 2013, after Jones decided to leave to concentrate on her schooling. The actress briefly reprised the role for two episodes from 7 April 2014. Creation and casting In February 2009, a Channel 5 reporter announced Neighbours were introducing a new generation of the Ramsay family to the show. At the time of the casting announcement, the Ramsays had not appeared in Neighbours for over a decade. Executive producer Susan Bower said the introduction of the new Ramsay family members was based on the American drama series Party of Five. Bower explained \\"We have three orphans, basically. That, as you can imagine, has a tremendous amount of story material with it and they're fabulous! Wait until you see this cast. They just clicked\\". Bower introduced the new characters despite the show receiving criticism because they did not have a nuclear or \\"normal\\" family. Brisbane actress Ashleigh Brewer was cast as the eldest member of the new family, Kate, and Will Moore was cast as the only boy, Harry. Kaiya Jones, a former cast member of The Saddle Club, was cast as Sophie, the youngest member of the Ramsay family, following a competitive audition process. Jones began filming her first scenes with Neighbours in February 2009. Jones was born and raised in Scotland and has lost her Scottish accent while living and filming in Australia. Of her casting, Jones told Samantha Booth of the Daily Record, \\"Filming Neighbours is so much fun. I just love my job and wouldn't want to be doing anything else. The cast and crew are so kind and lovely. They are practically my second family now. They're also very patient\\". DevelopmentCharacterisation and crush= Sophie was initially described as being the \\"baby of the family\\", who was trying to come to terms with the death of her mother, Jill (Perri Cummings). Channel 5 said Sophie was traumatised by Jill's death and she and her siblings had to fend for themselves. Sophie began communicating through drawings and revealed she knew more about her mother's death than anyone else. Sophie and her siblings soon settled into Number 24 and Sophie \\"found her feet\\", especially with the support of her friend, Callum Jones (Morgan Baker). Both Sophie and Callum bonded over mutual ground, as they were without their real parents. As she gets older, Sophie develops into a pretty, \\"free spirited\\" teenager. Sophie develops feelings for neighbour and friend, Zeke Kinski (Matthew Werkmeister). Zeke finds out and he mistakingly tells his friends about her schoolgirl crush. Sophie is publicly humiliated and vows not to leave her house again. Zeke tries to make things better by going to visit her. A Neighbours insider told the Daily Star, \\"Sophie is humiliated and ends up running away to hide from everyone. Zeke feels terrible and is determined to help her.\\" =Noah Parkin= In July 2011, Orpheus Pledger joined the cast as Noah Parkin. Pledger began filming his first scenes opposite Jones and many of Noah's early scenes were with Sophie. Channel 5 reported Noah would get close to one particular Erinsborough local and they should prepare for \\"heartbreak and havoc.\\" Sophie and Noah connect as they are both really into music. When asked how Noah feels about Sophie, Pledger said \\"She's just a friend and another student who happens to be into the same thing. He just wants to help her.\\" Noah agrees to help Sophie with her guitar lessons and she develops a crush on him. However, Sophie is unaware that Noah is attracted to her sister instead. Sophie is left heartbroken when she discovers Noah does not like her romantically and has a crush on someone else. Of the development, Susan Hill of the Daily Star explained \\"The pretty student has been dreaming about Noah and would love to be his girlfriend. So when she finds out he's in love with someone but he can't tell her who, she gets her hopes up.\\" However, Sophie is devastated when she learns Noah has his eye on Summer Hoyland (Jordy Lucas). Sophie feels like she cannot compete against someone as attractive as Summer and she has a \\"pretty tough time of it.\\" Sophie discovers Noah actually likes Kate and she is devastated. She decides to drop out of Noah's band. After Kate tells Noah to stay away from her and Sophie, he reveals their kiss to everyone. He later admits to lying to get her into trouble. However, Andrew Robinson (Jordan Smith) finds Sophie having a go at Noah for trying to ruin her sister's career and he tells her the kiss did happen. Sophie tells Priya Kapoor (Menik Gooneratne) that Noah was not lying and she falls out with Kate. =Makeover and Corey O'Donahue= In September 2011, the official Neighbours website reported Jones had decided to cut her waist length hair into a Bob cut. The website said the reason why Jones' character was sporting a new look would be revealed in the coming months. Jones explained Sophie's styling choices are \\"pretty extreme\\" compared to her own casual style and she added \\"I can't give too much away but her look is very radical, she's definitely discovered what eye-liner and mascara is all about.\\" On 6 October, Channel 5 reported Sophie would undergo a radical rock chick makeover. They said \\"The transformation reflects Sophie's shift from demure school girl to would-be rock chick, and is key to a major storyline which sees her rebellious side start to emerge.\\" News of Sophie's \\"drastic\\" makeover followed Jones' decision to have her hair styled into a bob to reflect the personality changes in her character. Sophie moves in with her uncle, Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis), following her falling out with Kate and more of her rebellious nature begins to come out. Jones told a writer for Inside Soap \\"Sophie wants to be independent. Now she's living with Paul, she thinks she can do what she wants because her sister, Kate, isn't looking over her shoulder all the time.\\" Paul tells Sophie she is too young to attend a Red Cotton gig, which makes her more determined to go. She asks her cousin, Andrew, to help her out as he organised the gig. Jones said Sophie is manipulative and uses emotional blackmail to get what she wants. Andrew manages to persuade Paul into letting Sophie attend the gig, saying he will keep an eye on her. The storyline also saw the introduction of a new love interest for Sophie. Sophie meets and develops an attraction to Corey O'Donahue (Toby Wallace). Of Corey, Wallace said \\"He meets [Sophie] at one of his brother's gigs - they both click and she really likes him. But there's this wall between Sophie and Corey in that she doesn't really know who he is. She likes that mystery.\\" Corey impresses Sophie and he gives her first kiss. Wallace said he and Jones found the scene awkward to shoot at first, but it became comfortable after a while. When Paul turns up at the gig, Andrew finds Sophie and Corey together and pulls them apart. He orders Sophie to stay away from Corey, but she refuses. Jones said \\"Sophie thinks of this guy as a great distraction. She threatens to tell Paul that she kissed Corey at the gig - and Andrew knows that his dad will be furious with him if he finds out...\\" =Departure and return= On 26 November 2012, Erin Miller from TV Week announced that Jones would be leaving Neighbours, along with two other cast members. Miller reported that Jones wanted to concentrate on her high school education. The actress filmed her final scenes in December. Jones commented that she was \\"both sad but excited\\" about her decision to leave. Executive producer Richard Jasek stated \\"All the characters departing will leave a legacy on Ramsay Street which is testament to the extraordinary talents of the actors playing them. Communities are constantly changing and Neighbours is reflective of this.\\" Sophie departed on 29 March 2013. On 10 February 2014, it was announced that Jones would be returning to Neighbours for a brief guest stint. The actress has already filmed her scenes for \\"a special celebration episode\\". Jones's return gave her the opportunity to catch up with Brewer, her on-screen sister, before she finished filming with the show. Jones later said that her return storyline was \\"really good\\" and added \\"It's challenging and an emotional rollercoaster, so that's been fun.\\" Jones's return scenes as Sophie aired from 7 April 2014. Storylines Sophie's mother, Jill, dies after a hit-and-run accident and she, her brother Harry and sister Kate are left to fend for themselves. Kate buys Sophie a bike and when she falls off and hurts her ankle, Kate realises that the family need help. The family then move into Ramsay Street. Sophie's uncle Paul Robinson becomes the prime suspect in Jill's death, but Rebecca Napier (Jane Hall) realises that Sophie witnessed her mother's accident. Sophie explains that Paul was helping Jill and Sophie thanks him. Sophie befriends Callum Jones and they bond over shared interests. Lou Carpenter (Tom Oliver) becomes the Ramsay's guardian. When the family is put at risk of being split up by the DHS, Harry tries to keep the situation a secret from Sophie. Sophie finds out and makes her siblings promise to tell her everything in future. Callum and Sophie begin attending Erinsborough High. While Callum strikes up a friendship with some other boys, Sophie is bullied. Callum start neglecting Sophie, but when she prevents his friends from embarrassing him in public, they become close friends again. Sophie applies to the National Basketball Academy on Harry's behalf and he is delighted when he gets in. He then leaves for Sydney. Sophie, Kate and Lou invite Lucas Fitzgerald (Scott Major) to move in with them. Sophie develops a crush on Zeke Kinski and when she learns that he is on the school social committee, she joins up too. Callum teases her about her crush and they fall out. Natasha Williams (Valentina Novakovic) learns of Sophie's crush on Zeke and blackmails her into voting for the things she wants for the social. Zeke tries to let Sophie down gently, but he manages to upset her. Sophie asks Lisa Devine (Sophie Tilson) to give her make over, but when she is teased by Dean Harman (Cameron Heine), Summer Hoyland helps her to find something that she more feels comfortable in. Lyn Scully (Janet Andrewartha) allows Sophie to babysit her grandson Charlie Hoyland (Jacob Brito). While Sophie is on the phone, Charlie runs away. Lyn is initially angry with Sophie, but later apologises when Charlie is found. When Kate asks Sophie to leave town with her and her boyfriend, Mark (Scott McGregor), Sophie initially refuses to go. She eventually changes her mind and she and Kate race to meet Mark, but they find they are too late and he has left without them. Sophie begins learning to play the guitar and befriends new student, Noah Parkin, who helps her to learn the chords. Kate pays Noah to give Sophie guitar lessons and Sophie organises a small gig at the Men's Shed for him to say thanks. Sophie swaps her guitar for a bass, so she can join Noah's band. While she is at music camp, she decides to cut her hair and change her image. When Sophie finds Noah's sketchbook is full of songs and sketches of Kate, she realises he has a crush on her sister and is devastated. Noah later reveals Kate kissed him and when Andrew confirms the allegation is true, Sophie tells acting principal, Priya Kapoor. Noah reveals that Kate was grieving for Mark when she kissed him. Sophie confronts her sister about keeping Mark's death from her and their relationship deteriorates. Sophie then decides to moves in with her uncle, Paul Robinson. Sophie helps her cousin, Andrew, organise a gig for local band Red Cotton. Sophie meets Corey O'Donahue during the gig and they kiss. Andrew sends Sophie home, but she starts blackmailing him into letting her see Corey. When Sophie decides to break up with Corey, Andrew asks her to keep dating him as he wants Corey's brother, the lead singer of Red Cotton, to let him manage the band. Kate leaves town without telling Sophie, which upsets her. When Sophie comes to watch Andrew shoot a video for Red Cotton's first music video at the school, Corey's brother, Griffin (William Ewing) is unhappy. She apologises for hurting Corey and helps the band with the video. However, she gets carried away and wrecks a bathroom. Sophie then reveals that she thinks Kate left because of her, despite Paul reassuring her that that is not true. When Sophie refuses to apologise for wrecking the bathroom, Priya expels her. Roz Challis (Janet Watson Kruse) from the DHS hears of Sophie's expulsion and explains that Kate has seven days to return or Sophie will be placed in foster care. Paul leaves to find Kate, while Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne) looks after Sophie, who later asks her to be her guardian. Believing Kate will not return, Sophie decides to run and she stays with Rani Kapoor (Coco Cherian). Rani and Callum try to encourage Sophie to return home and Callum eventually tells Paul where she is. Kate returns in time for the DHS meeting and she and Sophie admit they do not want to live together anymore. Paul successfully applies to become Sophie's guardian and she begins attending Eden Hills Grammar. Sophie decides she wants to return to Erinsborough High and writes an apology to Priya. She also gets Red Cotton to perform at the school, but Priya tells her it is not enough. Kate later talks to Priya on her behalf and Priya allows Sophie to return. Sophie becomes jealous of Callum and Rani's friendship and tries to turn them against each other. Callum and Rani tell Sophie that they fancy each other and she becomes uncomfortable with their romantic behaviour. However, she then realises that they are faking it and Rani explains that they were just getting their revenge. Paul learns Sophie's grades are slipping and asks her to concentrate on her homework. He later becomes fed up of her attitude and forbids her from going to see The Jezabels in the city. When Sophie learns Andrew and his friends are going, she sneaks out and hides in the boot of Chris Pappas' (James Mason) car. When she is discovered, Andrew persuades Chris into letting her sit on Summer's lap. An argument breaks out between Andrew and Natasha, causing Chris to lose control of the car and crash. Sophie is thrown from the car and seriously injured. She undergoes surgery to repair her broken pelvis and to stop some internal bleeding. Her heart briefly stops, but is soon restarted. Sophie begins feeling isolated in the hospital and she asks to go home, but Paul arranges for her to go to rehab in Sydney. Sophie returns a few weeks later, using crutches to help her walk. Sophie tells Chris that she blames herself for the crash and he tries to reassure her that it was not her fault. He also tells her not to shut her friends out. Sophie gives up music, but helps Chris to learn the guitar. She later learns that Chris could play all along and that he was helping her instead. Sophie gets herself a job at the local cafe, Grease Monkey's, which annoys Paul. He later employs her as a cleaner at Lassiter's Hotel instead. Sophie tells Kate and Paul that she has applied to the Sydney Conservatorium of Music. However, she is upset when she learns that her application was rejected and that Paul told the conservatorium about her exclusion from school. Sophie then successfully applies to the Newtown High School of the Performing Arts and manages to get Paul to sign the application form, by tricking him. When Paul finds out what Sophie has done, he threatens to ring the school and tell them. However, both Sophie and Kate talk him out of it. Sophie says goodbye to Callum and Rani and she leaves Ramsay Street, along with Andrew and Natasha. A year later, Sophie returns for Kate's birthday and is delighted when Kate gets engaged to Mark. Shortly afterwards, Kate is shot and she dies, devastating Sophie. After attending the funeral, Sophie goes to visit Harry in the United States during his basketball tour. Reception Holy Soap said that Sophie's most memorable moment was witnessing the \\"crash that killed her mother\\" and communicating this through drawings in her journal, before coming forward to help Paul Robinson off the hook. Peter Dyke and Katie Begley of the Daily Star called Sophie a \\"pretty teen.\\" A writer for the Herald Sun branded Sophie's crush on Zeke \\"creepy\\". When Sophie began to change her personality and appearance, Cameron Adams of The Advertiser said he knew Sophie had gone emo because she had her nose pierced. Adams added \\"Sophie's pierced herself for a boy, of course. Problem is, he's older. And a muso. So cue lots of pouting, jaw-dropping and \\"whatever\\" and \\"OMG\\" facial expressions. And then looking at him wistfully as they pretend to rock out.\\" Adams later called Sophie \\"recalcitrant\\". The Herald Sun's Dianne Butler thought Sophie wore too much eye make-up.

Konzept zum \\"bedside\\" - Gerinnungsmonitoring mittels modifizierter Thrombelastographie. Der Anaesthesist 1995;44(2):437 It is a modification of traditional thromboelastography (TEG). TEM investigates the interaction of coagulation factors, their inhibitors, anticoagulant drugs, blood cells, specifically platelets, during clotting and subsequent fibrinolysis. The rheological conditions mimic the sluggish flow of blood in veins. While traditional thromboelastography is a global assay for blood clotting disorders and drug effects, TEM is primarily used in combination with appropriate differential assays. They allow testing in the presence of therapeutic heparin concentrations and provide differential diagnostic information to support decisions in therapy. In numerous publications the validity of the method is shown. Application of TEM at the point of care (POC) or in emergency laboratories is getting more and more popular. TEM detects both hypo- and hyperfunctional stages of the clotting process and is probably the only reliable rapid test for the diagnosis of hyperfibrinolysis. In contrast to standard clotting tests, the fibrin stabilizing effect of factor XIII contributes to the result. The rapid availability of results helps to discriminate surgical bleeding from a true haemostasis disorder and improves the therapy with blood products, factor concentrates, anticoagulants and protamine, hemostyptic and antifibrinolytic drugs.Kozek-Langenecker S.

Transfus Med. 2006;16:31-9 Method Blood (300 µl, anticoagulated with citrate) is placed into the disposable cuvette using an electronic pipette. A disposable pin is attached to a shaft which is connected with a thin spring (the equivalent to Hartert’s torsion wire in thrombelastography) and slowly oscillates back and forth. The signal of the pin suspended in the blood sample is transmitted via an optical detector system. The test is started by adding appropriate reagents. The instrument measures and graphically displays the changes in elasticity at all stages of the developing and resolving clot. The typical test temperature is 37 °C, but different temperatures can be selected, e.g. for patients with hypothermia.Dirkmann D, Hanke AA, Görlinger K, Peters J. Hypothermia and acidosis synergistically impair coagulation in human whole blood.Anesth Analg. 2008;106:1627-32 In contrast to thrombelastography with its pendulum-like principle, the design of the TEM viscoelastic detection system (figure 1) makes it quite robust and insensitive against mechanical shocks or vibrations. Result The primary result of TEM is a reaction curve which shows the elasticity over time when the clot forms or dissolves. This curve is also called a TEMogram. Four key parameters describe the clotting curve for clinical routine. More than 10 additional calculated parameters, including derivative curves which are useful in specific research applications, e.g. in hemophiliaSørensen B, Johansen P, Christiansen K, Woelke M, Ingerslev J. Whole blood coagulation thrombelastographic profiles employing minimal tissue factor activation. J Thromb Haemost. 2003;1:551-8 or thrombophiliaHvitfeldt Poulsen L, Christiansen K, Sørensen B, Ingerslev J. Whole blood thrombelastographic coagulation profiles using minimal tissue factor activation can display hypercoagulation in thrombosis-prone patients.Scand J Clin Lab Invest. 2006;66:329-36. or for the effects of recombinant FVIIaSørensen B, Ingerslev J.Whole blood clot formation phenotypes in hemophilia A and rare coagulation disorders. Patterns of response to recombinant factor VIIa. J Thromb Haemost. 2004;2:102-10. are available for research purposes. Measurement parameters CT (Clotting time): The CT is the latency time from adding the start reagent to blood until the clot starts to form. Prolongation of CT may be a result of coagulation deficiencies, primarily coagulation factors, or heparin (dependent on the test used). A potential contribution of heparin can be detected by comparing INTEM- with HEPTEM CT data (see “reagents” below). A shortening of CT indicates hypercoagulability. CFT (Clot formation time) and alpha-angle: The alpha angle is the angle of tangent between 0 mm and the curve when the clot firmness is 20 mm, while CFT is the time from CT until a clot firmness of 20 mm point has been reached. These parameters denote the speed at which a solid clot forms and are primarily influenced by platelet function, but to a certain extent especially fibrinogen and coagulation factors contribute. A prolonged CFT (or a lower alpha-angle) is usually caused by poor platelet function, low platelet count, fibrin polymerization disorders or fibrinogen deficiency. Apparently also FXIII seems to be involved already in this phase.Karger R, Egbring R, Weippert-Kretschmer M, Kolde HJ, Kretschmer V. Improvement of ROTEM clot stabilization kinetics in a patient with severe factor XIII deficiency after administration of factor XIII concentrate. Hämostaseologie 2006;1: A37, P188 Higher concentrations of heparin can also prolong CFT in the INTEM assay, but not in HEPTEM, EXTEM, FIBTEM or APTEM (see under “reagents”). A shortening of CFT (or a high alpha-angle) indicate hypercoagulability. MCF (Maximum clot firmness): MCF is the greatest vertical amplitude of the trace. It reflects the absolute strength of the fibrin and platelet clot. A low MCF is indicative of decreased platelet number or function, decreased fibrinogen level or fibrin polymerization disorders, or low activity of factor XIII. A mechanically weak clot represents a severe bleeding risk and should initiate immediate therapeutic steps. High doses of heparin can lower MCF in the INTEM assay, but not in HEPTEM, EXTEM, FIBTEM or APTEM (see under “reagents”). A5, A 10, A15 or A20 value These values describe the clot firmness (or amplitude) obtained after 10, 15 or 20 minutes (beginning from CFT) and provide a forecast on the expected MCF value at an earlier stage already. A recent investigation has validated this approach for the A15 value in more than 800 cases during liver transplantation.Goerlinger K, Dirkmann D, Hanke A, Dusse F, Hartmann M. ROTEM- based algorithm for point-of-care coagulationmanagement in visceral surgery and liver transplantation:experience of eight years and 829 LTX. Joint International Congress of ILTS, ELITA & LICAGE, July 9–12, 2008, Paris, France (Poster) The advantage of the A15-values is obvious: It allows for a more rapid decision about therapeutic interventions. LI 30 (Lysis Index after 30 minutes) and ML (Maximum Lysis) The LI30 value is the percentage of remaining clot stability in relation to the MCF value at 30 min after CT. A similar value can also be calculated at other time points (45 or 60 min). The ML parameter describes the percentage of lost clot stability (relative to MCF, in %) viewed at any selected time point or when the test has been stopped. A low LI (X) value or a high ML value indicates hyperfibrinolysis. While in normal blood fibrinolysis activity is quite low, in clinical samples a more rapid loss of clot stability by hyperfibrinolysis may lead to bleeding complications which can be treated by the administration of antifibrinolytic drugs. TEM assays Initially, thrombelastography was simply performed with whole blood without adding reagents (except calcium when citrate anticoagulated blood was used). This provides a global overview about all phases of clot formation, stabilization and degradation. In the case of monocausal haemostasis disorders, the resulting reaction curves may be quite typical; however, under most clinical conditions this approach has severe limitations. In reality various effects overlap, including haemodilution or application of high doses of parenteral anticoagulants. High doses of heparin often prevent clot formation at all. Absence of a controlled activation step leads to inferior reproducibility and very long test times which are not acceptable for POC applications. The assays for ROTEM analysis help to get a rapid differentiation between various potential haemostasis defects or anticoagulant drug effects and allow for a rapid differential diagnosis. They form the base for selecting a therapeutic strategy. Several diagnostic algorithms have been proposed and were clinically validated.Coakley M, Reddy K, Mackie I, Mallett S.Transfusion triggers in orthotopic liver transplantation: a comparison of the thromboelastometry analyzer, the thromboelastogram, and conventional coagulation tests. J Cardiothorac Vasc Anesth. 2006;20:548-53.Goerlinger K, Dirkmann D, Kiss G, Dusse F, Hanke A, Arvieux CC, Peters J. ROTEM-based Management for Diagnosis and Treatment of Acute Haemorrhage during Liver Transplantation. Euroanaesthesia 2006, Madrid (Poster) Application of this strategy helps to minimize the exposure of patients to allogeneic blood products which have certain risks; and it saves costs. Numerous research applications have used the technique as well. Tests INTEM This test mildly activates the contact phase of haemostasis. The result is influenced by coagulation factors, platelets, fibrinogen and heparin. Low molecular weight heparin is detected at higher concentrations.Konstantinidis K, Gerasimidis T, Verdy E, Elalamy I, Samama MM, Gerotziafas GT. Inhibition of clot formation process by treatment with the low-molecular-weight heparin nadroparin in patients with carotid artery disease undergoing angioplasty and stenting. A thromboelastography study on whole blood. Thromb Haemost. 2007;97:109-18.Fenvyivesi T, Lakner M, Träger I, Jörg I, Giese C, Harenberg J. Effect of direct thrombin inhibitors, low molecular weight heparins dalteparin and enoxaparin and of the heparinoid danaparoid on the Rotation thrombelastometry method (ROTEM). Haemostaseologie 2005;25(S):P138 In the absence of heparin, INTEM is a screening test for the haemostasis system. It is used for therapeutic decisions regarding the administration of fresh frozen plasma, coagulation factors, fibrinogen or platelets. HEPTEM This assay represents an INTEM assay performed in the presence of heparinase, a heparin (or LMWH) degrading enzyme. It allows the identification of haemostasis deficiencies even in the presence of heparin and represents an INTEM test without interference by heparin or heparin like anticoagulants. The difference between HEPTEM and INTEM CT-value comparison confirms the presence of heparin, e.g. accidental exposure.Vorweg M, Monaca E, Doehn M, Wappler F. The 'heparin lock': cause for iatrogenic coagulopathy. Eur J Anaesthesiol. 2006;23:50-3 EXTEM test mildly activates haemostasis via the physiological activator tissue factor. The result is influenced by extrinsic coagulation factors, platelets and fibrinogen. EXTEM is a screening test for the (extrinsic) haemostasis system. This assay is not influenced by heparin (heparin inhibitor included in the EXTEM reagent). It is used for therapeutic decisions regarding the administration of fresh frozen plasma, coagulation factors, fibrinogen or platelets. EXTEM is also the base activator for FIBTEM and APTEM. FIBTEM test is an EXTEM based assay for the fibrin part of the clot. FIBTEM eliminates the platelet contribution of clot formation by inhibiting the platelets irreversibly with cytochalasin D, a potent inhibitor of actin polymerization which disrupts actin microfilaments, an essential part of a cytoskeleton- mediated contractibility apparatus of the platelet. The use of cytochalasin is more favorable than using glycoprotein IIb/ IIIa inhibitors which block platelet incompletely, especially at higher platelet counts.Lang T, Toller W, Gütl M, Mahla E, Metzler H, Rehak P, März W, Halwachs-Baumann G. Different effects of abciximab and cytochalasin D on clot strength in thrombelastography. J Thromb Haemost. 2004;2:147-53. FIBTEM allows for the detection of fibrinogen deficiency or fibrin polymerization disorders, e.g. induced by certain plasma expanders, and may identify rapidly the need to substitute fibrinogen. FIBTEM results correlate well in many cases with the Clauss fibrinogen assay, but is additionally influenced by fibrin polymerization disorders which cannot reliably be detected with clotting tests. APTEM test is an EXTEM based assay in which fibrinolysis is inhibited by aprotinin in the reagent. A significant improvement of the clot in APTEM compared to EXTEM allows to detect fulminant hyperfibrinolysis. Therefore, the test helps in identifying the necessity of administrating antifibrinolytic drugs. Furthermore, APTEM enables the estimation if an antifibrinolytic therapy alone normalizes coagulation or if additional measures have to be taken (e.g. administration of fibrinogen or platelets). Quality control Quality control is an important requirement in laboratory and POC testing. An automatic internal electronic control procedure is implemented in the ROTEM whole blood analyzer. Furthermore, biological control materials at 2 different levels are available and should be used in order to document quality and validity of results. Clinical application TEM is successfully used in the near patient assessment of haemostasis. The method allows detection of complex haemostasis disorders (available in most coagulopathies) within a few minutes and thus enables rapid therapeutic intervention. Whole blood TEM is sensitive to haemostasis affecting agents such as plasma expanders or acidosis while the effects of these agents are hardly identified by plasma based laboratory tests. TEM-guided transfusion of blood products or factor concentrates in cardiac, hepatic and major orthopedic surgery is the main application of the method. Moreover, it is successfully used in the complex situation of (poly)trauma, or in decision making for of alternative therapy such as antifibrinolytic drug administration . The clinical benefits of TEM have resulted in major savings and publications recommend that viscoelastic methods such as TEM should be used in surgical procedures where major blood loss followed by the need for transfusions can be expected.Craig J, Aguiar-Ibanez R, et al. The clinical cost effectiveness of thrombelastography/-elastometry. HTA-Programme: Health Technology Assessment Report 11. NHS Quality Improvement Scotland 2008 Limitations of TEM Like any other haemostasis evaluating method, TEM (and thrombelastography) have limitations which need to be considered when interpreting the results. The typical assays are not responsive for the effect of von Willebrand factor or platelet antagonists such as aspirin or thienopyridines (e.g. clopidogrel), and only supratherapeutic doses of GPIIb/IIIa antagonists may influence results. The sensitivity for coagulation factor deficiencies, including those induced by oral anticoagulation, is less pronounced as compared to clotting assays. Therefore, TEM is not meant to replace laboratory assays such as prothrombin time (PT) or factor assays. However, due to the rapid availability of differential diagnostic information, TEM has become an established method in surgical procedures where blood losses can be expected.

Robert Henry Clive (15 January 1789 – 20 January 1854) was a British Conservative Party politician.  Biography  Clive was born in the parish of St George's, Hanover Square, London, a younger son of Edward Clive, 1st Earl of Powis, son of Robert Clive, 1st Baron Clive (\\"Clive of India\\"). His mother was Lady Henrietta, daughter of Henry Herbert, 1st Earl of Powis. Edward Herbert (ne Clive), 2nd Earl of Powis, was his elder brother. History of Parliament Online article. He was educated at Eton College and was at St John's College, Cambridge from 1807 to 1809, when he graduated M.A.. He was awarded an honorary LL.D. in 1835. Clive sat as Member of Parliament for Ludlow from 1818 to 1832 (alongside his brother, then known as Viscount Clive) and for Shropshire South from 1832 to 1854. An agricultural landowner in Shropshire, Worcestershire, and Wales, he was an advocate of the abolition of the Corn Laws during Sir Robert Peel's administration. He was appointed to the commission investigating the Rebecca Riots in south Wales in October 1843. He was also a DL and JP for the county of Shropshire and JP for Worcestershire. Clive was commissioned Captain in the South Shropshire Militia in 1809. He was later in the South Shropshire Yeomanry Cavalry, commanding a troop at Bishop's Castle, from 1817 to 1828. He was Colonel commanding the Worcestershire Yeomanry from 1833 until his death. A keen antiquary, he was author of Documents Concerned with the History of Ludlow and the Lords Marchers (1841), and president of the Cambrian Archaeological Association in 1852. Clive was deputy-chairman of two early railway companies in Shropshire, the Shrewsbury and Birmingham and the Shrewsbury and Hereford Railway. It was at a directors' meeting of the latter, on 30 December 1853, that he was fatally taken ill. Family Clive married Lady Harriet, daughter of Other Windsor, 5th Earl of Plymouth, in 1819. They had several children, including Robert Windsor-Clive and George Windsor-Clive. After falling ill at a railway company directors' meeting, Clive died in Shrewsbury in January 1854, aged 65, at the nearby home of the Town Clerk. He was buried at Bromfield Parish Church, near his Oakley Park home near Ludlow. The following year the barony of Windsor, which had fallen into abeyance on his brother-in-law's death in 1833, was called out of abeyance in favour of his widow, Harriett, who became the thirteenth Baroness Windsor in her own right. She died in November 1869, aged 72, and was succeeded in the barony by her grandson, Robert Windsor-Clive, who was created Earl of Plymouth in 1905.

The gardens contain over 5,000 plant species in areas including an arboretum, an alpine garden, marsh, and collections of ferns and heath plants. Its greenhouses (600 m²) contain succulents and a good collection of carnivorous plants. The Karl Garten is patterned upon the 70th chapter of Charlemagne's \\"de Capitular villis vel curtis imperialibus\\", which specifies over 90 plants to be grown in every royal garden. The former Botanical Garden in the \\"Melatener Straße\\" is closed down. At its place you can find the university apiary now.

Such post-exposure behavior can be expressed in site visits, on-site events, conversions occurring at one or more Web sites or potentially offline: :: VTR=100*Viewthrough/Impressions :: CTR=100*Clicks/Impressions VTR is related to the popular click-through rate (CTR) measurement, but differs in that it is not an immediate measure of response - it is instead time-shifted and passive, i.e. no click is required. Also, viewthroughs lack a specific predetermined landing page since the visit can come through a direct type-in or via another click-based digital marketing channel, e.g. search, email or social media. TRR is the sum of both viewthrough and clickthrough response that resulted from the display media campaign. :: TRR=(Viewthroughs + Clicks)/Impressions The timeframe from ad exposure to subsequent response is often referred to as the lookback window or viewthrough timeframe. Typically this is set by the ad server and could be 30 days to as much as 90 days. The efficacy of this measurement is tied to cookie deletion rates and use of multiple computers. When success rate of important events like purchases (conversions) are tied to viewthrough visits this becomes the viewthrough conversion (V-CVR) rate a hotly debated metric that can be gamed by performance-oriented ad networks. :: V-CVR=Viewthrough Conversions/Viewthrough Visits TheoryThe problem with clicks= Many websites are supported by banner advertising. Digital media, search engines, social networking sites and forums sell and deliver advertising to generate revenue. Measuring the response to display advertising includes immediate response (clicks) and latent response (viewthrough), which help determine whether the advertising was successful or not. Historically, the digital advertising business has relied on the easy to measure click-through rate (CTR) typically provided by the ad server. Most ad server platforms also measure unique or reach impressions based on deduplication of browser cookies. Click-through rates have been known to be on the decline since the advent of the display banner. It has become a popular means to determine the success of display media but often underestimates brand impact, suffers from significant biases and can often be manipulated through fraud. However, not all banner ad impressions realize a benefit. Some ad impressions are never seen, some are seen and clicked while others are seen and while never clicked realize a subsequent response - this post-exposure behavior is viewthrough. A study done by online tracking and audience measurement firm Quantcast showed that there was no correlation between those who clicked on an ad and those who purchased down the line through a view-through conversion. =The problem with viewthrough= In measuring view-based conversions, there is room for manipulation. Because viewthrough conversions are tied to the setting the ad network's cookie and later matching it up via the same ad network's page tag loaded on a conversion page, less scrupulous ad networks have taken advantage of this by purchasing cheap below-the-fold ad inventory more for the purposes of dropping as many cookies as possible across as many users as possible than for showing the target audience advertiser's ads. Such a strategy is called cookie-bombing and permits ad networks to potentially take credit for more conversion events than they should. When possible it is always recommended to use a standalone analytics package though many ad networks offer this functionality and to also leverage experimental design to measure true incrementality.

Located in Lilleküla, Kristiine District, on the fringes of the Tallinn city centre, this former toy factory became in 2003 one of the main strong points for alternative un- institutionalized culture in Tallinn. Culture Factory Polymer closed in 2014. History During the Soviet era, Polymer was a toy factory. In 1993, closed this branch of activities, leaving a large building in a state of abandonment. A few years after, a group of artists, intrigued by this big empty space, decided to turn a room into a rehearsal place. Step-by-step, other artists wished to enjoy different spaces to create, to rehearse. The new owner of the building gave its agreement for necessary rearrangements and renovations. Nowadays, the factory disposes of of space, dedicated to creation and diffusion. The building aesthetics of Polymer are typical Soviet industrial style. Concrete production facilities were transferred over time to incorporate new space for living, artistic use and events, with the old flair and keeping its authenticity. The conservation of the old factory's name, \\"Polymer\\", perpetuates the memory of this historic past.Polymer website The different spaces Polymer, it is nowadays: *studios for artists, *rehearsals rooms for music bands, *a center for art courses, *two exhibition galleries, *a Media Lab, *two concert halls, *two spaces which can be converted for several kinds of events, *a bar, *and two studios for guest artists. A traditional letterpress print shop was also installed in the building; it's kept alive through realisation of posters for different organizations and animation of workshops for different publics. Activities & events Gradually, Polymer became a place for residencies and diffusion with multiple spaces, where live together about 30 artists and organizations, working on diverse artistic fields. Constituted as a non profit organization, Polymer works as a platform, as a venue for different events and activities, offering thus a new space for alternative culture in Tallinn. Public events take place every week, involving artist in residency and guest artist also, from Tallinn, Estonia and Europe. Every year in August, Polymer organizes its own festival, \\"Culture Factory Festival\\"; during 2 weeks, artists of the house open their studios and hang their art out to take some fresh air, and artists and a multitude of events from diverse universes take possession of the place: exhibition openings, concerts, film screenings, dance performances. Important is involving the audience in action through the workshops during the festival. Polymer is an organization involved in local life and open to outwards contacts.

It required minimal technical knowledge with the user selecting a simple profile relating to speed of the computer and its internet connection. The user could also select additional optimizations using a simple tabbed menu. Totalidea discontinued the product from December 2009. History FireTune was first introduced in March 2005 at v0.1 and addressed performance issues in Firefox 1 including application startup speed and overall performance issues. While expert users could do the same tuning configurations and optimizations manually this would both impractical and technically difficult for most users. Subsequent releases added additional languages to English and improved the product until v1.0 in April 2005 introduced an improved tabbed graphical interface. Subsequent releases achieved compatibility with ongoing releases of Firefox with the final FireTune v1.2 release in June 2008 being compatible with Firefox v3 Newer versions of Firefox were beginning to natively incorporate features of Firefox and achieve speed improvements. On 14 December 2009, a month before Firefox 3.6 was announced, Totalidea announced it would no longer distribute or support FireTune. According to the Totalidea website: > \\"Because the Mozilla Foundation disallows us to show the Firefox logo within > our FireTune software, we are no longer able to distribute FireTune, > otherwise we would face legal actions initiated by Mozilla. Because of that > we have removed the FireTune product from our product catalogue and do no > longer offer it for download. Downloads of FireTune from third party > websites are out of our control.\\" Totalidea went on to produce other software including Tweak-SSD, as SSD optimizer for Microsoft Windows. Configuration The user was first invited to choose from a list of profiles best describing his/her computer and internet connection configuration, such as \\"fast computer / fast connection\\", \\"slow computer / fast connection\\", etc. The add-on implemented this by updating the file user.js of Firefox configuration file to match the profile. An option existed to restore the original settings should the changes present any issues. Following the manual profile selection additional optimization settings could be enabled. This was expected to perform the performances of the browser. Reception The Clubic reviewer noticed improved performances in a review of FireTune 1.05 in June 2005. A later reviews by Clubic of FireTune 1.2 and against Firefox 3 used nearly identical wording which means it may not be reliable. A review by CNET in June 2009 using FireTune 1.2 against Firefox 3 did not notice any improvement however the CNET reviewer stated that the difference could be noticeable on an older computer or one with a slower internet connection.

In the late 1970s Aramoana was proposed as the site of a major aluminium smelter by a consortium of New Zealand-based Fletcher-Challenge, Australia's CSR Limited and Swiss firm Alusuisse. An aluminium smelter was already operating at Tiwai Point when the smelter at Aramoana was proposed. Background From its inception, the Otago Harbour Board had vested in it for harbour purposes,land on the Northern side of the Otago Harbour entrance. This included a quarry for rock to build the mole that protected the entrance; the village, originally housing workers on the mole, and later leased out for holiday homes; a large area of salt marsh; and adjacent dry-land leased out for rough grazing. After the Comalco Aluminium Smelter was opened at Bluff's Tiwai Point in 1971, Otago interests sought a similar project in 1974 on the OHB land at Aramoana. It was not well founded, and was withdrawn in the face of modest opposition. That opposition remained alert to any unusual activity on the OHB land, and when surveyors were seen on the flats over the summer of 1979-80 conservation interests began to organize what became the Save Aramoana Campaign. At the time the site was included in the Waikouaiti District Scheme, under zoning provisions of dubious legality and which a planner/economist with the campaign took to court for a declaratory judgment as to their legality. This had the effect of placing the whole project sub judice, and therefore unable to proceed. It cost $50.00 to lodge that action with the court, and when it became clear that the project would not be able to quietly proceed under the existing rules, the entire campaign for and against the smelter was thrust into the public arena. The Government, keen to use the smelter to justify the Clyde Dam as part of its \\"Think Big\\" programme, passed the National Development Act. Waikouaiti, now combined with Taieri to become Silverpeaks, brought out its own district scheme with much more legally sound provisions for industrial land use, specifically a smelter, at Aramoana. Those provisions were fought by the campaign's planner at the council level and on to the Planning Tribunal as Appeal no. 733/82, upheld by that court in decision C51/83 J.Todd and the Careys Bay Assn. v Silver Peaks County Council. The Court directed that \\" ... all reference to industrial development at Aramoana is to be deleted ... \\". While the planning and legal battles were being fought the broader field saw the campaign kept on the public stage : the declaration of the Independent State of Aramoana allowed that notional entity to issue a collector's set of stamps. with original art work donated by leading New Zealand artists for the purpose, and these raised nearly $NZ 500,000 in 1982 terms. The campaign was remarkably well funded. Several New Zealand artists were involved in the campaign in other ways, most notably Ralph Hotere, who produced the Aramoana series of paintings in response to the smelter issue. The public campaign also ensured that Government could not lightly face the serious political risk of bringing down a special Empowering Act to force the smelter through, as it had done with the Clyde High Dam. The tide had turned against Think Big, and the smelter was left to sink without trace. Pechiney had left, Alusuisse went off to look for a more congenial site in Zaire, and Aramoana saw the village made freehold and the saltmarsh gazetted as a reserve. Independent State of Aramoana Stamps issued in 1981 by Aramoana to raise funds for the anti- smelter campaign. The design was based on the painting \\"Puketotara, Twice Shy\\" by New Zealand regionalist artist, Don Binney. The smelter plan called for the destruction of the villages of Aramoana and Te Ngaru, and also threatened a local wildlife reserve. In response to this the residents of the area duly announced their secession from New Zealand on 23 December 1980, established a \\"border post\\" and \\"travelling embassy\\", printed passports, citizenship certificates and stamps, and set about using the resultant publicity to build a national grassroots campaign in opposition to the smelter. The campaign attracted the attention of artists such as Ralph Hotere, as well as conservationists and heritage researchers such as Peter Entwisle.Gibb, J. \\"Obituary: Peter Malcolm William Entwisle.\\" Otago Daily Times, 21 April 2018. The consortium was endorsed by the New Zealand Government, which initially proposed to subsidise the cost of electricity required for the smelter's operation, leading to fears that the wider population of New Zealand would be faced with significant electricity price hikes in the longer term. However, the campaign waged by Aramoana and its supporters eventually forced a government backdown, calling into question the economic viability of the project. This development combined with declining aluminium prices on world commodity markets, eventually led to the withdrawal of Alusuisse from the consortium in October, 1981. The remaining partners failed to secure additional investment capital, and eventually abandoned the project, paving the way for the peaceful reintegration of the Independent State of Aramoana back into New Zealand. The proposal is still remembered as a divisive issue.

He was born in the town of Mestia, Upper Svaneti, in Georgia's mountainous region. He studied at the Tbilisi State Academy of Arts (1968-1974), at the Faculty of Fine Arts. Religious motifs took a significant role in Parjiani’s works, which was quite unusual for a painter of the Soviet period. During 1968 and 1974 Irakli Parjiani attended the Faculty of Painting at the Tbilisi State Academy of Arts. His art holds special place in the history of the development of Georgian easel painting due to the individualism and originality of its pictorial language. Parjiani’s artistic world stands on the verge of the real and the unreal. His emotional and aesthetically immaculate compositions imbued with underlying messages and symbols, with their irradiating images and colors, are the bearers of biblical serenity enriching the scenes, quite common at first sight, with mystical mood. The characteristic conditionality of his pictorial images, the slow rhythm of compositional motives, the rich picturesqueness of waxen crayons and his virtuosic execution attach amazing figurative and colorful expressiveness to his pictures. Such mood of the as if “vanished” reality and of the ephemerality of life, present in all of his compositions, portraits or still lives, is yet particularly evidently manifested in his compositions on religious themes and his illustrations to the Gospel. This is the mood that reflects the personal life-story of the artist as well as of the eternal problem of harmonious cohabitation of man and the universe.

Background If the reflection group W corresponds to the Weyl group of a compact semisimple group K with maximal torus T, then the Kostant polynomials describe the structure of the de Rham cohomology of the generalized flag manifold K/T, also isomorphic to G/B where G is the complexification of K and B is the corresponding Borel subgroup. Armand Borel showed that its cohomology ring is isomorphic to the quotient of the ring of polynomials by the ideal generated by the invariant homogeneous polynomials of positive degree. This ring had already been considered by Claude Chevalley in establishing the foundations of the cohomology of compact Lie groups and their homogeneous spaces with André Weil, Jean-Louis Koszul and Henri Cartan; the existence of such a basis was used by Chevalley to prove that the ring of invariants was itself a polynomial ring. A detailed account of Kostant polynomials was given by and independently as a tool to understand the Schubert calculus of the flag manifold. The Kostant polynomials are related to the Schubert polynomials defined combinatorially by for the classical flag manifold, when G = SL(n,C). Their structure is governed by difference operators associated to the corresponding root system. defined an analogous basis when the polynomial ring is replaced by the ring of exponentials of the weight lattice. If K is simply connected, this ring can be identified with the representation ring R(T) and the W-invariant subring with R(K). Steinberg's basis was again motivated by a problem on the topology of homogeneous spaces; the basis arises in describing the T-equivariant K-theory of K/T. Definition Let Φ be a root system in a finite-dimensional real inner product space V with Weyl group W. Let Φ+ be a set of positive roots and Δ the corresponding set of simple roots. If α is a root, then sα denotes the corresponding reflection operator. Roots are regarded as linear polynomials on V using the inner product α(v) = (α,v). The choice of Δ gives rise to a Bruhat order on the Weyl group determined by the ways of writing elements minimally as products of simple root reflection. The minimal length for an elenet s is denoted \\\\ell(s). Pick an element v in V such that α(v) > 0 for every positive root. If αi is a simple root with reflection operator si : s_i x= x- 2{(x,\\\\alpha_i)\\\\over (\\\\alpha_i,\\\\alpha_i)}\\\\alpha_i, then the corresponding divided difference operator is defined by : \\\\delta_i f = {f-f\\\\circ s_i\\\\over \\\\alpha_i}. If \\\\ell(s)=m and s has reduced expression :s=s_{i_1}\\\\cdots s_{i_m}, then :\\\\delta_s=\\\\delta_{i_1}\\\\cdots \\\\delta_{i_m} is independent of the reduced expression. Moreover :\\\\displaystyle \\\\delta_s\\\\delta_t=\\\\delta_{st} if \\\\ell(st)=\\\\ell(s)+\\\\ell(t) and 0 otherwise. If w0 is the longest element of W, the element of greatest length or equivalently the element sending Φ+ to −Φ+, then : \\\\delta_{w_0}f= {\\\\sum_{s \\\\in W} {\\\\rm det} \\\\, s \\\\, f\\\\circ s\\\\over \\\\prod_{\\\\alpha>0} \\\\alpha}. More generally :\\\\delta_{s}f={{\\\\rm det}\\\\, s \\\\, f\\\\circ s + \\\\sum_{t0, \\\\, s^{-1}\\\\alpha<0} \\\\alpha} for some constants as,t. Set :\\\\displaystyle d= W^{-1}\\\\prod_{\\\\alpha>0} \\\\alpha. and :\\\\displaystyle P_s=\\\\delta_{s^{-1}w_0} d. Then Ps is a homogeneous polynomial of degree \\\\ell(s). These polynomials are the Kostant polynomials. Properties Theorem. The Kostant polynomials form a free basis of the ring of polynomials over the W-invariant polynomials. In fact the matrix :\\\\displaystyle N_{st} =\\\\delta_s (P_t) is unitriangular for any total order such that s ≥ t implies \\\\ell(s)\\\\ge \\\\ell(t). Hence :\\\\displaystyle {\\\\rm det}\\\\, N=1. Thus if : \\\\displaystyle f =\\\\sum_s a_s P_s with as invariant under W, then :\\\\displaystyle \\\\delta_t(f) = \\\\sum_s \\\\delta_t(P_s) a_s. Thus : \\\\displaystyle a_s = \\\\sum_t M_{s,t} \\\\delta_t(f), where :\\\\displaystyle M=N^{-1} another unitriangular matrix with polynomial entries. It can be checked directly that as is invariant under W. In fact δi satisfies the derivation property :\\\\delta_i(fg)=\\\\delta_i(f)g + (f\\\\circ s_i)\\\\delta_i(g). Hence :\\\\delta_i\\\\delta_s(f) = \\\\sum_t \\\\delta_i( \\\\delta_s(P_t))a_t) = \\\\sum_t (\\\\delta_s(P_t)\\\\circ s_i)\\\\delta_i(a_t) + \\\\sum_t \\\\delta_i\\\\delta_s(P_t)a_t. Since :\\\\delta_i\\\\delta_s=\\\\delta_{s_is} or 0, it follows that : \\\\sum_t \\\\delta_s(P_t)\\\\,\\\\delta_i(a_t)\\\\circ s_i=0 so that by the invertibility of N :\\\\displaystyle\\\\delta_i(a_t)=0 for all i, i.e. at is invariant under W. Steinberg basis As above let Φ be a root system in a real inner product space V, and Φ+ a subset of positive roots. From these data we obtain the subset Δ = { α1, α2, ..., αn} of the simple roots, the coroots :\\\\displaystyle \\\\alpha_i^\\\\vee=2(\\\\alpha_i,\\\\alpha_i)^{-1}\\\\alpha_i, and the fundamental weights λ1, λ2, ..., λn as the dual basis of the coroots. For each element s in W, let Δs be the subset of Δ consisting of the simple roots satisfying s−1α < 0, and put :\\\\lambda_s = s^{-1}\\\\sum_{\\\\alpha_i \\\\in \\\\Delta_s} \\\\lambda_i, where the sum is calculated in the weight lattice P. The set of linear combinations of the exponentials eμ with integer coefficients for μ in P becomes a ring over Z isomorphic to the group algebra of P, or equivalently to the representation ring R(T) of T, where T is a maximal torus in K, the simply connected, connected compact semisimple Lie group with root system Φ. If W is the Weyl group of Φ, then the representation ring R(K) of K can be identified with R(T)W. Steinberg's theorem. The exponentials λs (s in W) form a free basis for the ring of exponentials over the subring of W-invariant exponentials. Let ρ denote the half sum of the positive roots, and A denote the antisymmetrisation operator :A(\\\\psi)=\\\\sum_{s\\\\in W} (-1)^{\\\\ell(s)} s\\\\cdot \\\\psi. The positive roots β with sβ positive can be seen as a set of positive roots for a root system on a subspace of V; the roots are the ones orthogonal to s.λs. The corresponding Weyl group equals the stabilizer of λs in W. It is generated by the simple reflections sj for which sαj is a positive root. Let M and N be the matrices :M_{ts}=t(\\\\lambda_s),\\\\,\\\\,N_{st}= (-1)^{\\\\ell(t)}\\\\cdot t(\\\\psi_s), where ψs is given by the weight s−1ρ - λs. Then the matrix :B_{s,s^\\\\prime}=\\\\Omega^{-1}(NM)_{s,s^\\\\prime}={A(\\\\psi_s\\\\lambda_{s^\\\\prime})\\\\over \\\\Omega} is triangular with respect to any total order on W such that s ≥ t implies \\\\ell(s)\\\\ge \\\\ell(t). Steinberg proved that the entries of B are W-invariant exponential sums. Moreover its diagonal entries all equal 1, so it has determinant 1. Hence its inverse C has the same form. Define :\\\\varphi_s=\\\\sum C_{s,t}\\\\psi_t. If χ is an arbitrary exponential sum, then it follows that :\\\\chi=\\\\sum_{s\\\\in W} a_s \\\\lambda_s with as the W-invariant exponential sum : a_s ={A(\\\\varphi_s\\\\chi)\\\\over \\\\Omega}. Indeed this is the unique solution of the system of equations :t\\\\chi=\\\\sum_{s\\\\in W} t(\\\\lambda_s)\\\\,\\\\,a_s=\\\\sum_s M_{t,s}a_s.

Arriving at night, he finds a party is in progress, and he is invited to stay by Eve (Wetherell), the niece of the owner of the house. His sleep is restless and strange dreams of ritual sacrifice disturb him. Enquiring about his brother, he is assured by the house owner, Morley (Lee), that the man is not there. Manning's suspicions are aroused by nightmarish hallucinations. Occult expert Professor Marsh (Karloff) informs Manning about a witchcraft cult led by Morley's ancestor, Lavinia (Steele). The cult is discovered to still be active. Craxted Lodge is burned to the ground, and the head of the cult is consumed in the flames.

Nothing else in The Crimson Cult comes close to him—though there is Barbara Steele in greenface playing Lavinia, a glamorous 300-year-old and a monumental cast that lists no fewer than seven-party girls, plus several sacrificial virgins.\\" Variety wrote that as one of Karloff's final pictures, \\"it would have been nice if it had been a better role. As it is, it is a totally unabashed rehash of a formula that Karloff has been identified with through the years.\\" Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times called the film \\"a delight for horror fans, with Karloff in top form despite the infirmities of age.\\"Thomas, Kevin (April 17, 1970). \\"A Double Bill of Shockers\\".

Career Donaldson's paintings document the political and environmental issues facing the continent and his painting style incorporates several techniques including realism and impressionism. His work in pastel is the most recognized of his oeuvres; however, recent works in oil and mixed media have also seen great success amongst collectors worldwide. His use of a wide palette and texture gives a sense that the works were painted using the red soil of Africa. Donaldson has been featured in four books, participated in numerous one man shows and group exhibitions throughout Europe and the Americas, and sold his works in several auction houses. Donaldson's passion for the wildlife of Africa led him to write a book \\"Africa, An Artist's Journal\\" detailing his travels and experiences that give him the reference for his beautiful paintings.

The company was founded in 1962 by Cecil Duckworth as Worcester Engineering Co Ltd in Worcester, England. After changing its name to Worcester Heat Systems Ltd, in 1992 the company was acquired by Robert Bosch GmbH, adopting the new name of Worcester Bosch The headquarters is in Warndon. The company employs more than 2,000 people across the headquarters and manufacturing plants in Worcester and Clay Cross, Derbyshire, including a network of over 300 service engineers and over 80 technically trained field sales managers. History The company was founded by Cecil Duckworth in 1962 as Worcester Engineering Co Ltd, based at the Old Vinegar works in Worcester. Worcester's early success is attributed to the pioneering of combination boilers in the UK, further successful performance in the UK heating market led to the expansion and relocation of the factory to its current headquarters in Warndon in 1990. Continued growth was followed by the acquisition by Robert Bosch GmbH in 1992, with the company changing its name to 'Worcester, Bosch Group'. As part of Bosch's thermotechnology subsidiary, Worcester is a brand of Bosch Thermotechnology Ltd, the collective name that refers to Worcester, Bosch Group and Buderus (acquired by Bosch in 2003). Whilst Worcester's origins lie in oil and gas boilers, recent years have seen the company champion renewable technologies such as solar water heating, ground source and air source heat pumps. The company runs schemes such as the Environment 2020 awards to reward and promote energy efficiency and reinforce their commitment to being an \\"environmentally responsible manufacturer\\". Worcester has been awarded the Royal Warrant by Her Majesty the Queen for supplying hot water products to the Royal Family. Worcester Bosch Group were a founding sponsor of the Upton Blues Festival, but in 2009 reluctantly pulled out. Worcester have recently teamed up with the Scout Association to sponsor their cub scout Global Challenge badge which helps children to understand the complexities of energy conservation throughout the world. The Company and their products have also been independently recognised by the UK's largest consumer body, Which?, who awarded 'Best Buy' awards in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2014 to products in Worcester's Gas range. The summary of the 2014 Which? Boiler Report stated \\"Worcester continues to be the best gas- fired boiler brand. Its customers are the happiest of any brand's customers in our survey, with a great customer score of 89%. Its boilers also stand the best chance of remaining fault free, compared with the 12 rival gas boiler brands included in our survey.\\" The company has strong connections to the Worcester Warriors Rugby club through Chairman and founder Cecil Duckworth CBE, and that was renewed in 2010 when Worcester, Bosch Group was named as the Warriors new shirt sponsor up to the 2012-13 season. Product portfolio Worcester's product portfolio covers seven technologies: * Boilers fired by natural gas, heating oil and liquefied petroleum gas * Solar water heating * Geothermal heat pumps * Air to air heat pumps * Air to water heat pumps Worcester's gas, oil and LPG ranges consist of high efficiency regular boilers, combination boilers and system boilers; these are wall-hung, floor- standing or externally sited. Worcester's solar water heating range was released in 2005, with the ground source heat pump range being released in 2007 and the air source heat pump range being released in 2008.  Installation  Worcester operates a loyalty scheme known as the Worcester Accredited Installer scheme. Worcester Accredited Installers \\"specialise in Worcester products and can offer extended warranties\\" and benefit from features such as the online 'Find an Installer' search. Worcester Accredited Installers are experienced in fitting Worcester products but are not employed by Worcester. Worcester specifies that all members of the Worcester Accredited Installer scheme are Gas Safe Registered. Environment 2020 Another notable scheme from Worcester is the Environment 2020 awards, which are \\"intended to celebrate and promote activities dedicated to conserving the environment for future generations.\\" These consist of a children's art competition, a self- build competition and an installation competition. Once a year the company holds an awards day at Worcester's headquarters in Warndon to present the annual winners with their awards. Relocation plans It has been announced in the local and national press that the company has applied for planning permission to relocate its Warndon headquarters to a new site near junction 6 of the M5. This land is part of the Green Belt. An interview with Paul Middlebrough, leader of the Wychavon District Council in the Worcester News provided some support for the proposed move; \\"Strategically, Wychavon recognises the absolute necessity to retain Bosch and formulate its expansion in the Worcester area. In this difficult and probably deteriorating time, the fact that Bosch are going to expand is good for everybody. The proposal will provide opportunities for more employees to move into a prime location, which places us in a good position to promote jobs for local people as the economy recovers.\\" Recent problems In May 2018, the company experienced a data breach that inadvertently revealed the home addresses of “tens of thousands” of customers.

Warren signed his first record deal with Heavenly Recordings at the height of Britpop in 1996, as one third of The Hybirds.* In 1999 when the band split, he branched out on his own and away from guitar-led pop, signing to Mute Records as Echoboy after Daniel Miller heard his releases on Earworm Records following his self-released 12\\" Flashlegs (Suite). Warren went on to release several self-produced solo albums on Mute as well as Giraffe, which was produced by Flood, and having put together a band he toured extensively with, amongst others, Elastica, Add N to (X) and Broadcast. Both Echoboy and The Hybirds performed several sessions for John Peel's radio show.* Warren is also known for producing and remixing for other artists (see below). In 2003 he was asked by Jason Pierce to play bass guitar in Spiritualized, with whom he toured throughout 2003-05. He also played bass on and co-engineered the band's 2008 album Songs in A&E.; In 2005/06, Warren released a set of five limited edition 7\\" singles under the pseudonym Modlang. During 2005–2009 he played guitar with both Starsailor and Soulsavers with Mark Lanegan, playing guitar on the 2009 Starsailor album All the Plans and on the Soulsavers albums It's Not How Far You Fall, It's the Way You Land and Broken. He also co-wrote two of the songs on Broken. In 2008 Warren formed The Cold Light of Day, releasing the limited edition EP Flesh and Blood in April 2009. In October 2009 he left The Cold Light of Day to pursue other projects and released a solo album Laments in July 2010, which made it into the NME's '50 best albums of the year so far' list. His next album, The Wayfarer was released on 17 October 2011. An alternative 'stripped down' mix of the album was issued as a cover-mount on the autumn double edition (no.78/79) of Bucketfull of Brains and nine short films containing these 'stripped down' mixes were made to accompany the album. Jarvis Cocker said on his BBC Radio 6 Music radio show (1 January 2012), that The Wayfarer was 'one of my fave albums that came out last year'. Warren's third solo album Rich Black Earth was released on 4 November 2013. During 2014 Warren worked on a project called Kings of the South Seas with Ben Nicholls (Dennis Hopper Choppers, The Full English (folk music archive)) and Evan Jenkins (Neil Cowley Trio). The album Kings of the South Seas was released on 17 November 2014. He also played guitar with Samantha Crain on some of her UK shows during the summer of 2014. Warren's 4th solo album Disentangled was released on Hudson Records on 15 September 2017. Franklin, the second album by Kings of the South Seas, was released on 2 February 2018.

The museum houses one of the world's most extensive collections of memorabilia, letters, manuscripts, and paintings relating to Keats and Shelley, as well as Byron, Wordsworth, Robert Browning, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Oscar Wilde, and others. It is located on the second floor of the building situated just to the south of the base of the Spanish Steps and east of the Piazza di Spagna.  History  In November 1820, the English poet John Keats, who was dying of tuberculosis, came to Rome at the urging of friends and doctors who hoped that the warmer climate might improve his health. He was accompanied by an acquaintance, the artist Joseph Severn, who nursed and looked after Keats until his death at age twenty-five on 23 February 1821, in this house.\\"John Keats\\" by Robert Gittings, Penguin, 2001 The walls were initially scraped and all things remaining in the room immediately burned (in accordance with the health laws of 19th century Rome) following the poet’s death.Against Oblivion, the Life of Joseph Severn by Sheila Birkenhead, The MacMillan Company 1944 The effort to purchase and restore the two-room apartment in which Keats spent his final days began in 1903 at the instigation of the American poet Robert Underwood Johnson.Remembered Yesterdays by Robert Underwood Johnson, George Allen & Unwin ltd, 1924 Assisted by interested parties representing America, England, and Italy, the house was purchased late in 1906 and dedicated in April 1909 for use by the Keats–Shelley Memorial Association. The rooms then became known as the Keats–Shelley House. During World War II, the Keats–Shelley House went \\"underground\\", especially after 1943, in order to preserve its invaluable contents from falling into the hands of, and most likely being deliberately destroyed by, Nazi Germany. External markings relating to the museum were removed from the building. Although the library's 10,000 volumes were not removed, two boxes of artifacts were sent to the Abbey of Monte Cassino in December 1942 for safekeeping. In October 1943, the abbey's archivist placed the two unlabelled boxes of Keats–Shelley memorabilia with his personal possessions so that they could be removed during the abbey's evacuation and not fall into the hands of the Germans. The items were reclaimed by the museum's curator and returned to the Keats–Shelley House, where the boxes were reopened in June 1944 upon the arrival of the Allied forces in Rome. Architecture The building at Piazza di Spagna 26 was remodelled as part of the project to build the Spanish Steps in 1724–25. The project was designed by Francesco de Sanctis, who wanted to frame the steps with an identical building on either side.

The original members were Howard Raucous (real name Howard Piperides) on vocals, Beaker (real name Giles Brett) on guitar, Andy Young (guitar), Moff (real name Mark Moffat) on Double Bass, and Wolf (real name John Basford) on drums. The band members have formerly made up Loughborough bands The Exorcists and The Go-Go Dakotas. The original line-up recorded a vinyl 7\\" EP called \\"The Go-Katz EP\\" released on Raucous Records in 1987. They also issued several tracks on psychobilly compilation albums from Raucous, Kix 4U Records (Netherlands) and Rockhouse Records (Netherlands). The original lineup disbanded in 1988, when Beaker and Wolf departed, and new drummer Dave Fawkes was brought in. Under this line-up, which lasted until 1990, they released tracks on Raucous Records (UK) and Fury Records (UK). Reformation After more than a decade of inactivity, the Go-Katz resurfaced in 2003 in St Petersburg, Russia, with founder member Howard Raucous backed by members of Russian surf/psychobilly band The Bombers. With this line-up they occasionally gigged in St Petersburg and recorded \\"When A Stranger Calls\\", a cover of a Meteors song for the tribute album \\"Sympathy For The Devil\\". Meanwhile, interest in 1980s psychobilly bands increased, leading to a UK reformation in 2005, again with Howard Raucous being the only original member, with musicians from rockabilly trio The Top Cats drafted in. This lineup lasted until 2010 to play psychobilly events around Europe. The band had another two-year break, before reforming once again for one gig in 2012, with new members Sam Woods (ex-Hyperjax) on guitar and Tim Psykes on drums, which was followed by another two-year period of inactivity. The Go-Katz returned again in October 2014, with Steve Clark back on drums, and new guitarist Hollie Vee Lucas.

It was offered with the familiar B series petrol engine in 1622cc form. Claimed power output was 49 bhp, with a compression ratio of 7.2:1. The van was rated on a gross-weight basis rather than on the more familiar (for UK buyers at the time) load carrying capability. The number '250' in its name was intended to indicate a gross loaded weight of 2½ imperial (British) tons, implying a substantial carrying capacity of 22 cwt. When road tested by Britain's Autocar magazine, a 250 JU vehicle converted into a 4,180 lb motor home achieved a maximum speed of 58 mph (93 km/h). The testers thought the van a big improvement over the J2 which it replaced, but found it remained \\"clumsy to drive\\" with the \\"need for constant expertise to overcome its faults\\": engine noise, especially above 40 mph (64 km/h) was a particular source of criticism. Following the formation of the British Leyland Motor Corporation in 1968, into which BMC, by then a subsidiary of British Motor Holdings, had been absorbed, the van was branded as the BMC 250 JU. It was then rebadged again in 1970 as the 'Austin Morris 250 JU', finally ending production in the wake of the Leyland Sherpa, with which it shared some components, in 1974. In addition to the standard panel vans, 250 JU chassis were also made available to specialist manufacturers for conversion into motor homes Neither the development nor the marketing of the van appears to have been prioritized by its manufacturers. It was comfortably outsold even on its home market by competitor vehicles such as, primarily, the front engined Ford Transit and the by now ageing Bedford CA . It also fell short of the more modest market place performance of British Leyland's own slightly more compact Morris J4.

Gravitaxis is one of the many forms of taxis. It is characterized by the movement of an organism in response to gravitational forces. It is sometimes called geotaxis. There are a few different causes for gravitaxis. Many microorganisms have receptors like statocysts that allow them to sense the direction of gravity and to adjust their orientation accordingly. However, gravitaxis can result also from a purely physical mechanism so that organs for sensing the direction of gravity are not necessary. An example is given by microorganisms with a center of mass that is shifted to one end of the organism. Similar to a buoy, such mass- anisotropic microorganisms orient upwards under gravity. It has been shown that even an asymmetry in the shape of microorganisms can be sufficient to cause gravitaxis. Gravitaxis is different from gravitropism in a way that the latter is more about the growth response of an organism to gravity. Taxis Taxis is a behavioral response of a cell or an organism to an external stimulus. The movement is characteristically directional. The movement may be positive or negative. A positive taxis is one in which the organism or a cell gravitates towards the source of stimulation (attraction). A negative taxis is when the organism or a cell moves away from the source of stimulation (repulsion). Examples It can be seen in many microorganisms including Euglena. The response of planktonic larvae of Lithodes aequispinus (king crab) to gravity is another example of gravitaxis. They show both positive and negative gravitaxes in a way that they move either upward (negative) or downward (positive). Gravitaxis can also be observed in Drosophila. Etymology The term is coined from gravi- meaning gravity, and taxis or the movement of an organism in response to a stimulus.

Three of them were set up in 1790 by the National Constituent Assembly: * the contribution foncière, on all lands ; * the contribution mobilière, on all income not derived from commerce or 'land' (with the latter including rent and industry) * the patente, which taxed the professions according to their external signs The fourth, the impôt sur les portes et fenêtres (comparable to the British window tax) was set up in 1798 by the French Directory.

The French chasseurs were broken and forced into the River Esla; their commanding officer, General Lefebvre-Desnouettes, was captured. The action was the first major incident in the British army's harrowing retreat to the coast and ultimate evacuation by sea. Background An officer of the Chasseurs à cheval of the Guard by Théodore Géricault, c.1812Copy of an 1808 French map which shows the relative position of river Esla, Benavente and Castrogonzalo.Henry, Lord Paget, commander of the British cavalryGeneral Lefebvre-Desnouettes.Charles Stewart Sir John Moore led a British army into the heart of northwestern Spain with the aim of aiding the Spanish in their struggle against the French occupation. However, Napoleon had entered Spain at the head of a large army in order to retrieve French fortunes. This, together with the fall of Madrid to the French, made the position of the British army untenable. The British army had begun their retreat and were being pursued by the main French army led by Napoleon; the cavalry under Henry, Lord Paget were performing an effective screening role to cover them. On Christmas Day the 10th Hussars had taken 100 enemy cavalrymen prisoner, and on 27 December the 18th Hussars had been attacked no less than six times, on each occasion they countercharged successfully. On the 28th the British cavalry were acting as a rearguard posted on the River Esla, to cover the army's withdrawal to Astorga.Anglesey, p.84. ;Forces The French force consisted of four squadrons of the Chasseurs à cheval of the Imperial Guard, plus a number of Mamelukes of the Imperial Guard.Fletcher, p. 96 The British forces were drawn from the brigades of John Slade: 10th Hussars and the 18th Hussars and of Charles Stewart (later took the surname Vane): pickets of the 7th Hussars and 3rd Hussars of the King's German Legion (KGL).Fletcher, p. 97 Battle Outlying pickets of the British cavalry were stationed along the western bank of the River Esla, which was swollen with rain. The bridge at Castrogonzalo had been demolished by British engineers early on the 29th, and it was not until about 9:00 in the morning that Lefebvre-Desnouettes, a noted favourite of Napoleon, was able to ford the river with three strong squadrons of his chasseurs and a small detachment of Mamelukes.Anglesey, p.85. The French forced the outlying pickets of the British cavalry back onto the inlying picket commanded by Loftus Otway (18th Hussars). Otway charged, despite heavy odds, but was driven back for 2 miles towards the town of Benavente. In an area where their flanks were covered by walls the British, now reinforced by a troop or squadron of the 3rd Hussars KGL and commanded by Brigadier-General Stewart, counter- attacked and a confused melee ensued. The French, though temporarily driven back, had superior numbers and forced the British hussars to retreat once more, almost back to Benavente. Stewart knew he was drawing the French towards Paget and substantial numbers of British reserves.Fletcher, p.97. The French had gained the upper hand in the fight and were preparing to deliver a final charge when Lord Paget made a decisive intervention. He led the 10th Hussars, with squadrons of the 18th in support, around the southern outskirts of Benavente. Paget managed to conceal his squadrons from French view until he could fall on their left flank.Haythornthwaite, p. 46.Anglesey, p. 86. The British swords, often dulled by their iron scabbards, were very sharp on this occasion. An eyewitness stated that he saw the arms of French troopers cut off cleanly \\"like Berlin sausages.\\" Other French soldiers were killed by blows to the head, blows which divided the head down to the chin.Hibbert, p. 78. The French made a fighting withdrawal back to the river, though their squadrons were eventually broken and a running fight ensued. The chasseurs were forced into and across the river, those who were left on the western bank were either cut down or made prisoner. Lefebvre-Desnouettes' horse was injured and he could not cross the river; he was then made prisoner, either by Levi Grisdale of the 10th Hussars or Johann Bergmann of the King's German Legion hussars, opinions differed at the time.Haythornthwaite p. 47. As the chasseurs swam their horses across the river the British troopers fired on them with their carbines and pistols. The French cavalry re-formed on their side of the river and opened carbine fire on the British, though they were subsequently dispersed by the fire of British horse artillery.Anglesey, pp. 86-87. Aftermath The victory gained over the elite of the French light cavalry raised the morale of the British hussars; it underlined the moral ascendancy they had achieved over the French cavalry at the earlier Battle of Sahagún. The retreat of the British army, however, continued. Napoleon had viewed the action from a height overlooking the river;Fletcher, p. 97 his reactions were rather muted and he made light of the losses to, and humbling of, his \\"Cherished Children.\\" That evening Lefebvre-Desnouettes, who had suffered a superficial head wound, was entertained at the table of the British commander- in-chief Sir John Moore; Moore gave him his own sword to replace the one taken when he surrendered.Hibbert, pp. 78-79 The French general was imprisoned in England where he eventually broke his parole, an unpardonable sin according to English public opinion, and escaped back to France, whereupon Napoleon reinstated him to his former command of the guard chasseurs.Within the social code of the time a \\"gentleman\\", when giving his parole, pledged his honour not to escape. In return for this he was not incarcerated and allowed very considerable freedoms. According to this code, when he escaped, Lefebvre- Desnouettes dishonoured himself. In addition, Napoleon became a party to the dishonour when he did not send Lefebvre-Desnouettes back to face imprisonment.

The Strep-tag II is a synthetic peptide consisting of eight amino acids (Trp-Ser-His-Pro-Gln-Phe-Glu-Lys). This peptide sequence exhibits intrinsic affinity towards Strep-Tactin®, a specifically engineered streptavidin, and can be N- or C- terminally fused to recombinant proteins. By exploiting the highly specific interaction, Strep- tagged proteins can be isolated in one step from crude cell lysates. Because the Strep-tag elutes under gentle, physiological conditions it is especially suited for generation of functional proteins.  Development and biochemistry of the Strep-tag  Streptavidin is a tetrameric protein expressed in Streptomyces avidinii. Because of its high affinity for the vitamin h-biotin, Streptavidin is commonly used in the fields of molecular biology and biotechnology. The Strep-tag was originally selected from a genetic library to specifically bind to a proteolytically truncated \\"core\\" version of streptavidin. Over the years, the Strep-tag was systemically optimized, to permit a greater flexibility in the choice of attachment site. Further, its interaction partner, Streptavidin, was also optimized to increase peptide- binding capacity, which resulted in the development of Strep-Tactin. The binding affinity of Strep-tag to Strep-Tactin is nearly 100 times higher than to Streptavidin. The so-called Strep-tag system, consisting of Strep-tag and Strep-Tactin, has proven particularly useful for the functional isolation and analysis of protein complexes in proteome research.  The Strep-tag principle  Just like other short-affinity tags (His-tag, FLAG-tag), the Strep-tag can be easily fused to recombinant proteins during subcloning of its cDNA or gene. For its expression various vectors for various host organisms (E. coli, yeast, insect, and mammalian cells) are available. A particular benefit of the Strep- tag is its rather small size and the fact that it is biochemically almost inert. Therefore, protein folding or secretion is not influenced and usually it does not interfere with protein function. Strep-tag is especially suited for analysis of functional proteins, because the purification procedure can be kept under physiological conditions. This not only allows the isolation of sensitive proteins in a native state, but it is also possible to purify intact protein complexes, even if just one subunit carries the tag. In the first step of the Strep-tag purification cycle, the cell lysate containing Strep-tag fusion protein is applied to a column with immobilized Strep-Tactin (step 1). After the tagged protein has specifically bound to Strep-Tactin, a short washing step with a physiological buffer (e.g. PBS) removes all other host proteins (step 2). This is due to its extraordinary low tendency to bind proteins non specifically. Then, the purified Strep-tag fusion protein is gently eluted with a low concentration of desthiobiotin, which specifically competes for the biotin binding pocket (step 3). To regenerate the column, desthiobiotin is removed by application of a HABA containing solution (a yellow azo dye). The removal of desthiobiotin is indicated by a color change from yellow-orange to red (step 4+5). Finally, the HABA solution is washed out with a small volume of running buffer, thus making the column ready to use for the next purification run.  Strep-tag applications  The Strep-tag system offers a highly selective tool to purify proteins under physiological conditions. The proteins obtained are bioactive and display a very high purity (above 95%). Also, the Strep-tag system can be used for protein detection in various assays. Depending on the experimental circumstances, Strep-tag antibodies or Strep-Tactin, with an enzymatic (e.g.horseradish peroxidase (HRP), alkaline phosphatase (AP)) or fluorescence (e.g. green fluorescent protein (GFP)) marker. If high purity is required, the lysate can be purified by first using Strep-Tactin and then perform a second run using antibodies against Strep-tag. This reduces the contamination with unspecific bound proteins, which might occur in some rare scenarios. Following assays can be conducted using the Strep-tag detection system: * one-step affinity purification * Protein:protein interaction studies * Colony blot, dot blot, Western blot and ELISA * Screening for positive expression clones * Immunocytochemistry and Immunohistochemistry * Protein localization and targeting studies Because the Strep-tag is capable of isolating protein complexes, strategies for the study of protein-protein interactions can also be conducted. Another option is the immobilization of Strep-tag proteins with a specific high affinity antibody on microplates or biochips. Strep- Tag/StrepTactin system is also used in single molecule optical tweezers and AFM experiments, showing high mechanical stability comparable to the strongest noncovalent linkages currently available.Moayed F, Mashaghi A, Tans SJ (2013) A Polypeptide-DNA Hybrid with Selective Linking Capability Applied to Single Molecule Nano-Mechanical Measurements Using Optical Tweezers.

TV and Film * Ares appears in Disney's Hercules and its TV spinoff, voiced by Jay Thomas. * Ares is a regular character in the television series Xena: Warrior Princess, Hercules: The Legendary Journeys, and Young Hercules. Portrayed by Kevin Tod Smith (credited as Kevin Smith), he is scripted as a conflicted God who is torn between his passionate desire for Xena and his inherent desire to foster war and people's evil nature. The character is one of the more complex of the series. After the fall of the Olympian Gods, Ares is rendered mortal but restores his godhood along back with his sister Aphrodite after having a bite of Odin's apple through Xena's help. On the Hercules shows he was Hercules' constant antagonist. * In the Percy Jackson book series, Ares is a major antagonist in the first novel and a supporting character in the rest of the series. He, later, reappears as Mars in the spin-off series, Heroes of Olympus, and is revealed to be the father of one of the main characters, Frank Zhang. In the feature film Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief, he is portrayed by Ray Winstone. *Ares was portrayed by Daniel Sharman in the 2011 film Immortals. During the events of the film, he, along with Athena (Isabel Lucas), Poseidon (Kellan Lutz), Apollo (Corey Sevier), and Heracles (Steve Byers), are warned by Zeus (Luke Evans) not to interfere in mortal affairs as gods unless the Titans are released. However, Ares ends up defying Zeus and directly intervenes to save Theseus (Henry Cavill) from Hyperion's men, after which he and Athena provide Theseus and his companions with horses in order to reach Mount Tartarus, where the Titans have been imprisoned. However, Zeus arrives and, in a fit rage, kills Ares for disobeying him. Zeus then tells Theseus and his allies to let Ares' death be a warning to both the gods and them that they will receive no more help from the gods and he must justify the faith Zeus has in him alone. * In the short-lived television series Valentine, Ares was a businessman who went by the name Ari. Initially, he was the villain of the series. He indirectly threatened Kate, refused to give Grace a divorce, and had an antagonistic relationship with Ray. However, he had a positive, albeit awkward, relationship with his son, Danny. As the series progressed, Ari's relationship with Grace improved and he was charged with finding a weapon for his father. Unfortunately, in a battle against Bastet for that weapon, Ari was fatally wounded. Greg Ellis portrayed Ari and appeared in all eight episodes that aired. * Ares was portrayed by Edgar Ramirez in the Wrath of the Titans, sequel of Clash of the Titans. * Ares is the main antagonist in the 2009 animated film, Wonder Woman. * Ares is the main antagonist in the DC Extended Universe film, Wonder Woman. * Naga Ray/Hebitsukai Silver in Uchu Sentai Kyuranger is based on Ares.

In it, Ares runs amok and assails the city of Athens while challenging the other gods and looking for Pandora's Box to maximize his power; the other gods enlist the aid of a Spartan named Kratos (the player), former protégé of Ares, who was tricked by the god to slay his family in the past. Since Zeus forbids the gods to fight each other, Kratos searches for Pandora's Box, which gives him the power to rival a god. Ares is slain by Kratos, who takes his position as \\"God of War\\". *Ares reappears in the sequel God of War II during a flashback near the beginning. His remains are then seen in God of War III as one of Kratos' battles takes place over Ares' ice tomb. *Ares also appears in a flashback in God of War: Ghost of Sparta where it is shown that he kidnapped Kratos' brother Deimos as a prophecy foretold the demise of Olympus was to come by a marked warrior. Zeus and Ares believed the warrior to be Deimos because of his unusual birthmark, but the prophecy actually referred to Kratos, as he marked himself with a tattoo in the shape of his brother's birthmark to honor him. *Ares then appeared in God of War: Ascension, a prequel to the entire series, where it is revealed that he entered into an alliance with the Furies to overthrow Zeus and the reason he became Kratos' mentor was so that Kratos would help him conquer Olympus. Ares also had a son, Orkos, with the Fury Queen Alecto who he disowned due to not being able to meet his standards, which is also the reason why he chose to mentor Kratos instead. *Ares also appears in Ascension's multiplayer mode as one of the four gods that players can pledge their allegiance to. *Ares is featured in the tie-in comic series (2010–11) where he entered into a wager with five other Olympian gods. Each god chose a champion to seek for the Ambrosia of Asclepius (an elixir with magical healing properties), with Ares' champion being Kratos (unbeknownst to Kratos). *Ares is a playable character in the multiplayer online battle arena Smite.

Mildred Miller (born December 16, 1924) is an American classical mezzo-soprano who had a major career performing in operas, concerts, and recitals during the mid twentieth century. She was notably a principal artist at the Metropolitan Opera from 1951 through 1974. In 1978 she founded the Opera Theater of Pittsburgh, serving as the company's Artistic Director through 1999. As a performer, Miller won particular acclaim for her singing of German Lieder and recorded with, among others, conductor Bruno Walter, with whom she won a Grand Prix du Disque for Mahler's Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen. On the opera stage she became known for her portrayal of pants roles (in particular the role of Cherubino in The Marriage of Figaro), garnering the nickname \\"Legs Miller\\". She is a Gold Medal recipient from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, and holds honorary degrees from the Cleveland Institute of Music, the New England Conservatory, Bowling Green State University, and Washington & Jefferson College. Early life and career Born Mildred Müller in Cleveland, Ohio, Miller was the daughter of immigrants from Stuttgart, Germany. She attended the Cleveland Metropolitan School District and graduated from West High School in 1942. She entered the Cleveland Institute of Music (CIM) where she was a voice student of Marie Simmelink Kraft. After graduating in 1946 from the CIM, Miller entered the New England Conservatory (NEC) where she was a pupil of Marie Sundelius. While a student there she spent two summers studying opera under Boris Goldovsky at the Tanglewood Music Center. In 1946 she made her opera debut as one of the nieces in the United States premiere of Benjamin Britten's Peter Grimes at the Tanglewood Music Festival; a production which was conducted by Leonard Bernstein. She went on to perform with Goldovsky's New England Opera Theater in 1947-1948, performing in productions of Carmen and Idomeneo. After earning an Artist Diploma from the NEC in 1948, Miller studied opera in Italy for several months through the Frank Huntington Beebe Fellowship granted to her by the NEC. In 1949 she moved to her parent's native city to join the roster of singers at the Staatsoper Stuttgart where she was committed for two years. During that time she made many important debuts, including performances at the Bavarian State Opera, the Vienna State Opera, and the Edinburgh Festival. In 1951 she appeared at the Glyndebourne Festival as Preziosilla in Giuseppe Verdi's La forza del destino. In 1950 she married Wesley Posvar, a U.S. Air Force officer and World War II test pilot who was studying in Europe on a Rhodes Scholarship. The couple had previously met in High School in Cleveland but had lost touch with one another before reconnecting in Boston in 1949. Working at the Met While performing in Germany, Miller drew the attention of Rudolf Bing, then General Manager of the Metropolitan Opera. He offered her a contract with the company which she initially rejected as she felt the roles she was being offered were too small. However, he returned later with a better offer and Miller made her debut at the Met on November 17, 1951 as Cherubino in Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro with Cesare Siepi in the title role, Nadine Conner as Susanna, John Brownlee as Count Almaviva, Victoria de los Angeles as Countess Almaviva, and Fritz Reiner conducting. This was notably the first performance that the mezzo-soprano used the name \\"Mildred Miller\\", as Bing had suggested that a different name would counter any potential anti-German sentiment arising, after the World War, which might be stimulated by the German name \\"Müller\\". Miller remained committed to the Met for the next 23 years. Among the many roles she portrayed at the house were Annina and Octavian in Der Rosenkavalier, the Composer in Ariadne auf Naxos, Dorabella in Così fan tutte, Feodor in Boris Godunov, Magdalene in Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg, Meg Page in Falstaff, Nicklausse in The Tales of Hoffmann, the Page in Salome, Preziosilla, Prince Orlofsky in Die Fledermaus, Rosette in Manon, Rosina in The Barber of Seville, the Second Lady in The Magic Flute, the Second Esquire in Parsifal, Siebel in Faust, Suzuki in Madama Butterfly, and the title role in Carmen. Her final and 338th performance at the Met was on December 3, 1974 as Lola in Cavalleria rusticana with Elinor Ross as Santuzza, Harry Theyard as Turiddu, and John Nelson conducting. Other career opportunities While performing at the Met, Miller also appeared as a guest artist on the stages of many opera houses throughout the world. She was a frequent performer at the Opern- und Schauspielhaus Frankfurt from 1959-1973. She also made appearances at the San Francisco Opera, Lyric Opera of Chicago, Cincinnati Opera, San Antonio Grand Opera Festival, Pittsburgh Opera, Kansas City Opera, Fort Worth Opera, and Opera Pasadena. She was a busy recitalist as well, appearing in concerts in such venues as Carnegie Hall and the White House. She also was a regular guest on both the radio and television broadcasts of The Bell Telephone Hour and appeared several times on The Voice of Firestone and The Ed Sullivan Show. Life and career in Pittsburgh Miller and her husband moved to Pittsburgh in 1967 when Posvar was appointed President (ultimately Chancellor) of the University of Pittsburgh. The couple served as the first family of the University of Pittsburgh for nearly 25 years and shared an eclectic life of military assignments, world travel, and academic and artistic pursuits. The University of Pittsburgh continues to award an annual music scholarship in Miller's name. While in Pittsburgh, Miller established herself as a teacher and coach of singing, and as a producer and director of opera programs. In 1978 she established the Opera Theater of Pittsburgh along with Helen Knox and for many years she served as Artistic Director and a vocal coach for the company. Although she stepped down as director in 1999, she is still involved with the company. She also currently teaches at the Carnegie Mellon School of Music, and gives master classes all over the world. After more than 50 years of marriage, Miller's husband died of a heart attack in 2001. The couple had three children together: Wesley, Marina and Lisa.

The first signs are usually noticed in the first decade of life, and progress afterwards, with opacities developing in the cornea and attacks of pain. The condition was first described by Arthur Groenouw in 1890.Groenouw A. Knötchenförmige Hornhauttrübungen (noduli corneae). Arch Augenheilkunde. 1890;21:281–289.  Signs and symptoms  Onset occurs in the first decade, usually between ages 5 and 9. The disorder is progressive, vision changes with ageing from 2nd decade to 3rd visual impairment may seen in 4th and 5th decade severe visual impairment can be seen Minute, gray, punctate opacities develop. Corneal sensitivity is usually reduced. Painful attacks with photophobia, foreign body sensations, and recurrent erosions occur in most patients. Macular corneal dystrophy is very common in Iceland and accounts for almost one-third of all corneal grafts performed there.  Genetics  Macular corneal dystrophy is inherited in autosomal recessive fashion and is thought to be caused by the lack or abnormal configuration of keratan sulfate. Most cases of MCD are caused by mutations in CHST6 gene. The gene CHST6 is a carbohydrate sulfotransferase encoding an enzyme designated corneal N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfotransferase. In MCD type I, various mutations lead to inactivation of the enzyme, in MCD type II, inactivation is caused by large deletions and/or replacements in the gene.

Recorded largely at Harddrive Recording Studio in North Hollywood, California and Blue Iron Gate Studio in Santa Monica, California, it was primarily produced by Clif Magness, with additional production by Dave Bassett, Matt Chiaravalle and Richard Feldman. The album was released on August 13, 2002 by Medalist Entertainment and topped the US Billboard Top Blues Albums chart. Contrary to Bonamassa's 2000 debut album A New Day Yesterday, which featured a mix of original songs and cover versions, So, It's Like That is made up almost entirely of tracks written by Bonamassa and a range of collaborators. The album is the first to feature bassist Eric Czar and drummer Kenny Kramme, with producer Magness performing organ, piano and percussion. Media response to So, It's Like That was mixed, with some commentators criticising Bonamassa's songwriting. Background and release Recording for Joe Bonamassa's second studio album began at Harddrive Recording Studio in North Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, before vocals, additional guitars and keyboards were recorded at Blue Iron Gate Studio in Santa Monica, California; \\"No Slack\\" was recorded at Spike Recording Studio in New York City, New York. Production was handled primarily by Clif Magness, with Dave Bassett producing \\"Under the Radar\\" and \\"The Hard Way\\", Matt Chiaravalle producing \\"No Slack\\", and Richard Feldman producing \\"Mother Love\\". The album is Bonamassa's first to feature entirely original songs and no cover versions: with the exception of \\"Unbroken\\", which was written by Annie Roboff and Holly Lamar, all tracks were written by Bonamassa, with co-writers including Mark \\"Diesel\\" Lizotte, Mike Himelstein and Will Jennings. So, It's Like That is also Bonamassa's first album to feature bassist Eric Czar and drummer Kenny Kramme, both of whom would remain members of the guitarist and vocalist's backing band for 2003's Blues Deluxe and 2004's Had to Cry Today. The album was initially released on August 13, 2002 by Medalist Entertainment, with reissues following in 2005 from Provogue Records and 2009 from J&R; Adventures. The first 25,000 copies of the album were packaged with a two-hour DVD containing footage from Bonamassa's 2001 concert tour in promotion of his debut album A New Day Yesterday, which was later issued separately as A New Day Yesterday Live. ReceptionCommercial= So, It's Like That debuted at number 2 on the US Billboard Top Blues Albums chart in the week of August 31, 2002, just two years after Bonamassa's debut album A New Day Yesterday had debuted at number 9. The album was Bonamassa's first to top the chart when it reached number 1 later, during run spanning a total of 30 weeks. =Critical= Media response to So, It's Like That was mixed. Guitar World magazine awarded the album four out of five stars, with writer Ted Drozdowski describing it as \\"breathless\\" and praising Bonamassa's \\"strong musical personality\\" and vocal and guitar performances on the album. Billboard magazine's Chuck Taylor praised the album for its range of musical styles, including \\"down and dirty ... Southern rock paeans\\" such as \\"Lie #1\\" and \\"Sick in Love\\", and \\"melodic triumphs\\" such as \\"My Mistake\\" and \\"Unbroken\\". Taylor highlighted Bonamassa's \\"grimacing lead guitar\\" and \\"gruff vocals\\" throughout the release, concluding that \\"This is no regular Joe.\\" Miami New Times writer Shawn Bean praised the album's optimistic take on the blues as being \\"closer to daybreak than midnight in its shade of blue\\". AllMusic's Jesse Jarnow was less positive, damning Bonamassa's songwriting and claiming that the album is \\"filled with subpar tunes bloated with clichés\\". Jarnow also criticised the performance of Bonamassa's backing band members, which he dubbed \\"far too generic\\", and claimed that \\"Pain and Sorrow\\" is \\"the only thing that clearly separates Bonamassa from generic boorishness\\". Reviewing the album for The Austin Chronicle, Maragaret Moser was also critical of So, It's Like That, describing many of its songs as \\"solid but undistinguished\\", although praised Bonamassa as \\"a more than adept multi-instrumentalist\\" and offered him \\"extra credit for the heartfelt effort\\".

Duroy saves Laroche's daughter Suzanne when her horse bolts. Without introducing themselves they arrange to meet at the opera ball that evening. There, thanks to Rachel, who for a long time has been performing the song Bel Ami in a plush revue, Duroy learns the truth about Laroche's intrigues, which he publishes in his newspaper. Duroy is in love with Suzanne and divorces Madeleine to marry her. Laroche resigns, and Suzanne urges Duroy to enter politics. As minister Duroy prevents his former boss Walter from continuing the crooked intrigues of Laroche. He takes leave of his former wife Madeleine, Rachel and Frau von Marelle, in order to devote himself to his marriage with Suzanne. Political context The film was made on the eve of the outbreak of the Second World War, at the time when Germany's going to war against France was already a very likely prospect. In Nazi Germany, the film industry was closely controlled by the Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels. While Bel Ami was not conceived as an outright propaganda film, the theme of corruption in the French society and politics - prominently present in the Maupassant original - was well suited to the thrust of Nazi propaganda at the time the film was made.  Other film references  In the film It Was Always So Nice With You (1954) Willi Forst plays a film director who together with two musicians (played by Georg Thomalla and Heinz Drache), composes the lyrics of the hit song Bel Ami, which finally he sings.  DVD publication  The film is listed in the printed edition of the \\"Lexikon des internationalen Films\\", 1987, with a runtime of 100 minutes and an age restriction of 16 and over. The DVD published by Kinowelt in 2007 contains a version about 2 minutes shorter and free to the over-12s.

DEL is used in medicinal chemistry to bridge the fields of combinatorial chemistry and molecular biology. The aim of DEL technology is to accelerate the drug discovery process and in particular early phase discovery activities such as target validation and hit identification. DEL technology involves the conjugation of chemical compounds or building blocks to short DNA fragments that serve as identification bar codes and in some cases also direct and control the chemical synthesis. The technique enables the mass creation and interrogation of libraries via affinity selection, typically on an immobilized protein target. A homogeneous method for screening DNA-encoded libraries has recently been developed which uses water-in-oil emulsion technology to isolate, count and identify individual ligand-target complexes in a single- tube approach. In contrast to conventional screening procedures such as high- throughput screening, biochemical assays are not required for binder identification, in principle allowing the isolation of binders to a wide range of proteins historically difficult to tackle with conventional screening technologies. So, in addition to the general discovery of target specific molecular compounds, the availability of binders to pharmacologically important, but so-far “undruggable” target proteins opens new possibilities to develop novel drugs for diseases that could not be treated so far. In eliminating the requirement to initially assess the activity of hits it is hoped and expected that many of the high affinity binders identified will be shown to be active in independent analysis of selected hits, therefore offering an efficient method to identify high quality hits and pharmaceutical leads.  DNA-encoded chemical libraries and display technologies  Until recently, the application of molecular evolution in the laboratory had been limited to display technologies involving biological molecules, where small molecules lead discovery was considered beyond this biological approach. DEL has opened the field of display technology to include non-natural compounds such as small molecules, extending the application of molecular evolution and natural selection to the identification of small molecule compounds of desired activity and function. DNA encoded chemical libraries bear resemblance to biological display technologies such as antibody phage display technology, yeast display, mRNA display and aptamer SELEX. In antibody phage display, antibodies are physically linked to phage particles that bear the gene coding for the attached antibody, which is equivalent to a physical linkage of a “phenotype” (the protein) and a “genotype” (the gene encoding for the protein ). Phage-displayed antibodies can be isolated from large antibody libraries by mimicking molecular evolution: through rounds of selection (on an immobilized protein target), amplification and translation. In DEL the linkage of a small molecule to an identifier DNA code allows the facile identification of binding molecules. DEL libraries are subjected to affinity selection procedures on an immobilized target protein of choice, after which non-binders are removed by washing steps, and binders can subsequently be amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and identified by virtue of their DNA code (e.g.by DNA sequencing). In evolution-based DEL technologies (see below) hits can be further enriched by performing rounds of selection, PCR amplification and translation in analogy to biological display systems such as antibody phage display. This makes it possible to work with much larger libraries.  History  “Synthesize a multi-component mixture of compounds in a single process and screen it also a single process”. This is the principle of combinatorial chemistry invented by Prof. Furka Á. (Eötvös Loránd University Budapest Hungary) in 1982, and described it including the method of synthesis of combinatorial libraries and that of a deconvolution strategy in a document notarized in the same year.Furka Á. Tanulmány, gyógyászatilag hasznosítható peptidek szisztematikus felkutatásának lehetőségéről. Study on the possibility of systematic searching for pharmaceutically useful peptides) https://mersz.hu/mod/object.php?objazonosito=matud202006_f42772_i2 Motivations that led to the invention had been published in 2002.Furka Á (2002). Combinatorial Chemistry 20 years on.., Drug DiscovToday 7; 1-4. DELs are DNA encoded combinatorial libraries (DECLs) and the combinatorial principle clearly prevails in their application. Fig. 1 DNA-encoded library displaying chemical compounds Schematic representation of DNA-encoded library displaying chemical compounds directly attached to oligonucleotides. a) Library generated by “stepwise combinatorial” assembling presenting a single oligonucleotide covalently linked to a putative binding molecule. b) Library construct in “combinatorial self-assembling” fashion (Encoded Self-Assembling Chemical library). Multiple pairing oligonucleotides display a covalently linked binding molecule The concept of DNA-encoding was first described in a theoretical paper by Brenner and Lerner in 1992 in which was proposed to link each molecule of a chemically synthesized entity to a particular oligonucleotide sequence constructed in parallel and to use this encoding genetic tag to identify and enrich active compounds. In 1993 the first practical implementation of this approach was presented by S. Brenner and K. Janda and similarly by the group of M.A. Gallop. Brenner and Janda suggested to generate individual encoded library members by an alternating parallel combinatorial synthesis of the heteropolymeric chemical compound and the appropriate oligonucleotide sequence on the same bead in a “split-&-pool”-based fashion (see below). Since unprotected DNA is restricted to a narrow window of conventional reaction conditions, until the end of the 1990s a number of alternative encoding strategies were envisaged (i.e. MS- based compound tagging, peptide encoding, haloaromatic tagging, encoding by secondary amines, semiconductor devices.), mainly to avoid inconvenient solid phase DNA synthesis and to create easily screenable combinatorial libraries in high-throughput fashion. However, the selective amplificability of DNA greatly facilitates library screening and it becomes indispensable for the encoding of organic compounds libraries of this unprecedented size. Consequently, at the beginning of the 2000s DNA-combinatorial chemistry experienced a revival. The beginning of the millennium saw the introduction of several independent developments in DEL technology. These technologies can be classified under two general categories: non-evolution-based and evolution-based DEL technologies capable of molecular evolution. The first category benefits from the ability to use off the shelf reagents and therefore enables rather straightforward library generation. Hits can be identified by DNA sequencing, however DNA translation and therefore molecular evolution is not feasible by these methods. The split and pool approaches developed by researchers at Praecis Pharmaceuticals (now owned by GlaxoSmithKline), Nuevolution (Copenhagen, Denmark) and ESAC technology developed in the laboratory of Prof D. Neri (Institute of Pharmaceutical Science, Zurich, Switzerland) fall under this category. ESAC technology sets itself apart being a combinatorial self- assembling approach which resembles fragment based hit discovery (Fig 1b). Here DNA annealing enables discrete building block combinations to be sampled, but no chemical reaction takes place between them. Examples of evolution-based DEL technologies are DNA-routing developed by Prof. D.R. Halpin and Prof. P.B. Harbury (Stanford University, Stanford, CA), DNA-templated synthesis developed by Prof. D. Liu (Harvard University, Cambridge, MA) and commercialized by Ensemble Therapeutics (Cambridge, MA) and YoctoReactor technology. developed and commercialized by Vipergen (Copenhagen, Denmark). These technologies are described in further detail below. DNA-templated synthesis and YoctoReactor technology require the prior conjugation of chemical building blocks (BB) to a DNA oligonucleotide tag before library assembly, therefore more upfront work is required before library assembly. Furthermore, the DNA tagged BBs enable the generation of a genetic code for synthesized compounds and artificial translation of the genetic code is possible: That is the BB's can be recalled by the PCR-amplified genetic code, and the library compounds can be regenerated. This, in turn, enables the principle of Darwinian natural selection and evolution to be applied to small molecule selection in direct analogy to biological display systems; through rounds of selection, amplification and translation. Non-evolution based technologies Combinatorial libraries Combinatorial libraries are special multi- component compound mixtures that are synthesized in a single stepwise process. They differ from collection of individual compounds as well as from a series of compounds prepared by parallel synthesis. Combinatorial libraries have important features. ″ Mixtures are used in their synthesis. The use of mixtures ensures the very high efficiency of the process. Both reactants could be mixtures but for practical reasons the split-mix procedure is used: one mixture is divided into portions that are coupled with the BBs.Á. Furka, F. Sebestyén, M. Asgedom, G. Dibó, Cornucopia of peptides by synthesis In Highlights of Modern Biochemistry, Proceedings of the 14th International Congress of Biochemistry, VSP. Utrecht, The Netherlands, 1988, Vol. 5, p 47.Furka Á, Sebestyén F, Asgedom M, Dibó G ( 1991) General method for rapid synthesis of multicomponent peptide mixtures. Int J Peptide Protein Res 37; 487-93. The mixtures are so important that there is no combinatorial library without using a mixture in the synthesis, and if a mixture is used in a process inevitably combinatorial library forms. ″ Components of the libraries need to be present in nearly equal molar quantities. In order to achieve this as closely as possible the mixtures are divided into equal portions and after pooling a thorough mixing is needed. ″ Since the structure of components is unknown deconvolution methods need to be used in screening. For this reason, encoding methods had been developed. Coding molecules are attached to the beads of the solid support that record the coupled BBs and their sequence. One of these methods is encoding by DNA oligomers. ″ It is a remarkable feature of combinatorial libraries that the whole compound mixture can be screened in a single process. Since both the synthesis and screening are very efficient procedures the use of combinatorial libraries in pharmaceutical research leads to enormous savings. In solid phase combinatorial synthesis only a single compound forms in each bead. For this reason, the number of components in the library can’t exceed the number of beads of the solid support. This means that the number of components in such libraries is limited. This restraint was completely eliminated by Harbury and Halpin. In their synthesis of DELs, the solid support is omitted and BBs are attached directly to the encoding DNA oligomers.Harbury DR, Halpin DR (2000) WO 00/23458. This new approach helps to increase practically unlimitedly the number of components of DNA encoded combinatorial libraries (DECLs). = Split-&-Pool DNA Encoding = In order to apply combinatorial chemistry for the synthesis of DNA-encoded chemical libraries, a Split-&-Pool approach was pursued. Initially a set of unique DNA- oligonucleotides (n) each containing a specific coding sequence is chemically conjugated to a corresponding set of small organic molecules. Consequently, the oligonucleotide-conjugate compounds are mixed (\\"Pool\\") and divided (\\"Split\\") into a number of groups (m). In appropriate conditions a second set of building blocks (m) are coupled to the first one and a further oligonucleotide which is coding for the second modification is enzymatically introduced before mixing again. This “split-&-pool” steps can be iterated a number of times (r) increasing at each round the library size in a combinatorial manner (i.e. (n x m)r). Alternatively, peptide nucleic acids have been used to encode libraries prepared by \\"split-&-pool\\" method. A benefit of PNA-encoding is that the chemistry can be performed by standard SPPS. = Stepwise coupling of coding DNA fragments to nascent organic molecules = Fig. 3 DNA-encoded library by \\"Split-&-Pool stepwise coupling of coding DNA fragments to nascent organic molecules An initial set of multifunctional building blocks (FGn represents the different orthogonal functional groups) are covalently conjugated to a corresponding encoding oligonucleotide and reacted in a split-&-pool fashion on a specific functional group (FG1 in red) with a suitable collection of reagents. Following enzymatic encoding, a further round of split-&-pool is initiated. At this stage the second functional group (FG2 in blue) undergoes an additional reaction step with a different set of suitable reagents. The identity of the final modification could be ensured yet again by enzymatic DNA encoding by means of a further oligonucleotide carrying a specific coding region. A promising strategy for the construction of DNA-encoded libraries is represented by the use of multifunctional building blocks covalently conjugated to an oligonucleotide serving as a “core structure” for library synthesis. In a ‘pool-and-split’ fashion a set of multifunctional scaffolds undergo orthogonal reactions with series of suitable reactive partners. Following each reaction step, the identity of the modification is encoded by an enzymatic addition of DNA segment to the original DNA “core structure”. The use of N-protected amino acids covalently attached to a DNA fragment allow, after a suitable deprotection step, a further amide bond formation with a series of carboxylic acids or a reductive amination with aldehydes. Similarly, diene carboxylic acids used as scaffolds for library construction at the 5’-end of amino modified oligonucleotide, could be subjected to a Diels-Alder reaction with a variety of maleimide derivatives. After completion of the desired reaction step, the identity of the chemical moiety added to the oligonucleotide is established by the annealing of a partially complementary oligonucleotide and by a subsequent Klenow fill-in DNA-polymerization, yielding a double stranded DNA fragment. The synthetic and encoding strategies described above enable the facile construction of DNA-encoded libraries of a size up to 104 member compounds carrying two sets of “building blocks”. However the stepwise addition of at least three independent sets of chemical moieties to a tri- functional core building block for the construction and encoding of a very large DNA-encoded library (comprising up to 106 compounds) can also be envisaged.(Fig.2) = Combinatorial self-assembling = Encoded self- assembling chemical libraries  Fig. 4 ESAC library technology overview Small organic molecules are coupled to 5’-amino modified oligonucleotides, containing a hybridization domain and a unique coding sequence, which ensure the identity of the coupled molecule. The ESAC library can be used in single pharmacophore format (a), in affinity maturations of known binders (b), or in de novo selections of binding molecules by self assembling of sublibraries in DNA-double strand format (c) as well as in DNA-triplexes (d). The ESAC library in the selected format is used in a selection and read-out procedure (e). Following incubation of the library (i) with the target protein of choice (ii) and washing of unbound molecules (iii), the oligonucleotide codes of the binding compounds are PCR-amplified and compared with the library without selection on oligonucleotide micro-arrays (iv, v). Identified binders/binding pairs are validated after conjugation (if appropriate) to suitable scaffolds (vi). Encoded Self-Assembling Chemical (ESAC) libraries rely on the principle that two sublibraries of a size of x members (e.g. 103) containing a constant complementary hybridization domain can yield a combinatorial DNA-duplex library after hybridization with a complexity of x2 uniformly represented library members (e.g. 106). Each sub-library member would consist of an oligonucleotide containing a variable, coding region flanked by a constant DNA sequence, carrying a suitable chemical modification at the oligonucleotide extremity. The ESAC sublibraries can be used in at least four different embodiments. * A sub-library can be paired with a complementary oligonucleotide and used as a DNA encoded library displaying a single covalently linked compound for affinity-based selection experiments. * A sub- library can be paired with an oligonucleotide displaying a known binder to the target, thus enabling affinity maturation strategies. * Two individual sublibraries can be assembled combinatorially and used for the de novo identification of bindentate binding molecules. * Three different sublibraries can be assembled to form a combinatorial triplex library. Preferential binders isolated from an affinity-based selection can be PCR-amplified and decoded on complementary oligonucleotide microarrays or by concatenation of the codes, subcloning and sequencing. The individual building blocks can eventually be conjugated using suitable linkers to yield a drug-like high-affinity compound. The characteristics of the linker (e.g. length, flexibility, geometry, chemical nature and solubility) influence the binding affinity and the chemical properties of the resulting binder.(Fig.3) Bio-panning experiments on HSA of a 600-member ESAC library allowed the isolation of the 4-(p-iodophenyl)butanoic moiety. The compound represents the core structure of a series of portable albumin binding molecules and of Albufluor a recently developed fluorescein angiographic contrast agent currently under clinical evaluation. ESAC technology has been used for the isolation of potent inhibitors of bovine trypsin and for the identification of novel inhibitors of stromelysin-1 (MMP-3), a matrix metalloproteinase involved in both physiological and pathological tissue remodeling processes, as well as in disease processes, such as arthritis and metastasis.  Evolution-based technologies  DNA-routing = In 2004, D.R. Halpin and P.B. Harbury presented a novel intriguing method for the construction of DNA-encoded libraries. For the first time the DNA-conjugated templates served for both encoding and programming the infrastructure of the “split-&-pool” synthesis of the library components. The design of Halpin and Harbury enabled alternating rounds of selection, PCR amplification and diversification with small organic molecules, in complete analogy to phage display technology. The DNA-routing machinery consists of a series of connected columns bearing resin-bound anticodons, which could sequence-specifically separate a population of DNA- templates into spatially distinct locations by hybridization. According to this split-and-pool protocol a peptide combinatorial library DNA-encoded of 106 members was generated. = DNA-templated synthesis = Fig. 2 DNA-encoded library by ‘DNA-templated synthesis’A library of oligonucleotides (i.e. 64 different oligonucleotides) containing three coding regions was hybridized to a library of reagent compound-oligonucleotide conjugates (i.e. 4 reagent oligonucleotide conjugates), able of pairing with the initial coding domain of the template oligonucleotide. After transferring of the compounds on the corresponding oligonucleotide template, the synthesis cycle was repeated the desired number of times with further sets of carrier compound-oligonucleotide conjugates (i.e. two rounds with four carrier compound-oligonucleotide conjugates per round). Subsequently, functional selection was performed and the sequence of the binding template amplified by PCR. Thus, DNA-sequencing allowed the identification of the binding molecule. In 2001 David Liu and co- workers showed that complementary DNA oligonucleotides can be used to assist certain synthetic reactions, which do not efficiently take place in solution at low concentration. A DNA-heteroduplex was used to accelerate the reaction between chemical moieties displayed at the extremities of the two DNA strands. Furthermore, the \\"proximity effect\\", which accelerates bimolecular reaction, was shown to be distance-independent (at least within a distance of 30 nucleotides). In a sequence-programmed fashion oligonucleotides carrying one chemical reactant group were hybridized to complementary oligonucleotide derivatives carrying a different reactive chemical group. The proximity conferred by the DNA hybridization drastically increases the effective molarity of the reaction reagents attached to the oligonucleotides, enabling the desired reaction to occur even in an aqueous environment at concentrations which are several orders of magnitude lower than those needed for the corresponding conventional organic reaction not DNA-templated. Using a DNA- templated set-up and sequence-programmed synthesis Liu and co-workers generated a 64-member compound DNA encoded library of macrocycles.  3-Dimensional proximity-based technology (YoctoReactor technology)  The YoctoReactor (yR) is a 3D proximity-driven approach which exploits the self- assembling nature of DNA oligonucleotides into 3, 4 or 5-way junctions to direct small molecule synthesis at the center of the junction. Figure 5 illustrates the basic concept with a 4-way DNA junction. Fig. 5 Fundamental principle of the YoctoReactor. The center of 3, 4 and 5 way DNA junctions (a 4-way junction is shown here) becomes a yoctoliter-scale reactor where small molecule synthesis is facilitated in what has been termed the YoctoReactor (yR). Colored circles depict the chemical building blocks (BB) which are attached to carefully designed DNA oligonucleotides (black lines). Upon DNA annealing the BB are brought into proximity at the center of the DNA junction where they undergo chemical reaction. The center of the DNA junction constitutes a volume on the order of a yoctoliter, hence the name YoctoReactor. This volume contains a single molecule reaction yielding reaction concentrations in the high mM range. The effective concentration facilitated by the DNA greatly accelerates chemical reactions that otherwise would not take place at the actual concentration several orders of magnitude lower. = Building a yR library = Figure 6 illustrates the generation of a yR library using a 3-way DNA junction.Fig. 6 YoctoReactor library assembly. Stepwise assembly of a DEL library using YoctoReactor technology. A 3-way reactor is shown here. (a) Position 1 (P1) and P2 BB are brought into proximity and undergo a chemical reaction in the presence of a helper oligonucleotide in P3. (b) The structure is purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), the P1 and P2 DNA is ligated and the P2 linker is cleaved. (c) P3 BB is annealed to the P1-P2 ligation product from step b, and a chemical reaction between P2 and P3 BBs takes place. (d) The reaction product is purified by PAGE, the DNA is ligated and P3 linker is cleaved yielding a compound (OOO) covalently attached to the folded yR. (e) The yR is dismantled by primer extension yielding a double-stranded display product exposing the reaction product for selection and molecular evolution. In summary, chemical building-blocks (BB) are attached via cleavable or non- cleavable linkers to three types of bispecific DNA oligonucleotides (oligo- BBs) representing each arm of the yR. To facilitate synthesis in a combinatorial manner, the oligo-BBs are designed such that the DNA contains (a) the code for an attached BB at the distal end of the oligo (colored lines) and (b) areas of constant DNA sequence (black lines) to bring about the self- assembly of the DNA into a 3-way junction (independently of the BB) and the subsequent chemical reaction. Chemical reactions are performed via a stepwise procedure and after each step the DNA is ligated and the product purified by polyacryamide gel electrophoresis. Cleavable linkers (BB-DNA) are used for all but one position yielding a library of small molecules with a single covalent link to the DNA code. Table 1 outlines how libraries of different sizes can be generated using yR technology. Table 1. YoctoReactor library size. yR library size is a function of the number of different functionalized oligos used in each position and the number of positions in the DNA junction The yR design approach provides an unvarying reaction site with regard to both (a) distance between reactants and (b) sequence environment surrounding the reaction site. Furthermore, the intimate connection between the code and the BB on the oligo- BB moieties which are mixed combinatorially in a single pot confers a high fidelity to the encoding of the library. The code of the synthesized products, furthermore, is not preset, but rather is assembled combinatorially and synthesized in synchronicity with the innate product. = Homogeneous screening of yoctoreactor libraries = A homogeneous method for screening yoctoreactor libraries (yR) has recently been developed which uses water-in- oil emulsion technology to isolate individual ligand-target complexes. Called Binder Trap Enrichment (BTE), ligands to a protein target are identified by trapping binding pairs (DNA-labelled protein target and yR ligand) in emulsion droplets during dissociation dominated kinetics. Once trapped, the target and ligand DNA are joined by ligation, thus preserving the binding information. Hereafter, identification of hits is essentially a counting exercise: information on binding events is deciphered by sequencing and counting the joined DNA - selective binders are counted with a much higher frequency than random binders. This is possible because random trapping of target and ligand is \\"diluted\\" by the high number of water droplets in the emulsion. The low noise and background signal characteristic of BTE is attributed to the \\"dilution\\" of the random signal, the lack of surface artifacts and the high fidelity of the yR library and screening method. Screening is performed in a single tube method. Biologically active hits are identified in a single round of BTE characterized by a low false positive rate. BTE mimics the non- equilibrium nature of in vivo ligand-target interactions and offers the unique possibility to screen for target specific ligands based on ligand-target residence time because the emulsion, which traps the binding complex, is formed during a dynamic dissociation phase.  Decoding of DNA-encoded chemical libraries  Following selection from DNA-encoded chemical libraries, the decoding strategy for the fast and efficient identification of the specific binding compounds is crucial for the further development of the DEL technology. So far, Sanger-sequencing-based decoding, microarray-based methodology and high-throughput sequencing techniques represented the main methodologies for the decoding of DNA-encoded library selections. = Sanger sequencing-based decoding = Although many authors implicitly envisaged a traditional Sanger sequencing-based decoding, the number of codes to sequence simply according to the complexity of the library is definitely an unrealistic task for a traditional Sanger sequencing approach. Nevertheless, the implementation of Sanger sequencing for decoding DNA-encoded chemical libraries in high-throughput fashion was the first to be described. After selection and PCR amplification of the DNA-tags of the library compounds, concatamers containing multiple coding sequences were generated and ligated into a vector. Following Sanger sequencing of a representative number of the resulting colonies revealed the frequencies of the codes present in the DNA- encoded library sample before and after selection. = Microarray-based decoding = A DNA microarray is a device for high-throughput investigations widely used in molecular biology and in medicine. It consists of an arrayed series of microscopic spots (‘features’ or ‘locations’) containing few picomoles of oligonucleotides carrying a specific DNA sequence. This can be a short section of a gene or other DNA element that are used as probes to hybridize a DNA or RNA sample under suitable conditions. Probe-target hybridization is usually detected and quantified by fluorescence-based detection of fluorophore-labeled targets to determine relative abundance of the target nucleic acid sequences. Microarray has been used for the successfully decoding of ESAC DNA-encoded libraries and PNA-encoded libraries. The coding oligonucleotides representing the individual chemical compounds in the library, are spotted and chemically linked onto the microarray slides, using a BioChip Arrayer robot. Subsequently, the oligonucleotide tags of the binding compounds isolated from the selection are PCR amplified using a fluorescent primer and hybridized onto the DNA-microarray slide. Afterwards, microarrays are analyzed using a laser scan and spot intensities detected and quantified. The enrichment of the preferential binding compounds is revealed comparing the spots intensity of the DNA-microarray slide before and after selection. = Decoding by high throughput sequencing = According to the complexity of the DNA encoded chemical library (typically between 103 and 106 members), a conventional Sanger sequencing based decoding is unlikely to be usable in practice, due both to the high cost per base for the sequencing and to the tedious procedure involved. High throughput sequencing technologies exploited strategies that parallelize the sequencing process displacing the use of capillary electrophoresis and producing thousands or millions of sequences at once. In 2008 was described the first implementation of a high- throughput sequencing technique originally developed for genome sequencing (i.e. \\"454 technology\\") to the fast and efficient decoding of a DNA encoded chemical library comprising 4000 compounds. This study led to the identification of novel chemical compounds with submicromolar dissociation constants towards streptavidin and definitely shown the feasibility to construct, perform selections and decode DNA-encoded libraries containing millions of chemical compounds.

Van Praet par Gonnord Joseph Basile Bernard Van Praet (Bruges, 27 July 1754 – Paris, 5 February 1837) was a Flanders-born librarian and scholar active in France. LifeYouthBibliothèque nationale= During the French Revolution he increased the stock to three times its previous amount: the printed collection went from 300 000 to more than a million. After the fire at the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés (19–20 August 1794) he managed to obtain part of the stock and also made acquisitions from booksellers and in public sales. He went on to obtain complete libraries particularly in Italy. He carried on correspondence to acquire important private libraries for the Bibliothèque nationale such as those of Loménie de Brienne (1792), Panzer (1807), Count MacCarthy (1817). His role in the acquisition of collections, his long tenure at the library and his bibliographical knowledge resulted in him being often consulted about the older literature in the library. He had a particular interest in incunabula on vellum of which he compiled a bibliography. Among his acquisitions from booksellers Van Praet found many valuable works which he found it prudent to allocate to particular collections, such as books on vellum, incunabula, annotated editions, fine bindings, etc., so restabishing the concept of \\"réserve\\". He bequeathed his private collection of vellum books to the library. His 53 years as librarian were fundamental in the development of the library. Van Praet was elected a member of the Académie des inscriptions et belles-lettres 19 March 1830 and died in 1837. Sources *D.

Orthotics is an allied health care field concerned with the design, development, fitting and manufacture of orthoses. Orthoses, sometimes called braces or splints, are devices that support or correct musculoskeletal deformities and/or abnormalities of the body. Animals that might benefit from the use of an orthosis commonly have an injury to a lower limb or paw, such as a fracture, torn meniscus, ruptured Achilles tendon, or injured cruciate ligament (ACL or CCL). They may also have an orthopedic condition due to arthritis, spinal cord injury, or a congenital abnormality. Animals that have used orthoses and even prostheses (artificial limbs) include dogs, cats, horses, llamas, and an orangutan. Each animal's situation is unique and should be evaluated by a veterinarian.\\"The Ability of Mobility\\", Pet Country Magazine Orthoses can decrease pain and increase stability in an unstable joint, as well as prevent potential progression or development of a deformity or contracture. An orthosis will prevent, control or even assist the motion of a joint, depending upon how it is made. An orthosis can be made for short-term use during a post- operative healing period, for example, or for long-term, chronic use.Sherman O. Canapp Jr., DVM, et al. \\"Current Applications in Canine Orthopedic Devices: Prosthetics, Orthotics, Braces, and support systems\\" ACVS Small Animal Proceedings Symposium 2008, pp463-465 at They can provide a good quality of life for an animal that might otherwise have to be euthanized.Dr. Jim Humphries PodCast at http://www.podcastgo.com/Channel.aspx?nid=795b2078-fcf4-419e-b52d-973c0546f770&iid;=fafb4ffe- ee0e-47c7-b0c5-8cfaece5a38d&eid;=5cccea48-cd0a-4227-92f8-96c8b5382813 With a few exceptions, orthoses for animals are custom made from a cast. They are typically formed from lightweight plastic or carbon fiber material with a comfort liner inside and velcro to hold them in place. They may have solid joints or hinged joints.http://handicappedpets.com/www/index.php/help-pets- walk/dog-braces.html An orthotic differs from a prosthetic in the way that a prosthetic is completely replacing a missing limb or body part, whereas an orthotic is an external device that is meant to help support or protect a limb or body part. This can make orthotics more popular than prosthetics in the animal world because there are different conditions and factors that make animals need additional help, and a dog would be able to live a happy life with just three legs if it needed to, and could be easier for them as well. The most common and arguable helpful orthotic, especially for dogs, are booties. They have a wide range of uses for the dog including traction while getting up and or walking outside or even indoors if it is walking on a slipperier surface such as hard wood or tile flooring. It can especially help older dogs with hip issues and german shepherds who have been genetically altered in breading to have a sloped back, which causes hip issues in them genetically.it can also help dogs with different neurological conditions that make them less aware of their self-movement, this is called proprioception. Another form or orthotic is a leg brace that can help from stabilization caused from age, worn out foot bones, or something more serious like ectrodactyly. This is the deficiency of one or more central digits of the hand or foot, this causes the foot the animal is walking on to be deformed. It needs to have proper support or more serious health issues can arise in the future. When look at or constructing an orthotic for your pet for anyone of these conditions or something else there are some things that need to be considered about the actual product itself to ensure the health and wellness of your animal. These things include how the orthotic sits on the body, the material being used, and the functionality of the product. With how it sits on the body, this also goes for prosthetics for the area of attachment, you want it to be comfortable and not cause irritation to the skin. This goes hand in hand with material as well. If the skin gets irritated or damage it can have a lot more of a severe impact on you animal than if it was not wearing the orthotic at all, in some cases. This also moves into functionality, for the owner and the pet. An orthotic, or even prosthetic, needs to be monitored regularly. Orthotics need to be removed several times daily to check the condition of the skin, so for the sake of the own more so it would be better if it was easier to take on and off. This help with ease but also making sure there is no other way for irritation to the skin with removing or putting on the orthotic in a cumbersome way. It is also better for the pet if it is not such a laborious task, it will help ease their frame of mind and keep them calm during the process. For functionality it is also important to look at the product itself and how it will serve your pet. You don’t want to put an orthotic on a limb that with interfere with their daily life of range of motions. Even if it is them when they are standing, it might not function well enough when they are trying to get up from lying down; so definitely try and find something that assists them in all aspects of their life. Or at least doesn’t hinder anything. It is also important to be keeping your pets orthotic clean, this could be just from everyday activities and sweat build up that can happen, or if your pet is walking or playing outside and it happens to get more dirty that way. Depending on the orthotic it can be expensive to purchase. One more cost effective way if available to you is 3D Printing. 3D Printing is an additive manufacturing process where filament is layered on top of itself to create a three dimensional object. This differs from more traditional manufacturing processes because they are subtractive like drilling where material is being taken away to form a hole. There are free online versions of different orthotics already available to print if a more general model is suited or could be adapted to fit you and your pets needs. Also if you do not personally have access to a 3D printer your local library could offer complimentary or donation based printing to the public, just look to see who is offering what in your community. If you or someone you know is versed in how to 3D model on your computer you could also make your own custom orthotic.

The Târnave region is situated in Jidvei, Alba County.  History  Vine cultivation has millenary attestations among Romanians, Hungarians, and Saxons. Considered to be the second motherland of the Traminer, Tarnave Vineyard owes this fact to the massive colonization in the second half of the thirteenth century with Saxons from the Mosel – Rhine Valley, who founded Seiden (the German name for Jidvei). The first agricultural unit with wine-growing profile of great proportions was founded in 1949 and has developed continually, and as of the 2000s has a cultivated area of approximately 2000 hectares. The 1999 privatization of the wine-growing and fruit-growing sector and of the cellars offered the Târnave Vineyard new opportunities of development and affirmation of its capacities which led to increase exports and domestic sales.  Natural environment  The vineyard is spread on a surface of about 2000 hectares (with around 250 hectares renewed every year) and it is situated at an altitude between 200-500 meters, with most of the vineyards set on southern exposure slopes, which makes the sun rays and atmospheric circulation to favor vine cultures. The land benefits of a continental-plateau type climate with an average temperature of +9 °C (January −4 °C, July +18 °C). The moderate temperature during the grapes' maturing period determine slow oxidation reactions, helping to a continual accumulation of sugars and aromas and to a not so accentuated reduction of acidity. The soils are divided into three categories: forest brown, forest brown with different degrees of podzolisation and river-bank soils, all three types of soil enabling vine cultivation.http://www.scvblaj.ro/istoric/cadrul-natural-al-podgoriei-tarnave/ Research and Development Station for vine-growing and wine-making Blaj  Vine-growing and wine-making technologies  The production of grapes per hectare is between 3000 kilograms and 9000 kilograms per hectare with an average of around 6500 kilograms per hectare. The constant concern for increasing not only the quantity, but also the quality of the Jidvei wines was translated through an extensive investment program that began with rehabilitating the vine-growing areas - a project worth 11 million Euro - and went on with investments in modern agricultural machinery and environmental- friendly vine-growing technologies. http://www.zf.ro/zf-english/jidvei-will- invest-11m-euros-to-rehabilitate-vineyard-3089510/ Article regarding the Jidvei investment program The wine-making technologies have also been updated and, currently, the wine cellars are equipped with the latest wine-making machineries controlling every aspect of the process from fermentation to bottling. These modern technologies together with the classical methods of aging in barrels or bottles – still preserved for some products like vinars or sparkling wine – do nothing more than to supplement the micro climate of the region and the high qualification of the oenology experts giving Jidvei wines remarkable organoleptic properties proven by numerous national and international awards. http://www.foodandbar.ro/info- companii/1477-jidvei-4-medalii-de-aur-si-2-de-argint-la-vinvest-2009 Gold and silver medals for Jidvei wines at National contest  Wine sortiments  Sauvignon blanc It is a dry, semi-dry or semi-sweet wine that has always been the fame of Jidvei, both in Romania and abroad.

The grammatical gender of the word for \\"spirit\\" is feminine in Hebrew (רוּחַ, '),Jacobs, Joseph and Blau, Ludwig. \\"Holy Spirit\\", Jewish Encyclopedia, 1906 neuter in Greek (πνεῦμα, ') and masculine in Latin (spiritus). The neuter Greek πνεῦμα is used in the Septuagint to translate the Hebrew רוּחַ. The Holy Spirit was furthermore equated with the (grammatically feminine) Wisdom of God by two early Church fathers, Theophilus of Antioch (d. 180) and by Irenaeus (d. 202/3). However, the majority of theologians have, historically, identified Wisdom with Christ the Logos. Gregory of Nazianzus in the fourth century wrote that terms like \\"Father\\" and \\"Son\\" in reference to the persons of the trinity are not to be understood as expressing essences or energies of God but are to be understood as metaphors. The same position is still held in the 1992 Catechism of the Catholic Church.\\"In no way is God in man's image. He is neither man nor woman. God is pure spirit in which there is no place for the difference between the sexes. But the respective 'perfections' of man and woman reflect something of the infinite perfection of God: those of a mother and those of a father and husband.\\" CCC 370. Grammatical gender Even in the same language, a difference may arise relating to what word is chosen to describe the Holy Spirit. In Greek the word pneuma is grammatically neuter and so, in that language, the pronoun referring to the Holy Spirit under that name is also grammatically neuter. However, when the Holy Spirit is referred to by the grammatically masculine word Parakletos \\"counselor\\", the pronoun is masculine (since the pronoun refers to Parakletos rather than pneuma), as in John 16:7-8. William D. Mounce argues that in the Gospel of John, when Jesus referred to the Holy Spirit as Comforter (masculine in Greek), the grammatically necessary masculine form of the Greek pronoun autos is used,William D. Mounce, The Morphology of Biblical Greek (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1994), pp. 241-242 but when Jesus speaks of the Holy Spirit as Spirit, grammatically neuter in Greek,John 14:26; 15:26; 16:13-14. the masculine form of the demonstrative pronoun ekeinos (\\"that masculine one\\") is used. This breaking of the grammatical agreement expected by native language readers is an indication of the author's intention to convey the personhood of the Holy Spirit. Daniel B. Wallace, however, disputes the claim that ekeinos is connected with pneuma in John 14:26 and 16:13-14, asserting instead that it belongs to parakletos. Wallace concludes that \\"it is difficult to find any text in which πνευμα is grammatically referred to with the masculine gender\\".Daniel B. Wallace, Greek Grammar Beyond the Basics: An Exegetical Syntax of New Testament Greek (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1996), 332. In Hebrew the word for Spirit (רוח) (ruach) is feminine, (which is used in the Hebrew Bible, as is the feminine word \\"shekhinah\\" in rabbinic literature, to indicate the presence of God, sakina, a word mentioned six times in the Quran). In the Syriac language too, the grammatically feminine word rucha means \\"spirit\\", and writers in that language, both orthodox and Gnostic, used maternal images when speaking of the Holy Spirit. This imagery is found in the fourth-century theologians Aphrahat and Ephrem the Syrian. It is found in earlier writings of Syriac Christianity such as the Odes of SolomonSusan Ashbrook Harvey, \\"Feminine Imagery for the Divine: The Holy Spirit, the Odes of Solomon, and Early Syriac Tradition,\\" St. Vladimir's Theological Quarterly 37, nos. 2-3 (1993): 111-120. and in the Gnostic early-third-century Acts of Thomas.Acts of Thomas 5:50, quoted in More Than Just a Controversy: All About The Holy Spirit Historian of religion Susan Ashbrook Harvey considers the grammatical gender to have been significant for early Syriac Christianity: \\"It seems clear that for the Syrians, the cue from grammar—ruah as a feminine noun—was not entirely gratuitous. There was real meaning in calling the Spirit 'She'.\\"Harvey, \\"Feminine Imagery,\\" 136. In the Catholic Church, the Holy Spirit is referred to in English as \\"he\\" in liturgical texts, however the Holy See directs that \\"the established gender usage of each respective language [is] to be maintained.\\"Liturgiam Authenticam , 31 (a) Discussion in Mainstream ChristianityAncient church= For Semitic languages, such as ancient Syriac, the earliest liturgical tradition and established gender usage for referring to the Holy Spirit is feminine.Feminine-Maternal Images of the Spirit in Early Syriac Tradition, by Emmanuel Kaniyamparampil, O.C.D. The Syriac language, which was in common use around AD 300, is derived from Aramaic. In documents produced in Syriac by the early Miaphysite church (which later became the Syriac Orthodox Church) the feminine gender of the word for spirit gave rise to a theology in which the Holy Spirit was considered feminine.http://www.theology.edu/journal/volume3/spirit.htm = Recent discussions = Some recent authors (1980s to present), while retaining masculine reference to Father and Son, have used feminine language for the Holy Spirit.

NettelhorstChapter Seven - Pneumatology: Doctrine of the Holy SpiritAppendix 3 -The Holy Spirit in the Old Testament - The Occurrences of Spirit Discovering Biblical Equality maintains that viewing God in masculine terms is merely a way in which we speak of God in figurative language. The author reiterates that God is spirit and that the Bible presents God through personification and anthropomorphism which reflects only a likeness to God.\\"God is not a sexual being, either male or female─something that was considered to be true in ancient Near Eastern religion. He even speaks specifically against such a view in , where the text has Balaam saying God is not a man [ish], and in , in which he warns against creating a graven image in \\"the likeness of male or female.\\" But though he is not a male, the \\"formless\\" deity () has chosen to reveal himself largely in masculine ways.\\" House, H. Wayne (reviewer). \\"God, Gender and Biblical Metaphor.\\" J of Biblical Manhood and Womanhood, 10:1 (Spring 2005) p. 64 There are some Christian churches (see below) who teach that the Holy Spirit is feminine based on the fact that both feminine nouns and verbs, as well as feminine analogies, are thought to be used by the Bible to describe the Spirit of God in passages such as Genesis 1:1-2, Genesis 2:7, Deut. 32:11-12, Proverbs 1:20, Matthew 11:19, Luke 3:22, and John 3:5-6. These are based on the grammatical gender of both the nouns and verbs used by the original authors for the Spirit, as well as maternal analogies used by the prophets and Jesus for the Spirit in the original Bible languages. There are biblical translations where the pronoun used for the Holy Spirit is masculine, in contrast to the gender of the noun used for spirit in Hebrew and Aramaic. In Aramaic also, the language generally considered to have been spoken by Jesus, the word is feminine. However, in Greek the word (pneuma) is neuter. Most English translations of the New Testament refer to the Holy Spirit as masculine in a number of places where the masculine Greek word \\"Paraclete\\" occurs, for \\"Comforter\\", most clearly in the Gospel of John, chapters 14 to 16.Nestle and others, Novum Testamentum Graece, 27th ed. (Stuttgart: Deutsche Bibelgeselschaft, 1993) These texts were particularly significant when Christians were debating whether the New Testament teaches that the Holy Spirit is a fully divine hypostasis, as opposed to a created force. Feminine Gender in Other Christian GroupsLatter-day Saints= In the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints gender is seen \\"as an essential characteristic of eternal identity and purpose\\".\\"Gender Is an Essential Characteristic of Eternal Identity and Purpose\\", Ensign, Oct. 2008, 67 The LDS Church believes that before we lived on earth, we existed spiritually, with a spirit body with defined gender,\\"Strengthening the Family: Created in the Image of God, Male and Female\\", Ensign, Jan. 2005, 48–49 and that the Holy Spirit had a similar body, but was to become a member of the three personage Godhead The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Godhead consisting of God, or Heavenly Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost). =Branch Davidians= Some small Christian groups regard the gender of the Holy Spirit to be female, based on their understanding that the Hebrew word for Spirit, ruach, can be feminine or masculine. Their views derive from skepticism toward Greek primacy for the New Testament. Foremost among these groups, and the most vocal on the subject are the Branch Davidian Seventh-day Adventists. In 1977, one of their leaders, Lois Roden, began to formally teach that a feminine Holy Spirit is the heavenly pattern of women. In her many studies and talks she cited numerous scholars and researchers from Jewish, Christian, and other sources. They see in the creation of Adam and Eve a literal image and likeness of the invisible Godhead, male and female, who is \\"clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made\\". They take the Oneness of God to mean the \\"familial\\" unity which exists between them, which unity is not seen in any other depiction of the Godhead by the various non- Hebrew peoples. Thus, having a Father and Mother in heaven, they see that the Bible shows that those Parents had a Son born unto them before the creation of the world, by Whom all things were created.It's all Greek to Them The Holy Spirit He, She, or It?The Real Ghost StoryShe is a Tree of LifeShelter from the Storm =Unity Church= The Unity Church's co-founder Charles Fillmore considered the Holy Spirit a distinctly feminine aspect of God considering it to be \\"the love of Jehovah\\" and \\"love is always feminine\\". =Messianic Jews= The B'nai Yashua Synagogues Worldwide, a Messianic group headed by Rabbi Moshe Koniuchowsky, holds to the feminine view of the Holy Spirit.Who/What is the Ruach HaKodesh? Sermon Delivered 12-25-04 Part OneWho/What is the Ruach HaKadosh? Sermon Delivered 1-1-05 Part Two Messianic Judaism is considered by most Christians and Jews to be a form of Christianity. There are also some other independent Messianic groups with similar teachings. Some examples include Joy In the World;Joy In the WorldThe Ruach HaKodesh: Him Or Her? The Torah and Testimony Revealed;The Torah and Testimony Revealed Messianic Judaism - The Torah and the Testimony Revealed;Messianic Judaism - The Torah and the Testimony Revealed - Haas genealogy and the Union of Nazarene Jewish Congregations/Synagogues , who also count as canonical the Gospel of the Hebrews which has the unique feature of referring to the Holy Spirit as Jesus' Mother.Gospel of the Hebrews#Content Some scholars associated with mainline denominations, while not necessarily indicative of the denominations themselves, have written works explaining a feminine understanding of the third member of the Godhead.For example, R.P. Nettlehorst, professor at the Quartz Hill School of Theology (associated with the Southern Baptist Convention) has written on the subject. . =Moravian Brethren= There was a well established place in liturgy, prayer and doctrine for the Holy Spirit as the Mother amongst the Moravian Brethren, exemplified by Count Zinzendorf especially. In art In Christian iconography, the Holy Spirit is most often represented as a dove. There is also a far less common tradition of depicting the Holy Spirit in human form, usually as male. Thus, Andrei Rublev's The Trinity represents the Trinity as the \\"three men\\" who visited Abraham at the oak of MamreGenesis 18 often considered a theophany of the Trinity. In at least one medieval fresco, however, in the St. Jakobus church in Urschalling, Germany, the Holy Spirit is depicted as a female.http://divinebalance.org/ebooks/finding_holy_spirit_mother.php See also * Maid of Heaven, representation of the Holy Spirit in the Bahá'í Faith ReferencesExternal links * More Than Just a Controversy: All About the Holy Spirit Category:Pneumatology Category:Gender and Christianity ","title":"Gender of the Holy Spirit"},{"id":"22811153","text":"Orla Noom, (born November 2, 1985 in Haarlem) is a professional squash player who represents the Netherlands.

The IRA launched homemade mortar shells at 10 Downing Street, London, the HQ of the Government of the United Kingdom. It was an attempt to assassinate Prime Minister John Major and his War Cabinet, who were meeting to discuss the Gulf War. One of the heavy mortar shells exploded in the back garden of Number 10, only yards from the cabinet office. Due to the bomb-resistant windows, none of the cabinet were hurt, though four other people received minor injuries, including two police officers. The other two shells overshot Downing Street and landed on a green nearby. Background During the Troubles, as part of its armed campaign against British rule in Northern Ireland, the Provisional IRA had repeatedly used homemade mortars against targets in Northern Ireland. The most notable attack was the 1985 Newry mortar attack which killed nine members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary. The IRA had carried out many attacks in England, but had not used mortars there. In December 1988 items used in their construction and technical details regarding the weapon's trajectory were found during a raid in Battersea, South London by members of the Metropolitan Police Anti- Terrorist Branch. In the late 1980s, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was top of the IRA's list for assassination, following the failed attempt on her life in the Brighton hotel bombing. Security around Downing Street had been stepped up at a cost of £800,000 following increased IRA activity in England in 1988, including the addition of a police guard post and security gates at the end of the street. Plans to leave a car bomb on a street near Downing Street and detonate it by remote control as Thatcher's official car was driving by had been ruled out by the IRA's Army Council owing to the likelihood of civilian casualties, which some Army Council members argued would have been politically counter-productive. Preparation The Army Council instead sanctioned a mortar attack on Downing Street and in mid-1990, two IRA members travelled to London to plan the attack. One of the IRA members was knowledgeable about the trajectory of mortars and the other, from the IRA's Belfast Brigade, was familiar with their manufacture. An active service unit bought a Ford Transit van and rented a garage and an IRA co-ordinator procured the explosives and materials needed to make the mortars. The IRA unit began making the mortars and cutting a hole in the roof of the van for the mortars to be fired through. They reconnoitred locations in Whitehall to find a suitable place from which the mortars could be fired at the back of 10 Downing Street, the Prime Minister's official residence and office. Once preparations were complete, the two IRA members returned to Ireland, as the IRA leadership considered them valuable personnel and did not wish to risk them being arrested in any follow-up operation by the security services. In November 1990, Margaret Thatcher unexpectedly resigned from office, but the Army Council decided the planned attack should still go ahead, targeting her successor John Major. The IRA planned to attack when Major and his ministers were likely to be meeting at Downing Street and waited until the date of a planned cabinet meeting was publicly known. The attack Downing Street in 1996 On the morning of 7 February 1991, the War Cabinet and senior government and military officials were meeting at Downing Street to discuss the ongoing Gulf War. As well as the Prime Minister, John Major, those present at the meeting included politicians Douglas Hurd, Tom King, Norman Lamont, Peter Lilley, Patrick Mayhew, David Mellor and John Wakeham, civil servants Robin Butler, Percy Cradock, Gus O'Donnell and Charles Powell, and Chief of the Defence Staff David Craig. As the meeting began, an IRA member was driving the van to the launch site amid a heavy snowfall. The launch site was at the junction of Horse Guards Avenue and Whitehall, near the Ministry of Defence headquarters, about from Downing Street. On arrival, the driver parked the van and left the scene on a waiting motorcycle. Several minutes later at 10:08 am, as a policeman was walking towards the van to investigate it, three mortar shells were launched, followed by the explosion of a pre-set incendiary device. This device was designed to destroy any forensic evidence and set the van on fire. Each shell was four and a half feet long, weighed , and carried a payload of the plastic explosive Semtex. The weapon was described as a Mark 10 homemade mortar.Geraghty, Tony (1998), The Irish War: the Hidden Conflict Between the IRA and British Intelligence, Johns Hopkins University Press, p. 192. Two shells landed on Mountbatten Green, a grassed area near the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. One exploded and the other failed to detonate. The third shell exploded in the back garden of 10 Downing Street, from the office where the cabinet were meeting. Had the shell struck 10 Downing Street itself, it is likely the entire cabinet would have been killed. On hearing the explosion, the cabinet ducked under the table for cover. Bomb-proof netting on the windows of the cabinet office muffled the force of the explosion, which scorched the back wall of the building, smashed windows and made a crater several feet deep in the garden. Once the sound of the explosion and aftershock had died down, John Major said, \\"I think we had better start again, somewhere else.\\" The room was evacuated and the meeting reconvened less than ten minutes later in the COBR Room. No members of the cabinet were hurt, but four people received minor injuries, including two police officers injured by flying debris. Immediately after the attack, hundreds of police officers sealed off the government district, from the Houses of Parliament to Trafalgar Square. Until 6 pm, civilians were kept out of the area as forensic experts combed the streets and government employees were locked in behind security gates. Reaction The security gates installed in 1989 as a result of the IRA's bombing campaign in England The IRA claimed responsibility for the attack with a statement issued in Dublin, saying: \\"Let the British government understand that, while nationalist people in the six counties [Northern Ireland] are forced to live under British rule, then the British Cabinet will be forced to meet in bunkers\\". John Major told the House of Commons that \\"Our determination to beat terrorism cannot be beaten by terrorism. The IRA's record is one of failure in every respect, and that failure was demonstrated yet again today. It's about time they learned that democracies cannot be intimidated by terrorism, and we treat them with contempt\\". Leader of the Opposition Neil Kinnock also condemned the attack, stating: \\"The attack in Whitehall today was both vicious and futile\\". The head of the Metropolitan Police Anti-Terrorist Branch, Commander George Churchill-Coleman, described the attack as \\"daring, well planned, but badly executed\\". Peter Gurney, the head of the Explosives Section of the Anti-Terrorist Branch who defused one of the unexploded shells, gave his reaction to the attack: > It was a remarkably good aim if you consider that the bomb was fired 250 > yards [across Whitehall] with no direct line of sight. Technically, it was > quite brilliant and I'm sure that many army crews, if given a similar task, > would be very pleased to drop a bomb that close. You've got to park the > launch vehicle in an area which is guarded by armed men and you've got less > than a minute to do it. I was very, very surprised at how good it was. If > the angle of fire had been moved about five or ten degrees, then those bombs > would actually have impacted on Number Ten. A further statement from the IRA appeared in An Phoblacht, with a spokesperson stating \\"Like any colonialists, the members of the British establishment do not want the result of their occupation landing at their front or back doorstep ... Are the members of the British cabinet prepared to give their lives to hold on to a colony? They should understand the cost will be great while Britain remains in Ireland.\\" The attack was celebrated in Irish rebel popular culture when The Irish Brigade released a song titled \\"Downing Street\\", to the tune of \\"On the Street Where You Live\\", which included the lyrics \\"while you hold Ireland, it's not safe down the street where you live\\".Bandit Country, p. 337.

This composition for string quartet was commissioned by the Stanley String Quartet of the University of Michigan, who decided not to play it upon seeing the score, and received its first performance in 1960 by the Juilliard String Quartet. The quartet is considerably influenced by the music of European avant-garde composers who were gaining celebrity at this time, particularly Pierre Boulez's Le Marteau sans maître. This is a much more fragmentary piece than his earlier quartet (1951): the four instruments play very individual roles and unpredictably bounce off one another. Indeed, Carter has instructed the players to sit as far apart as possible so that they appear to be playing different pieces simultaneously. Character Each of the parts has its own different character: *First Violin: \\"mercurical\\" *Second Violin: \\"laconic\\" *Viola: \\"expressive\\" *Cello: \\"impetuous\\" Carter has distinguished each character not just by general style, but also by the rigorous assignment of musical materials. Reception This work had brought Carter recognition in America comparable to what his First has given him back in Europe. This work was awarded three major prizes, including the Pulitzer Prize.

A member of the Norwegian Parliament for five terms, he became known as a radical and liberal politician. He spent his professional career as a jurist working in various parts of Eastern Norway. Personal life He was born in Kragerø as the son of merchant Claus Thomesen and his wife Inger Pedersen. His older brother Thomes Thomesen was a merchant and politician. Through him Ole Thomesen was an uncle of feminist, journalist and politician Fernanda Nissen. Another niece, painter Sophie Marie Stoltenberg Thomesen, married painter Erik Werenskiold. In March 1850 he married Johanne Jacobine Aalborg (1824–1893). Career Ole Thomesen attended his early school in Kragerø, but then moved to Christiania, as he wanted an academic education instead of becoming a merchant. He took the examen artium in 1837 and the cand.jur. degree in 1843. Then, after half a year as a junior solicitor in Vågå he returned to Kragerø. However in 1848 he returned to Vågå as acting attorney. He was later a junior solicitor in Lillehammer before moving to Ringsaker in 1853 and Faaberg in 1855, where he worked as an attorney and farmer. He was also involved when a Norwegian-owned (as opposed to British-owned) steamship company trafficking the lake Mjøsa was established in 1853. As the company needed new ships, one of the ships that was ordered was Skibladner, and Thomesen personally signed the contract for building the ship. Built in Motala, Skibladner became operational in 1856, and is still in operation . The encyclopedia Store norske leksikon reports that Skibladner is probably the second oldest paddle steamer in the world, behind the Romanian Tudor Vladimirescu. In 1867 Thomesen returned to Kristiania. After two years as acting assessor in the city court, he got the position on a permanent basis in 1869. In February 1874 he was appointed as district stipendiary magistrate in Nedre Telemark. He resided at Gvarv. He was elected to the Norwegian Parliament from the constituency Bratsberg Amt in 1877, 1880, 1883, 1886 and 1889, since 1884 representing the Liberal Party. From 1883 he was a member of the Lagting. As such he was a candidate to participate in the Impeachment Court of 1883-1884, composed of Lagting members and Supreme Court Justices, but he was weeded out as the counsel for the defence took care to decline the candidatures of some of the more liberal and intellectual Lagting members. The aim was to put pressure on the remaining Lagting members, whom the conservatives called \\"the non-competent part of the court\\", but this did not succeed.Sørensen, 1984: pp.61–62 As a politician Thomesen was, already from an early age, more radical than party leader and Prime Minister Johan Sverdrup. He was a strong proponent of public saving, and advocated liberal rules of suffrage--for male citizens. He also supported separation of church and state, and opposed the religious influence in his party, proponents of which would later break out to form the more lay-Christian Moderate Liberal Party. Thomesen was also anti-Swedish Union. He advocated republicanist rule, citing that the head of the executive branch of government should be vested with constitutional responsibility, and be elected for his skills. However, he also advocated the parliamentary system with a weak executive branch compared to the legislature. He eventually became an outspoken opponent of Prime Minister Johan Sverdrup, perceiving him as not radical enough. In December 1888 he hinted that Sverdrup was indirectly responsible for Ole Richter's suicide; as a result Thomesen was admonished through a Royal Resolution. He also antagonized other Liberal parliament members from his same constituency, notably Viggo Ullmann. Ultimately he was not re-elected for a sixth parliamentary term. He retired as a district stipendiary magistrate in August 1892, and moved to Sandvika. He died in eastern Bærum in October 1905.

Business unions are believed to be of American origin, and the term has been applied in particular to phenomena characteristic of American unions.Goldfield, Decline of Organized Labor in the United States (1987/1989), p. 49 This idea originated over the court's difficulty when regulating worker's industrial rights, specifically following the decades after the Civil War. Hyman (1973) attributed the term \\"business unionism\\" to Hoxie, but Michael Goldfield (1987) notes that the term was in common usage before Hoxie published in 1915.Goldfield, Decline of Organized Labor in the United States (1987/1989), p. 49 According to Goldfield, Hoxie used the term to describe trade-consciousness, rather than class-consciousness; in other words, according to Hoxie, business unionists were advocates of \\"pure and simple\\" trade unionism, as opposed to class or revolutionary unionism.Goldfield, Decline of Organized Labor in the United States (1987/1989), p. 49 This sort of business unionism is what Eugene Debs often referred to as the \\"old unionism\\".Goldfield, Decline of Organized Labor in the United States (1987/1989), p. 49  Characteristics Internal organization= One major characteristic of \\"business unionism\\" is the principle that unions should be run like businesses. These unions would be organized as top-down hierarchies, with dedicated employees paid in a stratified way.Moody, An Injury to All (1988), p. 57. \\"The idea of the union as a business led in turn to the conclusion that it should be run like one - from the top down. As Teamster President Dave Beck asked in the 1950s: 'Unions are big business. Why should truck drivers and bottle washers be allowed to make big decisions affecting union policy? Would any corporation allow it?'\\" Business unionism creates a centralized bureaucracy that is independent from and unaccountable to the union rank and file.Moody, An Injury to All (1988), p. 64. \\"The routinization of bargaining through the establishment of the three-year contract and the administrative centralization of pattern bargaining brought with it a vast expansion of administrative apparatus that supported the power of the top leadership and increased its independence of rank-and-file leadership.\\" The \\"union rep\\", who earns more than the union workers, is a key element of this structure.Moody, An Injury to All (1988), pp. 64–65. \\"In unions where debate was dead and information the monopoly of the bureaucracy, the rep became not only the enforcer but the sole source of information. In this capacity the rep served as the unopposed tribune of modern business unionism.\\" According to this model, the main 'battleground' for organized labour moves from the shop floor to the boardroom, where well-paid business leaders of the union negotiate with well-paid bosses of the company.Moody, An Injury to All (1988), pp. 84. \\"\\" = Craft unionism = The members of a union's identity is defined by their craft. Craftsmen involved in the metal and building trades did help set a positive image for their companies. They feel a solidarity towards their fellow co-workers as opposed to the greater working class. The unions adopt an exclusive policy as opposed to inclusive one. This can cause a fragmentation of workers. The unions are more inclined to fight against reorganization of work by their employers.Ross, Rethinking the Politics of Labour in Canada, (2012), p. 35 Business unions are sometimes not inclined to expand their membership and organize outside workers.Moody, An Injury to All (1988), p. 125. Union leaders shared a form of populism that spoke to three key groups of people-- patriotic producers, wage earners, and guardians of basic rights. = Economic interests = The unions only view their goal to protect immediate economic interests. These economic interests are restricted to getting higher wages, better working conditions, and job security. \\"In other words, the horizon of union action is straight-forward and short-term: to produce constant and immediate improvements in the material conditions of union members' lives.\\"Ross, Rethinking the Politics of Labour in Canada, (2012), pp. 35–36 Business unions also do not seek worker input into technological changes that change the structure of the companies that employ workers.Moody, An Injury to All (1988), p. 84. The result is an intense focus on the collective bargaining process, conducted according to rigid specifications.Moody, An Injury to All (1988), pp. 62–65. This outlook can be contrasted with social unionism, a union movement which seeks to improve life overall for workers—for example by struggling against racial discrimination in the workplace.Moody, An Injury to All (1988), pp. 58–59. \\"Unlike the AFL business unionists, the leaders of the CIO saw labor as a force for broad social and political change. The changes they envisioned were not revolutionary or even anticapitalist, but the idea that unions had a social responsibility beyond improving their members living standards was itself a break with AFL business unionism. [...] The social unionism of the CIO also involved a different attitude toward the Black community than of the AFL.\\" =Rights vs. powers= Centrally-controlled business unions tend to advocate for workers' \\"rights\\", a set of enumerated conditions to which workers are entitled. Large federations felt it was crucial to appeal to all citizens in general who believed in \\"equal rights\\" and were held at jeopardy by corrupt administrators. If these rights are violated, the worker may begin a process of complaints that ultimately yields compensation. A consequence of this outlook is that instead of simply organizing and demanding power on the shop floor, workers follow a pre- determined system that does not allow major changes in the workplace.Moody, An Injury to All (1988), p. 84. \\"The general business unionist response to the proliferation of grievances was to increase the specificity of the contract's language. As David Brody has pointed out, the growing specification on worker rights in the contract actually narrowed the freedom of the shopfloor union to work these matters out and hence restricted its power. What had previously been a matter for negotiation was now strictly one of interpretation. The steward ceased to be a leader and became increasingly a shopfloor lawyer - and shopfloor organization suffered from this 'Perry Mason syndrome'.\\" = Source of workers' problems = The unions define the problems of the members' as being from the particularly greedy employers. They also blame the unfair distribution of the surplus through the work process. They are not radical in their outlook and do not blame the capitalist system as a whole for these problems. They also do not believe in a radical change to the system. The solution for business unionists is to negotiate a fair distribution of the surplus and reduce social inequality not eliminate it.Ross, Rethinking the Politics of Labour in Canada, (2012), p. 36.Moody, An Injury to All (1988), p. 15. \\"Business unionism as an outlook is fundamentally conservative in that it leaves unquestioned capital's dominance, both on the job and in society as a whole. Instead, it sees only to negotiate the price of this domination. This it does through the businesslike negotiation of a contractual relationship with a limited sector of capital and for a limited portion of the working class.\\" = Politics = Business unionism is also viewed as being non- partisan, although members tend to be \\"liberal\\" politically.Moody, An Injury to All (1988), p. 56. \\"Business unionists were more likely to be political liberals than the employers they dealt with, but in normal times they did not see the union as a vehicle for social change.\\" It is believed that to adopt political allegiances would divide union members. The unions would make political allegiances based on pragmatism, supporting different parties on an issue by issue basis. But refused to make permanent allegiances. There is a tendency to think business unionism is automatically non-militant but that is not true. Business unions have used direct action to get results for their members. But business unions use strikes and direct actions differently than social unions. Business unions tend to only use strikes to exert and maintain their bargaining position. Business unions though tend to be more cooperative with management and identify workers' interest as being with the employers' success.  Examples of business unions  Canada = *Unifor *SEIU Healthcare *Trades and Labour Congress of Canada *Canadian Federation of Labour (1982) – In 1982 a group of construction unions covering approximately members united to form a new Canadian Federation of Labour.

The two bodies differed on matters of representation at CLC conventions, dual unionism and the CLC standard that Canadian officers of affiliated unions be elected by the Canadian membership. The CFL philosophy is summed up in the statement of its president, James McCambly: \\"We are committed to leaving politics to the politicians and to concentrating on being effective representatives of labour's interest within the political system.\\" By 1996 CFL membership had shrunk to as some of its affiliates rejoined the CLC.

It was electrically operated from the start, with winding gear situated at the upper station driven by a winding motor. The line was controlled by a driver at the upper station, assisted by an attendant at the lower station. Wooden-bodied cars were used. The cars were replaced in the 1960s by aluminium-bodied cars intended to be interchangeable across all three of Bournemouth's surviving cliff railways. In 1987 the track was re- laid, and during the 1990s the line was further upgraded with the installation of an electronic control system. On 24 April 2016 the lift was damaged by a landslip which occurred when the sandstone layers within the cliff on which the lift rests became saturated with water. The cars were removed from the track by crane on 21 May 2016. The landslip also damaged the lower toll house for the lift and the decision was taken to dismantle the building. The lift has remained closed since the landslip and is not due to re-open until at least 2019.

The film is based on the true story of the Dreyfus Case, in which a Jewish captain in the French Army was falsely accused of treason. Plot synopsis In 1894 Alfred Dreyfus (José Ferrer), a Jewish captain in the French Army, is falsely accused of treason. He is sentenced to life imprisonment on Devil's Island. Major Ferdinand Walsin- Esterhazy, an infantry officer of Hungarian descent, helps in the investigation. When he is found to be the real spy, the French Army tries to hide the truth by exonerating the traitor in a mock trial. Émile Zola, the famous French author, writes an open letter to the prime minister of France entitled \\"I Accuse!\\", which reveals the truth behind the cover up. The letter is published in the newspaper, causing a firestorm around the world, leading to a re-examination of the entire Dreyfus case. Eventually, Esterhazy makes a full confession, and Dreyfus is completely exonerated, being inducted into the French Legion of Honor.

The New York Times said it \\"had high merits\\". In October 1955 MGM acquired an option on the film rights. The story had been filmed previously, notably in The Life of Émile Zola and The Dreyfus Case, but MGM claimed the book \\"contains quite a bit of material that had not come to life before\\". In January 1957 Sam Zimbalist announced that José Ferrer would star and direct. In March Viveca Lindfors signed to co star. The film was known as Captain Dreyfus before being retitled I Accuse. The location work was done in Belgium, as the French army refused to allow filming in France. Filming finished by June 1957. ReceptionBox office= The film was a box office flop. It earned $190,000 in the US and Canada and $475,000 elsewhere, leading to a loss of $1,415,000. Notes The fact that Dreyfus was railroaded because he was Jewish had been obscured in the 1937 movie The Life of Émile Zola. Only those villains whose names were a matter of public record (Major Dort, Major Esterhazy) are specifically identified. Others are referred to as the Chief of Staff, the Minister of War, etc., to avoid lawsuits from their descendants (the events depicted in the film, most of which took place between 1894 and 1902, were still within living memory in 1937). As for Dreyfus himself, he was not freed and restored to rank in 1902, the year of Zola's death, but in 1906 – after being found guilty again in an 1899 retrial (Dreyfus died in 1935, outliving everyone else involved in the case).http://www.allmovie.com/movie/life-of-emile- zola-v29244TCM – Ben Mankiewicz on 28 March 2015 ReferencesExternal links  * * Category:1958 films Category:1950s historical drama films Category:1950s biographical drama films Category:British films Category:British biographical drama films Category:British historical drama films Category:British black-and-white films Category:English-language films Category:Films about the Dreyfus affair Category:Films based on non-fiction books Category:Films set in 1894 Category:Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films Category:Films directed by José Ferrer Category:Films with screenplays by Gore Vidal Category:Films scored by William Alwyn Category:Cultural depictions of Georges Clemenceau Category:Cultural depictions of Alfred Dreyfus Category:Cultural depictions of Émile Zola ","title":"I Accuse!"},{"id":"22811715","text":"Lee Crooks (born ) is an English former professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1980s and 1990s, and coached in the 1990s, 2000s and 2010s.

Origins Modern African sculpture is not \\"traditional\\", although much of its subject matter has traditional roots. During the precolonial era, local inhabitants were already artistically predisposed, fashioning works from various natural materials such as fibres, wood, clay, and stone for functional, aesthetic, and ritual purposes. Numerous stone artefacts such as the Zimbabwe bird from the Great Zimbabwe state of the late Iron Age bear testament to this. Prior to the opening in 1957 of the Rhodes National Gallery in Salisbury, its first Director, Frank McEwen, met with Thomas Mukarobgwa, a young native steeped in rural knowledge and spirituality, and offered him an opportunity to pursue a career in art. Mukarobgwa became \\"the perfect mentor to guide the director of the new gallery into the ways and mores of the African people.\\" It was an introduction to local artist Joram Mariga and his early soft stone carvings that prompted McEwen to encourage early soapstone carvers to create works that reflected their culture. The Workshop School established by the gallery soon attracted more artists, many of whom had already been exposed to some form of art training from early mission schools and were established art practitioners. These included Joseph Ndandarika, John Takawira and Kingsley Sambo. The budding art movement was relatively slow to develop but was given massive impetus in 1966 by Tom Blomefield, a white South-African-born farmer of tobacco whose farm at Tengenenge near Guruve had extensive deposits of serpentine stone suitable for carving. A sculptor in stone himself, Blomefield wanted to diversify the use of his land and welcomed new sculptors onto it to form a community of working artists. This was in part because at that time there were international sanctions against Rhodesia’s white government, then led by Ian Smith, who had declared Unilateral Declaration of Independence in 1965, and tobacco was no longer able to generate sufficient income. Appropriately, Tengenenge means \\"The Beginning of the Beginning\\" — in this case of a significant new enterprise. 1973 carving of an eagle by Bernard Matemera =First generation sculptors of the 20th century= Further details of the establishment of the \\"first generation\\" of new Shona sculptors are given in the individual biographies of its leading members: Bernard Matemera, Sylvester Mubayi, Henry Mukarobgwa, Thomas Mukarobgwa, Henry Munyaradzi, Joram Mariga, Joseph Ndandarika, Bernard Takawira and his brother John. This group also includes the Mukomberanwa family (Nicholas Mukomberanwa and his protegees Anderson Mukomberanwa, Lawrence Mukomberanwa, Taguma Mukomberanwa, Netsai Mukomberanwa, Ennica Mukomberanwa, and Nesbert Mukomberanwa). All these artists have created works that have been exhibited worldwide and several of are now included in the McEwen bequest to the British Museum. During its early years of growth, the nascent \\"Shona sculpture movement\\" was described as an art renaissance, an art phenomenon and a miracle. Critics and collectors could not understand how an art genre had developed with such vigor, spontaneity, and originality in an area of Africa which had none of the great sculptural heritage of West Africa and had previously been described in terms of the visual arts as artistically barren.Arnold M I.

The most dedicated of artists display a high degree of integrity, never copying and still working entirely by hand, with spontaneity and a confidence in their skills, unrestricted by externally imposed ideas of what their \\"art\\" should be. Now, over fifty years on from the first tentative steps towards a new sculptural tradition, many Zimbabwean artists make their living from full-time sculpting and the very best can stand comparison with contemporary sculptors anywhere else. The sculpture they produce speaks of fundamental human experiences - experiences such as grief, elation, humor, anxiety, and spiritual search - and has always managed to communicate these in a profoundly simple and direct way that is both rare and extremely refreshing. The artist 'works' together with his stone, and it is believed that 'nothing which exists naturally is inanimate' - it has a spirit and life of its own. One is always aware of the stone's contribution in the finished sculpture and it is indeed fortunate that in Zimbabwe a magnificent range of stones are available from which to choose: hard black springstone, richly colored serpentine and soapstones, firm grey limestone and semi-precious Verdite and Lepidolite.Kasfir S L.

Jonathan Zilberg has pointed out that there is a parallel market within Zimbabwe for what he calls flow sculptures – whose subject matter is the family (ukama in Shona) – and which are produced throughout the country, from suburban Harare to Guruve in the northeast and Mutare in the east. These readily available and inexpensive forms of sculpture are, he believes, of more interest to local black Zimbabweans than the semi-abstract figurative sculptures of the type mainly seen in museums and exported to overseas destinations. The flow sculptures are still capable of demonstrating innovation in art and most are individually carved, in styles that are characteristic of the individual artists. Another artist, Bryn Taurai Mteki, created a large sculpture titled “Chippi”, which was unveiled during the sixth All-Africa Games, hosted in Zimbabwe in September 1995. This sculpture also served as the games mascot. It is 2.5 meters high and is now displayed at the National Sports Stadium in Harare alongside the Games' Flame, as a part of the permanent collection. In 1996 Mteki, now living in Europe, was honoured with silver medals from Oelsnitz, Auerbach and Adorf in Germany. Some sculptors in Zimbabwe work in media other than stone. For example, at Zimbabwe Heritage 1988, Paul Machowani won an Award of Distinction for his metal piece \\"Ngozi\\" and in 1992 Joseph Chanota’s metal piece \\"Thinking of the Drought\\" won the same award. Bulawayo has been a center for metal sculpture, with artists such as David Ndlovu and Adam Madebele.

This is being portrayed, in this case, through simplified forms and missing body parts. The current poor economic conditions in Zimbabwe and recent hyper-inflation means that it is increasingly difficult for its artists to prosper and make a living from full- time sculpting.

The novel, inspired by the life of Henry Stuart, who moved from Idaho to Alabama in the 1920s after being told incorrectly that he had a year to live, has made Stuart's Alabama home a site of pilgrimage for its readers. The book has been optioned for a film and as of 2007 was in pre-production. Plot The book begins in Nampa, Idaho, with Henry Stuart having just learned that he has one to two years to live because he has non-contagious tuberculosis. Told he will be more comfortable in a warmer climate, Stuart leaves his two grown sons to relocate to Fairhope, Alabama. When he arrives, he finds that the land he has purchased sight unseen hosts only a barn. He decides to build a house, on property he names \\"Tolstoy Park\\" in honor of Leo Tolstoy, who had himself become a wandering ascetic in the months before his death. An amateur poet and an eccentric, Stuart sheds his materialism for a life of contemplation, one which extends much longer than Stuart expected. Background When Sonny Brewer, then a real estate agent, saw a small, round concrete hut sitting adjacent to a parking lot in Fairhope, Alabama in the 1980s, he became curious to know who had built it and why. Several old newspaper articles filled him in on the history of Henry Stuart, an Idahoan who was informed by his doctors in the early 1920s that he had only a year to live. Stuart left two grown sons and moved to of wilderness in Alabama on which he built by himself a hurricane-proof concrete shelter. The shelter, which was built in about two weeks more than a year in 1925 and 1926, was set into the ground on which it was constructed, lending to a comfortable, stable temperature of the floor—the diameter of which was a perfect match to the highest point of the roof. In his late 60s, Stuart climbed a ladder to reach his bed, a hammock strung above the ground. Brewer was fascinated by the story of the eccentric Stuart, who lived in his hut for 18 years convinced he was on the brink of death before relocating, finally dying in Oregon in 1946 at the age of 88. Brewer was on the verge of bankruptcy when he learned Ballentine had purchased his novel about Stuart's life, only 20 pages of which were complete, for $100,000.00. He rented and set about restoring the hut while writing the novel, moving into it to live—like Stuart—barefoot during its revision. Aftermath Stuart's hut in Fairhope, Alabama Even during Stuart's occupancy, the hut was often visited. Stuart, otherwise a hermit, kept a logbook signed by 1,200 guests, including Clarence Darrow. After the book was published, its readers began visiting the hut as well, with 2,000 people in one year signing the logbook left by Brewer, some spending the night inside. In 2006, the hut was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The novel has been optioned for a film and as of 2007 was in pre-production. The film is being produced by David Bushell, producer of Slingblade and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, with a screenplay adapted by Tom Epperson in collaboration with Brewer.

Biography Named after Belgian guitarist Django Reinhardt, Walker is the son of country music artist Jerry Jeff Walker and Susan Walker. He began learning to play guitar at age 15. After graduating from Austin High School in 1999, he attended the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts from 1999 to 2001, but did not graduate. He has said the experience made him \\"a better musician\\", but also says he learned much more traveling out on the road. Career When he was 16, Walker wrote his first song, \\"The Road You Choose\\", and performed it on stage at his father's shows. His father recorded it on his 1999 CD, Gypsy Songman, and Django later released his own recording of it. His band's debut CD, Down the Road, produced by Lloyd Maines, was released in 2002. Walker released the CD on a label he formed himself, Lazy Kid Music. He recorded the CD in five days, and wrote all but one of the songs himself. One of those songs, \\"Texas on my Mind\\", was previously recorded by Pat Green, and reached number 1 on the Texas Music Chart. Walker had written the song while a student at the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts. Walker's second CD, Six Trips Around the World, was released in 2006. It was produced by Mark Bryan of Hootie and the Blowfish, and recorded at Bryan's home in South Carolina. Musical style Walker has cited several different influences for his musical style, including popular rock artists The Beatles, Bob Dylan, The Allman Brothers, Tom Petty, Neil Young, as well as country artists Merle Haggard, Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, Pat Green, Robert Earl Keen, Guy Clark, and Townes Van Zandt. Reviewers have described his style as \\"unique country\\", \\"country/rocker\\", and \\"classic rock with undertones of good old Southern comfort\\". Personal Walker attended Austin High School in Austin, Texas, graduating in 1999. He played on the varsity basketball team, and, while studying in England, played semi-professional basketball.

Born George Martin Stoll, he was also later credited as George E. Stoll (sometimes without the middle initial). Violin prodigy Stoll made his musical debut as a boy violin prodigy, gaining nationwide fame.Times Herald (Olean, NY), 7 April 1938. He toured North America as a jazz violinist on the Fanchon and Marco Vaudeville circuit and was part of the Jazzmania Quintet, appearing with Edythe Flynn in an early 1927 sound short. In San Diego, he became an orchestra and trio leader (his Rhythm Aces)The Oakland Tribune, 28 November 1927; Ogden Standard Examiner (Ogden, Utah), 12 July 1929. and started to feature with Jack Oakie on radio programs, such as Camel Cigarette and NBC's Shell Oil Program.

He was also a favorite pinochle- playing buddy of studio head Louis B. Mayer.Christopher Finch (1979), Gone Hollywood, p. 342. Stoll kept his connection with the jazz world and visited clubs looking for rising talent. He recruited one of the first black arrangers at MGM, Calvin Jackson with whom he worked on the original music for his 1945 Oscar-winning score for the Kelly-Sinatra Anchors Aweigh.Clora Bryant & Steven Isoardi (1999), Central Avenue Sounds: Jazz in Los Angeles, University of California Press, p. 68.

A History of Public Finance in Victoria Program budgeting in Victoria (as well as in other states and countries) initially focused on inputs (such as the number of pens used, the number of phone calls made, etcetera) rather than outputs. The 1980s and 1990s was a period of reflection about the effectiveness of the public service in carrying out its core functions. Reforms of this period aimed to make the public service more flexible, efficient, and responsive to government direction. Modern public service became characterised by a stronger focus on objectives with performance being assessed on the basis of results. Private sector management and employment practices were commonly adopted in the public sector. As of 2009, Victorian public finance still focused on outputs while many other jurisdictions were starting to focus on outcomes. The Victorian model's focus on delivering outputs instead of outcomes was part of a deliberate incremental strategy to emphasise outcomes once the output management framework was in place. While Victorian public finance legislation does not require the specification of outcomes, in 2001 the Victorian Government released Growing Victoria Together, which sets out its long-term goals (or outcomes), including performance measures for social, environmental, and economic progress. Progress against these performance measures is reported annually in the Growing Victoria Together Progress Report published in the budget papers.http://www.dtf.vic.gov.au/CA25713E0002EF43/pages/dtf-projects- reforming-victoria%27s-public-finance-legislation-discussion-paper---chapter1 The Public Finance Bill Project In October 2008, the Financial Reform Division released a discussion paper detailing its intended reform of financial management in Victoria.http://www.dtf.vic.gov.au/CA25713E0002EF43/pages/dtf-projects- reforming-victoria%27s-public-finance-legislation-discussion-paper---Chapter4 The reforms will see *a focus on outcomes rather than outputs, *a move to simplify the definition of entities, and *an attempt to strengthen the relationship between the citizen and the state by increasing transparency and accountability.http://www.dtf.vic.gov.au/CA25713E0002EF43/pages/dtf-projects- reforming-victoria%27s-public-finance-legislation-discussion-paper---Chapter2 References Category:Former government agencies of Victoria (Australia) Category:Government finances in Australia Category:Government agencies disestablished in 2009 Category:2009 disestablishments in Australia ","title":"Financial Reform Division"},{"id":"22812028","text":"Krzysztof Lepianka (born June 6, 1956) is a Polish sprint canoer who competed in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

Carpenter was raised and educated in Lancaster, New York, and went into the stage and hotel business there. In 1833 he journeyed to Natchez, Mississippi, and began a career as a builder. He left Natchez in 1834 and went first to St. Louis, Missouri, then to New Orleans, Louisiana, in 1835. He returned to Natchez about 1838 and settled permanently, becoming owner of a line of steamboats and successful in the cotton trade and many other private and public interests. He married in 1837 at Buffalo, New York, to Miss Julia Ann Luce. He led a very full life, traveling throughout the United States, Europe, and the South Pacific islands.

It was first published in 1985 and has since been included in a single book with In the Path of the Storm and Battle for the Park in the \\"Second Omnibus\\" edition (Hutchinson, 1995). Plot summary Of the Farthing Wood animals Kestrel, Hare and Rabbit have died of old age, and as original Farthing Wood smaller animals have and have so many descendants with the animals native to White Deer Park the oath no longer applies to them. The Farthing Wood animals' third winter in White Deer Park has come to an end. As spring arrives there is an influx of animals from outside the park. Fox suspects that something outside the park is driving these animals to take shelter in the park, so Tawny Owl and Whistler search outside the park for clues. They find nothing, but word starts to spread of a fierce beast making raids in the park during the night. After searching the reserve and finding no sightings of the mysterious creature, Tawny Owl takes refuge in a tree in a small area of woodland within the park to rest. Before dawn he is awakened by the thought he is being watched. Looking down, he sees the head of a large creature with bright eyes looking at him in a menacing way. Knowing this is what he is looking for, Owl flies further up the tree out of reach, then notices the strange creature has disappeared in an instant. Owl then flies off to warn Fox and the others of his sighting just as the sun rises. Tawny Owl gives Fox a description of what he saw. Adder also hears of these developments. Though Adder says nothing, Fox thinks Adder is hiding something. Later Adder finds Toad and asks him about some large paw prints he has found near the now deserted Edible Frog's pond. Adder explains that as he does not have paws he cannot judge whether they are from a toad or not. Toad tells him these prints are too big for a toad. A meeting is called and Toad informs the animals of the footprints seen by himself and Adder. Badger states that the graceful nature of this animal reminds him of the Warden's cat and suggests that the animal might be a sort of cat. Tawny Owl pooh-poohs this suggestion. Not long afterwards meeting the Beast kills one of the white deer herd and Friendly discovers the carcass, then talks to some of his younger relatives about his plan to track the creature down. The Beast kills a white deer fawn and leaves few remains as evidence, so Friendly and the other foxes do not notice what has happened. The Warden does notice the losses and regularly patrols the area with a gun, but the Beast is not discovered. While fishing Whistler spots the Beast when it drinks from the stream, and sees that it is a very large cat. He tells Adder, who notices that the footprints are the same ones that he had seen before, and he decides to pursue the cat with the idea of poisoning it. However, the Beast traps Adder with its paw and toys with him, eventually knocking him into the stream which allows him to escape. Whistler tells Fox and Vixen of the creature he has seen and Weasel heads off to tell Badger the news. He arrives at Badger's set and discovers Badger talking to a young mole named Mossy, who is trying to tell Badger that Mole is his father. As Badger is unable to accept that Mole is dead Weasel asks Mossy to pretend to be Mole for Badger's sake. He then tells the other animals, who agree to go along with this idea. As the vixens are looking after their cubs Friendly gathers a group of male foxes - made up of Pace (Friendly's son), Husky (Bold's son), Ranger (Charmer's mate), Rusty (Ranger's son), and Trip (Ranger's son) - to join him on an expedition to search out the Beast. They head to the stream where the creature was seen by Whistler and follow its trail into an area of woodland. Friendly notices something stir in the undergrowth and heads off after it, but he is unable to stay on its trail. Initially the foxes wait for the Beast to return but Friendly lets the young foxes look for food, and they come across another young deer which was killed by the Beast. They feed off the remains of the carcass and head back, but the Beast watches them from a tree as they do so. Meanwhile, Adder comes across a female adder and tries to impress her with the story of his attack by the Beast, but she shows no interest in him and Adder slides away from her. Adder later tries to find the female adder but is unable to. The next day Whistler discovers that the Warden is setting up a pen by the perimeter of the reserve, and when Tawny Owl tells the animals that the deer are being rounded up they realise that the humans have decided to watch over them to keep them safe. The Beast also realises what the Warden is doing and decides to bide its time so the Warden will think it has left the Park. That evening Friendly and his group of foxes go in search of the Beast again, and its trail leads them to a small copse. Ranger thinks it is a trap but Friendly insists they go on. They enter cautiously but the Beast leaps down from a tree and grabs Husky in its jaws, before leaping back up carrying the young fox. The other foxes realise they are powerless against such a huge animal and leave to fetch help. Once they are gone the Beast drops Husky to the ground. Friendly and the young foxes look for Fox and Vixen, but they find Badger instead and tell him what has happened. Fox and Vixen soon return and Badger decides to offer himself to the Beast in exchange for Husky. He heads off but the foxes leave soon afterwards and reach the copse before him, only to discover that Husky is dead, and the Beast is long gone. Fox comes up with a plan and instructs the other animals to spread the word across the park that every inhabitant of the reserve must keep a lookout for clues and report anything they see immediately. The Warden realises that his attempt to lure the Beast has been unsuccessful and releases the deer back into the reserve. Later Adder comes across the female adder again, and she tells him that she has seen the Beast use a large hole in the bank by the stream. Adder finds this hole, then finds Whistler and tells him this information. Whistler immediately flies away to inform Fox, who decides to gather all the park's inhabitants together and try to trap the Beast in its lair. That evening all the animals have gathered together and they head towards the stream. They find the hole and Toad volunteers to search it for the Beast. He goes inside and discovers the creature sleeping inside, and Fox looks on the other side for another exit. However the Beast wakes up and leaves its lair, causing the group of animals to pull back in terror and watch as the cat washes itself, showing no interest at all in its audience. Eventually the cat takes a few laps from the stream and bounds away out of sight, as the animals can only watch, powerless to stop it. Most of the animals disperse, but Tawny Owl pursues the Beast through the air, eventually finding the large cat in a ditch near the perimeter of the reserve. Annoyed at being discovered, The Beast asks about Tawny Owl's interest in it, and Owl tells it how terrified all the park's inhabitants are of it. He asks the cat whether it could hunt somewhere else instead and it refuses, but it makes a pledge that no animal will ever see it again although it will still be around, and promises to leave the park if any creature should set eyes on it and tell it so. Tawny Owl decides to go tell all the animals about how he has spoken to the Beast, but being very tired he decides to sleep first. Now that the deer are back the Beast kills two more deer and stores them until the park's inhabitants have let their guard down. The Warden lays traps for the Beast, but it does not go near them and the Warden eventually decides to remove them. The Beast then goes on a rampage in Farthing Wood territory, killing several of the smaller creatures and nearly killing Leveret, but he escapes and his mate is killed instead. Adder meets the female adder again and she tells him that she would like to be known as Sinuous. They sunbathe together and Sinuous suggests that the Beast may be living underground. Adder immediately tells Badger and Fox about this theory, and all the foxes, badgers, weasels and rabbits in the park are asked whether they know of a large underground lair, but none do. Badger tells Mossy about the theory and Mossy informs him of a large underground chamber that Mirthful had come across before she died. Badger asks Mossy to find the chamber and inform him if the Beast is living there so that Badger can spot the cat and force it to leave. Mossy starts his search, but he gets distracted by worms and loses focus. However, he eventually falls into a large chamber and discovers that the Beast is sleeping inside. He tries to leave quickly but the Beast wakes up and pursues him. Mossy digs underground but the Beast digs after him until Tawny Owl shouts out that he has seen the cat and asks him to yield. The cat roars loudly and Badger arrives, asking the Beast to take him instead of Mossy. The Beast tells the animals he could easily slay them all, but just then they all hear the loud cry of another cat in the distance. The two cats call to each other and the Beast rushes out of the park to join the female that was calling to him. The animals realize that spring must be the mating season for the Beast and celebrate that the Beast has finally left the park. Reception This proved to be the poorest received of all the Farthing Wood series, possibly because it is only resolved in the end by a deus ex machina – unlike the other books where the animals work together to overcome their problems. Characters in The Siege of White Deer ParkTV series The main plot of this book is not covered in the television series possibly due to its extreme peril themes being too frightening for younger audiences. However, the sub-plot featuring Badger mistaking Mossy for his dead father Mole was included in the second season, while Adder meeting Sinuous was included in the third season.

Known for his theory of closure, he is director of the Institute of Art and Ideas and founder of the philosophy festival HowTheLightGetsIn. He has also had a journalistic and documentary career, and is the founder of TVF Media. Biography Hilary Lawson was born and grew up in Bristol, England, the only son of Harold Lawson and his wife Norma (née Gear). Awarded a scholarship whilst an undergraduate at Balliol College Oxford he gained a first in PPE. As a post-graduate he came to see paradoxes of self-reference as the central philosophical issueClosure: A Story of Everything; Routledge (2001) p.328 and began a DPhil on The Reflexivity of Discourse. This later became the basis for his first philosophical book Reflexivity: The Post-Modern Predicament.HarperCollins Publishers Ltd, 21 November 1985 Alongside his philosophical writing, Lawson pursued a media career. Within a few years he had created his own prime time television series Where There's LifeWhere There's Life, Michael Joseph, 1982. with a weekly UK audience in excess of ten million.BFI National Library and BFI National Archive, JICTAR Weekly Audience TV Reports (1981) In 1982 Hilary Lawson co- authored a book based on the series. At 28, he was appointed Editor of Programmes and later Deputy Chief Executive at the television station TV-am. Meanwhile, he continued to develop his philosophical thinking and had initial sketches of the theory later to become Closure.Closure: A Story of Everything; Routledge (2001) In 1985 he wrote Reflexivity: The Post-Modern Predicament (1985), as part of a series on modern European thought. The book argued that the paradoxes of self-reference are central to philosophy and drive the writings of Nietzsche, Heidegger and Derrida. In the late 1980s he founded the production company TVF Mediahttp://www.tvf.co.uk/ which made documentary and current affairs programming, including Channel 4's flagship international current affairs programme, The World This Week. Hilary Lawson was editor of the programme which ran weekly between 1987 and 1991.BFI The programme predicted the fall of the Berlin Wall, the war in Yugoslavia and the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. In the 1990s, he focused on writing Closure. It took a decade to complete and was published in 2001.Closure: A Story of Everything; Routledge (2002 edition), page 328 The book has been described as the first non-realist metaphysics. Having begun his philosophical career as a proponent of postmodernism latterly he became a critic arguing for the necessity of an overall framework and the need to move on from a focus on language.iai.tv/video/the-limits-of-my-world Applying the framework of openness and closure to the visual medium, he created the first video paintings in 2001http://www.opengallery.co.uk/video-art/hilary-lawson with the aim of escaping narrative closure. He went on to found the Artscape Project in 2003, which brought a collective of artists together to develop the new medium.http://www.opengallery.co.uk/philosophy Lawson founded the Institute of Art and Ideas in 2008 with the aim of making ideas and philosophy a central part of cultural life. IAI.tv was launched in 2011. IAI news in 2013 and the IAI Academy in 2014.http://iai.tv/home/host/hilary-lawson =Philosophical work= Hilary Lawson's theory 'closure' proposes that the human condition is to find ourselves on the cusp of openness and closure. The world is open and we, along with other living organisms, are able to apprehend and make sense of it through the process of closure. Lawson defines closure as the holding of that which is different as one and the same.Closure, Routledge (2001), page 4 Human experience is seen to be the result of successive layers of closure, which Lawson describes as preliminary, sensory and inter-sensory closure. The highest level of closure, inter-sensory closure realises language and thought.Closure, Routledge (2001), page 27 ff The theory shifts the focus of philosophy away from language and towards an exploration of the relationship between openness and closure. An important element of the theory of closure is its own self-referential character. The framework of closure enables Lawson to give an account of the relationship between language and the world that does not rely on reference and which he argues overcomes the problem of how language is hooked onto the world that has beset twentieth century philosophy.Closure, Routledge (2001), page 59 ff One of the consequences of the theory is that philosophical oppositions, between language and the world, fact and value, are no longer regarded as oppositions and instead are seen as a consequence of the play of closure and openness. As a result, science is not in opposition to art and religion but in a different relationship to openness and closure. Lawson proposes that science is 'driven by the search for closure'.Closure: A Story of Everything; Routledge (2002 edition), page 144 The pursuit of closure cannot however succeed and in the failure of closure openness is uncovered. Art in contrast is described as 'the pursuit of openness and the avoidance of closure'.Closure, Routledge (2001), page 206 In turn the pursuit of openness cannot succeed and elements of closure remain. Lawson began his philosophical development at Oxford University, one of the primary centres of the analytic school. While still an undergraduate he became convinced that problems of self-reference undermined the analytic project. His trajectory to this conclusion started with the reflexive problems of relativism which were explored with the political theorist, Steven Lukes; continued with an examination of Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico- Philosophicus, with the translator BF McGuiness; and were cemented in conversation with Alan Montefiore who had close links with Jacques Derrida and was aware of similarities of argument and approach. As can be seen from the pamphlet After Truth - A Post Modern ManifestoAfter Truth - A Post Modern Manifesto, Inventions Press UK, 1986. written in collaboration with Hugh Tomlinson the translator of a number of Deleuze's works, under the pseudonym the 2nd of January group,http://www.radicalphilosophy.com/tag/the-second-of- january-group Hilary Lawson's approach increasingly diverged from the mainstream of analytic philosophy having more in common with the American philosopher Richard Rorty and the French philosopher Jacques Derrida. Rorty collaborated on his film Science...Fiction?New Scientist Review 27 Feb 1986 p.53Horizon, BBC, tx 17 February 1986 which argued that \\"science is not powerful because it is true, but true because it is powerful\\" and took part in a subsequent documentary film of his on Plato entitled The First World. Rorty also contributed to a collection of essays co-edited by Hilary Lawson: Dismantling Truth: Reality in the Post-Modern World.Dismantling Truth: Reality in the Post-Modern World Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1989. Lawson's subsequent work can be seen as a response to the writings of Rorty and Derrida, and an attempt to overcome the self-referential paradoxes in which he believed they were mired. While in his early work he is a proponent of postmodernism he has latterly become a critic arguing for a return to metaphysics and the necessity of an overall theory. This is apparent in his public debates with John Searle, Simon Blackburn,http://iai.tv/video/after-relativism and others.iai.tv/video/after-postmodernity =Books= In Reflexivity Hilary Lawson argued that self-reference was central to contemporary philosophy. Using Nietzsche, Heidegger and Derrida as the main examples, he sought to show that reflexivity was the primary motor of their work. It was implicit that similar arguments could be applied to Wittgenstein and the analytic tradition. The introduction to Closure, referred to as the Prologue, extends the arguments put forward in Reflexivity to the broader philosophical tradition. It argues that issues of self-reference undermine currently available philosophical positions. The main body of the book describes the process of closure and the means by which we can intervene in the world and seemingly understand it. In doing so it seeks to demonstrate that meaning and understanding are not dependent on notions of reference and truth, arguing that although there is nothing in common between closure and openness this does not limit our ability to intervene successfully in the world. Other books include Dismantling Truth: Science in Post-Modern Times, and Closure: A Story of Everything. Articles include After Truth, On Integrity, Philosophy As, and The Poetic Strategy.

Art Lawson shot his first video paintings, Orange and Grey, and Cusp in 2001 and 2002. He founded the Artscape Project in 2003 consisting of a collective of artists, including William Raban, Sarah Turner, Sanchita Islam and Isabelle Inghillieri, whose aim was to develop and explore the medium of the video painting. The Artscape Project is now represented by Open Gallery. The video painting flows from his philosophical outlook and constitutes a break from the film-making narratives that had been his focus for more than a decade. Hilary Lawson sees video painting as a means to encourage the viewer to escape everyday closures and approach openness, or what Heidegger would have called Being. In 2003 he was instrumental in developing a technology with computer scientists which enabled video paintings to be stored and played in such a manner that their order did not repeat but was also not random. The software and technology (known as Laluna) were created in order to allow video paintings to be integrated and put together so that they could constitute collections of work that never repeated or recapitulated, and yet had structure. His video painting work has been exhibited at: the Hayward Gallery (2006);http://www.haywardgallery.org.uk/; Sketch (2007),http://www.sketch.uk.com/ the ICA (2007), and The Globe at Hay gallery (2008). Now Revisited, performed at Shunt, London in 2009, was a video painting installation in five acts in which the audience found themselves the subject of the work. Hilary Lawson is also the owner of Quarter in Clifton, Bristol which includes the Clifton Hotels, Clifton Short Lets, Studio 31 and the Berkeley Suites.

It is the seat of the Municipalité régionale de la Nouvelle-Beauce, in Chaudière-Appalaches. The population was 12,889 as of the Canada 2011 Census, and was 99.0% French- speaking as of 2006. It is located south-east of Quebec City, on the Chaudière River. History The seigneurie of Sainte-Marie-de-la-Nouvelle-Beauce was granted to Thomas-Jacques Taschereau in 1736. He chose the name in honour of his wife, Marie-Claire de Fleury de La Gorgendière. The religious parish was founded in 1737 and the municipality in 1845. The territory of Sainte-Marie was divided on several occasions, as population increased, in order to found neighbouring communities: Saint-Bernard, Saint-Isidore, Saint-Maxime-de-Scott (now Scott), Sainte-Marguerite, Sainte-Hénédine, Saint-Sylvestre, Saint- Elzéar, Saint-Séverin, Saints-Anges, and Vallée-Jonction. In 1913, the territory was split again, following the detachment of the village (urban part of the territory) from the parish municipality (rural part). In 1958, the village was constituted as a city and in 1959, Sainte-Marie-de-la-Nouvelle- Beauce was renamed as Sainte-Marie. In 1978, the city and the parish municipality governments amalgamated.

He was a Gladstone Prizeman of the University and President of the Union. He also attended Westminster College, Cambridge, the theological college for the Presbyterian Church. In 1913 he married Ida Lillie Taylor and they had two sons. CareerUnited Kingdom= Stewart went in for the law. He was admitted as a solicitor in 1905.The Solicitors' Journal, Volume 98, Pt 2, 1954 p809 He later qualified as a barrister, was called to the Bar at the Inner Temple in 1919The Times, 3 July 1919 p4 and practised on the North-Eastern Circuit. In 1945 he became one of the Chairmen of the Pensions Appeal Tribunals under the Pensions Tribunals Act, 1943. The Tribunals considered claims for pensions by members of the armed services and war-injured civilians and their families.The Times, 2 September 1942 p2 =Colonial service= From the mid-1920s Stewart took up appointments in the Colonial Legal Service. He was a magistrate, Judge of Petty Civil Court and Coroner of the County of Victoria in Trinidad from 1927–1929. He served as Assistant Legal Adviser at the Colonial Office, 1929–30 and as Legal Adviser to the Governor of Malta, 1930–33. From July–August 1932 he briefly held the rank of Deputy Governor of Malta. He was a member of the Nominated and Privy Councils of Malta and Examiner in English Literature and History in the University of Malta.

He achieved the rank of Major in the Royal Artillery, serving in the Reserve from 1921–1928. PoliticsLocal politics= Stewart was elected as a member of the Newcastle Board of Guardians in 1909 and served until 1912. In that year he was elected to Newcastle City Council and later became a member of the Education Committee. He stayed on the council until 1924. =Workington= Stewart first stood for Parliament at the 1918 general election as Liberal candidate for the Workington Division of Cumberland.The Times House of Commons 1919; Politico's Publishing 2004, p48 He was one of those candidates who was awarded the Coalition Coupon but repudiated it.F W S Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results 1918–1949; Political Reference Publications, Glasgow, 1949 p318 He stated that while he had supported the coalition government during the war, he did not want to commit himself to supporting it on every issue after the war. Lancashire Evening Post 7 Dec 1918 This did him little good, for whereas the Coalition won a great victory in 1918, Stewart made no real impression at Workington. The seat was won for Labour by the secretary of the Cumberland Miners' Association, Thomas Cape. The Unionist Lt Col D J Mason was second, Stewart finished third with an Independent candidate at the bottom of the poll. =Stockton-on-Tees= For the 1922 general election Stewart switched seats to contest Stockton-on-Tees in County Durham. In a three-cornered fight the seat was held by the sitting Coalition Liberal MP, John Bertrand Watson, who this time stood under the description National Liberal – that is as a supporter of the outgoing Prime Minister David Lloyd George. Stewart came third in a three-cornered fight behind Watson and Labour's Frederick Fox Riley, who was to win the seat at the 1929 election.F W S Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results 1918–1949; Political Reference Publications, Glasgow, 1949 p250 In 1923, Stewart fought Stockton again. Watson having stood down, Stewart now faced a Conservative candidate, Harold Macmillan, the future Prime Minister, with Riley again representing Labour. In a close three-way fight Stewart just beat Macmillan by a majority of 73 votes, with Riley only about 1,000 votes behind. By 1924 however the Conservative Party had revived and British politics was reverting to a two-party system, with Labour replacing the Liberals as the main force on the left. The Liberals saw a huge decline of support, particularly in industrial and urban seats.Michael Kinnear, The British Voter: An Atlas and Survey since 1885; Cornell University Press, 1968 p46 This pattern was repeated in Stockton. Macmillan recounted in his memoirs how moderate Liberals and some Conservatives who had voted Liberal in 1923 on the ground that Stewart was the most likely candidate to keep Labour out, were now coming over to him and how, as the days progressed, it became more and more clear it was a straight fight between him and Labour.Harold Macmillan, Winds of Change: 1914–1939; Macmillan, 1966 p153-154 Macmillan took the seat with 42% of the poll and a majority of 3,215 over Riley. Stewart came bottom of the poll with 25% of the votes. Stewart did not stand for re-election to the House of Commons again. Other interests Stewart listed his recreations as music, acting and stamp collecting but he clearly had a penchant for football too. He was a director of Newcastle United F.C. from 1915–1927.

The tribe was named by the name of their grandfather, Imam Muhammad Al-Baqir, one of the grandsons of the faithful Ali ibn Abi Talib. The Baggara tribe is considered the largest Syrian tribe, and its men were known for their patriotism and strength, they fought the French colonization in immortal exploits, and were known for their generosity. Baggara tribespeople In Syria mainly live west of Deir al-Zour city, ranging from the northern banks of the Euphrates to the Raqqa provincial border, in villages from Al-Husseiniyah (الحسينية) to Mahamidah (محيميدة) , where the Baggara’s chiefdom family lives, to al-Kasrat, al-Kubar/Jazrat al-Boshams (الكبر) , and Jazra Al-Milaj (جزرة ميلاج) , spanning a distance of some 80 km. East of Deir al-Zour, the Baggara live in smaller numbers in the villages of Meratt (مراط), Khusham, and Jadid Baggara (جديد بكّارة), Sources suggest a total of approximately 100,000 Baggara live in these areas east and west of the city. Although accurate figures are not available, a large number of people of Baggara lineage have integrated into Deir al-Zour city in fact, some say a full one-third of the city’s residents have roots in the tribe, Prominent Baggara families there are Fadel Al-Aboud, Al-Ayesh, Al-Ayyash, where they had a major role in the political leadership of the city of Deir al-Zour.Al-Baggara، Wikipedia. Other regions where the Baggara live include Hasaka province, in an area known as Baggara Al-Jabal (Baggara Mountain), Raqqa the city of Aleppo and other northern towns, and Idlib. Some reports indicate that their number in Syria as now exceeding one million.  Religion  Al-Baggara were originally Sunni Muslims Until the late 20th century, when some of them started to convert to Shia Islam, especially in Hatla Village in Deir al-Zour, and Shia campaigns increased after the outbreak of the Syrian civil war in 2011. Structure The tribe encompasses the following clans, mostly in Deir al-Zour province but also in Hasaka, Raqqa, and Aleppo: * Abu Arab clan, This clan, for which the Al-Bashir family is central, inhabits Mahamidah, the effective capital of the Baggara tribe in Syria. * Al-Abdulkarim clan, This is the largest and most influential Baggara clan and is divided into four lineages: Al-Hawara, Al- Qataa, Al-Maazat, and Al-Sayyad. Decades ago, Al-Abdulkarim clansmen lived in the Deir al-Zour district known as Al-Sayyad—an etymological reference to the tribe’s purported genealogical link to Muhammad Al-Baqir (the Fifth Imam), a descendant of the Prophet. Major families in Deir al-Zour city who belong to the Al-Abdulkarim from \\"Alsada\\" family include Al-Aboud, Al-Aish, Al-Ayash, Fakoush, Al-Talaa, Hattab, Al-Harwal, and others. These families also live in Jadid Baggara, the only village in Syria with the namesake of the tribe. * Abu Maesh clan, The Al-Talaa family holds the chief position. * Al-Ghassem Al- Obied and Al-Hamad Al-obied clan. * Abu Masaah clan, Chiefdom is held by the Al-Masawi family. * Al-klizat clan, Residents of Umm Madifah and Khawirah villages. * Al-Gharangah clan, Chief family is Batran, located in Umm Eshbah. * Abu Hamdan clan, Chiefdom is held by the Al-Wakaa family. * Baggara Aljabal clan. * Abu Rahmah clan, lives in Al-Tabeh and Dahla. * Abu Sheikh clan. * Abu Badranclan.

This clan resides in villages of Jazira Abu Hamad. * Al-Mreikat clan. * Abu Saleh clan. Residing in al-Kasrat, the keyfamily is Al-Abdullah. * AL-Halaymiah clan. * Al-Mashhour clan, This clan resides in Tal Abyad, near the Turkish border. The chief family, Balikh Al-Tahri, opposes Assad yet supported the Iraqi Baath Party formerly led by Saddam Hussein, Most clansmen have backed anti-Assad activities, and most have ended up on the Turkish side of the border. * Abu Mislim clan. * Al-Abdulqader clan. * Al-Khangar clan. This clan resides in the village of Meratt. * Al-Rashied clan. * Abu Shames clan. This clan resides in Hawayij Shinan, in eastern Raqqa, the chief family is Al-Hayawi. * Abu Sultan clan. * Baggra of Aleppo city. Economy Most Baggara tribespeople are farmers who cultivate fruit trees and vegetables, and some of them were engaged in business and became prominent businessmen in Syria, and many Baggara tribespeople work for the Syrian government, largely in Deir al-Zour, after which they return home to their surrounding suburbs or villages and Large numbers of Baggara also work in Lebanon and the Persian Gulf states. Politics The Syrian National Congress in 1919 Baggara tribespeople who live in Deir al-Zour city have a long political history, Where some of the families of the tribe as Fadel Al-Aboud, Al-Ayesh, Al-Ayyash from the Abdulkarim clan led the city of Deir al-Zour since the Ottoman era and continued during the occupation of English and French and Some of the tribe leaders fought French and English colonialism, such as the leader Ayyash Al- Haj, who was exiled by the French authorities with his family to the city of Jableh in 1925 and executed some of his sons after being accused of preparing a revolution in Deir el-Zour to relieve pressure on the area of Jabal Al-Arab during the Great Syrian Revolution in 1925.Bukhapur revolution with dates and evidence، Website Al-Muhasan City..

After the formation of the Syrian state, Minister Mohamed Al-Ayesh emerged as the first minister in the Eastern Province and continued for many years and was known as a man of ministries. In the modern era, Baggara tribespeople supported the Baath and Nasserist parties, One tribesman from the Abdulkarim clan, Yassin Al-Hafiz (1930–78), noted for his intellectualism, served as an architect of Baath Party ideology. A large number of tribespeople belong to the Baath wings in both Syria and Iraq, and The Baggara tribe also includes members of the Communist Party. Many of Baggara tribespeople joined the Baath Party primarily for benefits and government employment, But many quickly turned against the regime and joined the 2011 uprising, During this period of anti-Assad activism, Sheikh Nawaf Ragheb Al-Bashir delivered anti-regime speeches attended by tribespeople who traveled to Deir al-Zour from their nearby villages. Originally, Sheikh Nawaf joined the Party of Socialist Unitarians and called for pan-Arabism, then he supports Iran’s Shia ideology and the Shia coalition in Syria.

Fadel Aboud Al-Hassan or Haj Fadel Al-Aboud, a Syrian leader and head of the Haj Fadel government in eastern Syria after the Ottomans left the region in 1918. Al-Hassan was born in Deir al-Zour in 1872 for Al-Hassan family from the Abo Obaid clan from Al- Baggara tribe. Al-Hassan was of high social standing in Deir al-Zour, which enabled him to take over the leadership from his father Aboud Hassan. Al- Hassan worked in trade and had extensive commercial relations with Turkish merchants and Halbians, and with his cousins Najjar and Tayfur in the city of Hama.Alshamary, Anwar, Biggest Baggara Tribe, Dar Almaref, Homs, 1996, Page: 363.. When the trouble broke out in the city of Deir al-Zour after the Ottomans left on 6 November 1918, people began looting and stealing from each other across the area, so it was necessary to have a strong authority for protecting the city and its people and that led Al-Hassan who was the mayor to form his first government in the city and asking all tribal leaders in the villages and surrounding districts to support him and pledge allegiance to him. One of the priorities of this government was maintain the security and running the affairs of the city. This government later known as the \\"government of Haj Fadel\\".Alayyash، Abdul Qader، Prepare: Walid al-Mashouh، Hadarat Wady Alfurat ،Al Ahali for printing publishing and distribution، First Edition، 1989، P 152.. The government continued until the arrival of Sharif Nasser, the cousin of Prince Faisal Bin Al-Hussein, on 1 December 1918, and Mari Basha Al-Mallah on 7 December 1918. After the Battle of Maysalun on 24 July 1920 and occupation of Damascus by French forces, The city of Deir Ezzor was in a state of chaos and insecurity, which prompted Al-Hassan to form his second government, Which has done great services in protecting the city and maintaining the security of its people despite its limited capabilities. This government continued its work until 23 November 1920, when it was dissolved by a decision of the French occupation authorities.Alayyash، Abdul Qader، Prepare: Walid al-Mashouh، Hadarat Wady Alfurat ،Al Ahali for printing publishing and distribution، First Edition، 1989، P 154.. Al-Hassan represented the Euphrates region at the Syrian National Congress held in late June 1919, which proclaimed the independence of Syria and establishment of the Syrian Arab Kingdom on 8 March 1920, and appointed Faisal bin Sharif Hussein as a king. Al-Hassan participated in the coronation of Faisal as king of Iraq on 23 August 1921 and supported his inauguration.Alshamary, Anwar, Biggest Baggara Tribe, Dar Almaref, Homs, 1996, Page: 362..Syrian National Congress، Arabic Wikipedia. Al-Hassan died in 1936 in Deir al-Zour and was buried there. His sons continued his political work. His son, Dr. Badri Fadel Aboud, became the Minister of Health in the government of Said Al-Ghazi in 1955, under the presidency of President Shukri Al-Quwatli. He was the first Minister of Health from Deir al-Zour. =Ayyash Al-Haj= Ayyash Al-Haj Ayyash Al-Haj Hussein Al- Jassim, a Syrian leader from Deir al-Zour city, began the armed struggle against the French colonizer in governorate of Deir al-Zour in 1925 coinciding with the outbreak of the Great Syrian Revolution in Jabal al-Arab and Ghouta of Damascus. He was sentenced by the French to exile to Jableh city with his family after they were convicted of planning and carrying out several military operations against the French forces, the latest was in \\"Ain Albu Gomaa\\". They also sentenced his eldest son Mohammed 20 years in prison on the island of Arwad, and executed his son Mahmoud by shooting with a number of other revolutionaries. Ayyash was born in Deir al-Zour in 1864 for Al-Haj family from the Abo Obaid clan from Al-Baggara tribe., He grew up in a national family that contributed to the struggle against the colonizers throughout history, Therefore, Ayyash was liking his city and his homeland, and a lover of its material and immaterial traditions, and that is why he devoted most of his life to the service and protection of his city. When the Ottomans left Deir ez-Zor, Ayyash Al-Haj contributed to protecting the people of Deir ez-Zor from the chaos and the absence of security left by the absence of the Ottoman authority. He formed a local government known as Haj Fadel Government with the dignitaries of Deir ez-Zor, headed by his cousin from the Abu Obaid clan, Fadel Al-Aboud in 1918. He established a national army from the people of the city with Mr. Omar Al-'Abd Al-'Aziz and Mr. Khalaf Al-'Abd Al-Hamid to counter the invasion of the English and clashed with them at the site of Salhiya in 1919. Ayyash Al-Haj also contributed to resolving many conflicts and revolutions between the people of Deir ez-Zor and between them and the people of the countryside due to his close ties with Al-Baggara tribes, his cousins and close friends of the Albu Saraya clan, who later participated with his sons in the formation of armed revolutionary groups against the French forces. The French sentenced him to exile in the city of Jableh with his family members in 1925, they also sentenced his eldest son Mohammad to 20 years' imprisonment and executed his son Mahmoud by firing squad, after being convicted of planning and carrying out several military operations against French forces in Syria, the most recent of which was the epic of Ain Bou Juma in 1925. Ayyash and his family left to their exile in the city of Jableh where the people of the city embraced him and were respected him for their struggle and virtues. Shortly after Ayyash Al-Haj family's living in Jableh, The French authorities assassinated Ayyash Al-Haj in a cafe outside the city by poisoning his coffee, and prevented the transfer of his body to Deir Ezzor city for reasons of public security, He was buried in Jableh in the cemetery of Sultan Ibrahim ibn Adham Mosque where the absent prayers held for the spirit of this martyr mujahid in all the Syrian cities.

The campaign was fought during the Chinese Civil War in the post-World War II era, and resulted in communist victory. Campaign Before the nationalist government withdrew from North China, it ordered troops left behind to join local bandits to fight guerrilla war against the communists. To further boost the fighting capabilities of bandits, many military professionals were sent to the bands of bandits without any significant former nationalist troop presence, so that their military operations could be strengthened. The size of each band of bandits various, from the smallest of barely a dozen to the largest consisting of several thousands, usually, the typical size was several hundred. In March 1949, the bandit activity reached its peak, totaling a hundred and three attacks. The future field marshal of the communist force, Nie Rongzhen was in charge of eradicating bandits in northern China. In April 1949, orders were given to suppress local bandits, emphasizing on not to underestimate these bandits. A month later, a conference on bandit suppression was held, setting the strategies that included adopting political pressure against bandits, and mobilizing the general populace to eliminate the social bases of bandits. In June 1949, further strategies were devised, concentrating on using small striking force in quick assaults, instead of ineffective large formation that was easy to be discovered and slow moving. The communists came to important realization that the nationalist force left behind and deserters would be a huge reserve for bandits if left unattended. Nie Rongzhen ordered communist forces to immediately accept the surrender of deserters of nationalist force and providing for them so that their livelihood would be stabilized, and thus preventing them from turning into bandits. By June 1949, over thirty-seven thousand former nationalist troops left behind had surrendered, and the communists eliminated a huge potential threat. After a year of fighting, the campaign was finally concluded with a communist victory with the annihilation of over twenty-nine thousand bandits. The communist victory ensured that Beijing, the new capital of the People's Republic of China became relatively safe in the infancy of the new nation. Outcome Although sharing the common anticommunist goal, the nationalist guerrilla and insurgency warfare was largely handicapped by the enlistment of bandits, many of whom had fought and killed nationalist troops earlier in the eradication / pacification campaign, and also looted, kidnapped and even killed landlords and business owners, an important faction that supported the nationalist government, but now must united against the common enemy, which is half- hearted at the best. Compounding the problem further with additional differences within the ranks of the nationalist guerillas themselves, the futile nationalist guerrilla and insurgency warfare against its communist enemy was destined to fail.

The book was published in English in May 2009, to coincide with the twentieth anniversary of the clearing of the square by tanks on June 4, 1989. It is based on a series of about thirty audio tapes recorded secretly by Zhao while he was under house arrest in 1999 and 2000. Co-editor Adi Ignatius pinpoints a meeting held at Deng Xiaoping's home on May 17, 1989, less than three weeks before the suppression of the Tiananmen protests, as the key moment in the book. When Zhao argued that the government should look for ways to ease tensions with the protesters, two conservative officials immediately criticized him. Deng then announced he would impose martial law. Zhao commented: \\"I refused to become the General Secretary who mobilized the military to crack down on students.\\" In the last chapter, Zhao praises the Western system of parliamentary democracy and says that it is the only way China can solve its problems of corruption and a growing gap between the rich and poor.

I knew that if I persistently upheld my view, I would ultimately be compelled to step down. *On the night of June 3, while sitting in the courtyard with my family, I heard intense gunfire. A tragedy to shock the world had not been averted, and was happening after all. =On democracy= *They (i.e. the democratic systems of socialist nations) are all just superficial.

For the next sixteen years of his life, Zhao lived in forced seclusion in a quiet Beijing alley. Although minor details of his life leaked out, China scholars lamented that Zhao's account of events was to remain unknown. Zhao's production of the memoir, in complete secrecy, is the only surviving public record of the opinions and perspectives Zhao held later in his life.Ignatius, Adi. \\"Preface\\". In Zhao Ziyang.

Zhao began secretly recording his autobiography on children's cassette tapes in 1999, and eventually completed approximately thirty tapes, each about six minutes in length. Zhao produced his audio journals by recording over inconspicuous low-quality tapes which were readily available in his home: children's music and Peking Opera. Zhao indicated the tapes' intended order by faint pencil markings, and no titles or notes on how Zhao intended the tapes to be otherwise interpreted or presented were ever recovered. The voices of several of Zhao's closest friends were heard in several of the later tapes, but were edited out of the published book in order to protect their identities. After the tapes' creation, Zhao smuggled them out of his residence by passing them to these friends. In order to minimize the risk that some tapes might be lost or confiscated, each participant was only entrusted with a small part of the total work. Because he could only produce the tapes during periods in which his guards were absent, the process of recording the tapes took over a year. Bao Pu, one of the editors who worked on publishing Zhao's memoir, first learned of the tapes' existence only after Zhao's death on January 17, 2005. It took several years for Bao to collect them and gain legal permission from Zhao's family to publish Zhao's autobiography.Pomfret, John. \\"The Tiananmen Tapes: Zhao Ziyang's Memoir Criticizes Chinese Communist Party\\".

The campaign was fought during the Chinese Civil War in the post-World War II era and resulted in communist victory. This campaign is part of Campaign to Suppress Bandits in Fujian. Strategies The nationalists had faced a precarious dilemma in waging the campaign against its communist enemy because of complex situation they had faced, and consequently, made several grave miscalculations which contributed to their eventual failure. =Nationalist miscalculations= Like other nationalist futile attempts to fight guerrilla and insurgency warfare against the communists after being driven off from mainland China, the very first grave strategic miscalculation made by the retreating nationalist government contributed at least equally if not greater than the enemy's political and military pressure to the nationalist defeat in this campaign. The very first strategic miscalculation made by the retreating nationalist government was identical to the earlier one the nationalist government had made immediately after World War II, when it had neither the sufficient troops nor enough transportation assets to be deployed into the Japanese-occupied regions of China, and unwilling to let these regions falling into communist hands, the nationalist government ordered the Japanese and their turncoat Chinese puppet government not to surrender to the communists and allowed them to keep their fighting capabilities to \\"maintain order\\" in the Japanese occupied regions by fighting off the communists. This earlier miscalculation resulted in further alienation and resentment to the nationalist government by the local population, which had already blamed the nationalists for losing the regions to the Japanese invaders during the war. Half a decade later when the nationalists were driven from mainland China, they had made the similar miscalculation once again in their desperation, this time by enlisting the help of local bandits to fight the communists, and ordering the nationalist troops left behind to join these bandits in the struggle against the communism. However, the bandits were deeply feared and hated by the local populace they plagued for so long, and nationalist troops left behind joining the bandits certainly did not help them win the support of the general population. In fact, it served the exact opposite, strengthening the popular support of their communist enemy. The second grave strategic miscalculation made by the retreating nationalist government was also similar to the one the nationalist government had made immediately after World War II, when it attempted to simultaneously solve the warlord problem that had plagued China for so long with the problem of the exterminating communists together: those warlords allied with Chiang Kai-shek's nationalist government were only interested in keeping their own power and defected to the Japanese side when Japanese invaders offered to let them keep their power in exchange for their collaborations. After World War II, these forces of former Japanese puppet governments once again returned to the nationalist camp for the same reason they defected to the Japanese invaders. Obviously, it was difficult for Chiang to immediately get rid of these warlords for good as soon as they surrendered to Chiang and rejoined nationalists, because such move would alienate other factions within the nationalist ranks, and those former Japanese puppet government's warlords could still help the nationalists to by holding on to what was under their control and fighting off communists, and they and the communists would both be weakened. Similarly, the bandits the nationalist governments had failed to exterminate were obviously not good candidates for evacuation to Taiwan half a decade later, and using them to fight communists appeared to be the only logical alternative. If the communists were great weakened by the bandits, then it would the nationalists would have easier time in their counterattacks to retake China. If the bandits were defeated, then the nationalists would have easier job to eradicate them later after retaking China. However, just like those warlords, these bandits were only interested in keeping their own power also, and thus did not put any real efforts to fight the communists like some of the nationalists who were dedicated to their political cause. The eradication of bandits by the communist government only strengthened its popular support since previous governments (including the nationalist government itself) dating back from Qing Dynasty had failed to do so. The third grave strategic miscalculation made by the retreating nationalist government was similar to the second one, but this one was about its own troops left behind. The nationalist government had faced a dilemma: the highly disciplined troops were in desperate need to defend Taiwan, the last nationalist island sanctuary. The less disciplined second rate and undisciplined third rate troops, both of which mostly consisted of warlords' troop were definitely not suited to be withdrawn to defend the last stand nationalists had made, and they were not given the top priority for evacuation. Instead, they were left behind to fight the communists behind the enemy line, but such move had alienated many of the troops left behind, and it was impossible to expect them to fight their communist enemy with the same kind of dedication like those nationalist agents who believed in their political cause. Compounding the problem, due to the need of bandits' knowledge of local area, they were often rewarded with higher ranks than the nationalist troops left behind. As a result, the former-nationalist regular troops turned guerrilla fighters lacked any willingness to work together with the bandits they once attempted to exterminate, especially when many of the bandits had killed their comrades-in-arms earlier in the battles of eradications / pacifications. Many loyal nationalists were enraged by the fact that they had to serve under the former-enemy they once fought. Similarly, the bandits lacked the similar willingness and attempted to expend those nationalist troops whenever they could in order to save their own lives. The fourth grave strategic miscalculation made by the retreating nationalist government was financial / economical: due to the lack of money, those bandits turned guerrillas were mostly provided with arms, but not sufficient supplies and money. The bandits turned guerrillas had no problem of looting the local population to get what they need, as they had done for decades, which inevitably drove the general popular support further into the communist side. The little financial support provided by the nationalist government was simply not enough to support such guerrilla and insurgency warfare on such a large scale. Another unexpected but disastrous result of the insufficient financial support was that it had greatly eroded the support of the nationalist government within its own ranks. The wealthy landowners and businessmen were the strong supporters of nationalist government and as their properties were confiscated by the communists and redistributed to the poor, their hatred toward the communist government was enough to cause many of them to stay behind voluntarily to fight behind the enemy lines. However, the landowners and businessmen were also longtime victims of bandits due to their wealth, and many of them had suffered even more than the general populace who had far less wealth. As these former landowners and businessmen turned guerrilla fighters were ordered to join their former bandits who once threatened, looted, kidnapped and even killed them and their relatives, it was obvious that such cooperation was mostly in name only and could not produce any actual benefits, and the alienation and discontent toward the nationalist government harbored by these once ardent nationalists would only grow greater. Another problem for the nationalists was the strong disagreement among themselves over how to fight the war against their communist enemy. Military professionals preferred to fight a total war, incapacitate the enemy's ability to fight, but this inevitably conflicted with the interest of another faction of strong supporters of the nationalist government: the landowners and businessmen, who joined bandits to oppose such tactic. The reason was that landowners and businessmen supporting and joining the nationalist guerrilla firmly believed that the nationalists would be able to retake mainland China within several years and they would be able to regain their lost lands, businesses, and other properties that were confiscated and redistributed to the poor by the communists. As the nationalist military professionals in the guerrilla suggested and destroyed the production facilities and businesses as part of the total war, the landowners and businessmen would not be able to regain any valuable properties after the return of the nationalist government because those properties had been destroyed. The bandits agreed with the businessmen and landowners to oppose the idea of total war for a different reason: when the properties were destroyed and productivity dropped, they would not be able to loot enough supply to survive. As a result, despite the animosities between the bandits and landowners and businessmen, they were united together in the opposition to the military professional faction of the nationalists. =Communist strategies= In contrast to the nationalists, the communists had much simpler but effective strategy because communists did not have the dilemma the nationalists had, and all they had to do was to eradicate bandits. The job of fighting a counterinsurgency and counter guerrilla war was made much easier for the communists by the grave strategic miscalculations nationalists they had made themselves, and communists exploited these to the maximum for their advantage. As with all other bandit eradication campaigns, the most important communist strategy was to mobilize the entire population to fight the bandits, and furthermore, additional strategies were devised specifically to fit the local situation to fight the bandits. Order of battle Nationalists: *Fujian – Guangdong Column *Ding Riverine Protecting Group Communists: *259th Regiment (Infantry) *5th Regiment of Guangdong Xingmei Military Sub-region *Garrison Regiment of Longyan Military Sub-region *Wuping County Garrison Group (Battalion) Campaign After nationalists withdrew from Wuping, they sent many agents and military professionals to local bandits to help the latter to wage a guerrilla war against the communists. In January 1951, the communists mobilized several units totaling over three thousand to eradicate local bandits, headed by the communist 259th Infantry Regiment. Ruan Wenbing (阮文炳), the commander of the communist 259th Regiment and Li Feng (李峰), the political commissar of the communist 259th Regiment were joined by the local communist party secretary Chen Zhongping (陈仲平) of Wuping County to form the headquarters of this bandit suppression campaign. The communists divided Wuping County into four regions, each assigned to a particular military unit: *Communist 259th Regiment is responsible for the northern region *Communist 5th Regiment of Guangdong Xingmei Military Sub-region was responsible for the southern region *Communist Wuping County Garrison Group was responsible for the western region *Communist Garrison Regiment of Longyan Military Sub-region was responsible for the eastern region. In addition to deploying the military and police, the general populace was also mobilized in the campaign, with great success. Military formations were primarily fighting on the platoon scale, and supported by local populace. In February 1950, after six days and six nights of combing through the mountains by the communist force, over ninety bandits were annihilated. Meanwhile, political pressure also produced results. The nationalist Ding Riverine Protecting Group in the eastern region and bandits in the northern region totaling over a hundred surrendered to the communists without a fight. In October 1950, in the region of Fresh Water Pond (Xianshuitang, 鲜水塘) of Shifang (十方) Hamlet, the highest ranking nationalist commander, Jiang Deping (蒋德平), the commander-in-chief of Fujian – Guangdong Column and his deputy, Lin Zha (林叱) were captured with three of their staff members. By late October 1950, in the border region of Wuping County and Shanghang County, communist forces succeeded in completely annihilating bandits headed by Lin Hanqiang (林汉强) totaling over a hundred, after combing through their hiding place in Huangqing (皇庆山) Mountain continuously for four nights and three days. By 1951, bandits headed by Lan Qiguan (蓝启观) totaling over four hundred fifty were annihilated, including over four hundred being captured alive, and an additional eight hundred defected to the communist side. With the organized bands of bandits eradicated, the communist main force withdrew from the region by the end of the year, and beginning in 1952, the campaign turned to mopping up operations carried out by militias and police. In the summer of 1952, bandit chieftain Zhong Guoxun (钟国勋) and his allies captured alive, and in the spring of 1953, bandit chieftain Zhong Yong (钟勇) and his allies were also captured. By June 1955, all bandits in the local area were annihilated and the campaign concluded with communist victory. A total of 3,143 bandits were annihilated, including 533 killed, 998 captured, and 1,592 defected to the communist side. Additionally, the communist victory also included capturing 18 machine guns, 11 sub-machine guns, 490 handguns and 3734 rifles, 20 artillery pieces, and two radio sets. Outcome Although sharing the common anticommunist goal, the nationalist guerrilla and insurgency warfare was largely handicapped by the enlistment of bandits, many of whom had fought and killed nationalist troops earlier in the eradication / pacification campaign, and also looted, kidnapped and even killed landlords and business owners, an important faction that supported the nationalist government, but now must united against the common enemy, which is half-hearted at the best. Compounding the problem further with additional differences within the ranks of the nationalist guerrillas themselves, the futile nationalist guerrilla and insurgency warfare against its communist enemy was destined to fail.

Military professionals preferred to fight a total war, incapacitate the enemy's ability to fight, but this inevitably conflicted with the interest of another faction of strong supporters of the nationalist government: the landowners and businessmen, who joined bandits to oppose such tactic. The reason was that landowners and businessmen supporting and joining the nationalist guerrilla firmly believed that the nationalists would be able to retake mainland China within several years and they would be able to regain their lost lands, businesses, and other properties that were confiscated and redistributed to the poor by the communists. As the nationalist military professionals in the guerrilla suggested and destroyed the production facilities and businesses as part of the total war, the landowners and businessmen would not be able to regain any valuable properties after the return of the nationalist government because those properties had been destroyed. The bandits agreed with the businessmen and landowners to oppose the idea of total war for a different reason: when the properties were destroyed and productivity dropped, they would not be able to loot enough supply to survive. As a result, despite the animosities between the bandits and landowners and businessmen, they were united together in the opposition to the military professional faction of the nationalists. =Communist strategies= In contrast to the nationalists, the communists had much simpler but effective strategy because they did not have the dilemma the nationalists had, all they had to do was to eradicate bandits. The job of fighting a counterinsurgency and counter guerrilla war was made much easier for the communists by the grave strategic miscalculations nationalists had made themselves, and the communists exploited these to the maximum for their advantage. As with all other bandit eradication campaigns, the most important communist strategy was to mobilize the entire population to fight the bandits, and furthermore, additional strategies were devised specifically to fit the local situation to fight the bandits. Order of battle Nationalists *Anti- communist National Salvation Army Communists *132nd Division 1st Stage As the nationalists withdrew from Guangzhou to escape the advancing communists, the nationalist military intelligence head Mao Renfeng (毛人凤) ordered Li Jilan (李及兰), the nationalist commander-in-chief of Guangzhou Garrison to organize local bandits to fight a guerrilla war against the communists, causing as much damage as possible to the enemy. This was achieved via providing bandits with weaponry and money in silver, and sending agents to each band of bandits as advisors. The local bandits were united under the command of Anti-communist National Salvation Army. In response, the communists launched a campaign to suppress these local bandits, an effort headed by the communist 132nd Division. The Fifth Hamlet (Wucun, 五村) of the Triple Mountain (Sanshan, 三山) Township of Yingde was the home base of bandits headed by Ou Yang (欧阳), who established his reign ruthlessly by executing those who are suspected of being sympathetic of communists. Additionally, the hamlet chief was punished as well, fined heavily in terms of rice that totaled 1,200 kg. However, such brutal acts only alienated him and his fellow bandits from the local population, with many of them fleeing their homes to escape the bandits. Despite the initial fear and reluctance to talk to the communists when the communist 2nd Company of the 394th Regiment of the 132nd Division first entered the hamlet in September 1950, the local populace was soon won over by the communists, nine of villagers joined the communist forces, while those who fled their homes also returned, after hearing the good words about communists from those who stayed behind and met the communists. On November 19, 1950, communist forces set up an ambush in the area where Ou Yang was known to be, the foothills of the Changbeng (长崩) Mountain based on the intelligence provided by the local populace. Around 8:00 pm, Ou Yang and his bodyguard approached the communists in hiding, but discovered the ambush and opened up on the communists first. The communists returned fire and managed to kill Ou Yang's bodyguard, and wounded his leg. The next, following the blood trial, communists captured Ou Yang in a cave. With their chieftain captured alive, the surviving bandits in Ou Yang's band dispersed and went into hiding in the mountains. In the border region of Yingde and Yangshan (阳山), there was another band of bandits headed by a father – son team. During the bandit suppression campaign, the father, Huang Yuan (黄元), was first captured by the communists. Huang Yang (黄阳), the son, refused to surrender and in his desperate attempt to escape, he ordered his bandits to kidnap more than a dozen innocent young children as a human shield. As they had made their successful escape, the young children obviously could not keep up with bandits. Feeling the children were slowing them down, Huang Yang ordered all of them to be executed. The atrocities committed by Huang Yang had completed alienated the local populace and drove his very last sympathizers to the communist side, who provided intelligence to the communists on the bandits whereabouts from then on. On December 17, 1950, based on the intelligence provided by the local populations, communist 394th Regiment begun their search in the Yali (鸦理) Mountains in the region to the west of the Liumei (流眉) region. After one and half a day of search, the hiding place of Huang Yang was discovered and in the gunfight that followed, Huang Yang managed to wound three communists but all of his bandits were killed, and Huang Yang himself severely wounded. As communists approached, Huang Yang fired a last shot, wounding two communists with on bullet, before he was killed by the returning fire from the communists. This marked the end of large scale battles in the campaign, and the following operation became eradication operations on much smaller scale. 2nd Stage With bandits dispersed and went into hiding, the communists changed their tactics accordingly in the following mopping up operations. Political pressure increased with the mobilization of local population, with a team of three to five members stationed in every hamlet. In addition, ordinary bandits were treated differently than their chieftains in an attempt to convince them to give themselves up, and the practice proved to be effective, especially in the area that had been plagued by bandits previously, such as in the Yellow Flower (Huanghua, 黄花) township of Yingde. Wang Min (王敏), the deputy political commissar of the communist 2nd Company led his team to station in the Weishan (唯山) hamlet of the Yellow Flower (Huanghua, 黄花) township of Yingde. One night, the local populace reported that a bandit had returned to the hamlet and the communists managed to capture him. Based on the interrogation, another bandit returning to the hamlet was also captured on the next day. The bandits were soon convinced to switch to the communist side, leading a communist platoon to the hiding place of their former chieftain, Liu Yu (刘裕), the nationalist regimental commander of 2nd Regiment of the Northern River Column of the Anti-communist National Salvation Army. Liu Yu managed to narrow escape his capture, but both of his concubines were captured alive by the communists. Because Liu Yu's two concubines did not commit any crimes, they were soon released, and to help them settle down for a new life, food and vegetables were provided to them at no cost. The concubines were very grateful and volunteered to write to Liu Yu to ask him to give himself up, which he did. After turning himself in, it was discovered Liu Yu only joined the nationalist guerrilla but he and his bandits did not commit any serious crime against the general population like Huang Yang, so Liu Yu was soon released also. To help him to settle down to a new life, food and agricultural production tools were provide to him and his family free of charge. This policy had since become a wide practice in the local region, succeeding in convincing more than 230 bandits to surrender to the communist 395th Regiment stationed in the area, and only 8 bandits were killed for refusing to surrender. The success at the Yellow Flower township was adopted by the others in the entire northern Guangdong, and with emphasis on the relatives of those bandits. The result was that not only low-ranking bandits, but also their chieftains begun to turn themselves in, including Ou Yang's relatives, such as Ou Yakang (欧亚康), Ou Shenmei (欧沈妹), Ou Yazhang (欧亚章) and 28 other bandit chieftains. As the general population turned to the communists and many of their comrades-in-arms turned themselves in, the surviving bandits found it increasingly difficult to operate and recruit. The commander-in-chief of the bandits turned nationalist guerrilla, Liang Mengxiong (梁猛熊), was reduced to recruit and resupply by death threats, executing those who dared to say no. However, executing civilians who refused to corporate only further drive the general population away, into the communist sides. As a result, the bandits were reduced to a mere dozen, all of them were eventually captured in caves, and Liang Mengxiong was barely able to escape with his own life, becoming the only one who had successfully managed to escape. Fearing that he would be prosecuted for his rapid failure by the nationalist government, Liang Mengxiong dared not to flee to Taiwan, but instead, fled overseas. Ironically, many of Liang Mengxiong's relatives, including his distant nephew Liang Daping (梁达平) and niece Liang Shaomei (梁少梅) joined the communists during the campaign, and eventually became important officers in the People's Liberation Army local garrison. After four months of operations, by the end of January 1951, the local bandits were completely eradicated and the communist 132nd Division was reassigned to a different task of supporting land reforms in Zengcheng, Dongguan and Boluo (博罗). Outcome Although sharing the common anticommunist goal, the nationalist guerrilla and insurgency warfare was largely handicapped by the enlistment of bandits, many of whom had fought and killed nationalist troops earlier in the eradication / pacification campaign, and also looted, kidnapped and even killed landlords and business owners, an important faction that supported the nationalist government, but now must united against the common enemy, which is half-hearted at the best. Compounding the problem further with additional differences within the ranks of the nationalist guerillas themselves, the futile nationalist guerrilla and insurgency warfare against its communist enemy was destined to fail.

The campaign was part of the Campaign to Suppress Bandits in Northwestern China, and resulted in communist victory. Strategies The nationalists had faced a precarious dilemma in waging the campaign against its communist enemy because of complex situation they had faced, and consequently, made several grave miscalculations which contributed to their eventual failure. =Nationalist miscalculations= Like other nationalist futile attempts to fight guerrilla and insurgency warfare against the communists after being driven off from mainland China, the very first grave strategic miscalculation made by the retreating nationalist government contributed at least equally if not greater than the enemy's political and military pressure to the nationalist defeat in this campaign. The very first strategic miscalculation made by the retreating nationalist government was identical to the earlier one the nationalist government had made immediately after World War II, when it had neither the sufficient troops nor enough transportation assets to be deployed into the Japanese-occupied regions of China, and unwilling to let these regions falling into communist hands, the nationalist government ordered the Japanese and their turncoat Chinese puppet government not to surrender to the communists and allowed them to keep their fighting capabilities to \\"maintain order\\" in the Japanese occupied regions by fighting off the communists. This earlier miscalculation resulted in further alienation and resentment to the nationalist government by the local population, which had already blamed the nationalists for losing the regions to the Japanese invaders during the war. Half a decade later when the nationalists were driven from mainland China, they had made the similar miscalculation once again in their desperation, this time by enlisting the help of local bandits to fight the communists, and ordering the nationalist troops left behind to join these bandits in the struggle against the communism. However, the bandits were deeply feared and hated by the local populace they plagued for so long, and nationalist troops left behind joining the bandits certainly did not help them win the support of the general population. In fact, it served the exact opposite, strengthening the popular support of their communist enemy. The second grave strategic miscalculation made by the retreating nationalist government was also similar to the one the nationalist government had made immediately after World War II, when it attempted to simultaneously solve the warlord problem that had plagued China for so long with the problem of the exterminating communists together: those warlords allied with Chiang Kai-shek's nationalist government were only interested in keeping their own power and defected to the Japanese side when Japanese invaders offered to let them keep their power in exchange for their collaborations. After World War II, these forces of former Japanese puppet governments once again returned to the nationalist camp for the same reason they defected to the Japanese invaders. Obviously, it was difficult for Chiang to immediately get rid of these warlords for good as soon as they surrendered to Chiang and rejoined nationalists, because such move would alienate other factions within the nationalist ranks, and those former Japanese puppet government's warlords could still help the nationalists to by holding on to what was under their control and fighting off communists, and they and the communists would both be weakened. Similarly, the bandits the nationalist governments had failed to exterminate were obviously not good candidates for evacuation to Taiwan half a decade later, and using them to fight communists appeared to be the only logical alternative. If the communists were great weakened by the bandits, then it would the nationalists would have easier time in their counterattacks to retake China. If the bandits were defeated, then the nationalists would have easier job to eradicate them later after retaking China. However, just like those warlords, these bandits were only interested in keeping their own power also, and thus did not put any real efforts to fight the communists like some of the nationalists who were dedicated to their political cause. The eradication of bandits by the communist government only strengthened its popular support since previous governments (including the nationalist government itself) dating back from Qing Dynasty had failed to do so. The third grave strategic miscalculation made by the retreating nationalist government was similar to the second one, but this one was about its own troops left behind. The nationalist government had faced a dilemma: the highly disciplined troops were in desperate need to defend Taiwan, the last nationalist island sanctuary. The less disciplined second rate and undisciplined third rate troops, both of which mostly consisted of warlords' troop were definitely not suited to be withdrawn to defend the last stand nationalists had made, and they were not given the top priority for evacuation. Instead, they were left behind to fight the communists behind the enemy line, but such move had alienated many of the troops left behind, and it was impossible to expect them to fight their communist enemy with the same kind of dedication like those nationalist agents who believed in their political cause. Compounding the problem, due to the need of bandits' knowledge of local area, they were often rewarded with higher ranks than the nationalist troops left behind. As a result, the former-nationalist regular troops turned guerrilla fighters lacked any willingness to work together with the bandits they once attempted to exterminate, especially when many of the bandits had killed their comrades-in-arms earlier in the battles of eradications / pacifications. Many loyal nationalists were enraged by the fact that they had to serve under the former-enemy they once fought. Similarly, the bandits lacked the similar willingness and attempted to expend those nationalist troops whenever they could in order to save their own skin. The fourth grave strategic miscalculation made by the retreating nationalist government was financial / economical: due to the lack of money, those bandits turned guerrillas were mostly provided with arms, but not sufficient supplies and money. The bandits turned guerrilla had no problem of looting the local population to get what they need, as they had done for decades, which inevitably drove the general popular support further into the communist side. The little financial support provided by the nationalist government was simply not enough to support such guerrilla and insurgency warfare on such a large scale. Another unexpected but disastrous result of the insufficient financial support was that it had greatly eroded the support of the nationalist government within its own ranks. The wealthy landowners and businessmen were the strong supporters of nationalist government and as their properties were confiscated by the communists and redistributed to the poor, their hatred toward the communist government was enough to cause many of them to stay behind voluntarily to fight behind the enemy line. However, the landowners and businessmen were also longtime victims of bandits due to their wealth, and many of them had suffered even more than the general populace who had far less wealth. As these former landowners and businessmen turned guerrilla fighters were ordered to join their former bandits who once threatened, looted, kidnapped and even killed them and their relatives, it was obvious that such cooperation was mostly in name only and could not produce any actual benefits, and the alienation and discontent toward the nationalist government harbored by these once ardent nationalists would only grow greater. Another problem for the nationalists was the strong disagreement among themselves over how to fight the war against their communist enemy. Military professionals preferred to fight a total war, incapacitate the enemy's ability to fight, but this inevitably conflicted with the interest of another faction of strong supporters of the nationalist government: the landowners and businessmen, who joined bandits to oppose such tactic. The reason was that landowners and businessmen supporting and joining the nationalist guerrilla firmly believed that the nationalists would be able to retake mainland China within several years and they would be able to regain their lost lands, businesses, and other properties that were confiscated and redistributed to the poor by the communists. As the nationalist military professionals in the guerrilla suggested and destroyed the production facilities and businesses as part of the total war, the landowners and businessmen would not be able to regain any valuable properties after the return of the nationalist government because those properties had been destroyed. The bandits agreed with the businessmen and landowners to oppose the idea of total war for a different reason: when the properties were destroyed and productivity dropped, they would not be able to loot enough supply to survive. As a result, despite the animosities between the bandits and landowners and businessmen, they were united together in the opposition to the military professional faction of the nationalists. =Communist strategies= In contrast to the nationalists, communists had a much simpler but effective strategy because the communists did not have the dilemma the nationalists had, all they had to do was to eradicate bandits. The job of fighting a counterinsurgency and counter guerrilla war was made much easier for the communists by the grave strategic miscalculations nationalists had made themselves, and the communists exploited these to their maximum advantage. As with all other bandit eradication campaigns fought at the time, the most important communist strategy was to mobilize the entire population to fight the bandits, and furthermore, additional strategies were devised specifically to fit the local situation to fight the bandits. Order of battle Nationalists *Sichuan – Xikang People's Anti-communist National Salvation Army 1st Column Communists *87th Regiment *2 Battalions of Chengdu Garrison Regiment *2 Battalions of Western Sichuan Military Sub-region * Longquanyi District (garrison) Squadron Initial stage As nationalist government withdrew from western Sichuan to escape advancing communists, it ordered its forces left behind to join the local bandits to wage a guerrilla war against the communist enemy. Additional nationalist agents and military professionals were sent to join bandits as military advisors. To fight their common communist enemy, local bandits, and bodyguards of landlords and opium drug lords set aside their long term hostilities toward each other and managed to form an unlikely alliance united under the fleeing nationalist government, organized as Sichuan – Xikang People's Anti-communist National Salvation Army 1st Column, commanded by bandit chieftain Ma Li (马力). The second most powerful force of the local nationalist support came from landlord Liu Hui'an (刘惠安), whose personal army totaled over five hundred. With other bandits in regions of Jianyang, Sichuan and Huayang (华阳), the nationalist guerrilla totaled over ten thousands, and agreed to carry out the large scale attack on the enemy planned by the nationalist government, codenamed as March 3 Riot, after the planned lunar calendar date of March 3, 1950 (Gregorian calendar date of April 19, 1950). However, the anti-communist alliance was fragile to begin with and due to the traditional longtime hatred toward each other, the alliance members were deeply suspicious and distrustful to each other despite reaching a truce for the sake of against the common communist enemy, and this had gravely hindered their operations. As a result, most battles were small skirmishes carried out independently by individual bands of bandits, and personal armies of landlords and drug lords. Before the planned major attack, small attacks on the communists were already carried out, targeting the communist grain gathering teams. On April 2, 1950, a communist grain gathering team headed by Zhu Xiangli (朱向离) was ambushed and wiped out completely. On April 14, 1950, a nine-member communist grain gathering squad led by commissar Zhang Xiang (张翔) was captured by bandits headed by Liu Daichang (刘代长) and Liu Daifu (刘代富) at Wanxing (万兴) Township tea plantation, and subsequently executed at the region of Xiachangkou (下场口) of Wanxing township. The next day, another communist grain gathering squad led by Gu Shusen (顾树森) was ambushed and captured in Jigong (鸡公) Mountain, and all nine members were subsequently executed. Meanwhile, local drug lords also begun their fight against communists when the biggest local drug lord Liu Chaozhang (刘朝章) was arrested by the communists. As communist forces were destroying Liu Chaozhang's opium plantation totaled several dozen acres, they were constantly harassed by drug dealers' sniper fire in the process during their drug eradication effort that lasted more than two weeks. Attacks like these prompted the communists to formally launch a campaign to eradicate bandits in the local area. Although the communists strength was in absolute disadvantage, they were helped greatly by the lack of corporation among bandits themselves. Battle of Hungtuchang On April 14, 1950, over a thousand bandits from Ma Li (马力)'s band gathered in the region of Yellow Earth Field (Huangtuchang, 黄土场), and prepared to attack communists. As communists learned the news, they immediately decided to launch a preemptive strike against the nationalist guerrilla despite absolute numerical inferiority. The 5th Company of the communist 87th Regiment was ordered to proceed to Yellow Earth Field to attack the main body of the bandit force, and the Longquanyi District (garrison) Squadron was ordered to attack nearby Stone Plate Beach (Shibantan, 石板滩) to help. The battle lasted continuously for two night and two days, and the nationalists were completely surprised by the sudden preemptive strike by their enemy. The bandits, landlords, and drug lords only wanted to keep their own strength and did not want to sacrifice their own force for the others, and everybody expected others to fight the communist enemy instead. As a result, different bands of bandits begun to flee from the battlefield almost as soon as the battle begun, and others soon followed. The flight of bandits from the battlefield begun more rampant when another news reached the battlefield: of thousands bandits active in the region, only a hundred or so came to help fight the communist enemy, while all of the rest did not do anything. Only bandits under the command of chieftain Zhang Hua (张华) and the nationalist agent Wang Zhongxian (王忠贤) put up some real resistance, but they efforts were futile and they were nearly completely annihilated. As the main force of bandits were defeated and dispersed, every member of the 100 plus strong bandit reinforcement was also captured alive by the communists. The communist casualties were surprising low, with only one fatality, the 2nd platoon commander Jiao Lianyu (焦连玉) was killed in action, while other five soldiers were injured. Battle of Luodai Although most other bandits in the area did not help those in the battle of the Yellow Earth Field because they did not want to risk themselves for others, they did select another target to strike. As the communist 5th Company of the communist 87th Regiment was ordered to the battle of the Yellow Earth Field from Luodai (洛带), the area it was originally stationed, the only communist presence left behind was a single squad and civilian administrators. Many bandits believed that this was a great opportunity to attack Luodai due to the weakened defense and they would be successful capturing a lot of supplies. By April 15, 1950, around five thousand bandits besieged the communist military base / administrative headquarters at Luodai and launched their attack. The communist defenders proved to be much tougher than expected and even the communist civilian administrators taking up arms fought better than most bandits. After continuous attacks were beaten back, bandits changed their strategy by attempting to besiege the communist base for longtime, because they were confident that the numerically superior bandit force at the battle of Yellow Earth Field would succeeded in wiping out the numerically inferior communist enemy, and the communist defenders of the base would have no choice but to surrender. Additionally, different bands of bandits were unwilling to sacrifice themselves for others to attack the base again, because if they were killed, they would not be able to share the spoils while others could. However, by April 17, 1950, the shocking news of the numerically superior bandit force at the battle of the Yellow Earth Field reached Luodai, and bandits were completely dumbfounded that their numerically superior force was completely annihilated. More bad news followed as the bandits learned that the communist forces at the battle of the Yellow Earth Field consisting of the 5th Company of the 87th Regiment and Longquanyi District (garrison) Squadron were on their way back to help their comrades. By 9:00 PM on April 17, 1950, they had reached Luodai. Communists were helped by their reinforcements consisting of two battalions of Western Sichuan Military Sub-region. After a fierce battle that continuously lasted a day and a night, bandits was completely annihilated and dispersed, and went into hiding as they fled the battlefield. Following their victory, the communists begun their mopping up operation by combing every single hamlet, and forced bandits to flee from the Luodai to Longquanyi District (referred simply as Longquan by the local populace). Battle of Longquan While the battle of Luodai was raging on, several thousand bandits attacked Longquanyi District from two different direction, with one thrust from Baihe (柏合) Township, and another from Ping'an (平安) Township. The local communist garrison only totaled seventy, but there was an armory where mortars stored. Fifteen minutes after the bandits launched their attack, they were bombarded by mortar fires, which successfully checked the bandits' advance. The next day, communist reinforcements consisting of two Battalions of Chengdu Garrison Regiments arrived. Despite absolute numerical inferiority, the communists decided to launch a counterattack on the bandits, correctly deducting that despite enjoying absolute numerical superiority, the bandits would not fight as a cohesive unit because none of them would want to fight and die for others. Just as it had occurred in the earlier two battles, the bandits behaved exactly as the communists had predicted and despite having five thousands members, the bandits' offensive completely collapsed and every bandit started to immediately flee from the battlefield after suffering only four dozen fatalities, when attacked from both sides. As the communists begun their mopping up operation at the same night at Baihe Township, all of the seventeen bandits who failed to flee from the area were captured alive by the communists. The communist victory of the battle of Longquan marked the end of the organized battles in the local area. Although the mopping up operation would last until end of the year, with another dozen smaller battles to be fought, all of the surviving bandits in the local area were completely eradicated by the end of the year. Political offensive and pressures from the communists played an important role in their success in that many of the bandits surrendered, and most of them was reeducated, finally switched to the communist side. Outcome Although sharing the common anticommunist goal, the nationalist guerrilla and insurgency warfare was largely handicapped by the enlistment of bandits, many of whom had fought and killed nationalist troops earlier in the eradication / pacification campaign, and also looted, kidnapped and even killed landlords and business owners, an important faction that supported the nationalist government, but now must united against the common enemy, which is half-hearted at the best. Compounding the problem further with additional differences within the ranks of the nationalist guerillas themselves, the futile nationalist guerrilla and insurgency warfare against its communist enemy was destined to fail.

The band was formerly based in Prague, Czech Republic, and has since moved to Canada. It has members from Canada, the United States of America and England. Its musical style has been likened to folk rock and Gypsy punk. History The Tower of Dudes was formed in 2007 by a group of expatriates living in Prague, Czech Republic. Prague has a large community of English-speaking expatriates, estimated at 30,000 in 1993.\\"Y(oung) A(mericans in) P(rague)\\", The New York Times, 12 December 1993, 671. Like many of these expatriates, members of The Tower of Dudes cite various reasons for leaving their home country for the Czech Republic. In answer to an interview question from Spin TV, the English bass guitar player Steve Cautious said, \\"It's a small pretty city [that is] much easier to get around in than London.\\" When asked the same question, Urine Spritzer sarcastically answered that he came for \\"the smiling faces\\". \\" The Tower of Dudes' sound has been described as \\"punky folk\\", combining \\"punk, flamenco, folk roots, western twang, and other sounds generated by gypsies and rebels from across the globe\\", and as punk-folk that \\"benefit[s from] the hard-core mandolin of Tony Parker and the pumping thrash of Tarah Masu’s accordion. Throw in some of Parker’s edgy banjo and Nick Jennings’ extended drum kit, and it’s hard keeping your feet still when the Dudes play.\\" In their extensive touring in the Czech Republic and Germany, the band has shared a stage with notable bands such as Frog Eyes, Immaculate Machine, O'Death, Mammasweed, Plastic People of the Universe and The Sads. The Tower of Dudes have been based in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada since the beginning of 2011. During the latter half of 2013, they worked on their third full-length album, Make Your Own Culture. The album was released on March 1, 2014, and the band held a record-release party on March 14 in Victoria.

She first received public acclaim in 1950 for her painting Tribute to the American Working People, a five-image polyptych conceived in the form of a Renaissance altarpiece, except that its central figure is a factory worker and not a saint. Flanking this central figure are smaller scenes of ordinary people—at a picnic, in a parlor, on a farm and in the schoolroom. Meticulously painted in oil on composition board in a style and color palette reminiscent of the Flemish Masters, the finished work is more than six feet long and three feet high and took her five years to complete. It was the subject of a 2007 retrospective at the Smithsonian Institution and is part of the permanent collection of the Smithsonian American Art Museum. She first received public notice when her work Workers and Paintings (1943) was included in the legendary 1946 \\"Fourteen Americans\\" show at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, curated by Dorothy Canning Miller.Now in the collection of MoMA, gift of Lincoln Kirstein: http://www.moma.org/collection/object.php?object_id=78465. A second painting, and the first parts of the Tribute were shown as well. This show featured a selection of up and coming artists including Robert Motherwell, Isamu Noguchi (sculpture), and Saul Steinberg. The \\"Fourteen Americans\\" show at the Museum of Modern Art, while often thought to proclaim the arrival of abstract expressionism did not do so unambiguously since it included those like Sharrer and George Tooker who are not modernists based on the litmus test of abstraction.Clement Greenberg, Collected Essays, Vol. 2, 113, who thinks the show was badly curated because of these tensions. Sharrer and her painting Man at Fountain were featured in the March 20, 1950 issue of Life Magazine, in a cover story featuring \\"Nineteen Young American Artists.\\" Unlike many of her New York contemporaries including Motherwell, Jackson Pollock and Mark Rothko, Sharrer did not take the turn to abstract expressionism and continued to paint in a figurative and academic style, although the content of her work was often mordantly witty. The term Magic Realism applied to other American painters including Paul Cadmus and George Tooker is often used to describe her later work. Life and education Honoré Desmond Sharrer was born at West Point, N.Y. Her father, Robert Allen Sharrer, was an Army officer attached to the United States Military Academy there. Her mother, the former Madeleine Sachs, was also a painter. Sharrer was reared in the Philippines, Paris and in several American cities before graduating from The Bishop’s School (La Jolla) in La Jolla, California. At 18, she was chosen out 230,000 applicants to win a national graphic arts Youth Forum prize sponsored by The American Magazine. Subsequently, she attended Yale University School of Art and the California School of Fine Arts, now the San Francisco Art Institute. During World War II, she worked as a welder in shipyards in California and New Jersey.Perez Zagorin, \\"Oral History\\" (2002), an interview conducted Laura MacCarthy on behalf of the Smithsonian Archives of American Art.: http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/oralhistories/transcripts/zagori07.htm After an earlier marriage that ended in divorce, in 1947 Sharrer married Perez Zagorin, a prominent historian of Europe. They lived and worked in New York, Amherst, Montreal, London, Rochester, NY and Charlottesville, VA. They had one son, Adam Zagorin, born 1953. Art After a solo exhibition of her paintings in Boston in 1951, Sharrer did not have another solo show until 1969. After another eighteen years she had a 1987 solo exhibition that traveled from New York City to the Memorial Art Gallery (Rochester, NY) and the Danforth Museum (Framingham, MA). While often included in group shows in those intervening periods, and although she worked continuously and diligently on her art, she was often overlooked as \\"modern art\\" came to be seen as synonymous with abstract expressionism. So powerful was this association that MoMA had to name its show in 2000 (in which Sharrer was included) as \\"Modern Art despite Modernism,\\" as if the latter were synonymous with the former. Despite her meticulous technique, luminous color palette, and eye for telling detail reminiscent of Flemish painters, she was a modernist in sensibility and subject. A painting like Resurrection of a Waitress (1984), displays a sly humor in its choice of subject matter that hearkens back to her Tribute, but also shares with the latter a modernist's assumption that the life of a waitress or working man is as deserving of our attention as any saint. The waitress is carried heavenwards—held aloft means of an eggbeater caught in her hair—by a partially nude angel, whose method of propulsion is a whirlygig rather than wings. One of her largest paintings (9 x 6 feet) is a surreal oil on canvas, entitled “Leda and the Folks,” from 1963. It is one of Sharrer’s earlier forays into surrealism, featuring three somewhat oddly proportioned figures, two of which are based on Elvis Presley 's parents, while the third, a Renaissance-like, golden-haired nude young woman, represents Sharrer’s take on the ancient Greek myth of Leda and the Swan, in which Zeus transformed himself into a swan to get close to and seduce a beautiful woman. The painting is displayed at the Smith College Museum of Art in Northampton, Massachusetts, as part of the exhibition A Dangerous Woman: Subversion & Surrealism in the Art of Honoré Sharrer (September 29, 2017 – January 7, 2018). As their curator explains, the painting came in part from Sharrer’s interest in examining the intersection of myth and the celebrity culture that surrounded Presley and other popular entertainment figures in the early 1960s. Equally enigmatic is another of her late paintings, A Dream of Monticello (1996) in which a female nude wearing headphones reclines with one red pump on and one off. Thomas Jefferson, and presumably one of his sons with Sally Hemings are standing just behind. In the background are two triumphal obilisks flanking an almost Dali- esque clock, presumably the clock at Monticello. In the foreground is a beautifully rendered silver ewer, a known Monticello objét. This combination of careful observation, juxtaposition, fantastical elements, often nude woman portrayed in scenes with clothed men, triumphal arches are all rendered in a curiously flat, highly charged and exquisitely colored dreamscape-like settings are like glimpses of a private world, rendered for us by the artist to make of them what we will.

It was first published in 1992 and has since been included with The Siege of White Deer Park and In the Path of the Storm in the \\"Second Omnibus\\" edition (Hutchinson, 1995). Plot It is spring in White Deer Park and Dash the young hare, confident that she is quicker than every other animal in the reserve, wants to test her speed properly by running on the downland. She tells Plucky that she will find somebody to help her dig under the boundary fence and the young fox worries about her, but she soon forgets her remark and decides to remain in the reserve. However, when Plucky goes missing Dash employs the rabbits to help her get under the fence to look for him. Meanwhile, the animals discover that several other animals have gone missing from the park including Weasel. They also hear from Toad and Tawny Owl that several brown rats have entered the park and Fox tells everybody to kill any rat they see. Dash gives up her search and returns to the reserve only to discover that several humans are rounding up various animals using traps. She tells Fox and Vixen who go to investigate and when the humans leave in their van, Dash follows them out of the park gates and chases them across the downland towards a large enclosure surrounded by large walls. When Dash informs the others Fox decides to set up a rescue party to go and help their friends who have been captured. Fox also puts Badger in charge of the animals' battle against the rats, and several more rats arrive at the park and thrive, despite the animals' best efforts to combat the threat. The rescue party sets off for the second reserve and Tawny Owl flies over the wall to look for Weasel. Plucky hears his calls and fetches Weasel, but neither animal knows of any way in which they can escape so Tawny Owl is forced to leave. The animals continue their battle against the rats, who have also been discovered by the humans, so they decide to temporarily retreat and return to the park when the humans think the threat has gone. Meanwhile, Fox asks Whistler to fly to the new reserve and carry Weasel back to the park, which he soon does, but Plucky is forced to remain behind until he can find a way to escape. After biding their time in the sewers, the rats return to the park over many nights and soon grow in huge numbers, but their caution means that the true scale of their invasion does not become apparent to the other animals for some time. When the animals become aware of the rats' renewed presence in the Hollow, they launch an attack on them and drive them out of their corner of the reserve. However, several more rats gather at the pond and attack the frogs, but Toad voices his protest and the rats attack him too. The rats' leader, Bully, warns Toad that they will soon take over the whole reserve. As the white deer arrive to drink at the pond, Bully attacks Toad with his teeth and retreats. Whistler arrives at the pond and discovers the badly wounded Toad, who asks the heron to carry him to the Hollow. Whistler does so, but Toad dies soon afterwards. The animals form another hunting party and continue to attack the rats to drive them away from the Hollow, but more rats keep on coming and they appear to be fighting a losing battle. Meanwhile, Plucky comes up with a plan to escape from the other reserve. After the Warden finishes one of his checks of the reserve, Plucky jumps into the back of his Land Rover and is taken out through the gates, before jumping out and setting off for his home reserve, where he is reunited with the other animals. The rats continue to overrun the reserve despite the efforts of Adder and Sinuous to kill as many as they can. As the snakes launch an attack, Bully and several of his followers await them and grab hold of Adder as he enters the nest. Sinuous escapes and tells Plucky, who quickly goes to Adder's rescue. He arrives at the nest and negotiates Adder's freedom by promising not to dig into the rats' nest and attack them. Bully then offers Plucky a truce so that all the animals can concentrate on raising their young instead of battling, and makes a plan to attack the animals while their guard is down. Fox comes up with a plan to alert the Warden of the rats' presence in the park and the animals leave several rat carcasses outside his lodge. Meanwhile, Bully organizes a hunting party of the largest and strongest rats to dispose of Adder, and the rats find Sinuous and attack her. Sinuous strikes and kills Brat, one of Bully's lieutenants, but the other rats gnaw at her body and only release her when they are sure she is dead. The Warden finally becomes aware of the rats and searches for them on his rounds, and the animals are satisfied that he will deal with the threat. The attacks against the rats have tired Badger out and he finds it difficult to move. A young female badger named Frond, who has been driven out of her home by the rats, discovers Badger's set and asks for shelter, then collects food for him while he is unable to move. Badger enjoys being looked after and Frond stays with Badger to look after him. The Warden finally locates the rats and sets out poison for them, but they are too experienced to take the bait and it achieves nothing. Bully finally decides to launch his attack on the Farthing Wood animals and the huge colony of rats swarm into their corner of the reserve. Mossy is spotted and killed by Bully's lieutenant, Spike, before Holly notices the attack and alerts Tawny Owl. Soon the battle rages, but the Farthing Wood animals are overrun by the rats so Leveret and Dash head off to alert all the other animals in the reserve, who arrive to join the fight. With the other animals' help the rats are finally forced to retreat and Adder avenges the death of Sinuous by killing Spike. Vixen pursues Bully and crushes him with her jaws, then tosses him over the boundary fence and out of the reserve. Within hours the park is finally free of the rats and the animals can live peacefully once more. A few days later, Whistler discovers that a fence has been erected along the downland between the two reserves, then sometime after that Dash discovers that part of the boundary fence has been removed and the park continues onto the download and has been linked with the other reserve, meaning that White Deer Park has become twice as big so there is more space for all the animals to live their lives.

The types shown are (clockwise from top) cordate, ficron and ovate. Arguably a form of early art. The oldest undisputed examples of figurative art are known from Europe and from Sulawesi, Indonesia, dated about 35,000 years old (Art of the Upper Paleolithic).M. Aubert et al., \\"Pleistocene cave art from Sulawesi, Indonesia\\", Nature volume 514, pages 223–227 (09 October 2014). \\"using uranium-series dating of coralloid speleothems directly associated with 12 human hand stencils and two figurative animal depictions from seven cave sites in the Maros karsts of Sulawesi, we show that rock art traditions on this Indonesian island are at least compatible in age with the oldest European art. The earliest dated image from Maros, with a minimum age of 39.9 kyr, is now the oldest known hand stencil in the world. In addition, a painting of a babirusa ('pig-deer') made at least 35.4 kyr ago is among the earliest dated figurative depictions worldwide, if not the earliest one. Among the implications, it can now be demonstrated that humans were producing rock art by ∼40 kyr ago at opposite ends of the Pleistocene Eurasian world.\\" Together with religion and other cultural universals of contemporary human societies, the emergence of figurative art is a necessary attribute of full behavioral modernity. There are, however, some examples of non-figurative designs which somewhat predate the Upper Paleolithic, beginning about 70,000 years ago (MIS 4). These include the earliest of the Iberian cave paintings, including a hand stencil at the Cave of Maltravieso, a simple linear design, and red paint applied to speleothems, dated to at least 64,000 years ago and as such attributable to Neanderthals. \\"we present dating results for three sites in Spain that show that cave art emerged in Iberia substantially earlier than previously thought. Uranium- thorium (U-Th) dates on carbonate crusts overlying paintings provide minimum ages for a red linear motif in La Pasiega (Cantabria), a hand stencil in Maltravieso (Extremadura), and red-painted speleothems in Ardales (Andalucía). Collectively, these results show that cave art in Iberia is older than 64.8 thousand years (ka). This cave art is the earliest dated so far and predates, by at least 20 ka, the arrival of modern humans in Europe, which implies Neandertal authorship.\\" Similarly, the Blombos Cave of South Africa yielded some stones with engraved grid or cross-hatch patterns, dated to some 73,000 years ago, but they are attributed to Homo sapiens. Europe Uranium-thorium dating of painted designs in the caves of La Pasiega (Cantabria), a hand stencil in Maltravieso (Extremadura), and red-painted speleothems in Ardales (Andalusia) yielded an age of more than 64,800 years, predating the previously oldest known art by at least 20,000 years. The Mask of La Roche-Cotard has also been argued as being evidence of Neanderthal figurative art, although in a period post-dating their contact with Homo sapiens. The \\"Divje Babe flute\\" had controversially been claimed as a Neanderthal musical instrument; other archaeologists have claimed a Cro-Magnon origin of the artefact. A number of rival archaeologists maintain an alternative hypothesis that the perfectly circular, spaced, and aligned holes were bite marks of carnivores. The main argument in support of their alternative hypothesis is fundamentally circular in its reasoning: that the artefact which appears to be a flute of Neanderthal origin cannot be a flute of Neanderthal origin because Neanderthals did not have music, according to them. Southern Africa The \\"abstract drawing\\" (ochre cross-hatching) discovered in Blombos Cave in South Africa, ca. 73,000 years old. In 2002 in Blombos cave, situated in South Africa, ochre stones were discovered engraved with grid or cross-hatch patterns, dated to some 70,000 years ago. This suggested to some researchers that early Homo sapiens were capable of abstraction and production of abstract art or symbolic art. Also discovered at the Blombos cave were shell beads, also dating to c. 70,000 years ago.Watts, Ian (2009) Red ochre, body painting, and language: interpreting the Blombos ochre. In Botha, Rudolf P. & Knight, Chris (Eds.) The cradle of language. Oxford ; New York, Oxford University Press. Engraved ochre has also been reported from other Middle Stone Age sites, such as Klein Kliphuis, Wonderwerk Cave and Klasies River Cave 1.

Journal of Archaeological Science. – the earliest forms of abstract representation and conventional design tradition hitherto recorded. The interpretation of the hatching patterns as \\"symbolic\\" has been challenged, and several purely functional explanations of the objects have been proposed, e.g. as an ingredient in mastic, skin protection against sun or insects, as soft-hammers for delicate knapping, as a hide preservative or as medicine.; Wadley, Lyn, Hodgskiss, Tamaryn & Grant, Michael (2009) Implications for complex cognition from the hafting of tools with compound adhesives in the Middle Stone Age, South Africa.

Some have attempted to interpret these as a precursor to art, allegedly revealing the intent of the maker to decorate and fashion. The symmetry and attention given to the shape of a tool has led authors to controversially argue Acheulean hand axes as artistic expressions. There are several other claims of Lower Paleolithic art, namely the \\"Venus of Tan-Tan\\" (before 300 kya), pp. 145-146 and the \\"Venus of Berekhat Ram\\" (250 kya). Both of these may be natural rock formations with an incidental likeness to the human form, but some scholars have suggested that they exhibit traces of pigments or carving intended to further accentuate the human-like form.

Originally broadcast each weekday afternoon at 5pm, the programme was presented for much of its run by Michelle McManus and Stephen Jardine and broadcast from STV's Pacific Quay studios in Glasgow. The programme moved to a weekly peak time slot in June 2011, but was cancelled in October 2011. History The Hour began in May 2009 as an hour-long replacement for The Five Thirty Show, which had aired on weekdays since January 2008. Whilst its male presenter, Stephen Jardine, remained with the programme since its launch, his female co-host rotated between various personalities until October 2009, when it was announced that regular guest host Michelle McManus would become a main co-host. Despite replacing The Five Thirty Show, The Hour's focus was more lifestyle-orientated than its predecessor, which was originally intended to cover the main issues and news topics of the day. Features on The Hour included entertainment, TV, movies, cookery, health, gardening, fashion, celebrity guests and other topics. In May 2011, Stephen Jardine announced he was leaving STV to form a PR company. McManus continued presenting the programme with various guest presenters until the end of the daytime version of The Hour on Friday 22 July 2011. In June 2011, STV announced the programme would be cut from five days a week to once a week and moved to a prime time slot of Tuesdays at 8pm from 20 September 2011. McManus remained to present the relaunched programme, alongside Tam Cowan. Low ratings and criticism over the peak time version of the programme led to STV's decision to cancel the programme just four weeks after the relaunch. The last edition of the programme aired on 11 October 2011, two days before it was cancelled. =Spin- offs= The Hour spawned two spin-off programmes, usually as an extension to a segment of the main 5pm programme – The Chef's Apprentice was a special stand, looking for Scotland's best young chef. The judges were Sue Lawrence, Jeff Bland, Steven Doherty, Jean-Christophe Novelli and Steven Kitchen. The final was aired on Monday, 23 November 2009. Another segment of the show was Fashion Hijack (presented by Vicky Lee), where a team of style and beauty experts transformed the look of women across the country. A special Christmas edition was aired out-with The Hour on Wednesday, 23 December 2009. In January 2011, a short programme called New Year, New You was aired every evening at 5.55. This was shown as separate from The Hour, but it took up the last five minutes normally occupied by the programme. On Saturday 20 August 2011, a special edition, The Hour Goes to the Races, aired live from Perth Races on Royal Charities Day, presented by Michelle McManus and STV News West anchor John MacKay.

In antiquity, it lay outside the city limits, 3 km north of the Porta Collina, at the point where the Via Salaria (modern SS4) crossed the Aniene, a tributary of the Tiber. The visible side arches are assumed to originate from the first stone structure built during the 1st century BC. In the Gothic War (535–554), the main arch was largely destroyed by the Ostrogothic king Totila, but repaired by his East Roman opponent Narses in 565, who recorded the extensive restoration works, including a river diversion, in an extant bridge inscription. At that time, the Ponte Salario was 72 m long and 6.52 m wide, with its semi-circular arch reaching a remarkable clear span of 24.86 m. The current bridge The large bridge tower was possibly erected in the 8th century, allowing more effective control of the passage. In 1798, the Ponte Salario, which had been hitherto well-preserved due to repeated repairs, was battered by Napoleonic troops, who tore down the balustrade, including the ancient inscription. In 1829, the medieval tower was demolished, and in 1849 the bridge was cut on a length of 15 m by French soldiers. In 1867, the bridge once and for all lost its historical character, when papal troops blew up the central arch. The Ponte Salario was reconstructed in its current form in 1874, with the roadway widened in 1930. Apart from the Ponte Salario, there were other fortified bridges across the Aniene, such as the extant Ponte Nomentano, the Ponte Mammolo (both of Roman origin) and the medieval Ponte di San Francesco in Subiaco.Il Ponte di S.

He is the son of American drummer Max Weinberg. He has played with the American punk rock band the Reveling and toured in 2009 as a drummer with Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band, substituting for his father. During 2010, he was briefly the drummer for Madball. During 2011 and 2012, Weinberg played with Against Me!. In 2014, Weinberg replaced Joey Jordison as the drummer for Slipknot. Early life and education Weinberg is the son of drummer Max Weinberg, who joined the E Street Band in 1975; his mother, Rebecca \\"Becky\\" (Schick), was a former teacher. He grew up in Middletown Township, New Jersey. His mother was a Methodist and his father Jewish. His sister is Ali Weinberg Rogin (married to Josh Rogin).Washington Life: \\"Society Weddings: Ali Weinberg and Josh Rogin\\" by John Arundel April 18, 2016 As a child, he played travel team ice hockey as a goaltender. At age 9 he first saw the E Street Band on their 1999–2000 Reunion Tour, and saw shows on this and subsequent tours, especially in Europe. Around the same time his father took him to Ozzfest to see Slipknot, which gave him a strong affinity for heavy metal and other intense music genres; his father also exposed him to a wide variety of other music. He began playing guitar at age 9, bass at age 12 or 13. He then started playing drums at age 14, getting only few lessons from his father without much instruction and being mostly self-taught, using his father's old gear. By the next year he had performed a guest appearance on stage with band The Used and subsequently with punk rockers the Bouncing Souls. He played in the New Jersey metal band Chaosis. He attended Rumson-Fair Haven Regional High School where he played on the hockey team for a time, played in a band called Sadie Mae, and graduated in 2008. Weinberg graduated from Stevens Institute of Technology in New Jersey in 2014. He joined the New York punk band the Reveling in August 2008, which plays before small audiences in venues such as the Ace of Clubs nightspot in Manhattan, various spots in Brooklyn, and elsewhere. With them he does some of the band's songwriting and arranging. Appearances with Springsteen Max Weinberg (standing in front of stage, in black shirt) watches son Jay on the video screen, during \\"Born to Run\\" at Giants Stadium in 2008 Jay Weinberg's first appearance with Springsteen was in the summer of 2008, filling in for his father on \\"Born to Run\\" at Giants Stadium after having watched many other performances during the Magic Tour. Springsteen's 2009 Working on a Dream Tour posed a problem for Max Weinberg, as The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien in Los Angeles – for which he was the Max Weinberg 7 bandleader – was starting at the same time that the tour would be in progress. Springsteen's manager Jon Landau viewed Weinberg as the \\"secret weapon\\" to substitute for his father without losing fan satisfaction. Both Landau and E Street guitarist Steve Van Zandt attributed Jay Weinberg's skills to a genetic gift. Once the initial portion of the tour began in early April 2009, Weinberg played from several songs to half the show on most of the dates. He received a very positive reaction from both audiences and reviewers as a re-energizing \\"spark plug\\" for the much-older band, with his vigorous, long-hair-flying style inviting comparisons to Dave Grohl and his potential for replacing his father drawing allusions to Wally Pipp. He began playing complete shows in mid-May 2009 during the tour's American first leg, as his father went to California to prepare test runs for The Tonight Show start. Modern Drummer magazine's editor said that a college freshman playing on one of the year's biggest rock tours is \\"certainly a unique story\\". Weinberg played a number of dates early on in the European second leg of the tour, including at the Dutch Pinkpop festival in Landgraaf, the Netherlands in addition to Bonnaroo in Manchester, Tennessee. He also played during a few dates of the American third and final leg. When not needed for the Springsteen tour, he continued to play for the Reveling, often before audiences that were three orders of magnitude smaller; he said of the difference, \\"I liked the duality of it all ... I like doing this just as much as I like doing that.\\" Madball In February 2010, Weinberg began playing with Madball, a legendary hardcore band based out of New York City. In June of that year, it was announced that he would become the drummer for their upcoming album Empire and a tour. However, in September 2010 the group discharged him, with Madball vocalist Freddy Cricien saying, \\"I'm letting Jay go [mid-tour] in Canada because I just feel he doesn't represent this band well on a character level.\\" In response, Weinberg said that he had already quit the group by that time, and that \\"while I really enjoyed playing the music, I do not subscribe to their choice of habits and lifestyle. This past August while on tour in Europe, disturbing events within the band indicated to me that it was time for me to move on.\\" In any case, Weinberg said both he and the group should be proud of Empire. Against Me! In November 2010, it was announced that Weinberg would be playing drums with punk rock band Against Me! for their upcoming 2011 shows, covering for regular drummer George Rebelo while he tours with his other band, Hot Water Music. As 2011 unfolded, the arrangement looked to possibly be more permanent. Weinberg also sat in a bit with the band Fences during 2011. In late 2011, Against Me! began recording their first album with Weinberg on drums. However, in December 2012, Weinberg announced via Twitter, without notifying the other members beforehand, that he was leaving Against Me!. Using Twitter, he wished the band well, but the other members in return tweeted a picture of a drum machine. Slipknot Weinberg performing with Slipknot in 2016. In 2014, Weinberg became the drummer for Slipknot following the departure of Joey Jordison in late 2013. Although the drummer's identity had not been officially revealed by the band itself, preferring to keep the identity of the new members (a new bassist, confirmed to be Alessandro Venturella, had also joined the band) a secret as they were not official members at that time; a former drum technician for the band leaked their itinerary, revealing that the drummer is Weinberg. Venturella was also named on the itinerary, though fans had identified him earlier via his distinctive hand tattoos. Weinberg was eventually officially revealed to be the drummer by Jim Root in an interview with Ultimate-Guitar on May 13, 2015.https://www.ultimate- guitar.com/news/interviews/jim_root_seems_like_stone_sour_cant_even_write_a_new_record_they_lost_a_good_writer.html \\"So VMan and Jay both came to my house and we started rehearsing a couple weeks early before we went on the tour.

Rossby D. Dorson J. Fontaine, Journal of atmospheric and oceanic technology, v.3 p.672–680 are submersible devices used to map ocean currents well below the surface. They drift with these deep currents and listen for acoustic \\"pongs\\" emitted at designated times from multiple moored sound sources. By analyzing the time required for each pong to reach a float, researchers can pinpoint its position by triangulation. The floats are able to detect the pongs at ranges of hundreds of kilometers because they generally target a range of depths known as the SOFAR (SOund Fixing And Ranging) channel, which acts as a waveguide for sound. The name \\"RAFOS\\" derives from the earlier SOFAR floats,, The evolution of the Swallow float to today's RAFOS float which emitted sounds that moored receivers picked up, allowing real-time underwater tracking. When the transmit and receive roles were reversed, so was the name: RAFOS is SOFAR spelled backward. Listening for sound requires far less energy than transmitting it, so RAFOS floats are cheaper and longer lasting than their predecessors, but they do not provide information in real-time: instead they store it on board, and upon completing their mission, drop a weight, rise to the surface, and transmit the data to shore by satellite. IntroductionOf the importance of measuring ocean currents= The underwater world is still mostly unknown. The main reason for it is the difficulty to gather information in situ, to experiment, and even to reach certain places. But the ocean nonetheless is of a crucial importance for scientists, as it covers about 71% of the planet. Knowledge of ocean currents is of crucial importance. In important scientific aspects, as the study of global warming, ocean currents are found to greatly affect the Earth's climate since they are the main heat transfer mechanism. They are the reason for heat flux between hot and cold regions, and in a larger sense drive almost every understood circulation. These currents also affect marine debris, and vice versa. In an economical aspect, a better understanding can help reducing costs of shipping, since the currents would help boats reduce fuel costs. In the sail-ship era knowledge was even more essential. Even today, the round-the-world sailing competitors employ surface currents to their benefit. Ocean currents are also very important in the dispersal of many life forms. An example is the life-cycle of the European Eel. Sound wave propagation in the SOFAR channel and speed of sound in function of depth =The SOFAR channel= The SOFAR channel (short for Sound Fixing and Ranging channel), or deep sound channel (DSC), is a horizontal layer of water in the ocean at which depth the speed of sound is minimal, in average around 1200 m deep. It acts as a wave- guide for sound, and low frequency sound waves within the channel may travel thousands of miles before dissipating. The SOFAR channel is centred on the depth where the cumulative effect of temperature and water pressure (and, to a smaller extent, salinity) combine to create the region of minimum sound speed in the water column. Near the surface, the rapidly falling temperature causes a decrease in sound speed, or a negative sound speed gradient. With increasing depth, the increasing pressure causes an increase in sound speed, or a positive sound speed gradient. The depth where the sound speed is at a minimum is the sound channel axis. This is a characteristic that can be found in optical guides. If a sound wave propagates away from this horizontal channel, the part of the wave furthest from the channel axis travels faster, so the wave turns back toward the channel axis. As a result, the sound waves trace a path that oscillates across the SOFAR channel axis. This principle is similar to long distance transmission of light in an optical fiber. In this channel, a sound has a range of over 2000 km. RAFOS float Sound wave correlation =Global idea= To use a RAFOS float, one has to submerge it in the specified location, so that it will get carried by the current. Then, every so often (usually every 6 or 8 hours) an 80-second sound signal is sent from moored emitters. Using the fact that a signal transmitted in the ocean preserves its phase structure (or pattern) for several minutes, it has been thought to use signals in which the frequency increases linearly of 1.523 Hz from start to end centered around 250 Hz. The sound source project Then receivers would listen for specific phase structures, by comparing the incoming data with a reference 80-second signal. This permits to get rid of any noise appearing during the travel of the wave by floating particles or fish. The detection scheme can be simplified by keeping only the information of positive or negative signal, allowing to work with a single bit of new information at each time step. This method works very well, and allows the use of small micro-processors, enabling the float itself to do the listening and computing, and a moored sound source. From the arrival time of the signals from two or more sound sources, and the previous location of the float, its current location can easily be determined to considerable (<1 km) accuracy. For instance, the float will listen for three sources and store the time of arrival for the two largest signals heard from each source. The location of the float will be computed onshore. =Technical characteristics= The interior of a basic RAFOS float  Mechanical characteristics  The floats consist of 8 cm by 1.5 to 2.2 m long glass pipe that contain a hydrophone, signal processing circuits, a microprocessor, a clock and a battery. A float weighs about 10 kg. The lower end is sealed with a flat aluminium endplate where all electrical and mechanical penetrators are located. The glass thickness is about 5 mm, giving the float a theoretical maximum depth of about 2700 m. The external ballast is suspended by a short piece of wire chosen for its resistance to saltwater corrosion. By dissolving it electrolytically the 1 kg ballast is released and the float returns to the surface.  Electrical characteristics  The electronics can be divided into four categories: a satellite transmitter used after surfacing, the set of sensors, a time reference clock, and a microprocessor. The clock is essential in locating the float, since it is used as reference to calculate the time travel of the sound signals from the moored emitters. It is also useful to have the float work on schedule. The microprocessor controls all subsystems except the clock, and stores the collected data at a regular schedule. The satellite transmitter is used to send data packages to orbiting satellites after the surfacing. It usually takes three days for the satellite to collect all the dataset. An isopycnal ballast spring The isobaric model An isobaric float aims to follow a constant pressure plane, by adjusting the ballast's weight to attain buoyancy to a certain depth. It is the most easily achieved model. To achieve an isobaric float, its compressibility must be much lower than that of seawater. In that case, if the float were to be moved upwards from equilibrium, it will expand less than the surrounding seawater, leading to a restoring force pushing it downwards, back to its equilibrium position. Once correctly balanced, the float will remain in a constant pressure field. The isopycnal model The aim of an isopycnal float is to follow the density planes, that is to attain neutral buoyancy for constant density. To achieve this, it is necessary to remove pressure induced restoring forces, thus the float has to have the same compressibility as the surrounding seawater. This is often achieved by a compressible element, as a piston in a cylinder, so that the CPU can change the volume according to changes in pressure. An error of about 10% in the setting can lead to a 50 m depth difference once in water. This is why floats are ballasted in tanks working at high pressure. Isopycnal floats Measures and projectsComputing the float's trajectory= Once the float's mission is over and the data collected by the satellites, one major step is to compute the float's route over time. This is done by looking at the travel time of the signals from the moored speakers to the float, computed from the emission time (known accurately), the reception time (known from the float's clock and corrected if the clock had moved). Then, because the speed of sound is known to 0.3% in sea, the position of the float can be determined to about 1 km by an iterative circular tracking procedure.Spain, Diane L., 1980: SOFAR float data report of the POLYMODE Local Dynamics Experiment. Technical report. University of Rhode Island, Narragansett Marine Laboratory, 80-1, 197pp. The doppler effect can also be taken into account. Since the float's speed is not known, a first closing speed is determined by measuring the shift in time arrival between two transmissions, where the float is considered not to have moved. =The Argo project= The Argo project is an international collaboration between 50 research and operational agencies from 26 countries that aims to measure a global array of temperature,salinity and pressure of the top 2000m of the ocean. It uses over 3000 floats, some of which use RAFOS for underwater geolocation; most simply use the Global Positioning System (GPS) to obtain a position when surfacing every 10 days. This project has greatly contributed to the scientific community and has issued many data that has since been used for ocean parameters cartography and Global change analysis. =Other results= A float trajectory and the corresponding data. Many results have been achieved thanks to these floats, on the global mapping of the ocean characteristics, or for example how floats systematically shoal (upwell) as they approach anticyclonic meanders and deepen (downwell) as they approach cyclonic meanders.Particle pathways in the Gulf Stream, T. Rossby A.S.Bower P-T Shaw, Bulletin American Meteorological Society, vol 66,n 9 On the left is a typical set of data from a RAFOS float. Today, such floats remain the best way to systematically probe the ocean's interior, since it is automatic and self- sufficient. In recent developments the floats have been able to measure different amounts of dissolved gases, and even to carry small experiments in situ.

Life and work Marina Palei was born in Leningrad to twenty-year-old Jewish parents who had met in amateur theater group in Western Ukraine (the mother of Marina was originally from Leningrad) and come to Leningrad in order to study engineering. While they studied Marina was brought up by her maternal grandparents in a small town near Leningrad, Vsevolozhsk. Marina's early childhood, spent in nature, gave the powerful impetus to her lyrical creativity. Marina attended Primary School in Leningrad. After her parents divorced, in her teenage years, Palei followed the complicated trajectory of her mother's life: she attended schools in the number of regions of the USSR (Kazakhstan, Chuvash Autonomous Republic, the Volga Region, Ukraine) and studied in many schools. The motif of homelessness and insecurity, always going to the existential generalization, also has been reflected in her works. In 1972, Palei began studying medical profession at the Leningrad Institute of Medicine. After graduating in 1978, she worked in several temporary jobs, among them as a medical technician, cleaning woman, and model, and she participated in an amateur theater group. After suffering a nervous breakdown in 1983, Palei recovered and, starting in 1984, began to write poetry. She also began work as a night watchman, a choice typical for writers and artists of her generation, symbolizing their desire to opt out of officially sanctioned cultural institutions while allowing them state-mandated employment with long stretches of time to write. Irina Rodnyanskaya, a family friend and editor at the literary journal Novyi mir, encouraged Palei to apply to the Maxim Gorky Literature Institute (in ). She was accepted, one of only five women in her class of eighty, and began writing fiction while taking classes at the institute. She gave up her night watchman job in 1987 to concentrate on writing, and her first publications were primarily literary criticism and reviews. It was during this time that Palei also became involved in the dissident movement, joining the independent Democratic Union (in ) party in 1988. Palei's first published fiction was a short story, \\"Composition on Red and Blue\\" (later renamed \\"Virage\\"). The story was printed in \\"Sobesednik\\" (the weekly supplement to \\"Komsomolskaya Pravda\\") in 1989. However, it was the novella \\"Evgesha and Annushka\\" (\\"Znamya\\" 1990) that made her famous. In 1991, Palei's novella, \\"Cabiria from the Bypass Canal,\\" was published in Novy Mir,\\" bringing her instant critical acclaim and a nomination for the prestigious Russian Booker Prize. Despite harassment from the KGB for her political activities, Palei continued to publish. She graduated cum laude in 1991 and was invited to join the Writers' Union. Although Palei emigrated to the Netherlands in 1995, she has continued to publish in Russia. Her first collection, Birthplace of the Wind (), which gathered together her best-known works and previously published story cycles, was published in 1998. This collection was followed by \\"Long Distance, ili Slavyanskyi Akcent\\" (\\"Long Distance or the Slavic Accent\\") – 2000, Vagrius, \\"The Lunch\\" (2000, Inapress), \\"Klemens\\" (2007, Vremya), \\"Tribute to Salamander\\" (2012, Eksmo). In the years 2011–2013 the publishing-house Eksmo (Moscow) has published 9-volume collected works of her prose and drama. Palei's prose has been translated into many languages, including English, German, French, Finnish, Norwegian, Swedish, Italian, Dutch, Slovakian, Slovenian, Estonian, Latvian, Japanese and Spanish. Palei's many activities also include translations. She translated Italian, Dutch, Greek, English and Slovenian poetry and Flemish prose. Marina Palei's literary achievements and her contribution to the contemporary literary process are well-known and highly regarded by international community. Literary critics and specialists in modern literature esteem her work as a progressive modern development of great traditions of Russian literature. Marina has been a guest of honor of many European literary festivals; her writings are included into obligatory reading program and seminars of several European and American Universities, her art is a subject of multiple philological studies, essays, dissertations, etc. =Membership in organizations= *Federation of Screenwriters in Europe *Netwerk scenatioschrijvers (bij VsenV) – Dutch Associations of Film and TV professionals *Union of Moscow Writers *Union of the Russian Writers *St. Petersburg Union of Writers =Literary awards=Shortlist *\\"The Lunch\\" novel () – Smirnoff-Booker Prize 2000 *\\"The Farm\\" novella () – I.P.

Figurative art is present in Europe and Southeast Asia, beginning between about 40,000 to 35,000 years ago. Non-figurative cave paintings, consisting of hand stencils and simple geometric shapes, are somewhat older, at least 40,000 years old, and possibly as old as 64,000 years. This latter estimate is due to a controversial 2018 study based on uranium-thorium dating, which would imply Neanderthal authorship and qualify as art of the Middle Paleolithic. \\"we present dating results for three sites in Spain that show that cave art emerged in Iberia substantially earlier than previously thought. Uranium- thorium (U-Th) dates on carbonate crusts overlying paintings provide minimum ages for a red linear motif in La Pasiega (Cantabria), a hand stencil in Maltravieso (Extremadura), and red-painted speleothems in Ardales (Andalucía). Collectively, these results show that cave art in Iberia is older than 64.8 thousand years (ka). This cave art is the earliest dated so far and predates, by at least 20 ka, the arrival of modern humans in Europe, which implies Neandertal authorship.\\" The emergence of figurative art has been interpreted as reflecting the emergence of full behavioral modernity, and is part of the defining characteristics separating the Upper Paleolithic from the Middle Paleolithic. The discovery of cave art of comparable age to the oldest European samples in Indonesia has established that similar artistic traditions existed both in eastern and in western Eurasia at 40,000 years ago. This has been taken to suggest that such an artistic tradition must in fact date to more than 50,000 years ago, and would have been spread along the southern coast of Eurasia in the original coastal migration movement.M. Aubert et al. (2014): \\"two figurative animal depictions from seven cave sites in the Maros karsts of Sulawesi, we show that rock art traditions on this Indonesian island are at least compatible in age with the oldest European art. [...] Among the implications, it can now be demonstrated that humans were producing rock art by ∼40 kyr ago at opposite ends of the Pleistocene Eurasian world.\\" The discovery of a figurative painting dated to over 40,000 (perhaps as old as 52,000) years old, of an unknown animal, has been announced in 2018, discovered in a cave on the Indonesian island of Borneo. It is important to note that most of the art of this period is expected to have been lost, as it was submerged in the early Holocene sea level rise. Cave art in Europe continued to the Mesolithic (at the beginnings of the Holocene) about 12,000 years ago. European Upper Paleolithic art is also known informally as \\"Ice Age art\\", in reference to the last glacial period.The term is attributed to Björn Kurtén: \\"as we look at Ice Age art, there will always remain an element of mystery and elusive\\" (B. S. John, The ice age: past and present, 1977, p. 220.  Europe  Venus of Willendorf, late Aurignacian (c. 30,000 years old) Art of the European Upper Paleolithic includes rock and cave painting, jewelry, drawing, carving, engraving and sculpture in clay, bone, antler, stone and ivory, such as the Venus figurines, and musical instruments such as flutes. Decoration was also made on functional tools, such as spear throwers, perforated batons and lamps. Engravings on flat pieces of stones are found in considerable numbers (up to 5,000 at one Spanish site) at sites with the appropriate geology, with the marks sometimes so shallow and faint that the technique involved is closer to drawing – many of these were not spotted by the earliest excavators, and found by later teams in spoil heaps. Painted plaques are less common. It is possible that they were used in rituals, or alternatively heated on a fire and wrapped as personal warmers. Either type of use may account for the many broken examples, often with the fragments dispersed over some distance (up to 30 metres apart at Gönnersdorf). Many sites have large quantities of flat stones apparently used as flooring, with only a minority decorated.Bahn and Vertut, 90–91 Some of the oldest works of art were found in the Schwäbische Alb, Baden-Württemberg, Germany. The Venus figurine known as the Venus of Hohle Fels dates to some 40,000 years ago. The so-called Adorant from the Geißenklösterle cave dates to about the same time. Other fine examples of art from the Upper Palaeolithic (broadly 40,000 to 10,000 years ago) include cave painting (such as at Chauvet, Lascaux, Altamira, Cosquer, and Pech Merle), incised / engraved cave art such as at Creswell Crags, portable art (such as animal carvings and sculptures like the Venus of Willendorf), and open-air art (such as the rock art of the Côa Valley and in Portugal; Domingo García and Siega Verde in Spain; and in France). There are numerous carved or engraved pieces of bone and ivory, such as the Swimming Reindeer found in France from the Magdalenian period. These include spear throwers, including one shaped like a mammoth, and many of the type of objects called a bâton de commandement. Bison painting (replica) from the Cave of Altamira, dated to the Magdalenian. The animals depicted are prey sought by the Paleolithic hunters, such as reindeer,e.g. the Magdalenian Swimming Reindeer (13 ka) found in France horses,e.g. the Solutrean horse figurine from Vogelherd Cave, bisons,Bison figurine from Vogelherd Cave, mammoth, the woolly rhinoceros,Wooly Rhinoceros from and birds, as well as apex predators such as lions panthers or leopards, hyenas and bears. The human form was represented comparatively rarely (relative to the depiction of animals); most notable are the Venus figurines (representation of the female form, emphasizing breasts and/or buttocks). The Lion-man of Hohlenstein-Stadel (Aurignacian) is a hybrid creature with a lion's head on a human body. Other possible hybrid figures are the Shaman of Trois-Frères and a \\"Bison-man\\" from the same cave system, another \\"Bison-man\\" from the Grotte de Gabillou in the Dordogne, and what might be a bird-headed man in the \\"Shaft of the Dead Man\\" in the Lascaux caves. Representation of males are rare prior to incipient Mesolithic. Mesolithic examples include the \\"Pin Hole man\\" of Creswell Crags, Derbyshire. There is evidence for some craft specialization, and the transport over considerable distances of materials such as stone and, above all marine shells, much used for jewellery and probably decorating clothes. Shells from Mediterranean species have been found at Gönnersdorf, over 1,000 kilometres from the Mediterranean coast. The higher sea levels today mean that the level and nature of coastal settlements in the Upper Paleolithic are now submerged and remain unknown.Bahn and Vertut, 88  East and Southeast Asia  Hand stencils from Leang-Leang Prehistoric Site, Maros, Sulawesi. Cave paintings from the Indonesian island of Sulawesi are situated in the Caves in the district of Maros were dated based on Uranium–thorium dating in a 2014 study. The oldest dated image was a hand stencil, given a minimum age of 39,900 years. A painting of a babirusa was dated to at least 35.4 ka, placing it among the oldest known figurative depictions worldwide. M. Aubert et al., \\"Pleistocene cave art from Sulawesi, Indonesia\\", Nature volume 514, pages 223–227 (09 October 2014) \\"using uranium-series dating of coralloid speleothems directly associated with 12 human hand stencils and two figurative animal depictions from seven cave sites in the Maros karsts of Sulawesi, we show that rock art traditions on this Indonesian island are at least compatible in age with the oldest European art.

In addition, a painting of a babirusa ('pig-deer') made at least 35.4 kyr ago is among the earliest dated figurative depictions worldwide, if not the earliest one.

Potsherds in a style reminiscent of early Japanese work have been found at Kosan-ri on Jeju island, which, due to lower sea levels at the time, would have been accessible from Japan.Portal, p. 26 In November 2018, scientists reported the discovery of the oldest known figurative art painting, over 40,000 (perhaps as old as 52,000) years old, of an unknown animal, in the cave of Lubang Jeriji Saléh on the Indonesian island of Borneo.  Australia  Bradshaw rock paintings found in the north-west Kimberley region of Western Australia Gabarnmung, or Nawarla Gabarnmung, is an Aboriginal archaeological and rock art site in south-western Arnhem Land, in the Top End of Australia's Northern Territory. The rock shelter features prehistoric paintings of fish, including the barramundi, wallabies, crocodiles, people and spiritual figures. Most of the paintings are located on the shelter's ceiling, but many are found on the walls and pillars of the site. The painting on the ceiling has been securely dated to before 27,000 years ago.A slab of painted rock which fell to the floor had ash adhering which was radiocarbon dated at which indicates that the ceiling must have been painted before this time. Radiocarbon dating of charcoal excavated from the base of the lowest stratigraphic layer of the floor returned a mean age of suggesting the oldest date for the earliest human habitation. Faceted and use-striated hematite crayons have been recovered from nearby locations (Malakunanja II and Nauwalabila 1) in strata dated from 45,000 to 60,000 years old which suggests that the Gabarnmung shelter may have been decorated from its inception.. The Bradshaws are a unique form of rock art found in Western Australia. They are predominantly human figures drawn in fine detail with accurate anatomical proportioning. They have been dated at over 17,000 years old.Michaelsen, Per Henrik et al. “Australian Ice Age Rock Art May Depict Earth's Oldest Recordings of Shamanistic Rituals.” (2000). Near East and North Africa Carving of a horse, Hayonim Cave, Israel, 28000 BP. Upper Paleolithic sites of the Near East, such as the Hayonim Cave, a cave located in a limestone bluff about 250 meters above modern sea level, in the Upper Galilee, Israel, have wall carvings depicting symbolic shapes and animals, such a running horse dated to the Levantine Aurignacian circa 28000 BP, and visible in the Israel Museum.'Quantitative Phytolith Study of Hearths from the Natufian and Middle Paleolithic Levels of Hayonim Cave, (Galilee, Israel)' Journal of Archaeological Science 30, pages 461-480., Albert, Rosa M., Ofer Bar-Yosef, Liliane Meignen, and Steve Weiner 2003 This is considered as the first art object found within the context of the Levantine Upper Paleolithic. Petroglyphs of the North African Mesolithic, such as those at Tassili n'Ajjer, Algeria, are dated to about 12,000 to 10,000 years old.  Sub-Saharan Africa  Zoomorphic pictogram on stone slab from the MSA of Apollo 11 Cave The oldest known figurative art from Sub-Saharan Africa are seven stone plaquettes painted with figures of animals found at the Apollo 11 Cave complex in Namibia, and dated to between 27,500 and 22,500 years ago.Coulson, pp. 76–77 There is a substantial amount of rock art attributable to the Bushmen (San) found throughout Southern Africa. Much of this art is recent (as evident from the subject matter depicted, including depictions of wagons and of white settlers wearing hats), but the oldest samples have been tentatively dated to as early as 26,000 years ago.Anne I.

Zimbabwe (africanrockart.org), Unesco World Heritage nr. 306. Petroglyphs in West Africa, such as those of Bidzar, Cameroon, are dated to after 3,000 years ago.  Americas  The Americas were first reached at the very end of the Last Glacial Maximum. The oldest known art from the Americas dates to the beginning Holocene. Thus, the rock paintings in the Toquepala Caves in southern Peru are dated at ca. 11,500 years ago.Lavallée, p. 94 Some of the paintings are figurative, notably including a scene of armed men hunting guanaco cameloids. The men are in a posture of attacking the animals with axe, lances, and spear throwers (but not including bow and arrow). The paintings are polychrome, with red made from hematite being the dominant color.. Early burial sites in Peru, such as the one at Telarmachay dating from about 10 ka onward, contained evidence of ritual burial, with deposits of red ocher and bead necklaces marking the site.Lavallée, p. 115  See also  * Cave painting * Cro-Magnon * Kapova Cave * List of Stone Age art * Mask of la Roche-Cotard  Notes  References     Further reading  *  External links  * * EuroPreArt Database of European Prehistoric Art * Human Timeline (Interactive) – Smithsonian, National Museum of Natural History (August 2016). *Image Database Paleolithic art in Northern Spain Upper Paleolithic Category:Upper Paleolithic ","title":"Art of the Upper Paleolithic"},{"id":"22812780","text":"Track layout is a railway station in the city of Tokoname, Aichi, Japan, owned by Central Japan International Airport Line Company, Ltd. and leased to the private railway operator Meitetsu.

ESIP membership includes federal data centers, government research laboratories, research universities, education resource providers, technology developers, and nonprofit and commercial enterprises.  History  ESIP is a community drawn from agencies and individuals who provide handling for Earth and environmental science data and information. ESIP was founded in 1998 by NASA in response to a National Research Council (NRC) review of the Earth Observation System Data and Information System (EOSDIS). The NRC called on NASA to develop a new, distributed structure that would be operated and managed by the Earth science community that would include those responsible for all elements of Earth observation, including observation, research, and ultimately, application and education. Beginning with 24 NASA-funded partners, ESIP's purpose was to evolve methods to make Earth science data easy to preserve, locate, access and use by research, education, and commercial interests. NASA developed the ESIP Federation by starting with a set of working prototype projects called ESIPs, representing both the research and applications development communities. These prototype projects were joined by nine NASA data archive centers to form the core of the early ESIP Federation and were responsible for creating its governing structures and the collaborative community it is today. By 2001, the ESIP Federation created a non-profit corporation called the Foundation for Earth Science (Foundation). Through a Memorandum of Understanding with the ESIP Federation, the foundation provided management support to the ESIP Federation as it moved from an operational prototype to an independent organization. In 2002, Foundation staff were hired to support the work of the ESIP Federation. The foundation helped create operating policies for the ESIP Federation and facilitated the development of its first strategic plan, adopted by the ESIP Federation’s Assembly in 2004. NOAA’s data centers joined the ESIP Federation. Beginning in July 2007 in Madison, Wisconsin, a Strategic Planning Working Group was formed to develop a new vision of the ESIP Federation in its second decade. The ESIP Federation’s partner organizations include all NOAA, NASA and USGS Earth observing data centers, government research laboratories, research universities, modelers, education resource providers, technology developers, nonprofits and commercial enterprises. In 2009 and 2010 new ESIP Federation communities formed around data preservation and stewardship, information quality, and data visualization.  Partners  ESIP is made up of more than 120 partner organizations that span NASA, NOAA, EPA, USGS and DOE research-funded groups. ESIP's partners represent earth science data and technology interests. There are four types of partners; Type I includes Data Centers, Type II are data and information product providers, Type III are commercial and non-commercial organizations that develop tools for Earth Science and Type IV are the funding providers, NASA, NOAA and USGS. A full listing of ESIP Partners is at the organization's website.

He is an Indian footballer who plays as a defender for India.After impressing at under-16 level while playing for Manipur under-16 despite being only 13, Surkumar was roped in by Tata Football Academy. He spent four years in TFA and used to play as a center back. He also made his international debut in 2001 in the historic 1-0 win over UAE in a 2002 World Cup qualifier. CareerEast Bengal= After signing his first professional contract with East Bengal, he was turned into a right back by then-East Bengal coach Syed Nayemuddin. That change brought the best out of Surkumar as he played a key role in East Bengal’s first ever National League title. =Mahindra United= After just one season with the red and gold brigade, he joined Mahindra United. He won the Durand Cup with the Mumbai-based outfit but also tore his ligament there in a Mumbai League match. =East Bengal= Surkumar returned to East Bengal for his second spell and won the treble with them in 2003 - ASEAN Cup, National Football League (NFL) and Kolkata Premier League. =Mahindra United= Surkumar then joined Mahindra for the second time in his career and spent three successful seasons with the Mumbai club. The fullback won every major trophy with the Red Devils of India and was adjudged AIFF Player of the Year in 2006. =East Bengal= He rejoined East Bengal for this third spell and won the Federation Cup in 2007. =Mohun Bagan= Then in 2009, for the first time in his career Surkumar signed for Mohun Bagan. He had scored the only goal from a Snehasish Chakraborty corner, as debutantes Shillong Lajong F.C. had thrashed the century-old club 1-4 at Kolkata.http://www.shillonglajong.com/lajong-hammer-mohan-bagan-4-1 =Mumbai Tigers= In the 2013 I-League 2nd Division, he had opened the scoring for the Mumbai Tigers F.C. in their last match against Bhawanipore F.C. in the 3-5 loss. He won the Kolkata League with Mohun Bagan in his first season and will be an important player for them once he returns from international duty. For the national team, Surkumar has been a regular since the 2005 SAFF Cup triumph. The attacking right wingback has easily been India’s best player in that position in the last decade. Unlike very few fullbacks in the country, Surkumar also has the ability to score goals, especially from long range. He has four international goals to his name with the most recent one coming in the 3-6 defeat against Yemen in Pune. =United Sikkim F.C.= In 2014, he has joined United Sikkim F.C.

Singer was instrumental in launching the careers of Peter Sarstedt, David Sylvian, Japan, and Ana Silvera. Early years: 1960s–1970s Ray Singer was born in Tonbridge, Kent, England, and raised in Brighton. He first became involved in music by forming a skiffle group as a student in Brighton, and in 1964 made his first records as a singer under the wing of Jeffrey Kruger, who signed him to his independent record label, Ember Records, after seeing him sing in a charity show. Ember Records released Singer's \\"Tell Me Now\\" in 1964. He appeared on television programmes with The Who, the Small Faces, and The Kinks and was a featured artist on Gadzooks!, a weekly BBC2 TV show with Marianne Faithfull and Lulu. Always more interested in production/arrangement, he had the opportunity to work with record producers such as Shel Talmy (The Kinks, The Who) and Jimmy Miller (Traffic, The Rolling Stones), an experience that led him to eventually produce for Chris Blackwell's Island Records. He also attended the London School of Film Technique and joined Nirvana, with fellow film student, Alex Spiropolous. They were signed to Island Records and recorded \\"Tiny Goddess\\". As a songwriter he had success with Françoise Hardy, whose version of \\"Tiny Goddess\\" (\\"Je Ne Sais Pas Ce Que Veux\\") went to number one in the French charts. Singer also went on to write and produce for the French singer Michel Polnareff. Singer/Sarstedt collaboration Whilst working in Paris he discovered a busker from London, the singer-songwriter Peter Sarstedt. Singer took him into the studios for Island and recorded Peter Sarstedt, an album of his compositions. From these sessions came the million selling \\"Where Do You Go To (My Lovely)?\\" Sarstedt hits that followed included \\"Frozen Orange Juice\\" and \\"I'm A Cathedral\\". 1980s–1990s Singer was eventually to settle in London, becoming best known for his work with British singer-songwriters, including Peter Sarstedt, David Sylvian, Joan Armatrading and Ana Silvera. Some of this work was produced by his own production company, Rocking Horse Productions, which he co-founded with Simon Napier-Bell. He then went to New York where he was signed to make albums for RCA, ABC and UNI Records. He came back to London and worked mostly at Olympic Studios in Barnes with top musicians including The Average White Band's bass player Alan Gorrie and guitarist Onnie McIntyre, guitarist Chris Spedding, drummer Jim Gordon and bass player Herbie Flowers. Singer also started producing for the German record label, Ariola Records, and had hits with \\"When You Walk in the Room\\" and \\"It's Only Make Believe\\", by the boy band Child, and subsequently had success with Joan Armatrading's \\"Rosie\\" and Robin Sarstedt's \\"My Resistance Is Low\\". He produced the first two albums for pop/rock group Japan, Adolescent Sex (1978) and Obscure Alternatives (also 1978). Film and television music He started to work with the film composer, Michael Storey, and went on to produce over one hundred television commercials, including the Levi's and Guinness commercials featuring actor Rutger Hauer. Singer's graduation from the London Film School, and his interest in movies, led him onto producing the soundtracks for the British film, Another Country, starring Rupert Everett and Colin Firth and, in Hollywood, Waiting for the Light, starring Shirley MacLaine and Teri Garr. Television soundtracks followed, including the BBC adaption of John le Carré's A Perfect Spy, Anthony Horowitz's The Gift and South by South-East. The Lynda La Plante series, Civvies, won an Ivor Novello Award for best music. 2000-present Singer set up his own recording studio in London and his own label, Singer Records. The success of the Wes Anderson movie, The Darjeeling Limited, with Owen Wilson, Adrien Brody and Anjelica Huston, which featured Peter Sarstedt's \\"Where Do You Go To, My Lovely\\", led to Singer Records releasing The Lost Album by Peter Sarstedt, which has become an iTunes best seller. Other artists featured on Singer Records are Suggs from Madness, Toyah Willcox and Imaani from Incognito. He worked on singer- songwriter Ana Silvera's album, The Aviary, co-produced alongside Brad Albetta.

It belongs to the Byzantine text-type as one of the textual families of this group. The group contains no uncial manuscripts, but is represented by a substantial number of minuscules.  Description  The group was discovered by Hermann von Soden in the late 19th century and designated by him with symbol Kr.H. von Soden 1902–10 Die Schriften des Neuen Testaments, in ihrer ältesten erreichbaren Textgestalt hergestellt auf Grund ihrer Textgeschichte, von Arthur Glaue, Berlin, pp. 757–65, 799–805. According to Soden, the group is the result of an early 12th century attempt to create a unified New Testament text; the copying was controlled and the accuracy is unequalled in the history of the transmission of the New Testament text. Text Kr gained in popularity and became the most copied Greek text of the late Middle Ages. On the basis of the present location of most of the members of the group, it appears to have originated in the area of Constantinople or Mount Athos. Majority of manuscript can be recognized by the distinctive marginal lectionary equipment which are different from the traditional Eusebian Canons. Von Soden used this markings to identify Kr members. The text of the group is also distinct and easy to identify.F. Wisse, The Profile Method for the Classification and Evaluation of Manuscript Evidence, as Applied to the Continuous Greek Text of the Gospel of Luke, William B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1982, p. 92. One characteristic of these manuscripts is that the story of Jesus and the woman taken in adultery (John 7:53–8:11) is marked with obeli. Maurice Robinson argues that these marks do not represent a textual judgment, but are intended as a reminder that these verses are to be omitted when reading the Gospel for Pentecost (John 7:37–8:12). David O. Voss confirmed the distinctiveness of the Kr group. He enumerated some readings typical for this group.David O. Voss 1938, Is von Soden's Kr a distinct type of Text? JBL 57, pp. 311–18.

Indigenous peoples around the world still use clay widely, which is related to geophagy. The first recorded use of medicinal clay goes back to ancient Mesopotamia. A wide variety of clays are used for medicinal purposes—primarily for external applications, such as the clay baths in health spas (mud therapy). Among the clays most commonly used are kaolin and the smectite clays such as bentonite, montmorillonite, and Fuller's earth. HistoryAncient Egypt and Mesopotamia= The first recorded use of medicinal clay is on Mesopotamian clay tablets around 2500 B.C. Also, ancient Egyptians used clay. The Pharaohs’ physicians used the material as anti- inflammatory agents and antiseptics. It was used as a preservative for making mummies and is also reported that Cleopatra used clays to preserve her complexion. The Ebers Papyrus of about 1550 BC (but containing the tradition going back many centuries earlier) is an important medical text from ancient Egypt. It describes the use of ochre for a wide variety of complaints, including for intestinal problems, as well as for various eye complaints. =Classical times=Lemnian clay This was a clay used in Classical Antiquity. It was mined on the island of Lemnos. Its use continued until the 19th century, as it was still listed in an important pharmacopoeia in 1848 (the deposits may have been exhausted by then). Pliny reports about the Lemnian earth: > if rubbed under the eyes, it moderates pain and watering from the same, and > prevents the flow from the lachrymal ducts. In cases of haemorrhage it > should be administered with vinegar. It is used against complaints of the > spleen and kidneys, copious menstruation, also against poisons, and wounds > caused by serpents. Lemnian clay was shaped into tablets, or little cakes, and then distinctive seals were stamped into them, giving rise to its name terra sigillata—Latin for 'sealed earth'. Dioscorides also commented upon the use of terra sigillata. Another physician famous in antiquity, Galen, recorded numerous cases of the internal and external uses of this clay in his treatise on clay therapy. > Galen... used as one of his means for curing injuries, festering wounds, and > inflammations terra sigillata, a medicinal red clay compressed into round > cakes and stamped with the image of the goddess Diana. This clay, which came > from the island of Lemnos, was known throughout the classical world. Clay was prescribed by the Roman obstetrician, gynecologist, and pediatrician Soranus of Ephesus, who practiced medicine around 100-140 AD. Other clays used in classical times The other types of clay that were famous in antiquity were as follows. * Terra chia, Terra cymolia (Cimolean earth): these were both white earths and considered of great value. * Samian earth: Pliny in c. 50 AD (Nat. Hist.) details two distinct varieties, colyrium - an eye salve, and aster, which was used as a soap as well as in medicines. * Terra sigillata strigoniensis (Strigian earth, derived from Silesia) - this clay, yellow in colour, appears to have been famous later in medieval times. All the above seem to have been bentonitic clays. * The earth which did not stain the hands was known as rubrica. Medieval times In medieval Persia, Avicenna (980-1037 CE), the 'Prince of Doctors', wrote about clay therapy in his numerous treatises. Ibn al-Baitar (1197–1248), a Muslim scholar born at Malaga, Spain, and author of a famous work on pharmacology, discusses eight kinds of medicinal earth. The eight kinds are: # the terra sigillata, # Egyptian earth, # Samian earth, # earth of Chios, # Cimolean earth or pure clay (cimolite), soft earth, called al-hurr, green in color like verdigris, is smoked together with almond bark to serve as food when it will turn red and assume a good flavor; it is but rarely eaten without being smoked—also called 'Argentiera', # earth of vines called ampelitis (Pliny XXXV, 56) or pharmakitis from Seleucia in Syria, # Armenian earth (also known as the Armenian bole), salutary in cases of bubonic plague, being administered both externally and internally, # earth of Nishapur. Renaissance period A French naturalist Pierre Belon (1517–1564) was interested in investigating the mystery of the Lemnian clay. In 1543, he visited Constantinople where, after making enquiries, he encountered 18 types of different products marketed as Lemnian Earth (he was concerned about possible counterfeits). He then made a special journey to Lemnos, where he continued his investigation, and tried to find the source of the clay. He discovered that it was extracted only once a year (on 6 August) under the supervision of Christian monks and Turkish officials. Preparation of clay Clay gathered from its original source deposit is refined and processed in various ways by manufacturers. This can include heating or baking the clay, since the raw clay tends to contain a variety of micro-organisms. Too much processing, likewise, may reduce the clay's therapeutic potential. In particular, Mascolo et al. studied 'pharmaceutical grade clay' versus 'the natural and the commercial herbalist clay', and found an appreciable depletion of trace elements in the pharmaceutical grade clay. On the other hand, certain clays are typically heated or cooked before use. Medicinal clay is typically available in health food stores as a dry powder, or in jars in its liquid hydrated state – which is convenient for internal use. For external use, the clay may be added to the bath, or prepared in wet packs or poultices for application to specific parts of the body. Often, warm packs are prepared; the heat opens up the pores of the skin, and helps the interaction of the clay with the body. In the European health spas, the clay is prepared for use in a multitude of ways – depending on the traditions of a particular spa; typically it is mixed with peat and matured in special pools for a few months or even up to two years. > \\"The majority of spas … use artificial ponds where the natural (\\"virgin\\") > clay is mixed with mineral, thermo-mineral, or sea water that issues in the > vicinity of the spas or inside the spa buildings.\\" =Trace minerals= Clays contain large amounts of trace minerals. It is common to see as many as 75 different trace minerals in Montmorillonite clays. (US patent). See: Table 1: Montmorillonite Components; Average Nutrient Content. Retrieved 20 October 2017. Specific trace minerals that various clays possess vary very widely. Also, the amount of any particular trace mineral in any specific clay varies a lot among clays from different locations. For example, the amount of iron in various bentonite clays can vary from well below 1%, and up to 10%. UsesSkin conditions= Many types of skin conditions have been treated by the application of medicinal clay. Montmorillonite has shown its effectiveness in this area. It has also been used as a base ingredient for tissue engineering. Clay is used in many dermatological over-the-counter remedies, such as in acne treatments (this information may not be mentioned on the label specifically). =Internal use= There are many over the counter remedies for internal use that contained clay before discontinuation. Examples include Kaopectate (Upjohn), Rheaban (Leeming Div., Pfizer), and Diar-Aid (Thompson Medical Co.). The labels on all of these showed the active ingredient to be Attapulgite, each tablet containing 600 (or 750 mg) of this component along with inert materials or adjuvants.. (US Patent). Retrieved 20 October 2017. However, since April 2003, attapulgite medication was discontinued due to lack of evidence according to the U.S. Foods and Drugs Administration. Numerous medicines also use Kaolinite clay, which has long been a traditional remedy to soothe an upset stomach. Also, Kaolin is or has been used as the active substance in liquid anti-diarrhea medicines such as Kaomagma. Such medicines were changed away from aluminium substances due to a scare over Alzheimer's disease, but have since changed back to compounds containing aluminum as they are most effective. Kaolin was also used to treat cholera around the start of the 20th century. An early proponent was German physician Julius Stumpf. =Heavy metal chelation= It has been used as a scientifically unsupported chelation treatment for heart disease and autism. =Aflatoxicosis= It has been found that prolonged exposure to bentonite in humans can actually have harmful effects. =Use by the NASA space program= A mountain of clay — Petrified Forest National Park, Arizona. The white bands represent pure bentonite clay. The effects of weightlessness on human body were studied by NASA in the 1960s. Experiments demonstrated that weightlessness leads to a rapid bone depletion, so various remedies were sought to counter that. A number of pharmaceutical companies were asked to develop calcium supplements, but apparently none of them were as effective as clay. The special clay that was used in this case was Terramin, a reddish clay found in California. Benjamin Ershoff of the California Polytechnic Institute demonstrated that the consumption of clay counters the effects of weightlessness. He reported that \\"the calcium in clay ...is absorbed more efficiently ... [clay] contains some factor or factors other than calcium which promotes improved calcium utilization and/or bone formation.\\" He added, \\"Little or no benefit was noted when calcium alone was added to the diet.\\" Side effects of ingestion Substances discontinued such as kaolin and attapulgite were formerly considered gastric demulcents and diarrhea medication, until official studies by the USFDA disproved these views. Clays are classified as excipients and their main side-effects are that of neutral excipients, which is to impair and slow down absorption of antibiotics, hormones and heart medication amongst others by coating the digestive tract and this slowed down absorption can lead to increased toxicity of some medication (e.g. citrate salts) which can become toxic if not metabolized quickly enough, which is one contraindication of attapulgite. Usual mild side-effects are nausea, slowed down absorption of nutrients from food (in excess dosage of medicinal clay) and constipation. Common medicinal clays * Bentonite-type clay has been used to treat infections, indigestion, and other medical problems by both applying wet clay topically to the skin as a poultice, and by ingesting it. Bentonite has been prescribed as a bulk laxative, and it is also used as a base for many dermatologic formulas.Bentonite from oregonstate.edu website Dermatologically, it is used as part of a treatment for pruritus.Calamine from www.drugs.com website Bentonite itself is not classified as a carcinogen, but some bentonite may contain variable amounts of respirable crystalline silica, a human carcinogen. * Montmorillonite is the main constituent of bentonite. * Palygorskite or attapulgite is a very absorbent clay, somewhat similar to bentonite. When used in medicine, it physically binds to acids and toxic substances in the stomach and digestive tract. For this reason, it has been used in several anti- diarrheal medications,Information from Drugs.com but studies of such have since been rejected by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as insufficient.FDA Final rule.FDA \\"Kaopectate reformulation and upcoming labeling changes.\\" * Kaolin is not as absorbent as most clays used medicinally (it has a low shrink-swell capacity). Also, it has a low cation exchange capacity. This clay is also known as 'white cosmetic clay'. Clay, in the form of kaolin, was a common ingredient in western medicines such as Kaopectate, Rolaids and Maalox, but is no longer present in them nor in similar preparations, as it is considered ineffective by the USFDA.

Background  A temporary ceasefire was called in the Malakand region on February 16, 2009. The provincial government agreed to allow the implementation of Sharia in the region once violence had stopped. Sufi Muhammad traveled to Swat to discuss peace with Fazlullah and his followers, who agreed to observe the ceasefire. On February 24, 2009 Muslim Khan, spokesperson of the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) publicly announced that his group would observe an indefinite ceasefire. The ANP, the governing party of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa sent the bill to President Asif Ali Zardari, who delayed signing it into law until \\"the writ of the government [had] been established.\\" Soon after that the militants expanded their territory into other districts and by mid-April they took Buner, Lower Dir and Shangla. With the Taliban takeover the militants came within of the capital of Pakistan, Islamabad. It was the closest that Taliban forces ever got to capturing the Pakistan capital, Islamabad. This raised the alarm among western countries, particularly the United States, that a collapse of the country and a Taliban takeover was playing out. The government was highly criticized for making peace deals with the militants. Therefore, the Pakistani government launched an operation in late April to retake all territory lost in the previous months.  Operation  Attack on Lower Dir = Operation Toar Tander-I (Black Thunderstorm-I) began in Lower Dir as the Frontier Corps (FC) killed 26 Taliban, including key commanders Maulana Shahid and Qari Quraish. The operation was launched on April 26, after the Taliban, in violation of the peace agreement, attacked security forces and government officials and closed roads for the movement of government and FC convoys. In some villages, the Taliban had looted shops and tortured villagers to gain their support, adding that a jirga had also been forced to back them. Officials said the forces were gaining ground against the Taliban and their hideouts in Kalkot, Islam Dara and Hoshyari Dara were targeted. Paramilitary troops and helicopter gunships bombed suspected Taliban bases during the operation. Eight soldiers and around 50 militants were killed in two days of fighting. The operation mostly cleared the Lower Dir district of Taliban forces by April 28. However, the military was still fighting with pockets of militant resistance in the coming weeks. =Buner Assault = The second phase of the operation started the same day as fighting in Lower Dir was dying down. The Pakistan Army's push to retake control of Buner, which was only away from the capital city Islamabad, started. Special Forces members belonging to Pakistan Army's 50th Airborne Division and the Pakistan Army's Special Services Group swarmed down ropes from helicopters to enter the town of Daggar, which lies in the strategically important Buna valley to the northwest of Islamabad, killing nearly 50 militants. Pakistan Army leaders hoped to trap about 500 militants in between the 50th Airborne forces and SSG Division's teams that were advancing on the ground towards Taliban positions at the valley's entrance. The fate of 75 police officers taken hostage by the Taliban in Buner the previous night remained unclear. 18 were rescued the next day but the others were still prisoners. The troops belonging to 50th Airborne Division jumped first on April 30 in Buner City between 00:48 and 01:40. The Pakistan Air Force's SS Wing's 1st SOS Squadron flew the No. 6 Squadron Globe Trotters transport aircraft where hundreds of additional members of 50th Airborne Division, Special Services Group - Navy, 4th SOS Squadron, 140th Expeditionary Marines Battalion and the 1st Commando Yildiram Battalion, SSG jumped off in the dark night of April 31, and landed in different areas of Buner where they had taken the strategic positions. The battle between the Pakistani Air Force and Taliban forces ended when the Taliban had lost a large number of their men and suffered heavy human casualties caused by the Airborne Forces of Pakistan Armed Forces. The operation in Daggar came on the third day of the Army's offensive to roll back the Taliban advance that had caused concern not just in Islamabad – which is just 65 miles away – but also in Washington. Major General Athar Abbas, a military spokesman, told reporters in Rawalpindi that the Army and Frontier Corps paramilitary units launched the operation in Buner district, building on a several-day offensive in the region. Abbas said an estimated 450 to 500 Taliban are believed active in Buner, many believed to be engaged in \\"criminal activities.\\" The US had been repeatedly pressing the Pakistan government to take action, fearful that the militants were gaining too much ground and might even use Buner as a bridgehead for an attack on Islamabad. On May 2, another 10 soldiers were captured in Buner. The military confirmed that some 87 militants and four soldiers had been killed in fighting in the district between April 28 and May 4. The military also stated that its troops were confronted during the fighting with wave attacks of suicide car- bombers. At least 27 suicide bombers were killed in the fighting. By May 5, troops started to push back the Taliban militants in Buner. = Operation Rah- e-Rast = Airborne paratroopers took active participation in the war and pushed Taliban back to areas adjacent to Afghanistan. On May 5, the third phase of the operation started as airborne troops boarded on C-130 transport aircraft, jumped off and stormed the militant-held valley of Swat. The name of this sub-operation of Black Thunderstorm has been referred to as Operation Rah-e-Rast in Urdu . In more than a month of fighting, by June 15, 30 soldiers and 1,040 militants were killed. Militant fighters were holed up in the emerald mines and in the main town of Swat district, Mingora. The emerald mines were secured by the Army's 50th Airborne division by May 7, but the militants were still holding their positions in Mingora and on a strategic hilltop overlooking the town. Meanwhile, on May 7, in Lower Dir, which was previously declared clear of the Taliban by the military, militants overran a paramilitary fort, killing three paramilitary soldiers and capturing 10 policemen. On the midnight of May 10, additional airborne troops with small teams of Pakistan Navy SEALs jumped off from C-130 transport aircraft, and attacked a Taliban hidden training camp at Banai Baba in Shangla district, which is just east from Swat. In the fighting at Banai Baba the military reported killing 150 militants for the loss of two soldiers. At the same time as the fighting in Shangla, some sporadic fighting was still continuing in Lower Dir where, over four days, 109 more militants were killed. Also, further west, in the Mohmand agency, a group of 300 militants attacked a military outpost; in the fighting that ensued 26 militants were killed and 14 soldiers were wounded. On May 12, Pakistani SSG commandos were inserted by helicopters into the Piochar area, a rear-support base for the militants in the northern part of the Swat valley, to conduct search-and-destroy operations. By May 15, the Army claimed that Buner was finally completely cleared of Taliban forces, however artillery bombardment of Taliban positions in the hills was still ongoing. And it was reported that the Taliban were more dug in and in larger numbers in Buner than the military previously assumed. Meanwhile, the Pakistani military continued with their push up the Swat valley. As the military approached Mingora, the Taliban were digging in for a \\"bloody urban battle\\" against the Pakistani army's airborne forces in a hotly disputed city in the north-western part of the country. The Taliban began concentrating forces in Mingora - digging trenches, laying mines and taking positions on rooftops. Stratfor, a private firm that describes itself as a global intelligence company, mentioned that it is not clear if the Pakistani military is trained and even equipped to go into a situation like that, adding that even the United States military \\"would have to think twice\\" about such an offensive. Pakistani military spokesman Major General Athar Abbas, who is the spokesman for Pakistan's military said \\"the military intends to drive the Taliban out of the contested area, even if the kind of fighting resembles that of the Battle of Stalingrad\\". He said that the whole resolve of the government and the military is to once and for all finish the Taliban from the Swat valley. The army has about 15,000 troops on the ground and is estimated that there are still over 5,000 Taliban fighters in the area. On May 17, heavy street fighting started in the towns of Kanju and Matta and the Army was slowly advancing towards Mingora. Also, a few days later fighting started in the area of the Takhtaband bridge for control of this crossing point. On May 20, a key town in Buner was captured by the Army. The Army captured Sultanwas in fighting which, according to the military, killed one soldier and 80 militants, another nine soldiers were wounded. By May 23, Kanju, Matta and the Takhtaband bridge had been secured by the military, but fighting was still going on in Takhtaband itself and the Buner and Dir districts, where nine more militants were killed. Meanwhile, the military was surrounding the main militant base in the Peochar Valley. = Battle for Mingora = Military personnel observing the city and the valley of Swat after the successful capture. On May 23, the battle for the capital of Swat, Mingora, started as the small teams belonging to SSG Division accompanied with Army Rangers stormed the city. The Ranger and SSG Division's teams entered in the city from two different phases. The SSG Division's team at first entered the city from the air as they were parachuted. At the same time, the Army Rangers and additional SSG Division's teams entered the city as they were boarded on M113C and the APC Talha-B. Combat here was heavy, intense, and occurred in the streets. Taliban Fighters had dug themselves into bunkers built into hotels and government buildings. Pakistan's SSG and Army Rangers had fought the Taliban fighters hand-to-hand inside the buildings and hotels. On the first day of the tiring and long battle, fighting was mainly in the center of the city, at the central bus terminal and along the main road near the city's primary gateway. By the next day's early morning, the military captured several intersections and three squares; including Green Square, which had been known as \\"Bloody Intersection\\", because the Taliban were dumping bodies of people who they executed at that location. Intense fighting was going on in the Nawa Kilay neighbourhood and the western suburb of Qambar. By May 27, the military took control of 70 percent of the city, including the city's airport, and Taliban forces across Swat were in retreat, but fighting was still continuing. At the same time, in continuing battles in Lower Dir and Shangla, three more soldiers and eight militants were killed. On May 29, the Army cleared Aman Kot and the Technical Institute College on the Mingora-Kokarai road in Mingora. On the same day, the village of Peochar in the Peochar Valley, as well as the town of Bahrain in the north of Swat, had been taken by the military. On May 30, the Pakistani military had taken back the city of Mingora from the Taliban, calling it a significant victory in its offensive against the Taliban. However, some sporadic fighting was still continuing on the city's outskirts. Also, sporadic fighting was continuing in the rest of Swat and in the Shangla district where on June 2, two soldiers and five militants were killed. In the battle for Mingora 286 militants were killed. = Alleged capture of Sufi Muhammad and other leaders = On June 4, it was reported that Sufi Muhammad, the founder of Tehreek-e-Nafaz-e-Shariat-e- Mohammadi or TNSM, was arrested in Amandarra along with other militant leaders. In the coming days there was confusion over this claim since the Taliban themselves said that Muhammad was missing. However, several days later it was confirmed that Muhammad was not captured and was in hiding, while two of his aides were captured by the Army. Those two aides, Muhammad Maulana Alam and Ameer Izzat Khan, were killed when militants attacked the prison transport they were in on June 7. On 26 July 2009, the government confirmed the arrest of Sufi Mohammad for encouraging violence and terrorism. = Sporadic fighting = By this point, the Pakistan Military was in control of much of Swat, however sporadic fighting still continued, especially in the Upper Dir District. After a bomb explosion in Hayagai Sharki village's masjid in Dir, which killed 38 civilians, local tribesmen, between 1,000 and 1,500, formed a lashkar (citizen's militia) and retaliated against the Taliban and TNSM by taking up arms and surrounding almost 300 militants. In support of the Lashkars, the Pakistan Military sent its helicopter gunships to the villages of Shatkas and Ghazi Gai where the heaviest fighting was ongoing. Paramilitary soldiers also set up mortars on high ground above the villages. On June 12, troops captured the town of Chuprial in Swat in a major battle that left 39 militants and 10 soldiers dead. This was the last major battle, and one of the most bloody, of the operation. On June 14, the operation ended with Pakistani troops consolidating their positions in the four districts and going after the remaining pockets of resistance, primarily in the Swat valley.  Casualties  In all, according to the military, 50 soldiers and at least 1,475 militants were killed and 100 soldiers were wounded during operation Black Thunderstorm. 114 militants were captured, including some local commanders. At least 23 of the militants killed were foreigners. Later revelations about the Swat deal On May 13, 2009, Pakistan's ambassador to the United States Husain Haqqani revealed on The Daily Show to Jon Stewart that Pakistan's decision to strike a peace deal with Taliban militants earlier, which effectively ceded control of large swathes of the country's northwest, was all part of a cunning plan to fool the Taliban, which is now coming to fruition with the commencement of Operation Black Thunderstorm. The ambassador mentioned to Jon Stewart that President Asif Ali Zardari's signing of the Nizam-e-Adl Regulation, which was the Swat peace deal, was nothing more than a trick to lure the Taliban from the mountains and countryside to the main towns where it would be much easier for the Pakistani military to kill or capture them. > \\"[President Zardari] did something very smart. When he was with President > Obama recently, he explained it. He actually told the American government > that I'm going to do this deal to try and prove to those within Pakistan, > and in Pakistan's state apparatus, who think that these guys can be > negotiated with — I will negotiate with them only to prove that you can't > negotiate with them, because they will break the deal. And as soon as they > broke the deal, the army is back in, the fighting is going on, and you can > see the results.\\" The Swat peace-deal was heavily criticised by Hillary Clinton when she accused Pakistan's government of abdicating to the Taliban in agreeing to impose Islamic law in the Swat valley. However, according to the Pakistani Government, it was simply using \\"reverse psychology,\\" as Jon Stewart phrased it, on the Taliban. Foreign involvement and aftermath Pakistan's foreign office spokesman had confirmed that there was a heavy influx of foreigners aiding the Taliban and that weapons were coming from the adjacent country of Afghanistan. Many Pakistani defence analysts and experts had publicly accused India and Afghanistan of aiding the Taliban to destabilize Pakistan. On May 19, 2009, the Pakistan Army captured three foreign fighters from Mingora District. According to the Pakistani Army, all these foreign fighters were Libyan nationals. The Pakistani Army also captured five Saudi nationals during the search operation. In Khybar Pass, a police raid on a local house resulted in the arrest of 20 Tajik nationals. In heavy fighting in Malakand Division, Pakistani commandos killed five Uzbek fighters. Many Pakistani political parties, such as PML-N, accused India, of providing economic and financial support to the Taliban. According to a White house press release, the United States and NATO were working with Pakistan to find out who's providing the financial support and what routes were they using to smuggle the weapons. According to the Daily Jang's investigative report, a large amount of Afghan National Army's weapons was stolen by the Taliban, and also the report claimed that there is no formal security for their weapons depots. Daily Jang also cited that a large number of Uzbeks and Tajiks were freely crossing Afghanistan's border into Pakistan to fight against Pakistan. The airborne troops standing at the end of the valley. Parliamentarian Khawaja Muhammad Asif of Pakistan Muslim League-N held a press conference in the Parliament media lounge, where he warned Afghan President Hamid Karzai. He said that \\"Karzai became President with the support of Pakistan\\". He also warned him that Afghanistan should not play with Pakistan's security. After the convincing evidence, Pakistan, along with United States and NATO, found out the significant routes that were using to supply heavy weaponry to Talibans. Pakistan blocked the routes successfully. On May 17, M.I. learnt that a large numbers of Taliban fighters with a number of foreign fighters, were presented in Khyber Pass, and possibly, were planning to re-take the Swat from the Army. On May 20, 2009, in Khyber Pass, Pakistan Army sent small teams of Special Service Group (SSG) Commandos, along with small teams of Army Rangers's Ninth Wing Company. As the teams progressed, the Pakistani commandos had confronted a large numbers of foreign fighters with a full-backing support of Taliban militant fighters. The battle was day long and intense fighting ensued. The Black Storks Commandos (Special Service Group) and Ranger's Ninth Wing Company, killed a large number of Taliban and foreign fighters and Taliban leadership had repeatedly suffered heavy human casualties as well as losing a large number of their fighters. The various media reports stated that foreign fighters were Uzbek and Tajik nationals. Pakistani Commandos also recovered a large amount of weaponry in trucks. During the battle, Pakistani special forces also successfully secured NATO's supply-line trucks that were constantly targeted by the Taliban fighters. After a day long battle, Taliban began to flee from the area at night, but while trying to escape, the SSG and the Ranger teams had intercepted their hiding locations. An ambush led by the Pakistani special forces, the SSG and Ranger's Ninth Wing Company, killed large number of the remaining Taliban fighters. After weeks of heavy fighting, the Taliban had suffered heavy losses and lost many key leaders and territories in Swat and Khyber Pass. The final battle concluded as Pakistan Army as victorious and eliminating the major Taliban leadership from the war theater. In this operation Brig. Hussain Abbas also embraced martyrdom, He participated in a rescue mission to bring back the bodies of a heli crash.

Palacios (1905–1993) was a Puerto Rican-American freelance artist and illustrator specializing in book jackets and maps for major U.S. publishers in the mid- and late 20th century. Among the notable maps of his prolific and highly successful career are those in most of Isaac Asimov's history books and in Bruce Catton's Civil War books. Biography Of Spanish- Puerto Rican parentage, Palacios was born in Santo Domingo, capital of the Dominican Republic. When he was five months old his family moved to Puerto Rico. He was educated in the Puerto Rican schools, but as an artist was largely self-taught. In 1928 he did his first fine arts sketches while in San Juan. He made something of a specialty of Afro-Caribbean portraiture. He made a brief visit to the United States in 1931. In 1937 he was chosen, with two others, to represent Puerto Rico at the second annual Exhibition of American Art in New York City. In 1938 he also exhibited at the Delphic Studios in New York, where he presented his first display of Afro-Antillean art (a one-man show of his gouaches). That same year he also exhibited at the first Newspaper Artists' Exhibition in New York, and in several one-man shows at the Athenaeum in San Juan and at the University of Puerto Rico. Beginning in 1938 Palacios worked for American newspapers as an illustrator and translator of comic strips. In the mid-1940s, he shared a studio with several other freelance artists and did a number of covers and endpapers for Bantam Books. His endpapers had a strong cartographic quality and served a similar purpose with Dell Books' mapbacks. In 1948, Palacios was chosen to produce the maps for Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower's memoir, Crusade in Europe. Palacios took over as the cartographer from George Annand for the Rivers of America series in 1956. The last 13 books in the series (1956–74) contain maps by him.

These powers generally only apply to members of public fire and rescue services. Powers are granted to firefighters in England & Wales by virtue of the Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004, in Scotland by virtue of the Fire (Scotland) Act 2005 and in Northern Ireland by virtue of the Fire and Rescue Services (Northern Ireland) Order 2006. Whilst the three acts are almost identical in effect, they word the powers differently and vary in relation to the issuance of warrants. England & WalesIn emergencies= A fire and rescue authority may authorise in writing an employee for the purposes of section 44 of the Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004 (separate from authorisation under section 45 below, which is only granted to some firefighters).Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004, section 44 They may do anything they reasonably believe to be necessary for the purpose of: *extinguishing or preventing the fire or protecting life or property (if they reasonably believe a fire to have broken out or to be about to break out), *rescuing people or protecting them from serious harm (if they reasonably believe a road traffic accident to have occurred), *discharging any function conferred on the fire and rescue authority in relation to the emergency (if they reasonably believe an emergency of another kind to have occurred), or *preventing or limiting damage to property resulting from action taken as mentioned above. An \\"emergency\\" means an event or situation that causes or is likely to cause: Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004, section 58 *one or more individuals to die, be seriously injured or become seriously ill, or *serious harm to the environment (including the life and health of plants and animals). They may also: *enter premises or a place, by force if necessary, without the consent of the owner or occupier of the premises or place, *move or break into a vehicle without the consent of its owner, *close a highway, *stop and regulate traffic, or *restrict the access of persons to premises or a place. A person who without reasonable excuse obstructs or hinders a person employed by a fire and rescue authority while responding to \\"emergency circumstances\\" commits an offence.Emergency Workers (Obstruction) Act 2006, section 1 The maximum punishment is a fine not exceeding level five on the standard scale.Emergency Workers (Obstruction) Act 2006, section 4 \\"Emergency circumstances\\" are those that are present or imminent and: *are causing or are likely to cause: **serious injury to or the serious illness (including mental illness) of a person, **serious harm to the environment (including the life and health of plants and animals), **serious harm to any building or other property, or **a worsening of any such injury, illness or harm, or *are likely to cause the death of a person. =Investigations & carrying out of functions= A fire and rescue authority may authorise in writing an employee for the purposes of section 45 of the Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004 (separate from authorisation under section 44 above, which is granted to all firefighters).Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004, section 45 An authorised officer may at any reasonable time enter premises: *for the purpose of obtaining information needed for the discharge of a fire and rescue authority’s functions under section 7, section 8 or section 9, or *if there has been a fire in the premises, for the purpose of investigating what caused the fire or why it progressed as it did. However, an authorised officer may not: *enter premises by force, or *demand admission as of right to premises occupied as a private dwelling unless 24 hours' notice in writing has first been given to the occupier of the dwelling. An authorised officer may not enter as of right premises in which there has been a fire if the premises are unoccupied, and the premises were occupied as a private dwelling immediately before the fire, unless 24 hours' notice in writing has first been given to the person who was the occupier of the dwelling immediately before the fire. An authorised officer may apply to a justice of the peace if he considers it necessary to enter premises, but he is unable to do so, or considers that he is likely to be unable to do so, otherwise than by force. If on an application a justice is satisfied that it is necessary for the officer to enter the premises, and he is unable to do so, or is likely to be unable to do so, otherwise than by force, he may issue a warrant authorising the officer to enter the premises by force at any reasonable time. An authorised officer may also apply to a justice of the peace if he considers it necessary to enter a dwelling without giving notice as required. If on an application a justice is satisfied that it is necessary for the authorised officer to enter the dwelling without giving notice as required, the justice may issue a warrant authorising the officer to enter the premises at any time (by force if necessary). An authorised officer exercising a power of entry under this section must, if so required, produce evidence of his authorisation, and any warrant, before entering the premises, or at any time before leaving the premises. If an authorised officer exercises a power of entry for the purposes of obtaining information needed for the discharge of a fire and rescue authority’s functions under section 7, 8 or 9, he may take with him any other persons, and any equipment, that he considers necessary, and require any person present on the premises to provide him with any facilities, information, documents or records, or other assistance, that he may reasonably request.Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004, section 46 If an authorised officer exercises a power of entry for the purpose of investigating what caused a fire or why it progressed as it did, he may: *take with him any other persons, and any equipment, that he considers necessary, *inspect and copy any documents or records on the premises or remove them from the premises, *carry out any inspections, measurements and tests in relation to the premises, or to an article or substance found on the premises, that he considers necessary, *take samples of an article or substance found on the premises, but not so as to destroy it or damage it unless it is necessary to do so for the purpose of the investigation, *dismantle an article found on the premises, but not so as to destroy it or damage it unless it is necessary to do so for the purpose of the investigation, *take possession of an article or substance found on the premises and detain it for as long as is necessary for any of these purposes: **to examine it and do anything he has power to do under paragraph (c) or (e), **to ensure that it is not tampered with before his examination of it is completed, **to ensure that it is available for use as evidence in proceedings for an offence relevant to the investigation, *require a person present on the premises to provide him with any facilities, information, documents or records, or other assistance, that he may reasonably request. If an authorised officer takes samples of an article or substance found on the premises he must leave a notice at the premises (either with a responsible person or if that is impracticable fixed in a prominent position) giving particulars of the article or substance and stating that he has taken a sample of it, and if it is practicable to do so, give to a responsible person at the premises a portion of the sample marked in a manner sufficient to identify it. If an authorised officer takes possession of an article or substance found on the premises, he must leave a notice at the premises (either with a responsible person or if that is impracticable fixed in a prominent position) giving particulars of the article or substance and stating that he has taken possession of it. If in the exercise of any power an authorised officer enters premises which are unoccupied, or from which the occupier is temporarily absent, he must on his departure leave the premises as effectively secured against unauthorised entry as he found them. A person commits an offence if without reasonable excuse: *he obstructs the exercise of any power, or *he fails to comply with any requirement,being a person present on the premises, to provide an authorised officer with any facilities, information, documents or records, or other assistance, that he may reasonably request. The maximum punishment is a fine not exceeding level 3 on the standard scale. Enforcement of fire safety legislation In England and Wales Fire Safety Inspectors are given additional powers to firefighters in order to carry out routine inspections, investigate the commission of fire safety related offences and prohibit or restrict the use of un-safe buildings. They also issue other legal notices. Their powers are derived not only from the Fire Rescue Services Act 2004 but also Article 27 of the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005, the Health & Safety at Work Act etc 1974, Fireworks Act 2003, and the Licensing Act 2003 including other pieces of legislation. Upon the granting of a warrant from a Magistrate, Fire Inspectors may use force to make entry into a premises for the purposes of securing evidence, investigating the commission of an offence or to make an inspection. Usually this is done with the Police in attendance. Any persons suspected of committing an offence are ordinarily placed under caution and invited for an interview under PACE conditions. Committing a fire safety-related offence includes summary and indictable offences which means for more serious cases the offender(s) could be sent to prison.

To the south the border runs from Lake Hallstatt up the Gosau Valley to Gschütt Pass, and from there downhill along the Rußbach Valley, separating the Salzkammergut Mountains from the Tennengebirge in the southwest, and the Lammer creek to its confluence with the Salzach near Golling. To the west the boundary runs along the River Salzach from where it is joined by the Lammer down to the city of Salzburg. The highest peak with an elevation of is Mt. Gamsfeld near Gschütt Pass in the south, the only two-thousander of the range. The best-known mountain however is the prominent Schafberg on Wolfgangsee, with access to the summit provided by the Schafberg Railway.

Background  To fully understand this article, one must be familiar with the judicial system of France under the Old Regime, during the 17th and 18th centuries. Though the English word parliament derived from the French word parlement, they were not the same thing. A French parlement was closer to an English superior court of appeals. Just as the English parliament is divided into \\"chambers\\", a French parlement also had several \\"chambers\\". There were over a dozen French parlements throughout the country, the most important of which was in Paris. The highest \\"chamber\\" of the Parlement of Paris was the \\"Great Chamber\\".  Biography The son of a member of the Great Chamber, and a student of Charles Rollin, Antoine Portail rose from an attorney, to an attorney general, to the President of the Mortar (chief justice of the Great Chamber), before becoming a First President (a royal appointed position) of the Parlement of Paris in 1724.Biography from Pierre Larousse's Great Universal Dictionary of the 19th Century, vol.

Such kits often include many resources, such as an educators' guide, a CD-ROM with works of art and primary sources (letters, maps, period photographs), overhead transparencies, posters, curricula, and step-by-step lesson plans. The projects are founded on the belief that art and material culture can be a valuable lens through which to study a historical moment. As N. Elizabeth Schlatter, the author of Museum Careers: A Practical Guide for Students and Novices, explains, the role of museums is to make “a unique contribution to the public by collecting, preserving, and interpreting the things of this world.\\"Schlatter, N. Elizabeth. Museum Careers: A Practical Guide for Students and Novices. Walnut Creek, CA: Left Coast Press, 2008. She goes on to note how the scholar Stephen Weil has said that museums have changed their mission to educating the visitor rather than having a primary mission of object care. Out of this growing trend, Education Departments have become one of the most vital parts of the museum organization. They seek to bring the knowledge of the museum to the community by more public programs and through programs designed to be used in traditional classroom curricula. The Phillips Collection in Washington, DC, USA, is an example of a museum with a strong program of creating teaching kits. Their teaching kits focus on works of art and exhibitions at The Phillips Collection. The education department works with mentor teachers and advisors from schools. As they explain on their website, “arts education is a valuable window on subjects such as history, math, English, English as a second language, and geography.”Teaching kits , Phillips Collection, Washington DC, USA.

Similarly for the 2010 Biennial a family guide is offered ., Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, USA. The US National Endowment for the Humanities has also contributed to this trend with a program called Picturing America, a set of forty, carefully selected works of art spanning several centuries—all by American painters, sculptors, photographers, and architects. NEH Chairman Bruce Cole said, “Picturing America helps us understand our democracy by bringing us face to face with the people, places, and events that have shaped our country. It provides an innovative way to experience America's history through our nation's art.” The NEH program includes a resource book, lesson plans, and large, high quality reproductions of these images.

His assistant Pierre Deniker conducted a test of chlorpromazine on the male mental ward where Delay worked, and the two published their findings (quickly, with what has been called academic gamesmanship) in 1952. Chlorpromazine turned out to be the first effective drug treatment for mental illness and it had a profound effect on the mentally ill and mental asylums. In 1968–1970, student revolutionaries attacked his offices, and Delay was forced into retirement from medicine. In later life, he lived as a writer. Family and education The son of Maurice Delay, a successful surgeon and mayor of Bayonne, at age fourteen Delay earned a baccalaureate in philosophy. He studied medicine in Paris. After studying in hospitals for twenty years, especially the teaching of Pierre Janet and Georges Dumas, he turned to psychiatry. He also specialized in neurology at the Salpetriere. He wrote his doctoral thesis on astereognosis in 1935. He then undertook the study at the Sorbonne and in 1942 wrote his thesis on diseases of memory. He received degrees in medicine, literature, and philosophy. Jean Delay was the father of Florence Delay, of the Académie française (Seat 10), and of :fr:Claude Delay, novelist and psychoanalyst. Career Delay was chair of the department of psychiatry at the Centre hospitalier Sainte-Anne from 1946 to 1970. He received training in the psychiatry clinic of Henri Ey at the :fr:Centre hospitalier Sainte-Anne. There he became the chair of the clinic of mental illness in 1946. He remained at the hospital until 1970 when he retired from medicine. With Ey, Delay organized the First World Congress of Psychiatry and founded the World Psychiatric Association (WPA). Today, the WPA awards a Jean Delay Prize every three years. Delay twice served as president of the WPA (1950 and 1957), and also as president of the French language Congress of Neurology and Psychiatry (1954), the Society Medico-Psychologique (1960), the International Congress of Psychosomatic Medicine (1960), and the Collegium Internationale Neuro-Psychopharmacologicum (CINP) (1966). He was elected to the National Academy of Medicine in 1955. He and the Soviet delegation examined Rudolf Hess during the Nuremberg trials, and found hysterical amnesia but not insanity in the strict sense. During his scientific career, Delay published more than 700 articles and over 40 books. In 1957, he developed with his assistant Pierre Deniker a classification of pharmacological and recreational drugs that was validated by the World Congress of Psychiatry in 1961. Pharmacological and recreational drugs studies Delay pioneered research on drugs including LSD, mescaline, and psilocybin. Delay's name came first on these papers in part because he was the leader of a department with strong hierarchy. Delay's team studied isoniazid (INH) and its effect on depression, around 1952. Delay discovered, jointly with J. M. Harl and Pierre Deniker, who was Delay's co-worker and also a psychiatrist, that chlorpromazine, the first neuroleptic, produced a considerable reduction in the agitation and aggression of those patients with symptoms of schizophrenia.Kandel, E. R. (2007). In Search of Memory. The Emergence of a New Science of Mind. W. W. Norton & Co. See also A review in Spanish about Kandel's book Known first as a \\"ganglio-plegic\\", he first called the drug \\"neuroplégique\\" then finally a \\"neuroleptic\\". Deniker, with Harl and Delay, published the success with chlorpromazine in May 1952. Chlorpromazine reached common use by 1957 worldwide, except in the United States where medications were then still considered less useful than psychodynamic therapy. While this was not his most important scientific contribution, it became the most famous. It was, however, Deniker who shared the prestigious Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award with Henri Laborit (who first recognized the drug's applications in psychiatry) and Heinz Lehmann in 1957. As explained in the American Journal of Psychiatry and elsewhere, no one won a Nobel Prize for the discovery. Student revolution In May 1968, a group of about five hundred revolutionary student followers of Leon Trotsky professing antipsychiatry attacked his offices. The students felt that chemicals were straitjackets and demanded that psychiatry be removed from medicine. Within two years they forced Delay's retirement. He decided to work on literature, which was his first love. Literature A brilliant writer, he was elected to the Académie française in 1959 and wrote remarkable biographical studies on the Youth of André Gide (1956–1957) and his maternal ancestors in the four volumes of Preliminary Memory (1979–1986). His essay Psychiatry and Psychology The Immoraliste earned him the Grand Prix in criticism. He used the pseudonym Jean Faurel from his days at Salpêtrière until sometime before 1959.

Following a 1977 staff photographer stint at the Louisville Courier-Journal, Rose moved back to Southern California to become a staff photographer for the Los Angeles Times. Los Angeles Times It was at the Times that Rose honed his photo skills and developed a style covering a variety of national and worldwide news events, major sports and fashion, with a special emphasis on Hollywood and popular culture. Rose was twice nominated for a Pulitzer Prize while working at the Los Angeles Times, first for his 1979 photographic coverage of the Malibu fires, and also in 1980 for his coverage of the presidential election. National Football League Beginning in 1983, Rose spent 15 years as a photographer for the National Football League, covering regular season, playoff and Super Bowl games. Virtually every weekend was spent shooting at least one Sunday NFL game and, on many occasions, Monday Night Football. Special emphasis was on photographing the Joe Montana and Steve Young eras at the San Francisco 49ers, as well as the Oakland and Los Angeles versions of the Raiders. Rose was member of the elite official NFL Super Bowl photo team, providing game coverage for 13 of his 15 years. Freelance work His freelance photography from 1985-1991 was featured in Rolling Stone, Time, Life, Newsweek, Sports Illustrated, USA Today and the Los Angeles Times. Rose is a recipient of a World Press Award for his aerial photograph of the 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake. Rose's career included other interests as well. From 1983 to 1985, he co-owned and published the Mendocino Grapevine, a general interest weekly newspaper in Mendocino County, California. Wine industry It was during his time in Mendocino County that Rose met members of the Fetzer family, owners of Fetzer Vineyards. In 1991, Rose accepted a public relations position at Fetzer Vineyards in Hopland, California, and spent the next 18 years in the California wine industry. In 1998, he became public relations director for Allied Domecq Wines, USA, parent company of Sonoma County's well-known Clos du Bois winery. The Allied Domecq Wines portfolio also included Cockburn's Port, and French Champagne houses Mumm and Perrier-Joüet. In 2003, he became Vice President of public relations at Kendall-Jackson, America's top premium wine producer. After nearly six years at the Kendall-Jackson helm, Rose left to write, work on several book projects, and consult with smaller wineries on sensible trade and media public relations strategies. In 2008 after a brief break from the wine business, Rose signed on to write a regular column for Dan Berger's Vintage Experiences, a weekly wine trade and consumer newsletter. Rose's occasional essays on wine and other issues of the day have appeared in the Santa Rosa Press Democrat, the Ukiah Daily Journal and the San Francisco Chronicle. From 2009 to 2014, Rose was the Director of Communications for Healdsburg-based J Vineyard & Winery, a Sonoma County producer of sparkling and varietal wines. Photographic archive During his years in the wine industry, Rose expanded his photographic portfolio to include Northern California wine regions as well as major wine & food events. Today, his portfolio is one of the most diverse in the business, and includes 1970s rock and roll legends, 1980s celebrities, scenic California landscapes, NFL action, global travel, as well as food and wine photography. Rose is currently an editorial contributing photographer at Getty Images.http://www.gettyimages.com/photos/george-rose-sonoma- county?family=editorial&phrase;=george%20rose%20sonoma%20county&sort;=best&excludenudity;=true#license Exhibits and book publications Rose's photography has been featured in several exhibits at Mumm Napa's Fine Art Photography Gallery in Rutherford, California, as well as exhibits at the Sonoma County Museum, Mendocino County Museum, The New School of Design in New York, and the Los Angeles Museum of Rock and Roll. In 2018, Rose became an artist-member at Gallery Los Olivos, located in Los Olivos, CA. In addition to his wine industry executive responsibilities, Rose has focused on producing several photo books. The Art of Terroir, published by Chronicle Books in 2007, captures the seasonal changes in California wine country. Hollywood, Beverly Hills & Other Perversities, a snapshot of 1970s pop culture published in 2008 by Ten Speed Press, remains a cult classic among Hollywood celebrity aficionados. In 2017, he published VINEYARD: Sonoma County, a coffee table photographic book on that wine region's sustainable estate vineyards.http://www.pressdemocrat.com/lifestyle/7859766-181/famed- photojournalist-george-roses-new Rose is the 2017 winner of the Louis Roederer International Wine Writer http://www.decanter.com/wine-news/wine-photography- roederer-awards-376971/ award for \\"Best Artistry.\\" He currently resides in Santa Barbara County's Santa Ynez Valley.

The wings of the Mallard could also be adjusted in the air,Flight December 1989 but they were of low aspect ratio with marked forward sweep. The trailing edge carried conventional ailerons near the tips and elevators close to the fuselage. The Mallard was also a tailless aircraft, in the sense of lacking a horizontal tailplane. The rest of the aircraft was conventional, with single fin and rudder and a side-by-side cockpit for two behind a flat four engine. The undercarriage was fixed and of the tailwheel type. Like other Cornelius designs, the sole Mallard was built by the Spartan Aircraft Company. The Mallard first flew on 18 August 1943, flown by Arthur Reitherman, though some sourcesFlight September 2002 suggest that most of the subsequent 18 flights were in the hands of the Romanian aerobatic pilot Alexander Papana. The first public flight was on 7 September 1943. It was reported to have been 700 lb (320 kg) overweight and there were plans to install a more powerful engine. The designer claimed that the Mallard was stall and spin proof, though the later loss of the much larger but similarly configured Cornelius XFG-1 in an irrecoverable spin has cast doubt on this.Flight November 1989 Specifications ReferencesNotesBibliography=  * * Category:1940s United States civil aircraft Mallard Category:Variable- incidence-wing aircraft Category:Forward-swept-wing aircraft Category:Tailless aircraft Category:Single-engined tractor aircraft ","title":"Cornelius Mallard"},{"id":"22813376","text":"Gustáv Slamečka (born 5 June 1959) is a Czech politician of Slovak origin.

It centered on opposition to Reconstruction. During its history, the party was successful in electing six congressmen to the U.S. House of Representatives, all during the 41st Congress. The party was related to similar conservative movements in other states, combining Liberal Republicans and repentant Democrats looking to improve their image as \\"friends of the black people\\" on a national level. The movement was also closely tied to the \\"New Departure\\" movement of Virginia statesman William Mahone. The Conservative Party's efforts ultimately divided the Republican Party in the state and caused its political power in Virginia to diminish. HistoryFoundation= From December 11–12, 1867 a group of former Democrats, former Whigs, and moderate Republicans, led by Alexander Hugh Holmes Stuart held a convention in Richmond, Virginia. Raleigh T. Daniel, the party's first chairman and a former Whig, led the organization of the party throughout the state. Alexander H. H. Stuart would later lead the Committee of Nine to negotiate a compromise with President Ulysses S. Grant and leading members of Congress. The compromise called for a separate vote on former Confederate disfranchisement at the time of the referendum. =Rise= The party won majorities in both houses of the Virginia General Assembly in the 1869 elections and endorsed many moderate Republicans who had run against Radical Republicans. However, despite their opposition to the radical Republicans the party was divided on the issue of black suffrage although most were in agreement on economic issues. Despite the party's divided opinion on black suffrage thirty blacks were elected to assembly and many of them had their views in line with the Conservatives. =Division= In 1869 the Conservative party used its majorities in the assembly to create a free public school system as required by the new state constitution and the next year would segregate all schools in Virginia. Later the assembly voted to sell most of the state's stock in railroad companies, but the low prices that investors paid created suspicions of corruption, and the state treasury received less money than anticipated and voted to pay the large public debt left over from the pre–Civil War years by issuing new bonds with thirty-four-year maturity and six percent annual interest. The Funding Act of 1871 was widely unpopular and created two factions in the party, the Funders and the Readjusters, who would later create their own party, over the debate on whether or not paying the debt was more important than supporting the public schools. A group of conservative members of the Virginia state legislature met in Richmond, Virginia on July 1, 1870 to reorganize the party and submit their recommendations to the Legislatures with respect to congressional redistricting. =Demise= A popular bill that would increase the amount of revenue available to public schools was introduced and passed by the assembly in 1878, but was vetoed by Governor Frederick W. M. Holliday. The Readjusters would break away from the Conservative party and formed their own party and the remaining Conservative Funders lost their majorities in both houses in the same year to the Readjusters. The Readjusters would later win the governorship in 1881 causing the few Conservative bills passed by the assembly to be vetoed by William E. Cameron. In 1883 the party and most of its members merged with the Democratic party. Criticism In 1876, former Virginia Governor Henry A. Wise denounced the party during testimony before the Virginia House of Delegates Committee on Elections, as nothing more than \\"old-fashioned Democrats, old-fashioned Whigs, Know Nothings, locofocos, sour-crout (sic) Democrats, and Greelyites,\\" the latter a reference to Horace Greeley of New York, whose candidacy the Conservative Party endorsed for President of the United States in the 1872 presidential election.

Extending from the foot of the Croix Rousse hill to the confluence of the Rhône and the Saône rivers, it has a preponderance of cafés, restaurants, luxury shops, department stores, banks, government buildings, and cultural institutions. The 1st and 2nd arrondissements of the city (as well as the southern part of the 4th) are located here, along with the Hôtel de Ville (city hall). The spires of the church of St. Nizier, rebuilt from the 14th to the 16th centuries, are at the foot of the former Saône river bridge. Though the business centre is located to the east in the 3rd arrondissement, road signs pointing to the centre of the city take drivers to Place Bellecour in the 2nd. This zone is served by the metro lines , and Place Bellecour History Place Bellecour: equestrian statue of Louis XIV Palais de la Bourse in the Cordeliers district Church of St. Nizier Hôtel-Dieu Théâtre des Célestins Hôtel de ville Bartholdi fountain, Place des Terreaux Musée des Beaux-Arts de Lyon, (Palais Saint-Pierre) Plan of works and buildings on the Presqu'île, 1863 This district was an important counterpoint to the Vieux Lyon district in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Many picturesque streets still exist. Among these is the rue Mercière, where printers and booksellers gravitated in the 15th and 16th centuries and which still has some superb buildings. The Museum of Printing, housed in the former Hôtel de la Couronne, explains how Lyon’s first books were printed. Squares, in many cases decorated with fountains, and churches sprinkled throughout evoke the presence of numerous convents, including those of the Dominicans (Jacobins), the Celestines and the Conventual Franciscans (Cordeliers), whose Saint Bonaventure church was rebuilt in the 14th century. Further south, the church of Saint-Martin d’Ainay in the Ainay area was originally the church of Ainay Abbey, a large Benedictine monastery, and is still a jewel of Romanesque art in Lyon. The Place des Terreaux was created in the 17th century, owing to the construction of two prestigious structures: * The Hôtel de Ville, or City Hall, was built between 1646 and 1655 by the architect Simon Maupin and decorated by the painter Thomas Blanchet. In 1674, the Great Hall was ravaged by fire, and the façade facing the square was redesigned in the early 18th century by Jules Hardouin Mansart. * The Saint Pierre Palace, formerly a royal Benedictine abbey, construction of which began in 1659 by the Avignon architect François de Royers de la Valfenière. It now houses the Museum of Fine Arts. The public garden in the former cloister is decorated with the work of famous sculptors and is a quiet, urban oasis. In the 17th and 18th centuries the Place Bellecour was created in honour of King Louis XIV. Nowadays, the Place des Terreaux hosts several restaurants and an impressive statue of a woman on a chariot, and is a common sightseeing destination within Lyon. Modern times Jacques-Germain Soufflot expanded the hospital located near the old Rhône bridge, building the Hôtel-Dieu along the banks of the river. Today, the hospital is closed. Works are underway to renovate the building, which will host a five star hotel, shops, offices, apartments, and the new Cité de la gastronomie. Numerous hôtels particuliers were built in the vicinity of the Place Bellecour. The Hôtel du Gouverneur, built in 1730, now houses the Musée des Tissus (Museum of Textiles) and the Hôtel de Lacroix Laval, designed by Soufflot, is now the Museum of Decorative Arts. In 1855, during France’s Second Empire period, Claude-Marius Vaïsse, Prefect of the Rhône département, created the rue de la République and the rue Edouard Herriot as part of a series of large construction projects. The Stock Exchange, built in 1860, is an example of the Napoleon III style and is in the heart of the banking district. In the 19th century, two theatres were built: the Célestins Theatre and the Grand Theatre, the latter of which is now the opera house, rebuilt in 1993 by Jean Nouvel. These are two of the city’s major cultural centres.

Part of the Swan Collection, bequest of great-granddaughter Miss Elizabeth Howard Bartol (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston) James Swan (1754 – 31 July 1830) was a colorful personality based in Boston in the 18th and 19th centuries. He was a member of the Sons of Liberty and participated in the Boston Tea Party. Swan was twice wounded at the Battle of Bunker Hill, he next became secretary of the Massachusetts Board of War and the legislature. During the time he held that office, he drew heavily on his private funds to aid the Continental Army, which was then in dire need of funds to arm and equip the soldiers who were arriving in Boston from all parts of New England. After the American Revolution Swan privately assumed the entire United States French debts at a slightly higher interest rate. Swan then resold these debts at a profit on domestic U.S. markets. The United States no longer owed money to foreign governments, although it continued to owe money to private investors both in the United States and in Europe. This allowed the young United States to place itself on a sound financial footing. On principles of loyalty, he spent 22 years—more than a quarter of his life—in the Paris Sainte-Pélagie Prison.

It is believed to come from the Kimberley area of South Africa. Tom Moses, a senior vice president with the Gemological Institute of America, agrees that it came from South Africa, but it has not been able to be determined the mine of origin. Ownership and history Upon the arrest of Ohio businessmen Paul Monea and Mickey Miller, its actual ownership was unclear. The Federal Bureau of Investigation seized the diamond following an undercover investigation of Monea and Miller that resulted in his conviction for money laundering and the diamond's forfeiture to the U.S. government in 2007. Amid Monea and Millers prosecution, 17 claimants came forward in the case to claim ownership, or an ownership interest, in the Golden Eye Diamond (Akron Federal Court Case No. 5:07CR0030). The Court ruled that three claimants had colorable ownership claims and would be allowed to proceed to civil trial: Charity Fellowship Church, Jerry DeLeo of Corona Clay Corp., and The Monea Family Trust. The court found that the Church and Jerry DeLeo had spent nearly $1,000,000 to cut and develop the 124.5 carat gem. Monea and his trust were never able to establish ownership or purchase of the rough stone, although extensive evidence was presented of the diamond's origins with newspaper articles and researched records. The uncontested evidence showed that the Golden Eye Diamond had been obtained from the VanWyke family of Kimberly South Africa most recently, and that the stone had been held by the family for some 150-years. The original VanWyke was neighbor to the De Beers, and discovered the 124.5 carat paragon on his property in the DuToit's Pan Mine, in Kimberly South Africa, in 1871. This evidence has never been disproven, and for over 150-years no other diamond on earth was thought to be the original DuToit II Diamond (the first African diamond found over 100-carats). The diamond was ultimately approved to be auctioned by a federal judge. The court also found that, although people had ownership claim, Monea's conspiracy to sell the diamond existed - somehow - before Monea even owned the diamond. Its sale was planned tentatively in January 2011, but after a delay it was announced it will be sold via online auction in September 2011, with a minimum bid of $900,000. The Diamond is currently owned by Jerre Hentosh after he won it via online auction on Bid4Assets with a winning bid of $2.84 million.

Between hubs the wagons are hauled by Nahgüterzüge (Ng), i.e. local goods trains, or Durchgangsgüterzüge (through goods trains).

They were known for their weekly television program shown on Canal+ Belgique, and various disks. Their humour was mostly inspired by self-mockery and nonsense, much like the British comedy troupe Monty Python, and hijacking national symbols of Belgium and belgitudes (frites, chicons, Maurice Béjart, Jacques Brel, Gilles de Binche etc.). Les Snuls were famous for their guest presenters, mostly old ladies who didn't know they were part of a spoof, also not knowing their lines or the topics of the show. Additional commentaries, generally rude or mocking, were also added to the program. Ex: the presenter :\\"until next week,\\" to which they add : \\"Yeh, without you!\\" They also produced the film, Film Belge. The duo Jannin-Liberski have since produced various television series (such as J'aime autant de t'ouvrir les yeux, Twin fliks), disks and advertisements.

The character first appeared in Jackpot Comics #5 (cover dated Spring 1942). He received his own self-titled ongoing comic book series in 1950 which ran on and off until September 1980. A second series began publication in December 2016, being set in Archie Comics New Riverdale universe with a new character design aesthetic and a more mature story format and scripting, aimed for older, contemporary teenage and young adult readers. Even the printed comic book format is different from the previous publications. Publication history Reggie first appeared briefly in Jackpot Comics #5 before making a full appearance in #6 (both 1942). He proved to be a perfect foil and rival to Archie Andrews and eventually was given his own series, Archie's Rival, Reggie. The series ran for 14 issues between 1950 and 1954. It was revived with the same numbering in September 1963, but the title was reduced to Reggie for issues 15 through 18. It was then changed to Reggie and Me beginning with issue 19, and retained that title through its cancellation in September 1980 at issue 126. The first issue of Archie's Rival, Reggie was reprinted, along with Reggie's first appearance (in Jackpot Comics #5 (Spring 1942)), in Archie's Pals 'n' Gals Double Digest #133. During this publication period a second series, Reggie's Wise Guy Jokes, ran for 60 issues between August 1968 and January 1982. A three issue miniseries titled Reggie's Revenge was published quarterly in 1994 after Reggie and Me had ended. On September 20, 2016 it was announced that a reboot of Reggie and Me would be published as part of Archie Comics' New Riverdale lineup.

The controversy was contemporary with the time that corsets were popular in society. Corsets, variously called a pair of bodys or stays, were worn by European women from the late 16th century onward, changing their form as fashions changed. In spite of radical change to fashion geographically and temporally, the corset or some derivative beneath an outer gown would shape the body or provide structure. There were brief periods in which corsetry was not part of mainstream fashion. In the 1790s, there was an abrupt change to fashion as the Empire silhouette became fashionable. During the following Regency era the highly supportive corsets of the early Georgian era were dismissed in favor of short garments worn primarily to support the breast and leave the waist and hips in their natural shape.Jenkins, David (ed.), The Cambridge History of Western Textiles, Cambridge University Press, September 2003, p. 903\\"Tight Lacing, or Fashion before Ease\\" Beginning in the mid-1820s, women's fashion returned to the full skirts of the prior century. In a repudiation of the Empire silhouette, the waist became the central focus of female dress. The corset assumed the dominant role it would hold for the rest of the 19th century. Designed to emphasize the waist through minimizing it, corsets would constrict the waistline in order to achieve a slender silhouette.Ewing, Elizabeth, Dress and Undress, A History of Women's Underwear, London 1978 Doctors and much of the press deplored the garment in spite of continued use.The Lancet, Volume 94, Issue 2400, 28 August 1869, \\"The Waist of the Period\\" Criticism Evening dress, 1838 Wearing corsets has been subject to criticism since the era of tight lacing during the prior century. Jean-Jacques Rousseau denounced the practice in The LancetRousseau, Jean Jacques. \\"On Tight Lacing\\" The Lancet, 9, 1785, pp. 1202–3 while cartoons of the period satirized the practice. However, by the 19th century, women were writing letters to publications expressing their views directly and articulately. The one-sided denunciation of the past turned into a dialogue. Women made their voices heard, sharing their experiences and their opinions, some in favor of the corset and even tight lacing, and some in disfavor of the restrictive garment. Newspapers and popular journals became the media for the exchange of hundreds of letters and articles concerning the corset. Known as the \\"corset controversy\\" or simply the \\"corset question\\", the controversy spilled over multiple publications, countries and decades. Of particular concern was the issue of tight lacing. The flow of articles and letters waxed and waned over time, reaching a crescendo in the late 1860s, which may be taken to be the peak of the frenzy. However, the issue surfaced long before and continued long afterward. Throughout this period, advertisements in the same publications promoted the sale of corsets with enthusiasm.Wikimedia Commons, Category: Corset advertisementsChanging form of the corsetIn the United Kingdom, publications in which the controversy raged included The Times, Lancet, Queen, The Scotsman, Ladies Treasury, The Englishwomen's Domestic Magazine, and All the Year Round. In the United States, the Chicago Tribune commented that English journalists discussed both sides of the controversy \\"with very great fervor and very little common sense,\\" though it published its own contributions.\\"The Corset Question\\". Chicago Tribune (14 November 1869) Other American newspapers and periodicals also participated, including The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Boston Globe, the Hartford Daily Courant, the North American Review, and The Saint Paul Daily Globe. Other parts of the English-speaking world joined from time to time, reprinting articles from England and America, as well as contributing their own. Even provincial newspapers such as the Amador Ledger of California, the Hobart Town Courier, the Otago Witness, and the Timaru Herald of New Zealand had their say. \\"A cutting wind, or the fatal effects of tight-lacing\\", a satirical cartoon from around 1820 The line between wearing corsets in general and tight lacing in particular was never drawn precisely. Many detractors denounced both, obviating the distinction, while many advocates endorsed both. Additionally, many women who wore corsets denied that they tight-laced, adding confusion to the controversy. The West Coast Times wrote that \\"consequences of tight lacing are universally admitted,\\" yet ladies' denial persisted. They preferred to claim that their small waist was \\"a gift of Nature\\" and that they wear a corset for \\"comfortable, if not necessary support.\\" \\"The Pinch of Fashion\\", West Coast Times, (4 August 1884) p. 3 Corsets and fashion Fashionable dress, late 19th century The dominant aesthetic of the mid- nineteenth century called for full skirts. Prior to the common wearing of the crinoline, several petticoats would be worn in order to provide this fullness. A corset, used to constrict the waist and create slenderness, could also accentuate a full skirt through comparison. The Saint Paul Daily Globe wrote of corsetry:\\"Corsets for Belles\\" The Saint Paul Daily Globe (2 February 1890) There were countless denunciations. Fashions that required a tiny waist were deemed oppressive. One such appeared in the Chicago Tribune\\"The Slaves of Fashion\\" Chicago Tribune (5 September 1891) Yet some women professed to enjoy the practice. A letter to the Boston Globe reads \\"Believes in Tight Lacing\\" Boston Globe (26 January 1893) A reader wrote to The Toronto Daily Mail insisting that only those who had experienced tight lacing could understand its pleasures\\"The Proof of the Pudding\\" Toronto Daily Mail (5 May 1883) p. 5 Edwardian corset The editor of the \\"Women's Chats\\" section of the West Australian advocated \\"tight lacing in moderation\\" \\"Women's Chats\\" The West Australian (5 November 1896), p. 3 A corsetiere described how women might attain the desired waist size\\"Women Must All Tighten Up\\" Chicago Daily Tribune (29 December 1907) Medical criticism Doctors railed against the practice as decidedly harmful. Some women replied that tight lacing was actually beneficial as well as enjoyable, while other women responded to the critiques with wholehearted agreement, sometimes citing their own negative experiences. The following exchange, which took place during ten days in 1869 in the pages of The Times of London, gives a flavor of the discourse that volleyed back and forth for decades. The exchange was initiated by a note in the British medical journal, The Lancet, which was reprinted in The Times of London. Backlaced corset A reader signing herself \\"Not a Girl of the Period\\" wrote a letter to The Times in reply\\"The Waist of the Period\\" The Times, 2 September 1869 A reader, signing herself, Anti-Slavery countered The Lancet felt compelled to reply as well, expanding on its medical arguments Other readers wrote to extol the virtues of tight lacing The distinguished anatomist William Henry Flower in 1881 published a book Fashion In Deformity As Illustrated In The Customs Of Barbarous & Civilised Races By William Henry Flower, Ll.D.

This did not prevent his wife and four daughters from wearing them. Mothers and daughters Corset advertisement, 1886 It was expected that women would wear corsets and it was part of a mother's duty to her female offspring to have them wear the garment.Summers, Leigh, Bound to Please: A History of the Victorian Corset, Berg, 2003, chapter 3 Just how and when might depend on the mother, the daughter, the place, and the time. However, some things were much the same everywhere. Three examples, one from the American frontier of 1880, another from London in 1907, and a third from 1883 are variations on the theme. Laura Ingalls Wilder was an American author who wrote a series of children's books based on her childhood in a pioneer family. Little Town on the Prairie is set in 1880 in South Dakota in an area recently settled. Despite being on the frontier, the women and, in particular the girls, were expected to behave according to the norms of the times. Its 1941 publication date takes it out of the \\"discussion\\" period, but as it was written as a children's book for girls, its account is unlikely to be spurious or a fantasy, so it serves as a reliable testament of some of the more curious practices such as sleeping in corsets. The family had four daughters, Mary, Laura, Carrie, and Grace, the youngest. Mary, the eldest, tries on a dress that is found not to fit until her corset is laced more tightly, leading to the following exchange:Wilder, Laura Ingalls, Little Town on the Prairie, (HarperCollins reprint 2004), p. 93 Readers wrote to The Gentlewoman describing personal experiences with tight lacing. For example,\\"The Sin and Scandal of Tight Lacing\\" The Gentlewoman, 1883 In publishing this and other letters, the editor of The Gentlewoman admonished the writers: There was no shortage of others who condemned mothers and daughters who participated in the practice. For example:\\"The Victims of Vanity\\" The New York Times, (2 April 1893) Childhood Advertisement, 1883 In some cases, mothers started their daughters wearing corsets in early childhood. The New York Times described the practice in its Fashion section.\\"The Fashions for Summer\\" New York Times\\", (26 June 1881) An account from a young lady reads: Mothers wrote letters describing their version of the practice. The following, published in the English periodical Queen,Queen, London is typical. Advertisement, \\"Corset, de 8 à 13 ans\\" Another letter, in the Boston Globe,\\"Corsets and Such, A Devotee of the Corset\\" Boston Globe (8 January 1888) is similar: Teenage years Mothers typically put their daughters into serious corsets in their teens or sometimes in the pre-teens. Some were uncertain as to when and how to begin tight lacing. They sought advice in their local newspapers, giving rise to heated discussions. One such exchange took place in the pages of the Toronto Daily Mail, from April to June 1883, in the Saturday section, \\"Women's Kingdom\\". A reader signing herself, \\"Corset\\", inquired: \\"Women's Kingdom\\" Toronto Daily Mail (7 April 1883) p. 5 The next Saturday, \\"Staylace\\" offered her experience: Girl's corset A few weeks later, \\"Staylace\\" submitted excerpts from her niece's diary from the prior year. Girls would seek relief from their stays at night and mothers would seek to prevent it. One reader, signing herself \\"Mother\\", wrote \\"Kingston\\" offered her remedy: \\"Common Sense\\" offered her own alternative: Other readers took strong exception to these extreme measures. One expressed her indignation, while describing her own daughter's wearing corsets from the age of eleven, but in the 'daytime only': Another objected entirely to corsets until the very end of the teens: Other newspapers carried similar accounts. In fashionable London, tight lacing of teen aged daughters was a serious affair. The New York Times wrote:\\"Tiny Waist Craze Seizes on London; Revival of the Fashion of Tight Lacing\\". The New York Times (15 September 1907) right School In fashionable society, a girl was expected to have a suitably small waist. Girls' schools were preparation for society and some headmistresses treated that attainment as part of the girls' schooling. As the girl was not yet an adult, her opinion was not considered. A reader wrote to the editors of The Science of Health describing her experience.\\"Voices of the People\\" The Science of Health, Vol. III – July to December 1873. p. 245 The West Australian printed excerpts from the diary of a school girl describing how figure training was accomplished.\\"Figure Training at a Fashionable Boarding School\\", The West Australian (2 November 1895) p. 10. How I shall be able to eat and move about I can’t think; but Madge O—, who left last term, and who was that size, said you feel awfully smart, and, in fact rather a pleasant sensation when you get used to the pulling in. Ball Gown circa 1896 Three letters form a thread that illustrates the volleying back and forth.Lord, William Berry, The Corset and The Crinoline, Ward, Lock and Tyler, London, 1868, pp. 172-7 The first was written by a mother, surprised that the school acted on its own. The daughter herself continued the account. Rather than deplore the practice, her remarkable conclusion was that tight lacing should be started at an early age. Léoty, Le Corset à travers les âges, Paris, 1893 A woman signing herself as a schoolmistress defended the practice as an \\"elegant article of dress\\". Her solution agreed with that of the young lady, commencing the practice at an early age. One young lady looked back upon the practice with affection.Waugh, Norah. Corsets and Crinolines New York: Theater Arts Books, 1954, p. 141 Today, one might read these accounts with skepticism, but contemporary advertisements describe corsets as small as 15 inches. \\"Small waist sizes 15 to 23 inches\\" That tight-lacing was enjoyable is a recurring theme. For example: Toronto Daily Mail (21 April 1883) p. 5 Others were proud of their training and saw it as the source of a fine accomplishment; However, other young ladies recalled the practice with little fondness.\\"Wasp Waist Contests\\" Amador Ledger (21 July 1911) Marriage There are many articles admonishing girls to abjure the custom of tight lacing and assuring them that no man they would want to marry had any interest in small waists. Typical of these is:\\"Deviations from Nature\\" Hobart Town Courier (10 February 1837) Princess Maud at her wedding Mary of Teck shortly before her wedding, 1893 Another, entitled \\"The Absurdity of the Custom as Well as the Effect upon the Health of Slaves to the Fashion\\", begins:\\"Tight Lacing\\" Hartford Daily Courant (1 November 1884) Other articles suggested more dire consequences. A \\"Doctor Lewis\\" wrote \\"The Health of the American Woman\\" North American Review (1 December 1882) Whatever the doctors might say, young ladies laced down in preparation for their wedding, as evidenced by contemporary photographs. Moreover, some women laced down after their marriage to please husbands who fancied the practice. One such wife wrote:\\"Foolish Fashions\\" All the Year Round (27 June 1868) These, with the assistance of my maid, I put on, and managed the first day to lace my waist in to eighteen inches. \\"Préparatifs de départ\\" A ladies maid recounted a similar situation:\\"Ladies Gossip\\" Otago Witness (14 November 1889) She is tall, about 5 ft. 8 in, and well made, so you can imagine what a business it is pulling her in to 17 in; but she has a splendid figure when she is dressed. \\"Il soutient les faibles et contient les forts\\" A husband who fancied the practice wrote:\\"Women's Kingdom, Reply to Indignant Father\\" Toronto Daily Mail (9 June 1883) p. 5 Fashion establishments Girls working in \\"fashion establishments\\", as they were then called, wore corsets to suit the dictates of their employers. Tiny waists were required of employees to sell the then current fashions, much as size zero models are frequently used in fashion shows today.\\"London Fashion Week refuses to ban 'size 0' models from catwalk\\" The Independent (26 January 2007) The editor of \\"The Ladies Page\\" of The Western Mail wrote\\"The Ladies Page Western Mail (12 June 1896) : In a large establishment in the West End of London the standard is 19 inches, and any assistant who does not reach those dimensions within six months of her engagement is discharged. The person in charge of the girls' figures at this shop gave as her experience that out of every 100 girls she found three could not lace at all, six laced with difficulty, eight eventually gave up, ten endured the bondage, seventy really enjoyed it, and three laced excessively. At the time of admission, out of a hundred girls, three had 24 in. waists, six had 23 in., 18 had 22 in., 45 had 21 in., and two had 19 in. At the end of six months, by \\"judicious lacing,\\" whatever that may mean, the figures were – 21 in. two; 20 in. six; 19 in. seventy five; 18 in. eleven; 17 in four; 16 in. two. Fashion establishments were much the same in Paris: \\"Experiences of a Paris Dressmakers Model\\" Star (24 October 1903) p. 3 : ... some five and a half years ago the following advertisement caught my eye in the “Wanted” columns of a high-class ladies’ newspaper, I at once answered it. It ran as follows: — : 'WANTED, at once, a young lady, pretty, tall (good figure essential), as “model” in a showroom of a well-known Paris couturiere. A slight knowledge of French desirable. Apply, with full particulars as to height, etc., and recent photograph, etc.' : It had become necessary, owing to the death of my father, for me to do what my relatives with whom I went to live called “something.” In reply to my letter I was asked to call at an hotel, and after an interview with the principal proprietor and his forewoman, who was a bright and clever Parisian, I was engaged at a very good salary. : A little less than a week later saw me at my post. I soon found that I was to be treated very much in the light of a good-looking, animated automaton. I was told that, though my figure was superb, my waist—which, as it measured about 20in, I had considered reasonably small—was too large, and that consequently, ere I was fitted for the dresses which were to be supplied for my wear, I must visit Léoty and obtain a couple of corsets which would reduce my waist to a trifle less than 18in. This I did, the firm defraying the cost, and I must confess that, though the waist-forming process was not pleasant at first, I was not a little proud of what was referred to as my beautiful figure. Nearly all the hands in the various ateliers and showrooms tight-laced. One girl, a pretty American who was much admired by customers and their male escorts, measured less than 17in over her dress. Several were barely sixteen, and it was to this latter size that I was told I should ultimately be required to reduce myself. I very soon got accustomed to the tight-lacing, and became as anxious as my employers that I should possess a fine figure, which the beautifully, though plainly, made dresses with which X—et Cie. supplied me showed off to perfection. : Within a year of my coming to Paris I possessed the 16in waist desired by my employers, and was admittedly the finest figure in the showroom, in which I was chief model. Amongst our clientele, which comprised many of the smartest, richest and most beautiful women in the French capital, and also many smart Americans, there were, many who openly envied me my good looks, and—from a fashionable point of view—superb figure. The practice was described by a shopgirl:\\"English Corset Models\\" Chicago Daily Tribune (23 September 1908) : When I first accepted my situation, my waist was twenty inches. My mistress informed me that I would have to lace for the benefit of her customers and that I also must agree to sleep in her house. : When I was ready to retire on the first night, mistress came and took my corsets away, and next morning she brought me a pair which were only 18 inches. She made me put them on and said that she would lace them in herself. I did as she told me and I had to stand with the other girls employed in the establishment while she laced me in. I did not like it at first, standing in a row with my hair hanging down, waiting for the mistress to come and lace me in, but of course I soon got used to it as all the other girls had to do. I was never allowed to dress myself until the mistress had laced me in ... : One morning, I was sent for and found that three other girls besides myself had been called. We learned that we were to wear 16 inch corsets. At first I rebelled, but the mistress coaxed me ... When night came, I was glad, for I though I would be able to take the corsets off. Judge of my dismay when the mistress informed me that I would have to sleep in these corsets. Next morning as we stood in line, she measured our waist and told us we would have to continue sleeping in these corsets. Once a week, she said that we could be allowed to take them off. At last the time came for us to take them off and what a relief that was. In a short time, however, they were put back on again and laced in smaller than ever. ... At last, though, I got so that the sixteen inch corset would lace up tight and I knew I was a successful model. ... : Now I am proud of myself. Mistress has gotten me so that my waist is only fifteen inches. My corsets, too, are well laced together. Everybody admires my little waist ... I am not sorry that I am a model as after all I have gone through I am well looked after my mistress, and if she were to ask me to put on smaller corsets, I would do so. Various writers condemned the practice, for example:\\"Ladies' Gossip\\" Otago Witness (2 May 1895) p. 46 : Now there is one practice which is painfully common among all classes, and that is the use of the \\"locked corset\\". This is practically a steel corset, with a waist varying from about 14in to 16in. Into this the growing girl is compressed by force, the corset is shut tight and secured by a lock, the key being kept by the mother or whoever is responsible for the proceeding. : It may be observed here that it is the usual practice for the heads of \\"trying on\\" departments in large dress-making and mantle-making establishments to require all girls engaged in \\"trying on\\" to enter one of these corsets, which is locked, and the key kept by the head. In the case of the growing girl, the object is to prevent the waist from growing as the rest of the body develops, and the idea is really only worthy of Chinese cruelty. : In the case of the shop girl, the object is to \\"preserve\\" the figure precisely at the exact amount of compression which is supposed to I show off ladies' garments to the best advantage. In any case, the girl is confined in this way by the middle, night and day. She has to sleep in her \\"little ease\\" if she can, and the torture is such that at first even the shopgirl, worn out with the fatigues of the day, can hardly sleep for the pain. : Probably nothing can be done until all women are sufficiently sensible, to realize that there is no beauty in a wasp's waist, that the majority of men do not really care a bit about it, and that there is real danger in tight-lacing, but surely the dreadful events which have happened lately ought to do something to emancipate schoolgirls and debutantes from their perpetual imprisonment in locked corsets. Elder women who compress on their own account are responsible for their own folly, but something ought to be done to put an end to this form of girl-torture. Another wrote:\\"Tight Lacing by Clerks in London\\" Chicago Daily Tribune (3 November 1907) : Girls in the more fashionable London stores make the most amazing statements in reference to dress regulations. They are compelled to compress their waists to a wasp-line slimness to show off the \\"creations\\" to the best advantage. : The girls are expected to be living fashion plates,\\" says the editor of a London trade paper. \\"They must have all the elegance of willowy style and lissome, grace of figure, without which they are no good in the service. : The editor above referred to a letter from a girl in one of the most fashionable stores, and she makes this alarming statement: \\"The girls are laced up till they are nearly cut in two. Locked corsets are used, the key being kept by the manageress, and the corsets being worn night and day.\\" : In reply to a letter of remonstrance, the firm stated that it had certain regulations in regard to dress and other matters, and that no girl ever objected in the least to tight lacing. One such shop girl certainly had her objections:\\"News and Notes\\" Evening Post (September 1899) p. 3 : It is only two months ago that my employer insisted upon my reducing my waist from 16in to 14in, on the ground that she must have a model to show the newest fashions on. How could I refuse? I know many girls who would lace their waist till they fainted to get a good situation. And so to please these ladies, I am locked day and night into a vise which hardly allows me to breathe. The dress reform movement Corset 1878 Afternoon dress circa 1894 : See also: Dress reform movement Advocates of dress reform deplored the impractical and restrictive fashions of the time. The bloomer dress was a mid-century attempt at rational clothing for women. It attracted considerable ridicule in the press and relatively few adopters. Other attempts at dress reform fared no better. Various dress reformers turned to the printing press. In 1873, Elizabeth Stuart Phelps Ward wrote: Louisa May Alcott devoted Chapter 18 (\\"Fashion and Physiology\\") of her 1875 young adult fiction, Eight Cousins, to advocating for dress reform in the form of the \\"freedom suit,\\" which is described as being different from and more socially acceptable than bloomers. The young main character, Rose Campbell, is under the guardianship of her physician uncle Alec. However, her aunt Clara wishes Rose to dress appropriately to her position as an heiress, and one day gives her a fashionable outfit to try. Rose ultimately rejects it in favor of Alec's freedom suit, consisting of close-fitting pantaloons and shirt under a long- skirted petticoat and dress. Earlier in the novel, Rose had been wearing a tight belt to keep her waist small, which Alec insisted she stop doing for the sake of her health (Chapter 5, \\"A Belt and a Box\\"). When Clara tries to convince her to wear a corset, Alec is furious. : He closed the door with a shrug, but before anyone could speak, his quick eye fell upon an object which caused him to frown, and demand in an indignant tone, \\"After all I have said, were you really going to tempt my girl with those abominable things?\\" : \\"I thought we put them away when she wouldn't wear them,\\" murmured Mrs. Clara, whisking a little pair of corsets out of sight with guilty haste. \\"I only brought them to try, for Rose is growing stout, and will have no figure if it is not attended to soon,\\" she added, with an air of calm conviction that roused the Doctor still more, for this was one of his especial abominations. : \\"Growing stout! Yes, thank Heaven, she is, and shall continue to do it, for Nature knows how to mold a woman better than any corset-maker, and I won't have her interfered with. My dear Clara, have you lost your senses that you can for a moment dream of putting a growing girl into an instrument of torture like this?\\" and with a sudden gesture he plucked forth the offending corsets from under the sofa cushion, and held them out with the expression one would wear on beholding the thumbscrews or the rack of ancient times. : \\"Don't be absurd, Alec. There is no torture about it, for tight lacing is out of fashion, and we have nice, sensible things nowadays. Everyone wears them; even babies have stiffened waists to support their weak little backs,\\" began Mrs. Clara, rushing to the defense of the pet delusion of most women. : \\"I know it, and so the poor little souls have weak backs all their days, as their mothers had before them. It is vain to argue the matter, and I won't try, but I wish to state, once for all, that if I ever see a pair of corsets near Rose, I'll put them in the fire, and you may send the bill to me.\\" But dress reform had little mainstream impact. Fashion continued to emphasize the waist and, so long as it did, the corset continued to be regarded as an indispensable of dress. An unusually perceptive reformer described the situation in an address to the National Christian League in 1895. Her speech was reported in The New York Times:\\"Women's Slavery to Fashion\\" The New York Times (23 February 1894) :: WOMEN'S SLAVERY TO FASHION – She Admires Ideal Garments but will not Wear Them : Mrs. Margaret Stanton Lawrence ... told of the artist who spent years in inventing a dress for woman that would be at once comfortable, convenient, and beautiful. Success crowned his efforts, but alas! who would invent the woman to wear this ideal garment! The dress was delightful, all women admitted, and filled every requirement, but – alas again for them! their husbands would not walk in the streets with the wearers of such a garb, their fashionable friends begged to be spared the visits of such unconventional creatures, and the clergymen in the churches asked that their congregations be not disturbed by thoughts of a woman's dress. It seemed that change would be glacially slow at best. A year later, The New York Times wrote:\\"For the Liberated Woman\\" The New York Times (20 May 1894) :: FOR THE LIBERATED WOMEN; THOSE VALIANT ONES WHO WILL GIVE UP THE BINDING CORSET. More and More Women Are Doffing Their Stays – But It Still Takes High Courage to Join Their Ranks. : The receipt of several letters asking The Times to give some designs suitable for making up gowns to be worn without corsets has suggested the article here presented. The leaven is working among women: Many have discarded them, many more, mothers, who feel that it is too late for them to change, are persuading their growing daughters to omit their adoption. ... Human nature is weak, very weak, when it comes to the question of personal appearance, and having for generations adopted the standard of a tapering waist as a mark of feminine beauty of figure, it is going to take character, perseverance, religion even to counteract this. ... : \\"One of the most pathetic speeches that I have listened to in a long time\\", said a woman recently, \\"was that made by a friend to me the other day. We were discussing hygienic dress and the use of disuse of corsets. I remarked casually and tritely that it took a good deal of moral courage to give them up. 'Moral courage!' she repeated, 'it takes wrestling with the Lord. There is no plea I have made oftener of my Heavenly Father than that He would give me strength to persevere in this thing'\\". End of the controversy Hobble skirt circa 1912 From 1908 to 1914, the fashionable narrow-hipped and narrow-skirted silhouette necessitated the lengthening of the corset at its lower edge. A new type of corset covered the thighs and changed the position of the hip, making the waist appear higher and wider. The new fashion was considered uncomfortable, cumbersome, and furthermore required the use of strips of elastic fabric. The development of rubberized elastic materials in 1911 helped the girdle replace the corset. This was the huge turnaround for the history of waist trainer. The corset controversy changed in the early 20th century when the world of fashion circled back to styles reminiscent of the Empire silhouette. Fashionable dress was fluid and soft, with flowing lines. What rational dress reform was unable to accomplish in decades of rhetoric, the wheel of changing fashion brought about almost overnight. The waist became unimportant and the waist-restricting corset lost its significance. Paul Poiret was a leader in this movement. He replaced the corset with the hobble skirt,\\"Waistless Gowns Are Again Exploited by Poiret\\" The New York Times (15 October 1911) which, while equally restrictive, was different and thus readily adopted in an era eager for change.Ewing, Elizabeth, Dress and Undress, A History of Women's Underwear, London 1978, p.113 In his autobiography, Poiret wrotePoiret, Paul, My first fifty years, Gollancz, 1931, p. 73 : It was in the name of Liberty that I proclaimed the fall of the corset and the adoption of the brassiere, which since then, has won the day. Yes, I freed the bust, but I shackled the legs. The hobble skirt lasted but a few years, but its adoption marked the beginning of the end. Other designers such as Madeleine Vionnet, Mariano Fortuny, and Coco Chanel soon followed with simple comfortable fashions that freed the entire woman. With their adoption into mainstream fashion, the corset controversy receded into a historical curiosity. \\"Ladies' Corsets in All the Latest Models\\" See also *History of corsets *Hourglass corset *Tightlacing *Victorian dress reform *Victorian fashion *Wasp waist *Swedish Dress Reform Society ReferencesExternal links *That Waist - Photo editing at the turn of the century Category:19th-century fashion Category:Corsetry Category:Fashion Category:History of clothing (Western fashion) Category:Clothing controversies ","title":"Corset controversy"},{"id":"22813979","text":"Steelhead may refer to: *Rainbow trout, fish also known as steelhead trout Places *Steelhead, California (disambiguation) **Steelhead, Humboldt County, California **Steelhead, Siskiyou County, California *Steelhead Beach Regional Park, in California *Steelhead Provincial Park, in British Columbia People * Albert Steelhead (b 1858), native of Sweden, became a pioneer photographer in Chewelah, Washington Other uses *Nexus Q, an Android media streaming device codenamed Steelhead *Steelhead, a WAN appliance from Riverbed Technology ","title":"Steelhead (disambiguation)"},{"id":"22813988","text":"Stone is a populated place in Humboldt County, California.

The Zimbabwe national team, commonly known as the Sables, have been playing international rugby since the early 1900s and have made appearances in two Rugby World Cups Zimbabwe at the Rugby World Cup on two occasions. As with rugby union in Namibia, the country's lack of a professional structure, and opportunity for player's to earn an income playing rugby, has been a problem for national organisers.Bath p79 Governing body The Rhodesian Rugby Football Union was founded in 1895. History Zimbabwe was formerly known as Rhodesia, and this name change reflects the complex history of the country. Not unlike other neighbouring African countries, Zimbabwean rugby has been a legacy of British colonialism. This has created big problems, particularly as it has been dominated by a white settler class, and has not achieved the kind of racial integration that it should have done. Attempts to increase participation amongst the black population continue, with mixed results. The government of Ian Smith encouraged this split, and actions by his successor, Robert Mugabe have helped drive away many of the white people who were the mainstay of the land. From 1952, Rhodesian/Zimbabwean rugby was split into two subregions, centred on the two main cities, Harare (formerly \\"Salisbury\\" in the north) and Bulawayo in the south. For a number of years, Rhodesia competed as a province in the B division of South Africa's Currie Cup. This relationship with South African rugby was an unhealthy one, as South Africa would frequently take the best players for its Springboks, and even coaches such as Ian McIntosh who coached the South Africa side in 1993. Because of the boycott of the racist apartheid regime in South Africa, Zimbabwe was the only African side to be invited to the 1987 Rugby World Cup. It managed to requalify for the 1991 Rugby World Cup, but has not been in the tournament subsequently. Côte d'Ivoire (The Ivory Coast) slipped past them, Namibia, and the third African favourite, Morocco in the qualifiers for the 1995 Rugby World Cup.Richards, Chapter 13 Resisting the Inevitable, p 237 Côte d'Ivoire went into the World Cup optimistic, with coach Claude Ezoua saying: :\\"We want to prove to the world that there is more to African rugby than just South Africa.\\" Despite Namibia and Zimbabwe having qualified for the RWC at different times, both of these countries were firmly within the South African orbit, had players who spoke English and/or Afrikaans, who were mostly white. Namibia had previously been a colony of South Africa, as South West Africa, and Zimbabwe had provided SA with a number of players such as Ray Mordt.Bath p69 The Côte d'Ivoire was not even in existence when the first (invitation only) Rugby World Cup was played in 1987, and had in fact played their first international in 1990 against Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe competes in the Africa Cup and plays regularly against teams in neighbouring countries, as well as South African teams. Notable players Because of the complex racial problems of Zimbabwe/Rhodesia and South Africa, most of the best-known players in the past were white. However, there has been a growing number of notable black Zimbabwean players such as Richard Tsimba and his younger brother Kennedy Tsimba, Bedford Chibima, Honeywell Nguruve, Tendai Mtawarira, Brian Mujati, Takudzwa Ngwenya and Tonderai Chavhanga. The Tsimba brothers were inducted together to the IRB Hall of Fame in 2012. Other notable Zimbabwean/Rhodesian players include: * Salty du Rand, lock, who played for Northern Transvaal, and captained the Springboks. He was capped 21 times for South Africa between 1949–56. He lived and played in Rhodesia for many years.Jones, p109 * Andy McDonald * Ray Mordt, winger, described by Danie Craven as \\"a wounded rhinoceros in the body of a man\\" played for Rhodesia and South Africa. He later went on to play rugby league. * Ian Robertson, winger/fullback who played for Rhodesia and South Africa. * Adrian Garvey, prop/hooker who played for Zimbabwe, and South Africa during their longest winning streak of 1997-98 and their Tri-Nations Championship victory of 1998. * Tendai Mtawarira, aka \\"the Beast\\", prop, plays for the Sharks, is South Adrica’s most capped prop, and has played twice for the Barbarians. * Brian Mujati, prop, Northampton Saints and South Africa. * Takudzwa Ngwenya, wing, currently plays for the USA and Biarritz. One of the candidates for the unofficial title of \\"fastest player in modern rugby\\"—at least until the 2012 emergence of United States Sevens player Carlin Isles—he moved to the USA at high school age. * Tonderai Chavhanga, winger, another former candidate for \\"fastest player in modern rugby\\", Stormers and South Africa. * RA van Schoor. * Bobby Skinstad, flanker/number 8, was born in Bulawayo, played for the Stormers and South Africa, captaining the Springboks in 2003. * Gary Teichmann, number 8, born in Gweru, played for the Sharks and captained South Africa during their longest winning streak in 1997-98 and their Tri-Nations Championship victory of 1998. * David Curtis * David Pocock, back-rower for Australia and Western Force, emigrated with his family from Zimbabwe when he was 14. * Anthony Henniker- Gotley, former England captain, lived in Rhodesia, and played for police there. * David Denton, plays flanker/No8 for Scotland. * Thom Evans, fullback/winger, capped 10 times by Scotland. * Piet Greyling grew up on a tobacco farm in Mashonaland before representing Rhodesia, the Free State, Northern Transvaal, Transvaal, and South Africa at flank. British Lions tours The British Lions toured South Africa a number of times. Despite officially being South African tours, the Lions also played Rhodesia (as it was then). Later tours of the region were stopped until the 1990s, due to the controversy over playing Ian Smith's regime, and apartheid era South Africa. * 1910 British Lions tour to South Africa * 1924 British Lions tour to South Africa * 1938 British Lions tour to South Africa * 1955 British Lions tour to South Africa * 1968 British Lions tour to South Africa * 1974 British Lions tour to South Africa See also * Zimbabwe national rugby union team * Zimbabwe at the Rugby World Cup  External links  * Zimbabwe Rugby * Zimbabwe at IRB * RWC 2007 Fixtures / Results * Zimbabwe and Rhodesian Rugby jerseys * Senegal sanctioned for misconduct.

Family tree Andreas Untersberger was the eighth son of a wood carver from Upper Austria, who made altars and other religious and liturgical objects. He was the brother of Josef August Untersberger (1864–1933), who had gained some fame in the 1920s as a sculptor and painter of religious images under the pseudonym \\"Giovanni.\\" Career Andreas Untersberger first worked under his father. At the age of 16 he was assisting him in the building of an altar in Knittelfeld; Josef Untersberger worked in the Neo-Romanic style. He distinguished himself in a local art exhibit in Austria; began work in Munich, Germany, in various workshops; and was noted as having painted three paintings in Odrovice, modern day Czech. By the turn of the century, Jugendstil became all the rage, and the church no longer gave out big assignments. Josef Untersberger gave up the family business, and his son Andreas moved to Vienna. From 1895 to 1899 Untersberger studied at the University of Applied Arts Vienna, where he presumably became schooled in the style of the Jugendstil. From 1901 to 1905 he traveled back and forth between Munich and Vienna, until he settled for good in Munich in 1905. He joined artists' societies, locally in Munich and nationally in Berlin, and garnered good reviews of his work, including some non-religious paintings which were on exhibition in the Glasspalast. In 1932, his work was part of the exhibition in the Deutsches Museum. Religious art In the first two decades of the twentieth century Untersberger illustrated many children's books, many of them religious, including books used in Catholic education.Such as Joseph Tratzmüller, Erdmütterlein ruft!, (Ludwig Auer, 1926); Ambros Zürcher, Gottesdienst und Gottesmenschen: Lehr- und Andachtsbücher für die Jugend und das katholische Volk zur Einführung in das Verständnis der katholischen Liturgie und in das katholische Leben (Benziger, 1926); and Joseph Tratzmüller, Als Jesus ein Kindlein war: Ein buntes Bilderbuch für die lieben Kleinen (2nd edition; Missionsverlag, 1927). In the last decades of his life he worked almost exclusively for Ars Sacra, a German publishing company, where he illustrated children's books and religious material according to very strict guidelines. He made more than 400 illustrations for holy cards, which, until the press was secularized in 1980, were reprinted again and again. Presumably it was Liane Müller, the director of the press, who suggested Untersberger use the pseudonym \\"A. Juenger,\\" in order to avoid confusion between Andreas and his older brother, who had a reputation of producing \\"kitsch.\\" It appears that in the last years of his life his work went exclusively to Ars Sacra in the last years of his life, since after the Gleichschaltung religious art became more and more suppressed.

Biography Pauley was born in New Canaan, Connecticut on October 17, 1923. During World War II, he served for three years in the United States Merchant Marine, attaining the rank of Lieutenant. Following the conclusion of his military service, he married Barbara Anne Cotton of Pound Ridge, NY, and attended Harvard Business School.Stelter, Brian. \\"Robert Pauley, Former Head of ABC Radio, Dies at 85\\", The New York Times, May 13, 2009. Accessed May 15, 2009. =Radio= He worked for a local radio station selling advertising and later worked in that capacity at both the CBS Radio and NBC Radio networks in New York. He was hired by ABC Radio in 1958 as a salesman, and was shortly appointed Eastern Sales Director. After dramatically improving ABC's sales performance, and proposing a plan for revival of the network to the ABC/Paramount corporate leadership, he was named as Vice President of the Radio Network in 1960, and President one year later. ABC was last in the ratings among the four radio networks and the industry was facing dire competition from television.Shepard, Robert R. \\"ROBERT R. PAULEY HEADS A.B.C. RADIO; New Network President Is 1 of 3 Officials Promoted\\", The New York Times, September 27, 1961. Accessed May 15, 2009. Upon his appointment, Pauley undertook a national tour of ABC's affiliate stations, created an affiliate advisory board (ABC's first), and revamped ABC's public service, sports, entertainment and news product including heavyweight championship boxing and Notre Dame football. ABC's exclusive coverage of the 1964 Cassius Clay versus Sonny Liston bout drew an estimated 75 million radio listeners, a record. Pauley hired Howard Cosell in 1959, a then-little-known sports announcer who had offered a proposal for a weekly radio program. Pauley tried to rebuff Cosell by telling him that the network had no money to create a show but that he'd air the program if Cosell could get a sponsor, which Pauley assumed he would be unable to do. Cosell found a shirt company owned by a relative as a sponsor and Pauley followed thorough on his commitment, adding a show aired variously as Speaking of Sports, which was broadcast on the network for 30 years. Pauley believed that radio's intimacy would always attract listeners and advertisers, and was able to increase advertising sales and add 100 stations to ABC's network. By 1967, ABC was the number one radio network with a more than 50% market share. He was forced out of his position in 1967 for reasons never made clear to him, but probably based on a decision to restructure the radio network under a system of group vice presidents (despite the fact that the network's income in the previous quarter had been its best ever).Gould, Jack. \\"A.B.C. Plans a Sweeping Change in Radio Format\\", The New York Times, August 25, 1967. Accessed May 15, 2009. =Television= After leaving ABC, Pauley developed a plan to establish a fourth television network to offer news-only services to local stations nationwide. After one failed attempt, Independent Broadcasting, he created Television News Inc. (TVN) in 1973, with the goal of competing with the big three networks by offering an objective, bias-free product. TVN was financed by Joseph Coors. Roger Ailes, who later created Fox News Channel was an employee. The network was terminated in 1975 when funding from Coors was withdrawn. Pauley went on teach business and journalism at the University of South Carolina-Spartanburg, where he founded its journalism department as well as its first course in business ethics. He served there as a Distinguished Professor for 15 years. He died at age 85 on May 2, 2009 in New Haven, Connecticut due to heart and lung failure. His wife, Barbara, died in April 2014. He is survived by his three sons and a daughter.

He was the first person with a disability appointed to the President's Council on Fitness, Sports, and Nutrition, and remains the only person to serve two consecutive terms under different administrations, first under President George H. W. Bush, and later reappointed by President Bill Clinton.President Announces Appointment of 14 Members to the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports. White House Press Release, May 24, 1994. Early life and education The youngest of three boys, Saunders was born to Donald and Freda Saunders, who owned a farm in north central Kansas. He enjoyed sports from an early age, and by middle school and high school, he was involved with football, basketball, track and baseball. Saunders attended college on athletic scholarships for football, track and field, and soccer. He transferred to Kansas State University, majoring in agricultural economics. While at KSU, he joined the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity and continued to play sports until graduating from the university in 1978. At graduation in 1974, Saunders met U.S. Senator Bob Dole, a fellow Kansan, who spoke at the commencement exercises for Downs High School. Twenty six years later, Dole would play a pivotal role in introducing Saunders to President George H. W. Bush, and recommending him for the President's Council on Fitness, Sports & Nutrition. Saunders attended college on athletic scholarships for football, track and field, and soccer. He transferred to Kansas State University, majoring in agricultural economics. While at KSU, he joined the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity and continued to play sports until graduating from the university in 1978. Kansas State University lists Saunders as a member of its Acclaimed Alumni in sports. Explosion and recovery After graduating from college, Saunders began training to become a federal inspector for the USDA. An accident in April 1981, at a grain elevator in Corpus Christi, Texas, wounded him severely, and left him in a wheelchair, paralyzed from the chest down. After graduating from college, Saunders became a federal inspector for the USDA. As an inspector, Saunders was responsible for checking export grain elevators at major ports. His work assignments included locations throughout the Gulf Coast region, and all along the eastern seaboard, from Florida to Nova Scotia. Corpus Christi Public Grain Elevator explosion On April 7, 1981, at the age of 23, Saunders identified and reported safety hazards at the Corpus Christi Public Grain Elevator, in Corpus Christi, Texas. He submitted recommendations outlining a temporary shutdown of the facility, and necessary repairs to resolve problems with the failing dust collection system. Management representatives met with the head engineer and declined to act on the inspection report, opting instead to continue normal operations. The next day, on April 7, an employee disregarded basic safety precautions during a routine Phostoxin pesticide application, triggering a spark in one of the silos with abnormally heavy grain dust concentrations. The suspended grain dust particles instantly ignited, producing a series of powerful explosions that ripped through the facility at a speed calculated by experts at Texas A&M; University to be in excess of 1,082 ft per second. The grain elevator's silos (14-stories tall, 40 ft in diameter with reinforced walls up to 3 ft thick) were destroyed in seconds. There was massive loss of life as many grain elevator employees were either killed by the blast instantly or succumbed to fatal injuries in the moments that followed. Many others suffered severe, life-altering injuries requiring extended hospitalization. Saunders was in the USDA government building when the largest explosion struck. Having heard the sudden blasts erupting just yards away, his last recollection of the event is that “the walls blew out in my face. The crackling and popping of the concrete being blown apart was so loud it felt like it was going to split my head wide open.” He was instantly knocked unconscious and was blown through the roof of the building. Paramedics found Saunders over 300 ft away, a crumpled mass lying in a pool of blood on a concrete parking lot. Saunders’ injuries were so severe that he was “black-flagged” and not expected to survive. Because all ambulances on the scene were occupied by other survivors, Saunders was placed into a station wagon and driven to Corpus Christi Memorial Hospital. His injuries included a fractured skull, collapsed lungs, shattered scapulas, various internal and external injuries and a severed spine at (T5). His body was broken over at the chest like most people bend at the waist when they bend to touch their toes. Doctors gave him less than 1% chance of survival. As the explosion garnered national news coverage, doctors worked to first stabilize Saunders’ condition, and then to begin treating some of the injuries. He would spend nearly a year in the hospital and in rehabilitation, before being released in a wheelchair, completely paralyzed from the chest down. Saunders faced a difficult transition to life as a paraplegic, experiencing bouts of depression and emotional distress. Saunders credits former rugby teammates and workout partners, Robert Hays and Bruce Acuna, with forcing him to get back into the gym where he began strength training. Athletic career Kevin Saunders in the Olympic/Paralympic Village prepares for the 1992 Barcelona Paralympic Games. In 1983 (two years after his injury) Saunders, who had moved to Greenville, South Carolina, was persuaded by his brother Gerald to try entering his first wheelchair race, the Peachtree Road Race held in Atlanta, Georgia, every year on July 4. Though untrained in the discipline and lacking proper material, he participated, and this led to his entering competitions, finding success at the regional, and then national levels. In 1983 (two years after his injury) Saunders was persuaded by his brother Gerald to try entering his first wheelchair race, the Peachtree Road Race held in Atlanta, Georgia, every year on July 4. Saunders signed up, though he had only participated in wheelchair basketball and had never trained for a wheelchair race. About the experience, Saunders has said, “I didn’t even know how long the course was. I could understand distance in miles, but didn’t have a point of reference for how far one kilometer was, let alone 10K.”. He also lacked the proper equipment, lining up at the start in a standard-issue hospital wheelchair unsuitable for racing. During the race he was unable to maintain pace with other competitors and was eventually disqualified once he was passed by the leading foot runners. Despite the early setback, however, he enjoyed this new sport and made a decision that he would become a better wheelchair athlete. He joined a wheelchair basketball league, and continued to enter racing competitions, finding success at the regional, and then national levels. In 1984, Saunders won the bronze medal in the National Wheelchair Athletic Association's Track and Field competition in Johnson City, Tennessee. He would go on to win hundreds of medals in both domestic and international competitions. Saunders won many gold, silver and bronze medals at the National USA Games, Paralympic Games, Pan American Games, and at various World Track & Field Competitions around the world. He was recognized as the Outstanding Male Athlete at the National and International Games on several occasions. Saunders has also won many road races throughout the United States and in other countries. He has been a multiple national record holder, Pan American record holder, world record holder and Paralympic Games record holder. Saunders won every race he competed in at the National Wheelchair Games, including distances from 100m to 5,000m. He also won field events including javelin, discus, swimming, air rifles and pistols, earning Best Athlete of the Games honors on several occasions. After winning the World Track & Field Championships in England in 1989, Saunders was declared \\"The World's Greatest All-Around Wheelchair Athlete\\".[1] At the 1992 Paralympic Games Trials in Salt Lake City, Utah, Saunders broke the pentathlon world record, simultaneously setting a new Paralympic record. Saunders‘ athletic career as an elite wheelchair athlete spanned from 1984 to 2014, when he won the USA Track & Field (USATF) Half Marathon Championship in Houston, Texas. Throughout his career, Saunders was a member of the National Wheelchair Athletic Association (NWAA), Wheelchair Sports, USA, and Wheelchair & Ambulatory Sports, USA, now known as Adaptive Sports USA. Adaptive Sports USA is a registered multi-sport organization of the United States Olympic Committee/United States Paralympic Committee, dedicated to promoting healthy lifestyles by implementing sports and recreation opportunities for children and adults with a physical disability. In 2016, Saunders was inducted into the Hall of Fame, recognized for his outstanding achievements as a multiple World & International Champion, multiple Paralympic medalist, multiple Pan American Games medalist and World and Paralympic record holder. =President's Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition= Kevin Saunders holding recognition plaque alongside PCFSN Chairman Arnold Schwarzenegger. In 1989, Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole nominated Saunders to serve on the President's Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition (PCFSN). After meeting with President George H. W. Bush, Saunders became the first person with a disability to serve on the council, working alongside Chairman Arnold Schwarzenegger and other notable health and fitness experts. Saunders was one of just 20 individuals chosen to serve on the PCFSN during the Bush Administration (1989-1993). While in Washington, DC to meet with President Bush, Saunders unexpectedly met with Rev. Billy Graham at the White House. Rev. Graham served as spiritual counsel to the president, and the two men spent an hour talking and in prayer. Saunders attributes that conversation with Graham as pivotal in helping strengthen his Faith and his desire to help others through philanthropy and his speaking work. In 1994, Saunders became the only person to be reappointed to the council by President Bill Clinton. He served on the council until 2000. Under President George W. Bush, Kevin was named to a Commission by the PCFSN and the US Department of Health and Human Services to come up with a plan to improve fitness and health for people with disabilities. He was also commended for his help in the creation of the National Initiative on Physical Fitness for Children and Youth with Disabilities, or the I Can Do It, You Can Do It Program. Saunders continued to promote health and fitness after the PCFSN, serving as an International Ambassador for Health, Fitness and Proper Nutrition. In that capacity, Saunders met with government leaders at the city, state and national level in numerous European countries.  Business career  Saunders became a motivational speaker and consultant in 1984, shortly after winning the bronze medal at the USATF Championships in Johnson City, Tennessee. In 1989, Saunders worked alongside Tom Cruise and Oliver Stone as a principal actor during the filming of Born on the Fourth of July.

Early life McDonald was born in Leechkentium (), Glen Coe, on the south shore of Loch Leven, in Appin, then located in the county of Argyll, Scotland, the last of 13 children born to parents Angus and Mary (née Rankin). His paternal grandfather, Iain (or John) McDonald, had been one of the few male survivors of the Massacre of Glencoe. The Red River Colony As a young man, McDonald became friends with Lord Selkirk, and joined the Red River Colony as a clerk and agent, in part because he could act as an interpreter between the overseers of the colony, who spoke English, and the settlers, who, like him, were native Gaelic- speakers. He assisted in recruitment of the second group of colonists in Scotland, with the intention of departing for the New World with them in 1812. McDonald was delayed, however, under Lord Selkirk's orders, to receive further training in medicine and related subjects. In June 1813, McDonald left Scotland with a group of emigrants, arriving on the Red River one year later. In the winter of 1814–15, he was made deputy governor under Miles Macdonell. In 1820, he joined the HBC, and after the merger with the North West Company in 1821, was sent out to the Columbia River. Hudson's Bay Company In 1828, he and Governor George Simpson traveled together from York Factory to the Columbia. In the same year, he was promoted to chief trader and put in charge of Fort Langley, near the modern city of Vancouver, British Columbia. He held that post until 1833, when he was reassigned to Fort Nisqually. In 1835, he was assigned to Fort Colvile, where he was chief trader from 1833 to 1841, and chief factor until 1844. In 1848, he retired to St. Andrew's East, Canada East, on a homestead he named \\"Glencoe House\\" after his birthplace. It was here that he died in 1853. Personal life In 1823, Archibald married Princess Raven (also known as Princess Sunday), daughter of Chief Comcomly of the Chinook Confederacy, but she died in 1824 giving birth to their son, Ranald. In 1825, Archibald married Jane Klyne, a daughter of Michel Klyne, French Canadian postmaster at Jasper House, and Suzanne Lafrance, of a prominent Métis family. They had thirteen children, and remained together until Archibald's death. Watson, Bruce McIntyre.

A single-engine monoplane with a fixed undercarriage, although only two examples were built, they were both used operationally, carrying out land- based reconnaissance missions during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Development In 1935, the Nakajima Aircraft Company submitted a design to meet an Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service requirement for a carrier based- reconnaissance aircraft. The design, designated Type S by Nakajima, had a great deal in common with the Nakajima B5N torpedo-bomber that was being developed in parallel. The Type S was a low-winged single-engined monoplane of all metal construction, with upward folding wings for ease of stowage aboard carriers. Unlike the B5N its undercarriage was of fixed tailwheel type with spatted main wheels. Power was by the same Nakajima Hikari radial engine used by early B5Ns. A crew of three were accommodated under a long canopy, with a single 7.7 mm machine gun operated by a gunner and a second fixed forward- firing gun aimed by the pilot.Mikesh and Abe 1990, p.236. The first of two prototypes was completed in October 1936. After testing and completing carrier qualification, the type was officially adopted as the Type 97 Carrier Reconnaissance Aircraft, with the short designation of C3N-1. No production followed, however, as the B5N was considered adequate in the reconnaissance role. Operational history The two C3N-1s were sent to China for tactical evaluation in 1937, during the early months of the Second Sino-Japanese War, being used operationally for land based reconnaissance missions in the Hankou and Shanghai regions.

History Formed in 1947 as a small organisation in the name of \\"City Improvement Trust\\" in order to cater to the housing needs of Madras City, the trust has developed into a full-fledged organisation named the \\"Tamil Nadu Housing Board\\" in 1961 to cope with the increasing demand in housing sector all over the state due to urban growth leading to migration to urban areas in search of employment opportunities. It is under the control of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Activities TNHB has the unique capacity of developing very large neighbourhood schemes, each one of them, remains a self-contained neighbourhood by itself. As a pioneer institution in developing very large neighbourhood schemes, Tamil Nadu Housing Board is one of the biggest institutions in India catering to the shelter needs of various income groups of the society. Keeping in line with the Chief Minister's direction of good governance and effective delivery system, the TNHB decided to put in place the concept of Service Counters. TNHB has created self-sustaining townships in the late 1970s and early 1980s like Anna Nagar, Besant Nagar, K. K. Nagar, Ashok Nagar, Korattur and Shastri Nagar. Owing to the elevation in economic activity to the south of Chennai, it has created self-sustaining township in Sholinganallur with wide roads, residential plots, apartments, school and park zones. It has also completed midsize neighbourhood developments in Velachery, Mogappair and Chitlapakkam. Other promotions are also seen as small and mid-sized neighbourhoods in tier-II cities like Coimbatore and Madurai. All residential township developments of TNHB have been a success due to their compliance to the development rules and their not- for-profit motive. As the land required for TNHB layouts are either owned or acquired by the government, they do not cut corners in layout developments which results in suburbs with wide roads and all amenities such as schools, parks, play grounds and bus terminuses. The organisation caters to all sectors of the society through their HIG, MIG and LIG offerings.

Out of different types of worms, Trichuris vulpis is one of the smaller worms with a size ranging from 30–50 mm in length. As the name suggests, the worm has a whip-like shape with distinct features including a small, narrow anterior head, which is the digestive part of the worm, and a larger posterior tail, which is the reproductive part of the worm. Eggs from T. vulpis are oval shaped with bipolar plugs and contain a thick outer shell. Their sizes range from 72–90 μm in length and 32–40 μm in width.http://www.cliniciansbrief.com/uploads/docs/supplements/2008/september/whipworm.pdf Because of their thick outer shell, T. vulpis eggs are very resistant to environmental extremes such as freezing or hot temperatures, thus allowing for their long viability in the outside world.http://www.cliniciansbrief.com/uploads/docs/supplements/2008/september/whipworm.pdf Life cycle Egg of T. vulpis The life cycle of Trichuris vulpis begins with the adult whipworms living in the large intestines of dogs. T. vulpis lay many eggs in the large intestine and are released in the feces into the outside environment. When eggs are released into the outside environment, these unembryonated eggs are able to form embryos in the soil in about 2–4 weeks, at which point they become infective when ingested by the new host. An infective larva develops within the egg before it is even ingested by the new host.http://www.cliniciansbrief.com/uploads/docs/supplements/2008/september/whipworm.pdf Another canine becomes a new host by ingesting the egg containing the larva. Once ingested, the egg invade the cells of the Crypts of Leiberkuhn in the colon. The J3 larvae grow and molt while burrowing in the epithelium toward the luminal surface.Roberts, L. S., and J. Janovy. 2009. Foundations of Parasitology, 8th Ed. McGraw-Hill Higher Education, Boston, MA. 701 pp. These worms can invade intestinal cells in many places, but there is no evidence that worms can develop to maturity except in the cells of the colon, or that worms develop in the duodenum and migrate to the colon.Bundy, D. A. P., and E. S. Cooper. 1989. Trichuris and trichuriasis in humans. In J. R. Baker and R. muller (Eds.), Advances in parasitology 28. London: Academic Press, pp. 107-173. Once an adult, their posterior end enlarges (the 'handle of a whip') and bursts into the lumen of the colon. The whip-like anterior end remains in the cells of the large intestinal walls. Adult whipworms live inside the cecum, colon, and rectum for about three months before they lay eggs intermittently to be released in feces where they can become infective to another host.http://www.cliniciansbrief.com/uploads/docs/supplements/2008/september/whipworm.pdf Epidemiology T. vulpis infects canines worldwide. In the United States, it has been reported that 14.3% of shelter dogs are infected with this parasite.http://www.cliniciansbrief.com/uploads/docs/supplements/2008/september/whipworm.pdf Older dogs normally have a higher infection of these worms than younger dogs.Taylor, M. A., R. L. Coop, and R. L. Wall. Veterinary Parasitology. Oxford: Blackwell Publishing, 2007. Print. Though rare, there are some cases of human infection. The eggs of T. vulpis are prevalent in shady moist soil areas that have been contaminated by canine feces. Pathology/symptoms Because the eggs of T. vulpis eggs are very resistant from desiccation, they can live in soil for up to seven years.http://www.cliniciansbrief.com/uploads/docs/supplements/2008/september/whipworm.pdf Once ingested by the canine, the eggs hatch and the resulted larvae live in the small intestine. At this point, though infected, the canine is still asymptomatic. When adult form, T. vulpis live primarily in the cecum with its anterior end attached to the superficial mucosa and its posterior end extended to the cecal lumen where it consumes the canine's blood, tissue fluid, and mucosal epithelium. Results of eosinophilia and hypoproteinemia may be found in clinical hematology.Fox, James G., Lynn C. Anderson, Franklin M. Loew, and Fred W. Quimby. Laboratory Animal Medicine. San Diego: Academic Press, 2002. Print. Severe infections include symptoms such as bloody diarrhea, weight loss, dehydration, and anemia, and in extreme cases, death. In the rare cases that T. vulpis infects humans, it can cause visceral larva migrans (VLM) which presents as eosinophilia, hepatomegaly, and pulmonary symptoms.Sakano, T., K. Hamamoto, Y. Kobayashi, Y. Sakata, M. Tsuji, and T. Usui. “Visceral larva migrans caused by Trichuris vulpis.” Archives of Disease in Childhood 55 (1980): 631-633. More cases of VLM have been documented in children with the diagnosis based on the larger size of the eggs found in stool samples.Hall, J.E. and B. Sonnenberg. \\"An Apparent Case of Human Infection with the Whipworm of Dogs, Trichuris vulpis (Froelich, 1789).\\" The Journal of Parasitology 42 (1956): 197-199. However, cases have been documented in adults as well.Masuda, Yashuhisa, Takumi Kishimoto, Ito Hisao, and Moriyasu Tsuji. “Visceral larva migrans caused by Trichuris vulpis presenting as a pulmonary mass.” Thorax 42 (1987): 990-991. Diagnosis Infection of this parasite can be confirmed with detection of eggs in the canine's feces. Adult T. vulpis females can produce more than 2,000 eggs per day. These eggs can be detected in the canine's feces by the fecal flotation method. This method utilizes the differences of specific gravity of eggs, fecal debris, and the flotation solution.S. Katagiri. and T.C.G. Oliveira-Sequeira. Comparison of three concentration methods for the recovery of canine intestinal parasites from stool samples. Experimental Parasitology 126 Issue 2, 214-216 (2010) Although these eggs are dense, the use of proper fecal flotation technique using a sugar solution and centrifugation can increase the chances of identifying these eggs in a fecal sample. Multiple fecal samples may need to be tested as the eggs may be shed periodically. Treatment Infection of this parasite can be treated with several drugs including febantel, fenbendazole, milbemycin, moxidectin (topical), and oxantel. Dogs require re-treatment monthly for 3 treatments due to the long prepatent period of this parasite. There are also monthly preventive treatments that can be used. These are usually one of the above drugs combined with a heartworm prevention drug. Removing fecal material that contains the Trichuris eggs is very important in preventing recurrence. Merck Veterinary Manual  Prevention and control  Keeping canines away from contaminated areas, especially areas where there are feces can prevent them from contracting T. vulpis. There is no effective way to kill the parasite's eggs in the soil, so it is might be necessary to replace the soil and cleaning out litter boxes and kennels frequently. People cleaning these areas should wear gloves and wash their hands after the task. Dogs should have fecal examinations and deworming as necessary. If a dog is detected to be infected with T. vulpis, it should be treated immediately to prevent infection of other dogs. Their feces should also be cleaned up immediately in order to prevent the eggs from getting into the soil which could lead to the infection of others.

It was founded in 1999 by hypnotherapist Paratpar Guru (Dr) Jayant Balaji Athavale. Persons owing allegiance to Sanatan Sanstha have been arrested in four bombings in Vashi, Thane, Panvel (all in 2007) and Goa (in 2009) and in the murders of Narendra Dabholkar (in 2013), Govind Pansare and M. M. Kalburgi (both in 2015). This has led to calls for Sanatan Sanstha to be banned. However, Such claims are ruled out by Maharashtra Minister of State for Home, Karnataka CID, Goa chief minister and Central Home Ministry. In 2015, Minister of state for home for Government of India informed in Rajya Sabha that, no links could be found among the murders of Narendra Dabholkar, Govind Pansare and M. M. Kalburgi and there was no proposal to ban Sanatan Sanstha. Dabholkar's family claims the link between the three murders and requesting court to club the cases. However, Central Bureau of Investigation have informed High Court that it is waiting for the ballistic report from Scotland Yard to link all three cases. In 2018, explosives and firearms were seized from a Sanatan Sanstha worker's house in Maharashtra and 4 persons were arrested on charges of terrorism. Alleged criminal activitiesPanvel, Thane and Vashi bomb blast=Allegations In 2008, six persons owing allegiance to Sanatan Sanstha were arrested for planting bombs in auditoriums at Thane and Vashi and in a movie theater at Panvel. In 2011, two of the accused were found guilty and sentenced to ten years incarceration. Ramesh Gadkari and Vikram Bhave were acquitted of the terror charges under the stringent UAPA, however, the state government's appeal against the removal of UAPA is still pending in the High Court. The Maharashtra government has sought to ban the organization, and has pressed the case for a ban to the central government as well. A central government investigation of the group was ongoing. On 2 December 2015, the Minister of Home Affairs stated in the upper house (Rajya Sabha) that there was no proposal to ban Sanatan Sanstha. The organization's public image was sullied by allegations of involvement in unlawful activities. Hence it started a series of public meetings in different cities in Maharashtra to dispel what it called \\"misunderstandings\\". Convictions On 30 August 2011, Ramesh Gadkari and Vikram Bhave were convicted in sessions court of the Thane blasts and sentenced to ten years rigorous imprisonment. Judgment of trial court was further challenged in the Bombay (Mumbai) High Court and on 2 May 2013 that court ordered the release of the accused on bail while awaiting hearing. =Goa blast= Six members of the Sanstha arrested in the Goa blast case under UAPA were acquitted by the special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court for want of evidence, while UAPA remains in force against three Sanstha members who are absconding. Two men were declared absconders by the NIA, with a red corner notice issued against one man. Acquittal of six members of Sanatn Sanstha by NIA special court was also confirmed by Bombay High Court (HC) bench in Goa. While passing the order HC observed that, “Merely because the accused persons may have links with Sanatan Sanstha and Sanatan Sanstha was opposed to holding of Narkasur effigy competitions, is by no means sufficient to establish the accused persons had conspired to make explosion at such competition on the fateful night of 16th October, 2009.” =Govind Pansare murder= A member of the Sanatan Sanstha was arrested for the murder of Govind Pansare. The Special Investigation Team investigating the murder, arrested Sanstha member Sameer Gaikwad and was on the lookout for another member Rudra Patil, who is absconding since the 2009 Goa blast. The prosecution stated in court that Sameer Gaikwad was in different city (Thane) around the time of the murder of Govind Pansare. Minister of Home Affairs Ranjit Patil claimed that the arrest of Sameer Gaikwad was based only on suspicion, and that the only proof is a cellphone conversation about killing Pansare. Eventually, it was revealed that the evidence against Gaikwad is strong, as he was present at the scene of the crime, and he had discussed the murder with other Sanatan Sanstha members. Sanatan Sanstha was also planning to create a 15,000-strong armed force. =Narendra Dabholkar murder= Indian investigative agencies believe that the Sanatan Sanstha is implicated in the murder of Narendra Dabholkar. In June 2016, a member of Hindu Janjagruti Samiti (HJS), an offshoot of Sanatan Sanstha, was arrested in connection with the murder. An official of the CBI revealed that emails exchanged between him and his underground colleague, from 2008 to 2013, discuss procurement of weapons and establishment of a weapon- manufacturing unit. =Gauri Lankesh murder= Sanatan Sanstha members were suspected of involvement in the murder of Gauri Lankesh in 2017. Forensic analysis has shown that the same pistol was used to kill Kalburgi, and is also possibly the same gun that was used to kill Narendra Dabholkar and Govind Pansare. Sanstha was implicated in all these murders. However, a representative for Sanatan Sanstha denied involvement in the murder.https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/who-killed-gauri-lankesh- with-tragic-murder-family-split-once-more/story-hKUUxAtnqB0FlJKS5pmUAK.html The article also says that the Karnataka police are investigating if the Gauri Lankesh murder has any connection to three previous murders attributed to the Sanstha. =Hypnosis= Public interest litigations were filed in the Bombay High Court seeking a ban on the organisation, stating that it uses Ericksonian hypnosis to lure people into joining it and to carry out acts of violence. Such claims are rejected by Hamid Dabholkar, son of slain rationalist Narendra Dabholkar, saying that hypnotism could not provoke a person to cause violence and instead pointing at radicalization as the means of influence. = Explosives haul = In August 2018, Maharashtra Anti Terror Squad (ATS) had recovered 20 crude bombs, two gelatin sticks, 4 electronic and 22 non- electronic detonators, 150 grams of explosive powder, two bottles labelled 'poison', batteries, soldering equipment, and a bomb circuit drawing from the house of Sanathan Sanstha worker in Nallasopara Explosives and firearms were seized from Nallasopara, Pune and Solapur, and three other men were also arrested. = Radicalisation = An Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) officer said after members of the right-wing outfit were arrested in connection Dabholkar’s murder \\"Members of Sanatan Sanstha are ‘hard nuts to crack’, who communicate in code languages and have networks in at least four prominent cities of Maharashtra. They also have an 84-page rule book that asks them to 'chant Lord's name' before shooting a target\\". \\"They don’t speak unless confronted with evidence. They are indoctrinated, tutored, and given elaborate directions. It is not easy to extract information from them,\\" an officer involved in the probe told CNN-News18 on condition of anonymity. Drug haul In September 2016, the Maharashtra police’s Special Investigation Team (SIT), which is probing the February 2015 murder of communist leader Govind Pansare, seized 20 boxes of restricted drugs — including sleeping pills and suppressants — from the premises Sanatan Sanstha’s ashram in Panvel. An SIT official stated that \\"It is suspected that the drugs were being used to control the mind of followers at the ashram\\". Proposed ban for murder and terrorism BJP= * In September 2015, Goa BJP MLA, Vishnu Wagh demanded that Sanatan Sanstha be banned, stating that there was evidence of the involvement of Sanatan Sanstha in the Pansare and Karburgi murders, and comparing Sanatan Sanstha to SIMI. However, next day Chief Minister of Goa, Laxmikant Parsekar ruled out banning Sanatan Sanstha. * Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has stated that he would not hesitate to ban Sanatan Sanstha if any evidence found against the organisation. =AAP= * Aam Aadmi Party have demanded a ban on the Sanatan Sanstha for the alleged murders they have been involved in. =NCP= * In Maharashtra, NCP, together with the Congress demanded that Sanatan Sanstha be banned.

Formal trousers, also known as formal striped trousers or colloquially spongebag trousers, are grey striped or patterned formal trousers for day attire in traditional Western dress code, primarily associated with formal morning dress or secondly its semi-formal equivalent black lounge suit. Traditionally made from heavy wool ranging from worsted, melton to partial twill weave, the pattern is most often of a muted design in stripes of black, silver, white and charcoal grey in various combinations (not to be confused with pinstripe or chalkstripe, which are formed of single thin lines spaced equally apart). In addition, formal trousers may also come in check patterns, such as houndstooth check, or plaids, although these variants are widely considered as not the most formal. Although it is possible to create a complete suit out of the same fabric, etiquette limits the morning stripe design to formal trouser.https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/suiting-fabrics-cloth- weaves-designs-morning-stripe-jean-paul-samson/ In Batman Returns, Christopher Walken's villainous character wears pants, a sportcoat and a waistcoat made from the same spongebag fabric.Batman Returns on IMDB Typically, formal trousers are intended to be worn with braces with a fishtail back covered by a waistcoat, and have pleats for correct ironing result and comfort. Likewise, for traditional reasons of formality, they do not have turn-ups, since these are considered less formal. Name The British synonym \\"cashmere striped trousers\\" refers to the actual name of the stripe pattern, and not to the fabric. Similarly, the slang term \\"spongebag trousers\\" or \\"spongebags\\" is due to the perceived similarity of the distinctive stripe pattern to traditional sponge-bags, a bag of toiletries (but does not apply to check patterns). In Germany, the synonym \\"Stresemann trousers\\" occurs, for the same reasons as the semi-formal stroller is called a \\"Stresemann\\". History Formal trousers were originally introduced in the first half of the 19th century as a complement to the then widely worn frock coat. As established formal day attire trousers, they were subsequently introduced to go with the morning dress, which in turn gradually replaced the frock coat as formal day attire standard by 20th century, along with its semi-formal equivalent black lounge suit.

Together with Izidor Cankar and Franc Snoj, he was an important exponent of the liberal conservative fraction of the Slovene People's Party. Biography Kuhar was born into a Carinthian Slovene family in Kotlje near Gutenstein in Kärnten, Austro-Hungarian Empire (now in Slovenia). One of his brothers was Lovro Kuhar, better known under the pen name of Prežihov Voranc, who became a renowned Communist activist during the interwar period. Alojzij was an ordained Roman Catholic priest. In 1919, he studied law in Paris. In the 1920s and 1930s, he served in the diplomatic service of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, whilst simultaneously working as the editor on foreign policy for the conservative newspaper Slovenec. After the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, he emigrated to New York City and then to London, where he collaborated in the activities of the Yugoslav Government in exile. Together with Miha Krek, Franc Snoj, and Izidor Cankar, he formed the core of the Slovene People's Party in exile. Between 1942 and 1944, he worked as the Slovene speaker for Radio London, and was later replaced by Boris Furlan. After the Treaty of Vis between the Yugoslav Prime Minister in exile Ivan Šubašić and the Yugoslav partisan leader Josip Broz Tito, Kuhar unsuccessfully tried to convince the leadership of the Slovene People's Party to recognize the Yugoslav pro-Communist resistance, and was also unsuccessfully in his protestations that the collaborationist Slovene Home Guard should join forces with the Liberation Front of the Slovenian People. Unlike his contemporaries Izidor Cankar and Franc Snoj, who returned to Slovenia at the end of World War II, Kuhar remained in exile, where he assumed a highly critical attitude towards the new Communist regime. In 1949, he obtained a PhD at the University of Cambridge with a thesis on the Christianisation of Slovenes in the Middle Ages. He settled in New York City, where he died in 1958.

Its name was suggested by the Special Pathogens Unit of the National Institute for Communicable Diseases of the National Health Laboratory Service (NICD-NHLS) by using the first two letters of the names of the cities involved in the 2008 outbreak of the disease, Lusaka (Zambia) and Johannesburg (Republic of South Africa). It is the second pathogenic Arenavirus to be described from the African continent—the first being Lassa virus—and since 2012 has been classed as a \\"Select Agent\\" under U.S. law. History Only 5 cases of this virus have ever been reported; all 5 were identified in September and October 2008, and 4 were fatal. Those infections that proved fatal caused death within 10–13 days of showing symptoms. All four patients in which infection proved fatal first showed signs of improvement and then went into respiratory distress, displayed neurological problems, and had circulatory issues that resulted in collapse. The discovery of this novel virus was described following a highly fatal nosocomial (hospital) outbreak of VHF in Johannesburg. The identification of this virus was the first new arenavirus discovered in over 40 years. The first case was a female travel agent who lived in the outskirts of Lusaka. She suffered from fever which grew worse with time. She was evacuated to Johannesburg for medical treatment. Almost two weeks later, the paramedic that nursed the patient on the flight to South Africa also fell ill and was also brought to Johannesburg for medical treatment. At this time the connection between these two patients was recognized by the attending physician in the Johannesburg hospital. Together with the NICD-NHLS the clinical syndrome of VHF was recognized and specimens from the second patient were submitted for laboratory confirmation. In addition, a cleaner and a nurse that had contact with the first patient also fell ill. A second nurse was infected through contact with the paramedic. The outbreak had a high case fatality rate with 4 of 5 identified cases resulting in death. The Special Pathogens Unit of the NICD-NHLS together with colleagues from the Special Pathogens Unit of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identified the etiological agent of the outbreak as an Old World arenavirus using molecular and serological tests. Sequencing and phylogenetic investigation of partial genome sequencing indicated that this virus was not Lassavirus and likely a previously unreported arenavirus. This was corroborated by full genome sequencing that was conducted by the NICD-NHLS, CDC and collaborators from Columbia University in New York. Distribution The distribution of this newly described arenavirus is uncertain. To date this virus has only been reported from a patient from Zambia and a subsequent nosocomial outbreak in South Africa.  Transmission  Viruses from the Arenaviridae family, to which Lujo virus belongs, almost always have a rodent reservoir, with one virus in the family having a bat reservoir. Contact with an infected rodent host, its urine or fecal matter, inhalation of dust with virus particles, or eating food containing remnants of the virus can result in human infection. Transmission can also occur via human-to-human contact, as evidenced by the 5 cases from 2008, but it is still not completely clear how the first case was contracted. Both bats and rodents should be considered possible contact points, just to be safe. Though it is not known for sure, it is speculated that the human-to-human transmission occurs from contact with bodily fluids. The incubation period is expected to be 7–13 days.  Symptoms  VHF symptoms appear similar to other viruses of the same family, such as Lassa fever. The known symptoms include swelling in the neck and face, sore throat, diarrhea, and a rash resembling measles on the face and body. Blood tests of those infected revealed elevated liver values, white blood cell counts that were first low and then elevated over time, and low platelet counts.  Treatment  In-depth research into Lujo virus and its treatment have been difficult because of the lack of economic and cultural stability of the regions where the only known cases have occurred. Treatment with ribavirin seemed to have cured the only surviving patient with Lujo Virus, but because the 5 affected in 2008 have been the only cases identified, there has not been much opportunity for further research. Phylogenetics Sequencing of the viral genome has shown that this virus belongs to the Old World arenavirus group. Comparisons with other viral genome sequences showed that this virus is equidistant from other Old World and New World arenaviruses. It is distantly similar to the other pathogenic African arenavirus, Lassa fever virus. Clinical This virus has been associated with an outbreak of five cases of VHF in September and October 2008. In four cases (80% of total known infections) the infection was fatal. The fifth case was treated with ribavirin early after onset of clinical disease (was detected through active contact tracing), an antiviral drug which is effective in treating Lassa fever, and survived; however, ribavirin's effectiveness against Lujo virus remains unknown.

The wilderness area is named after and protects the upper Owyhee River, its tributaries, and the surrounding desert canyon landscape. Whitewater rafting is a popular recreational activity in this wilderness area. Managed by the Bureau of Land Management, it is the second-largest U.S. Wilderness Area that is not located within a National Forest, National Park, or National Wildlife Refuge. The BLM's Black Rock Desert Wilderness, located within Black Rock Desert – High Rock Canyon Emigrant Trails National Conservation Area, is larger. About of the Owyhee River is classified as a wild river. Geography The Owyhee River Wilderness is irregularly shaped, generally following the course of the Owyhee River, South Fork Owyhee River, Little Owyhee River, Deep Creek, and Battle Creek, as well as including some plateau lands. The wilderness area stretches from the Oregon-Idaho border in the west to the Duck Valley Indian Reservation in the east to the Nevada-Idaho border in the south. The rivers and creeks are deeply eroded into the Owyhee Plateau, resulting in deep canyons. The only roads are rough and there are few trails. There are challenging whitewater rivers. Legislative history The Owyhee River Wilderness was created by the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009 and signed into law by President Barack Obama on March 30, 2009. Also created in the Omnibus Land Act were five additional southwestern Idaho wilderness areas in Owyhee County, collectively known as the Owyhee Canyonlands Wilderness Areas: * Big Jacks Creek Wilderness - * Bruneau – Jarbidge Rivers Wilderness - * Little Jacks Creek Wilderness - * North Fork Owyhee Wilderness - * Pole Creek Wilderness - The Act of 2009 added of wilderness within the state of Idaho. The Owyhee River Wilderness accounts for 51.7% of that area. Wilderness areas do not allow motorized or mechanical equipment including bicycles. Although camping and fishing are allowed with proper permit, no roads or buildings are constructed and there is also no logging or mining, in compliance with the 1964 Wilderness Act. Wilderness areas within National Forests and Bureau of Land Management areas also allow hunting in season. Natural history The Owyhee River Wilderness lies within the Owyhee Desert, part of the northern Basin and Range ecoregion, although hydrologically the wilderness area is within the Snake River – Columbia River drainage. The region is home to a varying amount of animal and plant life. Animals such as bighorn sheep, cougars, prairie falcons, bobcats, and pronghorn live through the region. A variety of plant life such as lupine, Eriogonum salicornioides, Phacelia lutea var., and bitterroot can also be found in the area.

Barton Hepburn biography at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Early life Hepburn was born on a farm in Colton, St. Lawrence County, New York on July 24, 1846. He was the youngest of four sons born to Zina Earl Hepburn (1798–1874) and Beulah (née Gray) Hepburn (1807–1900). His maternal uncle was a founder of the Cleveland Plain-Dealer. He attended St. Lawrence Academy and the Fuller Academy at Oswego before attending Middlebury College where he graduated in 1871; later serving as a trustee. In 1906 he was given an honorary degree by St. Lawrence University. Career Hepburn from a 1913 publication. In 1871, he returned to St. Lawrence Academy (today's St. Lawrence University) where he became a Professor of Mathematics before serving as Principal of Ogdensburg Educational Institute and was elected school commissioner, while studying law. =New York State Assembly= He was elected as a Republican to be a member of the New York State Assembly (St. Lawrence Co., 2nd D.) in 1875, 1876, 1877, 1878 and 1879. While serving in the Assembly, Hepburn was directed by the New York State Legislature in 1879 to investigate the railroads' practice of giving rebates within the state. Merchants without ties to the oil industry had pressed for the hearings. Prior to the committee's investigation, few knew of the size of Standard Oil's control and influence on seemingly unaffiliated oil refineries and pipelines, with only a dozen or so within Standard Oil knew the extent of company operations. The committee counsel, Simon Sterne, questioned representatives from the Erie Railroad and the New York Central Railroad and discovered that at least half of their long-haul traffic granted rebates, and that much of this traffic came from Standard Oil. The committee then shifted focus to Standard Oil's operations. John Dustin Archbold, as president of Acme Oil Company, denied that Acme was associated with Standard Oil. He then admitted to being a director of Standard Oil. The committee's final report scolded the railroads for their rebate policies and cited Standard Oil as an example. This scolding was largely moot to Standard Oil's interests since long-distance oil pipelines were now their preferred method of transportation. =Later career= On April 13, 1880, he was appointed Superintendent of the New York State Banking Department, serving until 1883 when Willis S. Paine was appointed as his successor. He then served three years as National Bank Examiner for the cities of New York and Brooklyn before his appointment as Comptroller of the Currency by President Benjamin Harrison.

Cannon as president of the Chase National Bank. Hepburn was a Director of the Studebaker Corporation. After leaving the office of Comptroller he worked in the field of banking, becoming the president of the Third National Bank of New York then the Vice-President of the National City Bank in 1897 when the Third National Bank merged with other banks to form that company. He then became the President of the Chase National Bank. A prolific writer on the economy and financial matters, he wrote the books History of Coinage and Currency in the United States: Perennial Contest for Sound Money (1903), A History of Currency in the United States\\" (1915), and \\"Artificial Waterways and Commercial Development. He also regularly contributed to magazines and periodicals. Personal life In 1873, he married Harriet A.

In 1887, he married suffragist Emily L. Eaton (1865–1956), of Montpelier, Vermont. Emily was a niece of Dorman Bridgman Eaton, a lawyer instrumental in American federal Civil Service reform. They lived at 471 Park Avenue and were the parents of two daughters: * Beulah Eaton Hepburn (1890–1978), founder of the High Mowing School in Wilton, New Hampshire who married Rear Admiral Robert R.

After his death, his wife was involved in the development of the Beekman Tower at the corner of First Avenue and East 49th Street. Through his son Charles, he was a grandfather of actor Barton Hepburn. =Philanthropy and legacy= Hepburn Hall at Middlebury College Somewhat philanthropic, Hepburn donated funds to allow for the construction of libraries for each school he oversaw when he was District Superintendent. Two of these libraries are listed on the National Register of Historic Places: the Hepburn Library at Norfolk, New York and Hepburn Library of Colton at Colton. Hepburn Hall, a dormitory at Middlebury College whose construction was financed by a gift from Hepburn, is named for him. The building was initially painted bright yellow per Hepburn's request to brighten the appearance of the campus, but was repainted gray following his death to better match the rest of the campus' buildings. Hepburn Hall also contains the Hepburn Zoo, a former dining area turned black box theater, which is so-named because it was originally adorned with Hepburn's hunting trophies.

By Cotten's own account in the 1985 BBC series Down Home, she composed “Freight Train” as a teenager (sometime between 1906 and 1912), inspired by the sound of the trains rolling in on the tracks near her home in North Carolina. Cotten was a one-time nanny for folk singer Peggy Seeger, who took this song with her to England, where it became popular in folk music circles. British songwriters Paul James and Fred Williams subsequently misappropriated it as their own composition and copyrighted it. Under their credit, it was then recorded by British skiffle singer Chas McDevitt, who recorded the song in December, 1956. Under advice from his manager (Bill Varley), McDevitt then brought in folk-singer Nancy Whiskey and re-recorded the song with her doing the vocal; the result was a chart hit. McDevitt's version influenced many young skiffle groups of the day, including The Quarrymen. Under the advocacy of the influential Seeger family, the copyright was eventually restored to Cotten. Nevertheless, it remains mis- credited in many sources. The Elizabeth Cotten recording for the Folksongs and Instrumentals with Guitar album was made by Mike Seeger in late 1957, early 1958, at Cotten's home in Washington, D.C. Ramblin' Jack Elliott recorded this song in 1957. It is included on the CD, The Lost Topic Tapes: Cowes Harbour 1957. Beatles cover versions According to author Mark Lewisohn, in The Complete Beatles Chronicles (p. 362), the young Quarrymen-Beatles performed it live from 1957 till at least 1959, if not later, with John Lennon on lead vocal. No recorded version is known to survive. However, in January 1991, while doing recorded rehearsals in Sussex, England for the initial Unplugged TV show, Paul McCartney and his band performed various classic skiffle songs. The concluding number was \\"Freight Train\\", though it was abruptly stopped just a few seconds into the song (this recording is available on an unauthorized release called Paul McCartney Limelight). In 2009 Quarrymen member Rod Davis recorded a cover of the song and released it on his album Under The Influence. Other recorded versions Many artists have since recorded their own version of the song, including ;Charting versions *Chas McDevitt Skiffle Group featuring Nancy Whiskey (No. 5 on the UK Singles Chart in 1957) *Rusty Draper (charted to the US top ten, end of 1957) * Peter, Paul and Mary on their In the Wind album * Esther & Abi Ofarim on their album Songs Der Welt (1963) * Chet Atkins played an instrumental version. * Odetta performed the song on the PBS series The Great American Dream Machine (1971). * Heli Lääts, an Estonian- language version under the title \\"Rongid\\" (1972).

The Castleton Jail is an exhibit building located at the Shelburne Museum in Shelburne, Vermont, United States. Constructed entirely of slate, it was originally built in 1890 in Castleton, Vermont, where it operated for over fifty years. Castleton Castleton was chartered in 1761. The charter for of land was granted by Gov. Benning Wentworth of New Hampshire and divided the land into 70 \\"rights\\" or \\"shares\\". Three families had settled in Castleton by 1770. More settlers followed, and by 1777 the town consisted of 17 families. Vermont attained statehood in 1791, and Castleton continued to grow as an agricultural community. Farmers raised cattle, then turned for a while to sheep. Apple orchards abounded. Saw mills and gristmills were the first industries to be established in town. During the middle of the nineteenth century the slate and marble industries began to thrive in and around Castleton. The railroad came in 1854, and the last half of the century saw the development of tourism around Lake Bomoseen.http://www.bsi-vt.com/castleton/chs/index.html Construction The jail building's unusual composition reflects the richness of Vermont's geological deposits. In the early 19th century, Vermonters discovered beds of slate that stretched from the state's western edge to New York's eastern borders. These massive deposits gave birth to a healthy mining industry that still extracts the grey, sea green, and red material.http://www.anr.state.vt.us/dec/geo/vtgeofom.htm The nature of slate, with its geologically formed horizontal bedding, causes it to fracture along flat lines and, unlike granite and marble, slate cannot be undercut or sculpted. Consequently, its use as an art material has been minimal. Despite these limitations, the architect of the Castleton Jail took advantage of the planar formation of slate in constructing the jail, layering pieces of slate horizontally to form the exterior walls, and floors. The dark interior consists of two cells and a jailor's compartment with only a single window to admit light and air. A riveted iron door completes this impregnable structure. History In 1953, Shelburne Museum purchased the fifty-ton jail from the town of Castleton for one dollar per ton. Only the roof and gable ends were removed for the journey of to Shelburne. Special dollies with 24 rubber-tired wheels were built to carry the basic structure and demanded additional steering apparatuses and four sets of brakes to maintain control on steep hills. The move, aided by the Vermont State Police, required three days at speeds up to .

Designed in the naturalistic English-garden style, it lies in the district (quartier) of Batignolles, near the new Parc Clichy- Batignolles. The name The origin of the name \\"Batignolles\\" may be the Latin word, \\"batillus\\", meaning \\"mill\\", or, it may be derived from the Provençal word \\"bastidiole\\", meaning \\"small farmhouse\\". History Until the early nineteenth century, the area was largely deserted countryside with a few scattered farms. The square was established under the Second Empire, at the request of Baron Haussmann, who fulfilled the desire of Napoleon III to establish several English-style gardens in the capital. Napoleon III had acquired a taste for the English garden during his exile in England, prior to 1848. The Square des Batignolles was created by Jean-Charles Adolphe Alphand, assisted by the engineer, Jean Darcel, the architect, Gabriel Davioud, and the horticulturist, Jean-Pierre Barillet-Deschamps, on a tract of land that had been described as \\"a vast wasteland\\". This was the same team that had been assembled to design and execute the Bois de Boulogne on the western edge of Paris. Vulture statue In 1860, Napoleon III annexed the district of Batignolles to Paris. In 1862, Alphand designed and created the Square des Batignolles. Alphand was the engineer for most of the parks built at this time, including the Parc des Buttes Chaumont, Parc Montsouris, and others. Currently, the mayor of Paris is trying to maintain the Square des Batignolles in the pure Haussmann-Alphand style. This style is most visible in small bridges, concrete designs with plant motifs, and faux rocks with the appearance of stratification (as at Parc des Buttes-Chaumont). Description The Square des Batignolles was designed as an English garden (or landscape garden), a style first made popular by the English landscape architect, Capability Brown. =The English landscape garden= The key to this style is naturalism, a studied, but unselfconscious, attempt to leave the impression that the grounds are untouched by human hands. The landscaper employs his artistry, through the use of various forms of asymmetric balance, to convince the visitor that the apparent wildness and randomness of the terrain is the product of artful Nature, rather than the artifice of Man. In contrast to previous formal gardens, with their geometrically designed parterres and pathways, their severely clipped shrubbery, and the artificiality of their topiary, which reflect an attempt to impose the gardener's will on Nature, the English garden adopts a more cooperative or collaborative approach. The English gardener and landscape architect, Capability Brown, compared his role as a garden designer to that of a poet or composer: \\"Here I put a comma, there, when it's necessary to cut the view, I put a parenthesis; there I end it with a period and start on another theme.\\".Cited in Allain and Christiany, pg. 282. The English-garden style also relies heavily on symbolism by using objects that are clearly man-made (called architectural follies) as focal points for gazing at the overall landscape. These human touches usually take the form of sham ruins; this is to demonstrate the impermanence of man's achievements in comparison to those of Nature. Other man-made features typically used in these gardens are temples, tea-houses, belvederes, pavilions, and gazebos whose placement invites the visitor to engage the landscape from the most aesthetically pleasing vantage points. These locative devices are usually supplemented by vast rolling lawns, well-placed copses of trees, quaint stone bridges, pieces of statuary casually installed in the landscape, grottos, strategically located ponds and watercourses, small waterfalls, and artificial cascades. Exotic vegetation was also planted, both to amaze the senses but also to display the power and reach of the Second Empire, which was capable of gathering and nurturing living species from all over the world. True to the archetype, the Square des Batignolles features extensive rolling lawns and a large pond that is fed by a natural stream that courses through the park. The pond is home to large red Japanese carp, known as koi, and over three hundred ducks of various species. In the middle of the pond stands a statue created by Louis de Monard in 1930 called Vautours (Vultures). Elsewhere in the Square is a bust of the poet, Léon Dierx (1838–1912), created by Bony de Lavergne in 1932. Léon Dierx =Vegetation= For a park of this relatively modest size (less than two hectares), there are surprisingly large undulating lawns here, and the many wandering paths are shaded by a remarkable variety of trees. There are oriental plane trees that are over 140 years old and over thirty metres in height. There is a relatively young giant sequoia, which has yet to become gigantic. There are hazelnut trees from Asia Minor, Siberian elms, Japanese cherry trees, ash trees, willows, black walnuts, and others. On top of a small rocky outcrop is a glass-walled gazebo which acts as a greenhouse for a solitary tropical palm tree. The following tree specimens can be found in the square : *four hybrid trees (Platanus x Hispanica), planted in 1840 and 1880, all between 32 and 38 metres high, one of which is 5.90 m in circumference and among the largest in Paris * the purple beech (Fagus sylvatica, Fagus purpurea), one example of which is now gigantic * the honey locust (Gleditsia triacanthos), native to North America * the Chinese 'corkscrew' willow (Salix matsudana 'Tortuosa') * the Turkish hazel (Corylus colurna) * ash trees with aucuba-like leaves (Fraxinus aucubaefolia) * the Japanese persimmon (Diospyros kaki) * the trifolia lemon (Citrus limon) * a giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum) Square des Batignolles is popular with children. There are several playgrounds, sand-boxes, swings, a carousel with old-fashioned wooden horses, an area for roller skating, and ping-pong tables. There are also areas for adults who wish to play pétanque, or boules.

He is the executive director of the Tenderloin Housing Clinic, a non-profit organization in San Francisco that he co-founded in 1980. He has also co-founded and is on the Board of Directors of Uptown Tenderloin, Inc., a nonprofit organization that spearheaded the creation of the national Uptown Tenderloin Historic District in 2009. Uptown Tenderloin, Inc. is also the driving force behind the Tenderloin Museum, which opened in the spring of 2015. Randy is also the editor of Beyond Chron, and has written six books on activism.  Early Activism  Working on tenants rights campaigns in Berkeley, led to helping open the Tenderloin Housing Clinic (THC) in 1980. where Randy quickly became active in tenant rights, particularly the Tenderloin's struggles against luxury hotel development and the conversion of single room occupancy hotels (SROs) for tourist use.  Tenderloin Housing Clinic  Upon graduation from Hastings, Randy was awarded a $12,000 grant from the Berkeley Law Foundation, becoming Tenderloin Housing Clinic's first full-time staff attorney and executive director. THC currently leases and manages 23 SROs (over 1,800 units) for homeless single adults and owns and manages the Galvin Apartments at 785 Brannan Street. = \\"Heat-less\\" Hotel Scandal = In 1982, the \\"heat-less hotel\\" scandal was exposed whereby thousands of San Francisco's SRO tenants were living without heat. The story rocked San Francisco and was front-page news for a week, ultimately resulting in the emergency enactment of tough new heat and hot water laws which he helped author. = Protecting Low-cost Housing = Randy then went on to work with tenants on new police rules preventing illegal lockouts of tenants in lieu of legal evictions. In 1984, a campaign against Guenter Kaussen was launched. Guenter Kaussen was known as the \\"worlds biggest slumlord.\\". Overcharging rent to Cambodian immigrant tenants in the Tenderloin led media to investigating the West German-based real estate mogul. At the time, Guenter Kaussen was the Tenderloin's largest apartment owner; this led to a story on 60 Minutes CBS-TV February 3, 1985 and Kaussen's suicide. = New San Francisco Homeless Strategy = In 1988, Randy proposed San Francisco to adopt a modified payments program (MPP), enabling homeless single adults receiving welfare to obtain permanent housing. He talked to hotel owners and found that many would be willing to charge rents affordable to welfare recipients if they could ensure rent payments. Under the MPP, welfare recipients agreed to have their checks \\"modified\\" so that THC was also named on the check. These two- party checks would be delivered to THC's offices, and THC would then deduct the rent from the check and give the tenant the balance. The incoming Mayor Art Agnos Administration implemented the MPP on a trial basis, and that if it worked, the city would fund it. With a small grant obtained for THC to start the program in 1988 and it proved successful. By 1989, over 1,000 formerly homeless single adults were living in permanent housing through enrolling in the MPP. The program is still used by housing providers throughout San Francisco's extensive supporting housing system today. In May 1999, an innovative approach to housing homeless single adults was launched through the Department of Housing Services, called the hotel leasing program . THC became San Francisco's leading provider of permanent housing for homeless single adults, and the leasing program was the foundation of the San Francisco's Care Not Cash program which began in 2004.  Legislation Drafted  In addition to helping author San Francisco's heat and hot water laws, key city ballot measures were drafted and state laws were strengthened to help rent control and housing code enforcement.  National Housing Advocacy  In 1999, Housing America (HA) was founded to build national pressure for increased federal affordable housing funds and co-authored the study, There's No Place Like Home: How America's Housing Crisis, Threatens Our Children, which generated several widespread media coverage. In 2000, \\"There's No Place Like Home\\" was authored for In These Times, which was a study on how the U.S. media ignores the nation's housing crisis was voted the 9th most censored study for 2003 by Project Censored.  As an Author  Six books on activism and social change have been authored by Randy Shaw. = Generation Priced Out: Who Will Live in the New Urban America? = In 2018 he published a book on the urban housing crisis talking about how skyrocketing rents and home values are pricing the working and middle classes out of urban America. Several points he emphasizes in his book are: *You can be both pro-tenant and pro-development *Single- family home zoning and owners are part of the problem *Building new housing does not make existing housing more expensive *Tech and other high-paid workers are not the problem *Housing markets are not free markets = The Tenderloin: Sex, Crime and Resistance in the Heart of San Francisco = “In ‘The Tenderloin’ Randy Shaw offers an incisive history of one of the nation’s most underappreciated neighborhoods. From its wild swings through vice and repression, surprising presence at the heart of the domestic Cold War, unique role as the locale where today’s transgender movement began out of a strange mix of federal anti-poverty programs and faith-based political organizing, and as the landing pad for refugees from U.S. wars in Southeast Asia, San Francisco’s Tenderloin is an historic neighborhood whose stories unfold at an astonishing pace. Shaw’s thoroughly documented, and profusely illustrated work will be a basic resource for scholars and urban investigators for years to come.” —Chris Carlsson, co-director Shaping San Francisco, editor of Reclaiming San Francisco and Ten Years That Shook the City: San Francisco 1968-78 = The Activist's Handbook, 2nd ed.: Winning Social Change in the 21st Century = A completely revised and updated edition of the original book, bringing the principles of activism into the Obama era. The book describes the tactics and strategies of the immigrant rights, marriage equality, and other movements that grew in strength in the 21st century. \\"Randy Shaw’s Activist’s Handbook is a book with legs. First published in the early 1990s, it has now been updated as a guide to “winning social change” in the new millennium. If you’re a long distance runner in any U.S. social movement—or trying to figure out how to become one—this is the training manual for you and your track team.\\" = Beyond the Fields = Described by UFW community and labor organizer Fred Ross Jr. as a \\"powerful and moving account of how the UFW transformed people's lives, instilling a lifetime commitment to social justice, Beyond the Fields: Cesar Chavez, the UFW and the Struggle for Justice in the 21st Century also traces the roots of Barack Obama's 2008 election outreach model to the UFW campaigns of the 1960s and 1970s, and the electoral strategies that UFW alumni brought with them to 21st Century campaigns. = Reclaiming America = Reclaiming America: Nike, Clean Air, and the New National Activism (UC Press 1999) argued that local activists needed to also focus on the national issues that increasingly shape local communities. Medea Benjamin, political activist and Co-Director of Global Exchange, said of the book \\"Randy Shaw provides the definitive account of the historic national campaign to reform Nike's labor practices. Reclaiming America is a must read for everyone seeking to achieve greater social and economic fairness in the 21st Century.\\" = The Activist's Handbook: A Primer for the 1990s and Beyond = A guide to making social change happen, The Activist's Handbook: A Primer for the 1990s and Beyond(UC Press: 1996, 2001, 2013) is described by Howard Zinn as \\"enormously valuable for anyone interested in social change. It is practical in its advice, and inspiring in its stories of ordinary people successfully confronting powerful interests.\\" = Other Writings = \\"Tenant Power in San Francisco\\" appears in the anthology, \\"Reclaiming San Francisco\\" by James Brook, Chris Carlsson and Nancy J.

Uptown Tenderloin Historic District  In 2007, Randy initiated the effort that resulted in the creation of the national Uptown Tenderloin Historic District, which is included in the National Register of Historic Places. The District covers over 31 city blocks and over 400 contributing structures. Shaw helped form Uptown Tenderloin, Inc. to help economically revitalize the neighborhood, and is currently its executive director. Uptown Tenderloin has restored historic advertising signs, developed murals on neighborhood history, gotten nearly 100 historic plaques on Tenderloin buildings, and installed nine \\"Lost Landmark\\" plaques on Tenderloin sidewalks. See uptowntl.org for more details.  Founder/Editor of an Alternative News Source  Founded in April 2004, Randy is the editor of the online daily news service Beyond Chron which covers local, state and national politics.

Early life Prince Rüdiger Karl Ernst Timo Aldi was born in Mülheim, the only son of Prince Timo of Saxony (1923–1983) and his first wife Margrit Lucas (1932–1957), the daughter of Carl Lucas, a butcher, and his wife Hildegard Stube. Prince Rüdiger's parents were married in Muelheim on 7 August 1952 in what was reported at the time as a \\"fairytale wedding\\" between a prince and a butcher's daughter. However, as Lucas was a commoner the marriage was considered morganatic. Prince Rüdiger had a difficult childhood. His father Prince Timo, who became addicted to morphine after sustaining serious injuries during an autumn 1945 bombing raid on Dresden, had a number of failed jobs. When Rüdiger was aged just 18 months old he was taken by his penniless mother to her father's home in Muelheim. The marriage proved difficult and Rüdiger's mother was in process of divorcing Prince Timo when she found out she was pregnant, later giving birth to a daughter Princess Iris of Saxony (b. 1955). Having failed to pay child support for his wife and two children, shortly before her death in 1957 the family of Rüdiger's mother had Prince Timo placed under legal guardianship by the courts, meaning that following the death of their mother the children were placed in the care of their maternal grandparents, Rüdiger and his sister's paternal family, grandfather Prince Ernst Heinrich the youngest son of King Frederick Augustus III, and uncles Prince Dedo (1922–2009) and Prince Gero (1925–2003) had emigrated to the Republic of Ireland following the loss of their vast properties in Saxony which became part of communist East Germany. The widowed Prince Timo's difficulties continued as after residing for a time in homeless shelters and dwellings to escape his creditors, the guardianship court had him admitted into a mental hospital in 1958. He was then treated by psychiatrists for the next seven years until 15 December 1965 when the ruling placing him under legal guardianship was lifted. Career After working as a psychologist in 2003 Prince Rüdiger left his home in Westerwald in order to move to Moritzburg, Saxony where he founded with his eldest son Prince Daniel the Wettinische Forstverwaltung (Wettin Forest service). The forest, which is owned as well as run by the royal family, is approximately 1200 hectares in size. Saxon succession The headship of the Royal House of Saxony is an area of dispute in the Saxon Royal Family. The dispute stems from the fact that the last undisputed head of the house Maria Emanuel, Margrave of Meissen, and the other princes of his generation either had no children, or, in the case of Prince Timo, had children who were not recognised as being members of the Royal House of Saxony. The first adopted dynastic heir of Maria Emanuel was his nephew Prince Johannes of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, son of his youngest sister Princess Mathilde of Saxony. After the early death of Prince Johannes, the heirless Maria Emanuel then began to look at his eldest nephew Alexander Afif, the eldest son of Princess Anna of Saxony and her husband Roberto Afif, despite the Afif-Saxony marriage being against the traditional laws of the House of Saxony in the same way as the marriage of Rüdiger's parents was. In 1997 the Margrave of Meissen proposed his nephew Alexander Afif as heir and drew up a document that was signed by the other male and female members of the Royal House (including previously morganatic spouses of princes who were now treated as dynasts being attributed the style of Royal Highness; Rüdiger his sons and sister were not involved) setting out that Alexander Afif would succeed on his death. The document was signed by: Anastasia, Margravine of Meissen, Prince Dedo (for himself, his brother Prince Gero and for their stepmother Princess Virginia), Prince Albert and his wife Princess Elmira, the Princesses Maria Josepha, Anna and Mathilde, and Princess Erina the third wife and widow of Prince Timo. Two years later on 1 July 1999 the Margrave adopted his nephew Alexander Afif giving him the family name Prinz von Sachsen Herzog zu Sachsen. The 1997 agreement proved to be controversial and in the summer of 2002 three of the signatories (Princes Albert, Dedo and Gero, who did not personally sign the document) retracted their support for the agreement. The following year Prince Albert wrote that it is through Prince Rüdiger and his sons that the direct line of the Albertine branch of the House of Wettin will continue, and thus avoid becoming extinct. Prince Rüdiger himself has never accepted the 1997 agreement and when asked for his opinion on who the eventual successor to Maria Emanuel should be he replied that it should be himself. Following the death of Maria Emanuel in July 2012, Prince Rüdiger recognised Prince Albert (who died three months later) as the new Margrave of Meissen and head of the Royal House of Saxony. The former Alexander Afif citing the 1997 agreement has also assumed those positions. According to the family website prior to his death Albert determined Rüdiger to be his successor and instituted . On this basis following Albert's death in October 2012 Prince Rüdiger assumed the headship of the house. Personal life Prince Rüdiger has been married twice. His first wife was Astrid Linke (1949–1989), the daughter of Heinz Linke and Elvira Wandke. They were married at Willich on 14 June 1974 and had three sons. *Prince Daniel of Saxony, Duke of Saxony (b. 1975); married Sandra Scherer, a scientist (b. 1977) and has one daughter, Princess Anna-Catharina Sophie (b. 2013) and one son, Prince Gero (b. 2015). *Prince Arne of Saxony, Duke of Saxony (b. 1977); married Sarah Schneider (b. 1979) and has two daughters, Princess Rosa (b. 2010) and Princess Frida (b. 2011) *Prince Nils of Saxony, Duke of Saxony (b. 1978); married Jedida Taborek, a lawyer (b. 1975) and has one son, Prince Moritz (b. 2009) and two daughters, Princess Aurelie (b. 2010) and Princess Felizitas (b. 2015). After his first wife's suicide, Prince Rüdiger married for a second time in January 2004 to Diana Dorndorf (c. 1959). The marriage was short-lived, however, as the couple divorced in 2008. Durning his second marriage, Prince Rüdiger placed a lonely hearts advertisement in the German newspaper Bild in the hope of finding a princess to marry. Honours In 2005 Prince Rüdiger was appointed an honorary knight of the order of Henry the Illustrious.

It was chosen as the Closing Film of the 2009 Cannes Film Festival, and was shown on 24 May 2009. Coco Chanel & Igor Stravinsky is based on the 2002 fictional novel Coco and Igor by Chris Greenhalgh and traces a rumoured affair between Coco Chanel and Igor Stravinsky in Paris in 1920, the year that Chanel No. 5 was created. Greenhalgh also wrote the screenplay for the film. Chanel and its former chief designer Karl Lagerfeld lent their support to the production; they granted access to the company's archives and to Coco Chanel's apartment at 31, rue Cambon, Paris.Press kit from Wild Bunch (in-depth background of various aspects, 2.6 MB) Plot An introductory scene takes place in Paris in 1913, where Coco Chanel attends the first, scandalous performance of Igor Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring. The rhythmic and harmonic dissonance of the score and the surprising choreography of the piece result in heckling and outrage among much of the audience. But Chanel is impressed by Stravinsky and his music. Seven years later, Chanel and Stravinsky meet again. Although her business has flourished, Chanel is mourning the death of her lover, Arthur \\"Boy\\" Capel. Stravinsky has chosen to flee to France following the Russian Revolution. An immediate sympathy and attraction occurs between the couturière and the composer. Chanel invites Stravinsky to live in her villa outside Paris, along with his ailing wife and their children. The summer months that follow see Chanel and Stravinsky begin an affair, one which Stravinsky's wife cannot avoid becoming aware of. Tensions between Stravinsky and his wife, and between Stravinsky's wife and Chanel, are unavoidable. The film implies that the affair, and the later termination of the affair by Chanel, has a major influence on the lives of both Chanel and Stravinsky. It is during this time that Chanel creates Chanel No. 5 with her perfumer, Ernest Beaux, and that Stravinsky begins to compose in a new, more liberated style. During his time at the villa, he works hard on a revision of The Rite of Spring. One of the last scenes of the movie shows the revival of the ballet, with new choreography, and this time, shows that it was an artistic triumph and recognized as a masterpiece.

Stephen Holden of The New York Times said the film was \\"cool, elegant and sexy…. But the film … never regains that initial blast of energy and the final scenes wobble toward a wishy-washy ending.\\" Writing for DVD Talk, Casey Burchby praises the \\"extraordinarily bold\\" opening sequence that recreates the Paris premiere of Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring. Modestas Mankus from Our Culture Mag gave the film 3/5 stars saying \\"stumbled through its unclear presentation but gave us a look into the world of two greats.\\" Historical context The riotous premiere of The Rite of Spring at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées on 29 May 1913 is legendary (see: The Rite of Spring#Premiere). In the spring of 1920, Chanel was introduced to Stravinsky by Sergei Diaghilev, impresario of the Ballets Russes. During the summer, Chanel discovered that the Stravinsky family was seeking a place to live. She invited them to her new home, \\"Bel Respiro,\\" in the Paris suburb of Garches until they could find a more suitable residence. They arrived at \\"Bel Respiro\\" during the second week of September and remained until May 1921. Chanel also guaranteed the 1920 Ballets Russes production of The Rite of Spring against financial loss with an anonymous gift to Diaghilev, said to be 300,000 francs. The personal relationships depicted in the film are largely fictionalized. Stravinsky was reputed to have been a philanderer who had several affairs, including one with Chanel.

According to Salesian school entries, in the year 1950, there were 280 Salesian religious in Hungary working in 15 places. However, the communist government prohibited every religious institute in Hungary. The Salesians had to abandon their work. Although they were officially dismissed, many of the former religious continued to live their sacred life. By the end of the communist regime, only 83 Salesians remained in Hungary to begin working once again in the spirit of Don Bosco: to serve the poor and neglected youth. Major Salesian houses in HungaryÓbuda - Provincial House and Salesianum Boarding House= Foundation: 2001 The Salesians bought the site Bécsi út 173 in 1999. It is the base for the present Provincial House. Its foundation stone was laid down on May 24, 2001. The building was finally completed and blessed on January 1, 2002. Its functions are currently: Provincial centre, home for Salesian aspirants-, novicess (1999), post-novices and theology students; the Provincial House has a church, the Segítő Szűz Mária church (Mary Help of Christians), located next to the main building. The Salesianum Boarding House is the part of the main building facing the Bécsi Street. It was originally designed for the provincialate. Later it was used as a boarding house for Catholic male university students. Address:Szent Alajos Szalézi Rendház 1032 Budapest, Bécsi út 175. Provincial: P.

The Salesians were also entrusted in 1915 with running the secondary school of the nearby village of Nyergesújfalu. In 1950, both buildings were nationalized. The pilgrim house became a prison and the monastery itself was made into a hunter's house of the communist Trade Union's. In 1992, the Salesians got the monastery back with its additional buildings.

Manufactured by American aircraft manufacturing company Convair, it was derived from the SM-65D Atlas missile, and was a member of the Atlas family of rockets. The Atlas D missile was the natural choice for Project Mercury since it was the only launch vehicle in the US arsenal that could put the spacecraft into orbit and also had many flights from which to gather data. But its reliability was far from perfect, and Atlas launches ending in explosions were an all-too common sight at Cape Canaveral. The Atlas had also been originally designed as a weapon system, thus its design and reliability did not need to necessarily be 100% perfect. As such, significant steps had to be taken to human-rate the missile and make it safe and reliable unless NASA wished to spend several years developing a dedicated launch vehicle for crewed programs or else wait for the next-generation Titan II ICBM to become operational. Atlas' stage-and- a-half configuration was seen as preferable to the two stage Titan in that all engines were ignited at liftoff, making it easier to test for hardware problems during pre-launch checks. Shortly after being chosen for the program in early 1959, the Mercury astronauts were taken to watch the second D-series Atlas test, which exploded a minute into launch. This was the fifth straight complete or partial Atlas failure and the booster was at this point nowhere near reliable enough to carry a nuclear warhead or an uncrewed satellite, let alone a human passenger. Plans to human-rate Atlas were effectively still on the drawing board and Convair estimated that 75% reliability would be achieved by early 1961 and 85% reliability by the end of the year. Despite the Atlas' developmental problems, NASA had the benefit of conducting Project Mercury simultaneously with the Atlas R&D; program which gave plenty of test flights to draw data from as well as test modified equipment for Mercury. Quality assurance Aside from the modifications described below, Convair set aside a separate assembly line dedicated to Mercury-Atlas vehicles which was staffed by personnel who received special orientation and training on the importance of the crewed space program and the need for as high a degree of top-quality workmanship as possible. Components used in the Mercury-Atlas vehicles were given thorough testing to ensure proper manufacturing quality and operating condition, in addition components and subsystems with excessive operating hours, out-of-specification performance, and questionable inspection records would be rejected. All components approved for the Mercury program were earmarked and stored separately from hardware intended for other Atlas programs and special handling procedures were done to protect them from damage. The factory inspection of Mercury vehicles was performed by Convair personnel specially chosen for their experience, familiarity with the Atlas hardware, and who had demonstrated a favorable disposition and work ethic. Propulsion systems used for the Mercury vehicles would be limited to standard D-series Atlas models of the Rocketdyne MA-2 engines which had been tested and found to have performance parameters closely matching NASA's specifications. NASA decided that the best choice of engines would be units with roughly medium-tier performance. Engines with higher than average performance were not considered acceptable because nobody could determine exactly why a given set of engines performed the way it did, and so it was considered safest to use medium-performance ones. For the most part, NASA preferred to stay conservative with the Mercury vehicles and avoid modifying them any more than necessary. Modifications to the Atlas would largely be limited to those that improved pilot safety and the standard D-series Atlas configuration was to be retained as much as possible, so assorted enhancements made to the latest Atlas missiles would not be used. Various equipment and procedures used with Mercury vehicles, although outdated and often not the best or latest, were preferred because they were proven and well-understood. Any new equipment or hardware changes made to Mercury vehicles had to be flown on at least three Atlas R&D; tests before NASA would approve them for use. Despite the conservatism and caution taken with the design of Mercury vehicles, a huge number of changes nonetheless did take place over the 4-1/2 years of the program from lessons learned and the emphasis on quality control got tighter as time went along; the last two Mercury flights were given a level of testing and pre-flight inspection that was unheard of when Big Joe flew in 1959. All launch vehicles would have to be complete and fully flight-ready at delivery to Cape Canaveral with no missing components or unscheduled modifications/upgrades. After delivery, a comprehensive inspection of the booster would be undertaken and prior to launch, a flight review board would convene to approve each booster as flight-ready. The review board would conduct an overview of all pre-launch checks, and hardware repairs/modifications. In addition, Atlas flights over the past few months in both NASA and Air Force programs would be reviewed to make sure no failures occurred involving any components or procedures relevant to Project Mercury. The NASA Quality Assurance Program meant that each Mercury-Atlas vehicle took twice as long to manufacture and assemble as an Atlas designed for uncrewed missions and three times as long to test and verify for flight. Systems modifiedAbort sensor= Central to these efforts was the development of the Abort Sensing and Implementation System (ASIS), which would detect malfunctions in the Atlas's various components and trigger a launch abort if necessary. Added redundancy was built in; if ASIS itself failed, the loss of power would also trigger an abort. The system was tested on a few Atlas ICBM flights prior to Mercury-Atlas 1 in July 1960, where it was operated open-loop (MA-3 in April 1961 would be the first closed-loop flight). The Mercury launch escape system (LES) used on Redstone and Atlas launches was identical, but the ASIS system varied considerably between the two boosters as Atlas was a much larger, more complex vehicle with five engines, two of which were jettisoned during flight, a more sophisticated guidance system, and inflated balloon tanks that required constant pressure to not collapse. Atlas flight test data was used to draw up a list of the most likely failure modes for the D-series vehicles, however simplicity reasons dictated that only a limited number of booster parameters could be monitored. An abort could be triggered by the following conditions, all of which could be indicative of a catastrophic failure: *The booster flight path deviated too far from the planned trajectory *Engine thrust or hydraulic pressure dropped below a certain level *Propellant tank pressure dropped below a certain level *The intermediate tank bulkhead showed signs of losing structural integrity *The booster electrical system ceased operating *The ASIS system ceased operating The ASIS system was deemed necessary because some flight failures of Atlas vehicles (for instance, Atlas 6B) occurred so fast that it would be nearly impossible for the astronaut to react in time manually activate the LES. Other failure modes such as a deviation from the correct flight trajectory did not necessarily pose an immediately danger to the astronaut's safety, and the flight could be aborted manually. =Rate gyros= The rate gyro package was placed much closer to the forward section of the LOX tank due to the Mercury/LES combination being considerably longer than a warhead and thus producing different aerodynamic characteristics (the standard Atlas D gyro package was still retained on the vehicle for the use of the ASIS). Mercury-Atlas 5 also added a new reliability feature—motion sensors to ensure proper operation of the gyroscopes prior to launch. This idea had originally been conceived when the first Atlas B launch in 1958 went out of control and destroyed itself after being launched with a non-functioning yaw gyro, but it was phased into Atlas vehicles only gradually. One other Atlas missile test in 1961 also destroyed itself during launch, in that case because the gyroscope motor speed was too low. The motion sensors would thus eliminate this failure mode. =Range safety= The range safety system was also modified for the Mercury program. There would be a three-second delay between engine cutoff and activation of the destruct charges so as to give the LES time to pull the capsule to safety. More specifically, if the Range Safety destruct command was sent, the ASIS system would allow the engine cutoff signal to go through, while blocking the destruct signal for three seconds. The decrease in engine performance would then be sensed by the ASIS, which would activate the LES, after which the destruct signal would be unblocked and destroy the launch vehicle. The ASIS system also could not terminate engine thrust for the first 30 seconds of flight in order to prevent a malfunctioning launch vehicle from coming down on or around the pad area; during this time only the Range Safety Officer could send a manual cutoff command. =Autopilot= D-series Atlas missiles carried the old-fashioned electromechanical autopilot (known as the \\"round\\" autopilot due to the shape of the containers its major components were housed in), but on Mercury vehicles, it was decided to use the newer transistorized \\"square\\" autopilot developed for the E and F-series missiles. The first three Mercury- Atlas vehicles still had the round autopilot and it was flown for the first time on Mercury-Atlas 3, but failed disastrously when the booster did not perform the programmed pitchover maneuver and had to be destroyed by Range Safety action. Afterwards, the missile programmer was recovered and examined. While the exact cause of the failure was not identified, several causes were proposed and a number of modifications made to the programmer. On Mercury- Atlas 4, high vibration levels in flight resulted in more modifications and it finally worked perfectly on Mercury-Atlas 5. =Antenna= The guidance antenna was modified to reduce signal interference. =LOX boil-off valve= Mercury-Atlas vehicles utilized the boil-off valve from the C-series Atlas rather than the standard D-series valve for reliability and weight-saving reasons. =Combustion sensors= Combustion instability was an important problem that needed to be fixed. Although it mostly only occurred in static firing tests of the MA-2 engines, three launches (Missiles 3D, 51D, and 48D) had demonstrated that unstable thrust in one engine could result in immediate, catastrophic failure of the entire missile as the engine backfired and ruptured, leading to a thrust section fire. On Missile 3D, this had occurred in flight after a propellant leak starved one booster engine of LOX and led to reduced, unstable thrust and engine failure. The other two launches suffered rough combustion at engine start, ending in explosions that severely damaged the launch stand. Thus, it was decided to install extra sensors in the engines to monitor combustion levels and the booster would also be held down on the pad for a few moments after ignition to ensure smooth thrust. The engines would also use a \\"wet start\\", meaning that the engine tubes would contain an inert fluid to act as a shock damper (51D and 48D had both used dry starts, with no fluid in the engine tubes). If the booster failed the check, it would be automatically shut down. Once again, these upgrades required testing on Atlas R&D; flights. By late 1961, after a third missile (27E) had exploded on the pad from combustion instability, Convair developed a significantly upgraded propulsion system that featured baffled fuel injectors and a hypergolic igniter in place of the pyrotechnic method, but NASA were unwilling to jeopardize John Glenn's upcoming flight with these untested modifications and so declined to have them installed in Mercury-Atlas 6's booster. As such, that and Scott Carpenter's flight on MA-7 used the old-style Atlas propulsion system and the new variant was not employed until Wally Schirra's flight late in 1962. Static testing of Rocketdyne engines had produced high-frequency combustion instability, in what was known as the \\"racetrack\\" effect where burning propellant would swirl around the injector head, eventually destroying it from shock waves. On the launches of Atlas 51D and 48D, the failures were caused by low-order rough combustion that ruptured the injector head and LOX dome, causing a thrust section fire that led to eventual complete loss of the missile. The exact reason for the back-to-back combustion instability failures on 51D and 48D was not determined with certainty, although several causes were proposed. This problem was resolved by installing baffles in the injector head to break up swirling propellant, at the expense of some performance as the baffles added additional weight and reduced the number of injector holes that the propellants were sprayed through. The lessons learned with the Atlas program later proved vital to the development of the much larger Saturn F-1 engine. =Electrical system= Added redundancy was made to the propulsion system electrical circuitry to ensure that SECO would occur on time and when commanded. The LOX fuel feed system received added wiring redundancy to ensure that the propellant valves would open in the proper sequence during engine start. =Tank bulkhead= Mercury vehicles up to MA-6 had foam insulation in the intermediate bulkhead to prevent the super-chilled LOX from causing the RP-1 to freeze. During repairs to MA-6 prior to John Glenn's flight, it was decided to remove the insulation for being unnecessary and an impediment during servicing of the boosters in the field. NASA sent out a memo to GD/A requesting that subsequent Mercury-Atlas vehicles not include bulkhead insulation. =LOX turbopump= In early 1962, two static engine tests and one launch (Missile 11F) fell victim to LOX turbopump explosions caused by the impeller blades rubbing against the metal casing of the pump and creating a friction spark. This happened after over three years of Atlas flights without any turbopump issues and it was not clear why the rubbing occurred, but all episodes of this happened when the sustainer inlet valve was moving to the flight-ready \\"open\\" position and while running untested hardware modifications. A plastic liner was added to the LOX turbopump to prevent friction rubbing. In addition Atlas 113D, the booster used for Wally Schirra's flight, was given a PFRT (Pre-Flight Readiness Test) to verify proper functionality of the propulsion system. =Pneumatic system= Mercury vehicles used a standard D-series Atlas pneumatic system, although studies were conducted over the cause of tank pressure fluctuation which was known to occur under certain payload conditions. These studies found that the helium regulator used on early D-series vehicles had a tendency to induce resonant vibration during launch, but several modifications to the pneumatic system had been made since then, including the use of a newer model regulator that did not produce this effect. =Propellant utilization system= In the event that the guidance system failed to issue the discreet cutoff command to the sustainer engine and it burned to propellant depletion, there was the possibility of a LOX-rich shutdown which could result in damage to engine components from high temperatures. For safety reasons, the PU system was modified to increase the LOX flow to the sustainer engine ten seconds before SECO. This was to ensure that the LOX supply would be completely exhausted at SECO and prevent a LOX-rich shutdown. =Skin= After MA-1 was destroyed in- flight due to a structural failure, NASA began requesting that Convair deliver Atlases with thicker skin. Atlas 10D (as well as its backup vehicle 20D which was later used for the first Atlas-Able flight), the booster used for the Big Joe test in September 1959, had sported thick skin and verified that this was needed for the heavy Mercury capsule. Atlas 100D would be the first thick- skinned booster delivered while in the meantime, MA-2's booster (67D) which was still a thin-skinned model, had to be equipped with a steel reinforcement band at the interface between the capsule and the booster. Under original plans, Atlas 77D was to have been the booster used for MA-3. It received its factory rollout inspection in September 1960, but shortly afterwards, the postflight findings for MA-1 came out which led to the thin-skinned 77D being recalled and replaced by 100D. =Guidance= The vernier solo phase, which would be used on ICBMs to fine-tune the missile velocity after sustainer cutoff, was eliminated from the guidance program in the interest of simplicity as well as improved performance and lift capacity. Since orbital flights required an extremely different flight path from missiles, the guidance antennas had to be completely redesigned to ensure maximum signal strength. The posigrade rocket motors on the top of the Atlas, designed to push the spent missile away from the warhead, were moved to the Mercury capsule itself. This also necessitated adding a fiberglass insulation shield to the LOX tank dome so it wouldn't be ruptured by the rocket motors. =Engine alignment= A common and normally harmless phenomenon on Atlas vehicles was the tendency of the booster to develop a slight roll in the first few seconds following liftoff due to the autopilot not kicking in yet. On a few flights however, the booster developed enough rolling motion to potentially trigger an abort condition if it had been a crewed launch. Although some roll was naturally imparted by the Atlas's turbine exhaust, this could not account for the entire problem which instead had more to do with engine alignment. Acceptance data from the engine supplier (Rocketdyne) showed that a group of 81 engines had an average roll movement in the same direction of approximately the same magnitude as that experienced in flight. Although the acceptance test-stand and flight-experience data on individual engines did not correlate, it was determined that offsetting the alignment of the booster engines could counteract this roll motion and minimize the roll tendency at liftoff. After Schirra's Mercury flight did experience momentary roll problems early in the launch, the change was incorporated into Gordon Cooper's booster on MA-9. Launches Nine LV-3Bs were launched, two on uncrewed suborbital test flights, three on uncrewed orbital test flights, and four with crewed Mercury spacecraft.Encyclopedia Astronautica - AtlasWade, Mark. Encyclopedia Astronautica. Retrieved 23 April 2017. http://www.astronautix.com/a/atlasd.html Atlas LV-3B launches were conducted from Launch Complex 14 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida. It first flew on 29 July 1960, conducting the suborbital Mercury-Atlas 1 test flight. The rocket suffered a structural failure shortly after launch, and as a result failed to place the spacecraft onto its intended trajectory. In addition to the maiden flight, the first orbital launch, Mercury-Atlas 3 also failed. This failure was due to a problem with the guidance system failing to execute pitch and roll commands, necessitating that the Range Safety Officer destroy the vehicle. The spacecraft separated by means of its launch escape system and was recovered from the launch pad. A further series of Mercury launches was planned, which would have used additional LV-3Bs; however these flights were canceled after the success of the initial Mercury missions. The last LV-3B launch was conducted on 15 May 1963, for the launch of Mercury-Atlas 9.

It was launched on October 15 in an attempt to locate and destroy Viet-Minh Chu Luc troops operating under the command of Võ Nguyên Giáp around the area of Phu Nho Quan, south of the Red River Delta.Windrow (2005), p. 221. Following the establishment of a French camp in the area, various troops were dispatched to engage the Viet-Minh forces. The operation was ended and the French withdrew by November 7, claiming approximately 1,000 enemy combatants killed, twice as many wounded, and 181 captured as well as a substantial quantity of weapons and ammunition. BackgroundThe war= The First Indochina War had raged, as guerrilla warfare, since 19 December 1946. From 1949, it evolved into conventional warfare, due largely to aid from the People's Republic of China (\\"PRC\\") to the north. Subsequently, the French strategy of occupying small, poorly defended outposts throughout Indochina, particularly along the Vietnamese-Chinese border, was failing. Thanks to the terrain and the close border with China, the Viet Minh had succeeded in turning a \\"clandestine guerrilla movement into a powerful conventional army\\",Windrow (2005), p. 41–42. something which previously had never been encountered by the western world.Fall (1994), p. 17. In October 1952, fighting around the Red River Delta spread into the Thai Highlands, resulting in the battle of Nà Sản, at which the Viet-Minh were defeated. The French used the lessons learned at Nà Sản – strong ground bases, versatile air support, and a model based on the British Burma campaign – as the basis for their new strategy. The Viet-Minh, however, remained unbeatable in the highland regions of Vietnam,Windrow (2005), 121. and the French \\"could not offset the fundamental disadvantages of a road bound army facing a hill and forest army in a country which had few roads but a great many hills and forests\\".Windrow (2005), 129. In May 1953, General Henri Navarre arrived to take command of the French forces in May 1953, replacing General Raoul Salan. Navarre spoke of a new offensive spirit in Indochina – based on strong, fast-moving forces. =Delta and Dien Bien Phu= During August 1953, Navarre was aware of four divisions of the People's Army operating in the Red River Delta. This was during a time where Navarre was organising the disposition of forces for the occupation of Dien Bien Phu, and thus his opponents' operations in the Delta persuaded him into committing forces there. Navarre committed his thoughts to paper on September 19 in a general instruction relegating the threat to Laos as \\"provisionally reduced\\" relative to the Delta, and thus chose to commit forces to that end over Dien Bien Phu. Division 320 of the People's Army, operating in the Phu Nho Quam forests, 12 miles from the De Lattre Line, was targeted by Operation Mouette. Operation Mouette is the French term for seagull, deriving from the Norse Mavri or Old English Maew. The operation, launched on October 15, was described by Martin Windrow as \\"not a raid, but an attempt to fix and destroy a major element of the Chu Luc before Giap could deploy it.\\" The route for the Viet-Minh between Thanh Hóa and the Delta contained a crossroads at Lai Cac which was targeted by the operation. Seven Mobile Groups (Groupes Mobiles) were deployed with river and amphibious units; tank units (largely the M24 Chaffee); half-tracks and paratroopers at designated landing sites, after counter-intelligence misled the Viet-Minh into defending the wrong locations. GM 2 and GM 3 took Lai Cac and established a camp under Colonel Christian de Castries, who would go on to command at Dien Bien Phu, and General Jean Gilles who would command Dien Bien Phu's initial paratrooper occupation. After occupation, the night of October 18 saw heavy counterattacks, which the French resisted. A battalion of the 13th Foreign Legion Demi-Brigade under Major Paul Pégot held out all night against one enemy battalion, and was \\"regarded as a particularly solid unit.\\" followed by two weeks of probing by GM 4 and paratrooper units. These columns fought major engagements in the surrounded countryside against Division 320, particularly on November 2, which continued until French withdrawal overnight on November 6. The French claimed over 1,000 enemy killed and 2,500 wounded, while 182 were captured, along with \\"500 infantry weapons, plus 100 bazookas and recoilless guns and 3,000 mines.\\"Windrow (2005), p. 222. Windrow notes that this would amount to one third of Division 320, and Wiest writes that the operation \\"weakened the VM 320th Division.\\" French casualties amounted to 113 dead, including seven officers, and 505 wounded men, including 22 officers. 151 were also recorded as missing. Aftermath Navarre, despite the success of the operation, noted – according to Windrow – the \\"inefficiency of the bulk of the Expeditionary Corps' infantry by late 1953\\" and would state in front of the Dien Bien Phu committee of inquiry that \\"Mouette demonstrated – in the opinion of Generals Cogny, Gilles and myself – that if we sent out infantry, given its present quality, outside the radius within which it enjoyed artillery support, then if it encountered Viet-Minh infantry, it would be beaten.\\" Jane Errington and B. McKercher, in their The Vietnam War as History, noted Mouette to be a \\"modest operation\\".Errington and McKercher, p. 33. A number of the French units involved in Mouette would go on to serve at Dien Bien Phu, particularly the 1st Parachute Chasseur RegimentWindrow (2005), p. 236. and the 13th Foreign Legion Demi-Brigade.Windrow (2005), p. 337. Both de Castries and Gilles would also serve there, the former commanding the troops on the ground following the initial occupation by paratroopers under the latter.Windrow (2005), p. 352. Viet-Minh Division 320 did not serve at Dien Bien Phu, and instead continued to operate in the Delta, occupying the attention of General Cogny – who command the French troops there – and continually tying down French forces there which could otherwise have served at Dien Bien Phu.Windrow (2005), p. 445.

Zanella builds small motorcycles, mopeds and ATVs. Zanella formerly manufactured go-karts. Zanella also produces the ZMax series of three-wheel motorcycles (trikes) and light trucks and the Force series of four-wheel light trucks. Business Zanella makes mopeds, scooters, motorcycles, quad ATVs, karts and 4-stroke engines, ranging from 50 to 500 cc. However, only the mopeds are manufactured in Argentina at plants in Caseros and San Luis. Almost all other products are imported from China; usually in the form of knock down kits. Based on onsite manufacture and assembly of imported motorcycles, Zanella plants have an installed production capacity of 12,000 units per month. It is expected that this current business plan will lead to the production level up to 14,000 units per month, returning to the levels of previous employment of approximately 1,000 direct employees and 3,000 indirect employees.

The document facilitates international travel as well as serving as proof of citizenship. The issuance of passports is the prerogative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, with the exception of diplomatic passports which are issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Kosovan passports comply with all the recommended standards set for machine-readable passports by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) (such as size, technology, security, layout, etc.), but the country/citizenship code RKS is not within ISO 3166 and thus not ICAO-endorsed. The passport design was disclosed on 14 March 2008. The first passports were issued on 30 July 2008 and as of 20 May 2009, 300,000 passports have been issued to the citizens of Kosovo.\\"Rreth 300 mijë qytetarë kosovarë pajisen me pasaporta\\" (In Albanian).\\" telegrafi.com.

The new design of the passport is a burgundy colour, with the coat of arms of the Republic of Kosovo in the middle of the cover page. The word \\"Passport\\" is written on the cover of the passport in Albanian, Serbian and English. All relevant identity information about the bearer is printed in these languages as well. For citizens that are 18 years old or older, the passport is valid for 10 years from the date of issue. Before the introduction of the new national passports, travel documents were issued by the United Nations administration with a maximum validity of 2 years. Those travel documents ceased being issued in 2008, with the remaining documents valid until 2010. Biometric passport The Kosovo biometric passport has been issued since 31 October 2011. In May 2011, the Ministry of Interior announced that biometric passports would be issued in the summer of 2011 after the winning firm is chosen and awarded the production of the passports.  Types  There are four types of passports: Ordinary, Official, Diplomatic and Travel Document. An application fee of €25 is required. = Ordinary = * Burgundy cover * Issued to all citizens of Kosovo with a maximum validity of 10 years to facilitate private international travel. = Official = * Maroon cover * Issued to political staff within the Government as well as their family members with a maximum validity of 5 years. = Diplomatic = * Black cover * Issued to the President of the Republic, the Prime Minister, members of the Government, the President of the Constitutional Court, the President of the Supreme Court, Ambassadors as well as other diplomatic staff in embassies or consulates around the world, to the Ombudsperson, members of state delegations if so required, Government officials which have been appointed as representatives of the Government in various international organisations, diplomatic couriers as prescribed by law, and persons of interest as prescribed by the law with a maximum validity of 5 years. = Travel Document = * Light Blue cover * Issued to the citizens of Kosovo if the original passport has been lost or stolen, and/or it has expired.

Therefore, some countries may not accept passports issued by the Government of the Republic of Kosovo.  Only passports  In addition, other countries have recognised the Kosovan passport as a travel document whilst not recognising Kosovo as a country. The situation here is similar to that of the Taiwan passport, which many countries routinely process, even though they only maintain unofficial diplomatic relations with Taiwan. The following countries have officially stated that they accept the Kosovan passport as a valid travel document, whilst not recognising Kosovo as an independent country: *Issuance of BiH visa to Citizens of Kosovo, Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Kosovo, 2012-03 *Entrance Visas in Brazil , Ministry of External Relations of Brazil, August 12, 2015.  *Lajcák confirms to Minister Hoxhaj the Slovak recognition of Kosovo passports, Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Kosovo, 2012-07-20 \\\\- Visa is affixed on a separate form *https://www.eurointegration.com.ua/news/2020/09/24/7114648/ In addition there are several countries to which people have apparently been able to travel on Kosovan passports, however where this is not officially stated policy or well established de facto practice this is not an indication that such a travel can be repeated in the future. Countries that have reportedly been visited in this manner include:     * *  Russia  Russia does not recognise Kosovo as an independent state, nor does it recognise the Kosovan Passport as a valid travel document for everyday entry to Russia under normal circumstances. However, the Kosovan Passport can be used to enter Russia in special cases such as to attend or participate in events under the auspices of the International Olympic Committee and other international sporting organisations, which Kosovo is a member of. Russia issues visas in the form of special forms inserted into the Kosovan Passports. The Russian Embassy in Belgrade published a statement about use of the Kosovan Passport in Russia: > \\"It is only possible to enter the territory of the Russian Federation with > passports of the so-called Republic of Kosovo in cases based on the > fulfilment of international obligations of the Russian Federation as a side- > recipient of an event, which is organised through multilateral structures, > whose member or participant is the so-called Republic of Kosovo... For other > purposes, the procedure of entry of persons with Kosovo passports to the > territory of Russia has not changed. Namely, their entry is not possible.\\"  Serbia  Kosovo passport stamps cancelled by Serbian immigration officers to demonstrate its non-recognition of Kosovo's secession. Serbia does not recognise Kosovo as an independent state, nor does it recognise the Kosovan passport as a valid travel document. However, citizens of the Republic of Kosovo can freely enter Serbia and stay for 90 days with a valid identity card. When the issuing of new Kosovan visas and passport stamps began in 2008, Serbia refused entry to people with entry and exit stamps of the Republic of Kosovo customs authority stamps or visas in their passports. In addition, border crossings from third countries (Montenegro, Albania, North Macedonia through land, many more through air travel) to Kosovo were considered illegal points of entry by Serbia, and it had created problems if one entered through there and then attempted to leave Serbia through another border crossing in Central Serbia or Vojvodina without a corresponding entry stamp. That practice, however, was soon abandoned and these are now simply over-stamped (nullified), which potentially could create new problems with long term Kosovan visas being annulled.

By the beginning of the 20th century it had spread through much of Lombardy; it is now raised in most parts of mainland Italy, particularly the province of Teramo in Abruzzo, where more than 80% of the registered stock are kept. The Bergamasca is also present in Brazil, Serbia and Venezuela. It is raised principally for meat, and is often used for cross-breeding with other meat breeds to improve meat yield. In Lombardy, it is traditionally raised by transhumant management: the herds spend the summers on the alpine pasture, and over-winter in the Po valley. It is one of the seventeen autochthonous Italian sheep breeds for which a genealogical herdbook is kept by the Associazione Nazionale della Pastorizia, the Italian national association of sheep-breeders. In 1983 the breed was estimated to number 95,000 head, of which 7900 were registered in the herdbook. In 2013 the registered stock numbered 12,042, of which 9833 were in the province of Teramo. Characteristics The Bergamasca is white. Rams weigh and grow to at the withers on average. At maturity on average, ewes weigh and grow to at the withers.

He was a pioneer in the development of structural prefabricated and reinforced concrete.Day, p. 284 Coignet was the first to use iron-reinforced concrete as a technique for constructing building structures.\\"François Coignet\\" Encyclopædia Britannica  Biography  Coignet, along with his brothers Louis (b. 1819) and Stephane (b. 1820), took over the family business of a chemical plant in Lyon in 1846. In 1847 he built some concrete houses using poured cement that was not reinforced with any iron. Coignet married Clarisse Gauthier in 1850. A year later, he decided to settle near Paris, in the Saint-Denis neighborhood. There in 1852 he opened a second plant where he obtained a patent for cement clinker. Coignet then built a cement factory there using exposed lime walls. He followed the pisé de terre system, rammed earth method of construction, in building the plant. This was his first time he worked with this method in concrete. Later he took out a patent in England entitled \\"Emploi de Beton\\" which gave details of his construction techniques.Sutherland, p. 13 Coignet started experimenting with iron-reinforced concrete in 1852 and was the first builder ever to use this technique as a building material.Encyclopædia Britannica (1993), p. 323 The first use of iron-reinforced concrete was by the French builder François Coignet in Paris in the 1850s. He decided as a publicity stunt, and for promotional purposes of his cement business, to build a house made of béton armé, a type of reinforced concrete. In 1853 he built the first iron reinforced concrete structure anywhere, a four-story house at 72 rue Charles Michels. This location was near his family cement plant in St. Denis, a commune in the northern suburbs of Paris. The house was designed by local architect Theodore Lachez.Collins, p. 28 File:NY n LI Coignet Stone jeh.jpgNew York office of Coignet Company File:Saint-Denis - Maison François Coignet -1.JPG72 rue Charles-Michels in 2010 File:Masion Coignet 1.jpgFacing east and north File:Maison François Coignet 2.jpgFacing south and east This house was inspected in 1855 by a committee of fourteen architects led by Henri Labrouste. In Labrouste’s report he said that all the work for the house was done entirely of cement and artificial stone. It also showed that Coignet made use of different materials of little value and mixed with lime and water to make decorative moldings and cornice that crowned the building. The railing was also a molded concrete mass. He had taken out a patent in March of that year entitled Béton Économique which showed how inexpensive aggregates could be used in concrete. He then proceeded to build several more concrete houses that still stand to this day. This report showed that Coignet made a concrete mixture of ash and slag with lime and used the mud in rammed earth method of construction. The report said it had doubts of the soundness of Coignet's techniques and that it could be dangerous. The house has been abandoned for many years and squatters have taken over the property from time to time. While it has deteriorated, it still stands going into the twenty-first century - some 150 years later! The now famous house, classed as a world patrimony, has been classified a historical monument since 1998.La première maison en béton de France: la maison François Cognet à Saint-Denis Coignet had an exhibit at the 1855 Paris Exposition to show his technique of reinforced concrete. At the exhibit he forecasted that the technique would replace stone as a means of construction. In 1856 he patented a technique of reinforced concrete using iron tirants. In 1861 he put out a publication on his techniques. Coignet is the inventor of moulded concrete which is known as Béton Coignet. He had much success at building with this type of concrete. He became a renowned building contractor and showed his many designs, including the molded concrete church of Le Vésinet near Paris. This church with its 130-foot spire is the first modern monumental building built in concrete.Collins, p. 33  Construction projects  One of Coignet's largest projects was the eighty seven miles of \\"aqueduct de la Vanne\\" (Paris metropolitan water supply) with over four miles of arches of over 100 foot high spans. He built the aqueduct between 1867 and 1874. Aqueduc de la Vanne Coignet also helped construct the lighthouse of Port Said (Egypt) and the high retaining walls of the Passy Cemetery and Trocadéro Cemetery in Paris.Concrete and constructional engineering, p. 159 File:Egypt- IMG 0960.jpgLighthouse of Port Said Port Said, Egypt File:Cimetiere de Passy walls.jpgPassy Cemetery walls Paris, France File:Trocadero and cemetery.jpgTrocadéro and cemetery Paris, France File:Saint Jean de Luz 002.jpg File:Sea wall at Saint Jean de Luz.jpg Coignet built sea wall at Saint-Jean-de-Luz (1857–1893)Answers.com - François Coignet  See also  * Edmond Coignet * Reinforced concrete  Notes  References  * Collins, Peter et al., Concrete: the vision of a new architecture, McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP, 2004, * Day, Lance, Biographical Dictionary of the History of Technology, Routledge, 2003, * Encyclopædia Britannica, 1993, The New Encyclopædia Britannica: micropaedia: ready reference, Edition: 15, illustrated, * Sutherland, R.

Its circulation as of mid-2007 was about 50,000. It existed between 1960 and 2013. History The first issue of Wisconsin Tales & Trails magazine appeared in spring 1960, in Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin. The founder and first editor was Leroy GoreLeroy Gore whose purpose was \\"to make Wisconsin so irresistible that outsiders couldn't stay away and insiders couldn't bear the thought of leaving.\\" A year later, Gore sold the magazine to Howard and Nancy Mead, who began publishing it from the basement of their Madison home. Under the Meads' direction, the magazine covered everything from outdoor sports to Wisconsin lore. Over the years, readers got to know the Meads and their children through the pages of the magazine. The Meads shortened the name to Wisconsin Trails in 1971. In 1982, the magazine began accepting advertising. In 1998, Scott Klug, a former Republican congressman from Wisconsin, and a group of investors bought the magazine and built a small publishing company, Trails Media Group, around it. Klug acquired or started a number of other properties, including Milwaukee Home, Corporate Report Wisconsin, Wisconsin Meetings, MadGuide, and No Limits magazines; Trails Books, which published regional guides and calendars; and a custom publishing division. Klug moved the company from Madison to Black Earth in 2000. Other editors during this time included Kate Bast and Harriet Brown. Big Earth Publishing bought Trails Books in 2005. In early 2007, Klug sold off all divisions of the company. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel bought Wisconsin Trails and Milwaukee Home (name changed to Milwaukee Home and Fine Living) magazines in February 2007, and made them part of its new Specialty Media Division, which also includes MetroParentMetroParent Milwaukee Moms. and other publications.Milwaukee Biz Journals In August 2007, Wisconsin Trails moved back to offices in Madison.

It is the third entry of the Syberia series which follows the adventures of American lawyer Kate Walker as she travels across Siberia. Plot After abandoning the island of Syberia, Kate Walker finds herself adrift on a makeshift boat, rescued by the Youkol people. Determined to escape their common enemies, she decides to help the nomads fulfill their odd ancestral tradition, as they accompany their snow ostriches on their seasonal migration. The game takes the player through the charming town of Valsembor, the voyage on a ship named Krystal, through an abandoned theme park in Baranour, which was tragically destroyed by nuclear fallout and radiation still blocks off parts of the park. Eventually, Kate helps the Youkols find their lost temple and grants them access to the snow ostrich breeding grounds across a bridge. Kate is captured by Olga Efimova and taken back to the clinic, leaving her fate unknown. Development On 1 April 2009, Microïds announced that Syberia 3 was being developed and aimed to be released on Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 3 in June 2010 as a real-time 3D game. The company had stated that the game would miss its original June 2010 release date because negotiations with Benoît Sokal were under way and Microïds was then acquired by Anuman. On 17 April 2010, another press release was issued, explaining that the Microsoft Windows version will be released, but the PlayStation 3 version may not, due to problems with Sony. Microïds had also asked that fans of Syberia send them emails of support for the game. In an interview given in February 2011, Sokal revealed that work on the game had not started due to a lack of funding. In November 2012, Microïds revealed that Sokal had officially signed a contract with Anuman to write the story of Syberia 3, the development had started and the game will be overseen by Elliot Grassiano, the original founder of Microïds. The game was scheduled for release in 2014-2015. On 21 August 2013, it was announced that the game had gone into production. The game's first screenshots were shown on 13 August 2014, and the stated release was given as of 2015 on Microsoft Windows, OS X, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, iOS and Android. The game was released in April 2017, dubbed in English, French, German, Polish and Russian, with subtitles in Italian, Spanish, Dutch, Czech, Korean and Chinese. In November 2017, a DLC file was released entitled \\"An Automaton with a Plan\\", where the player acts as the automaton Oscar.  Reception  Syberia 3 received \\"mixed or average\\" reviews, according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. Elise Favis's scored the game 5/10 on Game Informer and said \\"The Syberia series is a product of its time, and Syberia 3 doesn’t bring back any excitement. It is plagued by bugs, a disappointing storyline, cliché characters, and puzzles that are more frustrating than fun. This return fails to do the series justice, feeling more like an unpolished and dated adventure game instead of a revival.\\" GameSpots Michael Highham scored the game 4/10 and concluded: \\"Slivers of enjoyment and potential are found within a disconnected and underwhelming journey. The characters, their interactions, the way they speak, and the reason they even exist all mash into a puzzle-adventure game devoid of significance or impact. The Syberia series deserved a better return, otherwise, it should've been left in the past.\\" PC Gamers Fraser Brown scored the game 30/100, saying \\"Some solid puzzles can't rescue what is an otherwise terrible adventure game.\\" Fraser criticized the game for its disconnected story, poor graphics and animation, subpar translation to English, awkward voice acting and unmitigated software bugs that severely damage the gaming experience.

He was also a military historian and author of three books, as well as numerous magazine articles dealing primarily with his experiences as a prisoner of war in the Philippines and in Japan from 1942 to 1945. Early life Olson was born at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, on November 27, 1917, the only son of Hans Oscar and Clara (Nee Carr) Olson. He grew up primarily in Holly Springs, Mississippi. After graduating from high school, he attended Marion Military Academy (Alabama) for a year before earning a Congressional appointment to West Point. Upon graduation in 1939 he was deployed to Fort William McKinley in the Philippines as a Second Lieutenant. World War II As the Japanese invasion of the Philippines began in 1941, Olson was assigned to the 57th Infantry Regiment of the Philippine Scouts on the Bataan Peninsula. The U.S. forces in the Philippines were ordered to surrender to the Japanese in April, 1942. Olson was captured and joined more than 9600 U.S. soldiers and nearly 50,000 Filipinos who made up what came to be known as the Bataan Death March. He was first imprisoned at Camp O'Donnell prison where he was appointed Assistant to the Adjutant, keeping secret records for the prison. Before being transferred to Cabanatuan prison, in June, 1942, he managed to bury all his reports in the nearby jungle. In 1948 he returned, exhumed those records, and nearly four decades later used them to write his history of the camp. Shortly before leaving Camp O'Donnell, he and another prisoner were given a sack of cement and ordered to create a monument to the soldiers who died on the Bataan Peninsula. Before starting to work, he was ordered elsewhere. But years later, while conducting research on the war, Olson came across a photo of General Douglas MacArthur pointing to a small cross in the brush. It turned out to be the work of the other soldier, whose name Olson cannot recall. Thirty years later Olson headed up an effort that managed to raise enough funds to bring the cross to the U.S. where it is now on display at the National Prisoner of War Museum, Andersonville, Georgia. After transport to Japan in November 1942, Olson was imprisoned at the Osaka Seiko Company steel mill in Osaka, Japan where he spent the remainder of the war in forced labor, until being moved to Oeyama before the onset of U.S. bombing raids. Liberated in September, 1945, he traveled to Kyoto, Japan where he stayed at the Miyako Hotel, overlooking the city, and was given the Emperor's Penthouse Suite, which he wrote about in an article published in the October 1983 issue of The Retired Officer, \\"I Slept in the Emperor's Bed.\\" Post-War experience Back in the United States, Olson married Harriette Marshall (daughter of Major General Richard J. Marshall, a member of Douglas MacArthur's staff on Corregidor Island). The two had met en route to the Philippines just before the war. The Olsons had five children, including scientist-turned-filmmaker Randy Olson. Col. Olson served as J-3 advisor in the early 1960s in Vietnam. He retired as a full colonel in 1967. He later became Vice President of Black and Veatch Consulting Engineers as Director of International Marketing. After his second retirement, he set to work fulfilling the vow he had made after World War II to eventually write a book about his Camp O'Donnell experiences. In 1985 he self-published his first book, \\"O'Donnell: Andersonville of the Pacific\\", in which he drew parallels between Camp O'Donnell and the Civil War Confederate prison, Andersonville—the two prisons represent the two highest levels of mortality in history for U.S. POW's. In both cases, the cause of the high mortality was primarily disease due to unsanitary conditions brought on by overcrowding and poor administration. In the following years he published three more books, wrote numerous articles, and became a popular authority on the history of the Philippine Scouts. On May 24, 2008 he was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Philippine Scouts Heritage Society. His military awards include, among others, the Silver Star, the Bronze Star Medal, the Order of Merit, and the Army Commendation Medal with one Oak Leaf Cluster.

Captain Jeremiah Brown was given command of the Invincible on March 12, 1836, in Galveston. Captain Brown was tasked with defending the Texas coast, and neutralizing the Mexican brig Montezuma. The Invincible cruised south to the mouth of the Rio Grande, where on April 3, 1836, she encountered the ten-gun Mexican brig in the Port of Matamoros (also known as Brazos Santiago, now Boca Chica) at the mouth of the Laguna Madre. Battle The Texan ship was outgunned, outmanned, outnumbered and outplanned. The Montezuma had two 68-pounder guns, eight 32-pounder Paixhans guns, and had a crew of about 75 men. The Paixhans guns fired a shell that exploded on impact, creating a shower of shrapnel over the target. The Invincible had two 18-pounder guns, two 9-pounder guns, and four 6-pounder guns and carried a smaller crew than Montezuma. At 10:00 am the Invincible approached the Montezuma and raised the Texas colors, and Captain Jeremiah Brown ordered his artillerists to open fire on the Montezuma. For a short while the two warships exchanged broadsides, scoring some hits. Invincible outmaneuvered Montezuma by sailing in circles around the Mexican vessel, firing broadsides the entire time. Invincible made only two passes before the slower Mexican cruiser was in flames. Eventually the Montezuma ran aground on a sandbar, sealing her fate. The Mexican officers and crew quickly escaped into the water from the severely damaged vessel and made it ashore on the enemy coast. The Invincible continued to barrage her opponent until she was destroyed. Casualties are unknown. Aftermath The Texans emerged victorious, having destroyed the Montezuma. Later that day, the Invincible encountered an American merchant vessel, the Pocket. After engaging and capturing the Pocket, Captain Brown discovered a cache of weapons, as well as supplies being shipped to the Mexican Army. Accompanying the supplies were Mexican naval officers and a considerable amount of military documents, all in Spanish. The Pocket was sent to Galveston under a prize crew. The supplies aboard the Pocket were sent to General Sam Houston's army, where the general used them against the Mexicans at San Jacinto. This action by the Texas Navy of disrupting the Mexican army's maritime based supply chain, operating through the Port of Matamoros, was a significant factor in the Mexicans' later defeat at San Jacinto, Texas. Their vastly superior army was forced to scatter into several smaller units in order to procure food throughout Texas, thus diluting their numerical advantage. ReferencesSources * Neu, C.T.

A member of the Democratic Party, he was appointed by newly-installed Governor Mark Parkinson. Findley previously served as the Kansas State Representative for the 46th district from 1995 to 2003 and Chief of Staff to the Governor of Kansas from 2005 until 2009. As Kansas Lieutenant Governor, Findley chaired both the Governor's Energy Cabinet Team and Governor's Recovery Act Advisory Group. He was also a member of the Midwest Cancer Alliance Partner Advisory Board. A native Kansan, he was raised and educated in Lawrence and graduated from the University of Kansas in 1990. After college he worked in the grocery, retail and banking industry before his election to the Kansas House of Representatives in November 1994. Findley, a moderate, won election despite a nationwide loses for the Democratic Party, specifically in both houses of the United States Congress. Education and early career Findley was born on July 11, 1964, in Lawrence, Kansas. He was educated in the Lawrence Public Schools and attended Lawrence High School. Findley attended the University of Kansas and graduated in 1990 with a bachelor's degree in political science. He received his real estate license from the Kansas Association of Realtors in 1995. Following college, Findley held a number of positions in Kansas politics and later worked at UMB Bank in Lawrence. State legislature Findley was first elected to the Kansas House of Representatives on November 8, 1994 to represent District 46, which includes parts of Douglas County. He replaced retiring, longtime State Representative Betty Jo Charlton and was subsequently elected to five consecutive terms. In the Kansas House, Findley led efforts to initiate early childhood education programs for at-risk four-year-olds and to establish multi-year financing for public schools. Concerned with the rising cost of a college education, Findley also authored legislation to tie increases in tuition to increases in the state's grant program. Findley also co-sponsored legislation to create a Kansas version of the Earned Income Tax Credit, similar to legislation passed by the U.S. Congress in 1975, which helps ease the burden of income taxes on low-income families. During the 1999 budget debate, Findley voted for the 10-year transportation plan that is largely credited for Kansas’ recent number one ranking for having the nation's best highways. In the same session, he crossed party lines to support Republican Governor Bill Graves’ budget, which included the creation of a Children's Trust Fund. Findley was a member of the House Democratic Leadership Team serving as Policy Chair. His committee assignments included: Financial Institutions and Insurance; Economic Development; Ethics and Elections; Federal and State Affairs; and Taxation. He also served as Ranking Minority Member of the Congressional Redistricting Committee during the 2001–2002 Sessions. He was elected to his fifth term in the Kansas House of Representatives on November 5, 2002 but declined to take the oath of office in order to work for Governor Sebelius as a Legislative Liaison in January 2003. Legislative Liaison Upon her ascension to the governorship, Kathleen Sebelius hired Findley as her Legislative Liaison to the Kansas House of Representatives. While Findley served in this capacity, the Sebelius Administration shepherded through government austerity and efficiency measurers that eliminated the state's $1.1 billion deficit, without raising taxes. Chief of Staff On July 18, 2005 Governor Sebelius appointed Findley as her chief of staff. In this capacity, Findley was responsible for policy development and implementation. During the 2006 legislative session, the Sebelius Administration led efforts that resulted in the largest increase in K-12 education funding in state history. Findley's responsibilities also included serving as the Governor's chief liaison on emergency management matters. In 2007, Kansas was impacted by a series of major weather-related disasters ranging from ice storms, to floods and tornadoes. On May 4, 2007, an F5 tornado devastated the town of Greensburg, Kansas. Findley assisted in the state government's response. With encouragement from the Sebelius Administration, the residents of Greensburg embarked on an effort to rebuild their town using renewable and efficient building methods. Lieutenant Governor of KansasAppointment= On April 28, 2009, then-Governor Kathleen Sebelius was confirmed by the United States Senate as the 21st Secretary of Health and Human Services. Lieutenant Governor Mark Parkinson was sworn in as Kansas's 45th governor on the same day. Troy Findley is sworn in as the 48th Lieutenant Governor of Kansas On May 14, 2009, Governor Parkinson appointed Findley as the state's 48th lieutenant governor. Parkinson cited Findley's fitness for office and bipartisan record in his remarks at the swearing in ceremony. =Responsibilities= Findley's responsibilities as lieutenant governor include serving as the senior strategic advisor to the governor and, as prescribed by the Kansas Constitution, serving as acting governor when Parkinson is out of the state. In addition to those responsibilities, Findley chairs both the Governor's Energy Cabinet Team and the Governor's Recovery Act Advisory Group. He is also the Governor's designee to the Midwest Cancer Alliance Partner Advisory Board. =2010 Legislative Session= In the first months of the Parkinson-Findley Administration, state revenues slipped significantly as the global economic downturn took a toll on the state's income tax returns. Because the Kansas Constitution requires a balanced budget, Governor Parkinson instituted over $1 billion in spending cuts using his allotment authority, more than any governor in Kansas history. During the 2010 legislative session, the Parkinson-Findley Administration led a bipartisan coalition of Democrats and moderate Republicans on a successful effort to balance the budget without additional cuts to schools, Medicaid, law enforcement and other social services. In the same session, the Parkinson- Findley Administration spearheaded successful efforts to pass a 10-year, $8.4 billion comprehensive transportation plan. Other significant legislation included passage of primary seatbelt law, a ban on texting while driving, a statewide indoor smoking ban, as well as increased penalties for drunk drivers. =Post Session= In the final months of the Parkinson-Findley Administration, Findley has focused on expanding renewable energy and energy efficiency opportunities in Kansas. As chair of the Governor's Energy Cabinet Team, Findley has actively supported efforts to build the transmission lines in Western Kansas that will enable the region to generate and export renewable energy. The Energy Cabinet Team's final report indicated positive growth in the renewable energy sector during the Parkinson/Findley Administration and encouraged the next administration to continue their pro-renewable energy policies. Personal Findley lives in Topeka with his wife, Jennifer. They have a son, Zachary.

The game was based on the 1970s hit TV show Happy Days and the slogan was \\"TV's hottest name, Your hottest game.\\" The game itself was simply a rebranded variant of Sega's earlier 1976 game Moto-Cross, also known as Man T.T. (released August 1976),http://www.arcade- history.com/?n=man-t.t.&page;=detail&id;=26084 in a customized arcade cabinet. In turn, Moto-Cross and Man T.T. were motorbike variants of Road Race, a car driving game released in February 1976.http://www.arcade-history.com/?n=road- race&page;=detail&id;=14493 Sega was allowed to rebrand their game as Fonz because its American branch at the time was owned by Charles Bluhdorn's Gulf+Western Company and thus had access to Paramount Television's intellectual property. Overview Moto-Cross / Fonz is an early black-and- white motorbike racing game, most notable for introducing an early three- dimensional third-person perspective. Both versions of the game display a constantly changing forward-scrolling road and the player's bike in a third- person perspective where objects nearer to the player are larger than those nearer to the horizon, and the aim was to steer the vehicle across the road, racing against the clock, while avoiding any on-coming motorcycles or driving off the road. The game also introduced the use of haptic feedback, which caused the motorcycle handlebars to vibrate during a collision with another vehicle.Mark J. P. Wolf (2008), The video game explosion: a history from PONG to PlayStation and beyond, p. 39, ABC-CLIO, Gameplay Arcade Cabinet Fonz The general premise has the player controlling the Fonz on a motorcycle with handlebars on the cabinet. The player has to go as fast as possible without skidding off the road or colliding with other racing bikes on the screen. Turn the handlebars, and the bike will corner and bank. Twist the handle throttle open, and it will accelerate. When a collision with another bike occurs, the handlebars vibrate and the screen flashes a reverse image. To increase the challenge, the size of the bike can be regulated by the operator. Game time is adjustable from 45 to 100 seconds.

After college, Greenfield began writing poetry and songs in the 1950s while working in a civil service job. Since 1971, she has published more than 40 children's books, including picture books, novels, poetry and biographies.

Linda Metzger (1987), pp. 215–18 Dismayed by the depiction of blacks and black communities in popular media, Greenfield has focused her work on realistic but positive portrayals of African-American communities, families and friendships. These relationships are emphasized in Sister (1974) a young girl copes with the death of a parent with the help of other family members, Me and Nessie (1975) about best friends, My Daddy and I (1991) and Big Friend, Little Friend (1991) about mentoring. Her first book, Bubbles (1972), \\"sets the tone for much of Greenfield's later work: Realistic portrayals of loving African American parents working hard to provide for their families, and the children who face life's challenges with a positive outlook.\\" In She Come Bringing Me that Little Baby Girl (1974), a boy deals with feelings of envy and learns to share his parents' love when his baby sister arrives.

That group's goal was to encourage the writing and publishing of African-American literature. She was writer-in-residence at the District of Columbia Commission on the Arts and Humanities in 1985-86 and taught creative writing in schools under grants from the Commission. She has also lectured and given free workshops on writing of African-American children's literature.
