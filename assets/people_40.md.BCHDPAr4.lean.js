It was designed and built between 1899 and 1900 by W. H. Lynn as a department store and warehouse, owned by the firm of Robertson, Ledlie, Ferguson & Co. It stands on the site of a bank erected in 1785, from which it takes its name. Since 1979, it has been owned by the Dublin-based company Primark, and serves as their flagship store in Northern Ireland. On 28 August 2018, during a £30 million two-year renovation, the building was gutted by fire, severely damaging most of the internal structure. Primark opted to restore the building to its 1900 appearance while expanding the size of the store, a process that will last until at least 2022. History First building = The first Bank Buildings was a three storey building designed by Sir Robert Taylor and erected by Waddell Cunningham between 1785 and 1787, known as Cunningham’s Bank. The bank closed in 1798 and the building was converted to residential use, becoming the residence of the Church of Ireland bishop of Down and Connor, Rev. Dr. William Dickson. The site of the bank was known as a place for public executions, with the last execution being carried out in 1816, on the doorstep of the building. = Second building = In 1853, the store became home to a wholesale drapery firm. The original building was replaced in 1855 by a four storey building for Hawkins, Robertson & Co. The business was formed into a limited liability company in 1880. Founded by businessmen William Robertson and Henry Hawkins (Waterford), J. C. Ledlie (Cork), and Robert Ferguson (Belfast), the business soon expanded and became a commercial department store. = Third building = The Bank Buildings, along the left of the image, circa 1900 The best known Bank Buildings were constructed between 1899 and 1900. The architect W. H. Lynn allowed for large plate glass windows to be installed in the lower floors. The department store continued to operate on the first two floors whilst the upper floors were used as a warehouse for the wholesale side of the business. The building remained under the ownership of Robertson, Ledlie, Ferguson & Co. until the House of Fraser group took control of the company in 1969. The department store still continued to operate from Bank Buildings until Boots took over from House of Fraser. Boots was then forced to move out in 1975. On 9 April 1975, three bombs were detonated inside Bank Buildings, starting a fire that extensively damaged the building. Refurbishments were carried out in 1979 and after 18 months the new owners, Primark Stores Limited established a store. They remain the current owners of the Bank Buildings. = Extension and refurbishment = In 2016, Primark announced it was expanding the building by 30,000 sq ft and refurbishing it, creating 100 new jobs once completed. The expansion cost an estimated £30m and was expected to be completed in September 2018. Commonwealth House, which occupied 29-43 Castle Street was demolished between September 2016 and April 2017 and the extension was built in its place. = August 2018 Fire and restoration = Bank Buildings after the August 2018 fire. On 28 August 2018, a fire broke out at roughly 11:00 BST near the roof of the building during business hours. Shoppers and staff were evacuated from the ground and first floors, and 11 fire appliances were called. The area around was cordoned off for public safety, and due to falling debris. The roof collapsed and the clock face was burnt out with the hands staying still at about 11:05. The fire was still spreading and had covered all floors of the building by 15:00 with more appliances called in to assist. The building suffered extensive damage to all levels, however the new wing of the building was relatively undamaged. In September 2018, a team was called in to remove rubble from the site believed to contain asbestos. In October 2018, Primark sent an application for planning permission to Belfast City Council, in order to completely restore the building to its original 1900 appearance. This work was green-lit on 26 October 2018, with the initial stages aimed at reducing the safety cordon due to commence \\"immediately\\". The upper two floors and roof level were taken down, which allowed a façade retention scheme to be put in place. The stonework recovered during the removal of the top two storeys will be numbered and labelled, to be reused later in reconstruction. The iconic clock face will also be removed for restoration and eventual reinstatement. On 3 December 2018, the area around Bank Buildings was reopened to pedestrians, with concrete-filled shipping containers being used to support the fragile facades, and to protect the public from any potential collapse. Demolition of the damaged interior structure was completed in late 2019. The site was visited by Prince Charles during the demolition works and met with builders, contractors and the fire service. Bank Buildings Football Club Representatives from the store attended the first ever meeting of the Northern Amateur Football League at Clarence Place Hall on 4 July 1923. The league was open to applications from public bodies, private associations, schools and firms. Although they originally submitted a team for the new league, Bank Buildings Football Club never played a competitive match. The club is, however, considered one of the founding members of the Amateur League.

The story focuses on backstory of one of the companion characters from Mass Effect 2. BioWare stated that the game would contain two hours of gameplay and would have \\"top down shooter action\\". BioWare also stated that the game, like the novels, would not be \\"required reading\\" for Mass Effect 2, meaning that players would still be able to enjoy Mass Effect 2 having only played Mass Effect. Gameplay Jacob is controlled by tilting the iPod Touch or iPhone and firing is done automatically. The game is played from a top-down perspective and the levels become more maze-like as the player progresses. Enemies can be locked on to, and additional moves can be performed by pressing buttons on the heads-up-display. It is possible to use Jacob's Biotic stasis ability to freeze enemies in place, or use an omni-tool to Sabotage enemy shields. Finally, Jacob can fire a missile that can take out multiple enemies within its blast radius. Conversations are depicted in comic book style panels and there are some opportunities for multiple-choice dialogue. Cutscenes are shown via animated comic book panels. If the player logs into their EA Online account using the Extras menu then completes the game, an unspecified reward is unlocked in Mass Effect 2 (provided that said game is linked to the same account). According to project director Casey Hudson, the reward is obtained via speaking with Jacob Taylor in Mass Effect 2.https://docs.google.com/View?id=dd78xshh_82cx7t67db Plot The story starts off with Jacob Taylor on vacation aboard a cruise ship. It is suddenly boarded by pirates and Jacob, utilizing his experience as a former Alliance soldier, fights the pirates off. The pirates turn out to be batarians. He is sent to the Citadel where he talks to his former commanding officer, Major Derek Izunami who assigns him to investigate the agenda of the batarians in the Terminus Systems and beyond. There is a big commotion at the Citadel because a batarian ambassador, Jath'Amon is visiting the Council soon to negotiate peace. Many people are worried by this, as terrorists are threatening to ruin the peace talks. Jacob has to meet a woman named Miranda Lawson in the Nemean Abyss to get his information but he is forced to deal with human pirates who have taken over Cartagena Station. The boss of these pirates is called \\"Black Eye\\" Clint Darragh and you can choose to let him surrender or you can kill him. Miranda is impressed and tells you what she knows. There are three leads. One is a turian arms smuggler named Illo Nazario who is hiding on Tortuga. He's been working with the batarians for several years and may know something. The second lead is information regarding the planet Bekke, where the batarians are building an army. This information is considered suspicious, as batarians form small terrorist cells as their preferred method of attack. The third lead is reports of human doctors and scientists being kidnapped by the batarians and being taken to the Ahn'Kedar Orbital Platform. It is implied they are being forced to work on a biological weapon. You can tackle these three missions in any order. On Bekke, Jacob must discover what this army is protecting. Miranda's scans reveal some kind of hazardous material which gets more potent the further Jacob progresses through the base. It is eventually revealed to be a large cache of Element Zero, which enhances Jacob's Biotic abilities but could kill him unless he leaves quickly. He is extracted and the eezo is stored safely. On the Ahn'Kedar Orbital Platform, Jacob discovers it has been taken over by batarians who are forcing the kidnapped scientist to work on something. He runs into Nax, a krogan who is searching for a missing asari scientist called Batha. The two decide to team up; Nax rescues Batha while Jacob saves the others. Nax distracts the batarians, allowing Jacob to sneak into the lab and confront the leader. The scientists claim that the batarians are dying of a blood plague and that they are working on a cure for them, but Jacob knows that this is a ruse. The batarians have engineered the disease themselves and are planning on unleashing it on the Citadel council, with the cure Batha has made as their defence. Miranda allows Batha to complete the cure on the ship but they must hurry to Tortuga to find Illo. Upon arrival, Jacob meets an informant of Miranda's; a salarian named Ish. Ish tells Jacob that Illo hasn't made any deals in a while and may be up to something. He gives Jacob the passcode to Illo's base and warns him of the thugs he has as bodyguards. Jacob infiltrates the base and confronts Illo. Meeting him reveals that he is dying of a biological weapon the batarians have tested on him and he won't tell Jacob anything until he gets the cure which Batha has made. They take him to the ship and cure him and he tells Jacob everything he knows. He reveals that the batarians have no qualms about unleashing the virus in the council meeting because not only do they have the vaccine, but the Ambassador Jath'Amon is the terrorist leader and he plans on infecting the council members himself. Jacob and Miranda rush to the Citadel where they foil the plan and save the council as well as hundreds of lives. Jath'Amon swears vengeance against Jacob and the human race and is escorted out by C-Sec. Jacob goes on another vacation and is surprised when Miranda joins him, a bottle of champagne in hand and a smirk on her face. Reception IGN scored Mass Effect Galaxy 5.0/10, calling the game rushed, with \\"clumsy controls and repetitive action.\\" The different art style of the game was noted as one of the game's positive points, but the animations were \\"weak,\\" and layout of the game was criticized as \\"uninteresting.\\" The reviewer concluded by advising readers to \\"Avoid this uninspired, un-fun game.\\" Pocketgamer thought the title was an \\"uninspired spin off\\" which was \\"light years from enjoyable\\". Their review concluded: \\"Like a black hole, inferior tilt-based action and forfeiture of the series' role-playing legacy devour expectations of a worthy extension to this lauded galactic epic.\\" It was given a 2.5/5 rating.https://www.pocketgamer.com/articles/014048/mass- effect-galaxy/ ReferencesExternal links *Official website Category:Role-playing video games Category:BioWare games Category:IOS games Category:IOS-only games Category:Mass Effect video games Category:Science fiction video games Category:Video games developed in Canada Category:Action role-playing video games Category:2009 video games de:Mass Effect#Mass Effect Galaxy ","title":"Mass Effect Galaxy"},{"id":"22879671","text":"This is a list of schools in Surrey, England.

56-3878 The 388th Electronic Combat Squadron is an inactive United States Air Force unit. Its last assignment was with the 366th Fighter Wing, based at Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, Washington. History Established in early 1942 as a light bomb squadron, equipped with Douglas A-24 Banshees, although equipped with export model Vultee A-31 Vengeance dive bombers for training. Trained under Third Air Force in the southeast United States, also used for antisubmarine patrols over the Atlantic southeast coast and then Gulf of Mexico. Deployed to Southern California in early 1943 to the Desert Warfare Center, trained in light bombing while supporting Army maneuvers in the Mojave Desert until October. Re-equipped with North American A-36 Apache dive bombers and deployed to New Guinea as part of Fifth Air Force. In the Southwest Pacific the squadron attacked Japanese strong points and tactical positions and targets of opportunity in support of general Douglas MacArthur's campaign along the north coast of New Guinea; then advancing into the Netherlands East Indies and Philippines as part of the Island Hopping campaign. It was re-equipped with Curtiss P-40 Warhawkss, and later with Douglas A-20 Havocs. Engaged in heavy fighting on Leyte, Mindoro and Luzon in the Philippines during 1944–1945. The squadron moved to Okinawa in mid-August and after the Atomic Bomb missions had been flown; remained on Okinawa until December until returning to the United States with most personnel demobilizing. It was inactivated as a paper unit on 6 January 1946. The squadron was reactivated as a Boeing B-29 Superfortress unit in the reserves in 1947, but lack of funding and personnel led to rapid inactivation. Transferred to Tactical Air Command in the mid-1950s and activated first with North American F-86 Sabres, then North American F-100 Super Sabres in 1958. Inactivated in 1959 when its parent 312th Tactical Fighter Wing was inactivated and replaced by the 27th Tactical Fighter Wing. Personnel and equipment of the squadron were transferred to the 524th Tactical Fighter Squadron. Reactivated in 1977 as a General Dynamics F-111A Aardvark training squadron; inactivated 1979. Reactivated in 1981 as an EF-111A Raven electronic warfare aircraft; inactivated 1982. Reactivated in 2004 flying Naval Grumman EA-6B Prowler electronic warfare aircraft. It was inactivated in 2010, being replaced by the 390th Electronic Combat Squadron.

Some recipes omit the crème de violette. It is served straight up, in a cocktail glass. History The Aviation was created by Hugo Ensslin, head bartender at the Hotel Wallick in New York, in the early twentieth century. The first published recipe for the drink appeared in Ensslin's 1916 Recipes for Mixed Drinks. Ensslin's recipe called for 1½ oz. El Bart gin, ¾ oz. lemon juice, 2 dashes maraschino liqueur, and 2 dashes crème de violette, a violet liqueur which gives the cocktail a pale purple color. Harry Craddock's influential Savoy Cocktail Book (1930) omitted the crème de violette, calling for a mixture of two-thirds dry gin, one-third lemon juice, and two dashes of maraschino. Many later bartenders have followed Craddock's lead, leaving out the difficult-to-find violet liqueur. Creme Yvette, a violet liqueur made with additional spices, is sometimes substituted for crème de violette.

The primary members of the family are the Z8030/Z8530, and the Z85233. Developed from the earlier Zilog SIO devices (Z8443), the SCC added a number of serial-to-parallel modes that allowed internal implementation of a variety of data link layer protocols like Bisync, HDLC and SDLC. The SCC could be set up as a conventional RS-232 port for driving legacy systems, or alternately as a RS-422 port for much higher performance, up to 10 Mbit/s. Implementation details generally limited performance to 5 Mbit/s or less. One of the most famous users of the SCC was the Apple Macintosh computer line, which used the Z8530 to implement two serial ports on the back of the early designs, labeled \\"modem\\" and \\"printer\\". Description Traditional serial communications are normally implemented using a device known as a UART, which translates data from the computer bus's internal parallel format to serial and back. This allows the computer to send data serially simply by placing data in memory in its own internal format, say 16-bit little-endian, and the UART will convert this to serial form and send it. Generally there were different UARTs for each computer architecture, with the goal of being as low-cost as possible. A good example is the Zilog Z-80 SIO from 1977, designed to work with the widely used Zilog Z-80 to provide two serial ports with relatively high speeds up to 800 kbit/s.\\"Zilog Z8440 Serial input/Output Controller\\", Zilog, 1977 The SCC is essentially an updated version of the SIO, with more internal logic to allow it to directly implement a number of common data link layer protocols. To start with, the SCC included a hardware implementation of the cyclic redundancy check (CRC), which allowed it to check, flag and reject improper data without the support of the host computer. Higher-level protocols included BiSync, HDLC and SDLC. HDLC is better known in its implementation in the modem-oriented LAPM protocol, part of V.42. By moving the implementation of these protocols to hardware, the SCC made it easy to implement local area networking systems, like IBM's SNA, without the need for the host CPU to handle these details. When used in traditional serial mode, the SCC could be set to use 5, 6, 7 or 8 bits/character, 1, 1/5 or 2 stop bits, odd, even or no parity, and automatically detected or generated break signals. In synchronous modes, data could be optionally sent with NRZ, NRZI or FM encoding, as well as Manchester decoding, although Manchester encoding had to be handled in external logic. The SCC's transmission rate could be timed from three sources. For basic RS-232-style communications, the SCC included an internal 300 Hz clock that could be multiplied by 1, 16, 32 to 64, providing data rates between 300 and 19,200 bit/s. Alternately, it could use the clock on the bus as provided by the host platform, and then divide that clock by 4, 8, 16 or 32 (the later two only in the original NMOS implementation). When used on a machine running at the common 8 MHz clock, this allowed for rates as high as 2 Mbit/s. Finally, the SCC also included inputs for the provision of an external clock. This worked similar to the host clock, but could be used to provide any reference clock signal, independent of the host platform. In this mode, the clock could be divided as in the internal case, or multiplied by 2 for even higher speeds, up to 32.3 Mbit/s in some versions. Using the external clock made it easy to implement LAN adaptors, which normally ran at speeds that were independent of the host computer. Early implementations used receive buffers that were only 3 bytes deep, and a send buffer with a single byte. This meant that the real- world performance was limited by the host platform's ability to continually empty the buffers into its own memory. With network-like communications the SCC itself could cause the remote sender to stop transmission when the buffers were full, and thereby prevent data loss while the host was busy. With conventional async serial this was not possible; on the Macintosh Plus this limited RS-232 performance to about 9600 bit/s or less, and as little as 4800 bit/s on earlier models. Most SCC models were available in either dual in-line package (DIP) or chip carrier (PLCC) versions. Versions ;Z8030 Original model implemented in NMOS with a multiplexed \\"Z-Bus\\" interface that matched the Zilog Z8000/Z16C00/8086 CPUs ;Z8530 Functionally identical to the Z8030, but using a non-multiplexed \\"Universal-Bus\\" designed to allow use with any CPU or host platform, including the Z-80 ;Z8031 and Z8531 Versions of the Z8030 and Z8530 with the synchronous support removed, producing a design more closely matching the original SIO\\"8530, 8531, Z8530, Z8531 Zilog Serial Communications Controller\\" ;Z80C30 and Z85C30 CMOS implementations of the Z8030 and Z8530.

Species characteristics  Tuberous comfrey flowers. Tuberous comfrey flowers from April to June, however it also reproduces asexually, that is vegetatively, having rhizomes that allow it to spread out from the original site, colonising and competing as it grows. This process continues into the autumn and the young clonal plants can be seen at this time of year, whilst the parent plants leaves are rotting down. Being very hardy, this plant is well able to survive northern winters.The Flora of Skye Both the stems and leaves are softly hairy, the leaves have deep veining.Medicinal uses The flowers themselves are a subtle pale creamy yellow, a significant characteristic for separating its identity from the purple flowered Russian Comfrey. The usual pollinators are the common carder bumble bee, honey bee,http://www.florabeilles.org/serie/symphytum-tuberosum_apis-mellifera and red mason bee. The stem and leaves are clothed with soft hairs. The stem usually remains unbranched and the leaves are distinctly veined with a clear reduction in size from top to base.

In Great Britain it is naturally less common in the south,Natural England and distribution maps show the species to be common in Scotland and present, but uncommon, throughout much of England and Wales.NBN Gateway The Isle of Skye now has a well- established and wide distribution thanks to planting, this has also occurred in Ireland.Flora of Ireland The North American west coast has a number of introduced S. tuberosum sites.  Medicinal uses  Vernacular common names such as 'knitbone' reveal the healing role that tuberous comfrey and the various hybrid comfreys have played in herbal medicine throughout the ages.Scottish plant uses In these traditional cures, the recipes make use of the leaves & roots, the former being used to speed up the healing of minor abrasions through their being applied directly to the damaged skin under a compress. Culinary uses In spring the fresh young leaves may be used as an herb in cooked recipes, however due to their hairy nature and mildly toxic properties they are not eaten raw. As with dandelion, the root makes a palatable and non-acidic alternative to coffee once prepared, roasted until brown & brittle, and grind it into a powder.

Founded in 1995, it is Anchorage, Alaska's first brewery and the second oldest in state history, following Alaska Brewing Co. in 1986. The brewery has been in their current location since May 2009, with a tap-house and full-service restaurant. MSBC has won several awards for their beers, including medals from the Great American Beer Festival and the World Beer Cup. The brewery sells its beers in 12-oz cans, 22-oz bottles, 5 gallon kegs, and 64 oz growlers. Their U.S. distribution is limited to AK, WA, ID, OR, CA, HI, and NY.  History  Mark Staples founded Midnight Sun Brewing Co. in 1995. Their original location on Arctic Boulevard shared an industrial space with Knight's Taxidermy, the business featured on reality television program, Mounted in Alaska. The brewery moved to its present location in South Anchorage in 2009, where it expanded brewery operations to 10,000 barrel capacity, increased customer seating, and began food service in The Loft. MSBC began pouring beer at Williwaw Social in downtown Anchorage in 2018, allowing patrons to enjoy more than the state-regulated 36oz pour limit imposed on Alaska breweries. The brewery has been a regular participant in Anchorage's First Fridays art walk, with their own First Firkin Fridays, featuring the works of different local artists in The Loft, each month. Specially brewed casks of conditioned beer are opened by the guest artist at the event. In 2016 the label art of Panty Peeler Belgian-Style Tripel Ale sparked attacks on social media which rose to the attention of national press. The World Beer Cup announced in 2017 that they would no longer accept entries which have 'sexist and lewd names', making Panty Peeler ineligible for both its label art and name. In 2009 Author Ben McFarland noted Panty Peeler as one of the best beers in the world.

It began on 27 May 2009 and ended on 22 January 2010. The story revolved around the orthodox practices that are prevalent even today in the Uttar Pradesh. This show airs on an Afghan television channel called Ariana TV, where the drama is translated into Dari Persian since 17 April 2011 to 15 January 2012.  Synopsis  Bela(Tanvi Bhatia), the protagonist, is the granddaughter of dictatorial Mamchand Chaudhry(Shahbaz Khan) : the ‘ruler’ of Ambakhedi in Uttar Pradesh. Mamchand rules with a rod of iron and forbids any lower caste person falling in love with an upper caste one. He is not fond of the daughters in the family, yet his youngest son has a daughter called Bela, whom he allows to live but treats her like an outsider. Bela falls in love with a lower caste man called Birju(Mohit Malhotra) whose parents were killed by Mamchand as his mother was upper caste and father lower caste. Bela’s auntie, Rajbala(Nigaar Khan), is an antagonist. She concocts a plan to catch Bela and Birju together and is successful. After Mamchand’s men beat up Birju, he vows to marry Bela off to an equally orthodox man called Bhanu who is of the upper caste and son of Kemchand Chaudhry. Bela and Birju escape from Mamchand with the help of Bela’s parents, Sargam and Raghav, who do not advocate Mamchand’s vile and evil doings. Mamchand manages to bring the pair back but is stopped from killing them by a revolution of the lower caste people. Birju fights with Bela’s oldest uncle, the main antagonist, and Nirbhay(Manish Wadhwa) and Nirbhay are shot dead. Nirbhay’s widow Rajbala vows to remove her marital garments when her husband’s killer’s corpse is in front of her. Birju is thrown in jail. Mamchand is quick to capitalise on Birju’s imprisonment and marries Bela off to Adharv Chaudhry -- a relative of Rajbala. At the same time, the police announce that they have shot Birju dead, yet his body is nowhere to be found. Bela soon finds out that Adharv was only interested in marrying her because he’s impotent and wants his servant Charan to rape her for them to have a child. Adharv’s first wife reveals this to Bela when Birju turns up at Adharv’s house under his new persona of Birjbushan Singh who befriends Adharv and stays at Bela’s marital home, whilst tormenting her to leave Adharv. Birjbushan manages to convince most of the Chaudhry household that he is not Birju except for Rajbala, who is adamant that Birjbushan is her husband’s murderer. He then scams Mamchand’s second son, Abhay, who loses all the family wealth. Mamchand is forced to sell his mansion to settle his debts, and his house ends up in the hands of Birjbushan. Abhay finally reveals he had his older brother Nirbhay murdered so he could inherit all the fortune of the Chaudhry family. His parents, Mavhiri(Swati Chitnis) and Mamchand, are stunned to find that the lower caste Birju is not their enemy but is in fact their own son. Then, Abhay took the pistol to shoot his father (Mamchand), then Birju saved him. Abhay is sent to jail and Mamchand finally accepts Bela as his granddaughter. He vows to carry out her marriage ceremony with Birju in front of the whole village. Rajbala also mellows and removes her marital garments then she was apologising to Birju for accusing him as her husband's murderer. Mamchand realizes that truly girls are the 'angels' of the house meaning they are very pious and obedient, although he didn't give his granddaughter the freedom she required. He believed that idea about his dranddaughter out of being disappointed to love his sons because his second son, Abhay, betrayed him. Mamchand always gave his first and second sons the advantages, and his son Abhay betrayed his father and his older brother, Nirbhy. Mamchand comprehends the humanity of not differentiating low- caste and high-caste people. As low caste Birju saved him from a high caste trying to kill him, which was actually his own son. The drama ends with a tearful and regretful Mamchand embracing his granddaughter and Birju in his arms. To pay for all his bad actions, Mamchand announced to abolish the old traditions of differentiating between low and high caste people. Thus, low and high caste people now could have same rights. Thus, Bela and Birju achieved success in love finally and their marriage was made after all the diffulties they faced.  Cast Main characters= * Tanvi Bhatia ...

It has its own zip code of 30111 and is the hometown of Novelty and Country singer Ray Stevens. Clarkdale is an industrial textile mill village built in 1932 to support a spinning mill of the Coats & Clark Thread Company. Both the mill and the neighborhood, consisting of 98 dwellings (a mixture of single-family and duplex floorplans), were designed by North Carolina architect Joseph Emory Sirrine. The neighborhood boasted many modern conveniences for the time, such as electricity and indoor plumbing. Additionally, residents enjoyed a public swimming pool, a community house for public functions, and a mill-sponsored baseball team. As the mill thrived, the community fostered the growth of several local business, a dedicated post office, and two churches, both of which still hold religious services as of 2020. Layoffs in the 1950s and 1960s preceded the mill's closing in 1983; in 1966, the homes were sold to current residents, many of whom were current or former employees of the mill. In 1987 Clarkdale was listed in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). During the historic September 2009 Atlanta floods, Clarkdale Elementary School (part of Cobb County Public Schools) was ruined by Noses Creek in the hours after students and faculty evacuated. Although outside the 100-year flood plain, massive rainfall and upstream land development caused the stream to swell to more than ten times its normal height, also flooding other locations in Clarkdale. The new Clarkdale Elementary School opened at a different location in August 2012.

Michael Anderson directed Chase a Crooked Shadow, the first film produced by Associated Dragon Films, a business venture of Douglas Fairbanks Jr. Plot In her family's Spanish villa, Kimberly Prescott (Baxter), a young South African heiress of a diamond company, is grieving after her father's recent suicide, when she is taken aback by the arrival of a man (Todd) claiming to be her brother Ward, believed to have died in a car accident a few months ago. Kimberly calls the police but the man has a driving licence, passport and letter from the bank in the name of Ward Prescott. Even two photos from upstairs look like the man now in her house. The local police chief, Vargas, leaves, believing Kim to be unstable. The next day Kim is woken by an unknown woman who says she is Mrs Whitman, a friend of Ward's. Kim's maid has been given time off. A butler has also been installed in the house. Kim attempts to contact Uncle Chan who knows both her and the real Ward, but when Chan finally shows up he greets the imposter as if he were the real Ward. Kim suspects the imposter may be after her inheritance and later in the plot, he and Mrs Whitman try to get Kim to sign a will. However, there is also a conversation whereby \\"Ward\\" says he suspects Kim of having stolen diamonds from their late father's company's vault. He has a record of flights she took that leave a gap in her itinerary. Eventually Kim admits she took the diamonds to Tangiers. \\"Ward\\" and Mrs Whitman then get her to sign an introduction for \\"Ward\\" as her agent to the bank in Tangiers. Kim tries to escape to the beach house below the main villa. Someone has followed her and she almost shoots him with a spear gun. It is Vargas. She shows him the will and he starts to believe her story. He suggests she provide him with something holding \\"Ward\\"'s fingerprints as he cannot fake these. She is able to do this after meeting \\"Ward\\" on the terrace. They drink brandy and flirt until \\"Ward\\" is on the phone and Mrs Whitman has gone upstairs. Kim goes to the beach house and takes a metal box from the chimney. She sneaks back up to the villa and tries to leave through the front door. Uncle Chan blocks her path. Her captors take her to the terrace and open the box. With the diamonds on the table they demand she sign the will. Then 'Ward' suggests they go for a swim. Mrs Whitman suggests they take a boat. Kim assumes they plan to drown her and runs into the house. Then Vargas arrives. She begs him to save her as the others have threatened to drown her. She thinks he will reveal the man to be an imposter but he says the fingerprints are a match for her brother. At this point Kim has a meltdown and starts saying that her brother has to be dead \\"because I killed him\\". She says she cut the brakes on his car and followed, to see him drive to his death off a cliff. Once she has made this confession it is revealed that \\"Ward\\" and Mrs Whitman were undercover police sent to find the missing diamonds and discover the truth behind the real Ward's death.

Cast *Pamela Bellwood as Ellen Cunningham *Alex Cord as Jack Kiley *Lee Wilkof as Harvey Pearlstein *Richard Basehart as Gus Dunlap Overview W.E.B. showed the inner workings of the TV industry, centering on brash female programming executive Ellen Cunningham (Pamela Bellwood) at fictional network Trans-American Broadcasting. As head of Special Events Programming, Ellen was confronted with a variety of obstacles, most notably her male colleagues, such as ruthless programming head Jack Kiley (Alex Cord), drunken has-been news chief Gus Dunlap (Richard Basehart), and ratings-obsessed research chief Harvey Pearlstein (Lee Wilkof). The initials that comprised W.E.B. were never explained on the series; presumably, it referred to the fact that \\"web\\" is a slang term for a broadcast network. (In promotional spots, the show was called simply \\"web\\", not \\"double- you ee bee\\".)NBC Fall Schedule Promo 1978 W.E.B. was originally scheduled to air on Wednesday nights at 10pm Eastern, and debuted on Wednesday, September 13, 1978. However, new NBC boss Fred Silverman's decision to scrap the proposed hour-long sitcom Coastocoast, originally announced for the Thursday 10pm slot, caused the network to move W.E.B. to Thursdays. It didn't help -- W.E.B. aired just four more episodes, the last on October 5, 1978. The show, the sixth lowest-rated network program of the entire 1978-79 season (10.1 rating, 18 share), was replaced with the police drama David Cassidy: Man Under Cover. In a case of life and art imitating each other, W.E.B. was at least partially inspired by the 1976 film Network, starring Faye Dunaway.

He is a recipient of the Medal of Valor, Israel's highest decoration, for his exploits during the 1973 Yom Kippur War. Early life Neria grew up in Israel, and spent his childhood in the city of Holon with his younger sister, Nurit, and two parents, Zipora and Jacob Neria. At the age of 18, he joined the Israeli army and subsequently participated in the 1973 Yom Kippur War and the 1982 Lebanon war. In the Yom Kippur War, his performance as a tank commander in the Sinai front (where, in several battles, his tank was hit but he kept fighting, taking command of up to 10 different tanks before being injured and evacuated), earned him the Medal of Valor, the highest decoration for combat bravery in Israel, at the age of 22. Neria's political views and body of work were deeply influenced by his war experiences. He was one of the founders of the Israeli grassroots movement \\"Peace Now,\\" which sought to facilitate reconciliation between Israel, the Palestinians, and Arab countries. Neria has published a war novel, Fire (Zmora Bitan, 1986) (Esh in Hebrew), based on his painful experiences in the Yom Kippur 1973 War, and was later involved in efforts to improve policies regarding mental health care for returning war veterans and prisoners of war with post trauma psychopathology. Education and career Neria completed his studies in philosophy (BA), political science (BA) and clinical psychology (MA) in the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and received his doctorate (PhD) in psychology from the Haifa University, Israel, in 1994.Yuval Neria at Mailman School of Public Health He was the recipient of the Alon Fellowship for Outstanding Early Career Researcher, from Israeli Council for Higher Education (CHE) and served on the faculty of Tel Aviv University from 1995 to 2001.Yuval Neria, CV at Columbia University In the autumn of 2001, after the attacks of September 11, 2001 (9/11) he moved to New York following his recruitment to Columbia University in New York City with his wife, Mariana, a clinical psychologist, and his three children. Research Neria's line of research has been focused on the emotional consequences of exposure to traumatic events. He has conducted numerous studies among Israeli veterans and prisoners of war, 9/11 bereaved, low-income primary care patients exposed to 9/11 attacks in New York City, and young adults exposed to ongoing missile and rockets attacks in southern Israel. While his main focus has been the study of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) his studies have shown that the effects of psychological trauma are not limited to PTSD, and are often resulted in other debilitating disorders, beyond PTSD, including bipolar illness, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), major depressive disorder (MDD), substance and alcohol abuse, borderline personality disorder, complicated grief, functional impairment and physical disorders. To date, his lab at Columbia and NYSPI is focused on identification of biomarkers of PTSD, which may aid in diagnosis and treatment development. Specifically, members of the lab are using multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to describe altered connectivity among hippocampus sub-regions, associations between hippocampus size and treatment outcome and a series of measurable, functional and structural changes in the brain of PTSD patients following treatment.

Biography  Trunk Funk – The Best of The Brand New Heavies was released September 13, 1999 in the UK on FFRR Records. It highlights the group's dance and pop oriented UK hits, with many appearing in remixed, edited, or radio-friendly formats. Because lead singer Siedah Garrett left the band in 1998, and previous lead N'Dea Davenport was out promoting her solo debut, UK singer Carleen Anderson fills in on vocals for this album. Three new recordings appear here, \\"Try My Love,\\" the Marvin Gaye redux \\"Saturday Nite,\\" and a cover of \\"Apparently Nothing,\\" originally done by Anderson's former band Young Disciples. This compilation was not released in the United States. Trunk Funk Classics 1991–2000 was released October 17, 2000 in the US by Delicious Vinyl Records. This collection has an entirely different track listing than the above release. Where the UK Trunk Funk release highlighted dance and pop-oriented Heavies singles, this release focuses on 70's soul influenced cuts like \\"Brother Sister,\\" the J. Dilla remix of \\"Sometimes\\" featuring rapper Q-Tip, and \\"Put the Funk Back in It.\\" The US Trunk Funk also includes two tracks from Heavy Rhyme Experience, Vol. 1, the band's collaboration with a host of hip-hop artists. Among the previously unreleased tracks are the video edit of \\"Dream Come True '92\\" and the new track \\"Finish What You Started\\" marking lead singer N'Dea Davenport's much- desired return to the band.

Franz Edmund Creffield, commonly known as Edmund Creffield and by the pseudonym Joshua (c. 1870–1906), was a German-American religious leader who founded a movement in Corvallis, Oregon that became known locally as the \\"Holy Rollers\\". The movement, mainly popular among women, was widely regarded as a cult. Creffield, who believed himself the second coming of Jesus, had a number of run-ins with the authorities and the local citizenry over the next several years, often stemming from his relations with his female followers and his increasingly erratic behavior. In 1906 he was murdered by George Mitchell, whose sister was one of Creffield's followers. After being acquitted of wrongdoing in the killing, Mitchell was himself murdered by his sister in revenge, with another follower subsequently committing suicide. The story attracted national attention and was major news for a time in the Pacific Northwest.Robert P. Sutton, Modern American Communes. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2005; p. 37. Early life Creffield came from Germany; it is unclear how he came to Oregon. He first appeared in Portland in 1903, and he quickly became involved in the Salvation Army. Later that year he was sent on mission to the town of Corvallis. Soon after, he broke with The Salvation Army and formed his own group, which he called the Bride of Christ Church. Townspeople thought it a cult and called them Holy Rollers because they rolled for hours during their services. Bride of Christ Church Edmund Creffield did not say anything outrageous when he first came to Corvallis in 1903, preaching mostly about \\"the beauty of the full Gospel.\\" Soon his followers believed he was receiving messages directly from God.\\"Holy Rollers Insane,\\" Brownsville Times (Oregon) 6 May 1904, p. 1. Creffield preached for hours on end and his followers loudly rolled on the floor pleading for God's forgiveness. When their cacophonous meetings began running into the early morning hours, Creffield was barred from holding services within city limits. During the summer he and his followers camped out on Kiger Island in the Willamette River. When the fall rains started Sarah Hurt and her three children, Maud, Frank, and Mae, some of his most ardent followers, invited him and about twenty others to move into their house just outside Corvallis. In October the group burned most of the house’s contents including furniture, utensils, heirlooms, a cat, and a dog.\\"Their Queer Acts,\\" Corvallis Times, 31 October 1903, pg. 2. Reports that a baby had been sacrificed were false. People soon began to ask if Creffield could really \\"live in the same locked house with a number of young girls, and do nothing in the world but be religious.\\" In January 1904, twenty vigilantes called the White Caps tarred and feathered Creffield, and told him to leave town and never come back. The next day Creffield and Maud Hurt were married in a room where \\"the odor of [pine] tar was noticeable.\\" In February Creffield was accused of having adulterous relations in Portland with Maud’s aunt, Donna Starr. Adultery was a criminal offense, so a warrant was put out for his arrest. A statewide manhunt went on for months. Meanwhile, many of his followers fasted and spent their days lying flat on the floor praying. Most were committed to either the Oregon State Insane Asylum or the Boys and Girls Aid Society in Portland. In July, one month after Sarah Hurt was committed, Creffield was discovered nude and starving under her house. Creffield said he was innocent, but was found guilty and served seventeen months in the Oregon State Penitentiary. When released, he claimed he was Jesus Christ risen from the dead, his resurrection being his emergence from prison. Creffield said he was responsible for the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and his followers, all of whom had been released from the asylum, believed him. \\"Creffield is Jesus Christ,\\" Cora Hartley said. \\"He condemned the city of San Francisco and brought the earthquake; he has condemned the city of Corvallis and an earthquake will destroy this place.\\" She and the others obeyed his order to evacuate to the coast. Assassination In April, Louis Hartley, a wealthy mine owner, followed his wife, Cora, and daughter, Sophie, when they went to Newport to meet up with Creffield and the others. As the group boarded a ferry, Hartley fired a revolver four times at Creffield. The gun snapped harmlessly because the centerfire cartridges were wrong for the rimfire gun.Circuit Court State of I Oregon for Benton County, Lewis Hartley (Plaintiff) vs. Cora A. Hartley (Defendant), No. 4377, Complaint, Filed 11 May 1906. Others were also gunning for Creffield, so he fled to Seattle with Maud. There, George Mitchell, Esther's brother, found him and, in front of witnesses, killed him. Multnomah County’s district attorney, John Manning, sent King County’s prosecuting attorney, Kenneth Mackintosh, a letter saying, \\"I investigated many, many charges against him [Creffield] while he was on his Holy Rolling tour in Oregon, the character of which were perfectly awful, in so far as being low, degenerate and brutal, and if permitted, I would like an opportunity to testify before the grand jury, before Mitchell is indicted … I think the taking of the law in one’s own hands, under such circumstances, to mete out summary justice is almost excusable.\\".Manning Upholds Him,\\" Morning Oregonian (Portland), 10 May 10, 1906, p. 6 Mackintosh was appalled by Manning’s suggestion. O.V. Hurt, Creffield's father-in-law, hired one of the best law firms in Seattle to defend George. Numerous witnesses testified to telling George that \\"free love\\"Editorial Comment,\\" Corvallis Gazette, 12 January 1904, p. 2. took place in 1903. They said they told George that Creffield preached that Christ would be reborn and one of the Brides’ of Christ would be the new Mary and that he needed to lay his hands upon them and purify them.\\"Creffield’s Slayer To Escape, Disciples Disband,\\" Oregon Daily Journal (Portland), 8 May 1906, p. 1. They said they told George that mothers were debauched in front of their daughters, including Sarah and her then sixteen- year-old daughter, Mae.\\"Mitchell Trial Advances Slowly,\\" Seattle Post Intelligencer, 27 June 1906, p. 1. They said they told George that finally Creffield announced that the new Mary was Esther Mitchell, the then sixteen- year-old sister of George.\\"Mrs. Creffield on Stand,\\" Seattle Star, 17 September 1906, p. 1. Many believe that much of the testimony was perjury, a tactic to avoid hearsay and put Creffield on trial. George was found not guilty by reason of insanity and released. Two days later, Esther shot and killed him using a gun Maud bought using their witness fees.\\"Mrs. Creffield Bought Gun,\\" Seattle Star, 13 July 1906, p. 7. O.V. was devastated, but still loved his daughter so he hired the same lawyers who had defended George, to defend her.\\"Hurt Will Come to Aid of His Daughter,\\" Seattle Sunday Times, 15 July 1906, p. 1. Before the case went to trial, Maud committed suicide.Crefield, Ida M. Death Certificate. King County, Washington. Volume No: 1906, Register No: 17252. 16 November 1906. Esther was found not guilty by reason of insanity and committed to Western State Hospital, an asylum in Steilacoom, Washington.\\"Esther Mitchell Goes to Asylum,\\" Seattle Post Intelligencer, February 21, 1907, p. 4.

Karl Wilhelm Göttling (Latin: Carolus Guilielmus Goettling; January 19, 1793 – January 20, 1869) was a German philologist and classical scholar. Biography He was born in Jena, the son of chemist Johann Friedrich August Göttling (1753–1820). He attended the Wilhelm-Ernst- Gymnasium in Weimar, and then, beginning in 1811, studied philology at the universities of Jena and Berlin. He volunteered in the war against France in 1814, and after the peace continued his studies at Berlin under Friedrich August Wolf, August Boeckh and Philipp Buttmann. From 1816, he taught classes at the gymnasium in Rudolstadt. In 1819 he became director of the Neuwied gymnasium, and in 1822 was appointed associate professor of philology at the University of Jena. At Jena he was also director of the philological seminary (from 1826) and university librarian, and in 1831 attained the title of full professor. He continued to reside in his home town till his death. During his academic career he participated in several study trips to Italy, Sicily, Greece, et al., and in 1852 accompanied Ludwig Preller (1809–1861) and Hermann Theodor Hettner (1821–1882) on a journey to Greece and Constantinople. He died in Jena, aged 75. Work In his early years Göttling devoted himself to German literature, and published two works on the Nibelungen: Über des Geschichtliche im Nibelungenliede (1814) and Nibelungen und Gibelinen (1817). The greater part of his life, however, was devoted to the study of classical literature, especially the elucidation of Greek authors. The contents of his Gesammelte Abhandlungen aus dem klassischen Altertum (“Collected treatises on classical antiquity,” 2 vols., 1851–1863) and Opuscula Academica (“Brief academic works,” published in 1869 after his death) sufficiently indicate the varied nature of his studies. Among his more important writings were editions of the Techne (grammatical manual) of Theodosius of Alexandria (Theodosii Alexandrini grammatica, 1822), Aristotle's Politics (1824), and Economics (1830), as well as editions of the poet Hesiod (1831; 3rd ed. by J. Flach, 1878). In the field of Greek grammar he published Allgemeine Lehre vom Akzent der griechischen Sprache (Jena 1835), enlarged from a smaller work, which was translated into English (1831) as the Elements of Greek Accentuation. His smaller works were for the most part combined in Gesammelte Abhandlungen aus dem klassischen Altertum and Opuscula Academica (1869). Mention may also be made of his Correspondence with Goethe (published 1880 by Kuno Fischer).

It is a predominantly residential area of along the named streets, also including Hyde Park's library and a few former church buildings since converted into houses. Its buildings were the core of Hyde Park in the 19th century, before later development and expansion shifted the center of Hyde Park to its current location just to the northeast. Many are in their original condition. In 1993 it was recognized as a historic district and added to the National Register of Historic Places. Geography The irregularly- shaped district boundaries are mostly lot lines and streets. It begins at the intersection of Main Street and Route 9, including all buildings fronting on Main for the two blocks west to Park Place. All the buildings on Park between Main and Albertson streets to the south are included, as well as some buildings at the west end of Albertson. This includes 36 buildings and structures in all, only six of which are not considered contributing properties to the district. Most of them are frame houses and their outbuildings built between 1840 and 1860, a time of slow transition between the Federal and Greek Revival architectural styles at the vernacular level. The most significant exception is the newest contributing property, the James Roosevelt Memorial Library at 2 Main Street, constructed of fieldstone in 1927 at the behest of Roosevelt's son Franklin, since his family made the donation that allowed for its construction. Buildings at 15 and 19 Park Place are the former Baptist Church and St. James Rectory, dating to the late 1840s. Across the street, 20 Park was likewise once a Methodist parsonage. History alt=A light brown one-story three-bay stone building with a hipped shingled roof and mature oak trees on either side. On its front door a white sign reads \\"Hyde Park Free Library\\" The area north of Poughkeepsie along the east bank of the Hudson was known as Hyde Park as early as the 1730s, but remained largely unsettled until the 1760s, when the first large estates that were initially used as summer residences were established. By the end of the century, both the present center of Hyde Park and Staatsburg had been established. Hyde Park became a town in 1821. Fifteen years later, in 1836, Main Street established itself as a short route between what was then the Albany Post Road and today's Market Street. A hundred lots were subdivided, and by 1858 maps show a thriving community with churches, houses and businesses in the area of the present historic district. Most of their owners were local businessmen and craftsmen. Later, the influence of large estate-owning families like the Roosevelts and Vanderbilts grew to the point they played a major role in the local economy, and their workers resided in the houses. This culminated in 1927 with the Roosevelt Library's construction. Most homes in the district were built in a modest Greek Revival style, three bays wide rather than the customary five, since the lots were narrow. Later on, in the late 1860s, two houses had mansard roofs added, in keeping with the Second Empire style growing in popularity at the time. In the 20th century, the rise of the estates, the growth the area experienced after Franklin Roosevelt became President and spent his vacations in the area and the rise of the automobile changed the geography of downtown Hyde Park. Main Street was still unpaved in the 1930s; at that time Roosevelt spearheaded the construction of the new post office at the crossroads of what was now Route 9 and Market, where it joined a new firehouse. The center of the town shifted to that junction, northeast of the old downtown. The buildings of what had historically been Hyde Park remained largely untouched, with a few modern additions to the neighborhood in the later decades of the century.

The building was previously the headquarters for Marine Midland Bank before the bank constructed One Marine Midland Center at 1 Seneca Tower, the tallest building in Buffalo. History The building was designed by Buffalo architects Green & Wicks and was completed by Lnquist and Illsey in April 1913 on the corner of Main and Seneca streets. The building served as the headquarters for Marine Midland Bank before moving across the street into Buffalo's tallest building, One Seneca Tower. In December 2014, the building was sold by real estate developer David L. Sweet to Paul J. Kolkmeyer, a developer and former CEO of First Niagara Bank, for $3.89 million. Kolkmeyer's firm, Amherst-based Priam Enterprises LLC, buys, manages and develops residential apartment buildings and student housing in Buffalo and the surrounding communities. In addition to purchasing the Main Seneca Building, Kolkmeyer purchased the Main Court Building at 43 Main St. (for $4.5 million), as well as the Rand Building, designed by James W. Kideney & Associates, at 14 Lafayette Square, the Roblin Building at 241 Main St., (together for $2.56 million) and The Stanton Building (also known as the Glenny Building), designed by Richard A. Waite, at 251 Main St. (for $646,569). Paul Kolkmeyer is planning to introduce several new uses to the building. According to Business First, Kolkmeyer expects to put 25 condominiums on the building's top five floors and open a banquet facility in the first floor banking hall. Additionally, he has indicated his desire to put a small boutique hotel into the third floor, and consolidate office tenants into the remaining levels. The public face of the Main Seneca Building has been Andrew J Shaevel who advised potential buyer David Nalbandyan in their attempt to purchase the building now works alongside Paul Kolkmeyer in the revitalization of the property.

Alison Mosshart told Mojo magazine about the writing process of the band: \\"Everybody just did what they wanted. I wrote most of the lyrics because that's my favorite thing, and everybody wrote different parts to the music- someone would lead with something and I'd be writing furiously, and within an hour we'd have something good enough to record or work on.

They then proceed to fire at each other, both White and Mosshart exhibit superhuman strength and show little reaction to being shot many times. As the video concludes, the two approach each other and stop at a very close range, both taking an increasing number of hits until they both run out of ammunition. They pause and White proceeds to turn and walk off into the sunset (possibly in defeat), with the sun shining through his many bullet wounds. The video was filmed in Lancaster, California.

Family and education White was born in Tetbury in Gloucestershire in 1863, the son of Frederick and Ruth White. He was educated privately in Tetbury. In 1881 he married Alice Charlesworth of Bonsall, Derbyshire. They had one son and five daughters.Who was Who, OUP 2007 White's son, also called Charles Frederick (1891–1956), inherited his father's political activism, although in the Labour rather than the Liberal interest. Career White was originally a boot and shoemaker and dealer by trade but he gave this up to go into politics full-time by becoming a registration and political agent for the Liberal Party in the West Derbyshire area. He also acted as agent for Barnet Kenyon, the Derbyshire Miners' Association candidate at Chesterfield.The Times House of Commons, 1919; Politico’s Publishing, 2004 p49Derby Daily Telegraph – Friday 6 December 1918, pg 3 PoliticsLocal politics= As well as working as a political agent for the Liberal Party, White also went into local government politics. From 1898 to at least 1903 he was a member of the Bonsall Urban District Council,Derbyshire Times and Chesterfield Herald, Saturday 17 September 1898, pg 8Derbyshire Times and Chesterfield Herald – Saturday 14 November 1903, pg 6 while by 1913 he was chairman of the Matlock Bath Urban District Council.Derby Daily Telegraph – Thursday 17 April 1913, pg 2 He was for four years an elected member of Derbyshire County Council The Times, 5 December 1923 p18 and held the position of magistrate by virtue of being Chairman of a Local Authority. =1910= White contested the West Derbyshire constituency at the general election of December 1910. The West Derbyshire seat and surrounding area had been a family heirloom of the local aristocrats the Cavendish family since the 16th century. Since the modern seat was created in 1885 it had been held solely by members of the Cavendish family.Paul Addison in Chris Cook & John Ramsden (eds.), By- elections in British Politics; UCL Press, 1997 pp143 The sitting MP in 1910 was the Earl of Kerry. He had inherited the seat at a by-election in 1908 when he was returned unopposed as a Unionist. He held the seat against Liberal opposition in January 1910 and then defeated White in December 1910 with a majority of 1,060 votes.The Times House of Commons, 1911; Politico’s Publishing, 2004 p64 =1918= Charles White In 1918 however, the world turned upside down. Despite the Earl of Kerry's receiving the Coalition coupon which surely ought to have ensured his victory in such a safe Tory seat, he lost to White by a majority of 2,160 votes. =1922–1923= At the 1922 general election, White faced a new Unionist opponent but another member of the Cavendish family, the Marquess of Hartington. In a tight contest White just managed to retain his seat, albeit by the narrow margin of 87 votes – just 0.4% of the total votes cast. White was intending to defend his seat again at the 1923 general election and he was duly nominated as a candidate but he died just before the election took place. Death White died of pneumonia on the morning of 4 December 1923, aged 60 years, having been taken ill after a meeting a few days before. His death meant that the election contest in West Derbyshire had to be postponed until 20 December 1923, all other polling having taken place on 6 December.

Camp Grant is a ghost town in Humboldt County located on the South Fork Eel River northeast of Weott and east of Dyerville. It was originally settled by Northern Sinkyone people, followed by a Union Army camp and later a logging and railroad support settlement for the construction of the Northwestern Pacific Railroad. History The area was formerly inhabited by Northern Sinkyone people whose main village, named IlhtcuntaHduñ (also Ltcuntdun) was downstream at the confluence of Bull Creek, later named Dyerville. In early 1850, half of the Josiah Gregg expedition, including Lewis K. Wood who would later found Arcata, California, passed through on local trails seeking their way back to San Francisco. The other half, including the dying Gregg, had tried to follow the coast road and failed. They left the Lost Coast along Bull Creek from about the present day location of Honeydew, California and passed this area on trails on their way to Clearlake although their exact route after leaving this area is unknown. The rush of Euro-American settlers followed immediately north on the traditional, strenuous trails over Island Mountain, now Bell Springs Road. Settlers bound for Eureka passed Camp Grant on their way north from the intersection of present-day U.S. Highway 101 and Cummings Creek, south of Leggett. This migration of Euro/Americans through an area without the resources to support the increase in population led to disease, conflict and starvation for the Sinkyone. Indian Agent Redick McKee's 1851 expedition brought a rush of homestead filings. Native groups militated against this. The resulting conflicts led to the establishment of organized vigilante committees such as the Volunteer Company of Dragoons and continued through at least the 1870s. =Bald Hills War= Camp Grant, on a line east from Cape Mendocino, on an 1866 map The Bald Hills War against the local Indians was waged during the American Civil War. Camp Grant was established on the Eel River, east of the confluence of the South Fork of the Eel with Bull Creek, in October 1863. Camp Grant was commanded by Captain John Y. Simpson with Company E, 1st Battalion of Mountaineers, California Volunteers as its garrison. Simpson and Company E were involved in several skirmishes: Skirmish at Grouse Creek May 23, 1864; a Skirmish at Matole May 26, 1864; Skirmish at Big Flat May 28, 1864; Expedition to North Fork Eel River September 1–29, 1864. During these operations they captured 166 Native Americans (referred to as \\"hostiles\\") and sent them to the Round Valley Reservation in 1864. In August 1864 the Bald Hills War ended and Company E was mustered out at Fort Humboldt on June 14, 1865. Camp Grant was abandoned shortly thereafter. =Settlement= The location remained as a settlement; a post office operated at Camp Grant from 1868 to 1895. In the 20th century, many private owners in the area sold their land to the Humboldt Redwoods State Park. The area is now considered a part of Weott.

In ideological terms, it was considered to be more conservative than the social- Catholic Popular Democratic Party, but more moderate than the main French Catholic party, the Republican Federation. During the 1920s its members had largely sat in parliament among the Republican Federation deputies, but found it to have become too right-wing, French-nationalist and centralist for their tastes.  1932 to 1936: the Republicans of the Centre group  The Republicans of the Centre (, RDC) existed during the 15th legislature (1932 to 1936). It was set up by the UPR deputy for Colmar, Joseph Rossé. It contained between six and ten deputies, and was essentially the parliamentary expression of the Christian democratic deputies from the former German provinces: the Alsatian Popular Republican Union and its Lorrain counterpart, the Lorraine Republican Union. There were also a handful of Alsatian Catholic independents who occasionally sat with the group.

The uprisings helped topple Emperor Huai of Jin in Luoyang and ended the Western Jin dynasty in northern China. Rulers from four ethnic groups, the Xiongnu, Jie, Qiang and Di, then established a series of independent kingdoms in what is now northern China. The fifth group, the Xianbei in the north, were allied to the Western Jin and later Eastern Jin against the other four barbarians until turning on the Chinese much later. A series of revolts in southern China occurred at the same time by southern Ba-Di rebels aboriginal people in Sichuan and Nanman aboriginals in Hubei resulting in the establishment of the Cheng Han state in Sichuan. This chaotic period of Chinese history, known as the Sixteen Kingdoms (五胡十六國, \\"sixteen kingdoms of the five barbarians\\"), lasted over 130 years until the Northern Wei dynasty united northern China in the 5th century. The Eastern Jin dynasty survived in southern China. Background The southward migration of nomadic tribes into the lands around the Yellow River had been ongoing since the Eastern Han dynasty for several reasons. the Han dynasty's defeated of the Xiongnu confederation in the Han–Xiongnu War by Han General Dou Xian led to the Han dynasty deporting the Southern Xiongnu along with their Chanyu into northern China. In 167 AD, Duan Jiong conducted an anti- Qiang campaign and massacred Qiang populations as well as settled them outside the frontier in northern China. The wars of the later Three Kingdoms period also encouraged this immigration, which repopulated previously devastated areas and provided military power and labour. By the end of the 4th century, the nomadic tribes had moved into the Guanzhong area, as well as the watersheds of the Wei and Xing rivers, practically surrounding the Jin capital in Luoyang. At the same time, the accession of Emperor Hui of Jin, who was possibly developmentally disabled, led to a struggle between the princes of the ruling Sima family to control him, sparking off the War of the Eight Princes. Revolts by the five barbarians took place before such as in Shanxi and Shaanxi, He San's Xiongnu revolt in 294 and Qi Wannian's Qiang and Di revolt in Yong and Qin provinces and the Beidi region (Shaanxi) He Duyuan's Qiang revolt in 296. Rise of Han Zhao The War of the Eight Princes lasted for more than a decade, severely weakening the economy and military capacity of the Western Jin. At the same time, the nomads were also being enlisted by the princes as military forces; one such force of Xianbei, under the command of Sima Yue, captured Chang'an in 306. Taking advantage of this period of weakness, the different non-Chinese peoples began to openly revolt and proclaim new regimes. The Jie chief Shi Le was sold as a slave by Western Jin officials before his uprising and owned by a Han Chinese called Shi Huan (師懽), and began his rebellion as a slave revolt against his Han Chinese masters. The Di chief Li Xiong captured Chengdu in 304, proclaiming the kingdom of Cheng Han. The most serious initial revolt, however, was Xiongnu chieftain Liu Yuan, who proclaimed the kingdom of Han Zhao in 304 as well, in the northern heartland of the Jin dynasty.Li and Zheng, pg 382 A Sogdian merchant in China wrote a letter to another Sogdian referring to the Huns (Xiongnu) who had revolted as people who had previously been \\"property\\" of the Chinese Western Jin Emperor until their uprising against him and destruction of the capital at Luoyang. The Xiongnu rebel Liu Xuan (劉宣), a relative of Xiongnu rebel chief Liu Yuan said his own Xiongnu people were treated as slaves by their Han Chinese rulers and now was the time to revolt against their Han Chinese rulers after the Jin exhausted themselves in the War of the Eight Princes, saying \\"The Jin dynasty people use us like slaves. Now they are killing each other's flesh and blood. It is God's abandonment of them and let us recover the Han\\". The Jie chief Shi Le led a revolt of slaves against the Western Jin and joined Liu Yuan and the Han Chinese rebel Wang Mi. The Chinese had humiliated Shi Le and the other barbarian slaves by forcing them to wear cangues while transporting them. Ji Sang gave Shi Le his Chinese name. Shi Le originally joined a Han Chinese rebel, Ji Sang. Jin defeat and Disaster of Yongjia The Jin dynasty was ineffective in its attempts to halt the uprising. The Jin capital, Luoyang was open to Liu Yuan's son Liu Cong (who was now commander of the rebellious forces), and he attacked Luoyang in 309 and 310 CE twice, without success. However, the Jin Chancellor Sima Yue fled Luoyang in 310CE with 40,000 troops to Xiangcheng in Henan in an attempt to flee this threat. After Sima Yue's death, the main Jin forces in Henan, led by Wang Yan, decided to proceed to Shantung to defeat Shi Le, a general of Jie ethnicity under Liu Cong, but was defeated by the rebel forces and more than 100,000 soldiers perished, including Wang Yan himself.Li and Zheng, pg 383 The defeat of Wang Yan's forces finally exhausted the military capacity of the Jin, leaving the capital open to capture. Upon entering the city, the invaders engaged in a massacre, razing the city and causing more than 30,000 deaths. This event in Chinese history was known as the Disaster of Yongjia, after the era name of Emperor Huai of Jin; the emperor himself was captured, while his crown prince and clansmen were killed. Although the main Jin regime in the North was defeated, Jin forces continued to hold three provinces in the North, namely Youzhou, Liangzhou, and Bingzhou. These provinces, however, were cut off from the remnant Jin forces now in the South and eventually overrun, reducing Jin control to the area south of the Huai River. Sixteen Kingdoms The collapse of Jin authority in the North led other leaders to declare independence. Chinese history entered the period called Sixteen Kingdoms. Historical impact The collapse of the Western Jin had long-lasting effects. In the conquered areas, various non-Han leaders quickly established a large series of kingdoms and states, most of which were short lived; this era of fragmentation and state creation lasted for more than a century, until the Northern Wei regime finally conquered and \\"unified\\" the northern regions in 439 and became the first of the Northern Dynasties. The chaos and devastation of the north also led to a mass migration of Han Chinese to the areas south of the Huai River, where conditions were relatively stable. The southward migration of the Jin nobility is referred to in Chinese as yī guān nán dù (, lit. \\"garments and headdresses moving south\\"). Many of those who fled south were of prominent families, who had the means to escape; among these prominent northern families were the Xie clan and the Wang clan, whose prominent members included Xie An and Wang Dao. Wang Dao, in particular, was instrumental in supporting Sima Rui to proclaim the Eastern Jin dynasty at Jiankang and serving as his chancellor. The Eastern Jin, dependent on established southern nobility as well as exiled northern nobility for its survival, became a relatively weak dynasty dominated by regional nobles who served as governors; nonetheless it would survive for another century as a southern regime. While the era was one of military catastrophe, it was also one of deep cultural interaction. The nomadic tribes introduced new methods of government, while also encouraging introduced faiths such as Buddhism. Meanwhile, the southward exodus of the cultured Jin elite, who then spread across the southern provinces including modern-day Fujian and Guangdong, further integrated the areas south of the Yangtze River into the Chinese cultural sphere. The \\"Eight Great Surnames\\" were eight noble families who migrated from northern China to Fujian in southern China due to the uprising of the five barbarians when the Eastern Jin was founded, the Hu, He, Qiu, Dan, Zheng, Huang, Chen and Lin surnames. Ming dynasty pirate Zheng Zhilong and his son Koxinga's ancestors in the Zheng family originated in northern China but due to the Uprising of the Five Barbarians and Disaster of Yongjia by the Five Barbarians, the Zheng family were among the northern Chinese refugees who fled to southern China and settled in Putian, Fujian. They later moved to Zhangzhou and moved on to Nan'an.福建人民出版社《闽台关系族谱资料选编》台湾《漳龙衍派鄱山氏之来龙去脉》（ 在2002年举行的纪念郑成功收复台湾340周年研讨会上 郑姓） The different waves of migration such as the fourth century and Tang dynasty northern Han Chinese migrants to the south are claimed as the origin of various Chen families in Fuzhou, Fujian. The Uprising of the Five Barbarians was one of several wars in northern China along with the An Lushan Rebellion, Huang Chao Rebellion, the wars of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms and Jin–Song Wars which caused a mass migration of Han Chinese from northern China to southern China called 衣冠南渡(yì guān nán dù).衣冠南渡．在线新华字典[引用日期2013-08-09唐宋时期的北人南迁．内蒙古教育出版社官网．2008-01-15[引用日期2013-08-09]六朝时期北人南迁及蛮族的流布．内蒙古教育出版社官网．2008-01-15[引用日期2013-08-09]东晋建康的开始—永嘉南渡．通南京网．2012-10-10[引用日期2013-08-09]从衣冠南渡到西部大开发．中国期刊网．2011-4-26 [引用日期2013-08-12]中华书局编辑部．全唐诗．北京：中华书局，1999-01-1 ：761 These mass migrations led to southern China's population growth, economic, agricultural and cultural development as it stayed peaceful unlike the north. The Western Jin set up \\"emigrant counties\\" for the northern Han Chinese refugees as stated in the saying “皆取旧壤之名，侨立郡县”. The influx of northern Han Chinese refugees was called \\"侨寄法\\" and the refugees were called “侨人”.参阅范文澜蔡美彪等《中国通史》第二编第五章第一节﹑郭沫若《中国史稿》第三册第四章第一节 Yellow registers were used to record the original southern Han Chinese population before the migration and white registers were used to record the massive influx of commoner and aristocratic northern Han Chinese migrants by the Eastern Jin dynasty government. After the establishment of the Northern Wei in northern China and a return to stability, a small reverse migration of southern defectors to northern China took place. In Luoyang a Wu quarter was set up for southerners moving north. Han Chinese male nobles and royals of the southern dynasties who fled north to defect married over half of Northern Wei Xianbei Tuoba princesses. Southern Chinese from the southern capital of Jiankang (Nanjing) were deported to the northern capital of Chang'an by the Sui dynasty after reuniting China. Han Chinese refugees from the five barbarian uprising also migrated into the Korean peninsula and into the Murong Former Yan state. Eastern Jin maintained nominal suzerainty over the Murong state until 353 as the Murong accepted titles from them. An official in the Murong state, Dong Shou defected to Goguryeo. Han Chinese refugees migrated west into Han Chinese controlled Former Liang. Yan Zhitui's aristocratic Yan family originally fled to southern China with the Eastern Jin during the uprising of the Five Barbarians in 317. Yan Zhitui was born in the Liang dynasty in 531 but upon the Chen dynasty replacing the Liang dynasty, Yan Zhitui refused to serve the new dynasty so he moved to northeastern China and defected to the Northern Qi dynasty, living through the Northern Zhou's conquest of the Northern Qi when he was brought to Chang'an in northwestern China and then serving the Sui dynasty which overthrew the Northern Zhou. The descendants of northern Han Chinese aristocrats who fled the five barbarians uprising to move south with the Eastern Jin and the local southern Han Chinese aristocrats already in southern China combined to form the Chinese Southern aristocracy in the Tang dynasty, in competition with the northeastern aristocracy and the mixed Han- Xianbei northwestern aristocracy of the former Northern Zhou who founded the Sui dynasty and Tang dynasty. The southern aristocracy only intermarried with each other and viewed themselves as preserving Han culture. Southern Chinese Daoism developed as a result of a merger of the religious beliefs of the local southern Han Chinese aristocrats and northern Han Chinese emigres fleeing the five barbarians. The Han aristocrats of both south and north were highly insular and closed against outsiders and descended from the same families who originally hailed from northern China. Ming dynasty writer and historian Zhu Guozhen (1558-1632) remarked on how the Ming dynasty managed to successfully control Mongols who surrendered to the Ming and were relocated and deported into China to serve in military matters unlike the Eastern Han dynasty and Western Jin dynasty whose unsuccessfully management of the surrendered and defeated barbarians they imported into northern China who learned to study history and this led to rebellion : Late during the Eastern Han (25-220 C.E.), surrendering barbarians were settled in the hinterlands [of China]. In time, they learned to study and grew conversant with [matters of the] past and present. As a result, during the Jin dynasty (265-419), there occurred the Revolt of the Five Barbarian [Tribes](late in the third and early in the fourth centuries C.E.).184 During our dynasty, surrendering barbarians were relocated to the hinterlands in great numbers. Because [the court] was generous in its stipends and awards, [the Mongols are content to] merely amuse themselves with archery and hunting. The brave185 among them gain recognition through [service in] the military. [They] serve as assistant regional commanders and regional vice commanders. Although they do not hold the seals of command, they may serve as senior officers. Some among those who receive investiture in the nobility of merit may occasionally hold the seals of command. However [because the court] places heavy emphasis on maintaining centralized control of the armies, [the Mongols] do not dare commit misdeeds. As a consequence, during the Tumu Incident, while there was unrest everywhere, it still did not amount to a major revolt. Additionally, [the Mongols] were relocated to Guangdong and Guangxi on military campaign. Thus, for more than 200 years, we have had peace throughout the realm. The dynastic forefathers' policies are the product of successive generations of guarding against the unexpected. [Our policies] are more thorough than those of the Han.

The story concerns the love of a poor clown for a society beauty, who finally rejects her wealthy suitors and chooses a life with the clown. Background and productions After the success of Pineapple Poll, Mackerras and Cranko sought a new collaboration, eventually deciding on adapting music by Verdi to a story by Cranko. The piece was premiered in 1954 at the New Theatre, Oxford, with its London premiere at Sadler’s Wells Theatre on 31 March 1954. The two clowns were played by Kenneth MacMillan and Johaar Mosaval, with Patricia Miller as La capricciosa. The following year the ballet was re-worked by Cranko for Covent Garden, opening on 9 June 1955, dropping one character and reassigning some dances to other characters, allowing the action to be more clearly focussed and the characters more interesting.Percival J.

A sad theme (Jérusalem) marks the entrance of two poor clowns, Moondog and Bootface who head for an empty bench in the street, where they fall asleep. On her way to the ball and beautifully dressed, La Capricciosa notices the two ragged clowns, wakes them up and asks them to dance for her (Alzira). The clowns dance a grotesque divertissement; La Capricciosa is delighted by their dance and sweeps them both along with her to the ball. =Act 1= In a splendid reception room at the palace of Signor Midas guests arrive (music from Il finto Stanislao and Giovanna d'Arco). Signor Midas greets everyone, welcomes the entrance of the dashing Capitano Adoncino (Il finto Stanislao, Aroldo, Les vêpres siciliennes) and the romantic Prince of Arroganza. The host and his guests are pursued by two debutantes looking for a rich husband, but the men eagerly await the arrival of La Capricciosa. At the height of a tarantella, a fanfare announces her arrival, and she dances a brilliant solo (I due Foscari) and introduces the two clowns, who then perform for the guests, with a scene based on a quarrel over a rose (Il finto Stanislao, Aroldo). An off-stage band summons the guests to dance, leaving the masked La Capricciosa with her three suitors (Ernani).They at first dance together (I due Foscari) then one by one the men tears a mask from her face – only to reveal another mask underneath; first Midas (Ernani, I masnadieri), then the Prince (I masnadieri, Macbeth, I due Foscari) and finally Adoncino (Macbeth, Attila), but they are rejected, and retire. Alone, La Capricciosa removes her final mask, and at that moment Moondog enters and falls instantly in love with her (Attila). The off-stage band strikes up again and all re-enter, leading to several dances for Midas (Jérusalem), the Prince (Ernani, I Lombardi alla prima crociata) the husband- hunting debutantes (Il finto Stanislao, Oberto), Adoncino, with a pas de cinq to finish (Jérusalem, Attila). La Capricciosa enters, soon followed by Moondog (Les vêpres siciliennes) who makes passionate advances to her. She eventually allows her love to overwhelm her and they dance a pas de deux (Aroldo, I masnadieri). After an ensemble in which Bootface tries to attracts the debutantes (Ernani, I Lombardi alla prima crociata, Les vêpres siciliennes), La Capricciosa enters. Despite the pleas of her three suitors, she points out Moondog, and they embrace to the horror of the guests who leave the room (Aroldo, Luisa Miller). La Capricciosa helps Moondog to his feet and they slowly go off, leaving a disconsolate Bootface; but they return and take him with them (Ernani, Aroldo). =Epilogue= In the final scene, back in the street, all three curl up to sleep on the bench (Jérusalem, Aroldo).Synopsis adapted from note by Mackerras to XLP 30006.

He was the second son of Duke Bolko II of Opole by his wife Elisabeth, daughter of Duke Bernard of Świdnica. Life After his father's death in 1356, Bolko III and his brothers Władysław Opolczyk and Henry inherited Opole as co-rulers; however, the full government was held by the oldest brother, Władysław Opolczyk. The independent rule of Bolko III began only around 1375, when he inherited Strzelce after the death of his uncle Albert without male issue. During his reign, he didn't play any political role. Bolko III spent much of his time at the courts of King Charles in Prague and King Louis I in Buda. In 1355, Bolko III, with several other Silesian Dukes, went to Italy with King Charles of Bohemia, who came to Rome for his coronation as Holy Roman Emperor; ten years later, in 1365, he made a journey from Luxembourg to Avignon, and in 1377, together with King Louis I of Hungary and Władysław Opolczyk, he made a military expedition to Bełz. Bolko III died on 21 September 1382 and was buried in the Franciscan chapel of St. Anna in Opole. Upon his death, his title passed to his four sons as co-rulers. Because his sons were minors, their guardianship was held by his uncle Władysław Opolczyk. Marriage and issue By 1355, Bolko III married a certain Anna (b. ca. 1340? – d. 8 April 1378), who may have been daughter of Duke Jan I of Oświęcim.This theory is supported by two facts. First, the introduction of the name Jan in the Opole branch. Second, one of the entries of the books of the Dominican Chapter of Oświęcim (14th century) in which two women appear as direct relatives of Duke Jan I: one of them was probably Jan I's mother Euphrosyne and the other his daughter.

Scroll, 30.3 cm x 400.4 cm. Ink on paper. Located at the Tokyo National Museum. The Eight Views of Xiaoxiang () are beautiful scenes of the Xiaoxiang region, in what is now modern Hunan Province, China, that were the subject of the poems and depicted in well-known drawings and paintings from the time of the Song Dynasty. The Eight Views of Xiaoxiang can refer either to various sets of paintings which have been done on this theme, the various verse series on the same theme, or to combinations of both. The Xiaoxiang theme should be viewed as part of a long poetic and artistic legacy. One of the earliest extant artistic depictions of the Xiaoxiang region can be found in the renowned painter Dong Yuan's masterpiece Xiao and Xiang Rivers. The original set of eight painting titles were done by painter, poet, and government official Song Di (c. 1067 – c. 1080), during the reign of Shenzong, in the Song dynasty. A complete version of Song Di's Eight Views of Xiaoxiang has not survived. The eight scenes * \\"The rain at night on the Xiaoxiang\\" (), in the south (Xiang River area) * \\"The wild geese coming home\\" (平沙落雁), in Yongzhou * \\"The evening gong at Qingliang Temple\\" (煙寺晚鐘), in Hengyang * \\"The temple in the mountain\\" (山市晴嵐), in Xiangtan * \\"The snow in the evening\\" (江天暮雪), on the Xiang River in Changsha * \\"The fishing village in the evening glow\\" (漁村夕照), in Taoyuan County * \\"The moon in autumn on Dongting Lake\\" (洞庭秋月) * \\"The sailing ship returning home\\" (遠浦歸帆), in Xiangyin, in the north (of Hunan) Symbolism Xia Gui (Song dynastic era) – Mountain Market- Clear with Rising Mist, one of the 8 scenarios. The Eight Views of Xiaoxiang is thematically part of a greater tradition. Generally, it is a theme that as artistically rendered in painting and poetry tends towards the expression of an underlying deep symbolism, such as exile and enlightenment. Furthermore, each scene generally expresses certain, sometimes subtle references. For instance Level Sand: Wild Geese Descend may refer to the historical exile of Qu Yuan in this region and to the poetry which he wrote about it. \\"Level Sand\\" may be seen as a reference to Qu Yuan because the Chinese character for level, Píng, was his given name (Yuan was a courtesy name). Furthermore, due to his having drowned himself in one of the often sandy rivers of this region to protest his unjust exile, Qu Yuan was often referred to in poetry as \\"Embracing Sand\\", for instance by Li Bo. The wild goose is one of the hallmark symbols of Classical Chinese poetry, with various connotations: the descent of the goose or geese, combined with the descent to the level sand, signifies that the geese are flying south, the season is Autumn, and the forces of Yin are on the rise (thus adding to the involved symbolism). Influence Xiao and Xiang rivers The Eight Views of Xiaoxiang inspired the people of Far East to create other Eight Views in China, Japan and Korea, as well as series of other numbers of scenes. In China various versions of The Eight Views of Xiaoxiang have been inspired by the original series, as well as inspiring other series of eight scenes. The Eight Views of Xiaoxiang became a favorite theme of Buddhist monks. Works covering the Eight Views include a set of paintings by Wang Hong (in the Princeton University Art Museum), now thought to be the earliest surviving depiction of the Eight Views,Eight Views of the Xiao and Xiang Rivers at Princeton University Art Museum a set of paintings attributed to Mu Qi (parts in the Kyoto National Museum),Returning Sails off a Distant Shore at Kyoto National Museum Website and others.

In 2015, she was listed as one of BBC's 100 Women. Controversies In October 2017, Bensouda and two members of her staff were accused by Der Spiegel of staying in touch with her predecessor, questioning the Prosecutor's own integrity when Bensouda sent confidential information to Ocampo. It was also suggested that Bensouda sought the advice of her predecessor on several occasions and perhaps allowed herself to be influenced by him, specifically in Kenya and Yazidi cases. The US State Department revoked Bensouda's visa in early April 2019. The Guardian reported that the visa withdrawal seemed to be the fulfillment of a threat from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to prevent ICC personnel from investigating whether US servicemen or US officials engaged in war crimes in Afghanistan, Poland, Romania and Lithuania. The visa revocation triggered criticism from United Nations officials. In June 2020, US President Donald Trump issued an executive order which allowed the United States to block the assets of ICC employees and prevent them from entering the country. In September 2020, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Bensouda and another senior ICC official, Phakiso Mochochoko, would be sanctioned under this order and those who \\"materially support those individuals risk exposure to sanctions as well\\".

Reclamation Police Officers were stationed only at Hoover Dam. Hoover Dam was both listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1981, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1985. (Includes informative drawing of how the dam works) and Hoover Dam has been designated as National Critical Infrastructure. The primary responsibilities of the Hoover Dam Police Officer were to protect the dam, the world's 57th-largest hydroelectric generating station, which provides about 2,080 megawatts, its associated structures, and to safeguard the lives of visitors and employees. The Hoover Dam Police were assisted by unarmed Bureau of Reclamation Security Guards who control access to reclamation facilities and deter individuals who might consider criminal activities or terrorist acts.  Closure  On October 1, 2017 the Hoover Dam Police Department was closed and the National Park Service took over law enforcement duties for the Hoover Dam. National Park Service Rangers from Lake Mead National Recreation Area now provide comprehensive federal law enforcement and emergency services for the facility and its visitors. The Bureau of Reclamation has assigned an armed Security Response Force to provide physical security for the facility. Security concerns Because of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the Hoover Dam Bypass project was expedited and traffic across the dam was restricted. \\"After Sept. 11, 2001, more than 2,000 trucks a day have been diverted away from the dam.\\" Some types of vehicles were inspected prior to crossing the dam while semi- trailer trucks, buses carrying luggage, and enclosed-box trucks over long were not allowed on the dam at all. That traffic was diverted south to a Colorado River bridge at Laughlin, Nevada. Once the bypass opened on October 19, 2010, all through traffic was rerouted on it; the roadway on the dam is now open only to employees and dam visitors. Hoover-Mead Security Zone The Hoover- Mead Security Zone encompasses around Hoover Dam and Lake Mead; before the opening of the bypass, this included of U.S. Highway 93 (US 93). Vehicles had to pass through inspection checkpoints, located on US 93 north of the dam in Nevada, and south of the dam in Arizona, before crossing. With the opening of the bypass, traffic patterns changed dramatically. Through traffic no longer goes through a checkpoint on either side of the river. On the Nevada side, the dam road now branches off US 93 before the checkpoint, which remains in operation to screen dam visitors. On the Arizona side, the road across the dam dead-ends in parking lots, no longer connecting to US 93\\\\. This made the Arizona checkpoint unnecessary. The Nevada checkpoint is manned by armed Bureau of Reclamation Security Guards plus contracted private security personnel, as was the Arizona checkpoint before its closing. Personnel at the checkpoint may inspect any vehicle at any time before it is allowed to pass through and cross the dam. Organization Headquartered in Boulder City, Nevada. Popular culture * In the 1997 film Fools Rush In, the character Isabel Fuentes Whitman (played by Salma Hayek) delivers a baby on the Hoover Dam assisted by the Hoover Dam Police. * In the 2007 film Transformers, the Hoover Dam Police were shown providing external security to Sector 7. * In the 2015 film San Andreas, the Hoover Dam is destroyed by an earthquake and the Hoover Dam police are seen escorting civilians to safety.

The URL-URD evolved to become more of an electoral coalition rather than an organized political party, an evolution all too common in France at the time. Despite the independence of its members, the URL maintained a strong base due to the support of the clergy, mayors, industrialists, and the media. Despite support for the Catholic Church and Lorrain specificity, the URL was not an autonomist party and in fact the URL fought Moselle's Catholic autonomists.

Between 1994 and 1996, Ušacka was the Executive Director of the Latvian branch of UNICEF, where she focused on children's rights issues in both a national and international context and assessed Latvia's compliance with the treaty on the Rights of the Child.\\"CICC Questionnaire to judicial candidates of the International Criminal Court \\". By June 1994, the Latvian parliament, the Saeima, had passed amendments to the law “On Judicial Power”\\"The Justices of the Constitutional Court of Latvia (Official Website of the Latvian Constitutional Court)\\". which established Latvia's first Constitutional Court. In 1996, upon the proposal of the Saeima deputies, Ušacka was elected to serve for a ten-year term as one of the first of six judges on the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Latvia. Between 1998 and 2001, Ušacka was also the director of a cooperation program between the Northwestern School of Law of Lewis & Clark College (USA) and the Faculty of Law of the University of Latvia. Together with a counterpart from Lewis & Clark, Ušacka authored the original grant proposal, which allowed the program to be funded by a three-year, $120,000 grant from the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs of the United States Information Agency.\\"Lewis & Clark School Begins Exchange \\". In 2002, Ušacka was nominated by the Republic of Latvia as a judicial candidate in elections for the newly established International Criminal Court, located in The Hague, The Netherlands.\\"Nomination of Anita Ušacka to ICC\\". Ušacka was one of eighteen judges, from a total of 43 candidates, elected in February 2003 by the Assembly of States Parties to the first bench of the ICC. She was one of seven women and the only judge elected from the Eastern Europe group. She was sworn in at the inaugural session of the court on March 11, 2003.\\"Chronology of the International Criminal Court (Official Website of the ICC) \\". After this first election of judges to the ICC, the President of the Assembly of States Parties drew lots to assign the eighteen judges to terms of three, six or nine years.\\"Articles 36 and 41 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court\\". Only the judges who received terms of three years were eligible for re-election. Ušacka, having received a three-year term, was therefore eligible for re-election, and was subsequently re-elected in 2006. Her non-renewable nine-year term expires in 2015. Upon their inauguration to the ICC in 2003, the ICC judges were assigned to judicial divisions. During her first term, Ušacka was assigned to the Trial Division. However, from 2007–2009, she was temporarily attached to Pre-Trial Chamber I, which presided over the second ever confirmation of charges hearing at the ICC in the case of the Prosecutor v. Germain Katanga and Mathieu Ngudjolo Chui. During the period of her temporary attachment to Pre-Trial Chamber I, this Chamber was also the first of the ICC to issue a warrant of arrest for a sitting head of state, in the case of the Prosecutor v. Omar Al Bashir. In March 2009, Ušacka was reassigned by the plenary of judges to the Appeals Division. From April 2011 to March 2012, she has been the Appeals Division's President. In 2015, Ušacka was awarded the distinction of Honorary Professor in Law of the Universidad San Ignacio de Layola, Peru. In that same year, in recognition of her distinguished career as an international lawyer, she was also awarded a diploma of the Inter American Academy of International and Comparative Law as an Academic and Member of Honor in Lima, Peru. Activities Ušacka has lectured and published extensively in various fields of law, including public law and administration, international and comparative law and human rights.\\"CV of Anita Ušacka (Official website of the ICC)\\".

This method of barbecuing dates back to the mid-19th century and is today regarded as a \\"mainstay of California's culinary heritage.\\" The traditional Santa Maria-style barbecue menu was copyrighted by the Santa Maria Valley Chamber of Commerce in 1978.California Farm Bureau Santa Maria-style barbecue centers around beef tri-tip, seasoned with black pepper, salt, and garlic before grilling over coals of native coast live oak, often referred to as \\"red oak\\" wood. The grill is made of iron and usually has a hand crank that lifts or lowers the grill over the coals to the desired distance from the heat. The Santa Maria Valley is often rather windy, so the style of cooking is over an oxidative fire as opposed to a reductive fire that many covered barbecues use. The traditional accompaniments are pinquito beans, fresh salsa, tossed green salad, and grilled French bread dipped in sweet melted butter.Santa Maria Visitor & Conference Bureau Some regional variations within the Central Coast include sausage (such as linguica or chorizo) or venison, grilled alongside the tri-tip or in the beans, and fresh strawberries. History Santa Maria- style barbecue originated in the mid-19th century when local ranchers would host Spanish-style feasts each spring for their vaqueros. They barbecued meat over earthen pits filled with hot coals of local coast live oak. The meal was served with pinquitos, small pink beans that are considered indigenous to the Santa Maria Valley. According to local barbecue historian R. H. Tesene, \\"The Santa Maria Barbecue grew out of this tradition and achieved its 'style' when local residents began to string cuts of beef on skewers or rods and cook the meat over the hot coals of a red oak fire.\\" In 1931, the Santa Maria Club started a \\"Stag Barbecue\\", which was held on the second Wednesday of every month, with up to 700 patrons attending each event. By the late 1950s, three local restaurants—The Far Western Tavern, Hitching Post, and Jocko's were on their way to becoming landmarks of this style of barbecue.Santa Maria Valley: A Brief History of Santa Maria Style Barbecue The Elks Lodge #1538 has huge indoor barbecue pits, and host what is called \\"Cook Your Own\\" every Friday evening. The original cut was top sirloin. Then, as today, the meat was rolled in a mixture of salt, pepper, and garlic salt before being barbecued over the red oak coals, which contribute a smoky, hearty flavor. In the 1950s, a local butcher named Bob Schutz (Santa Maria Market) perfected the tri-tip, a triangular bottom sirloin cut that quickly joined top sirloin as a staple of Santa Maria-style barbecue. President Ronald Reagan was an avid fan of Santa Maria-style barbecue. Local barbecue chef Bob Herdman and his Los Compadres Barbecue Crew staged several barbecues for President Reagan, including five feasts on the South Lawn of the White House.  Beans Santa Maria-style barbecue made with pink beans, due to unavailability of pinquito beans Pinquito beans are an essential component of the traditional Santa Maria-style barbecue menu. They are a cross between a pink bean and a small white bean, and grow well in the fertile soil and mild climate of the Santa Maria Valley. Betteravia Farms began growing pinquito beans commercially in 1972. Another specialty purveyor of pinquito beans and other Santa Maria-style barbecue foods is Susie Q's Brand.

She was instrumental in the passing of federal support for libraries. Early life and education Loleta Irene Dawson was born 14 May 1894 in Clinton, Iowa. Her father, Albert Foster Dawson, was a U.S. Representative from Iowa.Biographical Directory of the United States Congress, 1771 – Present, “Albert Foster Dawson.” Dawson’s political activity may have been an influence on Fyan’s lifelong participation in a variety of organizations, including the American Library Association, the Michigan Library Association, the League of Women Voters and the Michigan Rural-Urban Women’s Conference. Because of her father's position, she was able to meet Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft. Fyan's mother was Phoebe R. (DeGroat) Dawson, whose family came to Iowa via New York and the Erie Canal. She married Clarence E. Fyan on July 17, 1926. Fyan became a teacher after her graduation in 1915 from Wellesley College with a B.A. in botany and music. Career In 1916 she began what became her lifelong passion in Davenport, Iowa, delivering books from the main public library to nearby schools and farms for people who would not otherwise be able to access reading materials. \\"Books are dead until they meet the human mind,” Fyan believedDALB (2003), pg. 103 and so she created the first “bookmobile,” providing service in 1921 with a $10,000 budget and a Ford. For twenty years, Fyan was head of the Wayne County Library, Michigan. Under her leadership it blossomed into a staff of one hundred librarians, a fleet of cars and several library branches. This was in direct contrast to the prevailing wisdom of previous years that libraries weren't really necessary, and money spent on them was better spent elsewhere. “Don’t listen to those people who say that democracy won’t work.”, she stated in a Library Journal article. “Of course it won’t work. It’s up to us to work it”. =1951 fire= Fyan was unfortunate in having to oversee the effects of a major fire in 1951 that resulted in the loss of thousands of documents due to fire and water damage in the State Office Building in February 1951.Bartlett (2001), para 4 This event encouraged builders such as those of the Ecorse Public Library to build the library “completely fireproof.” This building was among others built with funds directly received as a result of Fyan’s work on outlining post-war projects.History of Ecorse Public Library, (cited 12 May 2009). Fyan also encountered difficulties raising funds. “There is never enough money, and painful choices must be made each year” she stated in her Report of the President to the American Library Association (ALA) in January, 1952. She was instrumental in developing library legislation titled P.A. 106 of 1937 which enabled the Michigan State Library to create the State Aid and Traveling Libraries Division. =Career achievements= *Michigan State Librarian, 1941-1961 *Davenport Free Public Library, 1916-1919 *Detroit Public Library, 1920-1921 *Wayne County Librarian, 1921-1938; 1939-1941 *Michigan Library Association President, 1934-1935 *Michigan Library Association Secretary/Treasurer, 1935-1936; 1941 *Michigan Rural Women’s Conference Chair, 1935-1941 Legacy In her will, Fyan left many legacies: the Loleta Fyan Continuing Education Scholarship Fund, the Loleta Fyan Small & Rural Library Conference, the Fyan Community Leadership Award, and the ALA Loleta D.

It was serialized in the shōjo manga magazine Hana to Yume, which is published by Hakusensha. Plot Fifteen years ago, Vivi, a demon, decided to leave the demon realm and come to the human world. One year after arriving in the human world he found an abandoned baby and on a whim decided to keep it. Since then, he has lived together with Hana... but having a fourteen-year-old girl around him wasn't that simple. Characters ; :Hana is the main heroine in the story. She was as an infant, found by Vivi during the second winter of his trip to the human world and has since then grown to the age of 14. She got her name because, according to Vivi's servants (including Toni), she has a \\"smile like a flower\\" (Hana is Japanese for flower). :Hana greatly admires Vivi and often brings him flowers, although they wilt as soon as he touches them because he is a demon. She has a fear of thunder, which causes her to have a habit of hiding under Vivi's bed. Hana is very naive, which often causes Vivi to get mad at her. It often seems like she is not listening to people, but she actually hears and answers back just in the moment they get irritated with her. :Hana wants Vivi to drink her blood but he refuses. She is jealous of Ayame because Vivi \\"accepts\\" Ayame's blood. :In chapter 29, she realizes that she's in love with Vivi. But due to Ranko (Moritz in disguise) who took her \\"heart\\", which caused her memories of what had just happened to be erased, Hana no longer remembers her feelings for Vivi. :She later remembers her feelings for him after he shows her the cherry blossoms but she doesn't remember the fact that she confessed to him. :Three years later after Vivi finished plugging up the holes in the demon world (due to Lucifer's powers weakening), she was able to enter the mansion unlike the previous years she tried. Vivi and Hana declared their love later on (despite Hana's constant rejection to his kisses due to the fact that she thinks that he will disappear upon doing so, as when they last kissed, Vivi had taken the necklace he had given her to \\"never forget him\\" ). He eventually proposes to her and she accepts. They were married in the last chapter and they had two children together, Yamabuki and Anzu, who, as a result of being half-humans, had the ability to touch flowers and not wilt them. Hana continued aging and died in her bed with Vivi holding her hand, thanking him for making her the happiest person in the world. ; :Vivi is a 200-year-old demon who came to the human world. He found Hana during his second winter in the human world. He is related to Lucifer, the king of the demon world. He cares deeply for Hana, though he does not realize that the buzzing feeling he gets, especially when Hana turns into Nigou is love. While he does not try to hide his affection for Hana, he can not admit that his feelings for her are romantic, which becomes a frequent conflict in their relationship throughout the series. :In the demon world, Vivi's rank is 'duke' (Claus explains the ranks of demons to Hana in chapter 4). He is childhood friends with Felten, Eleanor, and Klaus. After he noticed the fact that Momo has a crush on Hana, he starts a childish fight with the latter. Though he appears to be indifferent, Vivi actually cares for Hana and wishes to protect her. He is even afraid at the thought of losing her. :He hates getting up in morning. He would rather sleep until the afternoon. However, he usually gets up earlier since Hana comes to wake him up with a flower every morning. :Vivi is the only one to have a title at age 10, although he doesn't care for the achievement (so little as to getting annoyed whenever someone mentions and/or attempts to force him to return to the demon world to take the place of the current demon king, Lucifer). One day, he got bored and came to earth with Toni along with some maids. :Vivi hates and fears cats due to a childhood trauma. As a child, he would always skip classes. Therefore, one day a teacher got mad at him that she tied him up and threw him into a dark cellar with hundreds of cats. They bit him very often. Even though the wounds healed quickly, his terror of cats remained. :He leaves Hana behind and goes to the demon world, because it's an order from the demon king, promising to come back for her after 3 years although in truth he had planned to completely forget Hana so as to enable her to lead a normal life. 3 years and 3 months later, he tries to submerge himself in work so as to forget Hana, but with constant persuasion from (especially) Eleanor and Velten, plus with a new order from the new demon king, Moritz, that he must go back to Hana, Vivi finally does so. In order to make her happy, he goes back to the human world where Hana is waiting for him. After reconciling from the misunderstanding over the nature of their relationship, they confess their love to each other and he proposes to her, which she accepts. They get married after a year in the last chapter and have two children together, Yamabuki and Anzu. When Hana dies, he holds her hand and wonders if they chose the right path. However, he also says that being with her all those years had made him the happiest person in the world. ; :Velten (also called Felten) is a demon and has been friends with Vivi since they were kids. He cheers up Hana whenever Vivi gets mad at her. He has convinced Vivi that touching Hana won't kill her (in the same way that a flower wilts at a demon's touch). :He has a fiancée named Eleanor whom he refuses to marry due to fear of commitment, and a fondness for all females(also because of a fear that he would taint her). Since Felten is the reason Vivi is willing to touch Hana, Hana is willing to act as his girlfriend when he wanted to chase Eleanor away by turning her into Nigou (an older version of herself) with the use of a potion. :After Eleanor finds out the truth, she moves in with Felten, though they stay unmarried for a while. In a bonus chapter, it is revealed that they have a wedding but the wedding is not shown. Velten is a baron, being demoted from Count for flirting with daughters of the Elders. He is very cheerful and it annoys Vivi because of that. :He is the only one of the demons who has no problem with the sun. The others, especially Vivi, think it's too bright. ; :Ayame, a widow who was married to a government official, is the person who gives her blood to Vivi since she owes him. She has romantic feelings for Vivi though they are unrequited. Hana often gets jealous when she sees Vivi sucking Ayame's blood, wishing instead for him to suck hers. Chapter 27 reveals how Vivi and Ayame met. :She convinced herself that she fell in love with him because of the way he smiled at Hana. She accepts the fact that she can't compete with Hana. In the same chapter their past is revealed, Vivi told Ayame that he was through with sucking her blood. :She is always wearing a kimono. ; :Momo is the son of florists who live in town who is in the same grade as Hana. Momo first meets Hana and tricks her into buying less flowers than she actually paid for, but his conscious takes over and he tries to save her when she dives into the river, but Vivi gets to her first. :Momo gives her the flowers she paid for, and more later, and he and Hana become friends. He does not like Vivi, and finds out the secret of the latter and the others being demons later in the manga. He has a crush on Hana, the main cause of Vivi's hostility (later uncovered by Eleanor and Velten to be jealousy) towards him. He has accidentally been kissed by Hana while she was trying to hug him, but her foot slipped and she fell down. :Momo's name means peach blossom, a name he is embarrassed of since it is a girl's name, and is frequently called \\"Momo-chan\\" by his friends, mostly Hana. ; :Eleanor is Felten's fiancée and has been in love with him since they were children. She wants to marry him, but since he's a womanizer he refuses to do so. She gets angry very easily. After she discovers that Hana is not Felten's girlfriend, she came to like her. She is Klaus' twin sister. ; :Klaus is Eleanor's twin. He constantly tries to help the Elders from the demon world trick Vivi to come back to the demon world. He deeply resents Vivi because, as children, whenever he did anything special, Vivi was always a few steps ahead of him. He is a baron like Velten. ; :Rosemary is Vivi's fiancée. She wants to marry him because of his higher status, although it is hinted she might have desired his attention when they were younger. ; :Lucifer is the former king of the demon world. He loves to annoy and test Vivi all the time. He is related to Vivi but it is unknown to which status they are related. He's much older than Vivi and the others and he changes his appearance so much that he doesn't know what he looked like ages ago. It is implied throughout the series that Lucifer may have romantic feelings for Hana. :Lucifer's greeting for Vivi is usually to stab him with a sword. He has two black stars under his left eye. Vivi calls him \\"Old Geezer!\\". ; :Toni is Vivi 's butler. He takes care of almost everything around the mansion. He and his grandfather (who was also a butler) are the only butlers who ever dared to lecture Vivi. He's a very kind person and adores Hana. He and Vivi have been together since they were ten years old. He takes care of the roses in the flower garden. ;Gilbert :Gilbert is Lucifer's butler. He is typically an extremely calm person, despite often being annoyed by the demon king because he only cares about how to annoy Vivi. He wants Lucifer to fulfil his duties as the king properly. ;Ranko/Moritz :Ranko is a girl in Hana's class after she enters school in chapter 28. She is her first human female friend. She tells Hana, that she had a crush on Vivi, who had become a math teacher, but actually she just wants permission to pass the spell that Vivi cast to protect the mansion. The reason is that Ranko is actually a manly demon named Moritz, who is also a duke like Vivi and wants to be the next demon king. He tries to break Vivi's heart by casting a spell on Hana so she is mean and arrogant and in love with him instead of Vivi. At the end of the manga series, it is revealed Moritz had taken the place of Lucifer as the demon King. ;Michel :Michel is a demon, also known as the cat-user, because he studies a lot about cats and his mansion is a cat paradise. His spells are almost all about cats. He helps Klaus from time to time. Michel sent Mr. Cat to slowly take Hana's life energy, so that Vivi would go back to demon world. He has cat ears. He is the reason why Momo finds out about their true identity. ;Yamabuki and Anzu :They are the son and daughter of Hana and Vivi. Both Anzu and Yamabuki look like high-schoolers despite that Yamabuki is already 73 years old and Anzu is 70 years old in the final chapter, being half-demons. Both are very demon-like in nature but have the gift of not causing flowers to wilt when touched. Hana likely gave birth to Yamabuki a year after the wedding, which might be possible because she said that she wanted to have Vivi's children as soon as possible when they married. ;Mr. Cat :Mr. Cat is a black cat from demon world, who was sent to get Hana's life energy so she would die and cause Vivi to come back to the demon world. After they lift the spell, he is normal black cat that lives in the mansion. Vivi originally wanted to \\"get rid of\\" Mr. Cat due to his fear of cats. ;Mr. Bird :Mr. Bird is a black bird Vivi created from his shadow once, because he wanted to go to Ayame's place while Hana wanted to watch a special moon with him. He told her to wait for him, but she said she would be lonely. After that, he wanted to erase it, but Hana begged him not to do so and in the end he relented.

Development and construction was carried out by Siemens at Erlangen and Krefeld in Germany. In August 2009, it was announced that the fifth Sapsan had been delivered to Russia, of the eight that were planned. Four single-voltage (\\"EVS1\\", 3 kV DC powered, trainsets 5-8) trains entered passenger service at the end of 2009 on the Moscow – St Petersburg route, with the dual-system trains (EVS2, trainsets 1-4) entering service on the Nizhny Novgorod route on 30 July 2010.

Operations 500 meters version on a route Moscow — Saint Petersburg Since entering service in December 2009, it has been Russian Railways' only profitable passenger service, with an occupancy rate of 84.5%. According to the timetable valid from 30 October 2011, the direct train from Moscow to St Petersburg without intermediate stops needs three hours 40 minutes, the train from Moscow to Nizhniy Novgorod 3 hours 55 minutes. Introduction of Sapsan initially provoked cancelling of affordable daytime trains between Moscow and St Petersburg. Since the end of 2012, Moscow – St Petersburg daytime trains other than Sapsan were running again. There were a series of stone throwing attacks against Sapsan trains. Possible reasons including cancelling of commuter trains, disruption of local transportation in rural areas, and accidents because of poor safety for pedestrians have been suggested. New bridge crossings were built, platforms along the railway were reconstructed and additional track was completed in 2015. New Lastochka commuter trains were introduced on the Moscow – Tver and St Petersburg – Bologoye routes. Local trains in the rural areas were saved. Route Moscow – Saint Petersburg route = The first and the only (since 2015) route for Sapsan trains.

The fastest ones do not stop between Moscow and Saint Petersburg at all. Numbers of the trains which stop at intermediate stations are listed above. Such measures were implemented to increase speed. = Moscow – Nizhny Novgorod route = Former route of Sapsan trains. Since 2015, new Talgo Strizh train was introduced. All the Sapsans were directed to Moscow – St Petersburg route. Talgo trains are also high speed but more suitable for this route. = Saint Petersburg – Nizhny Novgorod route = On 1 March 2018, Russian Railways reopened the discontinued Saint Petersburg – Moscow – Nizhny Novgorod route which allows passengers to take an 8 hour 11 minute journey without a train change in Moscow. RZD Sapsan route Tickets On 1 July 2012, the Russian Railways company introduced a new tariff system for Sapsan trains which dynamically prices tickets based on two factors: * The date of sale of the ticket, * Percentage of occupied seats on the train.

Later, she married with her first cousin, Az-Zahir Ghazi, Emir of Aleppo, which marked the end of the rivalry between the two branches of the family.

After her death, Aleppo's diplomatic position was never as strong vis a vis its neighbours as it was under her rule.Humphreys, R. Stephen, Between Memory and Desire: The Middle East in a Troubled Age, University of California Press 1999, p.206 War and diplomacy The period of her regency coincided with the conflict between her brothers Al-Kamil in Egypt and Al-Ashraf in Damascus. In 1237 Al-Ashraf persuaded most of the Ayyubid rulers in Syria to join a coalition against Al- Kamil, the object of which was to confine him to Egypt and assure the continued autonomy of their Emirates. However that same year Al-Ashraf died unexpectedly and although Dayfa Khatun and several other rulers renewed it under the leadership of another brother, as-Salih Ismail, the coalition was weakened by the defection of some emirates to Al-Kamil. Al Kamil sent an army into Syria and took Damascus. He intended to embark on the pacification of all the other emirates in Syria, including Aleppo, but they were spared by his death in March 1238 (Rajab 635) shortly after he took Damascus.Humphreys, R. S., From Saladin to the Mongols, The Ayyubids of Damascus 1183-1260, SUNY Press 1977 p.230-238 After this Dayfa Khatun was careful to keep Aleppo out of the fratricidal wars which were the norm among the Ayyubids, turning down proposals for alliance from al-Jawad Yunus, the new ruler of Damascus, who wanted to revive the Anti-Egyptian coalition, and later from As-Salih Ismail, who succeeded him.Humphreys, R. S., From Saladin to the Mongols, The Ayyubids of Damascus 1183-1260, SUNY Press 1977 p.245-252 In 1240, she was able to use her neutrality in these conflicts to broker a formal declaration from the Sultan as-Salih Ayyub in Egypt, which committed the Sultan to respecting Aleppo's independence.Humphreys, R. S., From Saladin to the Mongols, The Ayyubids of Damascus 1183-1260, SUNY Press 1977 p.266 In 1240 new threat to Aleppo emerged in the shape of the Khwarezmians who had allied themselves with as-Salih Ayyub and whom he had settled to the east of Aleppo in Diyar Mudar. For reasons which are not clear, a large Khwarezmian army of around 12,000 men crossed the Euphrates and threatened Aleppo. A small Aleppan force of 1,500 cavalry led by Al-Muazzam Turanshah was defeated in November 1240 (Rabi' II) and the city lay exposed. A large force came up from Homs and deterred the Khwarezmians from attacking. They withdrew back across the Euphrates.Humphreys, R. Stephen, Between Memory and Desire: The Middle East in a Troubled Age, University of California Press 1999, pp. 269-270 In early 1241 they attacked again, but the army of al-Mansur Ibrahim of Homs once defeated them decisively, and thereafter the forces of Homs and Aleppo took control of all of as-Salih Ayyub's territories in the Jazira with the exception of Hasankeyf. As-Salih Ayyub was too preoccupied with affairs in Egypt to be able to respond.Humphreys, R.

It was first described by the Belgian-British zoologist George Albert Boulenger in 1899, based upon a holotype discovered at the Boyoma Falls, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  Description  The body of the fish is brown and mottled, with brown edges on the caudal fin lobes. It is whitish on the underside. The species is noted for its large head and eyes. As individuals age the colors tend to fade somewhat. Like other members of the genus, this fish has a humeral process, which is a bony spike that is attached to a hardened head cap on the fish and can be seen extending beyond the gill opening. The first ray of the dorsal fin and the pectoral fins have a hardened first ray which is smooth in the front and serrated on the back, a little shorter than the head. The caudal fin is deeply forked. It has short, cone- shaped teeth in the upper jaw. In the lower jaw, the teeth are s-shaped and movable. The fish has one pair of long maxillary barbels, extending far beyond the operculum, and two pairs of mandibular barbels that are often branched. The adipose fin is small, 2 to 3 times as long as deep. The anal fin is pointed. This species grows to a length of SL although specimens up to TL have been recorded in the wild. Habitat In the wild, the species inhabits tropical waters with a temperature range of , a pH of 6.0 – 7.0, and dH range of up to 10.

Following this, Jeff Jones (Circus Tents) joined the band as a guitarist. Badly needing a singer, Sortland, then working at a local movie theater, asked everyone who came in if they would like to be in a band and Rami Krayem was found. After recording the first demos, Jones left the band and Krayem took over on guitar. Reunion In 2013 and in 2016, Cigar reunited to headline a benefit show for Music 4 Cancer in Ste-Therese, Quebec, Canada. In 2014, Cigar headed back to Quebec to play Amnesia Rockfest alongside bands including Blink 182, Weezer, Alice in Chains, and more.

Description  Like all members of the genus Synodontis, S. resupinatus has a strong, bony head capsule that extends back as far as the first spine of the dorsal fin. The head contains a distinct narrow, bony, external protrusion called a humeral process. The shape and size of the humeral process helps to identify the species. In S. resupinatus, the humeral process is flat, rough, longer than it is broad, and obtusely pointed at the end. The fish has three pairs of barbels. The maxillary barbels are on located on the upper jaw, and two pairs of mandibular barbels are on the lower jaw. The maxillary barbel is straight without any branches, with a broad membrane at the base. It extends slightly longer than the head. The outer pair of mandibular barbels is about as long as the head, the inner pair is about as long. The mandibular barbels, have long, slender branches with secondary branches.

This species is in the largest genus of the family Mochokidae. This species grows to a length of TL. Distribution Synodontis schall is a species of catfish found in Africa. It is found mainly in Lake Nubia and is one of the only Synodontis species that have thrived in this lake and have adapted to new conditions, unlike the other species. Synodontis schall is able to adapt to many different kinds of food and habitats, increasing the chances of survival. Appearance and anatomy Synodontis schall has a shield on its body and has strong bony spines on the pectoral and dorsal fins. Some areas of new evolutionary forces have allowed for the Synodontis schall to have different phenotypes. Recent studies have found evidence for an increase number of teeth and gill rakers which could possibly point to a change from them being herbivores to carnivores. The swim bladder of Synodontis schall is whitish in appearance. Its walls are very thick and elastic, with the posterior section being thicker than the front one. The roof of the front section of the swim bladder is directly attached to the backbone and the muscles which are connected to it are able to compress and contract the swim bladder. The grunting sounds created by the swim bladder are most likely made by the vibration of its walls. The sound is a deep grunting sound that can be heard for up to five meters away. The sound starts off sharply and then fades out within one fifth of a second. The fish will produce sounds when it is scared, in pain, when it has aggressive behavior and attacks other fish, and when it's spawning. Diet The diet of Synodontis schall is one of macrophytes and algae, which are the two main types of food for them, fish and egg scales, insect larvae, and molluscs. This suggests that they are omnivores. Reproduction Not much is known about the reproduction of Synodontis schall. Physical and biological factors can affect the fish as it matures. July to October is the time for spawning for them and an increase in spawning activity occurs when there is a lot of rain. Relationship to humans Synodontis schall are very important to Benin, a country in Africa. Fishermen in Africa catch these fish in their nets and so they must break the spines of the fish to get them out of their nets. Synodontis schall can be caught for food or even traded since they are prized fish.

The color patterns on the fish tend to become more pronounced in older individuals. Like other members of the genus, this fish has a humeral process, which is a bony spike that is attached to a hardened head cap on the fish and can be seen extending beyond the gill opening. The first ray of the dorsal fin and the pectoral fins have a hardened first ray which is serrated. The caudal fin is forked. It has short, cone-shaped teeth in the upper jaw. In the lower jaw, the teeth are s-shaped and movable. The fish has one pair of long, dark- colored maxillary barbels, that reach as far as the base of the ventral fins, and two pairs of mandibular barbels that are often branched. The pectoral fin spine is finely serrated on the outer edge, and heavily serrated on the inner edge. This species grows to a standard length of although specimens up to total length have been recorded in the wild. Habitat In the wild, the species inhabits tropical waters with a temperature range of , a pH of 6.0 – 7.5, and dH range of 4-15. It has been found in the central Congo River basin and in Pool Malebo. It is harvested for human consumption.

It was first described by German naturalist and explorer Eduard Rüppell in 1829, from specimens obtained near Cairo, Egypt. The species name serratus comes from the Latin word serra, meaning \\"saw\\", which refers to the serrated pectoral spines of the species.  Description  Like all members of the genus Synodontis, S. serratus has a strong, bony head capsule that extends back as far as the first spine of the dorsal fin. The head contains a distinct narrow, bony, external protrusion called a humeral process. The shape and size of the humeral process helps to identify the species. In S. serratus, the humeral process is rough, much longer than it is broad, and pointed at the end. The fish has three pairs of barbels. The maxillary barbels are on located on the upper jaw, and two pairs of mandibular barbels are on the lower jaw. The maxillary barbel is straight without any branches, with a broad membrane at the base. It extends about to times the length of the head. The outer pair of mandibular barbels is about twice as long as the inner pair, have long, slender branches with secondary branches. The front edges of the dorsal fins and the pectoral fins of Syntontis species are hardened into stiff spines. In S. serratus, the spine is as long or a little shorter than the head, curved, smooth in the front and serrated on the back. The remaining portion of the dorsal fin is made up of seven branching rays. The spine of the pectoral fin is as long or slightly longer than the dorsal spine, and serrated on both sides. The adipose fin is 3 to 4 times as long as it is deep. The anal fin contains five unbranched and seven to eight branched rays, and is obtusely pointed in the front. The tail, or caudal fin, is deeply notched, with the upper lobe longer and sometimes ending in a filament. All members of Syndontis have a structure called a premaxillary toothpad, which is located on the very front of the upper jaw of the mouth. This structure contains several rows of short, chisel-shaped teeth. In S. serratus, the toothpad forms a short, broad band. On the lower jaw, or mandible, the teeth of Syndontis are attached to flexible, stalk-like structures and described as \\"s-shaped\\" or \\"hooked\\". The number of teeth on the mandible is used to differentiate between species; in S. serratus, there are about 30 to 45 teeth on the mandible. The color of the fish is a uniform grey or brownish on the back, white on the underside. Juveniles may have small dark specs on the back and adipose fin. The maximum total length of the species is . Generally, females in the genus Synodontis tend to be slightly larger than males of the same age. Habitat and behavior In the wild, the species is known only from the Nile River basin. The species is harvested for human consumption. In its natural environment, it prefers deep water and rocky habitats. The reproductive habits of most of the species of Synodontis are not known, beyond some instances of obtaining egg counts from gravid females. Spawning likely occurs during the flooding season between July and October, and pairs swim in unison during spawning. The growth rate is rapid in the first year, then slows down as the fish age.

It was first described by Russian-American ichthyologist Nikolai Andreyevich Borodin in 1936, from specimens collected at Kasaga, in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The species name tanganyicae comes from the habitat of the species, Lake Tanganyika.  Description  Like all members of the genus Synodontis, S. tanganyicae has a strong, bony head capsule that extends back as far as the first spine of the dorsal fin. The head contains a distinct narrow, bony, external protrusion called a humeral process. The shape and size of the humeral process helps to identify the species. In S. tanganyicae, the humeral process is wide, triangular, and rough in appearance; the bottom edge does not contain a ridge. The top edge is concave and ends in a blunt point. The fish has three pairs of barbels. The maxillary barbels are on located on the upper jaw, and two pairs of mandibular barbels are on the lower jaw. The maxillary barbel has a well-developed membrane attached near the base and is straight without any branches. It extends at least as far as the base of the pectoral fin. The outer pair of mandibular barbels extends just short of the pectoral girdle, and contains four to seven branches without secondary branches. The inner pair of mandibular barbels is about as long as the outer pair, with four to six branches, with secondary branches present. The skin of S. tanganyicae has a large number of tiny vertical skin folds. The exact purpose of the skin folds is not known, but is a characteristic of the species of Syndontis that are endemic to Lake Tanganyika. External papilla are present but do not extend onto the fins. The front edges of the dorsal fins and the pectoral fins of Syntontis species are hardened into stiff spines. In S. tanganyicae, the spine of the dorsal fin is long, nearly straight, and ends with short, dark filament. The remaining portion of the dorsal fin is made up of seven to eight branching rays. The spine of the pectoral fin is slightly curved, about as long as the dorsal fin spine, and ends in short, dark filament. The rest of the pectoral fins are made up of eight to nine branching rays. The adipose fin does not contain any rays, is long and well developed, and has a convex shape. The pelvic fin contains one unbranched and six branched rays. The anal fin contains three to five unbranched and seven to nine branched rays. The tail, or caudal fin, is forked, with slightly rounded lobes. The mouth of the fish faces downward and has wide lips that contain papilla. All members of Syndontis have a structure called a premaxillary toothpad, which is located on the very front of the upper jaw of the mouth. This structure contains several rows of short, chisel-shaped teeth. In some species, this toothpad is made up of a large patch with several rows in a large cluster. In other species of Syndontis, this toothpad is clearly divided into two separate groups, separated by a thin band of skin that divides the toothpad. This character is used as a method of differentiating between two different but similar species of Syndontis. In S. tanganyicae, the toothpad is interrupted, with a distinct gap between groups of teeth. On the lower jaw, or mandible, the teeth of Syndontis are attached to flexible, stalk-like structures and described as \\"s-shaped\\" or \\"hooked\\". The number of teeth on the mandible is used to differentiate between species; in S. tanganyicae, there are 33 to 49 teeth on the mandible, arranged in a single row. Some of the species of Synodontis have an opening or series of openings called the axillary pore. It is located on the sides of the body below the humeral process and before the pectoral fin spine. The exact function of the port is not known to scientists, although its presence has been observed in seven other catfish genera. Fish in the genus Acrochordonichthys are known to secrete a mucus with toxic properties from their axillary pore, but there is no scientific consensus as to the exact purpose of the secretion or the pore. S. tanganyicae does not have an axillary pore. The body color is gray to reddish brown on the back, covered with large, scattered, small black spots. The underside is lighter, with smaller spots. Most of the species of Synodontis of Lake Tanganyika have a recognizable pattern consisting of dark triangles at the bases of all of the rayed fins, present in S. tanganyicae, and the back edges of the fins are whiter. The barbels are white. The maximum standard length of known specimens is with a total length of . Generally, females in the genus Synodontis tend to be slightly larger than males of the same age. Habitat and behavior In the wild, the species is endemic to Lake Tanganyika, which has an observed temperature range of , an approximate pH of 8.5 – 9, and dH range of 4-15. The fish inhabits littoral to benthic zones over shell, sand, and mud bottoms, and has been found at depths of up to . The reproductive habits of most of the species of Synodontis are not known, beyond some instances of obtaining egg counts from gravid females. Spawning likely occurs during the flooding season between July and October, and pairs swim in unison during spawning. The diet consists of gastropods, lamellibranchs, insect larvae, ostracods, and shrimp. The growth rate is rapid in the first year, then slows down as the fish age.

Domingo, Cainta, Rizal, Philippines. Founded in 1973 and is recognized as the \\"Division Leader School\\" in Rizal History The Cainta Municipal Government passed a resolution that aimed to open a public secondary school that would serve the people of Cainta. In 1973 the Cainta Municipal High School was established under Francisco P. Felix, the municipal mayor at that time. It had only have five teachers from Rizal High School in Pasig who were housed in a twelve-room building in Parola, Brgy. San Andres. One of them was Principal IV, Juana M. Garrovillas. At first, classes were held in the morning and afternoon but later classes were opened in the evening for working students with a P 5.00 tuition fee. The first principal was Generosa Masikip. During her administration, the first steel flag pole was constructed. The first issue of the school paper, The Sepoys and Ang Maglalatik was published in 1978 under the guidance of Juana Garrovillas and Marita Uy as the first advisers. In 1980, the school was renamed in honor of the late Mayor Felix who was responsible for establishing this leader school. Felixians joined different inter-school contests not only in the province but also at national level. When Genesius Fulgueras became principal, the school expanded tremendously. In 1987. it was designated a national high school under President Corazon Aquino, who declared free secondary education. Several annexes have been built to accommodate the increasing population. The current annexes are Rosepack Main, JICA Annex, Karangalan Annex and LTO Annex. Defunct annexes are Manggahan Annex (now known as San Juan National High School of Cainta) and Parola Annex (now a tricycle terminal). It remained headless for one year until the appointment of its former teacher, Juana M. Garrovillas as principal. There are 34 sections in fourth year, 34 sections in third year, 32 sections in second year and 36 sections in first year, making it the fastest growing school in the province outnumbering Rizal National Science High School in terms of student population. Last January 2014, Ms. Juana M. Garrovillas, Principal IV, was replaced by Dr. Vidal Mendoza Ph.D., Principal IV of San Mateo National High School.

He grew up in South Euclid before moving to Beachwood when he was in seventh grade. He was elected president of the Beachwood High School senior class of 1971, but moved to Bethesda, Maryland halfway through the school year after his father got a new job.https://www.cleveland.com/cuyahoga- county/2014/05/armond_budish_is_running_under_the_radar_despite_frontrunner_status.html Career Budish received his Bachelor's Degree (cum laude) in 1974 from Swarthmore College in Swarthmore, Pennsylvania where he was a political science major. He then went on to complete a Juris Doctor degree from New York University School of Law.Swarthmore College Alumni Bulletin (November 1996) In 1993, he founded the law firm Budish, Solomon, Steiner, & Peck, of which he continues to be a partner. During that time Budish became nationally recognized for his work in the field of consumer law, estate planning, and elder law.Naymik (4 June 2009) He was elected to Cuyahoga County Executive for the first time in November 2014, and was reelected to the post in 2018.http://www.cleveland.com/opinion/index.ssf/2014/09/jack_schron_for_cuyahoga_count.html Ohio House of Representatives In 2006, after both of his sons left for college, he made the decision to run for public office, and was elected to the Ohio House of Representatives from the 8th District, which includes parts of Cleveland, Ohio, and some of the city's eastern neighbors. He was re-elected in 2008 and was chosen Speaker of the House by his peers in January 2009, becoming the first Jewish Speaker of the Ohio House of Representatives. His main focus in the 128th General Assembly was job creation in the difficult economic conditions of 2009. To that end, he created several new committees, including Economic Development and Housing & Urban Revitalization. Budish faced mounting criticism from opponents in February 2010 for not allowing the National Right to Life Oratory Contest winner to receive an honorary resolution on the House floor. However, he soon reversed his decision and allowed for the award to be given.Ohio House Speaker Armond Budish blocks presentation to 'Right to Life' teen He also was criticized for colluding with progressive political action committees in the 2010 election cycle. Charges on the matter were later dropped. With the Republicans regaining control of the State House in 2010, Armond Budish lost a second term as House Speaker, and was replaced by William G. Batchelder. He was chosen to remain as Minority Leader with the approval of his colleagues. On January 3, 2011 Budish was sworn in as minority leader, and pledged cooperation with Republicans. He stated he would be available \\"to help you and to help your colleagues forge the essential, equitable, bipartisan solutions to the economic and social problems Ohio faces.\\" However, Budish has also acknowledged that he believes that the Republican Party is motivated to annihilate the Democratic voting base, and is out to make Ohio a one party state. Along with his duties as leader, Budish also serves the ranking member of the Rules and Reference Committee. Budish is also a member of the Ohio Arts Council; a member of the Joint Legislative Ethics Committee; the Ohio Legislative Service Commission; the Program Committee of Ohio Government Telecommunications; and the Legislative Task Force on Redistricting, Reapportionment, and Demographic Research. Budish won a final term in 2012, defeating Republican Tony Hocevar with 83% of the vote. Policies, positions and initiatives ;Fiscal issues He has called the 2012–2013 Kasich budget proposal \\"horrific\\" and said they will have a \\"terrible\\" impact on all Ohioans. He has said a proposed $1 billion cut in local government funds will mean local officials will have to slash their budgets and cut police and firefighters. He called a proposed $3 billion reduction in basic funding for schools \\"horrific\\" and predicted it would force districts to cut teacher salaries and positions and increase the size of some classes to 50 students or more. He also pointed to developments in Florida, where newly elected Gov. Rick Scott fired the president of a similar public-private entity and has proposed to consolidate economic development operations into a reinstated Department of Commerce. Budish has also remained vocal on an initiative to move a Cuyahoga County mental health facility to Northfield, Ohio. \\"I think it's a disservice to the families to build it anywhere else -- 90 percent of the families are Cleveland families,\\" he said. \\"You can't just go back and forth on a whim.\\" ;Collective bargaining A leader in the fight against a bill that eliminated portions of collective bargaining for public employees, Budish had promised to \\"fight like hell\\" against the passage of the measure. He also has come out against a measure to limit or eliminate overtime pay for any employee of a private company in Ohio. Budish, along with fellow Democrats delivered over 65,000 signed signatures against the bill to the committee that was hearing the legislation. The bill went on to pass the House, and was concurred upon in the Senate. Budish stated it was an attack on something that helped to raise up the working poor over a period of thirty years. In August 2011, Kasich and Republican leaders, fearing that the repeal effort could potential overturn the bill, sought to bring organized labor leaders together. However, those against the measures opted to not meet with the Governor unless the entire legislation was repealed. As a result, Budish drafted legislation that would effectively overturn Senate Bill 5. He has urged on a vote from Speaker of the House William G. Batchelder to repeal the bill. ;Social issues Demonstrating outrage over a measure that looks to require a photo ID to vote, Budish has called it a modern-day poll tax that will unfairly harm impoverished, minority and handicapped voters at the polls. He has called the bill \\"partisan attack on the right to vote.\\" In 2019, Budish proposed a plan that would reduce the Cuyahoga County jail's population and the dedication of more resources for the increasing number of children in county custody. title = Bail reform initiatives, more money for foster kids among Cuyahoga County executive’s priorities in 2020-2021 budget  accessdate = 11-1-19 The budget includes $1 million for bail reform initiatives and money for additional corrections officers. ;Education Budish has also opposed an initiative to allow for the return of five calamity days to schools, mostly due to an unfunded mandate that requires public schools to provide transportation to non-public schools on said days.

It was first described by George Albert Boulenger in 1915. The original specimens were obtained in Kasenga, on the Luapula River in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The species name unicolor means \\"one color\\", referring to the uniform dark-brown coloration on the body and fins.  Description  Like all members of the genus Synodontis, S. unicolor has a strong, bony head capsule that extends back as far as the first spine of the dorsal fin. The head contains a distinct narrow, bony, external protrusion called a humeral process. The fish has three pairs of barbels. The maxillary barbels are on located on the upper jaw, and two pairs of mandibular barbels are on the lower jaw. The adipose fin is large and the tail, or caudal fin, is forked. The front edges of the dorsal fins and the pectoral fins are hardened into stiff spines. These spines can be raised into position at right angles to the body and locked into position for defensive purposes. The ability to lock the spines into place comes from several small bones attached to the spine, and once raised, the spines cannot be folded down by exerting pressure on the tip. The fish has a structure called a premaxillary toothpad, which is located on the very front of the upper jaw of the mouth. This structure contains several rows of short, chisel-shaped teeth. On the lower jaw, or mandible, the teeth are attached to flexible, stalk-like structures and described as \\"s-shaped\\" or \\"hooked\\". The maximum total length of the species is . Generally, females in the genus Synodontis tend to be slightly larger than males of the same age. Habitat and behavior In the wild, the species occurs in the Luapula-Mweru system of the upper Congo River basin. The species faces threats from overfishing, although the species has a broad distribution. As a whole, species of Synodontis are omnivores, consuming insect larvae, algae, gastropods, bivalves, sponges, crustaceans, and the eggs of other fishes. The reproductive habits of most of the species of Synodontis are not known, beyond some instances of obtaining egg counts from gravid females. Spawning likely occurs during the flooding season between July and October, and pairs swim in unison during spawning. The growth rate is rapid in the first year, then slows down as the fish age.

The poem deals with the idea of Thomas Chatterton, a poet who committed suicide, as representing the poetic struggle. Background The 1790 version was part of Coleridge's collecting his juvenilia in 1793. It was first printed in 1794 as a preface to Chatterton's Poems supposed to have been written at Bristol, by Thomas Rowley and Others, in the Fifteenth Century.Gordon 1942 p. 55 The 1794 version was slightly altered, had 36 lines added to it, and was included in Coleridge's Poems on Various Subjects (1796). These changes reflect Coleridge's involvement over the summer of 1794 with Southey, his experience with his later wife Sara Fricker, and pursuing a democratic ideal society dubbed Pantisocracy. After his marriage with Fricker, his involvement with William Wordsworth and his sister, and his progressing further into a Romantic mindset, Coleridge altered the poem again for the 1797 second edition of Poems on Various Subjects.Gordon 1942 pp. 58–61 With Wordsworth as his close poetic companion, Coleridge began to look down on the \\"Monody\\" as an inferior poem. When Southey wished to print a revised version of the poem for a work on Chatterton, Coleridge wrote:Gordon 1942 p. 62 > on a life and death so full of heart-going realities as poor Chatterton's, > to find such shadowy nobodies as cherub-winged Death, Trees of Hope, bare- > bosomed Affection and simpering Peace, makes one's blood circulate like > ipecacuanha. But it is so. A young man with strong feelings is impelled to > write on a particular subject, and this is all his feelings do for him. They > set him upon the business and then they leave him. he has such a high idea > of what poetry ought to be, that he cannot conceive that such things as > natural emotions may be allowed to find a place in it; his learning, > therefore, his fancy, or rather conceit, and all his powers of buckram are > put on the stretch.Gordon 1942 qtd. p. 62 The \\"Monody\\" wasn't printed again until 1803 for the third edition of Poems on Various Subjects. When Coleridge collected his works in the 1817 Sibylline Leaves, he did not include \\"Monody\\". It was not until the 1828 edition of the work that \\"Monody\\" was added to the \\"Juvenile Poems\\" section, but it was the 1796 version although Coleridge did alter the work between 1803 and 1828. However, the 1829 edition of Sibylline Leaves did contain a revised version of \\"Monody\\". The final version of the poem appears in Coleridge's last collection of poems, which was printed in 1834 and edited by Coleridge's nephew.Gordon 1942 pp. 62–66 Poem The poem was rewritten from 1790 until 1834 and had six versions, with the 1834 version being the edition that is commonly provided for the poem. These were not corrections to the original poem, but instead a development of the themes and ideas along with changes in style, genre, and structure. These changes parallel Coleridge's own changing view of Chatterton. The original version, from 1790, was an imitation of 18th-century poetry written for school and follows the Pindaric ode form that ignores many of the structures of the Pindaric ode. The versions in-between shift to a more Romantic structure and then finally become Augustan in the final version.Gordon 1942 pp. 49–51 As a whole, the poems can be broken into three sets: the 1790 Pindaric ode, the Romantic odes from 1794 until 1829, and the elegy from 1829 until the final publication in 1834.May 2001 p. 166 =1790 version= The 1790 \\"Monody\\" is a loose Pindaric ode contain 8 stanzas with a semi-regular iambic meter. It begins with the Muse prompting the narrator to sing of Chatterton, and narrator poet responds by describing Chatterton's death:Gordon 1942 pp. 50–51 After describing Chatterton's fate and lamenting over his fate, the narrator begins to identify himself with Chatterton. Soon after, the poem returns to Chatterton's death, and the narrator implores Chatterton to help him attain a divine status:Gordon 1942 pp. 51–52 Of the final two lines Coleridge said, in a note to the 1823 copy of the first version, that they contain \\"a sentiment which in his cooler moments he would have abhor'd the thought of\\".Gordon 1942 qtd p. 52 =1794 version= Coleridge removed the Pindaric ode and replaced it with a Romantic elegy structured by heroic couplets. Only 17 lines carry over into the new version. The poem begins not with the muse but with Death, but little of the overall structure changes until the end's discussion of Chatterton wandering and inspiration:Gordon 1942 pp. 55–57 =1796 versions= The 1796 version of \\"Monody\\" is similar to the 1794 and reproduces most of the content with the addition of 36 lines appended to the end of the poem. The lines deal with Coleridge's involvement in 1794 with Southey and their idea for a Pantisocracy. As such, there is a stronger connection between Coleridge's life and Chatterton's. After saying goodbye the Chatterton, he states that he must shift the theme to avoid thoughts of suicide:Gordon 1942 pp. 58–59 There is also an introduction of Chatterton joining Coleridge, Southey, and the Pantisocratic government to live happily together:Gordon 1942 p. 59 In the final lines, Chatterton is no longer Chatterton but Coleridge's own Romantic identity:Gordon 1942 p. 60 =1797 and 1803 versions= Coleridge began his 1797 edition of poems with a preface that made clear what kind of alterations would be made to all of his poems, including \\"Monody\\": > I return my acknowledgements to the different Reviewers for their > assistance, which they have afforded me, in detecting my poetic > deficiencies. I have endeavoured to avail myself of their remarks... My > poems have been rightly charged with a profusion of double-epithets, and a > general turgidness. I have pruned the double-epithets with no sparing hand; > and used my best efforts to tame the swell and glitter both of thought and > diction.Gordon 1942 qtd. p. 61 However, the 1796 and 1797 are similar except for a few removed double- epithets and some other minor changes. Likewise, the 1797 version and the 1803 version are similar except that Coleridge removed a 16 line passage and 3 other lines.Gordon 1942 pp. 61–63 =1829 and 1834 versions= The 1829 version opened with 15 new lines which rely on Chatterton as an image of Coleridge's own response to his inevitable death:Gordon 1942 p. 64 Some other stanzas are added and recast to emphasise a connection between Coleridge and Chatterton. This blending of identities continues when the poem describes Chatterton in heaven and then the experience of a harsh reality:Gordon 1942 p. 65 The only other alteration in the poem is a readdition of four lines discussing \\"the fair promise of my spring\\", the return to the elegy format with an emphasis on rhyming couplets similar to those of Alexander Pope and Samuel Johnson, and the re-addition of double-epithets into the poem. The 1834 version, the final version of \\"Monody\\", is similar to the 1829 version of the poem with the addition of 11 lines. These 11 lines were the final 11 lines of the 1790 version:Gordon 1942 pp. 65–66 This addition was probably not done by Coleridge and does not match the rhythm of the rest of the poem. Instead, it is possible that Coleridge's nephew took lines from the original poem and added it to the 1829 edition when editing the 1834 collection of poems.Gordon 1942 p. 66 Themes The original version contains hints of Romantic themes when it mourns the death of Chatterton. Coleridge was influenced by John Milton's Lycidas, Gray's Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard, and the poetry of both William Bowles and Thomas Warton. Gray's particular influence was in word choice and Coleridge's incorporating the image of Chatterton as a young poet. Warton's The Suicide provides a connection to Chatterton by describing a poor poet killing himself. Although Warton made it clear that he was not thinking of Chatterton when composing the poem, Coleridge believed that there was a connection, and he believed that Warton's depiction was too unfavourable towards Chatterton. Coleridge was personally affected by the idea of Chatterton's death and how the poet was ruined by debt. Of the later point, Coleridge knew of poverty affecting many poets that he admired along with having a lot of experience with his own debt and poverty.Gordon 1942 p. 51 The second edition shows a stronger influence of Gray and the elegy form. Gray's The Bard influences the poem's discussion of Chatterton as a poet, the Elegy influences the poem's discussion of Chatterton's solitude, and The Progress of Poesy influences the discussion of Chatterton's youth. Like Gray's poetry, the poem relies heavily upon personification and Coleridge borrows phrases from Gray. Even Coleridge's Chatterton and Gray's Bard share a similar character that is only separated by the actual biographical events of Chatterton's life and death. However, the 1767 revision begins to drop Gray as an influence and substitutes Wordsworth in his place. Wordsworth's influence did not directly affect the poem, but instead caused Coleridge to think of the poem as part of his childhood poems and not part of his mature work. Although he did revise the work again for the 1803 edition, his estimation of the poem did not improve. It was not until 1829 that Coleridge began to identify himself with Chatterton again.Gordon 1942 pp. 55–65 Within the final version of the poem, Coleridge transitions abruptly from a discussing a painful theme, a technique that is common to the ode. Later, he develops this transition further in his poem \\"Dejection\\". The ode form allowed Coleridge to create stand alone stanzas that create contrasts with other stanzas, and the reliance on a speaker within the poem provides a psychological dimension to these changes.Fairbanks 1975 pp. 878–880 Critical reception Charles Lamb did not like the changes incorporated in the 1796 edition of \\"Monody\\" and told Coleridge \\"I rather wish you had left the monody on Chatterton concluding as it did abruptly. It had more of unity\\" and, later, \\"I am not quite satisfied with the Chatterton, and with your leave shall try my hand at it again. A master joiner, you know, may leave a cabinet to be finished, when his own hands are full\\" but Coleridge refused any of his suggestions.Gordon 1942 qtd. p. 60 During the late 19th century, J. D. Campbell points out that \\"'Monody' was one of the first poems (if not the first) of any importance composed by Coleridge, and, down to the end of his life, he never missed an opportunity of tinkering it\\".Campbell 1893 p. 562 In 1942, I. A. Gordon declared that \\"Coleridge's Monody on the Death of Chatterton can never be regarded as one of his greatest poems, but it can lay a fair claim to be considered one of his most interesting; and in one respect at least it is unique. The Monody took him no less than forty-four years to beat into its final form, and if we can credit his statement that some lines of it were written 'in his thirteenth year as a school exercise' the forty- four years are stretched to almost fifty.\\"Gordon 1942 p. 49 By 1975, Samuel Chew and Richard Altick declared: \\"[Coleridge's] addiction to 'turgid ode and tumid stanza,' clogged with pompous rhetoric and frigid personification, is evident in the Destruction of the Bastille (1789) [...] and in the Monody on the Death of Chatterton which was later (1794) completely rewritten.\\".Chew and Altick 1975 p. 5 NotesReferences * Campbell, J.

During the first half of the twentieth century, the refrigerated ships, such as and , engaged in the Central America to United States trade also operated as luxurious passenger vessels. Surplus naval vessels were converted in some cases in the search for speed with Standard Fruit converting four U.S. Navy destroyer hulls, without machinery, to the banana carriers Masaya, Matagalpa, Tabasco and Teapa in 1932. Transfers to naval service served as transports and particularly chilled stores ships such as , the United Fruit passenger and banana carrier Quirigua, and the lead ship of a group that were known as the Mizar class of stores ships. Modern banana boats tend to be reefer ships or other refrigerated ships that carry cooled bananas on one leg of a voyage, then general cargo on the return leg. The large fruit companies such as Standard Fruit Company, United Fruit Company in the United States and Elders & Fyffes Shipping, which itself came under control of the United Fruit Company in 1910, in the banana trade acquired or built ships for the purpose, some strictly banana carriers and others with passenger accommodations. 1916 advertisement for the United Fruit Company Steamship Service United Fruit operated a large fleet, advertised as The Great White Fleet, for over a century until its successor Chiquita Brands International sold the last ships in a sale with leaseback in 2007 of eight refrigerated and four container ships that transported approximately 70% of the company's bananas to North America and Europe. At one time the fleet consisted of 100 refrigerated ships and was the world's largest private fleet with some being lent to the Central Intelligence Agency to support the attempted overthrow of the Castro regime in the Bay of Pigs landing. In modern usage the term has been associated with a derogatory term for immigrants. As the main produce of the West Indies was bananas they were also used as a form of cheap transportation and the English cricket team that toured the West Indies in 1959–1960 used banana boats to travel across the Atlantic and between the islands. They were better known for bringing West Indian immigrants to Great Britain, and to say that someone 'came off a banana boat' was a derogatory phrase used by those who objected to their arrival. It fell out of use in the 1980s as by then most of the British African-Caribbean community had been born in the UK. The term \\"banana boat\\" is perhaps best known today in the context of Harry Belafonte's 1956 hit recording \\"Day-O (The Banana Boat Song)\\".

Following the fall of the ethnic-Jie Later Zhao regime in 350 to the Chinese state of Ran Wei, tensions were high. The Jie people, who had formed the Later Zhao Dynasty, did not accept Ran Min's rule and rose against him; they were joined by many other Wǔ Hú nations also opposed to Ran Min. The resulting war ended with a decisive victory for Ran Min, who then proceeded to issue his famous \\"extermination order\\", which resulted in the extermination of virtually all of the Jie and most of the Wu Hu. Background By 350, struggles within the Jie Later Zhao regime benefited Ran Min, who took over the regime and massacred the entire Shi family, who ruled Later Zhao, with the exception of one cousin of Shi Jian, the last emperor of Later Zhao. Later, however, that cousin led an uprising against Ran Min, beginning the Wei–Jie war. Course of the warOutbreak of the war= Shi Jian's cousin, Shi Zhi, had been a Later Zhao general at Xiāngguó (). When he heard that Ran Min had massacred the Shi family and declared himself emperor, Shi Zhi rebelled against Ran Min. He was quickly joined by several other Later Zhao border armies, mostly of Jie soldiers who despised Ran Min's rule.Li and Zheng, pg 402 =Extermination of the Wu Hu= When he heard of the Jie revolt against him, Ran Min issued his infamous \\"extermination order\\", in which he called on the (Han) Chinese to kill all the Wǔ Hú. The Wǔ Hú had conquered Ran Wei half a century earlier. The effect of Ran Min's order was immense; some 200,000 Jie were killed in Ye city (the Wei capital [邺城]) in a few days, and brutal fighting broke out between Chinese and Wǔ Hú throughout North China. Ran Min's army also killed some 400,000 White Xiongnus. =Battle of Xiangguo= Meanwhile, Ran Min's army met the main rebel forces under Shi Zhi and defeated them at the Battle of Yecheng. In the spring of 351, Ran Min besieged Shi Zhi's capital, Xiāngguó. Shi Zhi sought aid from Former Yan's prince Murong Jun and was able to deal Ran a major defeat. At this time, the Xiongnu soldiers in Yecheng also rebelled, captured Ran Min's son Ran Yin, and surrendered to Shi Zhi, who executed Ran Yin. Ran Min was thought to be dead, but when he appeared in Yecheng, the city was calmed. Shi Zhi ordered his general Liu Xian (劉顯) to besiege Yecheng, but Ran Min defeated Liu in the siege, awing the latter so much that Liu agreed that upon his return to Xiāngguó he would kill Shi Zhi and surrender. He did so and sent Shi Zhi's head to Ran Min, who had the head burned on a busy street in Yecheng. The Later Zhao dynasty was at its final end. The city of Xiāngguó was burned, and its population moved to Yecheng. =End of the war= Following the victory at Xiāngguó, Ran Min's forces proceeded northwards and defeated two Later Zhao border armies. Wherever he captured territory from the rebels, Ran Min's forces massacred any Wǔ Hú living there, burying their bodies in large pits. Some 100,000 were reputedly killed in this way. Thousands of Wǔ Hú fled China or were killed. The Jie were particularly hard hit; they were virtually completely wiped out.

They are nocturnal predators that hide during the day in small retreats. Appearance The body of P. marginemaculatus can measure up to long, but its front legs can reach long. It has eight legs, of which six are used for walking and the first two are employed as sensory organs for detecting prey and navigating their environment. Its cephalothorax is wider than it is long and is outfitted with eight eyes. One pair of eyes is located in front and three more pairs are found on the sides. They produce no venom, but instead have pinching pedipalps and a pair of smaller chelicerae. Behavior P. marginemaculatus use three pairs of ambulatory legs to move sideways as a crab would and one pair for sensory purposes. They capture prey using, arm-like pedipalps. P. marginemaculatus engage in agonistic interactions, where opponents use a series of displays. Reproduction To reproduce, the male and female P. marginemaculatus by exhibiting ritualized displays in a stereotyped sequence. Males deposit a spermatophore which the female retrieves to fertilize eggs. After a few weeks to months, she exudes a brood sac containing from 12 to 20 eggs. These develop over a three-month period, and after hatching the female will then carry the first instars on her back for about ten days until they molt. About two years are needed for the young to reach adulthood, with adult life expectancy around another two to three years.

These worms are found mainly near the Florida Keys and Puerto Rico. They can be found on the sea bottom near rocks and sand. They live buried in the sand where they create a tube-like structure. They extend their thin white tentacles out of the top of the tube in which they dwell.  Diet  Eupolymnia crassicornis are deposit feeders that primarily feed at evening or night. They extend their ciliated tentacles out and along the sea-floor to gather dead organic matter (detritus) that originated as diatoms and other planktonic microorganisms. The collected detritus is then passed along a groove in their tentacles to their mouth, to be consumed.  Anatomy  External = Spaghetti worms have tentacles that extend outside their burrow for a considerable distance. The bodies of spaghetti worms are segmented. The tentacles can grow over one meter long. The tentacles are used to wrap around their prey and bring it closer to the mouth. Eupolymnia crasscornis also has inner and outer lips for food gathering. They have adopted this way of life to protect their bodies from predators like gastropods and fish. They also share their burrow/home with other creatures such as the tube pea crab Pinnixa chaetopterana which they also use for protection. Spaghetti worms use three pairs of branched gills for breathing. = Internal = Spaghetti worms have a well-developed gut consisting of an oesophagus, fore-stomach, closed circulatory system, hind-stomach and intestine, and use enzymes to help carry out digestion.  Reproduction  Spaghetti worms reproduce externally. They have lecithotropic larvae.

Selected discography  The Requiem remains still somewhat in the background of other Bruckner's works. Most of the about 20 recordings of it are live performances, which were not brought to the commercial market. According to Hans Roelofs, Schönzeler's 1970 LP recording, which was a true pioneer work, has, in spite of subsequent recordings, hold his status. Matthew Best's CD recording is currently still the reference. Farnberger's recording (1997) with the St. Florianer Sängerknaben, which was recorded in the St. Florian Abbey, provides the listener with a whiff of authenticity. Out of the more recent recordings, Roelofs picks out Janssens' recording of 2006 with the Laudantes Consort, and Susana Acra-Brache's recording of 2010 with the Grupo Vocal Matisses.Roelofs' commented discography of Bruckner's Requiem * Hans-Hubert Schönzeler, Requiem & 4 Orchestral Pieces, Alexandra Choir, London Philharmonic Orchestra, Robert Munns (Organ) – LP: Unicorn UNS 210, 1970 * Hans Michael Beuerle, Requiem in D minor, Laubacher Kantorei and Instrumental- Ensemble Werner Keltsch – LP: Cantate 658 231, 1972.

A Grammy Award- nominated vocalist, violinist, and composer. She is a member of the alternative rock band, Poi Dog Pondering. She has also worked with a long list of famous musicians. She has worked on film scores for movie and television soundtracks. She has continued with her own solo career, she has released two albums, which have received positive reviews. As a writer, she has published a book with Billboard/Random House in 2007; The Musicians Guide to the Road. Biography Voelz was born and raised in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin in the United States. As a child, she discovered her grandfather's violin in the attic of the family home, and began to learn to play. Nurtured by family members who each played a variety of instruments, she frequently joined in playing in the family concerts in the living room, now saying in retrospect \\"We were cheerful and awful.\\" Discovering in secondary school that the violin could be played in rock music and other genres of music opened up new possibilities, and encouraged her to continue practicing her craft. It was during this period that Voeltz found a used acoustic guitar for $25 and learned to play it, although the violin never ceased to be her primary instrument. After graduating high school, Voelz majored in English and in Music (Violin), graduating from Indiana University. After relocating several times, she found herself living in what had become a college town with a thriving mecca for artists during that time: Austin, Texas. She began playing and performing with musicians she met there, including Ronnie Lane, who had relocated to Austin with former bandmate Ian McLagan, both of Small Faces/Faces fame. They performed in a short-term band dubbed the Seven Samurai. During this period, she found opportunities to perform as a backing musician with others on tour, including John Mellencamp and Alejandro Escovedo. Voelz was offered work by the Hawaiian band Poi Dog Pondering, who had relocated to Austin and were searching for a fiddler for their planned debut album. The combination clicked, and she has now contributed to 13 albums with the band. Voelz has worked composing music and assembling film scores for movies, documentaries and educational tools. She composed the score for the Frontline television series The Lost Children of Rockdale County, which won the Peabody Award, as well as the follow-up Merchants of Cool. She also worked on projects for PBS educational documentaries. Traveling as a sideman with a variety of musicians, working as a session musician in the studios, Voelz has performed with numerous famous performers, and continues to do so.

Jōmyō-ji is Number Five of the five temples known as Kamakura Gozan (\\"Kamakura's Five Mountains\\"), and the only one of the five not founded by a member of the Hōjō clan. Jōmyō-ji has instead, as nearby Zuisen-ji, deep ties with the Ashikaga clan, and was one of the family's funeral temples (bodaiji).Harada (2008, 56) For this reason the family's kamon, or crest, is ubiquitous on its premises. The first three characters of its full name mean \\"Inari mountain\\", presumably from the hill of the same name where it stands, in its turn named after an ancient Inari myth (see below). Jōmyō-ji has given its name to the surrounding area, the characters for which have been however deliberately changed from to . History Jōmyō-ji was founded in 1188 by priest Taikō Gyōyū 退耕行勇 (1163–1241) as a Mikkyō temple with the name Gokuraku-ji but, soon after the first Japanese Zen monastery, nearby Kenchō-ji, was founded in 1253, the temple's head priest Geppō Ryōnen changed its denomination to Rinzai and its name to the present one.Kamiya (2008:108–110) The date when this happened isn't known exactly, but it's thought to lie between 1257 and 1288. Ashikaga Sadauji, father of future shōgun Ashikaga Takauji, was Jōmyō-ji's sponsor and, with his help, it quickly grew in size and importance. (The temple's name actually derives from Jōmyōjiden, Sadauji's posthumous name.) We know for example that in 1323 fifty of Jōmyō-ji priests participated at a ceremony in memory of Hōjō Sadatoki and that at the time the temple was ranked tenth for importance in Kamakura. According to the Taiheiki, at the end of his life Ashikaga Tadayoshi was imprisoned and then poisoned here. Jōmyō-ji's Main Hall (Hondō)In the second half of the 14th century shōgun Ashikaga Yoshimitsu in Kyoto formally established the network of Zen temples called Five Mountain System (Gozan seido in Japanese) to help the shogunate rule the country. Jōmyō-ji was fifth of the Kamakura Gozan, the five temples which presided over the system's Kantō sector, and was given facilities worthy of its status, including over 20 '. However, in 1438 Kamakura Kubō Ashikaga Mochiuji rebelled against Kyoto's shogunate, was defeated and was forced to kill himself to avoid capture. After his death Kamakura's decline, which had started when shōgun Ashikaga Takauji had decided to move his capital to Kyoto, accelerated further, and the Kamakura Gozan followed the city into obscurity and neglect. When poet Gyōe in the summer of 1487 visited the temple, found it invaded by grasses and moss. During the turbulent Sengoku period Jōmyō-ji, as the city in general, was to suffer a lot of violence and destruction. Points of interest The Kisen-an tea house and the Zen garden For the role it had in the area's history, Jōmyō- ji has been declared a National Historical Site. After the main gate (sanmon) in the middle of the temple's large garden stands the Main Hall (the Hon-dō, see photo above). Its structure is however not that of a typical Zen Butsuden, but rather that of an 8×6 hōjō (chief priest's living quarters) with raised floors. Destroyed by fire in 1748, it was rebuilt in 1754 using in part original Muromachi period timber salvaged from the old edifice. The main object of worship is a seated figure of Shaka Nyorai carved in wood during the Nanboku-chō period. The temple also owns a seated figure of founding priest Taikō Gyōyū (the temple's only Important Cultural Property), a statue of goddess Shō-Kannon, another of Fujiwara no Kamatari (an ancestor of the Fujiwara clan), and one of Kōjin, the god of the kitchen and cooking. The hōkyōintō in the cemetery behind the Hon-dō is said to be Ashikaga Sadauji's grave, but the attribution has been questioned by scholars because of the date it bears, sixty years after Sadauji's recorded date of death. The temple includes a recently restored tea house called where monks used to meet to have tea, but which is now open to the public. In front of the tea house lies a karesansui, or Zen rock garden. On the premises there is also a restaurant and bakery owned and operated by the temple itself. Near the temple can be found the ruins of , Ashikaga Tadayoshi's family temple (he was often called ) where he was buried after he died. =The origins of the name Kamakura= Fujiwara no Kamatari On the hill behind the temple lies a small shrine called which, in spite of its insignificant appearance, is of a certain historical importance both because of its age (it dates back to the seventh century) and its role in a legend related to Kamakura's name. The plaque next to the shrine explains that kami Inari gave young Fujiwara no Kamatari a sickle which would magically protect him as long as it was in his possession. In 645 A.D., having defeated Soga no Iruka, Kamatari came to the Kantō and there he dreamed of Inari, who told him: \\"I gave you the sickle to protect you, but now that you have achieved your goal of defeating Iruka, you must give it back to me and to the land.\\" Kamatari buried the sickle, and on the spot was erected the shrine that carries his name. According to the same legend, the name Kamakura means \\"the place where Kamatari buried his sickle\\".This is one version of the tale.

Located in Oakland, CA, the educational facility and \\"political institution\\" was founded in November 2007 by medical marijuana activist Richard Lee to offer quality training for the cannabis industry, with a mission to \\"legitimize the business and work to change the law to make cannabis legal.\\" Its main campus is located in the Oaksterdam area of Downtown Oakland, California. The university once had campuses in Los Angeles, Sebastopol, and Michigan. Currently the only brick & mortar campus resides in Oakland. As of recently, the school has taken their program on the road, conducting 2 to 4 day seminars in order to meet the demand for education. Oaksterdam has conducted seminars in Atlantic City, Denver, Las Vegas, Washington D.C., and Orlando, FL, with many more cities on the agenda. History Activist Richard Lee was inspired to create Oaksterdam University after visiting the Cannabis College in Amsterdam. Lee recalled: The university offered its first classes to 22 students in November 2007. As of November 2009, the university has thus far graduated nearly 25,000 students from over 30 countries. =Raid= A masked DEA agent during the April 2, 2012 raid On April 2, 2012, Oaksterdam University was raided by the IRS, accompanied by the DEA and US Marshals Service. The raid additionally targeted Coffeeshop Blue Sky and the Oaksterdam museum, both affiliated with Oaksterdam University. A number of the university's assets were seized, including plants, records, computers and bank accounts. Due to the city of Oakland's support of the university, the Oakland Police Department was not informed of the raid. Subsequently, on the same day, there was a shooting in a nearby school. As a result, the Oakland Police Dept. wasn't prepared to handle the numerous protestors (which included city council members ) and respond to the shooting in time. Oaksterdam University continued to put on classes less than 48 hours later. Incorrect reports often cite that the event was conducted by the DEA. Although the university was only one of many businesses under the corporate umbrella subject to the investigation, it was the Oaksterdam University name that was mentioned in the news due to its on-air and international recognition. No charges have been filed. Richard Lee retired, dissolving his interest in his businesses, paving the way for a new generation of leadership. After the raid, Oaksterdam University officials stated that they would immediately reopen. Founder Richard Lee said following the raid that he'll be giving up ownership of the organization, citing mounting debt and concern for incurring federal charges. School officials continued to teach classes. The university has since graduated 25,000 students and continues to add more programs. Curriculum The university's curriculum reaches all aspects of the medical marijuana industry, from horticulture to legal issues, politics, history, civics, economics, extracts, topical applications, business management, dispensary management, delivery business, cooking with cannabis and much more. The school has two main programs. The classic curriculum is a more comprehensive track that teaches students about the industry. The horticulture track teaches about growing cannabis specifically. Each program can be taken in either 14-week semesters, offered in the summer, spring and fall or every other weekend in fast track, seminar format. Seminars are 2 to 4 days, conducted on weekends, which include lessons and lectures on politics, legal issues, horticulture, as well as business management. Oaksterdam University recently offered a CME and CNE course in Orlando, FL where physicians and nurses received continuing education credits. The activity was approved for AMA PRA Category 1 Credits. Notable faculty * Dale Sky Jones – chancellor * Ed Rosenthal – author of books on cannabis horticulture * Richard Lee – founder of Oaksterdam University, proponent of California's Proposition 19 (2010) * Chris Conrad – author of cannabis history and industrial hemp Opposition Opposition to the university has been shown by the Drug Enforcement Administration, which claims the school \\"sends the wrong message in the country's fight against drugs and promotes criminal activity.\\" Opinion has since changed. More doctors including U.S. surgeon general Vivek Murthy said that marijuana can be helpful, Retired DEA Administrative Law Judge Francis L. Young stated \\"The evidence in this record [9-6-88 ruling] clearly shows that marijuana has been accepted as capable of relieving the distress of great numbers of very ill people, and doing so with safety under medical supervision. It would be unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious for DEA to continue to stand between those sufferers and the benefits of this substance in light of the evidence in this record.\\" The ongoing legal risk to the university has also recently shifted in light of new federal guidance released by the Cole Memorandum on August 29, 2013, which de- emphasized federal prosecutions of cannabis businesses in states which had legalized the drug for medical or other adult use.

These victories were the basis of the prosperity of the Reign of Yuanjia. Background Following Jin's victory at the Battle of Fei River, North China divided into several non-ethnically Chinese lead states. After Liu Yu, one of the most excellent generals of the Northern and Southern dynasties period, came to power in Jin, Liu Yu saw the opportunity to recover the areas of China's heartland which were under foreign rule. Expeditions1st expedition against Southern Yan= Liu Yu's first expedition was against Southern Yan in 409 CE. The Jin army attacked from Nanjing to Xiapei, and then to Longchen. Along the roads, Jin's forces built fortresses to prevent Southern Yan forces from cutting off their supplies. By May, Jin forces reached the Southern Yan capital at Guangdu. When he reached the area, Liu Yu saw that the ground was covered with grain and he said to his men that: \\"The Southern Yan ruler is already in my hand\\", as there would be no supply problems. In February 410 CE, Jin forces captured Guangdu and put an end to Southern Yan. =2nd expedition against Later Qin= In 416 CE, Liu Yu launched a major attack against Later Qin, defeating its general, Yao Shao. After this victory, Liu Yu recovered Luoyang, the former capital of the Jin dynasty and was crowned Duke of Song. To complete his victory, he sent two armies into Shaanxi to engage the remnants of Later Qin's forces. On their way there, the Jin forces were harassed by Northern Wei cavalry, who attacked the Jin forces' supply routes. In a major engagement, Jin forces defeated Northern Wei forces using crossbows to launch spears through the Wei forces, frightening them and reputedly killing some 30,000 Wei soldiers. Following this victory, Jin forces continued on Later Qin and captured its capital Chang'an, destroying it. =Loss of Chang'an region= Following this victory, it seemed that Jin would quickly destroy Xia, Northern Wei and the remaining barbarian states, reunifying China. However, Liu Yu went back to Nanjing on rumors of the death of Emperor An of Jin, leaving his general Wang Zhen'en in charge. Xia forces took the opportunity to attack, and captured the Chang'an region from Jin. Nevertheless, Jin still held most of China's territory south of the Yellow river, the traditional heartland of China. Aftermath These victories laid the foundation for the Reign of Yuanjia, a period of relative prosperity as the Chinese heartlands fell under native rule rather than be subject to threats of invasion or constant warfare.

To differentiate the name of the valley from that of the suburb, the former is usually referred to as the Leith Valley, the latter simply as Leith Valley. The valley itself As its name suggests, it is the valley of the Water of Leith, a long stream which flows from the slopes of Mount Cargill south through the northern suburbs of Dunedin. The valley starts close to a saddle, Pigeon Flat, between it and the valley of the Waitati River, which is crossed by the Dunedin Northern Motorway. The motorway follows the flank of Mount Cargill's spur Pine Hill, which forms the northern boundary of the valley. The southern boundary is formed by Maori Hill, the northernmost part of a long ridge which forms a crescent around central Dunedin, culminating at Lookout Point in the city's southwest. The valley starts steeply in bush-clad countryside, before widening into a narrow flood plain occupied by the start of Dunedin's suburban area. The valley widens, and is hemmed in by steep slopes and occasional cliff faces before joining the northern end of the wide plain which is the location of Dunedin's CBD some from the coast. At its mouth, the valley is some in width. Much of Dunedin's water supply comes from reservoirs in the upper reaches of the Leith Valley. These include Ross Creek Reservoir, the oldest reservoir still in active use in New Zealand, and Sullivans Dam. Numerous popular walking tracks traverse the bush-clad reserve land surrounding this reservoir. The suburbs The term \\"Leith Valley\\" can be used to refer to the semi-rural settlement which lies in the upper reaches of the valley, or - more generally - for both this community and the two suburbs which lie in the lower valley, Glenleith and Woodhaugh. =Leith Valley= Leith Valley is as much a rural settlement as a suburb, though it does lie within the Dunedin city boundaries very close to the edge of the city's main urban area. It is connected by Leith Valley Road, which follows the course of the river, crossing the Dunedin Northern Motorway by bridge towards its northern end. From here it runs roughly parallel with both the river and motorway before connecting with the latter at the Leith Saddle. At its southern end, Leith Valley Road becomes Malvern Street, the main route through Glenleith. =Glenleith= Ross Creek Reservoir. The main suburban area within the Leith valley is roughly split into two suburbs - Glenleith in the upper valley and Woodhaugh close to the valley's mouth. The two suburbs, and particularly Glenleith, were both heavily industrialised during the early years of Dunedin, with the power of the Leith being harnessed for sawmills from 1850 and for flour mills shortly thereafter. The first commercial paper mill in New Zealand was located in the valley, the last overgrown remains of which can still be seen close to a walking track. The main road through Glenleith is Malvern Street, which runs from the Leith Valley Road in the upper valley to meet with Duke Street in Woodhaugh. Most of Glenleith's residences are located either on this street or around Fulton Road, a steep street which rises from Malvern Street, passing through forestry plantations before joining the end of Wakari Road near Helensburgh. A third main road, Rockside Road, runs from Malvern Street close to the boundary between Glenleith and Woodhaugh, winding uphill through the same plantations before becoming Tanner Road and joining with Wakari Road. These plantations contain numerous walking tracks, and also contain the historically listed Ross Creek Reservoir, constructed in the late 1860s. The walking tracks circumnavigate the dam, as well as following the banks of the Ross Creek and School Creek, two small tributaries of the Leith. Another major walking track, the Pineapple Track, has its northeastern end close to Fulton Road. This track traverses Flagstaff, a hill which dominates the city's western skyline. =Woodhaugh= Prospect Park immediately to the south. The Gardens Corner, at the mouth of North East Valley, is visible in the background, top right. The Water of Leith at the northern end of Woodhaugh Gardens. Woodhaugh is the suburban part of the Leith Valley which lies below the Rockside Road intersection. At its top, it houses numerous older stone buildings, many of them of some historical significance. Lower down, the suburb is dominated by Woodhaugh Gardens, a large area of parkland and trees that forms part of Dunedin's Town Belt. Once a quarry, this is one of the city's oldest parks, dating from 1895. The area around the park is known as Woodhaugh and is a popular area for student accommodation, as it is only 15 minute walk to the university and the centre of the city. Most of Woodhaugh's residential area lies on Malvern Street, on Woodhaugh Street, a crescent in the upper part of the suburb, or on the small number of short streets close to the valley's mouth. At this point, Malvern Street becomes Duke Street, which intersects with the city's main commercial street, George Street at the valley's mouth. The suburb's only retail outlet, a dairy and grocery store, is located at the junction of Duke Street and George Street. A series of walkways runs through Woodhaugh Gardens and along the banks of the Leith. One of these follows the course of the stream from the northern end of Woodhaugh Gardens to connect with the Ross Creek tracks, passing as it does a major weir (the Boulder Trap) which was put in to prevent a repeat of the major flooding of the Leith in the early 20th century. The walkway also passes the remains of the former Woodhaugh Quarry, which operated until 1949. The sides of the Leith Valley are notably steep, especially in the area around the start of Rockside Road (also the location of the confluence of the Ross Creek and Leith). At this point, steep cliffs flank the valley, and nearby the Ross Creek passes through a narrow canyon. In the lower reaches of the valley, the valley's walls are still steep, though not vertical. The Dunedin Northern Motorway skirts the northern edge as it passes by the suburb of Dalmore, and along the southern edge of the valley, a walking track rises sharply, connecting Woodhaugh with Prospect Park, New Zealand. This track, the Bullock track, was originally part of a trail used by farmers taking cattle from the farms of North East Valley to abattoirs in Burnside, Otago. Notable features Notable buildings in the Leith Valley include the Ross Creek Reservoir pumphouse, the historically significant 'Bishop's See House' at number 1 Malvern, also known as Hawthornden, and a former public house on the corner of Malvern Street and Woodhaugh Street, close to the bridge carrying Malvern Street over the Leith. This building operated as a public house between 1888 and 1892. Woodhaugh Gardens is home to the Leith valley Bowling Club, one of the city's main lawn bowls clubs. A notable natural feature of the valley is the glow worm area off Leith Valley Road, accessible by the Nichols Falls walking track, a 40-minute walk.

It comprises Borobudur, Mendut, and Pawon. The temples were built during the Shailendra dynasty around the 8th and 9th centuries CE, and fall on a straight line. Approximately northwest of Yogyakarta, Borobudur sits on a plateau between two twin volcanoes, Sundoro-Sumbing and Merbabu-Merapi, and two rivers, the Progo and the Elo. According to local myth, the area known as Kedu Plain is a Javanese sacred place and has been dubbed 'the garden of Java' due to its high agricultural fertility.Soekmono (1976), page 1. Alignment Three temples - Borobudur, Pawon and Mendut - fall on a straight line During restoration in the early 20th century, it was discovered that three Buddhist temples in the region, Borobudur, Pawon and Mendut, fall on a straight line. This may be coincidence, but is in agreement with a native folk tale that there was an ancient brick road from Borobudur to Mendut with walls on both sides. The three temples have similar architecture and ornamentation, which suggests a ritual relationship between them to form a sacred unity, although the exact ritual process is unknown.  Museums  There are two museums within Borobudur Temple Compounds, Karmawibhangga Museum and Samudra Raksa Museum. {  Image:Borobudur Temple Compounds-111338.jpgBorobudur Temple Image:Mendut Temple Afternoon.jpgMendut Temple Image:Pawon.jpgPawon Temple Image:Borobudur Temple Compounds-111340.jpgDetail on wall }  Other archaeological sites  View of Borobudur Temple Compounds Borobudur Temple Compounds Other Buddhist temples and Hindu temples are scattered in the area.

According to an Canggal inscription discovered in the temple complex, the Shivaite King Sanjaya commissioned a Shivalinga sanctuary to be built on the Wukir hill, only east of Borobudur. Ngawen temple is found to the east of Mendut temple. The ruin of Banon temple, a Hindu temple, is several hundred meters north of Pawon temple. It could not be reconstructed because many stones are missing, but several stone statues of Hindu gods were found in good condition.

Made up of conservative women, they used the court system to facilitate enforcing existing legislation. They are most known for filing cases against higher education institutions across the United States to address discriminatory hiring and promotion practices. They also successfully litigated over help- wanted advertisements being sex-segregated, extending military spousal benefits to husbands of female service personnel, and over the extent to which the Department of Defense could involve itself in the lives of military spouses. History The Women's Equity Action League (WEAL) was founded in 1968,Castro, Ginette, trans. Elizabeth Loverde-Bagwell, American Feminism: A Contemporary History (N.Y.: N.Y. Univ. Press, 1990 ()), p. 264 (trans. from Radioscopie du féminisme américain (Paris, France: Presses de la Fondation Nationale des Sciences Politiques, 1984) (French)) (author prof. Eng. lang. & culture, Univ. of Bordeaux III, France). by Elizabeth M. Boyer, during the 2nd wave feminist movement. The organization was founded in Cleveland, Ohio and headquartered in Washington, D.C., as a \\"spin-off\\" of the National Organization for Women (NOW) by more conservative women.Castro, Ginette, trans. Elizabeth Loverde-Bagwell, American Feminism, op. cit., pp. 62 & 176. WEAL did not support the radical platforms of women's liberationists, nor controversial issues such as abortion, child care, divorce, violence against women, and sexuality.Castro, Ginette, trans. Elizabeth Loverde-Bagwell, American Feminism, op. cit., p. 62. WEAL focused instead on equal opportunities for women in education, economics, and employment.Castro, Ginette, trans. Elizabeth Loverde-Bagwell, American Feminism, op. cit., pp. 62 and see pp. 216–218. Among their goals were to extend the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to ban sex discrimination in all programs which received federal funding and extend the equal opportunity employment provisions to educational institutions. They also pressed for the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to extend to administrative, executive, and professional employees the provision of equal pay for equal work and worked to promote investigation by the Civil Rights Commission on discrimination against women. They were strongly supportive of the Equal Rights Amendment and worked with NOW in support of the ERA. In 1969, WEAL members discovered that Executive Order 11246, signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965, had been amended by Executive Order 11375 in 1968 to include language that federal contractors could not discriminate on the basis of sex. As there was no exemption for educational institutions, as there had been in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, WEAL launched a national campaign filing a class action suit against every college and university in the United States. It was their most successful campaign to reduce sexism, as it allowed them to compile statistics on the level of discrimination in academia and press the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, (HEW) to enforce the executive orders. The organization published the WEAL Washington Report, Better Late than Never: Financial Aid for Older Women, and newsletters on issues of concern to women, including executive and legislative actions and court decisions. WEAL established a tax-exempt fund which supported lawsuits and monitored implementation and enforcement of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, dealing with academic discrimination in pay and tenure. They filed complaints against academic institutions at the Office of Federal Contract Compliance. They also instituted a lawsuit against The Pittsburgh Press for segregating employment advertisements by sex. NOW joined the effort, which escalated to the Supreme Court, and ultimately eliminated the practice of sex-segregated advertising. Later that year, an internal disagreement over whether to pursue action in a pregnancy-discrimination case, which would become Cleveland Board of Education v. LaFleur, caused Jane Pinker to resign from the board. She and WEAL members who followed her formed the Women's Law Fund and successfully litigated LaFleur. Those who remained with WEAL, filed a sex-discrimination case in 1973, Frontiero v. Richardson to secure military benefits for the spouse of a female officer. In 1977, they won a court order in Adams v. Califano, requiring HEW and the Department of Labor to enforce federal law and hire adequate staff to clear the pending cases of sex- discrimination. WEAL also sought to remove gender as a factor in insurance ratings and lobbied for passage of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978. Throughout the 1980s, WEAL worked on cases regarding women and the military, pressing for changes in the classification of jobs for which women were ineligible and the way military spouses were treated. In 1987, they won a case which barred the Department of Defense from interfering in the careers of military spouses. Up to that point, servicemembers' spouses could be pressured to give up civilian careers or the amount of time they devoted to volunteer activities in the military community could be used to limit promotion opportunities of servicementers. WEAL dissolved in 1989.

He was notably a regular performer at the Metropolitan Opera between 1957 and 1961, and he sang in several world premieres with the New York City Opera. He also notably translated Engelbert Humperdinck's Hänsel und Gretel into English, a version first performed in 1967 and used by opera companies to this present day. Biography Kelley was born and raised in Eddington, Maine, the oldest child of John Kelley and Janet Kelley (née Shiels) Kelley. At the age of 16, he moved to Boston with the intention of training to be a minister at Gordon College. However, an advertisement for acting instruction at the Leland School caught his eye and, after auditioning, he won a scholarship to the school which enabled him to pursue studies in theatre and music. He entered the New England Conservatory where he began studying singing seriously. He then attended Pasadena College where he appeared in numerous student theatre productions. In the 1930s, he sang on the stage of the Radio City Music Hall in New York City and appeared on the radio shows of Voice of Firestone and Major Bowes Amateur Hour, where he won second prize, an upright piano. He eventually won a scholarship to the Eastman School of Music to pursue graduate studies. Kelley's operatic career was put on hold however with the outbreak of World War II. He served in the United States Army from 1940 to 1945, performing on the radio show Fort Bragg Salutes America. In 1944, he married opera singer Maria Paradiso with whom he had two children. They divorced in 1969. Kelley made his professional opera debut on December 11, 1947 as Mario Cavaradossi in Giacomo Puccini's Tosca with the Philadelphia La Scala Opera Company. He sang regularly with that company over the next two years in such roles as Alfredo in Giuseppe Verdi's La Traviata, Don José in Georges Bizet's Carmen, Pinkerton in Puccini's Madama Butterfly, Radamès in Verdi's Aida, and the title role in Charles Gounod's Faust. In 1948, he joined the San Carlo Opera Company touring North America in the role of Alfredo. Over the next decade, he traveled throughout North America, singing leading roles with such companies as the New Orleans Opera, the San Antonio Grand Opera Festival, the Pittsburgh Opera, the Miami Opera, the Baltimore Opera Company, the Opera Company of Boston, and the Houston Grand Opera. In 1950 Kelley made his Broadway debut as Magician Nika Magadoff in Gian Carlo Menotti's The Consul at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre. He portrayed the same role for his debut with the New York City Opera in 1952 and in the 1960 NBC television recording of the work. Kelley became a fixture at the New York City Opera during the 1950s and 1960s, including leading roles in four world premieres — the title role in Robert Kurka’s Good Soldier Schweik (1958), Reverend Samuel Parris in Robert Ward's The Crucible (1961), Lord Mark in Douglas Moore's The Wings of the Dove (1961), and Ely Pratt in Carlisle Floyd's The Passion of Jonathan Wade (1962). Other notable NYCO roles for Kelley included Pandarus in William Walton's Troilus and Cressida (1956); the Narrator in the U.S. premiere of Carl Orff's Der Mond (1956); Count Mancini in Ward's He Who Gets Slapped (1959); Mr. Scratch in Moore's The Devil and Daniel Webster (1959) and Méphistophélès in the U.S. premiere of Prokofiev's The Fiery Angel (1965). In 1952 Kelley sang in the United States premiere of Hugo Wolf's Der Corregidor at Carnegie Hall. In 1956 he portrayed the role of Belmonte in Mozart's Die Entführung aus dem Serail in Stratford, Connecticut in a production celebrating the bicentennial of Mozart's birth. The production was notably organized by Lincoln Kirstein and George Balanchine and led by music director Erich Leinsdorf. In August 1958 he portrayed the role of Dr. Zuckertanz in the world premiere of Menotti's Maria Golovin at the Brussels World's Fair. He stayed with the production when it moved to the Martin Beck Theatre on Broadway in November 1958. In 1957, Kelley joined the roster of principal tenors at the Metropolitan Opera where he sang frequently for the next four years. He made his debut with the company on January 18, 1957 portraying Mime in Richard Wagner's Das Rheingold. His other roles at the Met included Mime in Wagner's Siegfried, Don Basilio in Le Nozze di Figaro, Herod in Richard Strauss's Salome, Prince Shuisky in Mussorgsky's Boris Godunov, and Goro in Madama Butterfly among others. His final performance at the Met was as Alcindoro in Puccini's La Bohème on April 10, 1961. Kelley was also active on the international stage during the 1950s and 1960s, singing at such opera houses as the Palacio de Bellas Artes, La Monnaie, the Palais Garnier, the Opéra National de Lyon, Toulon Opera, Opéra national de Lorraine, Théâtre du Capitole, Opéra de Normandie, Teatro Nacional de São Carlos, Montreal Opera, Canadian Opera Company, and Vancouver Opera. In 1972 Kelley made his debut with the San Francisco Opera as Butler in the United States premiere of Gottfried von Einem's Der Besuch der alten Dame. He also appeared in many productions with the New York Gilbert and Sullivan Players during his career. Kelley died at the age of 95 of Alzheimer's disease in Rockland, Massachusetts.

It was founded by Gloria Steinem, Brenda Feigen Fasteau and Dorothy Pitman-Hughes. The board of directors of the WAA included several notable feminists such as Bella Abzug and Shirley Chisholm. The WAA's mission was to assist local activists through technical and communications support and through them, to create change on a national scale. The group created a network of feminist activists, coordinated resources, and led initiatives on a number of issues. The WAA helped to raise discussion for a national agenda of feminist legislation, developed strategies for countering gender stereotypes in developmental education, and helped open the first battered women's shelters. History The Women's Action Alliance (WAA) was established in 1971 during the Feminist Movement in the United States. It was founded by Gloria Steinem, Brenda Feigen Fasteau and Dorothy Pitman-Hughes, who combined their legacies in the civil rights movement to forge a network of activists dedicated to a vision of equality for all women. Its founding mission was to assist women by coordinating resources and bringing together individuals working at the grassroots level onto a broader national scale. Its founders intended to build on the previous success of the women's movement to effect further change in society's recognition and treatment of women. The WAA's goal was, according to the founders, to help the \\"large numbers of women who want to change their lot in life\\" by becoming a clearinghouse of women's information. Gloria Steinem chaired the board from 1971 to 1978. Among many other contributions, the WAA helped to open the first battered women's shelters. The WAA was dissolved in 1997 due to lack of funding.  Initiatives  The WAA attempted to connect women who wanted to \\"change their lot in life\\" with community organizations and professionals interested in feminist causes. Many early correspondences to the WAA asked for referrals to organizations that assisted women. Some asked for recommendations for female or feminist professionals (psychologists, lawyers, doctors, etc.). Others requested information about starting local feminist organizations or chapters. Referrals provided in response to these requests to the WAA were gathered by individual women using their connections in the community to network, collect and disseminate information, and recommend professionals and organizations with which they had positive experiences. = National Women's Agenda = In January 1975, President Gerald Ford founded the National Commission on the Observance of International Women's Year, or the IWY Commission. This commission was tasked with \\"encouraging cooperative activity in the field of women's rights and responsibilities\\". Many groups including the National Organization for Women (NOW) were dissatisfied, and were concerned that the commission was too cautious. This led the WAA to create the National Women's Agenda (NWA), a national agenda for feminist legislation. The WAA consulted with many organizations, 70 of which responded by May 1975 and 24 ultimately participated in creating the NWA. It advocated for many different causes and problems women and marginalized peoples faced. The agenda called on fair representation in government and other areas, the end to racial and cultural stereotyping, recognition of working women and homemakers as workers, and advocated for the causes of women in poverty, women affected by the criminal justice system, and bodily autonomy and integrity. In total, 94 women's groups and labor unions joined the coalition. Some of these organizations include: American Association of University Women, National Federation of Business and Professional Women's Clubs, Planned Parenthood, National Association of Social Workers, Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, National Coalition of American Nuns, Women Strike for Peace, YWCA, Amalgamated Clothing Workers, American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, National Organization for Women (NOW), National Abortion Rights Action League, National Women's Political Caucus, The Feminist Press, Women's Legal Defense Fund, National Gay Task Force, Lesbian Feminist Liberation, Mattachine Society and National Congress of Neighborhood Women. The NWA was eventually overshadowed by the National Plan of Action (the Plan) created by the 1977 National Women's Conference in Houston. The Houston plan had more \\"expansive\\" language and had more emphasis on minority women and abortion, while the NWA was more \\"terse\\" and had a clearer statement on welfare and health care. The National Women's Agenda Project collapsed in 1980. = Non-Sexist Childhood Development Initiative = The Non-Sexist Childhood Development Initiative was designed by the WAA to combat perceived sexism in preschools. The project was founded because of a number of letters the group received which expressed concerns regarding gender roles and gender conformity in preschools. The program received funding from a number of different foundations. To investigate sex-role conditioning, the WAA created programs to address sexism in preschools. In the fall of 1973, the initiative launched the program in four childhood education centers in New York. The program focused on four main activities: Teachers and school staff were instructed on harmful stereotypes that were being taught, raising their awareness to recognize such issues. Parents were educated on how sex-role stereotyping was harmful. A curriculum was developed to help children understand that men and women do all kinds of work inside and outside the home. The program also developed non-sexist multi- racial learning materials, toys and books. The WAA also developed of a curriculum guide called Non-Sexist Education for Young Children: A Practical Guide. This was the first non-sexist early education material for the classroom. = Women's Alcohol and Drug Education Project = In the 1970s, most substance rehabilitation and preventive programs were predominantly for white men with health insurance. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) awarded 40 grants for treatment programs specifically for women. However, due to blocked state grants in 1981, the programs like the WAA's Women's Alcohol and Drug Education Project were not funded until the late 1980s. Established in 1987, the WAA's Women's Alcohol and Drug Education Project addressed the need for substance abuse help for women, especially women of color and those in poverty. Paula Roth, director of the project in 1990, wrote Alcohol and Drugs Are Women's Issues. Its two volumes aimed to start a new conversation about substance abuse affecting minority women and poor women and to highlight substance abuse by women as \\"critical women's issues\\". The project created model programs in six women's centers across the United States, integrating an alcohol and drug component with the work being done with women at the facilities. Prevention was made a priority in addition to intervention. Substance abuse was put in the context of women's issues, because it was believed that information regarding substance abuse wouldn't reach women in poverty. = Women's Action Almanac = In 1979, the WAA published Women's Action Almanac: A Complete Resource Guide. It was a guidebook of women's issues and programs, organized by subject and included lists of women's organizations. The book was written and compiled by the WAA, and edited by Jane Williamson, Diane Winston and Wanda Wooten. The almanac was inspired by letters the WAA received seeking advice or information, demonstrating the need for a comprehensive directory of resources and services for women. = Others = In response to positive feedback, the WAA created its Beginning Equal program, which was similar to the Non-Sexist Childhood Development Initiative. Other projects included Women With Non-Traditional Occupations and Children of Single Parents in the Schools. The WAA created a program called Computer Equity, which gathered data used to encourage girls to become more comfortable with technology. Later programs, like the Teenage Pregnancy Prevention project, branched out into healthcare and gathered data and information by surveying the agencies involved.  The Sophia Smith Collection of WAA archives  The WAA received a large number of letters and generated a large amount of correspondence. There are 117.25 feet of records (over 300 boxes) located at the Sophia Smith Collection in Northampton, Massachusetts. This is the collection's largest processed archive to date. The letters document the history of the organization from its inception until its disbandment.

The route begins at US Highway 167 and Highway 58 in Cave City and runs northeast to Missouri Route 21 near Doniphan, Missouri, including a concurrency with US 62/US 412 between Imboden and Pocahontas. The highway is maintained by the Arkansas Department of Transportation (ARDOT). One of the original 1926 Arkansas state highways, modern-day Highway 115 was established as State Road 79 between Cave City and Missouri, largely along its modern alignment. The alignment was rerouted between Imboden to Smithville in 1928, and an overlap was created between Pocahontas and Imboden when US 62 was designated across the state in 1931. It was renumbered to Highway 115 to avoid duplication with US 79 in 1935. Route description Highway 115 begins at US 167/AR 58 (Main Street) in the small town of Cave City. The highway runs eastward in a concurrency with Highway 58 through the sparsely populated forest and pastures of the Central Plateu subregion of the Ozark Highlands. Highway 58 turns left, ending the concurrency at the unincorporated community of Emery, with Highway 115 continuing east through rural areas and unincorporated communities Ben-Gay and Calamine to enter Lawrence County. Entering the western side of the county, Highway 115 has an intersection with Highway 117 north of Jessup. The two routes form an overlap northward, crossing the Strawberry River and entering the small town of Smithville. The two routes turn eastward, passing the Smithville Public School Building, listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Highway 115 turns left in Smithville, ending the overlap and heading northward toward Imboden, passing a rural area populated with homes and small farms. Upon entering Imboden, Highway 115 curves northward around the Sloan-Hendrix School District campus and Imboden City Park before an intersection with US 62/US 63/US 412. Highway 115 overlaps with US 62 eastward to Pocahontas. In Pocahontas, Highway 115 turns left from US 62 to follow Highway 90 through downtown. Highway 115 splits from Highway 90 as Mansker Drive and runs north of the city to an intersection with Highway 251\\\\. It continues northeast as a rural highway, passing the NRHP-listed Cedar Grove School No. 81 and forming a concurrency with Highway 166 at Stokes before entering the small town of Maynard. A junction with Highway 328 in Maynard also ends the Highway 166 concurrency. Highway 115 continues north through a rural area, passing the unincorporated community of Middlebrook before crossing the Missouri state line, where it continues as Missouri Route 21. The ARDOT maintains Highway 115 like all other parts of the state highway system. As a part of these responsibilities, the Department tracks the volume of traffic using its roads in surveys using a metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT). ARDOT estimates the traffic level for a segment of roadway for any average day of the year in these surveys. As of 2018, the peak AADT on the highway was 5,000 vehicles per day (VPD) near Pocahontas, dropping to 800 VPD near the Missouri border. The AADT was under 2000 between Cave City and Imboden. No segment of Highway 115 has been listed as part of the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility. History During the 1926 Arkansas state highway numbering, a route similar to the present alignment of Highway 115 was created between Cave City and Missouri as State Road 79. By September 1928, State Road 79 was rerouted between Imboden and Smithville along a more direct route, with the former alignment becoming Highway 117. When US 62 was designated across Arkansas in 1931, it replaced State Road 79 between Imboden and Pocahontas. When US 79 was designated across Arkansas in 1935, the State Road 79 designation was changed to State Road 115 to avoid duplication. State Road 115, which had been an original state highway between El Dorado and Thornton in South Arkansas, was supplanted by US 167, which had been relocated as part of the US 79 designation.

Friedland (born December 20, 1937) is an American lawyer and Democratic Party politician from Hudson County, New Jersey who served in the New Jersey General Assembly from 1966 to 1974 and then was elected to the Senate, serving from 1978 until his conviction on racketeering charges in 1980. While awaiting sentencing, Friedland disappeared in September 1985 by faking his death in a supposed drowning incident off Grand Bahama. He was one of the U.S. government's most wanted fugitives until his capture in the Maldives in 1987, where he drew attention to himself after creating a successful chain of scuba diving shops. Early life Friedland was born in 1937 in Jersey City, New Jersey. His father was Jacob Friedland, a labor attorney who had served in the General Assembly from 1939 until 1952. He attended Stevens Academy in Hoboken and graduated from Tufts University in 1957. He received a law degree from Rutgers School of Law—Newark in 1960 and was admitted to the bar in 1961. His brother is musician and songwriter Stephen Friedland, also known as Brute Force. One man, one vote In the wake of the 1964 decision by the Supreme Court of the United States in Reynolds v. Sims, establishing the one man, one vote principle that state legislative districts must be approximately equal in size, Friedland filed suit in New Jersey Supreme Court on behalf of Christopher Jackman of the Laundry Workers Union and Winfield Chasmar, Jr. of the Paper Box Workers Union, challenging a system under which each county was represented by a single member in the New Jersey Senate. The Court agreed, holding the New Jersey Senate apportionment violated the Federal Constitution. In an attempt to avoid the decision, the senate enacted a proposal whereby each senator's vote would be weighted based on the population of the county represented, under which Cape May County's senator would receive one vote while the senator from Essex County would receive 19.1, in direct relation to the ratio of residents between counties.Wright, George Cable. \\"New Jersey High Court Orders Reapportionment of Legislature; Says Present Body Violates 'One Man, One Vote' Edict -- Urges New Law for '65 JERSEY ORDERED TO REAPPORTION\\", The New York Times, November 26, 1964. Accessed July 7, 2009. In a decision issued on December 15, 1964, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the weighted voting system as adopted was unconstitutional. The court ordered that interim measures be established for the 1965 legislative elections, in which weighted voting could be used as a temporary measure, and that the needed constitutional changes to restructure the New Jersey Legislature to be in compliance with \\"one man, one vote\\" requirements be in place before elections taking place in 1967.Wright, George Cable. \\"WEIGHTED VOTING VOIDED IN JERSEY; State's Highest Court Bars Senate's Plan -- No Ruling on Its Constitutionality New Jersey Supreme Court Bars Senate's Weighted Vote Plan\\", The New York Times, December 16, 1964.

Accessed May 20, 2009. In a judicial finding announced in February 1971 after a hearing by the New Jersey Supreme Court, Friedland was found to have violated judicial ethics for his efforts in attempting to get charges dropped against an alleged Mafia loan shark. Friedland faced potential disbarment by the court and could have faced censure or expulsion by the New Jersey Legislature.Sullivan, Ronald. \\"A Jersey Legislator Cited on Bar Ethics; 2d Guilty in U.S. Suit; A Jersey Legislator Cited on Ethics; 2d Guilty in U.S. Court\\", The New York Times, February 24, 1971.

Friedland asserted that he had done nothing wrong and would run for re- election. He insisted that as \\"[t]here had been no charge of impropriety in connection with [his] legislative duties\\", he expected the General Assembly would take no action against him.Staff. \\"JERSEY SUSPENDS LAW PRACTICE OF 3; Friedland, Minority Leader of Assembly, Is Cited\\", The New York Times, July 28, 2009.

Brennan the 3rd on December 30, 1968, in which Brennan accused Friedland and two other legislators of being \\"entirely too comfortable with members of organized crime\\". Brennan's testimony was based on New Jersey State Police files which alleged that Friedland had acted as the middleman to suppress criminal complaints against a loan shark. Friedland denied Brennan's allegations and demanded his resignation, stating that he had been attempting to settle a usurious loan and that he had not talked to any of the complaining witnesses.Sullivan, Ronald. \\"BRENNAN EXPLAINS LEGISLATORS' LINKS TO JERSEY MAFIA; Concedes Three Men Named May Have Acted Solely in Role of Lawyers\\", The New York Times, December 31, 1968.

He justified his actions based on claims that the Democratic leadership had been ignoring the needs of Hudson County, and was joined by Hudson County legislators Michael F. Esposito and David Wallace, along with Edward J. Higgins from nearby Elizabeth. As part of the deal with the Republicans, Friedland was appointed as chair of the bipartisan Assembly Conference Committee. Democratic leaders in the Assembly had pushed for S. Howard Woodson of Trenton, New Jersey, who would have been the Assembly's first African American Speaker, and charges of racism were leveled by fellow Democrats against Friedland. Democratic Assemblyman Kenneth A. Gewertz of Gloucester County shouted that \\"Jesus Christ had his Judas, the Democrats now have their David Friedland\\". Friedland had wanted the Democrats to name him as Speaker, but they declined based on his involvement in the loan sharking case and that recent political scandals in Hudson County would reflect poorly on Democrats statewide. Instead, they had named S. Howard Woodson as their candidate for speaker. The four defections denied Woodson a chance to become the first African American Speaker in the history of the General Assembly, leading to charges that the dissidents were racially motivated.Sullivan, Ronald. \\"4 Democrats Give G.O.P.

Marlin, an attorney who had been convicted of swindling $43 million in various schemes.

On April 11, 1980, Friedland and his father were convicted by a jury for taking kickbacks in arranging loans from the Teamsters pension fund, income tax evasion and obstruction of justice for asking a witness to lie to a grand jury. Still proclaiming his innocence and insisting that he was not obligated to resign as the acts for which he was convicted took place prior to his election, Friedland stated that he would resign immediately from his Senate seat to devote his time to an appeal of the verdict.Narvaez, Alfonso A. \\"Jersey Legislator and Father Guilty of Taking Kickbacks; To Be Sentenced May 27 Marlin's Sentence Was Cut\\", The New York Times, April 12, 1980.

In 1982, he reached an agreement with the United States Attorney's office in Newark, New Jersey under which he would avoid prison in exchange for his assistance in recording incriminating conversations with his former associates. The Government was later to argue that Friedland deceived them, faked his death in order not to cooperate, and did not in fact cooperate. While in the United States Federal Witness Protection Program he took a job with a mortgage firm owned by Joseph J. Higgins, a former member of the New Jersey General Assembly, and they made additional efforts to defraud the same pension fund. The fund suffered no loss. In 1983, United States Attorney for New Jersey W. Hunt Dumont was reported by The New York Times to be pursuing a major investigation of as many as 50 individuals based on evidence that Friedland had provided. Despite his conviction, Friedland was in Federal custody and told a reporter who had spotted him at Miami International Airport that he could end up spending more than a year in assisting with Federal prosecutions.Sullivan, Joseph F. \\"THE TRIAL OF HUDSON CORRUPTION CASES\\", The New York Times, February 27, 1983.

During his time on the lam, he had been traced to Kenya, Paris, Venice, Hong Kong and Singapore and worked his way up to become the number one fugitive wanted by the United States Marshals Service. In December 1987, two years after his disappearance, he was arrested by officials in Malé, capital of Maldives, an island country in the Indian Ocean, where he had been working as a scuba dive master. While in the Maldives, Friedland did little to avoid attention, including posing for a post card in which he was in scuba gear feeding a live shark with food held in his own mouth. =Capture and conviction= He was flown back to the United States, arriving at John F. Kennedy International Airport on December 28, 1987, under the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service and taken for arraignment in Federal District court in Brooklyn.

Arthur Borinsky, the United States Marshal for New Jersey, quoted Friedland as stating that \\"he really got tired of running\\". In December 1987, United States Judge Dickinson Richards Debevoise ordered Friedland to serve a sentence of seven years in Federal prison, rejecting pleas for leniency from Friedland and claims that the U.S. Attorney's office had violated the terms of a 1982 agreement under which he became an informant in corruption investigations.Hanley, Robert. \\"Fugitive Politician Ordered to Serve Prison Term\\", The New York Times, December 30, 1987.

David Friedland, 83 F.3d 1531, United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, Decided May 17, 1996. Accessed May 22, 2009. After Friedland's attorney passed on an offer under which his client would pass on details of illegal drug activity based on information he obtained from other inmates, then-United States Attorney Samuel Alito responded on April 3, 1989, that his office would accept any information offered but would not make any promise to assist Friedland based on the use of any information Friedland might provide. Bypassing Alito's successor Michael Chertoff, Friedland made a deal with Drug Enforcement Administration special agent Anthony Longarzo, under which Friedland provided information that led to several arrests and the seizure of drugs in 1990. The information related to recovery of stinger missiles from Afghanistan as the drugs were used to purchase weapons for terrorists. In exchange, Longarzo was supposed to recommend to the court and the United States Parole Commission that Friedland's incarceration be shortened.

The club have played at the highest level of Peruvian football on thirteen occasions, from 1966 Torneo Descentralizado until 1971 Torneo Descentralizado, and from 1984 Torneo Descentralizado until 1991 Torneo Descentralizado when was relegated. =Name and spelling= Octavio Espinosa Gonzales was a pioneer aviator and journalist born in Lima in 1882, who was devoted to civil aviation. In 1920, he was the victim of a tragic accident with American airplane pilot Walter Pack in which he hit the hacienda Oquendo. Oral tradition has it that Espinosa landed in Ica on one of his flights; however, the experienced and highly regarded journalist Jose Ica Lujan, who thoroughly reviewed the archives of the newspaper La Voz de Ica, noted that there was no journalistic record of such an event, which by its nature would have been recorded in the city at the time. Whatever occurred, the residents of the street Paita apparently took that reference to christen the team. Although there are occasional spelling mistakes in the name of the club, sometimes written as \\"Octavio Espinoza\\" (with \\"z\\"), the origin of the name, described above, removes any doubt about the correct spelling.

Early European individualist anarchism was influenced by many philosophers, including Pierre Joseph Proudhon, Max Stirner and Henry David Thoreau. Proudhon was an early pioneer of anarchism as well as of the important individualist anarchist current of mutualism. Stirner became a central figure of individualist anarchism through the publication of his seminal work The Ego and Its Own which is considered to be \\"a founding text in the tradition of individualist anarchism\\". The philosophy of Max Stirner supports the individual doing exactly what he pleases, taking no notice of God, state, or moral rules. To Stirner, rights were spooks in the mind and held that society does not exist but \\"the individuals are its reality\\". Stirner supported property by force of might rather than moral right,\\"What my might reaches is my property; and let me claim as property everything I feel myself strong enough to attain, and let me extend my actual property as fas as I entitle, that is, empower myself to take…\\" From The Ego and Its Own, quoted in advocated self-assertion and foresaw union of egoists drawn together by respect for each other's self-ownership. Thoreau's emphasis on the promotion of simple living, environmental stewardship and civil disobedience were influential in European individualist anarchists. Influential European individualist anarchists include Albert Libertad, Anselme Bellegarrigue, Oscar Wilde, Émile Armand, Lev Chernyi, John Henry Mackay, Han Ryner, Adolf Brand, Miguel Gimenez Igualada, Renzo Novatore and Michel Onfray.Onfray says in an interview \\"L'individualisme anarchiste part de cette logique.

As a credo, individualist anarchism remained largely a bohemian lifestyle, most conspicuous in its demands for sexual freedom ('free love') and enamored of innovations in art, behavior, and clothing\\".\\"2.

Individualist anarchist activity spanned the full spectrum of alternatives to authoritarian society, subverting it by undermining its way of life facet by facet.\\" Thus theft, counterfeiting, swindling, and robbery became a way of life for hundreds of individualists, as it was already for countless thousands of proletarians. The wave of anarchist bombings and assassinations of the 1890s (Auguste Vaillant, Ravachol, Émile Henry, Sante Caserio) and the practice of illegalism from the mid-1880s to the start of the First World War (Clément Duval, Pini, Marius Jacob, the Bonnot gang) were twin aspects of the same proletarian offensive, but were expressed in an individualist practice, one that complemented the great collective struggles against capital.\\" and freethought.Xavier Diez. El anarquismo individualista en España (1923–1939) Virus Editorial. 2007. pg. 152  Early influences  William Godwin = William Godwin, a radical liberal and utilitarian, who was one of the first to espouse what became known as individualist anarchism William Godwin was an individualist anarchist and philosophical anarchist who was influenced by the ideas of the Age of Enlightenment,\\"Anarchism\\", Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2006 (UK version) and developed what many consider the first expression of modern anarchist thought. Godwin was, according to Peter Kropotkin, \\"the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism, even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work.\\"Peter Kropotkin, \\"Anarchism\\", Encyclopædia Britannica, 1910Godwin himself attributed the first anarchist writing to Edmund Burke's A Vindication of Natural Society. \\"Most of the above arguments may be found much more at large in Burke's Vindication of Natural Society; a treatise in which the evils of the existing political institutions are displayed with incomparable force of reasoning and lustre of eloquence…\\" – footnote, Ch. 2 Political Justice by William Godwin. Godwin advocated extreme individualism, proposing that all cooperation in labor be eliminated.\\"Godwin, William\\". (2006). In Britannica Concise Encyclopaedia. Retrieved December 7, 2006, from Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Godwin, a utilitarian, believed that not all individuals are of equal value, with some of us \\"of more worth and importance' than others depending on our utility in bringing about social good. Godwin believed that the person whose life was the most conducive to the general good should be favored, eschewing equal rights. Godwin opposed government because it infringes on the individual's right to \\"private judgement\\" to determine which actions most maximize utility, but also objected to all authority over the individual's judgement. This aspect of Godwin's philosophy, minus the utilitarianism, was developed into a more extreme form later by Stirner. Godwin even opposed individuals performing together in orchestras, writing in Political Justice that \\"everything understood by the term co-operation is in some sense an evil.\\" The only apparent exception to this opposition to cooperation is the spontaneous association that may arise when a society is threatened by violent force. One reason he opposed cooperation is he believed it to interfere with an individual's ability to be benevolent for the greater good. Godwin opposes the idea of government, but wrote that a minimal state is a present \\"necessary evil\\" that would become increasingly irrelevant and powerless by the gradual spread of knowledge. He expressly opposed democracy, fearing oppression of the individual by the majority (though he preferred democracy to dictatorship). Title page from the third edition of Political Justice by Godwin Godwin supported individual ownership of property, defining it as \\"the empire to which every man is entitled over the produce of his own industry.\\" But he also suggested that individuals give each other their surplus property when the other needed it, without involving trade (e.g. gift economy). Thus, while people have the right to private property, they should give it away as enlightened altruists. Godwin explained this approach stating, \\"[e]very man has a right to that, the exclusive possession of which being awarded to him, a greater sum of benefit or pleasure will result than could have arisen from its being otherwise appropriated.\\" Yet to Godwin, benevolence was not to be enforced but instead a matter of free individual \\"private judgement.\\" He did not advocate a community of goods or assert collective ownership as is embraced in communism, but his belief that individuals ought to share with those in need was influential on the later development of anarchist communism. Godwin's political views were diverse and do not perfectly agree with any of the ideologies that claim his influence; writers of the Socialist Standard, organ of the Socialist Party of Great Britain, consider Godwin both an individualist and a communist;\\"William Godwin, Shelly and Communism\\" by ALB, The Socialist Standard anarcho-capitalist Murray Rothbard did not regard Godwin as an individualist, referring to him as the \\"founder of communist anarchism\\";Rothbard, Murray. \\"Edmund Burke, Anarchist.\\" and historian Albert Weisbord considers him an individualist anarchist without reservation. Some writers see a conflict between Godwin's advocacy of \\"private judgement\\" and utilitarianism, as he says that ethics requires that individuals give their surplus property to each other resulting in an egalitarian society, but, at the same time, he insists that all things be left to individual choice. Many of Godwin's views changed over time, as noted by Peter Kropotkin. = Pierre-Joseph Proudhon = Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, the first self-identified anarchist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon was the first philosopher to label himself an \\"anarchist\\".\\"Anarchism\\", BBC Radio 4 program, In Our Time, Thursday December 7, 2006.

Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements, Broadview Press, 2004, p. 20 Nevertheless, he was influential among American individualists; in the 1840s and 1850s, Charles A. Dana,Dana, Charles A. Proudhon and his \\"Bank of the People\\" (1848). and William B. Greene introduced Proudhon's works to the United States. Greene adapted Proudhon's mutualism to American conditions and introduced it to Benjamin R. Tucker.Tucker, Benjamin R., \\"On Picket Duty\\", Liberty (Not the Daughter but the Mother of Order) (1881–1908); January 5, 1889; 6, 10; APS Online pg. 1 Proudhon opposed government privilege that protects capitalist, banking and land interests, and the accumulation or acquisition of property (and any form of coercion that led to it) which he believed hampers competition and concentrates wealth. Proudhon favored the right of individuals to retain the product of their labor as their own property, but believed that all other property was illegitimate. Thus, he saw private property as both essential to liberty and a road to tyranny, the former when it resulted from labor and was required for labor and the latter when it resulted in/from exploitation (profit, interest, rent, tax). He generally termed the former \\"possession\\" and the latter \\"property.\\" For large-scale industry, he supported workers associations to replace wage labor and opposed land ownership. Proudhon maintained that workers should retain the entirety of what they produce, and that monopolies on credit and land are the forces that prohibit this. He advocated an economic system he called mutualism that included possession and exchange of private property but without profit. Joseph Dejacque explicitly rejected Proudhon's philosophy, instead preferring anarchist-communism, asserting directly to Proudhon in a letter that \\"it is not the product of his or her labor that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature.\\" An individualist rather than anarchist communist, Proudhon said that \\"communism...is the very denial of society in its foundation...\\"Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph. The Philosophy of Misery: The Evolution of Capitalism. BiblioBazaar, LLC (2006). pp. 217 and famously declared that \\"property is theft!\\" in reference to his rejection of ownership rights to land being granted to a person who is not using that land. After Dejacque and others split from Proudhon, the relationship between individualists, and anarcho-communists was characterized by various degrees of antagonism and harmony. For example, individualists like Tucker at once translated and reprinted the works of collectivists like Mikhail Bakunin while rejecting the economic aspects of collectivism and communism as incompatible with anarchist ideals.  Mutualism  Mutualism is an anarchist school of thought which can be traced to the writings of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, who envisioned a society where each person might possess a means of production, either individually or collectively, with trade representing equivalent amounts of labor in the free market.\\"Introduction\\". Mutualist: Free-Market Anti-Capitalism. Retrieved 27 September 2020. Integral to the scheme was the establishment of a mutual-credit bank which would lend to producers at a minimal interest rate only high enough to cover the costs of administration.Miller, David. 1987. \\"Mutualism.\\" The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Political Thought. Blackwell Publishing. p. 11 Mutualism is based on a labor theory of value which holds that when labour or its product is sold, in exchange it ought to receive goods or services embodying \\"the amount of labor necessary to produce an article of exactly similar and equal utility\\".Tandy, Francis D., 1896, Voluntary Socialism, chapter 6, paragraph 15. Some mutualists believe that if the state did not intervene, individuals would receive no more income than that in proportion to the amount of labor they exert as a result of increased competition in the marketplace.Tandy, Francis D., 1896, Voluntary Socialism, chapter 6, paragraphs 9, 10 & 22.Carson, Kevin, 2004, Studies in Mutualist Political Economy, chapter 2 (after Meek & Oppenheimer). Mutualists oppose the idea of individuals receiving an income through loans, investments and rent as they believe these individuals are not labouring. Some of them argue that if state intervention ceased, these types of incomes would disappear due to increased competition in capital.Tandy, Francis D., 1896, Voluntary Socialism, chapter 6, paragraph 19.Carson, Kevin, 2004, Studies in Mutualist Political Economy, chapter 2 (after Ricardo, Dobb & Oppenheimer). Although Proudhon opposed this type of income, he expressed that he \\"never meant to [...] forbid or suppress, by sovereign decree, ground rent and interest on capital. I believe that all these forms of human activity should remain free and optional for all\\".Solution of the Social Problem, 1848–49. What Is Property?

Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements, Broadview Press, 2004, pp. 110, 112 for \\"we need not hesitate, for we have no choice [...] it is necessary to form an ASSOCIATION among workers [...] because without that, they would remain related as subordinates and superiors, and there would ensue two [...] castes of masters and wage-workers, which is repugnant to a free and democratic society\\" and so \\"it becomes necessary for the workers to form themselves into democratic societies, with equal conditions for all members, on pain of a relapse into feudalism\\".General Idea of the Revolution, Pluto Press, pp. 215–16, 277 As for capital goods (man-made and non-land, means of production), mutualist opinion differs on whether these should be common property and commonly managed public assets or private property in the form of worker cooperatives, for as long as they ensure the worker's right to the full product of their labor, mutualists support markets and property in the product of labor, differentiating between capitalist private property (productive property) and personal property (private property).Crowder, George (1991). Classical Anarchism: The Political Thought of Godwin, Proudhon, Bakunin, and Kropotkin. Oxford: Clarendon Press. pp. 85–86. . \\"The ownership [anarchists oppose] is basically that which is unearned [...] including such things as interest on loans and income from rent. This is contrasted with ownership rights in those goods either produced by the work of the owner or necessary for that work, for example his dwelling- house, land and tools. Proudhon initially refers to legitimate rights of ownership of these goods as 'possession,' and although in his latter work he calls this 'property,' the conceptual distinction remains the same.\\"Hargreaves, David H. (2019). Beyond Schooling: An Anarchist Challenge. London: Routledge. pp. 90–91. . \\"Ironically, Proudhon did not mean literally what he said. His boldness of expression was intended for emphasis, and by 'property' he wished to be understood what he later called 'the sum of its abuses'. He was denouncing the property of the man who uses it to exploit the labour of others without any effort on his own part, property distinguished by interest and rent, by the impositions of the non-producer on the producer. Towards property regarded as 'possession' the right of a man to control his dwelling and the land and tools he needs to live, Proudhon had no hostility; indeed, he regarded it as the cornerstone of liberty, and his main criticism of the communists was that they wished to destroy it.\\" Following Proudhon, mutualists are libertarian socialists who consider themselves to part of the market socialist tradition and the socialist movement. However, some contemporary mutualists outside the classical anarchist tradition abandoned the labor theory of value and prefer to avoid the term socialist due to its association with state socialism throughout the 20th century. Nonetheless, those contemporary mutualists \\"still retain some cultural attitudes, for the most part, that set them off from the libertarian right. Most of them view mutualism as an alternative to capitalism, and believe that capitalism as it exists is a statist system with exploitative features\\".\\"A Mutualist FAQ: A.4. Are Mutualists Socialists?\\". Mutualist: Free-Market Anti-Capitalism. . Retrieved 27 September 2020. Mutualists have distinguished themselves from state socialism and do not advocate state ownership over the means of production. Benjamin Tucker said of Proudhon that \\"though opposed to socializing the ownership of capital, Proudhon aimed nevertheless to socialize its effects by making its use beneficial to all instead of a means of impoverishing the many to enrich the few [...] by subjecting capital to the natural law of competition, thus bringing the price of its own use down to cost\\".Tucker, Benjamin (1926) [1890].

Retrieved 27 September 2020 – via Flag.Blackened.Net. = Max Stirner = Max Stirner in a portrait by Friedrich Engels Johann Kaspar Schmidt, better known as Max Stirner (the nom de plume he adopted from a schoolyard nickname he had acquired as a child because of his high brow, Stirn in German), was a German philosopher who ranks as one of the literary fathers of nihilism, existentialism, post-modernism and anarchism, especially of individualist anarchism. Stirner's main work is The Ego and Its Own, also known as The Ego and His Own (Der Einzige und sein Eigentum in German, which translates literally as The Only One and his Property). This work was first published in 1844 in Leipzig, and has since appeared in numerous editions and translations. Authors, philosophers and artists have cited, quoted or otherwise referred to Stirner. They include Albert Camus in The Rebel (the section on Stirner is omitted from the majority of English editions including Penguin's), Benjamin Tucker, Dora Marsden, Emma Goldman,See Goldman, Anarchism and Other Essays, p. 50. Georg Brandes, Rudolf Steiner, John Cowper Powys, Émile Armand, Han Ryner, Renzo Novatore, Karl Marx, Robert Anton Wilson, Italian individualist anarchist Frank Brand, Russian-American philosopher Ayn Rand,See Letters of Ayn Rand, pg. 176, Dutton, 1995. Bob Black, antiartist Marcel Duchamp, several writers of the Situationist International, and Max Ernst, who titled a 1925 painting L'unique et sa propriété. The Ego and Its Own has seen periodic revivals of popular, political and academic interest, based around widely divergent translations and interpretations—emphasizing psychological or political views. Today, many ideas associated with post-left anarchy's criticism of ideology and uncompromising individualism are clearly related to Stirner's. Individualist feminism claims him as a pioneer, since his objection to any absolute concept also counts gender roles as \\"spooks\\". His ideas were also adopted by post-anarchism, with Saul Newman largely agreeing with many of Stirner's criticisms of classical anarchism, including his rejection of revolution and essentialism.  Egoism  Stirner's philosophy, sometimes called \\"egoism\\", is the most extreme form of IA. He was a Hegelian philosopher whose \\"name appears with familiar regularity in historically-orientated surveys of anarchist thought as one of the earliest and best-known exponents of IA.\\" Stirner does not recommend that the individual try to eliminate the state but simply exploit it to further the individual's interests. Moggach, Douglas. The New Hegelians. Cambridge University Press, 2006 p. 190 He says that the egoist rejects pursuit of devotion to \\"a great idea, a good cause, a doctrine, a system, a lofty calling\\", saying that the egoist has no political calling but rather \\"lives themselves out\\" without regard to \\"how well or ill humanity may fare thereby.\\"Moggach, Douglas. The New Hegelians. Cambridge University Press, 2006 p. 183 Stirner held that the only limitation on the rights of the individual is his power to obtain what he desires.The Encyclopedia Americana: A Library of Universal Knowledge. Encyclopedia Corporation. p. 176 He proposes that most commonly accepted social institutions—including the notion of State, property as a right, natural rights in general, and the very notion of society—were mere spooks in the mind. Stirner wanted to \\"abolish not only the state but also society as an institution responsible for its members.\\"Heider, Ulrike. Anarchism: Left, Right and Green, San Francisco: City Lights Books, 1994, pp. 95–96 He advocated self-assertion and foresaw \\"associations of egoists\\" where respect for ruthlessness drew people together. Even murder is permissible \\"if it is right for me.\\"Moggach, Douglas. The New Hegelians. Cambridge University Press, 2006 p. 191 Original edition of The Ego and Its Own in German Stirner claimed that property comes about through might: \\"Whoever knows how to take, to defend, the thing, to him belongs property.\\" \\"What I have in my power, that is my own. So long as I assert myself as holder, I am the proprietor of the thing.\\" \\"I do not step shyly back from your property, but look upon it always as my property, in which I respect nothing. Pray do the like with what you call my property!\\".Stirner, Max. The Ego and Its Own, p. 248 His concept of \\"egoistic property\\" not only rejects moral restraint on how one obtains and uses things, but includes other people as well.Moggach, Douglas. The New Hegelians. Cambridge University Press, 2006 p. 194 His embrace of egoism is in stark contrast to Godwin's altruism. Stirner was opposed to communism, seeing it as a form of authority over the individual. In Russia, IA inspired by Stirner combined with an appreciation for Friedrich Nietzsche to attract a small following of bohemian artists and intellectuals such as Lev Chernyi, as well as a few lone wolves who found self-expression in crime and violence.Levy, Carl. \\"Anarchism\\".

Forms of libertarian communism such as situationism are influenced by Stirner.see, for example, Christopher Gray, Leaving the Twentieth Century, p. 88.

Development by country  France = L'Anarchie, January 3, 1907, French individualist anarchist publication edited by Albert Libertad Proudhon and Stirner stimulated a strong response in France.

French individualist anarchists espoused diverse positions. For example, Émile Armand rejected violence and embraced mutualism while advocating free love. Albert Libertad and Zo d'Axa championed violent propaganda by the deed while adhering to communitarianism or anarcho-communism\\"Libertad était un révolté, qui luttait non-en dehors (tel les communautaires/colonies) ni à côté de la société (les éducationnistes), mais en son sein. Il sera énoncé comme une figure de l'anarchisme individualiste, néanmoins, il ne se revendiquera jamais ainsi, même si il ne rejetait pas l'individualisme, et que Libertad se revendiquait du communisme ; plus tard, Mauricius, qui était un des éditeurs du journal \\"l'Anarchie\\" dira \\"Nous ne nous faisions pas d'illusions, nous savions bien que cette libération totale de l'individu dans la société capitaliste était impossible et que la réalisation de sa personnalité ne pourrait se faire que dans une société raisonnable, dont le communisme libertaire nous semblait être la meilleure expression.\\".

Han Ryner on the other side conciled anarchism with stoicism. Nevertheless, French individualist circles displayed a strong sense of personal libertarianism and experimentation. Anarchist naturism and free love concepts influenced individualist anarchists circles in France and Spain and expanded to the rest of anarchism. Zo d'Axa, founder of French individualist anarchist magazine L'EnDehors Henri Zisly, Emile Gravelle and Georges Butaud promoted anarchist naturism. Butaud was an individualist \\"partisan of the milieux libres, publishing \\"Flambeau\\" (\\"an enemy of authority\\") in 1901 in Vienna. He focused on creating and participating in anarchist colonies.\\"1926 – France: Georges Butaud (1868–1926) dies, in Ermont.\\" \\"In this sense, the theoretical positions and the vital experiences of french individualism are deeply iconoclastic and scandalous, even within libertarian circles. The call of nudist naturism, the strong defense of birth control methods, the idea of \\"unions of egoists\\" with the sole justification of sexual practices, that will try to put in practice, not without difficulties, will establish a way of thought and action, and will result in sympathy within some, and a strong rejection within others.\\"\\"La insumisión voluntaria.

Along with feverish activity against the social order, Libertad was usually also organizing feasts, dances and country excursions, in consequence of his vision of anarchism as the \\"joy of living\\" and not as militant sacrifice and death instinct, seeking to reconcile the requirements of the individual (in his need for autonomy) with the need to destroy authoritarian society. In fact, Libertad overcame the false dichotomy between individual revolt and social revolution, stressing that the first is simply a moment of the second, certainly not its negation. Revolt can only be born from the specific tension of the individual, which, in expanding itself, can only lead to a project of social liberation. For Libertad, anarchism doesn't consist in living separated from any social context in some cold ivory tower or on some happy communitarian isle, nor in living in submission to social roles, putting off the moment when one puts one's ideas into practice to the bitter end, but in living as anarchists here and now, without any concessions, in the only way possible: by rebelling. And this is why, in this perspective, individual revolt and social revolution no longer exclude each other, but rather complement each other.\\"  Émile Armand  Émile Armand Émile Armand was an influential French individualist anarchist, free love, polyamory, pacifist and antimilitarist propagandist and activist. He wrote for such anarchist magazines as L'Anarchie and EnDehors. His thought was mainly influenced by such thinkers as Stirner, Benjamin Tucker, and American Transcendentalism. Outside France he was an important influence in Spanish anarchist movements, above all in the individualist publications Iniciales, Al Margen and Nosotros. He defended the Ido constructed language over Esperanto with the help of José Elizalde. Armand contrasted his IA with social anarchist currents, rejecting revolution. He argued that waiting for revolution meant delaying the enjoyment of liberty until the masses gained awareness and will. Instead he advocated living under one's own conditions in the present time, revolting against social conditioning in daily life and living with those with an affinity to oneself in accord to the values and desire they share.\\"Anarchist Individualism as a Life and Activity\\" by Emile Armand He says the individualist is a \\"presentist\\" and \\"he could not, without bad reasoning and illogic, think of sacrificing his being, or his having, to the coming of a state of things he will not immediately enjoy\\".\\"The future society\\" by Emile Armand He applies this rule to friendship, love, sexual encounters and economic transactions. He adheres to an ethics of reciprocity and advocated propagandizing one's values to enable association with others to improve the chances of self-realization. Armand advocated free love, naturism and polyamory in what he termed la camaraderie amoureuse. Émile Armand and la camaraderie amourouse. Revolutionary sexualism and the struggle against jealousy.\\" by Francis Rousin He wrote many propagandist articles on this subject advocating not only a vague free love but also multiple partners, which he called \\"plural love.\\" \\"'The camaraderie amoureuse thesis,' he explained, 'entails a free contract of association (that may be annulled without notice, following prior agreement) reached between anarchist individualists of different genders, adhering to the necessary standards of sexual hygiene, with a view toward protecting the other parties to the contract from certain risks of the amorous experience, such as rejection, rupture, exclusivism, possessiveness, unicity, coquetry, whims, indifference, flirtatiousness, disregard for others, and prostitution.'\\".  Han Ryner  Han Ryner Han Ryner was a French individualist anarchist philosopher and activist and a novelist. He wrote for publications such as L'Art social, L'Humanité nouvelle, L'Ennemi du Peuple, L'Idée Libre de Lorulot; and L'En dehors and L'Unique. His thought is mainly influenced by stoicism and epicureanism. He defines individualism as \\"the moral doctrine which, relying on no dogma, no tradition, no external determination, appeals only to the individual conscience.\\".\\"Mini-Manual of Individualism\\" by Han Ryner He distinguishes \\"conquering and aggressive egoists who proclaim themselves to be individualists\\" from what he called \\"harmonic individualists\\" who respected others. He admired Epicurus' temperance and that \\"he showed that very little was needed to satisfy hunger and thirst, to defend oneself against heat and the cold. And he liberated himself from all other needs, that is, almost all the desires and all the fears that enslave men.\\". He celebrated how Jesus \\"lived free and a wanderer, foreign to any social ties. He was the enemy of priests, external cults and, in general, all organizations.\\"  Postwar and contemporary times  French individualist anarchists grouped behind Émile Armand, published L'Unique after World War II.

Renzo Novatore  Renzo Novatore Renzo Novatore was influenced by Max Stirner, Friedrich Nietzsche, Georges Palante, Oscar Wilde, Henrik Ibsen, Arthur Schopenhauer and Charles Baudelaire. He collaborated in numerous anarchist journals and participated in futurism avant-garde currents. He proclaimed \\"revolution is the fire of our will and a need of our solitary minds; it is an obligation of the libertarian aristocracy. To create new ethical values. To create new aesthetic values. To communalize material wealth. To individualize spiritual wealth. Because we violent celebralists and passional sentimentalists at the same time-understand and know that revolution is a necessity of the silent sorrow that suffers at the bottom and a need of the free spirits who suffer in the heights.\\" He summarizes the three options in life as \\"The stream of slavery, the stream of tyranny, the stream of freedom! With revolution, the last of these streams needs to burst upon the other two and overwhelm them. It needs to create spiritual beauty, teach the poor the shame of their poverty, and the rich the shame of their wealth.\\" These views justified his practice of illegalism and later active resistance to fascism. Novatore collaborated in the individualist anarchist journal Iconoclasta! alongside the young Stirnerist illegalist Bruno FilippiThe rebel's dark laughter: the writings of Bruno Filippi Also a poet, Novatore belonged to the leftist section of the avant-garde movement of futurism, alongside others individualist anarchists such as Dante Carnesecchi, Leda Rafanelli, Auro d'Arcola, and Giovanni Governato.

At the turn of the 20th century people such as Dorado Montero, Ricardo Mella, Federico Urales, Mariano Gallardo and J. Elizalde translated French and American individualists. Important in this respect were also magazines such as La Idea Libre, La Revista Blanca, Etica, Iniciales, Al margen, Estudios and Nosotros. The most influential thinkers there were Stirner, Émile Armand and Han Ryner. Just as in France, Esperanto, anationalism, anarcho-naturism and free love were present. Later Armand and Ryner started publishing in the Spanish individualist press. Armand's concept of amorous camaraderie had an important role in motivating polyamory as realization of the individual.

L'anarquisme Individualista a Espanya 1923–1938 The individualist anarchism of Urales was influenced by Auguste Comte and Charles Darwin. He saw science and reason as a defense against blind servitude to authority. He was critical of influential individualist thinkers such as Nietzsche and Stirner for promoting an asocial egoist individualism and instead promoted an individualism with solidarity as a way to guarantee social equality and harmony. In the subject of organization, he was highly critical of anarcho-syndicalism as he saw it plagued by too much bureaucracy and thought that it tended towards reformism. He favored small groups based on ideological alignment. He supported the establishment of the Iberian Anarchist Federation in 1927 and participated in it.

First Etica and then Iniciales, which began in 1929, were the publications of the group, which lasted until the Spanish Civil War. We must be aware that the naturist ideas expressed in them matched the desires that the libertarian youth had of breaking up with the conventions of the bourgeoisie of the time. That is what a young worker explained in a letter to 'Iniciales' He writes it under the odd pseudonym of 'silvestre del campo', (wild man in the country). \\"I find great pleasure in being naked in the woods, bathed in light and air, two natural elements we cannot do without.

Another influence was the thought of German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche.Constantin Parvulescu. \\"Der Einzige\\" and the making of the radical Left in the early post-World War I Germany.

Walter De Gruyter Inc. 1990 = Russia = Individualist anarchism was one of the three categories of anarchism in Russia, along with the more prominent anarchist communism and anarcho- syndicalism. The ranks of the Russian individualist anarchists were predominantly drawn from the intelligentsia and the working class. For anarchist historian Paul Avrich \\"The two leading exponents of individualist anarchism, both based in Moscow, were Aleksei Alekseevich Borovoi and Lev Chernyi (Pavel Dmitrievich Turchaninov). From Nietzsche, they inherited the desire for a complete overturn of all values accepted by bourgeois societypolitical, moral, and cultural. Furthermore, strongly influenced by Max Stirner and Benjamin Tucker, the German and American theorists of individualist anarchism, they demanded the total liberation of the human personality from the fetters of organized society.\\" Some Russian individualists anarchists \\"found the ultimate expression of their social alienation in violence and crime, others attached themselves to avant-garde literary and artistic circles, but the majority remained \\"philosophical\\" anarchists who conducted animated parlor discussions and elaborated their individualist theories in ponderous journals and books.\\"  Lev Chernyi  Lev Chernyi was an important individualist anarchist involved in resistance against the rise to power of the Bolchevik Party. He adhered mainly to Stirner and the ideas of Benjamin Tucker. In 1907, he published a book entitled Associational Anarchism, in which he advocated the \\"free association of independent individuals.\\". On his return from Siberia in 1917 he enjoyed great popularity among Moscow workers as a lecturer. Chernyi was also Secretary of the Moscow Federation of Anarchist Groups, which was formed in March 1917. He was an advocate \\"for the seizure of private homes\\", which was an activity seen by the anarchists after the October revolution as direct expropriation on the bourgoise. He died after being accused of participation in an episode in which this group bombed the headquarters of the Moscow Committee of the Communist Party. Although most likely not being really involved in the bombing, he might have died of torture. Chernyi advocated a Nietzschean overthrow of the values of bourgeois Russian society, and rejected the voluntary communes of anarcho- communist Peter Kropotkin as a threat to the freedom of the individual. Scholars including Avrich and Allan Antliff have interpreted this vision of society to have been greatly influenced by the individualist anarchists Max Stirner, and Benjamin Tucker. Subsequent to the book's publication, Chernyi was imprisoned in Siberia under the Russian Czarist regime for his revolutionary activities.

He wrote among other theoretical works, Anarkhizm in 1918 just after the October revolution and Anarchism and Law. For him \\"the chief importance is given not to Anarchism as the aim but to Anarchy as the continuous quest for the aim\\".Alexei Borovoi (from individualism to the Platform)\\" by Anatoly Dubovik He manifests there that \\"No social ideal, from the point of view of anarchism, could be referred to as absolute in a sense that supposes it's the crown of human wisdom, the end of social and ethical quest of man.\\" = United Kingdom and Ireland = The English Enlightenment political theorist William Godwin was an important influence early influence as mentioned before. Oscar Wilde, famous anarchist Irish writer of the decadent movement and famous dandy In the late 19th century individualist anarchists such as Wordsworth Donisthorpe, Joseph Hiam Levy, Joseph Greevz Fisher, John Badcock, Jr., Albert Tarn, and Henry Seymour\\"The English Individualists As They Appear In Liberty\\" by Carl Watner were close to Tucker's magazine Liberty. In the mid-1880s Seymour published a journal called The Anarchist. and also later took a special interest in free love as he participated in the journal The Adult: A Journal for the Advancement of Freedom in Sexual Relationships. \\"The Serpent, issued from London...the most prominent English-language egoist journal, was published from 1898 to 1900 with the subtitle 'A Journal of Egoistic Philosophy and Sociology'\\".McElroy, Wendy. \\"Benjamin Tucker and Liberty: A Bibliographical Essay by Wendy McElroy\\" Philosopher and writer Herbert Read wrote on GodwinGodwinStirner and works such as To Hell With Culture, The Paradox of AnarchismThe Paradox of Anarchism Philosophy of Anarchism,Philosophy of Anarchism\\" Anarchy & Order; Poetry & Anarchism and My Anarchism. Henry Meulen was notable for his support of free banking. Sidney Parker is a British egoist who wrote articles and edited anarchist journals from 1963 to 1993 such as Minus One, Egoist, and Ego.\\"Sid Parker\\" by nonserviam.com Donald Rooum is an English anarchist cartoonist and writer with a long association with Freedom Press. Rooum stated that for his thought \\"The most influential source is Max Stirner. I am happy to be called a Stirnerite anarchist, provided 'Stirnerite' means one who agrees with Stirner's general drift, not one who agrees with Stirner's every word.\\"Donald Rooum: Anarchism and Selfishness. In: The Raven. Anarchist Quarterly (London), vol. 1, n. 3 (nov. 1987), pp. 251–259 (here 259) An Anarchist FAQ reports that \\"From meeting anarchists in Glasgow during the Second World War, long-time anarchist activist and artist Donald Rooum likewise combined Stirner and anarcho-communism.\\" \\"G.6. What are the ideas of Max Stirner\\" in An Anarchist FAQ In the hybrid of post-structuralism and anarchism called post-anarchism the British Saul Newman has written a lot on Stirner and his similarities to post-structuralism. He writes: > Max Stirner's impact on contemporary political theory is often neglected. > However in Stirner's political thinking there can be found a surprising > convergence with poststructuralist theory, particularly with regard to the > function of power. Andrew Koch, for instance, sees Stirner as a thinker who > transcends the Hegelian tradition he is usually placed in, arguing that his > work is a precursor poststructuralist ideas about the foundations of > knowledge and truth. \\"War on the State: Stirner and Deleuze's Anarchism\\" by > Saul Newman Newman has published several essays on Stirner. \\"War on the State: Stirner and Deleuze's Anarchism\\" and \\"Empiricism, pluralism, and politics in Deleuze and Stirner\\"\\"Empiricism, pluralism, and politics in Deleuze and Stirner\\" by Saul Newman discusses what he sees are similarities between Stirner's thought and that of Gilles Deleuze. In \\"Spectres of Stirner: a Contemporary Critique of Ideology\\" he discusses the conception of ideology in Stirner.\\"Spectres of Stirner: a Contemporary Critique of Ideology\\" In \\"Stirner and Foucault: Toward a Post-Kantian Freedom\\" he identifies similarities between Stirner and Michel Foucault.\\"Stirner and Foucault: Toward a Post-Kantian Freedom Also he wrote \\"Politics of the ego: Stirner's critique of liberalism\\".\\"Politics of the ego: Stirner's critique of liberalism\\"  Oscar Wilde  Oscar Wilde, the Irish anarchist writer of the decadent movement, influenced individualist anarchists such as Renzo Novatore\\"We must kill the christian philosophy in the most radical sense of the word. How much mostly goes sneaking inside the democratic civilization (this most cynically ferocious form of christian depravity) and it goes more towards the categorical negation of human Individuality. \\"Democracy! By now we have comprised it that it means all that says Oscar Wilde Democracy is the people who govern the people with blows of the club for love of the people\\".\\" \\"Towards the Hurricane\\" by Renzo Novatore and gained the admiration of Benjamin Tucker.\\"When Oscar Wilde's plea for penal reform, The Ballad of Reading Gaol, was widely criticized, Tucker enthusiastically endorsed the poem, urging all of his subscribers to read it. Tucker, in fact, published an American edition. From its early championing of Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass to a series of short stories by Francis du Bosque in its last issues, Liberty was a vehicle of controversial, avant-garde literature.\\"\\"Benjamin Tucker, Individualism, & Liberty: Not the Daughter but the Mother of Order\\" by Wendy McElroy In his important essay The Soul of Man under Socialism from 1891 he defended socialism as the way to guarantee individualism and so he saw that \\"With the abolition of private property, then, we shall have true, beautiful, healthy Individualism. Nobody will waste his life in accumulating things, and the symbols for things. One will live. To live is the rarest thing in the world. Most people exist, that is all.\\"The soul of man under Socialism by Oscar Wilde For anarchist historian George Woodcock \\"Wilde's aim in The Soul of Man under Socialism is to seek the society most favorable to the artist...for Wilde art is the supreme end, containing within itself enlightenment and regeneration, to which all else in society must be subordinated...Wilde represents the anarchist as aesthete.\\"George Woodcock. Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements. 1962. (pg. 447) Woodocock finds that \\"The most ambitious contribution to literary anarchism during the 1890s was undoubtedly Oscar Wilde The Soul of Man under Socialism\\" and finds that it is influenced mainly by the thought of William Godwin.

Givens was known most for being a replacement player who crossed picket lines during spring training in 1995 while the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike was still going on. He also was notable for having endured six arm surgeries—including Tommy John surgery before making his major-league debut.  Early life and education  Givens graduated from Overland High School in Aurora, Colorado.  Minor-league career  A left-handed pitcher, Givens was drafted by the New York Mets in 1984 in the 10th round of the now-defunct January amateur draft. He began his minor-league career immediately after high school, starting out at the Rookie league level with the Kingsport Mets in the Appalachian League in 1984. Givens went 4–1 for Kingsport, making 14 appearances, striking out 51, walking 52, and posting a 6.50 earned-run average. In 1985, Givens split the season between two teams: the Short season Single-A league Little Falls Mets in the New York–Penn League and the full season A league Columbia Mets in the South Atlantic League. Givens did well, going 3–4 with a 2.93 earned-run average in 11 appearances with Little Falls, and going 1–2 with a 2.95 earned-run average in three appearances with Columbia. The following year, Givens pitched for the Mets for the entire season, posting an 8–7 record with a 3.77 earned-run average in 27 games. In 1987, Givens actually briefly rose to the Triple-A International League level, pitching for one game with the Tidewater Tides (and posting a 0–1 mark with a 24.55 earned-run average from that one game; his outing lasted just three and two-thirds innings) but spending almost the entire season at the \\"High-A\\" level with the Lynchburg Hillcats. In his time with Lynchburg, Givens went 6–8 with a 4.65 earned-run average in 21 games. In 1988, Givens spent the entire season with the Jackson Mets in the Class AA Texas League, going 6–14 with a 3.78 earned-run average in 26 games. During the season, however, Givens' elbow popped, requiring a surgery to move his ulnar nerve and taking five miles an hour off his fastball. The following year, Givens pitched largely for the Jackson Mets again, going 3–5 with a 3.39 earned-run average in 13 games. He also pitched for one game in 1989 with the St. Lucie Mets in the High-A Florida State League, posting an 0–1 mark with no earned-run average in a five-inning stint. In 1990, Givens returned to Tidewater, posting a 4–6 mark with a 4.12 earned-run average in 15 games. Partway through the season, on June 19, 1990, Givens was traded to the Seattle Mariners' Class AAA Calgary Cannons team in exchange for Mario Díaz, after Givens had arm trouble. Givens wound up going 0–1 with a 12.71 earned-run average in two games with Calgary, with his elbow blowing out in his second start at Calgary. The Mariners alleged that the Mets knowingly had peddled damaged goods, but the trade held out. Givens underwent a second arm surgery that revealed a stress fracture of the ulna bone. The following year, Givens suffered more injury trouble. He threw in one game with San Bernardino in the California League, going 1–0 with a 1.80 earned-run average. He then pitched in just three games with Calgary, going 1–0 with a 4.91 earned-run average, before blowing out a ligament. This required a third surgery—this time Tommy John surgery—in August 1991. In early 1992, Givens developed a tender spot on the outside of his elbow, opposite of the surgery, requiring arthroscopy. While still rehabbing, Givens was released by the Mariners on June 2, 1992. On August 6, 1992, he was signed by the Kansas City Royals organization. He pitched in seven games for the Memphis Chicks, who at that time were the Royals' Class AA minor-league club in the Southern League. Givens posted no record and a 3.24 earned-run average, and wound up needing another arthroscopy to remove four large chips. In 1993, Givens again pitched for Memphis, going 1–3 in 14 games with a 4.58 earned-run average. He also threw in four games for the Royals' team in the Gulf Coast League, going 0–1 with a 3.38 earned-run average. On October 15, 1993, Givens filed for free agency. On December 8, 1993, Givens was signed as a free agent by the Chicago White Sox. Givens spent the entire 1994 season with the White Sox's Birmingham Barons team in the Southern League, playing alongside basketball great Michael Jordan.They were good friends on the team. While at Birmingham, Givens went 4–7 with a 3.68 earned-run average in 36 games. On October 31, 1994, Givens was signed as a free agent by the Milwaukee Brewers.  Replacement baseball  In early 1995, the Brewers asked Givens to be a replacement player. Although he did not originally say yes, he wound up doing so to help pay for a mortgage debt. \\"I needed money and couldn't get it anywhere else\\", he told the Sporting News in 1995. \\"That was it, basically.\\" After the 234-day players strike ended in before the 1995 baseball season ever officially began, Givens was sent to the Brewers' Class AAA New Orleans Zephyrs ballclub, where he worked with pitching coach and former major-league relief pitcher Bill Campbell, who taught Givens a slider and helped him to improve his changeup.  Major-league debut and career  After pitching well with New Orleans, where he posted a 7–4 record and a 2.55 earned-run average in 16 games, Givens was promoted to the Brewers. As had been the case with his teammate Ron Rightnowar, there was some bitterness toward Givens by the major- leaguers because of his role as a replacement player. \\"I've spent 11½ years in the minor leagues, I have a mortgage and two kids to feed\\", he told the Sporting News in 1995. \\"I had to pay my bills, and I couldn't see quitting not after what I've been through.\\" However, Givens also said given the chance to do it again, he would not have been a replacement player. \\"Now that I'm here and I see how everything works, I regret what I did\\", Givens said in July 1995. \\"I was really undecided and didn't want to do it, then I said I would. One thing about this team, there's a bunch of really good guys here. Maybe they're not all going to be our best friends off the field, but when we're on the field they're going to support us like we support them.\\" In a different interview, Givens went one step further, dismissing the talent level of some of his fellow replacement players. \\"At the time, it's what I had to do\\", he told the Seattle Times in July 1995. \\"I told everyone on the team that. Of course, I regretted the decision. But I had to take care of my family. Those games were a joke. The talent level was horrible. To put myself in the same shoes with guys off the street made me sick. It wasn't really baseball.\\" At age 29, Givens made his big-league debut on June 24, 1995, pitching well in a loss. In his second game, Givens was shelled. \\"I would have sent him back to the minor leagues if I had somebody else to replace him with\\", the Brewers' manager, Phil Garner, told the Sporting News. \\"His problem was he wasn't throwing his breaking ball for strikes. We got him to be more aggressive. He responded. I changed my opinion on him.\\" Givens earned his first major league win on July 16, 1995. \\"There are a lot of guys who make it to the big leagues despite injuries or a lot of time served in the minors\\", Givens said shortly after his first big-league win. \\"It just so happens persistence paid off for me. I'm just very fortunate, with all my operations, I can still throw the ball the way I can.\\" Givens finished his rookie big-league season with a 7–5 record and a 3.95 earned-run average in 19 games. Givens pitched for five more seasons in the majors—in 1996, when he went 3-1 with a 2.86 earned-run average in four games. He had begun the season on a 30-day rehabilitation assignment with New Orleans after injuring his back in his final throwing session at home in Aurora, Colorado the day before he left for 1996 spring training. After his 30-day rehab assignment, Givens unexpectedly ended up staying longer in AAA instead of being promoted to the major leagues. \\"I was chapped at the time\\", Givens said of his frustration with not being called up sooner in 1996. \\"I didn't pitch well the first few games, then I finally got my head on straight.\\" Givens was called up in June and was hit hard in four starts. While at New Orleans in 1996, however, Givens pitched well, going 10–9 with a 3.02 earned-run average. He filed for free agency on October 15, 1996, after he and the Brewers decided to part ways by mutual agreement.  After major-league baseball  In 1997, Givens signed with the Saitama Seibu Lions in Japan. \\"If you think you're going to be stuck in AAA, you can go make some money in Japan\\", Givens said in 2005. \\"It can be pretty lucrative if you do well.\\" Givens ended the 1997 season with a 6-4 record and a 3.10 earned-run average. In 1998, Givens returned to North America, pitching for the Shreveport Captains in the Double-A Texas League.  Personal  While playing in the minors, Givens operated an off-season carpet cleaning business. Givens has three children: a son, Bryce; and a daughter, Bailee. Bryce Givens plays football for the University of Colorado at Boulder. Givens third child: a son, Ryan, a junior college prospect plays baseball for Illinois Central College (JUCO) in Peoria, Il. Givens' love in life is his family and the sport of baseball. He still coaches baseball and is the coach of a team who won the state championship.

The club was founded in 1919 and play in the Liga 1 tournament. HistoryFounding= The club was founded on June 5, 1919 as Club Miguel Grau by Guillermo Herrera on Calle Tacna in Piura; next to the home where Peruvian war hero Miguel Grau Seminario was born. The club was one of the founders of the first provincial league in the region, Liga Provincial de Fútbol de Piura in 1922 in which it played until 1965. One of its most important achievements was to contribute nine players to the gold-medal Peru national football team that competed at the 1961 Bolivarian Games football tournament. =Early First Division Spells= In 1966, the Peruvian Football Federation decided to decentralize the national tournament by inviting and allowing teams from outside Lima and Callao to play in the tournament. The four invited teams were Melgar, Alfonso Ugarte de Chiclín, Octavio Espinosa, and Atlético Grau. The club's debut was against Alianza Lima who it defeated by 1–0. That year's coach was Ladislao Padosky. Out of the four invitees only Atlético Grau was saved from relegation that year. The team would remain in the highest flight of Peruvian football until 1970. Atlético Grau was relegated to the Copa Perú that year which it would win in 1972 after defeating Deportivo Carsa, Cienciano, León de Huánuco, Deportivo Junín, and Cultural Juanjuí in La Finalísima, or Final Group Stage, and thus ascend to the Torneo Descentralizado once more alongside León de Huánuco. The 1972 squad was coached by Guillermo Quineche Gil and included Rolando Jiménez, Jorge Albán, Julio Miranda, Julio Ceballos, Manuel Mora, Javier Márquez, Manuel \\"Meleque\\" Suárez, Toribio Peña del Rosario, Marcos Murguía, José \\"Quimbo\\" Córdova and Reynaldo Rojas. This was Atlético Grau's only national title until the 2019 Copa Bicentenario. The team would remain in the first division for four years completing descent mid-table performances by finishing 7th in 1972, 11th in 1973, 15th in 1974, before being relegated in 1975 after finishing last in 18th place with only 22 points. Atlético Grau reached the Final Group Stage a second time in 1982 where it finished 2nd behind its fellow Piura Region team Atlético Torino by a goal difference of 3. Atlético Grau returned for its third and longest first division spell in 1986 by invitation during the Regional Leagues era of Peruvian football that saw up to 40 teams compete in the highest division at its peak. The teams were divided into regional tournaments where the highest placed teams would qualify to the national stage which was played by 16 teams. The only two memorable campaigns would be its first in 1986 where the club reached the main national tournament and finished third in its group as well as the final campaign in 1991 where it ended up being relegated to the 1992 Torneo Zonal. =21st Century Copa Perú Campaigns= Since then, Grau reached the National Stage of the Copa Perú multiple times during the 21st century. It reached the semi-finals, and quarter-finals in 2000 and 2001 respectively. It would reach the finals in 2002 for the first time during the bracket tournament format against Atlético Universidad from Arequipa with whom it tied 1–1 at home and lost 2–4 away. It would also reach the Round of 16 twice in 2010 and 2011 without being able to advance any further. In the 2011 Torneo Intermedio, the club was eliminated by Universidad César Vallejo in the Round of 16. In 2004, Atlético Grau fused with 2000 Copa Perú champion Estudiantes de Medicina from Ica due to that club's financial instability. During the merge the club was known as Grau- Estudiantes and played with the colors of Atlético Grau. The new team was not recognize as valid by a majority of the club's voting members who fielded an alternative Atlético Grau team in the Copa Perú that same year. The merge only lasted for the first half of the 2004 Torneo Descentralizado season as the Peruvian Football Federation did not recognize the merge as legal. Curiously, Estudiantes de Medicina kept the same kit for the last half of the tournament after the merge was over and during which it was relegated. Los Albos participated in the Liga Superior de Piura from its creation in 2009 until 2016 during which it was that league's champion four times. The Ligas Superiores were an effort by the Peruvian Football Federation to create a group of elite teams from every region of the country and thus elevate the quality of amateur football. The 2017 Copa Perú campaign would see Grau become runner-up for the third time in the club's history. The team finished first in its group with 15 points during the first stage of the Departamental Stage. It then would go on to beat regional rivals such as Sport Ingeniero, Sport Chorrillos, Atlético Torino, and Asociación Torino to become the Departamental Champion and thus qualify once more for the National Stage for the first time under its current format. Atlético Grau then finished first out of fifty teams in the country in the league table with 16 points, 19 goals scored, and only 3 goals against. It would then beat Carlos Stein in the Round of 16 by a global score of 3–2. The toughest game of the season came in the quarter-finals against Club José María Arguedas to whom it lost 0–4 in the first leg only to beat it 4–0 with a goal in the very last minutes of the game to advance to La Finalísima because of a better ranking in the League Table. Once in the Final Group Stage it beat Estudiantil CNI by 2–0. Then it would tie 0–0 against the eventual champion Escuela Municipal Binacional. Thus for the third and final match Atlético Grau saw itself forced to win by as many goals as possible as to remain first on the table with a better goal difference. It won its last game against José Carlos Mariátegui 3–2, which was not enough as Escuela Municipal Binacional defeated Estudiantil CNI 2–0 and thus won the championship by a better goal difference. In the end Grau finished second and became the Peruvian club with the most runner-up campaigns in the history of the Copa Perú as well as winning a berth in the Peruvian Segunda División. =Second Division Spell= The 2018 season was Grau's first season in the second division of Peruvian soccer where it faced another six teams from the north of the country. Club leaders seemed hesitant to participate in the competition but later confirmed the club's participation. The team finished in 8th initially missing out of the Liguilla stage of the tournament which would decide the season championship. Just before the beginning of the Liguilla, Deportivo Hualgayoc was set aside by the tournament organizers for outstanding debts to its squad. Thus, Atlético Grau was invited to participate. It faced Carlos A. Mannucci in the quarter-final drawing 1–1 at home and losing 5–2 in Trujillo. In 2019, Atlético Grau completed their best campaign to date in the Peruvian Segunda División (now called Liga 2). The club finished 4th, three points behind the champion, with an undefeated run at home. It qualified once again for the Liguilla that would decided the teams to participate in the 2019 Peruvian promotion play-offs. In the first round, Grau defeated Comerciantes Unidos by a score of 3–2 away and 0–3 at home. It then defeated the tournament's favorite Juan Aurich by 4–1 at home and 0–2 on the road for a total score of 4–3 and thus qualified to the promotion play-offs. In the play- offs they faced Deportivo Coopsol, Chavelines Juniors, and Deportivo Llacuabamba. It defeated Deportivo Coopsol by 2–0 with goals from Ronal Huaccha and Steven Aponzá. It then obtained scoreless draws against its next two rivals. Their last game was controversial as a scoreless draw would qualify both Grau and their rival Deportivo Llacuabamba which could have been avoided if both matchday games had been played simultaneously. Regardless, Atlético Grau finished first in the play-offs and was promoted to the top tier of Peruvian football for the first time in 29 years. =2019 Copa Bicentenario Championship= A new domestic cup competition was created in 2019 after the Peruvian Football Federation took control of the national domestic tournaments. All 30 professional teams from the first two divisions participated in the first edition of the Copa Bicentenario. Atlético Grau played in Group A with Sporting Cristal, Universidad César Vallejo, and Alianza Atlético. The club finished second behind Sporting Cristal with 4 points. In the round of 16 it defeated Universidad Técnica de Cajamarca in penalties by 7–6 after a 2–2 draw. In the quarterfinal it faced their former groupmate Sporting Cristal in penalties once again by 5–3 after 1–1 draw in regular time. In the semifinals it faced Deportivo Coopsol, guaranteeing the presence of at least one Liga 2 team in the final, whom it defeated by a combined score of 7–2 after two legs. In the final it faced Sport Huancayo at Estadio Miguel Grau in a scoreless draw after extra time. The championship was thus decided in penalties which Grau won by 4–3. This was Atlético Grau's first professional title and its second national title since the 1972 Copa Perú. The team also qualified for its first international tournament, the 2020 Copa Sudamericana, where it will face Uruguayan club Atlético River Plate.

Her mother had been a student of Franz Liszt, and introduced her daughter to art music. Warren's father was considered a fine amateur singer who had once considered singing professionally. Warren trained as a pianist with Kathryn Cocke through high school and took composition lessons from Gertrude Ross starting her second year in high school. She sent an early composition to the Schirmer music publishing company and received her first contract to publish with them before she graduated from high school. Between high school and college, Warren studied piano with Harold Bauer and Leopold Godowsky. After attending Mills College for a year, she moved to New York, where she studied privately with composers Frank LaForge and Clarence Dickinson, both of whom were known for their art songs. Warren supported herself as an accompanist for singers and went on tour with contralto Margaret Matzenauer. Warren composed in a predominantly neo-Romantic style.Website of Elinor Remick Warren In demand as both a pianist and a composer, she was a soloist twice with the Los Angeles Philharmonic and made several recordings as a collaborator with various singers. In the 1930s, Warren began working on larger-scale compositions including her piece The Harp Weaver, a work for women's chorus, orchestra, and baritone soloist; and the symphonic The Passing of King Arthur (later re-titled The Legend of King Arthur). In 1940, with the success of King Arthur, she stopped performing to focus on composition. She actively composed on themes of nature, especially as seen in the American West, and mysticism. Warren spent most of her composition career in Los Angeles, which was considered an unusual choice at the time, given that New York was thought to be the center of new American music. Nonetheless, her works were widely performed during her lifetime. Her composition instructors included Olga Steeb, Paolo Gallico, Frank La Forge, Clarence Dickinson, and Nadia Boulanger. During her lifetime she wrote over 200 compositions. Many of these have been recorded by artists and ensembles such as the Roger Wagner Chorale, baritone Thomas Hampson, the Oslo Philharmonic, the Royal Scottish National Orchestra and the BBC Orchestra. Warren herself recorded a number of her piano and piano-vocal works. Her manuscripts and other materials are held by the Library of Congress in the Elinor Remick Warren Collection. On June 17, 1925, she married Dr. Raymond Huntsberger in Los Angeles; they divorced four years later. In 1936 she married the film producer Z. Wayne Griffin (1907-1981), with whom she had two daughters and a son.https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0341402/ She died at her home at the age of 91.

Career  Lawrence Walter William Weaver was born and raised in Bristol. He began his career there as a sales representative at an architectural practice, selling fixtures and fittings. He then became the London representative of Lockerbie and Wilkinson, a firm of ironfounders who made cast-iron ware for the building trade, where he developed an interest in leadwork. In 1905 his articles on leadwork topics began to be published in leading journals such as Country Life, Architectural Review, The Burlington Magazine, and The Art Workers' Quarterly. Over time his articles' subject matter widened to cover all aspects of architecture. In 1910 Weaver was appointed Architectural Editor of Country Life, writing on contemporary architecture as an 'advocate of the new' and the Arts and Crafts Movement,Country Life, 1897-1997: The English Arcadia, by Sir Roy Strong, Boxtree Ltd, 1996 (page 16 and 27) and subsequently becoming a director.\\"Fifty Years of Country Life\\", by Bernard Darwin, Country Life, 1947 (page 49) He wrote a large number of articles on country houses and gardens, especially those by Edwin Lutyens, providing a strong counterpoint to his predecessor, Avray Tipping. In 1913 the magazine was described as \\"the keeper of the architectural conscience of the nation\\". From 1916 he became a civil servant during the First World War. In 1919, when he was the Commercial Secretary of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, he founded the National Institute of Agricultural Botany. Weaver's career was subsequently supported by the patronage of Lord Arthur Lee, his Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries (1919–21), owner of the Chequers estate and later co-founder of the Courtauld Institute of Art. In 1923 he was involved with the creation of the Ashtead Pottery. In 1924-25 he organised the British Empire Exhibition, for which he received his knighthood (KBE). Lawrence's wife, Kathleen, died in 1927 of pneumonia, and when he died unexpectedly of a heart attack in 1930 at the age of 53, their two sons, Purcell and Tobias were, in effect, adopted by the Sir Stafford Cripps family. Their son, Tobias Rushton Weaver (19 July 1911 – 10 June 2001), Sir Toby from 1973, was a civil servant and educationist, working in the Department of Education and Science for 27 years, culminating in his appointment as Deputy Secretary (1962–73), ending under Margaret Thatcher.Sir Toby Weaver obituary, The Independent, 11 June 2001 Books By Weaver: *English Leadwork: Its Art and History (B.

Description Site of the former Little Dell Station, September 2016 Little Dell is located alongside Utah State Route 65, about northeast of Interstate 80.http://www.utahfishinginfo.com/utahlakes/littledell.php It is an impoundment on Dell Creek, but it also stores water diverted from Parleys Creek located immediately downstream. The reservoir was constructed between 1987 and 1993 for drinking water supply and flood control as a joint venture between the United States Army Corps of Engineers, Metropolitan Water District of Salt Lake City and Salt Lake County. The total cost of the project was US$63,864,932.00. The reservoir and recreation area is operated and maintained by the Salt Lake City Department of Public Utilities. Construction of a storage facility on Dell Creek in Parley's Canyon, Salt Lake County, Utah was first considered in the late 1940s when Dr. Ray E. Marsell, geologist consultant for the Utah Water and Power Board, recommended the project to the Salt Lake City Commission. Interest in the project was rekindled in 1983 when East 1300 South in Salt Lake City was flooded for the second time in 31 years. The Little Dell Reservoir dam is a rolled earthfill structure. It has a maximum height of above the streambed and is in length.http://www.waterquality.utah.gov/watersheds/lakes/LITTLEDL.pdf The recreation area at Little Dell is located near the site of a historic Pony Express station run by Utah pioneer Ephraim Hanks in the mid-19th century. Known as Little Dell Station, it was situated about northeast of the northernmost tip of the reservoir. The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. A typical example of a Bonneville cutthroat trout from Little Dell reservoir, 2020 Unlike nearby Mountain Dell Reservoir—which was drained in 2019 to accommodate repairs on the Mountain Dell Dam—fishing at Little Dell is currently allowed, but with restrictions. Worms, salmon eggs, cheeses, power baits, pickled minnows, and other forms of organic bait are off-limits. Anglers are allowed to use spinners, spoons, poppers, jerk baits, soft plastics, wet and dry flies, or any other artificial lure. Little Dell contains Brook trout, Brown trout, and is best known for a brood stock of healthy native Bonneville cutthroat trout. Anglers are not allowed to keep any Bonneville cutthroats caught at Little Dell, and all Bonneville cutthroat must be released, as part of a Utah state program to protect and promote this specific cutthroat species. Little Dell's population of Bonneville cutthroats have become renown for their size, given the reservoir's location so close to Salt Lake City. Shore fishing can be done virtually any time of the year—though the Little Dell park entrance at the highway may be closed during winter months, anglers and hikers can still walk down to the water's edge from the parking area near the gate. Fishing can also be done from non-motorized small watercraft, such as kayaks, canoes, float tubes, or other non-motorized means. There is a small hand-launch boat ramp at the western endpoint of the asphalt-paved road which switch-backs from the gate at the highway, down to the water below. Since its creation, Little Dell has become a popular outdoor recreation and picnic spot for residents of Salt Lake County, and beyond. Day access to the reservoir's facilities can be obtained at the gate for a $5.00 fee. The season runs from Memorial Day through October, though as mentioned for anglers, walk-down access from the parking area outside the gate is year-around. Little Dell Reservoir can be best viewed from Little Mountain Pass, located at the top of Emigration Canyon.

This new railroad was initially named the Greenbrier, Elk and Valley Railroad, and then renamed the GC&E; in 1910. Spruce became the area's rail hub, as tracks were extended west through Laurel Bank (Slatyfork) and along the Elk River to Bergoo by 1914; and north along the Shavers Fork valley to Cheat Junction by 1917. The pulp mill in Spruce closed in 1925. Subsequently the town declined and it eventually was abandoned. In 1927 the GC&E; was acquired by the WM.

The Historia silense, also called the Chronica silense or Historia seminense, and more properly Historia legionense, is a medieval Latin narrative history of the Iberian Peninsula from the time of the Visigoths (409–711) to the first years of the reign of Alfonso VI of León and Castile (1065–1073). Though originally intended as a gesta of Alfonso, it is primarily an original account of the reign of his father, Ferdinand I (1037–1065). For its earlier history it relies on the works of Isidore of Seville, Julian of Toledo, and the Vitas sanctorum patrum Emeritensium for the Visigothic period, the Chronicle of Alfonso III for the ninth century, the work of Sampiro for the tenth and early eleventh centuries, and the Chronicon of Pelayo of Oviedo for the eleventh century. The Historia along with Pelayo's Chronicon provide the only surviving versions of Sampiro's otherwise lost history. Dates of composition and manuscripts The date of composition can be approximately fixed by internal evidence. In chapter 7 the author notes that \\"the whole length of [Alfonso VI's] fragile life has been run\\", indicating that he was writing after Alfonso's death in 1109. In chapter 13 there is a reference to the papal legate Cardinal Rainerius, who was holding a synod in León in 1090, later becoming Pope. Since Rainerius reigned as Paschal II from 1099 to January 1118 and there is no mention of his death, modern scholars have largely accepted that he was still alive at the time of composition.Barton and Fletcher, 12. The anonymous historian was thus at work between 1109 and 1118. A date in the first third of the twelfth century also accords well with certain copyist's errors apparent in the surviving manuscripts that probably indicate that the original was set down in Visigothic script.For example, perlabor was misread as profabor and dolore as dolose, cf. Barton and Fletcher, 12, though already noted by Pérez de Urbel. Scribes unfamiliar with Visigothic forms commonly mistook per- for por-, l for f, and r for s. The Historia survives in eight known manuscripts. The earliest—1181 in the Biblioteca Nacional de España—dates from the latter half of the fifteenth century and is a copy of a copy of the original. Consequently, the text of the Historia is highly corrupted and the various critical editions contain numerous emendations. The first published edition was made by Francisco de Berganza for his Antigüedades de España in 1721. He relied on the now lost Fresdelval manuscript, supposedly from c.1500. Three copies of the Fresdelval survive, none earlier than c.1600.Barton and Fletcher, 13. Authorship and provenance The Panteón de los Reyes at San Isidoro, where Ferdinand I and Alfonso VI were buried, and where the Historia silense may have been written. The author of the Historia identifies himself as a monk of the domus seminis (\\"house of the seed\\"), long identified with Benedictine monastery of Santo Domingo de Silos in Castile, based on a marginal note in the Fresdelval manuscript that read \\"Santo Domingo de Silos\\". This position was strongly defended by historian Justo Pérez de Urbel, himself a monk of Silos. The author's lack of interest in Castilian matters and his ignorance of Castilian geography, as well as the complete absence of Silos from the Historia, suggest another monastery, probably in León. The term domus seminis may derive from a misunderstanding of the abbreviation dms scis, which could have stood for Domnis Sanctis (\\"at the lord saints'\\"). The monastery of Sahagún, the most important monastery in León during the reign of Ferdinand I and which maintained close ties with the royal court, was often known as Domnis Sanctis on account of its dual dedication to Facundus and Primitivus.Barton and Fletcher, 13; Reilly, 389–90. While Sahagún is mentioned three times in the Historia and Alfonso VI was buried there, neither this burial nor the abbacy at Sahagún of Bernard de Sedirac (1080–85) are mentioned in places where they would be expected. Another possible source for domus seminis was suggested in 1961 by the paleographer Manuel C. Díaz y Díaz. He suggested that it was a mistaken expansion of sci ihnis, in fact an abbreviation of sancti Iohannis, that is, Saint John's. A house in the city of León, with a community of monks dedicated to John the Baptist and one of nuns dedicated to Pelagius of Córdoba (San Pelayo), was founded in 965 by Sancho I of León and enjoyed royal patronage. Though it suffered several raids from Almanzor, it was restored by Alfonso V (999–1028) and patronised heavily by his daughter Sancha and her husband, Ferdinand I.Barton and Fletcher, 14. Francisco de Berganza records the intention of Sancha and Ferdinand to establish San Isidoro as their dynastic mausoleum. In 1063 these monarchs had the relics of Isidore translated from Seville to Saint John's, which they refurbished and embellished. The house was thereafter known as San Isidoro de León (though the use of \\"Saints John and Isidore\\" for the male community is found in a diploma of Alfonso VI of 1099). The anonymous author, if sancti Iohannis was indeed his intention, may have sought to indicate that he became a monk at the monastery before 1063.Barton and Fletcher, 15. He elsewhere refers to the church as hanc ecclesiam (this church), indicating perhaps his own locality and his intended audience (his brother monks). The author is sometimes known as the Monk of Silos, despite that this identification has now been discredited. His purpose in writing he declares in the seventh chapter to describe \\"the deeds of the lord Alfonso, the orthodox emperor of Spain\\", that is, Alfonso VI.Barton and Fletcher, 10. He also testifies to the \\"wisdom and goodness\\" of Urraca of Zamora, Alfonso's sister and ally, \\"more by experience than by report\\". Urraca was a noted patron of San Isidoro, where she was buried and where her donation of the Chalice of Doña Urraca survives to this day. Besides the Christian Bible, the author quotes liberally from Ovid, Virgil, and Gregory the Great, but his favourt authors are Sallust (the Bellum Catilinae and Bellum Iugurthinum) and Einhard (the Vita Karoli magni).Barton and Fletcher, 17. Contents and structure The surviving Historia is a preamble or introduction intended to provide the historical background to the (probably) unfinished Gesta Adefonsi. Pérez de Urbel divided it into chapters for his 1959 edition.A summary of the contents is provided in Barton and Fletcher, 10–12. The first six chapters describe the Visigothic kingdom and introduces the themes that will be developed in the rest of the work. The seventh chapter is a description of the author's purpose in writing, and it contains the most important clues to his identity. Chapters eight through thirteen narrate the opening of Alfonso VI's reign and his conflict with his brothers, Sancho II of Castile and García II of Galicia. The author mentions the death and burial of García in 1090 and then announces that he will \\"unravel the kingdom's origin\\" in the next chapters. The text comes (mostly) in blocks of edited text taken from older historical works. The first block (chapters 14–38) is drawn from the Chronicle of Alfonso III, specifically the earlier 'Rotense version' found in the late-10th-century Códice de Roda. It covers the period from the reign of Wittiza (694–710) to that of Ordoño I (850–866). The second (chapters 39–47) narrates the reigns of Alfonso III, García I, and Ordoño II from 866 to 924. It ends in mid-sentence and may have been the original work of the \\"monk of Silos\\". The third is taken from Sampiro and corresponds with the first thirty chapters of his work (as numbered by Pérez de Urbel in his 1952 edition and not re-numbered by him in 1959). These chapters cover the years from 866 to the death of Alfonso V (1028), but differ from the preceding chapters with respect to the years up to 924. Sampiro's text, as incorporated into the Historia, shows little signs of editing and may have been a late addition or perhaps the later addition of a different compiler. The thirtieth and final chapter of Sampiro does show signs of editing (for which its English translators, Simon Barton and Richard A. Fletcher, numbered it 30*). The monk resumes his original account after Sampiro with a chapter numbered 69. This chapter through 79 concerns the history of León between 956 and 1037 (and includes yet more overlap with the preceding chapters of Sampiro). Chapters 78 and 79 may quote from a now lost planctus of Vermudo III (died 1037, buried at San Isidoro). Chapter 74 provides background on the Kingdom of Navarre. The final section of the Historia (chapters 80–106) is a history of the reign of Ferdinand I, with an interpolated and edited version of the Translatio sancti Isidori (chapters 96–102), an account of the translation of Isidore's relics in 1063.When the author of the original text made reference to the then Bishop of León, Alvito, he referred to him as Legionensis urbis episcopus (bishop of the city of León), but the author of the Historia modified this to huiuscemodo regie urbis episcopus (bishop of this royal city). León was often referred to as the \\"royal city\\", but this minor emendation may support the connexion of its author with the house of San Isidoro located within the city walls. Cf. Barton and Fletcher, 15. The final two chapters (105–6) may also be derived from a now lost source describing Ferdinand's last days. The last recorded event in the Historia is the funeral of Ferdinand on 2 January 1066. Ferdinand's last days took place at San Isidoro. Four Horsemen in a manuscript of Beatus of Osma's Commentary on the Apocalypse made in 1086, the same year as the battle of Sagrajas and probably depicting contemporary Spanish knights. Themes Thematically, the Historia extols the Visigothic monarchy as the most orthodox in Christendom (more so even than the empire of Constantine) after its conversion in 589. The Leonese kingdom is called the Hispanie regnum (kingdom of Spain) and is presented as the legitimate successor to the Visigoths: the Leonese kings had been cleansed by punishment through the \\"barbarians\\" (Muslims). They redeem themselves in rescuing the churches from Muslim domination. Alfonso VI's championing of the Roman rite against the Mozarabic rite is held up as an example of orthodoxy. Genealogically the Leonese kings are of the stirps regalis Gotorum (royal stock of the Goths), an anachronism since the Gothic monarchy was elective.Alfonso I descended from Reccared I according to the Historia, cf. Barton and Fletcher, 19. The Visigothic and Leonese kingdoms are consistently described in imperial terms. The \\"kingdom of the Cantabrians\\" (Navarre) is called a \\"province\\" and its kings are \\"noble\\" (not royal), while the Kingdom of Aragon is but a \\"little fragment\\" of the province of Navarre. It is possible that the consistent dismissal of Aragon had contemporary significance, since the author was writing at a time when the \\"emperor\\" Alfonso the Battler was devastating the lands around León, including some belonging to San Isidoro, in battles with the supporters of Alfonso VI's heiress, Urraca, who happened also to be Alfonso the Battler's wife.Barton and Fletcher, 20. Lucas de Tuy refers to Alfonso as a despoiler of San Isidoro in his Liber de miraculis sancti Isidori, written in the early thirteenth century. The Historia also denigrates Frankish accomplishments in Spain. During the Visigothic period, it is claimed, they aided heretics and rebels against the orthodox Goths. Charlemagne's army, whom the French claimed had conquered parts of Spain, is compared to the French army that aided Alfonso VI in 1087 after the Battle of Sagrajas (1086). These soldiers, the allies of Alfonso's French queen, Constance of Burgundy, were paid handsomely in gold but left Spain having accomplished little against its newest Muslim invaders, the Almoravids. Charlemagne, too, according to the anonymous Historia, left Spain in ignominy, having been bribed to come in the first place. French aid to Aragon at the time of writing may have inspired or confirmed the author's anti-French sentiment.Barton and Fletcher, 20–21. Purpose The Historia may have been intended to reassure Spaniards that they would come through the live threat of war with Aragon and the Almoravid conquests in the same way they had come through the wars of Almanzor a century earlier and the Muslim conquests four centuries earlier. Christian Spain would be restored. It has been speculated that the Historia was designed as a Leonese \\"mirror for princes\\".Barton and Fletcher, 21. Queen Urraca's son and heir, Alfonso VII (born 1105), was of the right age for receiving such instruction, but he spent his early years in Galicia, far from San Isidoro and the centre of the kingdom. Urraca's eldest daughter, Sancha Raimúndez (1095–1159), is a more likely candidate, as she was probably raised in León and was a lifelong patron of San Isidoro, where she received burial. Sancha was active during her brother's reign, as demonstrated by the Chronica Adefonsi imperatoris and the surviving charters. Perhaps, through her counsel, the Historia served to shape, in part, the reign of Alfonso VII. An alternative interpretation of the Historia has been offered by medievalist John Wreglesworth. He suggests that it is a finished work \\"intended to be obliquely critical of Alfonso VI.\\"Barton and Fletcher present Wreglesworth's opinion, approved for publication by him, on pp. 22–3. This interpretation rests largely on a passage from the seventh chapter, which has been rendered in different ways: > Ubi diversis sententiis sanctorum patrum catholicorum regum, sacris > idicentibus libris, mecum ipse diu spatiando revolvens. > > There for a long time I ruminated in my own mind upon various opinions of > the holy fathers proclaimed in the holy books of Catholic kings. > > There I gave a lengthy consideration to the judgements of the holy Catholic > fathers on the sacred Books of Kings. The latter translation has the support not only of Wreglesworth but also of two Spanish translators: Manuel Gómez-Moreno and Jesús Evaristo Casariego. Wreglesworth interprets this passage as a reference to the \\"holy Catholic father\\" Isidore's commentary on the reign of Solomon. He sees parallels between Solomon (condemned for engaging foreign wives) and Alfonso (whose longest marriage was to the Frenchwoman, the aforementioned Constance, and who also had a relationship with a Muslim, Zaida of Seville). Alfonso's father, Ferdinand, like Solomon's father, David, was a paragon of kingly virtue (in the eyes of the historian's monastic author).

It is a rare ground orchid, named in honour of the first scientist to discover it, Lewis Roberts and has two ground-hugging leaves and up to nine small green flowers. It is an unusual species because of its highly modified column which lacks pollen and does not have a receptive stigma.  Description  Cooktownia robertsii is a tuberous, perennial herb with two dark green, ground hugging, egg-shaped to almost round leaves, long and wide with their bases overlapping. Between three and nine green flowers with darker lines, about long and wide are borne on a flowering stem tall. The sepals and petals are lance-shaped to egg-shaped, long and about wide. The labellum is about long and wide with its edges rolled inwards and has no spur. The flowers are apomictic, lack pollen and a receptive stigma, forming seeds without fertilisation. Flowering occurs between March and May. Taxonomy and naming Cooktownia robertsii was first formally described in 1997 by David Jones from a specimen collected in 1993. The generic name is derived from Cooktown, the nearest town to where this orchid is found. The specific epithet (robertsii) honours Lewis Roberts who discovered the orchid near his home in Shipton's Flat near Cooktown in the 1980s. Distribution and habitat The mystery orchid is only known from a small area south of Cooktown in tropical far north Queensland. Although it is highly localised, it can be locally common, is easily cultivated and reproduces freely. It is found in open forest in grassy areas in red gravelly or stony loam at altitudes from , with maximum extent between March and late April.

Salm-Salm served in the Schleswig-Holstein Army (Prussian Army), Austrian Army, the Union Army during the American Civil War, the army of Emperor Maximilian in Mexico and thereafter in the Prussian Army. He was killed in action during the Franco-Prussian War.Eicher, John H., and David J. Eicher, Civil War High Commands. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2001. . pp. 467-468 Life Prince Felix Constantin Alexander Johann Nepomuk of Salm- Salm, was born at Anholt Castle, the Residenz of the former Principality of Salm, which had been incorporated into the Prussian Province of Westphalia by 1815. He was the third and youngest son of Prince Florentin, the formerly reigning Prince of Salm-Salm (1786–1846), and his wife Flaminia di Rossi (1795-1840), a Corsican noblewoman and niece of Prince Felice Pasquale Baciocchi. The 1815 Congress of Vienna confirmed the Salm dynasty's loss of sovereignty but recognized the retention of royal privileges of the Princes of Salm-Salm as a Mediatized House in the German Confederation. Felix grew up training to be a soldier at a cadet-school in Berlin and became an officer in the Prussian 11th Hussar Regiment in 1846. Early on he participated in the First Schleswig War between northern Germany and Denmark. Severely wounded in a skirmish near Aarhus on 18 May 1849, he demonstrated bravery in battle. After the war he joined the Austrian army, serving in the Austro-Sardinian War of 1859. However, his erratic way of life alienated his family; substantial gambling debts as well as several scandals and duels finally forced him to emigrate. In 1861, he came to the United States and offered his services to the Union Army in the American Civil War. He was given a colonel's commission and assigned to the staff of Brigadier General Louis Blenker. It was at this time that he began to court an American woman named Agnes Leclerc Joy. He had met her at a reception given by President Abraham Lincoln in Washington, D. C., where he was introduced by the Prussian envoy Friedrich von Gerolt. Felix and Agnes would marry morganatically in August 1862. Agnes Salm-Salm would end up joining Felix on the battlefield because she could not bear being without him. That winter he took command of the 8th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment (which decided Gustav Struve to resign in protest), but would only remain there through the winter. He was appointed colonel of the 68th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment in June, 1864, serving under Brigadier General James B. Steedman in Tennessee and Georgia, he took part in the Battle of Nashville, and toward the end of the war was assigned to the command of the post at Atlanta. Salm-Salm was mustered out of the volunteers on November 30, 1865. On January 13, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated him for appointment to the grade of brevet brigadier general, to rank from April 13, 1865 and the U.S. Senate confirmed the appointment on March 12, 1866.Eicher, 2001, p. 756. Salm-Salm in Mexican uniform After the American Civil War was over, Salm-Salm offered his services to the Habsburg's Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico, and embarked for Mexico in February, 1866. Maximilian was actively promoting American soldiers to migrate to Mexico after the war to improve relations with the country. Salm-Salm was in an unusual position because he had fought for the Union while most of the Americans who moved to Mexico after the Civil War had fought for the Confederacy. By the summer he was appointed colonel and became the Emperor's aide-de-camp and chief of household. He was captured at Querétaro along with the emperor but not before he made a brave charge with his hussar cavalry in an attempt to save Maximilian from the surrounding Mexican Republican army under Benito Juárez. Together with the Emperor and his highest-ranking generals Tomás Mejía Camacho and Miguel Miramón he was sentenced to death by firing squad. Thanks to the tireless efforts of his wife (who had also tried to obtain a pardon for the Emperor Maximilian) he was pardoned by Juárez and released from custody in December 1867. During his captivity, he was promoted to the rank of brigadier general.Daniel Moreno. El sitio de Querétaro. Según protagonistas y testigos. (Editorial Porrúa, 3° Edición, México 1982) Soon after, he returned to Europe and re-entered the Prussian Army as major in the 4th Guards Grenadiers regiment. He was killed at Saint-Privat-la-Montagne during the Battle of Gravelotte in the Franco-Prussian War. His faithful wife Agnes who again had joined him, serving as a nurse on the battlefield, had his mortal remains transferred to the family crypt in Anholt Castle, Germany. His memoirs were edited by German author Otto von Corvin. The fate of Prince Salm-Salm was later perpetuated in the colportage novels by Karl May.

Pennsylvania law calls for the Sheriff to be elected every four years. The Montgomery County Sheriff's Office serves more than 800,000 residents and employs 115 officers along with 20 administrative staff. Working closely with other law enforcement agencies in the area, the sheriff's office is tasked with securing the Montgomery County Courthouse; transporting, transferring, and extraditing prisoners; enforcing court orders; issuing licenses to carry firearms; and conducting sales of real and personal property. Also part of their task is to process drivers who have been arrested under suspicion of a DUI, and other functions such as crowd control. The Montgomery County Sheriff's Office became the first sheriff's office in Pennsylvania to be accredited by the Pennsylvania Chiefs of Police Accreditation Commission on January 29, 2010. The office, with the assistance of the District Attorney's Office and a federal grant, also acquired three K-9's in October, 2013. The office is currently up for election. The current candidates are incumbent Sean Kilkenny and Melissa A Bowers Palmer. Mission statement \\"Our mission is to protect the citizens of the County and provide services to taxpayers with honesty, integrity and transparency. We will do so regardless of a citizen’s race, color, gender, religious creed, sexual orientation, age, origin, ancestry, economic status, handicap, or disability.\\" Sheriff Sean P. Kilkenny Sheriff Kilkenny was elected in 2015. He received his undergraduate degree from Villanova University and holds a master's degree in public administration from the University of South Carolina. Later, Kilkenny earned a law degree from Temple University. He also served in the U.S. Army as an officer and earned the rank of lieutenant colonel as a paratrooper and federal prosecutor in the Judge Advocate General Corps. At the U.S. Army War College he earned a master's degree in strategic studies. Kilkenny is currently the solicitor to several local townships and was previously the Council President of Jenkintown Borough, where he now resides. Recently, he was appointed by Pa. Gov.

Within the division is a special team of deputies assigned to assist domestic violence victims by safely escorting them throughout the complex during processing and hearings. =Warrants= More than a dozen staff make up the warrants division. Their task is to find and arrest defendants who are wanted for criminal, DUI, and unpaid child support charges. They also target and apprehend defendants who avoid hearings and sentencing. =Transportation and detention= The transportation and detention division consists of 16 deputies and three supervisors. Their role in the department is to transfer prisoners to and from surrounding counties and within the continental U.S. Annually, approximately 13,000 defendants were safely transferred by the division, Prisoners can also be held in the 16-cell detention center in the county court house, which can hold up to 100 prisoners. =Real estate= The real estate division is run by one supervisor and three office support personnel. They conduct monthly public sheriff's sales of properties that have been foreclosed. The division takes part in many community relations events to help meet homebuyer's needs. The real estate division are also responsible for the advertising sheriff's sales through local newspapers to increase and diversify clientele. =Special services= The special services division receives and processes the applications for permits to carry firearms and is responsible for distributing educational information about Pennsylvania gun laws and gun permits. The division also conducts monthly Firearm Safety and Awareness Seminars, which are popular with local residents. In the seminar, participants learn how to safely handle and clean firearms, as well as basic shooting fundamentals taught by certified law enforcement firearms experts. Specialty unitsBomb & Hazardous Device Disposal Unit= The Bomb & Hazardous Device Disposal Unit is responsible for the recovery and disposal of military ordinance and potentially explosive devices found in Montgomery County as well as Bucks and Chester counties. The bomb unit consists of seven highly trained bomb technicians and is the 25th busiest out of 466 units in the U.S. according to the National Bomb Squad Commander Advisory Board. Each member of the unit must have completed six weeks of training at the FBI Hazardous Devices School as well as 120 hours, annually, of specialized training with the Philadelphia Police Department Bomb Disposal Unit. The Bomb Unit has a strong interest in its community outreach programs, hosting environmentally safe “ammo burns” of old ammunition. Likewise, the unit loans old equipment to local school robotics programs and participates in mock community demonstrations. =Emergency Response Team= The Emergency Response Team (ERT) consists of 28 law enforcement personnel who are required to meet special physical agility standards and undergo 200 hours of training in areas such as SWAT operations, field force operations, riot control, active shooter response and responses to chemical, radiological, nuclear and explosive emergencies. The team is also called on special occasions where their expertise is needed, such as securing high-profile murder trial courtrooms and prison cell extractions, as well as assisting with securing public events such as the papal visit to Philadelphia in 2017 and Philadelphia Eagles Super Bowl Parade in 2018. =K-9 Unit= The MCSO's K-9 unit has three K-9 partners and a commander who cooperate with other agencies such as bomb and narcotics detection, suspect tracking, patrol, warrant sweeps and finding missing children. K-9 receive months of training overseas before being matched with their handlers, who also undergo special training to build chemistry with their K-9. The unit has won several awards in national competitions. =Bike Patrol Unit= The nine members of the Bike Patrol Unit serve as part of the Emergency Response Team.

According to Fétis, Dietsch was a choirboy at Dijon Cathedral and studied from 1822 at Choron's Institution Royale de Musique Classique et Religieuse in Paris. In 1830, Dietsch entered the Paris Conservatory and studied with Anton Reicha. His subjects included double bass, for which he won a first prize at the Conservatoire, as well counterpoint (with Reicha).Cooper & Millington 2001. Later, with the founding of the École Niedermeyer (successor of Choron's Institution) in 1853, Dietsch taught harmony, counterpoint, and fugue in a position he held up until his death. Dietsch composed church music as well as an opera, Le Vaisseau fantôme, ou Le Maudit des mers (\\"The Phantom Ship, or The Accursed of the Sea\\"), which was first performed on 9 November 1842 at the Paris Opera. The libretto by Paul Foucher and H. Révoil was based on Walter Scott's The Pirate as well as Captain Marryat's The Phantom Ship and other sources, although Wagner thought it was based on his scenario for Der fliegende Holländer, which he had just sold to the Opéra. The similarity of Dietsch's opera to Wagner's is slight, although Wagner's assertion is often repeated. Berlioz thought Le Vaisseau fantôme too solemn, but other reviewers were more favourable. In 1840, Dietsch had become chorus master at the Paris Opéra on Rossini's recommendation. He took over from Girard as conductor in 1860, but nonetheless could not avoid run-ins with the greatest composers of his day: Wagner blamed the fiasco of the Paris Opéra premiere of Tannhäuser (1861) on the conductor (perhaps unjustly, as Wagner had been closely involved in the opera's 164 rehearsals), and in 1863 Dietsch resigned over a dispute with Verdi in the midst of rehearsals for Verdi's Les Vêpres siciliennes. He died in Paris aged 56. =Ave Maria attributed to Arcadelt= The most well known work of Dietsch may be the Ave Maria he presented in 1842 and attributed to Franco-Flemish Renaissance composer Jacques Arcadelt. Dietsch presented the work as a discovery of a four-voice Ave Maria by Arcadelt, when in fact it was Dietsch's own arrangement of Arcadelt's three-voice chanson Nous voyons que les hommes. The work was popular, leading to an arrangement for solo piano entitled Chanson d'Arcadelt \\"Ave Maria\\" (S.183) by Franz Liszt published in 1865, and serving as a direct source for the initial section of the principal theme of the Maestoso in the Organ Symphony of Camille Saint-Saëns published in 1886. In the latter case, this theme is among the most recognizable part of one of the most well known of Saint-Saëns' works, with several modern interpretations in popular music. Nevertheless, Saint-Saëns' criticized the work itself, noting in a letter printed in The Catholic Choirmaster =Recordings= Le Vaisseau fantôme has been recorded by Les Musiciens du Louvre, Grenoble under Marc Minkowski.

It is unknown when the first sled dog race was held. Humans have domesticated dogs for thousands of years, and sled dogs have been used for transportation in Arctic areas for almost as long. The first sled dog race to feature a codified set of rules was the All-Alaska Sweepstakes, which first took place in 1908. This was followed in 1917 by the American Dog Derby, which was the first sled dog race outside Alaska or the Yukon.International Sled Dog Racing Association. \\"History of Sled Dog Racing . Accessed May 20, 2009. In 1932, sled dog racing was a demonstration sport at the 1932 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York, but was only included in one other winter olympics in a slightly different form of sled dog racing known as pulka.White, Tim. \\"A history of mushing before we knew it\\" . International Federation of Sleddog Sports, Inc. Accessed May 20, 2009. The most famous sled dog race is the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, an annual 1000-mile race across Alaska. It commemorates the 1925 serum run to Nome. The first idea for a commemorative sled dog race over the historically significant Iditarod Trail was conceived Dorothy Page, the chair of the Wasilla-Knik Centennial Committee. Even though the race known today was not first run until 1973, thanks to the work of Joe Redington and his supporters. Joe Redington and the Iditarod helped restart worldwide interest in mushing, specifically in long-distance events. Since mushing's resurgence, the sport has proliferated and sled dog races are hosted in towns around the world, from Norway and Finland to Alaska and Michigan. Due to the cold temperatures needed for sled dog racing, most races are held in winter in cold climates, but occasional carting events, typically known as dryland races, have been held in warmer weather. Other similar sports that using mushing as a means for transport include; carting, pulka, dog scootering, skijoring, freighting, and weight pulling. These are not included in this list because they do not use sleds. A resurfaced race in 2020 is the Klondike Dog Derby, a 40-mile race around Lake Minnetonka in Excelsior, Minnesota. The race began in the 1930s and died out in 1998, until recently restarting. The majority of sled dog races in North America are held close to the northern border of the United States or farther north. Well-attended races in the United States such as the John Beargrease Sled Dog Marathon, Apostle Island Sled Dog Race, and the U.P. 200, all take place in the upper regions of Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan, respectively. After these races, the majority of dog sled races take place farther north, in Canada or Alaska. The Klondike Dog Derby is one of few held in a more urban area that is not in the far north. Bringing the sport to an urban area of Minnesota has brought attention from local news sources and residents, allowing for first-hand familiarization and education of the sport of mushing that is otherwise hard to come across in an area that is not in the far north. The accessory events held the weekend of the Klondike Dog Derby include the Hug-a-Husky event, Meet the Musher, and allotted time for the public to hear musher's talk and answer questions on the sport. These events follow the same outline as the Klondike Dog Derby originally had, starting in the 1930s during Hennepin County's winter ice carnivals. The original race took place during a festival held annually by the Works Progress Administration called \\"Klondike Day.\\" The festival featured a coronation of an Ice Princess and Ice Queen, a snow modeling contest, ski races, a skating party, and the dog derby. The race featured different classes and allowed people of all ages to harness their dogs to any sled they had at their disposal. This served as a way to connect sled dog racing to the people and bring the community together, thus bringing further attention to the sport throughout the area. The race was reintroduced in 2020 as a tribute dog mushers and their commitment to the sport. The race allows for spectators and gives people an opportunity to meet the racers and their dogs. This is meant to create a more interactive atmosphere surrounding the sport in the upper Midwest. There are three typical types of sled dog races: sprint, mid-distance, and long-distance. These types can be broken down into sub-types. Sprint races cover relatively short distances of 4 to 25 miles/day, mid-distance races cover a total of 100 to 300 miles, and long- distance races cover 300 miles to more than 1,000 miles. Sprint races frequently are two- or three-day events with heats run on successive days with the same dogs on the same course. Mid-distance races are either heat races of 14 to 80 miles per day, or continuous races of 100 to 200 miles. (These categories are informal and may overlap to a certain extent.) Long-distance races may be continuous or stage races, in which participants run a different course each day, usually from a central staging location. Generally, teams start one after another in equal time intervals, competing against the clock rather than directly against one another. This is due to logistic considerations of getting teams of dogs to the starting line for a clean timed start. Mass starts where all of the dog teams start simultaneously are popular in parts of Canada. Another mode of dogsled racing is the freight race, in which a specified weight per dog is carried in the sled.  Sprint races  * Northern Pines Sled Dog Race, Iron River Wisconsin.

National Geographic says that when looking for qualities in a sled dog, you should look first at their feet. Since the races usually last for a long time, especially in the hard weather conditions, the feet of the dog tend to bear most of the work. Since softer feet don't usually do that well in those conditions and putting booties on dogs slow them down, that is what makes the Alaskan Husky so great at these races. In addition, Alaskan Huskies are mixed- breed, which has been happening for many generations. The breeding focuses on the parts of the huskies that do well for racing: endurance, strength, speed, tough feet, and appetites. Arguably, next to having good feet, the ability to be harnessed and race with a team is the next most important trait for making the Alaska Husky the most popular and best dog sledding breed.

The encoding two genes are TSC1 and TSC2. The complex is known as a tumor suppressor. Mutations in these genes can cause tuberous sclerosis complex. Depending on the grade of the disease, mental retardation, epilepsy and tumors of the skin, retina, heart, kidney and the central nervous system can be symptoms.  Physiological roles  The TSC1/TSC2-complex integrates environmental signals such as stress and energy status in yeast and stress, energy status and growth factors in mammals into TOR signalling. In the case of stress (DNA damage, hypoxia) or low energy availability, it is activated and regulates protein synthesis down. Growth factors lead to an inhibition of the complex and have a positive effect on protein synthesis. Defects in its genes result in less control of cell growth and may cause tuberous sclerosis or tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). TSC is a rare genetic disease causing benign tumours to grow in the brain and on other vital organs. A combination of symptoms may include seizures, developmental delay, behavioural problems, skin abnormalities, lung and kidney disease.  Regulation  The TSC1 and TSC2 proteins form a heterodimeric complex which acts as an important integrator of different signaling pathways controlling mTOR signaling, by regulating especially mTORC1 activity. TSC2 contains a GTPase Activating Protein (GAP) domain which has been shown to stimulate (down regulate) the GTPase activity of the small GTPase Rheb, which is – in its GTP bound form – an activator of mTORC1. TSC1 does not have a GAP domain but it acts as a stabilizer of TSC2 by protecting it from degradation. The activity of the TSC1-TSC2 complex is regulated by phosphorylation of different Ser and Thr sites mediated by the following Pathways: * PI3K-AKT signalling: AKT inhibits TSC1-TSC2 by phosphorylating TSC2 on 2-5 sites. However the molecular mechanism is yet unknown since the GAP activity of TSC2 is not remarkably influenced by these phosphorylation events. * Low energy levels and stress: The AMP-dependent protein kinase AMPK phosphorylates and thereby activates TSC1-TSC2 by phosphorylating at least 2 residues of TSC2. * Hypoxia: The Hypoxia-inducible factor α HIFα induces REDD1 at low oxygen levels. REDD1 has been shown to activate TSC1-TSC2 by neutralisation of AKT dependent inhibition. * ERK-RSK signalling: When it is activated by ERK, RSK phosphorylates and inhibits TSC1-TSC2. TSC2 has 3 phosphorylation sites for RSK. Two of them are also substrates of AKT.  Gene  The TSC1 gene is located on chromosome 9q34 and encodes the 130 kDa protein hamartin containing 1163 amino acids. The TSC2 gene is located on chromosome 16p13.3 and codes for the 200 kDa protein tuberin containing 1807 amino acids.  Protein structure  The following functions of tuberin have been identified: * GTPase- accelerating protein (GAP) function for the Rap1a GTPase. * C-terminal transcriptional activation domains. * Selective modulation of transcription mediated by members of the steroid receptor superfamily.

It is located just west of Skaha Lake, and is about 7.8 km long. Course The Marron River originates in small Aeneas Lake, which is located about 7.8 km west of Skaha Lake, at the head of the Marron Valley (Marron Valley is also the name of the local community). The river flows southeast for about 2 kilometers until it enters the second lake along its course, Marron Lake. Marama Creek, the river’s only officially named tributary, enters the lake’s south shore. The river, after exiting Marron Lake, flows northeast for about 3.1 km as it continues its way down Marron Valley toward Skaha Lake. The river than turns southeast & flows that way for another 3.1 km until it reaches a small, unnamed lake just west of Skaha Lake. Mouth The Marron River’s mouth is somewhat different than the mouths of many other British Columbia rivers in the sense that it ends in a lake with no outlet. The river enters an unnamed lake that is located about .4 km west of Skaha that has no above-ground outlet. There is likely an underground outlet that carries the outflow from the lake somewhere else (possibly Skaha Lake). While this is an interesting feature, there are a handful of other rivers in British Columbia that do this; many of which are in Central British Columbia where the terrain is flatter & features like this are more common. Naming The river may have been first called the River of the Wild Horses back in 1833 by botanist David Douglas. The river was given its current name in 1871. The word Marron is French and it has several meanings. One of them is \\"domestic animal that has become wild\\". According to Mrs. William Allen and Mr. F. M. Buckland, a lot of wild horses roamed the area around the river, which is likely why the river was given the name it was in reference to the wild horses that roamed the surrounding terrain. The river’s source lake, Aeneas Lake, was named after an Indian by the name of Little Aeneas. He lived at the south end of the lake, alone, for many years before dying at over 100 years old.

He is best known for his work on the Krio language and for translating Shakespeare's Julius Caesar into the Krio language. Decker argued forcefully that the Krio language was not merely a patois but a legitimate language. Because Decker argued that Krio was not a patois, his contributions and revisions to the Krio language greatly influenced and added to the revival and appreciation of the language. Background and early life Thomas Decker was born to Sierra Leonean parents, Joseph Leighton Decker and Jane Decker (née Fraser), in Calabar, Nigeria. His father was a colonial surveyor and architect, while his mother was a trader. Decker was the fourth child and had six siblings, one of whom later studied to become a doctor in England. His mother, Jane, was from a large family from Murray Town, descended from David Pakudi Fraser, a Liberated African slave (of Nigerian origin) who after being freed from the holds of a slave ship was settled in Murray Town. Jane was the eldest daughter of Thomas Crowley Fraser, the son of Pakudi Fraser. T. C. Fraser was a successful merchant and one-time Justice of Peace of the Waterloo District in Sierra Leone. The Fraser family was quite prominent and alongside the Hyde family (some branches of Hydes were of Fraser stock) owned large plots of land in Murray Town. Thomas Decker attended the CMS Grammar School in Lagos until the death of his father in 1920, when his mother decided to move the family back to Sierra Leone and where he attended the CMS Grammar School in Freetown. After graduating from the grammar school, Decker entered the Teacher Training Department at Fourah Bay College. After completing his training, Decker taught for eighteen months before deciding to become a journalist and writer. Journalism and Civil Service Decker had tried to join the Royal Air Force but was unable to because he had eye problems. He continued to write and worked for ITA Wallace-Johnson's African Standard. Decker's \\"radical\\" views of the day were reflected during his work for the Standard. Later on he was editor of the Daily Guardian a premier newspaper in the colony. During his editorship of the Guardian, Decker was known for his skilled writing, and contributions to national affairs in Sierra Leone. Political activities Decker was a disciple of Isaac Wallace-Johnson's West African Youth League, which had a strong anti-colonial message and who fought for equality and independence of Sierra Leone and its citizens. Decker believed in the unification of the Protectorate and the Crown Colony, and he believed that the Krio language would have a large part to play in realizing the dream of a united Sierra Leone. Revision on the Krio language Thomas Decker was one of the first people to term Sierra Leone's lingua franca \\"Krio\\". He argued for the widespread of use of Krio throughout the country, and to him it was a unifying force for the nation after independence. Decker's work on the Krio language sparked a revival in the appreciation for the language. During the 1960s, Decker was considered to be the leader of young Krio linguists, and it was during this time period that some of his most famous works were published. Later years and legacy Decker became sick in June 1978, and on 7 September 1978 he died at the Royal Masonic Hospital in London. The decade before his death, Decker had been at the forefront of the national movement of that time, and he was remembered for his work on the Krio language in the bicentenary celebration of the founding of the Province of Freedom. Shortly before his death, Decker was awarded an OBE for his literary efforts. Miscellaneous *Lati Hyde, the first female graduate of Fourah Bay College and first African principal of Annie Walsh Memorial School, was a member of the Fraser family and she was Thomas Decker's first cousin. *Talabi Lucan, a Sierra Leonean author, is the first cousin of Thomas Decker, through her descent from the Fraser family. *Christiana Thorpe, the current chief of the Sierra Leone National Electoral Commission, is the third cousin of Thomas Decker due to her descent from the Fraser family of Murray Town. *Thomas Decker was named for his maternal grandfather, Thomas C.

Kenul is a retired NOAA Corps rear admiral (lower half) who last served as the Director, NOAA Marine and Aviation Operations Centers, which are part of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Office of Marine and Aviation Operations (OMAO). As director, Kenul was responsible for the operation of NOAA aircraft and ships as well as the management of OMAO’s operations centers’ $100M budget and more than 500 fleet personnel. Kenul retired from the NOAA Corps after over 30 years of service. Career Kenul was appointed into the NOAA Corps in 1981. His first tour was aboard NOAA hydrographic survey ship NOAAS Whiting; he then served as chief of a shore- based hydrographic field party surveying in the Gulf of Mexico. In 1985, he received flight training through NOAA's Aircraft Operations Center, and most of his career since then has been focused on NOAA aviation. Kenul flew light aircraft in support of aeronautical charting and photogrammetry while also serving as chief of those respective branches. He then trained with the Navy to become a P-3 aircraft pilot, and served with the Operations Branch, Naval Research Laboratory. There he supervised 22 Naval officers and 90 enlisted personnel, and was responsible for the worldwide deployment of five Navy P-3 research aircraft. In 1996, he reported to NOAA's Aircraft Operations Center, where he served consecutive positions covering aircraft operations as Heavy Aircraft Coordinator, Special Projects Officer, Chief of Flight Management, and Chief of the Aircraft Maintenance Branch. During this time he also served as a NOAA hurricane hunter pilot, flying P-3s into the eyewall of hurricanes to acquire the meteorological data needed by forecasters to make accurate hurricane predictions—one of only a handful of pilots in the world qualified to fly P-3s into hurricanes. Kenul was selected in 2001 for NOAA's first Leadership Competency Development Program. The following year, he was named the first Director of NOAA's newly established Homeland Security Office, which was also one of the first NOAA-wide matrix programs. There he was responsible for coordinating the delivery of NOAA's products, services, and capabilities to Federal, state, and local emergency managers and responders, and strengthening NOAA's own infrastructure to protect agency personnel, facilities, and information services. In this capacity he positioned NOAA to be a recognized and vital contributor to the Nation's Homeland Security effort. Kenul assumed command of the Aircraft Operations Center in 2006, where he oversaw the daily operations of NOAA's light and heavy aircraft. NOAA aircraft conduct such operations as snow surveys to support hydrological forecasts of flooding and drought; marine mammal assessments, including endangered right whale surveys; remote sensing in support of homeland security; aeronautical charting; and disaster assessments following extreme weather events.

The Harrisburg Colliery Coal Company Mine was sunk in November 1916, in the center of section 27, township 8, range 5, Saline County, Illinois, and the town of Harco soon grew up around it. The name of the town is derived from the first three letters of Harrisburg and the first two letters of Colliery, spelling “Harco.” The Harrisburg Colliery Company was organized by J. H. Kilmer of Chicago, and Ed Qualkenbush, D. K. Seten, and O. D. Norman, of Harrisburg, Illinois. D. K. Seten was a grocer and O. D. Norman, his brother- in-law, was the husband of Mrs. Hattie Norman and the father of Mrs. Mary Lindsay, of Harrisburg. HistoryMining= Harco was founded based on discovery of coal. The first coal was hoisted January 6, 1918. In later years, it was known as the Saline County Coal Corporation, and later as the Peabody Coal Company Mine No. 47. Harco was plotted June 24, 1919, with the plate showing 121 lots 50 by . It is listed that 134 men lost their lives in accidents at the Harco mines, Peabody no. 47, and west of Harco, Peabody no. 40. There were 11 killed in an explosion August 31, 1921 and 8 killed in an explosion December 28, 1941. Harco mine was closed April 25, 1951, but the coal washer continued to process coal until 1954. The mine was then dismantled. To accommodate its workers, the coal company built four-room houses on the east side of town and the five and six room houses on the south side. The houses were prefabricated Sears Catalog Homes shipped by railroad to the mine and then delivered to the building sites by wagon. Some of the families were living in tents and were so anxious to move in that they did so before the doorknobs were placed on the doors. When the Harco mine closed in April 1951, families living in the company houses were given evacuation notices. The houses were offered for sale at $50 a room, and several of the houses were moved intact. Some of the empty houses burned, and rest were torn down, for the land was not sold with the houses. =Facilities= The Harco post office was established in November 21, 1917, and Thomas Hoffman was its first postmaster. In later years, Lois C. Naugle was postmaster for twenty years, with the post office housed inside Naugle’s general store. There was a one-room school known as 'Vinyard School'. A larger framed two-room school was built and ready in the fall of 1917. Several years later it burned down, and a large two-story brick five-room school building was built. J. Ogden opened the first store in the village. There was a forty-room hotel to accommodate the miners. Other stores included the Company Store, owned and operated by C. V. Parker; a grist mill and a grocery store run by Charlie Manier and a general store. The Gibbon’s Drug Store had a registered pharmacist and a soda fountain, whilst another drug store also sold patent medicines and sundries. Dr. M. D. Empson and Dr. R. G. Bond practiced medicine in Harco. Neotere “Butch” LePontre ran the local meat market. The village had a shoe store, blacksmith, and a two-chair barbershop. There was a one-room jailhouse. For many years there was a wood-framed Baptist church in Harco. The Old Brushy Cemetery is nearby. Population The present population of Harco is near 200 but in the 1920s the population was about 1,200, and the village, which was never incorporated, supported two drug stores, three groceries, two general stores, and a feed mill. The Webber interests of the Bank of Galatia operated a bank there until the end of that decade. =Amish settlement= In May 2007 a group of 60 Amish men, women and children moved from Wisconsin to Saline County, Illinois where they purchased almost of land to farm near Harco.John D.

May 25, 2017 Name 105 Street, also known as 105th Street, was originally named Fifth Street (or informally 5th Street). It was renamed 105th in 1914, as part of a citywide street renaming programme that was precipitated by the 1912 amalgamation of the then-city of Strathcona with the city of Edmonton. Route descriptionQueen Elizabeth Park Road= Queen Elizabeth Park Road begins at Saskatchewan Drive, just east of Gateway Boulevard, and descends the North Saskatchewan River valley, passing through Queen Elizabeth Park. In the floor of the valley, next to the Kinsman Park entrance, the roadway joins Walterdale Hill and becomes 105 Street. Queen Elizabeth Park Road is part of the major inbound connect between Highway 2 and the Edmonton International Airport. There have been proposals to improve the Gateway Boulevard connection with the Walterdale Bridge and downtown Edmonton by removing hairpin turn required to access Queen Elizabeth Park Road. Due to the topography of the river valley, proposals have shown that Gateway Boulevard would have to be realigned in pass under Saskatchewan Drive. There is no finalized alignment or timeline for construction. =Walterdale Hill= Walterdale Hill functions as the northbound one-way pair of 109 Street, which is southbound one-way between 97 Avenue and Saskatchewan Drive, crossing the North Saskatchewan River via the High Level Bridge. It descends the North Saskatchewan River valley from the 109 Street / Saskatchewan Drive intersection and joins Queen Elizabeth Park Road at the valley floor, continuing as 105 Street. The roadway gets its name from John Walter, early pioneer and settler in Fort Edmonton. =105 Street= 105 Street begins at the Queen Elizabeth Park Road / Walterdale Hill intersection and crosses the North Saskatchewan along the Walterdale Bridge, adjacent to the former Walterdale Bridge. 105 Street begins to climb out the valley, entering downtown Edmonton. At 100 Avenue, it becomes a two-way street, crossing Jasper Avenue and 104 Avenue, and continues north past the eastern edge of MacEwan University. At 105 Avenue, the Metro Line of the Edmonton LRT enters the centre of the roadway adjacent to MacEwan station and travels north to 107 Avenue. 105 Street used to continue north as a residential street, but the roadway was removed to make way for the LRT railway.

Kanwar studied at the Department of History, Ramjas College, Delhi University (1982-1985), and at the Mass Communication Research Center, Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi (1985–87). After making a few films, Kanwar joined the People's Science Institute in 1988 as a researcher on occupational health and safety in the coal-mining belt of Madhya Pradesh in central India. He returned to filmmaking in 1990, and his films were then shown primarily in public campaigns, community spaces and film festivals in India and across the world. Kanwar's filmmaking practice challenges the limits of the medium in order to create complex narratives traversing several terrains such as labour and indigenous rights, gender, religious fundamentalism and ecology. In 2002, Kanwar was invited to exhibit at Documenta 11 in Kassel whereupon his work has also been presented in several art exhibitions and museums. Connecting with diverse audiences, in multiple public spaces, Kanwar also participated in the next three editions of the Documenta exhibition in 2007, 2012 and 2017.

Agnes Elizabeth, Princess of Salm Salm, during the Civil War Little is known of the early life of Agnes Salm-Salm. Many scholars believe that she worked in a circus, then as an actress in Cuba. In 1861 she returned to the United States but soon left her home in Vermont to visit her sister in Washington, D.C. who was getting married. Agnes stayed around Washington when she met Prince Felix Salm-Salm, a soldier of fortune, and a distant relation to the Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria-Hungary.John J. Duffy, Samuel B. Hand, Ralph H. Orth,The Vermont Encyclopedia, UPNE, 2003, p. 185. She had been riding her horse one morning through the city when Felix first saw her and he made sure she was invited to a party that he would be attending. Soon Felix proposed to her and they were married in August 30, 1862, despite opposition from her family (he was Catholic and she was Protestant). American Civil War Prince Felix had a post as adjutant of Louis Blenker in the Army of the Potomac, and soon proceeded to the front. Agnes could not be apart from Felix for too long and eventually followed him to the battlefield. At his camp she would care for the sick and wounded soldiers although she had no previous knowledge of medicine. For four years she traveled with the troops through war-torn Virginia. As the wife of a colonel she had access to supply wagons and luggage meant for the officers and would often steal supplies in order to care for the soldiers. This sparked a controversy that President Abraham Lincoln eventually settled; the President also pinned a captain's star on her at the time. In January 1863 the troops were ordered to go to Aquia Creek, Virginia, and of course Agnes followed her husband. Here she made a bet that she would give President Lincoln three kisses within the next few days on his visit to the camp, and she succeeded in doing so.This apparently caused some marital discord between the Lincolns, however; Mary Todd Lincoln, a jealous woman, did not like the idea of her husband being kissed on both cheeks and the lips by a hoydenish girl. According to his aides, they were heard arguing about it later in the evening, although Mrs. Lincoln eventually forgave him.

Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2001. . pp. 467-468 and both Agnes and himself embarked for Mexico in February, 1866. When they arrived in Mexico City, the French troops under François Achille Bazaine were leaving, as mounting diplomatic pressure from the United States persuaded Napoleon III to conclude his Mexican venture. Hence, the couple knowingly embarked on a risky enterprise, joining the weakened and unpopular imperial army.encyclopedia Britannica, Mexico: French intervention Ocaranza's painting of Agnes Salm-Salm plea for the life of Maximilian In early February 1867 the Republican troops supporting the regime of President Benito Juárez forced Maximilian to retreat to the city of Querétaro and subsequently besieged the city. Simultaneously, the imperial reinforcements that were expected to break the siege were themselves being besieged in Puebla by the republican troops commanded by General Porfirio Díaz and Maximilian was forced to surrender. Despite last minute efforts by Felix Salm-Salm and a company of Hussars to rescue him, Maximilian was made prisoner on May 15 and a court martial sentenced him to death. Agnes made great efforts to spare the life of Maximilian and her husband, traveling several times from Querétaro to Mexico City and San Luis Potosí where she held interviews with President Benito Juárez, General Mariano Escobedo, General Porfirio Díaz and several other prominent officers of the Republican Army.Henry Parkes, A History of Mexico. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1960, p. 273. . Agnes knelt and, crying, begged President Juárez to forgive the Emperor. The President's answer has become famous in Mexican history textbooks: \\"It causes me great pain, Madame, to see you like that on your knees; but even if every king and queen were in your place, I couldn't spare his life. It isn't me who takes it from him, it is the people and the law who claim his life\\". Juárez had already received telegraphs from most of the heads of the European states asking him to spare Maximilan. Upon Juárez's denial the brave woman answered, \\"Oh, if blood must be spilled, then take my life, the life of a useless woman; and spare that of a man who can still do much good in other country.\\" Juarez did offer to spare the life of her husband.Daniel Moreno.

The plan was to get Colonel Villanueva to escort the Emperor to Veracruz, but Villanueva would not go through with it without the cooperation of Colonel Palacios. A bribe was in order. Agnes had offered two promissory notes for 100,000 pesos to each of them which would be honored by Maximilian's brother, Franz Joseph. While they were in her parlor Agnes revealed the plan to Palacios, who had told her earlier that he sympathized with the Emperor. Palacios was skeptical and said he would give her his answer in the morning. Agnes agreed, believing he would go through with it, but the escape plan fell through and Maximilian was executed 19 June 1867 in Santiago de QuerétaroDonald W. Miles, Cinco de Mayo: What is Everybody Celebrating?, pp 230-32. . Felix Salm-Salm was released from custody in December 1867 and soon after, he returned to Europe, where Agnes joined him, and re-entered the Prussian Army. Franco-Prussian War When Felix went to Europe to fight again in the Prussian Army, Agnes soon joined him via New York. In 1868 they arrived in Berlin. Because of their attempts to free Maximilian, the prince was again accepted at court along with his wife. In Europe she was the star of all the social circles in the capital as well as in Karlsruhe where she lived. During the war she continued to travel along with her husband and served among the medical staff. She was awarded the Cross of Merit for Women and Girls for army relief work. Later years Grave marker of the Princess, in the Old cemetery in Bonn On August 18, 1870, Felix Salm-Salm was killed in combat at Saint-Privat-la-Montagne during the Battle of Gravelotte. Afterward, his widow remained an active seeker for justice in the world, collecting funds for military hospitals. She lived for several years in Switzerland and Italy, part of the time with friends the Baron and Baroness von Stein. In 1876 she remarried the British diplomat, Charles Heneage, but this marriage was dissolved.

In USA he worked at first for the Westinghouse Research Labs in Pittsburgh where he focused on the theoretical physics modeling of the cell division and the mathematics of cell fission, a subject that was anecdotally said to have attracted fission-related defense interests. He was awarded a Rockefeller Fellowship in 1934 and went to the University of Chicago to take up the appointment of assistant professor in the Department of Physiology. In 1938, inspired by reading On Growth and Form (1917) by D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson, he made his first major contribution by publishing his first book on Mathematical Biophysics, and then in 1939 he also founded the first mathematical biology international journal entitled The Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics (BMB); these two essential contributions founded the field of mathematical biology, with the BMB journal serving as the focus of contributing mathematical biologists over the last 70 years. =Major scientific contributions= In 1938 he published one of the first books on mathematical biology and mathematical biophysics entitled: \\"Mathematical Biophysics: Physico-Mathematical Foundations of Biology.\\" This fundamental book was eventually published in three revised editions, the last revision appearing in two volumes in 1960. It was followed in 1940 by \\"Advances and applications of mathematical biology.\\", and in 1947 by \\"Mathematical theory of human relations\\", an approach to a mathematical model of society. In the same year he established the World' s first PhD program in Mathematical Biology at the University of Chicago. In the early 1930s, Rashevsky developed the first model of neural networks. This was paraphrased in a Boolean context by his student Walter Pitts together with Warren McCulloch, in an article published in Rashevsky's Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics in 1943.McCulloch, W.S., and W. Pitts (1943) A logical calculus of the ideas immanent in nervous activity. Bull. Math. Biophys. 5, 115-133. The Pitts-McCulloch article subsequently became extremely influential for research on artificial intelligence and artificial neural networks.Rosen, Robert (2000) Essays on Life Itself. New York: Columbia University Press, pp. 120-1. His later efforts focused on the topology of biological systems, the formulation of fundamental principles in biology, relational biology, set theory and propositional logic formulation of the hierarchical organization of organisms and human societies. Nicolas Rashevsk's biography In the second half of the 1960s, he introduced the concept of \\"organismic sets\\" that provided a unified framework for physics, biology and sociology. This was subsequently developed by other authorsPlanet Math page through applications of category theory to relational biology, Abstract Relational Biology and Category Theory Representations of Functional Organisms and Societies organismic supercategories and Complex Systems Biology.http://planetphysics.org/encyclopedia/OrganismicSupercategoriesAndSuperComplexSystemBiodynamics.html Organismic Supercategories and Complex Systems Biology =Rashevsky's most notable students= Some of Rashevsky's most outstanding PhD students who earned their doctorate under his supervision were: George Karreman, Herbert Daniel Landahl, Clyde Coombs, Robert Rosen and Anatol Rapoport. In 1948, Anatol Rapoport took over Rashevsky's course in mathematical biology, so that Rashevsky could teach mathematical sociology instead. =Administrative and political obstacles= However, his more advanced ideas and abstract relational biology concepts found little support in the beginning amongst practicing experimental or molecular biologists, although current developments in complex systems biology clearly follow in his footsteps. In 1954 the budget for his Committee of Mathematical Biology was drastically cut; however, this was at least in part politically imposed, rather than scientifically, motivated. Thus, the subsequent University of Chicago administration—notably represented by the genetics Nobel laureate George Wells Beadle— who reversed in the 1960s the previous position and quadrupled the financial support for Rashevsky's Committee for Mathematical Biology research activities (\\"Reminiscences of Nicolas Rashevsky.\\" by Robert Rosen, written in late 1972). There was later however a fall out between the retiring Nicolas Rashevsky and the University of Chicago president over the successor to the Chair of the Committee of Mathematical Biology; Nicolas Rashevsky strongly supported Dr. Herbert Landahl-his first PhD student to graduate in Mathematical Biophysics, whereas the president wished to appoint a certain US biostatistician. The result was Rashevsky's move to the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and his taking ownership of the well-funded \\"Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics\\". =Formation of Mathematical Biology, Inc.= He also formed in 1969 a non-profit organization, \\"Mathematical Biology, Incorporated\\", which was to be the precursor of \\"The Society for Mathematical Biology\\", with the purpose of \\"dissemination of information regarding Mathematical Biology\\". In his later years, after 1968, he became again very active in relational biology and held, as well as Chaired, in 1970 the first international \\"Symposium of Mathematical Biology\\" at Toledo, Ohio, in USA with the help of his former PhD student, Dr. Anthony Bartholomay, who has become the Chairman of the first Department of Mathematical Medicine at Ohio University. The meeting was sponsored by Mathematical Biology, Inc. =Final quest for principles of biology= Rashevsky was greatly influenced and inspired both by Herbert Spencer's book on the Principles of Biology (1898), and also by J. H. Woodger \`axiomatic (Mendelian) genetics', to launch his own search and quest for biological principles, and also to formulate mathematically precise principles and axioms of biology. He then developed his own highly original approach to address the fundamental question of What is Life? that another theoretical physicist, Erwin Schrödinger, had asked before him from the narrower viewpoint of quantum theory in biology. He wished to reach this \`holy grail' of (theoretical/ mathematical) biology, but his heavy work load during the late 1960s—despite his related health problems—took its toll, and finally prevented him in 1972 from reaching his ultimate goal. Rashevsky's relational approach represents a radical departure from reductionistic approaches, and it has greatly influenced the work of his student Robert Rosen. Biography In 1917, Nicolas Rashevsky joins the White Russian Navy and in 1920 he and his wife, Countess Emily had to flee for their lives to Constantinople where he taught at the American College. In 1921 they moved to Prague where he taught both special and general relativity. From Prague, he moved in the 1930s to Paris, France, and then to New York, Pittsburgh and Chicago, USA. His life has been dedicated to the science that he founded, Mathematical Biology, and his wife Emily was very supportive and appreciative of his scientific efforts, accompanying him at the scientific meetings that he either initiated or attended. He cut a tall, impressive figure with a slight Russian accent, but a clear voice and thought to the very day when in 1972 he died from a heart attack caused by coronary heart disease. His generosity was very well known and is often recognized in print by former associates or visitors. As the Chief Editor of BMB he had a declared policy of helping the authors to optimize their presentation of submitted papers, as well as proving many valuable suggestions to the submitting authors. His suggested detailed changes, additions and further developments were like a real \`gold mine' for the submitting authors. He managed to stay aloof of all science \`politics' most of the time, even in very adverse circumstances such as those during the McCarthy era when completely unfounded political accusations were made about one or two members of his close research group. Not unlike another American theoretical physicist Robert Oppenheimer, he then had much to lose for his loyal support of the wrongly accused researcher in his group.

Early years Kidder's ancestors came to America before the American Revolution. He was born in New York City, New York in 1830, and moved in 1840 to Syracuse, New York with his parents. Kidder attended Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1846-47, but did not graduate. Career Kidder began his engineering career in 1849. For several years, until 1860, he was a city engineer in Syracuse. In 1861, he headed west for Government service, becoming an officer of the Nevada Territorial Legislature in which he surveyed the boundary from Lake Bigler to Honey Lake, followed by a survey south of Lake Bigler the following year.Davis (1913), p. 208 On July 8, 1862, the Governor appointed Kidder as Surveyor of Esmeralda County, Nevada. In 1863, the Houghton-Ives Commission hired Kidder to survey the California/Nevada state line with Kidder representing the interests of California.Davis (1913), p. 209 The following year, on April 4, he was appointed County Surveyor of Nye County, Nevada, a position he held until September when an elected official took over the position. He moved to El Dorado County, California in 1864, remaining for four years. While there, he served as a Member of California's 15th State Assembly district during the period of 1865-1867. After El Dorado County, he lived jointly in Sacramento and Nevada until 1868 when he moved to Oregon, and in 1871, he moved to Washington Territory. From 1873-1875, he lived in Solano County, California and Monterey County, California, and in 1875, moved to Grass Valley, California. Kidder took over as building engineer of the Oregon and California Railroad, completing it on Christmas Eve, 1869. He also supervised the building of a portion of the Central Pacific Railway, and served as the Central Pacific's location engineer. In 1874, he was the building engineer on the Monterey and Salinas Valley Rail Road, the first narrow gauge railway in California. Later in the same year, he became chief engineer to construct the NCNGRR from Nevada City, California, through Grass Valley, to Colfax, California where it connected with the Central Pacific Railway. Construction was completed in 1876 and Kidder became the railroad's General Superintendent by 1877. He went on to become the railroad's President in 1884, along with Secretary, Treasurer, and made his family the Board of Directors. He owned four mines, and was a multi-millionaire. Later years Kidder, a Republican, was involved in State and County Central Committees. He was a delegate to the 1892 Republican National Convention, where he cast the only vote for Ohio's William McKinley, the Permanent Chair of the convention. Governor Robert Waterman appointed Kidder to the position of Yosemite Valley Commissioner. In 1893, Kidder was appointed State Debris Commissioner by the California State Mining Bureau, a position he held until his death. Though Kidder became the first Exalted Ruler of the Grass Valley Elks Club in 1900, he continued his membership in Syracuse's Masonic Lodge even after leaving 40 years earlier. In April 1901, suffering from diabetes, Kidder died at his home in Grass Valley. His wife Sarah Kidder succeeded him as President of the NNGRR, becoming the first female railroad president in the world. Family Kidder married Sarah A. Clark of Ohio in 1874. From 1875, they lived on Bennett Street in Grass Valley where he collected paintings and a large collection of books. He had a family orchard across from the Grass Valley train depot where he grew a variety of produce. Kidder and his wife had one adopted daughter, Beatrice, who married Howard Ridgely Ward in Grass Valley in 1905. The Wards had two children both daughters, Elizabeth K.

It is counted by the Chinese as among the unequal treaties in the aftermath of the Second Opium War. The treaty gave Portugal perpetual colonial rights to Macau on the condition that Portugal would cooperate in efforts to end the smuggling of opium.  Background  On 13 August 1862, China and Portugal signed the Treaty of Friendship and Trade in Tientsin (Tianjin). The treaty was largely a trade agreement but it also defined Macau's political and juridical statue, although it did not directly mention the issue of Portuguese sovereignty.Mendes, Carmen Amado (2013). Portugal, China and the Macau Negotiations, 1986-1999. Hong Kong University Press. pp. 11–12. . It contained two clauses regarding Macau's status: Article II annulled earlier agreements and referred to Macau as \\"formerly in the Province of Canton\\", while Article III recognised the status of a \\"Governor General of Macao\\". However, China did not ratify the treaty and it became void in 1864.Ride, Lindsay; Ride, May (1989). The Voices of Macao Stones. Hong Kong University Press. pp. 54–56. . In June 1886, a joint Sino-British commission advised that the administrative responsibility for controlling the import of opium into China should be transferred from the Hoppo in Canton (Guangzhou) to the Chinese Imperial Maritime Customs Service. Although Britain and China agreed to this, it could not be fully successful without Portuguese involvement. In 1887, China sent a diplomatic mission to Lisbon, which included James Campbell, a senior British member of the service, representing the superintendent of the customs service Sir Robert Hart. On 26 March 1887, Campbell and Portuguese Foreign Minister Henrique de Barros Gomes signed the four-point Lisbon Protocol:Mayers, William Frederick (1902). Treaties Between the Empire of China and Foreign Powers (4th ed.). Shanghai: North-China Herald. pp. 156–157. > Art. 1st.—A Treaty of friendship and commerce with the most favoured nation > clause will be concluded and signed at Peking. Art. 2nd.—China confirms > perpetual occupation and government of Macao and its dependencies by > Portugal, as any other Portuguese possession. Art. 3rd.—Portugal engages > never to alienate Macao and its dependencies without agreement with China. > Art. 4th.—Portugal engages to co-operate in opium revenue work at Macao in > the same way as England at Hong Kong.  Terms  Portugal followed up on this agreement by sending an envoy to Peking (Beijing), where a treaty of amity and commerce based on the protocol was drawn up. On 1 December 1887, the Treaty of Peking was signed by Chinese representatives Prince Ch'ing and Sun Iu-uen, and Tomas de Sousa Rosa for Portugal on 1 December 1887. It contained 54 articles and was ratified on 28 April 1888. Articles II and III stated: > II. China confirms, in its entirety, the second Article of the Protocol of > Lisbon, relating to the perpetual occupation and government of Macao by > Portugal. III. Portugal confirms, in its entirety, the third Article of the > Protocol of Lisbon, relating to the engagement never to alienate Macao > without previous agreement with China. According to the Portuguese interpretation, sovereignty over Macau was surrendered to Portugal. In the Chinese interpretation, only administrative rights were transferred.  Aftermath  After December 1887, issues related to rent payments and the presence of a Chinese custom house or resident mandarin in Macau became irrelevant outside of academic interest. The early 20th century marked a new era for both countries, with Portugal's 1910 and China's 1911 republican revolutions establishing new governments. A growing nationalist movement in China voiced disapproval of the treaty and questioned its validity. These contentions manifested themselves in the unresolved topic of Macau's border demarcation. Although the Nationalist (Kuomintang) government in China vowed to abrogate the \\"unequal treaties\\", Macau's status remained unchanged. The 1928 Sino-Portuguese Treaty of Friendship and Trade reaffirmed Portuguese administration over Macau.Chan, Ming K. (2003). \\"Different Roads to Home: the retrocession of Hong Kong and Macau to Chinese sovereignty\\". Journal of Contemporary China 12 (36): 497–499. In 1945, after the end of extraterritorial rights in China, the Nationalists called for the liquidation of foreign control over Hong Kong and Macau, but they were too preoccupied in the Chinese Civil War with the Communists to fulfil their goals of a \\"rights recovery\\" campaign.Cohen, Jerome Alan; Chiu, Hungdah (1974). People's China and International Law: A Documentary Study. Vol. 1. Princeton University Press. p. 374. . After the 1974 Revolution in Portugal, a new decolonisation policy paved the way for Macau's retrocession to the People's Republic of China (PRC). Portugal offered to withdraw from Macau in late 1974, but China declined the offer in favour of a later time because it sought to preserve international and local confidence in Hong Kong, which was still under British rule, and also because it prioritised the reunification of Taiwan. In January 1975, Portugal recognised the PRC as the sole legitimate government of China and ended ties with the Nationalists in Taipei. In 1976, Portugal unilaterally changed the legal designation of Macau from a \\"colony\\" to \\"territory under Portuguese administration\\".Chan, Ming K.; Chan, Shiu-hing Lo (2006).

The Merlion is a mythical creature with a lion's head and the body of a fish that is widely used as a mascot and national personification of Singapore. Two Merlion statues are located at the park. The original Merlion structure measures 8.6 meters tall and spouts water from its mouth. It has subsequently been joined by a Merlion cub, which is located near the original statue and measures just 2 metres tall. History The original Merlion Park was first designed by the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) near the mouth of the Singapore River in 1964 as an emblem of Singapore. On 15 September 1972, the park was officially opened at an installation ceremony for the statue, officiated at by then Prime Minister of Singapore, Mr Lee Kuan Yew. The original statue of the Merlion used to stand at the mouth of the Singapore River. The building of the Merlion was started in November 1971 and was completed in August 1972. It was crafted by the late Singaporean sculptor, Mr Lim Nang Seng and his 8 children. The sculpture measures 8.6 meters high and weighs 70 tons. =Relocation of Merlion= Upon the completion of the Esplanade Bridge in 1997, the original Merlion Park location was also no longer the entrance of Singapore River and the statue could no longer be viewed clearly from the Marina Bay Waterfront. On 23 April 2002, the statue was relocated to a new pier specially built on the other side of The Esplanade Bridge adjacent to The Fullerton hotel. The move, which cost $7.5 million, was completed on 25 April 2002. On 15 September 2002, then-Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew ceremonially welcome the Merlion again on its new location, the current Merlion Park, which is four times bigger than the original site. =Merlion statue damage= On 28 February 2009, between 4 pm and 5 pm, the Merlion statue was struck by lightning. Staff in the vicinity said they heard an explosion followed by a loud thud when broken pieces fell to the ground. Repairs were completed in March that year, the Merlion itself resumed spouting water on 18 March 2009. = Restoration Works = The Merlion Park and the statue went through some restoration works in 2019.

Background Born at Goodnestone, Kent, FitzWalter was the eldest son of Sir Brook William Bridges, 4th Baronet, and Eleanor, daughter of John Foote. He was educated at Winchester and Oriel College, Oxford. Political career In 1841 FitzWalter claimed the ancient barony of FitzWalter, which had been in abeyance since 1756, as a descendant of Mary, sister of Benjamin Mildmay, 17th Baron FitzWalter. However, the House of Lords decided against terminating the abeyance in his favour. In February 1852 FitzWalter was elected to the House of Commons for Kent East, but lost the seat already in July the same year. He reclaimed the seat in 1857, and held it until 1868. The latter year he was created Baron FitzWalter, of Woodham Walter in the County of Essex. Family In 1834, Lord FitzWalter married his first cousin, Fanny, daughter of Lewis Cage and Fanny Bridges of Milgate Park, Kent. They had no children. She died in October 1874. Lord FitzWalter survived her by just over a year and died at Goodnestone Park, Goodnestone, in December 1875, aged 74. The barony became extinct on his death while he was succeeded in the baronetcy by his younger brother, Reverend George Bridges. The original barony of FitzWalter was called out of abeyance in 1924 in favour of Lord FitzWalter's great-nephew, Henry Fitzwalter Plumptre (the grandson of his sister Eleanor Bridges).

It was directed by Ronald Neame and stars Robert Mitchum and Carroll Baker. The film was based on the novel of the same name by Max Catto. It was filmed on location in Kenya, at Lake Naivasha and the Amboseli National Park. Plot Beaten and expelled by African villagers for trying to cheat them, the unconscious Joe Moses drifts down a river, where he is discovered by the natives of another village. This tribe is being pressured to move by the District Officer (Ian Bannen), as their land will be flooded by the release of waters from a dam; but they refuse to leave their homes. Deeply Christian, the villagers compare Joe Moses to the real Moses due to his discovery in the reeds as was the baby Moses. With a broken leg and no money, Joe Moses is trapped in the village. Nursed to health by missionary Rev. Anderson (Alexander Knox) and his daughter Julie (Carrol Baker), Moses impresses the natives with his medicine show. He further astounds the locals when he discovers Emily, that he recognizes as an Indian elephant, in the village. Moses gets her to respond to commands in Hindustani, a language he acquired through his army service in the China Burma India theatre. The Chief (Orlando Martins) agrees to allow his people to move, but only if they are led by Moses. Reverend Anderson and Julie blackmail Moses through their knowledge of his diamond smuggling in order to lead the people to the \\"Promised Land\\". Seeing through Moses's confidence tricks is an educated African, Ubi (Raymond St. Jacques). Ubi initially wishes to team up with Moses to con other Africans, but then attempts to steal Moses's show with a concealed flame thrower that has unexpectedly disastrous consequences for Ubi. Leading the villagers from atop his elephant, Moses takes them on a journey that has many parallels with the Biblical trek, including a bit where he has to part the waters by entering the dam.

Life and work Enrique Finochietto was born in 1881 in Buenos Aires to Ana and Tomás Finochietto. His father died during his early childhood, and he was raised mostly by his mother. He excelled in industrial design while in secondary school, and enrolled at the University of Buenos Aires in 1897.Agencia el Viglia: Enrique Finochietto Finochietto interned at the university's Clinical Hospital, becoming an assistant to a noted surgeon, Dr. Alejandro Posadas. His thesis, El Pie-Bot Varus-Equino-Congénito, earned him a medical degree with honors, in 1904. He entered the Clinic of Skin and Venereal Diseases, a dependency of Buenos Aires' important Rawson Hospital, as a surgical intern. Finochietto studied nose and throat, gynecological and orthopedic surgical practices in numerous western European hospitals from 1906 to 1909 and, on his return, he was appointed chief of a surgical division at Rawson Hospital - where he lived in order to be on hand for emergencies. He returned to Europe in 1918, working during World War I in the Argentine Hospital for the Wounded in Passy, near Paris. For these efforts, he received the Legion of Honor and the Red Cross Medal, in 1919. Finochietto then traveled to the United States to observe surgical practices at the Mayo Clinic and other prominent hospitals, before returning to Argentina. The surgeon returned to Buenos Aires, where he was named the chief of the surgical division at Rawson Hospital, then undergoing an extensive enlargement and modernization. Finochietto planned the new surgical pavilion (Pavilion IX), where he worked alongside his brothers, Drs. Miguel Ángel and Ricardo Finochietto. Pavilion IX included numerous innovations of his design such as an outpatient department with separate dressing and examining rooms, separate sterile dressing packages, a narrower stretcher (that could maneuver through the halls more easily), separate departments of orthopedic surgery, endoscopy and pathology (among others), and laboratories and radiology departments in the hospital itself. He also eliminated the unwieldy book form of medical records that had existed previously, and instead created separate envelopes for patients. Dr. Finochietto not only changed the way surgical pavilions were organized and operated, he also invented many surgical instruments, having sixty-seven inventions to his credit. These included an electric surgical table which allowed a patient to be moved to any position, a special orthopedic table, a thoracic rib spreader (1936), the surgical vacuum, the \\"Finochietto scissors,\\" and a bench that allowed surgeons to operate while seated. Establishing the Surgical Graduate School of Buenos Aires, he also changed how surgery was taught and performed in Argentina. Finochietto insisted on giving students more practical experience in surgery and included instruction on proper, professional demeanor throughout a surgical procedure.Todo Argentina: Finochietto He also taught as a Clinical Professor of Surgery at the University of Buenos Aires, and became the president of the Buenos Aires Surgical Society in 1922. He developed new surgical techniques in 1924 for the treatment of the stomach, duodenum, and small intestine. Dr. Finochietto in 1929 performed the first intervention on a cardiac lesion in Argentina, successfully repairing a bullet wound to the heart of a minor. Dr. Finochietto was also an avid fan of the Tango, and he counted legendary crooner Carlos Gardel among his close friends. One of the best-known composers in the genre, Julio de Caro, composed Buen amigo (Good Friend) in his honor, in 1925. A noted academic, he published over 100 peer-reviewed papers and began work on a sixteen-volume surgical guide with his brother, Ricardo. Finochietto, who had contracted syphilis during his travels abroad, suffered from worsening health, and he accepted retirement from the university in 1933 as professor emeritus. The ailing surgeon extracted a hydatid cyst from a child in 1940 - his last surgical intervention. His condition forced him to abandon his practice and he continued writing until his death on February 17, 1948, at age 66. Bibliography * Losardo RJ et al.

It is one of the main lines of the King's Gambit after 3...g5, and its overall assessment is still unclear but approximately equal. The Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings classifies the Kieseritzky Gambit under code C39. C39 is also the code for the Allgaier Gambit, in which White plays 5.Ng5?!, sacrificing the knight for an attack after 5...h6 6.Nxf7 Kxf7. The Allgaier Gambit is considered dubious by modern theory. History The opening now known as the Kieseritzky Gambit was first described by Polerio in the late 16th century; it was also analyzed by Salvio (1604) and Philidor (1749). Greco also included a game with this opening in his 1620 collection. In the first edition of the Handbuch in 1843, 5.Ne5 was considered under the heading of the Allgaier Gambit, but the editors noted that Kieseritzky had contributed significantly to the theory of 5.Ne5, which they advocated as superior to 5.Ng5. The corresponding chapter in the second edition of the Handbuch in 1852 was headed \\"Allgaier and Kieseritzky's Gambit\\". Subsequently the name Kieseritzky Gambit came into general use for 5.Ne5.

They were inspired by the Eight Views of Xiaoxiang in China which were first painted in the 11th century and then brought to Japan as a popular theme in the 14–15th centuries. The theme was then used to describe Ōmi province in poetry by Prince Konoe Masaie and his son, Prince Hisamichi, in the 15–16th centuries. The Eight Views of Ōmi then became a popular subject for artists such as Suzuki Harunobu and Utagawa Hiroshige. The theme continued to develop, being transposed to other locations and settings in a process which the Japanese called mitate. The sights were depicted by Hiroshige in several different series of ukiyo-e pictures, as well as other artists. They are sometimes erroneously called \\"Eight Views of Lake Biwa\\", but the latter were defined to include different locations in 1949 by the government of Shiga Prefecture. The Eight Views All views are situated at the southern end of the lake. There is no fixed order. The following list circles the lake, beginning on the east side. *Returning sails at Yabase (矢橋の帰帆) - Yabase. Yabase is an old harbour on the east side of the lake. Near the Tokaido, it was used for a shortcut to Otsu by boat. In the early Meiji era steamers appeared, until the railway began its service. *Evening glow at Seta (勢多（瀬田）の夕照) - The Chinese Bridge at Seta. The long bridge across the Seta was used by the Tokaido. Nowadays is there a bridge in the old Chinese style, a concrete construction, but nice to walk over. (Today's traffic uses bridges northerly. In the background the \\"Fuji of Omi\\", the Mikamiyama. It is just above 400 m, but indeed well visible. *Autumn moon at Ishiyama (石山の秋月) - Ishiyama Temple. The Ishiyamadera was located on a hillside next to the Seta River. It got his name form the strange rocks on which it is built, partly on supporting beams. A hut at the upper end of the site allows a view of the lake, and the moon. *Clear breeze at Awazu (粟津の晴嵐) - Awazuhara. Awazu is well known for its pine wood, Awazu-ga-hara. In old pictures the castle of Zeze can be seen. It was given up in the Meiji era and was dismantled. *Evening bell at Miidera (三井晩鐘) - Mii- dera. Miidera temple was built in the 8th century. Its famous bell is one of the \\"Three bells of Japan\\", the other two being those at Byoodo-in, Uji and at Jingoji, Kyoto. *Evening rain at Karasaki (唐崎の夜雨) - Karasaki Shrine. Karasaki is a small cape with a single large pine tree, a hitsu-matsu. The pine has been replaced several times since Hiroshige's era. *Wild geese returning home at Katata (堅田の落雁) - Ukimido. Alighting geese cannot be seen always, however the little temple near Katata in the square hōkyō-style, detached from the lakeside, connected by a bridge. The first part of the name uki is the same as in Ukiyo-e, meaning floating. Midō means temple. *Evening snow at Hira (比良の暮雪) - Hira Mountains. The Hira mountains on the west side of the lake experience the hard winter, when the winter monsoon brings much snow from the continent.  Other Eight views Hiroshige alone produced nearly 20 different series \\"Omi hakkei\\". Other artists followed. To please everybody, \\"Eight views of\\" were created for many parts of Japan, e.g. using surroundings of Edo.

The actress successfully auditioned for the role and relocated to Melbourne for filming. She made her first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 15 May 2009. Kate was introduced along with her siblings Harry (Will Moore) and Sophie (Kaiya Jones) as a new generation of the Ramsay family. Her storylines have included dealing with the death of her mother, becoming the legal guardian of her siblings, her relationships with Declan Napier (James Sorensen) and Mark Brennan (Scott McGregor) and kissing a student. For her portrayal of Kate, Brewer earned a nomination for Most Popular New Female Talent at the 2010 Logie Awards. In November 2013, it was announced Brewer had quit Neighbours and Kate was killed off during the episode broadcast on 8 April 2014. Creation and casting In February 2009, a reporter for Channel 5 announced Neighbours were introducing a new generation of the Ramsay family to the show. At the time of the casting announcement, the Ramsays had not appeared in Neighbours for over a decade. Executive producer Susan Bower said the introduction of the new Ramsay family members was based on the American drama series Party of Five. Bower explained \\"We have three orphans, basically. That, as you can imagine, has a tremendous amount of story material with it and they're fabulous! Wait until you see this cast. They just clicked\\". Bower introduced the new characters despite the show receiving criticism because they did not have a nuclear or \\"normal\\" family. Brisbane actress Ashleigh Brewer arrived in Melbourne the week after graduating from her school to scout around casting agents and look for acting work. While she was in the city, Brewer successfully auditioned for an ongoing role in Neighbours as Kate Ramsay, the eldest member of the new Ramsay family. Brewer told the official Neighbours website getting the part of Kate was \\"beyond any expectations\\" and a dream come true. The actress relocated to Melbourne for filming and she made her debut as Kate on 15 May 2009. Brewer's on screen siblings, Harry (Will Moore) and Sophie (Kaiya Jones) followed shortly after. Of her character, Brewer said \\"I almost feel like viewers know Kate already because of the Ramsay history which makes playing her even more exciting.\\" In December 2011, a reporter from the Herald Sun reported Brewer had signed a new contract to stay with Neighbours until March 2013. On 19 July 2013, Brewer celebrated filming 1000 episodes. DevelopmentCharacterisation= Kate's early scenes saw her dealing with her mother, Jill's (Perri Cummings), death in a car accident. Brewer told Jason Herbison of Inside Soap that following Jill's death Kate was \\"extremely distressed, upset and confused\\", making it hard for her to care for her younger siblings. Kate was also faced with having people interfere with her life, which was difficult as she had trust issues. Brewer admitted the storyline was challenging due to the emotion required. Due to caring for her siblings, Kate develops a \\"maturity beyond her years\\" and she often put the needs of others before her own. The official Neighbours website describes Kate as \\"mature, independent and trustworthy\\", she is also a proud woman and very protective of her family. After moving into Ramsay Street, Kate began to bond with the other teenagers. Following the death of Bridget Parker (Eloise Mignon), the bonds tightened between Kate, Declan Napier (James Sorensen) and Donna Freedman (Margot Robbie). Donna often turned to Kate for help with her fashion business. Channel 5's Holy Soap website said Kate has a natural talent for dancing. She gave up her hobby a couple of years before her mother died, but after encouragement from her brother, she began dancing again. Kate was later involved in a storyline, which saw her dance for Jason Coleman at his Ministry Of Dance. She has also been tasked with organising the Deb Ball, which she decided to make environmentally friendly. This caused her to clash with Amanda Fowler (Bella Heathcote), her enemy in and out of school. Kate has been called too serious by her younger sister and has been advised to \\"stop carrying the weight of the world on her shoulders\\" and have some fun with her life. When she was asked how Kate has changed as a character, Brewer told Channel 5 \\"She is still very responsible and I think she'll always be like that. She is definitely more confident and doesn't shy aware from standing up for herself to family members or her friends.\\" Brewer opined Kate does have a sense of fun, despite going through so much in her life. =Relationship with Declan Napier= In late 2009, the character became the centre of disapproval from viewers, who felt fellow character Declan Napier (James Sorensen) was moving on too fast after his wife's death when he developed feelings for Kate. Sorensen then backed the storyline, insisting the storyline with Kate was a good thing, stating: \\"It's a difficult situation. Declan was truly in love with Bridget. He was one of the lucky ones to have found his soulmate early in life, but at the same time, he has to move on and live his life.\\" further adding: \\"A lot of people do think it's too soon for another relationship. But I can assure you that it's done very tastefully.\\" He then added an explanation for how Kate directly affected his character, adding: \\"He feels as though he's cheated on Bridget and that he hasn't mourned for long enough to be able to move on without showing proper respect to the love of his life. He's left confused and upset\\". As scenes from the storyline began to air Brewer defended her character and made comment on the storyline, reassuring viewers adding: \\"I think they'll be okay with it... I think they'll be accepting. It's done very tastefully and very slowly. The two characters don't rush anything\\". Kate was then portrayed as troubled after Declan felt he could not forget Bridget (Eloise Mignon), putting their romance in jeopardy. Of this Sorensen praised his and Brewer's storyline, explaining \\"I'm glad that, some months down the track, all wasn't forgotten. It's such a sad situation. Declan really does like Kate and she feels the same way about him. But his heart won't let him move on\\". After the couple began dating it attracted a bigger mixed response from viewers, many felt it was still too soon after Bridget. Some viewers still refused to accept Kate's new romance, prompting Sorenson to defend Kate and Declan for a final time. The storyline then carried on progressing and viewers saw the two characters grow closer until they started a relationship, despite the mixed response received from fans of Declan and Bridget. In August 2010, Declan and Kate's relationship ended when Kate chose to break up with him after he began pushing her away. Declan starts a new job and he later lies to his family in front of her. Erin Mullally (who took over the role of Declan in May 2010) said \\"Declan's been pushing Kate away, he has so much going on in his life. He's holding on to these massive pieces of information that he feels he can't share with anyone – not even Kate.\\" When Kate sees Declan lying to his mother, she believes that he is not the boy she fell for and does not know if she can trust him. Mullally said that Declan is not prepared for the moment Kate breaks up with him and he is confused. Declan goes to Ringo Brown's (Sam Clark) bucks night where he meets Kate's rival, Candace (Sheona Urquhart), who makes it clear that she is attracted to him. Declan and Candace later share a kiss, which Kate sees. Mullally said \\"Candace gets talking to Declan and is there for him, he wants comfort and makes that split-second decision to kiss her. He doesn't think about the consequences\\". Declan does not know Kate saw them together and Mullally added that he hoped they could move on as they \\"really do work as a couple\\". =Relationship with Mark Brennan= Scott McGregor played Kate's second love interest, Mark Brennan. In November 2010, Brewer revealed that Kate was to find a new romance with an existing character. Brewer said \\"Declan and Kate are pretty much dead and gone. There's a new relationship in the works that you're about to see, which is really fun and exciting\\". She also branded the new relationship a \\"refreshing change for Kate\\", stating that she is usually the person doing the looking after and she needs to be with someone who can look after her. Jackie Brygel from TV Week revealed that Kate's new love interest would be Mark Brennan (Scott McGregor). When he asks Kate out, she initially turns him down. However, when he rescues her from lawyers Toadfish Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney) and Samantha Fitzgerald (Simone Buchanan), she changes her mind. Brewer thought that Kate was ready to move on from Declan, even though Kate herself does not want to. Brewer quipped that it was about time Kate had a new man. During the date with Mark, Declan appears and Kate is furious to think he still has a hold on her life. Kate's new romance enabled her to let go of her responsibilities a little and Brewer was happy with the development, saying \\"She's really happy in this new relationship and the audience is going to see a new side to Kate. She lets go a bit and starts acting a bit younger, which I was really hoping for!\\". Kate and Mark's romance moves into \\"top gear\\" when they share a kiss in front of Mark's colleagues outside the police station. Brewer said that it had taken Kate a \\"little while\\" to realise that she wanted to make things work with Mark because of the unfinished business with Declan. However, all of Kate's feelings for Declan had gone after becoming aware of the negativity surrounding him. Declan tries to cause problems for Kate by lying about Mark threatening and hurting him, which she initially believes. Kate then has to work to get Mark back. Brewer believed the Kate and Mark's relationship would be long-term and she admitted that she wanted to see where it goes. Kate and Mark break up after Kate confesses to lying in a police statement. Brewer thought that they both want to get back together, but they are not able to move on from the things that are keeping them apart. She explained that they both have history, like the lie Kate told to protect Rebecca and Mark's one- night stand, which hurt Kate, and this prevents them from moving forward. The actress believed Mark was \\"the one\\" for Kate and added \\"She is trying to deal with the break-up and I don't think in her mind or his that they truly believe this is forever. They just need a bit of time to sort out their issues\\". McGregor announced his departure from Neighbours in February 2011. Mark's exit storyline saw him leave for witness protection, after he is stalked. Mark does not want to leave Kate behind and tries to convince her to pack up her life and go with him. Kate then has just thirty minutes to make up her mind. Brewer told a Channel 5 reporter that Kate decides to go with her instincts and chooses to go with Mark. Of her choice, Brewer said \\"Kate makes decisions very quickly. She didn't have time to think about the consequences; that was just something she would have to deal with at a later date\\". When asked what the deciding factor is for Kate, Brewer explained that it felt right to her and she knows how much she loves Mark. Kate has to convince Sophie to leave with her and Brewer thought it was not fair of Kate to expect her sister to make such a huge decision so quickly. The episode unfolded in real time and was filmed over two nights. Brewer said the biggest challenge during filming was the bad weather during the night shoot. The actress admitted that it was \\"incredibly stressful and exhausting, but the final result was worth it.\\" Kate does not leave with Mark and she struggles with knowing that he is gone for good. In November 2012, it was announced that McGregor would be returning as Mark in May 2013. Executive producer Richard Jasek stated that Mark would return during an eclipse and Kate would be left questioning whether she had really seen him. In April 2013, Brewer revealed that Mark's return scenes had to be filmed within one week because McGregor was only in the country for a brief time. Brewer told a Press Association reporter that Kate would be \\"torn\\" when Mark returns. She had believed that he had died while he was in witness protection and Brewer admitted that she was also surprised to learn Mark was coming back. She said \\"So Kate had cried her eyes out for months, and then I had this meeting and they said 'We're bringing him back.' and I was like 'So that was all for nothing?!'\\" The actress added that her character would have to make a decision as she had finally moved on with somebody else. =One- night stand= Kate has a one-night stand with Rhys Lawson (Ben Barber) in July 2011. Brewer told Inside Soap Kate is lonely and missing Mark, so she wants to do something to get out of the low place she is in. Kate meets Rhys at Charlie's bar and following a \\"big night out\\", she wakes up in his apartment. Of this, Brewer explained \\"You don't actually see the lead-up – one minute she meets Rhys in a bar, the next minute we see that they've already slept together!\\" Kate is ashamed of her behavior and the situation is made worse when she is unable to remember Rhys' name. Brewer said Kate feels awkward about the whole thing and starts to freak out as she wonders why she went out and did what she did. When Kate and Rhys meet again, they have different attitudes to their one-night stand. Brewer opined Rhys is a \\"bit of a player\\", so it is not a big deal to him, but Kate is uncomfortable and tries to cover her tracks. Inside Soap said viewers would be surprised by the development and Brewer admitted to having some misgivings about the storyline, as she thought it was too soon for Kate to be pursuing someone else. However, the actress said she understood Kate trying to move on from Mark. Brewer later told Channel 5 that Kate's fling with Rhys was a release from everything that has been happening in her life up to that point. Kate is punished for her actions when Michelle Tran (HaiHa Le) confronts her about Rhys. Kate is shocked as she barely knows Michelle and the confrontation takes place in public at Harold's Store. Michelle accuses Kate of having sex with Rhys to hurt her housemate, Kyle Canning (Chris Milligan). Kate does not know how to respond and when Kyle learns what happened, he is mortified. Brewer said \\"In Michelle's crazy mind, she was doing the honorable thing by sticking up for Kyle.\\" Kate realises something is not quite right with Michelle and knows to steer clear of her in the future. The actress added if Kate could go back in time, she would not go near Rhys. However, she can only put the matter behind her and move on. In November 2011, Brewer said it would be interesting to revisit the relationship between Kate and Rhys. =Noah Parkin= In July 2011, Orpheus Pledger joined the cast as Noah Parkin, a student who enrols at Erinsborough High. Noah befriends Kate's sister, Sophie, as they are both into music and enjoy playing the guitar. Sophie develops a crush on Noah, but he does not notice as he has taken a shine to Kate. Pledger explained \\"Noah doesn't realise Sophie's got the hots for him and he falls for Kate. He thinks Kate's beautiful and always wants to be around her. He thinks he's got a shot because she's really nice to him - but he takes her friendly gestures the wrong way.\\" The actor later expanded on this saying Kate is one of a few people who was nice to him from the start. Kate did not judge him and Noah takes her natural friendliness for something more than it is. Andrew Robinson (Jordan Smith) is the first to realise Noah has a crush on Kate and he warns her about it. Brewer said Kate is hesitant about giving Noah the wrong idea and she suggests she should stop tutoring him. However, Noah denies having a crush on her and implies he is actually in love with Summer Hoyland (Jordy Lucas). Kate accepts this and is unaware of what Noah is really thinking. When asked if Noah's feelings for Kate come between her and her sister, Brewer explained \\"While Kate isn't aware that Noah has feelings for her, it doesn't really impact on she and Sophie. She's just conscious of her little sister getting hurt\\". Kate learns Mark is dead and she struggles with the news and her grief. Brewer told Inside Soap that Kate goes into shock as she thought there was a small chance she could be with Mark if he came out of witness protection. Kate goes to the local History Wall project, where she meets Noah. Brewer said \\"Kate feels lost and alone, and needs to tell someone how she feels. She lets her guard down, and Noah's there for her.\\" In the moment, Kate kisses Noah and Brewer said it could have happened with anyone. Kate regrets her actions, especially when Noah gives her a gift as he is convinced she reciprocates his feelings. Brewer said Kate had no idea Noah felt that way about her as she thought he liked Summer. She tries to make him understand he has the wrong impression, but Noah does not listen. Brewer explained everything in Kate's life is at risk if the kiss is ever revealed. When Sophie decides to drop out of Noah's band, Kate hopes Noah will leave her alone. However, Noah does not get the message and when he tries to get Kate to admit her feelings for him, she calls him a stalker. A TV Soap writer said Noah is \\"shattered\\" and he then reveals their kiss to everyone. When Noah learns Kate's teaching career could be over, he admits to lying to get her into trouble. Andrew later finds Sophie tearing into Noah for trying to ruin her sister's career and he tells her Kate did kiss Noah. Sophie then tells Priya Kapoor (Menik Gooneratne), the acting principal of Erinsborough High, that Noah was not lying and Kate's teaching career is placed in jeopardy. Kate appears before Priya at a hearing to decide what course of action should be taken. Kate chooses not to reveal the reason behind her kiss with Noah was her grief at Mark's death. Lincoln Lewis joined the cast as Dominic Emmerson. =Port Douglas= Following the Noah incident and the temporary loss of her job, Kate decides to \\"kick-start her life\\" and spend some time away from Erinsborough. Brewer told Colin Vickery from The Advertiser that Kate had been through \\"a lot of heartache\\" and she needed the break to find herself again. Brewer commented \\"After the year she has just had with her boyfriend dying, and then kissing Noah and losing her career, she's fed up and not going to take it any more, so she sets about making some radical changes which will have a huge impact on the direction of her life.\\" Kate decides to go to Port Douglas in Queensland and the cast and crew filmed on location in the state. Brewer said she had a fantastic time and enjoyed seeing Kate letting her guard down. Lincoln Lewis joined the cast as Kate's love interest Dominic Emmerson, a marine biologist. Brewer and Lewis previously worked together on The Sleepover Club. Kate first encounters Dominic when she loses her phone on the beach, which Dominic finds. Kate is initially suspicious of \\"smooth-talking\\" Dominic, but she slowly comes round to him and they have a holiday romance. Brewer stated that she loved the storyline because as well as the Kate and Dominic romance, there was also Paul Robinson's (Stefan Dennis) attempt to drag Kate back to Erinsborough and the life she thought she had escaped from. When asked what was coming up for Kate, Brewer explained \\"She is lost and trying to find herself, and it's not going to be an easy path for her, lots more ups and downs to come, and the people around her may have to adjust to the new Kate. And she has new hair!\\" =Departure= On 11 November 2013, it was announced that Brewer had quit Neighbours, so she could pursue new acting projects. The actress stated \\"Having now been on Neighbours for over five years, I really feel like I've done my character justice and the time is right to close this chapter and open the next exciting one. I'm incredibly grateful for the time I've spent on Neighbours and now I'm ready to challenge myself in a new and different ways. I also want to do more travelling, something I haven't been able to do.\\" Brewer filmed her final scenes in December 2013. Details of Kate's final storyline were released in March 2014. Kate is shot shortly after accepting Mark's marriage proposal. Her life is \\"left hanging in the balance\\", as she collapses into Mark's arms, before she dies from her injuries. Brewer's final scenes aired on 8 April 2014. The actress later admitted that she loved her exit storyline and was \\"overwhelmed\\" by the effort the writers had put into it. The episodes following Kate's death focused on the search for the person who shot her. Stephen Montague (Damian Hill) and Mark's ex-girlfriend Sienna Matthews (Sarah Roberts) emerged as suspects. During his appearance on This Morning, Dennis said the shooter was seen in the episode. He also thought the whodunnit was \\"really cleaver\\" and said it would be dragged out for a while. He added \\"it takes a long time and everybody's under suspicion.\\" It later emerged that Kate was shot by Victor Cleary (Richard Sutherland) in retaliation for Paul killing his brother Gus Cleary (Ben Barrack) in 2004. Storylines Kate and her siblings are nieces and nephew of Paul Robinson and they are devastated when their mother dies following a hit-and-run accident. They initially refuse to accept any help, but Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne) eventually convinces Kate to move into Number 24 Ramsay Street, which is owned by the Salvation Army. Kate finds employment at Harold's Store and enrols at Erinsborough High, where she befriends Donna Freedman, Declan Napier and Bridget Parker (Eloise Mignon). Kate is bullied by Amanda Fowler, especially when she is tasked with organising the Debutante Ball. It emerges that Kate was a talented dancer before her mother's death and Harry pays for some dance lessons for her. Kate works hard to get into a showcase judged by Jason Coleman and she later earns a place at the Ministry of Dance. Lou Carpenter (Tom Oliver) becomes the Ramsay siblings' guardian after the DHS threatens to place them in care. Kate develops a crush on Declan, who is struggling with the death of his wife, Bridget. Declan and Kate kiss and he eventually asks her out on a date, but it does not end well. Kate gets a paid dancing job with Terry Kearney's (Peter Moon) company and fellow dancer, Candace Carey, becomes jealous of her. Kate and Declan begin dating and Kate is granted legal guardianship of Harry and Sophie when she turns 18. Kate begins a teaching course at Eden Hills University and is given a placement at Erinsborough High. Kate ends her relationship with Declan when she learns he has been lying to her and his family. After Paul Robinson is pushed from the Lassiter's Hotel mezzanine, Kate gives his wife, Rebecca (Jane Hall), a false alibi. Rebecca later confesses that she pushed Paul. Detective Mark Brennan asks Kate on a date and she accepts. Declan tries to put Kate off Mark by claiming Mark has been threatening him. Mark and Kate begin dating, but when Kate confesses to giving Rebecca a false alibi, Mark breaks up with her. They get back together when Mark tells Kate he loves her. When Mark is asked to go into witness protection, Kate agrees to go with him. Kate and Sophie are too late to meet Mark and Kate is devastated to find he has gone. She later has a one-night stand with Rhys Lawson. When Kate learns Mark has been killed, she is comforted by her student Noah Parkin and they kiss. Noah tells acting principal Priya Kapoor and Kate's relationship with Sophie deteriorates because Sophie had a crush on Noah. When Noah explains to Priya the circumstances surrounding the kiss, she decides to handle the investigation internally, but Kate quits her job. She takes off and goes to Port Douglas with Erin Salisbury (Elise Jansen). She had a brief romance with Dominic Emmerson. Dominic decides to accompany Kate to Vietnam, but Paul arrives to tell her that she needs to come home as Sophie is in danger of being taken into care. Kate reluctantly returns to Erinsborough, where she and Sophie talk through their issues. They decide to live apart. Kate realises she has feelings for Kyle and decides to fight for him, even though he is in a relationship with her friend Jade Mitchell (Gemma Pranita). She also becomes manager of Charlie's bar. When Kate discovers Lou has taken $8000 from Kyle's business account, she protects him and replaces the money. Kyle's grandmother, Sheila (Colette Mann), encourages Kate to go after him. Kate and Kyle kiss, but they both feel guilty and Kate tells Jade. Kate decides to return to teaching and she moves in with Paul and Sophie. Kate also befriends Georgia Brooks (Saskia Hampele) and is asked out by Mason Turner (Taylor Glockner). Kate turns Mason down when she learns he is only eighteen, but she later changes her mind. When Mason is arrested for attempted armed robbery, Kate ends their brief relationship. But after he visits her to explain that he only did it to protect his family, she forgives him and they have sex. Paul does not approve of Mason, so Kate moves into Number 26. Kate is surprised when she sees Mark during an eclipse. He later turns up at her house and explains that he has been allowed to leave witness protection and has been living in Sydney for the past two years. Mark asks Kate to give their relationship another chance, but Kate learns that Mark has a girlfriend in Sydney and tells him that she chooses Mason. However, Mason believes he is second best and breaks up with Kate. Kate then has a one-night stand with Kyle, but tells Mason it was with Mark. He forgives her and they get back together. Kate believes she is pregnant, but soon learns that she has premature ovarian failure. When Mason suggests that they try for a baby, Kate realises that they both want different things and she breaks up with him. Mason tries to win Kate back, but she makes it clear that they are never getting back together. Kate fails to get along with Georgia's cousin Gemma Reeves (Kathryn Beck), causing a strain on her friendship with Georgia. When Kyle and Georgia become engaged, Kate confides in Chris Pappas (James Mason) that she has fallen in love with Kyle. Unable to get over him, Kate moves in with Paul. Gem believes Kate is trying to turn Georgia against her and she gets Bailey Turner (Calen Mackenzie) to hack into Kate's email, where she discovers an unsent email from Kate to Kyle revealing the details of their one-night stand. Gem slips the email into the congratulatory messages at the engagement party, where Georgia reads it out. Georgia is devastated and ends her engagement and friendship with Kate. Georgia and Gem leave town and Bailey confesses to hacking Kate's laptop. Kate and Kyle find Georgia unconscious in a gas filled cottage and Kate saves her. Georgia is grateful, but does not want to mend their friendship. Kate admits that she is in love with Kyle and he reciprocates her feelings. They go on a couple of dates, but Kyle struggles to get over Georgia and breaks up with Kate. Mark returns to Erinsborough after helping out Mason. He decides to stay and win Kate back. Rebecca also returns and she encourages Kate to get back with Mark. When Mark learns of Kate's infertility, he declares that it does not matter and he still wants to be with her. Kate continues to push Mark away, but when she is confronted by his ex-girlfriend, Kate starts thinking about her past relationships. She realises that they failed because she was not with the right person and she admits that she loves Mark. Kate and Mark get back together, but Paul does not approve of the relationship and Kate moves out. Kate is delighted when Sophie and Zeke Kinski (Matthew Werkmeister) return to Erinsborough to help celebrate her birthday. Before her party, Kate meets Mark at Lassiter's Lake, where she accepts his marriage proposal. Shortly after telling their friends, Kate is shot in the back and she dies. Reception For her portrayal of Kate, Brewer was nominated for Most Popular New Female Talent at the 2010 Logie Awards. A writer for Holy Soap said Kate's most memorable moment was \\"Coping with the shock of losing her mother and the responsibility of becoming her siblings' guardian\\". The website also branded her a \\"plucky lass\\" and said her relationship with Declan kept viewers \\"hooked for yonks.\\" A Sunday Mail columnist thought Kate was a \\"vulnerable teen\\". A Daily Post reporter quipped \\"After her disastrous relationship with Declan, it's no wonder Kate's worried about her upcoming date with Brennan.\\" A writer for the Daily Record stated Kate has \\"always been Miss Steady\\" and someone people could rely on, so it came as a shock to see her fall apart and give in to Noah's advances. During the Noah storyline, Dianne Butler of the Herald Sun wondered if Kate was the \\"unstable one\\" as she appeared to tell a lot of lies. Butler's colleague, Cameron Adams called Kate \\"unlucky-in-love.\\" When Kate's feelings for Kyle resurfaced, Kerry Barrett from All About Soap commented \\"Oh, dear. Just what does Neighbours' Kate Ramsay think she's doing? We all know she's got a crush on Kyle. Yes, Kyle who's dating her best friend, Jade. But we thought she was getting over it, moving on. And she was. Until she saw Kyle all dressed up for the bachelor auction (we've got to admit, he looked hot!) and her passion was ignited once more. Crikey!\\" Barrett added that the whole situation was bound to end in tears and believed that Kate should back off or she would \\"live to regret it!\\" ReferencesExternal links * Kate Ramsay on the official Neighbours AU website * Kate Ramsay on the official UK Neighbours UK website Category:Neighbours characters Category:Fictional people from Victoria (Australia) Category:Fictional orphans Category:Fictional dancers Category:Fictional schoolteachers Category:Television characters introduced in 2009 Category:Fictional waiting staff Category:Fictional bartenders Category:Female characters in television ","title":"Kate Ramsay"},{"id":"22884296","text":"Teresa Jacobo was a former California politician.

Simmons is a pioneer in the field of biosonar. His research includes behavioral and neurophysiological studies of sound processing in the echolocating bat. From the time he began graduate research in the late 1960s to the present, he has been in the forefront of bat echolocation research.Au, W. W. L., and C. F. Moss. (2005) [Silver Medal] Citation for James A. Simmons. J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 118(3):1986-1989. Simmons was honored as a fellow of the Acoustical Society of America (ASA) in 1996 and of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2000. He was awarded the ASA's second Silver Medal in Animal Bioacoustics in 2005. His current position is Professor in the Department of Neuroscience, Brown University.  Education  Simmons obtained his bachelor's degree from Lafayette College in 1965 with a double major in Psychology and Chemistry. He then earned a master's degree in 1968 and a Ph.D. in Psychology in 1969 from Princeton University. Simmons's graduate research involved studies of echolocation in bats, under the mentorship of E. Glen Wever, one of the giants in physiological acoustics. At that time, acceptance of the processes underlying spatial perception by echolocation was not universal, and one of the exciting moments of his graduate training came when a skeptical Nobel Laureate, Georg von Békésy, on one of his periodic visits to Wever's lab, came to see the behaving bats in \\"Building B. The demonstration that Simmons conducted not only convinced Békésy that bats echolocated but that they also use echo delay to estimate target distance. It was not until some years later that Simmons found out that this was a set-up engineered by Wever and Donald Griffin, who was then at the Rockefeller University, to convince Békésy about the bat's extraordinary use of echolocation to determine target range. Simmons's dissertation was entitled \\"Perception of target distance by echolocating bats. After receiving his Ph.D., Simmons remained at Princeton University as a National Institutes of Health postdoctoral trainee for two years. Research Simmons continued his research on bat echolocation after he moved to Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri in 1971, as an assistant professor in the Neural Science Program that was housed in the Psychology Department. Between 1980 and 1984, he taught and conducted research as a professor in the Department of Biology and Institute of Neuroscience, University of Oregon in Eugene, Oregon. In 1984, Simmons moved to Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, where his wife Andrea had been hired as an assistant professor in the Psychology Department. Both are now professors in the Neuroscience and Psychology Departments at Brown University, respectively. Simmons developed methods for conducting psychophysical studies of sonar processing by bats, and researchers around the world have adopted these methods to address a wide range of research questions. Simmons was the first to use electronically delayed playbacks of the bat's echolocation signals to simulate target echoes for the study of perception in bats. He used such \\"phantom target echoes to measure, for the first time, target range difference discrimination thresholds of echolocating bats. Simmons studied sonar ranging performance in bats by determining the minimum difference in echo delay that an echolocating animal can discriminate. With this paradigm, Simmons estimated that bats can discriminate a range difference of approximately 1 centimeter, corresponding to an echo delay difference of approximately 60 microseconds. Simmons continued to study sonar ranging performance in echolocating bats, and in the late 1970s, he introduced a new behavioral task, requiring the bat to discriminate a sonar target returning echoes at a fixed delay from one returning echoes that alternated between two delays. In this experiment, Simmons found that the echolocating bat can discriminate a jitter in echo delay in the submicrosecond range, corresponding to a change in target distance of less than 0.1 mm. This result, originally published in 1979 in Science, \\"Perception of echo phase information in bat sonar, demonstrated astonishing ranging accuracy by the echolocating bat. Many researchers in the field challenged the report, because they asserted it was not biologically possible for the bat's sonar system to discriminate such small time differences at ultrasonic frequencies. Simmons continues to work on this problem to explore biological processes that could support sensitivity to small changes in echo delay. Through behavioral experiments, Simmons demonstrated time-varying gain in the sonar receiver of echolocating bats. The hearing sensitivity of the big brown bat decreases before each sonar pulse is emitted and then recovers in a logarithmic fashion to compensate for the two- way transmission loss of sonar returns, thereby maintaining a constant echo sensation level over a distance of about 1.5 meters. This is functionally important to the bat, as it stabilizes the bat's estimate of echo arrival time, its cue for target distance. In addition to Simmons's contributions to our understanding of perception by sonar, he has conducted neurophysiological experiments in echolocating bats. One of his manuscripts published with co- authors Albert Feng and Shelley Kick in ScienceFeng, A., J. Simmons, and S. Kick (1971). \\"Echo detection and target-ranging neurons in the auditory system of the bat, Eptesicus fuscus.\\" Science 4368:645-648. had a profound impact on the study of the neurophysiology of echolocating bats. This paper describes the response properties of auditory neurons in the bat central nervous system that show facilitated responses to pairs of sounds separated by a limited range of biologically relevant delays. These neurons exhibit the response characteristic known as \\"echo delay-tuning or \\"range-tuning, which could provide the neural substrate for target distance coding. The published report on this population of delay-tuned neurons by Simmons and colleagues preceded the first papers by Nobuo Suga and his group, who have since published widely on this topic. In the past five years, Simmons has used new methods for making thermal infrared video recordings of bats flying in natural situations. He developed a stereo video viewing system that lets him observe bats in 3D and listen to their sounds while they behave. These studies have led to new discoveries that challenge our understanding of echolocation behavior in bats.

Philip Jones is editor-in-chief of the weekly print edition of the magazine and the website. The magazine is home to the Bookseller/Diagram Prize for Oddest Title of the Year, a humorous award given annually to the book with the oddest title. The award is organised by The Bookseller's diarist, Horace Bent, and had been administered in recent years by the former deputy editor, Joel Rickett, and former charts editor, Philip Stone. We Love This Book is its quarterly sister consumer website and email newsletter. The subscription-only magazine is read by around 30,000 persons each week, in over 90 countries, and contains the latest news from the publishing and bookselling worlds, in-depth analysis, pre-publication book previews and author interviews. It is the first publication to publish official weekly bestseller lists in the UK. It has also created the first UK-based e-book sales ranking. The website is visited by 160,000 unique users each month. The magazine also produces approximately a dozen specials on an annual basis including its Books of The Year and four \\"Buyers Guides\\". The Bookseller also publishes three daily newspapers at the annual London Book Fair, in April, the Bologna Children's Book Fair and the Frankfurt Book Fair, in October.  History  The Bookseller was founded by Joseph Whitaker, the first editor of the magazine, in January 1858, and was marketed as \\"A Handbook of British and Foreign Literature\\". His sons, Joseph Vernon Whitaker and George Herbert Whitaker took over editorship of The Bookseller in 1875 and 1895 respectively, with George Herbert Whitaker taking the decision in 1909 to move the magazine from a monthly to a weekly publication. However, World War I severely disrupted publication and it was not until the late 1920s that the magazine resumed its weekly schedule. In 1928, The Bookseller entered troublesome years, with the magazine entering joint editorial control between both The Publishers Association and the Booksellers Association. It was edited by the Publishers Association president Geoffrey S. Williams and became known as The Publisher and Bookseller. However, the decision proved less than successful, and in 1933 the decision was reversed, with editorship being awarded to Edmond Segrave – 28 years old at the time. He remained in charge for almost 40 years.Nicholas Clee. 'The Whitaker Years'. The Bookseller, 20 June 2008, pp. 34–35. In 1945, he hired Philothea Thompson as his personal assistant, and when Edmond Segrave died in 1971, she took over stewardship of the magazine until 1976. David Whitaker joined his family magazine in 1977 for little over two years, with Louis Baum assuming editorial responsibilities in 1980. Under Baum, the magazine went under radical change, with numerous design changes, culminating in the decision to become a full-colour publication in the late 1990s. The self-named \\"legendary diarist\\", Horace Bent, made his first appearance during this time (although \\"his\\" Bookseller/Diagram Prize for Oddest Title of the Year began in the late 1970s), while the magazine also began to feature the first Nielsen BookScan bestseller lists. In 1999, Nicholas Clee became editor, months before the magazine was sold to a division of Nielsen Business Media. In 2004 Retail Week′s Neill Denny arrived and oversaw another major redesign, which included the controversial decision to move its \\"Publications of the Week\\" information online only.  Modern day  Following the demise of Publishing News, The Bookseller is the only paper magazine reporting on the UK publishing, bookselling and library industry on a weekly basis, although the magazine also includes frequent stories, features and columns from the international scene. Numerous famous names from the UK book trade contribute to the magazine via the opinion columns, including Kate Mosse and Anthony Horowitz, while the website provides a forum for anyone to voice their opinions on news and features concerning the trade. In 2010, The Bookseller was acquired from Nielsen by its then Managing Director, Nigel Roby. In August 2020, the magazine was purchased by the publishers of The Stage, with the two publications expected to run independently of each other.

It was first released in Mainland China in 2006. And then Ingle Games Ltd., the North American Publisher of Phoenix Dynasty Online, announced its Closed Beta on Aug 1st. The Open Beta test began on Oct 9, 2007. It was soon recognized by IGN and released its vault and granted IGN an interview. Until now the game is still under development and new contents have been added continuously. The upcoming 7400 expansion pack is scheduled for July 2009. Phoenix Dynasty Online is set in ancient China. Players can learn and practice the Chinese Kungfu to advance their character and rule the dynasty. GameplayClasses= The game features four different classes: Wizard, Assassin, Paladin, Priest, all with different sets of skills and abilities. =Crafting System= Players can choose to learn one of the four crafting skills: Blacksmithing (creates weapons), armor crafting (creates armor and boots), leather crafting (creates helmets and gauntlets), and Jewel crafting (creates necklaces and rings). The materials for crafting can be obtained by killing non-humanoid monsters. Players can also earn gold by providing crafting service to others from setting a crafting booth. =Mount System= The mount system allows players to ride a beast mount as a means of fast transportation and also provide instant buffs. Available mounts are horses, which can be bought from Horse Breeder by gold, and other beast mounts, such as bears, bulls, tigers, tortoises, quad-horns and Phoenix. There are rare mounts obtained by consuming contribution points that can be gained through Guild War. =Guild System= Players can create their own guilds by paying 100,000 gold to the guild officer. Guild leaders can assign titles and jobs to the guild members. They can use guild bulletin to deliver their message to all members. And the guild leadership can be transferred to the guild member. There are daily guild collection quests available for players to obtain contribution points. =Guild War= The guild war takes place in an area called \\"Bayer Tribes\\". There are 9 cities in this area and all of them can be occupied by guilds. All nine cities can be occupied by armed forces. Initially the cities have only a few wandering soldiers of the Bayer Tribes. After destroying the city symbol, players can occupy the city. Other guilds will challenge the guild that captures the cities at a designated time each week. The winner of the battle will then be allowed to occupy the city for a week. =Artifact System= Artifact System is newly introduced in the game's latest content expansion,Rise of Kingjow. Artifacts are rumored to be the legacies of Chinese ancient champions, and in the game they grant player characters impressive power, improving one of character attributes, including attack rate, attack force (AP), health point, mana point, defense, dodge rate and critical hitting rate. =Item Formula= The item formula is a fantastic addition to the current crafting experience. Using the item formula, player characters stand a chance of forging gears with more powerful attributes. There are two way of getting an item formula: 1. Dismantle equipment at Doctor of Sun City. 2. Loot from mobs. =Quests= The game provides over 100 quests that simulate the events which happened in the old Chinese Zhou Dynasty's four States (Zhao, Chu, Chi, Qin), Players must beat furious monsters, historical beasts, princes and kings to receive valuable rewards. =Marriage System= Phoenix Dynasty Online has a romantic marriage system. The couples will wear the traditional Chinese wedding costumes and be teleported to the specially designed wedding hall after completing the marriage quest. They can also invite their friends to their wedding ceremony. An announcement of the wedding will be made to all players in the server through system message. After that, both players will have a wife/husband title and enjoy a 5% EXP. bonus when both are online.

A model is identifiable if it is theoretically possible to learn the true values of this model's underlying parameters after obtaining an infinite number of observations from it. Mathematically, this is equivalent to saying that different values of the parameters must generate different probability distributions of the observable variables. Usually the model is identifiable only under certain technical restrictions, in which case the set of these requirements is called the identification conditions. A model that fails to be identifiable is said to be non-identifiable or unidentifiable: two or more parametrizations are observationally equivalent. In some cases, even though a model is non- identifiable, it is still possible to learn the true values of a certain subset of the model parameters. In this case we say that the model is partially identifiable. In other cases it may be possible to learn the location of the true parameter up to a certain finite region of the parameter space, in which case the model is set identifiable. Aside from strictly theoretical exploration of the model properties, identifiability can be referred to in a wider scope when a model is tested with experimental data sets, using identifiability analysis. Definition Let \\\\mathcal{P}=\\\\\\\\{P_\\\\theta:\\\\theta\\\\in\\\\Theta\\\\\\\\} be a statistical model where the parameter space \\\\Theta is either finite- or infinite-dimensional. We say that \\\\mathcal{P} is identifiable if the mapping \\\\theta\\\\mapsto P_\\\\theta is one-to- one: : P_{\\\\theta_1}=P_{\\\\theta_2} \\\\quad\\\\Rightarrow\\\\quad \\\\theta_1=\\\\theta_2 \\\\quad\\\\ \\\\text{for all } \\\\theta_1,\\\\theta_2\\\\in\\\\Theta. This definition means that distinct values of θ should correspond to distinct probability distributions: if θ1≠θ2, then also Pθ1≠Pθ2. If the distributions are defined in terms of the probability density functions (pdfs), then two pdfs should be considered distinct only if they differ on a set of non-zero measure (for example two functions ƒ1(x) = 10 ≤ x < 1 and ƒ2(x) = 10 ≤ x ≤ 1 differ only at a single point x = 1 — a set of measure zero — and thus cannot be considered as distinct pdfs). Identifiability of the model in the sense of invertibility of the map \\\\theta\\\\mapsto P_\\\\theta is equivalent to being able to learn the model's true parameter if the model can be observed indefinitely long. Indeed, if {Xt} ⊆ S is the sequence of observations from the model, then by the strong law of large numbers, : \\\\frac 1 T \\\\sum_{t=1}^T \\\\mathbf{1}_{\\\\\\\\{X_t\\\\in A\\\\\\\\}} \\\\ \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\text{a.s.}}\\\\ \\\\Pr[X_t\\\\in A], for every measurable set A ⊆ S (here 1{...} is the indicator function). Thus, with an infinite number of observations we will be able to find the true probability distribution P0 in the model, and since the identifiability condition above requires that the map \\\\theta\\\\mapsto P_\\\\theta be invertible, we will also be able to find the true value of the parameter which generated given distribution P0. ExamplesExample 1= Let \\\\mathcal{P} be the normal location-scale family: : \\\\mathcal{P} = \\\\Big\\\\\\\\{\\\\ f_\\\\theta(x) = \\\\tfrac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}\\\\sigma} e^{ -\\\\frac{1}{2\\\\sigma^2}(x-\\\\mu)^2 }\\\\ \\\\Big\\\\ \\\\theta=(\\\\mu,\\\\sigma): \\\\mu\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}, \\\\,\\\\sigma\\\\\\\\!>0 \\\\ \\\\Big\\\\\\\\}. Then : \\\\begin{align} & f_{\\\\theta_1}=f_{\\\\theta_2} \\\\[6pt] \\\\Longleftrightarrow {} & \\\\frac 1 {\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}\\\\sigma_1} \\\\exp\\\\left( -\\\\frac 1 {2\\\\sigma_1^2} (x-\\\\mu_1)^2 \\\\right) = \\\\frac 1 {\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}\\\\sigma_2} \\\\exp\\\\left( -\\\\frac 1 {2\\\\sigma_2^2}(x-\\\\mu_2)^2 \\\\right) \\\\[6pt] \\\\Longleftrightarrow {} & \\\\frac 1 {\\\\sigma_1^2}(x-\\\\mu_1)^2 + \\\\ln \\\\sigma_1 = \\\\frac 1 {\\\\sigma_2^2}(x-\\\\mu_2)^2 + \\\\ln \\\\sigma_2 \\\\[6pt] \\\\Longleftrightarrow {} & x^2 \\\\left(\\\\frac 1 {\\\\sigma_1^2}-\\\\frac 1 {\\\\sigma_2^2}\\\\right) - 2x\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\mu_1}{\\\\sigma_1^2}-\\\\frac{\\\\mu_2}{\\\\sigma_2^2} \\\\right) + \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\mu_1^2}{\\\\sigma_1^2}-\\\\frac{\\\\mu_2^2}{\\\\sigma_2^2}+\\\\ln\\\\sigma_1-\\\\ln\\\\sigma_2\\\\right) = 0 \\\\end{align} This expression is equal to zero for almost all x only when all its coefficients are equal to zero, which is only possible when σ1 = σ2 and μ1 = μ2. Since in the scale parameter σ is restricted to be greater than zero, we conclude that the model is identifiable: ƒθ1 = ƒθ2 ⇔ θ1 = θ2. =Example 2= Let \\\\mathcal{P} be the standard linear regression model: : y = \\\\beta'x + \\\\varepsilon, \\\\quad \\\\mathrm{E}[\\\\,\\\\varepsilon\\\\mid x\\\\,]=0 (where ′ denotes matrix transpose). Then the parameter β is identifiable if and only if the matrix \\\\mathrm{E}[xx'] is invertible. Thus, this is the identification condition in the model. =Example 3= Suppose \\\\mathcal{P} is the classical errors-in-variables linear model: : \\\\begin{cases} y = \\\\beta x^* + \\\\varepsilon,  x = x^* + \\\\eta, \\\\end{cases} where (ε,η,x*) are jointly normal independent random variables with zero expected value and unknown variances, and only the variables (x,y) are observed. Then this model is not identifiable, only the product βσ²∗ is (where σ²∗ is the variance of the latent regressor x*). This is also an example of a set identifiable model: although the exact value of β cannot be learned, we can guarantee that it must lie somewhere in the interval (βyx, 1÷βxy), where βyx is the coefficient in OLS regression of y on x, and βxy is the coefficient in OLS regression of x on y. If we abandon the normality assumption and require that x* were not normally distributed, retaining only the independence condition ε ⊥ η ⊥ x*, then the model becomes identifiable. Software In the case of parameter estimation in partially observed dynamical systems, the profile likelihood can be also used for structural and practical identifiability analysis. An implementation of the is available in the MATLAB Toolbox PottersWheel.

ULIS students studying Korean receive valuable scholarships from Korean corporations such as Lotte, Kumho, Samsung, Daewoo, Miwon, Keb, LG, Posco, Booyang, Sellex and others. Many partnerships have been set up through the Japanese Foundation as well. The Japanese Foundation is an arm of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and has been active with ULIS with special guests and lectures, student trips, and short training courses in Japan. Other connections with Japan include University of Kumamoto Gakuen (considered a sister university to ULIS), Daiaku, Nagaoka, Tokyo Foreign Language University, as well as several agreements with various business firms from Japan. VNU-ULIS was the first institution in Vietnam to offer degrees in Japanese Language Teacher Education. VNU-ULIS is the only institution in Vietnam to have a bachelor program in German language teacher education.ULIS Magazine, Spring, 2013. pg3. \\"ULIS Strengthens Connections with Germany\\" The joint ULIS-Southern New Hampshire University (USA) English program is one of the programs as is their intensive English studies program. When Former US President Bill Clinton spoke at Vietnam National University on November 17, 2000, he is most quoted as saying “While we can not change our past, we can change our future” and that has been seen not only with this program in the US, but with many other similar partnerships.William J. Clinton Presidential Library, Speech at Vietnam National University, Vietnam. November 17th 2000, Master Tape 12242 There are also other joint agreements where students can earn credit or a degree from various partner institutions such as the University of Picardie Jules Verne in France. Students can also spend two years at the ULIS campus and then another two years in China and receive degree credit from Shanxi Normal University, Huadong Normal University. Besides the various programs and international agreements, several training and research centers follow under the ULIS umbrella organization. These include the Centre for Foreign Language Education Research and Quality Assurance, Centre for Research and Application of Information Technology in Teaching and Learning Foreign Languages, Centre for Distance Training and Teacher Development, and the Centre for International Education. The university also has close ties with the Foreign Languages Specializing School (FLSS). This school, established in 1969 and affiliated under the ULIS administration, is considered to be one of the best high schools for foreign language study in Vietnam. The national public magnet institution, Foreign Languages Specializing High School is also a part of the VNU University of Languages and International Studies.

It examines the association of two categorical variables and is a more powerful alternative than Fisher's exact test for 2×2 contingency tables. While first published in 1945 by George Alfred Barnard, the test did not gain popularity due to the computational difficulty of calculating the p-value and Fisher's disapproval. Nowadays, for small/moderate sample sizes ( n < 1000 ), computers can often implement Barnard's test in a few seconds. Purpose and scope Barnard's test is used to test the independence of rows and columns in a contingency table. The test assumes each response is independent. Under independence, there are three types of study designs that yield a 2×2 table. To distinguish the different types of designs, suppose a researcher is interested in testing whether a treatment quickly heals an infection. #One possible study design would be to sample 100 infected subjects, randomly give them the treatment or the placebo, and see if the infection is still present after a set time. This type of design is common in cross-sectional studies. #Another possible study design would be to give 50 infected subjects the treatment, 50 infected subjects the placebo, and see if the infection is still present after a set time. This type of design is common in case-control studies. #The final possible study design would be to give 50 infected subjects the treatment, 50 infected subjects the placebo, and stop the experiment once a set number of subjects has healed from the infection. This type of design is uncommon, but has the same structure as the ‘lady tasting tea’ study that led to R. A. Fisher creating Fisher's Exact test. The probability of a 2×2 table under the first study design is given by the multinomial distribution; the second study design is given by the product of two independent binomial distributions; the third design is given by the hypergeometric distribution. The difference between Barnard's exact test and Fisher's exact test is how they handle the nuisance parameter(s) of the common success probability when calculating the p-value. Fisher's test avoids estimating the nuisance parameter(s) by conditioning on the margins, an approximately ancillary statistic. Barnard's test considers all possible values of the nuisance parameter(s) and chooses the value(s) that maximizes the p-value. Both tests have sizes less than or equal to the type I error rate. However, Barnard's test can be more powerful than Fisher's test because it considers more 'as or more extreme' tables by not conditioning on both margins. In fact, one variant of Barnard's test, called Boschloo's test, is uniformly more powerful than Fisher's exact test. A more detailed description of Barnard's test is given by Mehta and Senchaudhuri. Barnard's test has been used alongside Fisher's Exact test in project management research Criticisms Under pressure from Fisher, Barnard retracted his test in a published paper, however many researchers prefer using Barnard's exact test over Fisher's exact test for analyzing 2×2 contingency tables. The only exception is when the true sampling distribution of the table is hypergeometric. Barnard's test can be applied to larger tables, but the computation time increases and the power advantage quickly decreases. It remains unclear which test statistic is preferred when implementing Barnard's test; however, most test statistics yield uniformly more powerful tests than Fisher's exact test.

She is the editor-in-chief of the website Kanoon Zanan Irani (\\"Focus on Iranian Women\\"). Baniyaghoob is married to fellow journalist Bahman Ahmadi Amou'i, an editor at Sarmayeh, a business newspaper. Early life Baniyaghoob was born on 21 August 1970, in Iran. As a young child in Iran, Baniyaghoob was exposed to the political atmosphere very young. She was surrounded by chaos and political influence for most of her childhood, but it wasn't until 1979 when Jila Baniyaghoob became a journalist. She was 11 years old at the time when she wrote and published a short story about children and poverty in a major daily newspaper called Kayhan. While she was young, many of her teachers encouraged her talent in writing. These teachers were politically engaged against the conservative who had taken over the country of Iran, some of which were arrested and persecuted for their political views. This gave Baniyaghoob the insight behind the political atmosphere starting from a young age and used it as an early building block for her career in covering politics as well as the economic factors of discrimination against women.  Career in journalism  Baniyaghoob began her career as a journalist while working for the daily newspaper Hamshahri while attending college at Allameh Tabatabayi University. Baniyaghoob has worked for many publications since college such as Sarmayeh newspaper, and now as editor-in-chief of the website Kanoon Zanan Irani where contributors inside and outside of Iran provide news about women's issues. Her site has been repeatedly filtered by the Iranian government. Baniyaghoob is known for being a freelance Iranian reporter, author, and activist who focuses her reporting on how government and social oppression affect women. As a journalist, Baniyaghoob has faced numerous ramifications and has been arrested, beaten and imprisoned on numerous occasions for her reporting. While working for the Sarmayeh newspaper, Baniyaghoob started a column on women's economy, which featured interviews with experts on the gender issues of economics. The column was canceled in 2008 by the paper's management. Baniyaghoob traveled throughout the Middle East, including Afghanistan, Palestine, Lebanon, and Syria from 2001–2002. She has written about women and refugees she encountered on her trip, covering issues of social and legal discrimination. Baniyaghoob was arrested in June 2006, when security forces attacked a peaceful gathering of women's rights activists in front of the University of Tehran, where she was covering the event for Sarmayeh. She was also arrested in March 2007 while covering those who opposed the Islamic Revolutionary Court's trial of women's rights activists. She was imprisoned in a wing of Tehran's Elvin prison where she was blindfolded and subjected to numerous interrogations by the Iranian Intelligence Ministry who operate the prison. She was later sent to prison in September 2008 after being found guilty of \\"disruption of public order, failure to obey police orders and propagandizing against the Islamic regime. Most recently she was arrested in June 2009 while covering the post-election protests in Iran and was later released in August. In 2010, Iran sentenced Baniyaghoob to jail for one year and banned her from writing for over 30 years over post-election unrest. Baniyaghoob is a founding member of the One Million Signatures Campaign for Equality, which aims to change the discriminatory laws against women in Iran. She has also published a book, Journalists in Iran. Her book documents the experiences of Iranian journalists and women under duress, as well as some of her own experiences. Baniyaghoob also published a second book, Women of Evin: Ward 209, which is based on her firsthand observations of women prisoners in Evin Prison in Tehran and will be published outside of Iran. In 2008, she was imprisoned a third time for covering a women's rally, on charges of \\"disruption of public order, failure to obey police orders and propagandizing against the Islamic regime\\".  2009 arrest  Beginning in June 2009, Iran saw widespread protests following a disputed election in which President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was re-elected amid allegations of voter fraud. On the night of 20 June, both Baniyaghoob and her husband were arrested at their home by plainclothes police officers, as part of a general crackdown on journalists. Amou'i was jailed that year on charges of \\"gathering and colluding with intent to harm national security\\", \\"spreading propaganda against the system\\", \\"disrupting public security\\" and \\"insulting the president\\". In 2010, Baniyaghoob was tried and convicted for \\"spreading propaganda against the system\\" and \\"insulting the president\\". The court banned her from practicing journalism for thirty years and sentenced her to a year in prison. On 2 September 2012, she was summoned to Evin Prison to begin the sentence. Amnesty International designated her a prisoner of conscience, \\"held solely for peacefully exercising her rights to freedom of expression\\", and called for her to be released and allowed to resume her profession. In 2009, the International Women's Media Foundation awarded Baniyaghoob its Courage In Journalism prize, stating that she had \\"fearlessly reported on government and social oppression, particularly as they affect women\\". The following year, she won the Freedom of Speech Award of Reporters Without Borders.

She refuses to censor her work and as a result, she has been fired from some media outlets. She continues to travel through the Middle East to report on the lives of women and refugees. Her reporting continues to make her a target of the Iranian government.

He served as Chief of the Naval Staff (CNS) from 1959 to 1962. Born in the Blue Mountains, Burrell entered the Royal Australian Naval College in 1918 as a 13-year-old cadet. His first posting at sea was aboard the cruiser . During the 1920s and 1930s, Burrell served for several years on exchange with the Royal Navy, specialising as a navigator. During World War II, he filled a key liaison post with the US Navy, and later saw action as commander of the destroyer , earning a mention in despatches. Promoted captain in 1946, Burrell played a major role in the formation of the RAN's Fleet Air Arm, before commanding the flagship in 1948–49. He captained the light aircraft carrier in 1953–54, and was twice Flag Officer of the Australian Fleet, in 1955–56 and 1958. Burrell was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1955 and a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1959. As CNS, he began a major program of acquisitions for the Navy, including new helicopters, minesweepers, submarines and guided-missile destroyers. He also acted to reverse a plan by the government of the day to dismantle the Fleet Air Arm. Knighted in 1960, Burrell retired to his farm near Canberra in 1962 and published his memoirs, Mermaids Do Exist, in 1986. He died two years later, aged 83. Early life and career Henry Mackay Burrell was born at Wentworth Falls, in the Blue Mountains district of New South Wales. He was the third child and only son of schoolteacher Thomas Burrell and his wife, Eliza.Bateman, \\"Burrell, Sir Henry Mackay\\" Henry's father, who had emigrated from England, joined the Australian Imperial Force aged 55 during World War I, seeing active service in Egypt. His grandfather and great-grandfather had served in the Royal Navy. Henry attended Parramatta High School before entering the Royal Australian Naval College, Jervis Bay, on 1 January 1918,Cadman, Who's Who in Australia 1988, p. 160 aged 13.Dennis et al., The Oxford Companion to Australian Military History, p. 117 A keen sportsman, he competed in rugby union, tennis and hockey, winning colours for hockey. Burrell graduated from the college in 1921 and became a midshipman the next year. He went to sea first aboard the light cruiser and then the destroyer . Posted to the United Kingdom for further training in 1924, he served on the light cruiser and the battleship . In April 1925, he was promoted to sub-lieutenant, rising to lieutenant by July 1926. HMS Devonshire during the Spanish Civil War After attending a Royal Navy course in 1930, Burrell became a specialist navigator, and saw service aboard the minesweeper HMS Pangbourne, destroyers and , and cruiser . He married Margaret MacKay at Scots' Church, Melbourne, on 27 December 1933. Burrell was promoted to lieutenant commander in July 1934, and graduated from an advanced navigation course the next year. Burrell served on exchange with the Royal Navy as navigator aboard the cruisers and , the latter during her tour of duty in the Spanish Civil War.Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, p. 97 Described as being \\"egalitarian\\" and \\"approachable\\", his familiarity with ratings earned him the criticism of Devonshires captain. Burrell, however, believed that a close relationship between officers and men was necessary for the smooth running of a ship.Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy in World War II , p. 122 After completing the Royal Navy's staff course in 1938, he returned to Australia and was appointed staff officer (operations) at the Navy Office, Melbourne, in March 1939.Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, p. 60 Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1939–1942, p. 56 It was Burrell's first shore-based position, and he spent the next four months bringing naval sections of the War Book (preparations for war) up to date. World War II HMAS Norman, commanded by Burrell in 1941–43 Burrell was still based at the Navy Office when World War II broke out in September 1939. A reorganisation of the headquarters in May 1940 saw him promoted to commander and given the new role of Director of Operations, overseeing troop convoys and their air cover, local defence, and staffing issues. Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1939–1942, pp. 418–419 Burrell's \\"full knowledge of Australian naval plans and resources\\" led to Prime Minister Robert Menzies personally nominating him to participate in staff talks with representatives of the Royal Navy and US Navy in October. Soon after, he was posted as the first Australian naval attaché to Washington, D.C., in an effort to improve communications with the US in light of the threat from Japan.Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, p. 116 Burrell was credited with helping to foster closer cooperation between the two navies in the Pacific region. He also warned the Australian government that Britain and the US would adopt a \\"Germany-first\\" strategy in the event of war with Japan, and that the US was prepared to weaken its Pacific fleet to help secure the Atlantic. Posted to Britain, Burrell was appointed commanding officer of the newly commissioned N-class destroyer on 15 September 1941. Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942–1945, p. 16 The ship's first operation was transporting a Trade Union Congress delegation led by Sir Walter Citrine to Archangel, Russia. After returning to Britain, she steamed to the Indian Ocean to join Admiral Sir James Somerville's Eastern Fleet at Addu Atoll, Maldives, on 26 February 1942. Following the Eastern Fleet's withdrawal to Kilindini, Kenya, Norman took part in the capture of Diego Suarez on Madagascar on 7 May. Later that month, she was reassigned to the Mediterranean and in June was involved in Operation Vigorous, an unsuccessful attempt to resupply the besieged island of Malta. Transferred back to the Indian Ocean, Burrell led Norman in the second campaign of the Battle of Madagascar in September, and was mentioned in despatches on 19 February 1943 for his \\"bravery and resource\\" during the operation. By this time Norman was escorting convoys in the Pacific, before deploying to the South Atlantic for anti-submarine duties in April–May.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942–1945, pp. 296–297 On 23 June 1943, Burrell relinquished command of Norman and returned to the Navy Office, Melbourne, as Director of Plans. Having been divorced from his first wife Margaret in November 1941, he married mineralogist Ada Weller (also known as Ada Coggan) on 21 April 1944; the couple had a son and two daughters. Burrell took charge of the RAN's latest destroyer, , at her commissioning in Sydney on 25 May 1945. Arriving on the scene too late to see action, the ship was deployed to Japan via the Philippines in July, docking in Tokyo on 31 August. There she participated in the formal surrender ceremonies that took place on 2 September aboard . Bataan remained in Japan as Australian Squadron representative until November, assisting with the repatriation of inmates from Japanese prisoner- of-war camps. On a mission to one such camp at Sendai, Burrell located crewmen from the light cruiser , which had been sunk in the early hours of 1 March 1942 during the Battle of Sunda Strait; 320 of her complement of 680 survived the sinking, 105 dying in captivity.

He was promoted captain in June 1946, and became Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff (DCNS) that October. As DCNS, Burrell played a major role in establishing the Navy's Fleet Air Arm and preparing for the introduction of carrier-based aircraft. He was appointed an aide-de-camp to Governor-General William McKell in July 1947. From October 1948 to the end of 1949, Burrell served as commanding officer of the heavy cruiser , flagship of the RAN. Posted to Britain in 1950, he attended the Imperial Defence College, London, and spent two years as Assistant Australian Defence Representative. He took command of the light aircraft carrier on 2 December 1952, less than three weeks after she was commissioned into the RAN after transfer from the Royal Navy. The ship began working up for deployment to the Korean War in June 1953, but in the end her place was taken by the carrier . Vengeance was involved in a collision with HMAS Bataan near the Cocos Islands on 5 April 1954, while acting as part of the escort for the Royal Yacht of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip during their inaugural tour of Australia, but continued on duty. Completing his tour as captain of Vengeance, Burrell briefly resumed the role of Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff in August 1954. The next month he was made an aide- de-camp to the Queen. Burrell was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1955 New Year Honours. In February he became Flag Officer of the Australian Fleet, with the acting rank of rear admiral; this was made substantive in July. On 12 May 1956, he hoisted his standard aboard the recently arrived aircraft carrier , marking her replacement of sister ship HMAS Sydney as flagship of the RAN. Burrell was posted soon afterwards to the Navy Office, Canberra, to redevelop the service's officer structure, leading to a new General List of officers' seniority. He served as Second Naval Member (Personnel) from September 1956 until January 1958, when he again became Flag Officer of the Australian Fleet. Appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in the 1959 New Years Honours, Burrell was raised to vice admiral on 24 February and became First Naval Member, the Chief of the Naval Staff (CNS). He succeeded Vice Admiral Sir Roy Dowling.Rose, The Navy Miscellany, pp. 515–516 , first of the RAN's guided-missile destroyers ordered by Burrell, at sea in 1980 As CNS, Vice Admiral Burrell had to contend with a threat by Defence Minister Athol Townley to disband the Navy's fixed-wing Fleet Air Arm capability by 1963, but gained approval for a major vessel re-equipment drive that was to include new submarines, destroyers, minesweepers, and auxiliaries.Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, pp. 187–188 This led among other things to the procurement of British s, selected by Burrell when his original preference for an Australian-built craft proved too expensive, as well as s and the Navy's first purpose-designed hydrographic survey ship, . The re-equipment program also resulted in augmentation of the RAN's rotary- wing assets with Westland Wessex anti-submarine warfare helicopters. Most significant was the purchase of three guided-missile destroyers, a decision of \\"ingenuity and forethought\\" on the part of Burrell and Navy Minister John Gorton, according to historian Tom Frame.Frame, No Pleasure Cruise, p. 284 The CNS and his minister enjoyed a close working relationship; Burrell declared that Gorton \\"deserves our thanks for his efforts\\", and Gorton called Burrell \\"one of the most honest, sincere and most dedicated sailors\\".Hancock, John Gorton, pp. 90, 95 The purchase of the destroyers signalled a shift in reliance for equipment from Britain to the United States that was contrary to prevailing Australian defence policy at the time, particularly in what historian Jeffrey Grey described as \\"the most British of the Australian services, the RAN\\", and provoked pressure from the Royal Navy and UK shipbuilders, which had lobbied for purchase of their .Grey, Up Top, p. 21 Burrell later declared that the superiority of the US weapons system was a key factor in his preference for the Adams design over the County class.Jones; Goldrick, Struggling for a Solution, pp. 7–12 On a mission overseas to discuss trends and acquisitions in January 1960, he was rebuffed by Britain's Chief of the Defence Staff, Admiral of the Fleet Lord Louis Mountbatten, who mistakenly thought him responsible for the imminent dissolution of the RAN's Fleet Air Arm, but warmly welcomed by the US Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Arleigh Burke. As it happened, Burrell would gain credit for maintaining the integrity of the FAA, and its fixed-wing component remained viable until the early 1980s. He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the Queen's Birthday Honours, gazetted on 3 June 1960. In June 1961, he met with his opposite numbers in the Army and Air Force at a Chiefs of Staff Committee conference to discuss the necessity of Australia acquiring nuclear weapons; the chiefs agreed that the probability such a capability would be required was remote but that it should remain an option under certain circumstances, a position the defence forces maintained during the ensuing decade.Stephens, Going Solo, p. 368 Retirement Burrell made his farewell to the Australian Fleet aboard HMAS Melbourne at Jervis Bay on 8 February 1962. He left the Navy on 23 February, and was succeeded as CNS by Vice Admiral Hastings Harrington. Burrell retired to Illogan Park, his property near Braidwood in the Southern Tablelands of New South Wales. His son Stuart followed him into the Royal Australian Naval College in 1963. In retirement Burrell enjoyed horse racing as a gambler and as the owner of several successful mounts. During the 1960s, he was also a member of the ACT Regional Selection Committee of the Winston Churchill Memorial Trusts. Burrell suffered a serious heart attack in 1980, having been diagnosed with cardiac problems shortly after his retirement from the Navy. His wife Ada died in August 1981. In 1986, Burrell published his memoirs as Mermaids Do Exist: The Autobiography of Vice-Admiral Sir Henry Burrell, reflecting on what he described as a \\"lucky\\" career, and offering his thoughts on maritime strategy. He died on 9 February 1988 in Woden Valley Hospital. Survived by his three children, Burrell was buried in Gungahlin, Australian Capital Territory, after a private funeral. The Burrell Cup doubles tennis trophy, established by the admiral in 1955, completed its 58th year of competition in March 2013.

History After proclaiming himself emperor, Gia Long ordered a Frenchman named J.B. Chaigneau to compose an anthem for him. Chaigneau borrowed the rhythm of \\"Marche Militaire\\" by Franz Liszt and composed the \\"Đăng đàn cung\\". From the time of Gia Long, this piece was played when the emperors moved from Citadel of Huế to Esplanade of Sacrifice to the Heaven and Earth. It was used in villages and courts to invoke divinities and honour monarchs. Under the reign of Bảo Đại, a lyric was written by musician Nguyễn Phúc Ưng Thiều (Hán tự: 阮福膺昭). Later, Empire of Vietnam's prime minister Trần Trọng Kim selected \\"Đăng đàn cung\\" as Vietnam national anthem. Nowadays, this piece of music still played, restrictively, in Vietnam. It was used commonly in the Vietnam tourism industry and in traditional Vietnamese music teachings.

It can be defined as “a detailed written statement that explains why a museum is in operation and how it goes about its business. The policy articulates the museum’s professional standards regarding the objects left in its care and serves as a guide for the staff”.Malaro, M. C., & Pogany DeAngelis, I. (2012). A Legal Primer on Managing Museum Collections (Third ed.). Page 46. Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Books. Since museums are often faced with questions that deal with what objects they should acquire, how to handle removing or loaning objects in the collection, or standards of care for objects; it is imperative to have a well-written policy that can help prevent possible issues on the museum's end. Prevention is the best approach when dealing with operations and objects in the collection, therefore the policy is an important document that can be looked at almost like boundaries set in place to help insure that the museum stays true to its mission while also providing the best care for the collection.  Writing policy  When writing a policy, take the time to ensure that it covers any possible factors that might affect the museum collection, operations, or staff. It is important to note that not all museums are created equally and will therefore have their own unique situations to deal with. With this in mind one must also note that “collection management policies should be written to meet the needs of a specific museum, its collections, and the use of those collections”.Simmons, J. E. (2010). Collections Management Policies. In R. A. Buck & J. A. Gilmore (Eds.), Museum Registration Methods (5th ed., pp. 24-29). Washington, D.C.: The AAM Press. To help insure that the written policy can be put to use the museum must be aware of current practices and standards to include. The policy should also be easy to follow while avoiding being overly complex. During the beginning stages of this process the museum and staff members should work together to develop procedures, review the policy and revise as necessary until the policy is complete. There is a lot to consider and quite a bit of work that goes into writing this type of policy, but as the American Alliance of Museums notes, “the process of creating and implementing a policy is far more important and beneficial to the museum than the actual policy itself. The policy may seem like the end result, but in actuality, the end result is a broad understanding of ethics and procedures, which influences how the museum operates”.  What should a policy include  Although every museum is different, below are some of the common key factors a museum should include in their policy. = Introductory section = Given that almost every decision a museum makes is done with its mission statement in mind, it is important that it is included in the policy. A mission statement addresses the museum's focus in terms of its purpose and its roles and responsibilities to the public and collections. This statement is what helps determine everything the museum does and should be referenced to on a regular bases to ensure that decisions are still in line with the museum's original goal. Museum mission statements should adhere to the standards of the American Alliance of Museums. In addition to the mission statement, policies typically include a section that outlines the scope of the collection. This is a useful part of the policy that “reviews the history of the collection; considers its strengths, weaknesses, and current uses; and states what the museum does and does not collect” . The collections policy or selection criteria of a library, archive or museum collection is a statement of the institution's priorities as they apply to the acquisition of new materials. Collections policies guide the process of collection development. Even the largest, best funded and most famous libraries (such as the Library of Congress, the British Library and Stanford University) cannot acquire, house, catalogue and maintain all works,For attempts to do this, see Universal library. so a policy or set of criteria is required for selecting which should be acquired. Generally collections policy is related to the mission or purpose of the library: for example national libraries collect materials related to that nation or published in that nation's territory, academic libraries generally collect materials used in teaching and research at the institution which they serveDonated materials may be subject to less rigorous criteria and electronic materials are usually selected from large collections of serials and databases which may contain a mixture of appropriate and inappropriate materials and public libraries collect materials which are expected to satisfy demands from the public they serve. Sample collections policies include: * Collections policy statements of the Library of Congress (organised by field) * Collection Policy Statement of the B. Davis Schwartz Memorial Library at the Long Island University * Collections Policy of the National Library of New Zealand (integrated digital and physical policy) * Collection and Preservation Policy for SunSITE (digital library) As well as setting priorities for purchasing materials, collections policies also serve as a guide when libraries are offered gifts of materials or endowments. Acquisition of materials can be less costly than the processing (sorting, cataloguing, etc.) and long term storage costs of many materials, and even free gifts to libraries usually have associated costs. This introductory section may also look to include a history of the museum, = Acquisitions = The acquisitions portion of a policy outlines whether or not proposed objects should be included into the museum's collection. Within this section the policy will also include who is involved in this decision making process and whether or not the museum is acquiring the object on a permanent or short-term loan basis. These acquisitions must fit into the scope of collection that has been outlined by the museum. This portion of the policy can also include information pertaining to receipts for donations and ensuring that all acquired objects have proper title and have been obtained legally. The acquisitions portion of the policy tends to also include guidelines for dealing with storage, potential use, and copyright. = Deaccessions = Deaccessioning is the “process used to remove permanently an object from a museum’s collection or to document the reasons for an involuntary removal”.Malaro, M. C., & Pogany DeAngelis, I. (2012). A Legal Primer on Managing Museum Collections (Third ed.) pg 46. Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Books. Similar to new acquisitions, the policy will fully outline the steps the museum will take when considering the permanent removal of an object from the collection. Also include reasons why the object should be removed, who can propose the removal, and who has final vote on removal. Proper methods of removal and how the museum will use the proceeds should and object be sold are also key factors to include in the policy. Museums often state its adherence to the American Alliance of Museum's Code of Ethics for Museums to make sure that the “disposal of collections through sale, trade, or research activities is solely for the advancement of the museum’s mission\\". = Loans = The loans section of a policy typically includes procedures for both incoming and outgoing loans. A strong loan policy will assure that the loan furthers the purpose of the museum, that the object will be cared for properly, and that the registration system can keep track of the object over for the duration of the loan\\".Reibel, D. B. (2008). Registration methods for the small museum (4th ed.). Lanham, MD: AltaMira Press. Some other key points in this portion of the policy pertain to who the museum will lend to; institutions rather than individuals, that the loaned object still fits the mission of the museum and scope of collection, insurance needs, length of the loan, and use of photography. = Care of collections = Museums serve a purpose to protect and preserve objects within its collection. In order to ensure that the objects are getting the best possible care, the museum uses this portion of the policy to address all factors that pertain to the care of the museum's collection. It will also identify key staff members, required levels of training to handle objects, and who has access to the collection. This section will set that standards pertaining to topics like museum storage, integrated pest management, conservation, record management, inventories, and risk management. The policy needs to clearly state the responsibilities each staff member has in order to protect objects in the collection.  Storage  It is likely that not every piece the museum has will be exhibited at one point. Therefore, it is important that the policy outlines standards for storage whether it be onsite or off. The policy addresses proper environment conditions in storage areas pertaining to things like light levels, temperature, and relative humidity. This portion of the policy will also outline standards that deal with proper packing of objects in storage to insure that proper materials are used and that like objects are grouped together.  Integrated pest management  Integrated pest management is essential in protecting the museum's objects from pest damage. Within this section of the policy the museum addresses what the museum plans to do in order to keep pests out of the museum. It can also address any products that can and cannot be used in the museum or on the objects themselves. In planning for preparedness the policy will address how the museum will respond to and to whom they should report any suspicion activity to.  Conservation  Museums work hard to ensure that the objects in the collection are properly cared for but conservation is still needed from time to time to help keep objects in their ideal state. The conservation portion of the policy will identify who has the final vote on whether or not objects can be treated, whether or not the staff has responsibilities dealing with actively monitoring objects, and how the museum will cover the cost of funding for conservation. It will also include specific conservators to contact and whether or not there are any treatment methods that are prohibited for use. If the museum has a long-range conservation plan, it can be mentioned here.  Record management and documentation  This is one of the key roles of staff members working with collections. Without proper documentation, it is almost as if the object does not exist. Therefore, it is imperative that the policy addresses standards relating to proper record management and documentation related to objects in the collection. As the American Alliance of Museums notes “In writing this section, museums typically reference the types of records created, what information is contained in each record, the parties responsible for maintaining and documenting the records and any procedures and back-up systems”.  Inventories  Inventory of the museum's collection is used to ensure that all objects within the collection are accounted for and in the correct location. This section of the policy will note necessary steps to take when completing an inventory. It will also address how often the museum conducts comprehensive inventories and spot-check inventories. Comprehensive inventories are ones that include checking the entire collection, where spot- check inventories deal with a selected amount of random objects in the collection that will need to be located and checked for inventory. This part of the policy also notes the steps to take and whom to notify if something is missing.  Risk management  Museum staff can hope that a disaster will never hit, but it is important for the museums have a plan in place in the event that one does. Risk management in regards to a collections management policy will note what the museum is doing in an effort to best protect objects. This includes topics dealing with fire protection, ways to prevent mold, and security. The museum should also have an emergency response plan in place as well.  Policy examples  As stated before, not all policies will be the same. There is no template that can be used but below are examples of policies that might be beneficial to reference when writing a policy. *Metropolitan Museum of Arthttp://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-met/policies- and-documents/collections-management-policy *Museum of Science and History of Jacksonville, Inc.http://www.flamuseums.org/site/assets/files/1277/mosh- jax.pdf *National Museum of Natural Historyhttp://entomology.si.edu/Collections/NMNH_CMP_Sept-18-2006.pdf *Whitney Museum of American Art  References  Category:Conservation and restoration of cultural heritage Category:Collections ","title":"Collection Management Policy"},{"id":"22884669","title":"Kristy Yang"},{"id":"22884706","text":"Jack Spencer was an English professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1900s.

Theories of color One of the topics in the philosophy of color is the problem of the ontology of color. The questions comprising this field of research are, for example, what kind of properties colors are (i.e. are they physical properties of objects? Or are they properties of their own kind?), but also problems about the representation of colors, and the relationship between the representation of colors and their ontological constitution. Within the ontology of color, there are various competing types of theories. One way of posing their relationship is in terms of whether they posit colors as sui generis properties (properties of a special kind that can't be reduced to more basic properties or constellations of such). This divides color primitivism from color reductionism. A primitivism about color is any theory that explains colors as irreducible properties. A reductionism is the opposite view, that colors are identical to or reducible to other properties. Typically a reductionist view of color explains colors as an object's disposition to cause certain effects in perceivers or the very dispositional power itself (this sort of view is often dubbed \\"relationalism\\", since it defines colors in terms of effects on perceivers, but it also often called simply dispositionalism - various forms of course exist). An example of a notable theorist that defends this kind of view is the philosopher Jonathan Cohen. Another type of reductionism is color physicalism. Physicalism is the view that colors are identical to certain physical properties of objects. Most commonly the relevant properties are taken to be reflectance properties of surfaces (though there are accounts of colors apart from surface colors too). Byrne, Hilbert and Kalderon defends versions of this view. They identify colors with reflectance types. A reflectance type is a set, or type, of reflectances, and a reflectance is a surface's disposition to reflect certain percentages of light specified for each wavelength within the visible spectrum. Both relationalism and physicalism of these kinds are so called realist theories, since apart from specifying what colors are, they maintain that colored things exist. Primitivism may be either realist or antirealist, since primitivism simply claims that colors aren't reducible to anything else. Some primitivists further accept that, though colors are primitive properties, no real or nomologically possible objects have them. Insofar as we visually represent things as colored - on this view - we are victims of color illusions. For this reason primitivism that denies that colors are ever instantiated is called an error theory. Color discourse If color fictionalism is true, and the world has no colors, should one just stop color discourse, and all the time wear clothes that clash with each other? Prescriptive color fictionalism would say no. In prescriptive color fictionalism, while color discourse is, strictly speaking, false, one should continue using it in everyday life as though color properties do exist. Color vision became an important part of contemporary analytic philosophy due to the claim by scientists like Leo Hurvich that the physical and neurological aspects of color vision had become completely understood by empirical psychologists in the 1980s. An important work on the subject was C. L. Hardin's 'Color for Philosophers,' which explained stunning empirical findings by empirical psychologists to the conclusion that colors cannot possibly be part of the physical world, but are instead purely mental features. David Hilbert and Alexander Byrne have devoted their careers to philosophical issues regarding color vision. Byrne and Hilbert have taken a minority position that colors are part of the physical world. Nigel J.T. Thomas provides a particularly clear presentation of the argument. The psychologist George Boeree, in the tradition of J. J. Gibson, specifically assigns color to light, and extends the idea of color realism to all sensory experience, an approach he refers to as \\"quality realism\\". Jonathan Cohen (of UCSD) and Michael Tye (of UT Austin) have also written many essays on color vision. Cohen argues for the uncontroversial position of color relationalism with respect to semantics of color vision in Relationalist Manifesto. In The Red and the Real, Cohen argues for the position, with respect to color ontology that generalizes from his semantics to his metaphysics. Cohen's work marks the end of a vigorous debate on the topic of color that started with Hardin. Michael Tye argues, among other things, that there is only one correct way to see colors. Therefore, the colorblind and most mammals do not really have color vision because their vision differs from the vision of \\"normal\\" humans. Similarly, creatures with more advanced color vision, although better able to distinguish objects than people, are suffering from color illusions because their vision differs from humans. Tye advanced this particular position in an essay called True Blue. Paul Churchland (of UCSD) has also commented extensively on the implication of color vision science on his version of reductive materialism. In the 1980s Paul Churchland's view located colors in the retina. But his more recent view locates color in spectral opponency cells deeper in the color information stream. Paul Churchland's view is similar to Byrne and Hilbert's view, but differs in that it emphasized the subjective nature of color vision and identifies subjective colors with coding vectors in neural networks. Many philosophers follow empirical psychologists in endorsing color irrealism, the view that colors are entirely mental constructs and not physical features of the world. Surprisingly, most philosophers who have extensively addressed the topic have attempted to defend color realism against the empirical psychologists who universally defend color antirealism. Jonathan Cohen has edited a collection of essays on the topic of color philosophy called Color Vision and Color Science, Color Ontology and Color Science.

She was her country's first astrophysicist, and helped to create a curriculum in astrophysics at the national university, as well as to build public awareness and understanding of astronomy and space issues. She was appointed Director General of Angkasa, the Malaysian National Space Agency and served as the director of the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs in Vienna from 2007 to 2014. Early life and education Born in Seremban, Malaysia, Mazlan attended Kolej Tunku Kurshiah, a Malaysian prominent boarding school in Seremban, Negeri Sembilan. Her aptitude for mathematics led to enrolment in a science curriculum. Although her family encouraged her to become a physician MD, she decided to pursue physics instead. She attended the University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand on a Colombo plan scholarship, earning a BSc. (Honours) in 1975. She then joined the National University of Malaysia (UKM) as a tutor, but negotiated an extension to her scholarship and returned to Otago, earning her Ph.D in physics in 1981 - the first woman to do so since the University was founded in 1869. Career Dato' Mazlan Othman returned to Malaysia as the country's first astrophysicist, and worked to create a curriculum in astrophysics at the national university, as well as to build public awareness and understanding of astronomy and space issues. She also performed research for a semester at the Kiso Observatory in Japan. Her interest in public education was rewarded in 1990 when Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad placed her in charge of the Planetarium Division of the Prime Minister's Department, overseeing development of Planetarium Negara, Malaysia's national planetarium in Kuala Lumpur. After the planetarium opened in 1993, Mazlan was made Director General of the government's new Space Science Studies Division, where she launched a microsatellite development program. She received a full professorship the following year. In November 1999, Kofi Annan, Secretary-General of the United Nations, appointed Mazlan as Director of the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA) in Vienna. At the request of Prime Minister Mahathir, she returned to Malaysia in July 2002 to serve for five years as the founding Director General of Angkasa, the Malaysian National Space Agency, where her work led to the launch of the first Malaysian astronaut, Sheikh Muszaphar Shukor. Mazlan was reappointed as UNOOSA director in 2007 by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, and left Angkasa to return to the post that December. At UNOOSA she dealt with issues of international co-operation in space, prevention of collisions and space debris, use of space-based remote sensing platforms for sustainable development, co-ordination of space law between countries, and the risks posed by near-earth asteroids, among other topics. In September 2010, several news sources reported the United Nations would soon appoint Othman to be the ambassador for extraterrestrial contact, apparently basing their claims on remarks she made suggesting that the UN co-ordinate any international response to such contact, and her scheduled appearance on a Royal Society panel that October, \\"Towards a scientific and societal agenda on extra-terrestrial life.\\" However, a UN spokesperson dismissed the reports as \\"nonsense\\", dismissing any plan to expand the mandate of UNOOSA, and in an email to The Guardian, Othman stated, in compliance to the wishes of the United Nations, \\"It sounds really cool but I have to deny it.\\" She later explained that her talk would illustrate how extraterrestrial affairs could become a topic of discussion at the UN, using as an example the advocacy that led to UN discussion of near- Earth objects and space debris. After retiring from the United Nations, Othman served on advisory committees and boards involving science and space, taught as a visiting professor, and became a senior fellow of the Academy of Sciences Malaysia. In September 2017, she was named Director of the International Science Council (ISC) Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific. Honours In the 1997 Agong's honours list, Tuanku Ja'afar, the tenth Yang di-Pertuan Agong of Malaysia, conferred the federal decoration and order Panglima Jasa Negara (for meritorious service) on Mazlan, granting her the honorific \\"Datuk\\". Also in 1997, Mazlan's alma mater, the University of Otago, awarded her the degree of Honorary Doctor of Science. In 2009, for \\"her work in developing astronomy education in Malaysia and her leading national and international role in space science\\", the Institute of Physics awarded Mazlan its President's Medal. In 2013, Mazlan received the \\"Polarstern-Preis\\" (Polarstar Award) from the Austrian Space Forum for her engagement to fascinate for space above and beyond duty. * : ** 50px Officer of the Order of the Defender of the Realm (KMN) (1994) ** 50px Commander of the Order of Meritorious Service (PJN) - Datuk (1997) * : ** 50px Principal Grand Knight of the Order of Loyalty to Negeri Sembilan (SSNS) - Dato' Seri (2020) Personal life Dato’ Seri Mazlan Othman has two children and two grandchildren.

Steadman, a Democrat, was appointed to the Colorado Senate in May 2009 following the resignation of Jennifer Veiga. He represented the 31st Senate district, which covered downtown and north-central Denver and portions of Adams County. He did not seek re-election in 2016, and his term ended in January, 2017.Ballotpedia. Retiring incumbents. Viewed: 2016-01-13. Biography A resident of Denver's Capitol Hill neighborhood, Steadman grew up in Westminster, Colorado, graduating from Westminster High School, Regis College and the University of Colorado School of Law. In 2013, Steadman completed Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government program for Senior Executives in State and Local Government as a David Bohnett LGBTQ Victory Institute Leadership Fellow. He became an attorney and prominent lobbyist at the Capitol, best known for his advocacy on gay rights issues. Steadman met David Misner in 2000 and they were together until Misner's death of pancreatic cancer in 2012. Legislative career2009 appointment= When Sen. Jennifer Veiga announced her resignation from the legislature in 2009, Steadman was one of ten candidates in the race to succeed her. A vacancy committee, composed of Democratic Party precinct officers and local elected officials, was convened to choose a replacement on May 20, 2009; Veiga endorsed Steadman for the vacancy appointment. Although Steadman placed second to former state representative Ann Ragsdale on the first round of balloting, he received the most votes in the second round and, in the third and final round, he won majority support, defeating Ragsdale by 93 votes to 63. Steadman, who was sworn into office on May 29, 2009, ran for and won the election for the final two years of Veiga's four-year term in the November 2010 legislative elections. Like Veiga, Steadman is openly gay. He is one of eight openly LGBT members of the Colorado General Assembly, along with senators Lucía Guzmán (D–Denver) and Jessie Ulibarri (D–Commerce City), as well as representatives Mark Ferrandino (D–Denver), Paul Rosenthal (D–Denver), Dominick Moreno (D–Commerce City), Joann Ginal (D–Fort Collins) and Sue Schafer (D–Wheat Ridge). =The Colorado Civil Unions Act= In 2011, Steadman introduced the Colorado Civil Unions Act, an act to create legal recognition for same-sex and heterosexual couples more similar to marriage than allowed in existing law in Colorado. The act passed the Democratic-controlled state Senate but was blocked in a Republican- controlled House committee on March 31, 2011, before it could reach a full House vote. See: Recognition of Same-Sex Unions in Colorado: The Colorado Civil Unions Act of 2011 In the 2012 state elections, Steadman was challenged by Republican candidate Michael Carr, in what is believed to be the first state legislative race in United States history in which both major party candidates were openly gay.\\"Election Results: LGBT Races to Watch\\". The Advocate, November 6, 2012. Steadman defeated his opponent, and was rumored as a possible candidate for President of the State Senate due to the Democratic majority retained in the chamber. In 2013, Steadman was honored at the White House with the Harvey Milk Champion of Change Award.

In 2017, Jennifer’s relationship with Toby seemingly ended and Gerardo was moved back in to her home. During this period, however, of on-again, off-again relationships Rodriguez neglected her responsibilities as a Council member. After having missed extended periods of time from Council Meetings, on November 2, 2017, State of California Attorney General Xavier Becerra issued an opinion stating \\"there are substantial questions of law and fact as to whether Rodriguez was absent from all regular city council meetings for 60 days, thereby forfeiting her office under Gov. Code section 36513.\\"* On December 11, 2019, Superior Court of California (County of Los Angeles) Judge Gregory W.

In fall, a more localised feature around the mouth of the river may spread like a narrow jet along the Washington coast, less than offshore. Winds, and the tidal Coriolis effect also affect its position.

Biology and Philosophy 18: 262-263 and \\"one of the foremost plant morphologists in the world.\\"Cavers, P. 1974. Rolf Sattler. The Canadian Botanical Association Bulletin 7(3): 5. His contributions are not only empirical but involved also a revision of the most fundamental concepts, theories, and philosophical assumptions. He published the award-winning Organogenesis of Flowers (1973) and nearly a hundred scientific papers, mainly on plant morphology. As well he has contributed to many national and international symposia and also organized and chaired symposia at international congresses, edited the proceedings of two of them and published them as books.Sattler, R. (ed.). 1978. Theoretical Plant Morphology. The Hague: Leiden University Press.Sattler, R. (ed.). 1982. Axioms and Principles of Plant Constructions. The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff/Junk Publishers. Besides Biophilosophy (1986), his philosophical contributions include articles on complementarity (perspectivism), process philosophy, the mandala principle, and the convergence of science and spirituality. Additional publications deal with holistic alternative medicine and healing ways of thinking such as fuzzy logic, Yin-Yang thinking (both/and logic), Buddhist and Jain logic. Life Sattler was born in Göppingen, Germany. He studied botany, zoology, chemistry, philosophy and pedagogy in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland and received his doctorate, with summa cum laude, in systematic botany from the University of Munich. As a postdoctoral fellow, he spent a year with Ludwig von Bertalanffy, one of the founders of general systems theory, at the University of Alberta in Canada. Subsequently, he worked for another year with Ernest M. Gifford and G. Ledyard Stebbins at the University of California. For 33 years, he was first assistant, then associate, and finally full professor in the departments of botany and biology of McGill University in Montreal. He became Emeritus Professor when he retired in 1997. Since retiring he has lived in Kingston, Ontario. At McGill University he taught botany, biology, the history and philosophy of biology, and biology in relation to the human predicament. As a visiting professor at the University of Berlin in Germany he taught plant morphology and the philosophy of biology. At Cornell University, he was consultant in the Summer Institute on the Philosophy of Biology. And at Naropa Institute he taught a summer course on Modern Biology and Zen. Sattler has lectured at many universities across the globe, including Harvard and the Universities of California, Paris, Berlin, Bonn, Heidelberg, Zurich, Delhi, Malaya, and Singapore. As well as his research in plant morphology and the philosophy of biology, he has investigated the relation of science and spirituality and is keenly interested in holistic alternative medicine and healing thinking. He is also interested in developing a process language in which the verb, not the noun or pronoun, plays the primary role. In 1995, he gave a talk on science and spirituality in a symposium at the 60th birthday celebrations of the Dalai Lama. There he discussed the relation between science and spirituality with special reference to life science.Sattler, R. 1999. Divergence and convergence of sciences and spirituality: life science and spirituality. Holistic Science and Human Values, Transactions 4: 41-48. Plant morphology, science and philosophy Sattler’s contributions to plant morphology include the empirical, conceptual, theoretical, and philosophical. Together with his coworkers he has contributed a wealth of empirical data on shoot and leaf developmentLacroix, C.; Jeune, B.; Purcell-Macdonald, S. 2003. Shoot and compound leaf comparisons in eudicots: dynamic morphology as an alternative approach. Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society 143: 219-230. and flower development.Greyson, R. I. 1994. Th Development of Flowers. New York/ Oxford: Oxford University Press. Leins, P.; Erbar, C. 2010. Flower and Fruit. Stuttgart: Schweizerbart. His empirical findings led him to revision fundamental concepts of comparative morphology. He emphasized that the concepts of homology and homeosis (replacement) should also include partial homology, partial homeosis, and quantitative homology.Hall, B. K. (ed.) 1994. Homology: The hierarchical basis of comparative morphology. New York: Academic Press, pp. 15-16 These revisions led him to question the theoretical and philosophical foundations of comparative morphology. In contrast to mainstream morphology, which tends to be categorical, he provided evidence for a continuum morphology.Cusset, G. 1982. The conceptual bases of plant morphology. Acta Biotheoretica 31A, p. 45.Rutishauser, R.; Moline, P. 2005. Evo-devo and the search for homology (\\"sameness\\") in biological systems. Theory in Biosciences 124: 213-241. Together with Bernard Jeune, he demonstrated mathematically a continuum of plant forms that spans not only organ categories such as root, stem, and leaf, but also different hierarchical levels of organ systems, organs, and tissues.Sattler, R. and B. Jeune. 1992. Multivariate analysis confirms the continuum view of plant form. Annals of Botany 69: 249-262 Rutishauser and Isler regard him as one of the major contemporary proponents of continuum morphology (or Fuzzy Arberian Morphology: FAM).Rutishauser, R. and Isler, B. 2001. Developmental genetics and morphological evolution of flowering plants, especially bladderworts (Utricularia): Fuzzy Arberian Morphology complements Classical Morphology. Annals of Botany Vol. 88, p. 1184) Furthermore, he developed a dynamic morphology or process morphology that supersedes the structure/process dualism inherent in almost all biological research.Kirchoff, B.K.; Pfeifer, E.; Rutishauser, R. 2008. Plant structure ontology: How should we label plant structures with doubtful or mixed identities? Zootaxa 1950: 103-122. According to process morphology, structures do not have process(es), they are process(es). He used principal component analysis and the concept of morphological distance to provide a dynamic approach to structure as process,Hall, B.K.(ed). 1994. Homology: The hierarchical basis of comparative biology. New York: Academic Press, pp. 15-16 This approach has placed comparative morphology on a more objective planeGreyson, R. I. 1994. The Development of Flowers. New York: Oxford University Press, p. 11 The major focus of his philosophical contributions to plant morphology and our understanding of reality has been on process philosophy, integral philosophy, holism, contextualism, perspectivism, and complementarity. Besides hierarchy (holarchy), he underlines the importance of complementary perspectives such as holism as undivided wholeness, Yin-Yang, continuum and network views.Cuerrier, A. 1997. Rolf Sattler. Le novel esprit scientifique. Interface 18(6):16-21 Besides Aristotelian either/or logic, he emphasizes the importance of fuzzy logic. He explores how either/or logic can lead to conflict and even war, whereas fuzzy logic and Yin-Yang thinking can be healing because they connect what either/or logic has torn apart.Rolf Sattler, Healing Thinking and Being Finally, he also emphasizes that beyond all perspectives is the unnamable source, emptiness (in the Buddhist sense), mystery, which is of ultimate importance for healing and total Being.Cusset, G. 1994. Le statut de la morphologie végétale. Canadian Journal of Botany\\" 72: 605-616. Using a mandala, he presented a synthesis of his scientific, philosophical, and spiritual insights in his open book ‘’Wholeness, Fragmentation, and the Unnamable: Holism, Materialism, and Mysticism – A Mandala’’ (see below in Bibliography). This book also contains two extensive appendices, one on ‘’The Human Condition and its Transcendence’’, and another on ‘’Lessons from the 20th Century for the 21st Century’’. Awards and honors Sattler is a Fellow of the Linnean Society of London and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. In 1974 he was awarded the Lawson Medal (the highest award of the Canadian Botanical Association) for his book Organogenesis of Flowers. In 1995 he received an honorary doctorate (D.Sc.) from the Open International University at Colombo, Sri Lanka for his contributions to complementary alternative medicine. A symposium was dedicated to him on the occasion of his retirement.Plant Morphology – Theory and Practice.

Biography André-Joseph Allar was born in Toulon on 22 August 1845. He became a successful sculptor after training under Antoine Laurent Dantan and Pierre-Jules Cavelier. Allar is best known for his small-scale work and architectural designs with majority of his work situated at the local museum in Toulon, including 'Hercules finding his dead son'. His artworks on Hercules is evidently inspired by the Greek hero, but in particular, the stories that depict the character as a saviour. His architectural features include his works in the Palacio Legislativo Federal with Laurent Marqueste and in the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City. Another one of his famous works is the statue of law displayed on the façade Palace of Justice, Rome. In addition to his career as an artist, Allar joined the Legion of Honour as an officer in 1896 and the French Institute in 1905. He won various prizes but most notably the Prix de Rome in 1869 for his sculpture, and later became a member of the Académie des Beaux-Arts on 20 May 1905. He died in Toulon on 11 April 1926. A street in Marseille has been named in his honor.

It is the second satellite of the Meridian system, which will replace the older Molniya series. It follows on from Meridian 1, which was launched in December 2006. Meridian 2 was launched on a Soyuz-2.1a rocket with a Fregat upper stage, from Site 43/4 at the Plesetsk Cosmodrome. The launch occurred on 21 May 2009, at 21:53 GMT. While the launch was officially announced as successful, the satellite was placed in a significantly lower orbit than expected, and it was later reported that the upper stage of the Soyuz carrier rocket had shut down five seconds early, and an attempt to compensate for the low orbit resulted in the Fregat running out of fuel during its second burn. Following launch, it was reported to have been given a Kosmos designation; however, such a designation was never assigned. Molniya satellites intended for operational use were only assigned Kosmos designations if they were considered to have failed. If it had received a Kosmos designation, it would have been Kosmos 2451 ( meaning Cosmos 2451). While the launch was originally considered to have been a partial failure, with the spacecraft able to correct its own orbit, it later emerged that the spacecraft could not reach a usable orbit, and the mission was declared a failure. It is believed to be based on the Uragan-M satellite bus, which has also been used for GLONASS navigation satellites. It was constructed by ISS Reshetnev. It will operate in a Molniya orbit with a perigee of , an apogee of , and 65° inclination. Based on radio observations, Meridian-2 is known to downlink in the 278 MHz, 992 MHz-1002 MHz and 3.6 GHz bands.

The first mention is found from the 13th century, where they are mentioned along with the Koch and Tharu.\\"The description of (Bakhtiyar Khalji's) disastrous campaign provides us with some information about the populations (Siraj 1881: 560-1):... Konch, sometimes written Koch, (the same hesitation occurs in Buchanan-Hamilton’s manuscripts), is what we today write as Koch. Mej or Meg is the name we write as Mech. We can safely conclude that these names described important groups of people in the 13th century, in the area between the Ganges and the Brahmaputra.\\" It is one of the scheduled tribes of India, listed both in West Bengal and Assam, India.  Etymology  It has been suggested that mech is probably a corruption of the Sanskrit word mlechchha.The Bodos who live to the west of the present Kamrup district are called ‘Mec’ by their Hindu neighbours. This word is probably a corruption of the Sanskrit word ‘mleccha’. Nevertheless, Stuart N. Wolfenden observed that some people do self-designate as Mech,\\"(Mech) is used not only by their neighbours but also to some extent by the people themselves.\\" So, he reconstructed Mech from Tibeto-Burman root \\"mi\\" means \\"man\\".\\" As such tribal names are frequently simply words originally meaning \\"man\\", it is not unlikely that the term Mes may go back to this source. In such an event it may be expected to represent me-s, in which me is the same word as Tibetan and Meithei mi 'man', and -s is probably the same suffix as -si in Deori-Chutiya (Sibsagar) ma-si (Lakhimpur dialect mo-si) 'man'.\\" Other authors have speculated that Meche is derived from the Mechi river because the Bodo-Kachari peoples in Nepal had settled around it;\\"Saru Sanyal has writes that a section of the Boros in the course of their movement in Assam moved towards the west along the foothills of Himalayas up to the river Mech between India and Nepal and settled down along the bank of the river and were called Mech after the river.\\" \\"the Bodos, who migrated into India through Patkoi hills...\\" Mecha a region of the Bod country; and descendants of Mechel a legendary figure of Nepal.  Origin  Meches, a part of the Bodo-Kachari people that migrated into India and gradually spread themselves into the whole of Assam, North Bengal and parts of East Bengal. It is said that, during their migration to India, they marched towards different directions.one group went along the river Brahmaputra and established themselves in the whole of Assam up to Goalpara district and parts of Jalpaiguri district and Cooch Behar district under the name of Bodo or Bara. Another group went towards the West along the foot of the Himalayas up to the river Mechi, bordering India and Nepal and settled on the North bank of the river known as Mechi or Mechia. Later they spread to Darjeeling Terai, Baikanthpur in Jalpaiguri district again marched further East and settled in the Dooars. It is said that, a group of Mech people, again moved further East, crossed the Sankosh River, and went towards Goalpara in Assam. Due to repeated floods in Dooars and eastern bank of Teesta river, many families migrated towards Assam. History Tantra Brahmin writers, after converting the Mech kings into Hinduism, named them as Koch as they had admitted Koches to caste Hindu. Some Mech kings converted to Islam. Distribution Mechs are found in West Bengal and Assam in India, and in Nepal. Demand of Mech-Kachari Autonomous Council Presently, there are two types of Mech. One identify themselves with the Boro people and the other identify themselves separately as Mech-Kachari. The Mech-Kacharis want to preserve their language, culture and uplift their economic status; and so they have been demanding a Mech- Kachari autonomous council for some time.

It entered production in slightly modified form in 1936 as the AA. Sports X The Sports X was a concept car shown at the 1961 Tokyo Motor Show. Styling was similar to Italian show cars of the time, with slim pillars and a light roof. A 1900 cc engine was used with other mechanicals based on the Crown. It was not put into production. Airport Limousine The Airport Limousine was a concept car shown at the 1961 Tokyo Motor Show. Based on the Crown, the Airport Limousine was a 6-door wagon that retained the fins and side panels of the Crown sedan. It had three rows of bench seats, allowed seating for 9 people, plus luggage space in the rear section. The 1900cc 3R engine produced at 4600 rpm and at 2600 rpm. The Airport Limousine was not put into production. The similar production Masterline wagon (also based on the Crown) had only 2 doors, 2 rows of bench seats to allow seating for 6 people (plus luggage) and simpler side panels (without fins). Toyota made another 6 door Airport Limousine based on the Crown in 1977. It also failed to make production. Publica Sports The Toyota Publica Sports was a concept car that was developed from the Publica production car. The first public viewing was at the 1962 Tokyo Motor Show. It featured just 2 seats, a small but high revving engine and a sliding canopy for entry. The Publica used a 2-cylinder boxer engine, so the Publica Sports is likely to have used the same engine. It was further developed into the production Sports 800 but without the sliding canopy. The concept featured 1 canopy door that slides backward. Publica Sports Corona 1500S Convertible The Corona 1500S Convertible was a concept car displayed at the 1963 Tokyo Motor Show. The 2-door convertible body was similar to the 4-door Corona RT20 sedan from the waistline down. The 1500 cc engine used a pair of SU carburettors and was connected to a 4-speed, all synchronised manual gearbox. It was not put into production. Corona 1900S Sporty Sedan The Corona 1900S Sporty Sedan was a concept car displayed at the 1963 Tokyo Motor Show. The 1897 cc 3R engine from the Crown was fitted to a Corona RT20 sedan instead of the standard 1500 cc engine, increasing power to . It was not sold in Japan but in 1964 it was sold in the American market as the RT30L Tiara, replacing the identical looking 1500 cc RT20L. Corona Sports Coupe The Corona Sports Coupe was a concept car by Toyota shown at the 1963 Tokyo Motor Show. Although it used the Corona name, it shared little except for the suspension. The body was similar to 2+2 coupes produced by many Italian design houses,http://www.2000gt.net/Prototype1963/Proto1963.php TOYOTA Prototype 1963 (French) with simple, clean lines instead of the more pronounced lines of the 1961 X concept car. Even the front indicators were demurely placed within the front grill next to a pair of single headlights instead of the more usual place under the bumper. The swage line started midway along the door, continued to the rear flanks and then raised up before flowing around the rear corners to form the top rear edge of the boot. Unlike other Toyota models of the time, horizontal rear indicators were used as part of the emerging trend in car design. The engine was the 1897 cc 3R engine from the Crown with twin SU carburettors. Transmission was by a floor shift, 4 speed, fully synchronised manual gearbox. Top speed was 170 km/h. Crown Convertible The 2-door Crown Convertible was displayed at the 1963 Tokyo Motor Show, based on the Crown 1900 sedan. Features included a hydraulically operated folding soft top and electric windows. The 1897 cc 3R engine had dual SU carburettors fitted, raising the power to . Transmission was by a 4-speed column shift manual gearbox. It was not put into production. Dream Car Model The Dream Car Model was a model of a concept car shown at the 1963 Tokyo Motor Show. This was designed as a 'running reception room inside a luxurious cabin'. The body was a cab forward van on a stretched chassis. The top half was completely formed from transparent panels, including the roof. Dream Car The Dream Car was a 2-seater concept sports car shown at the 1964 Tokyo Motor Show. EX-I Designed to show how Japan's new highways could be used, the EX-I was a 2-seater concept sports car shown at the 1969 Tokyo Motor Show. Styling was similar to the Celica released the next year with more emphasis placed on aerodynamics. A roof mounted spoiler was raised and lowered electrically to increase stability at high speed. The interior was ergonomically designed with a wrap around console so that all switches were within easy reach of the driver. Twin exhausts and bonnet scoops hinted at an engine larger than normally used on Japanese cars. EX-II The EX-II was a 2-seater, fully enclosed electric runabout shown at the 1969 Tokyo Motor Show. EX-III Shown at the 1969 Tokyo Motor Show, the EX-III was the big brother of the EX-I. The larger body was even more aerodynamic, being built very low with a pointed front (no bumper), a long bonnet, sharply sloped sides and a tapered rear. Large exhaust outlets hinted at a gas turbine engine but no details were given.

The first detector was started in 1990 and completed in 1998. It was upgraded in 2005 and again starting in 2015 to build the Baikal Gigaton Volume Detector (Baikal-GVD.) BDUNT has studied neutrinos coming through the Earth with results on atmospheric muon flux. BDUNT picks up many atmospheric neutrinos created by cosmic rays interacting with the atmosphere — as opposed to cosmic neutrinos which give clues to cosmic events and are therefore of greater interest to physicists.  Detector history  The start of the Baikal neutrino experiment dates back to 1 October 1980, when a laboratory of high- energy neutrino astrophysics was established at the Institute for Nuclear Research of the former Academy of Sciences of the USSR in Moscow. This laboratory would become the core of the Baikal collaboration. The original NT-200 design was deployed in stages 3.6 km from shore at a depth of 1.1 km. The first part, NT-36 with 36 optical modules (OMs) at 3 short strings, was put into operation and took data up to March 1995. NT-72 ran 1995-1996 then was replaced by the four-string NT-96 array. Over its 700 days of operation, 320,000,000 muon events were collected with NT-36, NT-72, and NT-96. Beginning April 1997, NT-144, a six-string array took data. The full NT-200 array with 192 modules was completed April 1998. In 2004-2005 it was updated to NT-200+ with three additional strings around NT-200 at distance of 100 meters, each with 12 modules. = Baikal-GVD = Since 2015, a 1 cubic km telescope, NT-1000 or Baikal-GVD, is being built.

NASA considered the spacewalk dangerous with potential risk of electrical shock. Since construction started, the International Space Station programme has had to deal with several maintenance issues, unexpected problems and failures. These incidents have affected the assembly timeline, led to periods of reduced capabilities of the station and in some cases could have forced the crew to abandon the space station for safety reasons, had these problems not been resolved. 2003 – Waste accumulation after the Columbia disaster The Columbia disaster did not involve the ISS, but did impact the ISS construction schedule and maintenance. The disaster on 1 February 2003 (during STS-107, a non-ISS mission) resulted in a two-and-a-half-year suspension of the US Space Shuttle program. Another one-year suspension following STS-114 (because of continued foam shedding on the external tank) led to some uncertainty about the future of the International Space Station. All crew exchanges between February 2003 and July 2006 were carried out using the Russian Soyuz spacecraft; a STS-114 visit in July 2005 was purely logistical. Starting with Expedition 7, caretaker crews of just two astronauts were launched, in contrast to the previously launched crews of three. Because the ISS had not been visited by a space shuttle for over three years, more waste had accumulated than anticipated, which temporarily hindered station operations in 2004. Automated Progress transports and the STS-114 mission were able to eliminate this waste build-up. 2004 – Air leak and Elektron oxygen generator failure On 2 January 2004, a minor air leak was detected on board the ISS. At one point, five pounds of air per day were leaking into space and the internal pressure of the ISS dropped from nominal 14.7 psi down to 14.0 psi, although this did not pose an immediate threat to Michael Foale and Aleksandr Kaleri, the two astronauts on board. Using an ultrasonic probe (CTRL UL101), Foale traced the leak on Sunday 10 January to a vacuum jumper hose connected to a multipaned window in the US segment of the station. The search for the leak had been hampered by noise emitted from scientific equipment on board. Successful identification and repair of the leak narrowly averted a planned lock down of the station in an attempt to isolate the leak, which would have affected station operations. Experts believe the leak was caused by astronauts using the hose as a handhold. In this same year, 2004, the Elektron unit shut down due to (initially) unknown causes. Two weeks of troubleshooting resulted in the unit starting up again, then immediately shutting down. The cause was eventually traced to gas bubbles in the unit, which remained non-functional until a Progress resupply mission in October 2004. In 2005 ISS personnel tapped into the oxygen supply of the recently arrived Progress resupply ship, when the Elektron unit failed. 2005 – Elektron oxygen generator fails again Early on January 1, 2005, the Elektron generator, repaired in 2004, failed again, and the crew had to rely again on onboard oxygen. 2006 – Venting of gas On 18 September 2006, the Expedition 13 crew activated a smoke alarm in the Russian segment of the International Space Station when fumes from one of the three Elektron oxygen generators triggered momentary fear about a possible fire. The crew initially reported a smell in the cabin. The alarm was later found to be caused by a leak of potassium hydroxide from an oxygen vent. The associated equipment was turned off, and officials said there was no fire and the crew was not in any danger. The station's ventilation system was shut down to prevent the possibility of spreading smoke or contaminants through the rest of the complex. A charcoal air filter was put in place to scrub the atmosphere of any lingering potassium hydroxide fumes. The space station's programme manager said the crew never donned gas masks, but as a precaution put on surgical gloves and masks to prevent contact with any contaminants. On 2 November 2006, the payload brought by the Russian Progress M-58 allowed the crew to repair the Elektron using spare parts. 2007 – Computer failure On 14 June 2007, during Expedition 15 and flight day 7 of STS-117's visit to ISS, a computer malfunction on the Russian segments at 06:30 UTC left the station without thrusters, oxygen generation, carbon dioxide scrubber, and other environmental control systems, causing the temperature on the station to rise. A successful restart of the computers resulted in a false fire alarm that woke the crew at 11:43 UTC. By 15 June, the primary Russian computers were back online, and communicating with the US side of the station by bypassing a circuit, but secondary systems remained offline. NASA reported that without the computer that controls the oxygen levels, the station had 56 days of oxygen available. By the afternoon of 16 June, ISS Program Manager Michael Suffredini confirmed that all six computers governing command and navigation systems for Russian segments of the station, including two thought to have failed, were back online and would be tested over several days. The cooling system was the first system brought back online. Troubleshooting of the failure by the ISS crew found that the root cause was condensation inside the electrical connectors, which led to a short-circuit that triggered the power off command to all three of the redundant processing units. This was initially a concern because the European Space Agency uses the same computer systems, supplied by EADS Astrium Space Transportation, for the Columbus laboratory module and the Automated Transfer Vehicle. Once the cause of the malfunction was understood, plans were implemented to avoid the problem in the future. 2007 – Torn solar panel Damage to the 4B wing of the P6 solar array found when it was redeployed after being moved to its final position on STS-120. On 30 October 2007, during Expedition 16 and flight day 7 of STS-120's visit to ISS, following the repositioning of the P6 truss segment, ISS and crew members began the deployment of the two solar arrays on the truss. The first array deployed without incident, and the second array deployed about 80% before astronauts noticed a 76-centimetre (2.5 ft) tear. The arrays had been deployed in earlier phases of the space station's construction, and the retraction necessary to move the truss to its final position had gone less smoothly than planned. A second, smaller tear was noticed upon further inspection, and the mission's spacewalks were replanned in order to devise a repair. Normally, such spacewalks take several months to plan and are settled upon well in advance. On 3 November, spacewalker Scott Parazynski, assisted by Douglas Wheelock, fixed the torn panels using makeshift cufflinks and riding on the end of the Space Shuttle's OBSS inspection arm. Parazynski was the first ever spacewalker to use the robotic arm in this way. The spacewalk was regarded as significantly more dangerous than most because of the possibility of shock from the electricity generating solar arrays, the unprecedented usage of the OBSS, and the lack of spacewalk planning and training for the impromptu procedure. Parazynski was, however, able to repair the damage as planned, and the repaired array was fully deployed. Also, the OBSS will be left on the International Space Station because of its demonstrated versatility and ability to be left on the station for longer periods of time. 2007 – Damaged starboard Solar Alpha Rotary Joint During STS-120, a problem was detected in the starboard Solar Alpha Rotary Joint (SARJ). This joint, together with a similar device on the port side of the station's truss structure, rotates the large solar arrays to keep them facing the Sun. Excessive vibration and high- current spikes in the array drive motor were noted, resulting in a decision to substantially curtail motion of the starboard SARJ until the cause was understood. Inspections during EVAs on STS-120 and STS-123 showed extensive contamination from metallic shavings and debris in the large drive gear and confirmed damage to the large metallic race ring at the heart of the joint. The station had sufficient operating power to carry out its near-term programme with only modest impacts on operations, so to prevent further damage, the joint was locked in place. On 25 September 2008, NASA announced significant progress in diagnosing the source of the starboard SARJ problem and a programme to repair it on orbit. The repair programme began with the flight of the on STS-126. The crew carried out servicing of both the starboard and port SARJs, lubricating both joints and replacing 11 of 12 trundle bearings on the starboard SARJ. It was hoped that this servicing would provide a temporary solution to the problem. A long-term solution is a 10-EVA plan called 'SARJ-XL', which calls for the installation of structural supports between the two segments of the SARJ and a new race ring to be inserted between them to completely replace the failed joint. However, following the cleaning and lubrication of the joint, the results that have been noted so far have been extremely encouraging, to the point that it is now believed that the joint could be maintained by occasional servicing EVAs by resident station crews. Nevertheless, the data from the SARJ will require some time to fully analyse before a decision as to the future of the joint is made. 2009 – Excessive vibration during reboost On 14 January 2009, an incorrect command sequence caused the Zvezda service module orbital altitude maintenance rocket propulsion control system to misfire during an altitude re-boost manoeuvre. This resulted in resonant vibrations into the station structure which persisted for over two minutes. While no damage to the station was immediately reported, some components may have been stressed beyond their design limits. Further analysis confirmed that the station was unlikely to have suffered any structural damage, and it appears that \\"structures will still meet their normal lifetime capability\\". Further evaluations are under way. 2009 – Potential ammonia leak from S1 radiator due to damaged panel The damaged S1 radiator on the ISS starboard truss. The S1-3 radiator has a damaged cooling panel that may require on-orbit repair or replacement, as the damage may have the potential to create a leak in the External Thermal Control System (ETCS) of the station, possibly leading to unacceptable loss of the ammonia coolant. There are six such radiators, three on the starboard truss, and three on the port truss, each consisting of 8 panels. They appear as the large white pleated objects extending in the aft direction from the trusses, between the central habitable modules and the large solar panel arrays at the ends of the truss structure, and control the temperature of the ISS by dumping excess heat to space. The panels are double-sided, and radiate from both sides, with ammonia circulating between the top and bottom surfaces. The problem was first noticed in Soyuz imagery in September 2008, but was not thought to be serious. The imagery showed that the surface of one sub-panel has peeled back from the underlying central structure, possibly due to micro-meteoroid or debris impact. It is also known that a Service Module thruster cover, jettisoned during a spacewalk in 2008, had struck the S1 radiator, but its effect, if any, has not been determined. Further imagery during the fly-around from STS-119 raised concerns that structural fatigue, due to thermal cycling stress, could cause a serious leak to develop in the ammonia cooling loop, although there is as yet no evidence of a leak or of degradation in the thermal performance of the panel. Various options for repair are under consideration, including replacement of the entire S1 radiator in a future flight, possibly with return of the damaged unit to ground for detailed study. On 15 May 2009, the damaged radiator panel's ammonia tubing was mechanically shut off from the ETCS, by the computer-controlled closure of a valve. The same valve was used immediately afterwards to vent the ammonia from the damaged panel. This eliminates the possibility of an ammonia leak from the cooling system via the damaged panel. 2010 – Failure in cooling loop A  Early on 1 August 2010, a failure in cooling Loop A (starboard side), one of two external cooling loops, left the station with only half of its normal cooling capacity and zero redundancy in some systems.\\"Problem forces partial powerdown aboard station\\"\\"NASA ISS On-Orbit Status 1 August 2010 (early edition)\\"\\"ISS Active Control System\\" The problem appeared to be in the ammonia pump module that circulates the ammonia cooling fluid. Several subsystems, including two of the four CMGs, were shut down. The failed ammonia pump was returned to Earth during STS-135 to undergo root cause failure analysis. Planned operations on the ISS were interrupted through a series of EVAs to address the cooling system issue. A first EVA on Saturday, 7 August 2010, to replace the failed pump module, was not fully completed due to an ammonia leak in one of four quick-disconnects. A second EVA on Wednesday, 11 August, successfully removed the failed pump module.Spaceflight Now \\"Wednesday spacewalk to remove failed coolant pump\\"NASA spaceflight 11 Aug \\"Large success for second EVA as failed Pump Module is removed\\" A third EVA was required to restore Loop A to normal functionality.Spaceflight Now 12 Aug \\"Station's bad pump removed; more spacewalking ahead\\"Spaceflight Now, 18 Aug ISS cooling configuration returning to normal confirming ETCS PM success 2011 – Near collision with space debris On 28 June 2011, an unidentified object was seen flying near the space station. The object flew by at a relative velocity of and a distance of only from the station. The six-person crew immediately boarded the Soyuz capsules and closed the hatches on the station as well as on the Soyuz. They were near undocking when the all-clear signal was given, meaning that the danger has passed and the crew can reboard the station. This kind of incident has happened several times, and the crew would perform a debris avoidance maneuver should the situation arise. Space Station Has Near Miss with Debris, New York Times 2011–2012 – Failure of Main Bus Switching Unit #1 and replacement EVA The four Main Bus Switching Units (MBSUs, located in the S0 truss), control the routing of power from the four solar array wings to the rest of the ISS. In late 2011 MBSU-1, while still routing power correctly, ceased responding to commands or sending data confirming its health, and was scheduled to be swapped out at the next available EVA. In each MBSU, two power channels feed 160V DC from the arrays to two DC-to-DC power converters (DDCUs) that supply the 124V power used in the station. A spare MBSU was already on board, but the Aug 30 2012 EVA failed to be completed when a bolt being tightened to finish installation of the spare unit jammed before electrical connection was secured. The loss of MBSU-1 limited the station to 75% of its normal power capacity, requiring minor limitations of normal operations until the issue was addressed. A second EVA to tighten the balky bolt, to complete the installation of the replacement MBSU-1 in an attempt to restore full power, was scheduled for Wednesday, 5 September. Yet in the meantime, a third solar array wing went offline due to some fault in that array's Direct Current Switching Unit (DCSU) or its associated system, further reducing ISS power to just five of the eight solar array wings for the first time in several years. On 5 September 2012, in a second, 6 hr, EVA to replace MBSU-1, astronauts Suni Williams and Aki Hoshide successfully restored the ISS to 100% power. 2012 – Failure of primary Carbon Dioxide Removal Assembly (CDRA)  The ISS has two rack sized CDRAs (Carbon Dioxide Removal Assemblies) for redundancy with the Lab CDRA primary and the Node 3 CDRA as a powered off backup because of issues with sticking valves in the Node 3. It can step in as a backup if necessary but is not the preferred CDRA because of the problems with the sticking Air Selector Valves (ASVs). The Russian segment has its own carbon dioxide scrubbers but they are not sufficient for the whole of the ISS. On the 16th June 2012 the lab CDRA suddenly shut down. This problem was traced to a failure of the second of three temperature sensors (the first one had failed previously) and it was quickly restored. However it soon shut down again, on the 20th June due to erratic data from the one remaining temperature sensor. ISS decided to put the Lab CDRA into standby and activate the Node 3 CDRA instead, even with its valve sticking issues. 2013 – Ammonia Leak and CDRA issues again On 9 May 2013, at around 10:30 a.m. CDT, the ISS crew reported seeing small white flakes floating away from the Station’s truss structure.\\"Ammonia Leak Outside Station; Crew in No Danger\\" NASA.gov May 9th, 2013. Analysis of the crew reports and images captured by external cameras confirmed a leak of ammonia coolant. Two days later a spacewalk was undertaken in order to inspect and possibly replace a pump controller box suspected of leaking.\\"Spacewalk Under Way to Repair Ammonia Leak\\" NASA.gov, May 11th, 2013. In early September one of the Air Selector Valves in the CDRA was removed and replaced, but problems with sticking valves persisted, and Node 3 had to be restarted several times. The ISS at this point had no new ASVs to install, so if more further issues arose, it would have to rely on reinstalling previously used valves which they retained as \\"contingency\\" backups, which are in a degraded state. 2018 – Leak in Soyuz Orbital Module On 29 August 2018, at 7:00 p.m. EDT, a small pressure leak was observed in the Russian segment of the ISS. The crew were allowed to sleep as mission controllers determined there was no danger to them, and investigation the following day revealed a 2mm hole near the hatch of the Soyuz spacecraft. The hole was temporarily covered with Kapton tape, and then with an on-board patch kit. Neither was sufficient to completely plug the leak. Sealant was later applied, which finally stabilised the station's pressure.\\"Astronauts find hole in the International Space Station, plug it with thumb\\", Jackson Ryan, CNET August 30, 2018 The hole was identified as a drill hole made by an \\"unsteady hand\\", potentially during manufacturing or when already in orbit, according to Roscosmos chief Dmitry Rogozin. 2019–2020 – Pressure leak In September 2019, a higher-than-normal air leak was detected on the station. In August 2020, after the leak had slightly increased, ISS crew started investigating the issue. On 29 September 2020 the leak was isolated in the Zvezda Service Module.

Strong fictionalism about possible worlds According to strong fictionalism about possible worlds (another name for strong modal fictionalism), the following bi-conditionals are necessary and specify the truth-conditions for certain cases of modal claims: # It is possible that P iff the translation of P into the language of a fiction F (containing possible worlds) holds according to F. # It is necessary that P iff the translation of P into the language of a fiction F (containing possible worlds) always holds. Recent supporters of this view added further specifications of these bi- conditionals to counter certain objections. In the case of claims of possibility, the revised bi-conditional is thus spelled out: (1.1) it is possible that P iff At this universe, presently, the translation of P into the language of a fiction F holds according to F.Seahwa Kim, 'Modal Fictionalism and Analysis', in Mark Kalderon (ed.) Fictionalism in Metaphysics (Oxford: Clarendon Press), pp. 116-33. Timid fictionalism about possible worlds According to a timid version of fictionalism about possible worlds, our possible worlds can be properly understood as involving reference to a fiction, but the aforementioned bi-conditionals should not be taken as an analysis of certain cases of modality. Objections and criticisms * The Brock/Rosen objection * Artificiality This objection can be spelled out in at least two ways: artificiality as contingency or artificiality as lack of accessibility.Andrea Sauchelli, 'Modal Fictionalism, Possible Worlds, and Artificiality', Acta Analytica (forthcoming) * Hale dilemma * Incompleteness * Fictional fetishism See also * Fictionalism References * \\"Modal fictionalism\\" at the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy * \\"Modal Fictionalism and Possible Worlds Semantics\\" at the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy * Gideon Rosen, 'Modal Fictionalism', Mind, 99, 395 (1990), pp. 327–354. * Seahwa Kim, 'Modal Fictionalism and Analysis', in Mark Eli Kalderon (ed.), Fictionalism in Metaphysics (Oxford:Oxford University Press, 2005), pp. 116–33. * Andrea Sauchelli, 'Modal Fictionalism, Possible Worlds, and Artificiality', Acta Analytica (forthcoming) Category:Theories of deduction Category:Possible worlds Category:Metaphysical theories ","title":"Modal fictionalism"},{"id":"22885044","text":"Howard Sydney Musgrave Coster (27 April 1885 – 17 November 1959) was a British photographer, opening a London studio in 1926.

After serving in the RAF during World War I he worked in a studio in South Africa where he met his future wife Joan Burr (1903-1974), who was also a photographer. In 1926, on his return from South Africa with his wife, Coster opened a studio at 8 and 9 Essex Street, off the Strand. Unusually, his studio was dedicated solely to the photography of men, following the example of the American photographer Pirie MacDonald, and he became known as \\"the photographer of men\\". His business was successful from the start and by the 1930s Coster had undertaken several commissions for portraits including those of British royalty such as King George V as well as successful writers, including John Galsworthy, J. B. Priestley, as well as one of his most iconic images, A. A. Milne with his son Christopher Robin Milne and Pooh Bear, at Cotchford Farm, their home in Sussex. The UK National Portrait Gallery holds five portraits of Coster, one by Eric Gill. There are over 9000 portraits by Coster in their collection, including those of G. K.

The club was founded in 1891. In 1995 the club was purchased by the English Golf Union, who have since relocated their headquarters onto the site, which is now known as The National Golf Centre. Woodhall Spa has two golf courses. The original course, now known as ‘The Hotchkin’, which opened in 1905 and was originally laid out by Harry Vardon before being redesigned by Stafford Vere Hotchkin in the 1920s, and ‘The Bracken’, designed by Donald Steel which opened in 1998. The club has hosted many prestigious amateur championships including the English Amateur and the Brabazon Trophy on several occasions. History Course layout circa 1936 Approach to 3rd green (Hotchkin) 11th hole from the green (Hotchkin) Par 3 12th hole from tee (Hotchkin) 13th hole from the tee (Hotchkin) 14th fairway from green (Hotchkin) Golf started at Woodhall Spa in 1890 when a nine-hole course opened for play. The club was founded in the following year. In 1902 landowner and member, Stafford Vere Hotchkin, offered an expanse of land off Horncastle Road for the building of an 18-hole golf course. The course remains on this site today. Harry Vardon was employed to design the course. The official opening took place on 30 June 1905 and included an exhibition match between Harry Vardon, James Braid and J.H. Taylor. Harry Colt redesigned the course between 1911 and 1914. In 1919, following a distinguished military career during the First World War, Colonel Stafford Vere Hotchkin MC returned and took over the running of the club. He was an accomplished golf course architect in his own right and remodelled many of the holes during the 1920s adding seventeen new greens. Only one of the original greens was retained (the 6th) but this was approached from a different direction. The course as it stands today remains largely his original design. Following his death in 1953 his son Neil Hotchkin continued to run the course as a close-knit private members club where professionals had to be invited to play. He was a faithful supporter of amateur golf and served as President of the English Golf Union in 1972. He resided at Womersley House, a large detached property off Horncastle Road adjacent to the third tee. Neil Hotchkin wished to protect and secure the future of the club as a home for amateur golf. In 1995 he sold the club and course to the English Golf Union. The EGU built a second 18-hole course (‘The Bracken’) which opened for play in 1998. The original course was then renamed ‘The Hotchkin’. The Hotchkin Course The course is set in heathland with sandy subsoil, extensive swathes of heather and mixed foliage including birch and pine. It is generally regarded as one of the finest inland golf courses in the British Isles. The Hotchkin is renowned for its well placed deep bunkers. The bunkers surrounding the greens at the fourth and twelfth holes are especially cavernous. Awards and Acclaim The Hotchkin course is often included in rankings of the best golf courses in the world. Golf Magazine and Golf Digest both rank the Hotchkin course as one of the top 100 courses in the world. Golf Magazine ranked the Hotchkin course as the 54th best in the world in its rankings for 2020–21. Tony Jacklin's formative years were spent in Lincolnshire and although he often played the Hotchkin course, both as an amateur and professional golfer, he never managed to score better than 70. Jacklin once told his friend Tom Weiskopf that at the outset of his golfing career he had three specific ambitions: \\"To win the Open Championship, to win the US Open and to break 70 at Woodhall Spa\\". Jacklin then said \\"Two out of three ain’t bad!\\" Weiskopf went on to become a highly regarded golf course designer and later admitted he always tried to incorporate aspects of the Hotchkin course into his own designs. \\"Tony Jacklin took me there once and I fell in love with the place. Now when I’m designing a course I try to remember something subtle from Woodhall, the fold of the land, the bunkering – even the fact that you can always see the top of the flagstick. There’s a bit of Woodhall Spa in every course I build\\". In 1972 the golfing correspondent David Davies reflected: \\"Give several golfers seven days to live and the opportunity to play, for the last time, seven difficult golf courses in that week, and it is fairly safe to say that Woodhall Spa would be on the list of ones who have played it. It is one of those courses that captivates instantly, and, better, improves with acquaintance. It is a course of great beauty and one of the finest tests of the game in the British Isles\\". It is a favourite course of Mark James, who won the English Amateur Championship when it was held at the club in 1974.

Characteristics Members of the Cryomonadida are single-celled organisms that are surrounded by a shell comprising layers of organic material. They possess two unequally long flagella, and a single nucleus with a distinct nucleolus. They have a laterally located cytostome, from which pseudopodia arise. Systematics The order Cryomonadida was erected in 1993 for the genus Cryothecomonas. In 2005, Sina Adl et al. did not include the order in their classification, but placed the genus incertae sedis among the Cercozoa. It became clear, however, that other genera, and taxa known only from environmental DNA, belonged in this group, and so in 2008 Jan Pawlowski placed the Cryomonadida as part of the core Cercozoa.

The units are located east of Chico along Butte Creek in northern California. This stretch of Butte Creek is spawning habitat for the largest population of Central Valley spring-run Chinook salmon, an evolutionarily significant unit that is listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. Fall-run Chinook salmon and steelhead trout also spawn in the creek. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife considers the Butte Creek Canyon Ecological Reserve valuable in terms of providing wildlife habitat and protection of critical shaded riverine and aquatic resources.Butte Creek Revegetation and Restoration Assessment Project-CSU, Chico Research Foundation/Watershed Projects, CSU, Chico (Butte CrER.PDF) pp 1-2 The Butte Creek population of Central Valley spring-run Chinook salmon is the largest and one of the few remaining self-sustaining populations in the Central Valley, and is listed as threatened under both the state and federal endangered species acts.Ecosystem Restoration: Spring-run Chinook Salmon in Butte Creek p.1 The reserves protect habitat for other species such as bald eagle, Swainson's hawk, beaver and the western pond turtle.

This unit has a high amount of non-native grasses (over 40 per cent) and several sensitive or rare plants, including California black walnut (Juglans hindsii) and shield-bracted monkey flower (Mimulus glaucescens). =Virgin Valley Unit= This unit is in size and is also managed by CDFW. It is one half mile downstream from the Butte Creek canyon mouth on an alluvial apron. This unit contains forests of valley oak (Quercus lobata) growing on streamside terraces and on the alluvial aggregate. =Honey Run Unit= This unit is managed by Chico State University Research Foundation in cooperation with other agencies and is located within the Butte Creek canyon proper. It is in size. The area of Butte Creek had been used in dredge mining from the 1800s to about 1950, and mining for sand and gravel from the 1950s to the 1970s. In 1980, a cluster development project of 75 condominiums was approved for the site by the Butte County Planning Commission and the Board of Supervisors. The project was stopped by concerned local citizens with a successful ballot initiative that overturned the Butte County decision. The flood of 1986, which caused more than $13 million damage in Butte County, washed out the two bridge crossings on Butte Creek and helped start the preservation sequence of events. The bridges connected to the haul road that went from the gravel mining sites to Baldwin Construction's plant. Soon after the historic flood, the mining company sold its properties, with some parcels being bought by the California Department of Fish and Game, and one parcel (the Honey Run unit) being bought by John McAmis. McAmis contracted for a subdivision of single family homes, which was voted down by the Planning Commission, but a subsequent development plan was submitted and approved. After construction began on the property, local concerns were again raised which eventually led to McAmis willingly selling the property to Chico State University, Research Foundation.Management Plan p.5 In 1998, CSU, Chico Research Foundation bought the parcel from McAmis with support from CSU's Office of Watershed Projects, and funds from National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, Wildlife Conservation Board, CALFED and US Fish and Wildlife Service. \\"Grand Opening of the Honey Run Unit Butte Creek Ecological Preserve\\" Nov. 3, 1999 CSU, Chico News  Butte Creek House Ecological Reserve  The Butte Creek House Ecological Reserve is located at the headwaters of Butte Creek.

The fish count of Chinook salmon in 1987 was 14. The number counted in 1998 was 20,000. During the period 1994 through 1997, several agricultural structures were removed, fish screens were installed and a new fish ladder was also installed. In addition, a minimum streamflow rate of is maintained from October 1 to June 30.Butte Creek Revegetation and Restoration Assessmant Project p.3 \\"The spring run in Butte Creek is doing exceptionally well. \\"For the fish, it's a success story...\\", according to the California Department of Fish and Game's Harry Morse. Other restoration work has been the removal of invasive plant species including star thistle, scotch broom and Himalayan blackberry. Non-native plants can displace the native species, which may decrease biodiversity and cause a loss of habitat that provide nest sites and food sources. The riparian or streamside plant areas along Butte Creek are the most vulnerable to invasive non-native plants.

Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management (VDIM) is an integrated vehicle handling and software control system developed by Toyota. It involves an omnibus computer linkage of traction control, electronic stability control, electronic steering, and other systems, with the intent of improving responsiveness to driver input, performance, and overall safety. The system was first introduced in the Japanese domestic market in July 2004, when Toyota debuted VDIM on the Toyota Crown Majesta.http://www.toyota- global.com/company/history_of_toyota/75years/data/automotive_business/products_technology/technology_development/electronics_parts/index.html This was followed by the VDIM's export debut on the third generation Lexus GS, which was launched in 2005. VDIM integrates the company's Electronically Controlled Brake (ECB), Anti-Lock Brakes (ABS), Electronic Brakeforce Distribution (EBD), Traction Control (TRC) and Vehicle Stability Control (VSC) active safety systems with the Adaptive Variable Suspension (AVS), Electric Power Steering (EPS) and Variable Gear Ratio Steering (VGRS) systems which previously worked independently using proprietary software. This way all the systems function together rather than the ECU prioritizing which is the most important. VDIM was initially designed for rear-wheel drive cars.Safety first: VDIM puts Toyota at the head of the safety technology pack in Japan VDIM's capabilities expand upon Toyota's stand-alone Vehicle Stability Control (VSC) system which was introduced in 1995; VSC remains the baseline electronic stability control system used by the company. VSC by definition does not intervene until after a skid is detected, while VDIM takes measures to prevent skids, slides, or wheel spins rather than just take action after tire slippage has occurred. This is done by constantly making corrections in a subtle manner that are transparent to the driver. In further contrast with VSC, VDIM can also calibrate driver steering input according to vehicle speed, with active steering and throttle adjustments to improve ride quality and directional control during performance driving, such as in slalom courses.Autobytel Avoiding Accidents - VDIM With the EPS system VDIM instantly varies the amount of power steering assist depending on driving conditions.The Latest Innovations in Safety - 5 to Drive In vehicles equipped with Variable Gear Ratio Steering (VGRS), VDIM also manages steering gear ratios to help the driver maintain control. Initially, the system was only offered on vehicles equipped with Electronically Controlled Brake (ECB), but this is no longer required.

Grassmann is the author of four books and more than 250 scientific publications, and is the founder and managing director of the research company Isomorph srl. His main contributions to physics include the development of a (Tl) calorimeter with a photodiode; developing the analysis of asymmetry in the production of the W particle; a contribution to the discovery of the top quark, the development of a physics theory of information; the design and development of a wind turbine with an external duct; and the realization of the linear mirror for the concentration of solar energy. Grassmann has worked in Italy since 1988. Life and workStudy of physics= From 1979 to 1984, Grassmann studied physics at the University of Erlangen and the University of Hamburg. For his laurea thesis, he developed a detection method for high energy photons using a scintillating crystal (CsI(Tl)) calorimeter with photodiode readout. Advanced scientific experiments make use of this technology, including the Crystal-Barrel, the BaBar, the CLEO, the Belle experiments and the Glast satellite. From 1984 to 1988, Grassmann was part of the UA1 experiment at CERN in Geneva, where he wrote his PhD thesis. From 1987 to 1999, Grassmann worked with the CDF collaboration at the Tevatron collider in the Fermi National Laboratory (Fermilab), close to Chicago and at the Superconducting Super Collider laboratory (Dallas). In 1988 with his student, S. Leone, he developed the study of the asymmetry in production and decay of the W-boson at the Tevatron proton–antiproton collider. W bosons are predominantly produced in collisions of valence quarks; therefore, one can determine the kinematic properties of the up and down quarks in the proton and antiproton from the observation of W production. By analyzing the relative difference in the production of W+ and W− particles, one can substantially reduce the effects of systematic uncertainties in the experimental device. Since 1988, Grassmann has developed a method for detecting the top quark. The method makes use of the different kinematic properties of production and decay of top quark particles and background events, such as the production of W particles together with hadronic jets. In 1994, this analysis was successfully applied by Grassmann, G. Bellettini and M. Cobal. The top quark was observed in Tevatron collider data. These results were confirmed when the analysis was repeated on a larger data sample. After the top quark discovery, Grassmann worked on a connection between the classic information theory of Claude Shannon, Gregory Chaitin and Andrey Kolmogorov et al. and physics. From work done by Leó Szilárd, Rolf Landauer and Charles H. Bennett, there is a connection between physics and information theory. Storing or deleting one bit of information dissipates energy; however, neither classic information theory nor algorithmic information theory contain any physics variables. The variable entropy used in information theory is not a state function; therefore, it is not the thermodynamic entropy used in physics. Grassmann made use of existing and established concepts, such as message, amount of information or complexity, but set them in a new mathematical framework. His approach is based on vector algebra or on Boolean algebra instead of probability theory. =Renewable Energies= Grassmann also developed an approach for studying shrouded wind turbines. The Linear mirror In 2006 Isomorph undertook the development of a system of mirrors - the so-called Linear mirror - for the concentration of solar energy. This system is a very simple and therefore inexpensive structure, which allows to create a full-scale prototype without the need of outside partners. In 'October 2008, the Linear mirror received its first award from the Italian Physical Society, which honors Alessandro Prest, an employee of the Isomorph, for the presentation of the project. The mirror came into operation for the first time in autumn 2008, fulfilling all the expectations. In July 2010 the first Linear mirror was installed by the town of Pontebbahttp://www.comune.pontebba.ud.it/Progetto-specchio- lineare.3774.0.html?&L;=0titolo=Progetto specchio lineare) to provide thermal energy to the local kindergarten. In the same year the town of Pontebba successfully participated to the National contest for the election of the most virtuous municipalities. In April 2011 Hans Grassmann has received the \\"Nuclear-Free Future Award, with the motivation that the Linear mirror can be able to contribute to the replacement of nuclear power. In May 2012 the Linear mirror received the Solar keymark certificate by CERTCO DIN (DIN EN 12795-1:2006-06 and DIN EN 12795-2:2006-06). Tests for the Solar Keymark were carried out by the Fraunhofer Institute ISE Freiburg.http://www.isomorph.it/solutions/renewable-energies/solar- thermal/resolveuid/1da56c7c5ff66e2ca6b054dd73d937e0 =Entrepreneurship= In 2004, Grassmann founded Isomorph, which creates scientific concepts, procedures and devices based on physics research. Isomorph's research is independent of the scientific-administrative complex. Isomorph developed an innovative concentrating mirror system to make economic use of solar energy. It is a simple system and cheap to produce.A. Prest, H.

He began his career as a stage actor in St. Louis in the early 1930s and in 1939 began an opera career. He was notably a member of the New York City Opera between 1945 and 1959 during which time he performed in more than 1,300 performances with the company in over 50 roles. Biography Newman was born and raised in St. Louis, Missouri. He began his career as an actor at the Missouri Theater Company, portraying primarily nonmusical roles during the early 1930s. In the mid-1930s he started taking singing lessons with the intent of becoming an opera singer. In 1939 he joined the roster at the St. Louis Grand Opera Association. Between 1939 and 1943 he sang a number of secondary roles with the company, including parts in productions of Otello, Rigoletto, La Traviata, Tosca, Manon, Martha, and Mignon. During these years he and his wife, Helen Wright, were featured singers on the St. Louis radio station KMOX, where they presented a weekly program of vocal duets. In the early 1940s Newman also sang with the International Opera of Havana and with the St. Louis Chamber Opera. Newman made his New York City debut on Broadway with the New Opera Company portraying Mr. Hutchinson in Jacques Offenbach's La Vie parisienne on January 12, 1945. Just a few months later he joined the roster of singers at the New York City, making his debut with the company in April 1945 as Schaunard in Giacomo Puccini's La Boheme. He maintained a busy schedule performing with the NYCO for the next fifteen years in mainly supporting comic roles like Sacristan in Tosca and Antonio in Le nozze di Figaro. Some of his other roles included Masetto in Don Giovanni, several different roles in Der Rosenkavalier, and Escamillo in Carmen. He also sang in a number of world premieres with the company, including Chennoch in David Tamkin's The Dybbuk (1951) and The Doctor in Mark Bucci's Tale for a Deaf Ear (1958). In addition to his work with the NYCO, Newman also sang several small roles on a number of recordings for RCA, including Verdi's Otello and La Traviata with conductor Arturo Toscanini. After Newman left the NYCO in 1959, he joined the voice faculty at Wichita State University in Kansas. He notably taught the bass Samuel Ramey during his tenure there. In 1973 Newman retired. He died in Scottsdale, Arizona at the age of 92.

A random sample from this process is an infinite discrete probability distribution, consisting of an infinite set of atoms drawn from G0, with weights drawn from a two-parameter Poisson–Dirichlet distribution. The process is named after Jim Pitman and Marc Yor. The parameters governing the Pitman-Yor process are: 0 ≤ d < 1 a discount parameter, a strength parameter θ > −d and a base distribution G0 over a probability space X. When d = 0, it becomes the Dirichlet process. The discount parameter gives the Pitman-Yor process more flexibility over tail behavior than the Dirichlet process, which has exponential tails. This makes Pitman-Yor process useful for modeling data with power-law tails (e.g., word frequencies in natural language). The exchangeable random partition induced by the Pitman–Yor process is an example of a Poisson–Kingman partition, and of a Gibbs type random partition. Naming conventions The name \\"Pitman–Yor process\\" was coined by Ishwaran and James after Pitman and Yor's review on the subject. However the process was originally studied in Perman et al. It is also sometimes referred to as the two-parameter Poisson–Dirichlet process, after the two-parameter generalization of the Poisson–Dirichlet distribution which describes the joint distribution of the sizes of the atoms in the random measure, sorted by strictly decreasing order.

The transfer was approved by the FCC on April 30, 1998, and the transaction was consummated on May 6, 1998. KIRK received its license to cover from the FCC on September 28, 1998. On February 28, 2007, the Shepherd Group announced they had reached an agreement to sell KIRK to Dean Radio.TV (Dean Goodman, president/CEO) through its GoodRadio.TV, LLC, holding company as part of a 16-station deal valued at a reported $30.6 million. The deal was approved by the FCC on May 9, 2007, and the transaction was consummated on August 8, 2007.

This innovative surveillance system is based on the voluntary online participation of the population who, on a weekly basis, respond to an internet questionnaire about flu symptoms. During the winter 2003/2004 season, the Netherlands and Belgium launched the first Influenzanet - De Grote Griepmeting \\\\- which attracted over 30,000 participants in the first year. The Dutch Great Influenza Survey has been carried out yearly since then. It was implemented in Portugal for the 2005/2006 season; this was followed by the Italians with Influweb in 2008, and then by the French version called GrippeNet in 2012. With the threat of a new pandemic influenza, three other countries joined this project in 2009, with the implementation of Gripenet Brazile,http://www.gripenet.com.br in Brasil; Reporta in Mexico; and the Flusurvey in the United Kingdom. In Australia and New Zealand, a comparable project called Flutracking started in 2006. \\"Flutrackers\\" complete a 10 - 15 second online survey about flu-like symptoms.

How it works ILI Incidence curves generated by the Influenzanet, in the 2008-2009 flu season, in Portugal, The Netherlands and Belgium Any resident of the participating countries can register by completing an online application form containing various medical, geographic, and behavioural questions. Every week during the flu season, participants are asked to select from a list of symptoms the ones they have experienced since their previous visit to the website. Participation is stimulated by email newsletters, online educational materials, competitions and presentations, and other educational activities. A case of ILI is defined based on a set of reported symptoms: acute onset of fever of >=38 °C, plus muscle pain, plus one of the following: cough, sore throat, and/or chest pain. The daily incidence of ILI is determined by the number of participants with an onset. The results of the influenzanet closely matches the official European Influenza Surveillance Scheme data.

The executive power of the state is vested in him as the monarch of the state. The current sultan, Muhammad V, is the 29th Sultan of Kelantan. He is the Head of Islam in the state and the source of all titles, honours and dignities of its people. He was the 15th Yang di-Pertuan Agong. His reign as the monarch and head of state of Malaysia or Yang di-Pertuan Agong began on 13 December 2016, after his election on 14 October 2016 at the 243th (special) Conference of Rulers.Nst History Kelantan was historically a powerful state with trade links with early Chinese, Indian and Siamese civilisations. After being a tributary of the Majapahit and Srivijaya Empires in the 13th and 14th centuries, it fell under the power of Siam and then Malacca in the 15th century. Following the Portuguese conquest of Malacca in 1511, Kelantan dissolved into several petty fiefdoms. These were conquered again by the Siamese and made subject to neighbouring Pattani. In 1760, the raja at Kubang Labu, variously identified by accounts as either Long Muhammad or Long Pandak, succeeded in reuniting the disparate territories under a single ruler. Four years later, he was overthrown by Long Yunus, an aristocratic warlord of Pattani origin, who seized the throne and proclaimed himself Raja of Kelantan. Following the death of Raja Yunus in 1795, control of the state was passed to Terengganu. In 1800, Long Muhammad, son of Yunus, declared himself Sultan Muhammad I. He was eventually accepted by the Siamese as ruler of a separate tributary, in 1812. In September 2010, Sultan Ismail Petra was constitutionally deposed by the State Succession Council in favour of his eldest son, Muhammad Faris Petra (now the current sultan). The elder sultan had failed to sufficiently recover from a debilitating stroke from the previous May. This was followed by several months of litigations made by lawyers acting on behalf of the former sultan. Residences Palace of the Sultan of Kelantan, 1912. *Istana Negeri (State Palace) located at Kubang Kerian, a district of Kota Bharu, is the official residence of the current ruler, Sultan Muhammad V. In addition, a number of official ceremonies have been performed at this palace.Muhammad Ismail Ibrahim (17 March 2011). Kelantan’s Castle: The Royal Palace. The Kelantan Times. Retrieved 13 June 2011. *Istana Mahkota (Crown Palace), also at Kubang Kerian, is the official residence of the Sultan Muhammad V's mother Tengku Anis. *Istana Balai Besar (Grand Hall Palace), located in the downtown area of Kota Bharu, was constructed in 1840 under the orders of Sultan Muhammad II (r. 1835–1886). It replaced the old palace at Kota Lama as the administrative centre of the sultanate, and also served as the residence of a number of sultans. Since its completion, the town where the palace is located was named Kota Bharu (meaning \\"new fort\\") and later became the state capital of Kelantan. It now serves as the main palace for state ceremonial functions. *Istana Telipot (Telipot Palace), located in Kota Bharu, served, until recently, as the official residence of the current sultan whilst he was heir- apparent. *Istana Bukit Tanah (Bukit Tanah Palace), located in Tumpat, It is understood that the palace was built before the Japanese rule of about 1910, during the reign of Sultan Ismail Ibni Almarhum Sultan Muhammad IV. It has been a stopover palace since the reign of Sultan Ismail. *Istana Kota Lama (Old Fortress Palace), located on the banks of the Kelantan River, is the old palace of the modern sultanate, and served as the official residence of the sultans of the early 19th century. Its proximity to the river made it subject to flooding, and was replaced by the Istana Balai Besar in 1840, and subsequently renamed (Kota Lama means \\"old fortress\\"). However, it continues to be used as the official residences of the current crown prince, Tengku Muhammad Faiz Petra and Kelantanese royalty. *Istana Jahar (Jahar Palace), located in downtown Kota Bharu, was built in 1887 by Sultan Ahmad (r. 1886–1890) for his son and heir-apparent, Sultan Muhammad III (r. 1890–1891). The name Jahar was taken from the tree that stands at the entrance, also known as \\"Flame of the Forest\\". It now houses the Museum of Royal Traditions and Ceremonies (Malay: Muzium Adat Istiadat Diraja). *Istana Batu (Batu Palace), located in downtown Kota Bharu, was completed in 1939 under the reign of Sultan Ismail I (1920–1944). It was built as a wedding gift for his nephew and eventual successor, Sultan Yahya Petra (r. 1960–1979). It later served as the residence of the next crown prince, Sultan Ismail Petra.

In modern times it has become one of the quarters of the commune of Auray in the department of Morbihan in Brittany. History In the early 17th century, the town of Auray decided to build a port on the left bank of the Loc'h. Quays and ramps were constructed to allow for the unloading of trade ships where previously vessels had used cruder pontoon structures to dock at the side of the river. An examination of port taxation in 1537 illustrates the commercial activity in Saint-Goustan. The city imports wine, salt, leather, iron and Biscay steel. Conversely, wheat, rye, oats, butter, meat, fish, cloth and fabric are exported. The Auray region was a surplus producer of grain at that time. The development of the larger Auray port in 1641 was completed with the construction of a wharf and two ramps between the old pier which had been built in 1615. This work included the place Saint- Sauveur and continued south to the construction of the current Franklin dock. The stone moorings were placed in 1692. The creation of the Lorient port (1665–1670) and the lack of major roads connecting Saint-Goustan to the hinterland were the cause of a decline in activity in the port. This further decreased with the arrival of the railway and the creation, in 1865, of a new road to Auray which isolated the port and further reduced its trade. The only activity on the Franklin wharf in the early 20th century was the transport of wooden beams for coal mines in Wales.

The port, dates back much further, however, to at least the 12th century. Work began on the dock in 1614 and was extended in 1630. Around 1680, the dock in front of the place Saint-Sauveur was extended further and repaired in 1742. In 1791 it required further repairs which took place from June 1846 to the end of 1852. The quay pavement dates from this time. The dock deteriorated again, and in 1902 subsided more than 50 cm towards the water. The town council did not want to finance plans proposed by engineers to completely rebuild the wharf 68m away. In 1935, the mayor warned that the dock continued to be a problem and in 1936, it collapsed by about 30m. It took three years before repairs were begun, but the work was completed in 1939. The dock measures 220m and is classified ZPPAUP (as a protected area) as a monument of the Gulf of Morbihan. The dock is adjacent to restaurants and hotels, and is a venue for markets, art exhibitions, sales of postcards, a carousel and other seasonal activities, as well as sailing instruction. A boat tour to the islands sails from here and an old rigged ship is permanently docked there too. The latter contains a small museum which includes a replica of Saint-Goustan. The port has been painted by many artists, including Odilon Redon and Mathurin Méheut. The port became a marina containing approximately 155 moorings next to the dock. It was classified as a departmental port and now receives over 1300 visitors vessels per year (as of 2007).Source : Saint-Goustan, Port d'Auray, Restauration du Quai Benjamin Franklin, Mairie d'Auray, 2008 During the 20th century Saint- Goustan became one of the most popular tourist areas in the Auray area as a result of its picturesqueness and the timbered houses in the town centre. However, the large granite stones of the wharf are gradually disintegrating and tidal erosion has created pockets behind the retaining wall. At the end of 2008 part of the wharf had subsided and was in danger of collapse. This area is important for the stability of the houses bordering and had to be consolidated with an emergency embankment of large stones. This part of the wharf now need major repairs costing 1.88M Euros which should be undertaken in January 2009. In December 2008, an association was created with the aid of the Heritage Foundation to gather donations to restore the dock.Le Télégramme 9 February 2009 Environment The quasi-estuary location and the aid of the presence of mudflats mean that the port and the valley host many species of seabirds. The docks are covered with kelp and local oysters. The river Auray plays an important part as a natural route for fish and birds. As such it is one of the components of the national environmental framework which is promoted by the Department of the Environment.

It is named after the River Geisel which rises in Mücheln and is a tributary of the Saale, just under long. Its main settlements are Braunsbedra and Mücheln, which in the future will merge into the 'collective municipality' of Geiseltal. The Geisel valley was quarried for coal from 1698 until the mines were closed in 1994; The mining of brown coal is first attested for 1698 near the Zöbigker grove but is most likely to be older. Initially, only twelve smaller pits emerged at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in the late 19th century, which spread to large areas; ultimately, the Braunsbedra-Geiseltal mines became one of the largest connected mining regions in Germany. Coal/Lignite mining At the beginning of the twentieth century, the region was characterized by mostly independent pits (Elisabeth 1906, Großkayna 1907, Beuna 1907, Cecilie 1907, Rheinland 1908, Leonhardt 1910, Pfännershall 1911). In the course of the further processing of coal, nine briquetting plants were built. The immense coal deposits in the Geisel Valley and its favorable transport conditions also led to the development of several chemical plants settled. BASF constructed construction of the ammonia plant Merseburg of BASF (the later Leuna plants) with its subsidiary Buna-Werke, the world's first synthetic rubber producer (founded in April 1936), as well as the mineral oil plant built by Wintershall AG from 1936, is significant in this context Lützkendorf, a plant for fuel and lubrication oil production. After the Second World War, there was a further intensification of the dismantling. The Mächeln opencast mine, founded in 1949 by merging several existing abbeys (including Pauline, Elisabeth, Emma, and Elise II), charred mainly the western Geisel Valley, while the opencast mining Großkayna, founded 1949 (from the Grube Rheinland) and Kayna-Süd.

In the late 1990s, the old pit mine was converted to a recreation area, flooding the deepest part of the mine with water. The remains of the pit mine were flooded to create recreational and natural areas. In the 1990s, the embankments of the Mücheln opencast mine were moved; around 26 million cubic meters of earth mass were flattened and support the embankment. The completion of these measures began on June 30, 2003 with the flooding of the remaining hole to the Geiseltalsee, which on April 26, 2011, has a water level at above sea level. As of 2015, the lake occupied an area of , which makes it the twelfth largest lake in Germany. Subsequently, the open-cast mine Kayna-Süd was shut down and rehabilitated as early as 1972, resulting in the Südfeldsee with of water surface. The excavation work in Großkayna had already been completed in 1965 and the remaining hole was used until 1995 as a rinsing dump for waste from the Leuna and Buna plants and then flooded to a lake (Runstedter lake). Both of today's lakes are separated from the Geiseltalsee by a tipping dam up to Open-cast mining activities ended in the late 1990s, and subsequently, nature has reclaimed part of the region. Favored by the position of the host valley in the wind shadow of the Harz creates a special microclimate characterized by a mild average annual average temperature and a relatively low annual precipitation of about . Because of its location, it belongs to the Middle-German dry area. Due to the sandy soil, special flora and fauna community has re-emerged, especially on the northern edge of the valley. In addition, the Geiseltalsee also provides prerequisites for viticulture; In 2002 the first grapes were harvested (Spätburgunder, Cabernet, and Müller-Thurgau).

Seven Years' War The valley near Rossbach, between Reichertswerben and Braunsbedra, was the site of the 5 November 1757 Battle of Rossbach between Prussia and the Allied Armies of France and contingents of the Holy Roman Empire, fighting on behalf of Duchy of Austria during the Seven Years' War. The battle had lasted less than 90 minutes but was instrumental in knocking France out of the Silesian theater of the Seven Years' War. Less than five percent of Frederick the Great's entire force had been engaged, and it decisively defeated an army of 42,000. Frederick's use of operational maneuvers and with a fraction of his entire force--3,500 horsemen, 18 artillery pieces, and 3 battalions of infantry--had defeated an entire army of two of the strongest European powers. Frederick's tactics at Rossbach became a landmark in the history of military art. During this battle, Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz emerged as one of Frederick's greatest cavalry leaders.Russell F. Weigley, The Age of Battles: The Quest for Decisive Warfare from Breitenfeld to Waterloo, Indiana University Press, 2004, p. 185. Much of the battlefield was destroyed in the course of mining for lignite; from 1864 to 1994, mining was particularly intense and resulted in the destruction of portions of several villages. The extensive open-cast mining operations caused fundamental changes in the landscape and the population: a total of 18 settlements and some 12,500 people were resettled over the time of the mining and manufacturing. Some residents of Rossbach itself were resettled in 1963 and part of the town was destroyed by mining operations in 1963. Today, most of the battlefield is covered in some farmland, vineyards and a park created from flooding the old lignite mine with water; the resulting lake has a surface area of ; at its deepest point, the lake is deep.

It stands on the site of a late 12th century Anglo-Norman castle. It now hosts the Barretstown camp for sick children. HistoryEarly history= The first historical mention of the place is in a 1547 inquisition held after the Dissolution of the Monasteries, when Barretstown Castle was listed as the property of the Archbishop of Dublin, from whom it was promptly confiscated by the Crown. Thereafter the Castle was held by the Eustace family on a series of \\"permanent leases.\\" In the 17th century Sir Walter Borrowes married a daughter of the earl of Kildare and acquired the estate, and the family retained possession for over 200 years. Members of the family, such as Sir Kildare Borrowes, 5th Baronet, represented Kildare County and Harristown in the former Parliament of Ireland. Unlike the Eustace baronets of the 16th and 17th centuries, the five Borrowes baronets who spanned the 19th century played no part in public life. This quiet aristocratic reign ended with the flamboyant Sir Kildare, 10th Baronet (1852–1924), whose father Rev. Sir Erasmus, 8th Baronet, had significantly modified the residence in a medieval, romantic, asymmetrical style. In 1918, the Borrowes family having left Ireland, Barretstown was purchased by Sir George Sheppard Murray, a Scotsman who converted the estate into a stud farm, and planted many of the exotic trees that dominate the landscape. =Arden and Westons= In 1962 Elizabeth Arden acquired the castle from the Murray family. Over five years, Arden extensively reconstructed, redecorated, and refurnished the castle. Her influence dominates the look of the house to this day. The door of the castle is reputed to have been painted red after her famous brand of perfume Red Door, and remains so to this day. After Arden's death in 1967, the international biscuit tycoon Garfield Weston took up residence. Under his ownership the grounds were significantly improved, particularly through the addition of a magnificent lake in front of the castle. =State ownership= The Weston family, which owns Dublin's famous Brown Thomas department store, presented the estate to the Irish government in 1977, during which time it was used for national and international conferences and seminars, as well as being used as a part of the Irish National Stud. Barretstown Camp The Irish government has leased the castle and its grounds to the Barretstown Camp for 90 years for a nominal €1.26 per year. Part of Paul Newman's SeriousFun Children's Network, Barretstown Camp opened in August 1994, serving 124 children. With the completion of the new medical centre and programme hall, in 1995 the camp served nearly 300 children from Ireland, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, the United States, and Chernobyl disaster areas. In 2009, Barretstown expected to serve 1900 children from around Europe.

Frances Lillian Bible (January 26, 1919 – January 29, 2001) was an American operatic mezzo-soprano who had a thirty-year career at the New York City Opera between 1948 and 1978. She also made a fair number of opera appearances with other companies throughout the United States, but only made a limited number of appearances abroad. Martin Bernheimer wrote in Opera News that, \\"Frances Bible was cheated by destiny. She never quite achieved the international recognition she deserved. Bible had it all—a mellow, wide- ranging mezzo-soprano, an attractive stage presence, genuine theatrical flair, a probing mind and a technique that allowed her to sing bel-canto filigree one night, Verdian drama the next. She was one of the rare American singers who savor the English language. She understood the value of economy, never stooping to easy effects. Perhaps she was too versatile, too tasteful and — dare one say it? — too intelligent for her own good.\\" Biography Bible was born and raised in Sackets Harbor, New York. She studied opera at the Juilliard School in New York City under Queena Mario and Belle Julie Soudant before making her professional opera debut in 1948 at the New York City Opera as the Shepherd in Giacomo Puccini's Tosca. Possessing a warm voice and vibrant stage presence, she became a favorite at that house during the time when Beverly Sills and Norman Treigle were also fixtures at the NYCO. She sang Cornelia to Sills's Cleopatra in the NYCO's 1967 production of Handel's Giulio Cesare which made Sills an international opera star. In 1949 Bible appeared in the world premiere of William Grant Still's Troubled Island. Her first major successes at the NYCO were in 1950 as Amneris in Aida and Cherubino, a trouser role, in Mozart's Le nozze di Figaro. Another major early triumph at the house was her first portrayal of Angelina in La Cenerentola in 1953. Trouser roles became of specialty of her, and she was particularly popular in roles like Octavian in Strauss's Der Rosenkavalier, Oberon in Britten's A Midsummer Night's Dream, Nicklausse in Offenbach's The Tales of Hoffmann, Siebel in Charles Gounod's Faust and Hänsel in Hänsel und Gretel. Other roles in which she excelled were, Dorabella in Così fan tutte, Jocasta in Stravinsky's Oedipus Rex, Herodias in Strauss's Salome, Ottavia in L'Incoronazione di Poppea, the title role in Britten's The Rape of Lucretia, and Ulrica in Un ballo in maschera among many others. During Bible's career at the NYCO she sang in several world premieres including the roles of Frade in David Tamkin's The Dybbuk in 1951, Elizabeth Proctor in Robert Ward's The Crucible in 1961, and Mrs Tracy in Thea Musgrave's The Voice of Ariadne in 1977. She also sang the role of Augusta Tabor in the original production of Douglas Moore's The Ballad of Baby Doe at the Central City Opera in Colorado in 1956 (although Martha Lipton actually sang the role for the work's opening night). She later reprised the role of Augusta at the NYCO and recorded both the roles of Augusta and Elizabeth Proctor with the NYCO in 1961. In addition to her work with the NYCO, Bible was a regular performed in America's second-tier houses, appearing in productions with the Baltimore Opera Company, Cincinnati Opera, Dallas Opera (1978), Hawaii Opera Theatre, Los Angeles Opera, New Orleans Opera, Philadelphia Grand Opera Company (1959, 1970), and the Seattle Opera (1968) among others. In 1955 she sang the role of Néris for the United States premiere of Luigi Cherubini's Médée, presented by the American Opera Society in concert at Carnegie Hall. In 1956 she toured the United States singing Cherubino with the NBC Opera Theatre, also appearing in a handful of their opera recordings for television. She sang in a few production with two of America's more important opera houses: the Houston Grand Opera and the San Francisco Opera. She made her debut in Houston as Octavian in 1958. In San Francisco she portrayed Evadne in the United States premiere of William Walton's Troilus and Cressida in 1955. Her other appearances in San Francisco included Bersi in Andrea Chénier (1955), Octavian (1955, 1960), Elizabeth Proctor (1965), Siebel (1955), and the Watercress Vendor and the Chair Mender in Louise (1955).San Francisco Opera Archives Two triumphs from the latter part of her career were performances of Mélisande in Debussy's Pelléas et Mélisande at the Caramoor International Music Festival and Eglantine in a concert performance of Weber's Euryanthe with the New York Philharmonic, both in 1970. On the international stage Bible made appearances at the De Nederlandse Opera and the Vancouver Opera. She sang in one production with the Vienna State Opera, the role of Amneris in 1963. She was on the roster of principal singers at the Badisches Staatstheater Karlsruhe during the 1963-1964 season, and she sang the role of Cherubino with the Scottish Opera in 1964. Her biggest success on the international stage were three lauded performances at the Glyndebourne Festival: the role of Cherubino in 1955 and the role of Ottavia at both the 1962 and 1963 festivals. After her retirement from the stage, Bible taught on the voice faculty at Rice University in Houston. She later retired to Hemet, California where she died at the age of 82.

The son of a blacksmith and a blacksmith himself, after the death of his father, his uncle continued his cultural education. He never had any particular patron but was still able to gradually leave the family business to pursue his passion: story telling. He had an enormous success and was able to travel to fairs, markets, patrician houses, and the Italian courts. His presentations were complemented by a violin. His prolific literary production was contingent upon his own transcriptions of his shows. He was married twice and had 14 children. He died in poverty.  His life and choices  He had little formal training or teachers and can therefore be considered one of the most successful self-taught authors in Italian literature. Due to his choices, he was never fully part of the literary groups of his time. To be a literary man in his period meant living at court, having patrons, or else being left to one's own devices for financial purposes. Croce was never a true literary man in the strictest sense of the word since he preferred laymen audiences to the court. In fact, he was principally a story teller and a blacksmith and most likely wrote for his own personal satisfaction. As such, his stories and inspiration come from the lower class, from the audiences at the market, who, if able to read, bought his works. This is in stark opposition to many contemporary authors who were inspired by the whims of their patrons.  Bertoldo  One of the few of his more than 400 published works to be translated into English, Bertoldo was a popular story among the people of his time. Bertoldo is a story that had various versions in the Middle Ages taking place in the court of the king Alboin in either Verona or Pavia depending on the version. In its most organic version, that of Croce (, 1606), Bertoldo is from Roverè. Some of its raunchy language was softened, as was the edge of revenge against the powerful commoner in some of the other variations. One of his sources for the story were the Dialogus Salomonis et Marcolphi. To his first Bertoldo,The Library of Congress Croce wrote a sequel called Le piacevoli et ridicolose simplicità di Bertoldino, 1608, (about the son of Bertoldo, in the charge of his mother Marcolfa). Later (1620), the abbot Adriano Banchieri wrote another sequel called Novella di Cacasenno, figliuolo del semplice Bertoldino. Since then the work of Croce is often published alongside under the title Bertoldo, Bertoldino e Cacasenno from which three films were inspired under the same title in: 1936, 1954 and 1984 (the last by Mario Monicelli). In Bertoldo, Croce may have shown his secret aspirations, the crude lout and the self- taught, the presence at court was his hope for his future with which he hoped to solve his problems. The liberty of thought and action that Bertoldo had at court may show Croce’s desire to live vicariously through his character by having a patron, like many of his counterparts, but without having to pay homage to them.  Books and Comedies  He wrote more than 400 works in Italian and Bolognese dialect. = Books = * Le sottilissime astuzie di Bertoldo * Le piacevoli e ridicolose simplicità di Bertoldino, figlio del già astuto Bertoldo * Descrizione della vita del Croce (autobiography in verse) * I banchetti di mal cibati (on the plague of 1590) * La sollecita e studiosa Accademia de' Golosi * L'eccellenza e il trionfo del porco * Le ventisette mascherate piacevolissime (dedicated to the venetian Berenice Gozzadina Gozadini) = Comedies = * La Farinella * Il tesoro * Sandrone astuto * Sandrone astuto * Il tesoro * Cavalcata di varij lenguazi * Sogno del Zani * Dispute fra Cola et Arlechino * Dai Dialoghi curiosi * Vanto ridicoloso del Trematerra * La gran vittoria di Pedrolino contra il Dottor Gratiano Scatolone * La canzone di Catarinon * Vocabulario Gratianesco * Conclusiones quinquaginta tres sustintà in Franculin dal macilent Signor Grazian Godga... * Sbravate, razzate e arcibullate dell'arcibravo Smedolla uossi... * Disputa fra Cola Sgariatore, ed Arlechino da Marcaria sopra le lor prodezze * Utrom del Dottore Graziano Partesana da Francolino References External links  * Da liber liber two texts by GC Croce: Bertoldo e La Farinella * Bertoldo Bertoldino e Cacasenno pdf * an enigma by GC Croce * The pamphlets of Giulio Cesare Croce (Biblioteca dell'Archiginnasio) * complete bibliography and transcription of some of the works of GC Croce Category:1550 births Category:1609 deaths Category:People from San Giovanni in Persiceto Category:Italian dramatists and playwrights Category:Italian male dramatists and playwrights ","title":"Giulio Cesare Croce"},{"id":"22885501","text":"Dientes de Navarino (Teeth of Navarino in English) are a mountain range in Navarino Island, Chile, located just south of Puerto Williams, along the Beagle Channel coast.

It is situated in the West of the city's Ottakring district, on the slope of the Gallitzinberg at 302 m altitude. Originally a private research institution, it was converted into an educational astronomy facility after World War II as buildings and city lights had encroached to a degree that severely hampered scientific nightsky observations. Today the main tasks of the observatory consist in public education on astronomy, operating and preserving the historical equipment, and minor projects in scientific astronomy. The observatory was noted for its work on photometry, conducted by astronomer K. Schwarzschild, star catalogs, and the determining of distances to other stars. The observatory has several astronomical instruments of historical interest, including a noted heliometer and large meridian circle, and also a vertical circle. The observatory's first observations were made in 1886. Scientific achievements The Kuffner observatory in 1891, immediately after its extension Modern astrophotograph of the moon with the Kuffner refractor (27 cm ~10.6 inch) The Kuffner observatory was constructed from 1884-1886 according to plans of Franz Ritter von Neumann. Originally it was a private research institution for which the philanthropic head of the Kuffner brewery dynasty from Lundenburg, Moriz von Kuffner financed the construction (including extensions built in 1889-1890), the equipment, and also the operation. During the years leading up to World War I the observatory became one of the most important astronomy sites in the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, and established a considerable international reputation. Carl Wilhelm Wirtz, Leo Anton Karl de Ball, Samuel Oppenheim, and most notably Karl Schwarzschild spent parts of their careers here. During his assistantship at the Kuffner observatory, Schwarzschild – who would later become the “grandfather of black hole theory”—developed a formula that allowed to calculate the relation between the intensity of faint astronomical light sources, the exposure time, and the degree of opacity created in photographic emulsions. Schwarzschild is noted for his work on advancing photographic photometry. Demise and reactivation The financial situation of the Kuffner dynasty deteriorated with the onset of World War I. The observatory was closed in 1915 and, after several failed attempts, was reopened only in 1947. The Vienna city council acquired the facility in 1987, and initiated a total refurbishment that lasted from 1989 to 1995 when it was reopened to the public under the direction of the Folk high school Ottakring as an institution for public education, a Volkssternwarte. Historical equipment The Kuffner observatory maintains four major pieces of observation equipment from the late 19th century in working condition: the 270 mm refracting telescope, built in 1884, to which a 156 mm astrograph (now used with modern CCD imagers) was added in 1890; the 132 mm meridian circle, the largest meridian passage instrument of the Austro-Hungarian Empire; its ancillary vertical circle instrument, one of the few that still exist at European observatories; and the 217/3000 mm heliometer, the largest of its type that was ever built.Habison P.: Astrometry and early astrophysics at Kuffner Observatory in the late 19th century.

The instrument was installed in 1896, an by 1910 it had computed 16 parallax distances to other stars, out only 108 total known to science at that time. The meridian circle (i.e. transit-type instrument) can record the locations of the things in the sky, and also be used to calculate a local time. The instrument type was very important in the old observatories, and had to do with time, the geography of the Earth, and the location of things in the sky. The great refractor is a double telescope, with a primary of 270 mm (27 cm) aperture objective lens, and was built by Repsold and also Steinheill; it was installed at the observatory in 1886. The double refractor of Kuffner The observatory also has some other astronomical instruments, and an Urban No.18 pendulum clock. The clock would often be used in conjunction with other astronomical instruments. Current research Kuffner Observatory, 2008 Besides its function as a scientific museum and its ongoing mission concerning popularization of astronomy, the Kuffner observatory serves as the Austrian national host for the INES (International Ultraviolet Explorer New Extracted Spectra) database.

Some authorities, such as Froelich (1991), Collins and Dubach (2001) and Nieves (2005), do not recognize the Black-headed spider monkey as a distinct species and so treat the Colombian spider monkey as a subspecies of Geoffroy's spider monkey. The Colombian spider monkey lives in dry forests, humid forests and cloud forests, and can live up to above sea level. It is entirely black with some white on its chin while the Brown-headed spider monkey (A. f. fusciceps) has a black or brown body and a brown head. The spider monkey has a black body and long limbs with thumb-less hands. It has a prehensile and extremely flexible tail, which acts as an extra limb. The tail has a hairless patch on the tip that is used for grip. This hairless patch is unique in its markings, just like the human fingerprint. Colombian spider monkeys can weigh up to 9.1 kg (20 pounds). Fruit makes up eighty percent of the spider monkey's diet, which also includes leaves, nuts, seeds, bark, insects, and flowers. Spider monkeys contribute to the dispersion of undigested seeds from the fruits they eat. This monkey lives approximately 24 years. Spider monkeys are found in social groups of up to 30 individuals; however, they are usually broken up into smaller foraging groups of 3-4 individuals. They move and climb through the forest by hand over hand (brachiation) motion.

It carries the London Underground's Northern line from Mill Hill East station to Finchley Central station. It is the highest point on the London Underground above ground level, reaching nearly . It is located on a branch that was formerly part of the Edgware, Highgate and London Railway. Etymology The official name of the viaduct is taken from Dollis Brook which it crosses. The brook was marked on an 1877 Ordnance Survey map and the name may have originated from a farm called Dollis, previously in Hendon. This was earlier named Dalys in 1563, (the) Doles 1574, Dallys 1584 and in its current form of Dollis in 1822. This probably meant \\"the portions or shares of land (in the common field)\\", from the Middle English word dole. The name is not thought to be connected with the area of Dollis Hill, further south. Dollis Hill is thought to mean a \\"hill associated with a family called Dalley\\". History The viaduct was designed by John Fowler and Walter Brydone, chief engineer for the Great Northern Railway (GNR) from 1855-1861. The contractor that built the bridge was Smith, Knight & Co. The viaduct came into use on 22 August 1867 with the opening of the GNR's single-track Edgware, Highgate and London Railway line from Finsbury Park to Edgware, via Finchley and Mill Hill, which was authorised by an Act of Parliament in 1862. 1934 Ordnance Survey map with the location of the viaduct marked Although built to carry two tracks, the viaduct initially carried only one. Following the construction of a branch northwards from Finchley to Barnet in 1872, the original Edgware route effectively became a branch of the newer line. In the 1920s, the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER, successor to the GNR) planned to electrify the line but work was not carried out until the 1930s when the Northern Heights plan led to the doubling and electrification of the lines. This was in preparation for a transfer of the lines to the London Underground for it to form part of the system's Northern line. The start of the Second World War prevented the plans being completed and only the section of the line to Mill Hill East was electrified and reopened in 1941, whilst the High Barnet branch was electrified in 1940. From this point on London Transport trains used only one of the tracks on the Mill Hill branch and the other track was soon lifted. Freight on the line lasted until 1964 when the line west of Mill Hill East was abandoned, leaving the present arrangement. Length, span and architecture Detailed view of viaduct's piers The viaduct's 13 segmental arches carry it across the valley of the Dollis Brook, and over Dollis Road. Each arch spans at the springer level, and is based on tapered piers. In each pier there is an opening with an arched soffit and a dished invert. The viaduct is made from brick. It is the highest point on both the Northern line and the highest point on the London Underground above ground level, reaching nearly . It is not, however, the highest altitude on the Underground system, which is near Amersham (Metropolitan line) in the Chiltern Hills, at above sea level. Around the viaduct Below the viaduct can be found the Dollis Valley Greenwalk, a long distance footpath between Moat Mount Open Space in Mill Hill and Hampstead Heath. This is designed to link many green spaces and wildlife corridors along the way and is approximately long. The geology nearby is of London Clay with small amounts of other rock types. An examination in the late 19th century of the railway cutting between Finchley and Hendon station found a large extent of glacial beds and fossils, and these were thought to extend as far northwest as the viaduct.

The People's House. Skytteråsen. Skytterdalen is a small, populated valley north of Sandvika in Bærum, Norway. Geography The valley lies between two hills; Skytteråsen in the northwest and Løkkeåsen in the southeast. The creek Solbergbekken runs through it, formed at Solberg, at the confluence of three lesser creeks from Valler in the west, Avløs in the north and Løkeberg in the east. From Solberg it ran almost in a straight southwestern line through Skytterdalen. Schools of brown trout were found there, and fishing was popular; however in modern times the entire watershed has been led underground through a pipe system. At the foot of the valley the creek crosses the road Leif Larsens vei, named after Leif Larsen, before emptying into the meandering river Sandvikselva. History The name, meaning 'Shooter Valley', stems from the sport shooting activity in the late nineteenth century. The local rifle association, Bærums Skytterlag, had their shooting field here from 1867 to 1885, when it was moved. Parts of Skytterdalen is built-up, and there are two tall apartment buildings with 136 apartments. After the 2008 Ålesund landslide, steps were taken to protect the area from landslides in Løkkeåsen. Skytteråsen was built-up in the interwar period. A stamp mill Løkkeåsen pukkverk was operational in the same period, but was closed after an accident in 1945. The municipality took over, but the mill was ultimately discontinued in the 1970s. At the foot of Skytterdalen is found Folkvang or Folkets hus ('The People's House'), a meeting place for the local labour movement. The initiative was taken by laborers from the paper factory at Hamang, and the house was erected in 1915–1916 by the paper factory trade union and the Norwegian Labour Party, and renovated in 1982. The house is still used as a site of labour movement rituals, like May Day speeches. It has also been used as a courthouse, boxing arena, theatre stage and cinema. Next to Folkets hus is an International Montessori Pre-School. The upper secondary schools Valler and Sandvika and the primary school Evje are all within walking distance. Transportation The Løkkeås Tunnel, a planned road tunnel integrated as a part of the Norwegian National Road 164, will run under Løkkeåsen and emerge near Folkets hus. The proposed length is 190 metres. When it comes to public transportation, Skytterdalen is served by the lines 705 and 706 of the Ruter bus network; the bus station is named Folkets hus.

Forging and faking, regumming and reperforating of stamps is common in the philatelic marketplace, and increasingly buyers demand an expert certificate before buying a valuable item. Some items are so often faked or altered that they may be almost unsaleable without a certificate.  The process of expertisation  Experts may be individuals or committees but they will all follow a similar process to determine whether an item is genuine.The Expertizing Process. The Philatelic Foundation, 2012. Retrieved 8 June 2012. Archived here. =Stamps= Experts will attempt to determine whether a questioned stamp is a genuine example of a particular stamp issue; that is, whether it was printed at the same time from the same plate or stone as was that stamp issue. Among the factors they may consider are: #Is the stamp's design identical to those of genuine ones? Forged stamps almost invariably differ to a greater or lesser degree from genuine ones. #Is the size of the stamp correct? #Was the stamp printed using the same printing method, e.g., lithography, engraving, etc.? #Is the paper identical with the paper used for genuine stamps? Is the thickness, color, type of paper (laid or wove) correct? #Does the stamp contain the correct watermark as do genuine ones? #Are the perforations correct, e.g., is the spacing of the perforations correct; are they of the same size, type and shape as those on the genuine stamp? #Is the color of the stamp correct? Is it printed with the right inks? Some inks may react to ultraviolet light, for example. #Does the stamp have the correct tagging? #Does the stamp have the correct gum? #Even if the stamp was printed from the original plates or stone, is it a reprint made later, either officially or unofficially? There may be subtle differences in color, paper or design. Experts also will ask whether the stamp been altered in any fashion: #Has the color of the stamp been changed? This sometimes can be done chemically. #Have perforations been added or removed to make it appear imperforate or coil? #Has the design been changed in any fashion? Sometimes, the denomination on a common stamp from a series has been changed to a rare denomination. #Has an overprint been added or removed? #Has a cancellation been added or removed? If the stamp is cancelled, is the cancellation genuine and of the proper period for the stamp? #Have other changes been made? The common 4 annas bicolor stamp of India has been altered by cutting out the image of Queen Victoria and remounting it upside down, or by chemically erasing the image and reprinting it upside down, to make the stamp appear to be the rare invert. Experts will also attempt to determine whether genuine stamps have been repaired or cleaned: #Has a tear been mended? #Has a missing piece been restored? #Has a thin spot or hole in the paper been repaired? #Has the stamp been cleaned? #Has the stamp been regummed? #Have short or missing perforations been repaired? #Has a crease been repaired? =Covers= Among the factors experts may consider for a cover are: # The cover itself: ## Are there any repairs to the cover ### Sealed tears ### Stains removed by bleaching ### Cutting down one side of the envelope to remove a torn edge where the envelope was opened ### Erased pencil marks written by earlier stamp collectors ## Is the cover faked: ### Is the paper from the time period when the cover went through the mail? # The stamps on the cover: ## Are the stamps genuine or forged? ## Are the stamps correctly used? For example, using a stamp years after it is no longer valid for postage ## Have the stamps been repaired (cleaned, bleached, reperforated)? ## Have the stamps been removed from the cover and reglued to it? Usually done to identify rare varieties of the stamps ## Have stamps been removed from the cover? ## Have stamps been added to the cover which were not present when the cover passed through the mail? For example, adding a rarely used stamp to an existing cover to make an ordinary cover extremely valuable ## Have the stamps been removed and replaced with different stamps? For example, removing a stamp in excellent condition and replacing it with one having damage to the back, giving that the damaged backside of the stamp will not be visible. # The postal markings on the cover ## Are the postal markings genuine? ## Are the postal markings appropriate from the time period used? ## Have extra faked postal markings been added to the cover to make it more valuable? ## Is the ink genuine and from the time period used?  The tools of expertisation  Experts will often maintain their own library of fakes and forgeries, and they also have access to the records of past genuine items that they have seen. They will usually have a large library of philatelic literature to refer to. Scientific equipment is essential, including: *Binocular and comparison microscopes *Paper micrometers *Ultraviolet and infrared energy sources *Photometric colour determination equipment *X-ray fluorescence and spectro- photometry equipment. Common sense and above all, experience, are also vital.  Expert certificates and marks Stamp expertisation mark of Alfred Forbin Once an item has been examined, the expert(s) will issue a certificate giving their findings which will include identification, genuineness or otherwise and comments about any alterations or unusual features. The certificate will normally feature a photograph of the item and be signed. It may also be embossed or have other security features. In the past it was common for experts to sign or add their mark to the back of stamps, however, this is nowadays uncommon as it is by some regarded as an undesired alteration. In Germany (BPP) it is still common practise to sign many items, but generally not the most valuable. There have been instances where expert certificates have themselves been faked Jean-François Brun, Out-Foxing the Fakers, American Philatelic Society, State College, Pennsylvania (1993), pp. 113-115. and in the \\"Blüm Case\\", a forger produced false expertizing marks that were applied to German colony stamps and others.The Blüm Case, 2006  Finding experts  In the United States, the Philatelic Foundation, American Philatelic Society and numerous specialized stamp collecting organizations have committees who will perform expertisation for a fee. In Great Britain The Royal Philatelic Society London has a renowned expert committee which is also the oldest in the world, and of equal fame is the BPA expert committee.BPA Expertising Ltd was originally set up by the \\"British Philatelic Association\\" which is now defunct and has been superseded by the \\"Association of British Philatelic Societies\\" (ABPS, http://www.abps.org.uk/Home/index.xalter). The current BPA Expertising Ltd has no connection with ABPS.. German experts usually belong to the Bund Philatelistischer Prüfer (BPP). Specialized in their countries issues are e.g. the expert committees of NVPH (Netherlands), COMEX (Spain), Isphila (Turkey). - In addition, the International Association of Philatelic Experts (AIEP) is a worldwide organisation for independent stamp experts. The results of expertisation may be challenged, and in some cases further research has shown the genuineness of an item considered a forgery, or vice versa.

Goal  The main task that UBL sets for itself was the popularization of basketball in Ukraine, the improvement of Ukrainian basketball players’ skills and the revival of Ukrainian basketball prestige. The President of UBL was Mykhailo Brodskyy.  History  Ukrainian basketball League was created on 20 June 2008 as an alternative body to Ukrainian basketball Federation. The following key principles are put to the basis of UBL operation: sight, competition and openness. That is why today in UBL, as in NBA, the clubs are limited with their budget top margins, which guarantees to all teams the same and equal opportunities. Another key difference of UBL is “the course to Ukrainization” of domestic basketball. The Regulations of the League demand the presence on playing court a minimum of one Ukrainian player out of five. This approach gives an opportunity to involve Ukrainian stars in games and to stimulate investments in formation of domestic basketball schools. During the first year of its existence UBL had organized several arrangements that combined the sporting activities with elements of show, such as All-Star Game and UBL Cup Final Four.

He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Texas Rangers and in Nippon Professional Baseball for the Chiba Lotte Marines. Prior to playing professionally, he played college baseball at Fresno State. Amateur career Scheppers played shortstop at Dana Hills High School in Dana Point, California. When his high school team experienced a shortage of pitchers, Scheppers was pressed into action as a pitcher. The Baltimore Orioles drafted Scheppers in the 29th round of the 2005 Major League Baseball Draft, but he opted to attend California State University, Fresno to play for the Fresno State Bulldogs instead. Fresno State recruited Scheppers as a shortstop, but used him as a pitcher. In 2008, his junior year, Scheppers had an 8–2 win-loss record with a 2.93 earned run average and 109 strikeouts in innings pitched, and was named the Western Athletic Conference Pitcher of the Year. Fresno State won the 2008 College World Series, though Scheppers did not play in the tournament due to an injured rotator cuff and labrum in his shoulder. Professional career Due to the shoulder injury, Scheppers fell in the 2008 Major League Baseball Draft to the second round, with the 48th overall selection, where he was selected by the Pittsburgh Pirates. The Pirates offered Scheppers less money than he was hoping for, and he opted not to sign with the Pirates. Scheppers signed with the St. Paul Saints of the American Association of Independent Professional Baseball for the 2009 season. =Texas Rangers= Scheppers pitching for the Rangers Scheppers was chosen in the supplementary first round, with the 44th overall selection, of the 2009 Major League Baseball Draft by the Texas Rangers. Teams passed on him again due to injury concerns, as some believed he had a partially torn labrum, which would require surgery. Scheppers also was the pitching coach for the junior varsity baseball team at Trabuco Hills High School in Mission Viejo, California, for the 2009 season. On September 17, 2009, Scheppers signed with the Texas Rangers to a minor league deal. Scheppers was selected to represent the United States in the All-Star Futures Game in 2010. On June 7, 2012, Scheppers was called up to the majors when Derek Holland was placed on the 15-day disabled list.

Scheppers picked up his first win on August 16, 2012 when the Rangers defeated the New York Yankees. In 2013, Scheppers made 76 relief appearances for the Rangers, tied for the third-most in the American League. In 2013 Scheppers reported that he was randomly assaulted and \\"sucker punched\\" in Cleveland while walking back to the team hotel after dinner. Reports later emerged which indicated that he been in a bar fight and was using the random assault story as a cover. The Rangers named Scheppers their Opening Day starting pitcher in 2014. However, he experienced right elbow inflammation and went on the disabled list in April, after making four starts. He returned to the Rangers in June as a relief pitcher, and returned to the disabled list with elbow inflammation after making four appearances.

History Mr John Wilson Gillie was born on the 31st of March 1864. On the 31st of July 1880 he was apprenticed for four years to J.J. Wilson and Sons, Nautical Instrument Makers of Sunderland. Following the apprenticeship he spent six months to a year as an ‘improver’ in Glasgow, and then started a new company ‘Wilson and Gillie’ in North Shields. At this time sail had just given way to steam and wooden ships to steel, and the railways were competing with colliers for the carrying of coal from the North East of England to London and the South. In 1858 only seven out of 44 shipyards on the Tyne were using iron, but by 1862 there were ten, employing around 4,000 men. These changes had a significant effect on nautical instrument manufacturers, as the magnetic compass for a wooden sailing vessel was very simple and required little in the way of compensation. For steel vessels much more was required and this was a period of great development, both in the compass bowl and the binnacle in which it was housed. In 1870 Sir William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin) designed his dry card standard compass, which completely replaced all previous designs. Wilson and Gillie started as agents for the Thomson compass, but later J.W. Gillie, using similar principles, redesigned the compass suspension and patented the ‘UNIT’ standard compass. It became popular with local shipowners and shipbuilders. In 1910 the firm of John Lilley and Son (which had been established in London in 1812), found themselves in financial difficulties and were saved with the help of John Wilson Gillie, who established, on the 8th of August 1911, a new firm of John Lilley and Son Limited. John Lilley and Son had been the sole London agents for Sir William Thomson, a very enviable position during this period, when the Thomson compass led the field. Unfortunately, Mr. Lilley had quarrelled with the Glasgow company, who withdrew the agency and established their own branch in London (later to become Kelvin White and Hutton). On November 7th 1913, the firm of John Lilley and Son Limited of London amalgamated with Wilson and Gillie of North Shields, and after this date instruments manufactured by the two companies bore the name John Lilley and Son Limited of London and North Shields. During the 1930s many of the London nautical instrument makers were in difficulties, including John Lilley and Son Limited and Reynolds and Son, Dobbie and Clyde Limited, and Mr. J.W. Gillie arranged an amalgamation between these two companies. The new firm became Lilley and Reynolds Limited. In 1943, with estate duties in mind, the North Shields company was reconstituted and took the name of John Lilley and Gillie Limited, although the shareholders, directors and personnel remained unchanged In the early 1970s Lilley and Gillie developed close links with Observator in Rotterdam, who manufactured one of the first fully reliable transmitting magnetic compass systems. The Observator shareholders, Holland America Line, bought the share capital of John Lilley and Gillie Limited., but retained all the personnel and the directors. In 1975 Mr. C.H. Turnbull joined the company as M.D. and during 1976 the company bought the shares in the London chart agent, Brown and Perring Limited, and re-acquired Lilley and Reynolds. Since then, the company has consolidated its position as a Class A Admiralty Chart Agent and nautical instrument manufacturer, and has gradually entered the field of marine electronics. The centenary year was celebrated with the acquisition of the assets of Henry Brown & Sons (Sestrel) Limited. This firmly established the company as the leading UK manufacturer of nautical instruments. In June 1988 the Holland America Line sold the shares in Lilley and Gillie and the London company, Brown & Perring, to Kopcke International Supply Systems, a large Dutch ship chandler owned by Consolidated Press (the Australian entrepreneur Kerry Packer's holding company). In July 1989 Lilley and Gillie, Brown and Perring and a Kopcke subsidiary, Cullen Metcalfe, were consolidated as divisions of one operating company, Sestrel International. The companies continued to operate independently and to trade under their well known individual names. Observator in the Netherlands had now become Sestrel Observator, and closer co-operation between the Dutch and UK companies was encouraged. Manufacturing for the group was consolidated in North Shields in 1991. In 1992 Lilley and Gillie purchased sophisticated test equipment from the Admiralty Compass Observatory (A.C.O.) and gained approval from the Department of Transport to test to I.S.O. and D.O.T. requirements for individual compasses and T.M.C.’s. This was subject to the company obtaining quality acceptance to BS5750 Part II and ISO 9002, and this was achieved in November 1993. In October 1993 Kopcke International Supply Systems decided to sell both Sestrel Observator and Brown & Perring Limited to their major competitor, Kelvin Hughes Limited. At Lilley and Gillie there was a management buy-out, with the Managing Director, Mr. Chris Turnbull, acquiring the majority of the shares, supported by Iver C. Weilbach and Company of Copenhagen, who had been friends of the company for many decades. During the next six years the company thrived, as a large proportion of the profits were reinvested. In 1997 Chris Turnbull visited the Charente Group in Liverpool, the shareholders of Dubois Phillips & McCallum Limited (now DPM (UK) Limited) with the intention of trying to acquire DPM. The discussions were turned around, and Charente eventually purchased John Lilley and Gillie Limited in June 1999. In June 1999, Graham Knight was appointed the Managing Director, after eleven years in the position of Sales and Marketing Manager. On appointment as M.D. he immediately instigated a programme for re-engineering the existing products. The Charente Group, which included Harrison Line, went through some changes in December 2001, which meant that Lilley and Gillie became the major company within the Group. The company continues to look for opportunities, and in July 2002 acquired the assets of Thomas Walker & Son Limited, including the products and brand names of Walker Marine, Chernikeeff and Neco. December 2002 saw the consolidation of all the manufacturing activities to the larger Birmingham site, with sales, distribution and administration remaining at North Shields. Re-engineering of all the Walker branded products has now been carried out to take advantage of improved materials and production methods. In June 2004 Lilley & Gillie bought a 50% holding in PC Maritime, the Plymouth-based developer of electronic chart software and associated hardware to marine markets worldwide PC Maritime's core product is Navmaster, an electronic chart system. PC Maritime Ltd is a developer and supplier of software, electronic charts and associated hardware to marine markets worldwide. Its products include electronic navigation systems, office-based electronic chart applications, type-approved engine room training simulators and electronic chart services. An independent British company founded by David and Anne Edmonds in 1987, PC Maritime was the first manufacturer to support the UK Hydrographic Office ARCS product in 1996 and was actively involved in UKHO developments including the ECDIS service trials. PC Maritime's customers range from shipowners, shipmanagers, maritime authorities, maritime colleges, coastguards, ports, survey and salvage companies, superyachts and leisure yachtsmen. In May 2009 John Lilley & Gillie Ltd established an office in Singapore and subsequently formed John Lilley & Gillie (Singapore)Pte Ltd. Mr Daniel Lim is the Asia Regional Sales Manager and also a Director. This move has proved highly successful and enables the company to provide account management and face to face contact with the extremely important client base in the Pacific rim. The current Managing Director of John Lilley and Gillie Ltd, Glenn Heathcote, was appointed in September 2006. Glenn had spent 12 months at North Shields in 2004 and then was transferred to their sister company DPM (UK) Ltd in Liverpool where he was appointed Managing Director. Glenn moved back to the North East, and is also a director of John Lilley & Gillie (Singapore)Pte Ltd. In May 2013 the Directors of John Lilley & Gillie Ltd's holding company, (Harrison Maritime), decided to concentrate on the Equipment side of the business and consequently sold the Admiralty Chart agency operation within the group. Since then the company has relocated its headquarters to more suitable premises in North Shields and is continuing to innovate and ensure the products continue to meet full compliance with International Maritime regulations and Type Approvals.

In relation to controlled and restricted drug products, the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act establishes eight schedules. of drugs and new penalties for the possession, trafficking, exportation and production of controlled substances as defined by the Governor-in-Council. Drug policy of Canada has traditionally favoured punishment of the smallest of offenders, but this convention was partially broken in 1996 with the passing of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.  History  Until 1908 the use of narcotics, opiates, Alcohol and Tobacco especially, in Canada was unregulated but were on the way of regulation.Perspectives on Canadian Drug Policy Volume 1 . John Howard Society. Retrieved on May 21, 2009. From the 1850s onwards, Chinese immigrants came to British Columbia in droves, establishing opium dens in their isolated communities. Canadian employers saw the Chinese immigrants as a source of cheap labour, and the government viewed opium consumption as another way to gain revenue, imposing a tax on opium factories in 1871. However, with the decline of the gold rush in the 1880s resentment towards the Chinese grew, as unemployed Canadians could not compete with cheap Chinese labour.Major Studies of Drugs and Drug Policy Schaffer Library of Drug Policy. Retrieved May 21, 2009. Additionally, Japanese immigration to Canada began to rise sharply, resulting in demonstrations against Asian labour. In 1907, there was a particularly large demonstration against Asian immigrants in Vancouver's Chinatown.Heroin Prohibition in Canada . Cannabis Culture Magazine. Retrieved May 21, 2009. In response to the demonstrations, Deputy Minister of Labour Mackenzie King travelled to British Columbia and interviewed two opium merchants. King was concerned with the growing numbers of white opium users and believed that Canada had to set the precedent on drug use worldwide. The following year the government enacted the Opium Act of 1908, which made it an offence to import, manufacture, possess or sell opium, while not making it an imprisonable offence. The same year, Parliament passed the Proprietary and Patent Medicine Act 1908, prohibiting the use of cocaine in medicines and requiring pharmaceutical companies to list on the label the ingredients of any medicine if heroin, morphine, or opium was part of the contents. The 1908 drug law created a black market for opium, and law enforcement officials believed that the only way to stop this black market was through imprisonment for offenders, so the Opium and Drugs Act 1911 was passed by Parliament.Timeline on Canadian Cannabis Laws . Ontario Cannabis Activist Network. Retrieved May 21, 2009. This created harsher penalties for drug offenders and also expanded the list of prohibited drugs to include morphine and cocaine, while cannabis was included in 1923. During World War I, all provinces enacted prohibition, a decision repealed in all areas except Prince Edward Island by 1929.Cherry, et al (2002). Substance abuse: a global view. Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Publishing Group. In 1921 the penalties of the Opium and Drugs Act were expanded to provide for a seven-year prison sentence for crimes committed under the Act. The amendment also made it an offence to be in a building that contained narcotics, notably shifting the burden of proof to the defendant for this crime. Whipping and deportation became penalties for violations of the 1911 Act in 1922. Canada's 1920s drug policy was strikingly different from that of the present day. Drug users were considered more as criminals than as those with an illness, and the enforcement of drug laws was given precedence over the treatment of offenders. Additionally, almost three-quarters of those convicted by the 1911 drug laws were Chinese in 1922. This led many white Canadians to believe that the drug laws had no effect on them; they thought they only applied to those of Asiatic descent. In 1923, the government introduced the Act to Prohibit the Improper Use of Opium and other Drugs; this was a consolidation of other legislation but now listed three new drugs, including marijuana. Historians often point to the 1922 publication of Emily Murphy’s The Black Candle (which was reprinted in 1973) as the inspiration for the addition of the three extra drugs. However, according to Canadian Historian Catherine Carstairs, Murphy was not respected by the Division of Narcotic Control because of the creative liberties she took in presenting research they had assisted her with. \\"There were insinuations in the records that the bureaucrats at the division of narcotic control did not think very highly of Emily Murphy and did not pay attention to what she was writing about, and they didn't consider her a particularly accurate or valuable source.\\" In 1929 the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act was enacted, establishing harsher penalties for drug users. This was to become the main drug regulation in Canada until the late 1960s. In 1954, the penalty for drug trafficking was doubled from seven to fourteen years. During that decade, the media published highly sensationalized reports of drug use amongst youths, even though the rate of drug use in Canada was actually declining. In 1961, the Narcotic Control Act made the possession of cannabis, amongst other drugs, an indictable offence and made the minimum sentence for drug trafficking fourteen years (as opposed to the previous maximum sentence). Between 1969 and 1973 the Commission of Inquiry into the Non Medical Use of Drugs (or the Le Dain Commission) examined the use of narcotics in Canada and recommended that the drug laws were changed to become more lenient and gradually decriminalize illicit drugs. Although consensus in Parliament appeared to be gradually turning in favour of implementing the Commission's recommendations, the drug laws remained unchanged, although a bill to remove cannabis from the Narcotic Control Act and create a new Part V of the Food and Drugs Act reducing sentences for all offences did pass the Senate but failed in the House of Commons. In 1988, advocating the use of cannabis or cannabis-related products (including hemp) became a crime punishable by $100,000 for a first offence and $300,000 for a second offence, meaning that simply publishing an opinion article with a favourable position on cannabis became illegal. The National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws Canada's office in Ontario was raided by police after being charged with breaking Section 462.2 of the Criminal Code for handing out brochures advocating the legalization of cannabis. In 1994, the Ontario Court of Justice ruled that Section 462.2 stifled freedom of expression and overturned the ban on literature, taking effect only in Ontario. The same year, an Ontario farmer was allowed to grow ten acres of cannabis on his property to research its agricultural potential. In 1996 the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act was passed. This law repealed the Narcotic Control Act and Parts III and IV of the Food and Drug Act (parts dealing with the advertisement of controlled substances). This Act classified drugs into eight schedules, I to VIII. While the punishments for trafficking illicit drugs in Schedules I and II increased to a maximum of life imprisonment, the penalties for the possession of drugs in Schedule VIII (up to 30g of cannabis and 1g of hashish) decreased to a maximum six months imprisonment and/or a maximum fine of $1000.Controlled Drugs and Substances Act 1996. Department of Justice, Government of Canada. Retrieved May 21, 2009. Since the enactment of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, various courts have struck down parts of the law and amendments have been passed by Parliament. In 2001, Canada became the first country in the world to legalize the use of cannabis for the terminally ill and three years later the Minister of Justice Irwin Cotler announced that legislation is being proposed in the House of Commons to allow for lesser penalties for the possession of cannabis, while toughening penalties for large drug operations. On October 17, 2018 cannabis became legal in Canada. The purpose of the Cannabis Act is to protect public health, public safety, and to \\"[...] create a strict legal framework to control the production, distribution, sale, and possession of cannabis across Canada\\". The Cannabis Act aims to accomplish 3 goals; keep cannabis out of the hands of youth, keep profits out of the pockets of criminals, and protect public health and safety by allowing adults access to legal cannabis. Individuals who are 18 years of age or older can, \\"[...] possess, in a public place, cannabis of one or more classes of cannabis the total amount of which, as determined in accordance with Schedule 3, is equivalent to more than 30 g of dried cannabis.\\" Canada has begun the process to pardon citizens with past convictions for cannabis possession. \\"Canada also plans to pardon citizens with past convictions for Cannabis possession\\". Various studies, research and guides are being created now that cannabis is legal. \\"[...] informational guides have been coupled with an adequate public education strategy that was only available after legalization.\\" more information can be found on cannabis laws in the page Cannabis in Canada and Cannabis laws of Canada by province or territory.  Effects  While street prices of cocaine in Canada is higher than they are in South American and East Asian countries; in the four-year period of 1997 to 2001 the street price of the drug fell by almost thirteen US dollars a gram, from $94.3/gram to $81.6/gram.Global Illicit Drug Trends.

These drug courts attempt to divert those that violate controlled drugs regulations from prisons into treatment programs. The Canadian model is based on the American drug court system, which aimed to reduce prison overcrowding after it was found that up to three-quarters of the prison population growth could be attributed to drug offenders. One example of a Canadian drug court is found in Toronto, where one has been operating since 1998. Of the 284 drug offenders referred to the Toronto drug court, over two-thirds have been expelled from the program.Toronto Drug Treatment Court . Cynthia Kirkby. Retrieved May 21, 2009.

Talbot) is a voluntary organisation in Southwark, London. The charity’s mission is to tackle poverty and promote social justice, providing specialist services supporting individuals with multiple and complex needs. Cambridge House offers a variety of direct and indirect services to residents of Southwark and the wider London area. Direct services include free legal advice & representation and professional advocacy. Cambridge House also provides arts & sports services for people with disabilities, youth empowerment projects, and 'Sports for Social Justice' programmes. Cambridge House's indirect services promote social innovation and systemic change through research and knowledge exchange, and by providing work and service spaces to other charities and civil society organisations. Cambridge House is a founder member of Locality and International Federation of Settlements, and part of a national and international networks of building-based and community-asset owned practitioners tackling poverty. The charity particularly focuses on tackling multiple deprivation, working to break cycles of disadvantage and crisis by providing a portfolio of specialist services which tackle the network of risk factors which maintain poverty and social marginalisation. Operating from a refurbished Grade II listed building in Walworth, the charity houses a number of other charities and community groups. In the financial year 2014-15, the charity's work reached 105,000 people.  History  Cambridge House began life in 1889 as part of the Settlement Movement. Founded by graduates and undergraduates from Trinity College Cambridge and Magdalene College Cambridge, it was set up to tackle poverty and deprivation in the poorest parts of South London. By 1897 Cambridge University as a whole was involved. University graduates and undergraduates lived at Cambridge House and performed voluntary work for the local Southwark community. Settlement residents were involved with the direct relief of poverty, including \\"the provision of country holidays for city children; the organisation of boys clubs; educational and recreational activities; a free legal service; involvement in a range of public bodies.\\" In 1900 a women's settlement called Talbot was established nearby, focussed on helping women and children. The organisations merged in 1972, becoming Cambridge House and Talbot. The organisation is still legally named as such. In 1894 Cambridge House established the UK’s first free legal advice service (now called the Law Centre). In the early 20th century, the organisation established the UK’s first Labour Exchange. In the 1930s, Cambridge House began providing skills workshops for the unemployed. In 1963 the organisation established the first Adult Literacy Scheme, which led to the Right to Read Campaign for adults. In 2015, the Supreme Court ruled in favour of Cambridge House Law Centre's client in Kanu (Appellant) v Southwark London Borough Council. The case was significant regarding the rights of vulnerable homeless people to housing. The Court overturned previous case law and guidance and established that: # An authority’s duty to the homeless under Part VII Housing Act 1996 is not to be influenced or affected by the resources available to the authority. # The correct comparator when assessing whether someone is vulnerable for the reasons in s189 (1)(c ) is an ordinary person if made homeless. # Support from a third party can be taken into account when assessing whether a person is vulnerable but that needs to be applied with “considerable circumspection” and that the fact of support in itself is not enough. # In the case of an applicant who has or may have a disability then at each stage of the decision making process the decision maker must have due regard to the need to achieve the goals of the Equality Act 2010 which include the need to eliminate discrimination, advance the equality of opportunity between those that have a disability and those that do not and to take active steps to meet the needs of those with a disability. S149 (1) (a)- ( c) Equality Act 2010. # That the consideration of the public sector equality duty must be exercised “in substance, with rigour and with an open mind”.

Etymology The name of the hospital, literally \\"refuge for the suffering,\\" derives from Psalms 9:10. History Misgav Ladach's original premises, 1915 Misgav Ladach hospital was established in 1854 in the Old City of Jerusalem, funded by the French Rothschild family. The hospital, founded to enable the Jews to be independent of Christian missionary hospitals, served the city's Jewish population in this location until the Israeli War of Independence in 1948, when the Jordanian army conquered the Jewish Quarter. The hospital reopened in Katamon in western Jerusalem, where it operated for 40 years as a maternity hospital. After moving into new premises, a 6,700-sq.m., three-story building on Hizkiyahu Hamelech Street, the non-profit Sephardi organization that owned it went bankrupt.Shapira family, partners offer $10 mln for Misgav Ladach The building was purchased by Kupat Holim Meuhedet, renovated and reopened in 2005.Misgav Ladach operating rooms shut down Medical innovationsMisgav Ladach method= The Misgav Ladach method for Cesarean section was developed by Michael Stark based on the Joel-Cohen incision originally introduced for hysterectomy. The technique was first introduced at Misgav Ladach and is now being used in medical centers around the world. The Misgav Ladach method eliminates many conventional steps, resulting in a quicker birth, less trauma for the mother and more rapid recovery. There is less need for painkillers and antibiotics, less scarring, less bleeding and less need for anaesthesia. Risk of exposure to HIV is minimized and the speed of the operation saves operating room and staff time.Misgav Ladach Birthing Method: A Working Visit to Vietnam and Laos =Natural childbirth= In the 1980s and early 1990s, Misgav Ladach was known for its personalized approach to childbirth. The hospital was an early supporter of natural childbirth techniques and the presence of fathers in the delivery room.

She had failed to include in her official poll accounts the amount she spent on advertisements, dressed up as news, in two Hindi dailies, Dainik Jagran and Amar Ujala, during her 2007 election campaign. The case arose out of an adjudication by the Press Council of India on the complaint of a losing candidate against the two dailies for publishing paid news. After holding the newspapers \\"guilty of ethical violations\\" and issuing a caution to them, the Council sent its adjudication to the ECI \\"for such action as deemed fit by them\\". No sitting MP or MLA before Ms Yadav, wife of a liquor baron and strongman, has ever been disqualified by the ECI on grounds of excessive expenditure – and certainly none on account of paid news. This is also the first verdict in the paid news saga – a scandal that has hurt the credibility of the Indian news media and demoralised journalists. In its 23-page order, the ECI made the wider and vital observation that \\"by suppressing expenditure on 'paid news' and filing an incorrect or false account, the candidate involved is guilty of not merely circumventing the law relating to election expenses but also of resorting to false propaganda by projecting a wrong picture and defrauding the electorate\\".

At age 13, he made his debut at the Concert Spirituel in Les Tuileries playing a Jean-Marie Leclair sonata for two violins.. Sometime around 1753 he received a prison sentence as the result of an affair with a Countess.. In 1762, he reached the peak of his career.

The cellist Martin Berteau named a sonata \\"La Gavinies\\". His seminal work is the 24 Matinées published in 1794, a compilation of violin studies that includes extremely complex passages with the main goal of developing bowing facility.

The Parish covers around 2,200 acres, situated 7 miles west of Uppingham, and 12 miles east of Leicester. According to the 2011 census the population of the parish was 330. The Anglican parish register for the parish dates back to 1568. The boundaries of the parish have not changed throughout the years, meaning that the parish's size remains the same as it did in 1568. In the 1887 Gazetter of the British Isles it is suggested that the town dates back to Norman rule stating: > \\"The church has a Norman tower, and is good.\\" none  Demographics  Population overview = left Over the years the population has been an ever changing demographic, with there being distinct peaks and troughs. In the 1801 census population sat at 230 people, which then grew, reaching the parish's peak population of 365 in 1851. Population rapidly declined after reaching a record low of 220 in 1961. Population then began to increase over time, growing to 330 in 2011. According to the 2011 census data, around 31% of the population was aged 35 to 54, and only 9% of the population aged 16–24. 98% of the population were White British, with only 4 people in the parish identifying as another ethnic group. However, 10 people were born outside of the UK. 72% of the parish's population identify as Christian, 26% identify as having no religion, or religion not stated, and only 0.9% identify as part of another religious community. = Occupation = When studying the occupational fields of the 1881 census one can see a clear difference between the jobs of men and women. Many of the women's occupations, 59.63% of the overall female population, is unknown, which would suggest that they were unemployed, most likely staying at home. The most common occupation type of employment for women was domestic services, at 16.91% of the female population, likely due to the presence of Keythorpe manor. The men at the time tended to pursue more manual labor jobs, mainly agriculture based, with 61.36% of the total male population working in agriculture. When looking at 2011 census data one can see that the divide between male and female employment has reduced, with only 4 women in the village not having a specific occupation. The most popular occupation for women to have in the village is human health and social work activities, at around 21.8%, and education at around 20.5% of the overall female population of the village. As for the males the type of work has diversified quite significantly, with a drop in agricultural work, with only 9 men working in this sector, unlike in 1881, when 52 worked in this sector. Although the majority of the male population work in wholesale and retail trade (18.3% of the population), there has been an increase in other occupations. = Health = Overall health in the village is good with the results of the 2011 census data showing that 46.6% of Tugby’s population were in 'very good health'. No one was in very bad health, with only 1.5% of the population in bad health. 87.9% of the population stated that their health did not limit their daily life. = Housing = The typical housing types in Tugby and Keythorpe are terraced, flats, semi-detached, and detached. House prices vary in value, some being of low value whilst others are very high. There is also a range of owner-occupied, social housing, and private rental homes, to match the needs of the community, with a NRS social grade of ABC1C2D.  Notable places  Church of St Thomas Becket = Tugby and Keythorpe is home to nine Grade II listed buildings, one of which is Church of St Thomas Becket, the parish's church, dedicated to St Thomas Becket. It is able to seat 300. The St Thomas Beckett parish church was awarded £10,700 by the Heritage Lottery Fund to invest in a project to help protect and conserve its tower. This work is planned take place over two years, hoping to prevent the deterioration of the tower which can be dated to Anglo Saxon and Norman construction. = Tugby C of E Primary school = Tugby C of E primary school, situated on Main Street, is the parish's only primary school. It has a very large catchment area in order to provide for the local rural community, including the villages Tilton on the Hill and Skeffington. = Keythorpe Valley Farm = Keythorpe Valley Farm specializes in breeding traditional rare breed British pigs such as the Gloucester Old Spot, British Saddleback, and Large Black, along with cattle, sheep and goats, of which their produce is sold in the farm shop. = Keythorpe Hall = Keythorpe Hall and Keythorpe 'Manor' are two completely separate properties a little distance apart. Keythorpe Hall was relocated stone by stone from an ancient site near Keythorpe Lakes Farm, to a more prominent position sometime in the early 1800s and became the principal seat of the 11th Lord Berners, Henry William Wilson. Keythorpe 'Manor', now a wedding venue, is in the Parish of East Norton and was originally called Norton Grange. Sometime in the late 1800s / early 1900s it became Keythorpe Grange but was recently renamed when it became a wedding venue. Keythorpe Grange was also owned by members of the Berners Barony, specifically Sir Raymond Robert Tyrwhitt-Wilson, as of 1912. In more recent years it sold in 2011 for £1,837,500.

Morphology Europolemur koenigswaldi fossil Europolemur klatti is part of a group of long-digited fossils, and most likely approximates early euprimate hand proportions. E. klatti has a grasping hallux and there is evidence that supports that E. klatti may have had nails instead of claws. This insinuates that stabilizing the tips of the digits and hand must have in some way been an important function for them and their lifestyle in their habitat. Relative to the forearm, the hand of E. klatti was large which may be related to vertical climbing or posture. The shape of the calcaneus resembles that found in Smilodectes and Notharctus and E. klatti had an average body mass of 1.7 kilograms. Dentition In 1995, two isolated upper molars belonging to E. klatti were found in an old lake deposit during excavations done by the \\"Naturhistorisches Museum Mainz/Landessammlung fur Naturkunde Rheinland-Pfalz\\". The museum determined that the molars (as well as a mandible with nearly complete dentition belonging to another cercamoiines, Periconodon) were representative of the first primates from the Middle Eocene Eckfeld maar in Southwest Eifel, Germany. E. klatti has a dental formula of (permanent dentition) and a deciduous dentition of . One of the most distinguishing characteristics of the genus Europolemur is the lack of a metaconule. The dental anatomy of their genus is described in more detail by Franzen as consisting of \\"upper canines big and pointed; upper molars without postflexus; postprotocrista prominent; no metaconulus; M3 smaller and shorter than M2; P4 much shorter than broad, with a weak parastyle; P4 with a small and unicuspid talonid and a metaconid present to absent; protocristid of M nearly transversely oriented. Protoconid of P3 little higher than that of P4.\\" ReferencesLiterature cited= * *Covert, H. 1990. Phylogenetic Relationships among the Notharctinae of North America.

His negotiations ultimately failed and the new revolutionary authorities of the Islamic Republic of Iran ordered the arrest of Moftizadeh and several of his followers.

Rise to Influence  Ahmad Moftizadeh was a Kurdish nationalist and Islamist leader that emerged during the Shah's rule of Iran just prior to the time of the Islamic Revolution of 1979. He was widely regarded as one of the most influential Sunni personalities in Iran and rose to fame among the larger Kurdish community in Iran after being targeted by government authorities of the Shah of Iran for his demands for Kurdish autonomy. Moftizadeh was the son of the longest serving Mufti of the Iranian Kurdistan region.Ezzatyar, Ali (2016), The Last Mufti of Iranian Kurdistan: Ethnic and Religious Implications in the Greater Middle East, Springer, p. 59, Like his father, he performed his religious scholarship in neighboring Iraqi Kurdistan due to the restrictions on Sunni religious schools in Iran.Nowicki, Goran. Republic of Kurdistan. Debating World Issues. PostGlobal. January 2008. His time in Iraqi Kurdistan also allowed him to learn about the Kurdish national struggle and its failings from an early age.Ezzatyar, Ali (2016), The Last Mufti of Iranian Kurdistan: Ethnic and Religious Implications in the Greater Middle East, Springer, p. 64, Throughout his teens, Moftizadeh accompanied his father on visits to the University of Tehran where his father taught courses on Islamic philosophy. After his father died, Moftizadeh chose not to assume the clerical role in the same capacity as his father, and instead, accepted a permanent role at the University of Tehran as a lecturer of Islamic studies.Ezzatyar, Ali (2016), The Last Mufti of Iranian Kurdistan: Ethnic and Religious Implications in the Greater Middle East, Springer, p. 71, During his time in Tehran, Moftizadeh developed relations with members of the outlawed Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iran and eventually became a prominent member of the organization during one of his visits back to Iranian Kurdistan. Moftizadeh regularly convened with other Kurdish activists at the Tehran home of Abdul Rahman Ilkhanizadeh, a former minister in the short-lived Kurdish Republic of Mahabad. Ilkhanizadeh, also known as Hajj Abdul Rahman Mohtadi, was the father of another prominent Kurdish leader, Abdullah Mohtadi, and had a daughter, Khadijah Mohtadi, to whom Moftizadeh would marry.Ezzatyar, Ali (2016), The Last Mufti of Iranian Kurdistan: Ethnic and Religious Implications in the Greater Middle East, Springer, p. 84, In 1964, after several months of being monitored by Iran's secret police, SAVAK, Moftizadeh was arrested and became a political prisoner for his activities in the Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iran. He spent one year in prison where he was constantly tortured before being released but the SAVAK would continue monitoring his life for a number of years.Ezzatyar, Ali (2016), The Last Mufti of Iranian Kurdistan: Ethnic and Religious Implications in the Greater Middle East, Springer, p. 91, Banned from any public positions after his release, Moftizadeh used his money to open a grocery store, which he quickly converted to a homeless shelter and resumed his work in activism.Ezzatyar, Ali (2016), The Last Mufti of Iranian Kurdistan: Ethnic and Religious Implications in the Greater Middle East, Springer, p. 92, After several calls from his father's followers, he decided to move back to Iranian Kurdistan with his wife Khadijah and his son, Jiyan.Ezzatyar, Ali (2016), The Last Mufti of Iranian Kurdistan: Ethnic and Religious Implications in the Greater Middle East, Springer, p. 93, Moftizadeh assumed his father's role in the Kurdish city of Sanandaj as the Friday prayer leader in the 1970s where he began to gather support among religious Kurds concerning the mistreatment of both the ethnic Kurdish and religious Sunni minority in Iran.\\"Iran after the victory of 1979's Revolution\\". Iran Chamber Society. He also drew support from religious Kurds that were dissatisfied with the current nationalist Kurdish movements in Iran through his preaching of nonviolence in response to Kurdish infighting throughout the region. His followers began calling him the “Ghandhi of Islam” for his advocacy of peaceful disobedience as a means to achieve political change.Ezzatyar, Ali (2016), The Last Mufti of Iranian Kurdistan: Ethnic and Religious Implications in the Greater Middle East, Springer, p. 176, Moftizadeh and some of his supporters were imprisoned by the Shah's government in 1976 when his political activities in Sanandaj became known to the local authorities but were released less than a month later. The Shah was under immense pressure to release religious figures from prison.  Leadership during Islamic Revolution  By the time the Islamic Revolution swept Iran in 1978, Ahmad Moftizadeh had already developed his own faction of Kurdish followers that supported the notion of a unified Islamic and democratic state of Iran with special autonomy for the Kurdish people.\\"Iran after the victory of 1979's Revolution\\". Iran Chamber Society. In 1978, Moftizadeh founded the Maktabe Koran or the Quranic School of Thought in Sanandaj.\\"Iran: Freedom of Expression and Association in the Kurdish Regions\\". Humand Rights Watch. January 9, 2009. As a leader of a large segment of people in the Kurdish city of Sanandaj, he drew opposition from communist and nationalist groups early on for supporting the notion of an Islamic state. However, despite a brief confrontation and continued heavy disagreements about the role of Kurds in the Islamic Revolution, Moftizadeh maintained a neutral relationship with other more influential nationalist factions such as the secular Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iran.Nowicki, Goran. Republic of Kurdistan. Debating World Issues. PostGlobal. January 2008. After multiple discussions with the leader of the revolution, Ayatollah Khomeini, through intermediaries, Moftizadeh was reported to have said that the \\"guarantee of autonomy for the Kurds is in my pocket\\". The new leaders of the Islamic Republic reportedly offered a number of guarantees to Moftizadeh, which included some autonomy for the Kurds, in return for his followers' support of the revolution.\\"Iran after the victory of 1979's Revolution\\".

Imprisonment and torture  Within three years of the Islamic Revolution and just prior to military operations against Iranian Kurdistan by the new Islamic Republic of Iran,Nikou, Semira N. Timeline of Military and Security Events. United States Institute of Peace. The Iran Primer. Ahmad Moftizadeh had announced that his agreements with the new government were completely violated, and that he no longer supported the Islamic State. He decided to resign from the consultative body of which he had been a member and unofficially gave up his leadership role over the Kurdish faction that he had developed. In 1983, Iranian authorities arrested Moftizadeh on the account that he was endangering national security and a court later sentenced him to 10 years in prison. The specific charges against him were never publicly announced.\\"Iran: Freedom of Expression and Association in the Kurdish Regions\\". Humand Rights Watch. January 9, 2009. While in prison, Moftizadeh reportedly suffered continuous brutal torture at the hands of authorities. Just six months after his release from prison, he died. Individuals close to Moftizadeh claimed that nearly all the bones in his body had been repeatedly broken and blamed his death on the torture and mistreatment by Iranian authorities.\\"Iran: Freedom of Expression and Association in the Kurdish Regions\\". Humand Rights Watch. January 9, 2009. After Moftizadeh's death, some of his followers including influential figures - Sabhani Naser and Farough Farsad - were arrested and killed by Iranian authorities in order to ensure that any further movement developing under Moftizadeh's faction would be exterminated.

Camino de los chilenos ran a length of about 1000 km from the Buenos Aires Province to the mountain passes of Neuquén Province. The cattle were traded in Chile for weapons and alcoholic beverages. This trade has been pointed out as the single most important cause of the war that affected the southern provinces of Argentina during large parts of the 19th century. Therefore, the demand for cattle by Chilean merchants was fueling the conflict in Argentina. To counter the cattle raids a trench called Zanja de Alsina was built by Argentina in the pampas in the 1870s. The use of this trade route effectively ended with the Conquest of the Desert (1876-1878) carried out by the Argentine Army. Sources *Richard O.

Drake (20 February 1931 – 8 October 2012) was an English professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1950s and 1960s. He played at representative level for Great Britain, England and Cumberland, and at club level for Heworth A.R.L.F.C., Hull FC, Leeds and York as a back, and later a forward, during the era of contested scrums. Background Bill Drake was born in Workington, Cumberland, and was the younger (by 10-minutes) twin brother of fellow rugby league footballer; Jim Drake, exactly four years to the day after the death of his twin brother Jim Drake, Bill Drake died aged 81 in York Hospital, North Yorkshire, England. Playing career Drake won 10-caps for Cumberland from 1953, and played in Hull FC's 10-9 victory over Halifax in the Championship Final during the 1955–56 season at Maine Road, Manchester on Saturday 12 May 1956. He played right-, i.e. number 12, in Hull FC's 13-30 defeat by Wigan in the 1958–59 Challenge Cup Final during the 1958–59 season at Wembley Stadium, London on Saturday 9 May 1959. Drake missed the 1959–60 Challenge Cup Final during the 1959–60 season though injury, being replaced by Mike Smith who became the first player to ever make a first team début in a Challenge Cup Final. Drake won a cap for England while at Hull in 1962 against France, and won a cap for Great Britain while at Hull in 1962 also against France. Drake was transferred from Hull to Leeds in 1963 for £1,500 (based on increases in average earnings, this would be approximately £56,890 in 2013). Drake played left-, i.e. number 8, in Leeds' 2-18 defeat by Wakefield Trinity in the 1964–65 Yorkshire County Cup Final during the 1964–65 season at Fartown Ground, Huddersfield on Saturday 31 October 1964.

Dating from the mid- to late-4th century AD, this hoard is a collection of thirty-three silver spoons and three silver strainers, twenty-two gold finger rings, four gold bracelets, four necklace pendants, five gold chain necklaces and two pairs of necklace-clasps, a gold amulet designed as a pendant, an unmounted engraved gem, four beads (one emerald and three of glass), and a gold belt-buckle decorated with a dancing satyr. A small cylindrical lidded box made from shale also belonged to the hoard.  Discovery  The find was made under very unfortunate circumstances. The finder was metal-detecting without the knowledge and permission of the owners of the site, which had recently been cleared for building work, and made his discovery late on a November day, in failing light. He recovered the material in great haste, probably overlooking some small items, and because he knew he had no legal right to search in that area, he did not, as the law requires, report his discovery to the authorities. Instead, he unwisely attempted to sell the objects he had found to private buyers. By the time archaeologists learned of the find several months later, the findspot had been built over, making proper archaeological investigation impossible. It was not even possible to question the finder about the circumstances, because by the time the material arrived at the British Museum for study, he was terminally ill, and he died about a month later, in July 1980. Persistent rumours that the treasure originally included coins have never been confirmed or convincingly rejected, but even if there were no coins, it is quite likely that the group as we see it now is incomplete. The full account of the circumstances of the discovery is related in the standard catalogue. This lack of information makes it particularly difficult to speculate on the nature of the hoard and the purpose of its concealment in antiquity.  Silver objects  The silver tableware in the hoard comprises three strainers and 33 spoons, of two types. Seventeen of the spoons are cochlearia, with long tapered handles, and the other sixteen are the larger ligulae or cigni, with bowls about the size of a modern dessert spoon and short, coiled handles ending in birds' heads. Many of the spoons bear pagan inscriptions to Faunus, a minor Roman god who had many characteristics in common with the Greek Pan. There is no overtly Christian symbolism in the hoard, though one spoon is decorated with the figure of a fish, which can often be an oblique reference to Christianity.Johns & Potter 1983, catalogue no. 67 Bacchic iconography is obvious in the group, and was traditional in Roman culture, but in the late Roman period, many Bacchic motifs were adopted and given new interpretations by Christians. Nevertheless, at this date, the end of the 4th century AD, there was no obstacle to placing unequivocally Christian symbols and inscriptions on personal possessions, so that their absence here is noteworthy. The openly, and probably exclusively, pagan iconography remains one of the most interesting and unusual aspects of the assemblage. The dedications, such as DEIFAVNIAVSECI (RIB 2420.21) (literally, 'of the God Faunus Ausecus') are engraved in the bowls of both the cochlearia and cigni. The epithets or by-names applied to Faunus in the inscriptions have been identified as containing Celtic (Gaulish or British) linguistic elements, supporting the supposition that any cult of Faunus which they represent was Romano-British, not one that consisted of devotees from elsewhere in the Roman Empire. The inscriptions were discussed in the published catalogue by the late Kenneth Jackson. It has been suggested that it is unlikely that these items were intended to be used for ordinary domestic dining, and that their eventual deposition may be interpreted as a ritual act rather than a practical one (See Religion in Ancient Rome). However, since both pagan and Christian inscriptions are regularly found on Roman jewellery and domestic tableware, and as the actual motivation for the concealment of the Thetford material itself is unknown, this view is open to debate. The unusual composition of the group of gold objects is actually somewhat better evidence of a non-domestic background than the decoration and inscriptions of the silver assemblage (see comments on the range of finger-rings in the following section). The suspicion that the hoard is incomplete undermines any detailed analysis of these matters, but if the gold and silver objects were connected in any way with pagan cult practices, which is certainly a possibility, then the anti-pagan Theodosian edicts of the 390s would have provided good practical (rather than ritual) reasons for the concealment of the material from the authorities.  Gold jewellery  Shale box, part of the hoard, probably containing the smaller items. The gold belt-buckle is an unusual find, and would have been worn by a man; we know that belts decorated in various forms were important symbols of office or status in late Roman times, though few elements of them have survived.Henig (1996) 168-169 Its decoration, of a satyr carrying a pedum (shepherd's crook) and a bunch of grapes, accords with other hints at Bacchic imagery throughout the assemblage, in both the jewellery and the tableware. For example, the running feline animal on spoon (cochlear) (item 66), originally identified as a panther or leopard, and referred to as the 'panther spoon', is certainly a reference to Bacchus, who was regularly accompanied by a panther or leopard (Panthera pardus), or by a tiger (Panthera tigris). In fact, the animal on Thetford spoon (item 66) is probably a tiger: the rendering of the stripes as very short curved lines, easily mistaken for spots, was common in Roman art. The rings from the hoard The gold finger-rings could have been worn by either men or women, though the bracelets, and necklaces with pendants were chiefly feminine jewels at this date. Many of the rings display elaborate filigree work, typical of late-Roman taste, and a few are of highly unusual design. The tiny horned, Pan-like head that forms the bezel of ring (item 23) appears to be unparalleled, and may well be intended as a reference to Faunus, while the design of (item 7), two birds flanking a vase, is both a standard Bacchic image, eventually adopted in Christian iconography, and possibly something more specific in this instance. The birds, even though they are at a very small scale, have the appearance of woodpeckers, and picus, the Latin name for birds of this kind, was also the name of the father of Faunus in some sources (Virgil, Aeneid 7, 48). Much of the jewellery will have been designed and selected for its talismanic, religious or personal significance. A gold amulet pendant, intended for suspension around the neck (and with parallels including one from York), was filled with sulphur, possibly because of its apotropaic qualities. One ring is set with an engraved gem of brown chalcedony 13 × 9.5 mm. Upon it is depicted a cock-headed, snake-legged deity known as an Anguipede, holding a shield which is inscribed in Greek with ΩΑΙ, reversed ΙΑΩ or (iao), a magical word often associated with this deity (see Voces mysticae). Although set in a closed-back setting, this gem was also inscribed on its reverse side with the Greek ΑΒΡΑϹΞϹΑΒΑΩΘ which translates as Abrasax Sabaoth also a word of power and associated name of the deity. It is interesting that a Greek-inscribed charm appears in a hoard primarily associated with an Italian (Latin) minor deity (Faunus), though many other Greek inscriptions are known from Roman Britain, and other examples of late- Antique ‘magical gems’ have also been found in Latin-speaking provinces. A matching pair of bracelets (items 24 and 25), which at the time of finding and publication could be paralleled only by similar bracelets from the 1841 Lyon jewellery hoard, which is of somewhat earlier date, have now been paralleled by a set of four matching bracelets from the Hoxne hoard found in 1992, the date of which appears to be close to that of the deposition of the Thetford find. It has been suggested that all the objects \\"may well have been commissioned by a group of intellectuals who fervently believed in the old values and who interred the objects when serious persecution of non-Christians began in the 390s\\". Most of the gold objects appear to be in fresh, apparently unworn condition. Roman gold, which is of high purity (in this case, with a mean gold content of over 94 percent; is soft, and quickly shows signs of use. This pristine condition is one of the unusual features of the Thetford jewellery assemblage. Most of the rings have design and workmanship characteristics in common that suggest they may be the products of a single workshop, while the construction of the matching pair of bracelets is also paralleled in the form of two of the rings (items 10 and 12). It would be somewhat surprising for a single owner, or even a family, to possess such a comparatively large number of rings which seem to have been acquired from a single source at the same time. Personal collections of jewellery usually contain pieces of different ages and conditions.  Significance  The Thetford assemblage, in spite of the sadly inadequate details of its discovery and provenance, remains one of the most intriguing and unusual of the many late-Roman precious-metal hoards from Britain. Although the combination of silver tableware and gold personal ornament (with or without coins) is common enough in precious-metal hoards of this period from Britain, the fact that the inscriptions, supported by the visual imagery, allude to pagan, rather than Christian, belief towards the end of the 4th century, is important. Attempts have been made to interpret the hoard as Christian,Dorothy Watts, 'The Thetford treasure: a reappraisal', Antiquaries Journal 68 (1988), pp.57-9 but remain somewhat unconvincing when applied to objects current at a period when paganism, rather than Christianity, was out of favour.

It is the sodium salt of butyric acid. It has various effects on cultured mammalian cells including inhibition of proliferation, induction of differentiation and induction or repression of gene expression. As such, it can be used in lab to bring about any of these effects. Specifically, butyrate treatment of cells results in histone hyperacetylation, and butyrate itself inhibits class I histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity, specifically HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, and butyrate can be used in determining histone deacetylene in chromatin structure and function. Inhibition of HDAC activity is estimated to affect the expression of only 2% of mammalian genes. In the lab, sodium butyrate is usually found as a white, water-soluble, crystalline solid. The chemical is notable for having a very strong, unpleasant smell that lingers. When working with sodium butyrate, gloves, eye protection and respiratory masks are advised for safety purposes. The compound is found in human diet, notably produced in large amounts from dietary fiber in the gut and present in Parmesan cheese and butter.http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/content/61/4/797 Nevertheless, the most common source of sodium butyrate in the gut is from consumption of legumes, which along with fiber have been associated with delayed aging and healthspan.https://www.wsj.com/articles/want-great-longevity-and-health-it- takes-a-village-1432304395 See also * Butyric acid ReferencesFurther reading * Category:Butyrates Category:GABA analogues Category:Organic sodium salts Category:Histone deacetylase inhibitors ","title":"Sodium butyrate"},{"id":"22886602","text":"The Bizerte Crisis (, ʾAḥdāth Bīzart) occurred in July 1961 when Tunisia imposed a blockade on the French naval base at Bizerte, Tunisia, hoping to force its evacuation. The crisis culminated in a three-day battle between French and Tunisian forces that left some 630 Tunisians and 24 French dead and eventually led to France ceding the city and naval base to Tunisia in 1963. Ferryville Military zone in southern Tunisia Background After Tunisia gained independence from France in 1956, France remained in control of the city and its naval base, a strategic port on the Mediterranean, which played an important part in French operations during the Algerian War. France had promised to negotiate the future of the base, but had so far refused to remove it. Tunisia was further infuriated upon learning that France planned to expand the airbase. In 1961, Tunisian forces surrounded and blockaded the naval base in hopes of forcing France to abandon its last holdings in the country. After Tunisia warned France against any violations of Tunisian airspace, the French defiantly sent a helicopter. Tunisian troops responded by firing warning shots. In response to the blockade, 800 French paratroopers were sent in by the French Government as a show of force. However, when the transport planes with the paratroopers landed on the airfield, Tunisian troops engaged them with targeted machine gun fire. In response, French jets supported by troops armed with 105mm howitzers vastly attacked the Tunisian roadblocks, destroying them completely. French tanks and armoured cars then rolled into Tunisian territory, and fired into the town of Menzel-Bourguiba, killing 27 soldiers and civilians. The following day, the French launched a full-scale invasion of the town of Bizerte. The Tunisians' few artillery posts were destroyed by rockets fired by French planes. Tanks and paratroopers penetrated into the city from the south, while marines stormed the harbour from landing craft. Three French cruisers were positioned offshore. Tunisian soldiers, paramilitaries, and hastily organised civilian volunteers engaged the French in heavy street fighting, but were forced back by vastly superior French forces. The French overran the town on 23 July 1961. Aftermath Bizerte Martyrs monument Initially the United Nations was unable to carry out any sort of substantial action against the French, which angered the Tunisian authorities.

Latex paint is collected at collection facilities in many countries and shipped to paint-recycling facilities.  How paint is recycled  There are many ways that paint can be recycled. Most often, the highest quality of latex paint is sorted out and turned back into recycled paint that can be used. Recycled paint is environmentally preferable to new paint, while still maintaining comparable quality. In many cases, reusable paints of the same color are pumped into a tank where the material is mixed and tested. The paint is adjusted with additives and colorants as necessary. Finally, the paint is fine filtered and packaged for sale. Paint that cannot be reused has other environmentally friendly uses. Non-reusable paint can be made into a product used in cement manufacturing, thereby recycling virtually 100% of the original paint. Recycling one gallon of paint could save 13 gallons of water, 1 quart of oil, and 250,000 gallons of water pollution, 13.74 pounds of , save enough energy to power the average home for 3 hours, or cook 6 meals in a microwave oven, or blow dry someone's hair 27 times.  Paint Product Stewardship Initiative Paint recycling by countryCanada= In Ontario, Stewardship Ontario oversees the collection of waste paint from consumers and diversion from landfill to meet targets approved by the Ministry of the Environment through a program called the Orange Drop Program. The Orange Drop program is an extensive and growing network of collection sites—drop-off locations for paint leftovers and other special materials that can’t go in the Blue Box or the garbage. As an Orange Drop- approved transporter and processor, Loop Recycled Products Inc. takes leftover paint, collected through Stewardship Ontario, and turns it into 12 shades of premium, affordable and environmentally friendly recycled paint. Reusing top- quality residual paint (on average, the original retail value of a gallon of incoming paint is approximately $30) enables Loop to create premium products without the raw material costs and energy consumption needed to make paint from scratch. Since 2012, Loop Recycled Products Inc. has diverted over 6 million litres of paint from disposal in Ontario’s landfills, incineration and waterways and is committed to innovation and solving Canada’s waste paint problem. In February 2015 Waste Diversion Ontario approved Product Care as the new Ontario waste paint stewardship operator effectively replacing Stewardship Ontario. In March 2017, Colortech ECO Paints introduced its line of recycled wall and floor paints to specific retail markets consisting of a large network of liquidation and discount stores across Canada and the United States., as well as exporting large quantities to West Africa and South America. Alberta’s paint recycling program started accepting leftover, unwanted paint on April 1, 2008. It is estimated that about 30 million liters of paint is sold in Alberta each year. On average, 5 to 10 percent of this ends up as waste, which can pose environmental and health risks if disposed of improperly. Paint contains many components that have great potential for reuse, recycling and recovery. The Paint Recycling Alberta program enables these products to be handled and recycled in an environmentally safe manner, reducing their impact on the environment. The program is funded through environmental fees charged on the sale of new paint in Alberta. The fees are put into a dedicated fund that can only be used to manage the paint recycling program. The paint is sorted into different streams and sent to registered processors to be recycled into new paint, used in other products or in energy recovery, or sent for proper disposal if necessary. Any processor that receives paint must be registered with the Paint Recycling Program and meet all applicable environmental, transportation, health & safety, and local requirements. Calibre Environmental LTD. (CEL) located in Calgary, Alberta, became a key part in 2008 of the new Alberta Paint Stewardship program which significantly increased the recycling of unused latex paint from across the province of Alberta. Calibre Environmental Ltd. currently processes about 1.6 million kilograms of latex paint annually, which equates to the successful recycling of one million litres of quality latex paint per year. =New ZealandUnited Kingdom= In the UK reusable leftover paint can be donated to Community RePaint, a national network of paint reuse schemes. The network comprises local schemes run by not-for-profit organisations, local authorities or waste management companies, in the Community RePaint network. The schemes collect surplus paint from trade sources i.e. painters, decorators, retailers, manufacturers, and/or leftover paint donated by householders at council household waste and recycling centres (also known as tips). The paint is then sorted by staff and volunteers before being redistributed to local charities, community groups, families and individuals in need. The Community RePaint network, is sponsored by Dulux (part of AkzoNobel), managed by an environmental consultancy, Resource Futures and has been cited as an example of best practice for the management of surplus paint in a report by the European Commission and by DEFRA in Guidance on Applying the Waste Hierarchy. There are also a handful of companies recycling paint in the UK, but only two reprocessing waste paint, back into the quality of virgin paint; Newlife Paints. Newlife Paints was formed in 2008 after Keith Harrison, an industrial chemist, developed a process that converted waste emulsion paint back into full quality, commercial grade paint. Castle RePaint, part of the social enterprise company Castle Furniture also consolidates unwanted emulsion paint into brand new 'RePaint' in a range of colours. =United States= Concerns about the life cycle of paint have led to the creation of PaintCare, a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization established to represent paint manufacturers (paint producers) to plan and operate paint stewardship programs in the United States in those states that pass paint stewardship laws. Paint stewardship law aims to enable the paint industry to implement a collection program that allows consumers to take their leftover, unwanted paint to a collection site to be collected and recycled. Legislation mandating the creation of the PaintCare program has been enacted in eight states since 2009: Oregon, California, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Vermont, Minnesota, Maine, and Colorado. Legislation has also been passed for the District of Columbia; PaintCare anticipates beginning the District's paint stewardship program in September 2016. PaintCare is responsible for promoting the reuse of post-consumer architectural paint (leftover paint) and providing for the collection, transport, and processing of this paint using the hierarchy of \\"reduce, reuse, recycle,\\" and proper disposal. Most PaintCare locations are at paint retailers who volunteer to take back paint. These retailers take back paint during regular business hours, making paint recycling and disposal much more convenient for the public. Paint is shipped to companies such as GDB International, Amazon Paint, American Paint Recyclers (Ohio), Metro Paint (Oregon), UCI Environmental (Nevada) and Kelly Moore, Visions Paint Recycling, Inc (California)& Williams Paint Recycling Company. In the Southern California area, Acrylatex Coatings & Recycling, Inc. accepts unused/unwanted latex paints for reprocessing into a viable resource of recycled paints in 20-standard colors. In the southeastern United States Atlanta Paint Disposal has a paint recycling program with drop off locations in Atlanta, Georgia. In the northeast The Paint Exchange, LLC recycles latex paint under the brand recolor®. In the Mid-Atlantic RepaintUSA also recycles paint with a focus on businesses, public and private sources. A new charitable organization known as The Global Paint for Charity incorporated in Georgia, US, has as its mission to collect leftover paint from residents and businesses nationwide and use it for global housing rehabilitation projects, including homes, schools, hospitals, jails and churches for vulnerable families in developing countries. They partner with non-profit organizations with existing operations in these continents for paint distribution. Through the support of their donors and partners they are able to improve communities, increase access to quality paints and protect the environment. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that every homeowner in the US has 3 to 4 gallons of leftover paints in their basement, and 10 percent of those paints ends up in landfills. One gallon of improperly disposed paint has the ability to pollute up to 250,000 gallons of water. By participating in the program, individuals and businesses will take greater steps to protect the environment, and improve living conditions for vulnerable populations throughout the world. If you would like to support the Global Paint for Charity, they encourage you to take action today. Improve access of high-quality paints to vulnerable populations around the world. Nearly 2.5 billion people in developing countries live on less than $2 a day. For them, paint is very expensive. In these settings, it is very difficult for families to secure sufficient income for their basic needs (including but not limited to: food, medicine, water, clothes, school supplies, and shelter). When making consumption choices that involve spending on their basic needs there is nothing left to spend on paint. The paint shortage affects many other areas of the world, where communities lack even the most basic need and materials to uplift their people. For the world’s poorest communities, home isn’t just where the heart is. Dirt walls and neglected communities are not attractive to tourists, putting those who cannot afford paint, not only at the greatest risk of life-threatening of bad germs but also lack of economic opportunities. Since it started years ago, as many as 500–6000 gallons of paint have been shipped at a time to developing countries, including Kenya, Uganda,Liberia, Benin, Cameroon, Ghana, Guinea, Bahamas, Panama, Haiti, Dominican Republic, Honduras, El Salvador, Guyana, Jamaica and Mexico, 890 volunteers have painted 10,000 family homes and 320 schools and orphanages with over 280,000 tons of donated paint from businesses and residences. Global Paint for Charity continues to expand and impact our communities around the world. They do this through working directly with their volunteers, donors, and partners. From developing paint projects that engage their employees in the beautification of the community; to run frequent local paint drives to support their program. Global Paint for Charity has recently won the National Energy Globe Award of United States 2017. With more than 178 participating countries and over 2,000 project submissions annually the Energy Globe Award is today's most prestigious environmental prize worldwide. The Austrian Honorary Consul General, Mr. Ferdinand C. Seefried hosted an exclusive ceremony to present the National Energy Globe Award 2017 for the United States to Mr. Rony Delgarde, Global Paint for Charity.

Abuse by countryAustralia= In Australia, there were allegations that during the 1970s sexual abuses took place at the junior campus of St Patrick's College and St Alipius Primary School in Ballarat, Victoria. After investigation, Brothers Robert Best, Edward Dowlan and Stephen Francis Farrell were all convicted of sex crimes. Dowlan and Best were later transferred to the senior campus, and continued to offend.Ellingsen, Peter. Ballarat's good men of the cloth. The Age Newspaper, June 14, 2002. \\"Four of the school's brothers and their chaplain, Gerald Ridsdale, were accused of sexually assaulting children — all but one, who died before charges could be laid, have been convicted.\\" Robert Best taught at Catholic primary and secondary schools in Ballarat, Box Hill, and Geelong (all in Victoria, Australia) between the 1960s and 1980s. He was convicted by a jury after pleading guilty to more than 40 child sex offences against dozens of students, some as young as eight years old. Robert Best was sentenced to fourteen years and nine months jail on August 8, 2011. The Commissioners found that in one instance a complaint was made to a Brother Nangle about Brother Dowlan's putting his hands down students’ pants; a student was required to apologize to the school assembly for “spreading lies”. (Dowlan was later jailed for multiple instances of sexual abuse.) Dowlan (Ted Bales) pleaded guilty to 33 counts of indecently assaulting boys under the age of 16 and one count of gross indecency between 1971 and 1986. The judge found that he had preyed on vulnerable boys as young as eight years old over a 14-year period at six different schools from the first year he became a Christian Brother in 1971. Dowlan has been jailed twice, first in 1996 for six-and-a-half years and then again in 2015.Blair Smith had been one of the first detectives to properly investigate Christian Brother abuse in Victoria, his work in the early 1990s leading to the conviction of Edward Dowlan. The Royal Commission also found that the Christian Brothers spent almost $1.5 Million defending Best, Dowlan, and Farrell. The Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse found that Gerald Leo Fitzgerald, a Christian Brother, was moved to new locations with continued access to children after abuse allegations had been made. One victim described the type of behavior of Fitzgerald to the Commission: \\"...Brother Fitzgerald was his grade 3 teacher in 1974. He said that at the end of school every Friday Brother Fitzgerald would line up his students and kiss them goodbye. He kissed some with his tongue.\\" He died in 1987 before any charges were laid against him. Minutes of the meeting of the Christian Brothers Provincials with their lawyers on December 7, 1993, showed that the meeting was not focused on settling the proceedings: the concern was the cost, and there was no sentiment of recognizing the suffering of the survivors.Report of Case Study no. 11 - Congregation of Christian Brothers in Western Australia response to child sexual abuse at Castledare Junior Orphanage, St Vincent’s Orphanage Clontarf, St Mary’s Agricultural School Tardun and Bindoon Farm School PDF at official web site, 19 December 2014 In May 2013, the Christian Brothers admitted to Victoria's parliamentary inquiry into child abuse that they did what they could to defend order members accused of sexual assault against children.Morris, Madeleine. \\"Christian Brothers spent $1m defending paedophile\\", ABC News (Australia), Australia, 3 May 2013. Retrieved on 3 May 2013. During the 2016 Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse in Ballarat it was found that 853 children were sexually abused by one or more Christian Brothers with the average age of 13. 281 Christian Brothers have had abuse complaints substantiated, and the Christian Brothers have paid $37.3 million in compensation. During the Ballarat Case Study of the Royal Commission it was found that Glynis McNeight, a private investigator, was paid by the Christian Brothers (through a retained law firm) to investigate two individuals who had alleged having been sexually abused by Brother Edward Dowlan. McNeight's report was tabled that contained a strategy to manipulate witnesses such as a victim could \\"easily be torn down in the witness box\\" and \\"the person himself is a very nervous, excitable type who will reduce to tears and bad language easily\\". It was also shown that the Christian Brothers knew of abuse at the hands of Brothers but did not tell police and spent almost $1.5 million defending pedophile Brothers Robert Best, Edward Dowlan and Stephen Farrell. =Canada= The Christian Brothers in Canada more than 300 former pupils alleged physical and sexual abuse at the Mount Cashel Orphanage in Newfoundland. When allegations of physical and sexual abuse started to surface in the late 1980s, the government, police and local church leaders conspired in an unsuccessful cover-up. In Ontario in January 1993 the Christian Brothers reached a financial settlement totaling $23 million with 700 former students who alleged abuse. Allegations of sexual abuse at Mount Cashel Boys Home orphanage in Newfoundland (Canada) led to a royal commission, (The Hughes Inquiry) and further investigations followed into allegations at other institutions across Canada. =Ireland= In Ireland, during the latter part of the 20th century, corporal punishment was casual, frequent and brutal in Artane Industrial School, which was run by Christian Brothers. Artane's staff included a number of Brothers who had been warned for “embracing and fondling” boys. Accused Brothers were excused, lightly admonished or, typically, moved to other institutions. In Ireland in March 1998, the Congregation of the Christian Brothers published half-page advertisements in newspapers apologizing to former pupils who had been ill- treated whilst in their care. The advertising campaign expressed \\"deep regret\\" on behalf of the Christian Brothers and listed telephone lines which former pupils could ring if they needed help. ;Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse In the Irish Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse's five-volume report of its investigation of systemic abuse of children in Ireland, the Congregation of Christian Brothers, which was the largest provider of residential care for boys in the country, received more allegations of abuse than all of the other male religious orders combined. Artane was the largest industrial school. The Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse found that Artane was under-staffed by a small number of largely inexperienced and untrained Brothers. In 2003, the order took legal action against the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, to prevent the Commission from naming deceased brothers and brothers who were too old to competently defend themselves. The High Court rejected the challenge, but did stipulate that the Commission must take into account the corroboration of accusations and the testing of witness evidence, and to allow the representatives of deceased brothers to cross-examine witnesses. However, Justice Seán Ryan later overruled this when he took over the commission, and declared that individual perpetrators of abuse would not be named unless they had already been convicted The congregation issued a statement saying \\"\\"The Christian Brothers accept, with shame, the findings of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse ... The congregation is deeply sorry for the hurt we have caused - not just for the mistakes of the past, but for the inadequacy of our responses over recent years.\\" ;Financial settlements In late November 2009 the organization announced they would supply a €161 million (£145 million sterling) package as part of reparations for child abuse in Ireland.Catholic order pays out for abuse, BBC News, 25 November 2009 This includes a donation of €30 million to a government trust and €4 million donated to provide counselling services. Playing fields owned by the organisation and valued at €127 million would be transferred to joint ownership of the government and the trust that runs former Christian Brothers schools. =United States= In 1998, a member of the Congregation of Christian Brothers was arrested for indecent solicitation of a minor. Robert Brouillette was convicted in March 2000 of 10 charges related to child pornography. In 2011, the North American chapter of the Congregation of Christian Brothers filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy due to the financial burden caused by sex abuse lawsuits. The North American Province includes brothers in the United States and Canada. The majority of the claims were regarding the now-defunct Briscoe Memorial School, an orphanage and boarding school in Kent, Washington jointly run by the Archdiocese of Seattle and the Christian Brothers. In 2013, the North American chapter agreed to pay approximately $16.5 million in damages to more than 400 men and women who were sexually or physically abused as children by members of the order. Between 2006 and 2011, the order had already paid approximately 25.6 million to victims in 50 abuse cases. =United Kingdom= In December 2012, the Christian Brothers school St Ambrose College, Altrincham, Greater Manchester, was implicated in a child sex abuse case. A former lay teacher was convicted of nineteen counts of sexual assault occurring between 1972 and 1991.\\"Deacon Alan Morris jailed for school sex abuse\\", BBC News, 28 August 2014 In 2016, an ex-pupil of St Aidan's Christian Brothers school in Sunderland was paid £17,000 compensation after claiming two members of the Christian Brothers abused him at school in 1960s.  Scotland  In 2016, two former Christian Brothers were sent to prison for the both sexual and physical abuse. John Farrell the former Headmaster of St Ninian's Falkland received 5 years and Paul Kelly ten years.

Z. sociatus is currently being studied for its use against human lymphatic parasites. Taxonomy Zoanthus sociatus has nematocysts, which makes it a cnidarian. As it has polyp morphology, it is an anthozoan. It also has tentacles in multiples of 6, so it falls under the subclass Hexacorallia. It is in the order Zoanthidea due to its lack of a calcium carbonate skeleton. Forms elaborate piecemeal mats of normally green to turquoise polyps. They are often found on reef flats exposed to high light intensity and intermittently strong currents. Stolon-connected polyps normally have 30 short tentacles, polyps are extended continuously day and night and feed predominantly on detritus, not zooplankton. Habitat Z. Sociatus can be found in the lower intertidal and upper subtidal zones on protected Caribbean reefs. It is a sessile, colonial organism. Z. sociatus grows in the reef understory and on disturbed substrate. Z. sociatus can survive desiccation (an excessive loss of moisture) and lower levels of salinity. It appears to dominate other zoanthids. Reproduction Reproduction in Z. sociatus is mainly asexual although sexual reproduction may happen as well. There is extratentacular budding, which is the creation of a new polyp from an old polyp, and fission, a new fragment in formed. The size of a fragment is also controlled by the increasing rate of mortality with decreasing fragment size. A colony is generally genetically the same. Even when a colony is sexually reproductive, a large proportion of polyps remain infertile, which demonstrates the greater importance of asexual reproduction and growth. Z. sociatus colonies do not become reproductive until they reach a certain size. They use external fertilization, and are mostly hermaphroditic, although some are male or protogynous (female and then male). Z. sociatus was found to reproduce seasonally in Panama, and synchronizes the release of gametes with extremely low tides. Diet Z. sociatus polyps obtain nearly half of their required energy from the zooxanthellae, organism that Z. Sociatus forms symbiosis with. Therefore, the rest of the energy must be obtained through feeding. Zoanthids have nematocysts on their mesenterial filaments that are used for prey capture. Z. sociatus will eat mostly anything that is the right size such as from Artemia cysts and dissolved organic matter. While zoanthids are less efficient heterotrophs, they produce more energy photosynthetically due to their lack of a calcified skeleton. The lack of a skeleton allows more light to reach the chloroplasts. To digest prey, it uses both extracellular and intracellular methods.

For other persons named John Hoar / John Hore / John Hoare, see this disambiguation page. Title page of A True History of the Captivity and Restoration of Mrs. Mary Rowlandson, First edition London 1682. John Hoar (1622 – April 2, 1704) was a militia leader & Indian liaison in colonial Massachusetts during King Philip's War. He is best known for securing the release of Mary Rowlandson from Indian captivity at Redemption Rock. The event was depicted in the best selling book The Sovereignty and Goodness of God: Being a Narrative of the Captivity and Restoration of Mrs. Mary Rowlandson. Ransom of Mary Rowlandson On Feb. 10, 1676, during an Indian attack on her hometown of Lancaster, Massachusetts Mary Rowlandson, wife of the village minister Joseph Rowlandson, was taken prisoner with three of her children by a band of Nipmuc warriors. Hoar, a prominent lawyer and Indian missionary, was requested by the Rev. Rowlandson to act as the colonial representative in the negotiation for her release. Hoar departed Lancaster on April 28, 1676 with two native guides, Nepphonet and Peter Tatatiquinea to meet King Philip's War party at Wachusett Lake, located in what is now Princeton, Massachusetts. On May 2, after eleven weeks in captivity, Rowlandson was released to Hoar for a £20 ransom at the glacial stone outcropping known today as Redemption Rock. Rowlandson would go on to write a famous narrative of her experience as a captive, The Sovereignty and Goodness of God: Being a Narrative of the Captivity and Restoration of Mrs. Mary Rowlandson which became a bestseller throughout the English speaking world. It is considered to be a seminal work in the American literary genre of captivity narratives and also ranks as the first published book written by a colonial American woman. Life and Family John Hoar was born in 1622 in Gloucester, Gloucestershire, England. He died on 2 Apr 1704 in Concord, Middlesex Co., Massachusetts. There is no recorded date for his birth. He is mentioned in his grandfather's will of 1632 and there is a record of apprenticeship to his father dated the next year which indicates that he was eleven years old at that time and thus born in 1622. It is estimated that his widowed mother emigrated to Massachusetts about 1641 and soon settled in Scituate, Mass. The first evidence of John's settlement in Scituate is a list of men of the town bearing arms dated 1643. In 1659, he moved to Concord, where he later tried to give shelter to John Eliot's Praying Indians during King Philip's War. However, his neighbors prevented this and took the Indians to Deer Island where they perished. Because of his good relations with the Indians, he was asked to rescue Mrs. Rowlandson and her children. He was known to have a wife named, Alice, but there is no record of her last name or the date of their marriage. It has been incorrectly stated that he married an Alice Lisle, a daughter of Lord Lisle. However, it was his brother, Leonard, a graduate of Oxford University and later president of Harvard College, who had married Bridget, daughter of John Lord Lisle, President of the High Court of Justice for the trial of Charles I. Bridget's mother was Dame Alicia Lisle, a victim of Royalist justice, who was beheaded after being tried by Judge Jeffreys in 1685 . John and Leonard Hoar's sister, Joanna, married Edmund Quincy of Braintree. One of their descendants, Abigail Smith, married John Adams of the American Revolution.The Hoar Family in America and its English Ancestry: a Compilation from collections made by the Hon.

Their children were Mary, Elizabeth, Joanna, and Daniel. , January 10, 2011 Note that the only reference to Alice as a child of Lord Lisle is from the late 1800s, and there is no reference to Alice's surname in records contemporary to her life.

It was later included in the collection Switch Bitch, published in 1974 by Michael Joseph Ltd. Synopsis Middle-aged New York widow Anna Cooper has been contemplating suicide after losing her beloved husband Ed in a car accident, but begins to feel life may be worth living again after helping out in a friend's adoption agency. While visiting Dallas, Texas alone on agency business, Anna starts to feel uneasy and vulnerable. She remembers that an old flame, Dr. Conrad Kreuger, lives in Dallas, and telephones him from her hotel. Anna and Conrad had been high school sweethearts, but Anna had left Conrad to marry Ed, and Conrad had married another woman soon afterwards. Conrad seems pleased to hear from Anna, and suggests they meet in her hotel's bar for a drink. When he arrives, Anna learns that Conrad is a gynecologist and is now divorced. While he appears sympathetic when Anna describes her emotional fragility, he reveals he still feels bitter about the way she had jilted him. Nevertheless, Conrad suggests that he and Anna might have \\"a bit of unfinished business.\\" Anna has drunk several martinis, and lets Conrad take her to her hotel room. They prepare to make love, but Conrad suddenly becomes aggressive, pinning Anna down on the bed and \\"diagnosing\\" her as having menopausal symptoms. When Anna begins screaming, Conrad pushes her to the floor, and she staggers, sobbing, to the bathroom, shutting the door behind her. When Conrad – who has evidently planned revenge on Anna for breaking up with him – hears her open the bathroom cabinet, he quickly dresses and leaves the room. (The implication is that Anna will commit suicide by cutting her wrists with a razor blade.) Reception Dahl's biographer, Jeremy Treglown, states that \\"The Last Act\\" is a story that Dahl \\"would have done better to have scrapped... While the fiction is far from drawing readers into admiring Conrad, and its sympathies remain painfully with Anna, it has no purpose as a mechanism other than to lead to a crudely sensationalist conclusion.\\" Philosophy professor Bert Olivier analysed the story in some depth in his book Philosophy and Communication.
