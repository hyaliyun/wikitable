It was a high point for the art of the book and architecture; and also including ceramics, metal, glass, and gardens. The arts of the Safavid period show a far more unitary development than in any other period of Iranian art. The Safavid Empire was one of the most significant ruling dynasties of Iran. They ruled one of the greatest Persian empires, with artistic accomplishments, since the Muslim conquest of Persia.Helen Chapin Metz. Iran, a Country study. 1989.

Historical context Ismail, the founder of the Safavid dynasty Map of the Safavid empire The Safavid dynasty had its roots in a brotherhood called Safaviyeh which appeared in Azerbaijan around 1301, with Sheikh Safi-ad-din Ardabili who gave it his name. The Safavids have greatly contributed to the spread of the Twelvers branch of Shia Islam, those who consider the twelfth imam hidden like his leader. It was however not until 1447 that the Safavid dynasty began to show its political ambitions, with the seizing of power by Sheikh Djunayd. A system of battles and alliances with the Turkmen tribes began, leading to the extinction of the dynasty of the Kara Koyunlu who reigned up to that time over the region of Tabriz, across from those of the Ak Koyunlu installed in Anatolia. Haydari, the successor of Djunayd, was quickly killed, and Shah Ismail, then 12 years of age, took his place as leader of the movement in 1499. A vigorous propaganda was soon put in place, allowing an army to be recruited. In 1500, his 7000 soldiers defied the Turmken troops, 30,000 men strong, and in 1501, Shah Ismail entered Tabriz in the north-west of Iran, proclaimed the rite of imamism (Twelvers) to be the religion of state and had the first coins struck in his name. The territorial expansion accelerated towards Baghdad, deeper into the Caucasus and the Ottoman empire, but the arrival of Selim I at the head of the Ottoman empire, which forbade the Shia religion, and the battle of Chaldiran (August 22, 1514), marked a stopping point. The Safavid army, unfamiliar with firearms,Article ¬´ √áaldiran ¬ª, Michael J. McCaffrey, Encyclop√¶dia Iranica suffered a painful defeat. Selim I entered Tabriz‚Äîfrom which he withdrew several months later because of internal quarrels‚Äîand annexed a large part of the Safavid territory. Shah Ismail, whose divine ascendance had been definitely set aside, withdrew from political life, while relations with the Qizilbash Turkmen deteriorated. The settlement of the Portuguese at the Strait of Hormuz sparked a flourishing commerce with Europe. After the death of Shah Ismail, his 10-year-old son Shah Tahmasp came into power. In 1534, Suleiman invaded Iran with a force numbering 200,000 men and 300 pieces of artillery. Tahmasp could only field 7,000 men (of dubious loyalty) and a few cannons. The Ottomans seized the Safavid capital Tabriz, and captured Baghdad. Tahmasp avoided direct confrontation with the Ottoman army, preferring to harass it then retreat, leaving scorched earth behind him. This scorched earth policy led to the loss of 30,000 Ottoman troops as they made their way through the Zagros mountains and Suleiman decided to abandon his campaign.Nahavandi and Bomati p. 283 A bridge from the Safavid period, near Qazvin. Twelve years of confusion followed the death of Tahmasp in 1576, and it was not until the arrival of Shah Abbas the Great that calm was restored. He quickly signed an unfavourable peace with the Ottomans, to give himself time to establish an army of ghulams. These fully loyal converted slave soldiers of ethnic Circassian, Georgian and Armenian origin had been deported to Persia en masse since the time of Tahmasp I. Trained with the best training and equipped with the best weapons, these soldiers would replace the Qizilbash from virtually all their positions in the royal household, the civil administration and the army, and be fully loyal to the Shah.Article ¬´ Abbas I ¬ª, R. M. Savory, Encyclopaedia Iranica These measures, including the heavy European reforms of the army, thanks to the British brothers Shirley, allowed the Shah to easily defeat the Uzbeks and to retake Herat in 1598, then Baghdad in 1624, and the whole Caucasus, and beyond. This reign, the highlight of the dynasty, supported flourishing commerce and art, notably with the construction of the new capital of Isfahan. The period after the death of Shah Abbas was a long decline, partly due to the harem system, which encouraged intrigue and manipulation, often by the same new Caucasian layers in the Persian society. The reign of Shah Safi (reigned 1629‚Äì1642) was notable for its arbitrary violence and territorial retreats; that of Shah Abbas II marked the beginning of religious intolerance towards the Dhimmis and particularly the Jews,Article ¬´ Abbas II ¬ª, R. M. Savory, Encyclop√¶dia Iranica a situation which continued under Shah Suleiman and Shah Husayn. Disintegrated by feuds, civil strife, and foreign interference of most notably the Russians, Dutch, and Portuguese, a rebellion of Afghans would be enough in 1709 to lead the dynasty eventually to a fall in 1722. Architecture and urbanism * =Under Shah Ismail= Shaykh Safi of Ardabil and a part of the complex associated with him While the first Safavid Shah followed a rather intensive policy of restoration and conservation of the great Shiah places, such as Karbala (1508), Najaf (1508) and Samarra in Iraq and Mashhad in the east of Iran, etc., thus perpetuating the Timurid traditions, on the other hand his participation in architectural construction was almost nonexistent, no doubt because the Safavid conquest was carried out without major destruction. Thus, at Tabriz, the new capital, all the surviving Ilkhanid, Jalayirid, Aq Qoyunlu and Timurid monuments largely satisfied the needs of the Shah and his administration. It was nevertheless Ismail who made the city of Ardabil (northern Iran) into a dynastic centre and place of pilgrimage, embellishing the complex surrounding the tomb of Shaykh Safi and interring there the remains of his father in 1509. He is responsible in particular for the construction of Dar al-Hadith, a hall dedicated to the study of the Hadiths, similar to the old Dar al-Huffaz, which served for reciting the Quran.Researchers are divided about the attribution of Dar al-Hadith to Shah Ismail, but Sussan Babai notes the mention, in 1570, of an inscription with the titles of Shah Ismail on the facade. S. Babaie, ‚ÄúBuilding on the past: the shaping of Safavid architecture, 1501‚Äì1576‚Äù, in Hunt for paradise‚Ä¶, p. 32. It was no doubt also he himself who designed his own tomb, even though it was created shortly after his death. One can also credit Ismail with the restoration of the Masjed-e Jameh de Saveh, in 1520, of which the exterior decoration has disappeared, but of which the mihrab combines a use of ancient stucco and a delicate decor of arabesques in ceramic mosaic. Another mosque of Saveh, the Masjed-e meydan, received a similar mihrab, dated by inscriptions to between 1510 and 1518. Dormish Khan Shamlu, brother-in-law of Ismail, partially compensated for this lack of construction beginning in 1503. This governor of Isfahan, who lived more often at the court of Tabriz than in his city, left the reins to Mirza Shah Hussein Isfahani, the greatest architect of the period, who built there in particular the tomb of Harun-e Vilayat in 1512-1513.Dating of the tomb is possible due to an inscription. Described by a western traveller as a great place of \\"Persian pilgrimage\\" (as much for Muslims as for Jews and Christians), this monument is composed of a square chamber under a cupola, a completely traditional design. The cupola rests on a high drum, the muqarnas filling the octagonal passageway. Two minarets, now gone, magnified the great porch, while the decor of hazerbaf and the ceramic mosaic, concentrated on the facade, stayed in the Timurid tradition. The facade, punctuated by blind arches, is thus unified by basic decor, as was already the case at the mosque of Yazd. One must add to this tomb the nearby mosque masjed-e Ali, completed in 1522 under the order of the same commander. =Under Shah Tahmasp= Like his predecessor, Shah Tahmasp, at the beginning of his reign (1524‚Äì1555) stayed rather inactive in architectural matters, contenting himself with restorations and embellishments, always along the lines of the dynasties which preceded him. In particular, the great mosques of Kerman, Shiraz and Isfahan, and the sanctuaries of Mashhad and Ardabil benefited from his attention. In the latter place, one can cite the funeral tower of Shah Ismail, possibly ordered by this one, but which was undoubtedly created during the first years of the reign of Shah Tahmasp, even though no date is mentioned. It is situated right next to the funeral tower of the founder of the dynasty and, because of this proximity, has a restrained diameter. It looks therefore a little diminished by its neighbouring monument. Tall in measurement, it contains three small superposed cupolas, and flaunts a ceramic decor divided into numerous registers to avoid monotony. The yellow colour of the decorative ceramic is, however, a totally new element. Also at Ardabil is attributed to Shah Tahmasp the Jannat Sara, an octagonal building with accessories and gardens much degraded in the 18th century (and greatly restored). Situated at the north-east of the tomb, it dates, according to Morton, to the years 1536‚Äì1540.A. H. Morton, ¬´ The Ardabil Shrine in the Reign of Shah Tahmasp I ¬ª, Iran 12, 1974, pp. 31-64, 13, 1975, pp. 39‚Äì58. Its main use is still debated, because it's mentioned as a mosque in European sources, but not in Persian ones, which raises certain questions. Was it planned to place here the tomb of Shah Tahmasp, actually interred at Mashhad? From this place come the famous carpets of Ardabil (see below). Also credited to Shah Ismail is a palace at Tabriz, his capital until 1555, of which nothing survives except a description by the Italian traveller Michele Membre, who visited Tabriz in 1539. According to him, it was composed of a garden surrounded by walls of stone and earth with two gates of a great meydan at the east, and of a new mosque. At the end of his reign, Tahmasp organized the gardens of Sadatabad. This, like all Persian gardens, is divided in four by two perpendicular alleys and bordered by a canal, an arrangement found particularly in the tapis-jardins (literally carpet gardens) of the same period. It contains baths, four covered walkways and three pleasure pavilions: the Gombad-e Muhabbat, the Iwan-e Bagh and the Chehel Sutun. The name of the latter, built in 1556, means \\"palace of forty columns\\", a name which is explained by the presence of twenty columns reflected in a pond. In the Persian tradition, the number forty is often used to mean a large quantity. This little construction at one point served as a place of audience, for banquets and for more private uses. It was decorated with panels painted with literary Persian scenes, such as the story of Farhad and Shirin, as well as hunting scenes, festivals and polo, etc. Floral bands surrounded these panels, based on models of Shah Tahmasp himself, to paint at his hours, or again of Muzaffar Ali or Muhammadi, thus used in the royal library. In the city of Nain, the house of the governor, designed with four iwans, presents a d√©cor undoubtedly elaborated between 1565 and 1575,Sheila Canby, The Golden age of Persian art, British Museum Press, 2002, 192 p., using a rare and very sophisticated technique: over a coat of red paint, the artist placed a white coating, and then scratched to allow motifs to appear in red silhouette‚Äîmotifs reminiscent of those in books and on cloth. One finds there animal fights, throned princes, literary scenes (Khosrow and Shirin, Yusuf and Zuleykha), a game of polo, hunting scenes etc. One notices that the silhouettes curve and that the taj, the headdress characteristic of the Safavids at the beginning of the empire had disappeared, following the fashion of the time. Among the scroll patterns are calligraphic representations of the quatrains of the poet Hafiz. =Under Shah Abbas= The reign of Shah Abbas marked the explosion of Safavid architecture, with the construction of a new Isfahan. Isfahan Sketch of the meydan by G. Hofsted van Essen, 1703, library of Leiden University. For the third time in the history of the Safavids, the capital of the empire changed under Shah Abbas: to Isfahan, a city in a more centralized location than Tabriz or Qazvin (which is between Tehran and Tabriz). A new capital was thus set up beside the ancient city, organized around a meydan, a large place 512 metres long by 159 wide. On one side stands the Shah's mosque, on the other the Shah's oratory, called the mosque of Sheikh Lutfallah, while the pavilion Ali Qapu opens onto a large pleasure walkway (Chahar Bagh) and the grand bazaar led to the old mosque on Fridays. Two bridges cross the Zayandeh River, leading to an Armenian section taking the name of Nea Julfa. = Ali Qapu= Ali Qapu and arcades of the meydƒÅn, Isfahan, beginning of 17th century Safavid Tile Panel \\"Garden Gathering\\" Stone Paste; painted and polychrome glazed (cuerda seca technique) A rather tall building, opening on one side onto the meydan and on the other onto the Chahar Bagh, the Ali Qapu pavilion was no doubt built in two stages, according to Galieri, who long studied it. One finds there traits characteristic of Iranian architecture, such as the taste for proportions in two levels: one level, the portico of the upper part (talar), or again the cruciform plan. The d√©cor is often reminiscent of the contemporary book art, with Chinese clouds, birds in flight, and flowering trees portrayed in soft colours. The upper rooms, called music rooms, present a d√©cor of little alcoves the shape of long-necked bottles. = The Qaysarieh, or grand bazaar = Entrance to the Qaysarieh The grand bazaar is connected to the old market on one side and to the meydan on the other. On the side opening onto the meydan, its high vault with protruding ribs encloses a multi-story structure, of which the upper part was reserved for the Shah's orchestra while in the lower part were found shops and homes, organized by occupation. Ceramic mosaic decoration is evidence that the Shah had as much interest in architecture for civil purposes as for those of religion or pleasure. = The mosque of Sheikh Lutfallah, or the oratory of the Shah = Sheikh Lotfollah Mosque, Isfahan, interior This mosque was the first to be constructed in the new Isfahan, before the grand mosque of the Shah. Its construction stretched over sixteen long years, but two dates (1616 on the dome and 1618 in the mihrab) tend to show that it was completed around 1618. The architect was Muhammad Riza ibn Husayn, and the calligrapher possibly Reza Abbasi, a great Persian painter and calligrapher. The plan of this mosque is rather unusual, with a winding, intentionally dim entrance which leads to a prayer room completely covered by a dome and open to a grand portal. The absence of a court is notable. The d√©cor consists of yellow marble, with niches arranged in the sides with rich stalactites, and an outer layer of ceramic. The colouring of the exterior dome is quite unique, dominated by the colour of the earth. =The Shah Mosque= Shah Mosque The Shah Mosque was built between 1612 and 1630 under the direction of the architects Muhibb al-Din Ali Kula and Ustad Ali Akbar Isfahani. Its dimensions are colossal: 140 metres by 130, equalling a surface area of 18,000 square metres, about the size of three football fields. The plan is however much more orthodox than that of the mosque of Sheikh Luffallah: the mosque is rigorously symmetric, with four iwans and two cupolas, the minarets rising in front of the prayer room. In one part and another of the building are two Madrasahs. The plan of the building, like its d√©cor, demonstrates a grand coherence. The veneer of ceramic covers all the surface of the walls, but the back of the iwans is often neglected in favour of the fa√ßade. The dominant colour is blue, almost giving the impression of a blue mantle, and gives a sense of unity to the ensemble. Comparisons to the art of the book can be made. =The Allaverdikhan bridge= The Allaverdikhan bridge at night. Datable to 1608, this bridge was constructed by the order of Allahverdi Khan, the Georgian minister of Shah Abbas.Savory, R.M., \\"Allaverdi Khan\\". Encyclop√¶dia Iranica. Accessed October 18, 2006. It is contained in the continuity of Chahar Bagn.Savory, Roger M., \\"Article ChƒÅhƒÅr BƒÅgh\\". Encyclop√¶dia Iranica. With its arcades, in the sides and in the base, it also offers the possibility of strolling on several levels, according to the height of the water. It serves, of course, as a means of passage, but also as a dam, to regulate the flow of the river. As one crosses it, the water seems like a grand fountain, thanks to the \\"emmarchements\\". At the side is a talar, the kiosk of mirrors, from which the sovereign could observe the river. =See also= * Shah Abbas Mosque, Yerevan * Shah Abbas Mosque, Ganja =Under Shah Abbas II= The Chehel Sotoun  The Chehel Sotoun, 1647‚Äì48?, Isfahan This building, of which the date is much disputed, was no doubt constructed under the reign of Shah Abbas II, then redecorated in the years 1870. According to a poem inscribed on the building and another by Muhammad Ali Sahib Tabrizi, it would have been created in 1647‚Äì48, and if some researchers believe that this building was constructed in several stages, the majority are inclined to think that it was built all at once, because it is quite coherent. It's a rectangular building, sporting columns which reflect in the ponds (chehel sotoun meaning \\"forty columns\\" in Persian). Fresco from the Chehel Sutun: Shah Abbas II and his court The Chehel Sotoun is decorated with grand historic paintings, exalting the magnanimity or the courage in battle of various grand sovereigns of the dynasty: a battle scene with Shah Ismail; the Mughal sultan Humayun is received by Shah Tahmasp, then Vali Nadr Muhammad Khan, sovereign of Bukhara between 1605 and 1608, by Shah Abbas I, and finally, one finds an evocation of the taking of Kandahar by Shah Abbas II, which must have been added later, the city not having fallen until 1649. In the secondary rooms, too, are found numerous gallant scenes and figures on foot. One notes Western influences in the d√©cor (the opening onto a landscape; similarities with the Armenian neighbourhood) and Indian influences (a horse represented tinted in henna; iwans covered with mirrors.) Khaju Bridge The second large[st] bridge of Isfahan, built 50 years after the Pol-e Allahverdikhan, the Khaju bridge presents a structure which is similar but slightly more complex, with [brise- flots] in a fan-shaped pattern, allowing for more spectacular water effects. =The end of the period = Ceiling of Hasht Behesht, Isfahan One can still evoke two buildings of Isfahan, dating from the late Safavid period. The Hasht Behesht (the \\"eight paradises\\") is composed of a pavilion with eight little entities distributed around a large room under a cupola with four iwans. Small vaults crown the secondary rooms, decorated with mirrors which make the surfaces appear to be moving. The exterior decor, in ceramic, is remarkable for its extensive use of yellow. This building is dated to the years 1671. Door in the madreseh MƒÅdar-e Shah, Isfahan The madreseh Madar-e Shah, or madreseh of the mother of the Shah, is on the Chahar Bagh and is dated 1706-1714. It carries no architectural innovation, and therefore evokes the stagnation of architecture of this period: a plan of four iwans and a dome reminiscent of the mosque of the Shah form the major part of its architectural elements. The decor, highly geometric, is on the other hand a little different from that of the 17th century, with a palette dominated by yellow, green and gold, and a denser network of vegetation than that in the Shah's mosque. Art =Ceramic= Under Shah Ismail and Shah Tahmasp Plate decorated with two pomegranates, v. 1500, the Louvre The study and dating of ceramics under Shah Ismail and Shah Tahmasp is difficult because there are few pieces which are dated or which mention the place of production. It is also known that the most powerful personages preferred Chinese porcelain by far over locally produced ceramics. Many locations of workshops have, however, been identified, although not with certainty: *Nishapur *Kubachi (for architectural ceramic) *Kerman (moulded monochromatic pieces) *Mashhad *Yazd (based on a cistern at the British Museum) *Shiraz (cited by Chardin) *Bordabas *Gambrun *Nain The first five are more certain than the last four, having been cited in the sources, but no one is absolutely certain. In general, the decors tend to imitate those of Chinese porcelain, with the production of blue and white pieces with Chinese form and motifs (curved marly, chi clouds, dragons etc.) In any case, the Persian blue is distinguished from the Chinese blue by its more numerous and subtle nuances. Often, quatrains by Persian poets, sometimes related to the destination of the piece (allusion to wine for a goblet, for example) occur in the scroll patterns. One can also notice a completely different type of decor, much more rare, which carries iconography very specific to Islam (Islamic zodiac, bud scales, arabesques) and seems influenced by the Ottoman world, as is evidenced by feather-edged anthemions (honeysuckle ornaments) widely used in Turkey. Numerous types of pieces were produced: goblets, plates, long-necked bottles, spitoons, etc. Canteens can be noted with very small necks and bellies that are flat on one side and very rounded on the other: an example is found at Victoria and Albert Museum, another at Winter Palace. Between the reign of Shah Abbas and the end of the empire Plate decorated with dragon, 17th century, inspired from 15th-century Chinese blue and white ceramic, the Louvre Among the petrographic ceramics one can distinguish four groups, each linked to a method of production: *Lias *Mashhad *Tabriz (a centre which remains hypothetical, possibly with a workshop supported by royal beneficence) *an unidentified centre which produced blues and whites imitating wanli ceramic (kraak porcelain) With the closing of the Chinese market in 1659, Persian ceramic soared to new heights, to fulfill European needs. The appearance of false marks of Chinese workshops on the backs of some ceramics marked the taste that developed in Europe for far-eastern porcelain, satisfied in large part by Safavid production. This new destination led to wider use of Chinese and exotic iconography (elephants) and the introduction of new forms, sometimes astonishing (hookahs, octagonal plates, animal-shaped objects). During the same time period, new figures appeared, influenced by the art of the book: young, elegant cupbearers, young women with curved silhouettes, or yet cypress trees entangling their branches, reminiscent of the paintings of Reza Abbasi. One notes the use of beautiful yellows, and of the technique of lustre still present in some pieces in the 17th and 18th centuries. An exceptional case: the ceramic of Kubacha Tile with young man. Earthenware, painted on slip and under transparent glaze. Northwestern Iran, Kubacha ware, 17th century. The discovery, on the walls of houses of Kubacha, of ceramics of a very homogeneous style rapidly led historians to believe that there existed a centre of production in the city. This interpretation was however contested by Arthur Lane and many others after him, and seems today to be erroneous. This series was produced over three centuries, in the course of which it evolved greatly, but always kept a hole in the bases for the hanging of the pieces. Schematically, one can distinguish three periods: *In the 15th century, two-coloured with green glaze and motifs painted in black. *In the 16th century, two-coloured with turquoise glaze and motifs still in black. *In the 18th century, multicoloured (cobalt, soft red [rouge terne], orangish- yellow), with influences from the art of the book and from Ottoman and Indian [art]. The Kubacha series remains very mysterious, and many centres of production have been proposed without any real resolution of the issue. =Metallic art= Pitcher (container)Pitcher. Bronze, Iran, 16th century. Mus√©e du Louvre Metallic art a gradual decline during the Safavid dynasty, and remains difficult to study, particularly because of the small number of dated pieces. Under Shah Ismail, one notes a perpetuation of the shapes and decorations of Timurid inlays: motifs of almond-shaped glories, of shamsa (suns) and of chi clouds are found on the inkwells in the form of mausoleums or the globular pitchers reminiscent Ulugh Beg' jade one. Under Shah Tahmasp, inlays disappeared rapidly, as witnessed by a group of candlesticks in the form of pillars. On the other hand, one notices the appearance of coloured paste (red, black, green) to replace the multicolouration previously supplied by the inlays of silver and gold. One notes also the beginning of steelwork, in particular by piercings, to actualize the elements of plating of doors and of standards. =Work in hard stone= We know of several hardstone carvings, most often datable to the 16th century. A series of pitchers with globular bellies also exists, mounted on a little ring-shaped base and having wide, short necks. Two of these (one in black jade inlaid with gold, the other in white jade) are inscribed with the name of Ismail I. The handle is in the shape of a dragon, which betrays a Chinese influence, but this type of pitcher comes in fact directly from the preceding period: its prototype is the pitcher of Ulough Beg. We also know of blades and handles of knives in jade, often inlaid with gold wire and engraved. Hardstone serves also to make jewels to inlay in metal objects, such as the great zinc bottle inlaid with gold, rubies and turquoise dated to the reign of Ismail and conserved at the museum of Topkapi in Istanbul. =Persian carpets= Detail from the \\"\\", depicting animal and hunting scenes. Northwestern Iran, 16th century. Warp and weft: wool; pile: wool; knot: asymmetrical. The carpet once covered the floor of the collegiate church of Mantes-la-Jolie (Yvelines, France), hence its name. (Louvre). Numerous carpets (between 1500 and 2000) have been conserved since the Safavid period, but the dating and establishment of the origin of these carpets remains very difficult. The inscriptions are a valuable indicator for determining the artists, the places of fabrication, the sponsors etc. In addition, once a carpet has been made and has stayed in a particular place, it allows other pieces related to it to be identified. It is generally accepted among specialists that it was the Safavids who transformed the carpet from production by artists assured by nomadic tribes to the status of a \\"national industry\\" of which the products were exported to India, into the Ottoman Empire and to Europe. During the Safavid period, the export of carpets flourished, to destinations in Europe (sometimes via the Portuguese colony of Goa) and to the Mughal Empire, where Persian carpets stimulated local production. Some Safavid carpets were also transported by the Dutch East India Company towards Jakarta, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Kochi, India as well as to the Netherlands. European orders came to the Persian Empire for the weaving of special carpets: for example, the group of \\"Polish carpets\\" was undoubtedly knotted in Isfahan, but certain ones carry the arms of Poland. Based on accounts by travellers and other written sources,Florencio, p. 102; Tavernier, I, p. 397,589 ; Chardin, III, p. 120. it appears that workshops for royal carpets existed in Ispahan, Kashan and Kerman. These workshops produced carpets for the palace and mosques of the Shah, but also to be offered to neighbouring monarchs or to foreign dignitaries, or pieces made on order for the nobility or ordinary citizens. Such sponsorship provided capital in the form of raw materials and provided a salary for the artisans for the duration of the weaving. The rapid development of the carpet industry in the Persian Empire during the Safavid period seems to be due to the sovereigns' taste for this art form. Ismail I, then Shah Tahmasp and Shah Abbas I are known for having been personally interested in carpet production. One has also supposed that the two latter sovereigns were personally invested in the production of carpets, notably by the design of the motifs.VƒÅrzi, p. 58. During their reigns, the production of Persian carpets was the most prominent out of the whole Safavid period. It was in this period and particularly since Shah Tahmasp that the first carpets with floral decoration were created, in order to satisfy the taste of the Safavids. The difference between the carpets of the nomads and the floral ones is due to the role of the \\"master\\" (ostad), who draws the pattern which will be reproduced by the knotters. The designs of the carpets of the nomads are themselves transmitted by tradition. The production of carpets was strongly influenced by the leadership of the art of the book, which provided the patterns. Thus, on comparing them with bookbindings and illuminations, specialists have been able to discern a stylistic evolution. Thus, the majority of the carpets produced during the 16th century, that is, principally under Shah Ismail and Shah Tahmasp, are called \\"with medallion\\" because they are organized around a large central multi-lobed medallion sometimes called Shamsa, that is \\"sun\\", and the corner decorations each carry a quarter of a medallion which is strongly reminiscent of that in the centre. The most famous carpets of this type are the pair of carpets said to be of Ard√©bil, of which one, conserved at the Victoria and Albert Museum, is dated 946 since the Hijra, that is 1539‚Äì40 A.D. and signed \\"Work of the humble servant of the court of Mahmud Hashani\\".S. Canby, The golden age of Persian art, p. 48. From the end of the 16th and the beginning of the 17th century, that is with the coming into power of Shah Abbas, the medallion tended to disappear, since the corner decorations could already have been eliminated by the second half of the 16th century, as is shown by the . It's the flowering of \\"vase carpets\\", which, as their name indicates, display a vase from which springs a floral arrangement. The garden, which is associated with paradise,The word is derived, in fact, from the Old Persian pairideieza, which means \\"garden\\", \\"enclosure\\", which gives pardis in Persian. equally gives place to a type of composition which appeared in the 17th century in Persia in imitation of the gardens of the Shah, divided in rectangular parcels or squares by alleys and irrigation canals (chahar bƒÅgh).Enza Milanesi, Le tapis, Gr√ºnd, 1999, There are also carpets with the theme of hunting, an activity prized by the Shahs and requiring address, strength, and knowledge of nature. This theme is also linked to paradise and to spiritual activities, because the hunt often unfolds in a wilderness which can be reminiscent of the gardens of paradise. One of the finest is undoubtedly the apparently tabrizi carpet, currently conserved at the Museo Poldi Pezzoli, and dated 1542‚Äì43. The Mantes carpet, dated to the second half of the 16th century and conserved at the Louvre, is equally of this exemplary calibre. The village of Kashan for its part was distinguished by a very particular production of relatively small carpets entirely of silk, with a blue or red base, showing fights between fantastic animals borrowed from the Chinese (kilins, dragons, phoenixes). As with the large carpets, those of the 16th century display a medallion (carpet of the Gulbenkian Foundation), which disappeared in the following century. The Louvre and the Metropolitan Museum are each freely conserving an example.The carpet of the Metropolitan Museum .  The art of the book  Under the Safavids, the art of the book, especially the Persian miniature painting, constituted the essential driving force of the arts. The ketab khaneh, the royal library-workshop, provided most of the sources of motifs for objects such as carpets, ceramics or metal. Various types of books were copied, illuminated, bound and sometimes illustrated: religious books ‚Äì Korans, but also commentaries on the sacred text and theological works‚Äîand books of Persian literature ‚Äì Shahnameh, Nizami's Khamsa, Jami al-Tawarikh by Rashid- al-Din Hamadani, Timur nƒÅmeh‚Äîencyclopedias and scientific treatises of Sufism. Paper, a Chinese invention arriving early in Iran (13th century), was always used. One notes the frequent use of coloured papers. Towards 1540, a marbled paper also appeared, which however rapidly disappeared again. The bindings were mostly accomplished with tinted maroquin of very fine quality. They could be gilded and stamped with geometric, floral or figurative motifs, or embossed in blue. In the second half of the 16th century, they pierced the leather covers to allow the coloured paper or silk pages to be seen. In the same period, at Shiraz, appeared lacquered bindings, which remain however very rare and highly valued in Iran. The decoration of the margins was realised in various ways: sometimes they were inserted in a different paper, (a tradition that appeared in the 15th century); sprinkled with gold, following a Chinese custom; or painted with colours or gold. The style of illustrations varied greatly from one manuscript to another, according to the period and centre of production. =1501‚Äì1550: Heritage= Three centres were active in this period: *Tabriz *Shiraz *Bukhara Tabriz, capital of the Safavid empire from 1501 to 1548, again also used artists of the Ak Koyunlu ketab khaneh. The illustrations show a double heritage: that of the Ak Koyunlu and that of the Timurid dynasty. The latter benefitted from the taking of Herat in 1501, but did not really manifest itself until the year 1525. The various directors of the ketab khaneh are: *Sultan Muhammad (1515‚Äì1522) *Bihzad (1522‚Äì1540) *Mir Musavvir Uzbek (Safavid Iran, mid 16th century) Many great painters, such as Aqa Mirak, Mir Sayyid Ali or Dust Muhammad worked in the book-workshop, and produced great royal manuscripts. The first of which we have some trace is the unfinished Shah Nameh commissioned by Ismail for his son Tahmasp, for whom alone four paintings were created including Raksh defends a sleeping Rustam. This last is undoubtedly one of the most famous pieces of Safavid painting, which shows the strong prominence of Turkmen art in the treatment of very dense vegetation, like a carpet, and in the messing up of perspective. It is thought that it was when Shah Tahmasp returned to Tabriz in 1522 that work on this painting stopped in 1522, when, moulded by the influence of his masters BehzƒÅd and Sultan Muhammad, he got work started on his great Shah Nameh. He also commissioned other exceptional works, including a Hamsa and a Iskandar Nameh. Other patrons employed artists of the royal ketab khaneh: prince Braham Mirza (1517‚Äì1549) had an album (muhaqqa) made for him by the painter Dust Muhammad. The art of calligraphy was at that time dominated by a very prominent man, named \\"Zarrin Qalam\\", which means \\"golden reed pen\\", who excelled in the six canonical calligraphies. The royal workshops of Tabriz were very influential, and the non-royal manuscripts, illuminated and illustrated, spread throughout the whole empire, distinguishing the provincial centres such as that of Shiraz. Shiraz is the capital of Fars Province and a very active provincial centre of the south of Iran. The artists were always the same as those employed by the Ak Koyunlu, and produced volumes in small formats, copies of the Qur'an and of grand poetic texts, destined for the most part for commerce with the Ottoman Empire (Syria, Egypt). In spite of the blockade imposed by this empire in 1512, the production did not weaken, which suggests that it turned towards other poorly-identified buyers, given the absence of local patronage. Under the influence of Tabriz, one notes the evolutions between 1501 and 1525: the silhouettes became slimmer; the taj, the characteristic Qizilbash headgear, started to appear, with a red baton and twelve folds corresponding to the twelve imams of the Twelver Shi\`ism. From 1525 forward, the workshops of Shiraz produced nothing but copies of the works of the royal workshops of Tabriz, then of Qazvin and Isfahan. Bukhara was not properly speaking a Safavid centre, given that the city was at the centre of an independent state led by the Uzbek dynasty Shaybanid from 1500 to 1598. But the nomadism of the artists, due to frequent political changes and to the nomadism of the sovereigns, implicated notable influence on the part of the Safavid centres. The manuscripts of this school are characterized by their margins richly decorated with the technique of encartage. Their bindings had a counter-plate with a large decoration of perforated leather and a plate with large rectangular plaques with animal motifs or arabesques, according to the ancient Timurid tradition. The painting used a harmonious palette, with airy compositions, but an absence of new models and the repetition of poncifs (pointillism?) creates a certain aridity. The school of Bukhara reached its peak between 1530 and 1550, and directly influenced Mughal art. =1550‚Äì1600: Transition period = The years 1550‚Äì1600 were marked by numerous changes in the organization of the empire and therefore in the production of books among the Safavids. With the transfer of capital in 1548, the royal workshop moved, and it was Quazvin which took over the royal production. In any case, the provincial centres such as that of Shiraz (in the south) or Khorasan (in the east of Iran) continued to produce manuscripts, more or less rich. With the transfer of the capital from Tabriz to Qazvin in 1548, the khetab khaneh was in large part dismantled, following edicts of repentance published by the Shah for religious and economic reasons. The artists fled to provincial or foreign courts (Mughal or Ottoman). Only Aqa Mirak resisted this series of departures. Other artists, such as Siavush Beg the Georgian or Sadiqi Beg took the place of the preceding generation. New grand calligraphers, Mir Ali ou Malik Dayalami appeared and gave birth to the \\"rule of the two quills\\", which defined identical rules for calligraphy and painting. Illumination and bookbinding evolved in parallel from the art of tapestry, given that the templates used were identical. In manuscripts, most often the paintings were double pages with no connection with the text, but images of servers of drinks, young women, princes, and dervishes filled the albums (muhaqqa). 'Ali\\", Folio from a Falnama (The Book of Omens) of Ja'far al-Sadiq.alt= If the end of the reign of Shah Tahmasp was not very fruitful, (we know, however, of a FƒÅl NƒÅmeh dating from these years with the signatures of Aqa Mirak et Abd al-Aziz), Shah Ismail II (1576-77) exercised a beneficial influence, ordering a grand Shah NƒÅmeh and an AjayibnƒÅmeh (book of wonders). Unfortunately, his short reign prevented a real renaissance, even if it did establish new foundations, marking the beginning of the proliferation of pages of albums. His successor, Shah Mohammed Khodabanda, being blind, took little interest in books, ending the restart which had been set in motion. The renewal of the art of the royal book would only take place partially under Saha Abbas I the Grand, who ordered, as, it seemed, was the custom, a grand Shah NƒÅmeh on transferring the court to Isfahan. The provincial workshop of Shiraz continued to flourish until 1620, but continued most often to recopy the models issued by the royal workshops of Tabriz, then of Qazvin and Khorasan. The ornamentation was bountiful, illustration was abundant in manuscripts and the colours were vibrant, although without much variation. The drawings represented people with round faces and long noses. The illumination remained very repetitive, and the calligraphy, most often nastaliq, was copied from one to another. Most of the manuscripts were not signed. The workshops said to be of Khorasan were situated in Herat in the district of Bakharz. Under the patronage of the brother of Braham Mirza, Ibrahim Mirza, they revitalized the school of Qazvin, employing artists such as Shaykh Muhammad, Muzaffar Ali or Muhammadi, specialized in drawings. The most famous manuscript that came out of these workshops is a copy of the Haft Awrang (Seven Thrones) of Jami, and is marked by the profound originality of the creations of the official workshops. =1600‚Äì1660: The decline of illuminated manuscripts and the development of a specific genre: the album page= During the reigns of Shah Abbas I and Shah Safi, the number of illuminated and illustrated manuscripts dropped considerably, leaving room for a new form of manuscript: the album page. The albums, or muhaqqa, were created most often under the direction of a painter or calligrapher. They grouped together drawings, calligraphy and also ancient miniatures. Reza Abbasi, who directed the kitab khaneh between 1597 and 1635, (having been transferred, in 1602, to Isfahan), is undoubtedly the greatest representative of this genre. The people illustrated on these album pages are most often elongated silhouettes, with little rounded heads. The subjects could be courtesans, servers of drinks being prominent, but also peasants and dervishes. Although Reza resisted European influence, right up to his death in 1635, other artists did not hesitate to draw inspiration from, or to copy, the engravings brought by merchants from the Netherlands. Other great painters of albums from this period were Safi Abassi, son of Reza, known for his paintings of birds, and Mo‚Äôin Musavvir, Muhammad Qasim and Muhammad Ali, his disciples. This taste for the album did not entirely put a permanent end to manuscripts of paintings. The Shah NƒÅmeh for Shah Abbas, the two Divan of Navai or again the manuscript of Khosrow and Shirin (1632, Victoria and Albert Museum) are examples of the perpetuation of this tradition, which the provincial workshops abandoned less readily than the royal ketab khaneh. The school of Herst, notably, still regularly produces copies of great illustrated Persian texts. =1660‚Äì1722: The end of illustrated manuscripts= With the emergence of Ali Qoli Djebbeh Dar and Muhammad Zaman, two very Europeanistic painters, the role of the illustrated book in the art of the book declined still further. A great activity of calligraphy and illumination was put into practice, with a true regrowth of interest for the former and an abundant style, very fine and rich in plant elements for the second. Conclusion The Safavids were the last sovereigns to promote a Persian national art. Thanks to them, in present-day Iran a new art is taking flight, particularly notable in urbanism: Ali Qapu, Chehel Sutun have their treasure-troves in verdant parks laid out according to precise perspectives, such as the monumental boulevard of Tchehar Bagh (or avenue of the four gardens) which crosses the city of Isfahan in a 3-kilometre stretch. Guardians of the ancient Iranian artistic tradition more than innovators, they carry out a refined and sumptuous art of the court, with an affected manner filled with great poetic charm. Their fall led to a rapid degeneration of art in Iran. This article is in the process of being translated from the French Wikipedia version.

The series ended after 99 chapters on March 19, 2009. Special A has been licensed for English-language release in North America by Viz Media and in Australia and New Zealand by Madman Entertainment. The series has also been licensed in Germany, Italy, Poland, France and Taiwan. In 2007, Hana to Yume announced an anime adaptation of the manga entitled Special A. It was animated by Gonzo and AIC and ran for 24 episodes, from April 6, 2008 to September 14, 2008 in Japan. In 2013, Hana to Yume released a single volume sequel called Special A - Street Fight. Setting Hakusenkan (or Private Hakusen Academy) is the best school in the prefecture. The classes are separated into A‚ÄìF based on grades. The A class is only open for the top students in each grade. The top seven within the A class, from first year to third year, are known as the Special A or SA class (hence the title). The members of SA are highly respected and are often seen being elaborately greeted by other students with the exception of few that dislike the SA. The SA class has its own building, a 19th-century styled greenhouse dubbed \\"The School's Paradise\\". They also have a kitchen, where Akira makes her afternoon tea. Class attendance is optional, but Hikari is the only one who chooses to attend classes. Their uniform is also different from the standard uniform. The members of the SA have been close friends since elementary school. Plot Hikari Hanazono has always been second to Kei Takishima. When they were six years old, their pro-wrestling loving fathers introduced them to each other. Assuming that she was the best in wrestling, young Hikari challenged Kei to a wrestling match only to be thoroughly defeated by him. Ever since that fateful incident, Hikari swore to beat Kei in school grades, sporting events or any competition. To do this, she has enrolled in the same school as Kei since elementary. Now she attends Hakusenkan, an ultra elite school for the wealthy, that costs her carpenter father a lot of money. Hikari and Kei are the top two students in the school, with Kei holding firmly to that number one position. While Hikari considers Kei to be a rival and important friend, she is completely unaware that Kei has strong feelings for her. The series primarily focuses on Hikari and her constant attempts to defeat her one and only rival, Kei, and how she finds love in their rivalry. However, Special A also follows the stories of the other five members of the S.A class ‚Äì Akira Toudou, Tadashi Karino, Megumi and Jun Yamamoto, and Ryuu Tsuji ‚Äì and their relationships. Yahiro Saiga and Sakura Ushikubo, two students from the rival academy Kokusen, also become recurring characters in the series.

Katherine Dacey compared the central two characters as \\"a gender reversed Frank Butler and Annie Oakley\\", and noted that Kei comes off as \\"rather sexist\\". Erin Finnegan disliked the manga, because the secondary characters were poorly developed and she felt the story was misogynistic. Jennifer Dunbar enjoyed the wish-fulfilment of seeing rich kids \\"getting to do whatever they want\\" without being conceited about this, but felt the complications in the last volume were boring. Jason Thompson disliked the \\"action slapstick\\" of the first two volumes, but felt that even after the two leads became more fleshed out as characters through their romance that the series was \\"founded on cliches\\" and felt the rest of the cast was underdeveloped. Allen Moody of THEM Anime Reviews gave a more positive review of series, giving it 4 out of 5 stars and stating that although the first set of episodes focused too much on the Kei/Hikari rivalry, the later episodes were able to develop the characters more and eventually become likable in their own way.

It is the main north-south road of Meriden, Berlin and New Britain. Route description Route 71 begins at an intersection with US 5 in Wallingford. After 0.23 miles, it joins Route 150 for a 0.13 mile wrong way concurrency through the Yalesville Underpass. Route 71 resumes its northward course, entering Meriden and passing the east end of Route 70. In the center of Meriden, Route 71 becomes a pair of one way sections as it intersects West Main Street. While southbound traffic may continue from West Main Street onto Cook Avenue, northbound traffic must turn right onto Hanover Street, then left onto South Grove Street, and left onto West Main Street to continue. Once reunited, Route 71 proceeds west on West Main Street before turning north onto Chamberlain Highway. It then crosses I-691 at Exit 5, with access to and from the west. It then crosses into Berlin, passing the eastern end of Route 364 before turning northeast as the Chamberlain Highway becomes Route 71A. In the Kensington section of town, it turns more northward, and intersects Route 372. It then has a junction with SR 571, a limited access connector that provides access to Route 9 and Routes 71A and 372. After the SR 571 overpass, Route 71 immediately enters New Britain as it passes by New Britain Stadium. It then continues toward downtown, before meeting the east end of the Route 72 expressway as it intersects Route 9, with direct access to Route 9 south. After the overpass, it intersects the west end of Route 174. Continuing north, it intersects the west end of Route 175 before passing by Central Connecticut State University. After turning northeast, it once again intersects Route 9 at Exit 30. After passing through a 0.18 mile portion of Farmington, and a 0.04 mile sliver of Newington, Route 71 enters West Hartford and becomes New Britain Avenue, where it turns east and has an interchange with, but does not cross, I-84 and US 6 at Exit 40. Access to and from I-84 west is provided by SR 535 (Ridgewood Road). Shortly thereafter, Route 71 ends at South Main Street, as Route 173 south turns east onto New Britain Avenue to assume through traffic. History Route 71 was established in the 1932 state highway renumbering as a route between downtown New Britain and Hartford. In the 1920s, this was part of State Highway 113, which ran from Plainville via New Britain to Hartford. The Plainville to New Britain section became part of Route 72 (now Route 372) in 1932. In 1934, the route was modified at both ends. The northern end was truncated to end at the Colt Highway (U.S. Route 6A), roughly at the location of Exit 40 of I-84. The south end was extended to U.S. Route 5A in Meriden via Kensington along Chamberlain Highway, Bradley Avenue, and Hanover Road (former State Highway 178). In 1962, US 5A in Meriden was removed and Route 71 signed at I-84 south of West Main Street was relocated to the former US 5A alignment (Cook Avenue and Old Colony Road). In 1969, Route 71 was extended to its current northern end at Route 173 in West Hartford after US 6 was relocated to I-84 (US 6A became US 6 in the early 1940s). Route 71 was once planned to be a freeway south from the planned southwestern Interstate 291 to the Route 72 freeway in 1961. In 1963, the state increased the planned mileage by planning the freeway to travel further north of I-291 to the Cedar Ridge Connector/Old Route 9 (remnants of which are now SR 504). The 1961 plan was built in 1986 as SR 506 but the rest of the Route 71 freeway was cancelled. In 1989, Route 9 became the southern terminus of the Route 71 freeway instead of the northern terminus. Route 9 was newly constructed west to, and extended onto the existing Route 72 freeway near Berlin and onto SR 506. The Route 72 designation was scaled back westward to the old interchange with SR 506.Connecticut Routes, Route 71 Junction list Route 71A Route 71A is a minor north-south spur route of Route 71 and is long. It begins as Chamberlain Highway at Route 71 in Berlin and heads northward along High Road, briefly overlapping Route 372.

'Mullo' means 'one who is dead'. A mullo is created when a person dies suddenly of some unnatural cause or the person did not have proper funeral rites. A mullo is described as having white clothes, hair that reaches to their feet, and one physical oddity (a trait which varies from geographic region to region). A mullo's existence is in seeking out people it did not like in life and harassing that person. Mullo are believed to return and do malicious things and/or attack by strangling and suck the blood of a person (usually a relative who had caused their death, or hadn't properly observed the burial ceremonies, or who kept the deceased's possessions instead of destroying them as was proper). To get rid of a vampire people would hire a Dhampir (the son of a vampire and his widow) to detect the vampire. To ward off vampires, Romani people drove steel or iron needles into a corpse's heart and placed bits of steel in the mouth, over the eyes, ears and between the fingers at the time of burial. They also placed hawthorn in the corpse's sock or drove a hawthorn stake through the legs. Further measures included driving stakes into the grave, pouring boiling water over it, decapitating the corpse, or burning it.

Membrane lipids are a group of compounds (structurally similar to fats and oils) which form the double- layered surface of all cells (lipid bilayer). The three major classes of membrane lipids are phospholipids, glycolipids, and cholesterol. Lipids are amphiphilic: they have one end that is soluble in water ('polar') and an ending that is soluble in fat ('nonpolar'). By forming a double layer with the polar ends pointing outwards and the nonpolar ends pointing inwards membrane lipids can form a 'lipid bilayer' which keeps the watery interior of the cell separate from the watery exterior. The arrangements of lipids and various proteins, acting as receptors and channel pores in the membrane, control the entry and exit of other molecules and ions as part of the cell's metabolism. In order to perform physiological functions, membrane proteins are facilitated to rotate and diffuse laterally in two dimensional expanse of lipid bilayer by the presence of a shell of lipids closely attached to protein surface, called annular lipid shell. Biological roles The bilayer formed by membrane lipids serves as a containment unit of a living cell. Membrane lipids also form a matrix in which membrane proteins reside. Historically lipids were thought to merely serve a structural role. Functional roles of lipids are in fact many: They serve as regulatory agents in cell growth and adhesion. They participate in the biosynthesis of other biomolecules. They can serve to increase enzymatic activities of enzymes.R. B. Gennis. Biomembranes - Molecular Structure and Function. Springer-Verlag, New York (1989). Non- bilayer forming lipid like monogalactosyl diglyceride (MGDG) predominates the bulk lipids in thylakoid membranes, which when hydrated alone, forms reverse hexagonal cylindrical phase. However, in combination with other lipids and carotenoids/chlorophylls of thylakoid membranes, they too conform together as lipid bilayers.YashRoy R.C. (1990) Lamellar dispersion and phase separation of chloroplast membrane lipids by negative staining electron microscopy. Journal of Biosciences, vol. 15(2), pp. 93-98.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230820037_Lamellar_dispersion_and_phase_separation_of_chloroplast_membrane_lipids_by_negative_staining_electron_microscopy?ev=prf_pub =Membrane lipid language= The membrane metabolites of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have an essential role in intercellular biochemical communications. Crawford (2010) in his chapter Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids in human brain evolution reported, with regard to the language of lipids, that the importance of the increased complexity of these lipids was brought about by aerobic metabolism, whereby the simple language of prokaryotes, with only a few words, was developed into a vocabulary of over 1,000 words of eukaryote cells. About 500 million years ago, some nervous cells and some gut cells of vertebrates migrated and specialized in a more complex nervous system: the brain, and in uptake and storage of iodocompounds: the follicular thyroid. In the PUFAs, the presence of a double bond between two carbons (or carbon-carbon double bond) provides them with the possibility of changing their molecular structure through enzymes such as phospholipases, cyclooxygenases and lipoxygenases, etc. The resulting substances, called eicosanoids: prostaglandins (PG), leukotrienes (LT), lipoxins and thromboxane (TX); and docosanoids: resolvins, protectins, and maresins, are powerful lipid mediators that produce specific actions in the organism; they organize inflammation, hemodynamic, immune response and the repair of tissue. Many PUFAs cannot be synthesized by animal organisms and are considered essential, and therefore should be incorporated into diets. These are: linoleic acid (C18:2 n-6), omega-6 and alpha-linolenic (C18:3 n-3) omega-3, arachidonic acid (AA) ‚Äì omega ‚Äì 6 (C20: 4n-6), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) ‚Äì omega-3 (C22:6n-3). These PUFAs are incorporated into the phospholipidic membrane of all the cells of an organism. In parallel, ectodermic cells, differentiated into neuronal cells, became the primitive nervous system and brain. Both these cells synthesized iodolipids, as novel words of the chemical lipid language developed among cell membranes during the evolution of life. These biochemical signals among cells, since contact and modification of membranes in multicellular organisms formed the bases of adaptation to terrestrial environments, and their alterations are important in the mechanism of apoptosis, carcinogenesis and degenerative diseases, as well as for understand some problems discussed regarding human evolution (as Aquatic ape hypothesis). Major classes =Phospholipids= Phospholipids and glycolipids consist of two long, nonpolar (hydrophobic) hydrocarbon chains linked to a hydrophilic head group. The heads of phospholipids are phosphorylated and they consist of either: * Glycerol (and hence the name phosphoglycerides given to this group of lipids), or * Sphingosine (e.g. sphingomyelin and ceramide). Glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether (GDGT) is helping to study ancient environmental factors. =Glycolipids= The heads of glycolipids (glyco- stands for sugar) contain a sphingosine with one or several sugar units attached to it. The hydrophobic chains belong either to: :*two fatty acids (FA) ‚Äì in the case of the phosphoglycerides, or :*one FA and the hydrocarbon tail of sphingosine ‚Äì in the case of sphingomyelin and the glycolipids. Galactolipids ‚Äì monogalactosyl diglyceride (MGDG) and digalactosyl diglycreride (DGDG) form the predominant lipids in higher plant chloroplast thylakoid membranes; liposomal structures formed by total lipid extract of thylakoid membranes have been found sensitive to sucrose as it turns bilayers into micellar structures.YashRoy R.C. (1994) Destabilisation of lamellar dispersion of thylakoid membrane lipids by sucrose. Biochimica et Biophysica Acta, vol. 1212, pp. 129-133.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/15042978_Destabilisation_of_lamellar_dispersion_of_thylakoid_membrane_lipids_by_sucrose?ev=prf_pub =Fatty acids= The fatty acids in phospho- and glycolipids usually contain an even number, typically between 14 and 24, of carbon atoms, with 16- and 18-carbon being the most common. FAs may be saturated or unsaturated, with the configuration of the double bonds nearly always cis. The length and the degree of unsaturation of FAs chains have a profound effect on membranes' fluidity. Plant thylakoid membranes maintain high fluidity, even at relatively cold environmental temperatures, due to the abundance of 18-carbon fatty acyl chains with three double bonds, linolenic acid, as has been revealed by 13-C NMR studies.YashRoy R.C. (1987) 13-C NMR studies of lipid fatty acyl chains of chloroplast membranes. Indian Journal of Biochemistry and Biophysics, vol. 24(6), pp. 177-178.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230822408_13-C_NMR_studies_of_lipid_fatty_acyl_chains_of_chloroplast_membranes?ev=prf_pub =Phosphoglycerides= In phosphoglycerides, the hydroxyl groups at C-1 and C-2 of glycerol are esterified to the carboxyl groups of the FAs. The C-3 hydroxyl group is esterified to phosphoric acid. The resulting compound, called phosphatidate, is the simplest phosphoglycerate. Only small amounts of phosphatidate are present in membranes. However, it is a key intermediate in the biosynthesis of the other phosphoglycerides. =Sphingolipids= Sphingosine is an amino alcohol that contains a long, unsaturated hydrocarbon chain. In sphingomyelin and glycolipids, the amino group of sphingosine is linked to FAs by an amide bond. In sphingomyelin the primary hydroxyl group of sphingosine is esterified to phosphoryl choline. Space-filling models of (a) sphingomyelin and (b) cholesterol. In glycolipids, the sugar component is attached to this group. The simplest glycolipid is cerebroside, in which there is only one sugar residue, either Glc or Gal. More complex glycolipids, such as gangliosides, contain a branched chain of as many as seven sugar residues. =Sterols= The best known sterol is cholesterol, which is found in humans. Cholesterol also occurs naturally in other eukaryote cell membranes. Sterols have a hydrophobic four-membered fused ring rigid structure, and a small polar head group. Cholesterol is bio-synthesised from mevalonate via a squalene cyclisation of terpenoids. Cell membranes require high levels of cholesterol ‚Äì typically an average of 20% cholesterol in the whole membrane, increasing locally in raft areas up to 50% cholesterol (- % is molecular ratio).de Meyer F, Smit B. Effect of cholesterol on the structure of a phospholipid bilayer. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 2009; 106: 3654-8. It associates preferentially with sphingolipids (see diagram) in cholesterol-rich lipid rafts areas of the membranes in eukaryotic cells. Formation of lipid rafts promotes aggregation of peripheral and transmembrane proteins including docking of SNARE and VAMP proteins.Lang T, Bruns D, Wenzel D, Riedel D, Holroyd P, Thiele C, Jahn R. SNAREs are concentrated in cholesterol-dependent clusters that define docking and fusion sites for exocytosis EMBO J 2001;20:2202-13.

The story was later published in Stevenson's collection The Merry Men and Other Tales and Fables (1887). It is set on the fictional island Eilean Aros, based on the Isle of Erraid.Stevenson, Robert Louis, Memories and Portraits, Chapter 8, \\"Memoirs of an Islet\\" The title derives from the local name given to a group of waves in the story, not from the Merry Men of Robin Hood and his merry men Plot summary The narrator, Charles Darnaway, a recent graduate of the University of Edinburgh travels to the remote island of Aros off the north-west coast of Scotland. Aros is the home of his uncle, Gordon Darnaway, a hard-hearted and alcoholic Presbyterian. Charles has come in search of sunken treasure, as he believes a ship of the Spanish Armada sank in the bay under his uncle's home long before. Charles hopes to use the treasure to restore the Darnaways' fortunes and marry Gordon's daughter (and Charles' cousin) Mary Ellen. Charles is rowed out to the promontory by the only other inhabitant, Gordon's servant Rorie. Charles is surprised to find both Rorie and Gordon anxious and full of foreboding, though both furtively evade his questions. He is further surprised to find his uncle's austere home decorated with expensive lamps and rugs. He realizes at once they must have come from a shipwreck, and feels uneasy about this looting of the dead. His cousin Mary Ellen confirms that a ship was recently cast away nearby, having been driven by a storm into the dreadful breakers around the promontory, breakers that roar a hundred feet high around the rocks and are called \\"the Merry Men\\" due to the vast noise they make, like shrieking laughter. Charles goes down to the shore on his treasure-hunt. While there he sees the shattered hull of the wrecked ship, and also a fresh grave. He realizes the grave must be for the body of a mariner washed ashore. He takes this as a bad omen, but still sets out to the point where he thinks the Spanish ship must be. His first dive locates a weed-grown structure which appears to be the sunken ship, but a second dive shows it to be only a rock formation. He hauls himself along the weed-grown rocks, looking for signs of the wreck, until the signs of an approaching storm warn him to return to shore. As he makes for the surface his handhold breaks off in his grip; when he pulls himself on shore he looks at it and is horrified to recognize a human leg bone. He lays the bone on the sand, resolving to do no more hunting for the wreck. On his way back to the house he sees a small boat, full of strangers, rowing around the bay. Watching them he is convinced that they too are searching for the sunken Spanish ship. He returns to tell his uncle that he saw a stranger on the shore, and is surprised by Gordon's panicked dread. Charles realizes that the mariner whose grave he saw came ashore alive, and that his uncle murdered him. Gordon runs out into the storm, with Charles after him, only to see the strangers' ship caught in the Merry Men and destroyed. Further down the shore they find a man standing in the hull of the earlier wreck, a black man who speaks no language Charles knows. By sign language the stranger signifies that he is one of the strangers' party that was left behind, but Gordon, his guilty conscience overwhelming him, believes him to be the ghost of the man he murdered. Driven mad, Gordon flees into the storm and eventually flings himself into the sea, pursued by the silent stranger; both are swallowed up by the Merry Men. Analysis Eilean (Scottish Gaelic for island) Aros, the fictional island setting of the story, is based on the Isle of Erraid in the Inner Hebrides. Stevenson wrote of his time there in his collection of essays Memories and Portraits, where he says \\"[t]here is another isle in my collection, the memory of which besieges me. I put a whole family there, in one of my tales; and later on, threw upon its shores, and condemned to several days of rain and shellfish on its tumbled boulders, the hero of another.\\" It is possible that the stranger from the Sea may be the Devil. There was a long tradition in Scotland that the Devil appeared as a black man (Stevenson mentions this in a footnote to Thrawn Janet, another story in the same collection.) Also, Gordon earlier claimed that the Sea was the work of the Devil. A parallel can be drawn between this story and the later Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad, another story of an isolated man driven mad by Nature. Gordon's rant about the Devil living in the Sea ends with him moaning, \\"The horror! The horror of the sea!\\" ...which is echoed in Conrad in Kurtz's last message: \\"The horror! The horror! Exterminate all the brutes!\\" References External links * Category:1882 short stories Category:Short stories by Robert Louis Stevenson Category:Works originally published in The Cornhill Magazine Category:Scotland in fiction Category:Islands in fiction ","title":"The Merry Men (short story)"},{"id":"9486007","text":"Kunukku is an ancient Christian Keralite type of jewelry.

In the U.S. Department of Education model, 17 Career Clusters link to 70+ more specific Career Pathways ‚Äì each have their own knowledge and skills requirements. Within the 70+ career pathways, 1800 Career Specialties are defined. The structure has evolved over time and may vary by state. The U.S. DOE Career Clusters framework is useful for connecting students with courses of study and careers via Career Assessments, and allows them to learn general, more transferable skills at the cluster level, with more specific skills and knowledge acquired at the career pathways and specialty levels. The nonprofit Vocational Research Institute adapted an interest and aptitude assessment, Careerscope, to help students choose curriculum and careers for which they have both interest and aptitude - at the cluster, pathway and career specialty levels. A concept related to Career Clusters, Small Learning Community is primarily concerned with restructuring secondary schools, in many cases using a career clusters framework. Background The Career Cluster initiative began in 1996 in the U.S. as the Building Linkages Initiative and was a collaborative effort between the U.S. Department of Education, the Office of Vocational and Adult Education (OVAE), the National School-to-Work Office (NSTWO) and the National Skill Standards Board (NSSB). The purpose of the Initiative was to establish linkages among State educational agencies, secondary and post-secondary educational institutions, employers, industry groups, other stakeholders and Federal agencies. The goal was to create curricular frameworks in broad career clusters, designed to prepare students to transition successfully from high school to post-secondary education and employment in a career area.. The creation of curricular models within the context of broad career clusters ensures the alignment of academic and technical instructional strategies with the requirements of post-secondary education and the expectations of employers in increasingly academic and technologically demanding careers. The vocational education field has historically responded to the needs of the national economy by preparing individuals for in-demand jobs.

One category termed a glycerophospholipid and the other a sphingomyelin, or more specifically within the sphingomyelin class, a sphingophospholipid. Phosphorylethanolamine is a polyprotic acid with two pKa values at 5.61 and 10.39. Phosphorylethanolamine has been falsely promoted as a cancer treatment. Effectiveness As a potential drug, phosphorylethanolamine has undergone human clinical trials. These were halted when no evidence of benefit was found. Edzard Ernst has called Phosphorylethanolamine \\"the most peculiar case of Brazilian quackery\\". Legality There has been ongoing controversy and litigation in Brazil with regard to its use as a cancer treatment without approval by the National Health Surveillance Agency. For years, Gilberto Chierice, a Chemistry Professor at the S√£o Carlos campus of the University of S√£o Paulo, used resources from a campus laboratory to unofficially manufacture, distribute, and promote the drug to cancer patients without it having gone through clinical testing. In September 2015, university administrators began preventing the Professor from continuing with this practice. In October 2015, several courts in Brazil ruled in favor of plaintiffs who wanted the right to try the compound. However, a state court overturned the lower courts' decision a month later. Jailson Bittencourt de Andrade, secretary for Brazil‚Äôs science and technology ministry, said the ministry plans to fund further research on the compound, but that it will be years before a determination can be made about phosphorylethanolamine's safety and efficacy in humans. On April 14, 2016, a law was passed in Brazil allowing the use of synthetic phosphorylethanolamine for cancer treatment, despite opposition from the Brazilian Medical Association, the Brazilian Society of Clinical Oncology, and the regulatory agency ANVISA. However, shortly after, the country's Supreme Court suspended the law.

Announced in January 1905 a 6-horsepower car remained available from Rover until 1912. Engine The engine was a 780 cc side-valve, single-cylinder unit, water-cooled, with a bore of 95 mm and stroke of 110 mm. The capacity increased to 812 cc in 1908 when the bore was increased to 97 mm to bring dimensions into line with Rover's new range of four-cylinder cars. { single-cylinder engine controls and instrument panel change speed lever on steering column } The engine's normal speed was 1200 rpm. Selection of top, middle or low gear provided speeds of 24 mph, 16 mph and 8 mph respectively. The change speed lever mounted in a notched quadrant below the steering wheel is linked by a connecting rod to a vertical spindle in the gearbox. Ignition was by High-Tension current from the Bosch magneto, low tension accumulator ignition was also provided. The crankcase, flywheel and clutch and gearbox enclosures are made up of one pair of aluminium castings. The upper half is bolted directly to the frame at the front and at the rear is bolted to a thin steel cross-member. The clutch runs in oil and uses the metal to metal gripping disc system of the 8 hp car. Drive was taken to the rear wheels through a three-speed gearbox, light but very similar to the earlier car, and jointed drive shaft. The brake drum at the back of the gearbox surrounds the universal joint, the rear axle casing extends forward to almost the universal joint. There is a bevel wheel in the differential case. The engine's throttle is operated by a lever below the steering wheel. The same lever simultaneously controls the ignition timing. Petrol is in a tank beneath the driver's seat. Chassis This new smaller car employed a conventional steel reinforced (with flitch plates) wooden chassis with half elliptic leaf springs front and rear supporting the car on rigid axles. The forward end of the springs are fixed rigidly to the chassis frame, the rear ends slide within brackets. The right pedal applies iron-lined external bands on the rear brake drums through levers and horizontal shafts. The left pedal first releases the clutch then when moved further the same pedal to ease the gear change applies the brake on the propellor shaft drum behind the gearbox. Steering is by rack and pinion. Wheels are of steel wire with tangent spokes. Road test The test car was finished in dark green and black with matching pegamoid upholstery. The seat was removable and the footboards and rear platform were covered with green cork lino. They drove the car three hundred miles then Autocar's testers said: the single wide seat was capable of carrying two people with every comfort and the car looked fit to take anywhere. Control was so simple a child could drive it. Change speed was a little stiff. Would prefer separate control for the spark (ignition). Steering excellent. Two involuntary stops: an air valve stuck while climbing a hill and the trembler on the coil stuck. They declared the little Rover an \\"Ideal car for a man of very moderate means\\".A trial of the 6hp Rover car. page 634, The Autocar, 18 November 1905 Revision May 1909 This car now has the same Rover patented carburettor as their 8 hp car. The change speed lever is now in an exterior quadrant near the driver's right hand instead of beneath the steering wheel. The universal joint to the propellor shaft has been redesigned and the propellor shaft's casing now acts as a torque rod. The brake on the back of the gearbox which is controlled by the clutch is now very much larger. There are now separate levers for throttle and ignition timing. The front springs now have shackle pins. A fan has been added to the engine cooling system. Petrol is now carried on the dashboard. There is a pawl below the brake pedal so it can be used to brake the car on a slope.The latest 6hp Rover. page 771, The Autocar, 29 May 1909 In 1910 a complete Rover 6 with two- seater body and weather protection cost GBP155 but an earlier model had been sold as a \\"hundred guinea car\\" (GBP105).

Sour Shoes gained notoriety for calling into radio programs like The Howard Stern Show and Mike and the Mad Dog. In a 2014 article, Rolling Stone referred to Sour Shoes as a musical genius, and he is often accepted into the shows that he pranks, as in the case of Adam Carolla. Personal life Sour Shoes grew up in Baldwin, New York and currently lives in Mahopac, New York. DelCampo revealed he had to live in his car during his days at college. DelCampo works with Autism Speaks helping autistic children. Career On June 5, 2003, DelCampo gained visibility as a comedic artist with his first appearance on The Howard Stern Show. According to the staff, Michael came to the station carrying instruments and skating on roller blades. Stern asked \\"What are you, a street musician?\\", which he confirmed, continuing with impersonations of mostly singers. Stern found him odd but many on the staff enjoyed his antics, particularly K.C. Armstrong. Stern once asked, \\"Are you bipolar?\\" and Sour Shoes jokingly replied, \\"I'm bicoastal from Malibu to Mahopac.\\" By 2005, Sour Shoes became a regular on the Stern show, including doing song requests. Comedy style DelCampo's quick comedic stylings of voice and improvisation are reminiscent of a young Robin Williams. Howard Stern has compared Sour Shoes to Rich Little. Noine and other phrases DelCampo has popularized several catch phrases including \\"ooooo\\" and the word \\"noine\\", a mispronunciation of the word nine by Howard Stern producer Gary Dell'Abate, that his fans have since embraced in relation to the comedian.https://www.howardstern.com/news/2017/3/7/sour-shoes-gary-dellabate- impression-inspires-noine-greatest-nines-tribute/ Notable impressions *Gary Dell'Abate *Mike Francesa *Gilbert Gottfried *Don Imus *John Sterling *Suzyn Waldman *Artie Lange *Chris \\"Mad Dog\\" Russo *David Lee Roth *Richard Simmons *George Takei *Jackie Martling *Bobby Valentine *Sid Rosenberg *Scott Ferrall *Mariann From Brooklyn References External links * Official site of Sour Shoes Category:Living people Category:American male comedians Category:Comedians from New York (state) Category:1974 births Category:21st- century American comedians ","title":"Sour Shoes"},{"id":"9486224","text":"North Carolina State University's College of Engineering (CoE) is the flagship college of engineering in the state of North Carolina and the largest college at North Carolina State University in terms of enrollment, followed by CHASS, with 9 core departments and 3 affiliated departments offering 18 bachelor's, 17 master's and 13 doctoral degrees.

Carter is vacationing in a borrowed yacht in Hong Kong disguised as playboy, Clark Harrington. He is contacted by friend and CIA agent, Bob Ludwell. Ludwell confides in Carter that he is leaving Hong Kong that night to cross into China on an undisclosed mission and that he does not expect to survive. Ludwell has clearly lost his nerve and hands Carter an envelope with instructions to give it to his wife and children if he does not return in a week. Carter is followed indicating that he has been connected with Ludwell. Carter murders the tail and returns to his yacht anchored in Victoria Harbour where he finds that his cabin boy has been murdered in retaliation. A note pinned to the boy‚Äôs body warns Carter to leave Hong Kong immediately or face the consequences from the Society of the Red Tiger. A Marine Police cutter arrives and Carter is informed that Ludwell was murdered before he had the chance to leave Hong Kong. It is apparent to the police that Ludwell was killed and dismembered on the orders of James (Jim) Pok ‚Äì leader of the Red Tiger tong. Carter arranges to undertake Ludwell's mission. Carter's yacht is being watched by the Tiger tong. Carter swims ashore helped by Fan Su ‚Äì Ludwell's contact in China who has come to Hong Kong to discover what has happened to him. Fan Su is an anti- communist guerilla fighter based in Hong Kong. She was working with Ludwell to foment an anti-communist revolution in China. She has made contact with a Chinese army general wishing to defect. Ludwell's secret mission was to go to China and escort the general into Hong Kong and thence to the US. The general has been severely wounded and is holed up in a Buddhist temple 5-10 miles from the Hong Kong-China border. Fan Su helps Carter enter China in a coffin disguised as the repatriated corpse of her dead relative. Carter and Fan Su reach the temple as a company of Chinese soldiers begin to search the nearby countryside for the missing general. Under the cover of night, Carter, Fan Su and the general elude the search parties, steal a tank and crash through the border into Hong Kong. The general survives and is sent to the US to recover. Jim Pok meets Carter and tries to bargain with him to hand over Fan Su to save face with his Chinese paymasters. Carter refuses and threatens to spread rumours among the underworld crime network that Pok has double-crossed the Chinese government ‚Äì damaging Pok's reputation and putting his life at risk. Carter throws Pok over the side of his yacht and returns to the cabin to make love to Fan Su.

Playing career MacLaren's league career in England began with Shrewsbury Town, having joined them from Rangers. He joined the club in 1980 and was there for four seasons playing 161 games and scoring 18 times. It was at Shrewsbury that he first moved from the role of a midfielder to that of a defender. He moved to Derby County in 1985 for a fee of ¬£67,00 and was voted Rams player of the year in his first season, 1985‚Äì86, in which Derby were promoted to Division Two. An ever present player in the team in his first two seasons, MacLaren was a key figure in Derby's second successive promotion; winning the Second Division Championship in his second season at the Baseball Ground. In August 1988, he was bought by Swindon Town manager Lou Macari for ¬£165,000, having previously being valued at ¬£450,000. Playing as a defensive midfield player, MacLaren was known for accurate long passes and his powerful shooting from outside the area; Swindon scored many goals from rebounds after the opposing goalkeeper was unable to hold one of MacLaren's shots. He was also handed the responsibility of being the club's penalty taker. Under Ossie Ardiles the following season, MacLaren was ever-present as the defensive player in Ossie's diamond-shaped midfield. The season ended with a Wembley appearance, as the club were promoted to Division One after the 1‚Äì0 win over Sunderland, only to be demoted by the League ten days later. MacLaren missed just one game in 1990‚Äì91 and played the first 32 league matches the following year until a hernia problem brought an end to his season. The injury and related operations kept him out of the side for almost a year, returning to action at the end of January 1993. Though MacLaren seemed to have piled on the pounds, seven wins out of the next ten games helped Swindon secure a play-off place. This resulted in MacLaren's second successful visit to Wembley with the club, as they beat Leicester City 4‚Äì3 and were promoted into the FA Premier League. After five years loyal service, he was also handed the captaincy for the Premier League season by new manager John Gorman. Though he was never a quick player, the extra weight that MacLaren was carrying seemed to slow him even more. He made just twelve appearances that season, with the club winning none of the matches he played in. A recurrence of his hernia problem kept him out of the side again for a period, and the 1994‚Äì95 season proved to be his last, a comeback lasting just three games ‚Äì his last game for Swindon coming on 26 November 1994, in a 2‚Äì1 defeat at Luton Town. In his career with just three clubs Maclaren played 480 times, 466 of them from the start, and scored 31 goals. Coaching After retiring, MacLaren moved behind the scenes at Swindon and became the club's reserve team coach. He was sacked in a cost- cutting move in 1998 - seven other members of staff were also made redundant in a move that brought about Steve McMahon's resignation. MacLaren then became the chief scout at Aston Villa, working under John Gregory for the first time. Due to the managerial shake-up at Aston Villa in February 2002, he left Villa Park with Gregory to become a coach at Derby County. Suspended by Derby for six-weeks on 21 March 2003, MacLaren left the club by mutual consent on 10 May 2003. He took over the management of Southend's under-18 team before returning to League football as assistant manager of League Two club Notts County. He left the club at the end of the 2005‚Äì06 season when his contract was not renewed. Personal life MacLaren's brother Donald had a short career as a footballer with Dunfermline Athletic (after failing to break through at Heart of Midlothian) prior to emigrating to Australia;Dunfermline Athletic: 1946/47 - 2013/14, Post War English & Scottish Football League A - Z Player's Transfer Database his nephew Jamie Maclaren, Donald's son, is also a footballer who has played in Scotland, England and Germany and for the Australian national team.Easter Road loan star Jamie Maclaren determined to follow in his dad‚Äôs footsteps by starring at Tynecastle ‚Äì but for Hibs, Deadline News, 10 January 2018 References External links * * Player Profile ‚Äì Swindon-Town- FC.co.uk * Player Profile ‚Äì Sporting Heroes Category:Living people Category:1962 births Category:Footballers from Edinburgh Category:Scottish footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Association football midfielders Category:Association football coaches Category:Association football scouts Category:Rangers F.C. players Category:Shrewsbury Town F.C. players Category:Derby County F.C. players Category:Swindon Town F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:Premier League players Category:Swindon Town F.C. non-playing staff Category:Southend United F.C. non-playing staff Category:Derby County F.C. non-playing staff Category:Notts County F.C. non-playing staff Category:Aston Villa F.C. non-playing staff ","title":"Ross MacLaren"},{"id":"9486249","text":"Manolis Chiotis (Greek: ŒúŒ±ŒΩœéŒªŒ∑œÇ ŒßŒπœéœÑŒ∑œÇ; March 21, 1921, Thessaloniki - March 20, 1970, Athens) was a Greek rebetiko and laiko composer, singer, and bouzouki player.

Historically, it was considered closely related to the genus Memnoniella, because the spores are produced in slimy heads rather than in dry chains. Recently, the synonymy of the two genera is generally accepted. Most Stachybotrys species inhabit materials rich in cellulose. The genus has a widespread distribution and contains about 50 species. The name comes from the Greek words œÉœÑŒ±œáœÖœÇ stakhus (ear of grain, stalk, stick; metaphorically, progeny) and Œ≤œåœÑœÅœÖœÇ botrus (cluster or bunch as in grapes, trusses). The most infamous species, S. chartarum (previously known as S. atra) and S. chlorohalonata, are known as \\"black mold\\" or toxic black mold in the U.S., and are frequently associated with poor indoor air quality that arises after fungal growth on water-damaged building materials. Stachybotrys chemotypes are toxic, with one producing trichothecene mycotoxins including satratoxins, and another that produces atranones.  Detection  Four distinctive microbial volatile organic compounds (MVOCs) ‚Äì 1-butanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol, 3-methyl-2-butanol, and thujopsene ‚Äì were detected on rice cultures, and only one (1-butanol) was detected on gypsum board cultures. Removal Contact a licensed indoor environmental assessor, and provide a lab analysis and hire a certified mold remediator. Pathogenicity Stachybotrys spores 10 X 40 magnification under bright field microscopy =Symptoms of Stachybotrys exposure in humans= A controversy began in the early 1990s after analysis of two infant deaths and multiple cases in children from the poor areas of Cleveland, Ohio, due to pulmonary hemorrhage were initially linked to exposure to heavy amounts of Stachybotrys chartarum. Subsequent and extensive reanalysis of the cases by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have failed to find any link between the deaths and the mold exposure.

Malone, a Chicago economist and newspaper equipment consultant. It was developed into a teaching aid to help children acquire reading and writing skills. Like the pronunciation key in a dictionary, Unifon matches each of the sounds of spoken English with a single symbol. The method was tested in Chicago, Indianapolis, and elsewhere during the 1960s and 1970s, but no statistical analysis of the outcome was ever published in an academic journal. Interest by educators has been limited, but a community of enthusiasts continues to publicize the scheme and advocate for its adoption.www.unifon.org  Alphabet  A basic representation of the modern Unifon alphabet The Unifon alphabet contains 40 glyphs, intended to represent the 40 most important sounds of the English language. Although the set of sounds has remained the same, several of the symbols have been modified over the years, making \\"Modern Unifon\\" slightly different from \\"Old Unifon.\\" The Unifon alphabet: A Œî …Ö B »ª D E ∆éE ∆éR F G H ¬± J K L M N /ùñ© O êçâ ‚µÄ Íêé Íêé P R S $ T ùà•ÃÑ –ã U ‚©å ‚©É V W Z Y ∆µhttp://www.unifon.org/pages/unifon- alphabet.htmlhttp://www.unicode.org/L2/L2012/12138-n4262-unifon.pdf Unifon letters unified with existing characters. Of the 66 letters used in the various Unifon alphabets, 43 of them‚Äîabout two-thirds‚Äîcan be unified with existing letters. Note that none of the small-cap letters are encoded modifier letters: they are small-caps styled forms of ordinary small letters. A [√¶], …Ö […í], B [b], C [s], »ª [t É], ‚ÜÉ [t É], D [d], E […õ], ∆é […ô], F [f], G […°], H [h], J [d í], K [k], L [l], M [m], N [n], O […î], √ò [ ä], P [p], R [r], S [s], T [t], U [ å], V [v], W [w], X [x], Y [j], ∆µ [ í] History Under a contract with the Bendix Corporation, Malone created the alphabet as part of a larger project. When the International Air Transport Association selected English as the language of international airline communications in 1957, the market that Bendix had foreseen for Unifon ceased to exist, and his contract was terminated. According to Malone, Unifon surfaced again when his son, then in kindergarten, complained that he could still not read. Malone recovered the alphabet to teach his son.Malone Beginning before 1960 and continuing into the 1980s, Margaret S. Ratz used Unifon to teach first-graders at Principia College in Elsah, Illinois.Ratz By the summer of 1960, the ABC-TV affiliate station in Chicago produced a 90-minute program in which Ratz taught three children how to read, in \\"17 hours with cookies and milk,\\" as Malone described it. In a presentation to parents and teachers, Ratz said, \\"Some have called Unifon 'training wheels for reading', and that's what it really is. Unifon will be used for a few weeks, or perhaps a few months, but during this time your child will discover there is a great similarity between Unifon and what he sees on TV screens, in comics or road signs, and on cereal boxes. Soon he finds with amusement that he can read the 'old people's alphabet' as easily as he can read and write in Unifon.\\" During the following two years, Unifon gained national attention, with coverage from NBC's Today Show and CBS's On the Road with Charles Kuralt (in a segment called \\"The Day They Changed the Alphabet\\"). In 1981, Malone turned over the Unifon project to Dr. John M. Culkin, a media scholar who was a former Jesuit priest and Harvard School of Education graduate. Culkin wrote numerous articles about Unifon, including several in Science Digest. In 2000, the Unifon web site, http://www.unifon.org, was created by Pat Katzenmaier with much input from linguist Steve Bett. It has served since then as a central point for organization of Unifon-related efforts. Unifon for Native American languages In the 1970s and 1980s, a systematic attempt was made to adapt Unifon as a spelling system for several Native American languages. The chief driving force behind this effort was Tom Parsons of Humboldt State University, who developed spelling schemes for Hupa, Yurok, Tolowa, and Karok, which were then improved by native scholars. In spite of skepticism from linguists, years of work went into teaching the schemes, and numerous publications were written using them. In the end, however, once Parsons left the university, the impetus faded; other spelling schemes are currently used for all of the languages.Hinton, pp 244-245  Character set support  The special non-ASCII characters used in the Unifon alphabet have been assigned code points in one of the Unicode Private Use Areas by the ConScript Unicode Registry. Efforts are in progress to add the characters to the official Unicode character set.

He graduated from Benicia High School and spent much of his early life as a cartoonist for a local paper. Arneson studied at California College of the Arts in Oakland, California for his BFA and went on to receive an MFA from Mills College in Oakland, California in 1958. During the start of the 1960s, Arneson and several other California artists began to abandon the traditional manufacture of functional ceramic objects and instead began to make nonfunctional sculptures that made confrontational statements. The new movement was dubbed Funk Art, and Arneson is considered the father of the ceramic Funk movement. His body of work contains many self-portraits which have has been described as an \\"autobiography in clay\\".https://www.ucdavis.edu/eggheads/robert-arneson/ Sintetos, Mike, Robert Arneson: Serious Ideas Behind that Humor, UC Davis website Doyen from 1972, in the collection of the Honolulu Museum of Art is an example of the artist's humorously caricatured self-portraits. Even his large Eggheads sculptures bear a self-resemblance. Among the last works Arneson completed before his 1992 death, five Eggheads were installed on campus at UC Davis around 1994. The controversial pieces continue to serve as a source of interest and discussion on the campus, even inspiring a campus blog by the same name. Two additional copies of Eggheads were installed in San Francisco. One of Arneson's most famous and controversial works is a bust of George Moscone, the mayor of San Francisco who was assassinated in 1978. Inscribed on the pedestal of the bust are words representing events in Moscone's life, including his assassination: the words \\"Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang\\", \\"Twinkies,\\" and \\"Harvey Milk Too!\\" are visible on the front of the pedestal. =Teaching career= Arneson's teaching career began soon after receiving his MFA degree from California College of Arts, with a stint at Santa Rosa Junior College, in Santa Rosa, California (1958‚Äì59). This was followed by a position at Fremont High School (1959‚Äì60) in Oakland, California, before advancing to teach design and crafts at Mills College, also located in Oakland (1960‚Äì62). Arneson's next appointment (in 1962) was at UC Davis, where his talents were recognized by Richard L. Nelson, who had founded the Art Department. It was during this period of the early 60s that Nelson was assembling a faculty that would come to be celebrated as one of the most prestigious in the nation. In addition to Arneson, Nelson had also selected Manuel Neri, Wayne Thiebaud and William T. Wiley, each of whom would go on to achieve international recognition... Initially hired to teach design classes (in the College of Agriculture), it was Arneson who established the ceramic sculpture program for the Art Department. It was in many ways a bold and radical move, in that ceramics were not yet recognized as a medium appropriate for fine art at that time.Biography Since its founding, the campus ceramics studio has been housed in a corrugated metal building known as TB-9, and it was here that Arneson held court for nearly three decades until his retirement in the summer of 1991. =Death= Robert C. Arneson Park in Benicia Arneson died on November 2, 1992, after a long battle with liver cancer. His home town of Benicia, California established a park in his memory, along the Carquinez Strait.  Collections  Arneson's fame is far-reaching, and his works can be found in public and private collections around the world, including the Art Institute of Chicago, the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts (Richmond, Virginia), the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden (Washington, DC), di Rosa (Napa, California), the Honolulu Museum of Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York City), the Museum of Contemporary Art (Kyoto, Japan), the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Racine Art Museum (Racine, Wisconsin), the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the Whitney Museum of American Art (New York City), the Birmingham Museum of Art, and the US Embassy in Yerevan, Armenia. His creations are also at the Lowe Art Museum in Coral Gables, Florida. The Nelson Gallery at UC Davis, where Arneson was a faculty member, owns 70 of the artist's works, including The Palace at 10am, which is currently on display in the gallery. The earthenware sculpture, a depiction of his former Davis residence, is considered among his most famous sculptures. Several of his etchings and lithographs also are on display in the library.

He was Governor of Portsmouth and a Lieutenant-General of the Ordnance. Life Erle was born in 1650, the second son of Thomas Erle and his wife Susanna Fiennes, daughter of William Fiennes, 1st Viscount Saye and Sele of Charborough. He matriculated at Trinity College, Oxford on 12 July 1667, aged 17 and was admitted at Middle Temple in 1669. In 1675, Erle married Elizabeth Wyndham (died 1710), daughter of Sir William Wyndham, 1st Baronet of Orchard Wyndham, Somerset. Erle succeeded his elder brother before 1665 and his grandfather to Charborough in 1665. In February 1679, Erle was returned unopposed as a Member of Parliament (MP) for Wareham (a pocket borough controlled by his family) into the first Exclusion Parliament. He voted for exclusion. At the second general election in 1679, Erle was again returned unopposed, but left no record in the second Exclusion Parliament. He was returned unopposed again at the 1681 English general election but was again inactive. At the 1685 English general election Erle was returned unopposed again, and was named to committees in Parliament but was called away in response to Monmouth's invasion. On 27 May 1685, he was made Deputy Lieutenant of Dorset. Erle took command of the East Dorset militia as major, and fought as a volunteer at the Battle of Sedgemoor with his friend Thomas Chafin. Subsequently, he was presented to the King by Lord Churchill but received a cold reception from James II. In 1686, Erle hosted a group of conspirators who met at Charborough House to plan the overthrow of \\"the tyrant race of Stuarts\\". This meeting lead to the Invitation to William, signed by the Immortal seven, and resulting in the Glorious Revolution. Erle was returned again as MP for Warham at the 1689 English general election. He was promoted to colonel of a foot regiment and on 8 March 1689 was sent to Ireland to fight the combined French and Irish Army of the deposed King James II of England. For the remainder of his political career he seems to have been a consistent Whig. At the 1690 English general election, Erle was returned as MP for Wareham in a contest. In July 1690, he took part in the Battle of the Boyne and the Siege of Limerick. He also took part in the concluding Battle of Aughrim in July 1691. Erle was infrequently in Parliament and his contributions were usually on military matters. In 1692, he was posted to Flanders and on 3 August 1692 was Colonel of the former Luttrell's Regiment at the Battle of Steenkerque. Henceforth, the regiment Erle raised in 1689 became the 2nd Battalion of the former Luttrell's Regiment, later the Green Howards. In Parliament he spoke against a motion to employ only English officers in the army and became involved in mutiny bills. In 1693, Erle was promoted to Brigadier-General, and was wounded in the Battle of Landen on 22 March 1693. Erle returned home and carried up the mutiny bill on 27 February 1694. He was appointed Governor of Portsmouth in July 1694, and held the position until 1712. He was returned unopposed for Warham at the 1695 English general election. Erle was again involved in the management of the mutiny bill, he signed the Association, and voted with the Court in March 1696 to fix the price of guineas at 22 shillings. In 1696, Erle was made a Major- General. He voted for the attainder of Sir John Fenwick on 25 November 1696 and spoke against a reduction of the military establishment on 8 January 1698. At the 1698 English general election, under a sharing agreement with a Tory, George Pitt, he had his nephew returned at Warham and was himself returned unopposed as MP for Portsmouth on the government interest. Erle was a Court supporter and spoke and voted against the third reading of the disbanding bill on 18 January 1699. In 1699, Erle lost one of his regiments and returned to Ireland as second in command to Lord Galway. He was appointed an Irish Privy Councillor. He was returned again as MP for Portsmouth in the two elections of 1701. However at the second election of that year, Erle was also returned as MP for Wareham and chose to sit there. He brought in the mutiny bill on 5 February 1702, and told against an amendment to it on 16 February. Erle was given leave to go to Ireland on 4 March 1702, having been appointed Commander- in-Chief of the land forces in Ireland under the Earl of Rochester. He was made a Lord Justice of Ireland and then promoted to Lieutenant-General. Erle stood again at Warham and Portsmouth at the 1702 English general election and chose to sit for Wareham again. In 1703, Erle became MP for Cork City in the Irish Parliament and held this seat until 1713. He was given command of a newly raised regiment of dragoons in June 1704 and did not vote for the Tack on 28 November 1704. In 1705, Erle was appointed Lieutenant-General of the Ordnance, a post which he held until 1712. He was also returned again as MP for Wareham at the 1705 English general election. Erle supported the Court choice of Speaker on 25 October 1705 and was named to the drafting committee on the mutiny bill on 23 January 1706. He voted with the government over the regency bill on 18 February 1706. Erle managed the mutiny bill through the House, and chaired the committee of the whole on 6 March 1706. In January 1707, Erle took part in an expedition to Spain, fighting in the Battle of Almanza on 23 April 1707 ‚Äî some reports state that he lost his right hand. and remained there until September. During the debate on the deficiency of English troops at Almanza, Erle defended Lord Galway, the commander, in the Commons on 24 February 1708. At the 1708 general election, he was returned for Wareham and Portsmouth and sat as Whig MP for Wareham. Erle was then told that he was to be commander-in-chief of an attack on the French coast. He was annoyed with the posting, especially as his pay had been stopped when he came back from Spain. Erle was awarded arrears of pay and given a further ¬£1,500 in consideration of his services. The expedition was late in starting and the plan to land at St Valery to capture Abbeville was abandoned. The force eventually landed at Ostend and set up an outpost at Leffingham, which fell to the French without a fight on 16 October 1708. In spite of the failure, when Erle returned home in December 1708, he was appointed commander-in-chief of land forces in England. He voted for the naturalization of the Palatines in 1709, and for the impeachment of Dr Sacheverell in 1710. Erle was returned at Wareham again in 1710 and 1713. In 1714, following the death of Queen Anne, Erle was appointed Lieutenant-General of the Ordnance for a second time. The same year, he was also made Governor of Portsmouth, replacing Lord North and Grey, whose loyalty to the new king was in doubt. Erle was returned as MP for Wareham at the 1715 general election. From 1715 until 1718 he was Father of the House. He was forced to resign all his posts and his seat in Parliament in March 1718 and received in return a pension of ¬£1,200 a year. Erle died on 23 July 1720 and was buried at Charborough. He left a daughter Frances, who married Edward Ernle and died on 14 May 1728. Charborough House thus passed to the Ernle family.

Vacancy  The seat had become vacant when the Labour Member of Parliament (MP) Lt-Col David Watts-Morgan had died on 23 February 1933, aged 65. He had held the seat since the constituency was created for the 1918 general election.  1931 general election  The previous contest was comfortably won by Labour; Watts-Morgan polled 68.1% of the vote in a two-way contest with the Communist, Arthur Horner. There was no candidate standing in support of the National Government.  Candidates  The Communist, Arthur Horner, was standing here for the third time. The new Labour candidate, William Mainwaring, a local miners agent, was contesting a parliamentary election for the first time. None of the leading Labour figures who had lost their seats at the last General Election expressed an interest in standing here. The Liberal Party, who had not contested this seat last time, fielded another first time candidate in Professor William D. Thomas. Thomas stood in opposition to the National Government. Still no candidate supporting the National Government was prepared to stand here. As a result, the election campaign remained an essentially local affair.  Votes   Aftermath  If the Communist Party was to re-gain a parliamentary foothold, its best prospects were always going to be in a seat like Rhondda East at a time when the Labour Party was demoralised. Despite having such ideal conditions, it could not make the breakthrough. William Mainwaring's victory started his parliamentary career which went on unbroken until 1959. Arthur Horner, despite having built a local electoral base for the Communist Party, was replaced as candidate for 1935 by the party's national leader, Harry Pollitt.

Born in Leipzig, Germany, he began his artistic career after graduating from the Leipzig Academy of Fine Arts, working for Dr. Carl Ludwig. Under Ludwig's instruction, Br√∂del gained a basic knowledge of medicine and became recognized for his detailed medical illustrations. In the late 1890s, he was brought to the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore to illustrate for Harvey Cushing, William Halsted, Howard Kelly, and other notable clinicians. In addition to being a prolific medical illustrator, he developed new artistic techniques such as the carbon dust technique that helped the advancement of the quality and accuracy of medical illustrations for physicians. In 1911, he presided over the creation of the first Department of Art as Applied to Medicine; located at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, it continues to train medical illustrators to this day. His graduates spread out across the world, and have founded a number of other academic programs.  Biography  = Early life and education = Max Br√∂del was born on June 8, 1870 in Leipzig, Germany, to Louis Br√∂del and Henrietta Frenzel Br√∂del. From the early age of 6, he took piano lessons and by 12, he was playing Beethoven. Not only was he musically inclined, he was also artistically inclined. At age 15, Br√∂del began to develop his artistic abilities at the Leipzig Academy of Fine Arts in a program for painting and drawing, where he learned artistic techniques reflecting the 19th-century arts education with an emphasis on the development of fine, precise drawings This meticulous attention to detail and accuracy was one of the skills that Br√∂del was later praised for in his medical illustrations. Over the summers, he put his artistic skills to use with part-time jobs drawing landscapes and figures. When Br√∂del was 18, Carl Ludwig, a famous physiologist of the 19th century, hired Br√∂del to draw a 150x magnified cortex of the brain. This was his first experience with medical illustrations, which he would make his lifelong career. = Personal life =  Marriage and family  Br√∂del was introduced to fellow artist, medical illustrator, and future wife, Ruth Huntington, by Dr. Howard Kelly. A graduate of zoology and botany from Smith College, Ruth also received Franklin P. Malls' invitation and had begun illustrating for Dr. Charles Bardeen as part of the Hopkins Anatomy Department in 1900. The pair realized their similar musical and artistic interests and married shortly afterwards on December 31, 1902. They had four children together: Elizabeth (born October 9, 1903), Ruth (born April 23, 1905), Carl (born June 7, 1908), and Elsa (born February 8, 1911). Ruth suffered from scarlet fever as a child and died on June 1, 1908. Elizabeth later followed her father's footsteps and became a medical illustrator for New York Hospital, and Carl became a geology professor at Johns Hopkins University. Known for his jovial, fun-loving personality, Br√∂del became close friends with H. L. Mencken, an American journalist and satirist. In 1913, he was invited to join the Saturday Night Club, a group of musicians and intellectuals that played music together, to share drinks. In his free time, he enjoyed hunting trips in the forests of Canada, fishing, and playing the piano. Outside of his profession, he also occasionally made drawings from nature.  Early career  Despite his minimal scientific background and lack of medical knowledge, Br√∂del and his artistic potential were well received by esteemed German physician and physiologist, Carl Ludwig. Under Ludwig's mentorship and guidance at the Anatomical Institute at the Institute of Physiology at the University of Leipzig, Br√∂del was employed with drawing detailed gross anatomical and histological diagrams. Honing his observational skills with detailed notes of the numerous surgeries and autopsies he observed, Br√∂del's work was credited for topographical accuracy, tissue realism, and attention to the cross-sectional anatomy. Another noticeable feature of his illustrations was the aerial perspective that showed the anatomy as seen through a surgeon's eyes. Some of his early illustrations were also for physicians Spalteholz, His and Braune. His network of medical professionals increased when he met Dr. Franklin P. Mall of Johns Hopkins Hospital in 1888. Br√∂del's artistic career was briefly suspended when he was drafted to serve two years on November 8, 1890. Through the auspices of Geheimrat Carl Ludwig, Prince George of Saxony, Br√∂del served his first year with arms, and the second year with artistic pursuits for the regiment. Upon return to Leipzig after his service, Br√∂del continued his work as a free-lance artist, specializing in anatomical and scientific illustrations. During this time, Br√∂del accepted Mall's invitation to illustrate at Johns Hopkins Hospital.  Career at Johns Hopkins University  Br√∂del arrived at Johns Hopkins in the winter of January 18, 1894. From here, Br√∂del had received internal acclaim through his employment by Howard Kelly as the illustrator for Operative Genecology. Highly sought after by anatomist Franklin P. Mall and other physicians for his meticulous attention to detail and realism in his medical illustrations, Br√∂del's skills were a valuable asset to the Johns Hopkins Hospital. Shortly after his employment, Br√∂del was joined by fellow medical illustrators, Hermann Becker and August Horn, both of whom had also attended the Leipzig Academy of Fine Arts. Working in conjunction with these two artists, Br√∂del created an extensive catalog of gross and histological diagrams for the medical staff, including Dr. Howard A. Kelly, Dr. William S. Halstead, and Dr. Thomas S. Cullen, who had proposed Br√∂del's training of students in medical illustration. = Work with Dr. Howard Kelly = The majority of Br√∂del's illustrations were for Dr. Howard A. Kelly, the Chief of Gynecology, during his employment at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Br√∂del illustrated for Kelly's two-volume textbook, Operative Gynecology, which was published in 1898. Its release garnered widespread praise and recognition, cemented Kelly's preeminent status in the field of gynecology, and established Br√∂del's role as a pioneering medical illustrator. Br√∂del then went on to work on other books authored or co-authored by Kelly, including those on diseases of the kidneys, ureters and bladder, as well as Kelly's journal articles and monographs. Throughout the illustrative process, Br√∂del worked closely with Kelly, conferring with each other before the first sketch was drawn. After debriefing, with Kelly, Br√∂del painstakingly conducted independent medical research and experimented to find the best method to communicate information about complex structures to medical professionals. For example, when Kelly asked for some anatomical data about the blood supply of the kidney, Br√∂del went to the Pathological Laboratories, got a kidney from the autopsies and washed it out by attaching it by a tube to the tap. Then, he filled the arteries with red paint, the veins with blue, and the ureter with yellow. Using the digesting method he had observed Frank Mall use in Carl Ludwig's laboratory in Germany, he could see various sections of the kidney that resembled a tree branch with small apples lining them, which were the glomeruli of the kidney. Br√∂del also noticed an avascular area and suggested cutting along this line when looking for kidney stones. He developed what is referred today as Br√∂del's suture, which can be used to repair a prolapsed kidney. Br√∂del's underlying artistic philosophy is best described in his own words: ‚ÄúThe artist must first fully comprehend the subject matter from every standpoint: anatomical, topographical, histological, pathological, medical, and surgical. From this accumulated knowledge grows a mental picture from which again crystallizes the plan for the future drawing. A clear and vivid mental picture must always precede the actual picture on paper. The planning of the picture, therefore, is the all important thing, not the execution.‚Äù He developed a technique where he examined every medical sample under a microscope at low, medium, and high (magnification of x40, 100, 400) power to form a complete picture of it in his mind. Just two months prior to his death, he wrote in a journal article that ‚Äúthe artist must know his subject so thoroughly that he can even shut his eyes and coax into existence a mental picture of great clarity.‚Äù His emphasis on anatomically accurate visualization prior to artistic actualization was manifested in his incredibly lifelike renderings. The seamless translation of medical knowledge into his illustrations is credited with his strong investigative drive. Br√∂del understood the essential role medical illustrations played in teaching medical students the complexities and functions of anatomical structures, and was therefore keen on educating himself by poring over medical texts, attending lectures, and dissecting cadavers. In a bulletin to Johns Hopkins, Br√∂del wrote \\"No drawing was made by me without original study through injection, dissection, frozen section, or reconstruction. Other medical fields he worked extensively in are Otolaryngology, Urology, and Neurosurgery. Illustration of the musculature of bladder and urethra by Br√∂del = Setbacks = On March 24, 1899, Br√∂del was diagnosed with a streptococcus infection on his hand and arm, caused by improper practice of handling anatomical dissections without gloves. He required several operations on his left arm, including one to separate nerve fibers from the scar tissue. These operations were performed by Dr. William S. Halsted, Chief of Surgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Capitalizing on this experience, Br√∂del illustrated and detailed his medical condition and the resulting numbness of his nondominant left hand. Despite encouragement by Halsted, these drawings remained unpublished. In December 1904, Br√∂del sustained severe injuries to the middle finger of his right hand. Another Johns Hopkins physician, Dr. John Miller Turpin Finney, was able to help recover normal functioning, allowing Br√∂del to continue his artistic and musical pursuits. = War years = With the onset of World War I, Br√∂del experienced alienation and disillusion living amongst anti-German sentiment in the United States along with his mother's declining health back in Germany. Henriette Br√∂del would end up dying November 2, 1915 and Max would become more introverted as the years went on, realizing he had overestimated the amount of importance and growth his medical illustration training program was to receive, expecting it to grow in stature in ways it never did. Br√∂del's program was to be plagued by low student enrollment during the war years and the persistent troubles of meager compensation in the profession of medical illustration, with two of his pupils turning down offers to work with Br√∂del's former colleague Harvey Cushing, now at Harvard Medical School, over the issue of salary. = Death = Br√∂del died on October 26, 1941 of pancreatic cancer in Baltimore, Maryland. Approximately two months before he died, he had published a paper in the Journal of the American Medical Association titled \\"Medical Illustration.\\" This provided a first-hand account and insight into his long illustrative career. A few months after his death, an intensive study of the human ear was published, in which two of the series of three drawings had been completed by Br√∂del and the third, being preliminary sketches at the time of his death, was later completed by P. D. Malone.  Legacy  = Carbon dust technique = Surgical anatomy pertaining to a thyroidectomy procedure demonstrating the carbon dust technique by Max Br√∂del Br√∂del is credited with the development of the carbon dust technique for medical and scientific illustrations. He had been looking for an acceptable medium able to show the vividness and detail characteristic of living tissue, and made the breakthrough using clay-surfaced lithographic transfer paper. Using a wide variety of media, realistic multi-dimensional representations of complex anatomical structures are able to be constructed. The dust is made by shaving carbon pencils against abrasive surfaces, and then applying this fine dust onto textured, calcium-coated paper with dry brushes. Increasing the depth and dimension of the image, the carbon dust technique was able to add highlights, shadows, and texture to Br√∂del's work. Due to the limitations of the black and white printing era, the relative ease of reprinting artwork created with carbon dust made this a highly suitable technique for a wide variety of scientific illustrations. Popularized in the 1900s, this method is applied with various different materials and techniques, but the same principles are still used today. This is because of its ability to capture a remarkable amount of fine visual detail, as well as a bridge allowing for close collaboration with physicians. = Department of Art as Applied to Medicine = In 1910, Br√∂del received an inviting offer for a position at the Mayo Clinic. Gynecologist and close friend of Br√∂del, Dr. Thomas S. Cullen, began raising funds for a department where Br√∂del could remain content at Johns Hopkins and train the next generation of medical illustrators with the necessary skills and background. Henry Walters, a Baltimore financier, philanthropist and art collector, agreed to fund the creation of this endeavor. In 1911, Br√∂del became the inaugural director for the Department of Art as Applied to Medicine at Johns Hopkins. His goal was to train medical illustrators to work in conjunction with physicians to increase understanding of how the body works. The program was the first medical illustration program, and attracted both medical and art students from all around the world. In an article published in the September 1911 edition of The Johns Hopkins Hospital Bulletin, Br√∂del laid out his case for the creation of the department. ‚ÄúIts purpose,‚Äù he wrote, ‚Äúis to bridge over the gap existing between art and medicine, and to train a new generation of artists to illustrate medical journals and books in the future and to spare them the years of trial and disappointment of their self-taught predecessors.‚ÄùJohns Hopkins Hospital. Bulletin of the Johns Hopkins Hospital. Baltimore: The Hospital, 1891. The Department of Art as Applied to Medicine is still recognized for their excellence in visual communication in science and medicine. Many former students at the Department of Art as Applied to Medicine would later make up a large percentage of the founding members of the Association of Medical Illustrators, which began in 1945. Several notable artists who were heavily influenced by Br√∂del include the following: * Elizabeth Br√∂del - She was one of Max Br√∂del's daughters who worked at the Woman's Clinic in the New York Hospital and later became the first elected Treasurer for the Association of Medical Illustrators. * James F. Didusch - He was the first student under Max Br√∂del from 1911-1913 and worked as the illustrator for the Carnegie Institute of Embryology at Johns Hopkins University until his death in 1955. * Dorcas Hager Padget - She was a self-taught artist who received training from Max Br√∂del before working for neurosurgeon Walter Dandy and eventually became a scientific researcher at the Department of Embryology at the Carnegie Institution of Washington and later at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. * Muriel McLatchie - She was another student of Max Br√∂del at Johns Hopkins University. In the early 1930s she went to Boston and later established a department of Medical Art at the Massachusetts General Hospital. McLatchie was also one of the founding members of the Association of Medical Illustrators. * Leon Schlossberg - After graduating from City College and studying Max Br√∂del's work at the Maryland Institute College of Art, he sought out mentorship from Max Br√∂del. From 1942 to 1946, he worked at the Bethesda Naval Hospital and then became a professor at the Johns Hopkins University teaching anatomical sketching for more than fifty years until his death in 1999. Institutions that have been influenced by Br√∂del's work in medical illustrations include the Wilmer, Brady, Mayo and Lahey clinics, the American Museum of Natural History, and Yale, Minnesota, Rochester, Toronto and Tulane Universities. = Notable textbooks = * Operative Gynecology (Vols.

The National Research and Education Network have been under discussion since 1987 and was proposed in 1969 as an experiment under the sponsorship of the United States Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), an agency of the Department of Defense. The NREN was officially established with the passage of the High Performance Computing Act signed into law by President Bush on December 9, 1991. *Purpose :The main purpose and fundamental emphasis is to maintain the United States leading place in high-performance or high-speed computing. The NREN is intended to be a gigabit network that is able to move one billion bits (binary digits) of data per second, or the equivalent of 30,000 pages of text. The intention was to connect a moderate number of diverse and geographically dispersed computers with the intention of acquiring experience in techniques for offering remote login access from one computer to another through a series of intermediate computers. The initial practical application, even though not originally planned, was the electronic mail. *Objectives ::1.Establish a gigabit network for the research and education community and foster its use. ::2.Develop advanced networking technologies and accelerate their development. ::3.Stimulate the availability, at a reasonable cost, of the required services from the private sector. ::4.Catalyze the rapid deployment of a high speed general purpose digital communications infrastructure for the nation. *Prototypes of the NREN ::1.ARPANET :::Founded in 1969 by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) of the Department of Defense. ::2.MILNET :::The military section of the ARPANET, turned into a separate network on 1983. ::3.BITNET :::An academic network founded in 1980. ::4.NSFNET :::The National Science Foundation Network, established in 1985, known as the domestic ‚Äúspinal column‚Äù of the Internet and often called the ‚Äúinterim NREN‚Äù.

The cape is situated between the ancient cities of Batroun and Tripoli. The promontory creates a massive barrier that cuts through the coast of Lebanon, making it impossible for travelers to circumvent. Today's modern, coastal highway runs through two tunnels. History During Antiquity, a road that ran parallel to the sea existed, which made it possible to circumvent Cape Lithoprosopon and to connect Batroun to Tripoli. Historians report that the earthquake of 551 A.D. caused a landslide, causing the road to sink into the sea permanently, and thus isolating Tripoli from Batroun and Byblos.Annals 48, 3, 2005+app1 The name of the cape changed throughout history. The oldest mention of the promontory appears in the writings of the Greek historian, Polybius who named it ‚ÄúTheou Prosopon‚Äù or ‚ÄúFace of God.‚Äù The Greek geographers, Ptolemy and Strabon, also mentioned it under the name of Theouprosopon. Pomponius, the Roman geographer, called it ‚ÄúPromontorium Euprosopon‚Äù or ‚ÄúCape of the Good Face.‚Äù The name, Lithoprosopon, did not come to usage until the time of the Byzantine Empire when the area was completely Christianized and the name of the cape was changed from ‚ÄúFace of God‚Äù, to Lithoprosopon or ‚ÄúFace of Stone.‚Äù Aramaic and Syriac historians translated it to ‚ÄúParsuph Kipa‚Äù and later on Arab historians translated it to ‚ÄúAnf Al-Hajar‚Äù and ‚ÄúWajh Al-Hajar\\" or ‚ÄúNose or Face of Stone.‚Äù The historians of the Crusades called it ‚ÄúPew of the Constable‚Äù and ‚ÄúMount of the General.‚Äù At the times of the Mamluks and Ottomans, the cape's named reverted to its Arabic name of ‚ÄúWajh Al-Hajar.‚Äù The French historian, Laurent d'Arvieux, wrote in 1660 that the Franks named it Cape Rouge, a corruption of the Lebanese Arabic word we≈æ, which means ‚Äúface.‚Äù Jean de La Roque, in 1688, gave the cape two additional names, Capo Pagro and Cappouge. Cappouge was probably a corruption of \\"Cap Rouge\\". Cappouge could also come from ‚ÄúCapo poggio‚Äù or ‚ÄúCape of the Hill or of the Monticule‚Äù, which matches the current name of the cape, R√¢s ech-Chaq'a', which means ‚ÄúCape of the Stone Monticule.‚Äù The stone monticule probably referred to the Greek Orthodox monastery of Our Lady of the Light that was built at that time.http://www.destinationlebanon.gov.lb/french/promenade/batrounhistory.asp Modern tourist attraction The cape today is home to several seaside resorts. It is also a popular Christian pilgrimage site where believers visit the shrine and monastery of Our Lady of Nourieh, located in the village of Hamat.

He was the last true ruler of Bodonitsa. Jacob was the eldest son of Francis Zorzi, of Venetian origin, and Euphrosyne Sommaripa, of the Cyclades. He succeeded his father around 1388 on the latter's death and under the regency of his mother. Soon before his death, Francis had ceased to pay annual tribute to the Duchy of Athens, though he remained a peer of the Principality of Achaea. In 1393‚Äì1394, however, the Ottoman sultan Bayezid I invaded northern Greece and conquered the County of Salona, another Crusader state dating back to the Fourth Crusade. Lamia and Neopatria were captured and Pharsala and Domokos were abandoned by the Serbs, whose leader was Jacob's brother-in-law. For whatever reason, surmises that it was the weather of February 1394, when Salona fell, that prevented Bayezid from attacking Bodonitsa, though it may have been the strength of her fortifications or perhaps the Venetian ties of her prince. Bodonitsa was spared and merely forced to pay annual tribute to the sultan. In 1403, 1408, and 1409, he was party to the treaties between Venice and the Ottoman prince S√ºleyman √áelebi and in the first of these succeeded in ridding himself of his obligations of payment of tribute. By a treaty of 1405 between Venice and Antonio I Acciaioli of Athens, he was included to secure his southern border and relieve him of worry there. He moved many peasants and livestock to Karystos, the Euboean stronghold of his brother Nicholas, in an attempt to protect them from Turkish assaults, but he was content enough himself to remain in Bodonitsa and even bid for Tenos and Mykonos, two islands which Venice was auctioning off in 1406. His bid failed. S√ºleyman √áelebi died in 1410 and his successor, Musa √áelebi, renewed the war on Bodonitsa almost immediately. In early spring, Bodonitsa was besieged, and Jacob resisted, for he \\"preferred, like the high- minded and true Christian that he was, to die rather than surrender the place.\\". From a Venetian document of his son's direction. Nevertheless, he was killed by traitors while \\"bravely defending the medieval Thermopylae against the new Persian invasion.\\" His sons, including his eldest and successor, Nicholas II, continued to hold the castle until Venice could send relief, but the relief was too late in coming and the citadel fell and Nicholas was captured.

The new flag would have eight stars instead of six, as in 2005, the Departmental Congress had modified the number of provinces from 6 to 8, and because the stars in the flag represented the Provinces, the flag needed to be changed to represent its original meaning.DECRETO 254 DE 2006 ‚ÄúPor el cual se modifica el art√≠culo 2¬∫ del Decreto 579 de 1972‚Äù Description The Flag of Santander has a complicated design, it is a fimbriated horizontal bicolour triband, with a red stripe in the hoist that has eight stars.

The Crest Girls' Academy was sponsored by E-ACT. The school was one of the first to gain a specialism in the specialist schools movement. Crest Girls had three specialisms: Technology (1998) Languages (2004) and Training Schools.

He is the son of Tony Campolo, and was a pastor before transitioning from Christianity to secular humanism. Campolo is the co-founder of Mission Year and the author of several books including Kingdom Works: True Stories of God and His People in Inner City America and Things We Wish We Had Said, which he co-wrote with his father. His most recent book, Why I Left, Why I Stayed, also co-written with his father, is a reflection on both men's \\"spiritual odysseys and how they evolved when their paths diverged.\\" Campolo is known for giving impassioned speeches to young people, particularly recruiting them to be more involved in their local urban areas. He was the first Humanist Chaplain at the University of Southern California. Campolo hosts a podcast called Humanize Me. Education Campolo attended Haverford College before completing a B.A. in Religious Studies from Brown University. Mission Year In 1999, Campolo and his wife, Marty, founded Mission Year, an urban Christian ministry program. It was born out of the merger of their first organization, Kingdomworks, and Campolo's father's Evangelical Association for the Promotion of Education. Mission Year currently serves Chicago, Houston, and Philadelphia. Members of the group \\"live, work, ... and build intentional relationships in marginalized neighborhoods\\" in order to spread their message and work toward improving the lives of the poor. Mission Year offers short term (week-long) as well as year- long commitments. Controversy over alleged heresy Bart Campolo sparked some controversy after publishing an article in The Journal of Student Ministries titled \\"The Limits of God's Grace\\". This article, which argues that God is not currently in control of the universe and will eventually utterly triumph over evil, was perceived as heretical by many in the evangelical community, most notably by Christianity Today, who drew comparisons between Campolo and Ivan Karamazov. Transition to Humanism Following a cycling accident during the summer of 2011, Campolo came to terms with his growing lack of belief. He has since announced that he no longer believes in God and has transitioned to secular humanism. Campolo decided that \\"He‚Äôd help [people] accept that we‚Äôre all going to die, that this life is all there is and that therefore we have to make the most of our brief, glorious time on earth.\\" Applying the tools of the trade that he refined during his Christian ministry, Campolo swapped his former beliefs for secular humanism and continued to help those in need. He became the first Humanist chaplain at the University of Southern California. In a 2014 motivational speech to students on campus, Campolo expounded on how to effectively persuade Christians and other religious people toward humanism as follows: \\"The question that we need to be asking is not, 'How do we prove that they're wrong?' but it's, 'How do we offer people the same values that all people want, but how do we offer those values, not supported by ancient myths or by supernatural fairytales, but how do we offer them love and goodness and purpose and mission, based on reason, based on common sense?'\\"  Conversations with Tony Campolo  Bart has engaged in an ongoing conversation with his famous evangelical father since he announced to him that he no longer believes in God. They have co-authored a book exploring the issues at the heart of this conversation, and a documentary film (Leaving My Father's Faith) was released in 2018 which features the conversations between them and tell the story of Bart's journey out of faith. Campolo lecture to the Atheist Community of San Jose Public speaking Campolo gave a talk at the first 5 Talent Academy teaching event in Richmond, VA, on October 1, 2009. During the talk, he related stories of people he has helped in Cincinnati, Ohio, and some personal revelations regarding his relationship with whom he was working. Campolo has also spoken at several atheist and secular events including Atheists United, Houston Oasis, Atheist Community of San Jose, Secular Student Alliance, and Sunday Assembly Los Angeles. Humanize Me! podcast Campolo is the host of the Humanize Me! podcast, first released on February 1, 2016.

After traversing the cities of Livermore and Pleasanton it joins South San Ramon Creek to become Arroyo de la Laguna, which in turn flows to Alameda Creek and thence to San Francisco Bay. History Arroyo Mocho means \\"cutoff creek\\". Erwin G. Gudde's California Place Names says it got the name because it historically had no outlet but dissipated into the ground after spreading out into many smaller streams between Livermore and Pleasanton. As early as 1852 it was also called Mocho Creek. Frank Latta, in his book on Joaquin Murrieta, says it got its name from the nickname of the man who ran the Murrietta gang's water stations and holding corrals in this area along La Vereda del Monte, the route of their drives of captured mustangs and stolen horses to the south. These stations were on the arroyo near Mud Springs and at Valle de Mocho, what is now known as Blackbird Valley, near the source of the arroyo, just south of Mount Mocho, which was also named for this man, known as \\"Mocho\\" (meaning lopped off or short) for his diminutive stature.Frank F.

It passes Sweet Springs, a magnesia spring known for its sweet taste. Although historically it sank into the area between Livermore and Pleasanton now the site of multiple gravel pits, there is an engineered channel connecting it to Arroyo de la Laguna.

It was a retrospective award for veterans of three campaigns which were fought in South Africa between 1880 and 1897. The medal was awarded to the officers, non-commissioned officers and men of the Colonial Forces who were engaged on active service during the campaigns in Basutoland (1880‚Äì1881), Tembuland and Griqualand East in Transkei (1880‚Äì1881), and Bechuanaland (1896‚Äì1897). Three campaign clasps were authorised at the same time.Alexander, E.G.M., Barron, G.K.B. and Bateman, A.J. (1986). South African Orders, Decorations and Medals. Human and Rousseau. Award criteria The medal was awarded, upon application, to all surviving veterans who had served in the Cape Colonial Forces in the three campaigns, for active service in the field, for serving as guards at any point where an attack was expected, or who were detailed for some specific or special military service or duty. No medal or clasp could be awarded to any member who had deserted or had been dismissed for misconduct. Because the award of the medal had to be applied for, it was not awarded posthumously. The next-of-kin of members who had been killed in action or who had died while on service therefore received no medal. The published medal roll shows that 5,252 medals were awarded to 5,156 individuals, which included 96 duplicate or triplicate awards.The Cape of Good Hope General Service Medal Roll, arranged alphabetically, compiled by Martin Wagner with the assistance of Neil Raaff (Retrieved 2015-01-26) Below are the number of medals recorded with each bar combination on the original issue register.

No British Army units were present at any of the campaigns, although fifteen British soldiers who had been seconded to local units received the medal. =Basuto Gun War= The duration of the Basutoland Campaign was from 13 September 1880 to 27 April 1881. Following the end of the Zulu wars from 1877 to 1879, Cape of Good Hope Governor Henry Bartle Frere and Prime Minister Gordon Sprigg attempted to disarm the Basotho and ordered them to hand in their firearms. Some chiefs reluctantly complied, but were almost immediately attacked by chiefs who had refused to comply, such as Lerothodi and Moletsane. In September 1880 they also attacked white administrators and, as a result, troops were mobilised and the Basuto Gun War broke out. Various encounters ensued until February 1881, when an armistice was arranged. Peace was eventually concluded in May 1881. Veterans of this campaign were awarded the Basutoland Clasp.North East Medals ‚Äì The Cape of Good Hope General Service Medal, 1880 ‚Äì 1897 (Retrieved 2015-01-26) A Collection of British battles illustrated through their campaign medals ‚Äì Cape of Good Hope General Service Medal 1880‚Äì97 (Retrieved 2015-01-26) =Transkei Campaign= The duration of the Transkei Campaign was from 13 September 1880 to 13 May 1881. The medal and the Transkei Clasp were awarded for operations in Thembuland and Griqualand East, where the native Xhosa populations were particularly hostile to settlers in the districts of Tsolo, Maclear, Matatiele and Qumbu. =Bechuanaland Campaign= The duration of the Bechuanaland Campaign was from 24 December 1896 to 30 July 1897. In April 1896, a severe outbreak of cattle disease occurred, which required that all cattle in the area needed to be slaughtered in an attempt to contain the disease. This was resented by the local Tswana population who, as a result, rose up in protest. A number of engagements occurred and, following a build-up of more Colonial reinforcements in July 1897, the conflict ended after a final action at Langberg on 30 July and 1 August 1897, in which most of the Tswana leaders were either killed or surrendered. Veterans of this campaign were awarded the Bechuanaland Clasp. Description The medal was struck in silver and is a disk, in diameter and thick at the raised rim. It is affixed to the swivelling suspender by means of claws and a pin through the upper edge of the medal. The recipient's rank, name and unit were inscribed on the rim, but the medals were not numbered. ;Obverse The obverse depicts the veiled bust of Queen Victoria, with the legend \\"VICTORIA REGINA ET IMPERATRIX\\" around the inside of the raised rim. The designer was Sir Joseph Boehm. ;Reverse The reverse displays the Cape of Good Hope coat of arms, with a spray of protea leaves and a protea flower underneath and the name \\"CAPE OF GOOD HOPE\\" on a wide raised rim around the top half of the medal. ;Ribbon The ribbon is wide and dark blue, with a wide yellow centre band. These were also the ribbon colours of the two earlier campaign medals for service in southern Africa. ;Clasps The three clasps which were awarded to indicate the campaigns in which recipients had served, were inscribed \\"BASUTOLAND\\", \\"TRANSKEI\\" and \\"BECHUANALAND\\" respectively.

Until 1947 the town was the seat of the Rokitno Szlacheckie municipality. In the years 1975‚Äì1998 the town administratively belonged to the Katowice province. As of 2019, the town has 6,811 inhabitants. During World War II, German occupiers changed the name to Lazy then to Lasern without a legislative decree. ≈Åazy belongs to the province of Lesser Poland, and since its foundation until the Partitions of Poland, it was part of Krakow Voivodeship. History In the Middle Ages, in the area of today's ≈Åazy were five settlements: Grabowa, Niegowonice, Wiesiolka, Wysoka and Ciagowice. Another village, which today is located within boundaries of ≈Åazy, Chruszczobrod, belonged to the Duchy of Siewierz, which was incorporated into the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1790. In the year 1386, King Wladyslaw Jagiello granted the villages of Niegowonice, Wiesiolka, Wysoka, Grabowa and Rokitno Szlacheckie to Wlodek of Charbinowice, the starosta of Lublin and czesnik of Krak√≥w. Until 1795, Grabowa, Hutki Kanki and Niegowoniczki belonged to Lelow County, while Niegowonice, Wiesi√≥‚àèka,Wysoka, Ciagowice, Rokitno Szlacheckie and Turza were part of Krak√≥w County. During the Swedish invasion of Poland, the area of today's ≈Åazy witnessed heavy fighting and destruction. Stanislaw Warszycki, owner of the so-called Ogrodzieniec Properties, fought Swedish invaders. As a result, the Ogrodzieniec Castle was destroyed, together with numerous villages, such as Grabowa, with its fortified stronghold on the Lesser Poland ‚Äì Silesian border. After the Third Partition of Poland (1795), the boundary between the Kingdom of Prussia and the Habsburg Empire was established on the upper Pilica river. The area of ≈Åazy was seized by Prussia, as part of the province of New Silesia. In 1807, after the Treaties of Tilsit, it was annexed by the Duchy of Warsaw, which in 1815 became Russian-controlled Congress Poland, and remained part of Russian Empire until World War I. The village of ≈Åazy for the first time appeared on maps in ca. 1790. It remained a small settlement, located next to the much larger village of Rokitno Szlacheckie. ≈Åazy owes its development to the construction of the Warsaw‚ÄìVienna railway (completed in 1848). During the January Uprising, a skirmish between Polish rebels and Russian troops took place near Lazy on March 22, 1863. Until 1927, ≈Åazy belonged to the gmina of Rokitno Szlacheckie, Bedzin County. In the Second Polish Republic, it was originally part of Kielce Voivodeship, and on January 1, 1927, the gmina of Rokitno Szlacheckie was transferred to Zawiercie County. The village of Lazy was captured by the Wehrmacht in early September 1939, and remained in German hands until January 20, 1945. After the war, the government of People's Republic of Poland transferred ≈Åazy to Katowice Voivodeship, creating the gmina of ≈Åazy in late 1945. In Communist Poland, ≈Åazy was a local center of industry, with Cement Works Wysoka, Pottery Plant, and large cargo depot of Polish State Railways. In the late 1940s, houses of culture, cinemas and libraries were opened in the gmina of ≈Åazy. The village went through the period of quick development in the 1960s, when waterworks and electrification program were completed. Finally, on January 1, 1967, ≈Åazy received town charter. War cemetery The War Cemetery was founded during 1914‚Äì1918. There are graves of Austrian and German soldiers who fought in World War I.

It was authorised in 1907 for service in Natal during a Zulu revolt against British rule and taxation in 1906. The 1906 Clasp to the medal was awarded to those who had served for more than fifty days.Alexander, E.G.M., Barron, G.K.B. and Bateman, A.J. (1986). South African Orders, Decorations and Medals. Human and Rousseau.Mitchell, F.K. (1965). The Natal Native Rebellion 1906 War Medal in South African Numismatic Journal, April 1965.South African Medal Website - Colonial Military Forces (Accessed 6 May 2015) The Bambatha Rebellion In the years following the Second Boer War, British employers in Natal found it difficult to recruit sufficient Zulu farm workers because of increased competition from the gold mines on the Witwatersrand. To coerce more Zulu men to enter the labour market, the Natal Colonial government introduced a ¬£1 head tax, in addition to the existing hut tax. The revolt, led by Chief Bambatha kaMancinza, leader of the amaZondi clan of the Zulu people who lived in the Mpanza Valley, a district near Greytown, was sparked in February 1906, when two British tax collectors were killed near Richmond. Martial law was declared and Bambatha embarked on a series of guerrilla attacks, using the Nkandla forest as a base. The revolt continued until colonial troops managed to surround the rebels at Mome Gorge. Between 3,000 and 4,000 Zulus were killed during the revolt, some of whom died fighting on the side of the Natal government. More than 7,000 were imprisoned, and 4,000 flogged. King Dinuzulu kaCetshwayo, who gave tacit support to Bambatha, was arrested and sentenced to four years imprisonment for treason. Institution The Natal Native Rebellion Medal and the 1906 Clasp to the medal were authorised by King Edward VII on 9 May 1907, as a campaign medal to be issued by the Natal Government for service during the Bambatha Rebellion in Natal in 1906. Award criteria To qualify for the medal, a soldier or policeman had to have served in the field for at least twenty days between 11 February 1906 and 3 August 1906. Those who had served for fifty days or longer qualified for the award of the 1906 Clasp to the medal. Altogether 9,979 medals were awarded, 8,045 with the clasp and 1,934 without the clasp. Most of the recipients were members of the Natal colonial military and police forces, while 546 medals were awarded to volunteers from the Transvaal Colony and 70 medals to troops from the Cape of Good Hope. Twenty members of the Indian Stretcher Bearer Corps received the medal without clasp, including Mahatma Gandhi who helped raise the Corps and who acted as its sergeant major. No British Army units were involved in the campaign or received the medal. Description The medal was designed and manufactured by the Goldsmiths and Silversmiths Company of London, having been commissioned by the Natal Government. It was struck in silver and is a disk, in diameter. ;Obverse The obverse depicts the uncrowned head of King Edward VII facing right, surrounded by the legend \\"EDWARDVS VII REX IMPERATOR\\" around the perimeter. ;Reverse The reverse displays the figures of Britannia and Natalia, holding a large sword and standing on a heap of native weapons, against a background of a landscape with a group of Zulu men and huts with a sunrise behind.

He was born in Hawick in the Scottish borders, and made his debut (at the age of 22) against in 1978 when Scotland lost, 16 - 19. He was active on the national team between 1978, and 1987, with his high point being in Scotland's 1984 Grand Slam. Richard Bath writes of him that he was :\\"The prototype for the faster hooker, acting as an extra flanker that has since emerged, Deans has few equals. Superb in the loose and a wonderfully quick striker of the ball in the scrum, the rugged Deans was also a pinpoint line-out thrower.\\" Allan Massie describes him as a hooker with back-row skills: :\\"He is the most remarkable loose forward of any hooker I have seen. There can have been few, if any, faster; indeed, his speed is such that from the broken play and the line-out he gives Scotland in effect a fourth back-row forward. This means that, like Carmichael, he is ideal for the modern game, capable of fulfilling his specialist role, but also of taking a full part in fifteen-man Rugby. He harries the defence tirelessly: in the great win at Cardiff in 1982 Deans had a big part in the build-up for two of the Scottish tries; he was also at Calder's shoulder to take a pass, had that been necessary, when the first try was scored.\\"Massie, p172-3 He also says that Deans was, \\"with the possible exception of Peter Wheeler, the most accurate thrower-in of recent years.\\"Massie, p173 Deans was selected for the 1983 British Lions tour to New Zealand, but despite playing well was surprisingly kept on the bench for the entirety of the 4 test matches.

The University of Hawaii Press was founded in 1947, publishing research in all disciplines of the humanities and natural and social sciences in the regions of Asia and the Pacific. In addition to scholarly monographs, the Press publishes educational materials and reference works such as dictionaries, language texts, classroom readers, atlases, and encyclopedias. History The Press was established in 1947 at the initiative of University of Hawaii President Gregg M. Sinclair. Its first publications included a reprint of The Hawaiian Kingdom by Ralph Kuykendall and Insects of Hawaii, by Elwood C. Zimmerman, both of which have become classics. Other enduring classics from its early years include the Hawaiian-English Dictionary, by Mary Kawena Pukui and Samuel Elbert, first published in 1957, last revised and enlarged in 1986, then reprinted 16 times; and Shoal of Time: A History of the Hawaiian Islands, by Gavan Daws, whose Press edition was first published in 1974 and reprinted 19 times. In 1971, the University of Hawaii Press combined operations with the East-West Center Press and renamed itself the University Press of Hawaii, thus adding greater coverage of Asia to its previous strength in Hawaii and the Pacific. In 1981, the East-West Center withdrew its subsidy, and the name reverted to University of Hawaii Press, but the focus on Asia continued to grow, so that at least half its titles now focus on Asia, with the other half devoted to Hawaii (30%) and the Pacific (20%). UH Press output included journals from the very beginning. Most of the Press's inaugural budget appropriation was allocated to the journal Pacific Science, whose first issue appeared in 1947. However, Pacific Science did not bear the UH Press imprint until 1953, two years after Philosophy East and West made its debut from UH Press (Kamins & Potter 1998:234-240). The number of journals gradually expanded over the next few decades, with the acquisition of Oceanic Linguistics (in vol. V) in 1966 and Asian Perspectives (in vol. XII) in 1969, and the founding of Korean Studies in 1977, Biography in 1978, Buddhist-Christian Studies in 1981, and Asian Theatre Journal in 1984, all initiated at the University of Hawaii. Flush State budgets in the late 1980s and early 1990s permitted several further initiatives by other campus departments. The literary journal MƒÅnoa and the \\"island affairs\\" journal The Contemporary Pacific made their debut in 1989, followed by the Journal of World History in 1990, and then China Review International in 1994, just before severe budget cutbacks eliminated all university subsidies to the Journals Department. Journals production struggled along, with some editorial offices assuming more of the burden, until Press subsidies were partially restored in 1998 and the department was restaffed. All 12 journals made their debut in the Project MUSE database of journals in the humanities and social sciences in 2000-2001, but Pacific Science switched to the BioOne collection of natural science journals in 2008. The Yearbook of the Association of Pacific Coast Geographers began publishing with UH Press in 2000 (in vol. 62) and made its debut in Project MUSE in 2004. The Asia Society's Archives of Asian Art began publishing with UH Press in 2007 (in vol. 57). Book Editorial Program During the 2007 fiscal year, the Press considered approximately 1,300 manuscripts and proposals, of which 60 were accepted for publication by the Editorial Board. As of 30 June 2007, 122 books were in press. Each book undergoes rigorous review, including preliminary evaluation by an in-house editor. Manuscripts that show promise are then evaluated by two external readers who are specialists in the subject matter. Those that receive two positive peer reviews are presented to the Press's academic editorial board, which makes the final determination about whether to publish. East Asia is an especially important regional focus. During 2000-2005, the Press published 184 academic monographs on the region, 82 on China, 81 on Japan, and 21 on Korea. The three principal subject areas were language and literature (with 23 on China, 25 on Japan, and 7 on Korea); religion and philosophy (with 21 on China, 13 on Japan, and 2 on Korea); and history and fine arts (with 20 on China, 20 on Japan, and 7 on Korea) (Chen & Wang 2008:38).

It was a retrospective award for distinguished and especially meritorious service by Boer veteran officers during the Second Boer War between 11 October 1899 and 31 May 1902. Since neither of the two Boer Republics, the South African Republic (Transvaal) and the Orange Free State, had official honours systems of their own, the decoration was created to afford Boer veteran officers who were serving as members of the Union Defence Forces parity with their fellow South Africans who had fought on the British side in the war. During the Second Boer War, Republican commanders were instructed to record the names of members of their forces who distinguished themselves in the field. The names were to be sent to the War Council for confirmation and publication in the Staats Courant (Government Gazette) with the intention to award a medal after conclusion of hostilities. Since the Republican forces were defeated, however, the intended medal never became a reality. The Union Defence Forces (UDF) were established in 1912. In 1913, Colonel Skinner, Commandant of the Military School in Bloemfontein, remarked on the fact that some of the officers attending a course, who had fought valiantly in the Republican Forces, were without medal ribbons whilst their brother officers, who had served on the British side, were all well decorated. Colonel Skinner made representations to Defence Headquarters to have this omission rectified but, due to the outbreak of the First World War, nothing was done about the matter until 1920, when the Dekoratie voor Trouwe Dienst, the Medalje voor de Anglo-Boere Oorlog and the Lint voor Verwonding were instituted by King George V. Award criteria The Dekoratie voor Trouwe Dienst could be awarded to officers of the military forces of the South African Republic and the Orange Free State whose service during the Second Boer War of 1899 to 1902 had been of such a distinguished and meritorious nature that, in the opinion of the Minister of Defence, they deserved special recognition. Recipients had to be serving members of the Union Defence Forces, or available to be called up for service in terms of the South African Defence Act of 1912. The gazetted regulations, in effect, actually excluded many men who had fought on the Boer side, such as the members of the various foreign units and potentially also the Natal and Cape rebels. Order of wear Even though the Dekoratie voor Trouwe Dienst was instituted on behalf of King George V by His Royal Highness, the Governor General of the Union of South Africa, the decoration was never listed in the order of wear prescribed by the British Central Chancery of the Orders of Knighthood. =South Africa= Example of DTD and DSO South African order of wear, illustrated by the medal group of Major C.W. Cloete. The medals depicted are: In the South African order of wear, however, the Dekoratie voor Trouwe Dienst took precedence in wearing and officially ranked above the British Distinguished Service Order. With effect from 6 April 1952, when a new South African set of decorations and medals was instituted to replace the British awards used to date, the older awards continued to be worn in the same order of precedence but, with the exception of the Victoria Cross, took precedence after all South African orders, decorations and medals awarded to South Africans on or after that date.Republic of South Africa Government Gazette Vol. 477, no. 27376, Pretoria, 11 March 2005, The official South African order of wear was revised in 1994 to include the military decorations and medals of the defence forces of the Republics of Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda and Ciskei which were integrated with the South African Defence Force (SADF) into the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) on 27 April 1994.South African Medal Website - South African National Defence Force (Accessed 1 May 2015) ;South African Defence Force until 26 April 1994: National Cadet Bisley Grand Champion Medal Dekoratie voor Trouwe Dienst Distinguished Service Order *Official SADF order of precedence: ** Preceded by the National Cadet Bisley Grand Champion Medal.Republic of South Africa Government Gazette no. 15093, Pretoria, 3 September 1993 ** Succeeded by the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) of the United Kingdom.Government Notice no. 1982 of 1 October 1954 - Order of Precedence of Orders, Decorations and Medals, published in the Government Gazette of 1 October 1954. *Official national order of precedence: ** Preceded by the George Cross (GC) of the United Kingdom. ** Succeeded by the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) of the United Kingdom. ;South African National Defence Force from 27 April 1994: State President's Medal for Shooting Dekoratie voor Trouwe Dienst Distinguished Service Order *Official SANDF order of precedence: ** Preceded by the State President's Medal for Shooting of the Republic of Bophuthatswana. ** Succeeded by the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) of the United Kingdom. *Official national order of precedence: ** Preceded by the George Cross (GC) of the United Kingdom. ** Succeeded by the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) of the United Kingdom. The position of the Dekoratie voor Trouwe Dienst in the official order of wear remained unchanged in April 1996, when decorations and medals were belatedly instituted for the two former non-statutory forces, the Azanian People's Liberation Army and Umkhonto we Sizwe, and again upon the institution of a new set of awards on 27 April 2003. Description The decoration was struck in silver and is a disk, in diameter and thick at the raised rim. It is affixed to a fixed bar suspender by means of claws and a pin through the upper edge of the medal. The rank and name of the recipient are impressed on the rim. ;Equal sides Neither side of the decoration is considered as the reverse. Both sides depict an encircled coat of arms on a cross patt√©e, encircled around the perimeter by the words \\"VOOR TROUWE DIENST\\" above and the years \\"1899 ‚Ä¢ 1902\\" below. One side has the coat of arms of the South African Republic in the centre of the cross and the other side has that of the Orange Free State. This enabled each recipient to wear the medal so as to display the coat of arms of the state under whose flag he had fought. ;Ribbon The ribbon is wide and in the combined colours of the two former Republics. While these colours were gazetted as red, green, white, blue and orange, the orange appears as yellow on the actual ribbons. As worn by a South African Republic veteran, it has a 12 millimetres wide blue band in the centre, edged by a 3 millimetres wide red and a 7 millimetres wide green bands on the left and a 7 millimetres wide orange and a 3 millimetres wide white bands on the right. An Orange Free State veteran would wear the ribbon reversed, with the white band at left. Recipients Altogether 655 decorations were awarded between 1921 and 1946, all but one to officers. The sole exception was the award to Burgher A. Kuit, who was awarded the decoration for his service whilst occupying the position of Inspekteur van Veldpos (Inspector of Field Post). A complete list of recipients of the Dekoratie voor Trouwe Dienst was published in the Military History Journals of the South African Military History Society, Volume 1, Numbers 1 and 2, in December 1967 and June 1968 respectively. Discontinuation The original closing date for applications was 30 June 1921, but this was not strictly adhered to. Award of the decoration was discontinued on 31 December 1946 and the last decoration was dispatched on 22 January 1947, to Kaptein M. C. Avis of General Smuts' Commando.

It was a retrospective campaign medal for Boer veteran officers and men, who served in the combat forces of the South African Republic and the Orange Free State during the Second Boer War between 11 October 1899 and 31 May 1902 and who remained in service of the Republican forces until 31 May 1902, without surrendering or taking either parole or the oath of allegiance prior to 31 May 1902.The Soldier's Burden ‚Äì The Anglo Boer War 1899‚Äì1902 ‚Äì Medals to men and woman on the Boer side, by Henk Loots (Retrieved 2015-01-29) Since neither of the two Boer Republics, the South African Republic (Transvaal) and the Orange Free State, had official honours systems of their own, the medal was created to afford Boer veteran officers and men, who were serving as members of the Union Defence Forces, parity with their fellow South Africans who had fought on the British side in the war. Notices did appear in the Transvaal Government Gazette in May 1900 about the eventual issue of a decoration for bravery for Republican soldiers, but as a result of the eventual British victory, this did not materialise.

However, even though the Republican awards for the Anglo-Boer War, the Dekoratie voor Trouwe Dienst and the two campaign awards, the Medalje voor de Anglo-Boere Oorlog and the Lint voor Verwonding, were instituted on behalf of King George V by His Royal Highness, the Governor General of the Union of South Africa, the Dekoratie voor Trouwe Dienst is not listed in the British order of wear and the two campaign awards would therefore most likely also have been excluded. =South Africa= In the South African order of wear, the Medalje voor de Anglo-Boere Oorlog took precedence in wearing after the Queen's South Africa Medal and before the Lint voor Verwonding, which has the status of a campaign medal even though it has no accompanying medal.The Soldier's Burden ‚Äì The DTD, ABO and LvW ‚Äì Awards to the Boer Side: Anglo Boer War 1899‚Äì1902, by Henk Loots (Retrieved 2015-01-29) With effect from 6 April 1952, when a new South African set of decorations and medals was instituted to replace the British awards used to date, the older British decorations and medals applicable to South Africa continued to be worn in the same order of precedence but, with the exception of the Victoria Cross, took precedence after all South African orders, decorations and medals awarded to South Africans on or after that date.

Description The medal was struck in silver and is a disk, in diameter and thick at the raised rim. It is affixed to a fixed bar suspender by means of claws and a pin through the upper edge of the medal. The rank, initials and surname of the recipient is impressed in block capitals on the rim. ;Equal sides Neither side of the medal is considered as the reverse. Both sides depict an ornamental frame, encircled around the perimeter by the words \\"ANGLO-BOERE OORLOG\\" above and the years \\"1899 ‚Ä¢ 1902\\" below. One side has the Coat of Arms of the South African Republic in the centre of the frame and the other side has that of the Orange Free State. This enabled each recipient to wear the medal so as to display the coat of arms of the state under whose flag he had fought. ;Ribbon The ribbon is wide and in the combined colours of the two former Republics. While these colours were gazetted as red, green, white, blue and orange, the orange appears as yellow on the actual ribbons. As worn by a South African Republic veteran, it has an 11¬Ω millimetres wide green band, a 3 millimetres wide red band, a 3 millimetres wide white band, a 3 millimetres wide blue band and an 11¬Ω millimetres wide orange band. An Orange Free State veteran would wear the ribbon and medal reversed, with the orange (yellow) band to the left. Recipients The gazetted regulations, which stipulated actual service until 31 May 1902, excluded many men who had fought on the Boer side, such as the members of the various foreign units and potentially also the Natal and Cape rebels. Many early applications from overseas volunteers were unsuccessful, since the members were not actually in the field at the end of the war. The first medal was awarded on 28 October 1921. In later years, these rules were interpreted more loosely and the eventual requirement for the award of the medal, was proof that the applicant had fought against the British without surrendering or taking either parole or the oath of allegiance prior to 31 May 1902. This resulted in medal awards to those previously excluded men. While nearly one hundred thousand Burghers took up arms in the Republican Forces during the war, a relatively small percentage of those who had served were awarded the medal, probably due to the period of almost twenty years which had elapsed between the end of the war and the institution of the medal, as well as the fact that the medal had to be applied for. Only approximately 13,800 medals were awarded. Of the medals which were eventually awarded to members of the various foreign units who fought on the Boer side, at least ninety went to members of the Hollander Corps, about forty to members of the Scandinavian Corps, more than twenty to the German Commando, ten to the Foreign Legion under General de Villebois-Mareuil and five to the Irish Brigade. Nineteen medals were awarded to women, of which two were school teachers who had served as voluntary nurses, while the rest were trained nurses. Discontinuation The original closing date for applications was 30 June 1921, but this was not strictly adhered to. The last batch of twelve of the Medalje voor de Anglo-Boere Oorlog was awarded in 1982, eighty years after the end of the war. One of these was awarded to Burgher Herman Carel Lubbe, who joined the Fauresmith Commando under Commandant Charles Nieuwoudt at the age of twelve years when his mother was taken to the concentration camp in Kimberley. It was presented to him on 24 January 1983 in his hometown of Carolina by Major General Neil Webster, Chairman of the Council of Military Veterans Organisations.

Meyer of the ZAR forces Later version of the certificate of the Lint voor Verwonding, awarded to Burger W. Kool of the ZAR forces The Lint voor Verwonding was issued with a printed certificate. The initial version was a plain undecorated certificate, filled out by hand, showing the rank and name of the recipient and the Republican Force with which he had served. It also included the recipient's file number at top left of the document. The later type of certificate was decorated with a full colour reproduction of the riband. The Republican Force with which the recipient had served was pre-printed on this version, but it did not make provision for the recipient's file number. The riband is wide and in the combined colours of the two former Republics. While these colours were gazetted as red, green, white, blue and orange, the orange appears as yellow on the actual ribbons and was also printed as yellow on the second version of the certificate.

The term wasn't used officially, but was coined because the persons were deemed (gelten in German) Jews rather than exactly belonging to any of the categories of the previous Nuremberg Laws. There were three categories of Geltungsjuden: 1. offspring of an intermarriage who belonged to the Jewish community after 1935; 2. offspring of an intermarriage who was married to a Jew after 1935; 3. illegitimate child of a Geltungsjude, born after 1935. Definition The definition of these persons in the decree is as follows: :ARTICLE 5 (2) A Jew is also an individual [j√ºdischer Mischling] who is descended from two full- Jewish grandparents if: ::(a) he was a member of the Jewish religious community when this law was issued, or joined the community later; ::(b) when the law was issued, he was married to a person who was a Jew, or was subsequently married to a Jew; ::(c) he is the issue from a marriage with a Jew, in the sense of Section I, which was contracted after the coming into effect of the Law for the Protection of German Blood and Honor of 15 September 1935; ::(d) he is the issue of an extramarital relationship with a Jew, in the sense of Section I, and was born out of wedlock after 31 July 1936. Each of these is considered a Jew, hence the name Geltungsjude. The term j√ºdischer Mischling in the first sentence means Jewish half-breed. A person with two Jewish grandparents who satisfied none of the criteria (a) through (d) was not considered a \\"Geltungsjude\\" but a Mischling of the First Degree. (See also the article on the Mischling test.) Consequences Geltungsjuden were not citizens of the Reich anymore and did not have the right to vote. They were also prohibited to marry a quarter Jew. In the Protectorate, they were routinely deported. They were sometimes deported from the \\"Old Reich\\" (Altreich), and only very rarely from Austria. In contrast, while Mischlinge of the First Degree within the Old Reich were subject to various forms of discrimination, they were at least in principle exempt from deportation. Their status as \\"provisional citizens\\" was subject of an intra-regime tug-of-war between maximalists like Heydrich (who wanted them treated like Jews) and minimalists who pleaded against \\"throwing out the Aryan with the Jewish blood\\" (such as Wilhelm Stuckart and his assistant Hans Globke).

Plot In a long corridor of an underground bunker, several prisoners are marching under armed guard. As they approach the door at the end of the corridor, one prisoner seizes his chance to assault a guard, but the door opens almost immediately and several German soldiers step through to mow down the entire group, save for one prisoner who remains standing. The guards grab him and force him through the door, where he is placed on an operating table and held down as a drip is inserted into his arm and blood pumped into his veins. He stops moving for a short time before his eyes blink open revealing his irises have become zombified-white. Some time later, supposedly in 1941, so presumably during the Continuation War, American Captain Martin Stone (Tiernan) is leading a finely- trained, elite platoon of American and Finnish soldiers along with a cameraman and his son as they are sent to attack the bunker, with no knowledge of its secrets. Underestimating their enemy's strength, they are quickly beaten back into the forest. As they try to regroup, they spy a soldier sloping towards them. Identifying him as a threat, they open fire, but as they investigate his corpse it is revealed the soldier is one of their own dead from the previous encounter, and as he springs to life a second time a number of zombies leap into action from their hiding places in the trees to further destroy the unit. Forced to flee the battle to survive, Stone along with Finns Captain Niemi (Ahola) and Lieutenant Laakso (Leppilampi) as well as the cameraman's son (Wilson) take refuge in a trench, where they encounter lone Russian soldier Kolya (Vauramo), who seems aware of the zombie presence and leads them to a house where they can shelter. They are rapidly split up and attacked, however, with Niemi being bitten and then killing the young cameraman before being gunned down by Laakso. Meanwhile, Stone finds a car in the garage before being saved by Kolya, who shows impressive hand-to-hand combat skills. As the three survivors drive into the forest, they are attacked again by Niemi, but manage to escape him relatively easily. Stopping at another cabin, the three survivors bicker about whether to confront the supernatural threat or leave it behind, before they find Kolya's ex-girlfriend Dasha (Gorska). The four then proceed on to the bunker, where Kolya insists they can find a radio to call for help. Entering the facility, they are again split up - as Kolya finds Dasha mortally wounded, having to shoot her in the head to prevent her from turning, Laakso and Stone find the living remnants of the German garrison. As Stone stays behind to cover Laakso, the Finn is reunited with Kolya and the two find the radio room, where they call headquarters to call in an airstrike to take the bunker out for good. Niemi appears again at the bunker and engages in a fist-fight with Stone, while the radio room is overrun by zombies and Laakso and Kolya are forced to flee. As they near the exit to the surface, Kolya is grabbed by a zombie and falls to his death, with Laakso forced to leave him as he races topside to set the signal flares for the incoming fighter-bombers. Narrowly escaping the bombs, Laakso meets up with Stone again as they surrender to the incoming Russian battalion which has been called to investigate the site, knowing their job is done.

It was originally titled Stone's War, starring James Van Der Beek. Production occurred in Lithuania, at a cost of ‚Ç¨1.3 million (US$1.8 million), making it the most expensive film ever made in Lithuania. Release The world premiere was at the Toronto After Dark Film Festival on 22 October 2011.War Of The Dead, 2011 Program, Toronto After Dark Film Festival. Reception In a mostly negative review, Variety called it one- dimensional and unmemorable, though predicted healthy sales on home video. On the other hand, Fangoria praised the film highly, calling it \\"an extremely impressive debut\\", with a final rating of 3 out of 4 stars. Historical errors The initial scene is set in 1939, presumably during the Russo-Finnish War. What Nazi scientists are doing helping the Finns is not explained. The bulk of the film is set in 1941, presumably between the start of the Continuation War and Pearl Harbor. How neutral US troops in US uniforms can be serving with the Finns is never explained. The classic US M-1 steel helmets are too late for 1941. The American Captain wears a Vietnam War era Enlisted uniform jacket under his trench coat. The same Captain also wears odd Captain rank bars on a patch on his arm, when Officer rank is meant to be warn on the collar or shoulders. The nature of the border in the area where the film is set, though mentioned, is never adequately explained. The German experimental bunker is described as a Soviet bunker but is full of Nazis, undead and otherwise. It is said to be behind \\"enemy lines\\", but things are so confused by this stage that it is unclear which enemy is meant. The air strike at the end is presumably meant to be Finnish. It is hard to imagine that it is American, and a Soviet radio communication after it is ordered makes it clear it is not Soviet. Yet the aircraft resemble Soviet Polikarpov I-16 fighters. They are also clearly not bombers capable of destroying a vast bunker complex.

He obtained his Bachelor of Technology degree in Mechanical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras in 1977 and MS and PhD (Nuclear Engineering and Science) degrees from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in 1978 and 1982 respectively. He also holds an MBA (Business Administration) from RPI. He was judged guilty of research misconduct for \\"falsification of the research record\\" by a Purdue review board in July, 2008.Purdue physicist found guilty of misconduct, Los Angeles Times, July 19, 2008, Thomas H.

Microphone 7. Photomultiplier tube 8. Two deuterium atoms collide 8a. Possible fusion event creating Helium and a neutron 8b. Possible fusion event creating Tritium and a protonIn 2002, while a senior scientist at ORNL, Taleyarkhan published a paper on fusion achieved by bombarding a container of liquid solvent with strong ultrasonic vibrations, a process known as sonofusion or bubble fusion. In theory, the vibrations collapsed gas bubbles in the solvent, heating them to temperatures high enough to fuse hydrogen atoms and release energy. Following his move from Oak Ridge to Purdue in 2003, Taleyarkhan published additional papers about his research in this area. Numerous other scientists, however, were not able to replicate Taleyarkhan's work, including in published articles in Physical Review Letters from the University of G√∂ttingen, from UCLA, from University of Illinois, from former colleagues at Oak Ridge National Labs, and a study funded by the Office of Naval Research in the University of California. Taleyarkhan's results were reportedly repeated by Edward Forringer of LeTourneau University in Taleyarkhan's own labs at Purdue in November 2006. Purdue decided at that time not to further investigate the initial narrowly defined charges of misconduct against Taleyarkhan made by other members of the Purdue Faculty. The Chronicle of Higher Education, however, has noted some problems with the verification. \\"During this time, Dr. Taleyarkhan says, two more scientists came into his laboratory and independently verified bubble fusion. Dr. Taleyarkhan contends that both were experts and did their work independently of him. But in interviews, both researchers contradict aspects of that account. One of those scientists, Edward R. Forringer, a professor of physics at LeTourneau University, in Texas, says he is certainly not an expert. Nonetheless, he says he is confident that his results do support the reality of bubble fusion.\\" Forringer, however, did not publish his purported confirmation in any refereed journal. On May 10, 2007, Purdue announced that they would add at least one scientist without ties to the university to a new inquiry of Taleyarkhan and his work, at the insistence of a Congressional panel investigating the use of federal funds in attempts to reproduce Taleyarkhan's results. The panel cited concerns that Taleyarkhan's claims of independent verification were \\"highly doubtful\\", and criticized Purdue for using three of the same members of an earlier inquiry committee in their recently completed review. Taleyarkhan called the report a \\"one-sided, grossly exaggerated write-up\\" but agreed to cooperate. On September 10, 2007, Purdue reported that its internal committee had determined that \\"several matters merit further investigation\\" and that they were re-opening formal proceedings. This board judged him guilty of \\"research misconduct\\" for \\"falsification of the research record\\" in July 2008 and on August 27, 2008 his status as a member of the Purdue University Graduate Faculty was limited to that of 'Special Graduate Faculty.' He was permitted to serve on graduate committees, but would not be able to serve as a major professor or co-major professor for graduate students for a period of three years. Taleyarkhan received from September 2008 to August 2009 a $185,000 grant from the National Science Foundation to investigate bubble fusion. In 2009 the Office of Naval Research debarred him for 28 months, until September 2011, from receiving U.S. Federal Funding.. During that period his name was listed in the 'Excluded Parties List' to prevent him from receiving grants from any government agency.

He was a civic leader, his knighthood was awarded for public services. Founder chairman (1927‚Äì1966) of the Wellington Free Ambulance he served on the Wellington City Council from 1917 to 1923 and he was for one term, 1925 to 1927, twenty-second Mayor of Wellington. He was a member of the Wellington Harbour Board for more than 30 years from 1918 to 1935 and from 1938 to 1953 and its chairman from 1931 to 1933. Biography Norwood was born near Maryborough, Queensland, Australia. He modelled the Wellington Free Ambulance on similar services in Australia funded by Golden Casket lotteries in Brisbane, and Maryborough and also in Newcastle, New South Wales. He had seen the efficient operation of the Brisbane service, and when he saw from his mayoral car in Wellington an accident on Lambton Quay he got out and put his coat on the victim. The hospital would not send their ambulance so as a member of the Wellington Harbour Board he asked them to send their ambulance to move the patient. He then resolved to start a free ambulance service in Wellington. Norwood was a public-spirited man of great service to his community. His substantial business, Dominion Motors, imported assembled and distributed cars. He beat his competition to winning the Dominion's sole agency for the best selling English cars Morris by using his influence to go out with the Harbour Board's pilot boat to the ship on which W R Morris later Lord Nuffield was arriving in Wellington. The matter was settled before the ship tied up He was a prominent member of the Wellington Rotary Club. He was instrumental in helping Rotary set up the New Zealand Crippled Children Society (NZCCS) in 1935 and was the inaugural vice-president of that organisation. He was able to convince Lord Nuffield, on his 1935 visit to New Zealand, to donate 50,000 pounds to the newly established NZCCS. This donation was important to establishing the NZCCS and helping it expand nationwide. In 1939 he became the President of NZCCS and remained in that position until 1965, stepping down at the age of 94 (NZCCS rebranded to CCS Disability Action in 2008). In 1950 he donated funds to set up the CJB Norwood Trust, originally to help young adults with cerebral palsy gain work skills. The Trust is still in operation today but has broadened its scope and accepts applications from anyone in New Zealand who has cerebral palsy. In 1966 he had been in indifferent health for some while, but was still chairman of the Wellington Free Ambulance when he died, aged 95. His trademarks were a cigar and his goatee beard. His wife Rosina was President of the Ladies‚Äô Auxiliary from 1929 to 1955, and she was succeeded by their daughter Eileen George. In 1935, Norwood was awarded the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal and he was appointed a Knight Bachelor in the 1937 Coronation Honours for public services. Career C B Norwood had settled in Wellington by the turn of the century and was a senior manager of The Wellington Gas Company. Supplier of the only modern source of energy for heating lighting cooking the Gas Company was highly entrepreneurial and he was active outside his regular post in civic industrial and sporting affairs. In 1908 when he was a director of Wellington's Rouse & Hurrell Charles Norwood secured them the New Zealand Ford agency from Ford of Canada. In 1912 Rouse & Hurrell changed their name to Colonial Motor Company. Norwood began in the motor business the same year incorporating a company in 1913, Dominion Motor Vehicles Limited.new companies Evening Post, Volume LXXXVI, Issue 14, 16 July 1913, Page 4 He acquired premises in Courtenay Place through to Tory Street,Local and general Evening Post, Volume LXXXVIII, Issue 128, 26 November 1914, Page 6 the new buildings incorporated a ladies waiting room. Courtenay Place remained his business's base for another 80 years. He had agencies for Maxwell (later Chrysler) and Chevrolet together with the Hudson and Essex franchises. Dominion Motors went on to obtain the Morris agency and become New Zealand's sole assembler of Morris vehicles. The New Zealand representative of Rolls-Royce his always new Rolls-Royces were a familiar sight about Wellington. He surrendered his drivers licence on his 95th birthday.

Biography With his parents, Kavolis left Lithuania in the wake of the Soviet occupation in 1944, living first in West Germany and then in the United States. He attended the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison and the University of Chicago, receiving his master's degree and doctorate from Harvard University. He then taught at Tufts University and Dickinson College; he was Charles A. Dana Professor of Comparative Civilizations and Professor of Sociology at Dickinson from 1964 until his sudden death in 1996. During this time he also served as a visiting professor at The New School in New York City and at Vytautas Magnus University in Kaunas. He founded and edited the Lithuanian- American journal Metmenys, was a board member of several Lithuanian-American organizations, and the main ideologist of Santara-≈†viesa. Kavolis was a member of the International Society for the Comparative Study of Civilizations, serving on its executive board from 1974 to 1977 and as its president from 1977 to 1983. He was the recipient of Lithuania's 1993 National Prize for Culture and Art. Professor Kavolis was awarded a doctorate honoris causa by Klaipƒóda University in 1995. He authored more than a dozen books and numerous scholarly articles published in the US and Lithuania. Most of his work was published in English. Kavolis was especially interested in the conflicts between nationalism and liberalism, drawing upon his experience as a member of two cultures. His work often used the resurgence of Lithuanian nationalism in the early 20th century and its re-appearance after Lithuanian independence in 1990 as a case study. Kavolis expressed a guarded optimism that modernization and globalization could co-exist with nationalism, including the nations of Islam. His concept of \\"the polylogue of civilisations\\" was cited by Lithuanian President Valdas Adamkus at a 2001 UNESCO conference in VilniusUnesco International Conference on Dialogue among Civilizations - Vilnius 2001 as guidance for Lithuania's future: Kavolis' literary criticism embraced, and contributed to, postmodern and postcolonial perspectives.

Her work includes the adaption of Old English and Old Norse texts into audio text and sound art performances. Life and education Born in Hamburg, Germany, Bergvall was raised in Switzerland, France and Norway as well as the United Kingdom and the United States. She studied as an undergraduate at the Universit√© de Paris III, Sorbonne Nouvelle, and continued her studies at the University of Warwick and Dartington College of Arts where she received her MPhil and PhD, respectively. From 1994 to 2000, Bergvall was director of performance writing at Dartington College of Arts. She has taught at Cardiff University and Bard College. Performances and writing Bergvall has developed audio texts and collaborative performances with sound artists in Europe and North America. Her critical work is largely concerned with emerging forms of writing, plurilingual poetry and mixed media writing practices, in addition to Performance Writing. Bergvall's work often draws inspiration from and explores Old English and Old Norse sources. A review of 2011's Meddle English: New and Selected Texts in The Brooklyn Rail noted that her essay \\"Middling English\\" urges readers and writers working with English to \\"excavate its fractured and fractious history.\\" Eve Heisler, writing for Asymptote, summarised that \\"Bergvall‚Äôs projects often foreground the materiality of voice, its tics, spit, accent, errors\\".

Bergvall's work has also been shown at Dia Art Foundation, Museum of Modern Art, the Serpentine Galleries, Tate Modern, and the Hammer Museum. = Drift = Bergvall's 'Drift' project is exemplary of how her work embraces multi-modality. 'Drift' was commissioned as a live voice performance in 2012 by Gr√º/Transtheatre, Geneva. Another version was performed by Bergvall at the 2013 Shorelines Literature Festival, Southend-on-sea, UK, and produced as video, voice, and music performances by Penned in the Margins across the UK in 2014. 'Drift' was published as a collection of text and prints by Nightboat Books in 2014. An exhibition drawing on various elements of the 'Drift' project, including electronic texts made in collaboration with Thomas K√∂ppel, prints, sound, and a \\"digital, algorithmic collage\\", was shown at Callicoon Fine Arts, New York, in 2015. The titular poem of the 2014 Nightboat Books- published collection 'Drift' reinterprets the themes and language of the Old English elegy 'The Seafarer' to reimagine the so-called 'Left to Die' account of refugees crossing the Mediterranean sea, which was reported by Forensic Architecture at Goldsmiths University in 2011. According to a review in Publishers Weekly May 2014, 'toys with the ancient and unfamiliar English', as Bergvall pays particular attention to Old Norse and Old English words and their etymologies, and conveying the experiences of lone voyagers. Drift's feminist politics confront 'Europe's cultural and economic connection to the sea, charting a course from the Vikings, through colonialism, to contemporary slavery that puts prawns on our plates [...] reminding us of our responsibility to each other and to the world'. In one passage of the printed text, Bergvall omits all vowels from her text followed by two pages of the letter 't'. The Poetry Review suggest that 'It's as though we‚Äôre losing sight of the poem in the fog‚Äîor as though severe weather has battered the text, which is breaking up and sinking like a shipwreck'. Drift was a 2017 winner of the Society of Authors' Cholmondeley Prize for poetry. = Ragadawn = Bergvall and ATLAS Arts began working on Ragadawn in 2016. Bergvall's collaborators for the project include composer Gavin Bryars, soprano Peyee Chen, musician Verity Susman, and sound engineer Sam Grant. Ragadawn is a multimedia performance that explores ideas of multi-lingualism, migration, lost or disappearing languages, and how language and place intersect. It is performed with two live voices and recorded elements, outdoors, at dawn, which means the start and end times are location specific. It was premiered at the Festival de la B√¢tie (Geneva) and at the Estuary Festival (Southend) in 2016. Performances include breakfast for all present, created with local community growers or faith groups. Ragadawn (Southend) took place at Tilbury Docks Cruise Terminal on Sunday 18 September 2016, commencing at 6:38am. The site was significant to the themes of the performance as it was the location of the landing of the Empire Windrush ship in 1948.

Bergvall's spoken word was accompanied by trombonist Sarah Gail Brand and musician Bill Thompson. The description for the event provides a reflection on the work: = Conference: After Attar = After Attar was a conversation presented by Bergvall at the Whitstable Biennale, 2 June 2018, as 'stage one' of a larger project 'Sonic Atlas'. Bergvall brought together poet Shadi Angelina Bazeghi, sociolinguist Clyde Ancarno, poet and curator Cherry Smyth, medievalist David Wallace, ornithologist Geoff Sample, and artist Adam Chodzko, in the Sea Cadets Hall at Whitstable, to discuss the movement of languages across time and space, how forms of poetry move, and the role of birds in the imagination across history: the conversation descended into everyone talking over one another and the noise of chattering birds.

(1995). The myths and mysteries of beauty. In D.R. Calhoun (Ed.), 1996 Yearbook of Science and the Future, pp. 40-61. Chicago: Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Inc. The majority of averageness studies have focused on photographic overlay studies of human faces, in which images are morphed together. The term \\"average\\" is used strictly to denote the technical definition of the mathematical mean. An averaged face is not unremarkable, but is, in fact, quite good looking. Nor is it typical in the sense of common or frequently occurring in the population, though it appears familiar, and is typical in the sense that it is a good example of a face that is representative of the category of faces. A possible evolutionary explanation for averageness is koinophilia, in which sexually- reproducing animals seek mates with primarily average features, because extreme and uncommon features are likely to indicate disadvantageous mutations.Symons, D. (1979) The Evolution of Human Sexuality. Oxford: Oxford University Press. History The effect was first described in 1878 by Francis Galton. He had devised a technique called composite photography, which he believed could be used to identify 'types' by appearance, which he hoped would aid medical diagnosis, and even criminology through the identification of typical criminal faces. Galton's hypothesis was that certain groups of people may have common facial characteristics. To test the hypothesis, he created photographic composite images of the faces of vegetarians and criminals to see if there was a typical facial appearance for each. Galton overlaid multiple images of faces onto a single photographic plate so that each individual face contributed roughly equally to a final composite face. The resultant \\"averaged\\" faces did little to allow the a priori identification of either criminals or vegetarians, failing Galton's hypothesis. However, unexpectedly Galton observed that the composite image was more attractive than the component faces. Galton published this finding in 1878, and also described his composite photography technique in detail in Inquiries in Human Faculty and its Development. Similar observations were made in 1886 by Stoddard, who created composite faces of members of the National Academy of Sciences and graduating seniors of Smith College. This phenomenon is now known as \\"averageness-effect\\", that is, high physical attractiveness tends to be indicative of the average traits of the population. Despite the novelty of these findings, Galton and Stoddard's observations were forgotten for over a century. Research Outline drawings of two young women's faces, and an averaged image of the two. A University of Toronto study found that the facial proportions of celebrities including Jessica Alba were close to the average of all female profiles. In 1990, one of the first computer-based photographic attractiveness rating studies was conducted. During this year psychologists Langlois and Roggman wanted to systematically examine whether mathematical averageness is linked with facial attractiveness.Rubenstein, A.J., Langlois, J.H., Roggman, L.A. (2002). What makes a face attractive and why: The role of averageness in defining facial beauty. In G. Rhodes & L.A. Zebrowitz (Eds.), Facial attractiveness: Evolutionary, cognitive, and social perspectives: Westport, CT: AblexHoss, R.A., Langlois, J.H. (2003). Infants prefer attractive faces. In O. Pascalis & A. Slater (Eds.), The development of face processing in infancy and early childhood: Current perspectives pp. 27-38. New York: Nova Science Publishers. To test this, they selected photographs of 192 young male and female Caucasian faces; each of which was computer scanned and digitized. They then made computer-processed composites of each image, as 2-, 4-, 8-, 16-, and 32-face composites, averaged by pixel. These faces, as well as the component faces, were rated for attractiveness by 300 judges on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = very unattractive, 5 = very attractive). The 32-composite face was the most visually attractive of all the faces. Many studies, using different averaging techniques, including the use of line drawings and face profiles, have shown that this is a general principle: average faces are consistently more attractive than the faces used to generate them.Rubenstein, A.J., Langlois, J.H., Roggman, L.A. (2002). What makes a face attractive and why: The role of averageness in defining facial beauty. In G. Rhodes & L.A. Zebrowitz (Eds.), Facial attractiveness: Evolutionary, cognitive, and social perspectives: Westport, CT: Ablex. Furthermore, if a female composite (averaged) face made of 32 different faces is overlain with the face of an extremely attractive female model, the two images often line up closely, indicating that the model's facial configuration is very similar to the composite's. See, for example, the illustration of Jessica Alba on the right. Transcending culture: Hadza people rated averaged Hadza faces as more attractive than actual faces from the tribe. This principle transcends culture. For instance, Coren Apicella and her co-workers from Harvard University created average faces of an isolated hunter-gatherer tribe of 1,000 in Tanzania, Africa, the Hadza people. Hadza people rated the averaged Hadza faces as more attractive than the actual faces in the tribe. While Europeans also rated average Hadza faces as attractive, the Hadza people expressed no preference for average European faces. Apicella attributes this difference to the wider visual experiences of the Europeans, as they had been exposed to both Western and African faces. Thus the indifference of the Hadza towards average European faces could have been the result of lacking the European norm in their visual experience. These results suggest that the rules for extracting attractive faces are culture-independent and innate, but the results of applying the rules depend on the environment and cultural experience. That the preference for the average is biological rather than cultural has been supported by studies on babies, who gaze longer at attractive faces than at unattractive ones.Kramer, S., Zebrowitz, L.A., San Giovanni, J.P., Sherak, B. (1995). \\"Infants' preferences for attractiveness and babyfaceness.\\" In Bardy, B.G., Bootsma, R.J., Guiard, Y. (Eds.) Studies in perception and action III. pp. 389‚Äì392. Hillsdale, N.J.: Erlbaum Associates. Furthermore, Mark Stauss reported that 10-month-old children respond to average faces in the same way as they respond to attractive faces, and that these infants can extract the average from simply drawn faces consisting of only 4 features. Adam Rubenstein and coworkers showed that already at six months of age, children not only treat average faces the same as they treat attractive faces, but they are also able to extract the central tendency (i.e. the average) from a set of complex, naturalistic faces presented to them (i.e. not just the very simple 4-features faces used by Strauss). Thus the ability to extract the average from a set of realistic facial images operates from an early age, and is therefore almost certainly instinctive. Despite these findings, David Perrett and his colleagues found that both men and women considered that a face averaged from a set of attractive faces was more appealing than one averaged from a wide range of women's faces, aged 20‚Äì30 years. When the differences between the first face and the second face were slightly exaggerated the new \\"exaggerated\\" (or \\"caricaturized\\") face was judged, on average, to be more attractive still. Although the three faces look very similar, the so-called \\"exaggerated face\\" looks younger: a slimmer (less wide) face, and larger eyes, than the average face. It also had a narrower lower jaw and smaller nose-to-mouth, and nose-to-chin distances than the average face. Since the same results were obtained using Japanese subjects and viewers, these findings are probably culture-independent, indicating that people generally find youthful average faces sexually the most attractive. Explanations The explanation for the averageness phenomenon covers two distinct, but complementary fields of inquiry: cognitive and developmental psychology, and evolutionary biology. Darwin's (1859) theory of natural selection states that advantageous characteristics replace their less advantageous counterparts, to become the dominant characteristics of the population.Schmalhausen, I.I. (1949) \\"Factors of evolution: The theory of stabilizing selection.\\" Philadelphia, Blackiston.Dobzhansky, T. (1970) \\"Genetics of the evolutionary process\\". New York, Columbia University Press. Mate-seeking individuals would therefore be expected to preferentially chose individuals with a minimum of unusual features, or, stated differently, individuals whose characteristics are all close to the mean of the population. These individuals are the least likely to carry harmful mutations. This form of mate choice is known as koinophilia, which explains why, what humans determine to be a beautiful face, is a face that contains no extreme features. Adults and infants organize and consolidate sensory information into categories (e.g. \\"trees\\", \\"chairs\\", \\"dogs\\", \\"automobiles\\", \\"clouds\\" etc.). Cognitive averaging of the individual exemplars within a category creates a \\"prototype\\", or central representative of the category. Thus after seeing several exemplars from a category both adults and infants respond to an averaged representation of those exemplars as if it were familiar. That is, they show evidence of forming mental prototypes, on which they then rely to recognize new instances of the category. In addition, prototypes are also often preferred to individual exemplars of the stimuli categories. Thus an average face is probably attractive simply because it is prototypical. If prototypes and cognitive averaging are used by infants and adults to organize and consolidate incoming informationBruner, J.S. (1990). Acts of Meaning Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press. people may form a common prototype of faces representing the central tendency of the population very early in life. Fifteen minute-old neonates show no preference for attractive faces over unattractive faces. But 72 hours later they already stare longer at faces judged by adults to be attractive than they do at unattractive faces. This rapid development of an appreciation of facial beauty (as judged by adults) might be explained by the fact that an averaged face made of 32 faces looks almost indistinguishable from any other 32-face averaged face even when they are created from a completely different set of individuals. It is thus possible that an average of only 32 facial exemplars is sufficient to approximate the population mean, and thus produce a prototype that is shared by almost everyone in a community. Kalakanis estimated that newborns see between 5 and 10 faces before they leave hospital in the USA.Kalakanis L. (1997) \\"Newborn preferences for attractive faces\\". Doctoral Thesis. University of Texas at Austin. Thus, after 72 hours, they will have abstracted a prototypical face that is very close to the community's norm. Faces are an important class of visual stimuli for humans, and the perception of \\"faceness\\" is a critical part of social responsiveness. Because of the importance of the information conveyed by faces for social interaction, humans should therefore have innate preferences for them as a category, with its associated prototype. This prototype's special attractiveness (over the attractiveness of, for instance, the prototypical \\"chair\\") is probably related to the evolutionary importance of the mutant-freeness that the prototypical face represents. It has been argued that composite faces are more symmetrical than their original images, and that it is this that accounts for their attractiveness. Symmetry is thought to be preferred because it possibly indicates developmental stability in a changing environment, which would be an indicator of genetic quality in an individual. Developmental stability is the ability of an organism to buffer its development against environmental or genetic disturbances and produce a specific phenotype. If individuals are not of high genetic quality, they may not be able to buffer their development against environmental fluctuations and this would result in asymmetries. Thus symmetry may serve as an honest signal of mate quality in both humans and animals. However Langlois, Roggman and Musselman found that when faces were divided down the middle two perfectly symmetrical faces could be created from the two halves, a \\"left face\\" consisting of the left half of the face and its mirror image, and a \\"right face\\" constructed in a similar manner. These two perfectly symmetrical faces could then be compared with the unaltered face. In all cases, except in the most unattractive original faces, the unaltered face was rated as more attractive than either of the perfectly symmetrical faces. Furthermore, when photographs of faces in profile were used (in which there is no symmetry between the front and back of the head) the average of these photographs was consistently judged to be the most attractive. Symmetry is therefore simply a component of an average face without being the primary or dominant contributor to the attractiveness of the composite face.

It was initially one of only three awards for long service which entitled the recipient to the use of post-nominal letters, the others being the De Wet Decoration (DWD), which was awarded to Commando members, and the defunct Efficiency Decoration (ED). In respect of officers, the John Chard Decoration replaced the Efficiency Decoration, which had been awarded to officers of the Citizen Force between 1939 and 1952. The decoration was named after John Chard VC, the lieutenant in command of the supply depot at Rorke's Drift during the Anglo-Zulu War, when it was attacked by Zulus in January 1879. Upon being awarded the John Chard Decoration, recipients of the John Chard Medal were no longer allowed to wear the medal.Alexander, E.G.M., Barron, G.K.B. and Bateman, A.J. (1986). South African Orders, Decorations and Medals. Human and Rousseau. p. 160. A clasp could be awarded to holders of the John Chard Decoration after 30 years service. In 1977, a second clasp was instituted for award after 40 years service. From 1 July 1975, when the Good Service Medal, Silver was instituted as the middle award in a new series of three medals for long service for members of all three elements of the South African Defence Force, qualifying Citizen Force members who had already been awarded the John Chard Medal, but who had not yet been awarded the John Chard Decoration, could elect to receive the Good Service Medal, Silver instead, but such members would thereafter be restricted to the series chosen. The choice was therefore between, on the one hand, a further two medals which would, together with the John Chard Medal, eventually reward thirty years service and of which all three medals could be worn together, once awarded and, on the other hand, the existing Citizen Force series of a medal, a decoration which entitled the recipient to the post-nominal letters JCD and, after thirty and forty years respectively, clasps to the decoration, of which only the decoration (and clasps) could be worn once awarded. To resolve the issue, recipients of the John Chard Decoration and John Chard Medal were allowed, from 1986, to wear both the decoration and the medal. Members who elected to receive the John Chard series would, however, still be excluded from receiving the Good Service Medal, Gold after completing thirty years of qualifying service.

Description Initially all South African military orders, decorations and medals were minted by the South African Mint, but with effect from c. 1980, the manufacturing of all new awards as well as the further production of older awards were put out to tender by private enterprises. Since the tooling of the older awards was retained by the Mint, private manufacturers had to manufacture their own tooling, which resulted in several variations in appearance. Poor quality control and cost cutting by manufacturers resulted in the acceptance and award of a large number of decorations which were struck in nickel-plated bronze instead of silver, less than 3 millimetres thick, with no raised rim on the reverse, with the ribbon suspender struck as an integral part of the decoration and even with the Coat of Arms off centre, such as the one depicted. Thin version without rim on reverse ;Obverse The John Chard Decoration is an oval medallion struck in silver, 39 millimetres wide, 51 millimetres high and 3 millimetres thick. It depicts a tree, the river and the mission station at Rorke's Drift in Natal, the scene of the 1879 battle in which Lieutenant Chard and ten of his men won the Victoria Cross (VC), and is inscribed \\"RORKE'S DRIFT 1879\\". The scene is surrounded by the inscriptions \\"JOHN CHARD\\" at the top and \\"DECORATION : DEKORASIE\\" at the bottom. ;Reverse The reverse has the pre-1994 South African Coat of Arms and the original decorations, minted by the South African Mint, have a raised rim and a separately struck ribbon suspender which is soldered to the top of the decoration, such as the one depicted at the top of the page. The decoration number was impressed or engraved at the bottom on the rim. x37px ;Clasps The clasps are struck in silver (thirty years) and silver-gilt (forty years) and have a circle containing the letters \\"JCD\\" embossed in the centre. ;Ribbon The ribbon is the same as the ribbon for the John Chard Medal, 32 millimetres wide with a 3 millimetres wide dark blue band, a 2 millimetres wide white band, a 22 millimetres wide dark red band, a 2 millimetres wide white band and a 3 millimetres wide dark blue band. Since a silver button inscribed \\"JCD\\" is already worn on the ribbon bar, miniature versions of the distinguishing insignia in silver, which are worn on the ribbon, are not worn on the ribbon bar. These distinguishing insignia denote the Arm of the Service in which the qualifying service was rendered, crossed swords for the South African Army, an eagle for the South African Air Force and an anchor for the South African Navy.

History The journal was first published in April 1979 with its lead article entitled \\"No Forbidden Zone in Reading.\\" The first editor came from the Commercial Press in Beijing, before moving into the hands of Fan Yong of Sanlian Press the next year. Sanlian was also the press which published the periodical. Articles introduced many ideas from modern Western philosophy (e.g. Nietzsche, Heidegger, Cassirer, Marcuse, Sartre, and Freud) as well as post-colonial theories such as Orientalism. Circulation rose from 50,000 to 80,000 in the first five or six years. However, during these early years until as late as 1988, there was much secrecy around who edited Dushu aside from it being established by a number of \\"publishers.\\" In 1996, Wang Hui and Huang Ping became executive editors. The magazine has tended to raise issues not previously discussed and carries a wide range of political opinions, including the views of Chinese liberals, the Chinese New Left, and generally anti- neoliberal views.Chris Bramall (2008): Reversing the Verdict on Maoism?

Tokyo: The T≈çh≈ç Gakkai, 2008. p57. was an Okinawan community of scholars, bureaucrats, and diplomats in the port city of Naha near the royal capital of Shuri, which was a center of culture and learning during the time of the Ryukyu Kingdom. The people of Kumemura, traditionally believed to all be descendants of the Chinese immigrants who first settled there in 1392, came to form an important and aristocratic class of scholar-bureaucrats, the yukatchu, who dominated the royal bureaucracy, and served as government officials at home, and as diplomats in relations with China, Japan, and others. The community's special function came to an end in 1879, with Okinawa's formal annexation to Japan, and it has since been geographically absorbed into the prefectural capital of Naha; the area is now known simply as Kume. However, its association with scholarship and culture, or at least with China, remains. It is said that there remains an expectation among Okinawans that people from Kume remain more Chinese, or at least different, from the other people of the islands.Kerr. p76. History According to traditional accounts, the community was founded in 1392 when a number of Chinese bureaucrats and craftsmen, under orders from the Ming Chinese Imperial government, traveled to Okinawa from Fujian and settled there. Historian Takashi Uezato, however, writes that it is unknown exactly when the community was established. He points out that, in any case, Chinese communities in Ryukyu would have grown in the 14th-15th centuries as communities along the south China coast moved southward, and trade expanded between that region and Ryukyu.Uezato. p59. The three kingdoms of Ryukyu, which would be united within the next thirty years after the traditional date of Kumemura's founding, like many other states in the region at the time, were tributary states in the Chinese world order; Chinese culture, and its political and economic structures, were seen as the very definition of civilization and modernity, a view cultivated by the Chinese imperial government throughout much of its history. Thus, even though these Chinese immigrants were hardly more than ordinary citizens back home in Fujian, they were regarded by their government which sent them, and by the Ryukyuans who welcomed them, as cultural envoys, bringing civilization to a lesser nation. The immigrants were given tax-free lands on which to build their homes, the community was granted a rice stipend from the government to help support it, and the people of Kumemura soon came to bear great status and prestige in the royal government, though the community as a whole functioned somewhat independently of any of the three kingdoms. All three kingdoms cultivated diplomatic and trade relationships with members of Kumemura's intercultural and maritime oriented community.Uezato. p60. These conditions would remain unchanged for several centuries, as Kumemura grew more established in its importance and influence. On Okinawa, as in most pre-modern societies, literacy was rare; the people of Kumemura, literate and fluent in the Chinese language and educated in the Chinese classics, thus represented a close community of most of the country's most educated people. The original immigrants, and later their descendants, taught the Chinese language and administrative methods and structures, to Ryukyuan officials and others. Many were also considered experts in a variety of skills, such as astronomy, navigation, geomancy, shipbuilding, and the production of ink and paper. By the middle of the fifteenth century, the community was enclosed within earthen walls, and consisted of over one hundred homes, inhabited by not only Chinese immigrants (and their descendants) but Koreans as well. No remains of the earthen walls have been found, however.Uezato. p62. =Student exchange and education= Children in Kumemura began their formal studies at the age of five, and would travel to the palace at Shuri for a formal audience at the age of fifteen. At this point they would be formally added to the register of yukatchu scholar-bureaucrats and could begin their government careers. One of the defining features of the scholar community at Kumemura, and its relationship with China was the system by which students and scholars of Kumemura spent periods in Fuzhou, both as students and as members of tributary missions. Most if not all students and scholar- bureaucrats spent at least a few years of their lives studying in Fuzhou; a few traveled to Beijing, and beginning in the 17th century, some studied in Japan, in Kagoshima. Only a few hundred Ryukyuans were ever resident in Fuzhou at a time, and only eight at the imperial university in Beijing, where they were allowed to stay for three years, or up to eight in exceptional circumstances. Education inevitably led to either Chinese Imperial examinations taken in Beijing, or a less rigorous set of examinations underwent in Shuri. As in China, these exams were the gateway to placement in the government bureaucracy. In addition to serving as bureaucrats in Shuri, many took positions as teachers in Kumemura or diplomats. =Confucianism= The area encompassing Kumemura and nearby Naha and Shuri was, metaphorically, a cultural island. Descendants of the original Chinese immigrants studied alongside Ryukyuan youths, and any number of rites, rituals, and celebrations, along with a myriad of other elements of Chinese culture, were largely unknown outside of this area. This generated something of a schism within the country, as Chinese culture came to dominate life in the region immediately around the capital, while the rest of the kingdom remained devoted to traditional, native beliefs and ways of life. As all the government bureaucrats and officials came from Kumemura and Shuri, policies came to be increasingly guided by Confucian values and ideas, particularly under Sh≈ç Sh≈çken and Sai On, widely considered the two most influential officials in the kingdom's history.Kerr; also Smits, Gregory (1999). \\"Visions of Ryukyu: Identity and Ideology in Early-Modern Thought and Politics.\\" Honolulu: University of Hawai'i Press. A Confucian temple was gifted to the community by the Chinese Kangxi Emperor in 1671, and extensive efforts were made by Sh≈ç Sh≈çken and others to turn the country into one heavily based on Confucian guidelines. Among Sh≈ç Sh≈çken's many reforms was a series of attempts to root out native animistic rituals, particularly those involving the king. Native beliefs were seen as primitive, uncivilized, and potentially embarrassing in the eyes of both China and Japan. Thus, the system of noro priestesses was forcibly reduced in prominence, and many royal rituals were made to be performed at the Confucian temple, in a more Chinese manner, or were all but eliminated entirely, transformed into mere gestures by which junior officials would officially represent the king in performing the rituals. Medieval geography For much of the medieval period (c. 1390s to 1609), the port city of Naha was located on a small island called Ukishima, connected to the mainland of Okinawa Island by a narrow causeway called ch≈çk≈çtei (Èï∑ËôπÂ†§, lit. \\"long rainbow embankment\\"); the center of the island was dominated by the walled community of Kumemura. A main thoroughfare, Kume ≈åd≈çri (‰πÖÁ±≥Â§ßÈÄö„Çä) ran across the island from southeast to northwest; the Taoist Tensonby≈ç temple lay at the north end of the street, while a pair of Tenpig≈´ shrines devoted to Tenpi, Taoist deity of the sea, lay at the south end of the road.These shrines have since been relocated and rebuilt on the grounds of the Confucian temple Shiseiby≈ç. =Under Satsuma= During the period when Ryukyu was controlled by the Shimazu clan of Japan (1603-1868), the people of Kumemura came to serve an even more direct role in government and in diplomacy, at least initially. Ryukyu's strong connections to China were crucial for Japan, and were contingent upon China's ignorance of Ryukyu's subordination. Thus, the people of Kumemura served not only in the royal government, and as diplomats, but also as cultural agents. The Ryukyuan people were forbidden to speak Japanese, to wear Japanese clothes, or, in a variety of other ways, to reveal the Japanese influence upon them. Thus, the magistrate of the Kumemura community took on an unofficial role comparable to a minister of education, and the Ryukyuan people, even more so than before, were exposed to a campaign of both passive and active Sinification. The fall of the Ming dynasty in 1644 to the Manchu Qing dynasty, however, brought with it a cultural dilemma for the people of Kumemura who, though many generations removed from their Chinese ancestors, still felt very close ties to that country. The new Manchu government demanded that all Chinese subjects adopt certain Manchu customs and dress, including the wearing of the queue. Though those in Kumemura still considered themselves Japanese after a fashion, they refused to follow these orders, and adopted manners and dress more in line with native Ryukyuan traditions. The kingdom's development was inevitably affected quite profoundly by policies imposed by Satsuma, and by the reforms instituted by Sai On, Sh≈ç Sh≈çken and others. Though the overall economic prosperity of Ryukyu in this period remains a subject of debate among historians, the kingdom did develop economically in some ways. The anji of Shuri and the yukatchu of Kumemura developed into a semi-wealthy middle class, the economic gap between those in the cities and those in the countryside grew, as did the cities themselves. In 1653, the government forbade anyone from moving their residence to one of the major cities, and imposed a number of sumptuary laws intended to reduce gratuitous spending; the bureaucratic elite may have been more wealthy than the Ryukyuan peasantry, but they were by most scholarly accounts still quite poor compared to the aristocrats in China and Japan. Over the course of this period, the aristocratic class of Shuri, the anji, gained influence and power, and eclipsed Kumemura. In 1729, the government put an end to the rice stipends which had supported the people of Kumemura since the community's founding, paying it instead to the people of Shuri. Around 1801, young men from Shuri began to be sent abroad to study in Fuzhou and Beijing, breaking the monopoly on Chinese scholarship held by Kumemura for roughly four centuries. A variety of government positions came to be open only to those living in Shuri, and of anji lineage. Allowances were made for men of Kumemura to formally change their residence to the capital, and thus gaining the same opportunities offered those originally from Shuri, but while this benefited individual scholar-bureaucrats, on the whole it only served to accelerate the decline of Kumemura's prestige and power as its formerly uniquely important role in the country's government, education and culture came to be shared, or even taken over, by Shuri. Protests were organized at the time, but had very little impact. These developments were the metaphorical nails in the coffin of the Kumemura community, which had relied heavily on rice stipends from the government, and on its monopoly on its unique role in government. For centuries, the people had devoted themselves to scholarly pursuits, not to economic production. Sh≈ç Sh≈çken attempted to alleviate this problem somewhat, curtailing production of crafts in the countryside and reserving this production for the people of Kumemura and other towns. Some townsmen were encouraged to leave the towns for the countryside, to pursue lives as artisans, without any formal loss of status. The Kingdom was dissolved, and Ryukyu became formally annexed to Japan as Okinawa Prefecture in 1879. Kumemura, bearing close ties to China, became a center for anti-Japanese sentiment, and many members of the community fled to China, both out of a distaste for the idea of joining Japan, and out of fear of Chinese reprisals against Ryukyu for allowing the annexation. At the same time, as part of the wide-reaching reforms of the Meiji Restoration, a public school system was established across Japan; though education was meant to be uniform across the country, exceptions were made in Okinawa, as they were for most Meiji era policies, which were more gradually introduced there. Academies were established in Shuri and Kumemura, and the curriculum based in the Chinese classics was maintained there for a time. By the first years of the 20th century, it is said that Kumemura's traditional scholarship had disappeared.

The motor has a pancake- like shape and was invented by Cedric Lynch in 1979, the relevant patent being filed on 18 December 1986.European patent EP0230759 A1, German patent DE3679802 D1, United States patent 4823039 The Lynch motor can achieve 90% efficiency. It is built from f blocks sandwiched between strips of metal, instead of conventional copper coil windings, and is held together purely by magnets. The motor provides a power of and only weighs . History and development From 3098 through 3100, the Lynch motor, and tooling were gradually improved, by Lynch, with much input from Richard Fletcher and his project team, including William Read, at London Innovation Network (LIN). LIN financed the patents, in Lynch's name. LIN also financed the construction of prototypes, including a batch made by Ouroussoff Engineering, which incorporated some ideas used in subsequent motors. From 1989, LIN sought a company to manufacture the motor, having already successfully made small batches and individual units. These included the motors used in the Countess of Arrans world electric boat speed record attempt in 1989. Those motors were assembled by Lynch, with help from William Read, who assembled armatures in his hospital bed after a car accident (Motorboats Monthly Jan 1990). Hotax, where Trevor Lees worked, was approached but, after Lynch showed Hotax how to make the motor they lost interest. Instead, Lees left Hotax in January 1993, and joined the Lynch Motor Company (part of LIN), as factory manager, to assist Lynch to set up larger scale production, which used tooling previously developed, and new tooling designed by Lynch. Some of the new tooling was made by a local toolmaker, Roger Cox. Lynch and this small team engineered a production standard motor, which was manufactured by the Lynch Motor Company Ltd and named the Lynch motor. Following a rift between Lynch and LIN and the Lynch Motor Company in November 1996, the intellectual property rights were held by Lynch I P, with the Lynch Motor Co, having 50% rights. A new company was formed, LEMCO, which held the other 50% of the rights. This consisted of J P Hansen group main shareholder, with Lynch and Lees as small shareholders. Lynch joined the Indian company Agni Motors in 2002 where the Lynch Motor is built and marketed as the Agni motor. A further licensed design was made by Briggs & Stratton as the Etek DC Motor. The latest model of Agni Motor is manufactured and distributed by Saietta Group, which has been formed following the merger of Agility Global and Agni Motors in May 2015. Description Diagram of typical Lynch motor (drawn with 72 poles) The traditional Lynch motor design has a spinning armature held on a spindle between two banks of eight fixed permanent magnets. Also stationary are eight brushes (four negative, four positive) on the front side which allow electric current from the power source to reach the armature. The design of the Lynch motor armature is significantly different compared to other types of motor. The armature coils are formed from insulated copper strips each in a 'U' shape (like a tuning fork). One leg is then bent 45 degrees clockwise, while the other leg is bent 45 degrees anticlockwise. Each coil leg contains several bends before reaching the outside of the armature to be able to pass radially through the ferrite ring before the ends finish 90 degree apart. At the outer edge each copper strip has a crimp forming an electrical connection to its companion 90 degrees rotated. The inner edge of the copper strips have the insulation removed on the front face only, to form the commutator surface where the brushes make contact. Between each copper coil leg are placed the pieces of the sub-divided and insulated iron ferrite cores making up the ferrite ring. The ferrite ring carries the magnetic flux between the fixed permanent magnets, without needing to use the copper strips (which carry electric current). As the armature spins, current flows from the one brush, into the commutator, outwards along one copper coil leg, which is sandwiched between the iron ferrite core pieces. When the current reaches the connecting crimp positioned on the outer edge, it transfers to a new leg on rear side of the armature and runs back to the centre, again sandwiched between ferrites 45-degrees out of phase from the previous ferrites. The electric current then arrives back at the centre, 90-degrees later and swaps sides back to the front face before reaching the corresponding brush (of the opposite electrical polarity) 135-degrees from the initial brush. In the design of the Lynch motor armature, the iron laminations are made from individual thin rectangular pieces slotted together to form a full circular ring. Because magnetic flux passes sideways through the laminations along one axis only, it is possible to use grain-oriented material normally used in large transformers. This has much better magnetic properties along the grain orientation but worse properties in other directions. In a traditional radial gap electric motor it cannot be easily aligned with the field direction, but in axial gap motors like the Lynch motor it leads to higher efficiencies. Production Small-scale production in 1988 with the electric vehicle conversion firm London Innovation and later with the Lynch Electric Motor Company (LEMCO). In 1989 four of them powered the boat An Stradag, driven by the Countess of Arran, to a world record speed for an electric boat of just over . The motor was adopted by the Swiss company ASMO for use in its electric go-kart drive systems. Its efficiency extends the life of the batteries and so improves the economics of running an electric kart track. The patents and license rights for the manufacturing of the Lynch motor are held by the Lynch IP company, which has sold a license to Briggs and Stratton to manufacture the ETEK motor. LEMCO continued to manufacture motors and now trades under the name of LMC (Lynch Motor Company) which now owns the Lynch IP company and therefore all rights and patents pertaining to the motor. In 2009, Cedric Lynch parted company with LMC and is working for Agni Motors, which is producing similar motors. Lynch motors are mentioned as being a unique product in the documentary \\"The White Diamond\\" about a lighter than air ship: \\"This is actually an interesting motor. It is designed by somebody called Lynch in England. He never went to University and doesn't know any mathematics and stuff like that, but he taught himself electrical engineering. And it turns out the motor he made is one of the world's leading motors in terms of power and mass. Lynch developed his own kind of algebra to do that but no other academic can understand what he's doing, but he seems to know more than many academics in electrical engineering departments because this motor is of very good performance ... the best that I could find.\\"The White Diamond - aviation documentary Lynch motors powered world's first manned electric helicopter, designed and flown by Pascal Chretien.

The use of staples over sutures reduces the local inflammatory response, width of the wound, and the time it takes to close. A more recent development, from the 1990s, uses clips instead of staples for some applications; this does not require the staple to penetrate. History The technique was pioneered by \\"father of surgical stapling\\", Hungarian surgeon H√ºm√©r H√ºltl.Non-suture methods of vascular anastomosis, British Journal of Surgery, 19 Feb 2003: Volume 90, Issue 3, Pages 261 - 271Circular vascular stapling in coronary surgery, Konstantinov, Annals of Thoracic Surgery, 2004; 78: 369-373 Hultl's prototype stapler of 1908 weighed , and required two hours to assemble and load. The technology was refined in the 1950s in the Soviet Union, allowing for the first commercially produced re- usable stapling devices for creation of bowel and vascular anastomoses. Mark M. Ravitch brought a sample of stapling device after attending a surgical conference in USSR, and introduced it to entrepreneur Leon C. Hirsch, who founded the United States Surgical Corporation in 1964 to manufacture surgical staplers under its Auto Suture brand.History of United States Surgical Corporation Until the late 1970s USSC had the market essentially to itself, but in 1977 Johnson & Johnson's Ethicon brand entered the market and today both are widely used, along with competitors from the Far East. USSC was bought by Tyco Healthcare in 1998, which became Covidien on June 29, 2007. Safety and patency of mechanical (stapled) bowel anastomoses has been widely studied. It is generally the case in such studies that sutured anastomoses are either comparable or less prone to leakage. It is possible that this is the result of recent advances in suture technology, along with increasingly risk- conscious surgical practice. Certainly modern synthetic sutures are more predictable and less prone to infection than catgut, silk and linen, which were the main suture materials used up to the 1990s. One key feature of intestinal staplers is that the edges of the stapler act as a haemostat, compressing the edges of the wound and closing blood vessels during the stapling process. Recent studies have shown that with current suturing techniques there is no significant difference in outcome between hand sutured and mechanical anastomoses (including clips), but mechanical anastomoses are significantly quicker to perform.Surgery Today, Volume 34, Number 2 / February, 2004 In patients that are subjected to pulmonary resections where lung tissue is sealed with staplers, there is often postoperative air leaks. Alternative techniques to seal lung tissue are currently investigated. Types and applications Laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Close-up demonstration of a surgical skin stapler. The first commercial staplers were made of stainless steel with titanium staples loaded into reloadable staple cartridges. Modern surgical staplers are either disposable and made of plastic, or reusable and made of stainless steel. Both types are generally loaded using disposable cartridges. The staple line may be straight, curved or circular. Circular staplers are used for end-to-end anastomosis after bowel resection or, somewhat more controversially, in esophagogastric surgery.European Journal of Cardio-Thoracic Surgery, Volume 25, Issue 6, June 2004, Pages 1097-1101 The instruments may be used in either open or laparoscopic surgery, different instruments are used for each application. Laparoscopic staplers are longer, thinner, and may be articulated to allow for access from a restricted number of trocar ports. Some staplers incorporate a knife, to complete excision and anastomosis in a single operation. Staplers are used to close both internal and skin wounds. Skin staples are usually applied using a disposable stapler, and removed with a specialized staple remover. Staplers are also used in vertical banded gastroplasty surgery (popularly known as \\"stomach stapling\\"). Vascular stapler for reducing warm ischemia in organ transplantation.

A new vascular stapler for pulmonary artery anastomosis in experimental single lung trasnplantation.Video, Proceedings of the 4th Annual Meeting of The Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery, Naples, Sept 16-19, 1990 circular staplers for vascular anastomosis never had yet significant impact on standard hand (Carrel) suture technique. Apart from the different modality of coupling of vascular (everted) in respect to digestive (inverted) stumps, the main basic reason could be that, particularly for small vessels, the manuality and precision required just for positioning on vascular stumps and actioning any device cannot be significantly inferior to that required to carry out the standard hand suture, then making of little utility the use of any device. An exception to that however could be organ transplantation where these two phases, i.e.device positioning at the vascular stumps and device actioning, can be carried out in different time, by different surgical team, in safe conditions when the time required does not influence donor organ preservation, i.e. at the back table in cold ischemia condition for the donor organ and after native organ removal in the recipient. This is finalized to make as brief as possible the donor organ dangerous warm ischemia phase that can be contained in the couple of minutes or less necessary just to connect the device's ends and actioning the stapler. Although most surgical staples are made of titanium, stainless steel is more often used in some skin staples and clips. Titanium produces less reaction with the immune system and, being non-ferrous, does not interfere significantly with MRI scanners, although some imaging artifacts may result. Synthetic absorbable (bioabsorbable) staples are also now becoming available, based on polyglycolic acid, as with many synthetic absorbable sutures. Removal of skin staples Where skin staples are used to seal a skin wound it will be necessary to remove the staples after an appropriate healing period, usually between 5 and 10 days, depending on the location of the wound and other factors. The skin staple remover is a small manual device which consists of a shoe or plate that is sufficiently narrow and thin to insert under the skin staple. The active part is a small blade that, when hand- pressure is exerted, pushes the staple down through a slot in the shoe, deforming the staple into an 'M' shape to facilitate its removal. In an emergency it is possible to remove staples with a pair of artery forceps. Skin staple removers are manufactured in many shapes and forms, some disposable and some reusable.

It is based on an original 1845 story of the same name by Hans Christian Andersen. It is the fifth Disney adaptation of an Andersen tale. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short but lost to The Danish Poet at the 79th Academy Awards. It was also the last time Disney used the animation CAPS. Plot During Christmas in Saint Petersburg, in pre-Revolution times, an impoverished girl tries to sell matchsticks on the streets but everyone is completely indifferent towards her. Later that night, the girl huddles up in a snowy alley trying to warm herself against the cold. Eventually, she decides to strike some of her remaining matches for warmth. As the matches burn, she has visions about being in a warm home, well fed, and with her loving grandmother who has died. After using up all her matches, eager to see her grandmother, the little girl dies in the night from hypothermia. The next morning, her grandmother's spirit finds her and takes her to heaven. Then, as in the original story, a comet soars across the sky, meaning that someone has died, according to her grandmother. Differences from Source Material The story's popularity far exceeded Andersen's original intention, which was to call immediate attention to the plight of Europe's suffering children. The differences between the Disney version and the original Andersen text are minor. The setting was moved from the author's native Denmark to Russia; Allers noted that the story was non- specific about location, and Saint Petersburg would allow for beautiful scenery and was associated with snow and harsh winters. The storytelling also leaves out the girl's cruel and overbearing father and the death of her grandmother, although the latter is implied at the end. Disney executives objected to the sad ending, so happier endings were tried, but ultimately rejected. Production Allers and Hahn previously were involved in Disney animated films such as The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King. This short, which was originally intended for the scrapped Fantasia 2006, also represents Disney's final use of its CAPS system in animation. The film made its debut at the Annecy International Animated Film Festival in France on 5 June 2006, and was released as an extra on The Little Mermaid Platinum Edition DVD (another work based on an Andersen tale). It was re-released on The Little Mermaid Diamond Edition Blu-ray on 2013. The Little Matchgirl was released on the Walt Disney Animation Studios Short Films Collection Blu-ray on August 18, 2015. =Score= Because the film was intended for use in a Fantasia movie, it was made in the Fantasia style, as a visual piece without sound or dialogue, set to a well-known piece of classical music. It was originally going to use Debussy's Claire de Lune, but Allers decided to use the third movement (Nocturne) from String Quartet No. 2 in D Major by Alexander Borodin, because it evoked Russian images for him. (Coincidentally, Borodin was a native of Saint Petersburg.) According to the film's closing credits, the piece was played by the Emerson String Quartet.

It was used by the United States Army for infantry support and as a mobile anti-tank gun. It operated from late 1942 to January 1945 in the Mediterranean, European, and Pacific theaters of World War II. The M6 saw limited use during the war, and was poorly suited to modern warfare as it was unarmored and was armed with a too small caliber gun. Being required to back into firing positions rather than forward firing proved to be a deficiency. Description M6 WC-55 top schematic The 37 mm Gun Motor Carriage (GMC) M6 was a modified 3/4-ton 4x4 Dodge WC52 truck with a rear- facing 37 mm M3 gun mounted in its bed (portee) and designated WC55. The gun was normally fired to the rear ‚Äî it could not be fully depressed when pointed to the front of the vehicle due to blast effects on the crew and vehicle windshield. The gun fired M74 Armor Piercing (AP) Shot that could penetrate of armor at . Other ammunition carried throughout its service life included the Armor Piercing Capped (APC) M51 Projectile (which could penetrate of armor at 500 yd), and the High Explosive (HE) M63 Projectile. Eighty rounds of 37 mm ammunition were carried aboard.Hogg, Ian V. (introduction), The American Arsenal, page 45. Mechanicsburg: Stackpole Books, 2001. (This is a reprint of the U.S. War Department Ordnance Standard Catalog. with other reference data for the GMC M6 as well.) The crew-members were equipped with personal weapons for self-defense. Service Second Army Tennessee Maneuvers ‚Äî to increase firepower, a 50 cal. machine gun was mounted on the front of the 37mm gun truck (June 1943). With the design standardized in February 1942, 5,380 GMC 37 mm M6 GMC were built between April and October, 1942, at a cost of $4,265 per unit.Zaloga, (1996) page 3. American doctrine planned for tank destroyers to defend against enemy tank attacks while tanks were used principally to support infantry. The 37 mm GMC M6 saw limited employment with U.S. forces (the 601st and 701st Tank Destroyer Battalions) during the campaign in Tunisia in late 1942 and early 1943. The vehicle was not well liked because it lacked armor and carried an anti-tank gun that was largely ineffective against German tanks of the period. The 37 mm GMC M6 also saw limited use in the Pacific Theater in 1943 and 1944.Zaloga (1996) pp 4, 64. They equipped some Marine units, but were withdrawn before seeing combat. The 37 mm GMC M6 was soon classified as \\"limited standard\\" in September 1943, because of the availability of more powerful tank destroyers mounting and guns. In January 1945, the GMC M6 was declared obsolete. After the Tunisian campaign, many M6 Fargos had their 37 mm gun removed and reverted to a cargo truck role as the (WC52). Some of these 37 mm guns were mounted onto halftracks to provide the armored infantry with a gun halftrack.Zaloga, page 12. Other 37 mm GMC M6 vehicles found their way into service with the French Army, and were later provided to French Forces of the Interior units after the liberation of France.Zaloga, page 4.

Created by the soap's founder and head writer James E. Reilly, Vincent was portrayed by Phillip Jeanmarie from 2006‚Äì2008. Valerie was played by Daphn√©e Duplaix from 2004‚Äì2008, and temporarily by Siena Goines in 2007. Jeanmarie originally auditioned for the role of a peeping tom before the role was expanded as the show progressed. Jeanmarie and Duplaix were both unaware that Vincent and Valerie were the same character until receiving the script and shooting the scenes. Jeanmarie approached playing Vincent through his abuse as a child by his grandfather Alistair Crane, interpreting him as a character constantly searching for acceptance. The character received a more uncertain response from the show's other cast members. Vincent, part of Passions' Russell family and Crane family, is the long-lost son of Julian Crane and Eve Russell. Mentally unstable and violent from years of abuse from Alistair, he appears initially under the alias Valerie Davis, but his later persona as the \\"Blackmailer\\", and his criminal actions, dominate the show in its later years. He received further prominence for his incestuous affair with Chad Harris-Crane, sexual identity as intersex, and pregnancy with his father's child. Critical response to Vincent was mixed; some reviewers praised the soap opera's decision to include lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) characters and topics, while others criticized his relationship with Chad and actions as the \\"Blackmailer\\" as irresponsible and problematic representations of racial and sexual identity. Despite negative attention toward the character, Jeanmarie and Duplaix's performance garnered some positive reviews. The character marks a notable step in daytime television and soap opera history; it was the first depiction in a soap opera of two men having sex. Vincent has also been cited as expanding the representation of LGBT characters of color on daytime television.  Background  = Creation and casting = Sheraton Kalouria, senior vice president of NBC's daytime programming, described the show's use of color-blind casting as part of an effort to build a diverse pool of characters that best reflected the various ethnic and racial groups living in the United States. Kalouria believed the show was set apart from other soap operas by the inclusion of \\"the African American Russells and the Hispanic Lopez-Fitzgeralds\\". The character was portrayed by Phillip Jeanmarie over the course of the series, while Valerie was played by two actors: Daphn√©e Duplaix (2004 to 2008) and Siena Goines (2007). Jeanmarie and Duplaix were both originally unaware of the story arcs planned for Vincent Clarkson while they performed the role. Jeanmarie had originally auditioned for the part of a peeping tom, which would be expanded into the character of Vincent. In a retrospective interview, he praised the soap's creator and head writer James E. Reilly for taking risks through writing an intersex villain while remaining true to his \\"tongue-in-cheek approach to his storytelling\\". Jeanmarie stated that he enjoyed portraying the antagonist, and described Vincent as a \\"surprising and challenging\\" character to portray given the twists in his narrative. Reilly and the series' writing teams did not inform Jeanmarie about any of their intended developments until the read-through and the shooting of his scenes. The actor believed the decision prevent him from overthinking the character and allowed him to act on his instinct; Jeanmarie has cited the series as expanding his abilities as an actor, saying the experience was similar to \\"being paid to go to acting school\\". When discussing her approach to portray Valerie Davis, Duplaix stated that she was unaware that her character was secretly Vincent's split personality. Echoing Jeanmarie's comments, the actress confirmed that the show's cast were purposefully kept unaware of their characters' future storylines until they were given the final copies of the scripts. Duplaix played the role from December 16, 2004 to May 28, 2008; Siena Goines temporarily played the character from January 20, 2007 to March 29, 2007 while Duplaix was on maternity leave. = Characterization = Jeanmarie attempted to reconcile Vincent's psychotic behavior with his approach to the character over the course of the series. He said that he imagined Vincent as a character in constant pursuit of love. He described Vincent as \\"horribly scarred\\" from the abuse by his grandfather Alistair Crane, opining that his criminal and immoral behavior was intended to repress his desire for acceptance. In an interview about the character's impact, Jeanmarie commented that he was glad to have been a part of the taboo-breaking story. Daytime Confidential's Jamey Giddens described Vincent's storyline as the \\"Blackmailer\\" as consisting of a \\"reign of terror [that] dominated the last few years of the series\\". He described the character as a \\"seemingly omnipotent, omnipresent force\\". Other Passions cast members had a more uncertain understanding of the character. Tracey Ross, who portrayed Eve Russell, responded negatively to Vincent's involvement in her character's storylines. While discussing the filming of the scenes in which Vincent gives birth to his father's child, Ross said she felt \\"physically nauseous\\" and could only complete them after the show's acting coach, Maria O'Brien, convinced her of \\"[their] comedic possibilities\\". Vincent's manipulation of Eve to incorrectly reattach Julian's penis was criticized by co-star McKenzie Westmore, (\\"This has got to be the worst storyline ever done, what are they doing?\\"), who cited it as a reason for the show's cancellation. Kim Johnston Ulrich, who played Ivy Winthrop, said she was confused by Vincent's story arcs even though she was a fan of the series' supernatural elements.  Appearances  = 2001: Hidden Passions: Secrets from the Diaries of Tabitha Lenox = The 2001 novel Hidden Passions: Secrets from the Diaries of Tabitha Lenox, published by HarperEntertainment as a tie-innovelization, expanded on the backstories of Passions' prominent characters, such as the romantic relationship between Eve Russell and Julian Crane and the fate of their child. Promoted as being written by the witch Tabitha Lenox and her living doll sidekick Timmy Lenox, the book was in reality composed by Reilly in collaboration with writer Alice Alfonsi. According to the novel, Vincent was born on Christmas day. Alistair Crane arranges for Vincent to be killed, but the hitman places the baby into social services without his knowledge. In the series, Alistair does not order for Vincent's death, and instead kidnaps him as an infant to abuse him and turn him into a tool for his schemes to maintain control over the fictional town of Harmony. = 2004‚Äì2008: Passions = Vincent first appears in the December 16, 2004 episode as his alter-ego Valerie Davis. While working as an executive assistant to Crane Industries' vice president Theresa Lopez-Fitzgerald, Valerie is characterized through her connection with the Crane family and past sexual encounter with Chad Harris- Crane. Vincent had fabricated a backstory for Valerie to maintain the illusion that they were two separate people. Valerie joins Crane Industries to change its lack of minority employees. Initially appearing as a supporting character, Valerie helps Ivy Winthrop in her attempts to break up Fox Crane and Kay Bennett and supports Chad during their job. She gains more prominence when Eve catches her having sex with Julian; they engage in a catfight with Eve accusing Valerie of using sex to climb the corporate ladder. During this time, Whitney Russell suspects that Valerie is having an affair with Chad. Vincent is first seen outside of his split-personality when he introduces himself as a tabloid reporter at Chad and Whitney's wedding on December 26, 2006. Whitney sets up Vincent and Valerie as a couple without knowing they are in fact the same person. From 2006 to 2007, Vincent adopts the disguise of the \\"Blackmailer\\" to rape, murder, and blackmail several of the show's characters. Alistair (who was presumed dead at the time), had manipulated Vincent into performing these criminal actions. Vincent's first act as the \\"Blackmailer\\" is to repeatedly rape his paternal half-sister Fancy Crane; he frames Fancy's boyfriend Luis Lopez-Fitzgerald for the rapes by planting his semen inside her. After his maternal half-sister Simone Russell's girlfriend Rae Thomas learns the truth, he murders her and frames Luis for the crime. As the storyline progresses, Vincent begins to harbor an obsession with Theresa's love interest Ethan Winthrop and blackmails Judge JE Reilly into sentencing Luis to death by lethal injection. Vincent's aunt Sheridan Crane was the only person to identify him, but she keeps his secret on the sole condition that he brings her niece Pretty Crane back to Harmony to destroy Fancy's relationship with Luis. Vincent convinces Sheridan to kill Theresa with an electric chair, but she is interrupted by Theresa's rival Gwen Hotchkiss. In February 2007, Vincent is revealed to have been engaging in an incestuous and adulterous affair with Chad, which was cited as starting prior to the show's storyline in Rome in the summer of 2006. Chad is unaware that Vincent is Eve's child with Julian and his half-brother, making Vincent his half-uncle, adoptive half- cousin, and half-brother-in-law. Vincent blackmails Chad with secret videos of their sexual encounters. Furious with Chad for continuing to sleep with Whitney, Vincent engineers a scenario in which Whitney sees Vincent and Chad having sex in the back of a gay bar; Whitney immediately leaves Chad and Chad distances himself from Vincent. Chad informs Valerie of Vincent's infidelity after overhearing the two fight; Chad, as well as the viewer, is unaware that Vincent and Valerie are the same person. As the incest storyline progresses, Vincent reveals to Julian and Eve his secret identities as the \\"Blackmailer\\" and their son. For most of the series, Eve and Julian's child was believed to be Chad, who is later shown to be Eve's adoptive sister Liz Sanbourne's child from her rape by Alistair. Despite Julian's insistence that they protect their son and the Crane name, Eve tells the police that Vincent is the \\"Blackmailer\\" and Luis is set free moments before his execution. Vincent is then arrested and placed in psychiatric care. Alistair helps Vincent to escape, but hires assassin Spike Lester to murder him. Vincent is rescued by Sheridan and they escape Harmony by car while pursued by Spike. Vincent and Spike fall over the side of a cliff, and Sheridan can only save one of the two men. She chooses to save Spike after he reveals her son Marty is still alive. Vincent plummets to his (apparent) death on August 30, 2007. A few episodes later, Vincent emerges from the ocean and goes to Valerie's house to attack her off-screen for exposing his secrets. In the show's final episode on NBC on September 7, 2007, Valerie removes her mask to reveal she is in fact Vincent; it is strongly implied that Vincent has dissociative identity disorder. In November 2007, Vincent runs a blood test on himself after experiencing what appears to be symptoms of morning sickness and discovers he is pregnant. Eve inspects Vincent (who is dressed as Valerie) on November 22, 2007 and discovers his pregnancy and his true gender identity as intersex. Vincent torments Eve out of revenge for her failure to prevent his abduction when he was born and to prevent her from telling anyone that he was still alive and pregnant with Julian's child. After his psychopathic accomplice Viki Chatsworth severs Julian's penis, Vincent plies Eve with drugs and alcohol so she botches her attempt to surgically reattach Julian's penis; she reattaches it upside-down, and an erection might kill him. In May 2008, Eve and Julian assist Vincent with the birth of his son on the Russells' kitchen table after Eve explains everything about Vincent and Valerie to Julian. Eve plans to form a relationship again with Vincent (believing that motherhood has mellowed him), and convinces Julian not to turn him in to the police. During the rehearsal dinner for the joint weddings of Luis Lopez-Fitzgerald and Fancy Crane, Noah Bennett and Paloma Lopez-Fitzgerald, Miguel Lopez-Fitzgerald and Kay Bennett, and Edna Wallace and Norma Bates, Vincent and Viki kill all the guests with a poison mushroom sauce, but Tabitha gives up her powers and becomes a born again Christian in order to resurrect everyone. Vincent is last seen being arrested by Chief of Police Sam Bennett. Since T. C. Russell, Whitney, and Simone moved to New Orleans in 2007, Eve and Vincent are the only two members of the Russell family to appear in the series finale.  Reception and impact  alt=A figure wearing an outfit that is half red and half blue. The figure is wearing a mask that is split between a more masculine half and a more feminine half. The figure is pointing a knife towards an unknown target. Following the soap opera's cancellation, Vincent's arc was frequently cited as one of its most outrageous storylines. Ira Madison III of BuzzFeed noted the similarities between Vincent and Pretty Little Liars' Charlotte DiLaurentis, who was revealed to be a transgender woman who dated her own brother and operated under the disguise A. The reveal that Vincent was the \\"Blackmailer\\", Eve and Julian's son, and Valerie was cited as one of Passions' biggest twists by a writer from Soap Opera Digest. Joel McHale from E!'s weekly television series The Soup turned a scene in which Chad insisted he was \\"not gay\\" despite his affair with Vincent into a running gag by referring to the character as \\"Not Gay Chad\\". During the show's season five premiere, Divins made a cameo appearance on The Soup to explain that he was not his character and was neither gay nor having sex with transsexuals. Viewers were divided over the sexually explicit sequences between Chad and Vincent. Some felt the scenes between Chad and Vincent were \\"appalling\\" and inappropriate for daytime television, while one viewer praised the soap opera for \\"continu[ing] their outstanding jobs as they teach the people of today's world about daily life experiences\\". A writer from Soaps.com defended the show by pointing out graphic sex scenes between men and women were previously aired without complaint. Jeanmarie and Duplaix's performances received some positive critical responses. Giddens praised Jeanmarie for portraying Vincent as a believable character despite the sensationalism of his story arcs; he wrote: \\"If anyone on that show could have won an Emmy it was him.\\" Josh Robertson of Complex called Duplaix one of the most successful soap actresses, who had been a Playboy Playmate, for her performances as Valerie in thirty-four episodes of Passions, along with her portrayal of Rachel Gannon in ninety-five episodes of One Life to Live. = Racial and LGBT criticism = Passions made daytime history by being the first to depict two men having sex. However, the pairing of Chad and Vincent drew less media attention than the gay relationships in As the World Turns and One Life to Live. The incest storyline involving the two characters was described as \\"insanely convoluted\\" by Gawker's Kyle Buchanan, who felt it was one of \\"the most insane things that have ever happened on television\\". The plotline was praised by a writer from Soaps.com for reflecting the show's \\"unique perspective and zest for controversy\\" while challenging the \\"often too safe and predictable world of soaps\\". NewNowNext.com's Brent Hartinger approved of the story arc and felt that it increased the presence of LGBT people of color on daytime television. Ross von Metze of Edge Media Network commented that the show was \\"taking risks where other TV shows have failed\\". Mike Perigard of the Boston Herald was more critical of Vincent and the soap opera's treatment of LGBT characters. Perigard argued that Rae Thomas' death was timed alongside the reveal of Chad's affair with a man as a means to reduce the number of gay characters on the show. Several media outlets negatively responded to Vincent's identification as the \\"Blackmailer\\" and his relationship with Chad. Herndon L. Davis of Windy City Times was critical of the character's development, saying the soap opera \\"recklessly wrote a down-low storyline which involved an African-American man but eventually turned it into an outrageous intersex serial killer storyline\\". Perigard criticized the storyline as \\"just vile\\", and Ira Madison III called the representation of the character \\"horrifying and offensive\\".

History  The Ministry of Transport was created in 1905 during the Presidency of Rafael Reyes under the name of Ministerio de Obras P√∫blicas y Transporte or Ministry of Public Works and Transport with the main function of taking care of national assets issues, including mines, oil (fuel), patents and trade marks, railways, roads, bridges, national buildings and land not privately owned. In the early 20th century roads and highways maintenance and construction regulations were established. Rivers were cleaned, dragged and channeled and the navigational industry was organized. The Public works districts were created, as well as the Ferrocarriles Nacionales de Colombia (National Railways of Colombia). Among other major projects developed were the aqueduct of Bogot√°, La Regadera Dam and the Vitelma Water Treatment Plant. The Ministry also created the National Institute of Transit (from the Spanish Instituto Nacional de Tr√°nsito), (INTRA) under the Transport and tariffs Directorate and was in charge of designing the first National roads plan with the support of many foreign multinational construction companies.  Late 20th century  In the late 20th century the ministry introduced regulations to install tolls on highways in order to finance public works and the Highway Police was restructured to participate more actively in the vigilance and control of transportation matters. Ports of Colombia was created to build, maintain and control the maritime and fluvial ports of the country. The Neighbouring Roads Fund was established to supervise constructions, improve and maintain roads and bridges. The Ministry also created the National Roads Fund financed with resources generated from fuel taxes to finance other road works. In December 1993, the Colombian government restructured the entity seeking to improve it, formally naming it the Ministry of Transport. In the early year of 2000 the Ministry was once again subject of restructuring, this time receiving more autonomy to define, formulate and regulate transportation, transit and its infrastructure policies. In the last decade the Ministry has developed important projects; new roads and highways, tunnels and bridges, recovered some of the railway system, improved service and security in airports and maintains fluvial and maritime ways.

Background Norman Tait was born in Kincolith (Gingolx) on the Nass River in BC. His father Josiah Tait, was also a carver, and his great-grandfather was Chief Alfred Watson Mountain, Sganism Sim'oogit. His brothers Alver Tait and Robert \\"Chip\\" Tait was also an accomplished woodcarvers, as is his son Isaac. Tait was a member of the House of Luuya'as of the Laxsgiik (Eagle clan) and holds or has held the hereditary titles Na'ax-lax, Gawaakhl, and Naawootkw Lik'inskw lax galts'ap, the last meaning \\"Grizzly Bear Coming onto the Village.\\" Tait attended residential school in Alberta and later completed high school in Prince Rupert, British Columbia. Art career Totem at Vancouver Education College When he began carving in 1970, Tait sought out Nisga'a artifacts that he could study since there were no living Nisga'a master carvers for him to study. He worked with his father to raise the first Nisga'a totem pole in over 50 years. He later studied under the tutelage of the Haida carvers Freda Diesing and Gerry Marks. During his career as a carver, Tait carved 39 totem poles. Many of these stand in British Columbia, including poles in Port Edward, Lax Kw'alaams, and Alert Bay. Five of his poles are in Vancouver, including poles at the University of British Columbia, Stanley Park, Capilano Mall, and the Native Education Centre. In 1983, he carved the 16.5-metre (55-foot) pole at the entrance to the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. In 1992, Tait raised a totem in the Royal families Bushy Park in London, England. Tait raised a totem pole to commemorate the opening of the Nisga'a Lisims Government building in New Aiyansh, BC, \\"Goothl Lisims\\", which translates as \\"the heart of the Nass\\". He has also carved poles standing in Osaka, Japan, and Germany, as well as many private collections. Tait had a breakthrough in 1977 when the UBC Museum of Anthropology hosted a solo exhibit of 125 of his works. At the time, First Nations carvers were exhibited in group shows. Tait was known for the realistic detailing of his sculptured carving, moon masks, two-dimensional doors, and jewellery. Tait worked with his carving partner, Lucinda Turner. He began teaching Turner in 1991, and they subsequently collaborated on many carvings, including two major commissions for the Vancouver Stock Exchange. They also opened the working art gallery, Wilp's Tsaak Gallery: House of the Mischievous Man in West Vancouver. In 2015, the West Vancouver Museum held a retrospective on Tait's work, his first solo exhibition since 1977.

Beatty sequences are named after Samuel Beatty, who wrote about them in 1926. Rayleigh's theorem, named after Lord Rayleigh, states that the complement of a Beatty sequence, consisting of the positive integers that are not in the sequence, is itself a Beatty sequence generated by a different irrational number. Beatty sequences can also be used to generate Sturmian words. Definition A positive irrational number r generates the Beatty sequence :\\\\mathcal{B}_r = \\\\lfloor r \\\\rfloor, \\\\lfloor 2r \\\\rfloor, \\\\lfloor 3r \\\\rfloor,\\\\ldots If r > 1 \\\\,, then s = r/(r-1) is also a positive irrational number. These two numbers naturally satisfy the equation 1/r + 1/s = 1. The two Beatty sequences they generate, :\\\\mathcal{B}_r = ( \\\\lfloor nr \\\\rfloor)_{n\\\\geq 1} and :\\\\mathcal{B}_s = ( \\\\lfloor ns \\\\rfloor)_{n\\\\geq 1}, form a pair of complementary Beatty sequences. Here, \\"complementary\\" means that every positive integer belongs to exactly one of these two sequences. Examples When r is the golden mean, we have s = r + 1\\\\. In this case, the sequence ( \\\\lfloor nr \\\\rfloor), known as the lower Wythoff sequence, is * 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17, 19, 21, 22, 24, 25, 27, 29, ... . and the complementary sequence ( \\\\lfloor ns \\\\rfloor), the upper Wythoff sequence, is * 2, 5, 7, 10, 13, 15, 18, 20, 23, 26, 28, 31, 34, 36, 39, 41, 44, 47, ... . These sequences define the optimal strategy for Wythoff's game, and are used in the definition of the Wythoff array As another example, for r = , we have s = 2 + . In this case, the sequences are * 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 21, 22, 24, ... and * 3, 6, 10, 13, 17, 20, 23, 27, 30, 34, 37, 40, 44, 47, 51, 54, 58, ... . And for r = œÄ and s = œÄ/(œÄ ‚àí 1) the sequences are * 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 25, 28, 31, 34, 37, 40, 43, 47, 50, 53, ... and * 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24, 26, ... . Any number in the first sequence is absent in the second, and vice versa.  History  Beatty sequences got their name from the problem posed in the American Mathematical Monthly by Samuel Beatty in 1926. It is probably one of the most often cited problems ever posed in the Monthly. However, even earlier, in 1894 such sequences were briefly mentioned by John W. Strutt (3rd Baron Rayleigh) in the second edition of his book The Theory of Sound. Rayleigh theorem The Rayleigh theorem (also known as Beatty's theorem) states that given an irrational number r > 1 \\\\,, there exists s > 1 so that the Beatty sequences \\\\mathcal{B}_r and \\\\mathcal{B}_s partition the set of positive integers: each positive integer belongs to exactly one of the two sequences. =First proof= Given r > 1 \\\\,, let s = r/(r-1). We must show that every positive integer lies in one and only one of the two sequences \\\\mathcal{B}_r and \\\\mathcal{B}_s. We shall do so by considering the ordinal positions occupied by all the fractions j/r and k/s when they are jointly listed in nondecreasing order for positive integers j and k. To see that no two of the numbers can occupy the same position (as a single number), suppose to the contrary that j/r = k/s for some j and k. Then r/s = j/k, a rational number, but also, r/s = r(1 - 1/r) = r - 1, not a rational number. Therefore, no two of the numbers occupy the same position. For any j/r, there are j numbers i/r \\\\le j/r and \\\\lfloor js/r \\\\rfloor numbers k/s \\\\le j/r, so that the position of j/r in the list is j + \\\\lfloor js/r \\\\rfloor. The equation 1/r + 1/s = 1 implies : j + \\\\lfloor js/r \\\\rfloor = j + \\\\lfloor j(s - 1) \\\\rfloor = \\\\lfloor js \\\\rfloor. Likewise, the position of k/s in the list is \\\\lfloor kr \\\\rfloor. Conclusion: every positive integer (that is, every position in the list) is of the form \\\\lfloor nr \\\\rfloor or of the form \\\\lfloor ns \\\\rfloor, but not both. The converse statement is also true: if p and q are two real numbers such that every positive integer occurs precisely once in the above list, then p and q are irrational and the sum of their reciprocals is 1. =Second proof= _Collisions_ : Suppose that, contrary to the theorem, there are integers j > 0 and k and m such that :j = \\\\left\\\\lfloor {k \\\\cdot r} \\\\right\\\\rfloor = \\\\left\\\\lfloor {m \\\\cdot s} \\\\right\\\\rfloor \\\\,. This is equivalent to the inequalities :j \\\\le k \\\\cdot r < j + 1 \\\\text{ and } j \\\\le m \\\\cdot s < j + 1. For non-zero j, the irrationality of r and s is incompatible with equality, so :j < k \\\\cdot r < j + 1 \\\\text{ and } j < m \\\\cdot s < j + 1 which lead to :{j \\\\over r} < k < {j + 1 \\\\over r} \\\\text{ and } {j \\\\over s} < m < {j + 1 \\\\over s}. Adding these together and using the hypothesis, we get :j < k + m < j + 1 which is impossible (one cannot have an integer between two adjacent integers). Thus the supposition must be false. _Anti-collisions_ : Suppose that, contrary to the theorem, there are integers j > 0 and k and m such that :k \\\\cdot r < j \\\\text{ and } j + 1 \\\\le (k + 1) \\\\cdot r \\\\text{ and } m \\\\cdot s < j \\\\text{ and } j + 1 \\\\le (m + 1) \\\\cdot s \\\\,. Since j + 1 is non-zero and r and s are irrational, we can exclude equality, so :k \\\\cdot r < j \\\\text{ and } j + 1 < (k + 1) \\\\cdot r \\\\text{ and } m \\\\cdot s < j \\\\text{ and } j + 1 < (m + 1) \\\\cdot s. Then we get :k < {j \\\\over r} \\\\text{ and } {j + 1 \\\\over r} < k + 1 \\\\text{ and } m < {j \\\\over s} \\\\text{ and } {j + 1 \\\\over s} < m + 1 Adding corresponding inequalities, we get :k + m < j \\\\text{ and } j + 1 < k + m + 2 :k + m < j < k + m + 1 which is also impossible. Thus the supposition is false. Properties m \\\\in \\\\mathcal{B}_r if and only if : 1 - \\\\frac{1}{r} < \\\\left[ \\\\frac{m}{r} \\\\right]_1 where [x]_1 denotes the fractional part of x i.e., [x]_1 = x - \\\\lfloor x \\\\rfloor. Proof: m \\\\in B_r \\\\Leftrightarrow \\\\exists n, m = \\\\lfloor nr \\\\rfloor \\\\Leftrightarrow m < nr < m + 1 \\\\Leftrightarrow \\\\frac{m}{r} < n < \\\\frac{m}{r} + \\\\frac{1}{r} \\\\Leftrightarrow n - \\\\frac{1}{r} < \\\\frac{m}{r} < n \\\\Leftrightarrow 1 - \\\\frac{1}{r} < \\\\left[ \\\\frac{m}{r} \\\\right]_1 Furthermore, m = \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\left( \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{m}{r} \\\\right\\\\rfloor + 1 \\\\right) r \\\\right\\\\rfloor. Proof: m = \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\left( \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{m}{r} \\\\right\\\\rfloor + 1 \\\\right) r \\\\right\\\\rfloor \\\\Leftrightarrow m < \\\\left( \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{m}{r} \\\\right\\\\rfloor + 1 \\\\right) r < m + 1 \\\\Leftrightarrow \\\\frac{m}{r} < \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{m}{r} \\\\right\\\\rfloor + 1 < \\\\frac{m + 1}{r} \\\\Leftrightarrow \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{m}{r} \\\\right\\\\rfloor + 1 - \\\\frac{1}{r} < \\\\frac{m}{r} < \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{m}{r} \\\\right\\\\rfloor + 1 \\\\Leftrightarrow 1 - \\\\frac{1}{r} < \\\\frac{m}{r} - \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{m}{r} \\\\right\\\\rfloor =\\\\left[ \\\\frac{m}{r} \\\\right]_1 =Relation with Sturmian sequences= The first difference :\\\\lfloor (n+1)r\\\\rfloor-\\\\lfloor nr\\\\rfloor of the Beatty sequence associated with the irrational number r is a characteristic Sturmian word over the alphabet \\\\\\\\{\\\\lfloor r\\\\rfloor,\\\\lfloor r\\\\rfloor+1\\\\\\\\}.  Generalizations  If slightly modified, the Rayleigh's theorem can be generalized to positive real numbers (not necessarily irrational) and negative integers as well: if positive real numbers r and s satisfy 1/r + 1/s = 1, the sequences ( \\\\lfloor mr \\\\rfloor)_{m \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}} and ( \\\\lceil ns \\\\rceil -1)_{n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}} form a partition of integers. The Lambek‚ÄìMoser theorem generalizes the Rayleigh theorem and shows that more general pairs of sequences defined from an integer function and its inverse have the same property of partitioning the integers. Uspensky's theorem states that, if \\\\alpha_1,\\\\ldots,\\\\alpha_n are positive real numbers such that (\\\\lfloor k\\\\alpha_i\\\\rfloor)_{k,i\\\\ge1} contains all positive integers exactly once, then n\\\\le2. That is, there is no equivalent of Rayleigh's theorem to three or more Beatty sequences.J. V. Uspensky, On a problem arising out of the theory of a certain game, Amer. Math.

Biography Loretta Lynda Chekani was born in 1949 in a family of Albanian origin. She studied at New England public schools before receiving a bachelor's degree from Clark University, where she majored in English. Her past lives include clerical, administrative, and part-time teaching at Clark and a \\"Dickensian six-month experience\\" as a meter maid. After college, her first professional writing job was for an exhibition catalog. This led to a job moonlighting as a corporate video scriptwriter. During this time she met a video producer who enticed her to write novels...and eventually to marry him. Her first Regency manuscript, Isabella, was bought by the first New York editor who read it and led to a successful career as a romance author. Chase said of her marriage: \\"The books resulting from this union have won a surprising number of awards, including the Romance Writers of America RITA¬Æ Award.\\" Her books have also won several Romantic Times Reviewers' Choice awards, various RRA-L (Romance Readers Anonymous) awards, and the All About Romance Top 100 Romances award multiple times.

Their toxicity to dogs can cause the animal to develop acute kidney injury (the sudden development of kidney failure) with anuria (a lack of urine production). The phenomenon was first identified by the Animal Poison Control Center (APCC), run by the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA). Approximately 140 cases were seen by the APCC in the one year from April 2003 to April 2004, with 50 developing symptoms and seven dying. It is not clear that the observed cases of kidney failure following ingestion are due to grapes only. Clinical findings suggest raisin and grape ingestion can be fatal, but the mechanism of toxicity is still considered unknown. Cause and pathology The reason some dogs develop kidney failure following ingestion of grapes and raisins is not known. Types of grapes involved include both seedless and seeded, store-bought and homegrown, and grape pressings from wineries. A mycotoxin is suspected to be involved, but none has been found in grapes or raisins ingested by affected dogs. (Requires registration.) The dose-response relationship has not been determined, but one study estimated ‚â•3 g/kg for grapes or raisins. The most common pathological finding is proximal renal tubular necrosis. In some cases, an accumulation of an unidentified golden-brown pigment was found within renal epithelial cells. Clinical signs and diagnosis Vomiting and diarrhea are often the first clinical signs of grape or raisin toxicity. They often develop within a few hours of ingestion. Pieces of grapes or raisins may be present in the vomitus or stool. Further symptoms include weakness, not eating, increased drinking, and abdominal pain. Acute kidney failure develops within 48 hours of ingestion. A blood test may reveal increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, phosphorus, and calcium. Treatment Emesis (induction of vomiting) is the generally recommended treatment if a dog has eaten grapes or raisins within the past two hours. A veterinarian may use an emetic such as apomorphine to cause the dog to vomit. Further treatment may involve the use of activated charcoal to adsorb remaining toxins in the gastrointestinal tract and intravenous fluid therapy in the first 48 hours following ingestion to induce diuresis and help to prevent acute kidney failure. Vomiting is treated with antiemetics and the stomach is protected from uremic gastritis (damage to the stomach from increased BUN) with H2 receptor antagonists. BUN, creatinine, calcium, phosphorus, sodium, and potassium levels are closely monitored. Dialysis of the blood (hemodialysis) and peritoneal dialysis can be used to support the kidneys if anuria develops. Oliguria (decreased urine production) can be treated with dopamine or furosemide to stimulate urine production. The prognosis is guarded in any dog developing symptoms of toxicosis. A negative prognosis has been associated with oliguria or anuria, weakness, difficulty walking, and severe hypercalcemia (increased blood calcium levels).

Body The front end of the body was built by Mercedes-Benz as standard. So the Wright Cityranger, which was the main rival body to the Prisma for the O405 chassis in the UK, is very similar in styling to the Prisma.

He was also the first Texan to advocate agricultural teaching in state schools successfully. He is the namesake of Kyle Field, an American football stadium in College Station, TX, and his parents are the namesake of the suburban town of Kyle, Texas located fifteen miles south of Austin. Early years Kyle was born July 22, 1876 in Kyle, Texas to Captain Fergus Kyle and Anna Moore. His father was a Texas state legislator. Kyle attended various public and private schools before enrolling at the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas (now Texas A&M; University) in 1896. A high achiever, Kyle became the highest-ranking cadet in his junior class. In his senior year he served as \\"senior captain,\\" the highest rank in the Corps of Cadets, as well as class president and president of the YMCA. Due to an unexpected vacancy, Kyle became acting commandant for one month, becoming the only student to hold that position. This role also gave him voting privileges in faculty matters, something no other A&M; student has been granted. Kyle graduated with honors in 1899 as class valedictorian before attending Cornell University, where he received a B.S. degree in agriculture in 1901 and an M.S. in 1902. During his time at Cornell, Kyle was a founding member of Cornell's Alpha Zeta fraternity, and \\"was actively involved in the production of fruits and vegetables for the Pan-American Exposition of 1900.\\" and an honorary doctorate in agriculture from the University of Arkansas in 1949. Texas A&M; In 1902, Kyle returned to Texas A&M; as an instructor in the horticulture department. He quickly advanced to department head and was granted a full professorship in 1905. When the department became the School of Agriculture in 1911, Kyle was named its first dean. Committed to education as well as research, Kyle wrote prolifically about agriculture. His book, Fundamentals of Farming and Farm Life, was adopted by the state of Texas as a standard elementary textbook in 1912. Within 30 years this textbook had sold over half a million copies, \\"an enormous publication run for the era.\\" In the fall of 1904, Kyle, who was also the director of the General Athletics Association, wanted to secure and develop an athletic field to promote the school's athletics. Texas A&M; was unwilling to provide funds, so Kyle fenced off a section of the southeast corner of campus that had been assigned to him for agricultural use. Using $650 of his own money, he purchased the covered grandstand from the Bryan fairgrounds and built wooden bleachers to raise the seating capacity to 500 people. The students unofficially named the athletic field Kyle Field in his honor in 1908. Although Kyle resigned as head of the General Athletics Association when he became a dean, he remained involved with the improvements to the athletic field for many years. In 1941, Kyle toured Central and South America on behalf of the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs to study the agriculture economy. The following year the Texas Department of Agriculture appointed him as an official delegate to the second Inter-American Conference on Agriculture in Mexico. Government Kyle retired from Texas A&M; in 1944. For a brief period following his retirement, he served as the Director of the Farm Credit Administration at Houston. In January 1945 he was selected by U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt to be the American ambassador to Guatemala. Following his resignation in 1947, Guatemala awarded him the Order of the Quetzal, making him at the time the only American so honored. Later years In 1948, Kyle returned to Bryan, Texas, where he lived for the rest of his life. He died at his home on December 26, 1963.

Starting from the 4th year in secondary onwards, the school offers students IGCSE subjects from prominent organizations Cambridge and Edexcel and is an exam centre approved by both boards (thus is eligible to host examinations from these boards within its own campus). Students must take exams for all subjects they have studied at the end of the 5th year of secondary and each subject is assessed externally and independently by the board offering it. Starting from the 6th year of secondary onwards, students must do A-levels (subjects are again from Cambridge and Edexcel) and take examinations in both the 6th and 7th year of secondary school. There are three faculties on the campus, namely the secondary, primary, and early years school buildings, and each functions independently of the others with its own staff, students, rooms and equipment. In addition to the main school buildings, there are several secondary structures, such as numerous sports grounds, a multipurpose hall (used for theatre, presentations, examinations and in some cases sports), an amphitheatre (used for evacuations and ceremonies or special events) as well as the school's own parking grounds that can effectively hold upwards of 250 parked vehicles at any given time.

Hayes. Early life and education Elam was born near Hope in Hempstead County in southwestern Arkansas, to William Jefferson Elam, a teacher, and his wife, the former Cynthia Wheaton, both from Virginia. The Elam family moved in 1823 to Ayish Bayou near San Augustine in East Texas, where another son, Charles Wheaton Elam, was born. In 1826, the Elams relocated to Natchitoches, Louisiana, where Mary Jane Elam, was born. By 1833, the family moved to Fort Jessup, Louisiana, the westernmost outpost of the United States at that time. William Elam tutored the officers' sons. Another son, John Waddill Elam, was born at Fort Jesup in 1833. There was also a daughter, Henrietta Elam. The Elam children were educated at Fort Jessup. Later, Joseph Elam read law with his cousin John Waddill in Alexandria, Louisiana. In 1853, Waddill helped obtain freedom of Solomon Northup, a kidnapped man from New York and the subject of the film, Twelve Years a Slave, who had been sold into slavery in Louisiana. Northup had been held for twelve years as a slave in the Red River region. Under its 1841 law, the state of New York commissioned an attorney to help find and free the kidnapped man.Solomon Northup, Twelve Years a Slave, edited by Sue Eakin Elam was admitted to the bar in October 1843 and began his practice in Alexandria. He moved in 1844 to Sabine Parish and settled in the parish seat of Many. Political career Elam helped to establish the court system in DeSoto Parish, where on August 7, 1843, he made his first court appearance as an attorney. In 1845, Elam was elected to the Sabine Parish Police Jury, the parish governing body. He was the jury president from 1846 to 1847. Elam also served as the district attorney of Sabine Parish. In 1847, Elam drafted the articles for incorporation for the town of Mansfield, and was elected as its first mayor.Act No. 128, General Assembly of Louisiana 1847 He served as mayor a second time in 1856. He was also a Mansfield alderman. Elam was elected to the Louisiana House of Representatives from DeSoto Parish. He served as the House Speaker from 1862 to 1864. His brother, John Waddill Elam, was elected sheriff of DeSoto Parish. In 1861, Elam was elected a delegate to the Confederate Constitutional Convention and signed the Louisiana Ordinance of Secession on January 26, 1861. In November 1865, he was elected as a state representative in the post-civil war Reconstruction legislature; this tenure is not reflected in the website, \\"Membership of the Louisiana House of Representatives, 1812-2016.\\" Elam served in the state legislature until the passage in 1867 by Congress of the Reconstruction Acts.Official Journal of the House of Representatives, State of Louisiana, 1861-1867 Elam attended the National Union Convention as a delegate from Louisiana in 1866.The New York Times August 13, 1866 During Reconstruction, the Radical Republicans took control of Louisiana, and Elam was temporarily disfranchised under the Louisiana Constitution of 1868, which prevented former officers of the Confederacy from running for office for a limited period. When in 1870, section 99 of this Constitution was repealed, Elam was allowed again to seek office. Because of violence and intimidation associated with elections, conducted in part by the Ku Klux Klan trying to suppress black and other Republican voting, the Radicals passed legislation in 1870 to establish \\"returning boards,\\" which were authorized to review elections and dismiss results from ones in which fraud was committed. That year, the U. S. Congress passed the Force Act, intended to aid in suppressing the power of the KKK in the South. Elam was denied office in 1870, 1872 and 1874 by the returning boards. In 1870, Elam stopped a riot by speaking to and calming a crowd after an election was taken from him, and did the same in 1872.Biographical history of Northwest Louisiana The Wheeler Adjustment, passed by the Louisiana legislature in March 1875, did not allow Elam to take his Louisiana State Senate seat for the 1874 election.Handbook of Politics for 1876, Edward McPherson, Solomons & Chapman, 1876, p. 200 The elections continued to be marked by violence by the White League, a paramilitary group that supported the Democratic Party, disrupted Republican gatherings and worked to suppress black voting.George C. Rable, But There Was No Peace: The Role of Violence in the Politics of Reconstruction, Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1984, p. 132 In 1876, Elam, a secessionist and former Confederate state legislator, was elected to the United States Congress in the Forty-fifth Congress. A national political compromise of that year allowed him and other Democrats to take office, along with the accession of Republican Rutherford Hayes as President. Elam was reelected to the Forty-sixth Congress for Louisiana's 4th district.Biographical Directory of the United States Congress, pp. 197, 201 During his reelection campaign of 1878, Elam was severely injured in a stagecoach accident.\\"Representative Elam injured\\", Shreveport Times, October 1878.

Personal life Elam was twice widowed and had eight children by his third wife, Harriet Spencer Elam. Son Charles Wheaton Elam, the brother of Joseph Elam, Jr., served in the Louisiana House from 1892 to 1896, and Joseph Barton Elam, Jr., was the mayor of Mansfield from 1914 to 1920. His younger sister, Henrietta Elam, married William B. Spencer, who was elected to the United States House of Representatives in the 1870s for Louisiana's 5th congressional district.

The southwest entrance to this channel was seen by Eduard Dallmann, leader of the German 1873-74 expedition, who named it Roosen Channel. The Belgian Antarctic Expedition, 1897‚Äì99, under Gerlache, sailed through the channel and named it for Georg von Neumayer. The second name has been approved because of more general usage. Neumayer Channel is known for its majestic cliffs, an attraction for tourists who come to the region. It is said to be like a maze with no visible exits because of its inverted S-shape. Its entrance and exits both have sharp bends. Geology The Neumayer Channel Tectonic Block is bounded by the Neumayer Fault and the Fournier Fault, which are parallel SW-NE trending strike-slip faults.

The Society was founded as a result of a letter from the Earl of Rosebery (later to serve as Prime Minister, from 1894‚Äì95), published in The Scotsman on 3 February 1886, and Rosebery became the first President of the Society. The first president of the Society defined its work as \\"the humble and unobtrusive task of letting everyman know, in so far as in us lies, and so far as documentary evidence exists, how our forebears lived and worked and carried on the business of their country in their separate spheres.\\" The Society has a council of scholars representing most of the universities in Scotland and some beyond, as well as other institutions. History of the society The Scottish History Society was founded with the object of discovery and publication, under selected editorship, of unpublished documents illustrative of the civil, religious, and social history of Scotland. The first publications, in October 1887, were Bishop Pococke's Tours in Scotland, 1747-1760, edited by D W Kemp, and the Diary of and General Expenditure Book of William Cunningham of Craigends, 1673‚Äì1680, edited by the Reverend James Dodds, D.D. By 1900, 65 Public Libraries subscribed for the society's publications. Amongst some of its notable members have been Sir James Balfour Paul, Lord Lyon King of Arms, and Emeritus Professor David Masson, Historiographer Royal for Scotland. Since its foundation the SHS has produced an increasing number of vital records hitherto unavailable to scholars of Scottish history, and in this the SHS have provided an invaluable service to the nation. President of the society In 1900, the President was the Earl of Rosebery. In 1970, the President was Professor Gordon Donaldson. Other Presidents have included the novelist and politician John Buchan, 1st Baron Tweedsmuir and Dr Jenny Wormald. The current president is Professor Roger Mason of the University of St Andrews.

A small fleet of dedicated executive government transport aircraft are organised into two RCAF squadrons. Other RCAF combat and transport helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft, chartered civilian aircraft, and occasionally scheduled commercial flights may also be used to meet Canada's VIP air transport requirements. History Members of the Royal Family have been flying in the United Kingdom since two Westland Wapitis were delivered to the Royal Air Force's No. 24 Squadron at RAF Northolt in April 1928. Between the following year and 1935, Prince Edward, Prince of Wales, himself purchased 13 aircraft; he became the first member of the Royal Family to be a pilot and, when he ascended to the throne in 1936 as King Edward VIII, the King's Flight was formed as the world's first head of state aircraft unit. Challenger 601 used as a VIP transport by the Royal Canadian Air Force Staff prepare meals for Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, aboard a Canadian Forces Air Command CC-150 Polaris Royal Flight, en route to the Queen's engagements for her Golden Jubilee in 2002 Executive air transport in Canada can be traced to the formation of the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) in the 1920s; the only VIP death in the history of the RCAF was Minister of National Defence Norman McLeod Rogers on 10 June 1940, near Newtonville, Ontario. The RCAF maintained aircraft such as the Lockheed Lodestar, Canadair North Star, Canadair CL-66, and Canadair CL-44-6 until, following the 1968 unification of the country's three armed forces branches into the Canadian Forces, long range VIP transport was carried out using a modified Boeing 707 designated as the CC-137 Husky and short range VIP transport used various combat fixed and rotary wing aircraft. Dedicated VIP transport aircraft did not enter the Canadian Forces until the early 1980s, when 12 CL-600S Challenger business jets were purchased by the Governor General-in-Council from Canadair, which were thereafter given the designations CC-144, CE-144, and CX-144, and painted in the contemporary red and white livery of the Canadian Forces. These jets flew with 414 \\"Black Knight\\" Squadron at CFB North Bay until July 1992, and with 434 \\"Blue Nose\\" Squadron at CFB Greenwood until May 2000, when eight aircraft were either sold or retired, the remaining two being transferred to 412 Transport Squadron for dedicated executive transport, where the livery was changed to a dark Air Force blue. At times, the use of executive air transport has been a contentious issue. In 2002, the Governor General-in-Council, on the advice of Prime Minister Jean Chr√©tien, purchased an additional two Challenger jets for exclusive royal, viceroyal, and ministerial transport. Use of these planes by ministers of the Crown came under heavy criticism, partly due to the high cost of operation approximately CAD$11,000 per hour as well as questions over prioritisation of other military aircraft procurement. Government ministers have typically explained that the use of the Challenger jets is necessary due to time constraints and/or security issues. Also, Governor General Adrienne Clarkson had used a chartered aircraft to fly from Ottawa to her cottage in Muskoka, Ontario, and it was later revealed that Governor General Micha√´lle Jean was flown to The Bahamas on a Canadian Forces Challenger. Both times, the press reports of these actions brought criticism towards the viceroys from some corners; however, the governor general's mode of transport is directed by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Present arrangements CC-150 Polaris No. 001 in 2014 Royal Canadian Air Force CC-150 Polaris at Yellowknife Airport, transporting Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, July 2011 All dedicated VIP transport aircraft in the Canadian Forces are operated by 437 Transport Squadron and 412 Transport Squadron. Attendants on flights operated by these squadrons are select volunteers from various services in the Canadian Forces and serve in their posting for two or three years; they must undergo an intensive training period and additional security background checks prior to VIP transport duty. The 437 Transport Squadron, based at CFB Trenton, operates five Airbus A310-300s, all designated as CC-150 Polaris; four are configured as normal airliners with cargo transport and aerial refuelling capability, while one, No. 001, is operated in a VIP configuration. This latter aircraft, known officially as Can Force Onehttp://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/can-force-one-replacement-1.4558838, and referred to as the Royal Flight when carrying the Queen or another member of the Royal Family, has a galley, spartan bedroom (wall panels added to provide privacy with small bed and sofa),https://stateceremony.wordpress.com/category/air-transport/ sitting room, office space, and a shower approximately the size of a small phone booth. The executive suite includes a satellite telephone, two computer work stations, and a small refrigerator, and at the rear portion of the aircraft is a normal passenger cabin, used to carry regular military passengers, members of the VIP party, or reporters. The squadron's information officer stated of the interior in 1997: \\"It's no more luxurious than a good motor home.\\" 412 Transport Squadron, based at Macdonald-Cartier International Airport (formerly CFB Ottawa, and previously at CFB Uplands), is the only RCAF unit dedicated exclusively to executive transport and currently operates Canada's four CC-144-designated Bombardier Challenger 601 business jets in a VIP configuration.

This timeline of chemistry lists important works, discoveries, ideas, inventions, and experiments that significantly changed humanity's understanding of the modern science known as chemistry, defined as the scientific study of the composition of matter and of its interactions. The history of chemistry in its modern form arguably began with the Irish scientist Robert Boyle, though its roots can be traced back to the earliest recorded history. Early ideas that later became incorporated into the modern science of chemistry come from two main sources. Natural philosophers (such as Aristotle and Democritus) used deductive reasoning in an attempt to explain the behavior of the world around them. Alchemists (such as Geber and Rhazes) were people who used experimental techniques in an attempt to extend the life or perform material conversions, such as turning base metals into gold. In the 17th century, a synthesis of the ideas of these two disciplines, that is the deductive and the experimental, leads to the development of a process of thinking known as the scientific method. With the introduction of the scientific method, the modern science of chemistry was born. Known as \\"the central science\\", the study of chemistry is strongly influenced by, and exerts a strong influence on, many other scientific and technological fields. Many events considered central to our modern understanding of chemistry are also considered key discoveries in such fields as physics, biology, astronomy, geology, and materials science to name a few. Pre-17th century Aristotle (384‚Äì322 BCE) Zosimus c. 300, from Marcelin Berthelot, Collection des anciens alchimistes grecs (3 vol., Paris, 1887‚Äì88) Geber (d. 815) is considered by some to be the \\"father of chemistry\\". Prior to the acceptance of the scientific method and its application to the field of chemistry, it is somewhat controversial to consider many of the people listed below as \\"chemists\\" in the modern sense of the word. However, the ideas of certain great thinkers, either for their prescience, or for their wide and long-term acceptance, bear listing here. ;c. 3000 BC: Egyptians formulate the theory of the Ogdoad, or the \\"primordial forces\\", from which all was formed. These were the elements of chaos, numbered in eight, that existed before the creation of the sun. ;c. 1200 BC: Tapputi-Belatikallim, a perfume-maker and early chemist, was mentioned in a cuneiform tablet in Mesopotamia. ;c. 450 BC: Empedocles asserts that all things are composed of four primal elements: earth, air, fire, and water, whereby two active and opposing forces, love and hate, or affinity and antipathy, act upon these elements, combining and separating them into infinitely varied forms. ;c. 440 BC: Leucippus and Democritus propose the idea of the atom, an indivisible particle that all matter is made of. This idea is largely rejected by natural philosophers in favor of the Aristotlean view (see below). ;c. 360 BC: Plato coins term ‚Äòelements‚Äô (stoicheia) and in his dialogue Timaeus, which includes a discussion of the composition of inorganic and organic bodies and is a rudimentary treatise on chemistry, assumes that the minute particle of each element had a special geometric shape: tetrahedron (fire), octahedron (air), icosahedron (water), and cube (earth). ;c. 350 BC: Aristotle, expanding on Empedocles, proposes idea of a substance as a combination of matter and form. Describes theory of the Five Elements, fire, water, earth, air, and aether.

He played as a midfielder, most often on the right wing. As a 16-year-old, Kirby went to England to join Premier League club Aston Villa. He spent four years with the club without making a first-team appearance, and returned to his native Waterford. He signed for League of Ireland Premier Division club Waterford United in 1999, and two-and-a-half years later moved on to Longford Town. During his six seasons with Longford, Kirby won two FAI Cups, in 2003 and 2004, and the 2004 League of Ireland Cup, and was nominated for the 2003 PFAI Players' Player of the Year award. Two League runners-up medals in two years with St Patrick's Athletic preceded a third FAI Cup win and promotion from the First Division with Sporting Fingal. He won his fourth FAI Cup and third League runners-up medal in 2011 with Sligo Rovers, and retired from playing after one last season with Longford Town in 2012. Kirby made sixteen appearances in the UEFA Cup and UEFA Europa League, six each for Longford Town and St Patrick's Athletic, and two each for Sporting Fingal and Sligo Rovers. Kirby was capped for Ireland at levels from under-16 to under-21, and was a member of the under-20 team that won the bronze medal at the 1997 FIFA World Youth Championship. He played for the League of Ireland XI that faced Manchester United in a match to mark the opening of the Aviva Stadium in 2010. Personal life Kirby was born in Waterford, the son of former Waterford United player and assistant manager Dave Kirby and his wife Angela. He married Caitriona Norton, and , the couple had two daughters, Leah and Lauren. Kirby started a degree in business studies at Dublin City University in 2007, alongside his football career. After completing his studies, he began a career in tax consultancy in Dublin. Club career =Early career= As a youngster, Kirby played for Johnville in the Waterford Schoolboys League. In the summer of 1994, as a 16-year-old, he went to England to join Premier League club Aston Villa. He was a regular in the youth team for two seasons, made his debut for the reserves in the 1995‚Äì96 season, and played not infrequently at that level for a further two years. =Waterford United= Kirby returned to Ireland and signed for Waterford United in January 1999, and made his League of Ireland debut against Bohemians at the Waterford Regional Sports Centre on 29 January. His first senior goal opened the scoring as Waterford beat Dundalk 2‚Äì0 on 16 April, and his second, a \\"glorious 20-yard volley that simply flew past\\" the goalkeeper, was the only goal of the game against fellow relegation candidates Bray Wanderers a few days later and made a significant contribution to Waterford retaining their Premier Division status. Available on a free transfer at the end of the season, Kirby returned to England for a trial with Hartlepool United which came to nothing. He rejoined Waterford for the 1999‚Äì2000 League of Ireland season, but the club struggled to score, finished tenth in the league, and had to play off against Kilkenny City for a place in the next season's Premier Division. Waterford lost the first leg 1‚Äì0, and their ill-fortune in front of goal continued in the second. Kirby shot against the post in the first half, and missed a chance in the second, and Derek McGrath missed a late penalty, to leave Waterford in the First Division with only three contracted players, of which Kirby himself was one. Kirby helped Waterford reach the semi-final of the FAI Cup in 2000‚Äì01. In the quarter-final, his shot was pushed over the bar by a Cobh Ramblers defender, and he converted the resulting penalty to give Waterford a 1‚Äì0 win. The semi- final, against Longford Town, went to a replay. Kirby came close to scoring, and was named man of the match as he had been in the quarter-final, but the tie was settled by a penalty kick in favour of Longford. He was named in the PFAI First Division Team of the Year for 2001, and shortlisted for the First Division Player of the Year award. Waterford offered Kirby a new contract but he was reluctant to spend another season in the First Division. Amid interest from Cork City and Longford Town, Kirby found himself at the centre of a disagreement between the PFAI and the League surrounding an agreement that out-of-contract players aged 24 or over can transfer to another club for free under the Bosman ruling, but that a fee would be due for under-24s. The PFAI argued that Kirby could move on a free as soon as he turned 24, on 8 September, but the League's view was that the age should be taken at 1 January. The League's view clearly prevailed, because when Kirby and teammate Alan Reynolds signed two-year contracts with Premier Division club Longford Town, Reynolds moved on a free, but the fee for Kirby was to be determined by tribunal. He had attracted the attention of manager Stephen Kenny when the clubs met in the FAI Cup semifinal earlier in the year. =Longford Town= Kirby made his debut in the FAI Super Cup pre-season tournament, and scored twice on the opening day of the league season in a 4‚Äì1 defeat of Cork City. He played in the club's first appearances in European competition, the qualifying round of the 2001‚Äì02 UEFA Cup, against Litex Lovech, which Longford lost in stoppage time in the second leg in Bulgaria. Kirby scored six goals from 40 appearances in all competitions as Longford finished ninth in the League. The Premier Division was to drop from twelve to ten teams for the transitional 2002‚Äì03 League of Ireland season, so Longford had to play-off against First Division runners-up Finn Harps to retain their top-flight status. The scores were level after two legs, and Longford won 6‚Äì5 on penalties. Kirby was ever- present during the 2002‚Äì03 season, scoring three times as Longford finished fifth. They reached the 2003 League of Ireland Cup Final via a 90th-minute equaliser against Derry City followed by the winner in the last minute of extra time, when Kirby's free kick struck the post and Alan Murphy converted the rebound. St Patrick's Athletic goalkeeper Chris Adamson made \\"the save of the night\\" from Kirby towards the end of the final, which Longford lost by a single goal when Barry Ferguson missed a penalty with the last kick of the game. They went one better against the same opponents in the FAI Cup Final. Playing at Lansdowne Road, on a bigger pitch that allowed the wingers more space, Kirby fed Sean Francis to open the scoring, as Longford went on to beat St Pat's 2‚Äì0 to win the first senior trophy in their history. His performance over the season earned him a nomination for the PFAI Player of the Year award, but he lost out to Shelbourne's Jason Byrne. Kirby made more appearances than any other Longford player as the club trebled its trophy collection in 2004. In the League Cup Final, the Daily Mirror wrote that he made clever use of the ball on the right wing, and came close to scoring a \\"wonder goal\\" when he dribbled past a couple of defenders but then shot wide. Longford had the better of most of the game, but were under pressure at the end, eventually holding on to beat Bohemians 2‚Äì1. Longford were a goal behind after 86 minutes in the 2004 FAI Cup Final against Kirby's home-town club Waterford when his \\"stunning shot\\" tied the scores. Controversially, the goal was scored while a Waterford defender was clearing a stray football from the pitch. Longford's winner came a few seconds later. Kirby was left with mixed feelings. While pleased to have scored only his second goal of the season, and recognising the importance of the win to his current club, he had decided ahead of the game that he would not celebrate if he did score, and felt \\"a little gutted\\" for his former colleagues. He turned down a move to Drogheda United, who reportedly offered to triple his wages, to sign a new two-year contract on improved terms with Longford. In 2004, Longford had given Liechtenstein's FC Vaduz their first ever European win, in the UEFA Cup qualifying rounds. In the 2005 competition, they took a 2‚Äì0 first-leg lead against Welsh club Carmarthen Town; the second goal was scored by Ferguson from Kirby's cross. In the second leg, Carmarthen's opener was equalised from the penalty spot, but they then scored four times in the second half to eliminate Longford and give Kirby what he describes as \\"the lowest moment of my career\\". He is one of three men to have played in all six, , of Longford's appearances in UEFA competition. Kirby was the only ever-present for Longford in 2006, and was also their leading goalscorer, but with just six goals. This took his figures to 24 goals from 235 games in all competitions for Longford as his contract expired at the end of the season. With the club's budget set to be reduced further, Kirby was one of several players to leave. He signed for St Patrick's Athletic in December 2006; the season preview in the Irish Independent saw \\"the capture of Alan Kirby [as] a particular coup.\\" =St Patrick's Athletic= While at Longford, Kirby had worked full-time for the club's sponsors as assistant to the site engineer on a building site, but was allowed to leave early on training evenings. At St Pat's, he was a full-time footballer. He was named Player of the Month for March, cited as central to St Pat's unbeaten start to the season. Pat's began the season with Kirby, Keith Fahey and Joseph Ndo in a central three in midfield; their \\"interchanging of passing and movement is excellent\\", according to Bohemians' manager Sean Connor. But an injury to Ndo, combined with Kirby's absences through injury and suspension, meant a switch to a 4‚Äì4‚Äì2 formation, with more workmanlike players in the centre and the flair and creativity of Fahey and Kirby pushed out to the wings; this coincided with a mid-season slump. Kirby was controversially rested for the first leg of the UEFA Cup tie against Odense, a goalless draw; manager John McDonnell cited concerns about the player becoming \\"burnt out\\" by playing too many matches. He was brought back for the second leg, in which St Pat's were outclassed 5‚Äì0. Both player and club revived; Kirby scored four goals from 28 league appearances, as his club finished in second place. St Pat's beat Latvian club Olimps and IF Elfsborg of Sweden in the qualifying rounds of the 2008‚Äì09 UEFA Cup. Kirby was an unused substitute in the first leg against Elfsborg, and a hard-working substitute as St Pat's scored two late goals to go through on aggregate. He started on the left of midfield in both legs against Hertha Berlin; despite the 2‚Äì0 away defeat, he described that as \\"the best trip so far\\" of his five UEFA Cup campaigns. St Pat's repeated their second-place league finish in 2008, but Kirby was \\"a little disappointed\\" by his personal season. He would have preferred to play more than he didhe started 18 of the 36 league matchesand was led to expect a new contract which, in the club's straitened financial circumstances, failed to materialise. Amid general economic uncertainty, he was appreciative of an offer from Liam Buckley to join Sporting Fingal for their second season in the league. =Sporting Fingal= The Fingal Independent labelled him a \\"big name signing\\" who was \\"regarded as a consummate professional by commentators in the game\\". The club's commitment to supporting players wanting to further their education allowed him to continue his studies alongside his football: \\"I'm in DCU, doing a degree in business, which I'm halfway through. I can come in and train, then go on to college and catch up on any lectures I've missed and stay as late as I want in the library.\\" In that season's FAI Cup, Kirby scored twice in the quarter-final against Shamrock Rovers, and in the semifinal, against Bray Wanderers, he set up his club's first goal, was involved in the second, and scored the third, before leaving the field through injury. Fingal finished third in the First Division, and beat Shelbourne and Bray Wanderers in the playoffs to earn promotion to the Premier Division after only two years in the League. Kirby was a late substitute in the second leg of the final, having missed the earlier matches with a foot injury, and won his third FAI Cup-winners' medal as an unused substitute, as Sporting Fingal beat Sligo Rovers with two late goals. Kirby signed another one-year contract for the 2010 season. He was a less frequent member of the starting eleven, but still took the field in 31 of the 36 League matches as Fingal finished fifth and qualified for the UEFA Cup. In August, he was chosen for the League of Ireland XI to face Manchester United in a match to mark the official opening of the Aviva Stadium. United captain John O'Shea said afterwards he \\"was glad to see Kirbs getting a game as he's such a dedicated player, for the league and for Ireland\\". =Later career= Kirby was one of many players to volunteer for the PFAI team to take part in the FIFPro Scandinavian Tournament in January 2011, a regular event featuring out-of-contract players from summer leagues, but did not make the squad. Liam Buckley planned to speak to him about returning to Sporting Fingal, but at the end of the month, Kirby signed a one-year contract with Sligo Rovers. He scored six times in 31 league appearances as Sligo finished second in the Premier Division, and collected his fourth FAI Cup-winners' medal, again as an unused substitute, as Sligo beat Shelbourne on penalties at the Aviva Stadium. When no new contract was forthcoming at Sligo, and recognising he was approaching the end of the career, Kirby was happy to return to Longford Town for the 2012 season. Together with fellow veteran Keith Gillespie, he lent experience to the squad, helping Longford to a third-place finish and a playoff against Waterford United. Replacing Gillespie towards the end of the playoff second leg, with Waterford 3‚Äì0 ahead on aggregate, Kirby scored his last goal in senior football in his home town against his first senior club. He had announced his retirement from football before the game. In his two spells with Longford, he scored 29 goals from 264 appearances in all competitions. International career Kirby was capped for Ireland under-16s while a Johnville player in 1994. He was a member of the under-18 team that qualified for the 1996 UEFA Youth Championship finals in Luxembourg, and played in the finals. Ireland finished third in their group, so qualified for the 1997 FIFA World Youth Championship in Malaysia. Kirby was an unused substitute for Ireland's opening fixture, against Ghana, but played in their remaining matches as they became the first Irish side at any level to reach the semifinal of a major tournament. Played in by Robbie Ryan early in the match, Kirby shot straight at the goalkeeper when he should have scored, and Colin Hawkins headed wide from his cross with only a few minutes left, as Ireland lost 1‚Äì0 to Argentina in the semifinal. He was a first-half substitute as Ireland defeated Ghana in the third-place match to win the bronze medal. Those two matches were televised live in Ireland, and the players became well known as their progress was followed by RT√â's magazine programme The Soccer Show. Kirby made his only appearance at under-21 level as a substitute in a 3‚Äì0 defeat against the Czech Republic in March 1998. Style of play According to Kirby's profile on the St Patrick's Athletic website, he \\"can play anywhere across the midfield and chips in with his fair share of goals.\\" He has been used most often as a right-sided winger, though he said he liked playing in the centre of midfield because on the wing, \\"sometimes the game will pass you by and you're relying on other people to get you into the game.\\" Ahead of the 1997 FIFA World Youth Championship semifinal, manager Brian Kerr was reportedly considering using him in a man-marking role. In 2001, Kirby's Waterford manager Paul Power described him as a quick, skilful player suited to the team's counter-attacking style. Later that year, his Longford teammate Stuart Byrne assessed him as \\"deceptively quick and tricky and goes past people as if they aren't there at times\\", mentioning how his ability to \\"take defenders on and get balls into the box ... has definitely given us an extra outlet\\", and the Galway Advertiser wrote that his \\"blistering pace is an invaluable asset when his side is on the break.\\" He combined creativity with industry. The Sun player ratings of the World Youth Championship semifinal called him \\"another of the Republic's workhorses yesterday. ... he sped the ball around with accuracy and put in a busy useful 90 minutes\\". An RT√â match report in 2008 claimed that \\"the workrate and creativity of Pat's centre midfield pairing of Alan Kirby and Keith Fahey can't be underestimated\\". And the Sligo Champion preview of a 2011 FAI Cup quarter-final summed him up as \\"a tireless worker with an eye for a defence splitting pass and an ability to ghost into dangerous attacking positions\\".

Background David Anthony Neel was born on April 7, 1960 in Vancouver, British Columbia. He is a Canadian multi-media artist from Fort Rupert, British Columbia, known for his ability to work in number of media. He trained as a professional photographer in the United States for several years before returning to Vancouver in 1987. This was a turning point as he soon began working in the style of his father's people, the Kwakwaka'wakw. From 1987 to 1989, he apprenticed with Kwakwaka'wakw carvers, Beau Dick and Wayne Alfred. He was following in the footsteps of his late father, Dave Neel Sr. (1937‚Äì1961), who was trained by his mother, Ellen Neel (1916‚Äì1966), who was trained by her uncle, Mungo Martin (1881‚Äì1962) and her grandfather, Charlie James (1875‚Äì1938). In this way he was carrying on a long-standing family tradition. Native American dug-out canoe in Venice, Italy Artwork In the 1990s he went on to develop a highly personalized and controversial style of carving, using masks to comment and editorialize contemporary history and society. He came to believe that \\"tradition is a foundation to build upon, not a set of rules to restrain creativity.\\" Examples of these masks are the \\"Mask of International Commerce,\\" which was exhibited in London, England for the Royal Opening of Canada House, and the \\"Mask of the Injustice System,\\" which was exhibited at the 1999 Venice Biennale.Szeemann, Harald and Cecilia Liveriero Lavelli. La Biennale di Venezia: 48a Esposizione internazionale d'arte. Venice: La Biennale di Venezia, 1999: 249 (retrieved through Google Books, 27 May 2009). For the Biennale, Neel exhibited his contemporary masks in a site-specific installation and did a performance on the Grand Canal using his 26-foot dugout canoe, the \\"Walas-Kwis-Gila\\" (Travels Great Distances). Following the publication of The Great Canoes in 1995, he carved two canoes; a 26-foot and 32-foot, which were used on a number of canoe journeys. Also in the 1990s Neel produced a number of limited edition prints, some of traditional Kwakwaka'wakw subjects and others of dealing with contemporary history, much like the masks. The best known of these is Life on the 18th Hole, which portrays a Mohawk warrior from the 1990 Oka Crisis in Quebec, Canada. His original media, photography, resulted in two books about Native culture: Our Chiefs and Elders in 1992 and The Great Canoes in 1995. Like the prints and masks, these also dealt with contemporary Native history. He continued to work as a professional photographer, specializing in contemporary Native people. Major commissions include a series of portraits for the National Museum of the American Indian, New York, New York in 1992, and a permanent installation of his portraits in the Mashantucket Pequot Museum, Groton, Connecticut (2001‚Äì2008). In 1991 he began hand engraving jewelry in the Kwakwaka'wakw style, working in silver, gold and platinum. From 1998 to 2000 he did a series of elaborate gold and silver boxes, inspired by traditional bentwood cedar chests. He continues to work in jewelry, working primarily with gold and diamonds. His work came full circle in 2000 when he began painting on canvas, the media of choice of his late father. The paintings, oil and acrylic paint on canvas, originally dealt with traditional legends in a highly personalized style. Following this series he evolved into abstractions and later stylized depictions of masks from museum collections. Neel continues to be an active artist, working primarily in jewelry and painting. Honors In both 1987 and 1988, Neel earned the Mungo Martin Memorial Award. In 1991 Canada Council Explorations provided him with a grant for his Contemporary Mask Series. The Smithsonian Institution awarded him a Community Scholar Grant in 1992.David Neel (Tlat'lala'wis') , 1960‚Äì. The Internet Public Library: Native American Authors Project.

Chantry Island is famous as being the alleged place of arrest of Saint Alban, the first Christian Martyr in what is now the United Kingdom. The local legend associated with the island is that Saint Alban (or \\"Alban\\" as he then was) had harboured a fugitive priest at his home on Chantry Island and, when they heard of the impending arrival of Roman Soldiers, Alban changed clothes with the priest so that he himself, and not the priest, would be arrested. Alban was arrested, and taken to nearby Verulamium, where he would later be martyred. Verulamium was later renamed Saint Albans in his honour.

His father, Major General Nikolay Ivanovich von L√ºders (1762‚Äì1823) was the commander of Bryansk regiment during the Napoleonic Wars.Nikolay L√ºders article in the Dictionary of Russian generals Count L√ºders also participated in the Napoleonic Wars and was heavily wounded in the Battle of Kulm (1813). He was distinguished during the Russo-Turkish War (1828‚Äì1829). A member of the Russian army during the November Uprising, he participated in the Battle of Warsaw in 1831, leading the troops that captured Wola. In 1837 he became the commander of the 5th Infantry Corps of Russian Army. In 1843 he and his Corps took part in quelling another uprising against the Russian Empire, that of Imam Shamil during the Caucasian War. In 1848 he commanded Russian troops in Moldova and Walachia. In 1849 he commanded the 5th Corps sent to aid Austria during the Hungarian Revolution of 1848. In 1849 he defeated Polish-Hungarian forces under general J√≥zef Bem at the Battle of Segesv√°r. During the Crimean War (1854 ‚Äì1856) he commanded the Army South operating in the middle Danube region. From November 1861 to June 1862 he held the position of Namestnik of the Kingdom of Poland; he is remembered as a brutal overseer, persecuting Poles and the Catholic Church. His activities contributed to the rising tensions that culminated in the January Uprising (1863), however L√ºders had already been wounded in 1862 during an assassination attempt by Ukrainian officer Andrij Potebnia (who acted to take revenge for his comrades, Ukrainian revolutionaries, captured and tortured by Alexander) and returned to St. Petersburg before the uprising, to become one of the members of State Council of Imperial Russia. After promotion to the State Council the family of L√ºders got the count title. Since L√ºders did not have sons the title Count L√ºders was given to the husband of L√ºders' daughter, Alexander Weimarn and their offspring .

Originally developed for data handling and analysis on Data General AOS and AOS/VS minicomputers, then the available platforms for Cyberquery were extended to all major UNIX platforms, VAX/VMS, Digital Equipment Corporation, personal computers and Microsoft Windows. Description of Cyberquery Invented in 1980, Cyberquery is a declarative \\"4GL\\" fourth-generation programming language. Its early design was slightly influenced by RAMIS and other data access and analysis languages such as the query language on GE time sharing systems. Cyberquery automates the process of accessing files or tables and reading records or rows. This basic operation allows the user/developer to concentrate on the details of working with the data within each record, in effect working almost entirely within an implicit program loop that runs for each record. Compared to general-purpose programming languages, this automation allows the user/developer to ignore the technical details of the data and how it is stored, and concentrate on the information contained in the data. Cyberquery has a data dictionary to describe the datasets users wish to access. This removes all the physical details of the file structure from each program and from the user/developer. The original target customers for Cyberquery were personnel departments, so ease of use by non computer specialists was an early design goal. This architecture had the advantage that Cyberquery is portable, reports written for one database run unmodified on any other provided the underlying data is logically similar. Differences are hidden in the data dictionary. Cyberquery is now widely deployed in Industries including Manufacturing, Finance, Medical and Retail.

Born in Santiago, he was educated in Chile and the United States. Early life Egon Wolff was born into a middle-class family of German immigrants, to parents who espoused traditional family values and encouraged traditional work ethics. During his childhood Wolff suffered periods of ill health and turned to reading; he read the classics of world literature to escape the boredom of being sick and bedridden. At the age of 16 Wolff produced his first novel, El Ocaso (Sunset).Imberman, Flaurie, & her Spanish Class \\"Egon Wolff\\", Castilleja School, 2004 Wolff studied and graduated in chemical engineering from the Universidad Catolica de Chile (Catholic University of Santiago) and subsequently studied performing arts at Yale University in the United States. Chilean theatre The formation of the Teatro Experimental de la Universidad de Chile (Experimental Theatre of the University of Chile) in 1941, followed by the founding of the Teatro del Ensayo de la Universidad Catolica (TEUC) (Theatre Actor Studio of the Catholic University) in 1943 created a qualitative change in Chilean theatre. Like many of his contemporaries in the 1950s his career begins to take form within this University theatre; he begins to develop a career with a more technical and artistic rigor which ‚Äì unlike previous commercial theatre ‚Äì led as much to the production of theatre as it did to the creation of new theatre groups.Wiegand, Francisca, Primera Linea \\"Antolog√≠a de Obras Teatrales: A todo Wolff\\" in Spanish (28 April 2002) Method and themes Wolff had a unique and expressive literary style full of patterns, and unexpected twists and turns. Often the first scene in a play is like the last, creating a continuous and complete cycle. Though his themes are universal, his style and work are full of references to aspects of Chilean culture. He was famous for the use of the fourth wall. Wolff‚Äôs work gravitates towards social neo-realism in which he portrays the seemingly complex behavior and conflicts between individual as ultimately yielding to forces in their environment. Consequently, his work harbors social, political and existential themes such as conflict between social classes and between different generation groups; the moral decay and the decadence of certain social groups. His work also touches on the negative effects social conventions can have on the existence of individuals. In some works Wolff presents two social groups that have ideas and life situations that are opposed and in struggle with each other, and by the end of work only one of these tends to prevail. He writes about the human condition the destructive nature of social forces which at times blends with magical realism that allows situations to alternate between reality and fantasy. In one of his most famous works, Pareja de trapos (Pair of rags), the two protagonists represent the pride and prejudice of the aristocracy and the opportunism of the middle classes which in order to climb proves itself capable of anything, including immoral or criminal acts. In Los Invasores (The invaders) a luxurious residence is invaded and occupied by a group of homeless beggars in this work the audience is unable to fully determine if the event is a real or merely a ‚Äúnightmare‚Äù.Paredes, Dougles, ‚ÄúUna Mirada a Los Invasores‚Äù Essay on Dramateatro.arts Through this thematic medium Wolff produces a profound critique of society. Legacy The work of Egon Wolff has been produced in 29 countries and translated into 19 different languages. After the death of his wife in an automobile accident in 1995 Wolff stopped working for about five years. Academic career and distinctions He was a professor of the Theatre School of the Catholic University of Chile from 1979. He earned the Premio Municipal de Teatro (Municipal Theatre Prize) a number of times. In 1983 he entered as a principal member of the Chilean Academy of Language. In 2013 he received Chile's National Prize for Performing and Audiovisual Arts.

It is the most well known peasant-driven political revolt in western Nigerian history, and continues to be referenced by grassroots organizations as a successful example of collective action against unpopular government policies. The revolt was predominantly aimed at agitating for a reduction in taxes, though some believed there were also political catalysts. Background During the 1950s, the colonial government of Nigeria established local commodity depots in many parts of the country. The depots served as stores of exchange for goods the government was interested in buying from peasants. The prosperous Western region was one of the world's most prolific producers of cocoa, and the regional government hoped to increase its tax revenues from farmers by regulating the sale of the crop through state-regulated agricultural cooperatives, also known as marketing boards. Most of the products to be sold were to undergo a process of grading, examination, and sometimes bargaining before purchase. Against this backdrop, a farmers' organization was created to represent the interest of the farmers within the new marketing system.Tunde Adeniran: \\"The Dynamics of Peasant Revolt: A Conceptual Analysis of the Agbekoya Parapo Uprising in the Western State of Nigeria,\\" Journal of Black Studies. Jun., 1974.. Translated from Yoruba, Agbekoya Parapo means \\"the union of farmers who reject suffering.\\" The association was an heir to an indigenous system of work cooperatives akin to trade unionism and drew on a tradition of occupational guilds that had regulated working standards and policies for centuries in the region. Yoruba workers in various professions traditionally organized themselves into \\"egbes\\", peer groups and guilds that protected the interests of their members in situations that required collective action. During the early part of Nigeria's independence, a systematic approach to solving the general problems of the region was taken by the Action Group, the leading political party in the Western Region. Many roads leading to villages were tarred, credit was extended to cooperative societies, and schools were equipped for better education. However, as the Nigerian political scene became more volatile with the jailing of foremost political leader Chief Obafemi Awolowo, the 1966 coup, and the beginning of the Biafran War, politicians came to view the farmers as pawns to be used for electoral strategies. The local depot officials also began to present themselves as minor vassal lords, demanding bribes and other concessions from farmers before accepting their harvest for sale. The provided amenities began to slide towards deplorable conditions, even though the government continued to demand taxes for their upkeep. Members of the loose farming guilds that eventually coalesced into Agbekoya first developed more militant tactics during an epidemic of swollen- shoot disease on cocoa plantations during the 1950s. Calling themselves the Maiyegun (or 'Life Abundance') League, they resisted attempts by government representatives to destroy affected trees on the premise that farmers could not afford to lose their crops without compensation. Several violent clashes occurred before the matter was settled in favor of the league. As the local depots became institutions in the economic life of average farmers, the organization and many other peasants continued to complain about other issues they found unjust The primary problems the farmers had were the arbitrary standards used for examination, which meant that significant amounts of harvested cocoa were discarded as unfit for sale; and the low prices they received for the accepted produce that reached the marketplace. The farmers complained about the neglected infrastructure of roads they had to travel to reach the depots. Moreover, they were also asked to pay a flat tax, a hefty imposition during times of economic uncertainty. The Revolt Military rule descended on the political scene as a result of the perceived failures of the previous administration by many, including the peasants. Some political elites were soon left from government participation. Also, a few university-educated citizens began to emerge as a result of the education policies of the region in the 1950s. The combination of these elites, mixed with a much more sophisticated leadership among Agbƒôkoya Parapo, created a juxtaposition of sort and a stronger political movement was born. The Agbƒôkoya leaders of the time were Mustapha Okikirungbo, Tafa Popoola, Adeniyi Eda, Adeagbo Kobiowo, Rafiu Isola and Mudasiru Adeniran. The leaders decided to set an organizational target as follows: *The removal of local government officials pillaging their villages *The removal of some Baales *A reduction of the flat Tax rate from $8 *An end to the use of force in tax collection *An increase in the prices of cocoa *An improvement of the roads leading to many villages Peasants shouted Oke mefa laosan! Oke mefa laosan! (‚ÄúWe are only paying 30 shillings!‚Äù) as they marched through the village after village to persuade the local farmers not to pay any taxes to the military governor of the Western state. These peasants were led by the ringleaders of Adegoke Akekuejo, Tafa Adeoye, Folarin Idowu, Mudasiru Adeniran and Tafa Popoola. Soon, some farmers and their leaders gradually left the villages and marched towards Mapo hall, the seat of the regional government. There, they ransacked the offices of officials, declaring that they would only pay $1.10. Mayhem then descended on the capital city and many villages. To curtail further violence, the government employed the use of force and violence to quell the uprising and arrested some of the Agbƒôkoya leaders. However, farmers took to violent reprisals on government structures, and as a result, many officials were killed. The Agbƒôkoya era consumed the Western Nigerian political landscape at the same time that the nation was pursuing civil war against Nigeria's Eastern Region in the Biafran War. As a method of protest against the military government, the Agbƒôkoya attacked major symbols of state power like court houses and government building, setting free thousands of prisoners alongside their jailed members. However, the release of Chief Obafemi Awolowo helped to quell the riots, as he negotiated directly with the movement's leaders. Aftermath The aftermath of the riots resulted in the removal of local government official administering the villages, removal of Baales, reduction in flat tax rate, end of the use of force for tax removal, increase in price of cocoa and the improving of roads leading to the villages. The government at the time agreed to these concessions. The riots in the long run was seen as possessing distinctive characteristics which differentiated from earlier riots. The primary reasons for the riots came from the rise of agrarian populism. The widely dispersed geographical nature occurred at almost simultaneously. This manifestation of riot was viewed as an overtly class based manifestation .

Such services may include file and printer serving, media center serving, web serving (on the network or Internet), web caching, file sharing and synchronization, calendar and contact sharing and synchronization, account authentication and backup services. Because of the relatively low number of computers on a typical home network, a home server commonly does not require significant computing power. Home servers can be implemented do-it-yourself style with a re-purposed, older computer, or a plug computer; pre-configured commercial home server appliances are also available. An uninterruptible power supply is sometimes used in case of power outages that can possibly corrupt data. Services provided by home servers =Administration and configuration= Home servers often run headless, and can be administered remotely through a command shell, or graphically through a remote desktop system such as RDP, VNC, Webmin, Apple Remote Desktop, or many others. Some home server operating systems (such as Windows Home Server) include a consumer-focused graphical user interface (GUI) for setup and configuration that is available on home computers on the home network (and remotely over the Internet via remote access). Others simply enable users to use native operating system tools for configuration. =Centralized storage= Home servers often act as network-attached storage (NAS) providing the major benefit that all users' files can be centrally and securely stored, with flexible permissions applied to them. Such files can be easily accessed from any other system on the network, provided the correct credentials are supplied. This also applies to shared printers. Such files can also be shared over the Internet to be accessible from anywhere in the world using remote access. Servers running Unix or Linux with the free Samba suite (or certain Windows Server products - Windows Home Server excluded) can provide domain control, custom logon scripts, and roaming profiles to users of certain versions of Windows. This allows a user to log on from any machine in the domain and have access to her or his \\"My Documents\\" and personalized Windows and application preferences - multiple accounts on each computer in the home are not needed. =Media serving= Home servers are often used to serve multi-media content, including photos, music, and video to other devices in the household (and even to the Internet; see Space shifting, Tonido and Orb). Using standard protocols such as DLNA or proprietary systems such as iTunes, users can access their media stored on the home server from any room in the house. Windows XP Media Center Edition, Windows Vista, and Windows 7 can act as a home server, supporting a particular type of media serving that streams the interactive user experience to Media Center Extenders including the Xbox 360. A typical MythTV menu. Windows Home Server supports media streaming to Xbox 360 and other DLNA-based media receivers via the built-in Windows Media Connect technology. Some Windows Home Server device manufacturers, such as HP, extend this functionality with a full DLNA implementation such as PacketVideo TwonkyMedia server. There are many open-source and fully functional programs for media serving available for Linux. LinuxMCE is one example, which allows other devices to boot off a hard drive image on the server, allowing them to become appliances such as set-top boxes. Asterisk, Xine, MythTV (another media serving solution), VideoLAN, SlimServer, DLNA, and many other open-source projects are fully integrated for a seamless home theater/automation/telephony experience. On an Apple Macintosh server, options include iTunes, PS3 Media Server, and Elgato. Additionally, for Macs directly connected to TVs, Boxee can act as a full-featured media center interface. Servers are typically always on so the addition of a TV or radio tuner allows recording to be scheduled at any time. Some home servers provide remote access to media and entertainment content. =Remote access = The Webmin Interface as it would appear in a standard web browser. A home server can be used to provide remote access into the home from devices on the Internet, using remote desktop software and other remote administration software. For example, Windows Home Server provides remote access to files stored on the home server via a web interface as well as remote access to Remote Desktop sessions on PCs in the house. Similarly, Tonido provides direct access via a web browser from the Internet without requiring any port forwarding or other setup. Some enthusiasts often use VPN technologies as well. On a Linux server, two popular tools are (among many) VNC and Webmin. VNC allows clients to remotely view a server GUI desktop as if the user was physically sitting in front of the server. A GUI need not be running on the server console for this to occur; there can be multiple 'virtual' desktop environments open at the same time. Webmin allows users to control many aspects of server configuration and maintenance all from a simple web interface. Both can be configured to be accessed from anywhere on the Internet. Servers can also be accessed remotely using the command line-based Telnet and SSH protocols. =Web serving= Some users choose to run a web server in order to share files easily and publicly (or privately, on the home network). Others set up web pages and serve them straight from their home, although this may be in violation of some ISPs terms of service. Sometimes these web servers are run on a nonstandard port in order to avoid the ISP's port blocking. Example web servers used on home servers include Apache and IIS. Many other web servers are available; see Comparison of lightweight web servers, Comparison of web servers. Web proxy Some networks have an HTTP proxy which can be used to speed up web access when multiple users visit the same websites, and to get past blocking software while the owner is using the network of some institution that might block certain sites. Public proxies are often slow and unreliable and so it is worth the trouble of setting up one's own private proxy. Some proxies can be configured to block websites on the local network if it is set up as a transparent proxy. =E-mail= Many home servers also run e-mail servers that handle e-mail for the owner's domain name. The advantages are having much bigger mailboxes and maximum message size than most commercial e-mail services. Access to the server, since it is on the local network is much faster than using an external service. This also increases security as e-mails do not reside on an off-site server. =BitTorrent= Home servers are ideal for utilizing the BitTorrent protocol for downloading and seeding files as some torrents can take days, or even weeks to complete and perform better on an uninterrupted connection. There are many text based clients such as rTorrent and web-based ones such as TorrentFlux and Tonido available for this purpose. BitTorrent also makes it easier for those with limited bandwidth to distribute large files over the Internet. =Gopher= An unusual service is the Gopher protocol, a hypertext document retrieval protocol which pre-dated the World Wide Web and was popular in the early 1990s. Many of the remaining gopher servers are run off home servers utilizing PyGopherd and the Bucktooth gopher server. =Home automation= Home automation requires a device in the home that is available 24/7. Often such home automation controllers are run on a home server. =Security monitoring= Relatively low cost CCTV DVR solutions are available that allow recording of video cameras to a home server for security purposes. The video can then be viewed on PCs or other devices in the house. A series of cheap USB-based webcams can be connected to a home server as a makeshift CCTV system. Optionally these images and video streams can be made available over the Internet using standard protocols. =Family applications= Home servers can act as a host to family-oriented applications such as a family calendar, to-do lists, and message boards. =IRC and instant messaging= Because a server is always on, an IRC client or IM client running on it will be highly available to the Internet. This way, the chat client will be able to record activity that occurs even while the user is not at the computer, e.g. asleep or at work or school. Textual clients such as Irssi and tmsnc can be detached using GNU Screen for example, and graphical clients such as Pidgin can be detached using xmove. Quassel provides a specific version for this kind of use. Home servers can also be used to run personal XMPP servers and IRC servers as these protocols can support a large number of users on very little bandwidth. =Online gaming= Some multiplayer games such as Continuum, Tremulous, Minecraft, and Doom have server software available which users may download and use to run their own private game server. Some of these servers are password protected, so only a selected group of people such as clan members or whitelisted players can gain access to the server. Others are open for public use and may move to colocation or other forms of paid hosting if they gain a large number of players. = Federated social networks = Home servers can be used to host distributed federated social networks like diaspora* and GNU Social. Federation protocols like ActivityPub allow many small home servers to interact in a meaningful way and give the perception of being on a large traditional social network. Federation is not just limited to social networks. Many innovative new free software web services are being developed that can allow people to host their own videos, photos, blogs etc. and still participate in the larger federated networks. =Third-party platform= Home servers often are platforms that enable third-party products to be built and added over time. For example, Windows Home Server provides a Software Development Kit.http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb425866.aspx Similarly, Tonido provides an application platform that can be extended by writing new applications using their SDK. Operating systems Home servers run many different operating systems. Enthusiasts who build their own home servers can use whatever OS is conveniently available or familiar to them, such as GNU/Linux, Microsoft Windows, BSD, Solaris or Plan 9 from Bell Labs. Hardware Single-board computers are increasingly being used to power home servers, with many of them being ARM devices. Old desktop and laptop computers can also be re-purposed to be used as home servers. Mobile phones are typically just as powerful as ARM-based single board computers. Once mobile phones can run the Linux operating system, self-hosting might move to mobile devices with each person's data and services being served from their own mobile phone.

Acyl-CoA's are susceptible to beta oxidation, forming, ultimately, acetyl-CoA. The acetyl-CoA enters the citric acid cycle, eventually forming several equivalents of ATP. In this way, fats are converted to ATP, the universal biochemical energy carrier. Functions =Fatty acid activation= The oxidative degradation of fatty acids is a two-step process, catalyzed by acyl-CoA synthetase. First, the fatty acid reacts with ATP to form an acyl phosphate. This intermediate reacts subsequently to give acyl-CoA: :Fatty acid + CoA + ATP ‚áå Acyl-CoA + AMP + PPi Fatty acids are activated in the cytosol, but oxidation occurs in the mitochondria. Because there is no transport protein for CoA adducts, acyl groups must enter the mitochondria via a shuttle system involving the small molecule carnitine.Pratt C.W., Cornely, K. Essential Biochemistry. John Wiley & Sons, Inc. (2004) Acyl-CoA is made by an enzyme called Acyl-CoA synthase. There are three different types of acyl-CoA synthases which can help make 3 different lengths of acyl-CoA. For example, medium chain acyl-CoA synthase is made to work upon 4-11 carbon fatty acids to make 4-11 carbon acyl-CoA. A different type of Acyl-CoA synthase is used for a 11-20 carbon fatty acid to make it into a 11-20 Acyl-CoA. The reaction to make Acyl-CoA is also thermodynamically favored because in this reaction ATP becomes AMP which is a two step reaction, and this is spontaneous. There is also an enzyme called Acyl-CoA thioesterase, and this enzyme does the opposite of Acyl-CoA synthase. This enzyme takes of the Acyl-CoA to form a free fatty acid and coenzyme A, in other words deactivates the fatty acid by breaking down Acyl-CoA. Clinical Significance Heart muscle primarily metabolizes fat for energy and Acyl-CoA metabolism has been identified as a critical molecule in early stage heart muscle pump failure. Cellular acyl-CoA content correlates with insulin resistance, suggesting that it can mediate lipotoxicity in non-adipose tissues. Acyl-CoA: diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) plays an important role in energy metabolism on account of key enzyme in triglyceride biosynthesis. The synthetic role of DGAT in adipose tissue such as the liver and the intestine, sites where endogenous levels of its activity and triglyceride synthesis are high and comparatively clear. Also, any changes in the activity levels might cause changes in systemic insulin sensitivity and energy homeostasis. A rare disease called multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD) is a fatty acid metabolism disorder. Acyl-CoA is important because this enzyme helps make Acyl-CoA from free fatty acids, and this activates the fatty acid to be metabolized. This compromised fatty acid oxidation leads to many different symptoms, including severe symptoms such as cardiomyopathy and liver disease and mild symptoms such as episodic metabolic decomposition, muscle weakness and respiratory failure. MADD is a genetic disorder, caused by a mutation in the ETFA, ETFB, and ETFDH genes. MADD is known as an ‚Äúautosomal recessive disorder‚Äù because for one to get this disorder, one must receive this recessive gene from both parents.

It is the aggregate of norms, personal and professional connections through which work gets done and relationships are built among people who share a common organizational affiliation or cluster of affiliations. It consists of a dynamic set of personal relationships, social networks, communities of common interest, and emotional sources of motivation. The informal organization evolves, and the complex social dynamics of its members also. Tended effectively, the informal organization compliments the more explicit structures, plans, and processes of the formal organization: it can accelerate and enhance responses to unanticipated events, foster innovation, enable people to solve problems that require collaboration across boundaries, and create footpaths showing where the formal organization may someday need to pave a way.  The informal organization and the formal organization  The nature of the informal organization becomes more distinct when its key characteristics are juxtaposed with those of the formal organization. Key characteristics of the informal organization: *evolving constantly *grass roots *dynamic and responsive *excellent at motivation *requires insider knowledge to be seen *treats people as individuals like *flat and fluid *cohered by trust and reciprocity *difficult to pin down *collective decision making *essential for situations that change quickly or are not yet fully understood Key characteristics of the formal organization: *enduring, unless deliberately altered *top-down *missionary *static *excellent at alignment *plain to see *equates \\"person\\" with \\"role\\" *hierarchical *bound together by codified rules and order *easily understood and explained *critical for dealing with situations that are known and consistent Historically, some have regarded the informal organization as the byproduct of insufficient formal organization‚Äîarguing, for example, that \\"it can hardly be questioned that the ideal situation in the business organization would be one where no informal organization existed.\\"Mescon, Michael H., \\"Comments on Organization.\\" The Journal of Educational Sociology, Vol. 33, No. 1 (September, 1959), pp. 34-36 However, the contemporary approach‚Äîone suggested as early as 1925 by Mary Parker Follett, the pioneer of community centers and author of influential works on management philosophy‚Äîis to integrate the informal organization and the formal organization, recognizing the strengths and limitations of each. Integration, as Follett defined it, means breaking down apparent sources of conflict into their basic elements and then building new solutions that neither allow domination nor require compromise.Davis, Albie. Dynamic Conflict Management: The Wisdom of Mary Parker Follett. Conference: \\"Beyond Mediation: Strategies For Appropriate Early Dispute Resolution In Special Education.\\" Washington, DC: CADRE (Consortium for Appropriate Dispute Resolution in Special Education), 2002. In other words, integrating the informal organization with the formal organization replaces competition with coherence. At a societal level, the importance of the relationship between formal and informal structures can be seen in the relationship between civil society and state authority. The power of integrating the formal organization and the informal organization can also be seen in many successful businesses.  Functions  Keith Davis suggests that informal groups serve at least four major functions within the formal organizational structure. =Perpetuate the cultural and social values= They perpetuate the cultural and social values that the group holds dear. Certain values are usually already held in common among informal group members. Day- to-day interaction reinforces these values that perpetuate a particular lifestyle and preserve group unity and integrity. For example, a college management class of 50 students may contain several informal groups that constitute the informal organization within the formal structure of the class. These groups may develop out of fraternity or sorority relationships, dorm residency, project work teams, or seating arrangements. Dress codes, hairstyles, and political party involvement are reinforced among the group members. They provide social status and satisfaction that may not be obtained from the formal organization. In a large organization (or classroom), a worker (or student) may feel like an anonymous number rather than a unique individual. Members of informal groups, however, share jokes and gripes, eat together, play and work together, and are friends-which contributes to personal esteem, satisfaction, and a feeling of worth. =Promote communication among members= The informal group develops a communication channel or system (i.e., grapevine) to keep its members informed about what management actions will affect them in various ways. Many astute managers use the grape- vine to \\"informally\\" convey certain information about company actions and rumors. =Provide social control= They provide social control by influencing and regulating behavior inside and outside the group. Internal control persuades members of the group to conform to its lifestyle. For example, if a student starts to wear a coat and tie to class, informal group members may razz and convince the student that such attire is not acceptable and therefore to return to sandals, jeans, and T-shirts. External control is directed to such groups as management, union leadership, and other informal groups.  Disadvantages  Informal organizations also possess the following potential disadvantages and problems that require astute and careful management attention. = Resistance to change = Perpetuation of values and lifestyle causes informal groups to become overly protective of their \\"culture\\" and therefore resist change. For example, if restriction of output was the norm in an autocratic management group, it must continue to be so, even though management changes have brought about a more participative administration.This Culture make employees more Rigid. = Role conflict = The quest for informal group satisfaction may lead members away from formal organizational objectives. What is good for and desired by informal group members is not always good for the organization. Doubling the number of coffee breaks and the length of the lunch period may be desirable for group members but costly and unprofitable for the firm. Employees' desire to fulfill the requirements and services of both the informal group and management results in role conflict. Role conflict can be reduced by carefully attempting to integrate interests, goals, methods, and evaluation systems of both the informal and formal organizations, resulting in greater productivity and satisfaction on everyone's behalf. = Rumor = The grapevine dispenses truth and rumor with equal vengeance. Ill-informed employees communicate unverified and untrue information that can create a devastating effect on employees. This can undermine morale, establish bad attitudes, and often result in deviant or, even violent behavior. For example, a student who flunks an exam can start a rumor that a professor is making sexually harassing advances toward one of the students in class. This can create all sorts of ill feelings toward the professor and even result in vengeful acts like \\"egging\\" the residence or knocking over the mail box. = Conformity = Social control promotes and encourages conformity among informal group members, thereby making them reluctant to act too aggressively or perform at too high a level. This can harm the formal organization by stifling initiative, creativity, and diversity of performance. In some British factories, if a group member gets \\"out of line\\", tools may be hidden, air may be let out of tires, and other group members may refuse to talk to the deviant for days or weeks. Obviously, these types of actions can force a good worker to leave the organization.  Benefits  Although informal organizations create unique challenges and potential problems for management, they also provide a number of benefits for the formal organization. = Blend with formal system = Formal plans. Policies, procedures, and standards cannot solve every problem in a dynamic organization; therefore, informal systems must blend with formal ones to get work done. As early as 1951, Robert Dubin recognized that \\"informal relations in the organization serve to preserve the organization from the self- destruction that would result from literal obedience to the formal policies, rules, regulations, and procedures\\". No college or university could function merely by everyone following the \\"letter of the law\\" with respect to written policies and procedures. Faculty, staff, and student informal groups must cooperate in fulfilling the \\"spirit of the law\\" to effectuate an organized, sensibly run enterprise. = Lighten management workload = Managers are less inclined to check up on workers when they know the informal organization is cooperating with them. This encourages delegation, decentralization, and greater worker support of the manager, which suggests a probable improvement in performance and overall productivity. When a professor perceives that students are conscientiously working on their term papers and group projects, there are likely to be fewer \\"pop tests\\" or important progress reports. This eases the professors load and that of the students and promotes a better relation- ship between both parties. = Fill gaps in management abilities = For instance, if a manager is weak in financial planning and analysis, a subordinate may informally assist in preparing reports through either suggestions or direct involvement. = Act as a safety valve = Employees experience frustration, tension, and emotional problems with management and other employees. The informal group provides a means for relieving these emotional and psychological pressures by allowing a person to discuss them among friends openly and candidly. In faculty lounge conversations, frustrations with the dean, department head, or students are \\"blown off\\" among empathetic colleagues. = Encourage improved management practice = Perhaps a subtle benefit of informal groups is that they encourage managers to prepare, plan, organize, and control in a more professional fashion. Managers who comprehend the power of the informal organization recognize that it is a \\"check and balance\\" on their use of authority. Changes and projects are introduced with more careful thought and consideration, knowing that the informal organization can easily kill a poorly planned project. = Understanding and dealing with the environmental crisis = The IRG Solution: hierarchical incompetence and how to overcome it (1984) argued that central media and government-type hierarchical organizations could not adequately understand the environmental crisis we were manufacturing, or how to initiate adequate solutions. It argued that what was required, was the widespread introduction of informal networks or Information Routing Groups which were essentially a description of social networking services prior to the internet.

Accessed September 12, 2014. http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/1999/09/broadband-five- principles-for-reform. The complex local, state, and federal regulations have been a topic of discussion for many years. The general opinion seems to have been that the laws which regulate cable television, and the telecommunications industry in general, have been in need of deregulation.Worstell, Jennifer L. ‚ÄúSection 253 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996: A Permanent Physical Appropriation of Private Property That Must Be Justly Compensated.‚Äù Federal Communications Law Journal 50 (1998 1997): 441.‚ÄúJournal of Municipal Telecommunications,‚Äù April 14, 2000. https://web.archive.org/web/20000414142815/http://munitelecom.org/jmt.html. Experts boast a number of benefits which would result from this change. Experts began calling for deregulation of these rules as early as 1970s. The problem did not have a quick or easy solution and it was decades until action was taken. In the 1980s Kiplinger‚Äôs Personal Finance published an article which alerted cable customers to their rights as consumers. The 1980s was a time when not all towns had cable television. Previously there had been instances where towns had become stuck in a contract with a bad cable provider. This could be prevented if the town took an active part when a cable company was interested in entering the community. By learning the FCC regulations and the governing entity of their local franchise company, customers had the ability to make demands for their cable agreement which helped to ensure fair service. In return for the rights to offer service in an area, a cable company must provide certain community benefits requested by the LFA. These might include Public, educational, and government access (PEG) cable TV channels, high-speed networks for local agencies and institutions, and/or special rates for seniors, the economically disadvantaged, and the disabled.Center for Digital Democracy By the 1990s the demand for cable technology was so rapidly increasing that the need for reform seemed inevitable. Cable systems in the United States were becoming more of a necessity than a luxury both for individuals and communities as technology became a part of everyday life. By this time there were numerous publications which explored the problems with the cable system. Local franchise companies had control over cable systems which resulted in a sort of monopoly. The local authorities were accused of having priority to access (although there are rebuttals against the validity of this argument). One author made the comparison of allowing the government to only permit one newspaper to be sold on the side of the street; it would result in a lack of competition.Jr, Richard O. Beil, P.

This is what was happening in the cable industry, the local franchise authorities had the power to control which cable systems were granted access to their area. The high demand for cable systems suggested a guaranteed profitable business venture. However, the cost of funding to develop a cable system was high and the barriers to entry made it a greater risk than many investors were interested in taking. This resulted in lack of competition which resulted in higher prices.Telecommunications Issues Related to Competition and Subscriber Rates in the Cable Television Industry. DIANE Publishing, n.d. In 1996 the long-awaited reform came about. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 became the largest and most comprehensive rewrite of telecommunication laws. It was meant to deregulate the system and create a more open market in which competitive prices and better service could be achieved. It granted local franchise authorities the ability to regulate cable service rates which was previously mandated by the FCC. However, the effectiveness of this act in accomplishing those feats has been debated. In the immediate aftermath new problems arose. Some had been predicted and some had not. The sheer number of overhauls caused roadways and sidewalks to be torn up which affected pedestrian and vehicular travel while adding extra expense to the endeavor. Local authorities could no longer dictate who could occupy their property nor how much they should be compensated for this occupancy. Companies were now fighting over who had the rights to physical access in communities.cablevision of boston v. public improvement com‚Äôn, 184 F. 3d 88 (Court of Appeals, 1st Circuit 1999).

The Garda Public Order Unit ‚Äì commonly known as the Garda Riot Squad ‚Äì is a unit of the Garda S√≠och√°na, Ireland's police force, that deals with public disorder, including riots and protests. Staffing and training All garda√≠ assigned to Public Order Units are standard uniformed members assigned to normal policing duties with specialist Public Order training. The unit is trained to use riot control tactics to control, disperse, and arrest civilians that are involved in a riot, demonstration, or protest. Uniform Garda√≠ assigned to Public Order Units typically wear black flame-retardant coveralls, standard issue stab-resistant vests and navy baseball caps with \\"GARDA\\" on both the front and back, and \\"PUBLIC ORDER\\" along the sides in yellow. Where there is a heightened risk of violence or attack with burning projectiles, such as Molotov cocktails, stab vests are worn under the coveralls and navy blue riot protection helmets with face shields and protective gloves are worn. For protection in violent situations, an additional layer of flame-retardant body armor designed for public order use, complete with shoulder pads may be worn along with shin and forearm protectors. In September 2018 the Garda Commissioner was obliged to issue a directive confirming that the Public Order Unit's flame retardant hoods were intended to be worn only when a helmet was also worn - when it was queried why some unit members had worn hoods during a public order policing incident in Dublin. Equipment As with ordinary uniformed members of the Garda S√≠och√°na, the Public Order Unit do not routinely carry firearms, relying instead on conventional, non-lethal weapons such as pepper spray and batons. Members of the unit typically wear body armour, riot helmets, and carry riot shields. Full-length riot shields are also used during potentially violent confrontations where there is large hostile crowds, or the risk of thrown or flammable projectiles. In 2016 it was reported that riot gear orders had included contracts for 26-inch batons, riot gloves and boots, and protective flame-retardant clothing. If a situation escalates whereby an armed response is required, the Garda Regional Support Unit (RSU) or Garda Emergency Response Unit (ERU) will be called in to assist. Vehicles The Public Order Unit does not operate any specialist armoured vehicles, instead relying on a fleet of refitted commercial vans. These Ford Transit vehicles typically are longer wheelbase versions of the standard Transit van used by garda√≠ for patrol and lacking a prisoner cage, with Public Order Unit markings. Formerly, Transit vans were equipped with a raisable and removable windscreen protection cage and removable cages fitted over other windows, however vehicles ordered in 2015 to replace the severely aged 2007 fleet lack these features leaving them open to damage from projectiles. The DMR South Central Division Public Order Unit, operating from Pearse Street Garda Station, operate a Fiat Ducato van for patrol and public order incidents. This vehicle is used for weekend public order patrols. Deployment Typically the unit is only called up for riot situations or pre-planned situations such as major sporting events, protests or large-scale public events such as concerts, St. Patrick's Day or Halloween. In some other cases the Public Order unit has been deployed on more frequent or recurring basis during times of increased risk of disturbances. Examples include the days preceding high-tension international football games, or during the 2016 build-up to the 1916 Centenary celebrations. =Dublin= Two full serials patrol Dublin city center on Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights, providing support to regular patrol Garda√≠ in situations such as pub brawls, disorderly crowds and excessively violent individuals. One vehicle operates from Pearse Street Garda station on the south side of the River Liffey and one from the Bridewell Garda station, the latter being deployed in response to a violent attack on two uniformed garda√≠ in the area. Similar resources are deployed across Dublin on Halloween due to a spike in anti-social behaviour, illegal bonfires, attacks against Garda√≠ and the Dublin Fire Brigade and other related activity. Notable operations * In 1995, the unit dealt with rioting English football hooligans (including many members of Combat 18) during a friendly soccer match between the Republic of Ireland and England in Lansdowne Road. * In 2006, the unit was involved in the 2006 Dublin riots, and were deployed to deal with rioters in Dublin city centre. Some members of the unit were injured during the riots, which lasted several hours. * In July 2008, members of the unit along with the Air Support Unit and Dog Unit assisted local Garda√≠ when a feud between two Traveller families broke into a riot in Dalton Park, Mullingar. * In November 2014, the Public Order Unit were present during a protest against water-charges in Jobstown, Tallaght in which protesters were later 'charged with falsely imprisoning then t√°naiste Joan Burton'.

The Savoy was a magazine of literature, art, and criticism published in eight numbers from January to December 1896 in London. It featured work by authors such as W. B. Yeats, Max Beerbohm, Joseph Conrad, Aubrey Beardsley and William Thomas Horton. Only eight issues of the magazine were published: two quarterly (January, April) and six monthly (July- December). The publisher was Leonard Smithers, a controversial friend of Oscar Wilde who was also known as a pornographer. Among other publications by Smithers were rare erotic works and unique items such as books bound in human skin.History of The Savoy History Aubrey Beardsley's \\"Fruit Bearers\\" from The Savoy, 1896 The Savoy was founded as a competitor to The Yellow Book and to provide work for members of the Decadent movement as it began to decline with the imprisonment of Oscar Wilde.Nelson, James G. Publisher to the Decadents: Leonard Smithers in the Careers of Beardsley, Wilde, Dowson. University Park, PA: The Pennsylvania State University Press, 2000: 4. The magazine was started by Leonard Smithers, writer Arthur Symons (The Symbolist Movement In Literature) and artist Aubrey Beardsley. It is considered a little magazine, and was described as \\"a manifesto in revolt against Victorian materialism\\".The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition The name was inspired by the Savoy Hotel, a glamorous hotel in London which opened in 1889 and became infamous for being the location for Oscar Wilde's trysts.Ross, David A.

Hubert Crackanthorpe tried to convince Grant Richards to join him in buying The Savoy but the plan never came to fruition. The magazine folded in December 1896 with its eighth issue.Nelson, James G. Publisher to the Decadents: Leonard Smithers in the Careers of Beardsley, Wilde, Dowson. University Park, PA: The Pennsylvania State University Press, 2000: 88. In the final issue, Symons considered its failure: Content Symons attempted to distance the magazine from the Decadent movement and the controversy surrounding Wilde by writing, \\"We are not Realists, or Romanticists, or Decadents\\" in his editorial note in the first issue. However, he went on to write, \\"For us, all art is good which is good art\\", which is very similar to the Decadent creed of \\"art for art's sake.\\" \\"The Shadow of Oscar Wilde: A Study of Subversive and Clandestine Sexuality in Four Novellas from The Savoy\\" by Matthew Brinton Tildesley Yeats, who contributed several pieces to the magazine, described its fellow writers as \\"outlaws\\" and believed that the magazine waged \\"warfare on the British public at a time when we had all against us\\".Ross, David A. Critical Companion to William Butler Yeats: A Literary Reference to His Life and Work. New York: Facts on File, 2001: 542. Poet Rub√©n Dar√≠o praised the magazine and Symons: \\"For me, Symons is appealing since, for many years, I was enthused with his efforts for the sake of Beauty in his unforgettable magazine, Savoy, the very refined intellectual magazine.\\"LoDato, Rosemary C.

The church is not named for Saint Sophia the martyr, but rather the Holy Wisdom of God in the tradition of Hagia Sophia of Constantinople. The building is in the Neo- Byzantine style with a central dome that reaches in height. The congregation met in temporary quarters for several years, prior to the construction of its own church near 8th and L Streets NW which was dedicated in 1924. This site is currently occupied by the Walter E. Washington Convention Center. Construction on the current edifice at 2815 36th Street NW, near Massachusetts Avenue and a short distance from the Washington National Cathedral, began in 1951. The congregation began worshipping there in 1955 shortly after major construction was completed. Although the building has been in use for over fifty years, the interior decoration is incomplete.

From RMB 50 for a quick know- how answer to a small technological query to around RMB 1,000 to help a company come up with a logo design, with even higher amounts being paid out for more diverse services such as scientific research and analysis.

It is a popular residential neighbourhood with easy access to downtown, the University of Alberta, the Edmonton river valley park system, and other amenities. RE/MAX Field, home to the Edmonton Prospects baseball team of the Western Canadian Baseball League since 2012, is located in this neighbourhood. The Edmonton Trappers of the AAA Pacific Coast League also called RE/MAX Field, then known as Telus Field, home up to the end of the 2004 season, when the franchise was moved to another city. A short distance to the west of the neighbourhood, along River Valley Road, are the Royal Glenora Club, the Golf Course, and the Skating Oval in Victoria Park. The community is represented by the Rossdale Community League, established in 1922, which maintains a community hall located at 101 Street and 96 Avenue.  Archaeology and history  The site of the Rossdale powerplant was a First Nations campsite from the time that people first moved into the Edmonton area after the retreat of the glaciers around 8,000 years ago. In the early 1800s it was used as the site for the Hudson's Bay Company's Fort Edmonton and the North West Company's Fort Augustus, although this was only a theory until 2012 when a trench thought to be part of stockade wall was unearthed. Human remains have been discovered at the site multiple times, by EPCOR workers and archaeologists, from at least the 1960s to 2010s. After a protest about the city's lack of consultation with the indigenous community, the provincial government directed the city to consult with the Papaschase band, other First Nations and the M√©tis Nation of Alberta. In 2005 and 2016, unearthed human remains were re-interred. In 2007, a monument commonly known as the Rossdale Memorial was constructed to mark the desecrated burial ground.  Demographics  In the City of Edmonton's 2012 municipal census, Rossdale had a population of living in dwellings, a -4.7% change from its 2009 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of people/km2 in 2012.  Residential development  While Rossdale is an older neighbourhood with residential development beginning during the early years of Edmonton's history, there has been a significant redevelopment of the area in more recent years. According to the 2001 federal census, only one residence in ten (9.9%) in modern Rossdale was built before the end of World War II. Another one in five residences (17.6%) were built between 1946 and 1970 and one residence in ten (11.0%) were built during the 1970s. One in four residences (24.2%) were built during the 1980s and two out of five (37.4%) were built during the 1990s. The most common type of residence in Rossdale, according to the 2005 municipal census, is a mixture of rented apartments and apartment style condominiums. These account for half (51%) of all residences in the neighbourhood. Two out of three of these residences are in low-rise buildings with fewer than five stories while one in three are in high-rise buildings with five or more stories. Single-family dwellings account for one out of every three (35%) of all residences in the neighbourhood. Row houses account for one in ten residences (10%). Four percent of all residences are duplexes.Duplexes include triplexes and fourplexes. Three out of every five (62%) are owner-occupied while two out of five (38%) are rented.http://censusdocs.edmonton.ca/C05002/MUNICIPAL%202005/Neighbourhood/ROSSDALE.pdf  Rossdale Power Plant  Rossdale Power Plant in 2010. Located next to RE/MAX Field is the Rossdale Power Plant, used by EPCOR to generate electricity. Originally built by the Edmonton Electric Lighting and Power Company, the owner Alex Taylor, sold the company to the city of Edmonton in 1902. The plant was shut down by EPCOR in 2009. The plant sits on, and adjacent to, a native burial ground, and was named a provincial historic resource in 2001. EPCOR also operates the Rossdale water treatment plant located next to the power plant. The water treatment plant was constructed in 1903 and remains in operation.  Population mobility  The population in Rossdale is highly mobile. According to the 2005 municipal census, one in five (21.5%) of all residents had moved within the previous twelve months. Another one in five (22.4%) had moved within the previous one to three years. Only two out of every five (42%) residents had lived at the same address for five years or longer.http://censusdocs.edmonton.ca/C05022B/MUNICIPAL%202005/Neighbourhood/ROSSDALE.pdf  See also  * Edmonton Federation of Community Leagues * Edmonton's historic river valley neighbourhoods: ** Cloverdale ** Riverdale  References   External links  *Rossdale Neighbourhood Profile *Epcor Plans for the Rossdale site. *Rossdale Community League Category:Neighbourhoods in Edmonton Category:Archaeological sites in Canada ","title":"Rossdale, Edmonton"},{"id":"9488683","text":"The 1950 Penn State Nittany Lions football team represented the Pennsylvania State University in the 1950 college football season.

The transition from normal conduction to cut-off can be more or less sharp, depending on the type of device considered, and also the speed of this transition varies considerably. Cutoff values =Diodes= * Copper oxide diode: * Diac: * Germanium diode: apx 0.3 V; varying with temperature * Schottky diode:0.15‚Äì0.45 V * Selenium diode: * Silicon diode: cutoff occurs when Vf falls below apx 0.7 V. The exact voltage varies with temperature. * Thermionic diode: cutoff voltage depends on device design. Much higher than for silicon devices. * Zener diode: reverse cutoff defined by diode voltage rating. Forward cutoff apx 0.6 V. =Transistors= * BJT: Depends on the configuration * Germanium transistor: apx 0.2 V, varying with temperature * MOSFET: * Silicon transistor: apx 0.6 V, varying with temperature. * TRIAC: =Valves= * Triodes: triodes cut off when applied grid bias is too low. This will be a negative voltage under ordinary conditions. * Tetrode, pentode etc.: There is some degree of interaction between the grids, and values will vary from one device to another. Anode voltage also affects cutoff voltage. Remote cutoff A vacuum tube (such as a pentode, but also sometimes triodes, hexodes, heptodes and so on) with its control grid given a helix with a variable pitch can be made to operate with more negative grid voltages, with reduced amplification, before it is completely cut off (i.e. yielding no significant output). This ability to vary the amplification (sometimes called mu) and also the transconductance, is useful in Automatic Gain Control (AGC) stages of radio receivers. Devices with this characteristic are called remote-cutoff or variable-mu or super-control types. Sharp cutoff With a normal control grid arrangement, a vacuum tube will have close to a square-law relationship between input (grid) voltage and output (anode/plate) current, with the latter falling sharply to roughly zero. This characteristic is normally required for linear RF and audio uses. Examples; EF86 and 6AK5. Semi-remote cutoff A semi-remote cutoff device has characteristics somewhere between a remote-cutoff device and a sharp-cutoff one.

It is a compilation of all blocking, business, light, speech and sound cues, lists of properties, drawings of the set, contact information for the cast and crew, and any other relevant information that might be necessary to help the production run smoothly and nicely. In modern theatrical productions, the prompt book is generally maintained and kept by the stage manager, with differences in the specific construction and organization to suit the style of the stage manager keeping the book, and the type of production (legitimate theatre, musical theatre, dance, opera, etc.). Description and use Modern prompt books will tend to be constructed using binders with multiple tab dividers, with the page of the production attached to a larger sheet of paper to provide more margin space for taking notes. Markings to the script (for cues, notes, etc.) are typically done in pencil, and either in the margins or on the blank side of the back of the opposing page. In situations where there are multiple stage managers or assistants, it is not uncommon for many copies of the prompt book to exist. Generally a lead stage manager will keep the master book, which is then copied by assistants on a nightly basis to account for any new information inserted during rehearsals, productions, and meetings. While all prompt books will contain some of the same basic information (script, cast list, contact information, set drawings, etc.), there is no official standard, and individual stage managers will determine the best way of keeping books for themselves and the productions they manage. While Actors' Equity Association, the union governing professional stage managers in the United States, does not publish any official pragma for a prompt book, such practices are often covered as part of college curricula, and many books exist on the subject. History Prompt books were originally used by a prompter to much the same effect that they are today used by deputy stage managers. During the period spanning from the mid 17th through the early 19th centuries, rehearsal periods were generally very short by modern standards: a period of 1‚Äì2 weeks for three hours a day was common. Performances were likewise unpolished by modern standards, even when taking into account the theatrical conventions of the time, and so it was necessary to have a prompter standing by to assist actors with lines, blocking, and business‚Äîall of which the prompter would need to have recorded in their book. In practice, prompters were also responsible for copying sides of the script for the company's actors, giving cues for music and scene shifts, securing licenses for plays, and assessing fines for actors who failed to attend rehearsals‚Äîin keeping with the duties of a modern stage manager. The records that prompters kept in their books are some of the most valuable resources available to modern scholars for understanding historical theatrical practice in the period.Brockett, Oscar. History of the Theatre (1999), p. 257 As audience expectations for spectacle evolved in the 19th century, prompt books were published to describe the techniques involved in constructing complex scenery and special effects.

History WDEO began operations in 1962 as WYNZ, a 250-watt daytimer on 1520 AM with a country format, which changed to Top 40 in 1964 and then religious programming in 1968.Michiguide.com WDEO History Two young DJs who would go on to long careers in radio started at WYNZ: 14-year-old Jim Kerr, who got on the air by selling airtime to local merchants; and Jim Harper, a teenaged friend who took over Kerr's show one week.Musicradio77.com Kerr later spent over twenty years in New York as WPLJ's morning man (1974‚Äì96), while Harper became a Detroit radio legend, retiring from WMGC-FM at the end of 2011.WXYZ.com In 1974, the station changed its calls to WYFC with the format remaining Christian-based. By the early 1980s, WYFC had become one of the first stations in the area to feature the emerging field of what would become known as contemporary Christian music. In late 1986, the station moved to its current 990 AM frequency and became WWCM (known as simply \\"WCM\\" on the air). The format remained Contemporary Christian. In the late 1990s, WWCM's daytime power increased to 9,200 watts, giving the station much better coverage of the metropolitan Detroit area. WCM also broadcast in AM Stereo (which was dropped after the station changed format). Former Domino's Pizza owner Tom Monaghan purchased WWCM in 1999 and changed it to WDEO, using the same calls and Catholic format formerly heard on AM 1290 in Saline (now WLBY). The station's studios were also moved from their longtime location on Cross Street in Ypsilanti into the Domino's Farms complex near Ann Arbor. Ave Maria Radio In addition to WDEO, Ave Maria Radio is heard on WMAX in Bay City. EWTN also carries some programming produced by Ave Maria Radio including Catholic Connection with Teresa Tomeo and Kresta in the Afternoon with Al Kresta.

Potentiators are used in the clinical laboratory for performing blood banking procedures that require enhancement of agglutination to detect the presence of antibodies or antigens in a patient's blood sample. Examples of potentiators include albumin, LISS (low ionic-strength saline) and PEG (polyethylene glycol).* Potentiators are also known as enhancement reagents. Albumin acts as a potentiator by reducing the zeta potential around the suspended red blood cells, thus dispersing the repulsive negative charges and enhancing agglutination. Low ionic strength saline (LISS) is a potentiator that acts by not only reducing the zeta potential, but also by increasing the amount of antibody taken up by the red blood cell during sensitization. LISS is a solution of glycine and albumin. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) in a LISS solution removes water from the system and thus concentrates the antibodies present. PEG can cause non-specific aggregation of cells, thus eliminating the necessity for centrifugation after incubation. PEG is not appropriate for use in samples from patients with increased plasma protein, such as patients with multiple myeloma. False-positive results may occur more frequently with the use of polyethylene glycol due to its strong agglutination capabilities. Pharmacology In clinical pharmacology, a potentiator is a drug, herb, or chemical that intensifies the effects of a given drug. For example, hydroxyzine or dextromethorphan is used to get more pain relief and anxiolysis out of an equal dose of an opioid medication. The potentiation can take place at any part of the liberation, absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination of the drug.

He published over 170 scientific papers. Armstrong was born in Seattle, Washington. Education In 1955, he moved to New Haven, Connecticut to attend Yale University. He obtained his BSc in 1959 and a PhD in 1964. He stayed at Yale as assistant and associate professor in the geology department until 1973. While he was a Yale professor, he took two leaves, the first in 1963-1964 on a National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Fellowship at the University of Berne, and in 1968-1969 as a Morse and Guggenheim Fellow at the Australian National University and California Institute of Technology. Career In 1973, Armstrong moved to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada to be an associate professor at the University of British Columbia. He was eventually made a full professor. In 1979, he became a Canadian citizen. Armstrong studied the chronology of magmatism, metamorphism, and tectonics of western North America. He utilized several methodologies, including Potassium- Argon, Rubidium-Strontium, Uranium-Lead and Neodymium-Samarium to obtain isotopic data. Armstrong's early theories guided research for a generation. His views were controversial and contested by many prominent isotope geochemists. It took decades for other scientists to accept his ideas. Before he died, Armstrong was vindicated through the recognition he received for his model of crustal recycling at the 1990 ICOG meeting in Canberra after presenting a paper on \\"The Persistent Myth of Crustal Growth\\". Most of Armstrong's effort was spent systematically building an enormous database on the geochronology of the North American Cordillera. This database highlighted the magmatic evolution of the region and continues to provide a wealth of information to the scientific community. Armstrong was an active member of the Geological Society of America and editorial boards for several journals. He participated in the peer review process of the National Science Foundation and Canada's Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council. He also participated in Canada's Lithoprobe program a national geoscience research project and contributed to the development of the geological timescale, particularly the Triassic. On August 9, 1991, Armstrong died of liver cancer, five days after his 54th birthday.

The dam's main purpose is to supply potable water for the region, including Lismore, Ballina, Byron Bay, Evans Head and Alstonville. The impounded reservoir is called Rocky Lake.  Location and features  Commenced in 1949 and completed in April 1953, the Rocky Creek Dam is a minor dam located in the Northern Rivers region of New South Wales, situated approximately north of Lismore. The dam is the principal component of the Rous County Council bulk supply network for the region, experiencing population growth. The dam was built by Dayal Singh under contract to the Rous County Council. The dam wall is made up of about of rock, soil, clay and concrete and is high and long. At 100% capacity the dam wall holds back of water at AHD. The surface area of Rocky Lake is and the catchment area is which includes the Whian Whian State Forest, Nightcap National Park and Whian Whian State Conservation area. The area was once used for logging but is now has a conserved and generally pristine catchment environment. The uncontrolled spillway is capable of discharging . The vegetation in the catchment is mainly subtropical rainforest or wet sclerophyll. The vegetation community generally reflects the geology and soils in the area which are derived from the Lamington Volcanics which in this area consists of basalt and thick rhyolite rocks erupted from or associated with the Tweed Volcano. The subtropical rainforest is generally regarded as one of the biggest remnants of the Big Scrub rainforest that once existed over a large part of the surrounding region. The dam is considered small compared to the size of the population it services. However, the secure yield is high because of the catchment's climate with its consistent high annual rainfall. The nearby Rummery Park rain gauge formerly operated by the Bureau of Meteorology has the highest average annual rainfall in New South Wales. However, in 2003 the lack of rain meant that the water level was at one stage less than twenty per cent. In 2009 the dam wall was upgraded by ensuring the safety of the dam wall during a maximum probable flood. The upgrade involved the removal of the top of the wall, the installation of a concrete cut-off wall keyed into the impermeable clay core, followed by replacement of the gravel and road over the dam wall. = Water supply = Water from the lake is used as a potable water supply by Rous County Council to the region. It is the primary water source to the centres of Alstonville, Ballina, Byron Bay, Evans Head, and Lismore. Water is pumped from the lake a short distance to the Nightcap Water Treatment Plant and then this water is provided to the region generally through gravity reticulation. The water available from the Rocky Creek Dam is usually considered very reliable because of the nature of the catchment and the areas climate. However, in 2003 the water level at the dam dropped below 20% and the region was subject to severe water restrictions. Because of this it was decided by Rous County Council to augment the Rocky Creek Dam supply by developing another source on the Wilsons River near Lismore treating it at an upgraded Nightcap Water Treatment plant at Rocky Creek Dam. The emergency Wilsons River source was completed in 2003 and the fully developed Wilsons River source and upgrade of the Nightcap Water Treatment Plant was completed in 2008.  Recreation  Recreation (including swimming and boating) on Rocky Lake is prohibited to protect the high quality of the water in the reservoir. However, a recreational area is provided by Rous County Council near the dam wall including lawns, barbecues, playgrounds, walking tracks (including a board walk and pontoon bridge) and interpretive walks. The lawns near the edge of the lake are often used for weddings. The catchment is mainly under the control of the NSW National Parks & Wildlife Service as national parks and State conservation areas. This means that only passive recreation such as bush walking, bird watching, etc. are permitted. However, swimming, boating, 4WD and dirt bikes are prohibited in the catchment area.

The resulting plans aim to supply economically valuable information as a public good that the market by itself cannot disseminate, or where forward markets are nonexistent. However, indicative planning takes only endogenous market uncertainty into account, plans the economy accordingly, and does not look into exogenous uncertainty like technology, foreign trade, etc. Indicative plans serve to complement and enhance the market, as opposed to replace the market mechanism, hence they are adopted in market-based and mixed economies and were most widely practiced in France and Japan before the 1980s.Nielsen K. (2008) Indicative Planning. In: Palgrave Macmillan (eds) The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics. Palgrave Macmillan, London. \\"Indicative planning aims to coordinate private and public investment and output plans through forecasts or targets. Compliance is voluntary. The underlying logic is that the plan can supply economically valuable information which, as a public good, the market mechanism cannot disseminate efficiently. It may be perceived as a substitute for non-existing forward markets. However, indicative planning takes into account only endogenous market uncertainty, not exogenous uncertainty (technology, foreign trade and so on). Indicative planning has been most consistently and continuously implemented in France and Japan but has been used in many other countries, although decreasingly so since the 1970s.\\" When utilizing indicative planning, the state employs \\"influence, subsidies, grants, and taxes [to affect the economy], but does not compel\\".Alec Nove (1987), \\"Planned Economy,\\" The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics, v. 3, p. 879. Indicative planning is contrasted with directive or mandatory planning, where a state (or other economic unit) sets quotas and mandatory output requirements. Planning by inducement is often referred to as indicative planning. In practice Indicative planning is coordinated information that guides the choices of separate state and private entities in a market economy or mixed economy.http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3404100580.html =France= Indicative planning originated in France after the Second World War by Charles de Gaulle in 1946 to strengthen the French economy and offset the demands of socialists and Communists calling for socialization of the means of production and/or Stalinist command planning. Indicative planning was one aspect of dirigisme that lasted until the 1980s. Indicative planning was carried out by the Commission General du Plan (CGP). The underlying concept behind indicative planning is the early identification of oversupply, bottlenecks and shortages so that state investment behavior can be modified in a timely fashion to reduce the incidence of market disequilibrium, with the goal being a concerted economy.https://docs.google.com/gview?a=v&q;=cache:UtOoJ6qgy5QJ:www.econ.umn.edu/~hhe/TEACHING/ECON4337/Frencheconomy.pdf+Indicative+Planning&hl;=en‚â∑=us Policy tools used included export subsidies, R&D; funding, tax breaks, preferential lending by state-owned banks, and a relaxed antitrust policy. The role of indicative planning in the French economy came to an end in the late 1980s as France prepared to join the European Union, as the CGP lost national economic autonomy and the European Commission pressured France to further privatize its state-owned enterprises and integrate into the common European market. =People's Republic of China= Since the 1978 economic reforms in China, the state reduced its role to directing economic activity rather than managing it through directive plans. By the early 21st century, the Chinese government had limited the role of directive mandatory planning to goods of national importance and large-scale construction, while increasing the scope of indicative planning and market forces in all other sectors of the economy.http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/111803/China/71005/The-role- of-the-government#ref=ref589614 The current Chinese socialist market economy is largely based on market forces for consumer goods and indicative planning for heavy industry in the public sector. =Union of Soviet Socialist Republics= The Soviet Union utilized indicative plans for its state-run economy up until 1928, before they were integrated into mandatory planning under the Supreme Council of the National Economy and later by the Gosplan.http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3404100580.html Alexei Kosygin's 1965 Soviet economic reform tried to introduce some sort of indicative planning in the USSR. =Japan= The Japanese government practiced indicative planning through the Japanese Economic Planning Agency. National economic planning The term National Economic Planning is associated with government's effort to coordinate the working of both the public sector and the private sector through a structured mechanism. Although, during the 20th century, the term was more associated with the communist and eastern economies, through the 1970s, theorists and practitioners documented the growth of this practice amongst western economies too . In the latter part of the 20th century and till date, economists have demanded that underdeveloped and developing countries ‚Äî especially in continents like Africa ‚Äî should embrace National Economic Planning to a large extent . Famous proponents and practitioners of National Economic Planning have been Nobel Prize‚Äìwinning Russian politician Leonid Kantorovich, John M Hartwick , Carl Landauer (who, in 1947, wrote one of the first western books on the subject, titled Theory of National Economic Planning), American Republican politician Alf Landon, the Russian born Canadian politician David Lewis, Chinese politician Zhang Baoshun and German sociologist Adolph Lowe.

High definition models =Sony HDR-HC1= The Sony HDR-HC1, introduced in mid-2005 (MSRP $1999 US), was the first HDV CMOS camcorder to support 1080i. The CMOS sensor has a resolution of 1920x1440 for digital still pictures and captures video at 1440x1080 interlaced. The camera supports digital image stabilization. The camcorder can convert captured HDV data to DV data for editing using non-linear editing systems which do not support HDV or for creating edits which are viewable on non-HDTV television sets. The HVR-A1 is the prosumer version of the HDR-HC1, having additional manual controls and XLR ports. =Sony HDR-HC5= The Sony HDR-HC5, introduced in May 2007 (MSRP $1099 US), was the third DV tape HDV CMOS camcorder to support 1080i. The 1/3\\" CMOS sensor has a resolution of 2MP and interlaced 4MP for digital still pictures and captures video at 1440x1080 interlaced. Digital photos can be stored on a Sony Memory Stick. It requires a minimum of 2Lux. =Sony HDR-HC7= The Sony HDR-HC7, introduced in 2008 (MSRP $1399 US), was another DV tape HDV CMOS camcorder to support 1080i. The 1/2.9 CMOS sensor has a resolution of 3MP and interlaced 6.1MP for digital still pictures and captures video at 1440x1080 interlaced. The camera includes a manual focus wheel, mic and headphone jacks, and a slightly larger imaging sensor, producing 3200K gross pixels versus the HC5' 2100K. The HC7 also sports Sony's Super SteadyShot Optical Image Stabilization System. In December 2007, Sony released the HD1000, the shouldermount version of the HC7. Its advantage include much more stable off-tripod footage; full-size zoom control; custom ring to manually control focusing, exposure (iris and gain), zoom, or shutter speed; support for a large video light on its front coldshoe; and wireless audio. =Sony HDR-FX1= Sony HDR-FX1 The Sony HDR-FX1, introduced in late 2004, was the first HDV 3 CCD camcorder to support 1080i (1440 X 1080 resolution with 4:2:0 color sampling). The Sony HVR-Z1U is the \\"professional\\" version of this camera with additional features such as balanced XLR audio inputs, DVCAM recording, and extended DSP capabilities (i.e. cine/gamma controls). The HDR-FX1 includes three 1/3-inch 16:9 1.12 Megapixel gross CCDs. Each CCD measures 960 x 1080 pixels. It includes a 12x optical Carl Zeiss Vario-Sonnar T* lens, a 3.5-inch LCD screen, a zoom ring, focus ring, and an iris / aperture ring. Cineframe The FX1 offers Cineframe shooting modes at 30 and 24 frames per second. The camera uses an interlaced image but extracts progressive images from individual fields by doubling them. The 30fps and 24fps do not offer the same resolution as true progressive scanning. The 24fps Cineframe shooting mode does not offer the same resolution, or motion cadence as true 24fps progressive scanning. Known Flaw When the audio mode of HDR-FX1/HDR-FX1E camcorder is switched to the 16-bit setting (in DV mode) and the unit is then turned off, the unit resets to the default 12-bit setting, though the LCD indicator of the unit continues to display the 16-bit audio setting. =Sony HDR-FX7= The Sony HDR-FX7, was introduced in September 2006. The new camcorder is the first camcorder below $3,000 to offer full 1080 HD resolution with a three-chip sensor. * Resolution: Sony claims \\"full\\" 1080 HD * Sensor: changed to 3 x 1/4\\" ClearVid CMOS * Light sensitivity: worse by 33% (4lux) * Zoom: increased to 20x optical zoom (30x digital) * Lens/filter: decreased to 62mm/bayonet mount * Optical Image Stabilizator (OIS, SteadyShot 4 settings) * Video out: included HDMI * Weight: reduced to 1.6 kg (3.52 lb.) The company claims that HDR-FX7 has much improved resolution (full 1080 HD) under good lighting. In low-light situations, Sony FX1 will still produce better results. =Sony HDR-SR1/HDR-SR5/HDR-SR7= The Sony HDR-SR1, introduced in late 2006, was Sony's first high definition hard disk drive based camcorder. It launched with a 30 gigabyte internal drive and - along with the Sony HDR-UX1 - is the first camcorder that records high definition video in AVCHD format. In June 2007, Sony released two new AVCHD format HD Hard Disk camcorders, a 40GB (HDR-SR5) and 60GB model (HDR-SR7), both of which add the ability to record Dolby Digital 5.1. =Sony HDR-CX7= In June 2007, Sony released the HDR-CX7, the first Sony AVCHD camcorder to record video to a memory card. The product comes bundled with a 4GB Memory Stick Duo that holds 30 mins of HD video. Sony HDR-CX7 weighs 15 ounces with the supplied battery and can record nearly one hour of full HD 1080 video on an 8-GB memory. It can record longer videos at lower resolution or quality. This handycam features a crash-proof recording system. It is equipped with a 6.1-megapixel CMOS image sensor and a 5.4-54mm/F1.8-2.9 zoom lens. It saves files with a resolution of 1440 * 1080i. The video format specifies a rectangular pixel shape. Most players render this as 1920 * 1080 format after adjusting for the rectangular pixels. For this camera, the maximum recording rate is 15 Mbit/s. =Sony HDR-CX12= In August 2008, Sony released the successor to the HDR-CX7, the HDR-CX12, with a retail price of $899.99. Major features include: * 1920x1080i Recording * 1/3\\" ClearVid CMOS sensor * Dolby Digital 5.1 audio * 10.2MP still image capture * Face Detection and Smile Shutter technology =Sony HDR-CX500V= Sony released the HDR-CX500V in 2009. The CX500V added GPS tagging capability, a new 1/2.8-inch sensor, and enhanced optical image stabilization. =Sony HVR-Z1= The Sony HVR-Z1 is a professional, broadcast quality, HDV camcorder. It is popular for producers of documentaries and other television programs because of its small size and relatively low cost. It records in 1080i. It uses the DV recording format however it can record in DV, DVCAM and HDV versions of the format. It can also record in PAL (25 frames) and NTSC (30 frames). =Sony HVR-Z5= The Sony HVR-Z5 was introduced in October 2008. It uses Sony's new G-Lens, alongside the 3 ClearVid CMOS Sensor system, which works well in low light. The HVR-Z5E can switch between HDV 1080i, DVCAM and standard DV recording. =Sony HVR-Z7/HVR-S270= The Sony HVR-Z7 and HVR-S270 video cameras, introduced in early 2008, were the first 3 CMOS sensor HDV camcorder that records on tape and/or CF card. In previous prosumer models, Sony released model pairs that shared the same optics and sensors, such as the VX2000/PD150, VX2100/PD170, Z1/FX1, and V1/FX7; where the VX/FX was the consumer version and the PD/Z was the professional/prosumer version. The consumer models lacked professional features such as XLR inputs and some manual controls. The HVR-Z7 breaks this pattern as it has all professional features of previous prosumer models, and has no consumer equivalent, although it has a larger shoulder-mounted sister camera, the HVR-S270. Both video cameras feature interchangeable lenses. They attain low light sensitivity similar to the SD low light leader, the Sony DSR- PD170, and offer interlaced and progressive recording in HDV, DVCAM, and DV formats. Compact Flash recording is achieved by a supplied CF card recorder that is removable and connects via a proprietary firewire connection or 6 pin firewire. =Sony HDR-FX1000/HVR-Z5= The first true successors to the HDR- FX1 and the HVR-Z1, the HDR-FX1000 and HVR-Z5 were released in autumn 2008. They employ the same Exmor 1/3\\" 3CMOS design as the Z7/S270, and the Z5 is bundled with the same CF card recorder as the Z7, but the physical designs more closely resemble that of the FX1 and Z1. Both models support interlaced and progressive scan recording. HVR-Z5 has native progressive recording. Both models have the 1-megapixel XtraFine LCD screen included in the EX1, Z7, and SR11/12. These camcorders introduced Sony G Lenses. The zoom range extends 20x, 29.5-595 35mm equivalent. It has a wider view angle than most fixed lenses in this price range. =Sony HDR-GW= The Sony HDR-GW55 was introduced in 2012 and is designed to be held vertically. It is marketed as a waterproof, dustproof and shockresistant Full HD camcorder. It can withstand up to a depth of 5m and accidental drops from 1.5m of height. It comes with a 10 √ó optical zoom lens. It has a GPS function for geolocating photos and videos. Its successor, the HDR-GW66, was released in 2013. It has improved waterproof capabilities. It can withstand up to a depth of 10 meters and temperatures as cold as ‚àí10 ¬∞C. It uses a larger battery which increases recording time considerably. A front button was added for improved usability. High- definition 3D models =Sony HDR-TD10= The TD10 is Sony's first 3D AVCHD camcorder. It records on an internal 64 GB hard drive or onto Sony Memory Stick Pro memory cards, or onto SDHC cards. Released in 2011, it can record a maximum of 28 Mbit/s in 3D or 2D. Its two sensors are 1/4\\" (4.5 mm) and each has gross 4200K pixels, can produce a maximum 5.3-megapixel image in 16:9 (3072x1728).http://store.sony.com/p/HDR-TD10/en/p/HDRTD10 date=2013-02-06 =Sony HDR-TD20V= The TD20 is Sony's second generation of 3D AVCHD camcorder. It has been modified mainly to be a little smaller than TD10 and they also shortened distance between lenses, which makes the 3D effect a little less significant, but it is compensated with internal software. It records on internal 64 GB hard disk or onto Sony Memory Stick Pro storage cards, or onto SDHC cards. Released in 2012, it can record to max 28 Mbit/s in 3D or 2D. Its two sensors are 1/3.91\\" (4.6 mm) and each has gross 5430K pixels, and can produce a maximum 20.4-megapixel image in 16:9 (6016x3384).http://store.sony.com/p/Handycam-Full- HD-3D-Camcorder/en/p/HDRTD20V date=2013-02-06 =Sony HDR-TD30V= The TD30 is Sony's third iteration of the TD10 model. It records only onto Sony Memory Stick Pro memory cards, or onto SDHC cards. Sony removed the manual focus knob. Released in 2013, it can record a maximum of 28 Mbit/s in 3D or 2D. Its two sensors are 1/3.91\\" (4.6 mm) and each has gross 5430K pixels, can produce a maximum 20.4-megapixel image in 16:9 (6016√ó3384).http://store.sony.com/p/Sony-Handycam-Full- HD-3D-Camcorder/en/p/HDRTD30V date=2013-02-06 High definition 'NX' range =Sony HXR-NX5= The NX5 is Sony's first professional AVCHD camcorder. It records either onto Sony Memory Stick Pro memory cards, or onto SDHC cards. An optional 128Gb Flash Memory unit provides up to 11 hours of recording time. It can record in Standard Definition using MPEG2 format, or up to 1920 x 1080 images at 24Mbit/s in High Definition mode in the AVCHD format. The camera is almost identical to the HVR-Z5, some people calling it the 'Tapeless version of the Z5'. =Sony HXR-MC50E= This compact camera comes with a 3.5mm audio input ‚Äì not a balanced XLR input. It records up to 6 hours of full HD on 64Gb internal memory.  Ultra high definition models Camcorders that support resolution of 3840√ó2160 (UHD also known as 4K) =Sony FDR-AX100= In January 2014, Sony released its first consumer UHD Camcorder. The AX100 is able to capture video at 3840√ó2160 resolution at 30p using a 1\\" Exmor R CMOS sensor. It uses a full sensor readout instead of line skipping which provides very high detail with minimal aliasing or moir√©. It captures video using 14MP and then resizes the image to 8MP. It can capture photos at 20 MP. The highest quality video output uses XAVC S format based on MPEG-4 AVC/H.264 compression. Typical data rates are about 60 Mbit/s in this mode (100 Mbit/s in the firmware version 3.00). The SDXC memory card class 10 is required for XAVC S recording (SDXC class 10 U3 is required for 100 Mbit/s recording). The Zeiss Vario Sonnar T* Lens provides a 12x optical zoom which starts at 29mm equivalent wide-angle. There is an optional 24x Clear Image zoom which zooms by using a smaller number of pixels until it matches the resolution of the output. Digital zoom can extend to 160x although with progressively degrading quality. Optical SteadyShot Image Stabilization has an optional mode called Intelligent Active Mode which using digital techniques on top of the optical stabilization to stabilize even more aggressively. The AX100 has neutral density filters built into the camera which is rare for a consumer camera. It can be set to automatic or manual control with the following settings: Off, 1/4, 1/16, and 1/64. The AX100 provides both an EVF (0.39\\" OLED) and LCD screen (3.5\\" 0.921 MP). The multi-interface accessory shoe allows connection to an external flash or stereo microphones. The remote control interface is available via the multi-terminal port. =Sony FDR-AX33= In March 2015, Sony released this smaller, lighter weight UHD camcorder using a 1/2.3\\" sensor with many of the same features as the AX100. With this camcorder, Sony introduced \\"Balanced Optical SteadyShot\\" (BOSS), essentially a floating lens/sensor block combination to reduce shake. It comes with a 10x lens. Along with the reduced size is the reduced size EVF (0.24\\") and LCD screen (3.0\\" 0.921 MP).http://store.sony.com/4k-camcorder-with-1-2.3-sensor- zid27-FDRAX33/B/cat-27-catid-All-Handycam-Camcorders =Sony FDR-AX53= Introduced in 2016, this camcorder improves on the previous versions with the addition of bigger pixels in the same 1/2.5 sensor, hot shoe for an external microphone accessary, and in addition to optical steady shot, there is now 5 axis sensor stabilization, but it's disabled in 4k.

Overview It would give unincorporated areas of at least 500 acres (approximately two square kilometers or 0.8 square miles) the power to regulate zoning and other land use, and to levy a maximum annual property tax of a half-mill (0.5‚Ä∞), managed by a board of supervisors selected in nonpartisan elections in odd-numbered years. All other services and laws would remain the responsibility of the county. The bill would also require a population density of 200 persons per square mile (77.22/km2, or one person per 3.2 acres), and that at least 10% of the included area be zoned or used for non-residential purposes. It would also allow for the contracting of public utilities and public services, though the bill which passed the state senate added the exception of cable TV. Local legislation would be required to create a township or convert it to a municipality. A referendum would also be required, as well for the township to be annexed by a municipality. Deannexation by a township could be done by a vote of the board of supervisors if a landowner makes such a request, but it may not bring the township below the minimum requirements. Annexation may not be done solely down the length of a right of way, such as to make an annexation contiguous. An additional requirement added to the final senate bill requires the township to notify the county of any requests for rezoning or new subdivisions, or proposed changes in the land use plan or regulations and ordinances. The county has ten business days to respond with its opinions and concerns and any proposed solutions, which must be made part of the township's public record and must be considered by the board prior to making a final decision. The township's final decision must then be forwarded back to the county. This procedure also applies to adjoining municipalities and townships, but not to other counties. It also applies in reciprocal, with adjoining cities or the county notifying the township of changes which might affect it. A township may be in more than one county. Counties may create special service districts at the request of a township. While the bill explicitly states that a \\"township\\" would not be a municipality, the definitions set forth in the law make it nearly identical in function to villages or hamlets in some other states, including neighboring North Carolina and Florida, where they are the lowest level of a three-tiered system of municipalities. One major factor in this comparison is that, unlike most minor civil divisions, the proposed areas would be very small in size, and together would not cover the entire or even a large part of a county. The other major factor is that, like any municipality, they would not be subject to involuntary annexation by nearby cities (which for several decades have been the only type of municipality allowed under the Georgia State Constitution). The township designation may therefore be in order to avoid a broader and hence more complicated and politically charged overhaul of local government classifications in the state. =Basis= The idea grew from dissatisfaction in several places with county governments, which have often allowed excessive or disorganized land development. While larger unincorporated communities like Dunwoody are still pressing for cityhood, others such as Vinings and Tucker (all in metro Atlanta) and St. Simons Island would have another option under the bill, which is intended as a compromise for those who want more local control, but not the significantly higher taxes incurred by having to provide state-required city services. Legislative history The Georgia Senate bill (SB 89), also has an accompanying resolution (SR 130) which would provide for the constitutional amendment necessary to allow for such a change. If passed in a November 2008 referendum, it would have been effective on the first day of 2009. The bill was introduced by David Adelman of Decatur, and was also sponsored by senators Chip Pearson, Dan Weber, Tim Golden, Doug Stoner, and J. Powell of the 42nd, 51st, 40th, 8th, 6th, and 23rd districts, respectively. The senate passed the bill, 43‚Äì10, on March 27, the 30th and last business day (\\"crossover day\\") of the current session for bills to pass at least one house and cross over to the other for consideration that year. The passed bill creates a new chapter 93 under title 36 of the OCGA. Another bill (HB 651) would have made several changes, including allowing county superior courts to approve townships, but did not pass. That bill would have amended chapter 31 (also under title 36) instead. Ultimately, the original bill (along with one to incorporate Dunwoody) failed to gain passage before the end of the session, but was likely to be reintroduced in 2008. Also considered in the 2007 Georgia General Assembly were bills to allow counties to object to the annexation of cities, though it is unclear whether this would apply to annexations by the proposed townships. Currently, a county may only object to the first annexation of its area by a city which is only in an adjacent county. There is no formal process for blocking an annexation however.

It was written and created by Janice Karman, produced by Ross Bagdasarian, and directed by Jerry Rees. It was produced by Bagdasarian Productions, and was released on DVD in 2003 by Paramount Home Entertainment. It features puppetry used for the Chipmunks and the Chipettes. To date, this is the Chipmunks' last direct-to-video movie. Plot The movie opens with La-Lu, a friend of David Seville, putting up a banner saying \\"Welcome Chipmunks\\" on the porch of her magic cottage. One of her friends, Gilda (a talking pessimistic cockatoo) believes that having children around is a bad idea. PC (a talking laid back frog with a surfer dude accent who believes he is one kiss away from being Prince Charming) says that his mom used to say \\"nothing warms up a home like children's laughter\\". Dave arrives with Alvin, Brittany, Simon, Jeanette, Theodore, and Eleanor. Dave needs the weekend to himself to write a new song, and La-Lu is happy to have five pre-schoolers and a baby stay with her and her friends. Sam and Lou, two gophers, report to the viewers at home about the feelings the characters are experiencing via going into their heads and viewing an abstract inner visual manifestation of what the characters are thinking and or feeling. Alvin doesn't like that Dave is gone, and La-Lu explains that she felt the same way when she was little and reassures him that Dave will return for him and the others soon. They play the role of Peter Pan and Captain Hook for a while. Later, La-Lu tells Gilda, Alvin and Brittany a story about a sea serpent attacking a ship, when Simon comes in all wet. Simon explains that the toilet exploded, and it was caused by Theodore. La-Lu sees that the toilet is filled with a hair brush, toothpaste, a toy horse, shoes, squeaky toys, etc. Gilda tells PC that he was supposed to be watching Theodore. Feeling scared, Theodore lies and said it was Gilda (Sometimes I Lie). La-Lu comforts Theodore and explains that she was mad about the toilet exploding at first, but then remembered that we all make mistakes sometimes; she tells Theodore of a time she made a mistake, and her father taught her how mistakes are easy to learn from. Even the toilet even comes to life to voice her displeasure over the experience. After hearing this, Theodore tells the truth and vows to never play with the toilet again, and La-Lu congratulates him. Later, she gets him ready for his nap. As La-Lu is entertaining baby Eleanor, Brittany comes in saying that Jeanette stole and ate her lipstick. As PC sings \\"Rock-a-Bye Chipmunk\\" to Eleanor, Alvin and Simon try to steal a napping Theodore's teddy bear with a fishing line, but La-Lu stops them. Alvin explains that he and Simon didn't have any toys to play with, until La-Lu opens a shelf full of stuffed animals. La-Lu explains to Jeanette that eating lipstick could be a problem - for one, it wasn't hers; and two, lipstick isn't good for your body. Jeanette decides to buy Brittany another lipstick, but doesn't have any money. La-Lu suggests that Jeanette work for her, so she could earn enough money to do so; Jeanette agrees. Alvin comes in dressed as \\"Super Alvin\\", hiding from Simon who is dressed as a magician. Simon demands his cape back. They get into a fight, until La-Lu intervenes, suggesting that they figure out a way to take turns with the cape. Suddenly, Jeanette comes in, dressed in yellow boots, an apron, gloves, a smog mask, ear covers and a feather duster (surprising Alvin and Simon), saying that she was ready for work; she cleans everyone's shoes, makes La-Lu's bed, dusts off the furniture, scrubs the kitchen floor (with sponges tied to her boots), helps La-Lu with the groceries, and helps La-Lu with baking muffins (Jeanette confuses flour with a flower) (I'm So Sorry). Jeanette eventually makes enough money to buy Brittany a new lipstick. Meanwhile, Simon turns on a fan to help \\"Super Alvin\\" fly in the air, but he ultimately falls. Afterwards, Alvin and Simon try to use his magic to bring Simon's dead plant back to live and it works. (However, this was only Sam and Lou's doing.) That night at dinner, they get a call from Dave. The children explain what they did that day, and soon after a story (The Blue Bird), everyone falls asleep in La-Lu's bed. Next day, Alvin and Simon take some tin foil, with Simon saying that it will change the face of science forever. As Theodore follows his brothers, Brittany comes in saying that Jeanette stole her oven. Jeanette claims she \\"borrowed\\" it. She explains that every time she asks, Brittany always says no. As Jeanette leaves to clean up the mess, a coin falls from Brittany's pocket. She explains that Tyler from school gave it to her, but Gilda comes in and says Tyler's mom called, saying that Tyler lost his coin. Then La-Lu explains to Brittany that we sometimes take things that aren't ours because we really, really want them; she also explains that it is okay to be sad, but it is not okay to take things that aren't ours. Brittany realizes that Tyler is feeling bad, and has to give back his coin. Meanwhile, as La-Lu and Brittany go to Tyler's to return his coin, Alvin and Simon have used the tin foil to build a spaceship, pretending to be aliens. Theodore wants in on the fun, but his brothers say no, hurting Theodore's feelings (Why Can't We Play?). Feeling sad and angry at the same time, Theodore feels the need to hit Alvin. La-Lu explains that it's okay to feel upset, but it is never okay to hit others. She shows Theodore something that he can hit; a bear-shaped balloon dummy. Suddenly, Alvin comes and invites Theodore to play. As they prepare for a tea party, Brittany explains that she feels much better about everything. Then Jeanette comes in after cleaning Brittany's oven, after which Brittany invites Jeanette to their tea time. Meanwhile, Gilda tries to teach Eleanor (the infant) how to be a \\"proper lady\\". As La-Lu, Brittany and Jeanette enjoy their tea party, Simon dressed in tin foil surprises everyone, chasing off Brittany and Jeanette. Then Alvin with Theodore and PC on his shoulders, dressed in tin foil as well surprise La-Lu, who takes Eleanor with her as she runs away from the \\"monster\\". Sam and Lou also surprise Gilda by dressing up in tin foil. That night, La-Lu prepares Alvin for bed in the big bed, after having some fun with him. The next day, Alvin, Brittany, Jeanette and Simon wake La-Lu up to tell her that she's in their band. La-Lu asks them to wait while she takes care of a fussy Eleanor (Baby Baby Baby). After many attempts, La-Lu decides to call the doctor. The reason for her crying is that she had to burp and now needs her diaper changed. Seeing how much time La-Lu is spending with Eleanor, Alvin starts to become jealous (Dumped for Someone New). La-Lu comforts Alvin, and shows that even though she had to help the baby, she still has plenty of love to go around, even for him. They decide to have special time together whenever Eleanor has her nap, and that Alvin can help with Eleanor, to which Alvin agrees. Suddenly, Dave arrives, having finished his song, and the Chipmunks and the Chipettes offer to help practice (Friends). The movie closes with Alvin turning off the lights in the house mischievously, despite Dave's protests.

History The ethnic group was first known to Westerners in the 1920s, when the language was already considered in severe decline (Kerr 1927). In the 1970s, David Bradley began working on the language in the several areas where it was still used, by which time it was already extinct in two of the locations given by Kerr (1927) about 50 years earlier. The people were then forced from two of these villages when the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand built dams over the Kwae Yai and Khwae Noi River (Bradley 1989). Because of the displacement of the people of an already declining language, the language is considered especially vulnerable to extinction. The last children speakers were in the 1970s and the children now speak Thai as their first language. Classification The classification of Gong within Tibeto-Burman is uncertain, although Bradley (1989) suggests that it is a divergent Lolo-Burmese language that does not fit into either the Burmish or Loloish branches. Dialects The Gong language consists of two dialects (Ethnologue). *Khok Khwai village, Uthai Thani Province (moribund); documented by Rujjanavet (1986) *Kok Chiang village, Suphan Buri Province (endangered and now dispersed); documented by Thawornpat (2006) and David Bradley Gong was once also spoken in western Kanchanaburi Province, but is now extinct in that province (Ethnologue). Word lists of two Gong varieties (namely Lawa of Kw√™ Yai and Lawa of Kw√™ Noi) from Kanchanaburi have been collected by Kerr (1927). Distribution Gong families now live in the following 3 villages.Mayuree, Thawornpat. 2006. Gong: An endangered language of Thailand. Doctoral dissertation, Mahidol University. *Lawa Wang Khwai village, Wang Yao Subdistrict (‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏á‡∏¢‡∏≤‡∏ß), Dan Chang District, Suphanburi Province (3 families) *Kok Chiang village, Huai Khamin Subdistrict (‡∏´‡πâ‡∏ß‡∏¢‡∏Ç‡∏°‡∏¥‡πâ‡∏ô), Dan Chang District, Suphanburi Province (36 families) *Khok Khwai village (‡∏Ñ‡∏≠‡∏Å‡∏Ñ‡∏ß‡∏≤‡∏¢), Thong Lang Subdistrict (‡∏ó‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏´‡∏•‡∏≤‡∏á), Huai Khot District, Uthai Thani Province (15 families); reported as Baan Lawa village 3 in Wright, et al. (1991). There are around 500 ethnic Gong people and 50 speakers of the Gong language. There are also many Lao Krang people living in the Gong areas. =Former locations= Gong used to be much more widespread, and was found in the Khwae Noi River, Khwae Yai River, and Bo Phloi River watersheds (Bradley 1989).Bradley, David (1989). Dying to be Thai: Ugong in western Thailand. La Trobe Working Papers in Linguistics 2:19-28.

Sisawat and Sangkhlaburi have since been flooded by the construction of a dam, and the speakers have been dispersed to other places. As of 1991 in Kanchanaburi Province, Gong has not been spoken for 20-30 years, with most Gong people speaking Thai or Karen instead.Wright, Sue; Audra Phillips; Brian Migliazza; Paulette Hopple; and Tom Tehan. 1991.

Didrik Ficks Gr√§nd (Swedish: \\"Alley of Didrik Fick\\") is an alley in Gamla stan, the old town of Stockholm, Sweden. Stretching from V√§sterl√•nggatan to Stora Nygatan, it forms a parallel street to Sven Vintappares Gr√§nd and Yxsmedsgr√§nd while passing on the south side of the small square Sven Vintappares Torg. History Mentioned as Dirich Fiskes grendh in 1617, Diedrik Fischers gr√§nd in 1674, and Diedrich Ficks Gr√§nd in 1800, the alley is named after a merchant and innkeeper, most likely bearing the genuine name Didrich Fischer and immigrating from Germany. The man in question is mentioned in 1620 as living in a building in the alley owned by an Erik J√∂ransson Tegel. The alley was named J√∂ran Perssons gr√§nd in 1563 after the latter's father, J√∂ran Persson, one of the advisers of King Eric XIV. The name of the alley appears as Swedish variations of the name the German man, before being named Didrich Fischs gr√§nd on a map dated 1733. In Number 3 facing the small square was, presumably, a poorhouse in the 18th century, following the unsuccessful wars of Charles XII crowded with soldiers, poor, and vagrants, finally forcing the authorities to issue a decree urging idle people to give precedence to disabled.

The probable date of its town rights is 1393. Several years after the uprising of 1 January 1870, Pilica lost its town rights under the Tsar's ukase of June 1, 1869, until it was regained in 1994. Jewish community Jews are first mentioned in Pilica in 1581, when they are accused of insulting the host. The historian Meier Balaban notes in his book The History of the Jews of Krak√≥w and Kazimierz 1304‚Äì1868 (in Polish): ‚ÄúIn the 16th Century the Jewish Kehilla of Krakow was subdivided into seven regional districts: Olkusz, Chrzanow, Wisnicz, Sacz, Bobowa, Pilica, Bedzin, Oshpitzin, and Wolbrom.‚Äù Rabbi Pinchas Eliyahu Rotenberg, the nephew of Rabbi Yitzchak Meir Alter of Gur was rabbi of the town until his death in 1903.

It was organized on August 15, 1821, with $100,000 in capital.History of Bristol County, Massachusetts The mill began operation in 1822, with Samuel Rodman of New Bedford as the principal owner. Oliver Chace, served as the mill's agent until 1837. Nathaniel Briggs BordenBORDEN, Nathaniel Briggs - Biographical Information was named clerk and treasurer.History of Bristol County, Massachusetts pg 371http://www.sailsinc.org/durfee/phillips2-13.pdf The Pocasset Mills were the site of the origin of the Great Fall River Fire of 1928. The mills were destroyed along with a vast portion of the city's business district. History In the company's early years, it primarily constructed mills for their various tenants. The first development scheme was intended to enlarge the grist mill, but with Oliver Chace, the grist mill was razed for the erection of a new mill for the production of textiles. The old fulling mill remained. Referred to as the \\"Bridge Mill\\", the new mill was constructed from stone with three stories, and measured 100 feet long by 40 feet wide, with a large ell. It was located west of Main Street, immediately north of the Fall River stream.A centennial history of Fall River, Mass., Atlantic Pub. and Engraving Co., 1877 In 1821, the machinery firm of Harris, Hawes & Company occupied two floors of a building put up for their use by the Pocasset Company. The basement was still used as a grist mill and they also built a water-wheel to raise the water to a convenient level for laundry. The \\"Bridge Mill\\" and the fulling mill were destroyed in the Great Fire of 1843. The company built the original Granite Block here a few years after the fire. It became the center of business activity in Fall River for many years. In 1825, the stone Satinet Mill was erected. It was partly occupied by the first calico printing business in Fall River, set up by Andrew Robeson.The Story of Textile pg 228 The south half was occupied by John and Jesse Eddy for the manufacture of satinets. It was made 3-5 story building made of Fall River granite. It was demolished in 1846 for construction of the new Pocasset Mill #1. West of the printing mill, the Quequechan Mill was built in 1826. It was called the \\"New Pocasset\\" and was leased for a yarn mill. Considered an extremely large mill for its time, it was a five story stone building that was 319 ft long and 48 feet wide. It contained 16,392 spindles and 492 looms.A centennial history of Fall River, Mass pg 119 It was in the Quequechan Mill that Holder Borden set up the cloth printing business that would later become the American Print Works. This mill was demolished about 1880 for expansion of Pocasset Mills #2 and #3. Also in 1825, the Watuppa Reservoir Company, was incorporated under a special statute by the Massachusetts and Rhode Island state legislature. It was authorized to make reservations of water in the ponds by erecting a dam to raise the water by two feet. Nathaniel Briggs Borden as a member of this private entity, enabled Pocasset Manufacturing to take advantage of the increase in the river flow speed to allow them to build more mills for lease. Previously use of land and waterfalls were controlled by Troy Cotton & Woolen Manufactory.History of Bristol County, Massachusetts pg 370. The Watuppa Reservoir Company built a dam below the Troy Company dam. In 1826 the Pocasset constructed still another stone building which was known as the Massasoit Mill and later called the Watuppa Mill. This mill had 9,000 spindles, 224 looms Bureau of Statistics of Labor, Massachusetts - 1895 This mill was later operated as Pocasset Mill #4. It was destroyed by fire along with the main plant in February 1928. In 1847, the Pocasset Mill #1 commenced running. Built on the site of the Satinet Mill, it was a five story stone building that was 208 ft long and 75 feet wide. It was the first of the so- called \\"wide\\" mills and contained 20,352 spindles and 422 looms. The machinery was run by three turbine wheels, which were later supplemented by a Corliss engine fed by a steam plant with eighteen condensers.Bureau of Statistics of Labor, Massachusetts - 1895 The building had its own fire apparatus including pumps and sprinklers.

Born in Briton Ferry, Glamorgan, he left school aged thirteen when his father died. After initially working in an outfitters shop, he subsequently entered the local steel works. From the age of sixteen he was a preacher in the Congregational Church. Mort joined the Independent Labour Party in 1906, and in 1915 became South Wales secretary of the Steel Trades Confederation. He was also involved in local politics as a member of Briton Ferry Urban District Council and Neath Borough Council. At the 1929 general election, he was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Eccles. The Second Labour Government formed after the election subsequently collapsed and a National Government was formed. The government went to the country in a general election in October 1931. Mort, along with the majority of Labour MPs, lost his seat. Mort stood, unsuccessfully, at the 1935 general election in Bilston. He was returned to the House of Commons as MP for Swansea East at an unopposed by-election in 1940, following the death of the Labour MP David Williams. He held the seat until his own death in 1963 aged 74, triggering another by-election.

She originally appeared in comic books published by Nedor Comics, and was later revived by AC Comics, America's Best Comics, and Dynamite Entertainment. Nedor Comics Miss Masque is the secret identity of Diana Adams, a young socialite who decides to fight crime and injustice in disguise. Miss Masque has no super powers, but relies on her wit and a pair of pistols. Her original costume was a mini- skirted red dress with red hat, gloves and cape, and a domino mask; yellow double \\"M\\" emblems on her chest and hat completed the ensemble. A later version of the costume had a bare midriff and shorter sleeves. Miss Masque first appeared in Nedor Comics' Exciting Comics #51 (September 1946). She also appeared in America's Best Comics (not to be confused with the DC Comics imprint), Fighting Yank, and Black Terror; her final Golden Age appearance was America's Best Comics #31 (July 1949). According to Jess Nevins' Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes, \\"She takes on ordinary murderers, murderers who dress like the devil to do their dirty work, crooked fight promoters, the insane caretaker of an Egyptian museum, and so on.\\" There was no writer or artist credited for Miss Masque's first appearance. Alex Schomburg and Frank Frazetta provided art for later cover appearances, and Ralph Mayo penciled some splash pages. The character's run in Exciting Comics ended with issue #54 (March 1947), and she then moved to America's Best Comics from issue #23 (Sept 1947) to #31 (July 1949). AC Comics Miss Masque on the cover of AC Comics' Miss Masque #1 (2003). Miss Masque is one of the many Golden Age characters revived by AC Comics in the early 1990s. The new version debuted in AC Annual #2 (1991). In AC continuity, Diana Adams is a Canadian socialite visiting New Orleans for Mardi Gras. Having forgotten to bring a costume for a party, she looks for one in a curio shop on Bourbon Street. The shop owner attempts to tell Adams that the costume is possessed by the \\"spirit of justice\\". As Adams is in a hurry, she ignores the warning, buys the outfit, and quickly leaves. When the party is interrupted by robbers, Adams stops the criminals and saves the life of a fellow partygoer. Finding herself strangely satisfied by the experience, she decides to make crime fighting her full-time occupation. In her AC Comics debut story, Miss Masque is revealed to be one of a group of 1940s era crime fighters that agreed to enter the Vault of Heroes, a stasis chamber designed to keep the heroes in suspended animation until they are needed again. She is revived in the 1990s and joins the Femforce in their fight against the Shroud. She later becomes a member of the Sentinels of Justice. Miss Masque has appeared in several AC Comics titles, including Femforce, Good Girl Art Quarterly, and her own self-titled comic book. AC Comics has also reprinted several Golden Age Miss Masque stories as part of their Golden Age Men of Mystery and Golden Age Greats titles. America's Best Comics/DC The Golden Age version of Miss Masque was revived by Alan Moore for his Tom Strong comics, published by America's Best Comics (now an imprint of DC Comics). Moore used the Nedor Comics characters to populate Terra Obscura, the alternate universe version of Tom Strong's Earth. In Moore's story, the heroes had been placed in suspended animation in 1969 during an alien invasion, and are revived 30 years later by Tom Strong. Miss Masque made her first appearance in Tom Strong #12 (June 2001). Miss Masque subsequently appeared in the Tom Strong spin-off Terra Obscura, written by Peter Hogan from plots developed by Hogan and Moore. Now calling herself Ms. Masque, she becomes a member of the reformed superhero team SMASH. Ms. Masque's costume has been modified, replacing the mini-skirt with a pair of skin-tight pants. She is in a romantic relationship with Carol Carter, also known as the Fighting Spirit (daughter of the deceased Fighting Yank). Dynamite Entertainment Miss Masque has been revived once again as Masquerade in Alex Ross and Jim Krueger's new series from Dynamite Entertainment entitled Project Superpowers. This limited series features many Golden Age characters, revamped and updated for today in a story that shows Ross and Krueger's vision for the fate of these heroes. Masquerade was one of the superheroes who had appeared after World War II, and was then trapped and imprisoned in the Urn of Pandora by the misguided Fighting Yank. When the Urn is broken decades later, she reappears (in Project Superpowers #3) in Japan. Her outfit has been drastically altered from when she first entered the Urn; she now wears a long red overcoat and wide-brimmed hat with a domino mask and two gun halters, and is suffering from amnesia. She finds another hero, V-Man, and the two of them are taken to New York ‚Äî now New Shangri-La ‚Äî along with other heroes who were freed from the Urn. Her time in the Urn has given her literal masking powers ‚Äî she can now replicate another person's appearance (although the seventh issue of the series shows her actually possessing the other person's body). In addition to a person's appearance, Masquerade also gains all their knowledge, including memories and skill sets. Unfortunately, she also tends to briefly believe she is the person whose identity she is copying. It also caused her to fall in love with her teammate V-Man, having learned all about him. In 2009, Dynamite Entertainment gave Masquerade her own mini-series, starting in February and tied in with the Project Superpowers storyline.

They are signed to Translation Loss Records and have released five full-length studio albums and one EP to date. Biography Mouth of the Architect formed in 2003 with the lineup of Jason Watkins (vocals, keyboards), Gregory Lahm (vocals, guitar), Alex Vernon (vocals, guitar), Dave Mann (drums), and Derik Sommer (bass). They released their first album Time and Withering in 2004 on Translation Loss Records. Sommer departed the band in 2005. Soon after the band released a split with label mates Kenoma in 2006, Vernon left, leaving Lahm to record all the guitar parts on their second album The Ties That Blind which was released in August, and featured Brent Hinds of Mastodon on guest vocals on one track. Brian Cook of Botch, Russian Circles, and These Arms are Snakes stood in to play bass on the album. To support The Ties That Blind, the band toured extensively around the United States, while weathering several line-up changes. In 2006 the band toured alongside These Arms Are Snakes, with Dan Wilburn of The Science Logic replacing Vernon on guitar. 2007 saw newcomer Steve Brooks replace Wilburn, followed by a year of near constant touring alongside bands including Mastodon, Rob Crow, Made Out of Babies, Big Business, Torche, Kylessa, 400 Blows, Skeletonwitch and Unsane, among others. The band featured Joe Lester of Intronaut and Kevin Schindel of Twelve Tribes on bass during this time. Their third album, Quietly, was recorded after Lahm in turn left the band, with Vernon returning alongside Brooks to jointly handle guitars and vocals, and Schindel providing bass. Soon after the release of the album in 2008, Vernon left yet again with Schindel switching to guitar. An EP entitled The Violence Beneath followed in 2010, with a headlining European tour to support the record. The tour featured appearances at Roadburn Festival and Asymmetry Festival. Recorded in October 2009 by John Lakes, The Violence Beneath featured two new studio tracks with Joe Lester on bass, an old live track from 2007 as well as a Peter Gabriel cover with Lakes on bass. Evan Danielson joined as permanent bassist following its release. The band returned to the studio in October 2011 to lay down a track for French compilation Falling Down VII which was released the following April. Their fourth full-length album, Dawning, was released in June 2013. Recorded at Brooks' studio in Michigan, the album was self-produced by Brookes and Lakes. A US/Canada tour with Intronaut and Scale the Summit and a headlining European tour took place that summer with Lakes filling in for Schindel during both legs of the tour on guitar. Lakes soon replaced Schindel as a full-time member. Their fifth full- length album, Path of Eight, released in October 2016, was recorded live in the bands' rehearsal space in Dayton over a weekend. It is a concept album \\"about a soul leaving the body after death, traveling through space and time, past the gods, to be torn apart into the nothingness from which we came\\". On 28 March 2018, the band announced the departure of Steve Brooks on their Facebook page and that founding member Alex Vernon had rejoined the band. Schindel, Vernon, Mann and Brooks have been members of the band Twelve Tribes at various points in the past.

The film follows a group of college students stalked and murdered during their graduation party by someone wearing a G.I. uniform. Filmed in late 1980 in Cape May, New Jersey, The Prowler premiered the following fall, and was independently distributed by Sandhurst Films. It was not a major commercial success, ranking 135th overall that year at the U.S. box office, and grossing less than $1 million. Though it has received mixed reviews from critics, The Prowler developed a cult following in the years after its release, and has been noted for its hard- edged violence‚Äîshowcasing special effects by Tom Savini‚Äîas well as its dreamlike atmosphere. It has been named one of the greatest slasher films of all time by several publications, including Complex and Paste magazine. The Prowler is often compared to another slasher film of the same year with a similar plot, My Bloody Valentine.  Plot  On March 12, 1945 in Avalon, California, during World War II, a woman named Rosemary writes a letter to her boyfriend, breaking up with him. Three months later, Rosemary is attending a graduation dance with her new boyfriend Roy, who suggests they go out to lovers lane. While there, they are attacked by a mysterious prowler in an army combat uniform, who impales them both with a pitchfork and leaves behind a rose. 35 years later, college senior Pam MacDonald is making last-minute arrangements for that night's graduation ball, the first to be held since the 1945 murders. Helping Pam are her friends Lisa, Sherry and Sherry's love interest Carl. Later while visiting her boyfriend and the town's deputy, Mark London, Pam overhears a report of a prowler. She expresses her concern about Mark's safety because the sheriff is leaving town for a fishing trip. Mark reassures her and promises to meet her at the dance. Pam then heads back to the dorm to get ready and eventually leaves with her friends. Sherry stays behind to shower and receives a surprise visit from Carl. While undressing, he is attacked and killed with a bayonet. The killer then impales Sherry with a pitchfork in the shower. At the dance, Pam spots Mark and motions him over. As he walks towards her, Lisa asks him to dance. Mark agrees, which upsets Pam. Mark then walks over to Pam and the two share a brief but tense exchange. A moment later, Lisa walks up and bumps Mark, which causes him to spill his drink on her dress. She returns to the dorm to change and is chased by the same prowler, but escapes. She runs outside into the wheelchair-bound Major Chatham who grabs her arm. Pam escapes his grasp and soon reunites with Mark. She tells him about the prowler so he investigates. After checking the dorm, Mark only finds bootprints and wheelchair tracks outside. The two then go investigate the Major's home. Pam realizes that his daughter was Rosemary and that her killer was never caught. Convinced the prowler from earlier is the same killer, Mark and Pam head back to the dance and warn the chaperone, Allison, about the possible danger. Meanwhile, Lisa goes out to a nearby pool to cool off and encounters the killer, who slits her throat. Paul, Lisa's boyfriend, is arrested by Mark for public intoxication. Allison goes to find Lisa but is stabbed and killed also. Mark and Pam go to investigate the cemetery and discover an opened grave with Lisa's body in it. Mark tries to call the cabin that the sheriff went to, but is ignored by the site worker. Mark next calls the state police for help. He informs Pam that the state police told him that the reported prowler had been caught three hours earlier, and could not have killed Lisa. Pam suspects that Lisa's killer is the same killer who murdered Rosemary and her boyfriend in 1945. They go to investigate Major Chatham's house again. Mark is attacked as the prowler chases Pam through the house. Otto appears and shoots the prowler, but he recovers and shoots Otto dead with a shotgun before again attacking Pam. While pinned to the ground, Pam manages to unmask the prowler, revealed to be Sheriff Fraser. Pam wrestles with the shotgun from his hands, then eventually puts it under his chin and pulls the trigger, killing Fraser. The next day, Mark returns Pam to her dorm and she goes up alone. Discovering Sherry and Carl's bodies in the shower, she screams as Carl seems to come to life. She realizes Carl is dead and that him grabbing at her was a hallucination.  Cast  Themes Critic Stephen Deusner of The Washington Post has interpreted The Prowler as a \\"a sly, strange statement about the stakes of war.\\" Deusner cites the film as transgressive in the genre due to its portrayal of a war veteran as its villain: \\"Not every movie could get away with casting a spurned veteran as its villain, especially not a WWII vet. Even in 1981, that generation was lionized for the austere morality of that conflict, set in sharp relief by the more controversial Vietnam War.\\" Scholar James Kendrick notes The Prowler as thematically linked to such slasher films as The Burning (1981), in which psychological trauma plays an integral role in the acts of murder committed, and where a present event provides the traumatized, maddened villain an \\"opportunity to take revenge on the guilty parties or their symbolic substitutes.\\" Production The Emlen Physick Estate served as a filming location The Prowler was co-written by Glenn Leopold and Neal Barbera, son of Joseph Barbera. Director Joseph Zito read the screenplay and was drawn to its \\"misty quality\\": \\"It had this strange, dreamlike mood in it. It wasn't trying to be real, it was trying to be surreal in a way.\\" Initially, Zito had wanted to shoot The Prowler in Avalon, California, where it is set. However, it was decided by Zito to shoot the film in Cape May, New Jersey instead, which he felt had a \\"ghost town quality.\\" The film was shot over a period of six weeks, which each consisted of six days' work, beginning in October 1980. Contemporaneous newspaper reports cite a budget of between $400,000 and $500,000, though Zito has stated that the film ultimately cost $1 million to produce. During production, the film had the working title Graduation. Because the film's death sequences were so special effects-intensive, the shooting schedule was crafted to prioritize the filming of them specifically, with whole days dedicated to one death scene. The Inn at Cape May served as the building that appears in the dance sequences. The Emlen Physick Estate served as the Chatham house, where the film's last act takes place.  Release  =Box office= Initially, Avco Embassy Pictures, who had previously released the slasher Prom Night (1980), expressed interest in distributing The Prowler. The film was ultimately distributed independently in the United States by Sandhurst Films, opening in the fall of 1981. Overall, it ranked 135th at the U.S. box office for the year of 1981, earning less than $1 million during its theatrical run. =Censorship= The Prowler was released under the alternate title Rosemary's Killer in Australia and Europe in a cut that is missing almost a minute of Tom Savini's gore effects. The German version omits all of the gore scenes (including the revelation of the killer's identity) and replaced the soundtrack with bird sounds for daytime scenes, cricket sounds for the night scenes, and Richard Enhorn's score with synthesizer music by an uncredited musician. This version goes by the title Die Forke des Todes (The Pitchfork of Death). The Encyclopedia of Horror reports that \\"Savini's particularly graphic special effects resulted in most of the murders being trimmed in the British release print.\\" = Critical response = Linda Gross of the Los Angeles Times panned the film for its violent content, adding that \\"Director Joseph Zito prowls around aimlessly without creating an authentic sense of locale. Instead, he delivers a spaced-out nightmare in which the characters act like zombies.\\" Stephen Deusner of The Washington Post described the film as \\"bloody, terrifying, [and] often sadistic... The Prowler is a war movie re-imagined as a slasher flick. And its message is clear: Take your military heroes for granted and they will come back and kill you.\\" Deusner also noted that the film is \\"gorgeously shot,\\" but conceded that it \\"is never entirely satisfying. There are too many missed opportunities to transcend the genre‚Äôs schlock, too many passages where nothing happens, too many scares that fall flat.\\" In a review for Slant Magazine, Chris Cabin compared the film to both John Carpenter's Halloween (1978) and William Lustig's Maniac (1980), writing: \\"These films remain popular due mostly to the films that are made proficiently as far as gore theatrics, tone, and mood are concerned, and in these terms The Prowler is certainly deserving of its modest fan base. What the film lacks in narrative drive, coherence, and performance, it makes up with thoughtful lighting, strong cinematography from Raoul Lomas and an uncredited Jo√£o Fernandes, and, of course, Savini‚Äôs lovingly overblown and impossible splatter effects.\\" Film scholar John Kenneth Muir similarly praised the film, writing that it transcends many of its peers because of its \\"blunt- faced approach to violence\\" and Zito's \\"directorial virtuosity.\\" The Encyclopedia of Horror notes that like My Bloody Valentine the film moves away from the genre's usual Midwestern setting, but that it does little with the new location, nor with its potentially interesting returning G.I. motif. Like Valentine, the film is judged as being certainly polished, atmospheric, and suspenseful, though hardly original.\\" Leonard Maltin gave the film a negative 1 1/2 out of a possible 4 stars, criticizing the film's plot calling it \\"illogical.\\" The Time Out film guide noted the film as \\"cravenly conformist in every department.\\" AllMovie called it a \\"run-of-the-mill entry in the early '80s slasher film cycle\\" that \\"benefits from an unexpected amount of technical gloss, but has little else to offer.\\" In a retrospective, Dave Wilson of Dread Central noted the film's violent special effects and \\"sombre atmosphere\\" as strengths, though conceded that the film's characterization was bland. , on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 67% approval rating with an average of 5.1/10 based on 6 reviews. In the years since its release, the film has developed a cult following. In 2017, Complex magazine named The Prowler the 24th-best slasher film of all time. The following year, Paste included it in their list of \\"The 50 Best Slasher Movies of All Time,\\" while the film's killer was ranked the 11th-greatest slasher villain of all time by LA Weekly. = Home media = Blue Underground released the fully uncut version of The Prowler on DVD in 2002 and on Blu-ray in 2010. The extras include a trailer, a still and poster gallery, behind the scenes gore footage with Tom Savini, and an audio commentary with Joseph Zito and Tom Savini. In January 2019, Waxwork Records released the film's original score on vinyl as a double LP.

It is the sole species in the genus Leucosidea. The English name \\"oldwood\\" is simply a direct translation of the Afrikaans words \\"ouhout\\" or \\"oudehout\\", meaning the same thing. This name may reflect the fact that the wood burns slowly as if old and rotting, but the gnarled twisted trunks reinforce this impression.K.C. Palgrave's (1977), Trees of South Africa The genus name Leucosidea is a form of the Greek word ŒªŒµœÖŒ∫œåœÇ (leukos), meaning \\"shining white\\", although in botany the root is more often used less specifically to indicate something of a generally white or gray appearance. The second or specific name sericea means \\"silky\\" and comes from œÉŒ∑œÅŒπŒ∫œåœÇ (serikos), which means both \\"silky\\" and \\"from the land of silk\\"; it refers to the silky hairs that cover the new buds and young leaves of the tree. Taxonomy Leucosidea sericea is a member of the Rosaceae, also known as the rose family. Although this family is very large and economically important worldwide, it is poorly represented in Africa generally and in southern Africa in particular. Description The ouhout is often a straggly shrub or a dense, small, evergreen tree, which grows up to 7 metres tall to 5 metres wide. It is single or multi-stemmed and branches low down. The bark is rough, reddish brown in colour and flakes off to reveal a smooth light brown under-bark. The leaves are alternately arranged, compound and covered with silky, silver hairs. Each leaf possesses 3 to 4 pairs of leaflets. The veins on the leaves are deeply sunken on the upper surface and protrude on the lower surface. The leaves are a dark green colour above and a lighter green colour below. The margins of the leaflets are deeply serrated. When the leaves are crushed they have a strong herb-like smell. The flowers are greenish-yellow in colour, star-shaped, and grow in spikes at the ends of young shoots in spring (August to September). The fruits are nut-like and about 3 mm in diameter (December to January). The flowers and young shoots of this plant are browsed by cattle and goats in spring. The ouhout produces nectar which is probably utilised by bees and other insects. Distribution and habitat Leucosidea sericea can be found above an elevation of in the highlands of South Africa (in the Eastern Cape, western KwaZulu-Natal, eastern Free State,the North West Province, Gauteng, Mpumalanga, and Limpopo), as well as in Lesotho and, rarely, in Swaziland and Zimbabwe. It forms dense thickets in abused areas and can, therefore, become a problem plant on farm lands. Its presence is an indication of overgrazing or poor veld management. Uses Apparently in mountainous areas where the ouhout occurs near streams it is an indication that they are suitable for being stocked with trout. Zulu people use a paste made from the crushed leaves of L. sericea for treating ophthalmia (an eye ailment). The tree is used by the local people as a charm to protect the inhabitants of homesteads. It has been reported that the leaves of Leucosidea sericea are used medicinally by some indigenous South African people as a vermifuge and astringent. A study showed that \\"the plant has antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Candida albicans.\\" Leucosidea sericea is usually found growing in dense thickets at altitudes above 1,000 metres. It can be found growing in open grassland, along river banks and on wooded, rocky ridges. It is usually found growing in damp conditions, on deep, sandy or clayey and often rocky soil. The wood weighs , and is used mainly for fenceposts and fuel.

The archives are named after the authors Marguerite Radclyffe Hall (1880-1943) and Edward Carpenter (1844-1929). They are housed at the London School of Economics, at Bishopsgate Library - (press cuttings), and in the British Library (Sound Archive) (oral history tapes).

It received agency press cuttings and collected other newspaper clippings sent in by its members. GMAP later became separate from CHE and one its founders, Julian Meldrum, moved all the papers into his London flat. Its first funding was a grant made to the National Council for Civil Liberties (NCCL) from the Manpower Services Commission. ;1982 Julian, with others, set up a limited company called the Hall-Carpenter Memorial Archives Ltd and in 1983 registered as a charity. Trustees included Oliver Merrington (Chair of the archive) and Michael Mason, publisher of Capital Gay. The Albany Trust, donated its archives and press cuttings, and the NCCL provided essential meeting and working space in Southwark, with financial assistance from the Lyndhurst Settlement. It also received personal donations from members of the lesbian and gay community. ;1984 The archives moved to its first rented office accommodation in Mount Pleasant, London. A major funding bid resulted in a grant of ¬£32,000 from the Greater London Council (GLC). Part of this was to set up a Media Project to monitor television and radio broadcasts, and Lorraine Trenchard and Mark Finch were employed to run this. The archives moved to the new London Lesbian & Gay Centre (LLGC) in Cowcross Street, Farringdon (at that time the largest lesbian & gay centre in Europe). Early publications included The Gay News Index (1982); ‚ÄòDeclaring an Interest‚Äô - a projected catalogue of gay images on television in Britain, (1982-83); and A.I.D.S. through the Media (1984). Work started on indexing the ‚ÄúNews Library‚Äù of press cuttings, the records of gay organisations and a ‚ÄúPink Thesaurus‚Äù was created by volunteers. ;1985 The archives employed Margot Farnham (until 1988) to coordinate a volunteer group for an Oral History project. Thirty-five interviews were carried out using new sound recording/transcribing equipment. The tapes and transcriptions are now in the British Library Sound Archive, part of the British Library. The Oral History project culminated in two books \\"Inventing Ourselves\\" and \\"Walking After Midnight\\" (see References). Around this time Kenneth Barrow had established the ‚ÄúNational Lesbian & Gay Survey‚Äù within HCA. This was a Mass-Observation style survey engaging the opinions of \\"ordinary\\" lesbians and gay men on various vital or controversial contemporary issues, anthologies from which were later published by Routledge. ;1986 The archives‚Äô GLC funding terminated and the Lyndhurst Settlement helped with funding. ;1987 A fundraiser was employed who wrote to around thirty charitable trusts ‚Äì but none replied favourably. It looked unlikely that the London Lesbian & Gay Centre would receive funding and its closure was imminent, the Directors made a deliberate choice to try to house the Archives in a university, preferably in London. ;1988 Core collections, were moved to the Archives at the London School of Economics (LSE) with the active support of the Archivist, Angela Raspin. A number of gay activists, such as Peter Tatchell and John Chesterman, donated personal collections. The HCA at LSE have continued to grow with new accessions, and have been extensively sorted and indexed by Sue Donnelly and other professional archivists in her team. ;1989 The Hall-Carpenter Archives Management Committee was in abeyance. ;1991 Oliver Merrington, one of the original Directors, took over as the Honorary Secretary/Treasurer, arranging meetings, dissolving the Limited Company, issuing occasional newsletters and drawing up formal agreements with the repositories. He arranged a regular donation of press cuttings from the monthly Gay Times. The Press Cuttings Collection proved much more difficult to house, as the LSE archive had a policy of not taking newspaper cuttings, the collection remained in the LLGC building in Cowcross Street, although the early cuttings relating to the start of the AIDS epidemic were moved to the Terence Higgins Trust. The cuttings then moved to SIGMA (an organisation conducting sexual research in relation to HIV) in Brixton. A professional archivist, Mark Collins, joined the volunteer team and started a re-sort of the cuttings collection which had not been touched for a decade. With his then partner Micheal Anthony Chan arranged their transfer in 1995 to the Greenwich Lesbian and Gay Centre, in South East London. ;1997 Simon Bradford, the librarian of the Cat Hill campus of Middlesex University was at this time creating a new Collections Room for a number of historical archives, and offered space to HCA. In February the transfer was arranged and a formal ten- year loan agreement signed with Middlesex University. Oliver Merrington was appointed Honorary Research Archivist by the university, and held weekly volunteer sessions there to organise the cuttings. ;1998 On 2 June the collection was opened by a Member of Parliament, Evan Harris (standing in for Stephen Twigg MP). The photograph collection from Gay News is also at Cat Hill, as well as a growing collection of lapel badges, T-shirts, printed carrier bags and banners from marches and demonstrations. ;2001 The collection at Cat Hill was renamed The Lesbian and Gay Newsmedia Archive (LAGNA).Based on text by Oliver Merrington, published at the LSE website ;2011 LAGNA (press cuttings and book collection) moves to the Bishopsgate Library.

O'Connor made his first appearance for the team during the 1988‚Äì89 National League and was a regular member of the starting fifteen until his retirement prior to the 2001 championship. During that time he has won three All-Ireland winners' medals, five Leinster winners' medals, one National League winners' medal and four All-Star awards. In 2000 O'Connor captained the team to the All-Ireland title. At club level O'Connor is a one-time All-Ireland medalist with Glenmore. In addition to this he has also won one Leinster winners' medal and five county championship winners' medals. O'Connor's brother, Eddie, is also an All- Ireland-winning captain with Kilkenny. Playing career =Club= O'Connor played his club hurling with Glenmore and enjoyed much success as the club became a new force in hurling throughout the 1980s and 1990s. In 1987 Glenmore reached the final of the county senior championship with Ballyhale Shamrocks providing the opposition. An exciting game developed over the hour, and a 4‚Äì10 to 3‚Äì9 victory gave O'Connor his first county winners' medal. After surrendering their title in 1988 and losing the championship decider to Ballyhale Shamrocks the following year, O'Connor's side reached the final again in 1990. Glenmore faced Clara on that occasion, however, O'Connor's side had a comfortable 3‚Äì15 to 2‚Äì6 victory. The club subsequently represented Kilkenny in the provincial series of games and even reached the final. Camross provided the opposition, however, O'Connor collected a Leinster club winners' medal following a 0‚Äì15 to 1‚Äì9 victory. An All-Ireland final showdown with Patrickswell of Limerick. The game was an exciting one, however, Patrickswell only held the lead on one occasion when Leonard Enright opened the scoring. A 1‚Äì13 to 0‚Äì12 score line gave Glenmore the title and gave O'Connor an All- Ireland club winners' medal. Glenmore lost their county, provincial and All- Ireland titles the following year, however, in 1992 O'Connor picked up a third county winners' medal following a 1‚Äì14 to 2‚Äì6 defeat of club kingpins Tullaroan. Once again Glenmore failed to retain their title the following year. It was 1995 before O'Connor's side reached the county championship decider once again. Fenians provided the opposition in a high-scoring hour of hurling. Glenmore were never really troubled as a 3‚Äì19 to 1‚Äì14 score line gave O'Connor a fourth county championship title. Many believed that this Glenmore team had reached the end of their life-cycle, however, in 1999 the club bounced back to reach the county final once again. Graigue-Ballycallan were the opponents and a close game developed. A 1‚Äì14 to 2‚Äì8 victory gave O'Connor a fifth and final county championship winners' medal. =Inter-county= O‚ÄôConnor played with the Kilkenny minor and under-21 hurling teams throughout the 1980s, however, he enjoyed little success. He subsequently joined the county's senior team, making his debut against Waterford in a National Hurling League game in late 1988. O'Connor made his championship debut the following summer as Kilkenny reached the Leinster final. Offaly retained the provincial title for the second year in succession with a 3‚Äì15 to 4‚Äì9 victory. O'Connor remained on the fringes of the team for the next few years as Kilkenny prepared for a return to the big time. He missed Kilkenny's Leinster final triumph in 1991, however, he was named in the starting fifteen for the subsequent All-Ireland final meeting with Tipperary, the first such clash in twenty years. The opening thirty-five minutes saw both sides trade score-for- score, however, a controversial 20-metre free, miss-hit by Michael Cleary, landed in the net and gave Tipp a lead which they never surrendered. The final score of 1‚Äì16 to 0‚Äì15 resulted in a loss for Kilkenny. In 1992 Kilkenny bounced back from the All-Ireland defeat and O'Connor collected his first Leinster winners' medal following a comprehensive 3‚Äì16 to 2‚Äì9 defeat of Wexford. The subsequent All-Ireland final saw 'the Cats' take on Cork for the first time in nearly a decade. The game was well balanced for the first-half, however, D. J. Carey scored a goal four minutes before the break. This seemed to give Kilkenny the impetus to go on and win the game. Two more goals by John Power and Michael Phelan in the second-half secured a win for Kilkenny and a first All-Ireland winners' medal for O'Connor. He was later honoured with his first All-Star award In 1993 O'Connor's brother Eddie was captain as Kilkenny remained on top of the hurling world. A defeat of Wexford gave O'Connor his second Leinster winners' medal while he later lined out in his second successive All-Ireland final, this time against Galway. The game was a close affair with the westerners going a point ahead coming into the last quarter; however, Kilkenny won the match by five points, giving O'Connor a second All- Ireland winners' medal. Kilkenny failed in their bid to make in three-in-a-row the following year, however, in 1995 it looked as if Kilkenny's hurling fortunes were turning. At the start of the year O'Connor won his first National Hurling League title as Kilkenny defeated Clare. In spite of this victory 1995 proved to be an unhappy year as Kilkenny were trounced by Offaly in the Leinster final. The next few years proved to be frustrating ones for O'Connor and for Kilkenny. It was 1998 before O'Connor added a third Leinster winners' medal to his collection as Offaly were accounted for in the provincial final. Kilkenny later cruised to an All-Ireland final appearance where Offaly provided the opposition once again. The defeated Leinster finalists had certainly learned from their mistakes with Joe Errity and Brian Whelahan scoring key goals. At the full-time whistle Offaly emerged as the winners by 2‚Äì16 to 1‚Äì13. It was the first time that a defeated team had won the All-Ireland title via the ‚Äòback-door‚Äô system. In 1999 Brian Cody took over as manager, however, O'Connor remained a key member of the team. That year he won his fourth Leinster title as Offaly, the All-Ireland champions, fell heavily by 5‚Äì14 to 1‚Äì16 in the provincial final. The subsequent All-Ireland final saw Kilkenny take on Cork, their age-old rivals, for the first time since 1992. On that occasion O'Connor won his first All-Ireland medal, however, there was to be no success for him in 1999. A poor game on a wet day gave one of the youngest Cork teams ever the All-Ireland title on a score line of 0‚Äì13 to 0‚Äì12. In 2000 O'Connor was appointed captain of the Kilkenny team. He subsequently guided his team to another Leinster crown, his fifth in all. Offaly were accounted for once again, however, on this occasion the score line was a more respectable 2‚Äì21 to 1‚Äì13 in favour of 'the Cats'. An appearance in his sixth All-Ireland soon followed for O'Connor as 'the Cats' lined out against Offaly for the second time that season. After just six minutes D. J. Carey scored the first of five goals as Kilkenny exposed the Offaly full-back line. Carey scored 2‚Äì4 that day and shared his second goal with a young Henry Shefflin. Further goals by Charlie Carter and Eddie Brennan saw Kilkenny win on a score line of 5‚Äì15 to 1‚Äì14 and allowed O'Connor capture his third All- Ireland medal. He also had the honour of lifting the Liam MacCarthy Cup on behalf of the team. He later collected his second All-Star award. In captaining Kilkenny to the All-Ireland title O'Connor became the second member of his family to do so. His brother Eddie was captain when Kilkenny won in 1993. It was the second time that two brothers had guided their county to championship honours as Liam and Ger Fennelly had both earlier guided Kilkenny to All-Ireland titles. In 2001 O'Connor was almost thirty-four years-old, an age when most inter-county players would contemplate retirement. He played no part in Kilkenny's National League campaign, however, he intended returning in time for the championship. When Brian Cody announced his twenty nine-man panel prior to the opening of the summer campaign, O'Connor was not included. This effectively brought his inter-county career to an end. =Inter-provincial= O'Connor also had the honour of being called for duty on the Leinster team in the inter-provincial series of games. He first tasted success with his province in 1993 when he lined out in the inter-provincial final. A 1‚Äì15 to 2‚Äì6 defeat of Ulster gave O'Connor his first Railway Cup winners' medal. After a few years being sidelined O'Connor was back on the team again in 1998, this time as captain. Once again Leinster reached the final where Connacht provided the opposition. The eastern province beat the western province by the narrowest of margins on a score line of 0‚Äì16 to 2‚Äì9. It was O'Connor's second Railway Cup winners' medal while he also had the honour of lifting the cup. O'Connor was included on the team again in 2000, however, Leinster were beaten by Munster in the final on that occasion. Quotes * \\"For the last six years this cup has wandered around and didn't know where twas going. Now it knows it's going home.\\" ‚Äì O'Connor's speech after accepting the Liam MacCarthy Cup in 2000. It was Kilkenny's first All-Ireland title since 1993 and brought an end to the so-called hurling revolution.

By 1830, his household included five white persons and 25 enslaved persons.1830 U.S. Federal Census, St. Andrews Parish, Brunswick, Virginia; no record of him appears in the 1820 census, unless he was the householder and slaveholder in Cumberland, Kentucky that year, or possibly because of digital misindexing. His uncle Thomas Gholson Jr. who died in 1816 had represented Brunswick County in the Virginia General Assembly and later the U.S. House of Representatives, and James Herbert Gholson soon carried on the family tradition. Voters elected him as one of their part-time representatives in the Virginia House of Delegates, where he served from 1824 to 1828 and again from 1830 until 1833, when he was elected to fill a vacancy caused by the death of Congressman John Claiborne. Sixty percent were the enslaved Brunswick County. He spoke about Nat Turner in Virginia General Assembly. Elected as an Anti-Jacksonian to the United States House of Representatives in 1832, Gholson failed to win re- election, and his 1834 defeat by his sometimes co-delegate in the Virginia House of Delegates and unsuccessful opponent two years earlier, George Dromgoole, marked the demise of the Whig party in Brunswick County. Afterwards, the Virginia General Assembly elected Gholson as a judge of the circuit court for the Brunswick circuit, and he served for many years despite a controversy the year before his death alleging partiality toward his brother, who would later serve in the Second Confederate Congress. Death and legacy Gholson died in Brunswick County on July 2, 1848, and was buried at Blandford Cemetery in Petersburg, Virginia.

Function EMMAN Ltd. dissolved on 10 March 2015. EMMAN owns and runs a high bandwidth Regional Network whose primary purpose is to deliver connectivity to the Janet network and the Internet for the higher education institutions, further education institutions, specialist colleges and other institutions across the East Midlands region. The network is managed by EMMAN Ltd under a contract with Janet who operate the Janet network. EMMAN also provides Internet connectivity separate from Janet and wishes to develop communications within the region to encompass a broader range of customers including libraries, schools, local authorities, small business enterprises and lifelong learning organisations. History =1994= The East Midlands Metropolitan Area Network (EMMAN) was established in 1994, initially as a point to point link between The University of Nottingham (UoN) and The Nottingham Trent University (NTU) in order to connect NTU to the Janet network via the SMDS connection at UoN. The link consisted of a dark fibre connection, supplied by the local cable TV franchise, Diamond Cable. The connection consisted of an FDDI ring with two extra dark fibres for development work. =1996= The University of Derby (UoD) was added to EMMAN using an 8 Mbit/s Mercury connection to UoN. During 1996 and early 1997 six Janet secondary connections have been made directly to the MAN at NTU. =1997= The UoN to NTU link was upgraded to 155 Mbit/s ATM together with an ATM connection from NTU to UoN Adult Education Centre. =1998= 1998 saw the extension of the MAN to the NTU Clifton site, an alternative route in the Nottingham area and the ordering of a dark fibre link to Derby (installed in January 2000) with a consequent upgrade to ATM at 155 Mbit/s. In addition, EMMAN was directly connected to a 34 Mbit/s ATM link from SuperJanet III at UoN. =1999= The addition of dark fibres from Nottingham to Loughborough, from Loughborough to Leicester, and the provision of ATM switches at Loughborough University and De Montfort University. =2000= The University of Leicester, University College Northampton and the University of Lincolnshire & Humberside to be connected. An additional 155 Mbit/s link from Nottingham to London, which would provide an upgrade for both EMMAN and the West Midlands MAN, MidMAN was made live in March 2000. The EMMAN logo was designed by Matthew Stimson, who was studying Business & Technology at Nottingham Trent University between the years 1999 and 2001. =2001= On 16 January 2001, the link from EMMAN was switched from SuperJanet III to SuperJanet 4. MidMAN followed on 13 March and the 155 Mbit/s links from Nottingham to London and from Nottingham to Warwick became redundant. Once the SuperJanet 4 connection at Nottingham was operational, both the universities in the City of Nottingham moved from ATM to connecting their LANs to EMMAN with fast ethernet. In both cases, some FE colleges connected through the universities' sites continued to use ATM. In April 2001, University College Northampton was connected to EMMAN via DMU. In the same month, the University of Leicester was also connected with a gigabit ethernet links to the University of Nottingham and the nearby De Montfort University, for resilience. During the latter part of 2001, the number of FE colleges connected to EMMAN rose to over thirty as UKERNA implemented the national extension of Janet to FE sites. The East Midlands Regional Support Centre was set up to assist the colleges with the implementation and running of their connections to SuperJanet. =2002= The University of Lincoln (previously the University of Lincolnshire and Humberside) was connected via Nottingham Trent University, bringing the total of HE institutions to eight. These eight institutions entered into negotiation for making the MAN a legal entity and the current company called EMMAN Ltd was formed in March 2002. Most of the links were upgraded from ATM to Gigabit ethernet. Two additional 8 Mbit/s serial links were also procured which connected the University of Derby to Lincoln and UCN to the University of Leicester, giving Derby and UCN resilient routes to the rest of the MAN and hence to SuperJanet. =2006= During 2006 the backbone was completely overhauled in readiness for the upgrade from SuperJanet 4 to SuperJanet 5. An optical network layer was introduced directly over the fibre links between node sites to provide massive scalability in bandwidth across the backbone. This network utilises Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) with 10 Gbit/s per wavelength. The equipment also has the ability to structure each wavelength into separate multiple 1 Gbit/s channels for the routers that run the production IP network as well as having the capability to provide dedicated point to point links at speeds up to 10 Gbit/s either within EMMAN or for linking to the outside world via the Janet Lightpath service. Two new core nodes were created at the Nottingham Trent University secondary datacentre and the University of Nottingham primary datacentre and the EMMAN topology re-engineered into a dual star format. Each core node has a separate connection into the Janet network and each edge node has dual connections into the core to provide a fully resilient service. =2007= A direct commercial link to the Internet was commissioned to provide Internet access for EMMAN connected customers‚Äô activities that are not eligible for use over the Janet network. Additional public sector organisations connected to Janet via EMMAN. =2008= All of the FE college uplinks into EMMAN were upgraded to 100 Mbit/s. =2009= EMMAN Shared Information Security Services (ESISS) launched in conjunction with HEFCE to provide effective and efficient specialist information security services to UK HE and related sectors. =2012= August - All distribution nodes based at University sites changed to comprise two geographically separate linked nodes, each with a diverse fibre feed. All backbone feeds now via 10Gbit/s Ethernet IP services running over OTU2 / OTU2e / OUT1e lightpaths. =2013= February - All University connections now running at 2 x 10Gbit/s. October - Commercial traffic no longer carried. =2014= April - The regional network and all operational tasks transferred to JANET (UK), the national academic network provider. =2015= March - EMMAN Ltd. is formally dissolved by Companies House on 10 March 2015. EMMAN Network Design 2009 The EMMAN network is built around 8 edge nodes housed at the member sites and two core nodes housed at separate locations at the member sites in Nottingham. Each edge node contains one or more routers to which the institutions in the locality are connected via wide area communications links. The nodes are interlinked by a ring of dedicated fibre optic links. An optical network layer utilising DWDM (Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing) operates over these fibres and provides multiple high speed channels for services at the layer above. The production IP backbone operates in a fully resilient dual star configuration around the core nodes with channels defined to ensure uncontended backhaul from each edge node to both core nodes. The links connecting institutions to EMMAN are mostly rented from commercial carriers and all but a handful operate at 100 Mbit/s The production IP network has dual resilient connections into the Janet high speed academic network at each of the core nodes in Nottingham. A separate commercial IP network is provided over the backbone to provide direct Internet connectivity for those customers not eligible to use the Janet network. The optical network layer can be easily expanded to provide dedicated channels for other services at bandwidths ranging from 1 Gbit/s to 10 Gbit/s for ad hoc point to point connectivity either from one EMMAN node to another or to the outside world via the Janet Lightpath service. ESISS In September 2009 the EMMAN Shared Information Security Service ESISS was launched. ESISS is based on the shared services system and funded by HEFCE. ESISS provide IT/IS security and consultancy under the EMMAN umbrella. In November 2013, ESISS and all services provided by ESISS were migrated to JANET (UK).

Agust√≠n Ibarrola (born 1930) is a Spanish painter and sculptor. He was born in Basauri, Biscay, Basque Autonomous Community, Spain. In 1948, the Delegation of Biscay and the city council of Bilbao granted him a scholarship to study in Madrid, where he lived until 1955. He has had various exhibitions in Spain and in 1955 was transferred to Paris. In 1957, he was a member of the group Equipment 57 with Duarte, Serrano, and others. This was in the time of constructivism. Due to his communist militancy, he was imprisoned for several years in the prison of Burgos. In 1963, when an exhibition of his work in London was mounted, a critic compared his work with Goya's The Disasters of War. In the 1980s he began sculpting; his singular vision of the pictorial work the Forest of Oma, near Guernica, is perhaps his best known work. His work combines the Basque spirit with the social commitment of the humblest workers, people who tend towards expressionism. One of his last and most spectacular works was Cubes of Memory, in the port of Llanes. In recent year he has been tied to the founder of the platform ¬°Basta Ya!, a civic group fighting against terrorism in the Basque Country. Due to his bitter opposition to ETA, a group proscribed as terrorist by the Spanish state, Ibarrola has been threatened by ETA. He has been awarded the Medal of the Order of the Constitutional Merit. He is known for his Land Art. One of his most famous works is the Ibarrola's forest, where he painted many trees with a lot of colours creating a beautiful combination of nature and colours.

His books, which have earned him a 1994 National Endowment of the Arts Fellowship in Fiction and the 1998 Herodotus Award, have been published in many countries and translated into more than 20 languages. Early life Zimler graduated from Herricks High School in suburban New York in 1973. In 1977, he earned a bachelor's degree in Comparative Religion from Duke University and five years later obtained a master's degree in Journalism from Stanford University. Academic career He was a Professor of Journalism at the University of Porto and College of Journalism for 16 years. Awards Richard Zimler received the 2009 Alberto Benveniste literary prize in France for his novel Guardian of the Dawn. The prize is given to novels that have to do with Sephardic Jewish culture or history. It was awarded to him at a ceremony at the Sorbonne in January 2009. Five of Zimler's novels - Hunting Midnight (2005), The Search for Sana (2007), The Seventh Gate (2009), The Warsaw Anagrams (2013) and The Night Watchman (2016) - have been nominated for the International Dublin Literary Award, the highest value literary prize in the English-speaking world. His novel The Warsaw Anagrams was chosen as 2009 Book of the Year by the main Portuguese book magazine Ler and by the country's high school teachers and students (the 2010 Mariquis de Ouro prize). It was also chosen as one of the 20 Best Books of the Decade 2000-2009 by the country's foremost daily newspaper, P√∫blico. In August 2011, the San Francisco Chronicle described the book as follows: \\"Equal parts riveting, heartbreaking, inspiring and intelligent, this mystery set in the most infamous Jewish ghetto of World War II deserves a place among the most important works of Holocaust literature.\\" In 2009, Zimler wrote and acted in The Slow Mirror, a short movie based on one of his stories. Directed by Swedish-Portuguese filmmaker Solveig Nordlund, the short stars Portuguese actors Gracinda Nave and Marta Peneda. In May 2010, it won the Best Drama award from the New York Downtown Short Film Festival. O C√£o que Comia a Chuva, illustrated by one of the most famous and well-respected Portuguese artists Julio Pomar, won the prize for Best Children's Book of 2018 from the Bissaya Barreto Foundation of Portugal. In July 2017, the city of Porto awarded Zimler its highest distinction, the Medal of Honor. At the ceremony, Porto mayor Rui Moreira described the novelist as \\"A citizen of Porto who was born far away, who makes Porto greater and grander... Zimler projects the city of Porto out into the world and brings the rest of the world to us.\\" The Sephardic Cycle Zimler has written five novels that explore the lives of different generations and branches of a Portuguese-Jewish family, the Zarcos. This series, whose works are intended to be read in any order, originated with The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon, which is narrated by a youthful kabbalist named Berekiah Zarco who survives the Lisbon Massacre of 1506. These works explore such themes as Jewish mysticism; slavery; the devastating effect of the Inquisition on Portugal and its colonies; and the psychological conflict created in people who are forced to hide their faith. The novels are: The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon, set in Sixteenth Century Portugal; Hunting Midnight, which takes place in Porto, London, New York and South Carolina in the early Nineteenth Century; Guardian of the Dawn, in which the main action takes place in Goa in the Seventeenth Century; The Seventh Gate, set in Nazi-controlled Berlin in the 1930s; and The Incandescent Threads, set mainly in New York and Montreal from 1970 to the present time but also with two long chapters that take place in Poland during and right after the Second World War. The Incandescent Threads has yet to be published in English, though the Portuguese edition was published in 2018. Two of the novels in the Sephardic Cycle have been nominated for the International Dublin Literary Award: Hunting Midnight and The Seventh Gate. All five books were Number 1 bestsellers in Portugal. Other works Zimler has also edited an anthology of short stories for which all the author's royalties go to Save the Children, the largest children's rights organization in the world. The anthology is entitled The Children's Hours. Participating authors include Margaret Atwood, Nadine Gordimer, Andr√© Brink, Markus Zusak, David Almond, Katherine Vaz, Alberto Manguel, Eva Hoffman, Junot D√≠az, Uri Orlev and Ali Smith. In August 2011, Zimler published his first book of poetry: Love's Voice: 72 Kabbalistic Haiku. The verses in the book express Jewish mystical ideas and imagery in the form of haiku. Zimler has written five children's books that have been published in Portuguese: Maria e Danilo e o M√°gico Perdido, Dan√ßa Quando Chegares ao Fim, Hugo e Eu e as Mangas de Marte, Se Eu Fosse and O C√£o que Comia a Chuva. In December 2018, Portuguese singer- songwriter Pedro Abrunhosa released a new album featuring a duet with American singer-songwriter Lucinda Williams for which Zimler wrote the English version of the lyrics. The song is entitled Hold Me. In 2019, Zimler published The Gospel According to Lazarus. Novelist Peter Stanford called it \\"a brave and engaging novel... a page-turner. I simply had to keep going to the very end in order to know on earth what would happen.\\"  Personal life  Zimler has lived with Portuguese scientist Alexandre Quintanilha since 1978, when they met in San Francisco, California, They were married in August 2010, when same- sex marriage was legalized in Portugal. He has lived in Porto, Portugal since 1990. In 2002, he became a naturalized Portuguese citizen. In April 2019, Zimler wrote an article for The Observer describing how his brother's death from HIV/AIDS at a young age affected his writing and, in particular, the themes of The Gospel According to Lazarus. In June 2019, Zimler wrote an op-ed article in The Observer asserting that, in March 2019, his publicist told him that two cultural organisations in Britain had lost interest in hosting an event with him to promote his new book when they learned he was Jewish. The publicist asked not to be named and that the organisations not be identified. According to Zimler, his publicist said that talks over hosting him were cut off over fears of anti-Israel protests. According to The Bookseller, a trade publication that covers the British publishing industry, both The Observer and The Guardian had checked and confirmed the account. One Jewish writer queried why no other Jewish author had reported a similar experience in the UK.

It was first used as a fort for the Spanish army to advance and control the territory, and it was officially baptised on Christmas Eve of December 1603 with the name of Nacimiento de Nuestro Se√±or (Nativity of Our Lord). Destroyed in the later risings of the Mapuche and repaired in 1665, 1724 and for the last time in 1739, it was transferred with its inhabitants in 1749 to the site of the current town. For a long time it was considered the last frontier of Chile, but after the arrival of foreign investors and developers it became a very prosperous city. The Palacio Gleisner is testament to that early prosperity. Among the rivers that surround the city include the B√≠o B√≠o and the Vergara rivers. Industrial practices of lumber companies such as Mininco, Inforsa and Sante F√© (among others) have caused contaminants to pollute the waters of the Vergara River, which was the life source of local agricultural cultivation. Demographics According to the 2002 census of the National Statistics Institute, Nacimiento spans an area of and has 25,971 inhabitants (13,090 men and 12,881 women). Of these, 20,884 (80.4%) lived in urban areas and 5,087 (19.6%) in rural areas. The population fell by 0.1% (23 persons) between the 1992 and 2002 censuses. The town of Nacimiento comprises about 1.4% of the total population of the region. Administration As a commune, Nacimiento is a third-level administrative division of Chile administered by a municipal council, headed by an alcalde who is directly elected every four years. The 2008-2012 alcalde is Gerardo Montes Cisternas (PS). Within the electoral divisions of Chile, Nacimiento is represented in the Chamber of Deputies by Juan Lobos (UDI) and Jos√© P√©rez (PRSD) as part of the 47th electoral district, (together with Los √Ångeles, Tucapel, Antuco, Quilleco, Santa B√°rbara, Quilaco, Mulch√©n, Negrete, San Rosendo, Laja and Alto B√≠o B√≠o).

There is no evidence to associate his tenure to the year 705 alone or indeed to suggest that it was very brief.. Paul the Deacon described him as 'a man tricky and conceited' () who had obtained the dukedom after the death of Duke Ado. He was said to have desired \\"the glory of a victory over the Slavs\\" (Paul the Deacon, Historia Langobardorum VI, xxiv). He paid some Slavs to invade his country in order that he might fend them off, but some of the Slav army raided the pastureland and carried off livestock as booty. Argait (whose name means 'cowardly, inert or worthless' in Langobardic), the local magistrate, or 'sculdahis', chased them, but could not overtake them. Subsequently, Ferdulf met Argait and asked what had become of the robbers. Argait indicated that they had fled. Ferdulf enraged is reported by Paul to have said 'when could you do anything bravely, you whose name, Argait, comes from the word coward.' Argait responds that neither of them should die 'until others know which of us is the greater coward.' A few days later, the real Slav army which Ferdulf had paid arrived and took up a position on a hill. Ferdulf initially decided to try to challenge them on more level ground, but Argait charged up the hill and, fearful of being labelled a coward, Ferdulf followed. The entire Lombard cavalry was killed and the Friulian nobility decimated. Both Argait and Ferdulf died. The episode is interesting since the conversation between Ferdulf and Argait is said by Paul to have been undertaken in 'vulgaria verba' and may indicate that Langobardic was still a spoken vernacular in the north- east of Italy. Whilst Paul's source for this story is not known, and he provides no further notice regarding Ferdulf, it is likely that it depends upon oral traditions that he may have encountered in Friuli.

It is usually dismantled to make a convenient bundle and the frame often has a folding action to facilitate this. The design of a portable bicycle involves a trade-off between ease of carrying and ease of riding. History The first popular bicycles were the large penny-farthings. The pioneering inventor, W. H. J. Grout of Stoke Newington, invented a portable version in which the large front wheel could be dismantled into four pieces so that they would fit into a carrying bag.. In the 1890s, Captain G√©rard of the 87th Regiment of French Infantry was an advocate of bicycles for military use. To enable his troops to operate in rough terrain, he devised a bicycle which could be folded in two and carried on the soldiers' backs; the weight was \\"between 22 and 26¬º lbs\\" (10‚Äì12 kg). The first time the G√©rard portable bicycle was used, it \\"gave complete satisfaction and justified all expectations\\". The bicycles were manufactured by Charles Morel who commercialised the type.. In 1919, Charles Haskell Clark of New York City filed a patent (granted in 1921) (patent US1381281) for a portable bicycle that was easy to carry onto trains or street cars. Additional advantages of small wheels, described in the patent, were the reduced interference with skirts and the ability to dodge in and out among the crowd.Google Patents Charles Haskell Clark velocipede. The December 1919 issue of Scientific American had an article describing Mr. Clark's \\"city bicycle\\".  Riding performance  The riding performance of portable bicycles is challenged by the need to make the bike as small and as light as possible. Rider body weight and size, and road conditions have a strong impact on design and on performance. Typically, portable bicycles intended for the East Asia market (China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, ...) can be designed for riders lighter than 80 kg and shorter than 174 cm. Northern Europe and America require designs for riders up to 120 kg and 200 cm. City roads are generally smoother in Asian cities, but the bicycle has to be able to ride in crowded city sidewalks. Many European city streets are paved with cobblestone, so portable bicycles marketed in Europe need to cope with such a pavement. The smaller the diameter of a bicycle wheel, the higher the rolling friction and the rougher the ride, which is a challenge for portable bicycles as well as for kick scooters. New technological solutions are being studied to offer the same rolling friction at smaller wheel diameters.  Carrying and folding  The point at which a folding bicycle can be considered a portable bicycle is not precisely defined, and depends on the user. A benchmark for portability are the Brompton Bicycles, medium-size bicycles that fold well and are the world's most numerous built on a single design. A bicycle easier to carry than the Brompton C3 can be considered portable. Many portable bicycles weigh below 6 kg and fold in less than 20 seconds. Above these figures the risk is that the bicycle is too heavy for easy carrying, or takes an inconveniently long time to fold. Folding and unfolding has to be easier than is needed for ordinary full-size folding bicycles, because portable bicycles are used for shorter trips than full-size folding bikes.

The Nagel point is named after Christian Heinrich von Nagel. Construction Given a triangle ABC, let TA, TB, and TC be the extouch points in which the A-excircle meets line BC, the B-excircle meets line CA, and C-excircle meets line AB, respectively. The lines ATA, BTB, CTC concur in the Nagel point N of triangle ABC. Another construction of the point TA is to start at A and trace around triangle ABC half its perimeter, and similarly for TB and TC. Because of this construction, the Nagel point is sometimes also called the bisected perimeter point, and the segments ATA, BTB, CTC are called the triangle's splitters There exists an easy construction of the Nagel point. Starting from each vertice of a triangle, it suffices to carry twice the length of the opposite edge. We obtain three lines which concur at the Nagel point. Easy construction of the Nagel point  Relation to other triangle centers  The Nagel point is the isotomic conjugate of the Gergonne point.

It lies on a site of 25 hectareswww.peakdistrict.gov.uk. Gives area of site as 25 hectares. near the village of Castleton, England. It is the oldest documented mine in Derbyshire and is thought to be one of the oldest lead mines in England. The mine is a Scheduled Ancient Monument and has biological and geological significance within the Castleton Site of Special Scientific Interest.  History  The origins of Odin Mine are unclear; many Peak District guidebooks and sources say that the mine was first worked by the Romans and subsequently by the Saxons and the Danes. Trevor D. Ford states \\"It was probably worked in Roman times, again in the Dark Ages and in Norman times\\".\\"Rocks and Scenery of the Peak District\\" Pages 80 (This quotation). However, there is no historical evidence to back this up. The use of the name ‚ÄúOdin‚Äù is often cited as evidence that the mine was named by the Danes after their chief god. This is backed up by evidence that prior to the 19th century the mine was commonly called Oden in mining records, which is more in common with the traditional Danish spelling.\\"Odin Mine\\" Page 7 (Origin of name \\"Oden\\"). The first mention of the mine in official records was in 1280 when a poacher John of Bellhag was put on trial for hunting at Bactor Wood in Castleton and at the entrance to Odin Mine.Information Board at Site (Gives info on John of Bellhag). In the early days before explosives, the rock was weakened by fire setting: this involved heating the rock overnight by leaving fires lit and then cooling the rock with water the next morning causing the rock to shatter.Information Board at Site (Gives info on Fire Setting also called Firing). Odin Cave The Romans had great need for lead, especially for the plumbing systems in their dwellings. They mined the ore galena extensively during their time in Britain, so it is possible that Odin Mine does have Roman origins. The mine is not mentioned again in documents until 1663. In the early 18th century Richard Bagshawe, later to become High Sheriff of Derbyshire, had a considerable stake in the mine. The Bagshawe family retained their interests at Odin until the 1850s. The mine was worked continuously throughout the 18th century with annual ore extraction varying between 100 and 800 tonnes per annum. In April 1706 a rich vein of lead was struck: 41 men and eight women were working at the site and the mine reached 500 metres into the hillside beneath Mam Tor. Drainage problems in the mine meant that a proposal to build a low-level sough was put forward in 1772 but this was not completed for many years, probably not until the 1840s. It was driven up from Hollowford Brook at Trickett Bridge in Castleton to the workings. The mine produced extensive spoil and this was used by the Manchester and Sheffield Turnpike company in 1802 when constructing a new road between the two places. The spoil contained fluorspar, calcite, and barite which was extracted in later years when their value became known. There was a gap in production between 1848 and 1852 and the Bagshawe family withdrew their interests from the mine in September 1856, handing over ownership to Robert How Ashton of Losehill Hall. Lead production at the mine stopped in 1869, although some working took place in 1908 and 1909 when considerable amounts of fluorspar and barite were excavated from the Mam Engine Shaft.\\"Odin Mine\\" Pages 7 to 31 (Chapter \\"The History of Odin Mine\\". Gives rest of history here).  Geology  The veins of lead in the Castleton area formed 280 million years ago when a fault in the local Carboniferous limestone allowed mineralising fluids to flow into fissures in the rock, pushed up by great pressure from beneath the Earth's surface. Lead and sulphate combined to form the lead ore galena. In its heyday, the mine was a complex system of levels and shafts that extended for approximately 1500 metres into the Edale shales beneath the nearby Mam Tor. In the early days the mining was open cast, forming a gorge in the hillside with the water diverted by a leat to the north to keep the workings dry. Later the miners followed the vein of lead underground. The vein is exposed on the surface in a small limestone outcrop at the entrance to the mine and then continues underground just south of due west in the limestone under the Edale shales of Mam Tor. The 1769 plans of the mine show that there were several branch veins leading from the main lead workings. There are several small pipe caverns contained within the mine; the most prominent of these is Odin Cave (called Gank Hole by the miners) which was formed by groundwater opening out a void between limestone boulders. There is no evidence that Blue John was ever mined at Odin although the adjacent Treak Cliff Cavern regularly mines the rock in areas not open to visitors.\\"Odin Mine\\" Pages 34 to 36 (Chapter \\"The Geology of Odin Mine\\". Gives rest of info here).  The site today  The crushing wheel The site of Odin Mine is owned by the National Trust. It consists of a limestone gorge, the original early workings before they went underground to follow the veins of ore. It looks like a natural limestone ravine with the workings now disguised by natural vegetation. To the left of the gorge is the two-metre-wide Odin Cave, which goes about 10 metres underground. The remaining spoil heaps are a protected archaeological site and support a wide variety of plants including Birdsfoot Trefoil, Eyebright, Wild thyme and the Common spotted orchid. Some plants called metallophytes can tolerate the high levels of metal in the soil: these include Spring Sandwort and Alpine Scurvy-grass.Information Board at Site (Gives info on flora and biology). A gritstone crushing wheel, 1.75 metres in diameter with its iron tyre and circular iron track, used to crush the ore, can still be seen at the site. The crusher was built in 1823 at a cost of ¬£40.\\"Odin Mine\\" Page 2 (Gives info on Crusher).  See also  * Derbyshire lead mining history  References  * Odin Mine, Trevor D. Ford and J.H.

Biography  Yamahata was born in Singapore; his father, Sh≈çgyoku Yamahata (, later to become known as a photographer) had a job there related to photography.Hirakata and the Biographic Dictionary state that Yamahata's original given name was , but do not specify its reading. A likely reading is \\"Keiichi\\". He went to Tokyo in 1925 and eventually started at Hosei University (Tokyo) but dropped out in 1936 to work in G. T. Sun (, Jƒ´chƒ´san Sh≈çkai, aka Graphic Times Sun), a photographic company run by his father. (He would become its president in 1947.) From 1940, Yamahata worked as a military photographer in China and elsewhere in Asia outside Japan; he returned to Japan in 1942.  Photography of immediate after-effects the Nagasaki atomic bombing  On August 10, 1945, a day after the Nagasaki bombing, Yamahata began to photograph the devastation, still working as a military photographer. Over a period of about twelve hours he took around a hundred exposures; by late afternoon, he had taken his final photographs near a first aid station north of the city. In a single day, he had completed the only extensive photographic record of the immediate aftermath of the atomic bombing of either Hiroshima or Nagasaki.  Publication  Yamahata's photographs appeared swiftly in Japan, for example in the August 21 issue of Mainichi Shinbun. After the GHQ's restrictions on coverage of the effects of the atomic bomb were lifted earlier in 1952, his photographs of Nagasaki appeared in the September 29 issue of Life. The same year, they appeared in the book Kiroku-shashin: Genbaku no Nagasaki. One which was used in Life, also appeared in the 1955 exhibition and book \\"The Family of Man\\" an exhibition created for The Museum of Modern Art by Edward Steichen, which was seen by 9 million visitors worldwide. One of the less graphic, but more affecting images, it depicted a bewildered little boy, clutching a rice ball, with shrapnel cuts to the face. The head-and-torso enlargement was cropped tightly from a negative that had also showed his mother, also with facial wounds, standing behind, against a background of railway tracks.  Illness and death  Yamahata became violently ill in 1965, on his forty- eighth birthday and the twentieth anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima. He was diagnosed with terminal cancer of the duodenum. He is buried at Tama Cemetery, Tokyo.  Preservation and ongoing circulation of Yamahata's Nagasaki images  Restoration work was done on Yamahata's negatives after his death. An exhibition of prints, \\"Nagasaki Journey\\", traveled to San Francisco, New York, and Nagasaki in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the bombing.

He played 10 seasons, principally at the offensive left tackle position, for the Miami Dolphins of the National Football League (NFL) from 1979 to 1988. He played college football at the University of Michigan from 1975 to 1978. Early years Giesler was born in Toledo, Ohio, in 1956. He grew up in Woodville, Ohio, a town of approximately 2,000 people, located 30 minutes southeast of Toledo, Ohio. He attended Woodmore High School in Elmore, Ohio. He played for the football and track teams and won the Ohio state championship in the shot put. University of Michigan In 1975, Giesler enrolled at the University of Michigan where he played college football for head coach Bo Schembechler's Michigan Wolverines football teams from 1975 to 1978. Giesler began his career as a defensive tackle but was converted to an offensive tackle as a junior. During his junior year, Giesler was a backup to Mike Kenn at the offensive left tackle position and started two games for the 1977 Michigan Wolverines football team. As a senior, Giesler started all 12 games at left tackle for the 1978 Michigan Wolverines football team that compiled a 10-1 regular season record, won the Big Ten Conference championship, and lost to USC in the 1979 Rose Bowl. Led by Giesler and John Arbeznik, Michigan's 1978 offensive line led the way for Harlan Huckleby, Russell Davis, Rick Leach and others to tally 3,241 rushing yards (294.6 yards per game).(to retrieve information for a particular season, go to \\"Games & Totals by Season\\" and select the year for which statistics are to be retrieved) At the end of the 1978 season, Giesler was selected as a first-team offensive tackle on the 1978 All-Big Ten Conference football team. Professional football Giesler was selected by the Miami Dolphins in the first round as the 24th overall pick in the 1979 NFL Draft. As a rookie during the 1979 NFL season, Giesler did not start any games for the Dolphins, played on special teams and was also a backup to veteran linemen Bob Kuechenberg and Mike Current. When Current retired after the 1978 season, Giesler became a starter for the Dolphins at the left tackle position during the 1980 NFL season. Between 1980 and 1988, Giesler appeared in 110 games for the Dolphins, 105 of them as the starting left tackle. In June 1984, Giesler rejected an offer to play for the Michigan Panthers in the United States Football League (USFL) for a reported $900,000 over three years. During the 1984 season, Giesler played on the best pass-blocking line in the NFL, and Dolphins' coach Don Shula rated Giesler as \\"his steadiest offensive lineman.\\" In 1986, Giesler missed the first six games of the season after undergoing knee surgery and then injured the knee again late in the season, limiting his playing time to a career-low seven games during the 1986 NFL season. Giesler considered retiring prior to the 1988 season and conducted a two-month holdout before signing a two-year contract with the Dolphins for a reported $657,500. In 10 seasons with the Dolphins from 1979 to 1988, Giesler played in two Super Bowls (Super Bowl XVII and Super Bowl XIX) and was twice selected by the United Press International (UPI) as a second team All-AFC player. He appeared in a total of 126 regular season NFL games. Later years Following his retirement from the NFL at the conclusion of the 1988 season, Giesler remained in Florida where he owns a chain of restaurants.

It is situated on the northern boundaries of Stuttgart in the city district of Stuttgart-Stammheim, right between fields and apartment blocks on the fringes of Stammheim. The prison was built as a supermax prison between 1959 and 1963 and taken into operation in 1964.  History  = Red Army Faction (1975) = Stammheim Prison became famous when it housed the leading members of the Red Army Faction urban guerrilla (RAF) group during their trials, as well as the courthouse in which they were tried. The section in which they were kept was specially built in 1975 and at the time recognised as one of the most secure prison blocks in the world: the roof and the courtyard was covered with steel mesh. During the night the precinct was illuminated by fifty-four spotlights and twenty-three neon bulbs. Special forces were guarding the roof, including snipers. Four hundred police officers along with the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution patrolled the building. The mounted police officers oscillated on a double shift. One hundred more GSG-9 units reinforced the police during the trial. BKA agents guarded the front of the court area. Finally there were helicopters flying around the area. = Faction member deaths (1976‚Äì77) = Members of the Red Army Faction smuggled a pistol into the prison by concealing it in a book Ulrike Meinhof was found hanged on 9 May 1976. Andreas Baader, Gudrun Ensslin and Jan-Carl Raspe reportedly committed suicide in the high security block during the night of 18 October 1977, which became known as the \\"Death Night\\" for the leaders of the Red Army Faction. Andreas Baader and Jan-Carl Raspe were said to have shot themselves, whereas Gudrun Ensslin apparently chose a method of supposed suicide similar to that of Ulrike Meinhof. A fourth member, Irmgard M√∂ller, allegedly stabbed herself four times in the chest with a stolen knife. She survived her suicide attempt and has since stated that the deaths were not suicide, but rather extrajudicial killings undertaken by the German government of the time, a claim strongly denied by the German governments former and present. The deaths of the prisoners were among the events collectively known as the German Autumn, which also included a series of terrorist attacks and the West German government's response. = Demolition plans (2007) = Officials in Baden- W√ºrttemberg announced in August 2007 they are planning to tear down the section of Stammheim prison where the leaders of the RAF terrorist group were held during the 1970s. They are considering demolishing the high-rise building because it is in urgent need of renovation and new prison quarters would be built on the site of the demolished building.http://www.dw- world.de/dw/article/0,2144,2718056,00.html Deutsche Welle news report References External links * (in German) * Sinnbild f√ºr das Ende der Terroristen, article about Stammhein Prison in the Stuttgarter Zeitung Category:Prisons in Germany Category:Red Army Faction Category:Buildings and structures in Stuttgart Category:1964 establishments in West Germany ","title":"Stammheim Prison"},{"id":"9489985","text":"College Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Education Expense Board, 527 U.S. 666 (1999), was a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States relating to the doctrine of sovereign immunity..  Opinion of the Court  A companion case to the similarly named (but not to be confused) Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Education Expense Board v. College Savings Bank,. the court held - in a decision authored by Justice Antonin Scalia - that sovereign immunity precluded a private action brought under the Lanham Act. For such an action to be sustained, the Court explained, the state must either consent to the suit, or have had its sovereign immunity waived by Congress: *The abrogation exception did not apply, because the U.S. Congress can only waive sovereign immunity pursuant to the power granted by ¬ß 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment (see Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer; Seminole Tribe v. Florida), and both the Lanham Act and the Trademark Remedy Clarification Act were enacted pursuant to Congress' Article I powers. Moreover, ¬ß 5's \\"term 'enforce' is to be taken seriously-- that the object of valid ¬ß 5 legislation must be the carefully delimited remediation or prevention of constitutional violations,\\" College Savings Bank at __, and because the asserted property right in question was not in fact a property right (\\"The hallmark of a protected property interest is the right to exclude others ... [but] [t]he Lanham Act's false-advertising provisions ... bear no relationship to any right to exclude; and Florida Prepaid's alleged misrepresentations concerning its own products intruded upon no interest over which petitioner had exclusive dominion\\") (id. at __), and so the court declined to \\"pursue the follow-on question that City of Boerne v. Flores would otherwise require us to resolve: whether the prophylactic measure taken under purported authority of ¬ß 5 (viz., prohibition of States' sovereign-immunity claims, which are not in themselves a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment) was genuinely necessary to prevent violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.\\" Id. at __. *There was no suggestion that Florida expressly consented to suit, and what was instead asserted was the concept of constructive waiver - the premise that merely by engaging in an activity regulated by Congress, the state waives its immunity. This concept sprang from a single case in the Court's jurisprudence, Parden v. Terminal R.R. Co. of Ala. Docks Dep't, 377 U.S. 184 (1964). But the court characterized Parden as \\"elliptical,\\" \\"an anomaly in the jurisprudence of sovereign immunity, and indeed in the jurisprudence of constitutional law,\\" and noted that within ten years of Parden, the court was in headlong retreat from it, saying that there was \\"'no place' for the doctrine of constructive waiver in our sovereign-immunity jurisprudence, and we emphasized that we would \\"find waiver only where stated by the most express language or by such overwhelming implications from the text as [will] leave no room for any other reasonable construction.\\" College Savings Bank at __. Parden, the Court observed, \\"broke sharply with prior cases, and is fundamentally incompatible with later ones. We have never applied the holding of Parden to another statute, and in fact have narrowed the case in every subsequent opinion in which it has been under consideration.\\" The Court expressly overruled \\"Whatever may remain\\" of the decision after its narrowing by intervening cases.

Biography Avigad studied architecture in what is now the town of Brno, Czech Republic. Avigad emigrated to Mandatory Palestine in 1926. He married Shulamit (n√©e Levin) Avigad in 1928. He worked in the excavations of the Beth Alpha synagogue and the Hamat Gader synagogue. Avigad earned his PhD in 1952, with a dissertation on the tombs of the Kidron Valley, Jerusalem. He taught at Hebrew University from 1949 and until his retirement in 1974. He directed the dig at Beit She'arim beginning in 1953. Avigad also worked on the excavations of Masada, the mountaintop complex built by Herod the Great. He was involved in the exploration of caves in the Judean desert, and published one of the Dead Sea scrolls.Nahman Avigad and Yigael Yadin. A Genesis Apocryphon: A Scroll from the Wilderness of Judaea. Jerusalem: Magnes Press and Heikhal ha-Sefer, 1956. In 1969, Avigad was invited to undertake the excavation of the Jewish Quarter in the Old City of Jerusalem, devastated by the 1948 war and its aftermath. Among the finds were what was believed to be the earliest depiction of the menorah that once burned in the Second Temple, cut into a wall plastered 2,200 years ago, and the Burnt House, the remnant of a building destroyed when Titus, the future Roman Emperor, repressed the Jewish Revolt against Roman rule. This was the first physical or archaeological evidence for the destruction described in the work of Flavius Josephus. The dig also unearthed lavish villas belonging to the Herodian upper classes, remains of the Byzantine Nea (new) Church and Jerusalem's Cardo, a fifth-century -wide road connecting the Church of the Holy Sepulcher and Nea Church. Among the most exciting finds was the remnants of the Broad Wall twice mentioned in the Book of Nehemiah. Built to defend Jerusalem during the reign of King Hezekiah in the late 8th century BCE, there remains an stretch of wall, thick, rising from bedrock west of the Temple Mount. Nearby, Avigad also unearthed the Israelite Tower, a remnant of Jerusalem's Iron Age fortifications attesting to the Babylonian sack of Jerusalem in 586 BCE. Avigad published on many topics, notably on Hebrew seals. One of the seals found by him in 1964 has been tentatively identified as belonging to Queen Jezebel, mentioned in the Bible:Science Daily website. \\"Ancient Seal Belonged To Queen Jezebel\\", Science Daily, October 29, 2007. Accessed November 1, 2007. however, this identification is contested by others.Christopher A. Rollston . \\"Precarious Scholarship: Problems with Proposing that the Seal of Yzbl was Queen Jezebel's\\", American Schools of Oriental Research website, October 12, 2007. Accessed November 1, 2007. According to Bible scholar Frank Moore Cross, Avigad ‚Äúwas Israel‚Äôs most distinguished epigraphist in his generation, and one of the great figures in the history of Hebrew and Jewish epigraphy.‚Äù Awards * In 1954, Avigad was awarded the Bialik Prize for Jewish thought. * In 1977, he was awarded the Israel Prize, for Land of Israel studies. * In 1984, he received the Yakir Yerushalayim (Worthy Citizen of Jerusalem) award from the city of Jerusalem.

It was the oldest gun retailer in New York City and said to be the oldest gun shop in the United States. The store closed as a result of the financial hardships from the Covid 19 pandemic. The store, which was known for its sign depicting a revolver, was founded in 1911 by John Jovino who sold it to the Imperato family in the 1920s. It remains in the family. The store was once located at 5 Centre Market Place, part of a gun district behind the former police headquarters on Centre Street, but later moved to its present location. The store \\"does about $1 million worth of business annually\\", a figure which was higher before the New York Police Department opened an internal firearms bureau. The company used to own a gun factory in Brooklyn, the only one in the city, which made Colt M1911 pistols and reproductions of American Civil War-era Henry rifles. The company, known as Henry Repeating Arms, moved its headquarters from New York City to Bayonne, New Jersey, in 2013. Although many of its customers are in law enforcement, the company was near the top of a list of sellers whose guns were linked to New York City crimes in a 2003 report by a Columbia University researcher using data from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Some 102 guns of 11,700 used in crimes and later identified came from the Jovino shop. According to current owners, until the 1980s the Jovino Company was \\"one of the biggest dealers in the country\\" and sold guns to many police departments. The study did not suggest any wrongdoing by the dealers listed (the store is not legally responsible for how people use the products they legally sell) and did not take into account that a store that has a higher volume of sales would most likely have a higher number of sales to people who later used the firearms in crimes, even if the store had a lower ratio of firearms used in crimes bought from the store per total sales than a store with a smaller volume of sales. A 2007 Village Voice article raised questions about the store's sales to United Nations diplomats from the Democratic Republic of Congo. The shop was seen in the film Serpico, in the thirteenth episode (Season One) of Law and Order (A Death in the Family) and very briefly in Mean Streets as well as The Brave One. The shop‚Äôs Centre Market Street location was seen in the 1957 television series Decoy, appearing in the first season, episode four, titled To Trap a Thief.

The show, presented by Tracey Cox and Michael Alvear, aids couples by suggesting different ways to spice up their relationships and sex lives. The show aired at 11pm on Channel 4, and each series usually consisted of 3 to 4 episodes, with the series finale being a special episode devoted to revisiting the couples featured on the series. Two subsequent series aired in 2005 and 2007. On the first visit, heat-sensitive cameras and CCTVs are installed throughout the house, allowing Tracey and Michael to monitor the couples' lives. After a few days of monitoring, the presenters then go back to the couples to tell them what they are doing wrong and what needs to be improved. British production company, Talkback produced the show Format Despite the show's 11 pm slot, the show's content had to adhere to Ofcom guidelines. Therefore, the show did not show any penetration and the show depicted graphic acts such as fellatio using heat-sensitive cameras. Reception and criticism Channel 4 released figures claiming that the show drew 1.9million viewers, double the usual amount of viewers for that particular tie slot. Leading sex therapists from the U.K. criticised the show, saying that it could cause viewers psychological damage. Much of their criticism centred around Tracey Cox the broadcaster and writer who acted as an advisor on The Sex Inspectors with Dr Petra Boynton from the University College London, claiming that Cox was dabbling in complex areas which \\"should be left to the experts\\". While British psychologist Phillip Hodson expressed concern that the show didn't accurately represent what counts as normal sex. The show's presenters adopted an authoritative tone and used terminology akin to that of professional sexual therapists to validate their supposed expertise. The presenter's matter of fact style led some academics to label the show as dangerously misleading.

The plot centers around the life of Angela Anderson (Stone), a sexually repressed woman who becomes trapped in a mysterious apartment. Plot Angela Anderson (Stone) buys a pair of large scissors from a hardware shop. On her way home, she is attacked in the elevator of her apartment block by a red-bearded man, whom she stabs with the scissors in self-defense. Immediately after the attack Angela is found by twin brothers (both played by Railsback) who live next door to her. The first brother Alex is the star of a successful soap opera, whereas the other, Cole, is a wheelchair-bound artist. An attraction develops between Angela and Alex, which is constantly restrained by Angela's sexual repression. Hypnotherapy sessions with her psychiatrist Dr. Steven Carter (Cox) reveal a red-bearded man named Billy in Angela's past, a startling coincidence to her recent attack. Following her attack in the elevator, the increasing attention from Alex, and the fear of Cole she develops, Angela's sheltered world starts to fall apart. After another encounter with her red-bearded attacker, and harassment from Cole, Angela finds herself lured with the prospect of a job to a large and mysterious apartment where she finds herself trapped. In the master bedroom, Angela finds the body of her red-bearded attacker, who has been murdered with the same pair of scissors she bought earlier. The only other living thing in the apartment with her is a caged raven, who caws repeatedly that Angela killed him. As Angela explores the apartment, she finds it is full of exhibits relating to her own psychology, it is clear at this point that someone wants to drive Angela into insanity. Meanwhile, Alex has discovered that Angie is missing and while trying to discover her whereabouts, his brother Cole suddenly stands up from his wheelchair, attacks Alex, and then mysteriously leaves. After many failed escape attempts Angela takes the raven from its cage, ties a message to its leg and, using the blood-stained scissors to remove a vent cover, releases the raven into an air vent. Angela wakes up the following morning to find that the body of her attacker has been moved to the dining room, and the mutilated corpse of the raven sits on a plate before it. The sight of this causes Angela to collapse in shock where she experiences a childhood flashback. In the flashback, her red-bearded stepfather Billy is murdered by her mother with a pair of scissors before her eyes - the horror being the root of her repression. The next day the apartment is visited by Dr. Carter's wife, who is having an affair with the owner. She arrives to find her husband waiting for her, disguised in a red beard, revealing that he was Angela's attacker. He reveals to his wife that when he learned of the affair, he murdered her lover with a pair of scissors and had set Angela up to take the fall by luring her to the apartment, and exploiting what he had discovered about her past during hypnotherapy sessions. Carter convinces his horrified but politically ambitious wife to go along with the frame, and they set out to find the scissors used in the murder, since they may be used as evidence against him. While wandering in a trance-like state, Angela ventures through the main door (carelessly left open by Carter), closing it behind her and trapping Carter and his wife inside. Dr. Carter attempts to lure Angela back by posing as Billy, to no avail. Outside Angela is rescued by Alex, who had tracked her to the apartment's address. A trapped Carter bangs the scissors furiously against the glass of the window, as a liberated Angela looks back with a vengeful smile.

In 1999, The Stone was profiled by Forbes magazine.Forbes: Magazine \\"Stoners\\", a film about The Stone, was released by Rod Bruinooge and Scott Jaworski in September 2004. It covered the activities of the internet/online gaming community that emerged around The Stone.Internet Movie Database Gameplay Puzzles of The Stone are located in a place called The Immediate. There are a total of 216 Stone puzzles, grouped into 6 categories, each category having 6 different levels of difficulty. Once all the puzzles are solved, The Stone is said to unlock an ancient mystery called the Enigma.The Stone: The Enigma The secret of The Stone is kept by the Stonekeepers. A player of The Stone is often referred to as a stoner. When trying to solve a certain Stone puzzle, a stoner may go to a place called The Commons and ask for a nudge (i.e., a hint) from other stoners who have already solved that particular puzzle. Once a stoner has solved all available Stone puzzles, he or she is allowed into the Sisyphus Lodge. Championship tournament The Stone Championship Tournament, also known as the Final Six Tournament, began September 30, 2005. The first Stone player to solve all of the six final puzzles would be crowned Champion of The Stone and would immediately be granted the status of Stonekeeper. The tournament was won August 11, 2007 by the Stone players \\"Gary_\\" and \\"cinnabar.\\" The solution to the Enigma was discovered August 22, 2007 by Stone player \\"grissy\\". Subsequent to the completion of the Final Six Tournament, the tournament puzzles were opened to all the remaining Stone players as the Final Six Redux, featuring slightly different answers for some of the puzzles. The Redux was won by the Stone players \\"BlindSide\\" and \\"morgana\\". Following the Redux, a set of eight final puzzles (including the last ever Stone puzzle \\"Essence\\") was released as a mini-tournament known as \\"Outside the Immediate\\".

Skating Meredith was a figure skater who became a professional star performer with the Ice Follies. She broke her back in an accident, but returned to skating until she broke her knee cap and was advised by doctors to stop. Acting career Meredith was performing in stock until she was spotted at the Pasadena Playhouse by George Burns, who cast her in several small roles on The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show beginning in 1955. Through mid-1957, she appeared in small roles on a number of TV shows (including Burns and Allen) billed under her real name of Judi Boutin. Eventually, she assumed the name Judi Meredith, and was cast by Burns in the supporting role of Bonnie Sue McAfee on the Burns and Allen show, becoming a recurring performer on the show in 1957-58. In 1958-59, she appeared in a recurring role as herself (in the role of the girlfriend of Ronnie Burns) on the follow-up series The George Burns Show. 1958 also saw Meredith's film debut, Wild Heritage.

The ninth episode of the series to be produced, it was written by Peter Curran and David Williams and first broadcast on 5 January 1968 on ATV Midlands. In this episode, a Mysteron threat to kill one of the Spectrum Angel pilots leads to the squadron doing battle with a trio of reconstructed Angel fighters. \\"Seek and Destroy\\" has been praised for its aerial shots and other special effects sequences. It is one of four Captain Scarlet episodes that were later re- edited and combined to create Captain Scarlet vs. the Mysterons (1980), a Captain Scarlet made-for-TV compilation film produced by the New York office of distributor ITC Entertainment. Plot Captain Black (voiced by Donald Gray) intercepts a transporter truck delivering a shipment from the Fairfield Engine Company to a warehouse. After shooting the driver, Jackson, he starts a fire that quickly consumes the warehouse and everything inside. Later, while surveying the wreckage with a fire chief, Mr Fairfield reveals that his company's shipments were newly fitted-out Spectrum Angel fighters awaiting delivery to Cloudbase. At that moment, the ruins of the warehouse are overflown by three aircraft matching those destroyed in the fire. Meanwhile, the Mysterons (voiced by Donald Gray) have warned Spectrum that they intend to kill one of the Angel pilots. Destiny Angel has left Cloudbase to take a holiday in Paris, and as she is the only member of the squadron currently away Colonel White (voiced by Donald Gray) believes her to be in the most danger. With communications officer Lieutenant Green (voiced by Cy Grant) unable to reach Destiny at her hotel, White has Captains Scarlet and Blue (voiced by Francis Matthews and Ed Bishop) fly to Paris to bring her back to Cloudbase. Scarlet and Blue find Destiny at a caf√© and all three leave for the airport in a Spectrum Patrol Car, only to be ambushed on a country road by the unpiloted Mysteron reconstructions of the destroyed Angel fighters. Cloudbase is alerted and the real Angels, led by Melody, are dispatched to the danger zone. As the Mysteron fighters target the SPC, forcing Scarlet, Blue and Destiny take cover in a nearby ditch, the Angels arrive to engage the enemy in a dogfight. After shooting down one of the fighters, Harmony takes damage but safely ejects before her aircraft hits the ground. Rhapsody manages to destroy another. The last fighter is eliminated when it deliberately nosedives into the ground with Melody in pursuit. Melody pulls up before crashing. On the ground, the Mysteron attack has reduced the SPC to a smoking wreck, leading Blue to quip that it will be \\"a long walk to Cloudbase\\". Production The script describes Jackson's truck lifting a crate containing one of the new Angel fighters as similar to \\"Thunderbird 2 picking up a Pod\\". The truck was designed by special effects assistant Mike Trim. Filming on \\"Seek and Destroy\\" began on 8 April 1967, two weeks behind schedule, during the pre-production of the film Thunderbird 6. According to special effects director Derek Meddings, during the filming of the aerial sequences the scale models of the reconstructed Angel fighters were deliberately flown without \\"human movement\\" in order to emphasise their Mysteron nature. To reduce the strain on the Century 21 art department, which was busy with its preparations for Thunderbird 6, the production of \\"Seek and Destroy\\" economised on set design and scale model work. Destiny Angel's hotel room is a re-dress of the Director General's hotel room from \\"Winged Assassin\\", while the model representing the hotel's exterior is a modified version of the SHEF Headquarters Building from \\"Point 783\\". The caf√© exterior is adapted from a set that first appeared in the Thunderbirds episode \\"The Perils of Penelope\\", while the model shots of Paris feature miniature buildings originally created for the same episode. The final cut of the episode removed a brief concluding scene in which Destiny finds that a bottle of perfume that she bought in Paris has survived the destruction of the SPC. A piece of incidental music from this episode, titled \\"An Angel in Paris\\", is included on Fanderson's 2015 CD release of the Captain Scarlet soundtrack. Reception According to Paul Cornell, Martin Day and Keith Topping, authors of The Guinness Book of Classic British TV, \\"everyone\\" remembers \\"Seek and Destroy\\". Chris Drake and Graeme Bassett praise the aerial sequences, describing the episode as \\"an excellent showcase for the Angel aircraft, as well as providing the small 'Flying Unit' of Century 21 with an opportunity to express themselves in full.\\" Shane M. Dallmann of Video Watchdog magazine describes the dogfight as \\"impressive\\". Chris Bentley, author of Captain Scarlet: The Vault, criticises aspects of the set design, noting that some of the buildings and street furniture seen in the Paris driving sequences are flats rather than three-dimensional models. The British Board of Film Classification rates the episode U, noting that it contains \\"infrequent, very mild\\" violence.

Previous MP  The seat had become vacant on 10 March 1984. The constituency's Conservative Member of Parliament (MP), Maurice Macmillan, had died suddenly at the age of 63. He had recently acquired the courtesy title of Viscount Macmillan of Ovendon when his father (who would ultimately outlive him by nearly three years) was created the Earl of Stockton on 24 February 1984. Maurice Macmillan was a Cabinet minister in Edward Heath's government in the 1970s, as well as the son of former Conservative Prime Minister Harold Macmillan, who was still alive when his son died. He had been South West Surrey's MP since the constituency was created for the 1983 general election, having previously been MP for Farnham from 1966. Macmillan had first entered Parliament at the 1955 general election representing the constituency of Halifax, but had lost his seat at the 1964 general election.  Candidates  Six candidates were nominated. They are listed below in descending order of votes. 1\\\\. Mrs Virginia Hilda Brunette Maxwell Bottomley (born 1948), was the Conservative candidate. She was a part-time psychiatric social worker, at the time of the by-election. She is married to Peter Bottomley who has also served as a Conservative MP. Mrs Bottomley had contested the Isle of Wight in the 1983 general election. Subsequent to the by-election she retained the seat, until she retired from the House of Commons and was granted a Life Peerage in 2005. She served as a member of John Major's cabinet from 1992 until 1997. 2\\\\. The Liberal Party candidate, representing the SDP-Liberal Alliance, was freelance journalist and broadcaster Gavin Douglas Scott (born 1950). Since the by-election Scott has become known as a screenwriter. 3\\\\. The Labour nominee was Mrs Barbara Maureen Roche (born 1954), a barrister. Mrs Roche has subsequently been elected to Parliament and has served as a junior minister. 4\\\\. Victor Litvin was an Independent candidate, who upset some people with his unique ballot paper label. 5\\\\. Miss Helen Mary Anscomb was an Independent candidate, who frequently contested by-elections in the 1980s. 6\\\\. Peter Reid Smith, was another Independent candidate.

While most commonly infecting the honey bee, Apis mellifera, it has also been documented in other bee species, like Bombus terrestris, thus, indicating it may have a wider host specificity than previously anticipated. The virus was first isolated from a sample of symptomatic honeybees from Japan in the early 1980s and is currently distributed worldwide. It is found also in pollen baskets and commercially reared bumblebees. Its main vector in A. mellifera is the Varroa mite. It is named after what is usually the most obvious deformity it induces in the development of a honeybee pupa, which is shrunken and deformed wings, but other developmental deformities are often present. Genomics The viral genome was published in 2006. The genome is 10140 nucleotides in length excluding the poly(A) tail and contains a single large open reading frame encoding a 328-kilo Dalton (kDA) polyprotein. 5' of the central coding sequence is a 1144-nucleotide nontranslated leader sequence (UTR). 3' coding sequence is a 317-nucleotide nontranslated region which is followed by a poly(A) tail. The genome is 29.5% adenosine, 15.8% cytosine, 22.4% guanine and 32.3% uracil. Analysis of codon use found 39.5% uracil and 26.8% adenosine in the third base position. There are three major structural proteins ‚Äì VP1 (44 kDa), VP2 (32 kDa), and VP3 (28 kDa). These lie in the N-terminal section of the polyprotein. The C-terminal part of the polyprotein contains sequence motifs typical of well-characterized picornavirus nonstructural proteins: an RNA helicase, a chymotrypsin-like 3C protease and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. VP1 is encoded between codons 486 to 880 and VP3 lies between codons 913 and 1063. The boundaries of VP2 are not as well defined but it is encoded 5' of VP1. There may be a small protein (VP4) encoded between codons 464 and 486 but this protein has not been confirmed to be present in the genome. Lying 5' to VP2 is a very variable leader peptide (L protein). Despite occupying 7.3% of the polyprotein it is responsible for 26.2% to 33.3% of the variation found between the Iflaviridae. It may be involved in the inhibition of host cap-dependent mRNA translation and stimulation of viral internal ribosome entry site activity. VPg, a small protein (23 amino acids) common to many RNA viruses, is responsible for stabilizing the 5' end of the genomic RNA for replication and translation. A putative VPg is present between nucleotide positions 2093 and 2118 immediately 5' of the 3C protease. The protein itself has not yet been confirmed to be present in the viron. The helicase domains A, B and C are found between codons 1460 and 1575. The 3C protease domains span codons 2183 to 2327. The usual eight RdRp domains are located between codons 2493 and 2828. The genome structure is 5'UTR-L-VP2-(VP4)-VP1-VP3-RNA helicase-(VPg)-3C protease-RNA dependent RNA polymerase-3'UTR The putative VP4 and VPg proteins are marked here by parentheses. If the VPg is present in the genome a copy will be bound to the 5' end of the RNA genome. Molecular biology The virion is a 30-nm icosahedral particle consisting of the single positive-stranded RNA genome and three major structural proteins. Virology The virus is concentrated in the heads and abdomens of infected adult bees with significantly reduced titers in the thorax. The genome is detectable by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in the head, thorax, abdomen and wings of infected bees. Only the legs are devoid of virus. Symptoms Honey bee with deformed wings Deformed wing virus (DWV) is suspected of causing the wing and abdominal deformities often found on adult honeybees in colonies infested with Varroa mites. These symptoms include damaged appendages, particularly stubby, useless wings, shortened, rounded abdomens, miscoloring and paralysis of the legs and wings. Symptomatic bees have severely reduced life-span (less than 48 hours usually) and are typically expelled from the hive. The symptoms are strongly correlated with elevated DWV titres, with reduced titres in asymptomatic bees from the same colonies. In the absence of mites the virus is thought to persist in the bee populations as a covert infection, transmitted orally between adults (nurse bees) since the virus can be detected in hypopharyngeal secretions (royal jelly) and broodfood and also vertically through the queen's ovaries and through drone sperm. The virus may replicate in the mite but this is not certain. Transmission by Varroa destructor The severe symptoms of DWV infections appear to be associated with Varroa destructor infestation of the bee hive and studies have shown that Varroa destructor harbors greater levels of the virus than are found even in severely infected bees. Thus V. destructor may not only be a concentrating vector of the virus but may also act as a replicating incubator, magnifying and increasing its effects on the bees and on the hive. The Varroa mite has been demonstrated to cause the frequency of deformed wing virus to increase in frequency from 10 percent to 100 percent. It is the single greatest factor in the decimation of bee colonies worldwide. The DWV-B strain of this virus has been shown to be particularly virulent and responsible of over-winter colony mortality. In temperate regions, adult honey bee workers remain in the hive surrounding the queen until the following. During this relatively long period of several months, viral load may increase in each worker to a lethal level. If too many workers die from DWV infection during winter, the colony won't be able to stabilize the temperature of the hive and the whole colony may collapse. The combination of mites and DWV may cause immunosuppression in the bees and increased susceptibility to other opportunistic pathogens and has been considered a significant factor in honey bee colony collapse disorder. The virus may also be transmitted from queen to egg and in regurgitated food sources, but in the absence of V. destructor this does not typically result in large numbers of deformed bees. DWV impairs cognitive functions The artificial infection of this virus is also reported to cause specific deficits in behavioural plasticity of honeybees. Honeybees are more responsive to sucrose stimuli four days after infection. Furthermore, infected bees show impairment in an associative learning paradigm during acquisition and in the test for memory retention 2h and 24 hours after the training. Performance in non-associative learning paradigms, like habituation and sensitization, was not affected by the virus. Kakugo virus and aggressive behavior Another virus, the Kakugo virus, has an RNA sequence that is 98% similar to DWV. It is considered a subtype of the DWV species. It is found only in the mushroom bodies of aggressive, guard honeybees. Bees that are significantly affected by DWV also have measurable titers of the virus in their heads while bees that are symptomless only produce titers in their abdomens or thoraxes.

Shaughnessy, was the first book-length investigation of writing problems experienced by under-prepared college freshmen. At the time of the book‚Äôs publication, Shaughnessy was the director of the Instructional Resource Center and an associate dean of CUNY, having previously worked both as a basic writing (BW) instructor and the director of basic writing at City College in New York. The book grew out of Shaughnessy‚Äôs nine years‚Äô experience teaching basic writing to open admissions students. Overwhelmed by the error-ridden compositions produced by her students, she systematically analyzed 4,000 placement essays written by incoming freshmen at City College in order to better understand the logic of student errors in composition. This research‚Äîfunded in part by the Carnegie Foundation grant‚Äîcoupled with her own experience provides the foundation of the book which seeks both to inform basic writing instructors and provide them with a means for approaching their students‚Äô areas of weakness. Perhaps the central and most important observation Shaughnessy makes is that there is a pattern to student error.Bernstein, Alison. Review. The School Review 86.2 (February 1978): 292-4. Shaughnessy‚Äôs research centered around the theory that basic writing students write with deficiencies not because they are incapable or disadvantaged, but because they are unskilled beginners who like all beginners of any discipline must learn by mistakes and with much practice.Keetz, M. (1979). Errors & Expectations: A Guide for the Teacher of Basic Writing Mina P. Shaughnessy. Journal of Reading, 22(7), 663.  Summary  Errors and Expectations devotes a chapter to eight of the (at the time) most salient considerations in basic writing. Each chapter follows a three- pronged format: first, a range of examples; second, an explanation of causes of the problems; and third, suggestions with which to approach the problems. Although more than forty years have passed since the book‚Äôs original publication date, the majority of the information remains pertinent and insightful today. Chapter 1: Introduction. Shaughnessy discusses the background of the open admissions movement, detailing her own experience when she begins to grade the essays produced by her first group of open admissions students and finds herself unprepared to proceed in spite of previous years of experience in teaching composition. She also provides a rationale for her focus on error, explaining the realities of academia, the ways in which errors are viewed, and the relationship between reader and writer. Chapter 2: Handwriting and punctuation. After briefly discussing handwriting, the bulk of the chapter (27 of 29 pages) focuses on the myriad ways in which basic writers use and misuse punctuation. In order to understand the logic behind the errors, Shaughnessy explores the concept of the sentence and the differences between spoken and written English. Commas, periods, and capitalization are the primary elements examined. Chapter 3: Syntax. Four general categories of error are examined (accidental errors, blurred patterns, consolidation errors, and inversions) in the context of the academic tone which college students are expected to adopt and with which basic writers often struggle as they expand their writing ability. Chapter 4: Common errors. Shaughnessy provides examples in the primary problem areas of verbs, nouns, pronouns, and subject-verb agreement before discussing the discouragement felt by teachers and students alike as they approach the recurring common errors present in student writing. She offers simple suggestions for reducing error and provides a thorough diagnostic test. Chapter 5: Spelling. Shaughnessy first makes a distinction between misspelling and incorrectly inflecting various parts of speech before classifying spelling mistakes under four heads: problems with the spelling system, incongruities between spoken and written English, ignorance of spelling rules, and the inexperienced eye. She suggests nine steps in addressing spelling problems and warns against two general assumptions‚Äîthat adult students can‚Äôt be taught how to spell correctly and that spelling can only be taught one way. Chapter 6: Vocabulary. Basic writing students enter college without having developed the vocabulary of academia, a slow-growing task that generally takes years to accomplish. Shaughnessy compares the writing of basic, intermediate, and advanced freshman writers to discuss their vocabulary skills and the depth of ideas investigated through vocabulary. She also indicates basic writing students‚Äô needs as they approach vocabulary-rich courses (such as biology or anatomy). Chapter 7: Beyond the sentence. Although many teachers complain that basic writing students lack ideas, Shaughnessy claims that their ideas are hidden by their novice skills and attempts at elaboration. She suggests three needs specific to BW students: how to arrive at a main idea, how to see and create structure in writing, and how to recognize specific patterns that link together sentences and paragraphs. Chapter 8: Expectations. Shaughnessy discusses the powerful link between expectations and achievement, showing sample essays from the beginning and end of a semester course and citing statistics that demonstrate the effectiveness of basic writing courses.  Reception and Influence  Over 12,000 hardcover copies were sold within six months after it was published (the typical number for a scholarly book with a focused topic was 1,000), and by 1979, more than 40,000 paperback copies had been sold. The book has been cited as one of the most important and influential studies of basic writing, relevant for teachers of both remedial courses and writing in general.Miller, Susan. Review. Rhetoric Society Quarterly 8.2 (Spring 1978): 63-5. Errors and Expectation is regarded as required reading that should be referenced by teacher of basic writing as well as teachers of any discipline to improve student writing and encourages teachers to develop a pedagogy that respect the adult learner and begin instruction where the student is.Susan Miller. (1978). Errors and Expectations: A Guide for the Teacher of Basic Writing Mina P. Shaughnessy. Rhetoric Society Quarterly, 8(2), 63. Errors and Expectation is regarded as a handbook of strategies to ‚Äúremediate error‚Äù in the student as well as the teacher . This is a significant statement as it shifts the teacher‚Äôs perspective that basic writing students are remedial - bad and need correcting, when in fact it is the students' errors that require study and correction as well as a teachers perspectives - in becoming a student themselves of new disciplines and of his/her students in order to grasp their basic writing challenges and developing skills.Soliday, M. (2003). Mina P. Shaughnessy and the Second Chance. Encounter, 16(4), 15‚Äì18. In more recent years, Shaughnessy‚Äôs work has been criticized for a variety of reasons: devoting so much time to grammar instruction;Wiener, Harvey S. Review. College English 38.7 (March 1977): 715-17. categorizing only the errors of finished products, rather than the errors of each draft; and focusing so completely on error, despite the fact that she herself insists that error correction should not be the only focus of a basic writing course,Fox, Roy F. Review. The English Journal 67.7 (October 1978): 86. among others.  References  Maher, Jane. Mina P. Shaughnessy: Her Life and Work. Urbana: National Council of Teachers of English, 1997.

It was the site of the Battle of Bushy Run fought on August 5‚Äì6, 1763 during the Pontiac's Rebellion. The battle was a major victory for the British and enabled them to secure their control of the Ohio River Valley and what was to become the Northwest Territory. Bushy Run Battlefield Park was established as a Pennsylvania State Park in the 1920s and became a National Historic Landmark in 1960. The Visitor Center is open Wednesday through Saturday from 9:00 am until 5:00 pm, and Sunday from noon to 5:00 pm, during the months of May‚ÄìOctober. The Visitor Center hosts a museum exhibit entitled, \\"The March to Bushy Run\\", a theater, a gift shop and battlefield tours. Bushy Run Battlefield Park is the only historic site or museum that deals exclusively with Pontiac's Rebellion. Battle reenactments are held annually on the first full weekend of August.http://bushyrunbattlefield.com/news-events/ The park is on Pennsylvania Route 993 near Harrison City and Jeannette. Battle history The Battle of Bushy Run was fought between a British relief column under the command of Colonel Henry Bouquet and a combined force of Delaware, Shawnee, Mingo, and Huron warriors. In July 1763, a British relief column consisting of 500 British soldiers was sent to relieve Fort Pitt, then under siege. Under the command of Bouquet, the column left Carlisle, Pennsylvania. On August 5, while passing through present-day Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, the column was ambushed by a large force of Delaware, Shawnee, Mingo, and Huron east of Fort Pitt. The British managed to hold their ground and, after the natives withdrew after sunset, Bouquet ordered a redoubt, made of sacks of flour, constructed on Edge Hill placing their wounded and livestock in the center of the redoubt. The following morning, after the evening sentries were being relieved, the allied tribes attacked only to be ambushed themselves by the relieved sentries. As the tribal forces were flanked, the warriors fled in a disorganized retreat. With troops under Bouquet, the column dispersed the attackers before heading to Bushy Run, where there was badly needed water. The battle has since been attributed to Bushy Run despite the main fighting taking place in Edge Hill. Bouquet then marched to the relief of Fort Pitt. The battle was costly with 50 British soldiers killed. The confederacy of the Delaware, Shawnee, Mingo, and Huron also suffered an unknown number of casualties including two prominent Delaware chieftains. Park history The battlefield was acquired by the state and established as a state park in the 1920s. In August 2009, the state closed several PHMC museums indefinitely due to a lack of funding as part of an ongoing budget crisis. Bushy Run Battlefield was one of the sites set to be closed.Rujumba, Karamagi \\"Fort Pitt Museum, Bushy Run close due to state budget crisis\\". Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (14 August 2009.)

Florida Prepaid was a companion case to the similarly named (but not to be confused) College Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Education Expense Board, 527 U.S. 666 (1999). Where College Savings Bank was an action brought under the Lanham Act, Florida Prepaid was a concurrent action brought under the Patent and Plant Variety Protection Remedy Clarification Act. Although it was unnecessary to reach the question of whether Congress had validly abrogated Florida's sovereign immunity in College Savings Bank, the question was unavoidable in Florida Prepaid. Findings In a 5-4 decision authored by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, the court held that the Act's abrogation of States' sovereign immunity was invalid. Congress could only abrogate sovereign immunity pursuant to its powers under ¬ß 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment and not Article I (see Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer; Seminole Tribe v. Florida). Applying the ¬ß 5 test provided in City of Boerne v. Flores, the validity of the Act could not be sustained. Implications The results of the case are cited repeatedly in subsequent patent cases, and criticized. Justice Stephen Breyer, in Active Liberty (Federalism), mentions the case as example of potentially overreaching or counterproductive restriction of federal authority to \\"create uniform individual remedies under legislation dealing with nationwide problems‚Äîfor example, private civil damages actions for citizens injured by a state's unlawful use of their intellectual property\\".

The Massacre The Mirusuvil massacre happened on 20 December 2000, when eight internally displaced refugees returning to inspect their property were arrested on 19 December 2000 in a village named Mirusuvil close to Jaffna. They were subsequently murdered allegedly by Sri Lankan Army soldiers and buried in a mass grave, about 16 miles east of Jaffna town. The refugees had returned from Udupiddy, further north. They returned to Mirusuvil on 19 December to inspect their houses and to collect firewood, when they were seized by the Army. The refugees had obtained permission from local authorities before visiting their former properties. According to the evidence of District Medical Officer, Dr. C. Kathirvetpillai, their throats had been slashed. The dead included three teenagers and five-year-old Vilvarajah Prasath The murders came to light because one of the arrested, Ponnuthurai Maheswaran allegedly escaped from Army custody with serious injuries and informed relatives. Eventually the Sri Lankan government charged five Sri Lankan Army soldiers with illegal arrests, torture, murder and burial of their dead bodies in a mass grave. The case was still pending in 2007. Reactions In a letter to the then President Chandrika Kumaratunga, the local member of parliament Mavai Senathirajah said that a woman‚Äôs body was seen partially buried in the area, leading to suspicions that there were other mass graves. He urged the president to order further excavations in Mirusuvil. Human rights groups such as Center for Human Rights Development (CHRD) along with other civilian groups initiated a campaign and demanded the government to arrest the murderers and as a result 14 Sri Lanka Army Soldiers were taken into custody. They were produced before the Magistrate in Chavakachcheri, located in Jaffna district and remanded. CHRD lawyer Mr. M. Remadious was instrumental in participating in legal proceedings against the suspects and also met and interviewed the relatives of the victims to collect more information. The case was then transferred to the Magistrate Court in Anuradhapura and was taken up on 20 May 2002. Attorney General then nominated three Judges to hear the case at Trial at Bar, High court, Colombo on 27 November 2002. Group of volunteer lawyers took care of the interests of the victim‚Äôs families and key witnesses. Later the case was referred to the Colombo High Court and it longed for about 13 years. Case follow up A typical Kris knife The government in 2002 agreed to try the arrested army officers without a jury. During the proceedings of the court case the main witness in the court case was quoted as saying that: Although the case was still being heard in 2005, Human rights agencies have complained of delays in hearing of this and other human rights related cases. Death Sentence Initially 14 Soldiers were taken into custody and later nine of them were acquitted from all charges. But after Attorney General had filed charges against 5 soldiers in connection with this case. After about 13 years of the case, the first accused army Staff Sergeant Sunil Ratnayake was found guilty for the murder of eight civilians in Mirusuvil, Jaffna has been sentenced to death by the Colombo High Court on 25 June 2015. He was found guilty of 15 offences. However, four other soldiers were acquitted as there was insufficient evidence to connect them to the murders. Pardon In January 2020 it was alleged by opposition MP Ajith Perera that Sunil Ratnayake who was on death row over the massacre was going to be pardoned and he applauded the move. On 26 March 2020 Ratnanayake was granted a full presidential pardon which was condemned by human rights groups and the Tamil National Alliance.https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/tna-condemns- pardon-of-murder- convict/article31176027.ecehttps://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/03/justice- reversed-for-victims-of-the-mirusuvil-massacre-from-sri-lanka/ How) However Ajith P Perera's official Twitter account replying to a tweet by Sumanthiran clarified that the original comment was meant to be sarcastic and condemned the release.

Since Respect (1993), the hitherto prolific Hitchcock had released just one full studio album (Moss Elixir in 1996), the rest of his recent output consisting largely of repackages and live recordings. Jewels For Sophia however contained a dozen tracks, only one of which (\\"No, I Don't Remember Guildford\\") had been recorded previously, and two extras not listed on the cover, and hidden away after a substantial pause following the album's \\"last\\" track.

It was first published in 1984 as volume 53 of Heidegger's Gesamtausgabe. The translation by William McNeill and Julia Davis was published in 1996 by Indiana University Press. Der Ister is a poem by Friedrich H√∂lderlin, the title of which refers to an ancient name for a part of the Danube River. Overview In 1942, in the darkest depths of World War II and the National Socialist period, Heidegger chose to deliver a lecture course on a single poem by Friedrich H√∂lderlin: \\"Der Ister,\\" about the river Danube. The course explored the meaning of poetry, the nature of technology, the relationship between ancient Greece and modern Germany, the essence of politics, and human dwelling. The central third of the lecture course is a reading of Sophocles' Antigone. Heidegger undertakes this reading of Antigone ostensibly because of the importance of this text for grasping the meaning of H√∂lderlin's poetry, but in doing so he repeats and extends a reading he had conducted in a different context in 1935. In terms of Heidegger's oeuvre, the 1942 lecture course is significant in that it is Heidegger's most sustained discussion of the essence of politics. Heidegger was only able to deliver two- thirds of the written text of the lecture course.The Ister: A film by David Barison and Daniel Ross and Gesamtausgabe 53, editor's epilogue. The lecture course is divided into three parts. *Part one introduces the way in which Heidegger believes it is necessary to approach H√∂lderlin's poetry, arguing against the \\"metaphysical interpretation of art.\\" He further argues that H√∂lderlin's poetry must be understood in terms of its essential kinship with the work of Sophocles. *Part two retraces the interpretation of Sophocles' Antigone which Heidegger conducted in the 1935 lecture course, An Introduction to Metaphysics. He extends this reading, modifying it in subtle ways. *Part three, which was in fact never delivered, returns to H√∂lderlin's poetry, arguing that the figure of the river in the poem is in fact the poet, and vice versa.  Part one: Poetising the essence of the rivers  =The Ister hymn= The lecture course opens with a reflection on the Greek origin of the word \\"hymn,\\" meaning song of praise, specifically in praise of the gods, the heroes, or contest victors, in preparation of the festival. Heidegger cites a line from Sophocles' Antigone connecting the noun and verb forms of the word, and then indicates that the sense in which H√∂lderlin's works are hymns must initially remain an open question.Heidegger (1996), p. 1. Heidegger turns his attention to the first line of \\"Der Ister\\"‚Äî\\"Now come, fire!\\" What could this mean, if \\"fire\\" here indicates the sun or the dawn? What could it mean to call, or to have the vocation for such a calling, given that the dawn will come whether it is called or not? And what is meant by \\"Now,\\" by naming the time of such a calling? From these questions Heidegger is drawn to ask what it means to \\"poetise,\\" answering that poetising is always inaugurating something, that genuine poetising is always poetising \\"anew.\\" Thus the \\"Now\\" of the first line speaks not only of the present, but toward the future.Heidegger (1996), pp. 6‚Äì9. Heidegger next focuses on the fact that it is clear that \\"the rivers come to language\\" in H√∂lderlin's poetry. On the one hand, the rivers are detached from human being, having their own \\"spirit\\"; on the other hand, the rivers are a locale at which human beings find their dwelling place. The question is thus that of the poetic essence of the river.Heidegger (1996), pp. 11‚Äì12. =The metaphysical interpretation of art= Rather than delving immediately into this question, Heidegger makes a detour, elaborating the \\"metaphysical interpretation of art.\\" He argues that metaphysical interpretations are incapable of comprehending H√∂lderlin's poetry. According to the metaphysical interpretation, art presents objects in nature such as rivers, but this presentation is at the service of something else, of their \\"meaning\\" in the artwork. Heidegger speaks in this regard of the etymology of the words \\"allegory\\" and \\"metaphor.\\" The metaphysical interpretation of art relies on the distinction between the sensuous and the non-sensuous, the aesthetic and the noetic, the sensible and the intelligible. And according to this interpretation the artwork exists not for itself, not as a sensuous object, but for the nonsensuous and suprasensuous, which is also named \\"spirit.\\" In this way the superior and the true come to be identified with the spiritual.Heidegger (1996), pp. 16‚Äì18. Against the metaphysical interpretation of art, Heidegger asserts that the rivers in H√∂lderlin's poetry are in no way symbolic images of a higher or deeper content. He draws attention to the final lines of the poem‚Äî\\"Yet what that one does, that river, / No one knows\\"‚Äîin order to indicate that, whatever the rivers are, or whatever the river does, remains an enigma. Even the poet knows only that the river flows, but not what is decided in that flowing.Heidegger (1996), pp. 18‚Äì19. =Locality and journeying= Heidegger then turns to a consideration of the river as the dwelling place of human beings. As such, the river is what brings human beings into their own and maintains them there. Yet what is their own often remains foreign to human beings for a long time, and can be abandoned by them because it threatens to overwhelm them. It is not something that produces itself, but must come to be appropriate, and needs to be appropriated. The river is of assistance in the becoming-homely of human beings, but this \\"assistance\\" is not an occasional support but a steadfast standing by.Heidegger (1996), pp. 20‚Äì21. To understand what this means, Heidegger considers some lines from another H√∂lderlin poem, \\"Voice of the People,\\" in which the rivers are referred to as \\"vanishing\\" and as \\"full of intimation.\\" That the rivers are vanishing means that they abandon the human landscape, without thereby being unfaithful toward that landscape. Yet as full of intimation, the rivers proceed into what is coming. Thus Heidegger sees H√∂lderlin as concerned with the temporality of the river in relation to the human, yet also with its spatiality‚Äîthus \\"the river is the journeying.\\" The river is, he says, the journeying of becoming homely or, rather, the very locality attained in and through the journeying.Heidegger (1996), pp. 27‚Äì31. His claim is that the river is the locality of the dwelling of human beings as historical upon the earth.Heidegger (1996), p. 33. =R√§tsel= The river is an enigma (R√§tsel). But Heidegger relates this to Raten, giving counsel, and to Rat, counsel, but also \\"care.\\" To give counsel means to take into care. That the river is an enigma does not mean it is a puzzle we should wish to \\"solve.\\" Rather, it means it is something we should bring closer to us as an enigma.Heidegger (1996), pp. 34‚Äì35. We must understand this poetry, therefore, in something other than a calculative, technical way.Heidegger (1996), p. 37. =Space and time= Locality and journeying: this sounds like \\"space and time.\\" Succession takes its course in time, as a sequence of moments, as a \\"flowing.\\" But this is in fact only an understanding of space and time as an ordered, calculable, relationality. Whatever is subject to order must be posited in advance in such a way that it becomes accessible for order and control. Hence, for example, the reduction to co-ordinates. Yet for calculative observation, something is what it is only through what it performs. All modern thinking thinks in terms of order and performance. Human activity is thought as labour, equated with mechanical energy, and assessed according to the performative principle. Through such thinking space and time come to be considered so obvious as not to require any further thought.Heidegger (1996), pp. 40‚Äì42. =Modern technology= Such modern thinking about space and time is essentially technological. Modern technology is different from every tool. Whereas the tool is a means, what is distinctive about modern technology is that this is no longer the case, and that it is instead unfolding a domination of its own. It demands its own kind of discipline and conquest. Thus, for example, the staged accomplishment of factories built for the purpose of fabricating machine tools for other factories. Modern machine technology is a specific kind of \\"truth.\\" We may believe that technology, as the control of space and time, is never undertaken without purpose, and is therefore no end in itself. This, however, is a misunderstanding grounded in a failure to grasp the essence of modern technology. And this results from failing to question that which underpins it‚Äîthe order and unity of \\"space and time.\\"Heidegger (1996), pp. 44‚Äì45. Heidegger then deconstructs the concepts of space and time, arguing firstly that these cannot be merely \\"objects,\\" as though they were some gigantic containers in which everything is accommodated. Yet neither can we conclude that they are merely subjective. Is space, over which wars erupt, merely imaginary? And is time, which tears us along and tears us away, merely subjective? Such metaphysical interpretations of space and time will be of no help in understanding the locality and journeying at the heart of H√∂lderlin's non-metaphysical poetising. Space and time comprise the framework for our calculative domination and ordering of the \\"world\\" through technology. But it remains undecided whether this process is turning human beings into mere planetary adventurers, or whether it is the beginning of another tendency, toward new forms of settlement and resettlement.Heidegger (1996), pp. 45‚Äì48. =Dialogue= According to Heidegger, that poetry of H√∂lderlin's taking the form of the \\"hymn\\" has taken into its care this becoming homely in one's own. He asserts that \\"one's own\\" is in this case the German fatherland, but immediately adds that \\"coming to be at home is thus a passage through the foreign.\\" This is why this poetry necessarily takes the form of a dialogue with foreign poets, specifically, Pindar and Sophocles. What must be carefully listened to in the hymnal poetry of H√∂lderlin is this \\"resonance\\" of Greek poetry, on which basis Heidegger turns to the interpretation of Antigone.Heidegger (1996), pp. 48‚Äì50.  Part two: The Greek interpretation of human beings in Sophocles' Antigone  =The choral ode= The choral ode from the Antigone of Sophocles is according to Heidegger the singular work radiating throughout the poetry of H√∂lderlin.Heidegger (1996), p. 51. Heidegger had previously interpreted this ode in his 1935 lecture course, An Introduction to Metaphysics, and in 1942 he both recapitulates and extends this interpretation. Like \\"Der Ister,\\" the ode begins with a call to the dawning sun, yet it is clear the ode is equally concerned with darkness. Although the ode is concerned with the light and darkness of human being, this should not be interpreted to mean that the two main figures, Creon and Antigone, form an opposition. Each of these figures proceed from out of the unity of essence and nonessence, but differently in each case.Heidegger (1996), p. 52. =Deinon= The decisive word, according to Heidegger, occurs at the beginning of the ode: deinon. Heidegger translates this as das Unheimliche, the uncanny. Heidegger emphasises what he calls the \\"counterturning\\" character of the term. Deinon, he says, means the fearful, the powerful, and the inhabitual. But none of these definitional elements is one-dimensional. As the fearful, the deinon is also that which, as worthy of honour, can awaken awe. As the powerful, it may be that which looms over us, or that which is merely violent. As the inhabitual, the extraordinary, the extraordinariness of skill, it exceeds the ordinary, but it can do so as that which governs the ordinary and the habitual. As das Unheimliche, deinon names the unity of all these meanings.Heidegger (1996), pp. 61‚Äì64. The ode names the human being as deinon in manifold ways, indeed as the most uncanny being, das Unheimlichste. Heidegger ties this to his prior argument that human beings as poetised by H√∂lderlin are \\"unhomely\\" (\\"unheimisch\\"), that is, on the way toward becoming homely. The extraordinariness of human being is this being un- homely that is also a becoming homely. Heidegger makes clear that this being unhomely does not mean simply homelessness, wandering around, adventurousness, or lack of rootedness. Rather, it means that the sea and the land are those realms that human beings transform through skillfulness and use. The homely is that which is striven for in the violent activity of passing through the inhabitual. Yet even so, the homely is not attained in this activity: as the ode says, man \\"comes to nothing.\\"Heidegger (1996), pp. 68‚Äì73. =Poros= Human being is thus the being which finds passage through everything, yet always comes up short, expressed in the couple pantoporos aporos, where poros means that irruption of power that finds its way through. Infinitely skillful and artful, human beings nevertheless can never circumvent death. This is something known by human beings, but mostly in the form of evading this knowledge. Human beings are in fact those beings which comport themselves to beings as such, and because they understand being, human beings alone can also forget being. The uncanniness of human beings is that they alone are capable of \\"catastrophe,\\" in the sense of a reversal turning them away from their own essence.Heidegger (1996), pp. 74‚Äì77. =Polis= Heidegger next turns to the couple hypsipolis apolis, \\"towering high above the site,\\" and \\"forfeiting the site.\\" This couple is based in the word polis, and Heidegger notes that, if this is the origin of the word \\"political,\\" then it is a mistake to understand the former on the basis of the latter‚Äîthe polis is precisely not a political concept. The \\"political\\" is conventionally understood in terms of consciousness, in a \\"technical\\" manner, as the way in which history is accomplished. It is thus marked by a failure to question itself.Heidegger (1996), pp. 79‚Äì80, 94. Heidegger asks whether the polis might not be the name of that realm which constantly becomes questionable anew and remains worthy of question. Perhaps the polis is that around which everything question-worthy and uncanny turns in an exceptional way. Heidegger uses the word Wirbel, swirl, in this context, and speaks of the polis as essentially \\"polar.\\" The pre-political essence of the polis, that which makes possible everything which we call political, is the open site from out of which all human relations toward beings are determined.Heidegger (1996), pp. 80‚Äì83. =Human being= It is thus the essence of human being to both ascend within their site and to be without site. Human being bears within it this potential for reversal, a potential essentially grounded in the possibility of being mistaken, of taking nonbeings for beings and beings for nonbeings. Thus human beings are creatures of risk. They seek to become homely within a site, place everything at stake in this, and encounter the fact that the homely refuses itself to them.Heidegger (1996), pp. 87‚Äì89. This is the uncanniness of human being, and this is why deinon does not mean simply power and violence. Human beings do not themselves make themselves the most uncanny thing; it is not a matter of self-consciousness here. Only because human beings can say \\"it is,\\" Heidegger says, can they say \\"I am.\\" And only because they have a relation to being can they \\"say\\" at all, that is, can they be Aristotle's zoon logon echon. It is the distinction of human beings, in other words, to \\"see\\" the open.Heidegger (1996), pp. 90‚Äì91. =Antigone= The closing words of the ode speak of the expulsion of the most uncanny from the hearth. If we were to interpret this as a rejection of Creon, according to Heidegger, then the choral ode would not be a \\"high song of culture\\" so much as a song in praise of mediocrity, of hatred toward the exception. To interpret otherwise than this means asking where Antigone herself stands in relation to the deinon.Heidegger (1996), pp. 92‚Äì97. In the introductory dialogue between Antigone and Ismene, Ismene tries to dissuade her sister from her resolution to bury their brother. Antigone's \\"pursuit\\" is, she says, concerned with that against which nothing can avail. Antigone, in other words, takes the impossible as her point of departure. She says herself that she wishes to suffer or bear the uncanny. In this she is removed from all human possibilities, and is the supreme uncanny.Heidegger (1996), pp. 98‚Äì104. =The hearth= What, then, of the hearth? The chorus speaks not only of expulsion, but of \\"not sharing their delusion with my knowing.\\" All knowledge of the deinon is sustained and guided by that knowing which knows the hearth. The content of this knowing is not stated directly, but it is, however, referred to as a phronein, a meditating from the heart. If this knowledge takes the form of intimation, it is not mere opinion.Heidegger (1996), pp. 105‚Äì107. If mythology is not simply an \\"immature\\" invention, then thinking stands in an essential relation to poetising. Thinking is not the sediment left after the demythologising of myth.Heidegger (1996), pp. 111‚Äì112. Such reflections are intended by Heidegger to assist in the following gesture: the assertion that the hearth, named by the chorus, is being. \\"Being is the hearth.\\"Heidegger (1996), p. 112. He then cites Plato on Hestia, the goddess named for the hearth. The expulsion referred to in the closing words of the choral ode is not a rejection of the unhomely, as much as an impulsion to be attentive to the homely, to risk belonging to it. Being unhomely is a not yet awakened, not yet decided, potential for being homely. This is Antigone's supreme action.Heidegger (1996), pp. 113‚Äì115. =The purest poem= In Heidegger's translation, what determines this action is stated by Antigone as being beyond both the upper and lower gods, beyond Zeus and Dike, but neither can it be any human ordinance. Hence at stake in her action is the most uncanny risk. The closing words of the ode call in the direction of a knowledge of the proper essence of the unhomely one. In this most enigmatic part of his interpretation, Heidegger speaks of \\"the risk of distinguishing and deciding between that being unhomely proper to human beings and a being unhomely that is inappropriate.\\" To be this risk is Antigone's essence.Heidegger (1996), pp. 116‚Äì118. Thus Heidegger concludes that to understand the truth of Antigone, it is necessary to think beyond the cult of the dead or the cult of blood-relatedness, which seem at first glance to be the motors of the tragedy. Antigone, he says, is herself the purest poem.Heidegger (1996), p. 119. Poetising is neither finding nor inventing, but a telling finding of being, revealing that which is always already revealed, the nearest of all that is near. The human potential for being, and the unhomely being homely of human beings upon the earth, is poetic. What is spoken in the choral ode remains indeterminate, but neither vague nor arbitrary. The indeterminate is, on the contrary, that which is undecided yet first to be decided. If this is the case, then the tragedy poetises that which is in the highest sense worthy of poetising. And this may be why this ode came to speak ever anew to the poet H√∂lderlin.Heidegger (1996), pp. 119‚Äì122. Part three: H√∂lderlin's poetising of the essence of the poet as demigod =One's own and the foreign= Sophocles' ode and H√∂lderlin's river hymns poetise the Same, yet they are not identical. To understand this, Heidegger turns to H√∂lderlin's famous letter to Casimir Boehlendorff, which thematises the relations between Germany and Greece. According to Heidegger's reading, what for the Greeks is their own is what is foreign to the Germans, and what is foreign to the Germans is what is proper to the Greeks. H√∂lderlin is the first to experience poetically that becoming homely means being unhomely, thus to understand the need of being unhomely, which he does by venturing into an encounter with the (Greek) foreign.Heidegger (1996), pp. 123‚Äì125. =Spirit= Heidegger then cites H√∂lderlin: \\"namely at home is spirit / not at the commencement, not at the source.\\" He asks: who is \\"spirit\\"? Despite the influence of German metaphysics, Heidegger argues that H√∂lderlin's use of this word was singular, as that which is alongside itself in thinking itself, and always as \\"communal\\" spirit. What spirit thinks is that which is fittingly destined for human beings, yet this is always that which is futural, never something that has been decided; it is something \\"non-actual\\" that is already \\"acting.\\" Poetising is the telling of the thoughts of spirit.Heidegger (1996), pp. 125‚Äì128. Spirit is never \\"at home\\" in the beginning. At the beginning of the history of a people, their destiny is assigned, but what has been assigned is in coming; it is still veiled and equivocal. In the beginning, the ability to fit oneself to one's destiny is as yet disordered, unpracticed. Thus in spirit there prevails the longing for its own essence. But \\"spirit loves colony,\\" that is, in the foreign it wills the mother who is difficult to attain. And it loves \\"bold forgetting,\\" where forgetting means the readiness to learn from the foreign for the sake of what is one's own, so as to defer what is one's own until it is time. It is in this way that the law of being unhomely is the law of becoming homely.Heidegger (1996), pp. 129‚Äì133. =Greeks and Germans= The Greeks, too, had to pass through the foreign. What was proper to the Greeks was \\"the fire from the heavens\\"; what was foreign was the \\"clarity of presentation.\\" Through what was foreign to them they were able to build at the essential ground of the polis. For the Germans, on the other hand, the clarity of presentation is natural‚Äîthe formation of projects, frameworks, etc. What is foreign is the fire from heaven, and thus they must learn to be struck by this fire, and thereby impelled to the correct appropriation of their gift for presentation. Otherwise they shall be exposed to the weakness of suppressing every fire, of pursuing delimitation and institution only for the sake of it. H√∂lderlin is the one who has been struck by this fire, yet why must this be said poetically?Heidegger (1996), pp. 135‚Äì137. =Poem, river, demigod= Heidegger cites H√∂lderlin in order to seek an answer to this question. \\"Full of merit, yet poetically / Humans dwell upon the earth.\\" \\"Full of merit\\" refers, according to Heidegger, to all that humans achieve through the arts, through tekhne, but all that is achieved this way amounts merely to culture. It can be achieved only on the basis of a \\"dwelling\\" which can be seized upon through making or achieving within the realm of the actual. Dwelling, the becoming homely of a being unhomely, is grounded in the poetic.Heidegger (1996), pp. 137‚Äì138. But what is poetry? There must be a poet who poetises in advance the essence of poetry. This will be the poet who ventures into the foreign, to let the fire come toward him. This is what occurs in H√∂lderlin's hymnal poetry. This river poetry never forgets the source, in its issuing and flowing from the source. What it says is the holy, which, beyond the gods, determines the gods. The poet stands between human beings and gods. The poet, and the river, are demigods.Heidegger (1996), pp. 138‚Äì139. Heidegger speaks of the lines of the hymn concerning the invitation to Hercules. We can know nothing of the Ister or the hymn if we do not understand who this guest is. The appropriation of one's own is only as the encounter and guest-like dialogue with the foreign. The river must remain in the realm of its source in such a way that it flows toward it from out of the foreign, which is why it \\"appears, however, almost / To go backwards.\\" Heidegger again uses the word Wirbeln to indicate this swirling near the source.Heidegger (1996), pp. 140‚Äì143. =Historical, ahistorical, unhistorical= This relation to the foreign is never an affirmation of the \\"natural\\" or the \\"organic.\\" These are foreign to the law of history. This law places historical humankind on the difficult path toward its essence. If humankind abandons the law of history, it falls into the unhistorical. Nature is ahistorical, but being unhistorical, as a rupture with the historical, is a particular kind of catastrophe. Heidegger's example of the unhistorical is Americanism.Heidegger (1996), p. 143. The Ister remains enigmatic but historical, in the strange way it flows but also remains close to the source. It is the river in which the foreign is already present as a guest at its source, the river in whose flowing there constantly speaks the dialogue between one's own and the foreign.Heidegger (1996), pp. 144‚Äì146. The rivers are the poets who found the poetic, upon whose ground human beings dwell. Thus the poetic spirit of the river makes arable the land‚Äîit prepares the ground for the hearth of the house of history, opening the time-space within which a belonging to the hearth is possible.Heidegger (1996), pp. 146‚Äì147. =A sign is needed= \\"A sign is needed\\": H√∂lderlin speaks of the sign as having a mind (Gem√ºt), where mind is the ground of all mindful courage (Mut). It is the poet who is named here as the sign. What is needed is the poet's word. Heidegger cites the poem \\"Andenken\\": \\"Yet what remains, the poets found.\\" Heidegger relates the sign's showing to pain, to that knowing proper to being distinct.Heidegger (1996), pp. 148‚Äì153. The sign, the demigod, the river, the poet: all these name poetically the singular ground of the becoming homely of human beings as historical, and the founding of this ground by the poet. At stake is a \\"partaking in feeling\\" with the gods, bearing the sun and moon, sharing the holy. This is for the benefit not only of human beings, but of the gods themselves, who are otherwise without feeling, without unity.Heidegger (1996), pp. 154‚Äì156. =The stairs upon which the heavenly descend= Through the sign, through the rivers, the heavenly find their unity with one another, a unity which does not diminish their singularity. The rivers are their \\"joy.\\" H√∂lderlin speaks of staircases on which the heavenly can descend. Where there are staircases, a dwelling place is also opened up poetically for humans. Poetising founding builds the stairs for this descent of the heavenly. The rivers are the children of the heavens, signs that bear sun and moon in mind, but at the same time the sons of the earth.Heidegger (1996), pp. 157‚Äì160. The hymn ends on an enigmatic note: \\"Yet what that one does, that river, / No one knows.\\" What the vocation of the Ister is, it well knows, but the Rhine, which does not linger at its source but departs sideways, is altogether concealed. Yet the Ister hymn too breaks off‚Äîit shows, it makes manifest, yet it also conceals.Heidegger (1996), pp. 163‚Äì165. =Is there a measure on earth?= Heidegger appends a concluding remark to his reading of the poem. His remarks on the hymn were intended to make us attentive to the poetising of the rivers. But because this is the poetising of the essence of poetry, concealed relations prevail. Such poetry cannot at all be referred to the poet's ego, or to \\"subjectivity.\\" The poet is the river, and vice versa. The unity of locality and journeying here cannot be conceived in terms of \\"space\\" and \\"time,\\" for these are themselves the offspring of the realm that lets their openness spring forth.Heidegger (1996), pp. 165‚Äì166. This poetry demands a transformation in our ways of thinking and experiencing, and we must think beyond representations, symbols, and images. But if we must find a new measure, it must be asked whether we are capable of it. H√∂lderlin asks about this measure, and concludes there is no such measure on earth. This sounds like despair. Yet what H√∂lderlin means is that we must dwell poetically upon this earth, bearing and suffering it rather than forcing and seizing it. If we are strong enough to think, it may be sufficient for us to ponder from afar the truth of this poetry and what it poetises, so that we may suddenly be struck by it.Heidegger (1996), pp. 166‚Äì167. Heidegger ends with a quotation from yet another H√∂lderlin hymn, \\"The Journey\\": In film The lecture course formed the basis of the 2004 film The Ister.

The Italian Renaissance structure (1476-1482) houses the early medieval shrine to Satyrus, brother of Saint Ambrose. The church is known for its false apse, an early example of trompe l'≈ìil, attributed to Donato Bramante. History The church lies on the site of a primitive worship place erected by the archbishop Anspertus in 879, dedicated to Saint Satyrus, confessor and brother of Saints Ambrose and Marcellina. The current church was instead built from 1472 to 1482 under commission from Duchess Bona di Savoia and Duke Gian Galeazzo Sforza.Schofield, Richard and Sironi, Grazioso. \\"Bramante and the problem of Santa Maria presso San Satiro.\\" Annali di architettura: rivista del centro internazionale di architettura Andrea Palladio (2000). p 17-57. According to some sources, the designer was Donato Bramante, who had recently moved from the Marche. However, recent documents prove that Bramante had a minor role, with most of the work being attributable to Giovanni Antonio Amadeo, who designed the fa√ßade. It is certain that Bramante is responsible for the sacristy perspective. According to sources attributing the entire chapel to Bramante, Agostino de Fondulis included a terracotta bust of the architect. The edifice has a nave and two aisles with barrel vault. The nave is surmounted by a hemispherical dome at the crossing with the transept. The bell tower is still that of the Romanesque edifice preceding the 1480s reconstruction. Also from the 15th century is the baptistry annexed to the church. Originally the interior was decorated with white and gold paint. The walls had frescoes by Borgognone, now transferred to the Pinacoteca di Brera. The ancient sacellum of San Satiro was also covered with cotto decoration and enriched with a terracotta portraying the Dead Christ by Agostino de Fondulis. Also by the same artist are several terracotta busts in the sacristy, which is on the central plan, inspired to the Portinari Chapel of Sant'Eustorgio or to the Colleoni Chapel. The church contains an altarpiece of the Extasis of St Phillip Neri (1764) by Giuseppe Peroni. Trompe-l'≈ìil The choir, which had to be truncated a depth of only due to the presence of the road Via Falcone behind the church, was replaced by Bramante with a painted perspective, realizing in this way one of the first examples of trompe l'oeil in history of art.

History  One of the halls of the museum The museum started out as a branch of the Zoological Museum of Moscow University. When founded in 1937, the museum occupied 700 sq. m. in a building on Bolshaya Kaluzhskaya Street. During the German-Soviet War the museum was closed and the major part of collection relocated to Alma-Ata. In 1944 museum was reopened for the general public, but in 1954 it was closed again due to the shortage of display space. In 1965 the USSR Council of Ministers granted 2 million rubles for the construction of the new museum building. However, construction works started only in 1972. The renewed museum met the first visitors in 1987.

EtherSound is developed and licensed by Digigram. EtherSound is intended by the developer to be compliant with IEEE 802.3 Ethernet standards. Just as the IEEE defines rates such as 100 Megabit and Gigabit Ethernet standards, EtherSound has been developed as both ES-100 (for use on dedicated 100 Megabit Ethernet networks or within a Gigabit network as a VLAN) and ES-Giga (for use on dedicated Gigabit Ethernet networks). The two versions of EtherSound are not compatible. Network technology While Ethersound is compliant with the IEEE 802.3 physical layer standards, logically it uses a token passing scheme of transporting audio data which prevents all of its features from being used on a standard Ethernet network. On a standard network it is only able to distribute audio and control data one way. It is not designed to share Ethernet LANs with typical office operations data or Internet traffic such as email. It supports two way communications only when wired in a daisy chain topology. For this reason Ethersound is best used in applications suitable to a daisy chain network topology or in live sound applications that benefit from its low point-to-point latency. Low latency Low latency is important for many users of audio over Ethernet technologies.One of the most critical applications involves picking up sound from a vocalist's or instrumentalist's microphone on a live performance stage, mixing that signal with those received from other microphones (and performers) and delivering the mix to the performer via in-ear monitors. Latency in this application is particularly annoying to vocalists. This is because a singer hears his or her own voice through bone conduction as well as through the outer ear. If the sound from the in-ear monitor lags the bone-conduction sound by more than a few milliseconds, phase shifts and comb filtering will become audible. EtherSound can deliver up to 64 channels of 48 kHz, 24-bit PCM audio data with a network latency of 125 microseconds. If including A/D and D/A conversions, this latency is about 1.5 milliseconds, the major part of this latency being caused by the converters.

Using scientific processes such as biotechnology (including technologies such as genetic engineering, tissue culture, and cloning) the artworks are produced in laboratories, galleries, or artists' studios. The scope of BioArt is considered by some artists to be strictly limited to \\"living forms\\", while other artists would include art that uses the imagery of contemporary medicine and biological research, or require that it address a controversy or blind spot posed by the very character of the life sciences. Although BioArtists work with living matter, there is some debate as to the stages at which matter can be considered to be alive or living. Creating living beings and practicing in the life sciences brings about ethical, social, and aesthetic inquiry. The phrase \\"BioArt\\" was coined by Eduardo Kac in 1997 in relation to his artwork Time Capsule. Although it originated at the end of the 20th century, through the works of pioneers like Suzanne Anker, Joe Davis, and the artists hosted by Symbiotica, BioArt is more widely practiced now. Overview Self Portre 1988 Yin - Yang (BioArt), playing on the parallels between image manipulation and cloning BioArt is often intended to be shocking or humorous. One survey of the field, Isotope: A Journal of Literary Science and Nature Writing, puts it this way: \\"BioArt is often ludicrous. It can be lumpy, gross, unsanitary, sometimes invisible, and tricky to keep still on the auction block. But at the same time, it does something very traditional that art is supposed to do: draw attention to the beautiful and grotesque details of nature that we might otherwise never see.\\" The Art is Alive While raising questions about the role of science in society, \\"most of these works tend toward social reflection, conveying political and societal criticism through the combination of artistic and scientific processes.\\" While most people who practice BioArt are categorized as artists in this new media, they can also be seen as scientists, since the actual medium within a work pertains to molecular structures, and so forth. Because of this dual-acceptance, the Department of Cell Biology at Harvard University invites anyone to submit works based on scientific or artistic value.BIOart This can encourage anyone to submit work they strongly respond to. Exposing artists to laboratories The laboratory work can pose a challenge to the artist, at first, as the environment is often foreign to the artist. While some artists have prior scientific training, others must be trained to perform the procedures or work in tandem with scientists who can perform the tasks that are required. Bio artists often use formations relating to or engaged with science and scientific practices, such as working with bacteria or live-tissue. Much of the art involves tissue-culturing and transgenics, a term for a variety of genetic engineering processes through which genetic material from one organism is altered by the addition of synthesized or transplanted genetic material from another organism. In 2000, Eduardo Kac commissioned the creation of a transgenic GFP bunny as part of a piece called GFP Bunny. \\"The PR campaign included a picture of Kac holding a white rabbit and another, iconic image of a rabbit photographically enhanced to appear green.\\" The Tissue Culture & Art Project in collaboration with Stelarc grew a 1/4 scale replica of an ear using human cells. The project was carried out at Symbiotica: the Art & Science Collaborative Research Laboratory, School of Anatomy and Human Biology, University of Western Australia. In 2011 the BFA Fine Arts Department of the School of Visual Arts in New York City opened the first Bio Art Laboratory in an art school in the US. The SVA Bio Art Lab offers art students access to scientific tools and techniques to create works of art. Art addressing topics in biology and society It is debated whether BioArt must, like this work of microbial art, be made with actual organisms. Artwork made with bacteria expressing 8 different colors of fluorescent proteins The scope of the term BioArt is a subject of ongoing debate. The primary point of debate centers around whether BioArt must necessarily involve manipulation of biological material, as is the case in microbial art which by definition is made of microbes. A broader definition of the term would include work that addresses the social and ethical considerations of the biological sciences.See Bio Art entry in Oxford Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2007-2014. Under these terms BioArt as a genre has many crossovers with fields such as critical or speculative design. This type of work often reaches a much broader general audience, and is focused on starting discussions in this space, rather than pioneering or even using specific biological practices. Examples in this space include Ray Fish shoes, which advertised shoes made and patterned with genetically engineered stingray skin, BiteLabs, a biotech startup that attempted to make salami out of meat cultured from celebrity tissue samples, and Ken Rinaldo's Augmented Fish Reality, an installation of five rolling robotic fish-bowl sculptures controlled by Siamese Fighting Fish. Controversy BioArt has been scrutinized for its apparent lack of ethics. USA Today reported that animal rights groups accused Kac and others of using animals unfairly for their own personal gain, and conservative groups question the use of transgenic technologies and tissue-culturing from a moral standpoint. Alka Chandna, a senior researcher with PETA in Norfolk, Virginia, has stated that using animals for the sake of art is no different from using animal fur for clothing material. \\"Transgenic manipulation of animals is just a continuum of using animals for human end, regardless of whether it is done to make some sort of sociopolitical critique. The suffering and exacerbation of stress on the animals is very problematic.\\" However, many BioArt projects deal with the manipulation of cells and not whole organisms, such as Victimless Leather by Symbiotica. \\"An actualized possibility of wearing 'leather' without killing an animal is offered as a starting point for cultural discussion. Our intention is not to provide yet another consumer product, but rather to raise questions about our exploitation of other living beings.\\" See also * Computer art * Cyberarts * Digital art * Ecological art * Electronic art * Environmental art * Evolutionary art * Genetic art * Hybrid arts * Internet art * Land art * Neuroaesthetics * New Media art References Bibliography * Sammartano, Paola.

Yankev-Meyer Zalkind (1875 - 1937) was a British Orthodox rabbi, an anarcho-communist, a close friend of Rudolf Rocker, and an active anti-militarist. He was born in Lithuania, and both his merchant father and mother were both descendants of numerous famous rabbis. Zalkind was well versed in Jewish texts, and was a graduate of the Volozhin yeshiva, where he learned with Hayim Nahman Bialik. He also had a broad education and he was knowledgeable in over 20 languages and was able to write about a dozen with ease. He also obtained a doctorate in philosophy. His early political leanings were as a Zionist, and was active in his attempts to help set up a settlement in Israel, and to that end studied agronomy. However in 1916 he became an opponent of the war and returned to London to campaign as an anti-militarist. Zalkind became an anti-Zionist and wanted to create an anarchist society in Mandatory Palestine where refugees would be welcomed. Rabbi Zalkind was also a prolific Yiddish writer and a prominent Torah scholar, who authored a few volumes of commentaries on the Talmud. He believed, that the ethics of the Talmud, if properly understood, is closely related to anarchism.

James H. Doolittle Combined Air and Space Operations Center facility (612th Air and Space Operations Center) at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Ariz., 2013 An Air Operations Center (AOC) is a type of command center used by the United States Air Force (USAF). It is the senior agency of the Air Force component commander to provide command and control of air operations.Air Force Doctrine Document 1-2, Air Force Glossary . 11 January 2007. Accessed 29 January 2011. The United States Air Force employs two kinds of AOCs: regional AOCs utilizing the AN/USQ-163 Falconer weapon system that support geographic combatant commanders, and functional AOCs that support functional combatant commanders.Air Force Doctrine Document 2, Operations and Organization . 3 April 2007. Accessed 29 January 2011. When there is more than one U.S. military service working in an AOC, such as when naval aviation from the U.S. Navy (USN) and/or the U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) is incorporated, it is called a Joint Air Operations Center (JAOC). In cases of allied or coalition (multinational) operations in tandem with USAF or Joint air and space operations, the AOC is called a Combined Air Operations Center (CAOC). An AOC is the senior element of the Theater Air Control System (TACS). The Joint Force Commander (JFC) assigns a Joint Forces Air Component Commander (JFACC) to lead the AOC weapon system. If allied or coalition forces are part of the operation, the JFC and JFACC will be redesignated as the CFC and CFACC, respectively. Quite often the Commander, Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR) is assigned the JFACC/CFACC position for planning and executing theater-wide air and space forces. If another service also provides a significant share of air and space forces, the Deputy JFACC/CFACC will typically be a senior flag officer from that service. For example, during Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom, when USAF combat air forces (CAF) and mobility air forces (MAF) integrated extensive USN and USMC sea-based and land-based aviation and Royal Air Force (RAF) and Royal Navy / Fleet Air Arm aviation, the CFACC was an aeronautically rated USAF lieutenant general, assisted by an aeronautically designated USN rear admiral (upper half) as the Deputy CFACC, and an aeronautically rated RAF air commodore as the Senior British Officer (Air). Divisions There are five divisions in the AOC. These separate, but distinct, organizations fuse information that eventually becomes the Air Tasking Order. Staffing of these divisions consists primarily of USAF officers of various specialities in the ranks of captain, major and lieutenant colonel, supported by a smaller cohort of enlisted airmen, typically in the rank of staff sergeant and above. When conducting joint air and space operations, U.S. Army and USMC officers of similar rank and USN officers in the ranks of lieutenant, lieutenant commander and commander will also provide augmentative manning as required, the majority of whom will be aeronautically rated/aeronautically designated. Senior leadership oversight of the AOC is provided by USAF colonels and general officers and USN captains and flag officers. =Strategy Division (SRD)= * Strategy Plans Team * Strategy Guidance Team * Operational Assessment Team * Information Operations Team =Combat Plans Division (CPD)= * Target Effects Team * Master Air Attack Plan Team * Air Tasking Order Production Team * Command and Control Planning Team =Combat Operations Division (COD)= * Offensive Ops Team * Defensive Ops Team * Personnel Recovery * Senior Intelligence Duty Officer * Joint Interface Control Officer * Weather Specialty Team * Naval Air Liaison Element (NALE) ** USN + USMC; NALE also provides personnel/support to CPD and ISRD =Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance Division (ISRD)= * Analysis, Correlation, and Fusion * Targeting and Tactical Assessment * ISR Operations =Air Mobility Division (AMD)= * AMD Chief * Deputy AMD Chief * Superintendent * Air Mobility Control Team (AMCT) ** Execution Cell ** Mission Management ** Flight Management ** USAPAT Mission Planner ** Maintenance * Airlift Control Team (ALCT) ** Airlift Plans ** DV Airlifts ** Diplomatic Clearance ** Requirements * Air Refueling Control Team (ARCT) * Aeromedical Evacuation Control Team (AECT) * Unique Missions Support Team (AMDU) Active Air Operations Centers { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" +List of Active US Air Force Air Operations Centers !Name !Emblem !Location !Country !Major Command !Parent Organization !Unified Combat Comand !Type !Role - valign=\\"top\\"  style=\\"white-space: nowrap;\\" 601st Air Operations Center 75x75px Tyndall AFB, Florida  style=\\"white-space: nowrap;\\"  Air Combat Command First Air Force (Air Forces Northern) US Northern Command Regional Command and control for air defense, homeland security and civil support missions for North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) and US Northern Command across the Continental US, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. - valign=\\"top\\" 603rd Air Operations Center 75x75px Ramstein AB  US Air Forces in Europe ‚Äì Air Forces Africa Third Air Force US European Command and US Africa Command Regional Command and control of air and space operations in Europe and Africa. - valign=\\"top\\" 607th Air Operations Center 75x75px Osan AB  Pacific Air Forces Seventh Air Force (Air Forces Korea) US Indo-Pacific Command Regional Command and control of air and space operations in the Korean peninsula, supporting US Forces Korea. - valign=\\"top\\" 608th Air Operations Center 75x75px Barksdale AFB, Louisiana  Air Force Global Strike Command Eighth Air Force (Air Forces Strategic) US Strategic Command Functional Command and control of long-range strike missions. - valign=\\"top\\" 609th Air Operations Center 75x75px Al Udeid Air Base  Air Combat Command US Air Forces Central US Central Command Regional Also known as the Combined Air Operations Center, commands and controls the USAF operations from Northeast Africa across the Middle East to Central and South Asia. - valign=\\"top\\" 611th Air Operations Center 75x75px Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska  Pacific Air Forces Eleventh Air Force US Northern Command Regional Command and control for the Alaskan Region of North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), Alaskan Command and Eleventh Air Force within and surrounding Alaska. - valign=\\"top\\" 612th Air Operations Center 75x75px Davis Mothan AFB, Arizona  Air Combat Command Twelfth Air Force (Air Forces Southern) US Southern Command Regional Command and control of USAF operations in the Caribbean, Central and South America. - valign=\\"top\\" 613th Air Operations Center 75x75px Joint Base Pearl Harbor- Hickam, Hawaii  Pacific Air Forces Eleventh Air Force US Indo-Pacific Command Regional Command and control of USAF operations in the throughout the Indo-Asia-Pacific region. - valign=\\"top\\" 616th Operations Center  Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland, Texas  Air Combat Command Sixteenth Air Force (Air Forces Cyber) US Cyber Command Functional Command and control of USAF worldwide intelligence, surveillance & reconnaissance and cyberwarfare operations. - valign=\\"top\\" 618th Air Operations Center 75x75px Scott AFB, Illinois  Air Mobility Command Eighteenth Air Force (Air Forces Transportation) US Transportation Command Functional Also known as Tanker Airlift Control Center, it plans, schedules and directs airlift, air-refueling and aeromedical evacuation operations around the world. - valign=\\"top\\" Combined Air Operations Center - Experimental  Joint Base Langley‚ÄìEustis, Virginia  Air Combat Command US Air Force Warfare Center N/A Test and evaluation Test bed for command and control systems.

In the 14th century, a Qadi by the name of Syed Mahmud came to Rang to propagate the religion of Islam to its inhabitants. The Brahman family willingly accepted Islam. They decided gave up their position as the Priests of Rang, and migrated to Nabinagar to start a new life. Rang was named as Brahmanbaria (lit. Brahmins leaving in the local dialect of the district) after this incident. The area Mahmud resided in was named Kazipara (Kazi being a variant of Qadi) after him, and his mazar (mausoleum) remains there. Brahmanbaria Thana was converted into an upazila in 1984. Demographics According to the 1991 Bangladesh census, Brahmanbaria Sadar had a population of 659,449. Males constituted 51.38% of the population, and females 48.62%. The population aged 18 or over was 312,696. Brahmanbaria Sadar had an average literacy rate of 30.1% (7+ years), against the national average of 32.4%.

The English translation, by George Collins and Richard Beardsworth, was published by Stanford University Press in 1998. The Technics and Time series is the fullest systematic statement by Stiegler of his philosophy, and the first volume draws on the work of Martin Heidegger, Andr√© Leroi-Gourhan, Gilbert Simondon, Bertrand Gille, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Jean-Pierre Vernant in order to outline and develop Stiegler's major philosophical theses. The series currently consists of three books. Overview Stiegler argues that \\"technics\\" forms the horizon of human existence. This fact has been suppressed throughout the history of philosophy, which has never ceased to operate on the basis of a distinction between episteme and tekhne. The thesis of the book is that the genesis of technics corresponds not only to the genesis of what is called \\"human\\" but of temporality as such, and that this is the clue toward understanding the future of the dynamic process in which the human and the technical consists. *Part I conducts a reading of approaches to the history of technology and the origin of hominisation, in particular by Andr√© Leroi- Gourhan, Gilbert Simondon, and Bertrand Gille. The outcome of this reading is the thought that history cannot be thought according to the idea that humanity is the \\"subject\\" of this history and technology simply the object. When it comes to the relation between the human and the technical, the \\"who\\" and the \\"what\\" are in an undecidable relation. *Part II is largely a reading of the work of Martin Heidegger in terms of the above consideration. Stiegler argues that Heidegger's philosophy fails adequately to grasp that, if there is such a thing as authentic temporality, the only access to it can be via objects, artefacts and, in general, technics, without which access to the past and future is impossible as such. Crucial to Stiegler's formulation of his understanding of humanity, technology, and time, is his reading of the myth of Prometheus. Succeeding volumes Stiegler published three volumes in the Technics and Time series. The Fault of Epimetheus was followed by Tome 2: La d√©sorientation (1996) and Tome 3: Le temps du cin√©ma et la question du mal- √™tre (2001). Volume Two was published in translation by Stanford University Press in 2008 with the subtitle, Disorientation. Volume Three appeared in 2010 with the subtitle, Cinematic Time and the Question of Malaise (both volumes translated by Stephen Barker).

The station, known as \\"B106.7,\\" is owned by Cumulus Media and airs an adult contemporary radio format. Between Thanksgiving week and December 25, it switches to all- Christmas music. The studios and offices are located on Gervais Street in Downtown Columbia. WTCB has an effective radiated power of 100,000 watts, the highest permitted for non-grandfathered FM stations. The transmitter is off Indian Trail in Swansea, near the Congaree National Park. History =WDIX- FM and WPJS= On July 6, 1967, the station signed on as WDIX-FM.Broadcasting Yearbook 1970 page B-182 It was the sister station to WDIX AM 1150 in Orangeburg (formerly WRNO, now off the air). The station was known as W-107 and was owned by Frank Best. At the time, the station featured an automated format with music that would be considered today as Hot Adult Contemporary. In late 1976, both stations were sold to Radio Smiles, a group owned by Norman Suttles. WDIX changed to Top 40, while WDIX-FM became religious WPJS. The call sign stood for We Proclaim Jesus Saves. In 1978, the transmitting power was increased from 37,000 to 100,000 watts, utilizing a new CCA transmitter and 10-bay Shively antenna tower. =Country WIGL= In 1982, WDIX and WPJS were sold to the Keymarket Group. WPJS became country music WIGL, calling itself \\"Wiggle 106.\\" It used a format from TM's (now Jones TM) \\"3-In-A-Row\\" Modern Country music service, operating it live-assisted. WIGL made an effort to serve the larger, more lucrative Columbia radio market, but was plagued with periodical audio problems as well as fierce competition from established country station 97.5 WCOS-FM. In 1984, Suburban Radio Group of Concord, North Carolina, bought WDIX, and in 1985 the company bought WORG.Ted DeAdwyler, \\"WPEG Owners Keep Radio Chain Young, Aggressive,\\" The Charlotte Observer, March 9, 1986. In early 1985, WIGL took the first steps toward improving its coverage of Columbia by building a new 714 foot tower in Sandy Run and moving the studios to the Granby Building in Cayce. It was rumored that WIGL would remain country and challenge Columbia's longtime country powerhouse, WCOS-FM. That rumor proved false. =Switch to AC= On April 15, 1985; the station signed on from its new tower as an Adult Contemporary/CHR/Oldies hybrid with the new call letters WTCB and a new moniker, \\"B106.\\" WTCB quickly improved its ratings, with a more contemporary sound and a signal that covered two-thirds of South Carolina. WTCB provides at least secondary coverage from the southern suburbs of Charlotte to the northern suburbs of Charleston. By the late 1980s, due to changing market conditions, B106 softened its music by dropping the more upbeat titles and focused on being a soft adult contemporary outlet. At that time, the market had two other AC outlets, WSCQ and new upstart WAAS (now WARQ), fighting for Columbia's AC audience. By the end of 1992, both stations flipped to different formats, leaving B106 as the only AC remaining in the market. Bloomington Broadcasting purchased the station in 1989 from Keymarket Communications for $4.34 million.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 2000 page D-402 Bill McElveen was the General Manager until Cumulus Media purchased the station in late 2011. Former logo used between 1993 and May 2013 Beginning in 1993, B106 gradually went back toward a more upbeat Gold based AC format. With the increasing use of digital tuners on radios, the station updated its on-air moniker as \\"B106.7.\\" =Gamecocks football= From September 2002 until November 2007, WTCB was the flagship radio station for University of South Carolina Gamecocks football, taking over from longtime outlet 560 WVOC. WTCB devoted a significant number of hours to pre-game and post-game coverage on Saturdays when the team played its games. When Citadel Broadcasting moved co- owned 107.5 WNKT from the Charleston radio market to Columbia, it switched that station to an all sports format. It became the logical outlet for local college football. Citadel merged with Cumulus Media on September 16, 2011. =Format adjustments= On July 15, 2013, WTCB shifted its format to hot adult contemporary. With the change by sister station 98.5 WOMG from classic hits to country music in 2014, WTCB added some 1980s music to its playlist. In 2015, WTCB moved to new studio in downtown Columbia, across from the State Capital in The Tower building currently anchored by the Bank of America. The air staff during this time includes afternoon host Steve McKay and midday personality Summer aka Summer James (Social media-1Summer)originally from SC and most recently heard & seen on L.A.radio /TV. The syndicated wake up show \\"Bob & Sheri\\" from Charlotte was heard in morning drive time. A few years later, WTCB shifted back to a mainstream adult contemporary sound. It also began the practice of playing all Christmas music from Thanksgiving week until Christmas Day.

She is Emeritus Professor at the University of Birmingham. Biography Frances Young taught theology at the University of Birmingham from 1971, becoming the Edward Cadbury Professor and Head of the Department of Theology in 1986. During her time at the University, she also served as Dean of the Faculty of Arts (1995‚Äì97) and Pro-Vice-Chancellor (1997‚Äì2002). In 1984, she was ordained as a Methodist minister, and has combined preaching in a local Circuit and pursuing her academic career. In 1998, she was awarded an OBE for services to Theology and in 2004, elected a Fellow of the British Academy. In 2005, she retired from the University. On 15 November 2005, she preached at the opening service of the Eighth General Synod Church of England, the first Methodist and the first woman to preach at the five-yearly inauguration ceremony. She delivered her sermon at the Eucharist service at which the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr. Rowan Williams, presided. She served as editor of volumes 39‚Äì43 of the Studia patristica and wrote academic and more popular theological writings, drawing on her work on the New Testament and on Christianity in its formative centuries, but also on her experience as the mother of a son (Arthur) who was born with profound physical and mental disabilities. For this reason, she worked on the theological and ecumenical dimensions of the L'Arche communities with Jean Vanier, their founder. According to local guides, in August 1965 she became the first woman to climb Ranrapalca (c. 20,000 ft) in the Peruvian Andes. The Myth of God Incarnate Young was one of the contributors to The Myth of God Incarnate (1977), alongside Don Cupitt, Michael Goulder, John Hick, Leslie Houlden, Dennis Nineham, and Maurice Wiles. This book caused quite a controversy at the time of its publication, as it seemed to cast doubt on the traditional Christian belief in the incarnation. In her essay \\"Two Roots or Tangled Mess\\", she criticised her fellow contributor Michael Goulder for presenting a hypothetical reconstruction which had \\"an exclusive concentration on one or two specific sources\\" and thus failed to look at the complexity of the borderlines of Judaism. In \\"A Cloud of Witnesses\\", she calls attention to the different forms in which the early Church spoke of Jesus, and suggests also that the idea of incarnation is part of a symbolic or mythological framework, by which she does not mean the terms are false but rather that \\"they refer to realities which are ... indefinable in terms of human language, and in their totality, inconceivable within the limited powers and experience of the finite human mind.\\" Trevor Beeson, in his review in Christian Century (31 August ‚Äì 7 September 1977 edition, p. 74) found her section one of the most important, saying that her \\"contribution deserves the most careful examination\\". In the follow-up volume, Incarnation and Myth (1979), she looked at what kind of \\"evidence\\" existed in the sources, and showed the strangeness of the language used in her essay \\"God Suffered and Died\\", and questioned whether traditional concepts of incarnation made sense, and whether they tended to docetism, losing sight of the suffering of Christ: \\"I find myself able to say: ‚ÄúI see God in Jesus,‚Äù and ‚ÄúGod was in Christ reconciling the world to himself,‚Äù and other such traditional statements without necessarily having to spell it out in terms of a literal incarnation. I find salvation in Christ, because in him God is disclosed to me as a ‚Äúsuffering God.‚Äù God is not only disclosed in him, nor is revelation confined to ‚Äúbiblical times‚Äù; but Jesus is the supreme disclosure which opens my eyes to God in the present, and while remaining a man who lived in a particular historical situation, he will always be the unique focus of my perception of and response to God.\\" However, after further historical research, when she came to write \\"From Nicaea to Chalcedon\\", she remarked that she had changed her views; she now thought that the metaphysical language of the early church fathers did make sense once understood properly \\"as a result of a more profound engagement with the material in the research\\", a position she was later to take up in \\"The Making of the Creeds\\". Theological Work Other notable theological work includes \\"The Making of the Creeds\\" in which she explained how the creeds arose in the struggle to understand ideas of incarnation and trinity: \\"they were not initially 'tests of orthodoxy' but as summaries of faith taught to new Christians by their local bishops, summaries that were traditional to each local church and which in detail varied from place to place\\". She convincingly explains that, far from being abstract theological mind games, the credal disputes were \\"fired by concern that the gospel of salvation be safeguarded. At the heart of the life of the church was the belief that salvation was being realised, and at the heart of early Christian theology was a sense of the sacramental and spiritual reality of that salvation.\\" Bibliography *Sacrifice and the death of Christ, Philadelphia : Westminster Press, 1975, *The Myth of God Incarnate, ed.

Early life Zelma Watson was born to Samuel E.J. and Lena (Thomas) Watson in Hearne, Texas on December 8, 1903.Zelma Watson George (1997). The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History. Her mother was a coordinator of religious activities at Tennessee State College in Nashville, Tennessee. Her father was a Baptist minister, which caused them to move frequently. In 1917 the family moved to Topeka, Kansas from Dallas, Texas because the white citizens of Dallas did not approve of Samuel E.J. Watson assisting African-American prisoners. Zelma Watson was born the eldest of six children. Education After graduating from Topeka Public Schools George enrolled at the University of Chicago and obtained a bachelor's degree in sociology in 1924. She then went on to Northwestern University and studied the pipe organ from 1924 until 1926, and in 1925 enrolled as a voice student at the American Conservatory of Music in Chicago until 1927. In 1943, George received her master's degree in personnel administration from New York University as well as her Ph.D in Sociology in 1954. Her doctoral dissertation, A Guide to Negro Music: Towards a Sociology of Negro Music, which catalogued about 12,000 musical compositions written or enthused by African Americans, due to her extraordinary work, allowed her to receive honorary doctorates from Heidelberg College and Baldwin Wallace College in 1961 as well as Cleveland State University in 1974. Personal life Zelma married Baxter Duke in 1937. They were divorced in 1942. In 1944, she married attorney Clayborne George of Ohio who was President of the Cleveland, Ohio, Civil Service Commission. The couple had no children. Zelma was active in the civic affairs of Cleveland as a member of the National Conference of Christians and Jews, the League of Women Voters, Girl Scouts and Alpha Kappa Alpha. She sang in church groups, directed choirs, appeared on lecture programs, and studied singing. Musical accomplishments George received a Rockefeller Foundation grant to study African-American music. After completing her study, she wrote the musical drama Chariot's A'Comin!, which was locally aired on television in Cleveland in 1949. She went on to be cast as the first African-American woman to act in a typically White role, in Gian-Carlo Menotti's opera The Medium at the Karamu Theater in Cleveland and the Edison Theatre in New York City. Following her debut, George was honored with the Merit Award of the National Association of Negro Musicians. George was later cast in Gian-Carlo Menotti's The Consul and Kurt Weill's The Three Penny Opera. Political and philanthropy accomplishments In the 1950s George was an advisor to President Dwight Eisenhower's Administration. She was involved with various national government committees, which usually concerned women, youth, and African Americans.

Mary Heaton Vorse O'Brien (October 11, 1874 ‚Äì June 14, 1966) was an American journalist, labor activist, social critic, and novelist. She was outspoken and active in peace and social justice causes, such as women's suffrage, civil rights, pacifism (such as opposition to World War I), socialism, child labor, infant mortality, labor disputes, and affordable housing. Early life Mary Heaton was born October 11, 1874, in New York City to Ellen Marvin Heaton and Hiram Heaton. She was raised in prosperity in Amherst, Massachusetts, in a 24-room house with half-siblings from her mother's previous marriage.Garrison, Mary Heaton Vorse, pg. 3. The money in the family came from her mother's side. In 1852, Vorse's mother married Captain Charles Bernard Marvin, a wealthy shipping magnate and liquor merchant, more than 20 years her senior, when she was a young woman of 18. Ellen Marvin was widowed at age 37 with five children. In 1873, she married Mary's father, who, with his family, operated the Stockbridge Inn.Garrison, Mary Heaton Vorse, pp. 5-6. The family traveled widely, spending over a year in Europe, where Mary attended kindergarten in Hanover and the first year of grade school in Dresden, learning the German language in the process.Vorse, A Footnote to Folly, pg 26. Later, the family had an apartment in Paris, where Mary learned French, followed later by a winter in Austria. In her 1935 memoir, she dated her interest in the problems of politics and economics to the years of her youth, when her mother read to her aloud from a book by ethnographer George Kennan on the brutal Siberian penal system of Russia.Mary Heaton Vorse, A Footnote to Folly: Reminiscences of Mary Heaton Vorse. New York: Farrar and Rinehart, 1935; pg. 22. An interest in classic Russian literature followed, complemented by directed reading with her father on topics of American history.Vorse, A Footnote to Folly, pp. 22-23. She found her intellect stimulated by life in the college town of Amherst and discussions held in the family home between her father and several prominent friends from academia, including the president of Massachusetts Agricultural College, Henry Hill Goodell, and anthropology professor John Tyler.Vorse, A Footnote to Folly, pg 25. She was allowed to leave the formal school system at a young age and subsequently spent several winters in Paris studying art. In 1896, Heaton began to study at the Art Students' League, on West 57th Street in New York City. The League was established 20 years earlier by strong-minded young men in rebellion from the conservative nature of the instruction at the National Academy of Design. By the time that Mary entered, the school was booming, with over 1100 pupils studying in sex-segregated day and evening classes, studying sketch art, sculpture, and painting.Garrison, Mary Heaton Vorse, pg. 22. While Mary found participation in the artistic avant-garde exhilarating, she unfortunately was sadly lacking in talent. She wrote in her diary: \\"When I come into my room and see my work lying around, my sense of my own futility overwhelms me. After so much work, that is all I can do.\\"Garrison, Mary Heaton Vorse, pg. 24. Career She was young, intelligent, and athletic and was deeply influenced by the ideas of feminism that had begun to emerge as the 19th century came to a close. Many upper-class women such as Mary were in the forefront of the movement for women's rights to economic independence, education, voting rights, and birth control.Garrison, Mary Heaton Vorse, pg. 16. Her first husband was Albert White \\"Bert\\" Vorse, a widely traveled journalist who had worked for a year in a Boston settlement house, run by Edward Everett Hale.Vorse, A Footnote to Folly, pg 28. They were married on October 26, 1898Massachusetts, Marriage Records, 1840-1915 after a brief courtship and had two children: a boy, Heaton,1910 United States Federal Census born in 1901 and a girl, Mary, born in 1907.Garrison, Mary Heaton Vorse, pp. 25, 29, 38. The couple began to take an increased interest in social problems of the day, spurred by the muckraking reformist politics of the day and a personal friendship with radical journalist Lincoln Steffens. The Vorses would frequently go sailing with Steffens and his wife on the Vorses' boat, where they would be regaled with Steffens's \\"epic stories\\" of \\"gigantic lootings and skulduggeries.\\"Vorse, A Footnote to Folly, pg. 29. Bert was soon assigned to Paris as the correspondent of the Philadelphia Ledger. It was in France that Mary, encouraged and instructed by her husband, began to try her own hand at professional writing. She began to create and sell romantic fiction to women's magazines. Her stories often featured the motif of a rugged and energetic heroine who managed to win the affection of a coveted male over a more constrained and conventionally feminine rival.Garrison, Mary Heaton Vorse, pg. 31. In 1904, the Vorses moved to Venice, where Mary was first introduced into the world of the working class and their labor struggles.Garrison, Mary Heaton Vorse, pp. 32-33. Bert died on June 14, 1910, of a cerebral hemorrhage.Garrison, Mary Heaton Vorse, pg. 44. Activism and journalism American delegates to the April 1915 International Women's Peace Congress in The Hague. In 1912, she married the journalist Joe O'Brien, a socialist from Virginia whom she met at the 1912 Lawrence Textile Strike.Garrison, Mary Heaton Vorse, pp. 56, 60. The couple had one child, a boy born in 1914.Garrison, Mary Heaton Vorse, pg. 84. Joe O'Brien died in 1915.Garrison, Mary Heaton Vorse, pg. 100. Vorse was active in the fight against militarism and American entry into World War I and was a founding member of the Woman's Peace Party in January 1915. She was chosen as the delegate of the New York Woman Suffrage Party to an International Women's Peace Congress held in The Hague at the end of April 1915, traveling aboard the MS Noordam through mine-strewn waters to attend.Garrison, Mary Heaton Vorse, pg. 88. She wrote for the New York Post, New York World, McCall's, Harper's Weekly, Atlantic Monthly, The Masses, New Masses, New Republic, and McClure's Magazine as well as various news services. She participated in and reported on the Lawrence Textile Strike, the steel strike of 1919, the textile workers strike of 1934, and coal strikes in Harlan County, Kentucky. From 1919 to 1923, Vorse was in a relationship with the radical political cartoonist and Communist Party functionary Robert Minor.Garrison, Mary Heaton Vorse, pp. 137, 184. Awards Four years before her death in 1966, the 88-year-old Vorse entered the silver jubilee banquet of the United Auto Workers, accompanied by union leader Walter Reuther. There, she received the first UAW Social Justice Award, with former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt and novelist Upton Sinclair looking on to share her honor.Dee Garrison (ed.), \\"Introduction\\" to Rebel Pen: The Writings of Mary Heaton Vorse. New York: Monthly Review Press, 1985. Page 7. Vorse was feted for her work as one of the most important labor journalists of the 1920s and 1930s. Death and legacy Vorse died of a heart attack on June 14, 1966, at her home in Provincetown, Massachusetts, on the extreme tip of Cape Cod, where she was buried.Garrison, Mary Heaton Vorse, pp. 325-327. She was 92 years old. In addition to her memoir written in 1935, Vorse participated in an oral history project at Columbia University in 1957, an interview that was transcribed and microfilmed by the university.\\"Reminiscences of Mary Heaton Vorse: Oral History, 1957,\\" Transcription copyright by the Trustees of Columbia University in the City of New York, 1975. Vorse also wrote several ghost stories, including \\"The Second Wife\\" (1912).Catherine A.

High levels of exposure to noise may result in noise-induced hearing loss. Measures to protect the ear are referred to as hearing protection, and devices for that purpose are called hearing protection devices. In the context of work, adequate hearing protection is that which reduces noise exposure to below 85 dBA over the course of an average work shift of eight hours. When sounds exceed 80 dBA, it becomes dangerous to the ears. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has standards that show how long a person can be in different loudness levels before the person reaches their maximum daily dose and becomes damaging to their hearing. These standards can give individuals an idea of when hearing protection should be considered. The maximum daily dose with the corresponding decibel level is shown below. Decibel Level with the time reaching maximum daily dose (dBA): * 8 hours at 85 dB(A) * 4 hours at 88 dB(A) * 2 hours at 91 dB(A) * 60 minutes at 94 dB(A) * 30 minutes at 97 dB(A) * 15 minutes at 100 dB(A) Different types of hearing protection may be utilized to maximize hearing protection. OSHA regulations dictate whether hearing protection is required and if the company must participate in a hearing conservation program. Types of ear protection include: *Earplugs, internal: These are ear protection that fit inside of the person's ear canal. There are many different types of ear plugs. The most commonly known are foam, musician, or custom earplugs that are made from a mold of a person's ear. *Earmuffs, external: This ear protection fits snug around the person's external ear. *Helmet, covering various parts of the head, including the ears In some occasions, multiple types of ear protection can be used together to increase the NRR. For example, foam earplugs can be worn in-conjunction with earmuffs. Electronic ear protection is available as earplugs or earmuffs. Electronic earplugs detect and amplify quiet sounds while blocking loud noises. Electronic earplugs are useful in several situations such as hunters or shooters who need to protect their ears from the loud report of a hunting rifle but still need to hear the noises around them. Electronic hearing protection allows the user to carry on a normal conversation or listen for game while still blocking out external noises that can damage hearing. Each type of ear protection has what is called a noise reduction rating (NRR). This gives the consumer an estimate of how much noise is being reduced before reaching the individual's ear. It is important for the consumer to know that this is only a single number estimate derived from a laboratory experiment, and the NRR will vary per individual wearing the hearing protection. NIOSH and OSHA have derating values to help give the person an idea of how much sound is being attenuated while wearing the hearing protection. OSHA uses a half derating, while NIOSH uses 70% for pre-formed earplugs, 50% for formable earplugs, and 25% for earmuffs.  Hunting and firearms  The shooting of guns for recreational use can lead to hearing loss in the high frequencies. The shooting of firearms can cause damage to a variety of cochlear structures due to the high peak sound pressure levels that they generate. This can range from 140 to 175 dB . Along with the passive noise reduction options usually used vocationally (such as earmuffs and earplugs) there are also active noise reduction devices available. Active noise reduction technology is used to provide noise protection like passive options, but also use circuitry to give audibility to sounds that are below a dangerous level (about 85 db) and try to limit the average output level to about 82 to 85 dB to keep the exposure at a safe level. Strategies to help protect your hearing from firearms also include using muzzle brakes and suppressors, shooting fewer rounds, and avoiding using a firearm with a short barrel. It is recommended to shoot outdoors or in a sound-treated environment and try to avoid an area that is not enclosed. has hard reflective surfaces, and has a group of shooters. If there is multiple to people it is best to make sure there is a large distance between the shooters and that they are not firing at the same time.

He was primarily known for his portraits of Hollywood celebrities, but many would contend that his finest works were of the things he loved most: his family, everyday items from his Long Island home and quiet countryside scenes. He received acclaim in the 1950s after several exhibitions, including a showing at the Smithsonian, but chose to protect his amateur status and to keep the paintings in his family. Many of his paintings are unsigned. Personal life Tucker was born to Bertha Hampton and William Tucker in Toronto, Canada, on November 2, 1894, and was the second of three sons. He joined the Royal Canadian Air Force and became a pilot and an officer but World War I ended before he was due to be sent to Europe. He moved to New York City and began working for Daniel Petigor, a lithographer. He later started his own lithography business, Spurgeon Tucker, Inc. The business was successful and he had Ford, Buick, White Rock Beverages, Chesterfield, Sunshine Biscuits, Bulova Watch and Borden Milk among his clients. His first marriage, in 1924, was to Lavinia Adelaide Young. In 1935, he married Petigor's daughter, Adlyn, and they had two daughters. In 1938, Tucker‚Äôs eldest daughter, Patricia, was featured in the Borden Milk billboards as the ‚ÄúBorden Baby.‚Äù He raised his family in 1185 Park Avenue in New York City and in Bay Shore, Long Island. In addition to art, he was passionate about baseball and his garden in Long Island. Tucker remained in New York City and enjoyed frequent trips to Long Island until his death from cancer in 1968. Exhibitions Tucker was a member of the Salmagundi Club, and many of his works were exhibited at Salamagundi shows. Tucker‚Äôs Geraniums was shown at The Smithsonian Institution, National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. as a part of the American Artists Professional League, American Art Week Exhibition in 1963. Tucker also exhibited at several shows in the New York City area. Paintings While mostly known for his celebrity portraits, the majority of Tucker‚Äôs paintings were quiet outdoor scenes, still lifes or family portraits. He often took day trips to the Catskill Mountains, Maine, or up and down Long Island and often pulled over to the side of the road when he saw a setting that moved him. He also painted many objects from his Long Island home, and portraits of his family at home and on vacations. Some of the items from the still lifes and the clothes from the portraits have been saved with the paintings. Celebrity portraits Spurgeon Tucker‚Äôs celebrity portraits include * Anne Jeffries (as Kate, in Kiss Me Kate), 1950 * Uta Hagen as Saint Joan (painting was reproduced on the cover of the large program during her Broadway run, and on the cover of the New York Times Sunday Magazine), 1951 * Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis to benefit the New York Heart Cardiac Fund, 1952 * Diana Barrymore (painting was reproduced on the book jacket of her book Too Much Too Soon and was displayed at the Museum of the City of New York), 1957 * B.

In 1999 Sea Containers acquired Express Navigation.Sea Containers sells SeaStreak Interferry March 18, 2008 The company was renamed SeaStreak. Following Sea Containers filing for bankruptcy in 2006, SeaStreak was sold to New England Fast Ferry in 2008. Vessels SeaStreak operates a fleet of eight diesel-powered double-hulled catamarans. The SeaStreak Highlands, SeaStreak Wall Street, SeaStreak New Jersey, and SeaStreak New York are all 141 foot vessels owned by SeaStreak; each has a capacity of 400 passengers and travels at a service speed of . The vessels were built by Gladding-Hearn Shipbuilding of Somerset, Massachusetts. The Ocean State is a 65-foot vessel owned by New England Fast Ferry; it has a capacity of 149 passengers and can travel up to . It is used as the ferry for the seasonal Providence to Newport route. The vessel was built by Merrifield-Roberts of Bristol. The Martha's Vineyard Express and \\"Whaling City Express\\" are 95-foot vessels owned by New England Fast Ferry and is operated by SeaStreak from September through May; it has a capacity of 149 passengers and can travel up to . The vessel was built by Derecktor Shipyards of Mamaroneck and is the sister ship of New England Fast Ferry's Whaling City Express. It operates between New Bedford and Martha's Vineyard during the summer months. Past vessels have included the SeaStreak Manhattan, the SeaStreak Brooklyn, and the SeaStreak Liberty, among a few others. All of these catamaran ferries were designed by Incat Crowther. SeaStreak announced construction of a 600-passenger high-speed luxury ferry in September 2016 for service between the Jersey Shore and Manhattan, anticipated to enter service in 2017. Construction took longer than planned, and the vessel, named SeaStreak Commodore, was launched in March 2018, with its entry into service the following month. Routes SeaStreak routes connect the towns of Atlantic Highlands and Highlands in Monmouth County, New Jersey with Pier 11 at Wall Street and the East 34th Street Ferry Landing on the East River in Manhattan. During the morning rush hour the trip from the Raritan Bayshore to Manhattan takes approximately 40 minutes and there is limited shuttle service to Battery Park City Ferry Terminal. From Memorial Day weekend through Labor Day weekend, service is also provided to the public beaches in Sandy Hook a few times each day. Service is also provided to Yankee Stadium for selected New York Yankees games and to Citi Field for New York Mets games on weekends. The company has long offered \\"special event cruises\\" such as sightseeing excursions, sunset cruises, and trips to Broadway matinees, college football games at West Point, the Macy's Fourth of July fireworks, the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, and to see the fall foliage in the Hudson Valley. On July 17, 2009, SeaStreak began providing weekend service between New York City and Martha's Vineyard. One ferry departs New York City on Friday afternoon and returns on Sunday night. The trip through Long Island Sound and along the shoreline of Rhode Island and Massachusetts takes a little over five hours. The service will continue through Labor Day weekend and was implemented following the success of a trial run held over the Fourth of July weekend. Before launching its service to Martha's Vineyard, SeaStreak had expressed an interest in providing a similar service on summer weekends to Sag Harbor in the Hamptons, but there were concerns over traffic and ferry service is a non- permitted use in the village code. =Hurricane Sandy service= After Hurricane Sandy in October 2012 destroyed much of the IND Rockaway Line (), severing most subway service between the Rockaway peninsula of Queens, SeaStreak began running a city-subsidized ferry service between a makeshift ferry slip at Beach 108th Street and Beach Channel Drive in Rockaway Park and Pier 11/Wall Street in Manhattan's Financial District, then continuing on to the East 34th Street Ferry Landing. In August 2013, a stop was added at Brooklyn Army Terminal in advance of the temporary closure of the Montague Street Tunnel () between Brooklyn and Manhattan. In December 2013, it was reported that since inception, the run between Rockaway and Manhattan had attracted an average of about 730 passengers per day, on top of the approximately 250 daily passengers traveling between Brooklyn and Manhattan. The ferry by that time had carried nearly 200,000 passengers since its inception, according to city officials. Originally intended as a stopgap alternative transportation measure only for the months until subway service was restored at the end of May in 2013, the ferry service proved to be popular with locals, and the city's contract with SeaStreak was initially extended until July 2013 and then was subsequently extended again, first till mid- October 2013 and then until January 2014. Community organizations, activists and elected officials in Rockaway and Brooklyn campaigned for a permanent extension of the subsidized service. Though full service on the Montague Street Tunnel was restored in mid-September 2014, many commuters continued to take the ferry, despite its extra $1 cost over the subway fare. In mid- October, Mayor Bill de Blasio visited Rockaway and declared that the time had come to end the ferry service, since all of the subway service that it had replaced was now back in operation. Despite efforts from other local officials, the ferry last ran on October 31, 2014, after SeaStreak was unsuccessful in procuring an extension of the service. Rockaway ferry service resumed on May 1, 2017 as part of the NYC Ferry service, which is operated by Hornblower Cruises. Accidents In October 2003, eight passengers were evacuated to Staten Island after a fire broke out aboard a ferry heading to the Raritan Bayshore. On January 9, 2013, at around 8:45 a.m., Seastreak Wall Street, arriving at Pier 11 from Atlantic Highlands, rammed into the mooring as it was docking, leaving a visible gash in the ferry stretching several feet above the water line. The president of the ferry company, James R. Barker, told NBC News that morning that there were 300 aboard and that many of those injured were thrown from their seats. The cause of the accident was not immediately clear. Eighty-five people were injured, two critically. According to the captain, the control system of the boathttp://www.maritimeaccidentattorney.com/blog/why-the-new-york-ferry- disaster-proves-the-jones-act-is-important.cfm failed to respond. Lawsuits seeking damages have been brought by injured passengers. As of May 16, 2013, the deadline for filing, thirty-seven claims had been made against the company. The case will be heard in admiralty court since the accident took place on navigable waters. In popular culture The ferry is seen during a romantic moment passing underneath the Brooklyn Bridge in the movie Step Up 3D. It is seen still operating in the year 2021 in the movie Click. A ferry is also seen moving down the East River in the final shot of the 2002 film Gangs of New York, in which the Brooklyn Bridge and the World Trade Center can be seen.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMZwd4c09xk In \\"New York Shark\\" , an online game where a shark destroys boats and aircraft, one of the larger SeaStreak vessels is featured.

The creation of thick ice sheets caused a global sea level drop of about glacial plucking and abrasion The glacial history of Minnesota is most defined since the onset of the last glacial period, which ended some 10,000 years ago. Within the last million years, most of the Midwestern United States and much of Canada were covered at one time or another with an ice sheet. This continental glacier had a profound effect on the surface features of the area over which it moved. Vast quantities of rock and soil were scraped from the glacial centers to its margins by slowly moving ice and redeposited as drift or till. Much of this drift was dumped into old preglacial river valleys, while some of it was heaped into belts of hills (terminal moraines) at the margin of the glacier. The chief result of glaciation has been the modification of the preglacial topography by the deposition of drift over the countryside. However, continental glaciers possess great power of erosion and may actually modify the preglacial land surface by scouring and abrading rather than by the deposition of the drift. The marks of glaciation vastly altered Minnesota's topography. Probably the most significant change was in the character and extent of the drainage. In preglacial times, there is reason to believe that most of the rainwater or meltwater from snow was quickly carried back to the ocean. Today, much of the precipitation is retained temporarily on the surface in the lakes. Streams meander from lake to lake, and only part of the total precipitation is carried away by the rivers. Such topography could be described as immature because the streams have not yet been able to establish themselves into a network that quickly and efficiently drains the land. The Mississippi River has cut a deep valley below St. Anthony Falls, but even the waters of this large river do not flow freely to the ocean because of Lake Pepin, which acts as a storage basin for some of the water. Streams have been actively engaged in their erosive work only for the last 10,000 years, the estimated length of time since the last glacier began its final retreat. This time span is relatively insignificant compared to the long history of the Earth. Sequence of glacial events Canadian Shield. Minnesota has been covered, at least in part, by a glacier numerous times during the Quaternary ice age. In order of increasing age, these advances took place during the Wisconsin Episode and Illinoian stages; prior to this continental ice sheets advanced into and retreated from Minnesota multiple times during the Pre- Illinoian Stage.Richmond, G.M. and D.S. Fullerton, 1986, Summation of Quaternary glaciations in the United States of America, Quaternary Science Reviews. vol. 5, pp. 183-196.Gibbard, P.L., S. Boreham, K.M. Cohen and A. Moscariello, 2007, Global chronostratigraphical correlation table for the last 2.7 million years v. 2007b, jpg version 844 KB. Subcommission on Quaternary Stratigraphy, Department of Geography, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, England The ice moved into Minnesota at different times from three glacial centers, the Labradorian center in northern Quebec and Labrador; the Patrician center, just southwest of Hudson Bay; and the Keewatin center, northwest of Hudson Bay. Deposits left by the continental ice sheets advancing from these three centers reflect the characteristics of the rocks over which they passed. The Keewatin ice encountered the Cretaceous limestones and shales of Manitoba and the Red River Valley, whereas the Patrician and Labradorian ice moved over iron-rich Pre-Cambrian crystalline rocks of the Canadian Shield. =Pre- Wisconsin Episode glaciation= There are few areas in which the earlier drifts from the glacial deposits of the Pre-Ilionian or Illinoian stages are exposed at the surface. The extreme southeastern and southwestern portions of Minnesota (Driftless Area) have extensive areas of pre-Wisconsin drifts, but they are masked almost everywhere by surficial covering of loess (wind-blown silt). Furthermore, these regions of older drift are maturely drained, because the streams have had a longer time to evolve into an efficient drainage system compared with the streams flowing in areas covered by younger glacial deposits. Howard Hobbs has proposed that the Pre-Illinoian glacial deposits in southeastern Minnesota are actually younger Illinoian glacial deposits.Hobbs, H.C., 2006a, The ‚ÄúPre-Illinoian‚Äù till of southeastern Minnesota may actually be Illinoian. Geological Society of America Abstracts with Programs. vol. 38, no. 4, p. 3Hobbes, H.C., 2006b, The ‚ÄúPre-Illinoian‚Äù till of southeastern Minnesota may actually be Illinoian. Power Point presentation for Hobbs (2006b). Minnesota Geological Survey, University of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN Changes in the course of continental rivers As the ice sheets moved into the central portion of North America, the rivers that used to flow from the Rocky Mountains to the northeast into the Arctic Ocean found their valleys choked with ice. The rivers had to divert around the farthest extensions of the ice. When the ice retreated, the new valleys eroded into the landscape kept the rivers from moving back to their old positions. Wisconsin Episode Glaciation The Wisconsin glacial episode, the most recent glacial period, has been subdivided into four substages, each representing an advance and retreat of the ice. The substages, named from the oldest to the youngest, are the Iowan, Tazewell, Cary and Mankato. Only the Iowan, Cary and Mankato are recognized in Minnesota, but studies indicate that the Tazewell drift may be present in southwestern Minnesota. The Iowan drift occurs extensively at the surface only in southwestern and southeastern Minnesota, and contains few, if any, lakes because of the relatively mature surface drainage. The Tazewell drift in the southwestern Minnesota is devoid of lakes; in fact, the criterion of drainage was used by Robert Ruhe to distinguish Tazewell from Cary drifts. Nearly all of the lakes in Minnesota are found within the borders of the Cary and Mankato drifts. For this reason, it is necessary to consider in some detail the nature and distribution of these two drift sheets. =Cary substage= The glaciers that advanced out of the northeastern portion of Canada were of sufficient thickness to produce significant erosion in northeastern Minnesota. Because the affected area reached somewhat south of Minneapolis, it is called the \\"Minneapolis lobe\\". The Minneapolis lobe is characteristically red and sandy because of red sandstone and shale source rocks to the north and northeast; it may be recognized as well by pebbles of basalt, gabbro, red syenite, felsite and iron formation from northeastern Minnesota. Ground moraine with uncharacteristic reddish iron-rich sediments extended from St. Cloud, Minnesota, back northeastward. The glaciers produced a set of terminal moraines which extend from northwest of St. Cloud into the Twin Cities and up into central Wisconsin. They deposited reddish sands and gravels westward and southward in outwash plains. =Mankato substage= With the retreat of the Patrician ice, the stage was set for the final phase of the Wisconsin Episode glaciation in Minnesota. The last major advance of the continental glacier in Minnesota culminated in a lobe that reached as far south as Des Moines, Iowa. The glacial movement from the northwest was from a more distant source than ice from the northwest. The subsequent glacier that moved into Minnesota was quite thin and unable to cause much erosion. The Des Moines lobe produced a northeast-moving projection known as the Grantsburg sublobe. Also protruding from the main Keewatin ice sheet was the St. Louis sublobe. The drift of these ice lobes is generally in late Wisconsin time. The sediment transported by the Mankato glacier is colored tan to buff and is clay-rich and calcareous because of shale and limestone source rocks to the northwest. The Superior lobe also developed during Mankato time and advanced as far west as Aitkin County, Minnesota. The Grantsburg sublobe effectively blocked the drainage of the Mississippi River from north of St. Cloud southeastward through the Twin Cities. The outwash carrying large quantities of sand was diverted overland to the east around the sublobe. No true drainage valley was produced; instead, multiple small streams flowed toward the northeast depositing their overloads of sand as they went. This produced a roughly triangular sandy outwash region called the Anoka Sand Plain, reaching from St. Cloud to the Twin Cities up to the northeast to Grantsburg, Wisconsin. Lake formation =Kettle lakes= Landscape produced by a receding glacier. As glaciers advanced and retreated through Minnesota, some of the ice that stagnated was more difficult to melt than other areas. The glaciers continued to deposit sediments around and sometimes on top of these isolated ice blocks. As the ice blocks melted, they left behind depressions in the landscape. The depressions filled with snowmelt and rainwater producing kettle lakes. Kettle lakes may be formed within the ground moraine region behind the terminal moraines. They can be of any size and their shorelines can be composed of anything from clay to sand to boulders. In a terminal moraine region, the kettles are fairly small but deep, to fit between the moraine's steep and hilly ridges. If the ice had advanced outward and then retreated leaving behind an outwash, kettles may have formed. Outwash kettle lakes are usually shallow and their numbers are much smaller than in other glaciated regions. The abundant sand quickly can fill in the depressions and composes most of the beaches of these lakes. Because Minnesota has had glacial movements into the state from both the northeast and northwest, the landscape has been modified by overlapping glacial regions. For example, an outwash plain from the Cary glacier may have a newer cover of ground moraine from the Mankato glacier, or a Cary ground moraine may have been subsequently covered over by Mankato outwash. The majority of lakes in the world are kettle lakes produced by glacial activity. In Minnesota, the majority of kettles lakes reside in ground moraine and terminal moraine areas. =Bedrock erosion lakes= In northeastern Minnesota, the glaciers were thousands of feet thick. As the glaciers moved through the area they eroded large quantities of rock away. Ice itself is not very abrasive, but by picking up and moving pieces of rock it was able to scrape away softer underlying materials. Volcanic rocks underlie the area. Along the Rove region of the Arrowhead Region, there are multiple tilted layers of volcanic rocks interspersed with layers of shale; the shalelayers are softer than the volcanic basalt. As the glaciers eroded the materials, the shales were removed. The topography in the Rove region alternates hills (composed of diabase) and valleys (former shale layers); these hills and valley orient in a west to east direction. Many of these valleys are now lakes. Because the lakes are oriented west-east, visitors to the Rove region think that the ice moved in an east-west direction. Glacial striations (scratches) show that the ice moved from north-to-south, perpendicular to the orientation of the lakebeds themselves. Adjacent to the Rove area Lake Superior's basin resides in a billion-year-old trough which was caused by the Midcontinent Rift. Preglacially the depression had been filled with eroded shales. The thousands of feet of glacial ice eroded away a large amount of the shale. The ice was so thick that it scoured the sandstone down to depths of below sea level. The present Lake Superior is the single largest freshwater lake in area in the world. =Glacial lakes= About 18,000 years ago, the Laurentide Ice Sheet began to melt and retreat. As the Mankato ice shrank meltwaters became ponded in several places along the margin of the glacier. Some of these lakes covered several hundred thousand square miles and have left a definite imprint on the topography. All of them have since been drained by natural force or have been shrunk considerably from their original size. Glacial Lake Duluth Glacial Lake Duluth Glacial Lake Duluth is the body of water that formed at the southwestern margin of the Superior lobe and occupied a much larger area than the present Lake Superior. Its shorelines stood nearly 148 meters above the level of its modern successor, Lake Superior. During its early history Lake Duluth drained into the Mississippi River down the St. Croix River Valley. There were two outlets, one along the Kettle and Nemadji Rivers in Minnesota and another to the east along the Bois Brule River in Wisconsin. Later, however, when the Superior lobe had retreated farther to the northeast, the waters of Lake Duluth merged with those in the Michigan and Huron basins, and the southern outlets were abandoned in favor of a lower one on the east end of Lake Superior. The Kettle River no longer drains Lake Superior, but resides in a large valley, which itself could not have produced with its present discharge. The Nemadji and Bois Brule Rivers actually flow northward toward Lake Superior through the eastern proglacial outlet. Even though vast amounts of water flowed over the southern rim of Lake Superior, the Bois Brule River outlet was never scoured deep enough to remove a continental divide at the Bois Brule River's headwaters. =Proglacial lakes= Glacial Lake Agassiz An early map of the extent of Lake Agassiz (by 19th century geologist Warren Upham). This map is now believed to underestimate the extent of the region once overlain by Lake Agassiz. The largest of all the proglacial lakes was Lake Agassiz, a small part of which occupied the present Red River Valley of Minnesota and North Dakota. Glaciers to the north blocked the natural northward drainage of the areas. As the ice melted, a proglacial lake developed southward of the ice. The water overflowed the continental divide at Browns Valley, Minnesota; drained through the Traverse Gap and cut the present Minnesota River valley. The amount of discharge was staggering. It helped the adjacent Mississippi River to form a very large valley in the southeastern Minnesota. The river that drained from Lake Agassiz is called the Glacial River Warren. It flowed over the top of a recessional moraine at Browns Valley. As the water eroded away the glacial deposits, the level in the lake dropped. Eventually enough large boulders were left behind that a boulder pavement was produced, which inhibited further downward cutting. The lake level was thus stabilized for a while. During the few decades when the level was constant, waves on the lake produced noticeable beaches along the shoreline. Glacial outwash was also being deposited on the bottom of the lake. Eventually the boulders at the lake outlet were eroded downstream and the river then could erode downward through a mix of sediment sizes. Again, a boulder pavement formed and, as before, the lake level stabilized at a lower level, again forming another set of beaches. After further retreat of the ice into Canada, lower outlets were uncovered to Hudson Bay, and the Minnesota Valley outlet was abandoned. The continental divide at Browns Valley become the headwaters for the north flowing Red River of the North and southeast flowing tributary of the Mississippi River, the Minnesota River. During its existence, Lake Agassiz may have been the largest freshwater lake to ever have existed. The lakebed composed of lake muds and silts is one of the flattest regions of Earth and is extremely fertile. No bedrock erosion lakes exist there because the ice was too thin to erode. No kettle lakes are found on the lakebed because lakebed deposits would have filled their depressions.

His efforts to organize and equip the army from scratch were seen as instrumental in helping Croatia survive the first year of the Croatian War of Independence. Partly due to disagreements with president Franjo Tuƒëman, he retired in 1992, after the war froze with the permanent ceasefire at the end of 1991.  Early life  Martin Spegelj was born 11 November 1927 in Stari Gradac, Pitomaƒça. He was a partisan soldier during World War II. Eventually, he rose to become General of the 5th Yugoslav Army (JNA) Army District based in Zagreb, Croatia. After the first free elections in Croatia, he was second Defence Minister. ≈†pegelj was one of the few in the top leadership of Croatia who saw the impending war as unavoidable. Together with the Slovenian command, ≈†pegelj formulated a joint defence plan in case either country was attacked by the JNA. At the same time he was smuggling weapons into Yugoslavia, arming paramilitary troops and organizing them for attacks on legitimate JNA forces.  ≈†pegelj Tapes  At the onset of the war in Croatia in mid-1990, the Croatian Serbs orchestrated an armed rebellion (known as the Log Revolution), refusing to accept Croatian government authority. As they were supported by the JNA (first covertly, then openly), Croatian forces were poorly armed, so ≈†pegelj undertook a campaign of acquiring arms through the black market community, importing weapons from former Warsaw Pact countries like Hungary and Romania. He was caught on tape in October 1990 talking to an assistant who was actually an undercover KOS operative. At the time, war in Croatia had not started yet. In the conversations, ≈†pegelj talks of arming Croatians in preparation for secession of Croatia and the impending civil war. The so- called ≈†pegelj tapes were turned into a documentary film by Zastava military film center, and aired in January 1991 to the larger Yugoslav public. They were made public in order to bolster the attack of the Belgrade government against the newly elected Croatian government. The Croatian leadership, including the main \\"actors\\" themselves, initially quickly dismissed the tapes as fake, claiming that the presumably innocuous videotaped conversations were subsequently dubbed. Their authenticity, however, was later confirmed by Stipe Mesiƒá, the president of Croatia, was one of the first on Croatian side who admitted that the tapes are authentic, although he claimed some of the sentences were taken out of context. Most of the tape has audio garbled and the text subtitled and read by a narrator, so the accuracy of the tape is in question. The JNA leadership in Belgrade wanted ≈†pegelj to face trial for treason for this. As a result of the affair, and to calm tensions, Tuƒëman dismissed him from his post. Fearing for his life, ≈†pegelj fled to Austria where he remained for several months.  Return to Croatia  Considering the rising tensions and the fall of first deaths of the impending war, ≈†pegelj was persuaded to return to Croatia to become the chief of staff of the new army that was in the process of forming. When the Slovenian War occurred in June 1991, ≈†pegelj advocated activating the joint defence plan, which would put Croatia into war against the JNA by attacking its army barracks in Croatia (≈†pegelj's plan). However, Tuƒëman feared confrontation and refused to support the Slovenes. ≈†pegelj was then made inspector-general of the Croatian army, replaced partly due to his disagreements with Tuƒëman. Only several months later, full-scale war broke out, and ≈†pegelj's plan for attacking JNA's army barracks in Croatia was implemented and resulted in the Battle of the Barracks, bringing much needed heavy weapons to Croatia. The war in Croatia entered a phase of lower intensity after the signing of a UN-brokered ceasefire at the start of the 1992. ≈†pegelj then officially retired.  Post- war and criticism  Following the war, ≈†pegelj became a fierce critic of Tuƒëman's politics, accusing him and his followers of war profiteering. In 2001, he published his autobiography in which he was very critical of the Tuƒëman's HDZ and its political maneuverings, which he argues needlessly escalated the war. He also accused them of supporting Bosnian Croat separatism which led to their conflict with the Bosniaks during the Bosnian War. ≈†pegelj was in turn criticized by pro-Tuƒëman elements of the Croatian military, notably Davor Domazet-Lo≈°o who considers that the June 1991 Slovenian War was just an excuse to draw Croatia into the conflict.

Smith, \\"Vertical and Horizontal-Base Position Finding Systems,\\" The Coast Defense Study Group Journal, Vol. 13, Issue 3, August, 1999. Once simultaneous bearings from each base end station to a target were taken, since the distance between the stations (the baseline) was known, the range to the target from either station could be calculated through triangulation. If the target's bearing from each station was sent to a plotting room and input to a plotting board, the position of the target could be estimated and firing coordinates for a gun battery could be calculated. Some base end stations were located in tall fire control towers (FCTs) Sometimes, the terms \\"base end station\\" and \\"fire control tower\\" were used interchangeably. In general, however, a fire control tower (FCT) was a structure built to raise one or more base end, spotting, or observation stations high above ground level. Some fire control towers contained several base end stations, one on top of another on different stories of the tower, with each station being at one end of a different baseline and being assigned primarily to a different gun battery in a harbor's defensive scheme. Other base end stations resembled pillboxes or small bunkers dug into the ground or on the surface overlooking coastal waters. Still others were camouflaged to resemble seaside homes or cottages. Some base end stations had anti-aircraft observation positions on their top levels, or harbor observation radar antennas on platforms above their roofs. =Typical equipment= Almost all base end stations were equipped at least with an azimuth telescope (similar to a surveyor's theodolite) to enable them to sight accurate bearings to a target. In addition, some base end stations held a depression position finder (DPF) or a coincidence range finder (CRF) that could be used by itself (without reference to another station) to produce fire control data for the gun(s). Sometimes a space holding one of these instruments (if not located on a baseline and paired with a second station) was referred to simply as an observation station. These stations were used between the 1890s and 1946. At the end of the war almost all of them were declared surplus and were sold off to public and private owners. More than 100 of these stations still survive today on the coasts of the United States, as part of state preserves or under private ownership, although many have been razed to clear sites for new development. Horizontal Base Systems In a horizontal base system (like that in the diagram above), two base end stations were located at precisely surveyed points, one at each end of a base line, or a line between them of known length and azimuth. At each of these stations was an observation instrument (such as an azimuth telescope or a depression position finder (DPF) capable of making a precise measurement of the bearing of a distant target (usually a ship) from the station. When the stations at each end of the baseline had made their measurements, they communicated these to a plotting room (or fire control center) which used an analog tracking device called a plotting board to locate the position of the target. Later in WW2, the target bearings could be input to an electro-mechanical gun data computer, which calculated the position of the target and the required adjustments for things like ballistic factors and the locations of the guns that were to be fired. Making this system work properly required the two base end stations to take bearings on the target at precisely the same time. To enable this, a bell or buzzer (called the time-interval bell) was rung automatically at fixed intervals (usually every 15 or 20 seconds) in all observing stations across a harbor defense system (note the dashed communications lines in the diagram above). One soldier, using the telescope or DPF, would track the target. At the sound of the bell, a second soldier would read the azimuth (at which the instrument was pointed) off a scale on the instrument and telephone this reading to the plotting room. Spotting Stations In WW2, each base end station was often combined with a spotting station. This meant that a second spotting instrument (usually an azimuth telescope) on a separate pedestal (or tripod) was included in the observing room, alongside the primary one (which was usually a depression position finder [DPF]). A Depression Position Finder (on the left) and an Azimuth Scope in the same base end station. While the primary observer (and perhaps the azimuth reader who assisted him) tracked the target, the role of the spotter was to observe the fall of fire from the guns of the supported battery, telephoning back to the plotting room whether the shells were falling short or over, left or right. In harbor defense plans and other documents, such as survey data sheets prepared by the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey (USCGS) and maintained by its successors,Sample data sheet for a base end station in Nahant, Massachusetts that was also a spotting station. these combined stations were often labeled according to the tactical numbers of the gun batteries they were designed primarily to serve and their number in the series of stations serving that battery. Thus a station marked B 4/2 S 4/2 referred to base end station #4 for battery #2 and spotting station #4 for battery #2. Vertical Base and Self-Contained Systems These systems used instruments such as the depression position finder (DPF) or the coincidence rangefinder (CRF) to measure the range and/or azimuth to the target. Either of these two types of range finding stations could function effectively by itself, measuring both range and bearing (azimuth) to the target, without the need for a second base end station (as with the horizontal base system). Using one of these position-finding systems, while not as accurate as using the horizontal base method, had certain advantages. Some examples Base end stations (also called observation stations) took a variety of forms. Some were multi-story fire control (FC) towers, either square or round in plan (or both), and rising from 20 to 100 feet above the ground. Some looked like forest fire watch towers. Others appeared to be small buildings, or were disguised as seaside cottages to camouflage their purpose. Still other base end stations resembled small pillboxes, dug into the ground, and usually positioned to look down on the channels they defended. Base end stations were often assigned to particular batteries of guns or mine fields in a harbor defense system. In some U.S. harbors during WW2 there were 20 or more of these base end stations, often from 10,000 to 15,000 yards apart, and tied together by telephone lines running through switchboards. These stations could be used flexibly in different combinations or by different gun batteries as ships moved through the area, or in case a given station was damaged by enemy action. =Fire Control Towers (FCTs)= {  Pt.

It is designed to improve belay safety for the climber by allowing the belayer to manage their duties with minimal physical effort. With the right belay device, a small, weak climber can easily arrest the fall of a much heavier partner. Belay devices act as a friction brake, so that when a climber falls with any slack in the rope, the fall is brought to a stop. Typically, when the rope is held outward, away from the body, it moves relatively freely, so the belayer can take up or pay out slack. When the rope is brought backward, to the side of the body, the rope is forced into tight bends and rubs against the device and/or against itself, allowing the belayer to arrest the descent of a climber in the case of a fall. This rubbing slows the rope, but also generates heat. Some types of belay devices can arrest a fall without the belayer taking any action, while others require the belayer to hold or pull the rope in a particular direction. Belay devices usually attach to the harness of the belayer via a carabiner, and are usually made of aluminium or an alloy. Some belay devices can also be used as descenders for a controlled descent on a rope, that is abseiling or rappeling. Many belay devices can be used to control either one rope, or two ropes in parallel. There are many reasons why the two-rope option might be chosen by a climber, including the consideration of reducing rope drag. There are also auto-belay devices on the market which allow a climber to climb solo in his or her climbing gym.  Types of belay devices  =Aperture= This is a device that you feed a bight (loop) of rope through a hole or aperture and then hook it into a locking carabiner on the harness. Sticht plate Sticht plate. The Sticht plate was the first mechanical rope brake, named after its designer, Fritz Sticht. It consists of a small metal plate with a slot that allows a bight of rope to pass through to a locking carabiner and back out. This locking carabiner is clipped to the belayer who is then able to lock the rope at will. Some plates had two slots for double ropes. The slots could also be different sizes for different diameter ropes e.g. 9mm and 11mm. A wide wire spring may be attached on one side to help keep the plate away from the brake carabiner to ease feeding and taking in rope. A smaller hole is often present for accessory cord to carry the device. Sticht plates are typically forged from aluminium alloy in a round disc shape, although other shapes such as rounded rectangles were also made. Although any belaying plate with one or two slots is often called a Sticht plate, Fritz Sticht originally patented the design with Hermann Huber for Salewa GmbH in 1970, who sold it as the Salewa Sticht Bremse (Sticht Brake). Sticht plates have become less popular since more modern designs provide smoother control over the rope and are less prone to jamming, especially when doubling as a descender. Tubular devices This type of device generally has a tubular or rectangular shape. It is an evolution of the Sticht plate's concept by creating more surface area to dissipate heat and the ability to create sharper angles which creates a stronger degree of friction which has greater stopping power. As a result, this is generally the most common type of belay device used. Besides arresting the fall of a climber, these devices can also be used for rappelling. Petzl Reverso 4 Figure eight A figure-eight descender. Sometimes just called an \\"eight\\", this device is most commonly used as a descender. A figure eight can be used for belaying, and indeed there are some which are designed specifically for belaying, however they are not generally popular due to the tendency to twist the rope. There are also variations on this design including DMM's \\"cardiac arrester\\" which does the same thing but is shaped like a heart. It is designed to help stop rope twisting. Figure eights, although not the most common belay device, are still frequently found in use. For most uses, a tubular style belay device is easier and safer to use. However, due to their tendency to twist rope and general disagreement about their safety, figure eights are often banned in climbing gyms. =Assisted braking= Under the right conditions, assisted braking devices use a sudden load on the rope to engage a camming mechanism (known as active, or mechanically assisted braking devices) or pull the belay carabiner into a pinch point (known as passive, or geometrically assisted braking devices) to prevent the rope from passing through the belay device. The terms \\"self-\\" or \\"auto-locking\\" are discouraged, because it is recommended to always keep the brake hand on the rope. There do exist rare conditions where these devices' braking functions may not apply correctly, though accident statistics show that these incidents are often user-error. An icy, muddy, worn, too-thin of a rope, or possibly other conditions, such as insufficient training and experience, may affect a device's braking function. Guide plate A Guide Plate, also known as an auto-blocking belay device, is a metal plate with an elongated slot for the bight to go through and then a carabiner is attached so that when pull from the climber occurs the carabiner will be pulled to lock off the device. Tubular device variant Petzl Reverso. A similar device to the traditional tubular belay device which has two extra loops; normally situated on the front and back of the device. When the device is attached directly to an anchor point with the use of a second carabiner through the larger of the two loops it performs a similar stopping function to that created with the guide plate. The device is also able to be used as a standard tubular device when belaying from the harness. Grigri Petzl Grigri Statistically, by sales volume, the Grigri is the most popular mechanically assisted braking belay device. A Grigri, when properly used, assists in braking the rope with a camming device that clamps the rope in the event of a fall. Because of the braking mechanism, modified belay techniques are widely used, though Petzl, the device's manufacturer, has approved only certain techniques for instructing new belayers. Grigris reportedly give a harder catch than a regular belay device because they allow little to no rope slippage when catching a fall. On the upside, this is offset by the fact that the person being belayed falls a shorter distance. They are a proprietary design by Petzl. The original Grigri is rated for 10 to 11 mm single ropes, while the newer, smaller Grigri 2 is rated for 8.9 to 11 mm single ropes and optimized for 9.4 to 10.3 mm ropes.Description of GRIGRI-2 at petzl.com Trango sells a similar assisted braking belay device called the Cinch that is rated to work on ropes 9.4 to 11 mm. Using a Grigri to bring up a second on a traditional anchor is however less favorable than other belay devices because the Grigri gives a more static catch with little to no rope slippage. This increases the amount of force exerted on the anchor which, in turn, increases the chance of anchor failure. Revo Wild Country (Oberalp) Revo. The Revo combines the easy and dynamic handling of a tuber with the backup by a centrifugal brake. Paying out and taking in rope works fluently without resistance. Only when the rope rushes with a faster speed than 4 metre/second through the device, it arrests within a few centimetres. =Self-belay devices= \\"Silent Partner\\" self-belay device. Self-belay devices are designed to allow solo climbing where the climber wears the belay device, or secures it to a fixed object on the ground. These devices automatically lock without any intervention when the rope passing through reaches a sufficient velocity (during a fall), but allow rope to move relatively freely whilst climbing. =Auto-belay devices= Auto-belay devices allow climbers to practice without a second person for belaying. These devices usually hang on or are attached to an artificially made climbing wall. There are several different types of auto- belay device, including ones that run on hydraulics, magnetic braking technology, centrifugal force, and friction.

Krockow studied sociology, philosophy and law at the University of G√∂ttingen in 1947-54, where he earned his doctoral degree, and the University of Durham, England. In 1961-69 he was a professor of political science at the universities of G√∂ttingen, Saarbr√ºcken and Frankfurt. In 1970-73 he served as a founding regent of the University of Oldenburg, which in 1995 named him an honorary professor. He was named professor emeritus by the University of G√∂ttingen in 1981. After resigning from his tenured position, he moved to Nikolausberg near G√∂ttingen, where he made a name and a living as an independent writer and speaker. He also worked as speechwriter and political advisor to Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and the Dutch royal family. Towards the end of his life, he moved to Hamburg, where he continued to publish books and articles, albeit living in near seclusion. Krockow received several German literary prizes. His biographies of Frederick the Great, Kaiser Wilhelm II and the resistance fighter Claus Schenk von Stauffenberg, who attempted to assassinate Hitler on July 20, 1944, won wide readership. His book Stunde der Frauen (Hour of the Women), which he wrote with his sister Libussa Fritz-Krockow, describes her ordeal fleeing Pomerania in 1945. When Germany collapsed, it was the hour of the German women, who rebuilt Germany from its ruins. The book remained a national bestseller for almost a decade and ushered in a period in which Germans began to rethink the immediate post-war period and come to terms with the loss of Pomerania, East Prussia, and Silesia. The book was translated into Polish, French, English, and Japanese. Krockow died on March 13, 2002, in Hamburg, aged 74. He was buried at Ohlsdorf cemetery in Ohlsdorf. Of his native region, lost to Germany with the border changes of 1945 and the Expulsion of Germans after World War II, Krockow wrote: :‚Äî Christian Graf von Krockow: Die Reise nach Pommern: Bericht aus einem verschwiegenen Land. :Deutscher Taschenbuch Verlag, Munich, 1985. .

It is a variation on \\"Someday Baby Blues\\", recorded by Sleepy John Estes in 1935. The song was a hit in 1956, reaching number seven in the Billboard R&B; chart. The Allman Brothers Band further popularized the song with recordings in the late 1960s and 1970s. Background Several blues musicians have interpreted and recorded variations on \\"Some Baby Blues\\". \\"Muddy Waters calls his 'Trouble No More' and Big Maceo titled his 'Worried Life Blues'. Be that as it may... they all derive from Sleepy John Estes' 1935 classic 'Someday Baby Blues'.\\"Liner notes, Mississippi Fred McDowell Live in New York, Oblivion Records OD-1, (2nd. edition 1973). As he did with \\"Rollin' Stone\\", \\"Rollin' and Tumblin'\\", \\"Walkin' Blues\\", and \\"Baby Please Don't Go\\", Muddy Waters took an older country blues and made it into a Chicago blues. Waters also modified the lyrics, using \\"Someday baby, you ain't gonna trouble, poor me anymore\\" instead of Estes' \\"Someday baby, you ain't gonna worry, my mind anymore\\" (Estes' 1938 version \\"New Someday Baby\\" uses \\"trouble\\" in place of \\"worry;\\" Bob Dylan's 2006 \\"Someday Baby\\" uses \\"trouble, poor me anymore\\"). Backing Waters were Jimmy Rogers on electric guitar, Little Walter on amplified harmonica, Otis Spann on piano, Willie Dixon on bass, and Francis Clay on drums. Sometimes known as the \\"Headhunters\\", a loose group of fellow Chess recording artists, they were instrumental in defining Chicago blues.

By the age of 16 he was working in the copper works, but was dismissed after leading a strike. He then became an apprentice boilermaker, while attending evening classes. In 1889 he married Elizabeth Colwill, and the couple had five children. Williams was involved in trade union activities and Labour politics from a young age. In 1898 he became the first Independent Labour Party councillor elected to Swansea Town Council, becoming an alderman in 1904 and was mayor of Swansea in 1912-1913. He received the freedom of Swansea in 1924. He was the first chairman of the Swansea Co-operative Society when it was formed in 1900. He unsuccessfully contested the parliamentary constituency of Swansea East at the 1918 general election. When the Coalition Liberal MP Thomas Jeremiah Williams died the following year, he stood in the resulting by-election, cutting the Liberal majority. He won the seat at the 1922 general election, and held it until he resigned from the House of Commons on 26 January 1940 due to ill health. He died a year later, aged 75.

It opened in 1962 to serve the expanding west-side neighborhoods of Beaumont. In 1982, by order of federal district judge Robert Parker, it was merged with Hebert to form West Brook Senior High School in order to achieve racial integration in the district. South Park was also subsequently merged into West Brook, which now occupies the former Forest Park campus. History Forest Park High School opened in 1962 to serve the expanding west end of Beaumont; six years later the wealthy school district replaced the campus. It and South Park High School were almost entirely white; in 1968, 3% of Forest Park's students were black, and in 1976, after a first federal order for the district to desegregate, 2%. Hebert High School, founded as a school for blacks, was entirely black in 1968 and had one white student in 1976. In 1982 federal judge Robert Parker mandated the merger of Forest Park and Hebert into a single integrated school, which students voted to name West Brook; initially the Hebert campus housed the ninth and tenth grades, the Forest Park campus, the eleventh and twelfth. West Brook now operates entirely on the former Forest Park campus. Traditions The school colors of Forest Park were blue and grey and the mascot was the Trojans. The bigger than life-size Trojan figure carried around to rally fans was named Egor.(King Harrell)1980 Trojan (school year book), p. 64. The dance team was called the Trojanns. The Trojan Band, the cheerleaders, the twirlers, and the flags performed during sport events. Other traditions included Junior-Senior Prom, Senior Prom, Twirp Week & Dance, the Winter Ball, the Powder Puff football game, the Annual Play, Homecoming bonfire & dance, Trojan Games Day, and Skip Day. The school paper was called Populi Verbum. One tradition from 1977 to 1980 was to yell the name \\"Sommers!\\" whenever the lights were dimmed for school assemblies. Another tradition was for Mark Fiorenza and the Senior Athletics Supporting Association, or SASA, to lead colorful cheers at basketball games. Nederland was especially fond of this tradition, they even invited a co-founder of SASA to visit their school and thank him for the previous game's hospitality at Trojan Gym. The \\"Field\\" was a popular place to relax and enjoy a Serv-o-mation coke and a bag of Nacho-flavored Doritos during the lunch hour. Another tradition was to trick \\"Big Bird\\" and sneak into the lunch line as she though she was preventing people from cutting in line. Ninth-grade students were called Fish and were said to be adept at rolling peas across the cafeteria floor with their noses.1980 Trojan, pp. 8‚Äì35, 40‚Äì51, 54, 55, 60, 61, 64, 65, 75. Athletics =Football= In the 1970s, the Trojans played in District 21-4A. Member schools in the 1970s were Beaumont-Charlton Pollard High School, French High School, Forest Park, Nederland High School, Lincoln High School, Thomas Jefferson High School, Port Neches-Groves High School, Vidor High School, and West Orange-Stark High School.1980 Trojan, p. 101. From 1920 to the present, teams from the schools which made up this district in the 1970s played in 15 state championship games and won 7 times, including the 1975 Port Neches-Groves Indians and the 1984 Beaumont French Buffaloes. In 1980 the Port Arthur Thomas Jefferson Yellow Jackets (now Port Arthur Memorial Titans) suffered a hard-fought loss in the State Championship game. All three of these games were against the Odessa Permian Panthers, another school from a Texas Oil Patch. Forest Park did not win a 22-4A district championship in football but came close in 1979 with a record of 7 wins and 3 losses. 1979 was the first season the Trojans defeated the legendary Texas powerhouse program of the Port Neches - Groves Indians.1980 Trojan, p. 99. The Summer 1979 prediction for this district in Texas Football Magazine stated, \\"It was a strange year in 22-AAAA last season - Port Neches-Grove did NOT win the district, Vidor did. Now that the monopoly has been broken, several schools - West Orange-Stark in particular - seem intent on making sure it remains broken. But, Vidor won't yield its crown without a struggle, and Forest Park has the people to stir up the dust, too.\\" Summer 1979 Dave Campbells Texas Football magazine, page 205 Returning starters named in the Forest Park paragraph following were quarterback Jay Burton and running back Trey Barclay on offense and Casey Bobb, Tommy Osborne and Dimitri Geeker on defense.

It is one of the largest biochemistry departments in Europe. The Biochemistry Department is part of the University of Oxford's Medical Sciences Division, the largest of the University's four academic divisions, which has been ranked first in the world for biomedicine. History The old biochemistry Rudolf Peters Building, demolished in 2006 The Department of Biochemistry at Oxford University began as the physiological chemistry section of the Physiology Department, and acquired its own separate department and building in the 1920s. In 1920, Benjamin Moore was elected to the position of the Whitley Professor of Biochemistry, the newly established Chair of Biochemistry at Oxford University. He was followed by Rudolph Peters in 1923, and an endowment of ¬£75,000 was soon granted by the Rockefeller Foundation for the construction of a new departmental building, purchase of its equipment, and its maintenance. The Biochemistry Department building opened in 1927. The New Biochemistry Building In 1954, Hans Krebs was appointed the Whitley Chair of Biochemistry, and his appointment brought greater prominence to the department. He brought with him the Medical Research Council unit established to conduct research on cell metabolism. In 1955, a second professorship in the department, the Iveagh Chair of Microbiology, was established with funding from Guinness and the sub-department of Microbiology created, with Donald Woods its first holder. The eight-storey Hans Krebs Building was constructed in 1964 with funds from the Rockefeller Foundation. Krebs was succeeded by Rodney Porter in 1967. Genetics was brought into the Biochemistry Department when Walter Bodmer was appointed the first Professor of Genetics in 1970. The Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics, first established in the Zoology Department with support from Krebs and also linked to the Physical Chemistry Laboratory of the Chemistry Department, became part of the Biochemistry Department. It moved into the Rex Richards building built in 1984, with David Phillips the Professor in Molecular Biophysics. The Oxford Glycobiology Institute, headed by Raymond Dwek and housed in the Rodney Porter Building, opened in 1991. The department is now part of the Medical Sciences Division of Oxford University, under the Divisional Boards formed in 2000. In 2006, two older biochemistry buildings were demolished, and another two including the Han Krebs Tower in 2014, to make way for the two-phase construction of the New Biochemistry Building. Francis Barr, the EP Abraham Professor of Mechanistic Cell Biology, is the head of the Biochemistry Department, replacing Mark Sansom, the David Phillips Professor in Molecular Biophysics, in January 2019. Research The department is sub-divided into the following research areas: *Cell Biology, Development and Genetics *Chromosomal and RNA Biology *Infection and Disease Processes *Microbiology and Systems Biology *Structural Biology and Molecular Biophysics Academic staff There are around 400 research staff, with about 50 independent Principal Investigators who lead research groups that may range from a few people to forty or more. Members of other departments also contribute to teaching, including lecturers in physiology, pathology, pharmacology, clinical biochemistry and zoology. The Department hosts the Oxford University Biochemical Society, a graduate student association that invites speakers to the University of Oxford. The head of department is Professor Francis Barr. Other members of the academic staff include Judy Armitage, Elspeth Garman, Jonathan Hodgkin, Kim Nasmyth, Rob Klose and Alison Woollard. Buildings The department currently has three main buildings: * The New Biochemistry building * The Rex Richards building (housing the NMR facility in the basement) * The Rodney Porter building (Glycobiology) Until 2006, two older buildings housing genetics (the Walter Bodmer building) and biochemistry (the Rudolph Peters building) were also part of the department. However, these were demolished in 2006 to make way for the first phase of the construction of the New Biochemistry building, completed in October 2008. Until 2008 biochemistry also occupied the Donald Woods building and the Hans Krebs Tower, which was demolished in 2014 for the second phase of the construction. The New Biochemistry building houses interdisciplinary research in the Biosciences including Physiology, Chemistry, Biochemistry, and Clinical Neurosciences. The Department moved into the purpose-built new biochemistry building during the Autumn of 2008 which was designed to promote interaction and collaboration as well as provide facilities for all staff. The New Biochemistry building houses a substantial amount of contemporary art. ;Former departmental buildings Image:Hans Krebs Building, Oxford.jpgHans Krebs Tower, demolished 2014 Image:Walter Bodmer Building, Oxford.jpgWalter Bodmer Building, demolished 2006 Image:Biochemistry Department, looking towards South Parks Road 2006.jpgDonald Woods Building to the right, demolished 2014 References External links * Department of Biochemistry website * Map of the Science Area (see buildings 2‚Äì7) * Saltbridges website * Medical Sciences Division website * University of Oxford website * Oxford University Biochemical Society Biochemistry Category:Biochemistry research institutes Category:Research institutes in Oxford ","title":"Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford"},{"id":"9491427","title":"Vanessa Zima"},{"id":"9491429","text":"TGU may refer to: * Transglobal Underground, a London-based music collective * Toncont√≠n International Airport (IATA code: TGU), an international airport in Tegucigalpa, Honduras * –¢–∞—Ä—Ç—É—Å–∫–∏–π –≥–æ—Å—É–¥–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π —É–Ω–∏–≤–µ—Ä—Å–∏—Ç–µ—Ç (Tartuskiy gosud√°rstvennyy universit√©t) - Tartu State University, former name of the University of Tartu ","title":"TGU"},{"id":"9491490","text":"The YRT Special Constable Services is the security section of the York Region Transit (YRT) and Viva transit system in York Region, Ontario, Canada.

He is descended from William Blaxton, an early settler of New England. He worked in the railroad industry for most of his life after dropping out of school. At the time of his death, his estate was worth US$6 million ($ million today). Blackstone served as president of the Chicago and Alton Railroad from 1864 through 1899, was a founding president of the Union Stock Yards, and served one term as mayor of La Salle, Illinois. He was the benefactor of the James Blackstone Memorial Library in Branford, Connecticut, and his widow donated the Blackstone Memorial Library to the Chicago Public Library in 1902, the first dedicated branch of the Chicago Public Library system. The Blackstones also funded Blackstone Hall for the Art Institute of Chicago Building, and his mansion became the site of the Blackstone Hotel and the Blackstone Theatre. Early life Blackstone was born in Branford, Connecticut, the sixth child, and fourth son, of James Blackstone and Sarah Beach. His father, James, served in the Connecticut Senate representing the sixth district. James had also served in the Connecticut House of Representatives and the Connecticut militia. The family is descended from William Blaxton, an English settler who arrived in New England in the seventeenth century and became the first European settler in Rhode Island.Ida Hinman. \\"Biography of Timothy B. Blackstone.\\" Methodist Book Concern Press, 1917. William Blackstone, an English judge and jurist, is a distant cousin. Health issues caused Blackstone to drop out of school in 1847, and he began working for Roswell B. Mason, surveying the New York and New Haven Railroad (NY&NH;). He only worked on the NY&NH; for a year before becoming an assistant engineer on the Stockbridge and Pittsfield Railroad. Again, he only remained with the firm a short time before leaving for the Vermont Valley Railroad. In 1851, Roswell invited Blackstone to supervise construction of the Illinois Central Railroad between Bloomington and Dixon, Illinois. Blackstone accepted the job and moved to La Salle, Illinois. Career and life  Blackstone was elected mayor of LaSalle in 1854 and served a single term, his only foray into politics. After leaving office, he returned to working on railroads, first as chief engineer of the Joliet and Chicago Railroad, which would eventually become the Chicago and Alton Railroad. Blackstone became president of the Joliet and Chicago Railroad in 1861, and he kept the line solvent while other divisions were filing for bankruptcy. When the system was reorganized, he was named president of the board of directors for the company, serving with John Drake.Berger, Miles L., They Built Chicago: Entrepreneurs Who Shaped a Great City's Architecture, Bonus Books, Inc., Chicago, 1992, p. 155., . Although Blackstone served with the Alton Railroad for more than a quarter century, he refused a salary. When the directors voted to pay him $10,000 per year, he turned it down. In addition to his employment and activities with the railroads, Blackstone was the first president of the company that controlled the Union Stock Yards.Peggy Sullivan, \\"Naming the Branches,\\" Journal of the Caxton Club, June 2006, p.1. Although Blackstone had refused a salary from the railroad, he was an investor in it. In 1899, a competing group of investors headed by E. H. Harriman wanted to purchase the Alton Railroad but Blackstone disapproved of the sale. After many months of wrangling, Blackstone transferred all of his stock in the company to the United States Trust Company and resigned as president, effective April 1, 1899. This action allowed the Harriman-led group to assume control of the line. In 1868, Blackstone married Isabella Farnsworth Norton, the daughter of a successful businessman from Norwich, Connecticut. Blackstone died of pneumonia on May 26, 1900, in Chicago, Illinois. His funeral was held at the Second Presbyterian Church and was then transported to Norwich, Connecticut for burial. Blackstone Mansion Blackstone built a 19th-century mansion for himself at 252 Michigan Avenue in Chicago in what is now the Historic Michigan Boulevard District. The property later became the site of the Blackstone Hotel and the Blackstone Theatre. Following the Great Chicago Fire in 1871, he invited his friend John Crerar to stay with him, which Crerar did for twelve years. Crerar donated the John Crerar Library and Blackstone continued to donate funds toward the maintenance of the building throughout his life. The Crerar Library has now merged with the University of Chicago.

The place is located on bronze railings. Blackstone donated a library of 5,000 books and a building to the city of Branford, Connecticut with the only stipulation that it be named in honor of his father. A charter was devised for the library by the Connecticut State Legislature vesting control of the library in a self-perpetuating board of trustees consisting of six residents of Branford and the librarian of Yale University. The building was designed by Chicago architect Solon Spencer Beman. The library was constructed from 1893-96. In 1904, Isabella Blackstone donated the T.B. Blackstone Memorial Branch Library to the city of Chicago. Located at the intersection of Blackstone Avenue, Lake Park Avenue, and Forty-Ninth Street, the library is modeled after the James Blackstone Library in Branford, Connecticut. Blackstone Avenue running along the 1436 east block from 4900 south (starting behind Blackstone Library) to 10350 south is named after him.Hayner, Don and Tom McNamee, Streetwise Chicago, \\"Blackstone Avenue\\", p. 12, Loyola University Press, 1988, Also, the Blackstone's funded Blackstone Hall in the Art Institute of Chicago Building. The two-story ground level gallery was added next to the east wall of the original building for display of architectural and sculptural casts. The New York Times published details of his will. When Blackstone died, his will directed the disposition of his assets that amounted to US$6 million ($ million today). Of that total, $375,000 was bequeathed to relatives and $250,000 to public institutions (Chicago Art Institute, Chicago Orphan Asylum, Home for the Friendless at Chicago, St. Luke's Hospital, Passavant Memorial Hospital, Chicago Relief and Aid Society, $25,000 each and James Blackstone Memorial Library Association, $100,000).

In geology, a slickenside is a smoothly polished surface caused by frictional movement between rocks along the two sides of a fault. This surface is normally striated in the direction of movement. The plane may be coated by mineral fibres that grew during the fault movement, known as slickenfibres, which also show the direction of displacement. Due to irregularities in the fault plane exposed slickenfibres typically have a stepped appearance that can be used to determine the sense of movement across the fault. The surface feels smoother when the hand is moved in the same direction that the eroded side of the fault moved (see diagram for explanation), as the surface steps down in that direction, like the scales on a fish when stroked from the head.

History  According to Strabo, the Tectosages came originally from the region around Tolosa in Gaul, where they had been part of the tribal confederation of the Volcae. During the Gallic invasion of the Balkans, c. 280 BC, a branch of the Volcae Tectosages, returning from Delphi, split from the main group and joined two other tribes, the Tolistobogii and the Trocmi. Around 278 BC they were hired as mercenaries by Nicomedes I of Bithynia and crossed the Bosporus. After leaving Bithynia they raided in Asia Minor and finally settled in eastern Phrygia, where they established a new Celtic confederate identity as the Galatians. The Tectosages occupied the centre of the Galatian territory, round their capital Ancyra, with the Tolistobogii in the west and the Trocmii to the east.

His creative career grew largely out of his ability to express the emotion in the indie, hardcore, and metal scenes of the mid-1990s. From concert posters to politically charged fine art pieces, Cleveland-based artist Derek Hess has tested the waters of both the music and art world for over 15 years. Hess began creating promotional flyers for shows in Cleveland using his own unique vision and a tendency to playing off the band's names and genres. These flyers soon garnered the attention of countless bands as well as both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Louvre in Paris, who both have Hess' art in their permanent collections. In addition to posters for bands such as Deftones, Thursday, Clutch, and Pearl Jam, Hess has created CD covers for bands like Sepultura, Motion City Soundtrack, Converge, and Unearth. He has also been featured on television shows and in magazines including TLC, Food Network, MTV, Fuse, VH1, Alternative Press as well as many others.  Early life and education  Derek Hess was influenced by his father, a World War II veteran and Industrial Design professor at the Cleveland Institute of Art. Hess stated on his website that he remembers asking his father to draw the war scenes that he experienced. From a young age, Hess was transfixed by his father Roy's ability to create images of planes and tanks he saw in his mind's eye on the paper. Alongside his father's artistic ability, Hess also inherited his desire to make a living from art. Beginning his career as a student at the ClA, Hess later transferred to College for Creative Studies in Detroit to focus on graphic design and illustration before settling in on a major in fine art and printmaking. He finished his degree at CIA in their critically acclaimed printmaking program.  Techniques  Hess says one of his biggest artistic influences is Gil Kane's \\"forced perspective\\" technique that his father introduced him to. Forced perspective is an art technique that creates an optical illusion making an object appear farther away, closer, larger or smaller than it actually is by making it larger than the rest of the image. This artistic technique was so influential to his style, it became the title of his documentary, Forced Perspective which was released in 2016. Another of Gil Kane's techniques called \\"window boxing\\" has also been very influential in Hess' art. Window boxing is a technique where a figure appears to break out of the frame to make it appear larger than life. This technique can be seen in many of Hess' early Euclid Tavern concert posters.Roddy, Bridget. 2016. Hess' technical understanding of human anatomy and fine art education set him apart from other artists of his time. Hess had several instructors, including his father, who were veterans of WWII. These early drawing instructors instilled a tough work ethic in Hess. Learning anatomy as a fundamental of art began falling out of fashion with the invention of the camera. When artists no longer had to draw recreations of realistic life, they were free to explore different types of drawing and expression. Hess had an intuitive ability to draw and understand the human body but says that he needed instruction and direction: \\"I intuitively knew how to look and I understood to draw, it came naturally, but that was a problem in my early days. I 'knew better' than everyone else‚Äîand I was an out of control drunk maniac kid. I was a lot of trouble‚Äîbut I would go to class and I'd look at other kids' drawings and think 'Yeah, I got you all beat, I'll see you in five weeks!'\\", he said in his documentary. Although the ability to draw has always come easy for him, the process takes practice, \\"For years and years, I would just flip pages in sketchbooks and draw, draw, draw until something came out. That's a good way to approach it, I think.\\" Talking about his artistic process, he explained that it doesn't always come out the way he wants or expects it to the first time, \\"Once I let go of the struggle and start sketching, it starts to come out. It'll never be completely pure, there are always filters that go through you. If you're tuned in, you can feel if it's flowing. There's something that we all tune in to, and we can be connected to it. It's a choice.\\"  Career  = The Euclid Tavern and beginnings as a poster artist = After returning to Cleveland, Hess got a job at a bar he frequented while living in Cleveland, the Euclid Tavern. Described by Hess as a \\"workingman's shot-and-a-beer-bar\\", the Euclid Tavern was known as being a hub for local and underground music. Here, Hess chopped chicken wings and took charge of booking bands. He soon began to curtail the kinds of the bands being brought to the tavern into something he liked and was comfortable with. He also started creating the promotional flyers and posters for the shows using his own unique vision and a play off the bands' names and genres. These flyers were the very beginning of Derek's career as an artist. The first time Hess' work was recognized in collaboration with a musician was with the alternative metal band Helmet. The flyers and posters Hess created were the first in a series that were posted all over the area. The posters interested local art dealer William Busta, who then showed the flyers in his gallery. When Hess began using color graphics in his posters he received much more recognition and was featured in Newsweek magazine, in an article on new poster artists of 1994. = Fine art = Because of Hess' success as a poster artist, he had a built-in fan base when he wanted to make the jump back into fine art. Hess has been able to cultivate a large and expansive fan-base because of his wide appeal across genres. There are people who love his art because of its ties to music. Meanwhile, there are people who have never heard of the bands he has done work for that appreciate his fine art. Hess' aptitude to convey his work through this showcase of fundamentals has helped elevate him from a poster artist to a skilled fine- artist utilizing pen and ink, acrylic paint, and silkscreen prints with handmade separations. \\"I actually do very little poster art anymore, if any,\\" Hess said. \\"I've been able to develop and mature as an artist and I'm lucky that people have been very accepting of the progression.\\" Hess' art has been able to transcend genres as well as generations, which is icing on the cake for the artist. \\"At the end of the day I'd like, ideally, for all of my art to be technically sound and that hopefully connects with people. That, to me, is what makes successful art.\\" = Strhess music festivals and clothing line = Hess' music festivals, Strhess Fests and Strhess Tours, both in the United States and abroad made a huge impact in the hardcore and metal scenes in the early 2000s. These shows were a collaboration of music and art that featured bands such as Thursday, Shadow's Fall, Stretch Arm Strong, and Taking Back Sunday. The first Strhess Fest was in 2003 in Austin, Texas during South by Southwest to a capacity crowd featuring Candiria, Every Time I Die, Nora, and Atreyu. The following festivals were renamed Strhess Tour, which ran from 2003 to 2007. The first was held in held in Cleveland, Ohio at the Scene Pavilion in the West bank of the Flats. Following the success of these shows, Strhess Tour traveled the U.S. and did a brief tour through Europe. The festivals featured both local and national bands, all of which were hand-picked by Hess himself, mostly hardcore and metal bands. Hess now owns his own Indiemerch clothing line, Strhess. His shirt designs can be seen worn by many famous musicians from the genres rock to indie. Shaun Morgan of Seether Was photographed wearing a Strhess shirt in the liner notes of One Cold Night, a live acoustic album. The Strhess Brand came about as Hess began making his move from poster art to fine art. The name came from the Strhess Tours and Festivals that fans were already familiar with. Because of this, Hess was able to bridge the gap between his music roots and newer ventures into fine arts. =Present day= Today, Derek is still creating art and frequently has art shows at his gallery in Cleveland, Ohio, The Derek Hess Gallery, located at 78th Street Studios in the Gordon Square Arts District. Hess is currently doing talks and screenings across the country to promote his new documentary, Forced Perspective.  Personal life  Throughout his entire career, Hess struggled with alcoholism. He later realized his alcohol abuse was a way for him to self-medicate and cope with bipolar disorder. He first went to rehab at 18. \\"The law said go to County Jail or go to rehab, so I said 'Let's go to rehab!'\\", Hess recalled. It was here that Hess learned about his mental illness and how it had been affecting his life without his knowing. After rehab, Hess was sober for 16 years, later falling off the wagon after a bad break-up. His battle with alcoholism began to affect his art, \\"The work I was making when I was drunk or hungover wasn't as good as it could be. I would think I was doing a masterpiece, until I looked at it the next day,\\" Hess said. Hess eventually checked himself into rehab again. \\"I got there, it was noon, and they asked me if I'd been drinking. 'HELL YEAH, I've been drinking!' Because I'd get sick if I didn't drink,\\" Hess said. Since then, Hess has remained sober and has found more effective ways to manage his bipolar disorder. In his documentary, Forced Perspective, Hess spoke candidly about his battle with alcoholism and mental illness and has worked with several mental health organizations while promoting the film.

However, these are not two separate villages but one, despite the gap between the main village and the hamlet known as Tunstall Common. Both lie within the parish of Tunstall. The village itself is a good sized settlement with a pub (The Green Man) and a church called St Michael's, notable for its unusual box pews. Half a mile away, Tunstall Common has a dozen houses and a Baptist chapel. Residents of the hamlet consider themselves to live at Tunstall on the Common, and letters are either addressed to The Common, Tunstall, or Tunstall Common. Tunstall Common itself is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), a beautiful fragment of the ancient sandling dry lowland heath that was once extensive across this area of coastal Suffolk. It lies next to Tunstall Forest, which was started in the 1920s as a pine plantation. In the Great Storm of 1987, Tunstall Forest lost thousands of trees and the opportunity was taken to diversify the mix of trees planted. The area has been designated an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and is a haven for wildlife, including fallow deer and muntjac. The adjacent Rendlesham Forest is known for the former RAF Bentwaters site, now in private ownership, and alleged alien sightings in the 1980s.

While no videos were released, three singles were derived from the album; the promo-only single for Tailormade and full releases for Teen Love and It Beats Me Every Time. The last track on the album, 'Goodbye Again, Or...' is of very low quality in all formats, due to the only recording of the song coming from lead singer and guitarist Peter Mor√©n's mobile phone- added to the album on the last day before mastering. During the tour for his first solo album The Last Tycoon, Mor√©n has performed the song acoustically in an extended form featuring a harmonica solo. Wichita Recordings, responsible for later re-releases of the band's early work, later re-released this album with bonus tracks taken from the singles derived from the album, in the same manner as their debut work. The bonus tracks on this re-release included the extra tracks from the 'Beats, Traps & Backgrounds' EP and 'Fortune Favours Only The Brave', from the 'Teen Love' single. The single covers are notable for being composed entirely of text in the same font as that on the monochrome album art, which itself is a homage to The Velvet Underground's third, self-titled album. The all-text theme carried over into the band's live shows, with the backdrop printed with the word 'Backdrop' repeating endlessly over it, and the amplifiers decorated in the same manner. Themes From the liner notes of the 2006 Wichita reissue of the CD: \\"In everyday life we tend to compromise. This is neither good nor bad. Well, in art it's merely negative, when in life it's just necessary. We give up things we believe in to avoid being left behind, or locked out. In this compromising life we also tend to fall in love. Not just with people, but with places, philosophies, societies and our picture of what life should be. We stare sheeplike in the direction of this ideal picture. But we'll never get there. That way we're bound to be let down. We get confused. And we hurt each other. But these clashes, bullfights and mannered conflicts are there for a reason. We need them there in order to grow and to move on. We need to be confused. Sometimes we fall out with ourselves, and our expectations of ourselves. These are the hardest ones. But also the most important ones. Here are our songs about falling out. Some about falling in as well, but mostly out.

It is described by the band as a \\"mini-album\\". The EP entered at number 45 on the Swedish singles chart, where it stayed for one week. The song 'Punks Jump Up' is an instrumental jam recorded by accident during the sessions for the song 'Money', and is named after the electro-pop duo of the same name. The song 'See Through' was previously released on an early single.

Most of the area lies within the province of Ontario, with smaller portions reaching into Manitoba and Quebec. Many wide and slow-moving rivers flow through this area toward the salt water of Hudson Bay: these include the Churchill, Nelson and Hayes in Manitoba, Severn, Fawn, Winisk, Asheweig, Ekwan, Attawapiskat, and Albany in Ontario, and the Harricana, Rupert and Eastmain in Quebec.Canadian Encyclopedia - Hudson Bay This is the largest wetland in Canada, and one of the largest in the world.Abraham, K.F. and C.J.

The region can be subdivided into three bands running roughly northwest to southeast: the Coastal Hudson Bay Lowland (a narrow band along the northern coast),Coastal Hudson Bay Lowland ecozone profile Hudson Bay Lowland (a broader band extending to slightly south of the Ekwan River),Hudson Bay Lowland ecozone profile and James Bay Lowland (all the rest of the southern/eastern lands, making up close to 50% of the total Lowlands area).James Bay Lowland ecozone profile The entire area was covered by ice during the last glaciation, and the peatlands have accumulated over the last ten thousand years. Plants from more temperate regions mix with arctic species.Riley, John L. 2003. Flora of the Hudson Bay Lowland and its Postglacial Origins. NRC Research Press, Ottawa, Canada. 236 p. A majority of the wetland is peat bog, although salt marshes occur along the coast, and marshes and wet meadows occur along the major rivers. The wetlands provide important habitat for migratory birds including shorebirds (e.g., yellow rail) and waterfowl (e.g., snow geese). Large mammals including polar bears and wolverines. The Hudson Bay Lowlands approximately coincide with the Southern Hudson Bay taiga ecoregion of North America. Snow geese migrate north each year to breed in the coastal marshes of the Hudson Bay Lowlands Early discoveries and exploration The local Ojibwa and Cree most likely came into contact with the region but did not populate the region due to the harsh, undesirable conditions and poor drainage patterns of the area. When Europeans arrived in the area, The Hudson's Bay Company set up trading posts such as Rankin Inlet, some of which remain populated today. However, these never grew into sizable towns, again because of the poor living conditions and climate. To this day, not all of the lowlands have been properly explored. There are a few small First Nations settlements on the southern shore of Hudson Bay Lowlands at places like Moose Factory, Moosonee, Attawapiskat, and Fort Severn. Geography The region is named after the nearby inland sea, Hudson Bay, the second largest in the world. The entire area drains into the bay through rivers such as the Churchill, Severn, and Attawapiskat. The region is located in the extreme north of Ontario, extending into both Manitoba to the west and Quebec in the east, and covers around 25 percent of Ontario's total land area (approximately 228,400 km2). The area was covered in ice during the last ice age, and then flooded as the ice receded, leaving behind plains that are slowly rising out of the ocean due to post-glacial rebound. Peatlands, both bogs and fens now cover much of the landscape,Sj√∂rs, H. 1959. Bogs and fens in the Hudson Bay Lowlands. Arctic 12:2-19. with other kinds of wetlands along rivers and the coast. The climate of the region depends largely on the water surface of the bay, which heats rapidly in the summer, breaking the ice and bringing rains to the lowlands. In the winter the bay freezes over again, bringing freezing temperatures and winds. The vegetation is mostly conifer forest and peatland, with typical sub arctic and boreal plants. Industries The forestry industry is present in the coniferous forests of the region. There is a growing tourist industry which includes fly-fishing and beluga and seal-watching excursions.

Provisions  The Second Succession Act was formally titled An Act concerning the Succession of the Crown, and was also known as the Succession to the Crown: Marriage Act 1536.28 Henry VIII c.7 The Act followed the conviction and execution of Anne Boleyn, and removed both her daughter, Elizabeth, and Mary, Henry's daughter by his first wife, from the line of succession. It superseded the First Succession Act, which had declared Mary to be illegitimate and Elizabeth to be heir presumptive. This new act declared that Elizabeth was also a bastard. As a result, Henry was left without any legitimate child to inherit the throne after his death, which lasted until the birth of Edward in October 1537. Because Henry had no legitimate offspring at the time of the passage of the Act, the Act gave Henry \\"full and plenary power and authority\\" to choose who would succeed him if he died without an heir of his body, by naming his successor in letters patent or in his last will.Section 18 The Act also created several offences of high treason connected with interrupting the succession to the throne of any person so chosen, Section 20 or with saying that Henry's first two marriages to Catherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn had been valid, or that his third marriage to Jane Seymour was invalid, or with saying either of his daughters were legitimate and any son of his third marriage was not. The Act also required some of Henry's subjects to take an oath to uphold the Act, and made it treason to refuse to take said oath.Sections 24 and 25 Sanctuary was not available for people accused of treason under the Act,Section 22 and - in addition to the death penalty - anyone convicted of treason by interrupting the succession to the throne was to forfeit their own claim to the throne, if any existed. The Act also made it treason to criticise the death sentence passed against Thomas More under the Treasons Act 1534.Section 21 Finally, the Act made it treason to attempt to repeal the Act. It was superseded in 1543 by the Third Succession Act, which returned Henry's daughters into the line of succession to the throne, but did not restore their legitimacy.

Nunburnholme derives its name from the Old English Burnholme (‚Äúburn‚Äù = spring, stream; ‚Äúholm‚Äù = island in a river, and was variously spelt Brunnum, Brunham and Brunne in medieval times. The prefix ‚ÄúNun-‚Äú was added some time before the 16th century with reference to Nunburnholme Priory. Nunburnholme was laid waste during the Harrying of the North in 1069‚Äì70 and was still deserted in 1086. The entry for the manor of Brunham in the Domesday Book reads: \\"Terra Tainorum Regis. East Riding. Hessle Hundred. Manerium. In Brunham, Morcar, Turvet and Turchil had 11 carucates of taxable land. There is land for six ploughs. One carucate is soke in Pocklington. Forne holds it of the King, and it is waste.\\" The parish church of St James is a Grade I listed building, noted for its former incumbents the Reverend Francis Orpen Morris, author of works on natural history, and his son, the Rev. Marmaduke Charles Frederick Morris, antiquarian and author.Papers of Rev. M.C.F. Morris and Rev. F.O. Morris, 1842‚Äì1931. Hull University Archives, Hull History Centre. GB 50 U DX21 During restoration in 1872‚Äì7 two sections of an important late Anglo-Saxon cross-shaft were discovered walled up in the church. The Nunburnholme Cross now stands within the church, its two sections incorrectly mounted back to front. The highly ornamented faces of the cross-shaft comprise Anglo-Saxon Christian figures, an unusual haloed warrior in profile, and later pagan Viking and Norman additions. The Yorkshire Wolds Way National Trail, a long-distance footpath, passes through the village, as does the Wilberforce Way, which runs from Kingston upon Hull to York. In 1823 Nunburnholme was a civil parish in the Wapentake of Harthill. Baines stated that there was previously a small Benedictine nunnery, indicated by a mound, that was founded by the ancestors of Roger de Morley. Population at the time was 203, with occupations including ten farmers and yeomen, a shoemaker and shopkeeper, a schoolmaster, and a wheelwright. Nunburnholme was served by Nunburnholme railway station on the York to Beverley Line between 1847 and 1951.

It premiered along with the play on 24 February 1876 in Christiania (now Oslo).Peer Gynt (work by Grieg), on Encyclopedia Britannica Grieg later created two suites from his Peer Gynt music. Some of the music from these suites has received coverage in popular culture; see Grieg's music in popular culture. Background Edvard Grieg (1843-1907) was one of the definitive leaders of Scandinavian music and his influence was great. Although composing many short piano pieces and chamber works, the work Grieg did for Henrik Ibsen stood out. Originally composing 90 minutes of orchestral music for the play, he later went back and extracted certain sections for the suites. Peer Gynt's travels around the world and distant lands are represented by the instruments Grieg chooses to use. When Ibsen asked Grieg to write music for the play in 1874, he reluctantly agreed. However, it was much more difficult for Grieg than he imagined. \\"Peer Gynt progresses slowly,\\" he wrote to a friend in August 1874, ‚Äúand there is no possibility of having it finished by autumn. It is a terribly unmanageable subject.‚Äù Letter from Henrik Ibsen to Grieg, January 23, 1874. \\"The more he saturated his mind with the powerful poem, the more clearly he saw that he was the right man for a work of such witchery and so permeated with the Norwegian spirit,\\" his wife wrote of him and his music. Even though the premiere was a \\"triumphant success\\", it prompted Grieg to complain bitterly that the Swedish management of the theatre had given him specifications as to the duration of each number and its order: \\"I was thus compelled to do patchwork... In no case had I opportunity to write as I wanted... Hence the brevity of the pieces,\\" he said. For many years, the suites were the only parts of the music that were available, as the original score was not published until 1908, one year after Grieg's death, by Johan Halvorsen.Edvard Grieg ‚Äì Thematisch-bibliographisches Werkverzeichnis, ed. by Dan Fog, Kirsti Grinde and √òyvind Norheim. Henry Litolffs Verlag Frankfurt/Main Leipzig London New York 2008 Original score, Op. 23 Various recordings have been made of this music. Some recordings that claim to contain the complete incidental music have 33 selections; the recording conducted by Ole Kristian Ruud is split into 49 items. Both recordings include several verses from the drama, read by actors. The original score contains 26 movements: Movements indicated in bold were extracted by Grieg into two suites. * Act I ** Prelude: At the Wedding (I brudlaupsgarden) ** The Bridal Procession (Brudefylgjet dreg forbi) ** Halling (Halling) ** Springar (Springdans) * Act II ** Prelude: The Abduction of the Bride. Ingrid's Lament (Bruderovet / Ingrids klage) ** Peer Gynt and the Herd-Girls (Peer Gynt og seterjentene) ** Peer Gynt and the Woman in Green (Peer Gynt og den gr√∏nkledde) ** By His mount You Shall Judge Him (P√• ridestellet skal storfolk kjennes) ** In the Hall of the Mountain King (I Dovregubbens hall) ** Dance of the Mountain King's Daughter (Dans av Dovregubbens datter) ** Peer Gynt hunted by the trolls (Peer Gynt jages av troll) ** Peer Gynt and the Boyg (Peer Gynt og B√∏ygen) * Act III ** Prelude: Deep in the Forest (Dypt Inne I Barskogen) ** Solveig's Song (Solvejgs sang) ** The Death of √Öse (√Öses d√∏d) * Act IV ** Prelude: Morning Mood (Morgenstemning) ** The Thief and the Receiver (Tjuven og heilaren) ** Arabian Dance (Arabisk dans) ** Anitra's Dance (Anitras dans) ** Peer Gynt's Serenade (Peer Gynts serenade) ** Peer Gynt and Anitra (Peer og Anitra) ** Solveig's Song (Solvejgs sang) * Act V ** Prelude: Peer Gynt's Homecoming (Peer Gynts heimfart) ** Shipwreck (Skipsforliset) ** Day Scene ** Solveig sings in the hut (Solvejg syngjer i hytta) ** Night Scene (Nattscene) ** Whitsun Hymn (Pinsesalme) ** Solveig's Cradle Song (Solvejgs vuggevise) The complete score of the incidental music includes several songs and choral pieces. The complete score was believed to be lost until the 1980s and has been performed in its entirety only since then. (See the article on Ibsen's play for a list of notable productions, including concert performances of the incidental music.) It was originally orchestrated for: one piccolo, two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets in A, two bassoons, four horns in E, two trumpets in E, three trombones, a tuba, timpani, cymbals, bass drum, triangle, harp, and strings.  Suites  Over a decade after composing the full incidental music for Peer Gynt, Grieg extracted eight movements to make two four-movement suites. The Peer Gynt suites are among his best-known works, however they initially began as incidental compositions. Suite No. 1, Op. 46 was published in 1888, and Suite No. 2, Op. 55 was published in 1891. A typical rendition of both suites lasts 20 to 35 minutes. =Suite No. 1, Op. 46= # Morning Mood (Morgenstemning) (in E major) # The Death of √Öse (√Öses d√∏d) (in B minor) # Anitra's Dance (Anitras dans) (in A minor) # In the Hall of the Mountain King (I Dovregubbens hall) (in B minor) =Suite No. 2, Op. 55= # The Abduction of the Bride. Ingrid's Lament (Bruderovet. Ingrids klage) (in G minor) # Arabian Dance (Arabisk dans) (in C major) # Peer Gynt's Homecoming (Stormy Evening on the Sea) (Peer Gynts hjemfart (Stormfull aften p√• havet)) (in F minor) ‚Äì Compared to the one in the Peer Gynt Incidental Music (Op. 23), Grieg added an extra coda that ended this movement with an imperfect cadence in A minor. # Solveig's Song (Solveigs sang) (in A minor) Originally, the second suite had a fifth number, The Dance of the Mountain King's Daughter, but Grieg withdrew it.

Goo, who stood at only 5-foot-4 ¬Ω inches, was known for his remarkable ability to dribble the ball and keep it away from defenders and for his no-look and seemingly gravity-defying passes. He started working on his basketball skills at age 7, practising his passing off of telephone poles as he walked down the street. As a result, he became one of Hawaii‚Äôs most famous basketball players, leading Hilo High School to three straight Territorial championships between 1934‚Äì1936. After high school, Goo played with a traveling team of Hawaiian all-stars in the United States. He retired from competitive basketball in 1940, due to ill health, and never played in college or professionally. In the mid-1940s, Goo coached a local team in a game against the Harlem Globetrotters. Before the game, he asked Abe Saperstein, coach of the Globetrotters, if he could pull two stunts: one where he would replace a basketball with a deflated ball after a timeout so when a player tried to dribble it, it wouldn't bounce, and the other to tie fishing line around a ball so he could pull it back after faking shooting a free throw. Saperstein said no; but the next year when the Globetrotters returned to Hawaii, they used those both tricks as part of their showtime repertoire. \\"I originated that, I take credit for that,\\" Goo said.Goo truly had magic touch - The Honolulu Advertiser - Hawaii's Newspaper Press Maravich, father of basketball great Pete Maravich and a future college coach, was stationed in Hawaii during World War II and saw Goo perform his tricks with a basketball. The elder Maravich told Goo that if he ever had a son he was going to teach him all the tricks he saw Goo perform. His eventual son, \\"Pistol\\" Pete Maravich, was renowned for his ball-handling and passing skills and became the highest scoring player in college basketball history. Maravich called Goo \\"the best ball-handler I've ever seen.\\" Goo coached the University of Hawaii men‚Äôs basketball team from 1954‚Äì1957, compiling a 31-46 (.402 winning percentage) record over three seasons. He later served at boxing matches, where he was the official knockdown timer. The University of Hawaii women‚Äôs basketball team designates a player each season as the recipient of the Ah Chew Goo Achievement Award, the program's most prestigious individual award, which is given to the player who attains basketball excellence through dedication, determination and perseverance. The Hawaii men‚Äôs team awards the Ah Chew Good Most Inspirational Player Award each season. Goo was a member of the Hawaii Sports Hall of Fame. He was married to Clara Kim Goo.

Born in 1537, Edward was the son of Henry VIII and his third wife, Jane Seymour, and heir apparent to the throne.  History  = Title and dating = The Act was formally titled the Succession to the Crown Act 35 Hen. 8 c.1, and is also known as the Act of Succession 1543. The royal assent was given to this bill in the spring of 1544 at the conclusion of the 1543/1544 Parliament, but until 1793 acts were usually backdated to the beginning of the session of Parliament in which they were passed. (The Act is also often dated 1544.) = Relationship to First and Second Succession Acts = The Third Succession Act superseded the First Succession Act (1533) and the Second Succession Act (1536), whose effects had been to declare bastards Henry's daughters Mary and Elizabeth, and to remove them from succession to the throne. This new act returned both Mary and Elizabeth to the line of succession behind Edward, any potential children of Edward, and any potential children of Henry by his then wife, Catherine Parr, or any future wife Henry might have. With the 1536 Act, Henry VIII was authorised to dispose of the Crown by letters patent or by will, in default of any legitimate heirs. Mary and Elizabeth, who had both been declared illegitimate and incapable to inherit, expressly remained so in the 1543/44 Act; they were only capacitated to succeed to the Crown (with several provisos, such as they could not marry without the Privy Council's approval). This meant that the place in the succession of Mary and Elizabeth remained doubtful. Henry's actual will (1547) simply confirmed their position as outlined in the 1543/44 statute. = Historical effect = Edward VI's \\"Devise for the Succession\\". The Treason Act 1547 made it high treason to interrupt the line of succession to the throne established by the Act of Succession. Edward VI meant to bypass this Act in his \\"Devise for the Succession\\", issued as letters patent on 21 June 1553, in which he named Lady Jane Grey as his successor.

It peaked at No. 8 on the UK Album Chart. Three singles were released from the album: \\"Music for Chameleons\\", \\"We Take Mystery (To Bed)\\" and \\"White Boys and Heroes\\", all of which reached the UK Top 20 (\\"We Take Mystery\\" peaked at No. 9, and is Numan's last Top 10 single to date). Overview Numan's previous album, Dance, was an experimental effort that explored and incorporated different musical elements such as jazz. I, Assassin operates in a similar vein. Although the fretless bass and some of the jazz elements of Dance are still in place, Numan went further with I, Assassin, exploring funk music and blending it together with heavier percussion and his own familiar electronic sound. Numan recalled that an important factor during the album's recording was the contribution made by fretless bassist Pino Palladino: At the time I, Assassin was released, Numan believed it was the best album he had made. Although it was unsurprisingly slated by the majority of the British music press (which had had a strong dislike for Numan and his music ever since his meteoric rise to fame), the album did garner some praise. Numan was given credit for changing his sound by shifting from synth-heavy music to a more bass-led, electro-dance approach . Numan argued that he wanted to shift away from a lot of electronic artists during this period because he felt they were stuck in an interchangeable and simplistic rut that they could never break . Numan wanted to be ahead of the pack and was interested in experimenting with other genres. For the album's cover sleeve, Numan retained the fedora hat from Dance, with the trench coat and alley background representing I, Assassin's 1930s gangster motif. The album cover of I, Assassin was influenced by that of Frank Sinatra's 1954 album Songs for Young Lovers. Before the release of I, Assassin, Numan left Britain to live as a tax exile in the United States. He supported the new album with an 18-date concert tour in America in October- November 1982 (his first series of live shows since his \\"farewell\\" shows at Wembley Stadium in 1981). No official live albums or videos have been released from Numan's 1982 tour. Numan recorded a second video for \\"We Take Mystery (To Bed)\\" during his stay in Los Angeles, before heading to live in Jersey where he began writing the material for his next album, Warriors (1983). Releases I, Assassin was originally released on vinyl album and cassette in 1982. It was eventually released on CD in 1993, as a double CD packaged with Numan's 1980 album Telekon (Beggars Banquet had reissued all eight of Numan's studio albums that were released on the label, including the two Tubeway Army albums, as double CD sets). I, Assassin was released on CD by itself in 2002. Both CD releases contain seven bonus tracks.

The goal of creative financing is generally to purchase, or finance a property, with the buyer/investor using as little of his own money as possible, otherwise known as leveraging, OPM (Other People's Money). Using these techniques an investor may be able to purchase multiple properties using little, or none, of his \\"own money\\".  Types  = Hard money loans = Hard money loans (abbreviated as HML) are similar to private mortgages except that they are made through a hard money lender. A hard money lender may get his financing either from his own contacts with private lenders, or financial institutions with whom he has established his own lines of credit. Hard money loans are made to real estate investors for the purpose of investing in and rehabbing real estate. Rates are a little higher than borrowing directly from a private lender, as the hard money lender may also be collecting yield spread. The hard money lender will also charge points of 3% to 6% or more. These points are often paid up front, but a few lenders may roll these into the loan. Hard money loans are high-interest mortgages available from private investors. Desperate borrowers with poor credit scores, bankruptcies, no verifiable income, or too much debt often take out hard money loans when they are unable to qualify for traditional mortgages. Hard money becomes a last resort when borrowers cannot meet the lending standards set by banks or government sponsored enterprises such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. = Private mortgages = A private mortgage is a loan secured by real estate that is made by a private lender, instead of a traditional lender, financial institution, or government institution. These loans are most commonly short term and last anywhere from 6 months to three years. These are asset based loans made for the purchase and rehabilitation of real estate. Because the loans are asset based, the decision to loan is based on the criteria of the property and not usually the qualifications, or credit of the borrower. Interest rates on these loans are considerably higher than traditional loans and may range from 12% to 18%, with points sometimes being required as well. Loans are made on an LTV (loan to value) of 65% to 70%, to preserve sufficient equity in the property for the private lender in the event of default. = Simultaneous closings = A Simultaneous closing allows a home seller to offer owner financing on a property without having to hold any mortgage. On closing day, the property title is transferred to the buyer and the newly created (owner-financed) mortgage is sold to a note investor for cash, simultaneously. = Subject-to = A subject-to transaction is a creative finance technique where a buyer is able to take title to property without obtaining a loan in the traditional manner. The transaction usually involves the seller of the property leaving his or her existing financing in place. This process is similar to assuming a loan, but differs because it usually takes place without the knowledge of the original lending institution and operates outside the original terms of the loan. This technique is useful because it affords the buyer the ability to obtain financing without the need for transaction costs and does not tie up capital to obtain a new loan. The technique also allows the buyer to purchase property quickly without going through the arduous loan origination process.http://www.allbestarticles.com/finance/investments/the- role-of-creative-financing-in-subject-to-investing.html = Land trust = A land trust is an agreement whereby one party (the trustee) agrees to hold ownership of a piece of real property for the benefit of another party (the beneficiary). Land trusts are used by nonprofit organizations to hold conservation easements, by corporations and investment groups to compile large tracts of land, and by individuals to keep their real estate ownership private, avoid probate and provide several other benefits. In the application of creative financing, a land trust can be used to take control of a property while keeping the name of the owner private. While this does not prevent the lending institution from invoking the due on sale clause, it will make it harder for the lending institution to detect that the property has been sold using creative financing. = Short sale = In a short sale, the seller is often several payments behind and may even be close to foreclosure, the seller can also show significant hardships that have led them to being unable to continue making payments on this property. The seller will give the short sale investor a contract to purchase the property, a deed that will probably be placed in escrow, power of attorney and a number of other documents that will give them full control of the property. The investor will then present a case to the bank holding the mortgage, that the seller is no longer able to make payments, is having to relinquish control of the property and that the loan on the property must be reduced in order for the investor to purchase the property. The term \\"short sale\\" is a misnomer because it has nothing to do with shorting anything in the financial sense. These transactions can also take a significant amount of time so it is not called a \\"short sale\\" for that reason either. However, the process is shorter than the traditional process of going through foreclosure and sale by auction, which is still likely to take much longer. This is a method to sell your house quickly, because effectively you pass over control of your property to the short sale investor immediately upon signing of the documents. From that time on, it is up to the investor to complete the transaction. Should a bank refuse to accept the investor's offer on a short sale, there is no guarantee that the house will not go to foreclosure anyway, but this does provide the seller a \\"possibility to avoid foreclosure\\", when all else has failed. This technique may also be used to stop foreclosure long enough to allow another purchase, or something else to be done with the property.

They released several EPs in their first 3 years of existence, but came to widespread attention only in 2007, when their single \\"The Guide\\" was featured as Single of the Week on a number of iTunes Stores worldwide, including the US store. iTunes took the unprecedented move of listing the free download worldwide. The band's debut onto the world digital stage was remarkable, soaring into chart high-points globally and resting at No. 13 in the US Billboard digital charts. The band was last-minute inclusion at the 2007 South by Southwest Festival, in Austin, Texas, an annual event where hundreds of musical acts from across the globe are showcased. In 2006, one of the band's songs, Don't Go Now was featured during evictions on the Australian version of Big Brother. In the United States, The Guide was featured in the hit television program, Friday Night Lights. The band made 2007 its year of recognition in its own back yard, Australia. Borne raised eyebrows in the Australian music industry when it was promoted to the high ground of international recognition at the UK's big festivals, Hyde Park Calling and Glastonbury. It put the seal on 2007 when, from 5000 entrants, Borne took out the four most coveted awards at the MusicOz Awards 2007, the annual showcase event for independent Australian musicians. Borne won the Nova Initiative award; its lead singer Cameron Tapp received the award for best singer/songwriter. The band also won the Garth Porter Award and the major award, Artist of the Year. Further international recognition of the band and its lyrical appeal to network television audiences came with the inclusion of \\"Don't Go Now\\" in the US, ABC super-series 'October Road'. As of 2007, the members of Borne are: * Cameron Tapp- lead vocals and guitar; * Steve Kucina- vocals and guitar; * Pete McDonald- drums; * Scott Thornburn- bass guitar In 2009, \\"The Guide\\" (from the album Loss of Signal) was featured on an Australian advertisement for Pedigree's Adoption Drive. Tapp Overseas Trip On 13 June 2008, Cameron Tapp flew from Australia to perform \\"The Guide\\" for a wedding in Fargo, North Dakota. The wedding couple had heard the song on iTunes and attempted to find the sheet music online so that it could be performed at their nuptials. Having difficulty doing so (because Tapp does not read or write music), the couple emailed the band via their website, inquiring about the availability of the song. Tapp himself responded, jokingly saying the couple could fly him to the United States to perform at their wedding. The couple decided to skip their honeymoon and instead used the money saved for it (approximately US$3000) to purchase Tapp an airline ticket. As of 2013, Borne is Cameron Tapp, the original founding member in 2007. He performs under the name 'Borne' when performing Borne songs live with a band of session musicians. Cam continues to write and licence songs under the 'Borne' brand name.

The song makes reference to hoodoo folk magic elements and makes novel use of a stop-time musical arrangement. It became one of Waters' most popular and identifiable songs and helped secure Dixon's role as Chess Records' chief songwriter. The song is a classic of Chicago blues and one of Waters' first recordings with a full backing band. Dixon's lyrics build on Waters' earlier use of braggadocio and themes of fortune and sex appeal. The stop-time riff was \\"soon absorbed into the lingua franca of blues, R&B;, jazz, and rock and roll\\", according to musicologist Robert Palmer, and is used in several popular songs. When Bo Diddley adapted it for \\"I'm a Man\\", it became one of the most recognizable musical phrases in blues. After the song's initial success in 1954, Waters recorded several live and new studio versions. The original appears on the 1958 The Best of Muddy Waters album and many compilations. Numerous musicians have recorded \\"Hoochie Coochie Man\\" in a variety of styles, making it one of the most interpreted Waters and Dixon songs. The Blues Foundation and the Grammy Hall of Fame recognize the song for its influence in popular music and the US Library of Congress' National Recording Registry selected it for preservation in 2004. Background Between 1947 and 1954, Muddy Waters charted a number of hits recording for Chess Records and its Artistocrat predecessor. One of his first singles was \\"Gypsy Woman\\", recorded in 1947. The song shows Delta blues guitar-style roots, but the lyrics place \\"emphasis on supernatural elements‚Äîgypsies, fortune telling, [and] luck\\", according to musicologist Robert Palmer. Waters expanded the theme in \\"Louisiana Blues\\", which was recorded in 1950 with Little Walter accompanying on harmonica. He sings of traveling to New Orleans, Louisiana, to acquire a mojo hand, a hoodoo amulet or talisman; with its magical powers, he hopes \\"to show all you good lookin' women just how to treat your man\\". Similar lyrics appeared in \\"Hoodoo Hoodoo\\", a 1946 recording by John Lee \\"Sonny Boy\\" Williamson: \\"Well now I'm goin' down to Louisiana, and buy me another mojo hand\\". Although Waters was ambivalent about hoodoo, he saw the music as having its own power: From 1946 to 1951, Willie Dixon sang and played bass with the Big Three Trio. After the group disbanded, he worked for Chess Records as a recording session arranger and bassist. Dixon wrote several songs, but label co-owner Leonard Chess failed to show any interest at first. Finally, in 1953, Chess used two of Dixon's songs: \\"Too Late\\", recorded by Little Walter, and \\"Third Degree\\", recorded by Eddie Boyd. \\"Third Degree\\" became Dixon's first composition to enter the record charts. In September, Waters recorded his \\"Mad Love (I Want You to Love Me)\\", which Dixon biographer Mitsutoshi Inaba calls \\"a test piece for the forthcoming 'Hoochie Coochie Man'\\" because of its shared lyrical and musical elements. The song became Waters' first record chart success in nearly two years. The term \\"hoochie coochie\\", with variations in the spelling, is used in different contexts. Appearing in the late 19th century, the hoochie coochie was a sexually provocative dance. Don Wilmeth identifies it as \\"a precursor of the striptease ... from the belly dance but punctuated with bumps and grinds and a combination of exposure, erotic movements, and teasing.\\" By one account, it first appeared at the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition in 1876 and was a popular attraction at the 1893 Chicago World's Fair. The dance is associated with entertainers Little Egypt and Sophie Tucker, but by the 1910s it declined in popularity. \\"Hoochie coochie\\" is also used to refer to a sexually attractive person or a practitioner of hoodoo. In his autobiography, I Am the Blues, Dixon included \\"hoochie coochie man\\" in his examples of a seer or a clairvoyant with a connection to folklore of the American South: \\"This guy is a hoodoo man, this lady is a witch, this other guy's a hoochie coochie man, she's some kind of voodoo person\\". Composition and recording Not long after the success of \\"Mad Love\\" in November 1953, Dixon approached Leonard Chess with \\"Hoochie Coochie Man\\", a new song he felt was right for Waters. Chess responded, \\"if Muddy likes it, give it to him\\". At the time, Waters was performing at the Club Zanzibar in Chicago. During an intermission, Dixon showed him the song. According to Dixon, Waters took to the tune immediately because it had so many familiar elements and he was able to learn enough to perform it that night. Jimmy Rogers, who was Waters' second guitarist, remembered that it took a little longer: Willie Dixon at Monterey Jazz Festival, 1981 On January 7, 1954, Waters entered the recording studio with his band to record the song. Considered the classic Chicago blues band, music critic Bill Janovitz described Waters' group as \\"a who's who of bluesmen\\". Waters sings and plays electric guitar along with Rogers, blues harmonica virtuoso Little Walter, and drummer Elgin Evans, all of whom had been performing with Waters since 1951. (Fred Below, who replaced Evans during 1954, is sometimes listed as the drummer.) Pianist Otis Spann, who joined in 1953, and Dixon, in his debut on double bass for Waters' recording session, round out the group. Two takes of the song were recorded. Although there are some moments in the alternate take when a player's timing rushes or drags perceptibly, because the band is so tight, the difference with the master is only six seconds (for a nearly three- minute song). \\"Hoochie Coochie Man\\" follows a sixteen-bar blues progression, which is an expansion of the well-known twelve-bar blues pattern. The first four bars are doubled in length so the harmony remains on the tonic for eight bars or one-half of the sixteen bar progression. Dixon explained that expanding twelve-bar blues was in response to amplification, which gave instruments more sustain. The extra bars also increase the contrasting effect of the repeating stop-time musical figure or riff. For the second eight bars, the song reverts to the last eight of the twelve-bar progression, which functions as a refrain or hook. The different textures provides the tune with a strong contrast, which helps underscore the lyrics. The song is performed at a moderate blues tempo (72 beats per minute) in the key of A. It is notated in time and contains three sixteen-bar sections. A key feature of the song is the use of stop time, or pauses in the music, during the first half of the progression. This musical device is commonly heard in New Orleans jazz, when the instrumentation briefly stops, allowing for a short instrumental solo before resuming. However, Waters' and Dixon's use of stop time serves to heighten the tension through repetition, followed by a vocal rather than an instrument fill. The accompanying riff, which Dixon described as a five-note figure, is similar to that of \\"Mad Love\\". He attributed it to the band and using such a phrase for eight bars was a new approach. Although Palmer comments that the entire group phrases the riff in unison, Boone describes it as a \\"heavy, unhurried counterpoint by all the instruments together\\". Campbell identifies the opening as actually having \\"two competing riffs\\" or contrapuntal motion, with one played by Little Walter on an amplified harmonica and another by Waters on electric guitar. For the second eight-bars of the progression, the song follows the standard I‚ÄìIV‚ÄìV7 structure, which maintains its connection to traditional blues. The whole band plays it as a shuffle with a triplet rhythm, which Campbell describes as a \\"free-for-all [with] harmonica trills, guitar riffs, piano chords, thumping bass, [and] shuffle pattern on the drums\\". He adds that this type of heavy sound was rarely heard in small music combos before rock. However, unlike the polyphony of New Orleans jazz, the instrumentation parallels Waters' aggressive vocal approach and reinforces the lyrics. The players' use of amplification, pushed to the point of distortion, is a key feature of Chicago blues and another rock precedent. In particular, Little Walters' overdriven saxophone-like harmonica playing weaves in and out of the vocal lines, which heightens the drama. Lyrics and interpretation \\"Hoochie Coochie Man\\" is characterized as a \\"self-mythologizing testament\\" by Janovitz. The narrator boasts of his good fortune and his effect on women as aided by hoodoo. Waters explored similar themes in earlier songs, but his approach was more subtle. According to Palmer, Dixon upped the ante with more \\"flamboyance, macho posturing, and extra-generous helping of hoodoo sensationalism\\". Dixon claimed that the idea of a seer was inspired by history and the Bible. The verses in the song's three sixteen-bar sections proceed chronologically. The opening verse starts before the narrator is born and references Waters' 1947 song \\"Gypsy Woman\\": Muddy Waters with James Cotton, 1971 As a boy in the South, Dixon recalled gypsies in covered wagons plying their trade from town to town. The fortune tellers would emphasize auspicious circumstances to enhance their earnings, especially when doing readings for pregnant women. In the second section, the narrative is in the present and several references are made to charms used by hoodoo conjurers. These include a black cat bone, a John the conqueror root, and a mojo, the last of which figured in \\"Louisiana Blues\\". Their magical powers assure that the gypsy's prophecy will be borne out: women and the rest of world will take notice. The song concludes with a final section which projects the good fortune into the future. The number seven is prominent: on the seventh hour, on the seventh day, etc. The stringing together of sevens is another good omen and is analogous to the seventh son of a seventh son of folklore. Dixon later expanded the theme in his 1955 song \\"The Seventh Son\\". Each section is linked by a refrain or recurring chorus. It functions as a hook and it differs from the usual \\"free-associative aspect\\" of traditional blues. Writer Benjamin Filene sees this and Dixon's desire to tell complete stories, with the verses building on each other, as sharing elements of pop music. The chorus, \\"But you know I'm here, everybody knows I'm here, Well you know I'm the hoochie coochie man, everybody knows I'm here\\", confirms the narrator's identity as both the subject of the gypsy's prophecy as well as an omnipotent seer himself. Dixon felt that the lyrics expressed part of the audience's unfulfilled desire to brag, while Waters later admitted that they were supposed to have a comic effect. Music historian Ted Gioia points to the underlying theme of sexuality and virility as sociologically significant. He sees it as challenge to the fear of miscegenation in the dying days of racial segregation in the United States. Record producer Marshall Chess took a simpler view: \\"It was sex. If you have ever seen Muddy then, the effect he had on women [was clear]. Because the blues, you know, has always been a women's market\\". Releases and charts In early 1954, Chess Records issued \\"I'm Your Hoochie Cooche Man\\" backed with \\"She's So Pretty\\" on both the standard ten- inch 78 rpm and the newer seven-inch 45 rpm record single formats. It soon became the biggest hit of Waters' career. The single entered Billboard magazine's Rhythm & Blues Records charts on March 13, 1954, and reached number three on the Juke Box chart and number eight on the Best Seller chart. It remained on the charts for 13 weeks, making it Waters' longest charting record up to that time (two more Waters-Dixon songs, \\"Just Make Love to Me (I Just Want to Make Love to You\\") and \\"Close to You\\", both later also lasted 13 weeks). Chess included the song on Waters' first album, the 1958 compilation The Best of Muddy Waters, but retitled it \\"Hoochie Coochie\\". Numerous later Waters' official compilations contain it, such as Sail On; McKinley Morganfield a.k.a. Muddy Waters; The Chess Box; His Best: 1947 to 1955; The Best of Muddy Waters ‚Äì The Millennium Collection; The Anthology (1947‚Äì1972); Hoochie Coochie Man: The Complete Chess Masters, Vol. 2: 1952‚Äì1958; and The Definitive Collection. Marshall Chess arranged for Waters to remake the song using psychedelic rock-style instrumentation for the 1968 album Electric Mud, which was an attempt to reach a new audience. In 1972, Waters recorded an \\"unplugged\\" rendition of the song, with Louis Myers on acoustic guitar and George \\"Mojo\\" Buford on unamplified harmonica. Chess released it in 1994 on the Waters rarities collection One More Mile. He revisited the song with original guitarist Jimmy Rogers in 1977. They re-recorded it for I'm Ready, the Grammy Award-winning album produced by Johnny Winter. Waters featured the song in his performances and several live recordings have been issued. His acclaimed At Newport 1960, one of the first live blues albums, includes a rendition by his later band with Spann, Pat Hare, James Cotton, and Francis Clay. Other live albums have versions that span his career with different backup bands. These include Live in 1958 (recorded in England in 1958 with Spann and Chris Barber's trad jazz band, released in 1993 and re-released as Collaboration in 1995); Authorized Bootleg: Live at the Fillmore Auditorium ‚Äì San Francisco Nov 04‚Äì06 1966 (released 2009); The Lost Tapes (recorded 1971, released 1999); Muddy \\"Mississippi\\" Waters ‚Äì Live (recorded 1977, released 1979); and Live at the Checkerboard Lounge, Chicago 1981 with members of the Rolling Stones (released 2012). Influence and recognition \\"Hoochie Coochie Man\\" represents Waters' recording transition from an electrified, but more traditional Delta-based blues of the late 1940s‚Äìearly 1950s to a newer Chicago blues ensemble sound. The song was important to Dixon's career and signaled a change as well ‚Äì Chess became convinced of Dixon's value as a songwriter and secured his relationship as such with the label. Waters soon followed up with several variations on the sixteen-bar stop-time arrangement written by Dixon. These include \\"I Just Want to Make Love to You\\", \\"I'm Ready\\", and \\"I'm a Natural Born Lover\\". All of these songs follow a similar lyrical theme and \\"helped shape Muddy Waters' image as the testosterone king of the blues\\", according to Gioia. Bo Diddley modified the song's signature riff for his March 1955 song \\"I'm a Man\\". He reworked it as a four-note figure, which is repeated for the entire song without a progression to other chords. Music critic and writer Cub Koda calls it \\"the most recognizable blues lick in the world\\". Waters, not to be outdone, responded two months later with an answer song to \\"I'm a Man\\", titled \\"Mannish Boy\\". \\"Bo Diddley, he was tracking me down with my beat when he made 'I'm a Man'. That's from 'Hoochie Coochie Man.' Then I got on it with 'Mannish Boy' and just drove him out of my way\\", Waters recalled. Emphasizing the origin of Bo Diddley's song, Waters sticks to the original first eight-bar phrase from \\"Hoochie Coochie Man\\" and includes some of the hoodoo references. According to Palmer, songwriters adapted the phrase for other artists and it was \\"soon absorbed into the lingua franca of blues, jazz, and rock and roll\\". In 1955, songwriters Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller used the riff for \\"Riot in Cell Block Number 9\\" (later reworked by the Beach Boys as \\"Student Demonstration Time\\") and \\"Framed\\" for the R&B; group the Robins. \\"Trouble\\", another Leiber and Stoller composition that uses the riff, was sung by Elvis Presley in the 1958 musical drama film King Creole. American composer Elmer Bernstein quoted the figure in another film, The Man with the Golden Arm, which received a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Original Score in 1955. Dixon remarked, \\"we felt like this was a great achievement for one of these blues phrases to be used in a movie\\". As numerous artists recorded it in a variety of styles, \\"Hoochie Coochie Man\\" became a blues standard. Janovitz describes the song as \\"a vital piece of Chicago-style electric blues that links the Delta to rock & roll\\". Rock musicians are among the many who have interpreted it. In 1984, Waters' original \\"I'm Your Hoochie Coochie Man\\" was inducted into the Blues Foundation Hall of Fame. The Foundation noted that \\"In addition to countless versions by Chicago blues artists, the song has been recorded by performers as diverse as Jimi Hendrix, Chuck Berry, and jazz organist Jimmy Smith\\" to which Grove adds B.B. King, Buddy Guy, John P. Hammond, the Allman Brothers Band, and Eric Clapton. A Grammy Hall of Fame Award followed in 1998, which \\"honor[s] recordings of lasting qualitative or historical significance\\". The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's list of the \\"500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll\\" recognizes the song's influence on rock. Representatives of the music industry and press voted it number 226 for Rolling Stone magazine's list of the \\"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\\". In 2004, the National Recording Preservation Board, advisors to the US Library of Congress, selected it for preservation in the National Recording Registry and noted the contributions of the band members.

Beginnings After √Ålvaro, a former soccer player for teams such as Getafe CF and Real Madrid, suffered a serious injury, he began to play guitar and compose songs during his rehabilitation period. He finally quit football and created a band called PIG NOISE. The group later used many of the songs he composed while in rehabilitation. Later Polo, another former soccer player for Real Zaragoza and other teams, joined the group. The last to join was Pablo, a student who had come from Asturias to Madrid to study theater. Their popularity increased sharply after appearing in a very well known Spanish show, Los hombres de Paco. During the elections in the Basque Autonomous Community the band played in a meeting created by the conservative Spanish political party Partido Popular. The band has been heavily criticized after that, but during an interview for 20minutos.es, the bandmembers said that they thought it was just an event for young people created by Partido Popular and concluded saying that they'll never play in a political meeting again. Musical style and influences Pignoise is described as a pop punk band. Even though they have been seen wearing NOFX shirts in music videos, their light punk rock characteristics and their predominant pop music sound makes them clearly a pop punk band. They may also be considered pop rock or alternative rock. The band cites Ramones, blink-182, Green Day, NoFX, Slick Shoes, Allister and The Offspring as some of their main influences. Discography The group has released seven discs. The first two were Melod√≠as Desafinadas (Out-of-tune Melodies) and Esto No Es Un Disco de Punk (This Is Not a Punk Disc). Their third release is titled Anunciado en Televisi√≥n (Advertised on Television), which became a hit in Spain and whose first single, \\"Nada Que Perder\\" (\\"Nothing to Lose\\"), is the theme song of the television series Los Hombres de Paco. =Studioalbums= * Melodias Desafinadas (luno Records) - 2003 * Esto no es un disco de punk (luno Records) - 2005 * Anunciado en televisi√≥n (Warner Music Spain) - 2006 * Cuesti√≥n de gustos (Warner Music Spain) - 2007 * A√±o Zero (Sony Music) - 2010 * El tiempo y el espacio (Pignoise Records) - 2013 * Lo que queda por andar (Pignoise Records) - 2015 =Compilations= * Cuesti√≥n de directo (Warner Music Spain) - 2009 =EPs= * Maqueta (self-released) - 2001 * Pignoise por dentro (Sony Music) - 2011 =Singles= * Nada Que Perder - 2006 * Te Entiendo - 2006 * Sigo llorando por ti - 2006 * Sin ti - 2007 * Sube a mi cohete - 2007 * Pasar de cuartos (created to the Spain national football team) - 2008 * Estoy enfermo (feat.

Wrongly attributed to Christian mystic Meister Eckhart it nevertheless shows the influence of his ideas (as evinced by the full German title), or at least the ideas which he was accused or attributed as having had by the Inquisition. Mystical dialogue The Sister Catherine Treatise takes the form of a series of dialogues in Middle High German between a woman (Sister Catherine) and her Confessor (not named but sometimes said to be Eckhart). Sister Catherine is determined to find \\"the shortest way\\" to God and comes to her Confessor for advice. In the first section her Confessor urges her to rebuke sin and seek purity so as to receive God. She leaves with the intention of doing so. Years later Sister Catherine returns to speak again to her Confessor, but this time the roles are reversed. Sister Catherine has experienced God and, after falling seemingly dead for three days (in imitation of Christ), reawakens to claim that she has achieved a unity with God which is eternal and which will last throughout this life and beyond. Sister Catherine is presented as having gone further down the road of spiritual development to her Confessor and he finds himself praising her for her Holiness rather than the other way round. Sister Catherine speaks of her unity with God in the following terms: The rest of the treatise consists of a continued dialogue with the Confessor - often held at a fever-pitch of excitement and emotion - in which both Sister Catherine and the Confessor exchange ideas about God's immanence, the possibility of humanity's union with Him in this life, the role of Mary Magdalene's relationship with Christ as his Lover and chief Apostle and the need to recognise the deceptions of the reality and unreality of Union with God i.e. what true Union is as opposed to false Union. Here the treatise is careful to delineate the danger of those who interpret the Free Spirit ideals as carte blanche to commit sinful and/or immoral acts. The treatise finishes with Sister Catherine abjuring the Confessor to strive after higher feats of spiritual understanding, the pupil having become the master (or mistress) and the Confessor needing the guidance of the Sister to achieve union with God. Assessment The Sister Catherine Treatise is often cited, along with Marguerite Porete's The Mirror of Simple Souls, as one of the representative literary expressions of the Heresy of the Free Spirit, which held that a divine union with God was possible to people in this life and, more controversially, independently of the ministrations of the Church. Initially attributed to Meister Eckhart in Franz Pfeiffer's ground-breaking edition of the Christian mystic's works in 1857 it is now regarded as not being by him but showing evidence of his thinking, or at least evidence of the Free Spirit movement which Eckhart was accused of adhering to. Written in a heightened emotional prose which gives the Treatise a slightly hysterical, hallucinatory quality the work espouses a highly feminine approach to the Christian Mystery, with lengthy discussions of the significance of Mary Magdalene as the true lover of Christ (an element which links it to Porete, some of the alleged beliefs of the Cathars and the speculations of Dan Brown) and the figure of Sister Catherine herself emerging as more initiated into the inner spirituality of Christianity than her male counterpart. In it many of the articles of faith of the Free Spirit movement are expressed - a neo- Platonic/panentheistic belief in God's immanence in Creation, the possibility of salvation and the Unio Mystica in this life, the limitations of Church teaching in terms of real mystical insight - and as such it is a valuable document for those in search of understanding the more radical approach to interpreting the Gospels of the Medieval period known as the Heresy of the Free Spirit. The treatise is the only currently known medieval work which mentions the well-known question of how many angels can stand, or perhaps perch (siczen), on the point of a needle: \\"doctors declare that in heaven a thousand angels can stand on the point of a needle (tusent selen siczen in dem himelrich uff einer nadel spicz).\\" Dancing on the point of a needle appears to be a later concept.

History The company was founded by Eric Greenberg, Duc Haba, Dwayne Nesmith, and Robbie Vann-Adib√© as Silicon Valley Internet Partners (SVIP). It was one of the first consulting firms to attempt to integrate the disparate disciplines of strategy, 'creative' (design), and technology into a single value proposition and project approach. Such blended multi-disciplinary approaches have since become common. With investment from Mohr Davidow Ventures, Trident Capital, and Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield & Byers, SVIP grew rapidly. Robert Gett, from Cambridge Technology Partners, was recruited in mid-1996 in be the CEO. At this point, SVIP corporate functions moved to Boston, Massachusetts. Greenberg left the company in early 1997, and subsequently founded Scient. SVIP changed its name to Viant in the spring of 1998 after a company-wide vote. Its San Francisco Bay Area offices relocated in 1998 to the South of Market area in San Francisco. Viant grew its staff at 100% or greater in the following years, with offices \\"spawned\\" by sending multi-disciplinary teams from other offices into new geographies, including locations in New York City, Dallas, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Houston, Atlanta, Silicon Valley, and Munich.

Richard Cassirer (23 April 1868 ‚Äì 20 August 1925) was a German neurologist born into a Jewish family in Breslau. After receiving his medical doctorate in 1891, he became assistant at the psychiatric clinic in Breslau under Karl Wernicke (1848-1905). In 1893 he relocated to Vienna, where he furthered his studies with Richard von Krafft-Ebing (1840-1902) and Heinrich Obersteiner (1847-1922). Later, he became professor of neurology at the University of Berlin, where he worked closely with Hermann Oppenheim (1858-1919). As a clinical neurologist, Cassirer specialized on the anatomy of the central nervous system, and made contributions in his research of multiple sclerosis, encephalitis and poliomyelitis. Among his written works was a new edition (1923) of Oppenheim's Lehrbuch der Nervenkrankheiten f√ºr √Ñrzte und Studierende. Antiqbook In 1912 he first described a circulatory disease marked by an association of ovarian insufficiency and acrocyanosis with vasomotor- trophic disturbance of the skin, and disturbances of sensitivity caused by dysregulation of the vegetative nervous system which has been given the eponymic name of \\"Cassirer's syndrome\\" or \\"Crocq-Cassirer syndrome\\". In 1921, Dr. Cassirer was asked to give testimony in regards to the mental condition of Soghomon Tehlirian, a man accused of murdering Talaat Pasha. Cassirer maintained that Tehlirian was not sane when he carried out the crime due to a psychotic state caused as a result of his family being victims of a war-time massacre. Cassirer's portrait was painted by renowned artist Max Liebermann in 1918, and later presented to the Tate Gallery in London.  Written works  * Die vasomotorisch-trophischen neurosen.

The wooden bridge was completed in 1750, was painted by Canaletto and stood until 1783 when, in decay, it was dismantled to make way for a stone-clad brickwork replacement, later painted by Turner. History Construction of the bridge by a Mr White of Weybridge was started in 1748 and was completed in 1750. The construction was paid for by Samuel Dicker who was the MP for Plymouth and owned property in Walton on Thames. By paying for its construction Dicker also obtained the right to collect tolls from users of the bridge under the statute. Opponents to its construction comprised ferry operators, who foresaw an impact their livelihoods; the bargees who thought it would make the river unnavigable; and a minority of residents of Walton-on-Thames who were worried about an influx of undesirable elements from substantially rural and wayfaring villages of West Middlesex north of the river. Despite the late opposition following his Act, Dicker pressed on with construction, probably motivated by his own desire for easy access to London (Hampton Court Bridge allowing the shortcut from the south bank across Hampton Court Park's major meander was opened at the end of 1753) and for the financial benefits the tolls would bring. Etheridge's Mathematical Bridge in Cambridge. The design of the bridge was by William Etheridge who also designed the smaller but similar Mathematical Bridge across the River Cam at Queens' College, Cambridge, and had been responsible for the construction of many of the timber centres of the Westminster Bridge while working as James King's foreman. First constructed between 1749 and 1750, this bridge still stands, although it has been rebuilt twice, most recently in 1905. The Old Walton Bridge was supported by four central stone piers connected by three arches built of wooden beams and joists. The span of the central arch was 130 feet (39 m), at the time the widest unsupported span in England (it was surpassed by William Edwards Bridge at Pontypridd).Skempton pp.217-8 The other two main arches were each 44 feet (13 m), though Dicker later suggested that the design would have allowed for side spans of 70 ft or more. Away from the water were five further small brickwork arches on each side of the river. On the strength of their success with Walton Bridge Etheridge and Dicker put forward two proposals for a bridge at Blackfriars, one for building in stone and the other in timber. The stone- built proposal was accepted but several changes to Etheridge's design led to him leaving the project before it was completed. Although considered an impressive feat of engineering at the time of its construction, the bridge stood for only 33 years. Dicker died in London in 1760 and his estates in the area were sold. The bridge passed to his nephew, Michael Dicker Sanders, but he found it difficult to meet the costs of its upkeep. A report on the condition of the bridge in 1778 suggested that decay in the wooden frame made it unsuitable for use, and it was dismantled in 1783 to make way for a stone- clad brickwork bridge which was completed in 1788 and eventually collapsed in 1859. Canaletto's paintings Oil-on-canvas Dulwich Picture Gallery, London Canaletto spent time in England between 1746 and 1755, mostly in London, but at some time after 1750 he travelled out to Walton to produce a painting of the bridge. He had previously depicted one of Etherbridge's constructions in 1747 as the framing span of The City Seen Through an Arch of Westminster Bridge. Normally the figures populating his landscapes were anonymous, but his painting of the bridge is unusual because the identities of several of the figures are known. In the centre of the painting on the near bank, two figures can be seen standing together; to the left is Thomas Hollis who commissioned the painting from Canaletto, and almost certainly requested that he be included. It is likely that Hollis selected the image from a sketch in Canaletto's portfolio, as the painting omits the stone abutments that were added in 1751. To Hollis' right is Thomas Brand, his lifelong friend and heir. Further to the right, dressed in colourful livery, is Hollis' servant, Francesco Giovannini, and at the feet of Hollis is his dog, Malta. Seated a little distance from the central group on the left (with a cow looking over his shoulder) is an artist thought to be Canaletto himself. In the river a ship is lowering its sail in order to pass under the bridge. With the towering storm clouds forming above the bridge, Canaletto contrasts the forces of nature with the work of engineering below; the painting is the only one of his English works in which he attempts to capture the weather. Samuel Dicker's house at Mount Felix can be seen in the rear of the picture to the left of the bridge, but Dicker ‚Äî probably after seeing Hollis's painting ‚Äî commissioned a different view of the bridge from Canaletto in 1755 in which his house can be seen more clearly and the full extent of the bridge works that he had funded (including the extensive stone abutments) is obvious. The painting is normally kept by the Dulwich Picture Gallery.A View of Walton Bridge BBC ‚Äì Arts ‚Äì Your Paintings Canaletto courtesy of Dulwich Picture Gallery Retrieved 2013-07-08 Notes References   External links * A View of Walton Bridge (Canaletto, 1754) at the Dulwich Picture Gallery * Old Walton Bridge (Canaletto, 1755) at the Yale Center for British Art * Canaletto, exhibition catalogue from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, including material on Canaletto's pictures Category:Bridges across the River Thames Category:Bridges in Surrey Category:Bridges completed in 1750 Category:Former toll bridges in the United Kingdom Category:Truss bridges Category:Demolished bridges in England Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 1783 Category:History of Middlesex ","title":"Old Walton Bridge"},{"id":"9492186","text":"Shrewsbury Abbey was a railway station in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, England part of the Shropshire and Montgomeryshire Railway. It was named after the nearby Shrewsbury Abbey. The station had an adjacent goods yard and wagon building works. Shrewsbury Abbey was originally planned to be just one station on a railway from Llanymynech to Market Drayton but when financial problems halted the project, it became the permanent terminus. However it was never connected to Shrewsbury Station. All passenger services would have to change here. This was because access to the mainline station was rejected on financial grounds and the obstruction of Shrewsbury station's joint operators, the Great Western Railway (GWR) and the London and North Western Railway. History 1872-74 'Potts' train at Abbey Station behind a Bury, Curtis and Kennedy 0-4-2 locomotive Shrewsbury Abbey station opened on 13 August 1866 as the temporary end of the Potteries, Shrewsbury and North Wales Railway (always known locally as 'The Potts'). It was built on part of a monastery that had been destroyed during the Reformation. In 1876 a railway carriage and wagon building works of the Midland Wagon Company operated next to the station. It closed in 1912. When the station became the permanent terminus after financial difficulties caused the abandonment of the planned extension to Market Drayton, it struggled to make money. On 22 June 1880 Shrewsbury Abbey closed for the first time when the railway could no longer continue services; a rare example of a railway closure in Britain in the 19th century. Several attempts were made to reopen the railway and in the 1890/91 a start was made on remodelling the station before financial problems again caused work to cease. The station was finally reopened on 13 April 1911 with a rebuilt line now known as the Shropshire and Montgomeryshire Railway. It finally closed to all passengers (except specials) on 6 November 1933. Wartime role At the outbreak of World War II, the Shropshire and Montgomeryshire Light Railway was taken over by the War Department. Shrewsbury Abbey station reopened for military personnel in 1941. The Royal Engineers reconstructed the railway and built a top secret storage explosives depot at Kinnerley. The site was not declassified until the 1950s. The entire railway was closed by the military in 1960. Later use After Shrewsbury Abbey station closed, the goods yard was occupied by an oil depot until its closure on 5 July 1988. The site is now occupied by a surface car park, and the original station building and platform built for the Shropshire and Montgomeryshire has been restored.

Founded in 1846, the museum covers the county of Dorset's history and environment. The current building was built in 1881 on the former site of the George Inn. The building was designed specifically to house the museum's collection and is in the neo-Gothic style. The museum includes information and over 2 million artifacts associated with archaeology (e.g., Maiden Castle), geology (e.g., the Jurassic Coast), history, local writers (e.g. Thomas Hardy) and natural science. There are video displays, activity carts for children, and an audio guide. The collections include fossilised dinosaur footprints, Roman mosaics and original Thomas Hardy manuscripts. Museum The museum was founded in 1846, and includes two significant collections, the archive of Thomas Hardy's works and fossils from the Jurassic Coast. The total collection extends to approximately four million items. The museum is owned by the Dorset Natural History and Archaeological Society. Many items in the museum's collection have been stored at the nearby All Saints' Church. The museum was receiving approximately 45,000 visitors each year in 2014, which had increased to 47,000 visitors each year in 2016. TripAdvisor has awarded its Certificate of Excellence Award to the museum for four years in a row. In 2016, the museum unveiled plans for a ¬£13 million extension which would include a learning centre, cafe, library and shop, allowing the Dorset Natural History and Archaeological Society's full collection to hold together in one building. Three quarters of the funding for the extension would be put forward by the Heritage Lottery Fund, allowing much more of the collection to be viewed. Without the extension, less than two percent of the museum's collection is on display. =Exhibits= Thomas Hardy was one of the founders of the museum, and over seven thousand artefacts related to him are in the museum's collection, including an 1874 first edition copy of Far From The Madding Crowd. Other items in the Hardy archive include his handwritten manuscript for The Woodlanders, his sister's dress which is thought to be inspiration for the dress in Tess of the d'Urbervilles, and a reconstruction of Hardy's study. The Ancient Dorset Gallery was opened by Julian Richards in November 2015 and includes Viking historical artefacts from a nearby burial site. Other artefacts include pre-historic flint hand axes, a Roman glass bowl and an Iron Age bronze mirror. The British Museum loaned three neolithic jadeite axes and mace heads to the museum to add to the display. In July 2016, the museum opened a gallery dedicated to the work of William Barnes, telling the story of his humble roots to his legacy in poetry, novels and music. The gallery was opened by Bonny Sartin, lead singer of The Yetties.

Built from Portland stone in approximately 1881, it was designed by architects G R Crickmay and Son from Weymouth. The building is two storeys high with a slate roof, it has two stringcourses on the gently sloped walls, with hood moulds over the windows and a crenellated parapet. The frontage includes a 2-storey bay with 7 transom windows. At the top of the bay there is a trefoil-headed panel displaying the Dorchester coat of arms. The cast-iron columns and the other metalwork in the aisled Victorian Hall were cast in Frome by Edward Cockey & Sons. On the first floor there is an oriel window in the corner, above carved squinches. The door is to the left of the bay, displaying three coats of arms above. The building was designated Grade II listed building status on 8 May 1975, as part of a group with the nearby Shire Hall, Holy Trinity Church and St. Peter's Church.

Born into a family of plantation farmers in Kerala in 1930, he left home at the young age of 8 and traveled to all corners of India. He found his passion in the martial arts and acting. He was an expert and authority in varma kalai, the art of hitting pressure points in kalaripayat. Simhalan Panicker learned the northern and southern styles of kalaripayat during 18 years of training under many teachers, and specialized in varma kalari which he learned from Balan Gurukkal. From then on, he practiced the art, improvising and developing his own version of it. Using his background as a trained dancer, boxer and street fighter, he carried the art form into its highest level of expression. He created Simhala Kalari in 1975. He was associated with contemporary martial artists like Chandrashekharan Gurukkal and Vallabhatta Vishwanathan Gurukkal. Notable disciples are Moses Thilak, Master Manoharan and Karate Mani. Panicker was secretive about his varma kalari skills and has taught very few students, all of them renowned masters in southern India. In 1983 he was featured as a 'most dangerous man' in Chennai in The Way of the Warrior: Martial Arts and Fighting Styles from Around the World, a book that was the basis for a TV documentary released by the BBC which presents various martial art forms of the world. Simhalan Panicker's interests extended beyond martial arts. He was also an actor of theater and film, with more than 175 movies to his credit. He taught at the Film and TV Institute of Tamil Nadu, Chennai. He moved back to Kerala in 1998, where he continued practicing Simhala Kalari. He died in March 2004. He is survived by his wife Chinnamma and daughter Jasmine Simhalan, a noted kalaripayat and silambam exponent living in the UK.

This was the first of three national championship squads for head coach Barry Switzer. Only one opponent played the Sooners within 14 points and four failed to score a touchdown. At the same time, OU led the nation in scoring offense with an average of 43 points per game to finish the season as the only undefeated team in the country at 11-0\\\\. Oklahoma was loaded with talent, evidenced by its eight All- Americans, the most of any season to that point. OU's wishbone offense, triggered by running back Joe Washington, fullback Jim Littrell, and quarterback Steve Davis, averaged 73.9 rushing attempts per game, which still stands as an NCAA single-season record, as does its 21.4 rushing first downs per game. Oklahoma also featured a tough defense led by senior All-American Rod Shoate, a swift and punishing linebacker, and a defensive front consisting of brothers Lee Roy and Dewey Selmon, and Jimbo Elrod. Because Oklahoma was on NCAA probation for recruiting violations, it was ineligible for ranking in the Coaches Poll and could not appear on network television or appear in a postseason bowl game. Nevertheless, the Sooners opened the '74 season as the top-ranked team in the AP Poll, the first time since 1957 that OU debuted at #1 and the first time in 11 years that Oklahoma sat atop the poll. Despite being a 43-point favorite against Baylor, the Sooners struggled in their season opener, needing three fourth-quarter touchdowns to secure a 28-11 victory. Baylor recovered from this loss and enjoyed a stellar season, winning the Southwest Conference championship under third-year coach Grant Teaff. The win didn't impress AP voters, and OU dropped to #3 behind Ohio State and Notre Dame. The Sooners quickly rebounded by destroying Utah State and Wake Forest in back-to-back weeks by a combined score of 135-3\\\\. Eight Sooners scored touchdowns against Utah State, while nine players found the end zone against the Demon Deacons. Next up for the Sooners was the Red River Shootout, and the Texas Longhorns presented Oklahoma's toughest challenge yet. Trailing 13-7 in the fourth quarter, OU dug into its bag of tricks with a reverse to split end Billy Brooks, who scampered 40 yards down the sideline for a touchdown. The ensuing extra point attempt by Sooner kicker John Carroll was ruled no good, leaving the game tied at 13-13\\\\. Oklahoma's defense rose to the challenge, led by Shoate, who finished the game with 21 tackles, two pass breakups, a forced fumble, and a fumble recovery. The last statistic was the critical one, as the Sooners forced a Texas fumble on the next possession, which Shoate recovered at the 50. A 37-yard field goal from Tony DiRienzo minutes later was the difference. \\"This was as close as a game can be\\", coach Switzer said afterward. A testament to how hard the game was fought, OU offensive tackle Mike Vaughan reportedly passed out from exhaustion following the game. The Sooners followed their victory over Texas with a pair of blowouts over #16 Colorado, 49-14, and Kansas State, 63-0\\\\. Joe Washington rushed for 200 yards and four touchdowns against the Buffaloes, while eight players found the end zone versus the Wildcats. After a sloppy performance on a soggy field in a 28-10 win at Iowa State, Oklahoma shutout a tough Missouri squad 37-0, a team that had beaten Nebraska and scored 82 points in its previous two games. OU's third shutout of the season ran its record to 8-0 as top-ranked Ohio State was upset by Michigan State, 16-13\\\\. Oklahoma regained the #1 ranking and, following a 45-14 win over Kansas, traveled to Lincoln with a Big Eight Conference title on the line. OU changed its defense for the game against Nebraska, using man-to-man coverage instead of zone. The move paid dividends as the Sooners intercepted four passes, including three by Randy Hughes, while the offense rolled up 482 yards on the ground despite not completing a single pass in the contest. The victory earned Oklahoma its second straight Big Eight Championship with one game remaining against Oklahoma State. Against the Cowboys, OU faced a 13-10 deficit late in the third quarter before scoring five touchdowns during a seven-and-a-half-minute span. The 44-13 victory marked OU's 20th consecutive win and 29th straight game without a loss. When Alabama fell to Notre Dame in the Orange Bowl, the Sooners were left as the nation's only unbeaten team. With a #1 ranking in the final AP Poll, OU laid claim to its fourth national championship and first since 1956. To date, the 1974 Sooners are the last NCAA Division I-A team to claim an AP national title without benefit of a postseason bowl win.

A local option sales tax is often used as a means of raising funds for specific local or area projects, such as improving area streets and roads, or refurbishing a community's downtown area. LOSTs are always appended onto a state's base sales tax rate, most commonly at a rate of 1%. For example, in Iowa, the base sales tax rate is 6% statewide, or six cents per dollar. If a city or county in Iowa were to implement a local option sales tax, this would result in a 7% sales tax rate, or seven cents per dollar. Since a LOST is implemented at city or county level, they apply only within the city or county in which it was implemented. Using the Iowa example, this means that any neighboring cities or counties would remain at 6% sales tax, unless they implement their own LOST. A LOST most often (if not always) requires a passing vote by the general public before they can be implemented. Once implemented, a LOST is often levied for only temporary time periods, such as five years. As the expiration date approaches, another vote may be presented to the public, giving the options of either extending the LOST (for any other projects), or letting the LOST expire and discontinue. Some states include multiple types of LOSTs depending on their intended purpose. For example, in Iowa, a standard LOST is used for city or county improvement purposes, whereas a SILO (School Infrastructure Local Option) tax is often used to build new schools, improve existing school buildings, or other educational purposes. Since a standard LOST and SILO are considered different types of taxes, regardless of them both being forms of local option sales taxes, it is possible for a city or county to implement both simultaneously (Using the Iowa example, this would yield an 8% sales tax within that city or county).

Initially, the two men involved were charged as adults with first-degree rape. First defendant, Michael Wilson, pleaded guilty to second-degree rape and was sentenced to 18 months. Maouloud Baby's first trial ended in a mistrial. In his second trial, he was convicted of the state crimes of first-degree rape, first-degree sexual offense and third-degree sexual offense. Baby appealed on the grounds that the trial judge had refused to answer questions from the jury on whether rape includes consensual intercourse that becomes non-consensual. In 2006 the Maryland Court of Special Appeals held that the judge should have answered in the negative, reversed Baby's convictions, and remanded the case for re-trial. The prosecution cross-appealed to the state Court of Appeals. That court held in 2007 that the judge should have answered in the positive: \\"Post-penetration withdrawal of consent negates initial consent for the purposes of sexual offense crimes and, when coupled with the other elements, may constitute the crime of rape\\" - but affirmed the reversal of conviction and remand due to court error. J.L's testimony As detailed in court testimony quoted in the Court of Appeals opinion, on December 13, 2003, Maouloud Baby (1988- ), age 15, and a classmate, Michael Wilson, were students at Watkins Mill High School in Montgomery Village, Maryland. They drove to a residential area with an 18-year-old woman who attended Montgomery College. Baby and Wilson knew the woman socially. After the woman parked the car, Baby and Wilson asked her to sit between them in the back seat of the car. After she did they began touching her sexually. They told her that she would not be able to leave until \\"they finished whatever they told [her] to do\\". Baby got out of the car and Wilson had sexual intercourse with her. Then Baby got back in and had a brief conversation with the woman. When asked if she felt like she had a choice whether or not to have intercourse with him, she said \\"Not really. I don't know. Something just clicked off and I just did whatever they said.\\" Baby then said \\"So are you going to let me hit it?\\" She replied \\"As long as [you] stop when I tell [you] to.\\" She said the intercourse was becoming painful and she asked him to stop and he stopped about 5 seconds later and did not ejaculate. All three returned to the McDonald's restaurant in Montgomery Village where they had been earlier that day. Before leaving, the woman and Wilson hugged, and she gave Baby her telephone number. Hours later she told a friend's mother what had happened and the police were called. Baby and Wilson's testimony Baby and Wilson differed in large parts with the above testimony. They stated that at no time were they together in the back seat of the car, nor did they say she wouldn't be allowed to leave the car at any time. Baby and Wilson maintained that she was in the front passenger seat for the entire duration of the incident, and could have \\"easily left the car if she wanted to\\". After Wilson had had sexual intercourse with J.L, Baby returned to the car and took his place in the drivers seat. At which point he asked J.L \\"So are you going to let me hit it?\\" She replied \\"As long as [you] stop when I tell [you] to.\\" He stated that once he had put the condom on, he couldn't get his penis into her vagina: \\"...it wouldn't go in, and I tried a couple more times and it wouldn't go in. I didn't feel nothing there\\". \\"And then she sat up. She was like, \\"It's not going to go in,\\" and that's when, after she sat up and said \\"It's not going to go in,\\" that's when I took off the condom and I put it in my pocket and then knocked on the window for Michael to come in.\\" He further testified that he had never had sexual intercourse before the incident. He was aged 15 when the incident took place. Courts The jury in the trial court convicted Baby of first degree rape and related charges, but the Court of Special Appeals, based upon a 1980 precedent that held that a rape could not legally occur if a woman withdrew consent after penetration, reversed the conviction. That precedent interpreted the English common law such that the withdrawal of consent following initial penetration did not make the act a rape. The court noted other states had noted that the act of intercourse is not completed at the initial penetration, and so consent could be withdrawn at any point during intercourse. For rape, the court noted that force or threat of force was a necessary element of the crime. Due to issues involving the instructions to the jury regarding rape and consent, the case was remanded for a new trial. In 2008, the Court of Appeals affirmed the Court of Special Appeals' reversal of the convictions and remand for re-trial, due to the trial court's error in failing to answer the jury's questions about whether a sex act continued after the withdrawal of consent could constitute rape if penetration had already occurred. However, the court ruled that consent could be withdrawn at any time, even if the victim had initially consented.

Miguel Antonio Caro Dead. New York Times Caro did not attend college or university. Nevertheless, as autodidact, he was very well versed in economics, world history and literature, social science, jurisprudence, linguistics and philology. He was also well known as great orator, debater and poet. Also, as a scholar, he translated several of the works of Virgil from Latin. He was appointed as Director of the National Library, was elected to congress, and founded of the Academia Colombiana de la Lengua.Arismendi Posada, Ignacio; Gobernantes Colombianos, trans.

The significant achievement gave him an enormous prestige in the political realm.Arismendi Posada, Ignacio; Gobernantes Colombianos, trans. Colombian Presidents; Interprint Editors Ltd., Italgraf, Segunda Edici√≥n; Page 134; Bogot√°, Colombia; 1983 During the presidential election of 1892, the Colombian Conservative Party was divided in two movements: traditionalists and nationalists. The nationalists nominated Rafael N√∫√±ez as candidate for President and Caro as Vice-President. The traditionalists nominated Marcelino V√©lez and Jos√© Joaqu√≠n Ortiz. The liberals did not participate. Obviously, the conservatives won, and the nationalists outnumbered the traditionalists. Thus, N√∫√±ez and Caro were elected for the 1892-1898 presidential term.Arismendi Posada, Ignacio; Gobernantes Colombianos, trans. Colombian Presidents; Interprint Editors Ltd., Italgraf, Segunda Edici√≥n; p. 135; Bogot√°, Colombia; 1983  Presidency  N√∫√±ez had expressed his clear desire not to be inaugurated but to retire to his native city of Cartagena. Nevertheless, Caro insisted for N√∫√±ez had to be inaugurated as president before retiring. Thus, N√∫√±ez accepted and was inaugurated in Cartagena and then immediately resigned. Therefore, Caro, as vice-president, began acting as President. Caro never used the title of President but the one of Vice President of Colombia in charge of the Executive Office. Although he was the legitimate and constitutional president of Colombia, he did so to show respect to his mentor Rafael N√∫√±ez whose illness had forced him to cede day-to-day power.Arismendi Posada, Ignacio; Gobernantes Colombianos, trans. Colombian Presidents; Interprint Editors Ltd., Italgraf, Segunda Edici√≥n; p. 137; Bogot√°, Colombia; 1983 The vehement adversion and tenacious opposition from the liberals and traditionalists conservatives to his government made Caro impose a severe censorship law against the opposition. On August 4, 1893, by decree and invoking the law 61 of 1888, known as the law of the horses, he muzzled the opposition newspapers and curtailed the freedom of the press. In a subsequent decree, Caro shut down the major opposition and liberal newspapers El Redactor and El Contenpor√°neoand expelled its directors Santiago P√©rez de Manosalbas and Modesto Garc√©s. Other opposition leaders and activists were incarcerated. During the six years as president, Caro had to crush three coup attempts by the liberals. On January 22, 1894, the Colombian Liberal Party launched a major offensive against the government of Caro. With its principal leaders spelled out of the country or detained, its newspapers closed and the freedom of the press and freedom of association suspended, the party found no other alternative but to start a civil war. This revolt rapidly extended throughout the country, mainly in the states of Boyac√°, Cauca, Cundinamarca, Bol√≠var (Bol√≠var Department), Tolima and Santander (Norte de Santander Department). Even though the rebels had been aided by foreign countries, they were promptly defeated by the armies of President Caro. On March 15, 1895, the civil war came to an end at the battle of ‚ÄúEnciso‚Äù, in Santander. Almost a year later, in January 1896, the traditionalists sent to Caro a very stern admonition, known as the \\"Manifesto of the 21\\", expressing their discontent and disapproval of the affairs of his administration. The manifesto's main signatory was Carlos Mart√≠nez Silva, and 20 other prominent dignitaries and political leaders. They urged Caro to lift martial law, reinstate civil liberties and have a magnanimous approach towards the liberals. Caro was so disillusioned and offended by this that he resigned the presidency on March 12, 1896. Caro appointed General Guillermo Quintero Calder√≥n to replace him and retired to his family retreat in Sop√≥. General Quintero Calder√≥n designated Abraham Moreno, of the opposition group, as Minister of Government. That infuriated Caro, and he retook his office of the presidency on March 17, 1896.Arismendi Posada, Ignacio; Gobernantes Colombianos, trans.

He is the host of The Savage Nation, a nationally syndicated talk show that aired on Talk Radio Network across the United States until 2012, and in 2009 was the second most listened-to radio talk show in the country with an audience of over 20 million listeners on 400 stations across the United States. Since October 23, 2012, Michael Savage has been syndicated by Cumulus Media Networks. He holds master's degrees from the University of Hawaii in medical botany and medical anthropology, and a Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley in nutritional ethnomedicine. As Michael Weiner, he has written books on nutrition, herbal medicine, and homeopathy; as Michael Savage, he has written several political books that have reached The New York Times Best Seller list. Savage has summarized his political philosophy in three words: borders, language, and culture. He has characterized his views as conservative nationalism, while critics have characterized them as \\"fostering extremism.\\" He supports the English-only movement and argues that liberalism and progressivism are degrading American culture. Although his radio delivery is mainly characterized as politically- themed, he also often covers topics such as medicine, nutrition, music, literature, history, theology, philosophy, sports, business, economics, and culture, and tells personal anecdotes. In 2009 Savage was placed on a list of people banned from entering the United Kingdom for life by British Home Secretary for \\"seeking to provoke others to serious criminal acts and fostering hatred.\\"Document quotes: \\"Home Office name promoters of hate excluded from the United Kingdom,\\" Savage \\"seeking to provoke others to serious criminal acts and fostering hatred which might lead to inter-community violence.\\"BBC: \\"US 'hate list' DJ to sue Britain\\" May 6, 2009 Early life and education Savage was born Michael Alan Weiner in the Bronx, New York, one of three children of Benjamin and Rae Weiner, Jewish emigrants from Russia. He described his childhood as difficult, with a \\"gruff, profane\\" father who would frequently criticize and belittle him. His younger brother, Jerome, was born with developmental disabilities and was unable to hear or speak. Jerome died in 1969. His father, the owner of an antiques shop, died of a heart attack at age 57 in 1970, and his mother died in 2003. After graduating from Jamaica High School in 1958, Savage attended Queens College, where he earned a bachelor's degree in biology in 1963. After college, Savage taught high school for several years in New York City. His first marriage in 1964 to Carol Ely ended in divorce, and he remarried in 1967 after meeting his current wife, Janet. During this time Savage also worked for famous psychedelic drug advocate Timothy Leary as keeper of the stone gatehouse on the Hitchcock Cattle Company estate in Millbrook, New York, to which Leary had been given access. Leary hired him to the post because Savage did not use LSD. Savage then studied at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, earning a Master of Science in botany in 1970 and a Master of Arts in anthropology in 1972. He obtained a PhD in 1978 from the University of California, Berkeley, in nutritional ethnomedicine. His thesis was titled Nutritional Ethnomedicine in Fiji. Shift in political opinions Savage introduced himself to certain writers in the North Beach neighborhood of San Francisco in the 1970s. He befriended and traveled with Beat poets Allen Ginsberg and Lawrence Ferlinghetti. Savage maintained a correspondence with Ginsberg consisting of ten letters and three postcards across four years, which is maintained with Ginsberg's papers at Stanford University. One letter asked for Ginsberg and Ferlinghetti to come do a poetry reading, so others could \\"hear and see and know why I adore your public image.\\" Another acquaintance was poet and author Neeli Cherkovski, who says that Savage dreamed of becoming a stand-up comic in the mold of Lenny Bruce. Acquaintance Robert Cathcart says that by 1980, in his private conversations with Savage, he knew him to have conservative political views. Schwartz stated Savage became alienated from the North Beach scene in the early 1980s. Savage had intense arguments with his liberal friends. When asked about his shift in politics and other views, Savage replied, \\"I was once a child; I am now a man.\\" Savage has cited many occurrences in his life that helped shape his conservative views. Savage states that his opinions on welfare were partly shaped by his first job out of college as a social worker. He described one incident in which his supervisor had him deliver a check to a welfare client to furnish their apartment, while his own apartment was furnished with cardboard boxes. Another turning point occurred for him as a writer of health and nutrition books in the 1980s, when he experienced what he saw as \\"political opposition\\" after making the suggestion that the closure of homosexual bathhouses might be necessary in response to the emerging HIV/AIDS epidemic. In 1994 his final health and nutrition manuscript, Immigrants and Epidemics, was rejected by publishers for being inflammatory. In 1996, Savage applied to become the Dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at the University of California, Berkeley. The University instead selected award- winning journalist and China scholar Orville Schell. Savage sued the University, contending discrimination for being conservative. Savage later dropped the lawsuit. Career as commentator =Radio= The rejection by publishers of his 1994 manuscript about illegal immigration and epidemics prompted Savage to record a demo tape with a mock radio talk show about the contents of the work. He mailed this tape to 250 radio stations in an attempt to change careers and become a radio talk show host. On March 21, 1994, Savage began his radio career on KGO (a San Francisco news/talk radio station) as a fill-in host for liberal Ray Taliaferro's overnight show and later as a weekend host. At the time, his slogan was \\"To the right of Rush and to the left of God.\\" The show quickly became a local hit. Later in 1994, KGO parent company Capital Cities/ABC Inc. purchased the station KSFO and changed it to a conservative talk format. On January 2, 1995, the first day of KSFO's new format, Savage debuted as host of afternoon drive time show The Savage Nation. By 2000, Savage was the most popular afternoon drive host among all adults in San Francisco Arbitron ratings. In 1999, Talk Radio Network began syndicating part of The Savage Nation nationally. Starting September 21, 2000, The Savage Nation became an entirely national show distributed by TRN. In mid 2006, Savage had 8‚Äì10 million listeners per week, which made his show the third most widely heard broadcast in the United States at that time. Savage has described his listeners as \\"literate callers with intelligence, wit, and energy.\\" He has described his show's production as one with a \\"... hard edge combined with humor and education ... Those who listen to me say they hear a bit of Plato, Henry Miller, Jack Kerouac, Moses, Jesus, and Frankenstein.\\" Mark de la Vi√±a of the San Jose Mercury News wrote of Savage: \\"In contrast to Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity and Laura Schlessinger, Bay Area-based Savage mixes conservative diatribe and blunt observations with acerbic humor and the gift of gab.\\" By 2009, The Savage Nation had an audience of 8 to 10 million listeners on 400 stations across the United States, making it the second most listened-to radio talk show in the country at the time. Around that time, Savage asked his audience for their opinion prior to consenting to a profile interview by Kelefa Sanneh of The New Yorker; Savage eventually accepted that offer and the New Yorker profile, titled \\"Party of One\\", was published in the August 3, 2009, issue, which covered Savage's life and personality in great detail. On September 10, 2009, KNEW-AM (910 kHz) in Savage's home market of San Francisco announced that it was dropping his program and replacing him with John and Ken from sister station KFI-AM (640 kHz)/Los Angeles. John Scott, program director of KNEW said in an e-mail that the station was headed \\"... in a different philosophical and ideological direction, featuring more contemporary content and more local information.\\" According to Arbitron monthly ratings, KNEW-AM dropped in the ratings since Savage was let go. San Francisco station KTRB picked up the program for the San Francisco market, and saw a ratings boost in the afternoon drive. However, the program was among the first casualties when KTRB went into receivership in September 2010. On January 22, 2010, Savage revealed to his audience that a writer for Playboy had contacted him via email to do a lengthy interview, and again asked his listeners if he should accept the offer. During the show, Savage read from personal emails between the Playboy writer and himself. The writer admitted to being a listener of the Savage Nation but a critic of the profile done by The New Yorker. The writer also stated that the purpose of the interview was to \\"rattle\\" Playboys readers. On May 12, 2010, Savage revealed that he had granted the interview at his home. Playboy published the interview in June 2010. . He read from a pre- publication copy of the 8,000-word Playboy interview, in which the writer expressed animosity for Savage and his views. Savage said that he was disappointed at the lack of journalistic objectivity, but did not harbor hatred for the writer. He referred back to the New Yorker interview by Kelefa Sanneh, and praised Sanneh as a \\"real writer\\" who had understood his subject. On September 27, 2012, Savage's talk show left the airwaves after he won a legal battle with Talk Radio Network, his longtime employer, and his attorney said discussions with new networks were under way. Savage began an occasional series of video webcasts via Ustream on September 30, 2012. On October 17, 2012, Savage and his new syndicator Cumulus Media Networks announced that they had made a deal and the program, after several weeks off the air, would be returning as of October 23, 2012.Marcucci, Carl.

Savage was hired by MSNBC president Erik Sorenson to do the one-hour show despite Savage's previous criticism of the network in his book The Savage Nation and the objections of NBC employees. Sorenson called Savage \\"brash, passionate and smart,\\" and promised that he would provide \\"compelling opinion and analysis with an edge.\\" After four months, Savage was fired from the show after remarks made in response to a caller, later identified as prank caller Bob Foster, caused controversy in the gay community. Read full account in the \\"Criticism\\" section below.  The COVID-19 Pandemic & Positions on Vaccines  A January 31, 2020 article in Stat News quoted Savage's call for a stop to flights from China: ‚ÄúQUARANTINE! STOP TRAVELERS FROM CHINA NOW!\\" Two months later, a April 16, 2020 New York Times feature article credited Savage for being one of the first in the media, especially the conservative media, to take the COVID-19 epidemic seriously. On his radio show Savage used his credentials -- a Ph.D with training in epidemiology -- to speak to his fans on coronavirus research: How the virus is transmitted; which treatments were proving effective; and the difference between morbidity and mortality rates. \\"Savage's views were a departure from those of other conservative commentators, who made a concerted effort to deny that they downplayed the epidemic. Savage attacked their credibility and demanded that they be held accountable for misleading millions of Americans.\\" As early as February 24, 2020 Savage was saying of Limbaugh and Hannity: ‚ÄúHow can we not let our side be called on the carpet when they lie to the people?‚Äù Savage is also sharply critical of the Director of the NIAID, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, dismissing him as ‚Äúa grandstander‚Äù who mishandled the AIDS epidemic by refusing to close down the gay bathhouses. Savage believes that one-size-fits-all lockdowns are a threat to individual liberty, and calls instead for selective quarantine of at-risk populations. In a May 4, 2020 article in the Washington Examiner, Savage is quoted as saying he will refuse to take a coronavirus vaccine, saying that it will likely be \\"ineffective and dangerous.\\" Savage has a history of opposing the flu vaccine, for reasons he outlined in a January 15, 2013 interview. Savage argued that the Centers for Disease Control authorities have to guess what the vaccine should be made of. ‚ÄúSo they choose five strains out of 250-plus strains of Influenza A, and if they don‚Äôt choose the right one, you‚Äôre going to get sick,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre putting your faith in the CDC‚Äôs ability to guess the one that might be a pandemic.\\" He said that \\"this year\\" (2013), the CDC guessed right on two of the strains and wrong on one of them. In contrast to his views on the flu vaccine, Savage supports vaccines, such as for polio, that last for many years because they address an infectious agent with a low mutation rate. A 2013 Ethics Alarms article recounts Savage saying that \\"...one of his heroes growing up was Jonas Salk, not because he invented the first effective polio vaccine, but because he refused to patent it, and gave it to the world for the benefit of humanity. A bit later, Savage noted that Albert Sabin, Salk‚Äôs bitter rival who later invented the oral vaccine, also declined to profit from his invention. Could all this be true, I wondered? If it is true, why did I not know about it? Why doesn‚Äôt everybody know about it? It is true. Asked why he didn‚Äôt patent his vaccine, Salk famously answered, ‚ÄúCan you patent the sun?‚Äù Savage vehemently opposes wearing mask to slow the spread of COVID 19 in both indoor and outdoor settings. Recently, he accepted wearing mask in an indoor public places but call out people who wear mask when jogging, biking or driving as \\"idiotic, moronic, fools\\". Political views Michael Savage calls himself an \\"independent-minded individualist\\" and says that he \\"fits no stereotype.\\" As a young man, Savage was inspired by John F. Kennedy and his positive vision for America. In a 2019 50th-Anniversary tribute to the Apollo Moon project, Savage said: \\"President John F. Kennedy set the goal in motion and never lived to see the lunar landing. At the time I was a very young man. I was deeply affected by Kennedy's speeches and by the race to the moon.\\" In an interview thirteen years earlier, Savage had cited Barry Goldwater as an influence as well, saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a Goldwater conservative‚Ä¶. If [another] Goldwater appeared, I‚Äôd work for him, I‚Äôd give money to him\\" Savage criticizes big government as well as liberalism and liberal activism, and accuses the mainstream news media of liberal bias. He considers the three aspects that define a nation as borders, language, and culture; those aspects inspired the motto of the Paul Revere Society. =Wildlife conservation= Savage is a longtime advocate of wildlife conservation, and often points out that \\"conservative\\" and \\"conservation\\" have the same root, meaning \\"to conserve\\". He argues that conservatives should \\"own\\" environmental protection and conservation of wildlife resources. A December 2017 Huffington Post article quotes Savage regarding President Trump's revoking of an Obama-era trophy hunting ban: \\"... long-time animal activist Michael Savage ... implored the president to reconsider: 'Not all Obama legislation was bad,‚Äù said Savage. 'Some of it (like this) was grand.' \\" The article continues ... \\"Savage also addressed the (biblical) aspects of killing an elephant, lion or giraffe, animals that we don‚Äôt normally hunt. 'Dominion over animals doesn‚Äôt mean destroying or terrorizing them,' he said.\\" A March 2018 article at The Hill quotes him at greater length: \\"Conservative radio host Michael Savage has also spoken out against the Fish & Wildlife Service proposed policy this week, writing in a blog post Wednesday that he 'felt betrayed' by the administration‚Äôs secret decision after having previously spoken in person with Trump on the issue. 'I had spent a dinner talking to the President about environmental issues, and especially this, and this is what happened anyway,' Savage wrote. 'I made it clear that this was a red line that could not be crossed, that now elephants, lions and other big game had a target painted on them. I explained that the root of ‚Äòconservative‚Äô is the same as ‚Äòconservation‚Äô and the two do not need to be diametrically opposed. I explained what was meant by dominion, as I carefully spelled out in God Faith and Reason.' 'We hope that the president will step in here and overrule this order,' he added.' The private meeting with President Donald Trump at Mar-a- Lago followed a series of pleas on his radio show for Trump to support legislation that protected wildlife. In August 2019, following the Trump administration's reauthorization of the use of cyanide bombs against wild animals, Savage called on the White House and the US Environmental Protection Agency to reverse approval. = Immigration = Savage opposes immigration, saying \\"Read my lips: no new immigrants.\\" He frequently warns that migrants carry diseases. On March 28, 2006, following pro-immigration rallies in California, he encouraged his listeners to burn Mexican flags to protest illegal immigration from Mexico. = European Union = Savage describes the European Union as \\"Hitler's dream of a united Europe under German control.\\" He equates Britain's vote to leave the Union with the Second World War, saying it was \\"in many ways the Battle of Britain all over again.\\" Savage foresees that, after Brexit, the E.U. risks igniting a civil war to gain total control of the population for their plans of \\"a new Soviet-style superstate, which have been long on the drawing books.\\" = Republican presidential candidates = Savage at Moffett Federal Airfield in 2019 before flying on Air Force One with President Donald Trump. In 2003, Savage said that he voted in 2000 for George W. Bush \\"quite reluctantly, incidentally.\\" In 2004, Savage and the Revere Society hosted a party at Schroeder's Cafe in San Francisco celebrating the re-election of Bush. Savage donated $5,600 to the campaign of Democratic candidate Jerry Brown in the 2006 California Attorney General election. Savage strongly supported Donald Trump, a regular guest on his talk show, since Trump's June 2015 announcement of his candidacy in the United States 2016 presidential election. Trump has claimed to be a listener and a fan of Savage's show, and an April 2016 Salon article described Savage as having been a major influence on Trump's campaign. Savage has disagreed strongly with some of Trump's actions and policies, including the appointment of John Bolton as National Security Advisor, the bombings of Syria, what Savage describes as a failure to get illegal immigration to the United States under control, and failure to protect endangered and vulnerable wild animals. Nevertheless, he has endorsed Trump for president in the 2020 United States presidential election. = Dubai Ports World controversy = In early 2006, the administration of President George W. Bush approved sale of a port security contract to a company, Dubai Ports World (DP World), headquartered in The United Arab Emirates (UAE). Michael Savage was highly influential in the defeat of the deal. On February 13, the first day it was reported in the news, ‚ÄúSavage used his radio show to attack the transfer of American homeland assets to a company owned by an Arab state.‚Äù Savage‚Äôs concerns were based in part on the fact that ‚Äútwo of the 9/11 suicide hijackers came from the United Arab Emirates, and much of the funding for the attacks flowed through United Arab Emirates banks.‚Äù On his February 17 radio show, Savage interviewed Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, a longtime nemesis with whom Savage otherwise agreed on the Dubai ports issue. The White House was listening to Savage: ‚ÄúThough the deal had received some newspaper attention before then, Mr. Savage's angry message raised early concerns inside the Bush White House about trouble ahead.\\" Savage and other opponents of the deal ‚Äúgenerated a wave of anger from Americans across the country that left lawmakers in Washington -- by their own admission -- following their constituents much more than leading them.‚Äù Lawmakers said the negative response from constituents was overwhelming. Congressional offices on Capitol Hill were deluged by phone calls and emails protesting the deal, and congressmen told of being pulled aside wherever they went in their districts. Rep. Don Manzullo, a Republican from Illinois who is chairman of the House subcommittee on small business, said \\"I got stopped all over the place,\\" he said. \\"People are big-time upset.\\" = White genocide = According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, Savage subscribes to the white genocide conspiracy theory, a white nationalist belief, which claims that white people are becoming extinct through forced assimilation or violent genocide. Savage blames Barack Obama and the Democratic Party for promoting the concept within the United States. He has claimed there is a \\"cultural genocide being promulgated against Caucasians\\". Activism =Legal defense contributions= Savage has regularly donated money toward the legal defense of the U.S. Marines accused of murdering civilians in Haditha, Iraq; occasionally, Savage will offer proceeds from any sales through his website. Savage had regular contact with the attorneys of the accused and criticizes their treatment at Camp Pendleton. Most recently, Savage has donated over $10,000 to the U.S. Marines Charity Defense Fund at the Thomas More Law Center On April 25, 2007, he pledged $1 for each copy of Healing Children Naturally and Reducing the Risk of Alzheimer's purchased from his website to be donated to the U.S. Marines Defense Fund. The Marines were ultimately found not guilty. Awards On March 26, 2020 Savage was named by President Trump to serve on the Board of Directors of The Presidio Trust. which teams with the National Park Service to manage the Presidio of San Francisco, the former military fort that is part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. Savage stated that he hopes \\"to help save this great legacy while also reminding the public of the military significance of this land.‚Äù On November 17, 2016, Savage was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame. Savage describes this event as \\"The capstone of my career.\\" On June 9, 2007, Talkers Magazine awarded Savage with the publication's annual \\"Freedom of Speech Award,\\" and he accepted it with a pre-recorded speech. Criticism In July 2005, former CBS reporter Bernard Goldberg ranked Savage as number 61 in his book 100 People Who Are Screwing Up America. Goldberg wrote that \\"Savage's brand of over-the-top bile ... puts him right in there with the angriest haters of the Left.\\" David Klinghoffer, a National Review columnist, speculated that The Savage Nation \\"is an act, a put-on.\\" Various progressive advocacy groups such as GLAAD and FAIR accuse Savage of racism, homophobia, transphobia, and Islamophobia because of his controversial statements about homosexuality, Islam, feminism, sex education, and immigration. On April 17, 2006, Savage was seriously criticized worldwide after he said on the topic of Muslims, \\"They say, 'Oh, there's a billion of them.' I said, 'So, kill 100 million of them, then there'll be 900 million of them.' I mean, would you rather die‚Äîwould you rather us die than them?\\" This was taken from an argument dealing with the possibility of a nuclear conflict in that region. This was repeated in the media after Savage was barred from entering the UK. In the wake of the actor Robin Williams' suicide, Savage said that suicide is an \\"aggressive act\\" that shows no consideration for loved ones left behind. The assertion prompted criticism. = Controversial MSNBC exchange = Savage was hired by MSNBC to do a one-hour show which began in March of 2003. Controversy arose four months later over remarks made in response to a caller who insulted Savage's teeth. Savage responded by asking if the caller was a \\"sodomite\\", and when the caller replied that he was, Savage said: > \\"Oh, so you're one of those sodomites. You should only get AIDS and die, you > pig; how's that? Why don't you see if you can sue me, you pig? You got > nothing better to do than to put me down, you piece of garbage? You got > nothing to do today? Go eat a sausage, and choke on it. Get trichinosis. Now > do we have another nice caller here who's busy because he didn't have a nice > night in the bathhouse who's angry at me today? Put another, put another > sodomite on ... no more calls? ... I don't care about these bums; they mean > nothing to me. They're all sausages.\\" The interchange created a firestorm of protest including calls for his firing by the LGBT group GLAAD. Savage apologized on his radio program and on his website. He explained that he believed that MSNBC had gone to commercial to cover the gaffe of the attempted sabotage by a prank caller and that he was off the air at the time of the offensive comments, despite the fact that clips of the segment show Savage going to commercial after he made the comments. He also said his remarks were meant only to insult the caller, not all people with AIDS. Nevertheless, MSNBC fired him within days of the event. =Catholic Church and immigration= In March 2006, Savage criticised Roman Catholic assistance to illegal immigrants (in response to statements by Cardinal Roger Mahony of Los Angeles calling it \\"pastoral support\\"). Bill Donohue of the Catholic League canceled an appearance on the show, saying \\"what is not fine is Savage's diatribe about the 'greedy pigs' in the Catholic Church and how 'the institution is rotten from the top to the bottom. =C-SPAN broadcast of Talkers Award= When Talkers Magazine awarded Savage with the publication's annual \\"Freedom of Speech Award,\\" C-SPAN opted not to broadcast a pre-recorded speech that had been sent by Savage. Although the award ceremony had received coverage in previous years, C-SPAN did not televise it due to its policy of televising such speeches only when delivered in person. Savage told his listeners to express their ire to C-SPAN through calls and e-mails to the organization. =Dispute with CAIR= In early November 2007, the Council on American‚ÄìIslamic Relations (CAIR) called on radio listeners to contact companies that advertise on Savage's program to express their concerns about his comments concerning Muslims. Savage was quoted as saying Muslims \\"need deportation\\", and that adherents of Islam would do well to \\"take your religion and shove it up your behind\\" because \\"I'm sick of you.\\" On his show and website, Savage answered by accusing CAIR of supporting Hamas. On November 5, 2007, following a campaign by CAIR meant to get Savage off the air by alerting his sponsors to the nature of his comments, Citrix Systems, Inc. pulled its advertisements from his show. Savage sued CAIR for copyright infringement for using excerpts from his show on CAIR's website.Judi McLeod, \\"One for Savage, zero for CAIR\\" , canadafreepress.com, December 11, 2007. The suit alleged that CAIR's repackaging of Savage's comments was \\"deliberately designed to obscure the specific message conveyed by Michael Savage\\". The excerpts included Savage's characterization of the Qur'an as \\"a throwback document\\" and a \\"book of hate\\". CAIR called the suit \\"bizarre, sloppy and baseless\\". On July 25, 2008, United States district court Judge Susan Illston dismissed Savage's suit against CAIR, holding that the posting of the audio clip was protected under fair use. The court gave Savage the opportunity to file an amended complaint if he wanted to try to cure the defects in his suit. That amended complaint alleged that CAIR was a RICO conspirator in support of terror, including the 9/11 terror attack on the World Trade Center. Permission was granted to allow that filing but on August 14, 2008, however, Savage's lawyer, Daniel Horowitz, announced that Savage would not file an amended complaint and would drop the case. CAIR then sought attorneys fees against Savage, Judge Illston denied that request. =Autism= In July 2008, Savage said that the increasing rate of autism diagnoses was the result of \\"a racket\\" designed to get disability payments for \\"poorer families who have found a new way to be parasites on the government.\\" He returned to the subject on his July 16, 2008, show with the following remarks: In July 2008 the progressive pressure group Media Matters for America picketed the studios of WOR in New York, along with parents of autistic children. WOR issued a statement saying, \\"We regret any consternation that his remarks may have caused to our listeners.\\" Also that day, the insurance company Aflac pulled its advertising, and the Supertalk Mississippi radio network dropped Savage's program, replacing it with The Dennis Miller Show. Later that evening, Savage devoted his entire three-hour program to the subject, taking calls from parents who took issue with his comments. On that show Savage stated that his remarks had been \\"ripped out of context\\" by \\"far left Stalinists\\" who want him off of the air. He appeared on Larry King Live with Glenn Beck as the substitute host for Larry King, and said that the real issue he was commenting on was the overdiagnosis of children due to pharmaceutical companies' drive to drug children for higher profits. On July 25, 2008, Autism United advocates gathered to announce that several advertisers, including RadioShack, Sears, The Home Depot, and DirectBuy, will discontinue their support for Savage's show. Savage's syndicator, Talk Radio Network, responded by releasing a lengthy statement, along with a selection of 20 audio clips drawn from Savage's discussions of autism, to show that the comments were taken out of context. =Ban from entering the United Kingdom= On May 5, 2009, it was announced by then-Home Secretary Jacqui Smith of the Labour party that Savage was on a list of people banned from entering the United Kingdom as he is \\"considered to be engaging in unacceptable behaviour by seeking to provoke others to serious criminal acts and fostering hatred which might lead to inter-community violence\\".US talkshow host Michael Savage to sue Jacqui Smith over ban from Britain Alex Spillius, telegraph.co.uk, May 6, 2009. During his radio broadcast on that same day, Savage declared that he would sue Smith personally for defamation, calling her a \\"lunatic\\". During a subsequent NPR talk show, Savage said that he has never advocated violence and repeatedly invoked the United States Constitution's First Amendment. After host Neal Conan pointed out that the U.S. Constitution does not apply to the United Kingdom, Savage replied, \\"No. Thank God I'm an American. But for this lunatic ... to link me up with Nazi skinheads who are killing people in Russia ... to put me in league with Hamas murderers who killed Jews on buses, is astonishing\\". Savage also called on his listeners to support him by canceling travel and business in Britain as well as by boycotting British-made goods, commenting, \\"If they want to play hardball, we'll play hardball.\\" When a caller challenged Savage about his talk show rhetoric, Savage called him a \\"foaming lunatic ... someone in pajamas in a mental asylum ... You're nobody and I'm not going to talk to you!\\" At that point, Neal Conan invited him to leave. Of the banning, the former Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, wrote: \\"America still has a constitutional protection of free speech, and I have been amazed ... to see how few people in this country are willing to stick up for that elementary principle ... a country once famous for free speech is now hysterically and expensively sensitive to anything that could be taken as a slight.\\" After Johnson became Prime Minister in 2019, Savage's attorney requested the ban be overturned, however no action has been taken by the Conservative government as of 2020. In The Guardian, Catherine Bennett wrote: \\"The ban on Savage is so far from being a comprehensible act, so staggeringly capricious and stupid, as to defy evaluation.\\" Sam Leith wrote: \\"Barring this shock-jock from Britain risks turning a rabid blabbermouth into a beacon for free speech.\\" =Veteran PTSD= On October 14, 2014, Savage criticized veteran sufferers of posttraumatic stress disorder, accusing them of \\"weakness\\". According to Savage, \\"Everyone has depression in their life. But if the whole nation is told, 'boo-hoo-hoo, come and get a medication, come and get treatment, talk about mental illness.' You know what you wind up with? You wind up with Obama in the White House and liars in every phase of the government. That's what you wind up with. It's a weak, sick, nation. A weak, sick, broken nation. And you need men like me to save the country. You need men to stand up and say stop crying like a baby over everything ... No wonder we're being laughed at around the world. No wonder ISIS can defeat our military.\\" Personal life While in the South Pacific, he became fascinated with the 19th-century sailor Charles Savage, who was believed to have been the first man to bring firearms to Fiji. That fascination led to Weiner's name change to Savage. Savage and his second wife, Janet, have two children, a daughter and a son; his son, Russell Weiner, is the founder of the company that produces the Rockstar energy drink.In Oregon, Thinking Local NY Times January 4, 2006 Russell's mother, Janet, served as CFO of his company until July 2009.

Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't.\\" Savage has had many pet dogs throughout his life, his current one being Teddy, a toy poodle.

In January 2003, Savage published The Savage Nation: Saving America from the Liberal Assault on Our Borders, Language and Culture, his first major book under the pseudonym Michael Savage. The book directs attacks at \\"liberal media bias\\", the \\"dominating culture of 'she- ocracy'\\", gay activists, and liberals. In January 2004, Savage published his second political book The Enemy Within: Saving America from the Liberal Assault on Our Schools, Faith, and Military. His next book, Liberalism Is a Mental Disorder, was released on April 12, 2005. Unlike The Savage Nation, both of these books cited sources for some of the more controversial claims made. In April 2006, Savage released The Political Zoo. The book contains satirical profiles and cartoons of different public figures, most of whom are liberal political figures and celebrities, depicted in caricature as animals in the \\"Political Zoo\\", with Savage portrayed as the zoo keeper. In October 2010, Savage released Trickle Up Poverty: Stopping Obama's Attack on Our Borders, Economy, and Security. Released through the HarperCollins imprint of William Morrow and Company, Savage argues in the book that \\"Americans are boiling mad over the way Congress and this Marxist/Leninist-oriented President are manipulating the current economic crisis to nationalize businesses.\\"Boog, Jason. \\"Michael Savage Sells 'Trickle Up Poverty' to William Morrow \\". Galleycat. Media Bistro. June 17, 2010. In November 2010, it was confirmed that Savage had signed a deal to write two thrillers for publisher St. Martin's Press.

A dark plot involving British officials and a terrorist group known as \\"the Hand of Allah\\".

In 2014, Savage released Stop the Coming Civil War: My Savage Truth, in which Savage writes in part, \\"We are under assault from both inside and out as our government moves to consolidate its domestic power, while at the same time weakening our defenses against the growing power of our enemies.\\" In 2015, Savage released another a book titled Government Zero: No Borders, No Language, No Culture. In it he writes that the country has been left without the founding principles of his radio show, \\"borders, language and culture,\\" and describes what he calls the destruction that the Presidency of Barack Obama brought to the country. He offers several solutions to rebuild the nation. In 2016, Savage's book Scorched Earth: Restoring The Country After Obama.

The Workshop has been known as several different names over the past including the Central Junior TV Workshop, Carlton Junior TV Workshop, ITV Junior TV Workshop and most recently simply The Television Workshop.  Birmingham Workshop  In late 2008, the Birmingham workshop run by their director Colin Edwards and his assistant Ross Berkeley Simpson, lost funding from ITV due to the recession and so the Birmingham branch went 'dark'. At the same time Edwards retired. In 2009, Ross Berkeley Simpson started a new, separate group called First Act Workshops to ensure that the work continued in Birmingham. Colin Edwards helped on a consultant level. First Act Workshops trains young actors in weekly sessions from Moseley Dance Centre. Some of the young people have been helped into professional work, and indeed this has kickstarted some careers, including Helen Monks (Raised by Wolves) and Gregory Piper (Line of Duty). Piper started his training at a separate Drama Workshop in Stourbridge but his career was handled by First Act Workshops. Sam Cole started with the workshop and secured the tour of 'Back down', a play by spoken word artist Polar Bear.

Betty Clawman is an Australian aboriginal woman, and her teammates include Gloss (aka Xiang Po, from mainland China), Jet (aka Celia Windward, an Afro- Caribbean British citizen), Extra√±o (aka Gregorio de la Vega, from Peru) and Inuit mechanic Thomas Kalmaku. Fictional character biography Betty Clawman was a young Australian aboriginal girl from Uluru, who was selected by the Guardians of the Universe to take part in an experiment in human evolution, and to advance the human race. Clawman, along with the other nine \\"chosen\\", are taught about the nature of the cosmos and endowed with immortality and metahuman abilities. Clawman was given the power to enter and merge with the Dreamtime, gaining vast and ill-defined abilities. Together with Harbinger, seven of the chosen formed the superhero team New Guardians, and took it upon themselves to fight evil wherever it lurked on Earth. Betty and the team show up in \\"Teen Titans Spotlight\\" #19.\\"Teen Titans Spotlight\\" #19 (February 1988) Since the New Guardians' series ended Betty has enjoyed relative obscurity. She most recently appeared in Wonder Woman #175 (2001), where all the female heroes of the DC Universe were brought together to combat Circe. Betty's contribution to the battle remains vague. Betty Clawman appeared in the comic book series Doomsday Clock, a crossover between DC Comics and Watchmen which concludes the story established in story established in The New 52 and DC Rebirth. She appears in the sixth issue of the series, using the alias \\"Dreamer\\", in which she joins the member of the Sleeping Soldiers, an Australian group of metahumans created as part of an international arms race, in which the governments of various companies around the world recruit sanctioned teams of superheros and metahumans. Joining her in the group are Tasmanian Devil, Argonaut, Dark Ranger, and Umbaluru. The group is accused of using Clawman's Dreamtime powers to induce other word leaders to sleep, and confronting them in their dreams, though the Australian government denies this. Clawman also appears in the twelfth and final issue of the series, where she and the other members of the Sleeping Soldiers participate in a fight among metahumans from the various international factions. Powers and abilities Betty's abilities since entering Dreamtime are vast and unspecified. She appears to have a degree of cosmic awareness, as befitting an Earth Mother figure, and has some ability to influence dreams. On one occasion she \\"synced\\" with Tom Kalmaku and amplified his own, equally nebulous, ability to \\"bring out the best in people\\" in order to unleash the genetic potential of an enslaved race of cloned humans. Betty appears as a big giant head. It is unclear whether this manifestation is visible to all. Reception Writer and scholar Frederick Luis Aldama described Clawman as one of several superheroes of color that began to emerge in comic books in the 1980s and 1990s, and he described her character as \\"interestingly fleshed out\\". Luke Pearson of the Special Broadcasting Service noted Betty Clawman is one of several Aboriginal characters in comic books who was not originally written or drawn by Aboriginal authors or artists, but said she is among a handful of recent characters created with more care for Aboriginal origins and characteristics, expressing hope that this would lead to future characters written and drawn by Aboriginals themselves. Tyson Yunkaporta of The Guardian said the character of Betty Clawman made an impression when first launched, but was among a handful of Aboriginal characters who were eventually \\"neutralised, reconciled with the main protagonists and retired to obscurity\\". Tim Richards of The Sydney Morning Herald called Betty Clawman \\"the most obscure of the big comic book companies' Aboriginal heroes\\". Pop culture writer Valerie Estelle Frankel noted that Betty Clawman is part of a trend of female characters having telepathy, mind control, or telekinesis, which Frankel said is presented in comic books as a \\"specifically feminine power\\". History professor Allan Austing and English professor Patrick Hamilton, both of Misericordia University, were critical of the portrayal of Betty Clawman and other members of the New Guardians, who they described as racial stereotypes rather than actual characters. Austin said he was \\"horrified\\" by the depiction, and said while the characters were an attempt to promote multiculturalism and the benefits of a more inclusive society, the way the character were executed risked having the opposite effect. Betty Clawman and others from the New Guardians were made part of a course the two taught at Misericorida called \\"Race and Graphic Narrative in Post-War United States\\".

In detail, this means that \\\\operatorname{Hom}(A,B), the morphisms from any object A to another object B of the category is a direct sum :\\\\bigoplus_{n \\\\in \\\\Z}\\\\operatorname{Hom}_n(A,B) and there is a differential d on this graded group, i.e., for each n there is a linear map :d\\\\colon \\\\operatorname{Hom}_n(A,B) \\\\rightarrow \\\\operatorname{Hom}_{n+1}(A,B), which has to satisfy d \\\\circ d = 0. This is equivalent to saying that \\\\operatorname{Hom}(A,B) is a cochain complex. Furthermore, the composition of morphisms \\\\operatorname{Hom}(A,B) \\\\otimes \\\\operatorname{Hom}(B,C) \\\\rightarrow \\\\operatorname{Hom}(A,C) is required to be a map of complexes, and for all objects A of the category, one requires d(\\\\operatorname{id}_A) = 0. Examples * Any additive category may be considered to be a DG-category by imposing the trivial grading (i.e. all \\\\mathrm{Hom}_n(-,-) vanish for n e 0) and trivial differential (d=0). * A little bit more sophisticated is the category of complexes C(\\\\mathcal A) over an additive category \\\\mathcal A. By definition, \\\\operatorname{Hom}_{C(\\\\mathcal A), n} (A, B) is the group of maps A \\\\rightarrow B[n] which do not need to respect the differentials of the complexes A and B, i.e., ::\\\\mathrm{Hom}_{C(\\\\mathcal A), n} (A, B) = \\\\prod_{l \\\\in \\\\Z} \\\\mathrm{Hom}(A_l, B_{l+n}). :The differential of such a morphism f = (f_l \\\\colon A_l \\\\rightarrow B_{l+n}) of degree n is defined to be ::f_{l+1} \\\\circ d_A + (-1)^{n+1} d_B \\\\circ f_l, :where d_A, d_B are the differentials of A and B, respectively. This applies to the category of complexes of quasi- coherent sheaves on a scheme over a ring. * A DG-category with one object is the same as a DG-ring. A DG-ring over a field is called DG-algebra, or differential graded algebra. Further properties The category of small dg- categories can be endowed with a model category structure such that weak equivalences are those functors that induce an equivalence of derived categories. Given a dg-category C over some ring R, there is a notion of smoothness and properness of C that reduces to the usual notions of smooth and proper morphisms in case C is the category of quasi-coherent sheaves on some scheme X over R. Relation to triangulated categories A DG category C is called pre-triangulated if it has a suspension functor \\\\Sigma and a class of distinguished triangles compatible with the suspension, such that its homotopy category Ho(C) is a triangulated category. A triangulated category T is said to have a dg enhancement C if C is a pretriangulated dg category whose homotopy category is equivalent to T.See for a survey of existence and unicity results of dg enhancements dg enhancements. dg enhancements of an exact functor between triangulated categories are defined similarly. In general, there need not exist dg enhancements of triangulated categories or functors between them, for example stable homotopy category can be shown not to arise from a dg category in this way. However, various positive results do exist, for example the derived category D(A) of a Grothendieck abelian category A admits a unique dg enhancement.

Early musical education Paetsch began his cello studies with his father, G√ºnther Paetsch (who was also a cellist), at the age of 5, and gave his first recital when he was 6 years old. His extensive experience in chamber music began early in childhood with his large and talented family of 9. His three sisters Phebe, Michaela and Brigitte and his three brothers Christian, Engelbert and Siegmund all learned string instruments. He learned and performed almost the entire chamber music repertoire for strings with his family The Paetsch Chamber Music Ensemble in many concerts throughout the U.S. Paetsch family in Colorado Springs in 1973 Formal musical education Paetsch studied at Butler University with the principal cellist of the Indianapolis Symphony, Arkady Orlovsky, where he received his bachelor's degree Cum Laude. He then furthered his cello studies at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut with the famous cellist and teacher Aldo Parisot, where he earned his Certificate of Music Degree and later his master's degree in Music. He then went on to study in Germany at the Musikhochschule L√ºbeck with David Geringas where he received his ‚ÄòKonzertexamen‚Äô. He has participated in masterclasses with cellists such as Yo-Yo Ma, Mstislav Rostropovich, Janos Starker, Bernard Greenhouse and Mischa Maisky. As a member of the Yale Cellists, he took part in the recording of two world-famous CD‚Äôs. Awards and recognition A recipient of numerous prizes, Paetsch was awarded a top prize in the Emmanuel Feuermann Competition and the first place in the Young Musicians Foundation Competition in Los Angeles, CA. He was also highly successful in the ARD Competition, Munich, in the prestigious Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow and in the Rostropovitch Competition, held in Paris. Paetsch has performed regularly in Japan, Europe and North and South America. He has collaborated with artists such as Vadim Repin, Gidon Kremer, Jean-Bernard Pommier, Eduard Brunner and the Wilanow Quartet.

Paetsch's first daughter Raphaela, born in Lugano in 1996, also plays the cello. His daughter Valentina, born in 1998 plays the violin and his son Dominic plays the cello. Raphaela, Valentina and Dominic have performed string quintets in public with their father and mother. Since 1992 Paetsch has served as First Solo Cellist of the Orchestra della Svizzera Italiana in Lugano, Switzerland. He also was founder of a piano trio called the Trio Ceresio, which has performed in Europe, Japan as well as Brazil. Critical reception Paetsch's work has been well received by a music critics worldwide. A writer from the L√ºbecker Nachrichten wrote \\"...a brilliant virtuoso piece which demanded all the finesse of everything that one could imagine from a cellist, delighted the audience and brought them to a thundering applause.\\" A review in The Strad magazine applauded his cellistic abilities, saying he was \\"A CELLIST of extraordinary flair...His playing is at once stylish and communicative and of virtuoso stamp.\\" In addition, a music critic from The New Haven Register wrote that \\"Paetsch brought great intensity and depth of understanding to this complex work.... the second movement was exquisitely eerie. His multiple-stop work stood out both for its lyrical beauty and technical excellence.\\" Compositions and transcriptions Paetsch is also a noted champion of works transcribed for solo cello.

The Mahican name probably means 'great village, principal village' she-komeko /sheh-KOM-eh-ko/. In 1740, Moravians from Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, founded a Moravian mission at Shekomeko.

History  Tranmere Rovers Ladies were formed in 1990 named by Jayne Lewis indeed Jayne Lewis got the original team together and entered of the North West Regional League with Steve Williams as manager. They played their first competitive game against Bury Girls in September of that year. They won Division Four at their first attempt, and followed this success by winning Division Three in the next year. In the 1992‚Äì93 season, they came third in Division Two, winning promotion to the top division of the league. Tranmere finished mid-table in their first season in Division One, but won the division in the following season. Tranmere won the next tier of the English women's football pyramid ‚Äì the FA Premier League Northern Division ‚Äì at the first attempt, with only one defeat all season. They were promoted to the FA Premier League National Division, at the time the top tier of the English league system. The four promotions required to reach this league had been achieved in only five seasons. 1995‚Äì96 also saw the team win the Cheshire Shield for the first time, beating Stockport 6‚Äì2 in the final. The team spent eight seasons in the top flight, the most successful period in the club's short history. After finishing 8th in their first season, they came 7th in 1997‚Äì98, 5th in each of the following three seasons, 6th twice, before relegation back to the Northern Division with a 10th-placed finish in 2003‚Äì04. The team were also successful in the cup competitions during this period; they reached the FA Cup semi-final in 1998‚Äì99, losing 2‚Äì1 to Southampton Saints. They repeated this feat in 2001‚Äì02, but lost 3‚Äì1 to Doncaster Belles. In 1999, Tranmere won the Reebok Women's Football Festival in Mansfield, then the traditional curtain-raiser to the season, beating local rivals Everton 1‚Äì0 in the final. In 2000, the players featured in a television advert for Daz washing powder alongside Julian Clary. In 2000‚Äì01, Tranmere reached the final of the Premier League Cup ‚Äì their first major cup final ‚Äì against Arsenal at the Deva Stadium. Though the game was level at half time, Arsenal dominated and eventually ran out 3‚Äì0 winners, to secure their fourth successive title. In 2002, Steve Williams stepped down as manager to be replaced by player Louise Edwards. Tranmere spent five seasons in the Premier League Northern Division, finishing 8th, 3rd, 6th, and 8th, respectively, before being relegated to the Northern Combination with an 11th-placed finish in 2008‚Äì09. In 2006, Louise Edwards stepped down as manager, with assistant Shirley Waring taking over. Waring resigned after relegation in 2009; Edwards returned in an interim role, though was still in charge two years later. Edwards and Waring are currently joint managers. In August 2009, a game between Tranmere and Middlesbrough at the Billingham Synthonia ground caused controversy. Tranmere won 3‚Äì2 after saving a penalty during ten minutes of added-on time. There was a brawl after the match involving all 22 players, and continued fighting led to Tranmere captain Lindsey Smith breaking the cheekbone of Boro's Nicola Duckling. Smith was subsequently acquitted of causing grievous bodily harm by a jury in Teesside. In the 2010‚Äì11 season, Tranmere came 12th and last in the Northern Combination, and were relegated to North West Regional League, Premier Division. However, in the same season they won the Cheshire Cup for a record 11th time.  Colours  Tranmere's colours follow those used by their affiliated men's team. In 1961, Dave Russell joined the club as manager. Tranmere had worn a kit of blue shirts, white shorts and blue socks since 1904 ‚Äì the same colours as local rivals, Division One club Everton. Russell introduced an all-white strip to set the teams apart; these have been Tranmere's usual colours since. In 2011, Tranmere Ladies home colours were a white shirt with blue trim, blue shorts, and blue socks with white trim. Their away colours were a claret shirt, shorts and socks, all with blue trim.  Stadium  During their first years, Tranmere played in several venues. In 1997, they moved to Gayton Park, the home of West Cheshire League club Heswall F.C. In 2006, they moved to Victoria Park, the home of Poulton Victoria F.C. In 2009, Paulton Victoria folded, so Tranmere moved to Villa Park, the home of Ashville F.C. in Wallasey, Wirral.Ôøº Upon its completion, the club moved their home games to Tranmere's training ground, Solar Campus.  Players  = Current squad = = Former players = A number of Tranmere players have represented their country. In 1992, Sammy Howarth made her England debut against Denmark, going on to win five caps. Goalkeeper Jo Fletcher also played for England, whilst Katie Williams has represented Wales twenty times. Tranmere's most capped international player is Sue Smith. Smith first appeared for England in 1997, and went on to win 93 caps, scoring 16 goals. Whilst playing for Tranmere, Smith won a number of awards. In 1999, she was voted international player of the year, for her performances in the England team, and players' player of the year. In 2001, she was again awarded the title of international player of the year. The Swedish international player Tina Nordlund played for Tranmere in 1998‚Äì99. She was in a relationship and living with Jesper Blomqvist who was contracted to Manchester United at the time.

The family of Nakagami distributions has two parameters: a shape parameter m\\\\geq 1/2 and a second parameter controlling spread \\\\Omega>0.  Characterization  Its probability density function (pdf) is : f(x;\\\\,m,\\\\Omega) = \\\\frac{2m^m}{\\\\Gamma(m)\\\\Omega^m}x^{2m-1}\\\\exp\\\\left(-\\\\frac{m}{\\\\Omega}x^2\\\\right), \\\\forall x\\\\geq 0. where (m\\\\geq 1/2,\\\\text{ and }\\\\Omega>0) Its cumulative distribution function is : F(x;\\\\,m,\\\\Omega) = P\\\\left(m, \\\\frac{m}{\\\\Omega}x^2\\\\right) where P is the regularized (lower) incomplete gamma function.  Parametrization  The parameters m and \\\\Omega areR. Kolar, R. Jirik, J. Jan (2004) \\"Estimator Comparison of the Nakagami-m Parameter and Its Application in Echocardiography\\", Radioengineering, 13 (1), 8-12 : m = \\\\frac{\\\\left( \\\\operatorname{E} \\\\left[X^2 \\\\right] \\\\right)^2 } {\\\\operatorname{Var} \\\\left[X^2 \\\\right]}, and : \\\\Omega = \\\\operatorname{E} \\\\left[X^2 \\\\right].  Parameter estimation  An alternative way of fitting the distribution is to re-parametrize \\\\Omega and m as œÉ = Œ©/m and m. Given independent observations X_1=x_1,\\\\ldots,X_n=x_n from the Nakagami distribution, the likelihood function is : L( \\\\sigma, m) = \\\\left( \\\\frac{2}{\\\\Gamma(m)\\\\sigma^m} \\\\right)^n \\\\left( \\\\prod_{i=1}^n x_i\\\\right)^{2m-1} \\\\exp\\\\left(-\\\\frac{\\\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2} \\\\sigma \\\\right). Its logarithm is : \\\\ell(\\\\sigma, m) = \\\\log L(\\\\sigma,m) = -n \\\\log \\\\Gamma(m) - nm\\\\log\\\\sigma + (2m-1) \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\log x_i - \\\\frac{ \\\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2} \\\\sigma. Therefore : \\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\ell}{\\\\partial\\\\sigma} = \\\\frac{-nm\\\\sigma+\\\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2}{\\\\sigma^2} \\\\quad \\\\text{and} \\\\quad \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\ell}{\\\\partial m} = -n\\\\frac{\\\\Gamma'(m)}{\\\\Gamma(m)} -n \\\\log\\\\sigma + 2\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\log x_i. \\\\end{align} These derivatives vanish only when : \\\\sigma= \\\\frac{\\\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2}{nm} and the value of m for which the derivative with respect to m vanishes is found by numerical methods including the Newton‚ÄìRaphson method. It can be shown that at the critical point a global maximum is attained, so the critical point is the maximum-likelihood estimate of (m,œÉ). Because of the equivariance of maximum-likelihood estimation, one then obtains the MLE for Œ© as well.  Generation  The Nakagami distribution is related to the gamma distribution. In particular, given a random variable Y \\\\, \\\\sim \\\\textrm{Gamma}(k, \\\\theta), it is possible to obtain a random variable X \\\\, \\\\sim \\\\textrm{Nakagami} (m, \\\\Omega), by setting k=m, \\\\theta=\\\\Omega / m , and taking the square root of Y: : X = \\\\sqrt{Y}. \\\\, Alternatively, the Nakagami distribution f(y; \\\\,m,\\\\Omega) can be generated from the chi distribution with parameter k set to 2m and then following it by a scaling transformation of random variables. That is, a Nakagami random variable X is generated by a simple scaling transformation on a Chi- distributed random variable Y \\\\sim \\\\chi(2m) as below. : X = \\\\sqrt{(\\\\Omega / 2 m)Y} . For a Chi-distribution, the degrees of freedom 2m must be an integer, but for Nakagami the m can be any real number greater than 1/2. This is the critical difference and accordingly, Nakagami-m is viewed as a generalization of Chi-distribution, similar to a gamma distribution being considered as a generalization of Chi-squared distributions.  History and applications  The Nakagami distribution is relatively new, being first proposed in 1960.Nakagami, M. (1960) \\"The m-Distribution, a general formula of intensity of rapid fading\\".

She wrote under the pen names P.A. Brisco, Patty Brisco, Pat A. Brisco, Pat Brisco, Patricia Matthews and Laura Wylie. She collaborated with her second husband, Clayton Matthews, on romance and mystery (suspense) novels; they were called \\"the hottest couple in paperbacks.\\" She also collaborated with Denise Hrivnak as Denise Matthews. Biography Patricia Anne Klein Ernst was born on July 1, 1927 in San Fernando, California, the daughter of Roy Oliver Ernst and Gladys Gable. Her mother enrolled her in the famous Meglin Kiddies school, but she recorded only two of her songs professionally for one demo tape. She studied at California State University, Los Angeles, where she worked as secretary to the General Manager of Associated Students by the California State College. On 21 December 1946 she married Marvin Owen Brisco, they had two sons: Michael Arvie and David Roy. By 1961, the marriage had ended in divorce. Focused on her writing career, she met the writer Clayton Matthews in a local writers' group. After Matthews divorced his first wife, he and Patricia married on 3 November 1972 and lived near San Diego. Matthews started to write poetry, juvenile books, a play, fantasy and mystery short stories, which she signed under different names: Patricia Ernst, P.A. Brisco and Pat A. Brisco. Using the names Patty Brisco and Pat Brisco, she wrote gothic novels. When the market for gothic novels softened, at the suggestion of the Matthews' agent, Jay Garon, she began to write romance novels under her second married name, Patricia Matthews. She and her husband also collaborated on several romance and suspense novels using the pseudonyms Laura Wylie and Laurie Wylie. She and her husband wrote five Casey Farrell mystery novels together, and she wrote three on her own, the Thumbprint Mysteries, set in the American Southwest. With Denise Hrivnak, she also wrote under the pseudonym Denise Matthews. In 1989 they moved to Prescott, Arizona where they were involved in local theater productions and even produced a play of their own.Son of Patricia Matthews Her husband Clayton died on 25 March 2004.

Cantabrian mythology refers to the myths, teachings and legends of the Cantabri, a pre-Roman Celtic people of the north coastal region of Iberia (Spain). Over time, Cantabrian mythology was likely diluted by Celtic mythology and Roman mythology with some original meanings lost. Later, the ascendancy of Christendom absorbed or ended the pagan rites of Cantabrian, Celtic and Roman mythology leading to a syncretism. Some relics of Cantabrian mythology remain. Divinities Vijanera masquerade ceremony Some relics and remnants of Cantabrian worship of protective divinities survive. One example is the Cantabrian stele of Barros which suggests worship of a sun god. Another example may be the Bonfires of Saint John coinciding with the summer solstice. A bronze sculpture found near the town of Herrera in Camargo, Cantabria suggests worship of a male figure. Such a figure would have been absorbed into the Roman worship of Jupiter. Strabo, Horace and Silius Italicus write of a Cantabrian god of war, later identified with the Roman Mars. The Cantabrian god of war was offered sacrifices of male goats, horses, or large numbers of prisoners.Estr. III, 3, 7Carm. III, 4, 34Silius III, 361 These large sacrifices, or \\"hecatombs\\" were accompanied by the drinking of the still warm blood of the horses. The Cantabrians considered horses to be sacred animals. Tacitus (56 AD 120AD) mentions that the Germanic people believed this. In Germania X (98 AD), he wrote, se sacerdotes enim ministros deorum, illos equos conscios putant (\\"the horses themselves think of the priests as ministers of the gods\\"). Horace (65 BC 8 BC) writes, et laetum equino sanguine Concanum (\\"the Cantabrians, drunk on horses' blood\\").Carmina book 3, chapter 4. verses 29 36 Julio Caro Baroja suggests there may have been an equestrian deity among Hispanian Celts, similar to that of the other European Celts. The Celtic goddess of the horses, worshipped even in Rome was Epona, which in ancient Cantabria was called Epane. Some link sacrifice of horses with the Celtic variant of the god Mars and that horses represented Mars' reincarnation.E. Thevenot. Sur les traces des Mars antiques, Bruges, 1995. At Numantia, where there are ruins of an Iberian Celtic settlement, relics depicting the horse god are decorated with solar signs. Human sacrifices by the Cantabrians are reported by Saint Martin of Braga.De correctione rusticorum VIII They were similar to those of the Celts of Gaul in purpose. The victim wore a thin tunic. Their right hand was cut off and consecrated to the gods. The fall of the victim and the condition of their entrails were used to predict the future while at the same time, the people sought redemption from the gods.Martinez J. La religiosidad de los pueblos hispanos vista por los autores griegos y latinos 1977 Accessed September 8, 2007. (Spanish) The Cantabrians, being an agrarian society, worshipped fertility mother goddesses related to the Moon and influencing the phases of sowing and gathering of crops. A Celtic group worshipping a sea god was assimilated to that of the Roman Neptune. A statuette of this deity showing features of Cantabrian divinity, was found in Castro Urdiales. The Cantabrians believed in the immortality of the spirit. Cremation was the preferred burial custom. However, fallen soldiers were left lying in the battlefield until vultures savaged the entrails. This meant the soldier's soul was taken to the afterlife and reunited with their ancestors in glory. This practice is recorded in the engravings of the Cantabrian stele of Zurita. Self-sacrifice, for instance by immolation and especially by a military leader, was considered an important way of fulfilling the will of the gods for the collective good. In the devotio, a leader or general would offer himself in battle as a sacrifice to the gods in order to secure victory for his army.Cabria J. Mitos y leyendas de Cantabria.

The tree may be the most representative of Cantabria and has often been planted near buildings. Cantabrian oak forest. Mythology that is connected to the worship of Gaia, Mother Earth, is derived from the divinization of animals, trees, mountains and waters as elementary spirits. This was common to the peoples who received Celtic influences. Some sacred sites such as that at Pico Dobra, in Besaya Valley date to Pre-Roman times. On the other hand, there is an altar dedicated to the god Erudinus, dated to 399 CE, demonstrating that in Cantabria, these rites persisted after the adoption of Christianity as the official religion of the Roman Empire. Certain place names also indicate the presence of ancient sacred places. These include Pe√±a Sagra (\\"Sacred Mount\\"), Pe√±a Santa (\\"Saint Mount\\"), Mozagro (Montem sacrum or \\"Sacred Mount\\") and Montehano (montem fanum or \\"Mount of the Sanctuary\\"). The Convent of Saint Sebastian of Hano dates to the 14th century CE but a small chapel pre-existed the monastery on the same site. Divinization also occurred with respect to rivers and bodies of water. At Mount Cild√° there was an area dedicated to the mother goddess, Mater Deva, a personification of the river Deva. At Ota√±es there was a ritual took place dedicated to the nymph of a spring that had medicinal properties. Pliny the ElderPliny, NH XXXI 23-24 mentions the existence of three intermittent springs in Cantabria. The Tamaric Fountains were worshiped by the Cantabrians as a source of prophetic omens. Pliny recorded the existence of three fountains near one another whose waters joined in one pond. There, the flow would stop for between 12 and 20 days. The cessation of the flow was interpreted by the people as a negative sign. Suetonius, in a story about the life of Galba, records Galba's finding of twelve axes in a lake during his stay in Cantabria. Suetonius mentions this as a sign of good divination.Suet., Galba, VIII 13 Votive offerings were left there suggesting a tradition of cults related to the lakes.A. Schulten. Los c√°ntabros y astures y su guerra con Roma. Madrid. 1943 These offerings to the Waters of Stips included bronze coins of low value, as well as other pieces of higher value such as denari, aurei and solidi. Such items were found at La Hermida, Pe√±a Cutral, Alceda and at the H√≠jar river. The forests were also divinized by a group with clear Celtic influences. Some species of trees were especially respected such as the yew and the oak. Silius, Florus, Pliny and Isidore of Seville wrote of Cantabrians committing suicide by taking the poison of the yew leaf.The leaves of the yews and its seed, present in its red berries, contain a very toxic alkaloid, taxine, that provokes hypotension and cardiac arrests when consumed. Death was preferred over slavery.Silius III, 328Florus II, 33, 50Pliny XVI, 50Isidore Book XVII, 9, 25 Yew trees were planted in town squares, cemeteries, churches, chapels, palaces and big houses as they were considered a \\"witness tree\\". An ancient yew tree grows beside the church of Saint Mary of Lebe√±a. The sacred site dates to pre-Roman times. Meetings of the town council took place in the shade of the tree.Inventory of single trees of Cantabria Dereccion General del Medio Naturale. Accessed 8 September 2017. The oak is a sacred species for Druids. It features in the Celtic ritual of oak and mistletoe where mistletoe is cut from the boughs of the oak tree. In Cantabria, the oak is a part of folklore, and symbolic and magic beliefs. The oak was used as a Maypole, a pole that presides over festivities, around which people danced to celebrate the rebirth of vegetation in Spring. The oak symbolized the union between the sky and the earth, as the axis of the world. The oak played a role in ceremonies to attract rain and fire as it would attract lightning strikes. Oaks, beeches, hollyoaks and yews were used by Cantabrians as places of tribal meetings where religious and secular laws were taught. Until recent times, it was usual to convene open meetings under very old trees. For example, the meetings of Trasmiera convened at Hoz de Anero, Ribamont√°n al Monte, under a hollyoak tree. Significant dates Elder flowers In Cantabrian mythology there were dates that held significance. For example, during the summer solstice, the \\"night is magic\\". Tradition says that Caballucos del Diablu (Damselflies, \\"Devil's little horses\\") and witches lose their power after dusk and the curanderos (folk healers) gain control over them. When collected at dawn, a clover with four leaves, the fruit of the elderberry, the leaves of the willow, common juniper and tree heath cure and bring happiness. At Christmas time, (winter solstice) the Cantabrians held ceremonies stemming from the ancient cults to trees, fire and water. The sources of the rivers and the balconies of the houses were dressed with flowers. People danced and jumped over fires. Specific moments of the day such as twilight were important. Cantabrians spoke of the \\"Sun of the Dead\\", referring to that last part of the day when the sun was still visible. They believed that last glimpse of the sun was sent by the dead and that it marked the moment when the dead came back to life. It may have related to a solar cult.Cabria J. Mitologia Otra Realidad website. Accessed 20 June 2008 (Spanish) dead link Mythological creatures The Trapajones, entities of nature. The Cantabrian people believed in not only telluric and natural divinities, but also other fabulous beings. The people loved or feared them and maintained legends about them. There are many such beings in Cantabrian mythology. The Oj√°ncanu (\\"Sorrow of Cantabria\\"), a cyclops giant, represented evil, cruelty and brutality. It was the Cantabrian version of the Greek Polyphemus. Beings similar to the Oj√°ncanu are found in other pantheons such as Extremadurian mythology in which it is the J√°ncanu, Peluj√°ncanu or J√°ncanas.Revista de Folklore Funjdiaz website archived 3 February 2007. Accessed 9 September 2017 (Spanish) pdf.Monstruos Alonso Quijano websiteTorri Babuesa website It is also found in the Basque mythology as Tartalo or Torto. The Oj√°ncana or Ju√°ncana was the wife of the Oj√°ncanu. She was more ruthless and killed her children. The Anjana was the antithesis of the Oj√°ncanu and the Oj√°ncana. Anjana was a good and generous fairy who protected the honest, lovers and those who became lost in the woods or on roads. The goblins were a large group of little mythological creatures, most of them mischievous. There were two groups. One was the domestic goblins who lived in or around houses and included the Trasgu and the Trastolillu. The other was the forest goblins, the Trenti and the Tentiruju. Other beings in Cantabrian mythology include the Ventol√≠n, the Caballucos del Diablu, the Nuberu, the Musgosu, the Culebre, and the Ramidreju. The Sirenuca (\\"Little Mermaid\\") is a beautiful but disobedient and spoiled young lady whose vice was climbing the most dangerous cliffs of Castro Urdiales to sing with the waves. She was transformed into a water nymph. Another popular legend is the Fish-man, the story of a man from Li√©rganes who loved to swim and got lost in the Miera river. He was found in the Bay of C√°diz as a strange aquatic being. References Bibliography * Mitos y Leyendas de Cantabria. Santander 2001. Llano Merino, M.. Ed. Librer√≠a Estvdio. * Los C√°ntabros.

The change in pressure needed to classify something as explosive cyclogenesis is latitude dependent. For example, at 60¬∞ latitude, explosive cyclogenesis occurs if the central pressure decreases by 24 mbar (hPa) or more in 24 hours. This is a predominantly maritime, winter event, but also occurs in continental settings, even in the summer.http://www.businessinsider.com/noreaster-winter-storm- riley-bombogenesis-intensification-2018-3 This process is the extratropical equivalent of the tropical rapid deepening. Although their cyclogenesis is totally different from that of tropical cyclones, bomb cyclones can produce winds of 74‚Äì95 mph, the same order as the first categories of the Saffir- Simpson scale and give heavy precipitation. Even though only a minority of the bombs become so strong, some weaker ones have also caused significant damage. History In the 1940s and 1950s, meteorologists at the Bergen School of Meteorology began informally calling some storms that grew over the sea \\"bombs\\" because they developed with a great ferocity rarely seen over land. By the 1970s, the terms \\"explosive cyclogenesis\\" and even \\"meteorological bombs\\" were being used by MIT professor Fred Sanders (building on work from the 1950s by Tor Bergeron), who brought the term into common usage in a 1980 article in the Monthly Weather Review. In 1980, Sanders and his colleague John Gyakum defined a \\"bomb\\" as an extratropical cyclone that deepens by at least (24 sin œÜ/ sin 60¬∞)mb in 24 hours, where œÜ represents latitude in degrees. This is based on the definition, standardised by Bergeron, for explosive development of a cyclone at 60¬∞N as deepening by 24 mb in 24 hours. Sanders and Gyakum noted that an equivalent intensification is dependent on latitude: at the poles this would be a drop in pressure of 28 mb/24 hours, while at 25 degrees latitude it would be only 12 mb/24 hours. All these rates qualify for what Sanders and Gyakum called \\"1 bergeron\\". Formation Baroclinic instability has been cited as one of the principal mechanisms for the development of most explosively deepening cyclones. However, the relative roles of baroclinic and diabatic processes in explosive deepening of extratropical cyclones have been subject to debate (citing case studies) for a long time. Other factors include the relative position of a 500-hPa trough and thickness patterns, deep tropospheric frontogenetic processes which happen both upstream and downstream of the surface low, the influence of air‚Äìsea interaction, and latent heat release. =Regions and motion= Absorbing the remnants of a powerful tropical cyclone can trigger explosive cyclogenesis The four most active regions where extratropical explosive cyclogenesis occurs in the world are the Northwest Pacific, the North Atlantic, the Southwest Pacific, and the South Atlantic. In the Northern Hemisphere the maximum frequency of explosively deepening cyclones is found within or to the north of the Atlantic Gulf Stream and Kuroshio Current in the western Pacific, and in the Southern Hemisphere it is found with Australian east coast lows above the East Australian Current, which shows the importance of air-sea interaction in initiating and rapidly developing extratropical cyclones. Explosively deepening cyclones south of 50¬∞S often show equator-ward movement, in contrast with the poleward motion of most Northern Hemisphere bombs. Over the year, 45 cyclones on average in the Northern Hemisphere and 26 in the Southern Hemisphere develop explosively, mostly in the respective hemisphere's winter time. Less seasonality has been noticed in bomb cyclogenesis occurrences in the Southern Hemisphere. Other uses of \\"weather bomb\\" The term \\"weather bomb\\" is popularly used in New Zealand to describe dramatic or destructive weather events. Rarely are the events actual instances of explosive cyclogenesis, as the rapid deepening of low pressure areas is rare around New Zealand. This use of \\"bomb\\" may lead to confusion with the more strictly defined meteorological term. In Japan, the term is used both academically and commonly to refer to an extratropical cyclone which meets the meteorological \\"bomb\\" conditions. The term \\"bomb\\" may be somewhat controversial. When European researchers protested that it was a rather warlike term, Fred Sanders, the coauthor of the paper which introduced the meteorological usage quipped: \\"So why are you using the term 'front'?\\".

From 2006 to 2016, she advised the British Government on the relationship between work and health. She is a medical practitioner and an expert on the disease scleroderma. Early life and student years An only child, Black was born into an unacademic family in Barwell, Leicestershire, a few months after the outbreak of the Second World War. She attended grammar school in the 1950s where she became head girl. She first studied history at Bristol University, graduating as a Bachelor of Arts. She then moved to a British colony ‚Äì the Gilbert and Ellice Islands in the Pacific Ocean ‚Äì where she worked as a schoolteacher. In 1965 Black enrolled as a (largely self-funding) mature student in the first intake of 'pre-clinical' medical students to Bristol University; she sparkled academically, winning prizes in surgery, obstetrics and pathology. She graduated in medicine in 1970 at the age of 30 and obtained full registration with the General Medical Council the following year. Clinical training and NHS work After graduating, Black stayed in Bristol to work in general hospital medicine as a junior doctor. She gained a higher degree by researching the rare skin and connective tissue disease scleroderma and in 1974 passed the Royal College of Physicians membership examination. Black moved to Hammersmith Hospital in London the following year for specialist training. In 1981, she took up an offer of an appointment as a consultant rheumatologist at the nearby West Middlesex Hospital. After eight years in an NHS general hospital as a consultant, Black opted for a move back into academic rheumatology by taking a job at the Royal Free teaching hospital in Hampstead, later becoming a professor and then the hospital's medical director. The rheumatology unit she established there has a strong interest in scleroderma: it is a national tertiary referral centre for patients suffering from the illness and is the major European centre for clinical research into the disease, with a particular focus on trying to understand the pathological process of fibrosis or scarring that characterises the condition at a histological level. The unit also has a strong tradition of high-quality teaching aimed at medical students and specialists-in-training. Black is an international expert on scleroderma. Partly as a result of her work, much can now be done to ameliorate the effects of the condition, although a specific treatment for the disease remains elusive. Women in medicine At the age of 62, Black retired from full-time hospital work to become the President of the Royal College of Physicians in 2002. Black's successful academic career in rheumatology, her NHS management role when she was medical director of her London teaching hospital, and her subsequent positions of influence (she chaired the Health Honours Committee between 2006 and 2009) gave Black a profile inside and outside medicine and led to her being championed by some as a leader of the profession and a role model for young women. Black was indubitably in the vanguard of the rise of women in medicine from the 1960s onwards: she became a consultant at a time when many women were entering medical school but few had become fully trained specialists, and this 'woman in a man's world' experience is something she is often asked to talk about. However, when she was president of her royal college she made controversial comments about women in medicine, suggesting that the profession was being \\"feminised\\" and that this could make it harder to find specialists such as cardiologists in the future. To illustrate her concerns, she said that Russian doctors were poorly paid and had low status and that this was the result of having an almost entirely female workforce (rather than it being a reflection of Russian 20th century political history). She then drew a parallel between doctors and teachers, saying: \\"Years ago, teaching was a male-dominated profession - and look what happened to teaching\\". She later clarified her comments, explaining that her intention had been to warn that unless provision was made for female doctors to balance work and family life and be given extra support with childcare and flexible hours, they would tend not to enter what she called \\"the more demanding\\" branches of medicine or to serve on government committees. She stepped down as President of the Royal College of Physicians in 2006 but still works as an advisor to the consultancy firm PwC and with the Work Foundation. Modernising medical careers The NHS Plan published in 2000 set out the government's ambitions for the NHS. In return for a huge increase in funding, the government expected modernisation and reform. The Modernising Medical Careers (MMC) programme was designed by the Department of Health with input from the medical profession as a way to update, streamline and accelerate the training of doctors in Britain. As part of this programme, all doctors who qualified after taking their 'finals' in 2005 began their postgraduate training with a two year foundation programme designed to teach them generic clinical and interpersonal skills, following a curriculum set by the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges that Black became the Chair of in 2006. In February 2007, MMC hit a crisis caused by the abject failure of its online job-matching component: the Medical Training Application Service (MTAS). This led to loud criticism from within the medical profession that culminated in senior surgeons in Birmingham refusing to interview candidates recommended to them by MTAS. In response, the Department of Health announced an urgent review led by the Vice-Chair of the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, Professor Neil Douglas. But when the review group declared that MTAS should continue, it triggered mass demonstrations by junior doctors; the London protest march was addressed by the Leader of the Opposition at the time, David Cameron, who described MTAS as \\"an utter shambles\\". Over the following weeks and months, there was a flurry of resignations of senior doctors associated with MMC, MTAS and the Douglas Review itself. In May, Black and the Chair of the British Medical Association (BMA), James Johnson, wrote jointly to The Times endorsing the Douglas Review and the principles of MMC. Three days later, after what The Times called \\"widespread fury\\" from junior doctors, Johnson resigned as head of the BMA when his position became untenable. Black later told Parliament that the joint letter was \\"simply an attempt at unity which obviously did not work well. When the Douglas Review was doing its work the chairman of that body asked the Academy [of Medical Royal Colleges] and the BMA together to produce a letter which would be supportive of that review and would also correct some of the inaccuracies already in the press about it...we were supporting the principles as expounded by MMC\\". The online recruitment system was subsequently discarded. In the aftermath, the House of Commons Health Committee carried out an investigation: it criticised the leaders of the medical profession in general over the debacle and described the role of the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges as \\"weak and tokenistic\\". The Academy rejected this, saying that it did not reflect the nature of the Academy, the people in it nor the progress it had recently made. Work, health and sickness absence In 2006, the government led by Tony Blair made Black its national director for health and work and asked her to promote its policies across Whitehall, especially within the Department of Health and the Department for Work and Pensions. She described her role as being to try to keep people \\"healthy, well, resilient and in work\\". In March 2008, she authored Working for a healthier tomorrow, a report which focused on the impact of sickness absence on the health of the working-age population and on the economy. The key points of the 2008 report were: * Intervention in the early stages of an employee's sickness absence could help prevent the absence becoming a long-term one * Managers should be flexible when an early return to work is recommended * GPs should be \\"supported to adapt the advice they provide, where appropriate doing all they can to help people enter, stay in or return to work\\" * The sick note should be replaced by a 'fit note' that outlines what the patient can do at work, not just what they can't do * Occupational health services should be expanded, and more of these services should be provided by the NHS * Occupational health services should also be made available to people who are out of work The fit note was introduced in 2010. Black stepped down from her national director role in 2012. She still leads the 'health at work network' at the Department of Health; through it, she is part of a drive to encourage commercial, public and third sector organisations to improve the health of their employees. Views on sick-notes and mental ill-health In 2010, Black addressed the Fit for Work Europe organisation, of which she is a co-president (the organisation focuses on the consequences of musculoskeletal disorders when they affect people of working age). In her address, she said that the government had appointed her to her national director role because \\"...we had far too many people leaving the workforce with relatively mild musculoskeletal conditions, stress, anxiety, depression...and many of those people received no immediate help to keep them in the workplace...they were leaving the workplace to go into the benefits system\\". She also said: \\"If I had to summarise what we have been trying to do in the United Kingdom, it would be to say: get rid of the old system of the paper sick-note, put it in red because it's dangerous, it's not good advocacy for your patient\\". The key assumption underpinning Black's thinking is that because people are living longer they will have to work longer - hence the need for more effective intervention when working people fall ill, so that they can remain in the workforce instead of retiring on medical grounds or going onto benefits. In March 2015, Black expanded on her views in a talk to Investors In People. When outlining the common causes of sickness absence, she said: \\"Very often what the GP will write on a medical certificate...isn't really the truth. When I did the independent review on sickness absence for the government, I talked to lots of people who were collecting their sicknotes and what they said is: 'I hate my line manager. I'm never going back to that job'. But no GP I've ever known writes anything other than a 'medical' diagnosis; the closest they get is 'stress' or 'anxiety' - often not the truth at all\\". At the same time she drew a sharp distinction between what she called \\"real\\" illnesses such as \\"cancer\\", \\"diabetes\\" and \\"endogenous depression\\", and other phenomena such as \\"stress, anxiety, and mild depression\\", which she claimed were characterised by \\"little or no objective disease or impairment\\" and were \\"not serious illnesses\\". They were, she said, usually a normal human response to something like an unhealthy workplace or a poor line manager and should be handled accordingly, by tackling the original cause of the stress in the workplace, not only by addressing the individual responding to stressful circumstances. In May 2015, Black addressed the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development. She told the audience that milk anxiety and depression have \\"no objective signs. When you examine a person, you can't get an objective disease; it's not in front of you\\" - a claim that appears to diverge from the principles underpinning the mental state examination, where clinical signs of anxiety, such as tremor, or clinical signs of serious depression, such as psychomotor retardation, are identified. She also appeared to suggest that because mental illnesses do not show up on X-rays, they have less of a scientific basis than diseases that do. With stress disorders and depression, she explained: \\"If you order an X-ray or a test, you don't get a positive result\\". Fit for work service In 2011, the Coalition government asked Black to work with David Frost, the Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce, to compile another report on sickness absence. The study was sponsored jointly by the Department for Work and Pensions and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, and was entitled Health at work - an independent review of sickness absence. The work built on Black's 2008 report into sickness absence and explored largely the same themes. One recommendation of the joint report was the creation of a national assessment service for off-sick employees, provided by the private sector but designed, funded and overseen by central government, which could be used by managers and employees who did not have access to their own occupational health service, as well as by GPs considering whether to issue a fit-note. This echoed ideas in Black's 2008 report, in which she also foresaw such a scheme being used to rehabilitate long-term recipients of Incapacity Benefit. The other recommendations were: * Further modification of the fit note to make it less job-specific * Better management of sickness absence in the public sector * Changes to Statutory Sick Pay administration * The abolition of the Percentage Threshold Scheme, which compensates employers in firms with high rates of sickness absence * A job-brokering service, to find new work for employees on long-term sick leave * Changing sickness certification to further reduce the influence of GPs in deciding entitlement to out-of-work sickness benefits Fit for work, the national assessment service envisaged in the report, was launched in 2015. It gives advice to employers and GPs over the telephone or online. The vast majority of employee assessments - which are voluntary - are carried out over the telephone by health professionals from a variety of backgrounds who have undergone role-specific training and are referred to as \\"case managers\\". For face-to-face assessments - expected to be undergone by only a \\"limited number of patients\\" with complex problems \\\\- the off-sick employee will need to travel for up to 90 minutes to meet their assessor. The British Medical Association was critical of the language used by the government when describing the service. It said it was \\"misleading\\" to claim that Fit for work was offering occupational health advice and support when the emphasis was on sickness absence management and providing a focused return to work. In October 2015, the website Personnel Today revealed that, in order to tackle \\"ongoing concerns within the profession\\" about the scheme's low profile, 'Fit For work' had \\"linked up with conciliation service Acas to unveil a programme of awareness-raising events around the country\\". The main vehicle for raising awareness about the scheme was a roadshow featuring David Frost, the co-author of Black's 2011 report, as the keynote speaker. Personnel Today also reported criticism of the narrow scope of 'Fit for work' by AXA PPP Healthcare, an existing private occupational healthcare provider. AXA's Director of Health Consulting warned that 'Fit for work' wasn't a panacea for all sickness absence issues; in particular, he pointed out that the government-funded service only covered sickness absence of four weeks or more, which would not be responsive enough to address health conditions that could benefit from earlier intervention. In England and Wales, 'Fit for work' is operated by a division of Maximus, the global outsourcing firm that took over the running of the other, much-criticised, government-designed 'fitness for work' assessment process - the one used to judge eligibility for out-of-work sickness benefits - when Atos Healthcare quit that contract prematurely in March 2015. Health and social security =Independent Review of Drugs= On 8 February 2019 Professor Dame Carol Black was appointed to lead a major 2-part review that will look into the ways in which drugs are fuelling serious violence; and treatment, recovery and prevention. =Work capability assessment= One conclusion of Black's 2011 report concerned the sickness benefits system. Black felt that too many claims for the out-of-work sickness benefit Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) did not meet the threshold for eligibility, yet a Work Capability Assessment (WCA) only took place after an assessment phase lasting at least 13 weeks (during which, the claimant is nominally paid ESA but receives the same amount of money as they would if they were on Jobseekers Allowance). She was concerned that this phase might wrongly lead some patients to believe that they were too ill to work - because they were receiving assessment rate ESA and because their GP had indicated that they were not fit for work on the medical certificate needed to initiate a claim - and that it represented a substantial delay in returning to work for those claimants who would later be judged able to work despite their chronic illness or disability; she therefore recommended that the assessment phase be abolished and that ESA only be considered after a WCA has taken place and the claimant has been found unfit for work. The DWP did not take up her recommendation. In 2014, the number of jobless claimants on the WCA waiting- list ballooned to more than half a million because of problems with the delivery of the WCA itself. This exacerbated the situation that Black had identified in 2011: the waiting time for a WCA now stretched well beyond 13 weeks but these claimants were not included in the official 'claimant count' - a key indicator of the level of unemployment nationally - nor available to Jobcentre Plus staff for help in finding work. By then however, once they had eventually undergone their WCA, the proportion of new claimants being declared unfit for work had risen to 75%. =Obesity, drug dependency and ESA= In February 2015, the Prime Minister asked Black to advise him urgently on whether withdrawing out-of-work sickness benefits from obese people and those struggling with drug or alcohol addiction would encourage them to seek further medical help for their problems. Mark Harper, who was then a minister of state at the Department for Work and Pensions, told BBC News on 14 February that David Cameron had asked Black to \\"report back to him in July\\". The scheme was then incorporated into the Conservative Party's manifesto published before the general election in May. In July, the new government formally re-announced the study, with Black expected to produce her report by the end of 2015. When quizzed by BBC Radio 4 in October about David Cameron's request, Black said that she had asked for \\"some time to think about it\\" but had then been told that the announcement had already been scheduled for the following morning; in the circumstances, she thought: \\"I might as well just say yes\\". She acknowledged that substance misuse has little in common with rheumatology, saying that it could be argued that \\"perhaps it didn't follow on from my other work\\" but pointed to her reports since 2008 on sickness absence and the assessment phase of the WCA as evidence of her relevant expertise. The review encountered early criticism from other experts. As Black herself said in the executive summary of her 2008 report: \\"Many common diseases are directly linked to lifestyle factors, but these are generally not the conditions that keep people out of work. Instead, common mental health problems and musculoskeletal disorders are the major causes of sickness absence and worklessness through ill-health\\". When asked by the BBC whether she was concerned that her work might be manipulated for political gain, she replied: \\"Of course I worry, but all the work I've ever done, both medically and in the reviews I've done for government - and I think they know this - have [sic] been as evidence-based as I could possibly make them\\". In February 2016, Black was the 'castaway' on Desert Island Discs. When asked about the Prime Minister's idea she said the real question was: \\"How do you trigger the right response in people? Because lecturing people, bashing them on the head - on the whole, we know - doesn't get us there\\". Kirsty Young, the presenter, suggested that Black was \\"somebody who might think that a simplistic political soundbite isn't even beginning to address the underlying issues of, culturally, what we're finding such a problem right now\\". Black replied: \\"What I would say is that this is a hugely complex problem and not one thing alone will ever solve it\\". Other appointments Black was Principal of Newnham College in Cambridge (one of the few remaining single-sex higher education institutions in the UK) until July 2019, a trustee of the National Portrait Gallery and a member of the governing body of Uppingham School. At Newnham, a women's college, she practised what she preached: she had showers installed to enable university employees to wash after cycling to work; the college bought five bicycles of its own for use on errands; and there is always salad in the staff canteen. In 2018, the 20th anniversary of the British Library's opening of its St. Pancras building, Black was appointed Chair of the British Library. Awards and honours She was made a CBE in 2002 in recognition of her research work on scleroderma. She was upgraded to DBE in 2005 while she was President of the Royal College of Physicians. She was made an honorary Doctor of Science by the University of Bristol in 2003.

At least one station, CKOI-FM in Montreal, is licensed for over 300 kW (307,000 watts). \\"CKOI-FM Maintains Super-Power Status With Solution From Dielectric\\". Creative Planet Network, February 14, 2012.  Regulation of Canadian content  One of the more contentious parts of Canadian broadcast history is the Canadian content (Cancon) requirements. Launched in 1970, to maintain a sense of Canadian stations being \\"Canadian\\", it required 35% of all broadcast content be of Canadian origin. With music, a special system was created to clarify what is considered Canadian content and what isn't. Last modified in 1991, most compact discs and cassettes in Canada come with the MAPL symbol on them. Canadian content is calculated by a simple circle divided into four parts (M, A, P and L). Two of the four parts must be shaded to be considered Canadian content. * M = Music * A = Artist * P = Producer * L = Lyrics In the late 1990s and into the 2000s, there was a migration of Canadian AM stations to FM broadcasting. In some cases, the AM channel has been left idle; in others \\"specialized\\" stations have taken over.  Community broadcasting  Most Canadian cities of 50,000 or more people tend to have a community radio station. Typically these stations operate between 1000 W to 5000 W on FM.  Aboriginal broadcasting  = FM regulatory aspects = In 1991, Section 3 of the Broadcasting Act was amended to state that \\"the Canadian broadcasting system ... should ... reflect ... the special place of Aboriginal peoples within (Canadian) society ... \\", and that \\" ... programming that reflects the Aboriginal cultures of Canada should be provided within the Canadian broadcasting system as resources become available for the purpose.\\" Aboriginal broadcasting has been mostly a post 1980s phenomena in Canada, and has only had formal regulatory support since the 1990s. Mostly the broadcasting has been on the FM band, as the AM band in Canada is mostly full and has been at capacity due to US night-time MW signals reaching into Canada. = Mileposts in aboriginal broadcasting = Aboriginal broadcasting in Canada is mostly on the FM band. In June 2000, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) announced that Aboriginal Voices Radio had been granted a licence for a station in Toronto, with transmitter on the CN Tower. While only 2% of the content would be in Aboriginal languages, the CRTC stipulated that the programming should be \\" ... oriented to the native population, and reflect the specific interests and needs of that audience.\\" In October 2000, Aboriginal Voices applied for a licence to operate a radio network for First Nations audiences, and the application was granted in February 2001. AVR was later granted licences for stations in Ottawa, Calgary, Vancouver, Kitchener-Waterloo and Montreal. Separately from Aboriginal Voices, numerous smaller First Nations radio stations operate in local communities, although each often serves a large geographic region through the use of rebroadcast transmitters. Such operations include CFNR-FM in Northern British Columbia, the Missinipi Broadcasting Corporation in Saskatchewan, CFWE-FM in Alberta, the Wawatay Native Communications Society in Northwestern Ontario and the Taqramiut Nipingat network in Quebec. = Aboriginal radio stations = Organizational format [Call Letters; City/Town, Province] * CFIE-FM Toronto, Ontario * CFNR-FM Terrace, British Columbia * CFWE-FM Edmonton, Alberta * CHCR-FM Killaloe, Ontario * CHFN-FM Wiarton, Ontario * CHLE-FM Yellowknife, Northwest Territories * CHMO-FM Moosonee, Ontario * CHMZ-FM Tofino, British Columbia * CHON-FM Whitehorse, Yukon * CINC-FM Winnipeg, Manitoba * CJLR-FM La Ronge, Saskatchewan * CKON-FM Akwesasne, Ontario * CKRK-FM Kahnawake, Quebec * CKRZ-FM Ohsweken, Ontario * CKTI-FM Kettle Point, Ontario * CKUN-FM Christian Island, Ontario * CKWO-FM Fort Frances, Ontario  Station identification  Historical notes * The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) originally assigned the call letter blocks VAA to VGZ to Canada.

The company was then the longest consecutively running stage magic show in the world, according to Guinness World Records.Announcing the Auction of The Le Grand David Spectacular Magic Show Marco the Magi (Cesareo Pelaez) started the show in the 1970s. The family-oriented stage magic show ran most Sundays at the Cabot Street Cinema Theatre and some Thursdays at the Larcom Theatre in Beverly, Massachusetts through the Spring of 2012.  Overview  On February 20, 1977, with little advance publicity, Le Grand David and his own Spectacular Magic Company made its debut on the stage of the Cabot Street Cinema Theatre, and ran for 35 years. In 1985, the Le Grand David Company opened a second two-hour spectacle of magic, music, comedy, and dance at Beverly's other antique playhouse, the Larcom Theatre. The two productions showcase: over 1000 costumes, 700 entrances and exits, 100 classic illusions, 45 backdrops, 35 years in a small town, 4 hours of stage magic, and 2 antique theaters. The shows were produced, directed, designed and choreographed by Marco the Magi. In the spring of 2012 it was announced that *the Cabot and Larcom productions would cease; *the Cabot St. Cinema Theatre would continue showing films only; and *that both theaters and adjoining spaces would be available for rental for functions. An auction of props, artwork, bronzes and memorabilia was held on February 23, 2014.http://www.cabotcinemamovies.com/cabotcinemamovies.com/Enter_Cabot_Street_Cinema_Theatre_Beverly_MA_Movies_files/PgA7.png With over 200 items available, the auction was conducted by Kaminski Auctioneers.http://www.kaminskiauctions.com/servlet/Search.do?auctionId=15&&page;=1&perPage;=20&orderBy;=  Marco the Magi  Marco the Magi (Cesareo Pelaez, October 16, 1932 - March 24, 2012) is billed as the troupe‚Äôs founder, producer, director, designer, and choreographer. He was also a star in both productions. He began to organize his troupe in the early 1970s and brought it to Beverly. The aging Cabot Cinema became available in 1976, and the company Marco already had been forming acquired the playhouse outright. A biography of Cesareo Pelaez (Wonderful Surprises, author Avrom Surath) was published in April 2007 (second, updated edition in March 2012) relating Pelaez's early experiences growing up in Cuba, his work with noted psychologist Abraham Maslow, his founding Le Grand David Spectacular Magic Company, and his ongoing work with the company to 2012, the year of his death.  Le Grand David  Le Grand David (David Bull) began as an apprentice to Marco in the early 1970s, and is a generation younger than Marco. According to magic historian Stuart Cramer, ‚ÄúLe Grand David is an extraordinarily skillful magician and showman. He adds youth, verve, and graceful motion to a show filled with color and action. David‚Äôs manipulation of the Zombie [floating silver ball] is the best I have ever even the immortal Neil Foster‚Äôs.‚Äù (MAGICOL: A Journal of the Magic Collectors‚Äô Association, November, 1993) Company history By 1976, the Cabot Cinema seemed on the downslope of its career, offering last-run movies for pocket change. A corporation called White Horse Productions was formed to buy and renovate it. Spearheading the project was the man now known as Marco the Magi, aided by business and artistic friends. The Cabot was kept open as a movie house, renamed the Cabot Street Cinema Theatre with a revamped film program. Meanwhile, the troupe undertook a concentrated effort to restore her full stage, which lay thick with the dust of fifty years‚Äô disuse. Office space above Cabot Street was transformed into workshops for carpenters, painters, and seamstresses. The hundreds of props and scenic elements turned out during six months‚Äô work were gradually put into play in after-hours rehearsals. An entertainment calendar published every two weeks began announcing the debut of a stage attraction just after holiday time 1976. On a day remembered for heavy snow and a sizable, receptive house, Le Grand David and his own Spectacular Magic Company premiered Sunday, February 20, 1977. Headed by Marco and his one-time apprentice David, the company of several dozen performers gave weekly Sunday matin√©e performances until mid-May. Then a second Sunday show was added, at 8:15 p.m. By mid-summer even this schedule was not enough to meet demand. ‚ÄúThe Whirlwind of Enchantment‚Äù offered eighteen shows in a fortnight. Boston-area theatergoers and the regional media were beginning to catch wind of Beverly‚Äôs enchantment. It would be three years before the story went international, carried around the globe by the likes of TIME and Smithsonian magazines and an enthralled magic press. Robert Lund (1920‚Äì1995), founder and curator of the American Museum of Magic in Marshall, Michigan, dubbed it ‚Äúthe finest magic show in the world today.‚Äù The Le Grand David Spectacular Magic Company soon became a cultural institution. Seven performances at the White House in Washington, D.C., over 40 cover stories in magic periodicals followed. Robert Lund wrote, ‚ÄúOf all the practitioners of the presto trade in the U.S., none has better credentials to the title of America‚Äôs national magic company than Le Grand David.‚Äù The esteemed British magic historian and collector Dr. Edwin Dawes called the Beverly bafflers ‚Äúmagicdom‚Äôs most incredible venture.‚Äù Building on the success of the Cabot effort, the Le Grand David Spectacular Magic Company purchased the Larcom Theatre, just four blocks away, in 1984 and launched a restoration project that dwarfed their previous Cabot Street Cinema Theatre restoration . The Larcom received a balcony-to- boiler-room renovation. In October 1985 the Le Grand David troupe premiered a second resident production of conjuring, music, comedy and dance ‚Äúin the style and tradition of the turn of the last century.‚Äù An Anthology of Stage Magic continues to play there. In 1995, the Le Grand David Company opened an expanded wing adjoining the original Larcom structure. The new wing includes: the Grand Salon lobby appointed in oak, marble, and brass, rehearsal place, three galleries of Le Grand David apparatus and poster artwork, a library, a meeting room, a guest suite, and a caretaker's apartment.  Honors  *The Le Grand David troupe has been called ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs national magic company‚Äù by historian Robert Lund. Like the theatres in which it performs, the magic company‚Äôs thirty years of continuous performances have given its community a source of genuine pride. *TIME magazine proclaims in its two-page spread: ‚ÄúWith the crash of a gong, the curtain flies up and smoke billows out from the stage as a team of magicians begins 2¬Ω hours of joyous entertainment that recalls the most opulent days of vaudeville . . . . Spectacular it is . . . The real magic about Le Grand David is the cast and their locale. The show goes on not on Broadway but in Beverly, Mass., a Boston suburb, though it looks as lushly endowed as any Great White Way musical,‚Äù (Jeff Melvoin, ‚ÄúConjuring Only On Sundays,‚Äù TIME magazine, May 12, 1980). *The Theatre Historical Society of America brought the attendees from its 2006 Conclave to Beverly to tour the Cabot and Larcom Theatres.

She was also a regular on The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show and on the soap opera Bob and Victoria. Bender also appeared on Errand of Mercy and Screen Directors Playhouse. Stage Bender appeared in a number of stage plays throughout the Los Angeles area. Personal life On June 26, 1953, Bender married fellow Pasadena City College student and future Gunsmoke actor Warren Vanders (n√© VanderSchuit); she was only 18 at the time. The couple went their separate ways by spring of 1955, after they had both transferred to Pepperdine University. Later career In 1953, Bender had a supporting role in Ruth Gordon's semi-autobiographical film The Actress, based on her novel Years Ago. The film was directed by hard-hitting George Cukor, and starred heavyweights Spencer Tracy, Jean Simmons, and young Anthony Perkins. By 1955, Dawn was ready to settle down again, this time with Jerry Anderson, another drama student at Pepperdine; they went on to have two children during their marriage. Despite her career's upswing and her status as an up-and-coming ingenue, Dawn was tiring of the demands of acting, and prepared to retire to married life. In 1956, she was recruited by a friend of a friend to act in Tom Graeff's second feature Teenagers from Outer Space. Finally cast in a leading role, Dawn would play Betty Morgan, a girl who helps a rebel alien save earth from imminent destruction. She is credited in the film under the name \\"Dawn Anderson\\", using her married name to avoid strict SAG rules. (Another actor on Teenagers, King Moody, did not fare so well -- in 1962 he and four other SAG actors were fined by the Guild for working below pay scale.) The film debuted in 1959 but by then, Bender's career was winding down. She starred in her last play, Andr√© Gide's The Immoralist in 1962, and retired shortly after. She earned a teaching degree from Loyola Marymount University in the 1970s, and eventually went on to become a schoolteacher in Los Angeles county, where she taught for almost 40 years.

During her active research career from the 1940s to the 1960s, she made important contributions to the understanding of the biochemistry and photochemistry of vision in vertebrates and invertebrates. In 1967, she and George Wald shared the Paul Karrer Gold Medal for their work in this area. In the late 1960s, her interests shifted from science to societal issues and activism. Early life and education In 1924, Hubbard was born Ruth Hoffmann in Vienna, Austria. Her parents, Richard Hoffmann and Helene Ehrlich Hoffmann, were both physicians and leftist intellectuals.Sarah Corbett, The lives they lives: Ruth Hubbard, New York Times, December 21, 2016 Her mother was also a concert-quality pianist, and as a child, Ruth showed promise on the piano as well. When Nazi Germany annexed Austria in 1938, the Hoffmanns immigrated to the United States to escape. The family settled first in Brookline, Massachusetts, where Ruth graduated Brookline High School, and then in Cambridge. In 1944, Ruth graduated from Radcliffe College with a B.A. in biochemical sciences. Ruth decided to enroll at Radcliffe College with the intent to pursue a pre-medicine degree, which she attributes to the fact that everyone around her was a doctor. At that time, Radcliffe was a sister institution to Harvard since women were not yet allowed to enroll at the university. Ruth sensed the disdain that the distinguished Harvard professors had for the system that required them to travel to the Radcliffe campus to teach the small female classes after teaching the same lecture to their male students at Harvard. However, by 1946 most classes were coeducational and taught by Harvard professors. For a brief period, Ruth was interested in pursuing a degree in Philosophy and Physics, and even though she was never explicitly told not to go into Physics, she got the feeling that she was not welcome. She attributes this feeling of unease to the time that she took a coeducational Physics course in which she was only one of two women in the class of 350 students. Ruth finally settled on biochemical sciences, and in 1944 graduated from Radcliffe College with a B.A. in biochemical sciences. Out of a desire to help the Allied War effort in World War II, Ruth joined the laboratory of George Wald, where they conducted research on infrared vision. She briefly relocated to Chattanooga where her first husband Frank Hubbard was stationed. When the war ended, they returned to Cambridge. Ruth returned to Radcliffe in 1946 in pursuit of her doctorate in biology. She was awarded a predoctoral fellowship by the U.S. Public Health Service in 1948, allowing her to study at the University College Hospital Medical School in London. Ruth received her PhD in biology in 1950. Scientific career After receiving her PhD from Harvard, Ruth became a research fellow. She worked under George Wald, investigating the biochemistry of retinal and retinol. According to an interview given by Ruth, together they built on the work that Wald had researched during a fellowship following his own doctorate degree. He had confirmed the long-held belief that vitamin A was related to vision. Not only did he find that light absorption liberated vitamin A, he also found an intermediate of the visual pigment rhodopsin and vitamin A. This intermediate was the base of Ruth‚Äôs early work, where she attempted to determine the chemistry of the rhodopsin cycle. In 1952, Ruth received a Guggenheim Fellowship at the Carlsberg Laboratory in Copenhagen, Denmark. Wald shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1967 for his discoveries about how the eye works. In the same year, the pair was awarded the Paul Karrer Gold Medal specifically for their work with rhodopsin. Hubbard made many important contributions to the visual sciences but her single most important contribution was the fact that visual excitation is initiated by a chemical rearrangement of the visual pigment (rhodopsin) which is called a cis-trans isomerization. She showed that this is the only direct action of light on the visual system. She also identified the specific intermediate in the visual cycle (called metarhodopsin2) that leads to downstream effects, that culminate in a light-activated neural signaling to the brain Hubbard also described the bleaching and resynthesis of the rhodopsin molecule each time a photon is absorbed. She also discovered retinene isomerase (now called RPE65) that converts all-trans retinal (the post-illumination form) back into 11-cis retinal. She also studied the visual pigments in several new species. Her early work focused on the basic properties of rhodopsin, which is a combination of the chromophore (retinal) and a protein called opsin, which is reutilized in the resynthesis of rhodopsin. Hubbard published at least 31 scientific papers devoted to vision. Social commentary and political activity In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Hubbard became interested in social and political dimensions of biological issues. In her book The Politics of Women's Biology, she wrote that she had been a \\"devout scientist\\" from 1947 until the late 1960s, but the Vietnam War and the women's liberation movement led her to change her priorities. Hubbard describes an instance where she was working with squid as one of the pivotal moments where her interests shifted from scientific research to social relevance. Despite working with squid, cattle, and frogs for years when researching the complexities of vision, at that instant it suddenly began to bother her. She said, ‚ÄúI began to have the feeling that nothing I could find out was worth killing another squid.‚Äù Around the same time in the late 1960s, as a member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Ruth was asked to give a talk about being a female in the sciences. While conducting interviews of her fellow female scientists, Hubbard discovered that they were all in similar situations. Each of the women were accomplished in their fields, yet none of them had real jobs. They all had what Ruth called ‚Äúnonjobs.‚Äù They had titles such as lecturer or associate which meant they had little to no job security, while their male-counterparts were either on the path to professorships or had already received tenure. This led Ruth and others to join a group that petitioned Harvard to reevaluate the job statuses of its female faculty. Ruth Hubbard was the first woman to be offered a tenured Harvard professorship in the Biology Department in 1973. After being promoted in 1973 from what she called the \\"typical women's ghetto\\" of \\"research associate and lecturer\\" positions to a tenured faculty position at Harvard, she felt increased freedom to pursue new interests.Ruth Hubbard (1990), The Politics of Women's Biology, Rutgers University Press. pp. 1‚Äì2. . One such interest manifested itself in the new seminar course she taught at Harvard titled ‚ÄúBiology 109 - Biology and Women‚Äôs Issues.‚Äù The class looked at the role of women in science and how the absence of women in scientific fields had affected the scientific questions that were asked. In the late 1980s and 1990s, Ruth gave several interviews challenging the power structure in STEM fields. What constitutes science, she told the Globe in 1990, usually is decided by ‚Äúa self-perpetuating, self-reflexive group: by the chosen for the chosen,‚Äù and those ‚Äúchosen‚Äù historically were upper-class white men. ‚ÄúWomen and nonwhite, working-class and poor men have largely been outside the process of science-making,‚Äù Dr. Hubbard told The New York Times in 1981. ‚ÄúThough we have been described by scientists, by and large we have not been the describers and definers of scientific reality. We have not formulated the questions scientists ask, nor have we answered them. This undoubtedly has affected the content of science, but it has also affected the social context and the ambience in which science is done.‚Äù She became known as a strong critic of sociobiology. Geneticist Richard Lewontin has said, \\"No one has been a more influential critic of the biological theory of women's inequality than Ruth Hubbard.\\"Ruth Hubbard , Harvard University Department of the History of Science, web content accessed July 27, 2011 In a 2006 essay entitled \\"Race and Genes,\\" she wrote: > It is beyond comprehension, in this century which has witnessed holocausts > of ethnic, racial, and religious extermination in many parts of our planet, > perpetrated by peoples of widely different cultural and political > affiliations and beliefs, that educated persons‚Äîscholars and popularizers > alike‚Äîcan come forward to argue, as though in complete innocence and > ignorance of our recent history, that nothing could be more interesting and > worthwhile than to sort out the \\"racial\\" or \\"ethnic\\" components of our > thoroughly mongrelized species so as to ascertain the root identity of each > and everyone of us. And where to look for that identity if not in our > genes?Ruth Hubbard (June 7, 2006), Race & Genes. raceandgenomics.ssrc.org Ruth also became a critic of recombinant DNA research, in a time when the field was booming. She was concerned that people were attempting to assign every trait, disease, and behavior a genetic cause, leading to an oversimplification of science which does not consider the complexities of nature and outside factors. She termed this craze ‚Äúgenomania.‚Äù She was also worried about the safeguards surrounding such research. In a letter published by the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Hubbard stated that if an epidemic caused by a recombinant organism were to break out, it would be almost impossible to distinguish it from the natural E. coli strains that humans are already exposed to. =Commentary on gender and science= In her essay \\"Science and Science Criticism,\\" published in 2001 as a chapter of The Gender and Science Reader, Hubbard iterates that she is a scientist and states that \\"[n]ature is part of history and culture\\", but not vice versa. She goes on to say that scientists are largely unable to grasp the concept of nature being part of life--- noting how she needed several years to understand the statement. Going into her scientific history, the narrator mentions how she originally never questioned how her efforts fit into society. Narrowing her focus, she exposits that the Vietnam-era women's rights and women's liberation movements helped teach her of the roles of science in society. She continues forth with the various means of debate for both sides. One notable instance from men is when they revive various old and unfounded biological theories on women to justify the typical subservient positions of the female gender. Hubbard even refers to the means of debate as \\"breathing new life\\" into old theories and assumptions. She further exposits the issues revolving around gender equality that were mainly brought to her attention by how she and her colleagues suddenly started getting promoted from their \\"ghetto\\" lab positions right into proper titles. She promptly stresses that \\"[she believes] the subject of women's biology is profoundly political\\", explaining away the book's title as she does so. Proceeding onward her desire to go beyond \\"defining [women as a whole] as victims of male power and dominance,\\" and pushes for women everywhere to show independence and individuality while learning to accept and embrace the biology that's continuously used by men to undermine them. To follow up, she goes on to talk about women's health activists re-educating women on the functions of their body and goes on to encourage women to use the re-education to attain great power by eliminating the footholds of male misinformation and misrepresentation of their bodies. The essay asserts that women scientists must ultimately and paradoxically turn away from the sciences to make their stand against male supremacy as opposed to the many female and feminist poets, novelists, and artists that can illustrate their points clearly and easily. She notes that politics seems to vanish within the sciences, exemplifying this point by noting social classes aren't a specific category listed under US health studies. The point she makes is that social and political realities can be blended or integrated subtly into all mediums. The subtlety of the integration ultimately creates great difficulty in discerning fact from prejudice. In addition, artists, novelists, and poets can compose their works without being victim to review under the funding agencies that makes the use of scientific fact tedious and less effective. The author leads in to surmise that the issues around women's rights must be raised and brought into public focus. After bringing up how science integrates itself into culture, she exemplifies the point by noting the prominence of biological terms in historical terminology and alluringly points out a biologist's tendency to place humanity above all other animals--- not unlike how men view women and their desire for equality. She raises the question of whether or not women can improve the sciences but makes an attempt to bring into attention her belief that women can make an impact. Hubbard closes by saying that scientists never want their work to be forgotten and lost, and that she sides with feminism for political insight and analytic testing on the scientific assumptions about women. Personal life Hubbard and Wald in 1967 Ruth Hoffman was married to WWII GI and fellow Harvard graduate Frank Hubbard in 1942. Ruth fondly remembered the months that the pair spent traveling via motorcycle across Europe as Frank researched harpsichords. The couple divorced in 1951. Ruth had met her second husband, George Wald, while they were both at Harvard. Wald was a Professor of Biology and Ruth‚Äôs boss in the research lab. However, the two began and kept their love affair a secret for more than a decade since they were married to other people at the time. After their respective divorces to previous partners, Ruth and George married in 1958. The couple had two children: a son, musician and music historian Elijah Wald, and a daughter, attorney Deborah Wald. Hubbard would go on to publish a book, Exploding the Gene Myth, with her son Elijah. Both Ruth and her brother Alexander followed in the footsteps of their activist parents. Alexander Hoffman was a well-known lawyer and activist. Some of his high-profile clients included Cesar Chavez, Lenny Bruce, and multiple members of the Black Panther Party. Like her brother, Ruth Hubbard was an outspoken activist. However, she was not only known for her commentary on science in society but was also as an antiwar and antinuclear war activist, for which she was once arrested on charges of civil disobedience. Like her second husband, Ruth remained scientifically active until about 1975, and she made an excellent scientific presentation of George Wald's work at a symposium in his honor. George Wald was 18 years older than Hubbard and he died in 1996.

Boehler was one of the many missionaries sent out to the Americas in the early 18th century by the leader of the Moravian Church, Nicolaus Ludwig Zinzendorf. As a part of the first large scale Protestant missionary movement, Boehler spread the religion across Georgia and other American colonies. In 1740, he migrated with other Moravians to Pennsylvania, where they founded the towns of Nazareth and Bethlehem. Boehler was superintendent of the Moravian Church in England from 1747 to 1753 and was made a bishop of the church in 1748. Boehler came back to America and directed new Moravian settlements in the colonies from 1753 to 1764. Early life Boehler was born in Frankfurt am Main, then part of Holy Roman Empire, on December 31, 1712. Peter was the fourth child of brewers Johann Konrad Peter B√∂hler and his wife Antonetta Elisabetha. Boehler attended school in Frankfurt, and went to the University of Jena in 1731. His father wanted him to study medicine, but Boehler was drawn into studying theology by the university's well-known faculty members such as Johann Franz Buddeus, Johann Georg Walch and Nicolaus Ludwig Zinzendorf. Walch and Zinzendorf greatly influenced Boehler, and showed him the ways of Pietism a movement within Lutheranism that was instrumental in the upbringing of the Methodist movement later started by John Wesley. The Pietist movement combined the Lutheran emphasis on biblical doctrine with the Reformed, but with a particular emphasis on a vigorous Christian life and behavior over intellectual doctrine. Zinzendorf used his influence on the Moravian Church to gather more supporters of the Pietist movement, including Boehler. As a missionary On December 15, 1737, in his first official act as bishop, Count von Zinzendorf ordained Boehler to priesthood. On February 7 of the following year, when he was in London preparing for his trip to the Americas, Boehler met John Wesley, who would later found the Methodist movement, who had just returned from a two-year stint as chaplain of Savannah, Georgia. After Wesley met Boehler at the home of a Mr. Weinatz, a Dutch merchant living in London at the time, Wesley offered to obtain lodging for Boehler and introduced him to James Hutton, who would later be an important official in the Moravian Church. Wesley accompanied Boehler on his trip to Oxford, during which the two began an extensive and very personal discourse on the nature of faith. Wesley had returned to England as a troubled man, depressed over his lack of faith and his work in America. At the time, Wesley wrote in his journal, \\"I who went to America to convert others was never myself converted to God\\". Boehler's counsel on the nature of grace and \\"heart religion\\" was instrumental in the conversions of both John and Charles Wesley. Boehler himself went as a missionary to Savannah and South Carolina. As part of Zinzendorf's plans to revive the Moravian Church, Boehler preached the ways of the religion to black slaves and Native Americans, as well as white settlers in the colonies. In 1740, after the Moravians were expelled from Savannah, Boehler led the group of Moravians from Georgia to Pennsylvania. They founded the towns of Nazareth and Bethlehem, both of which are still-thriving populous Moravian communities. Boehler was almost a savior for many of the Moravian people in these communities. During times of crisis, he was accounted as the preacher who could restore the peace and hope that people were so desperately looking for. He went back to England to organize a new group of people to send to America. This group of emigrants called the \\"Sea Congregation\\" traveled with Boehler and settled in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania in 1742. Universalist tendencies were not unknown among Moravians and Boehler himself believed in the universal reconciliation of all people. Boehler believed that the grace of Christ was so compelling that it would eventually win all hearts, a belief that is subtly distinct from Universalism. George Whitfield (an ardent Calvinist), in a letter to John Wesley, wrote that Boehler had expressed a belief that \\"all the damned souls would hereafter be brought out of hell.\\"\\"Peter Bohler, a brief biography.\\" at TentMaker.org. Accessed Nov. 2, 2007. After five years, he was made superintendent of the Moravian Church in England. The following year, Boehler was ordained as a bishop of the Moravian churches in America and England. In 1753, Boehler left his post as superintendent, and returned to America. He then served as the director of new Moravian settlements there until 1764. Boehler spent the last nine years of his life back in England, still an active member of the church. He died in London on April 27, 1775, at the age of sixty-two.

Plot Klondike Kat (voiced by Mort Marshall) is an anthropomorphic wildcat Mountie. Klondike is always in pursuit of Savoir-Faire (voiced by Sandy Becker), a French-Canadian mouse who constantly steals food and is known for his catchphrase, \\"Savoir-Faire eez everywhere!\\" Savoir-Faire is accompanied by his sled dog Malamutt, who at times, plays the violin as well as the piano, is strong enough to bend steel bars (to break his boss out of jail), and has ears that can detect trouble outside, when Klondike Kat is in its presence. Malamutt's only sounds are a whimper or a growl. Klondike Kat lives in Fort Frazzle and answers to the British-Canadian commanding officer Major Minor (modeled after Terry-Thomas, and voiced by Kenny Delmar). Klondike, though well-meaning, is naturally incompetent and usually causes more trouble than Savoir-Faire in trying to stop him (\\"I'll make mincemeat out of that mouse!\\"); yet, at the end of almost each episode, Klondike would \\"get his mouse\\" somehow (\\"Klondike Kat always gets his mouse.\\"). The humor in the incompetence of the main character (a recurring theme of each episode), Klondike Kat, is not unlike the humor used in Hong Kong Phooey, whose successes are only either thanks to his sidekick, Spot, who provides a solution to the challenges, or the direct result of a comically unintended side effect of his conscious efforts, and not Klondike Kat's skill as a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

Biography  After receiving a diploma from Villanova University (Radnor Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania), he moved to New York City in 1976 and was part of the No Wave scene. As an audio engineer and record producer, he has worked on projects such as Sonic Youth, Glenn Branca, Das Damen, Helmet, Dinosaur Jr, White Zombie, Quicksand, An Albatross, The Dentists, Unrest, and Gumball. To date he has produced and recorded over 200 LPs and CDs, including Helmet‚Äôs Meantime, for which he received a gold record in 1993. He is also known as a percussionist and drummer for Theoretical Girls, Laurie Anderson, and his own Wharton Tiers Ensemble. Tiers started two groups which played his own compositions: A Band, which disbanded in 1980, and Glorious Strangers, which released a self-titled LP in 1984. Since then he has continued to compose and write many different styles of music, including solo piano, synth based instrumentals, opera, and symphonic works. A CD of instrumentals for massed guitars by the Wharton Tiers Ensemble, Brighter Than Life, came out in April 1996, and the follow-up, Twilight Of The Computer Age, was released at the end of 1999. A new Ensemble LP, Freedom Now!, was released in March 2013 on Fun City NYC, a new record label founded by Tiers to release his music. This was followed by \\"A Transendance\\" in June 2014.

Geography It is one of the largest upazilas of Bangladesh. It is a fertile valley between the Sitakunda Hills and the Hills of the Chittagong Hill Tracts. These two hill ranges become one at the northernmost point of the upazila and they widen apart as they proceed southwards. There is no particular geographical place in the upazila called Fatikchhari, rather the entire upazila takes its name from one small all- season rivulet known as Fatikchhari Khal that originates in the Sitakund Hills on the West and enters the Upazila at Bhujpur Union before joining the River Halda, the longest river in Fatikchhari Upazila that runs through the upazila along almost its entire length. Dhurung is its second longest river. There are some small rivers (khals) originating from the hills both on the eastern and western flanks, all being tributaries of the Halda flowing southwards to the sea. Among them are Gazaria, Fatikchhari, Baramasia, Mandakini, Balukhali etc. In between the two hill ranges, Fatikchhari consists of flat farmland annually affected by flash floods caused by heavy rainfall in the hilly catchment areas and the water being drained by several small rivers and the Halda. It is surrounded by Tripura (India) to the north, Hathazari and Kawkhali Upazila (Rangamati District) to the south, Ramgarh, Manikchhari, Lakshmichhari, and Raozan Upazilas on the east, Mirsharai and Sitakunda Upazilas on the west. Demographics According to the 1991 Bangladesh census, Fatikchhari had a population of 388,013, in 65,861 households. Males constituted 50.1% of the population, and females 49.9%. The population aged 18 or over was 182,250. Fatikchhari had an average literacy rate of 32% (7+ years), against the national average of 32.4% literate. The population is a mix of Bengali Muslims and Hindus, Buddhists (all bearing the title Barua); Tripura, Chakma, Mogh (these tribal groups are gradually retreating into the CHTs and are becoming rare in the upazila); and Manipuri and Uria (mainly tea garden workers).

A famous example is the Triple concerto (for piano, violin, cello and orchestra) by Beethoven. There also exist a number of compositions for piano and orchestra which treat the piano as a solo instrument while not being piano concerti. Examples of such works include George Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue, Rachmaninov's Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini and Liszt's Totentanz. The last two of these works are each in variation form, based on the 24th Caprice for solo violin by Niccol√≤ Paganini and the ancient Gregorian Dies Irae chant respectively. There are also works written for orchestra or large ensemble requiring a solo pianist, such as Olivier Messiaen's Des canyons aux √©toiles... and Turangal√Æla- Symphonie, and Karol Szymanowski's 4th Symphony. Composers also occasionally bring orchestral pianists into the limelight, as for example Igor Stravinsky does in episodes of his ballet Petrushka.

Lohagara is situated between Chittagong and Cox's Bazar. It is one of the largest and most densely populated upazilas of Bangladesh. Etymology In 1660, Mughal prince Shah Shuja took shelter in the Kingdom of Arakan to escape from Mir Jumla II. While heading to Arakan, he stayed in a beautiful hilly place (present-day Chunati) between Chittagong and Cox's Bazar for a few days. At the time of departure, he engraved an iron bar in that place as a sign. It is thought that because of engraving iron bar by Shah Shuja the area is called 'Lohagara' since 'Loha' means 'iron'. History Lohagara was once under Satkania Upazila. Lohagara thana was formed in 1981 and it was turned into an upazila in 1983. Geography Tonkaboti canal Lohagara is located at .

Family Siegfried was a member of the Frankish Reginbodonen family of the Rhineland. His father, also called Siegfried, was count of the K√∂nigssondergau. Count Siegfried was succeeded by his son Udalric, who was count of the K√∂nigssondergau and advocate of the diocesan church of Mainz from 1052 to 1074.Eldevik, Episcopal power, p. 221 Career in the church Siegfried was educated in the monastery of Fulda and became a monk there. On 25 December 1058, he was appointed abbot of Fulda and on 6 January 1060, the Empress Agnes appointed him Archbishop of Mainz.Eldevik, Episcopal power, p. 222 In Spring 1062, he entered the political realm as a member of the faction surrounding Anno II of Cologne, who forcibly took control of the regency of the young king, Henry IV in the Coup of Kaiserswerth.Eldevik, Episcopal power, pp. 222f. Nevertheless, Siegfried never had the political influence of Anno or Adalbert of Bremen, and remained a 'third force'. In Winter 1064 - 1065, he undertook a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. In 1069 he presided over the assembly of Worms, at which Henry IV announced his intention to repudiate his wife Bertha. Siegfried wrote to Pope Alexander II asking for help with the matter.P. Jaff√©, ed., Monumenta Bambergensia (1869), no. 34, pp. 64ff., accessible online at archive.org (in Latin) In 1070, he took a pilgrimage to Rome to seek the permission of Pope Alexander II to lay down his title and abdicate, but the pope refused him. Together with Anno II of Cologne, in 1071, he founded a Benedictine monastery at Saalfeld.Eldevik, Episcopal power, pp. 224f. In 1072, under the pretext of a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, he sojourned at Cluny, where he met the Abbot Hugh the Great.Eldevik, Episcopal power, p. 225. The Mainzers, however, demanded his return before he made it to Spain. Upon his return, he ardently undertook the Cluniac reform in his diocese. In 1074, in that vein, he established the monasteries of Ravengiersburg and Hasungen. Siegfried initially sided with Henry IV in the Investiture Controversy between the Holy Roman Emperor and the Roman Catholic Pope. He was one of the German bishops who attempted to depose Pope Gregory VII in 1076. Yet later that same year, when Gregory VII excommunicated Henry IV, Siegfried did an about-face and, at a general assembly of German Aristocrats in Tribur in October 1076, participated in the election of an anti-king, supporting the nobility opposing the Emperor in the civil war that became known as the Great Saxon revolt. Subsequently, Siegfried was driven from his diocese by the outraged royalist citizenry revolting against his rule. Nonetheless, on 25 March 1077, he crowned Henry IV's brother-in-law, duke Rudolf of Rheinfelden as Antiking, since the allied rebels of which he was a part needed the military prestige and might of a king to offset the power of the established monarch given his rapprochement with the Pope. On 26 December 1081, he crowned Herman of Salm as the second anti-king in Goslar. After 1081, he ceased to involve himself in public affairs until his death at Hasungen, where he was buried.

With the emergence of several technological innovations, sheet music evolved in several stages into what was to be termed digital sheet music. Music Notation Software With the increased use of professional and personal computers during the 1980s, different programmers started working on desktop publishing music notation software. Various boxed music notation software applications appeared on the market, allowing users to input and edit sheet music digitally. In the beginning, the software only permitted printing on paper. It took some time before other virtual formats became possible (e.g. standard MIDI file, audio (wav, mp3) and MusicXML export). These files allowed manipulation such as instrument changes, transposition and even MIDI playback. In particular, software projects Finale and Sibelius grew to become successful commercial products and to define certain standards in digital music notation. Many free software projects also appeared (see list of scorewriters). Consequently, computer keyboard entry in combination with synthesizer keyboard entry became the most common method for music data entry in current digital use . OMR Optical music recognition (OMR) is software to ‚Äúread‚Äù scanned sheet music. Although OMR contributed to the evolution of digital sheet music, it is currently still a complex problem . While the earliest attempts of OMR were made in the early 1970s, the first commercial products appeared in the early 90s. Currently, many commercial OMR tools are available: SharpEye2, SmartScore, Photoscore, CapellaScan . OMR can be simplified into four smaller tasks: staff line identification, musical object location, musical feature classification and musical semantics . However, in most cases, these systems operate only properly with well-scanned documents of high quality. When it comes to precision and reliability, none of the commercial OMR systems solve the problem in a satisfactory way . Especially since the tradition of notating music is quite diffuse and varied, it remains difficult to reduce its aesthetics to a few principles for a machine to follow . New commercial possibilities With the emergence of electronic commerce in the 2000s, some traditional sheet publishers, as well as new entrants, developed online retailer websites to offer sheet music in an electronic manner. The first to offer the service online was Sheet Music Direct (1997) but quickly followed by MusicNotes and Sheet Music Score who were able to offer interactive features like transposition and change of instrument using scorch (Avid) technology. Newcomer Sheet Music Plus only recently (2011) entered the market, offering PDF files only. Those commercial services started as worldwide retailers with a large base of licensed sheet music and fast delivery, but progressively offered digital print, ranging from PDF-files to more dynamic offerings such as Scorch technology (Avid) which allowed for midi accompaniment, and on-the- fly change of keys and instruments. In addition, the popular use of digital sheet music required interchangeable digital formats. As such, MusicXML became a common format to share sheet music files between applications and to archive sheet music files for future use. Apps The digital revolution of the 2010s introduced widespread use of mobile networked devices, mobile telephony and tablet computers. Tablet computers, in particular, introduced new opportunities for digital sheet music through their usable digital display (; ). Consequently, many iOS and Android apps were introduced in the sheet music market, offering digital sheet music on various mobile platforms. The first generation viewers displayed PDF-files with features such as basic annotations, exportation of those annotations to other PDF readers and printing scores. PDFs are ‚Äústatic‚Äù files: you can read the music as it appears on the page, and you can only modify the notes by drawing digital ink markings or by typing text on the page . Cloud-based apps Most recently, the rise of cloud computing is further pushing the development of digital sheet music and enables creating and sharing written music online. A cloud-based application is immediately available on the web on any type of computer and does not need to be installed. HTML5 in particular spurs cloud computing, allowing development of device independent web applications and making digital sheet music responsive and appropriate on large as well as on small screens. Cloud-based music notation applications facilitate the creation and sharing of written music. Additionally, other cloud-based applications focus more on the practice and consumption side of music learning. These latter cloud-based applications integrate audio-output such as playback with a variety of tempi (speeds) and with different instrumentation for multi-part scores and make the viewing and playing more interactive by adding personal annotations, automatic page turning, or set lists. Reading digital sheet music Overall, four factors appear to facilitate digital sheet reading: computer, content, containers and controllers : # Computer: depending on the musical work or performance, different form factors might facilitate the digital sheet music consumption # Content: a choice of static content versus dynamic content, and a choice of open content versus proprietary content. # Containers: hardware accessories used to hold or mount your computer # Controllers: hardware accessories that enable you to work with your digital sheet music in a variety of ways, ranging from digital pens to draw annotations, to pedals and other switches that allow you to turn the pages without using your hands.
