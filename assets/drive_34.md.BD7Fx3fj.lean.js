Adler (1868, Slovakia ‚Äì 1938, New Orleans, Louisiana) founded the historic Adler's Jewelry in New Orleans, Louisiana. Arriving in New Orleans in 1896, Adler was active in the local Progressive movement there. He belonged to the Progressive Union, Association of Commerce, Tourist and Conventions Bureau, and the Canal Street Association. He founded Coleman E. Adler Jewelry in 1898, a business that still operates on Canal Street. Photograph of Coleman E. Adler, circa 1899 Early life Coleman E. Adler arrived in New York as boy with his older brother Isaac in 1874. The pair settled in Alabama, where Coleman worked as an apprentice in the jewelry trade as a young man. His early career involved work as a travelling salesman for jewelry firms in New York. His travels brought him to New Orleans, where he met and married Rosa Pokorny. Rosa was the youngest daughter of Michael and Fannie Pokorny. Originally from Moravia, the Pokornys arrived in New Orleans at the beginning of the Civil War. Michael Pokorny was a master shoemaker and eventually owned three successful shoe stores in downtown New Orleans. Over time, Michael Pokorny became one of the largest real estate owners in the city. By the 1890s, the Pokorny family was much-respected in New Orleans business, philanthropic, and social circles. Coleman and Rosa Pokorny Adler lived at the Pokorny estate at 2113 St. Charles Avenue. Home of Coleman and Rosa Pokorny Adler at 2113 St. Charles Avenue, circa 1908 Civic work A resident of New Orleans for 40 years, Coleman Adler worked to improve and promote his adopted hometown. The city's early growth had been stunted by the Civil War, and national economic depression in the 1870s had ravaged the New Orleans economy. The late 1800s, however, was the era of the Progressive movement, which sought to improve society by applying modern ingenuity and methods. In New Orleans, the movement energized local leaders and businessmen to tackle the city's overall decline. Coleman Adler belonged to many of the groups that actively sought to bring New Orleans into the modern era. For many years, Adler was an active member of the Canal Street Association. In the early decades of the 20th century, this body provided reliable sanitation and modern illumination on Canal Street, New Orleans. It also repaired older buildings and helped negotiate work agreements between the city transportation system and its workers. Adler was vice chairman of the Canal Street Association when that body installed electric lighting along Canal in 1930. Thomas Edison flipped the inaugural switch on the new lights, and the New York Times ran a full-page story on the project and lighting ceremony. In 1908, the city's Progressive Union appointed Adler to their Committee of 100. The Committee was created to increase tourism in New Orleans by ‚Äúbringing tourists from the north, east, and west so that wealthy investors may see for themselves the [city‚Äôs] wonderful industrial advantages.‚ÄùTimes-Picayune, March 9, 1909. Adler also served on the Association of Commerce's convention committee, which was charged with increasing the number of large conventions held in the city. In 1910, Adler travelled to Washington, D.C., with a cadre of city leaders to promote New Orleans as the locale for the World Panama Canal Exhibition of 1915. When Theodore Roosevelt visited New Orleans in 1911, Adler was on the reception committee for his visit. Over the years, Coleman helped coordinate a number of important events in the city, including ‚ÄúMade in New Orleans Week,‚Äù a reception for the Ambassador of Italy, and the Commercial Men's Alliance convention. In 1930, Mayor Walmsley appointed Adler head of the city's Retail Stores Committee. During this period, Adler also served on the board of directors of the Young Men's Business League and the New Orleans Zoological Society. Adler's of New Orleans Coleman Adler opened his own jewelry firm in 1898. The store was originally located on Royal Street in the French Quarter. In 1902, Adler's moved to 810 Canal Street, in the heart of the city's bustling retail district. In 1908, Adler's obtained its own building at 722-24 Canal Street and is still there today. Adler's Jewelry, 722 Canal Street, New Orleans, circa 1990 Adler's quickly became a local favorite. From its earliest years, the firm has designed original pieces for the city's many Mardi Gras krewes each carnival season. Adler's has been commissioned to create pieces for many of the area's historic occasions as well. The firm created the 1904 Times-Picayune Loving Cup awarded to education pioneer Sophie B. Wright. In 1906, Adler's created a solid silver tea service that local dignitaries presented to naval crew of the U.S.S. Louisiana. The firm was commissioned to create the official Louisiana Centennial coin in 1912. Adler's designed the silver football perpetual trophy awarded in the annual Thanksgiving Day contest between Tulane University and Centenary College in the 1920s. In 2012, Adler's created the Louisiana Bicentennial coin from the original 1912 press for the Centennial coin. 2012 Louisiana Bicentennial Coin, designed and manufactured by Adler's in New Orleans After decades of hosting fine art and housewares exhibits, Adler's was chosen as the regional dealer for Tiffany and Co. The firm is also the exclusive local dealer of Patek Philippe, Royal Copenhagen, and Gien. Coleman E. Adler died in February, 1938. His sons Milton and Walter Adler continued their father's civic and commercial work, as do their own children and grandchildren today. Sources National Archives Records Administration (NARA).

Oil sand tailings contain a mixture of salts, suspended solids and other dissolvable chemical compounds such as acids, benzene, hydrocarbons residual bitumen, fine silts and water. Large volumes of tailings are a byproduct of bitumen extraction from the oil sands and managing these tailings is one of the most difficult environmental challenges facing the oil sands industry. Location The extent of oil sands in Alberta, Canada In Canada there are three major oil sand deposits, primarily located in the province of Alberta, with some also located in the neighbouring province of Saskatchewan. They are known as Athabasca Oil Sands, Cold Lake oil sands, and Peace River oil sands. The Athabasca Oil Sands Region (AOSR) has 19 tailings ponds.  Components of oil sands tailings ponds  Oil sand tailings or oil sands process-affected water (OSPW), have a highly variable composition and a complex mixture of compounds. In his oft-cited 2008 journal article, E. W. Allen wrote that typically tailings ponds consist of c. 75% water, c. 25% sand, silt and clay, c.2% of residual bitumen, as well as dissolved salts, organics, and minerals. Although many of the components of TPW \\"occur naturally in adjacent landscapes, the mining process increases their concentrations\\", for example, sodium, chloride, sulphate, bicarbonate, and ammonia. Citing research from the 1978 onwards, Allen included naphthenic acids (NAs), bitumen, asphaltenes, creosols, phenols, humic and fulvic acids, benzene, phthalates, toluene, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), in the list of organic compounds in TPW. Allen names aromatic hydrocarbons [including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), benzene, phenols and toluene], naphthenic acids (NAs) and dissolved solids, as those that were most harmful to humans, fish, and birds. As well as toxic metals considered to be priority pollutants such as chromium, arsenic, nickel, cadmium, copper, lead, and zinc, OSPW also contains \\"common, low-toxicity metals\\" including titanium aluminum, molybdenum, iron, and vanadium. The exposure to particulate matter (PM) containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons has been seen to have higher cytotoxicity then PM containing heavy metals. The concentrations of chemicals is harmful to fish, and oil on the surface of the ponds is harmful to birds. The lack of knowledge and identification of individual compounds has become a major hindrance to the handling and monitoring of oil sands tailings. A better understanding of the chemical makeup, including naphthenic acids, it may be possible to monitor rivers for leachate and also to remove toxic components. The identification of individual acids has for many years proved to be impossible but a breakthrough in 2011 in analysis began to reveal what is in the oil sands tailings ponds. Theoretically, as much as ninety percent of the water in the tailings could be reused for further oil extraction.  Size and scope  In 2008 tailings ponds held 732 billion litres of tailings. By 2009, as tailing ponds continued to proliferate and volumes of fluid tailings increased, the Energy Resources Conservation Board of Alberta issued Directive 074 to force oil companies to manage tailings based on aggressive criteria. By 2013, the Government of Alberta reported that tailings ponds covered an area of about . According to a Calgary Herald article, by September 2017, the tailings ponds held c.\\"1.2 trillion litres of contaminated water\\" and covered about . Cost of clean-up A 2018 joint investigation by the Toronto Star, Global News, National Observer, and four Journalism Schools‚ÄîConcordia University, Ryerson University, University of Regina and University of British Columbia‚Äîrevealed that the estimated liability for the clean up cost for \\"oilsands mining operations facilities\\" was about $130 billion. The investigation, which resulted in the series, The Price of Oil, was undertaken by \\"the largest ever collaboration of journalists in Canada\\". The investigation revealed that the security collected from companies to cover the costs of shutting down and cleaning up mining sites including tailings ponds and pipelines was $1.4 billion; and the previous calculated liability was $27.80 billion. The clean-up of tailings ponds, which \\"have sprawled to cover an area the size of Kelowna\\", which is , represent a \\"significant part of the liability.\\" The journalists working on the Price of Oil series were told by experts that the liabilities in the oilsands, mainly tailings ponds, represent almost 50% of the $130 billion in the AER mining category, the total estimated liability. =Syncrude Tailings Dam= right The Syncrude Tailings Dam or Mildred Lake Settling Basin (MLSB) is an embankment dam that is, by volume of construction material, the largest earth structure in the world in 2001. It is located north of Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada at the northern end of the Mildred Lake lease owned by Syncrude Canada Ltd.. The dam and the tailings artificial lake within it are constructed and maintained as part of ongoing operations by Syncrude in extracting oil from the Athabasca Oil Sands. Other tailings dams constructed and operated in the same area by Syncrude include the Southwest Sand Storage (SWSS), which is the third largest dam in the world by volume of construction material after the Tarbela Dam. The MLSB, which is the oldest tailings pond in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region (AOSR), was found in a 2018 report published in the Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics journal to be \\"responsible for the majority of tailings ponds emissions of methane.\\" On 31 December 2018, Syncrude was fined $2.75 million after pleading guilty under the federal Migratory Birds Convention Act (MBCA) and Alberta's Environmental Protection and Enhancement Act in relation to the deaths of 31 great blue herons in August 2015 at the MLSB. At the time the MLSB inactive sump \\"was not covered by Syncrude's waterfowl protection plan to deter birds from landing at tailings areas\\". Doreen Cole, who has been Managing Director of Syncrude Canada since December 2017, \\"We immediately took steps to bring all these areas on our Mildred Lake and Aurora sites into our waterfowl protection plan. We're committed to being a responsible operator and this has strengthened our resolve to reduce the impact of our operations on wildlife.\\" On 22 October 2010 Syncrude was found guilty under the provincial and federal Acts and was fined $3-million, which at that time represented the \\"largest environmental penalty in Alberta history.\\" In 2008, 1,606 ducks died in Syncrude's tailings ponds, which at that time covered an area of 12-square-kilometres, because \\"cannons, effigies and other deterrents\\", intended for use to deter migratory birds, had not been deployed. Syncrude's trial lawyer at that time, Robert White, had urged his client to challenge the guilty verdict. But Syncrude spokeswoman said that they would plead guilty and pay the fine as, \\"At Syncrude, we're eager to move forward. The incident haunted us and we regret that it ever happened.\\" =Horizon tailings dam = right As of 2010, according to the \\"Mature Fine Tailings Inventory from mine operator tailings plans submitted in October 2009, Canadian Natural Resources's (CNRL) mine, Horizon mine had of mature fine tailings (MFT) in their tailings ponds. However COSIA argues that CNRL's Horizon External Tailings Facility (ETF) is a relatively young pond with a configuration that minimizes the \\"Pond Centre (PC) depositional environment\\". It has a \\"side hill\\" facility with a three- sided dyke impounding fluid against the natural ground that rises away from the containment dyke.\\" Regulations and oversight From its establishment in January 2008, until it was disbanded in 2013, the Edmonton, Alberta-based Energy Resources Conservation Board (ERCB)‚Äîan independent, quasi-judicial agency of the Government of Alberta‚Äîregulated Alberta's energy resource industry, which included oils sands tailings ponds. Board members included engineers, geologists, technicians, economists, and other professionals. The ERCB was created to replace the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board (EUB) and the Alberta Utilities Commission. The ERCB's first major publication was the December 2008, Directive 073: Requirements for Inspection and Compliance of Oil Sands Mining and Processing Plant Operations in the Oil Sands Mining Area, which was based Oil Sands Conservation Act (OSCA), Oil Sands Conservation Regulation (OSCR), Informational Letter (IL) 96-07: EUB/AEP Memorandum of Understanding on the Regulation of Oil Sands Development, IL 94-19: Dam Safety Accord, Agreement Between Alberta Employment, Immigration and Industry and the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board Respecting the Coordination of Services for Coal and Oil Sands Mine Projects (EII/EUB MOU), requirements set out in approval conditions for each oil sands mining and processing plant scheme, operator's ERCB-approved S-23 production accounting manual, Interim Directive (ID) 2001-07: Operating Criteria: Resource Recovery Requirements for Oil Sands Mine and Processing Plants, ID 2001-03: Sulphur Recovery Guidelines for the Province of Alberta, and Directive 019: ERCB Compliance Assurance‚ÄîEnforcement. In 2009, the ERCB published an industry wide directive‚ÄîDirective 074‚Äîwhich was the first of its kind. Directive 074 set out the \\"industry-wide requirements for tailings management,\\" requiring \\"operators to commit resources to research, develop, and implement fluid tailings reduction technologies and to commit to tailings management and progressive reclamation as operational priorities that are integrated with mine planning and bitumen production activities.\\" In 2012, the Government of Alberta set up a Tailings Management Framework (TMF) to complement and expand Directive 074's policies to \\"ensure that fluid fine tailings are reclaimed as quickly as possible and that current inventories are reduced.\\" The ECRB report entitled 2012 Tailings Management Assessment Report: Oil Sands Mining Industry, cautioned that oil sands operators failed to convert their tailings ponds into deposits suitable for reclamation in a timely fashion, as proposed in their project applications. \\"The volume of fluid tailings, and the area required to hold fluid tailings, continued to grow, and the reclamation of tailings ponds was further delayed.\\" The Government of Alberta released the 2012 \\"Tailings Management Framework for Mineable Oil Sands\\" as part of Alberta's Progressive Reclamation Strategy for the oil sands to ensure that tailings are reclaimed as quickly as possible. The ERCB's 2013 \\"Tailings Management Framework for Mineable Oil Sands\\" \\"challenged a \\"key plank\\" of the Conservative provincial government, under Premier Alison Redford, who served from October 2011 until her resignation on 23 March 2014. During the tenure of the Redford cabinet, the province was promoting \\"Alberta as a responsible energy producer.\\" The government had pledged that the \\"turbid tailings ponds containing the byproducts of bitumen production will soon be a thing of the past.\\" In April 2013, Premier undertook a trade mission to Washington, D.C. in which she said that, \\"tailings ponds [will] disappear from Alberta's landscape in the very near future.\\" She said that there would be new environmental rules that will force \\"companies who do use mines and tailings\\" to \\"completely halt the growth of fluid tailings ponds by 2016.\\" In 2013, the Alberta government replaced the ERCB with the newly- created Alberta Energy Regulator (AER), with Jim Ellis, as CEO. The AER's mandate included overseeing the \\"development of hydrocarbon resources over their entire life cycle\\", which included \\"allocating and conserving water resources, and managing public lands.\\" The AER was also tasked with \\"protecting the environment while providing economic benefits for all Albertans.\\" In March 2015 in response to the ERCB's \\"Tailings Management Framework for Mineable Oil Sands\\", AER suspended Directive 074: Tailings Performance Criteria and Requirements for Oil Sands Mining Schemes. In May 2016, the Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta (ABQB) in 2016 ABQB 278, \\"confirmed that the federal Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act supersedes the provincial requirements that companies must clean up wells.\\" \\"[B]ankrupt companies can avoid their liabilities and leave them as a public obligation.\\" Directive 85 was issued on 14 July 2016, by the Alberta Energy Regulator, following consultations with \\"consultations with First Nations, local communities, environmental groups and industry itself\\". Directive 85 with new guidelines and a phased-in approach on oil sands producers' management of their tailings ponds. Under Directive 85 \\"fluid tailings\\" must be \\"ready to reclaim\\" within ten years of the closing of an oil sands mine. On 25 April 2017 the Court of Appeal of Alberta (ABCA) dismissed the AER and OWA's appeal in a landmark decision, affirming the May 2016 decision of the Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta in favour of Redwater Energy Corporation's receiver, Grant Thornton Limited, in Redwater's bankruptcy proceedings. The ABCA found that Grant Thornton Limited \\"entitled to disclaim Redwater's non-producing oil wells and sell its producing ones\\". In July 2019, the AER announced their Decision 2019 ABAER 006: Syncrude Canada Ltd. Mildred Lake Extension Project and Mildred Lake Tailings Management Plan, with a 289-page report. Syncrude's had submitted their request regarding the Mineral Surface Lease MSL352 in 30 June 2017. The AER decision allows Syncrude to use more public lands to develop oil sands on oil sands leases 17 and 22, under section 20 of the Public Lands Act, with a number of conditions, related to relevant laws, including the Oil Sands Conservation Act (OSCA), the Environmental Protection and Enhancement Act (EPEA), the Water Act, and the Public Lands Act. The AER found that Syncrude's Mildred Lake Extension (MLX) project was in the \\"public interest.\\" The AER found that Mildred Lake Extension Project (MLX) did not meet Directive 085: Fluid Tailings Management for Oil Sands Mining Projects requirements. Syncrude has until 31 January 2023 to submit an \\"updated Tailings Management Plan\\" that aligns with Tailings Management Framework for the Mineable Oil Sands (TMF). The \\"TMF under the Lower Athabasca Regional Plan (LARP) provides direction to the AER and industry on the management of fluid tailings during and after mine operation. AER Directive 085, under the Oil Sands Conservation Act (OSCA), \\"sets out requirements for managing fluid tailings for oil sands mining projects.\\"The project includes two new open-pit mining operations that would operate with \\"conventional shovel and truck mining technology\\". The Mildred Lake Extension (MLX east), located west of the Athabasca River, and Mildred Lake Extension (MLX west), west of the Mackay River are about 35 kilometres (km) north of Fort McMurray the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo (RMWB) and about 10 km north of the hamlet of Fort McKay. Most of Fort McKay is situated on Fort McKay First Nation (FMFN) lands. These two new mines would extend Syncrude's mining activity using old technologies by about 14 years (AER 2019:2). =AER on cost of clean-up of tailings ponds= In an AER presentation in February 2018, the AER's \\"vice- president of closure and liability\\" said that \\"based on \\"a hypothetical worst- case scenario\\", the cleanup cost would be $260-billion based on \\"internal AER calculations\\". The oil industry's \\"accumulated environmental liability\\" estimate of $58.65 billion was the amount that the AER had publicly reported. Of that cost, \\"tailings ponds make up the largest but unknown portion of this AER estimate\\". On 15 February 2018 the Supreme Court of Canada held a hearing centering on Alberta's lower courts' findings in favour of Redwater Energy's creditors, to determine if Canada's bankruptcy laws are in conflict with Alberta's regulatory regime ‚Äì and if those federal laws are paramount to the province's environmental rules\\". By February, 2018, there were 1,800 abandoned or orphan wells‚Äîsites that had been licensed by AER with combined liabilities of over $110 million. From 2014 to 2018 the industry-led organization's Orphan Well Association's (OWA) inventory, increased from 1,200 to over 3,700. In late February 2018, CBC News and CP reported that Sequoia Resources Ltd, an oil firm that had purchased \\"licences for 2,300 wells\\" in 2016 from Perpetual Energy Inc., had notified AER that it was ceasing operations \\"imminently\\" and were unable to maintain \\"almost 200 facilities and nearly 700 pipeline segments\\". Sequoia Resources Ltd had defaulted on its \\"municipal tax payments\\" and could not reclaim its properties. According to The Star, after Sequoia Resources Ltd filed for bankruptcy protection in March \\"without decommissioning and cleaning up 4,000 wells, pipelines and other facilities\\", as required of all oil companies,\\"Oil companies are required to return the lands they develop to a natural state.\\" On 7 August 2018 PricewaterhouseCoopers, the trustee for Chinese investors who purchased Sequoia Resources Ltd in 2016, launched a lawsuit against Perpetual Energy Inc. in an \\"unprecedented bid to void\\" the 2016 sale of Perpetual Energy Inc.'s subsidiary called Perpetual Energy Operating Corp. (PEOC) now known as Sequoia Resources Ltd to Chinese investors.Perpetual Energy Inc. was created in 2002 as a spin out of Paramount Resources, owned by Clayton Riddell, a Calgary billionaire who died on 15 September 2018. Clayton Riddell remained as Chairman of Perpetual Energy Inc. from its inception in 2002 until Riddell's passing in 2018. Riddell owned 41.7% of Perpetual Energy Inc. and his daughter, Susan Riddell Rose, who is Perpetual's CEO, owns a 4.8%. In August 2018, Perpetual Energy Inc. had a market capitalization of about $40-million. It is alleged in a court filing that in 2016 Susan Riddell Rose \\"engineered the sale of a subsidiary called Perpetual Energy Operating Corp. (PEOC), later renamed Sequoia\\" to Chinese investors. In March 2018 Sequoia filed for bankruptcy protection. An article in The Globe and Mail said that this appears to be the \\"first attempt by a bankruptcy trustee in Alberta to have a previous oil and gas transaction unwound.\\" It could \\"introduce major new risks to the [oil and gas] industry‚Äôs ability to buy and sell assets and could also deliver a severe blow to Perpetual.\\" The lawsuit alleges that Perpetual and its CEO Susan Riddell Rose \\"knew the deal would sink the buyer\\". Perpetual says that \\"the claim is without merit\\". In a public statement released on 8 August 2018, AER CEO Jim Ellis, who had been CEO since AER's creation in 2013, took the \\"unusual step\\" of admitting that the Sequoia \\"situation has exposed a gap in the system\\" that needed to be fixed and \\"raised questions\\" about how to proceed in the future.From 2012 to 2017, the increase in insolvencies has led to an increase in the number of orphan wells to increase from 100 to 3,200. In 2017 there were 450,000 wells registered in Alberta with about 155,000 \\"no longer producing but not yet fully remediated\\". In their 2017 report, the C.D. Howe estimated the cost of clean up of orphan wells was as high as $8 billion. On 1 November 2018 AER CEO Jim Ellis apologized for failing to report \\"that cleaning up after the province's oil and gas industry would cost $260 billion\\". On 2 November he announced his retirement as CE0.  Reduction and reclamation  Suncor invested $1.2 billion in their Tailings Reduction Operations (TROTM) method that treats mature fine tails (MFT) from tailings ponds with chemical flocculant, an anionic Polyacrylamide, commonly used in water treatment plants to improve removal of total organic content (TOC), to speed their drying into more easily reclaimable matter. Mature tailings dredged from a pond bottom in suspension were mixed with a polymer flocculant and spread over a \\"beach\\" with a shallow grade where the tailings would dewater and dry under ambient conditions. The dried MFT can then be reclaimed in situ or moved to another location for final reclamation. Suncor hoped this would reduce the time for water reclamation from tailings to weeks rather than years, with the recovered water being recycled into the oil sands plant. Suncor claimed the mature fines tailings process would reduce the number of tailing ponds and shorten the time to reclaim a tailing pond from 40 years at present to 7‚Äì10 years, with land rehabilitation continuously following 7 to 10 years behind the mining operations. For the reporting periods from 2010 to 2012, Suncor had a lower-than-expected fines capture performance from this technology. Syncrude used the older composite tailings (CT) technology to capture fines at its Mildred Lake project. Syncrude had a lower-than-expected fines capture performance in 2011/2012 but exceeded expectations in 2010/2011. Shell used atmospheric fines drying (AFD) technology combined \\"fluid tailings and flocculants and deposits the mixture in a sloped area to allow the water to drain and the deposit to dry\\" and had a lower-than-expected fines capture performance. = Suncor's Wapisiw Lookout = By 2010 Suncor had transformed their first tailings pond, Pond One, into Wapisiw Lookout, the first reclaimed settling basin in the oil sands. In 2007 the area was a 220-hectare pond of toxic effluent but several years later there was firm land planted with black spruce and trembling aspen. Wapisiw Lookout represents only one percent of tailings ponds in 2011 but Pond One was the first effluent pond in the oil sands industry in 1967 and was used until 1997. By 2011 only 65 square kilometres were cleaned up and about one square kilometre was certified by Alberta as a self-sustaining natural environment. Wapisiw Lookout has not yet been certified. Closure operations of Pond One began in 2007. The jello-like mature fine tails (MFT) were pumped and dredged out of the pond and relocated to another tailings pond for long-term storage and treatment. The MFT was then replaced with 30 million tonnes clean sand and then topsoil that had been removed from the site in the 1960s. The 1.2 million cubic meters of topsoil over the surface, to a depth of 50 centimetres, was placed on top of the sand in the form of hummocks and swales. It was then planted with reclamation plants. = Syncrude's Sandhill Fen project = In 2008 Syncrude Canada Ltd. began construction of Sandhill Fen project, a 57-hectare research watershed- creating a mix of forest and wetland- on top of sand-capped composite tailings at its former 60-metre deep East Mine. = End Pit Lakes = The Pembina Institute suggested that the huge investments by many companies in Canadian oil sands was leading to increased production results in excess bitumen with no place to store it. It added that by 2022 a month's output of waste-water could result in an 11-feet deep toxic reservoir the size of New York City's Central Park [840.01 acres (339.94 ha) (3.399 km¬≤)]. The oil sands industry may build a series of up to thirty lakes by pumping water into old mine pits when they have finished excavation leaving toxic effluent at their bottoms and letting biological processes restore it to health. It is less expensive to fill abandoned open pit mines with water instead of dirt. In 2012 the Cumulative Environmental Management Association (CEMA) described End Pit Lakes (EPL) as CEMA acknowledged that the \\"main concern is the potential for EPLs to develop a legacy of toxicity and thus reduce the land use value of the oil sands region in the future.\\" Syncrude Canada was planning the first end pit lake in 2013 with the intention of \\"pumping fresh water over 40 vertical metres of mine effluent that it has deposited in what it calls 'base mine lake.'\\" David Schindler argued that no further end pit lakes should be approved until we \\"have some assurance that they will eventually support a healthy ecosystem.\\" There is to date no \\"evidence to support their viability, or the 'modelled' results suggesting that outflow from the lakes will be non- toxic.\\"  Research  In March 2012 an alliance of oil companies called Canada‚Äôs Oil Sands Innovation Alliance (COSIA) was launched with a mandate to share research and technology to decrease the negative environmental impact of oil sands production focusing on tailings ponds, greenhouse gases, water and land. Almost all the water used to produce crude oil using steam methods of production ends up in tailings ponds. Recent enhancements to this method include Tailings Oil Recovery (TOR) units which recover oil from the tailings, Diluent Recovery Units to recover naphtha from the froth, Inclined Plate Settlers (IPS) and disc centrifuges. These allow the extraction plants to recover well over 90% of the bitumen in the sand. In January 2013, scientists from Queen's University published a report analyzing lake sediments in the Athabasca region over the past fifty years. They found that levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) had increased as much as 23-fold since bitumen extraction began in the 1960s. Levels of carcinogenic, mutagenic, and teratogenic PAHs were substantially higher than guidelines for lake sedimentation set by the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment in 1999. The team discovered that the contamination spread farther than previously thought. Emissions  According to the 2018 study by Baray et al, ninety-six per cent of methane emissions in the AOSR came from Mildred Lake Settling Basin and the Syncrude Mildred Lake West In-Pit (WIP) pond and Suncor Energy OSG's Ponds 2‚Äì3 (P23). MLSB \\"was found to be responsible for over 70% of tailings ponds emissions of CH4.\\" The study collected data on emission rates of methane (CH4) from the \\"five major facilities in the AOSR: Syncrude Mildred Lake (SML), Suncor Energy OSG (SUN), Canadian Natural Resources Limited Horizon (CNRL), Shell Albian Muskeg River and Jackpine (SAJ) and Syncrude Aurora (SAU).\\" 2018 report published in the Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics journal to be \\"responsible for the majority of tailings ponds emissions of methane.\\"  See also  * Tailings Notes References Further reading    * Category:Bituminous sands Category:Petroleum industry Category:Unconventional oil Category:Dams in Alberta Category:Mining in Alberta Category:Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo Category:Tailings dams Category:Environmental issues in Alberta ","title":"Oil sands tailings ponds (Canada)"},{"id":"44575771","text":"Anil Sinha or Anil Kumar Sinha (born 16 January 1956) is a Bihar Cadre Indian Police Service officer of the 1979 batch and was the Director of the Central Bureau of Investigation till 2 December 2016.

The piece indicates the artist's growing interests in creative nuances which would later formally be realized as part of the Futurist movement. The artist was influenced heavily by northern Italians' use of divisionism and the French's better known pointillism. Created with oil on canvas just on the brink of World War I, the Futurist movement is embodied by a dark optimism for a future of speed, turbulence, chaos, and new beginnings. Most of Giacaomo Balla's pieces allude to the wonder of dynamic movement, and this painting is no exception. The oil painting is currently housed at the Museo del Novecento in Milan. Futurist theory The early Futurist movement began with Filippo Marinetti‚Äôs ‚ÄúFuturist Manifesto‚Äù in 1909 and is followed up by Umberto Boccioni‚Äôs 1910 manifesto, ‚ÄúThe City Rises.‚Äù The manifestos represent the Futurists‚Äô statement of artistic purpose and defined the creative work of its founders and later followers. Balla, among other artists, signed his name at the bottom of the latter manifesto and would later go on to publish his own renditions of the Futurist mission. The Futurists lived in a time of fierce social and political change. The industrial world was unfolding as technology continued to advance. They were quite avant-garde and used materials indicative of a modern age, as exemplified in Boccioni's bronze Unique Forms of Continuity in Space. The Italian dictionary defines futurism as ‚Äúwanting to make a clean slate of the past and traditional forms of expression to make way for the inquisition of dynamic modern life, a mechanical civilization projecting into the future in a riot of senses‚Ä¶.‚Äù The movement is all about literal and figurative movement on both individual and larger, national scales. Physical movement often is used in Futurist art to represent machinery, which in turn represents technology and ultimately our progress and movement as a civilization into the future. The Futurists were a very extreme bunch; not one of them was over the age of thirty and they considered war the world's own hygiene. They opposed ideas of morality and feminism, and saw great promise in speed. Their world was hurtling into the future, and there was time only to depict only the truly beautiful. In 1909, they wrote, ‚ÄúBeauty exists only in struggle. There is no masterpiece that has not an aggressive character. Poetry must be a violent assault on the forces of the unknown, to force them to bow before man.‚Äù The Futuristic style borrows from other forward thinking movements: Post- Impressionism, Symbolism, Divisionism, Cubism and Pointillism. Painting analysis Young Girl Running on Balcony mainly addresses dynamism, the phenomenon Futurists devoted their lives to illustrating. Merriam-Webster defines it as the ‚Äútheory that all phenomena (as matter or motion) can be explained as manifestations of force.\\" The Futurists believed that everything is made of dynamic forces, and that everything is in constant motion. This idea is best noted in the girl's repeated form across the canvas, which works to represent her actual movement through space. The lines are not very definitive between each form; in fact, there aren't many lines at all. The piece emulates an unusual sort of micro-cubist style. Balla also calls upon the techniques of both French Pointillism and Italian Divisionism. Pointillist painters utilize tiny points, which they dot on the canvas to create an image. Georges Seurat demonstrated the technique most famously in his piece, A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte. Conversely, the Divisionists, based in the north of Italy, used long brush strokes, more rectangular in shape than the Pointillists‚Äô dots, and painted them next to strokes of contrasting color to create texture and depth in an image. Giovanni Segantini was famous for his pastoral representations of life in the Alps; his 1893 Afternoon in the Alps exemplifies his mastery of the Divisionist style. Balla emulates both these artists in Young Girl Running on Balcony by using tiny squares to create a mosaic effect. The many squares further break down the image of the girl herself and force the viewer to focus not on her form, but on her fragmented motion through time and space. Her movement, blurred lines between each step, is not exactly disjointed nor is it really fluid, but it is definitely continuous. =Color palette= The painting's color palette is also typical of the Futurist palette. Balla chose ultra bright colors, a hallmark of the style which Boccioni explains in \\"Futurist Painting: Technical Manifesto\\": > Your eyes, accustomed to semi-darkness, will soon open to more radiant > visions of light. The shadows which we shall paint shall be more luminous > than the highlights of our predecessors, and our pictures, next to those of > the museums, will shine like blinding daylight compared with deepest night. Not only do the pigments nearly shine, they do not mix with each other. This continues to abstract the painting and lets the viewer focus on the movement and organized chaos of the piece rather than focusing on unnecessary details you might find in another piece, like the girl's facial features or hair color. That is not to say that the artist does not include detail; he simply does not take advantage of it and does not directly draw the viewer's attention to little things, like the girl's swishing braid. The painting has no central point on which the eye focuses; instead the eye travels across the canvas. The running scene appears to continue beyond the frame's surface, attesting to the girl's dynamic energy and momentum in the piece.

She worked on season two of BBC One fantasy-adventure series Merlin, before moving on to Primeval in 2010, where she script-edited seasons four and five of the sci-fi series and wrote all five episodes of the Primeval web-series that introduced season four. Dollard wrote the fifth episode of the fifth season of Toby Whithouse's popular BBC Three series Being Human, featuring guest star Kathryn Prescott, of Skins fame. Digital Spy called the episode, titled No Care, All Responsibility, \\"the latest in a string of knockout episodes ‚Äì sweet and chilling in equal measure\\". Dollard also penned the webisodes that accompanied Being Human season five, focusing on the character of Alex Millar, played by Kate Bracken. She wrote episode three of BBC spy thriller The Game, and co- wrote episode five with series creator Toby Whithouse. =Cara Fi and beyond= Dollard created and wrote her own rom-com series Cara Fi (Love Me) with Touchpaper Television, for the Welsh broadcaster S4C. The eight episode series focuses on a sleepy seaside village in Wales that runs out of women, so the locals advertise their single men on the side of milk cartons leaving the dairy. Each episode focuses on a new woman arriving in the village to be set up with a local man. The show debuted in November 2014 on S4C, and was subsequently on the BBC iPlayer. In 2015, she wrote the tenth episode of the ninth series of Doctor Who, titled \\"Face the Raven\\",. She also wrote an episode of the UK-US co-produced comedy-drama You, Me and the Apocalypse, and ITV period drama The Halcyon. She returned to write the episode \\"Thin Ice\\" for Series 10 of Doctor Who. In December 2016 it was announced that Dollard would adapt YA novel \\"Cuckoo Song\\" for television. Written by Frances Hardinge, the novel was \\"the first YA book to win the British Fantasy Awards' top prize and was shortlisted for both the Carnegie Medal and the James Herbert Award\\". In 2018, she wrote the seventh episode for A Discovery of Witches, a television series based on the novel trilogy of the same name by Deborah Harkness. In October 2018 it was announced that the show would be renewed for a 2nd and 3rd season with Dollard as one of the main script writers.

Her work is an example of outsider art and vernacular architecture. Mollie Nelson was born in 1890, the daughter of a Norwegian farmer. She inherited her father's farm near River Falls, and lived there until 1959. She married Obert Jenson in 1911, and was the mother of six children. Her early artwork consisted of traditional craft items, including hooked rugs, quilts, paintings, horn furniture, and wood carvings. Jenson completed her first outdoor sculpture, the ten-foot tall Dutch Windmill, in 1940. The Windmill was constructed of concrete embellished with tile mosaics, topped with electric lights and a blackface lawn jockey. Jenson‚Äôs 1941 Fireplace began as an outdoor hearth made of concrete, limestone, and ceramic pieces. Through continual additions, she expanded the structure into a cavern-like, elaborately decorated covered patio. Her last large-scale work was the Horseshoe, a diorama inspired by the Patriotism Shrine at nearby Dickeyville Grotto. The Horseshoe consisted of a semi-circular stone wall, decorated with curving concrete spires and deer antlers. From 1938 to 1959, Jenson also operated a roadside zoo featuring 150 animals, including monkeys, peacocks, a lion, and a retired circus bear. Following Jenson‚Äôs death, family members concerned with the safety of the structures demolished all but the Dutch Windmill.

After almost 60 years of negotiations on the demarcation of the Venezuelan‚ÄìColombian border (1881‚Äì1938), the treaty of 1941 put an end to this long process.

The exchange of ratifications of this agreement was made in Caracas, on September 12, 1941. The land border between Colombia and Venezuela is a conflict zone of perennial tension between the two countries, due to problems such as Illegal drug trade, smuggling or illegal trade, the presence of high-risk diseases that often spread on both sides of the boundary lines, and the presence of the Colombian guerrillas.

AFI was created by the Assets for Independence Act. In order to strengthen communities and individuals, AFI uses several tools including financial education and grants supporting Individual Development Accounts (IDAs), also known as matched savings accounts.  Purpose and history  First introduced in 1991, the Assets for Independence Act (AFIA) worked its way through several sessions of Congress, finally passing in 1998. The 105th Congress appropriated $105 million to fund IDAs over the course of 5 years. AFI is the \\"largest federal funder of IDA programs\\" awarding grants to more than 400 non-profits and government programs. More than 84,000 families received some sort of assistance from AFI through the IDA and financial education programs. Over 40% of these families have been able to \\"join the economic mainstream\\" through the purchase of assets.Administration for Children and Families. 2014. \\"About Assets for Independence.\\" Office of Community Services.

Accessed Nov 4, 2014. With this money, organizations fund individual development accounts (IDAs) that may help eligible participants obtain the desired assets in the future. Money from these savings accounts can only be used for the three specific assets mentioned earlier, i.e. homeownership, business ownership, and post-secondary education. Besides awarding grants for IDAs, the program also manages a national resource center with the intent of helping AFI grantees better understand IDAs and other asset-building strategies.Administration for Children and Families. 2014. \\"About Assets for Independence.\\" Office of Community Services. Accessed November 4, 2014. AFI is currently administered through the Office of Community Services (OCS) and part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HSS). As stated in its mission, AFI works to help low-income families transition into economic self- sufficiency. In a special partnership between OCS and the Administration for Native Americans (ANA), AFI helps support the building of assets in native communities through the Native Asset Building Initiative (NABI).  Stakeholders  In order to meet their goals and purposes, AFI collaborates with a large variety of organizations that range from government departments to local charities. Several groups are described below. Before noting specific groups AFI works with, it is important to take into account that each organization has specific goals, but they relate to AFI's overall goals and purposes. Although these are not all the organizations and programs that collaborate with AFI, a large variety of programs is apparent. The groups we will mention in the following section are the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the IRS, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, and non-profit groups. The Office of Refugee Resettlement, like AFI, is part of the Department of Health and Human Services. Refugee Resettlement focuses on policies, programs, and initiatives to aid refugees within the country. Consequently, AFI uses the Office of Refugee Resettlement as a resource for grantees. The IRS acts as another resource for AFI. One of AFI's main goals is to help individuals and groups to effectively save, and one way AFI is able to accomplish this goal is with the help of an IRS program called the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) program. AFI uses this program, in collaboration with the IRS, to train organizations that receive grants.Assets for Independence. 2009. \\"Linking Asset Building to Public Benefits and Work Supports.\\" Assets for Independence Resource Center. Accessed October 15, 2014. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, like many of the AFI grantees, works on development projects.Jackson, Marquan, and Russ Olwell. 2014. \\"Assets for Independence and Subsidized Housing: Partners with A Common Goal.\\" CFED Expanding Economic Opportunity. Accessed October 15, 2014. Consequently, the Department of Housing also acts as a useful resource and aid for AFI and their grantees. The specific projects that both AFI and the Department of Housing have in common deal with development in poorer areas in the country, and both AFI and the Department of Housing reach out to a common group of people, and in several situations they have had to collaborate on the same projects. Non- profits and Grantees are the bulk of AFI's organizational relations. Although grantees may not seem like partners, many of the organizations receiving funds from AFI have been recipients for years. Because AFI provides grants to a large number of organizations in nearly all 50 states, it is not necessary to list all of them. However, the organizations mostly lie within the following groups: state universities, development councils, community shelters, child- support services, Native American Nations, Community Action, the United Way and local non-profits.Assets for Independence. 2013. \\"Assets for Independence Grant Awards in 2013.\\" Assets for Independence Resource Center. Accessed Nov 1, 2014.  Organizational structure  With a basic understanding of AFI and its purpose, goals and partners, we can better understand the organization's inner structure and potential problems. In this next section of the brief, we will discuss the organizational structure‚Äîthe grant process and the internal makeup‚Äîas well as the budget, and finally different problems AFI has. In this section of our brief, we will discuss the organizational structure. There are two parts to the organizational structure. These two parts are the internal organization, and the grant process. = Internal organization = AFI is a federal program headed by the Office of Community Services, within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Administration for Children and Families. The Program Manager of AFI works in collaboration with Grant Management offices that are located near project locations. When a certain grant is given to an individual group, the grant management offices work as the middleman between AFI headquarters and the group in question. AFI is a program within the structure of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Each year, Congress earmarks funds for AFI within the budget of HHS. Although AFI receives funds through the HHS, AFI s essentially run by the Office of Grant Management (OGM) and the Office of Community Services (OCS). These two offices work together to distribute the funds to grantees around the United States. OCS approves grantees to receive funding contingent upon their ability to match funds. Grantees partner with a Qualified Financial Institution (QFI)‚Äîa bank or a credit union‚Äîand they subsequently, with their bank or credit union, find qualified individuals to set up Individual Development Accounts (IDA) Once money is approved and an individual deposits money in an IDA, the HHS Division of Payment Management (DPM) disburses the money.Administration for Children and Families. 2014. \\"About Assets for Independence.\\" Office of Community Services. Accessed November 4, 2014. As the OCS approves and funds grantees, the OGM is responsible for holding grantees accountable to AFI's goal and general oversight. This office also evaluates the effectiveness of the grants, as well as other offices. = Grantees = After understanding AFI's internal organization and its grant process, we can now describe the organizations and groups that receive AFI grants. The groups that are included within the 501c3 status include the following: not-for- profit organizations; state or local governments; tribal governments; low- income credit unions; community development financial institutions; and any organizations that can demonstrate a relationship with a community-based organization addressing poverty.Internal Revenue Service. 2014. \\"Exemption Requirements - 501(c)(3) Organizations.\\" Internal Revenue Service.

Table 3.1 illustrated below is a description of what the grant offers, who can apply, how many times an organization can apply and how grant monies are released. * Who can apply? Grant applicants must have a 501c3 status. * How many times can organizations apply? There is no limit on how many times an organization may apply for grants. * How is grant money released? Funds are only released as matching funds are produced (information below). The following is an example of the grant-giving process to a nonprofit. An organization that receives a $20,000 grant from AFI, but only has $5,000 of matching funds initially will receive $5,000 from the AFI grant and the rest of the $20,000 as more funds are raised. Additionally, organizations must use the entirety of the grant before a set deadline, otherwise the funds are returned to AFI. To qualify, the above organizations must be able to contribute funds at least equal to the grant given by the federal government. The grantees find and distribute the funds to qualifying individuals. The grant from the federal government will not contribute more than $2,000 to any individual. Each dollar invested by the individual is matched with $1 to $8 (the average is between $2 and $3).  Budget  = What AFI receives = While the internal process of AFI is important to understand, it is equally important to understand the role the budget plays. As with any program or organization, budget plays a key role in the internal process of AFI. In this section, we will describe the average budget for AFI, as well as the average amount AFI awarded in grants. AFI receives its funds through the Office of Grant Management. After Congress passes the budget, HSS (Health and Human Services) administers the budget through the Administration for Children and Family's Office of Community Services. With the funds funneling down from HSS, AFI has received an average of $20,123,400.Administration for Children and Families. 2014. \\"About Assets for Independence.\\" Office of Community Services. Accessed November 4, 2014. Although the change has not been drastic, since 2008, AFI funding has fallen approximately 5 percent, and has been at a slow incline since then as is evident in Figure 4.1. In response, AFI has not only spent less, but has spent a larger percentage of the funding designated to the program. = What AFI gives = The budget essentially can give an idea of the ability AFI has to meet its program goals. On average, AFI spends $22,144,890 per year, and typically, AFI splits its budget between the following: grants, research and evaluation, program development, program support, and technical assistance.Administration for Children and Families. 2014. \\"About Assets for Independence.\\" Office of Community Services. Accessed November 4, 2014. The largest allocation of funds goes to grantees. Using these funds, AFI awards an average of 44 grants each year to programs across the United States. As mentioned before, these grants are matching grants, at a minimum of $20,000 each.  Problems  AFI faces four main problems: (1) lack of funding, (2) program inefficiencies, (3) poor publicity, and (4) inefficient long-term behavior. = Funding = Congress underfunds AFI each year because there are other programs that have priority, and are larger in size. Congressional oversights are caused because of heavy emphasis on other programs, and consequently, AFI has been scraping by on annual appropriations, which have been slashed by 40 percent in recent years.Levin, Era. 2014. \\"Help Families Escape Financial Insecurity: Reauthorize Assets for Independence.\\" Corporation for Enterprise Development. February 06. Accessed Nov 1, 2014. Funding is further hindered by legislated rules; these rules prohibit grants of more than $1 million to any single organization and stops federal matching of IDAs at $2000 total.United States Congress. 2012. \\"AFI Legislation: Assets for Independence Act 42 USC 604.\\" Office of Community Service. May 30. Accessed November 1, 2014. Because there are several groups that regularly receive grants from AFI, this limits the help AFI can give to organizations that are successful in dispersing funds. This also makes the process of applying and rewarding grants more expensive because it has to be done over and over again. = Inefficiency = The grant process is the main inefficiency within AFI. An application must navigate through several organizations before accomplishing anything, and the various stages are costly. The wages of extraneous workers are expended in order to guide a potential applicant. Essentially, this blocks potential grantees from receiving money and brings in extra costs to the program. The process of applying, and receiving grants can be improved by reducing administrative costs, clarifying specific sponsor organization and defining the grant process from congressional appropriation to an individual IDA. = Publicity = The third problem AFI faces is a lack of publicity; because a large portion of AFI's funds goes to other needs within the program, there is no focus on publicity. More people who would qualify need to apply and utilize this great asset; however, publicity is expensive, and recruiting is costly with this program's already strapped budget. An innovative solution to this problem is to partner with existing organizations. Jackson and Orwell suggest that partnering with subsidized housing programs would lead AFI to the applicants it needs.Jackson, Marquan, and Russ Olwell. 2014. \\"Assets for Independence and Subsidized Housing: Partners with A Common Goal.\\" CFED Expanding Economic Opportunity. Accessed October 15, 2014. The AFI website gives an example of integrating microenterprise development programs with AFI grantees to give applicants a more holistic approach. AFI has many avenues it can choose in order to connect with participants. Rather than running an expensive advertising campaign, which it can't afford, an innovative partnering strategy is an attractive answer to publicity. = Doesn't meet all needs of the poor = Another difficulty for AFI is the long-term needs of its participants. Although basic financial skills courses are mandatory for those involved, and AFI does succeed in helping many save for specific assets, many participants withdraw funds for short-term needs. For example, 64 percent of IDA holders made an unmatched withdrawal.Boshara, Ray. 2005. \\"Welfare Reform and Beyond.\\" The Brookings Institution. March.

All modern Clavigeritae are morphologically specialized obligate colony parasites of ant nests, soliciting food via trophallaxis from worker ants, and preying on the nest brood. The amber-embedded holotype specimen of the single species, Protoclaviger trichodens, was recovered from a piece of 52 million-year-old Cambay amber from Gujarat, India. P. trichodens differs to modern Clavigeritae in its possession of a segmented dorsal abdomen; in extant species, the abdominal tergites are fused into single large segment. P. trichodens also possesses 8 antennal segments and mouthparts that extend outside the oral cavity, whereas modern species have between 3 and 6 antennal segments, and mouthparts that are contained within the oral cavity. Protoclaviger is believed to represent an intermediate stage in the evolution of morphological specialization that adapted modern Clavigeritae to life inside ant colonies. Its discovery in Cambay amber, which holds one of the earliest diverse assemblages of modern ant subfamilies, indicates that the ant-beetle symbiosis is evolutionarily ancient.

At that time, Muntu was a 12-piece band, composed mostly of students of Cecil Taylor who played in his Black Music Ensemble. For a short time, Muntu was a quintet co-led by Moondoc and trumpeter Arthur Williams. In the summer of 1973, Moondoc and pianist Mark Hennen, who had also studied with Taylor at Antioch, left Yellow Springs and headed for New York City. In the beginning of the Loft Jazz period, they reconnected with Williams and asked bassist William Parker and drummer Rashied Sinan to join the band. With this lineup, Muntu made its first performance in NYC in December 1973 at Sam Rivers' Studio Rivbea.

Career Aldrich received his Bachelor's and Doctorate degrees in Botany under C. J. Alexopoulos at the University of Texas. He received his doctorate in 1966 and the same year, was hired as a tenure track professor by the University of Florida in the department of Botany (1966‚Äì1976) and later moved to the Department of Microbiology and Cell Sciences (1976‚Äì2005). His initial research areas focused on Myxomycetes (true plasmodial slime mold) and viruses. As of 2005, Aldrich was listed as Professor Emeritus with broad research areas including ‚ÄúUltrastructure of bacteria, fungi and in plants‚Äù by University of Florida website. Aldrich has about 120 publications to his name. (Blackwell, 2007). =From taxonomy to biochemistry= His dissertation research focused on slime mold life stages using Transmission electron microscopy. He became a pioneer in using Electron Microscope, imaging with colorful micrographs and used his expertise to trouble shoot and help any microscopic related issues for graduate students and his colleagues. He was equally appreciated and accredited by them in their publications. Aldrich research highlights include Synaptonemal complexes of prophase I occurring in meiosis takes place after spore cleavage rather than before in three species of Myxomycete (Aldrich, 1967). Biology of Myxomycetes includes organization of myxamoeba and its development into plasmodium (Aldrich 1969). Aldrich et al., 2005 was first group to demonstrate a myxomycete Physarum pusillum sporulation on the body of lizard Corytophanes cristatu. In another study Aldrich group elucidated Ultrastructure of insitu anaerobic digester biofilms consisting of methogenic bacteria using scanning and transmission electron microscopy (Robison et al., 1984). Aldrich group was first to report a psychrophilic methogen Methonogenium frigidum sp.nov growing by CO2 reduction (Franzman et al., 1997). Sequencing of Propanediol utilization operon provided insight into identification of 16 hypothetical genes (Bobik et al., 1999). Aldrich emphasized more on use of cutting edge techniques and made enhancements to be cost effective. To benefit the researchers he along with Todd W.J. (1986) compiled a book titled ‚ÄúUltrastructure techniques for Microorganisms‚Äù which elucidates modern techniques like freeze facture, X-ray microanalysis and electron microscopy. Memberships Aldrich was a member of Mycologist Society of America. He served as Easter Councilor (1971‚Äì1973); Vice president (1982‚Äì1983) and President (1984‚Äì1985). He was well appreciated for his role in formation of IMC2 Corporation INC in 1977. Aldrich was also a member of American Society of Microbiology Southeastern Branch. He was President of Southeastern branch of ASM (1986‚Äì1987) and Secretary&Treasure; (1995‚Äì1996). In 2005, ASM Southeastern branch of ASM honored Aldrich by installing Henry Aldrich Student Research Grants for undergraduate and graduate students (Blackwell, 2007). Personal life =Family= Aldrich was married to Dr. Sylvia Coleman. He has two sons Clay Chapman Aldrich (California) and John Clark Aldrich (Virginia) from his earlier marriage with Valerie Aldrich and three grandsons (Blackwell, 2007). Coleman was a Microbiologist at VA hospital in Gainesville and an Adjunct Microbiology Professor at the University of Florida (Minter, 2003). She died on June 25, 2009 (Legacy, 2009).

They are found in most of the Americas, including the West Indies, and are most diverse in South America. There are more than 700 species. Dipsadinae are an ecologically and morphologically diverse group of mostly small to moderate-sized snakes (typically less than in total length). Some are arboreal, but others are aquatic or terrestrial and may even burrow. Most are oviparous. Many eat frogs or lizards, and some consume mammals and birds. Several genera (e.g. Adelphicos, Atractus, Geophis, Dipsas, Ninia, Sibon, Sibynomorphus, Tropidodipsas) are specialized feeders on gooey and slimy prey, such as frog eggs, earthworms, snails, and slugs.http://faculty.weber.edu/rmeyers/lip-curling.pdf Almost all species are completely harmless to humans, although a few genera (e.g. Borikenophis, Cubophis, Heterodon, Hydrodynastes, Philodryas) have inflicted painful bites with local, non-life-threatening symptoms. Synonymy Some authors refer to part or all of this group as Xenodontinae, but if the two names are used synonymously, Dipsadinae is the correct name because it is older. When Xenodontinae is used non-synonymously, it normally refers to the larger and more derived South American-Caribbean subclade containing the genus Xenodon and its relatives, whereas Dipsadinae sensu stricto is restricted to the smaller and more basal Central American subclade containing the genus Dipsas and its relatives. Also, a third North American group (sometimes called \\"Carphophiinae\\") contains nine species in five genera at the base of the Dipsadinae (the \\"North American relicts\\" thought to have descended from the ancestors of dipsadines as they crossed from Asia to South America by way of North America; genera Heterodon, Farancia, Diadophis, Carphophis, and Contia).  Genera  Within the Dipsadinae, the three major groups/clades or subfamilies are the Central American group (\\"Dipsadinae\\" sensu stricto), the South American + Caribbean group (\\"Xenodontinae\\"), and a small North American group (sometimes called the \\"Carphophiinae\\" or, incorrectly, \\"Heterodontinae\\"). In addition, a number of snake genera are likely to be dipsadines based on their morphology and geographic range, but because of the absence of genetic data and information about their closest relatives, they are considered genera incertae sedis and are not currently placed in a subgroup of the Dipsadinae. = Central American clade (\\"Dipsadinae\\" sensu stricto) = = South American + Caribbean clade (\\"Xenodontinae\\") = = North American clade (\\"Carphophiinae\\") = = Genera incertae sedis = Notes  References  Category:Dipsadidae Category:Reptile families ","title":"Dipsadinae"},{"id":"44577400","text":"Spirembolus is a genus of North American sheet weavers that was first described by Ralph Vary Chamberlin in 1920.

The novel is closely based on the true story of Manjiro Nakahama (1827‚Äì1898) and is illustrated by his drawings, with jacket illustration by Jillian Tamaki. Heart of a Samurai has received numerous awards and honors, Preus, Margi. Heart of a Samurai. New York: Amulet Books, 2010. Print including being named as a Newbery Medal Honor Book in 2011. Plot Heart of a Samurai is based on the real story of a Japanese boy, who is believed to have been one of the first Japanese people to land in America. In 1841, Manjiro Nakahama, a young fisherman at the age of fourteen, lived in a remote, poor fishing village in Japan. He dreamed of being a Samurai, a royal title bequeathed solely by inheritance. The fishing ship he worked on encountered a storm and ended up drifting out to the sea until it landed on an island which he and the crew named \\"Bird Island\\". After months staying on the island, Manjiro and his crew were rescued by Captain Whitfield, aboard the John Howland, an America whaling ship. Manjiro worked with the whale team and quickly gained Captain Whitfield's admiration. By the time they reached Hawaii, the duo had developed a special relationship. Captain Whitfield wanted to adopt Manjiro and go back to America with him. In spite of the Japanese empire having portrayed foreigners as evil and barbarians, Manjiro was determined to see a new world through his adventure by stepping out of his comfort zone and leaving his crew members behind. Upon landing in America, Manjiro found the majority of Americans he encountered had shown kindness toward him, however, some others discriminated against him as a foreigner. He worked hard at school and took care of his new family while Captain Whitfield was at sea. Finally, after a few years a chance to go home appeared, he quickly jumped on it. On his return to Japan, he was imprisoned for being a ‚Äúspy‚Äù of a foreign country. Japan had isolated itself from the world for more than two hundred years by then. As the Japanese dynasty changed, the new emperor admired Manjiro's knowledge of the world and of the English language and made him become the teacher for his children. Eventually, Manjiro taught English, Maths, sea navigation, and shipbuilding; he wrote and translated English books into Japanese. Gradually, he initiated the whaling industry to Japan and became an interpreter of the first Japanese Embassy. Manjiro's influence on the political powers eventually led to the end of Japan's isolationism in 1854. Manjiro, in a rare honor, was awarded the title of Samurai, despite having been born a fisherman. Characters *Nakahama, Manjiro aka John Mung-- Manjiro is a humble and innocent character. His curiosity and open mindedness brought him to a ten years' adventure in America. His eagerness to learn and forward thinking led him to successfully claim his unlikely dream of being a Samurai. *Denzo, Goemon, Jusuke, and Toraemon ‚Äì Manjiro's crew members of the shipwrecked Japanese fishing ship. *Captain Whitfield-- Captain Whitfield is in charge of the John Howland, a whaling ship. He is a pious, religious person and an honorable figure. He provided the best possible aids for Manjiro to attain education and later learn a trade to be independent financially. *Jolly--Jolly was a Harpooner of John Howland before Captain Whitfield dismissed him due to his dishonesty. He discriminated against Manjiro and abused him verbally and physically. *Tom-- Tom is Manjiro's classmate in the Bedford School of Navigation. He bullied Manjiro from the first day of school. Tom portrays Manjiro as a spy and warns other students that being friends with him is anti-American. *Job--Job is Manjiro's friend after he realized that Tom was being really rude to Manjiro, and has a lot of fun, and helps Manjiro name his horse. *Terry--Terry is a great friend of Manjiro, and goes anywhere with him.

This is closely related to probably approximately correct (PAC) learning, where the learner is evaluated on its predictive power of a test set. Occam learnability implies PAC learning, and for a wide variety of concept classes, the converse is also true: PAC learnability implies Occam learnability. Introduction Occam Learning is named after Occam's razor, which is a principle stating that, given all other things being equal, a shorter explanation for observed data should be favored over a lengthier explanation. The theory of Occam learning is a formal and mathematical justification for this principle. It was first shown by Blumer, et al. that Occam learning implies PAC learning, which is the standard model of learning in computational learning theory. In other words, parsimony (of the output hypothesis) implies predictive power. Definition of Occam learning The succinctness of a concept c in concept class \\\\mathcal{C} can be expressed by the length size(c) of the shortest bit string that can represent c in \\\\mathcal{C}. Occam learning connects the succinctness of a learning algorithm's output to its predictive power on unseen data. Let \\\\mathcal{C} and \\\\mathcal{H} be concept classes containing target concepts and hypotheses respectively. Then, for constants \\\\alpha \\\\ge 0 and 0 \\\\le \\\\beta <1, a learning algorithm L is an (\\\\alpha,\\\\beta)-Occam algorithm for \\\\mathcal{C} using \\\\mathcal{H} iff, given a set S = \\\\\\\\{ x_1, \\\\dots, x_m \\\\\\\\} of m samples labeled according to a concept c \\\\in \\\\mathcal{C}, L outputs a hypothesis h \\\\in \\\\mathcal{H} such that * h is consistent with c on S (that is, h(x)=c(x),\\\\forall x \\\\in S ), and * size(h) \\\\le (n \\\\cdot size(c))^\\\\alpha m^\\\\beta Kearns, M. J., & Vazirani, U. V. (1994). An introduction to computational learning theory, chapter 2. MIT press.Blumer, A., Ehrenfeucht, A., Haussler, D., & Warmuth, M. K. (1987). Occam's razor. Information processing letters, 24(6), 377-380. where n is the maximum length of any sample x \\\\in S. An Occam algorithm is called efficient if it runs in time polynomial in n, m, and size(c). We say a concept class \\\\mathcal{C} is Occam learnable with respect to a hypothesis class \\\\mathcal{H} if there exists an efficient Occam algorithm for \\\\mathcal{C} using \\\\mathcal{H}. The relation between Occam and PAC learning Occam learnability implies PAC learnability, as the following theorem of Blumer, et al. shows: = Theorem (Occam learning implies PAC learning) = > Let L be an efficient (\\\\alpha,\\\\beta)-Occam algorithm for \\\\mathcal{C} using > \\\\mathcal{H}. Then there exists a constant a > 0 such that for any 0 < > \\\\epsilon, \\\\delta < 1, for any distribution \\\\mathcal{D} , given m \\\\ge a > \\\\left( \\\\frac 1 \\\\epsilon \\\\log \\\\frac 1 \\\\delta + \\\\left(\\\\frac {(n \\\\cdot > size(c))^\\\\alpha)} \\\\epsilon \\\\right)^{\\\\frac 1 {1-\\\\beta}}\\\\right) samples drawn > from \\\\mathcal{D} and labelled according to a concept c \\\\in \\\\mathcal{C} of > length n bits each, the algorithm L will output a hypothesis h \\\\in > \\\\mathcal{H} such that error(h)\\\\le \\\\epsilon with probability at least > 1-\\\\delta . Here, error(h) is with respect to the concept c and distribution \\\\mathcal{D} . This implies that the algorithm L is also a PAC learner for the concept class \\\\mathcal{C} using hypothesis class \\\\mathcal{H}. A slightly more general formulation is as follows: = Theorem (Occam learning implies PAC learning, cardinality version) = > Let 0 < \\\\epsilon, \\\\delta < 1. Let L be an algorithm such that, given m > samples drawn from a fixed but unknown distribution \\\\mathcal{D} and labeled > according to a concept c \\\\in \\\\mathcal{C} of length n bits each, outputs a > hypothesis h \\\\in \\\\mathcal{H}_{n,m} that is consistent with the labeled > samples. Then, there exists a constant b such that if \\\\log > \\\\mathcal{H}_{n,m} \\\\leq b \\\\epsilon m - \\\\log \\\\frac{1}{\\\\delta}, then L is > guaranteed to output a hypothesis h \\\\in \\\\mathcal{H}_{n,m} such that > error(h)\\\\le \\\\epsilon with probability at least 1-\\\\delta. While the above theorems show that Occam learning is sufficient for PAC learning, it doesn't say anything about necessity. Board and Pitt show that, for a wide variety of concept classes, Occam learning is in fact necessary for PAC learning.Board, R., & Pitt, L. (1990, April). On the necessity of Occam algorithms. In Proceedings of the twenty-second annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing (pp. 54-63). ACM. They proved that for any concept class that is polynomially closed under exception lists, PAC learnability implies the existence of an Occam algorithm for that concept class. Concept classes that are polynomially closed under exception lists include Boolean formulas, circuits, deterministic finite automata, decision-lists, decision-trees, and other geometrically-defined concept classes. A concept class \\\\mathcal{C} is polynomially closed under exception lists if there exists a polynomial-time algorithm A such that, when given the representation of a concept c \\\\in \\\\mathcal{C} and a finite list E of exceptions, outputs a representation of a concept c' \\\\in \\\\mathcal{C} such that the concepts c and c' agree except on the set E. Proof that Occam learning implies PAC learning We first prove the Cardinality version. Call a hypothesis h\\\\in \\\\mathcal{H} bad if error(h) \\\\geq \\\\epsilon, where again error(h) is with respect to the true concept c and the underlying distribution \\\\mathcal{D}. The probability that a set of samples S is consistent with h is at most (1 - \\\\epsilon)^m, by the independence of the samples. By the union bound, the probability that there exists a bad hypothesis in \\\\mathcal{H}_{n,m} is at most  \\\\mathcal{H}_{n,m}  (1 - \\\\epsilon)^m, which is less than \\\\delta if \\\\log  \\\\mathcal{H}_{n,m}  \\\\leq O(\\\\epsilon m) - \\\\log \\\\frac{1}{\\\\delta}. This concludes the proof of the second theorem above. Using the second theorem, we can prove the first theorem. Since we have a (\\\\alpha,\\\\beta)-Occam algorithm, this means that any hypothesis output by L can be represented by at most (n \\\\cdot size(c))^\\\\alpha m^\\\\beta bits, and thus \\\\log \\\\mathcal{H}_{n,m} \\\\leq (n \\\\cdot size(c))^\\\\alpha m^\\\\beta. This is less than O(\\\\epsilon m) - \\\\log \\\\frac{1}{\\\\delta} if we set m \\\\geq a \\\\left( \\\\frac 1 \\\\epsilon \\\\log \\\\frac 1 \\\\delta + \\\\left(\\\\frac {(n \\\\cdot size(c))^\\\\alpha)} \\\\epsilon \\\\right)^{\\\\frac 1 {1-\\\\beta}}\\\\right) for some constant a > 0. Thus, by the Cardinality version Theorem, L will output a consistent hypothesis h with probability at least 1 - \\\\delta. This concludes the proof of the first theorem above. Improving sample complexity for common problems Though Occam and PAC learnability are equivalent, the Occam framework can be used to produce tighter bounds on the sample complexity of classical problems including conjunctions, conjunctions with few relevant variables,Haussler, D.

In 1882, he had his first exhibition at the \\"Imperial Liceu de Artes e Of√≠cios\\" in Rio de Janeiro and had great success with some canvases he had painted while still living in Germany. This resulted in a commission to decorate the Hall of Fame at the Academy of Portuguese Literature, which he did together with Grimm. The following year, he created stained glass windows for the church of Saint Francis of Paola. In 1884, he entered the \\"Exposi√ß√£o Geral de Belas Artes\\" held by the Academia Imperial de Belas Artes and won a Gold Medal. Apparition of the Virgin Mary (1909) That same year, he joined Grimm and a group of his students, including Ant√¥nio Parreiras, Giovanni Battista Castagneto, Domingo Garc√≠a y V√°squez and Hip√≥lito Boaventura Caron, who left the Academy and formed what became known as the \\"Grupo Grimm\\" in Niter√≥i. He remained there as Grimm's assistant until 1886. Two years later, he became a naturalized citizen of Brazil. Among the many commissions he executed over the following decade may be mentioned the theater curtains at the Teatro Santa Teresa (now the Teatro Jo√£o Caetano), the altar at the Church of the Immaculate Conception in Botafogo and restorative work at the Church of Saint Francis the Penitent. After the turn of the century, he devoted himself almost entirely to architectural projects, including public works, such as the ferry terminals at Guanabara Bay, and private works for Cust√≥dio Jos√© de Melo and Giuseppe Martinelli.

Monument to Anatole Le Braz at the Lyc√©e de St-Brieuc Renaud created a commemorative column featuring sculptures of four people who represented the principal themes of Le Braz' writing, these interspersed by bas-reliefs of Celtic crosses and the coat of arms of Saint-Brieuc. The four sculptures represent a begging Breton with his crutches and parchment, a Breton of Tr√©gor with hand on heart, a sailor in sou-wester and pieces of fish and a woman of Breton replete with a widow's cloak and hood Tr√©guier War Memorial \\"La Pleureuse\\" in Tr√©guier This war memorial is known as \\"La Pleureuse\\". Renaud had used Marie-Louise Le Put as a model for his sculpture. She wears mourning clothes with a large hood or cowl covering her head (\\"Capuche\\" in French ). The sculpture was commissioned in 1920, shown in 1921 at the Salon des Artistes and the memorial was inaugurated on 2 July 1922. At that time the sculpture was known as \\"Douleur\\". \\"Vonnick\\" This Renaud statue is located in the commune of Perros-Guirec's place de la Mairie. It depicts a young girl from Logonna-Daoulas in Finist√®re wearing Breton dress. The work was created in 1927. A plaster version of the work can be seen in the Mus√©e d'Art et d'Histoire in Saint-Brieuc. √âtables- sur-Mer War Memorial This memorial takes the form of a menhir with Renaud's sculpture of a soldier standing in the front whilst at the rear is a Latin cross and an anchor. Plaques in bronze list the dead of the 1914-1918 and 1939-1945 wars as well as the conflicts in Indochina and Algeria. Langast War Memorial The memorial was inaugurated on 27 January 1924. Renaud's bronze profile of a helmeted soldier is at the base of the obelisk. Tr√©v√© War Memorial This memorial stands in Tr√©v√©'s place de la Mairie and comprises a monument bearing a list of names in letters of gold, next to which is Renaud's sculpture of a woman. Pl≈ìuc-sur-Li√© War Memorial 251 men from this small commune lost their lives in the 1914-1918 war. Originally a German cannon was placed by the monument but this was taken back by the Germans in 1940. \\"L'Hiver\\" This Renaud sculpture is one of four sculptures in the foyer of the Th√©atre Chaillot depicting the four seasons. The work was also known as \\"La Frileuse\\". \\"Veuves d‚ÄôIslandais\\" Renaud had the idea of creating a monument honouring Pierre Loti which would be inspired by two characters from Loti's \\"P√™cheur d‚ÄôIslande\\", Moan and Gaud Mevel learning of Yann Goas' drowning, and presented his plaster model to the Salon des artistes fran√ßais in 1932 winning a gold medal. Several versions were then made in terracotta. Then Renaud produced a much larger maquette of the work, 2 metres high, and this is held by the Mus√©e de Saint-Brieuc. For many years the Association Pierre Loti in Paimpol toyed with the idea of having a monument created using the maquette as a model and it appears that this project is now well advanced. l'Ephebe A 1948 statue of a naked youth is dedicated to the pupils of the Coll√®ge Anatole Le Braz in Saint-Brieuc who had been deported and killed by the Nazis. Monument Lamennais Lamennais memorial by a lake in Chesnale wood This monument is located in Saint-Pierre-de-Plesguen's Chesnale wood and honours F√©licit√© Robert de Lamennais, the French Catholic priest, philosopher, and political theorist. A bronze medallion depicting de Lamennais and executed by Renaud is attached to a large rock in an idyllic setting by a lake in the wood. A Cross is fixed to the top of the rock. The memorial was inaugurated on 10 September 1922. Saint-Brieuc War Memorial This war memorial, erected in 1923, stands in Saint-Brieuc's Boulevard de la Chalotais and honours the 670 men of the commune who were killed in the 1914-1918 war. Renaud sculpted a winged female figure which stands on a pedestal inscribed On either side of the pedestal a semi-circular wall is inscribed with the names of the dead. Subsequently reference to the 1939-1945 was added. Ploufragan War Memorial This was the first war memorial to use a Renaud sculpture and features a standing soldier. It dates to 1920. Plussulien War Memorial This war memorial also involves a Renaud sculpture of a standing soldier. 104 men from Plussulien died in the two World Wars, most of them in the 1914-1918 war.

Name Predating the modern village, at the end of 16th century this territory belonged to a settlement called Yurevychi. Later it became known as Kryvkovshchyna, which is derived from anthroponym Kryvko-Kryvkovych, the family of local landowners circa 16th century. Eventually the name had changed to Kriukivshchyna due to loss of historical connections (apparently in the same way as several neighboring villages, e.g. Zheliany changed to Zhuliany). History * Lavrentii Pokhylevych writes in his \\"Story of Kiev Governorate's Settlements\\" (1864): ** \\"Kriukivshchyna is a village in 2 versts from the village of Hatne near an unnamed stream, which dries up in summer on an elevated plain with rare, for these places, shrub copses. 642 dwellers as well as 12 Jews live here together with Shakhravshchyna. Shakhravshchyna is a separate part of the village by the river Veta. It is populated by the descendants of a Moldovan named Davyd who married a Ukrainian woman in Monastyrysche. That's why all the contemporary dwellers of Shakhravshchyna are called Davydenko. In addition to this local folks tell that on a hill between Shakhravshchyna and Kriukivshchyna, where traces of some kind of settlement can be seen, a knyaz Shakhrai once lived, who owned all the neighboring villages. There's a tract near Shakhravshchyna called Tur's valley. A story says that some 200 years ago Kriukivshchyna and Shakhravshchyna were surrounded by dense forests. Kriukivshchyna, Shakhravshchyna and Yurivka belonged to St. Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery before all estates were taken from the monasteries‚Ä¶\\" ** \\"Exaltation of the Cross wooden church, 5th class; has 51 tithes of land; built on the place of the previous one in 1792.

History  The presidents of the progressive women's associations from Bern (Helene von M√ºlinen), Z√ºrich (Emma Boos Jegher), Lausanne (Marguerite Duvillard Chavannes) and Gen√®ve (Camille Vidart) dealt at the end of the 19th century AD with training and legal issues. In 1896 they organized the first Swiss women's congress and tried to join all women's organizations in a Swiss umbrella organization. Three years later they called Swiss women's associations to form the Bund Schweizerischer Frauenvereine, and so the founding of the Federation of Swiss Women's Associations (from 1971 BSF) was established. BSF targeted the \\"mutual stimulation, the common influence on political decision-making bodies, as well as the adequate representation of Swiss women in the international women's movement.\\" In addition to the founding clubs, the trade associations of teachers, and by 1945 also joined around 250 women's associations of different orientation. Sinde 1903, the BSF is the national umbrella organization representing Switzerland in the International Council of Women (ICW). On the occasion of the creation of the Swiss Civil Code (ZGB), the BSF tried, largely unsuccessful, to establish the system of separation of the personal marital and household property, and to improve the status of illegitimate children. The design of new laws has been a focus of the BSF's activity: morality clauses manifested in the \\"morality movement\\", in the new Penal Code, maternity protection and consideration of women in health insurance and the Swiss insurance for old people and surviving dependants AHV). The publicity for women's suffrage was done by the newly founded Swiss Association for Women's Suffrage, but strongly supported by the BSF after 1909. More focussed activities were on female employment, training, and home economics. The working conditions in the industry and services sectors were examined with inquiries. Through collaboration on the housework and factory legislation, the BSF tried to counter the exploitation of female workers; the relationship between housewife and maids has been regulated with treaties. The BSF is committed to the compulsory home economics education in Swiss schools and to the general recognition of domestic work as a profession. In 1923 the Schweizische Central Office for women's careers opened on the initiative of the second Swiss women's congress, which mainly took political influence in addition to giving advice. Female employment was still at risk despite the success of the SAFFA (1928) in the crisis years between the great European wars. With the collaboration of national defence (Frauenhilfsdienst, literally military women's service) and commissions for care and nutrition during the Second World War, BSF became the main interlocutor of the federal authorities. BSF represents Switzerland in international women's organizations, and participated in the League of Nations and after 1945 at UNESCO. The amendments of 1949 allowed the inclusion of mixed organisations, such as the women's suffrage clubs and the incorporation of the Swiss Federal women's secretariat (founded in 1943). The campaign \\"Equal pay for equal work\\" and the SAFFA (1958) with its plea for the three-phase model \\"Training and profession, motherhood and family, re-entry into the profession\\", marked the time of a booming economy, and contributed to more equality between women and men. The BSF's focus was the betterment of women by public appreciation, and improvement in childhood and marriage law.  SAFFA  Lux Guyer's SAFFAhaus, as of today in K√ºsnacht Saffa-Insel on Z√ºrichsee lakeshore in Wollishofen From 17 July until 15 September 1958, the BSF led the second SAFFA (1.9 million visitors) with over a hundred national and cantonal women's organisations on the Landiwiese in Z√ºrich-Wollishofen. Before, the Saffa-Insel, an artificial island was poured, being still a popular meeting place used also as lido in the summer and for events, among them the Z√ºrcher Theater Spektakel. As chief architect of the exhibition, which stood under the motto \\"Life circle of women in family, occupation, and country\\", acted Annemarie Hubacher-Constam. SAFFA presented the women, who were wanted in the booming economy as consumers and workers, possibilities in the areas of education, employment, shopping and leisure. In accordance with the needs of economic and sociopolitical needs, SAFFA promoted the then three-phase model as a 'ideal female curriculum': employment prior to the marriage, motherhood, and return to the labour market. In addition, the women had to absorb negative impacts of the rapidly changing world, nevertheless, by spreading harmony inside and outside of their families. The men should be made aware of 'women services' in the service of the general public on the indispensability and so motivated to fix the social discrimination against women. With the profits from the two exhibitions, solidarity works were established for women. Tn February 2007, the Swiss Federal Council signed the optional protocol as an addition to the Women Convention for the legal and formal recognition of the full human rights of women in Switzerland. The Internet platform frauennet.ch proposed the decision to organise a third SAFFA on the occasion of their women picnic brunches on the Swiss national holiday on the Saffa-Island in Z√ºrich. For financial reasons, the project could not be started for the time being. Alliance F, the Federation of the Swiss women's organizations, prepared a third Saffa and founded the ¬´2020¬ª association for this purpose, and initiated the project ¬´2020 ‚Äì der weibliche blick auf die zukunft¬ª (literally: 2020 - the female looks to the future). The project seeks to capture ideas and visions for the future of our society from the perspective of women and in an appropriate manner of the public present. A first web presentation was 2013 and started the realization phase to SAFFA 2020.  Organisation and profile  Since 1970, the BSF had recorded a loss of meaning, which contributed among others the setting of the Swiss woman newspaper (Schweizer Frauenblatt), its press and documentation services, as well as a certain foreclosure over the questioning of traditional gender roles. Also the in 1975 respectively in 1996 initiated fourth and fifth Swiss woman congresses had not stopped this development. The Federal Commission for women's issues took over part of the functions. The relocation of the secretariat to Worblaufen 1986 gave new impetus to the BSF in the archives of the Swiss women's movement (Gosteli Stiftung). In 1999, the BSF decided to renamed alliance F. The fifth Swiss women's congress \\"Women 2001\\" founded the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Frauen 2001 (Argef 2001) for seeking a revision of the so-called three-phase model of 1958. The nationwide spread of the \\"Ticino Model\\" in the pre-school and primary school education, may ensure a gainful employment and motherhood.  Associated organisations and members  As of November 2014, alliance F comprises more than 150 nationwide member organizations.

The Cistercian monastery existed after 1250 thanks to magnate of K≈ôi≈æanov whose name was P≈ôibyslav. Early history of the monastery was described in Cronica domus Sarensis by monk Jind≈ôich ≈òezb√°≈ô. The chronicle was written in Latin and it is part of the top middle-age literature. The church was elevated to the honour of a Minor basilica on January 5, 2009. Historical and political situation brought together three very important people of our middle-age history. Those three were husbands of P≈ôibyslav‚Äôs daughters. The husband of their daughter Eufemia ‚Äì Boƒçek of Zbraslav, finished the foundation of the monastery. After his death his brother-in-law, the husband of Eli≈°ka, Smil of Lichtenburk took care of the monastery. P≈ôibyslav‚Äôs eldest daughter Zdislava left with Havel of Lemberk and she died far away ‚Äì in Podje≈°tƒõd√≠. She is one of the Czech saints. The Cistercians with the leading authority of Saint Bernard of Clairvaux pointing towards monastic discipline founded monasteries in the places which were difficult to access since they wanted to come closer to God with their hard work. They chose a border forest between Moravia and Bohemia. The wall painting in the baptismal chapel shows the year 1462 ‚Äì Pope Pius II allowing abbots of ≈Ωƒè√°r to use pontifical regalia. The church itself was founded on the life-giving spring and afterwards it was called Fons Beatae Mariae Virginis ‚Äì the spring of Virgin Mary. Studniƒçn√≠ chapel (the Well Chapel) was part of a cloister and the debris of garden of Eden show the period of prosperity and decay of this place. The statue of the Well Virgin Mary is very important for the monastery. It is to be seen on the side altar in southern aisle. This early Gothic masterpiece was brought by monks of Pomuk. They were running away from the Hussite fury. Pulpit of the Basilica After the year 1705 when V√°clav Vejmluva became a head of the religious communities came the time when there was an architectonic and artistic flourish of the monastery. The masterpiece of this period is the altar of the Annunciation of the Virgin Mary whose concept was made by Jan Bla≈æej Santini Aichel. The dominant of this is the dualistic picture of the Annunciation of the Virgin Mary. The author of this painting is Michael Leopold Willmann. The decoration of the monastery was done by very talented ≈òeho≈ô Theny. This sculptor is the author of the altar in the south chapel of Annuniation of the Virgin Mary (Zvƒõstov√°n√≠ Panny Marie). This sculpture shows the moment when archangel Gabriel annunciated Virgin Mary that she would have a son. The light is falling onto Mary‚Äôs face and the repose urges the visitor to stay still for a while. A perfect example of Santini's creative inventiveness is a built-in music stand and Empire dominant organ in the transept of the church. This rare musical instrument comes from the workshop of Jan David Sieber. ≈Ωƒè√°rsk√© farnosti, Basilica minor of the Annunciation of the Virgin Mary and Saint Nicholas [online]. [23-11-2014].

As a two-year-old in 1997, she dominated the juvenile fillies division in North America, winning five of her six races including the Schuylerville Stakes, Spinaway Stakes, Alcibiades Stakes and Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies. At the end of the year she was voted American Champion Two- Year-Old Filly and rated the best American two-year-old filly for more than fifty years. Her subsequent racing career was relatively disappointing: she failed to win in four starts in 1998 before winning two minor races in 1999. After her retirement from racing she had limited success as a broodmare and died in 2006. Background Countess Diana was a bay mare bred in Kentucky by Richard S Kaster. She was raised at the Sunny Oak Farm near Paris. Her sire Deerhound never contested a Graded stakes race but had an excellent pedigree, being a son of Danzig out of the broodmare Lassie Dear, whose other descendants have included A.P. Indy, Duke of Marmalade, Summer Squall, Lemon Drop Kid and Wolfhound. Countess Diana's dam T V Countess was a Maryland-bred mare who won four races including the Politely Stakes at Pimlico Race Course. As a granddaughter of the broodmare War Exchange she was closely related to Curlin. During her racing career, Countess Diana was owned by Kaster with a variety of partners including his wife, Nancy, his sister (also Nancy) and his brother-in-law Donald Propson. The filly was initially sent into training with Carlos A. Garcia. Racing career =1997: two-year-old season= Countess Diana made her track debut in a four and a half furlong maiden race at Pimlico Race Course on June 6, 1997. Ridden by Mark Johnston, she raced in second before taking the lead in the straight and won by half a length from Brac Drifter, with a gap of ten lengths back to the odds-on favorite Epistola in third. Her winning time of 51.5 was a new track record. After the race she was moved to the stable of Patrick Byrne. The filly was moved up in class for the Grade III Debutante Stakes at Churchill Downs three weeks later. Ridden by Shane Sellers she drew clear of her opponents in the straight but was caught in the closing stages and was beaten half a length by Love Lock. On July 23, Countess Diana faced Love Lock again in the Grade II Schuylerville Stakes at Saratoga Race Course. Starting the 2.3/1 second favourite she led from the start and won by two lengths from Love Lock. In August, Countess Diana was moved up in class and distance for the Grade I Spinaway Stakes at the same track. She was made the 1.7/1 favourite against four opponents headed by the Adirondack Stakes winner Salty Pefume. Sellers sent the filly into the lead from the start and she won by six and a half lengths from Brac Drifter. On 11 October, Countess Diana was matched against the Matron Stakes winner Beautiful Pleasure in the Grade II Alcibiades Stakes over one and one sixteenth of a mile at Keeneland. As in her previous race, she led from the start and drew away in the closing stages to win by two and three quarter lengths from Lily of Gold with the favored Beautiful Pleasure in third. On November 11 Countess Diana started the 2/1 favorite for the fourteenth edition of the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies, which took place that year at Hollywood Park Racetrack. Beautiful Pleasure and Love Lock opposed her again, but her closest rivals in the betting were Career Collection (winner of the Landaluce Stakes and the Sorrento Stakes) and Vivid Angel (Del Mar Debutante Stakes). Ridden as usual by Sellers, she tracked the 32/1 outsider Bay Harbor before moving into the lead half a mile from the finish before drawing away to win by a record margin of eight and a half lengths from Career Collection. =1998: three-year-old season= Before the start of the 1998 season, Countess Diana was transferred to the stable of Bill Mott. She made her seasonal debut in the Grade III Nassau Stakes over seven furlongs at Belmont Park on May 13. She started the odds-on favorite but stumbled at the start and was never able to challenge for the lead, finishing second of the four runners behind Jersey Girl. Despite her defeat, Countess Diana started favorite for the Grade I Acorn Stakes over one mile at the same course on June 7, but after showing some early speed she tired and finished fifth of the ten runners, eleven and a half length behind the winner Jersey Girl. She proved no match for Jersey Girl when the fillies met again in the Mother Goose Stakes three weeks later, finishing four and a half lengths behind the winner in fourth. After a two and a half month break, the filly returned in the Grade I Gazelle Handicap at Belmont on September 12 and finished sixth of the seven runners behind Tap to Music. =1999: four- year-old season= After a break of eleven months, during which she was moved to the stable of Mary J Lomeiher, Countess Diana returned to the track and recorded her first success since the 1997 Breeders' Cup winning an allowance race over six and a half furlongs at Saratoga, leading from the start and beating Memory Call by five and three quarter lengths. When moved back up to Grade I class for the Ballerina Handicap at the same course three weeks later she started second favorite and showed some early speed but tired and finished ninth of the ten runners behind Furlough. Countess Diana was dropped back in class for an allowance race on turf at Keeneland on October 21. Ridden by Craig Perret, she led from the start and won by three lengths from Tasso's Magic. Assessment and awards In the Eclipse Awards for 1997, Countess Diana was named American Champion Two-Year-Old Filly. In the Eperimental Free Handicap, a ranking of the best juveniles to race in North America, she was assigned a weight of 125 pounds, the highest awarded to a filly since First Flight in 1946. Breeding record Countess Diana produced at least six foals and four winners between 2001 and 2006: *Grass Gallop, a bay colt, foaled in 2001, sired by Victory Gallop, unraced *Count Me In, chestnut colt, 2002, by A.P.

The Fort was until recently occupied by the army but was opened to the public from 10 February 2017. Today the fort is being developed as a museum and theme park, as a repository of Punjab‚Äôs history. Popularly known as the Bhangian da Killa (fort of the Bhangis) after its 18th century founder belonging to Bhangi Misl (Opium State) of Dhillon Jats rulers. Sandhawalia Jat ruler Maharaja Ranjit Singh renamed it in the early 19th century after the 10th Sikh guru, Guru Gobind Singh. Gobindgarh Fort is located on the south west fringe of Amritsar, in a square pattern, with a perimeter of 1,000 m and made up entirely of bricks and lime. The fort had 25 cannons mounted on its ramparts and it remained with the Bhangi rulers till 1805. From the middle of the 19th century until Indian independence in 1947, it was occupied by the British army who made numerous defensive improvements to the fort to take account of technological advances in weaponry.  History  It was originally built by Dhillon Jat Misldar (militia chief) Gujjar Singh Banghi of Bhangi Misl, the local chieftain in the 18th century. Gobindgarh was conquered and enhanced in the early 19th century by Sandhawalia Jat ruler Maharaja Ranjit Singh who renamed it after the 10th Sikh guru, Guru Gobind Singh. The fort had five cannons which included the famous two Zamzama cannons. The structures built during this phase were the circular path in the center part of the innermost enclosure, Toshakhana (treasury), and Bastions. In 1805, Maharaja Ranjit Singh strengthened the fort. One of the main reasons to erect the fort was to save Harminder Sahib and the city from the invaders using the Grand Trunk road throughout the 18th century who often attacked the city for the purpose of looting. During this phase, the moat and gates were built using the initial mud foundations to a contemporary military defense structure inspired from French military fortress plans. The fort was renovated with help of a French architect. It is reported that Maharaja Ranjit Singh kept his treasure at the Toshakhana which included the famous Koh-i-Noor and supplies for an army of 2000 soldiers in the fort. In 1849, the British captured the fort and made significant changes. Also, significant changes were made to the bastions and gates as the new artillery technology was adopted.  Fort  It is made of bricks and lime and is laid out in a square. Each of its corners has a parapet and two doors. It had 25 cannons mounted on its ramparts and has four bastions. The main entrance, Nalwa Gate, is named after Hari Singh Nalwa. Keller Gate is the back entrance. A tunnel runs towards Lahore. There were 25 cannons, originally, in the fort. The three bastions connected through a rampart depict positive values in the structure of a common thread. These include the spiritual basis for martial traditions, a multi-cultural ethos, progressive, creative and pragmatic perspective, resistance to tyranny and protection to weak. The buttresses can be functioning as a viewing platform for the parade of the troops and for ceremonial purposes. The bungalow around it was built for the fort commander, with bricks recycled from the earlier Sikh Building. The fort earlier had eight watch towers. Imam-ul-din (younger brother of the Foreign Minister of Lahore Kingdom) of fakir family of Lahore was in-charge of this fort. He was succeeded by his Taj-Ud-din as the Qiladar. The fort housed a coin minting house. Artilleries was also produced at the fort. Raja Dhian Singh, a minister in the court of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, had his residence at the fort. The fort held the grand wedding of Prince Nau Nihal Singh (the grandson of Maharaja Ranjit Singh) in 1837. The fort also had a watch tower which was fifty meters tall and completed in 1874. It was later demolished by the Indian Army after independence.  Private company theme park after Restoration (2017)  Punjabi government gave the fort to Mayanagri One Private Limited who opened a theme park in 2017. Only two museums were kept in public hand.

Built interventions of the Sikh period  * Unique fortification system There cannot be made a clear line of distinction between the construction of fort walls and gates of the Bhangi period and Ranjit Singh‚Äôs period, but the Ravelins were defiantly a Maharaja Ranjit Singh period contribution. The fort had a two-tier system of fort walls and the Ravelins surrounded with a 5m deep moat. The double layer of forts walls at two levels provided for an efficient defense system. The fort walls were 10-12m thick having a mud infill as the core protected on both sides with Nanak shahi bricks in lime mortar. The thick mud walls acted as a thrust absorption wall in case of cannon ball attacks. The flat terrain and the improved European artillery posed a greater threat and a challenge for the working of this fort. Maharaja Ranjit Singh had raised a Fuaz-i-khas with the help of the French Military officers by the year 1823. Along with the French warfare techniques, these officers brought along with them French contemporary fortification systems to support the same. The maharaja adopted these systems in Gobindgarh fort to strengthen the mud fort. The ravelin‚Äîas highlands sloping outwards, were constructed in front of the curtain fort walls. These provided the defender with a suitable position at a high point to place his cannon and get a wide range of the enemy at a lower level, while the enemy had his cannon at the disadvantageous position. Even if the enemy succeeded in climbing up the ravelins, they made easy target for the cannons at the rampart. * Circular plinth of the Bungalow This building is positioned as almost the geometrical center of the fort complex. The central positioning indicates a prime building usage. The circular plinth is the only remains of the Sikh building, which in itself speaks volumes about its rich architectural legacy. It might have been a plinth to a very high conical building (suggested in accordance to similar contemporary buildings). It is a retaining high plinth supported by an outer masonry wall and highly ornate masonry buttress. These circular buttresses have a broader capital with three cornice bands of masonry. This projecting cornice band continues all over the circular wall at the plinth level. It has a mud infill with Nanak shahi bricks in lime mortar. The details of the ornamentation are in masonry. The surface might have had a lime plaster as the surface treatment. * Toshakhana The building was originally built with Lime plaster. Toshakhana was built by Maharaja Ranjit Singh. The Toshakhana lies abutting the northern fort wall at the center. It is a square building divided into two chambers. The walls are supported by masonry ornate buttress (Burj). These buttresses are three faced tapering columnar supports with a domical capital. The two chambers have low vaulted roofs covered by a single vault above them‚Äîa double vault system. The 1.5m thick walls and vaults are constructed with Nanak shahi bricks in lime mortar. No evidence of original flooring can be seen Maharaja Ranjit Singh announced MislBeli Ram is in charge of Toshkhana in 1813 A.D. Adjacent to a building wall, rooms were built to accommodate soldiers. On the south side of the building, a lightning conduction system made of copper was found. * Bastions There are four bastions at four cardinal points of the forts ‚Äî strategically located to guard the fort. They are situated on a high circular plinth which forms the part of the rampart wall. They are conical heavy masonry bastions with a crenellation band running at the top level. At this point of time, the bastions might have been open to the sky. * Military Engineering A long road from the Vijay Chowk entrance leads to the first historic gate, the Outer Gate. Crossing the two parts of the outer gate the road winds to the right and hits perpendicular to the Nalwa Gate (an elaborate double gate). The Nalwa Gate has a passageway to the lower lever of rampart as well. After crossing the Nalwa Gate, the road suddenly takes a sharp turn into the Inner gate. Through the inner gate, the road again winds and enters the court of the complex. The gates are thus positioned as checkpoints and sudden turns and winds in the road are purposely designed to incorporate surprise attacks on the approaching army. At every entrance, posts for the soldiers to defend and counterattack the enemy can be observed. Right outside the outer gate, the multiple lines of forces of attack come into play. The watch tower would have had troops positioned at an upper level in front of the gate and a cutout in the rampart across would have had a cannon positioned to fire at the approaching enemy. Thus multiple levels of lines of attack are designed. The bastion has a two-tier level of defense. The arched openings and the terrace together act as a double system of platforms for the attack.  Built interventions of the British period  * Roofing of bastions After the British took charge of the fort in the mid 1850s, there was no threat of war against the controlling East India Company, except for some local uprisings which were small-scale affairs and not requiring the use of the fort as a military active complex. By 1859 the bastions came to be used primarily as barracks for housing soldiers. Since cannons were no longer fired in the bastions (with the impact of cannon fire thrust no longer a factor), they were instead used for accommodation. A conservation, management and reuse plan for Gobindgarh Fort was drawn up by the British, who then constructed roofs over the bastions. A changing political scenario triggered a change in building use, resulting in alterations in the form. The internal arched walls were then built upon in thinner sections repeating the arches below to raise the walls up to the desired terrace level. A typical madras roof‚Äîa traditional flat roof of wood beams, purlins, and tiles with mud terracing, originated from south India and adopted by British‚Äîwas constructed. Skylights, with pitched roofing and centrally pivoted openings for ventilation with semicircular bulging jaali detail, were constructed to optimize the lighting conditions in these large barrack spaces. * Bungalow A circular Sikh building positioned almost at the center of the fort complex was either brought down during the capture of the fort or later ‚Äî no evidence for the same can be found. However, it is noteworthy that it seems that the British pulled down the building above the plinth level and built the superstructure reusing the same materials. The central position of the building indicates its significance in the Sikh era, thus this act of building on top of the Sikh plinth was a political power statement. In 1864 a rectangular superstructure housing four officers quarters were built (a legend runs that this was Bungalow, but this cannot be verified). A grand colonial staircase was built with ornamental masonry buttress. It is a semi-spiral staircase on the eastern fa√ßade, while a service staircase is also present to the west side, but its year of construction cannot be determined. The design of the quarters was such that, all four quarters had individual entry and a verandah at the rear. Each quarter had 2-3 small habitable rooms. A cook house and 8 servant‚Äôs quarters are also recorded to have been in existence, although their evidence on site in the present context cannot be verified. According to records, it was built with the reuse of Nanak shahi bricks in mud mortar, the flooring was constructed of cement concrete, whereas the roofing was designed as a mud roof with flat tiles. * Darbar Hall Darbar Hall- Gobindgarh Fort, Amritsar The Durbar Hall lies to the east end almost on the center of the North-South axis. It is approached by the main road that leads from the inner gate. It lies to the south of this road and to the east of Bungalow. The plinth protection and the wooden louvers indicate that the entrance would have been from the west fa√ßade. As per records, it was built in 1850 as a six-bed hospital. It is a building of typical colonial design, rectangular double-storied with a colonnade verandah running all around on both the floors. The ground floor is divided into three bays of rooms further subdivided into two to three rooms. It has a high ceiling. A grand masonry staircase, with a wooden railing, leads to the upper floor. Although the ground floor could have been a hospital, the upper floor‚Äîwith a huge hall and oval, glazed ornamental ventilators‚Äîdoes not conform to this type of use. The floor‚Äôs use and its period of construction are undetermined. With four fireplaces, it is a huge public hall that reflects a celebratory mood. The walls are of Nanak shahi bricks with mud mortar, although it is important to note that special bricks (especially cast bricks with beveled edges) were used in columns and plinth etc. the floors were of cement concrete. The verandahs had interesting wooden louvers and rails with bracings to guard against the tropical heat. Remnants of a pulley system indicate that curtains were installed for the same purpose. The roofing and intermediate floor were a system of wooden beams (specially carved edges) resting on wooden brackets, wooden purlins and brick tiles with mud infill terracing. The building‚Äôs columns may have had exposed gauge work, while the walls may have had lime plaster. * Barracks and Officers' Mess This building lies to the south of the bungalow in very close proximity. The scale of the original Sikh building might have been small and non-obtrusive to the Bungalow Sikh plinth, but the colonial additions disrupted the scale and size of the building such that it seems to hinder the appreciation of the circular Sikh plinth of the Bungalow. This building was built on the remnants of an old Sikh building, the thick north and south walls and the typical multi-foliated, arched ornamental openings verify the same. The central core rooms must have been of Sikh origin, which during the British period in 1850 was remodeled as a colonial building. This rectangular building, running in an east-west direction, was subdivided into smaller rooms. A colonnaded verandah was constructed to its west‚Äîagain, a typical colonial feature to guard against the tropical heat. The building was used as a mess hall and barracks for officers (OR‚Äôs). The thick, Sikh period North-South walls are constructed of Nanak shahi bricks in lime mortar, whereas the British period walls are of nana shahi bricks in mud mortar. The original flooring is unknown, however in British times it was converted to cement concrete. The original masonry vault roofing, typical to Sikh period buildings, was replaced by an interesting wooden truss system with tiles and mud infill as the roof covering. * Chloronome house This building lies to the west of Durbar Hall and opposite to the mess hall. This is a colonial era building, built in 1853 (as per MES records-date of purchase/date of erection), which was used for the treatment and purification of water by chlorination. It is built next to a Sikh period well, which was used as a chlorinating tank. It has two rooms, one of which has a circular pit to house chlorination apparatus (a myth, however, holds it to be a Phasi ghar‚Äî hanging place). The structure also has a water tank mounted on the terrace, as part of the water treatment equipment. The building is constructed with modular bricks in mud mortar having cement concrete flooring and terraced on jack arches.  Zamzama  Replica of Zam-Zammah - Front View- Placed at Gobindgarh Fort, Amritsar Bhangia-di-top or the gun belonging to the BhangiMisl, known as Zamzama, is a massive, heavyweight gun, an 80 pounder, 14 feet, 4¬Ω inches in length, with a bore aperture of 9¬Ω inches. This gun, one of the largest ever made in the sub-continent, was cast at Lahore along with another gun of the same size in 1757 by Shah Nazir (a metalsmith of the former Mughal viceroy ), under the directions of Shah Wali Khan, who was prime minister in the reign of the Afghan King Ahmed Shah Durrani. According to some writers, some metal was obtained through jizya, metal vessels having been taken from Hindu households in Lahore. Replica of Zam-Zammah - Side View - at Gobindgarh Fort, Amritsar The cannon bears two Persian inscriptions. The front one reads: \\"By the order of the Emperor [Ahmad Shah], DuriDurran, Shah Wali Khan wazir made the gun named Zamzama or the Taker of Strongholds.\\" And the longer versified inscription reads: \\"A destroyer even of the strongholds of the heaven.\\" In 1762, the Bhangi chief, Hari Singh, attacked Lahore and took possession of the cannon. It then came to be known as Bhangian di Top. In 1802, when Maharaja Ranjit Singh occupied Amritsar, the cannon fell into his hands. Ranjit Singh employed it in his campaigns of Daska, Kasur, Sujanpur, Wazirabad and Multan. It was transported to Multan in a specially built carriage during the siege of the citadel in 1810, but it failed to discharge.

There are many different species that affect different trees. For example, Hypoxylon atropunctatum, a common species, is found on oak trees, Hypoxylon tinctor affects sycamore trees, and Hypoxylon mammatum infests aspen trees (2,3,16). Although the fungus is found on the majority of tree bark in an infested area, it only harms the tree when the tree becomes stressed or injured because it is easier to infect (2). Thus, Hypoxylon had an endophytic stage. An endophyte is a bacterium or fungus that spends some of its life not causing disease to the host while being on it (12). When a stress or injury occurs, the fungus will infect and begin living off the nutrients of the tree. Hypoxylon infects trees throughout the United States, but a few notable wide-scale problems have occurred in Arkansas, North Texas, Oklahoma, and the Mountain West (2,3,5,16). Hypoxylon canker of shade trees is a secondary disease: a primary factor, such as drought or physical damage, usually causes the dying and decaying of the tree first before the Hypoxylon canker pathogen infects (4). This will cause the tree to be in stress and potentially start to decay. The pathogen infects the living tree while it is in stress; it will not infect a tree that is healthy or already dead (3). In order for a tree to become infected, the tree must be already dying or at least has branches that are dying. The pathogen will therefore kill the tree if the tree is unhealthy.  Hosts and Symptoms  Hypoxylon mammatum symptoms on aspen Hypoxylon canker of shade trees has three primary species, through which the pathogen can infect a variety of hardwood shade trees. Hypoxylon atropunctatum is most commonly found on oak, Hypoxylon mammatum is a significant pathogen on aspen trees, and Hypoxylon tinctor infects sycamore trees (2,3,16). In order to tell if the pathogen is affecting the tree, the bark must be closely examined, but the symptoms are distinct. Early stages of the disease show a light brown and tan color that looks dry and dusty. Later on, as the pathogen goes through the sexual stage, the bark will turn to a dark grey color. The bark becomes brittle and flakes off (2) and black and grey cankers will appear (3). Because these changes are indications of a disease, these are symptoms. They demonstrate that the pathogen is present and infecting or has already infested the host. Hypoxylon also produces characteristic signs, which are either going to be direct products of the pathogen or the appearance of the pathogen itself. The signs we can see from Hypoxylon are conidia and ascospores. Conidia are produced during the asexual stage, while ascospores are produced during the sexual stage (4,7). You can sometimes see the conidia with the naked eye if they are structuralized, but it is much easier to see them under a dissecting microscope. When looking underneath a compound microscope, you will be able to see the ascospores. They will be located on perithecia. The microscopic signs of the perithecium are the flask-shaped sexual fruiting body that contains ascospores. Lastly, the pathogen is going to be found primarily just beneath the bark of the trees, located throughout the tree and if the pathogen spreads. The pathogen can also spread to the bark of surrounding trees (3). If you start to see symptoms on the main trunk, the tree is likely too diseased to save, since the trunk is the spot where the nutrients and water are transported. Once Hypoxylon is active on the main trunk, there is no other way for the water and nutrients to get to the rest of the tree and thus it dies. Fortunately, if Hypoxylon is found on the branches or limbs there is a good chance the tree will live if the fungus does not spread. Pruning out the limbs and branches that look like they have the disease on it or are dying will solve the problem (2).  Disease Cycle  = Factors that give rise to infection = Hypoxylon canker of shade trees is an ascomycete fungal disease (1,6). The fungal pathogen must take advantage of wounds in the host tree or unhealthy tree tissue to infect and colonize the host, as normal, robust trees are not very susceptible to infection (1). However, many hosts of Hypoxylon canker, such as red and post oaks, are especially sensitive to external factors; thus, they are easily stressed and can become susceptible hosts (2). It is often noted that Hypoxylon canker does not kill a tree--it merely capitalizes on trees that are already dying due to stress or other means, and may be a significant contributing factor to tree death (3). It is important to note that the Hypoxylon can remain dormant in healthy trees for many years before becoming pathogenic due to plant stress from temperature, water loss, physical and chemical diseases, and other plant pathogens (5). = Stages of infection = While the spores can colonize and slowly grow under the bark of trees in an endophytic stage, they do not demonstrate any pathogenic effects or grow in great numbers until the tree is water stressed, nutrient depleted, or physically damaged; for this reason, the year following a significant drought or other physical stress is often when Hypoxylon canker is seen in shade trees (4). Thus, before stress, Hypoxylon only infects its host in a local, benign manner, with limited propagation. Once the stress occurs, however, the fungus colonizes the inner parts of the bark and vascular system; while the infection is not fully systemic, it is certainly less localized than before stress (4). Hypoxylon canker of shade trees has both an asexual (anamorph) and sexual (teleomorph) life cycle (2).  Asexual (anamorph) stage  The fungus can infect seedlings and typically colonizes under the bark of the trees (3). Since the fungus infects under the bark, the signs of the pathogen aren't visible until the bark sheds off in response to the physical pressure imposed by the growthing pathogen; this typically happens in the transition between spring and summer (3). This shedding reveals large brown fungal mats, called stroma, which are the asexual reproductive structures that house the asexual spores, conidia, on conidiophores (4). At this point, the reproductive structures will release conidia (3). These spores are distributed by wind or rain splash (3). If these spores land on a susceptible host, successful infection will take place if there are humid and warm conditions for 48 hours (1).  Sexual (teleomorph) stage  After the conidia have been dispersed by late summer and fall, the stroma turn very dark, often brown or black, and crusty (3). At this point, the stroma produce sexual fruiting bodies. Within these perithecia fruiting bodies, the sexual spores--ascospores‚Äîare produced in and can also be distributed via rain splash and wind and infect in a manner similar to the conidia (7, 14).  Environment  Hypoxylon canker greatly depends on dying tree matter, which is why it generally attacks only damaged and stressed trees. Normal, healthy trees are able to fend of infection with their natural defense mechanisms such as basal defense and hypersensitive response (2). Furthermore, it is known that the Hypoxylon fungi already exist on the majority of trees and are only waiting for a possible infection route to be created. When damage or stress occurs, the fungi will further colonize, infect, and begin living off the nutrients of the tree, flourishing in the bark and vascular system (2). Natural stresses such as defoliation by insects, animal damage, soil nutrient depletions, drought, overcrowding, and other disease can weaken trees, enabling Hypoxylon to infect (9). Human-caused problems can also lead to infection; soil compaction and excavation, construction, and physical injuries are known stresses to trees (9). Drought is one of the major indicators that Hypoxylon will become a problem in the following months to years. Droughts account for a large majority of tree-related problems as the water deficit has a negative effect on the tree‚Äôs natural developments (9). Symptoms usually develop within a year after a drought, but with extreme conditions can develop in a matter of months. (4). A major factor in the survival of Hypoxylon canker is the moisture content within the tree wood. When the stresses mentioned above begin to weaken the tree, moisture content of the wood decreases. As the wood further dries, the Hypoxylon fungi will feed and further white rot and decay of the tree will occur, potentially causing death (9).  Management  Although there is no known cure for Hypoxylon canker, proper management practices and care can significantly reduce problems that may occur. Generally, avoiding tree stress and maintaining an overall healthy tree is the most ideal way of avoiding the canker. Avoiding any physical injuries to the trunk, limbs, or roots is important as these injuries can disrupt growth processes and xylem/phloem transport. Disruptions to the soil surrounding the tree should also be minimized. Any major disruptions, such as landscaping or irrigation modifications, in the surrounding environment can develop significant problems for both young and mature trees (2). Proper herbicides, pesticides, and fertilizers should be used in further tree protection. Additionally, adequate propagation along with good drainage is extremely important in sustaining a healthy tree. Studies have found that Hypoxylon canker favors lower tree density stands in addition to only stressed trees (10). This could be due to the mode of spore dispersal, the inability of spores to germinate on older bark, the fungal method of entry, and the specific tree age (11). If possible, minimize forest thinning unless recommended by an arborist or qualified specialist. When dead or dying tree branches do appear, selective pruning should be performed to remove these potential infection sources. The removal of dead or infected regions can prevent or considerably reduce advances of Hypoxylon (3).  Importance  The most significant impact of Hypoxylon canker of shade trees is that the ascomycete fungal pathogen can contribute to the death of many species of tall, mature shade trees (4). This can have an economic impact, since many of these types of trees are used for aesthetic landscaping in residential and commercial areas (1). There is also an ecological impact; specifically, Hypoxylon canker is most devastating to forest aspen trees (1). Aspen distribution in Utah, in National Forest System lands, has decreased by 60% (8). Though Hypoxylon is not the major cause of this decline, Hypoxylon mammatum is estimated to infect 30% of aspens each year across the Midwest (16). In 1972, the damage was significant enough to cause losses of $4 million worth of aspen across Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Michigan (16). Furthermore, severe drought conditions throughout the American West could exacerbate Hypoxylon damage to aspens since the fungus takes advantage of water stressed trees (15). Overall, the loss of aspen or any other species of tall, mature shade trees can have a large impact on the surrounding ecosystem; these trees can serve as habitat for a variety of animals (5). Since Hypoxylon canker of shade trees is found throughout the United States, in regions such as the mountain West, coastal South, and Midwest/Great Lakes region (5, 8, 1), the preservation and protection of the host trees is particularly significant.

The route starts at a frontage road and travels east along an old alignment of U.S. Route 80 (US 80). MS 822 then ends near Boniva, where state maintenance ends. The highway was designated in 1998, after US 80 was realigned onto Interstate 20 (I-20). Route description All of the route is located in Warren County. In 2013, Mississippi Department of Transportation (MDOT) calculated as many as 16,000 vehicles traveling west of Maxwell Drive, and as few as 2,700 vehicles traveling west of Amber Leaf Drive. It is not included as a part of the National Highway System (NHS), a network of highways identified as being most important for the economy, mobility and defense of the nation. The route is legally defined in Mississippi Code ¬ß 65-3-3, and is maintained by the Mississippi Department of Transportation. MS 822 starts at a I-20 frontage road, where state maintenance begins. It soon intersects I-20, US 61, and US 80 at an incomplete, modified cloverleaf interchange. The road, known as Clay Street, travels past a few stores before intersecting MS 27. After that, the road enters through a forest, with small roads and driveways leading to groups of houses. MS 822 then meets Mount Alban Road, a road that crosses over I-20. The route continues to parallel I-20, and gradually closer to a railroad owned by Kansas City Southern Railway. I-20 travels closer toward MS 822 as it heads eastward. The two highways soon travel adjacent to each other. Shortly after I-20 begins to travel northeastward again, MS 822 reaches its eastern terminus at the end of state maintenance. The pavement then changes, and the road continues into Bovina. History US 80 has existed since 1928, from Vicksburg and through Meridian. It was paved in numerous sections, including the section in Warren County. That section was straightened out in 1934. By 1960, I-20 was being constructed, and intersected US 80 east of Vicksburg. Four years later, I-20 was extended, connecting to US 80 just west of the Warren‚ÄìHinds county line. An interchange was built there by 1967. US 80 realigned south of the interchange, and no longer intersected I-20 near Bovina a few years later. Twenty-four years later, in 1998, US 80 in Warren County was realigned onto I-20, and the alignment between Vicksburg and Bovina became MS 822. No significant changes have been made to the route since.

The species was first described in 1788. A population with darker flowers had been considered a subspecies of P. coccinea, but was described as a separate species, P. proctori, in 2003.1 Info =Range and Biography= * Portlandia albiflora * Portlandia grandiflora * Portlandia harrisii * Portlandia microsepala *Portlandia proctorii *Portlandia speciosa Endemic to Jamaica's Caribbean ecology and biography Portlandia coccinea thrive most in warm climates and can survive in acidic soil and high altitude. These plants contain beautiful bell like ornamental flowers used in landscaping, even here in the native Miami-Dade tropical region. The plants flower twice a year, once between March to October, June to August, and fruit between July and October.5 =Key Features= Portlandia coccinea grow as evergreen shrubs or treelets 2.5‚Äì5 m in height, with pyramidal architecture. Their branches are very thin and brittle with a pale complexion. Leaves are oval, waxy, and dark green in color. They have stipules that are usually free or narrowly connected to the base. The plants flower twice a year, once between March to October, June to August, and fruit between July and October. The inflorescence is a reduced cyme (determinate), with 1-3 trumpet shaped flowers at each node. Stigmas and anthers of each flower project just beyond the corolla. Colors range from dark pink and deep crimson to white (hybrids) and are 6-8.5 cm in length. Flowers are followed by woody capsules containing the seeds.5 =Ecology= P. coccinea grows in the understory of limestone montane forests. In its native habitat, it is mainly pollinated by a Hummingbird called the Jamaica Mango. It is also pollinated by the red-billed Hummingbird.1 Uses Portlandia coccinea grows very beautiful and exotic flowers. Therefore, its economic purpose is mostly ornamental. It is planted in gardens to display its large attractive flowers. Hybrids of this species and other species of the same genus have been created to display several different colors of flowers.1 =Cultivation= Portlandia coccinea is a slow growing shrub. It can be grown in areas of warm climate, including subtropical areas such as Miami. It prefers limestone soils. The plant will flower throughout the year if continuously irrigated.12 References Delprete, P. G., & Motley, T. J. (2003).

Details The gallery was built in 1887/8, designed by architect Edwin Seward in a Queen Anne style for the rich local flour merchant, James Pyke Thompson. Pyke Thompson used the gallery to exhibit his collection of artworks, which include drawings, etchings, and ceramics, by artists including Rembrandt, with free entry to the public. The collection notably includes paintings by J. M. W. Turner, after which the gallery was named. Turner House Gallery was acquired by the National Museum of Wales in 1921 and used to display the museum's secondary public art collection. The building was given Grade II listed status in 1993. In 2003 Turner House was taken over by the registered charity, Ffotogallery, and has subsequently been used for photography-based exhibitions. In 2014/15 the gallery became part of a wider Artes Mundi exhibition, staging works by Icelandic artist Ragnar Kjartansson and Croatian artist Sanja Ivekoviƒá for Artes Mundi 6. In 2018 Ffotogallery announced that it will be leaving Turner House for new premises in the centre of Cardiff, starting in July 2019.

Voids are typically the result of poor manufacturing of the material and are generally deemed undesirable. Voids can affect the mechanical properties and lifespan of the composite. ASTM D2734-09, Standard Test Methods for Void Content of Reinforced Plastics, ASTM International, West Conshohocken, PA, 2009, www.astm.org They degrade mainly the matrix-dominated properties such as interlaminar shear strength, longitudinal compressive strength, and transverse tensile strength. Voids can act as crack initiation sites as well as allow moisture to penetrate the composite and contribute to the anisotropy of the composite.Hull, D., & Clyne, T. (1996). Fiber Architecture - Voids. In An introduction to composite materials (2nd ed., pp. 55-56). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. For aerospace applications, a void content of approximately 1% is still acceptable, while for less sensitive applications, the allowance limit is 3-5%. Although a small increase in void content may not seem to cause significant issues, a 1-3% increase in void content of carbon fiber reinforced composite can reduce the mechanical properties by up to 20% Void content in composites is represented as a ratio, also called void ratio, where the volume of voids, solid material, and bulk volume are taken into account. Void ratio can be calculated by the formula below where e is the void ratio of the composite, Vv is the volume of the voids, and Vt is the volume of the bulk material. :\\\\text{Void Ratio}(e)=\\\\frac{V_v}{V_t-V_v} Formation of Voids Voids are considered defects in composite structures and there are several types of voids that can form in composites depending on the fabrication route and matrix type. Among other factors that can influence the quantity and location of voids are pre- preg impregnation, surface morphology, curing parameters, compaction pressure, fiber bridging, excessive resin bleed, and the thickness of layup .Hayes, B., & Gammon, L. (2004). Void Analysis of Composite Materials. In ASM Handbook, Volume 9: Metallography and Microstructures (Vol. 9). ASM International. http://products.asminternational.org.prox.lib.ncsu.edu/hbk/do/highlight/content/V09_2004/D07/A09/s0504737.htm A resin with a high viscosity will likely produce voids in a composite. It is difficult for a resin or matrix with a high viscosity to penetrate the original void spaces between adjacent fibers. This will cause voids to form close the fiber surface. Preventing these voids becomes a more daunting task when the fibers are packed tightly together in a composite A high void proportion can be obtained in a composite due to errors in processing as well. If the temperature used for curing is too low for the particular matrix used, complete degassing might not occur. However, if the temperature used for curing is too high for a particular matrix, gelation might occur too rapidly and voids may still be present .M. J. Yokota, Process controlled curing of resin matrix composites, SAMPE J., I4(4), (1978). For example, if a laminate composite is cured at a temperature that is too low for the particular matrix used, the resin viscosity could remain high and hinder removing the void spaces between individual plies Some resins can cure at room temperature while other resins require temperatures up to 200 ¬∞C, but curing above or below the required temperature for a particular matrix can increase the amount of voids present in a composite. If the injection pressure in a resin injection pultrusion process is not high enough, the resin or matrix might not be able to penetrate the fiber bed to completely wet out the fibers without voids. Entrapped air or bubbles can be formed in the resin during resin mixing or as a result of mechanical gas entrapment by dual scale fingering in fibrous reinforcements. If these bubbles are not removed before the wetting of the fibers or curing of the composite, the bubbles could become voids that can be found throughout the final composite structure. Reduction of Voids Because voids are viewed as defects in composite materials, many methods are applied for reducing voids in composites. Traditionally, using vacuum bagging system and autoclave under pressure and heat will minimize or prevent voids from forming. The vacuum bagging system combined with autoclave is a common method used in industrial processes to achieve a low void content for thermoset composites. Vacuum evacuation is the way reducing exciting amount of voids by physically transporting the voids out of the resin and fiber network through vacuum lines, and it is influenced by the viscosity of resin. Autoclave pressure is used to assist vacuum in removing trapped air and excess resin while at the same time preventing volatiles from coming out of the resin at high temperatures . Optimization of injection flow rate is often calculated to minimize voids in Resin Transfer Molded (RTM) or Vacuum Assisted Resin Infusion (VARI) composites. During the injection phase, a liquid resin impregnates the fibers before curing and solidification, often creating voids in the part during the injection. Through an algorithm between fluid flow velocity (v) and the percentages of macro-voids (V1) and micro-voids (V2) :V_1= -32.28-11.8\\\\cdot \\\\log(v) :V_2= 6.35+2.35 \\\\cdot \\\\log(v) an optimized rate can be obtained and the voids in RTM and VARI composites can be reduced, thus improving properties of the composite .

He worked in France, where he was known as Antoine Rumpelmayer.  Biography  In 1870, the confectioner Rumpelmeyer moved from Pressburg (now Bratislava, Slovakia) - others say from Upper Austria - to the French Riviera. He probably first worked in Viktor Sylvain Perrimond's business in Menton. In 1896 they founded the Perrimond-Mayer company and opened new shops in Cannes, Nice and Aix-les-Bains. The Rumpelmayer establishment at 107 Avenue du G√©n√©ral du Gaulle in Aix was opened in 1887. It is still open today. Empress Elisabeth of Austria-Hungary often visited the area. In the course of these travels, she visited the Rumpelmayer establishment, and as a result, he was received at the Vienna Court to be awarded the honour of (\\"Confectioner to the Court\\"). He was awarded this in 1896 by the Empress in person and is thus one of the very few whose award was made verbally by an imperial majesty. Rumpelmayer's partner received the honour at the same time. In Dresden, Conditorei Rumplelmayer GmbH ran its own factory producing chocolate candies, fruit preserves and a sweet pastries. The company had branches in Baden-Baden, Bad Nauheim, Frankfurt and Berlin (at 208/209 Kurf√ºrstendamm). The Rumpelmayer in Baden-Baden is still open. Rumpelmayer was also Purveyor to the Court of Baden and Saxony. In 1903, Rumpelmayer opened a shop at 226 Rue de Rivoli in Paris and another branch with his son Ren√©. From 1916 his widow Angelina (n√©e Guillarmou) took over. The Angelina tea house became the meeting place of Parisian high society, and is still open. Further Rumpelmayer Caf√©s opened, operated either directly or as franchises. The one in St James's Street, London became a household name. Its delivery service even found its way into literature: it is mentioned several times in Virginia Woolf's novel Mrs Dalloway. Another caf√© was located in the Hotel St. Moritz at Central Park in New York City. It opened at the same time as the hotel in early 1930. The architect Winold Reiss designed the building in the Art D√©co style. The caf√© closed, with the hotel, in the 1990s.

The most original way of doing 3D content retrieval uses methods to add description text to 3D content files such as the content file name, link text, and the web page title so that related 3D content can be found through text retrieval. Because of the inefficiency of manually annotating 3D files, researchers have investigated ways to automate the annotation process and provide a unified standard to create text descriptions for 3D contents. Moreover, the increase in 3D content has demanded and inspired more advanced ways to retrieve 3D information. Thus, shape matching methods for 3D content retrieval have become popular. Shape matching retrieval is based on techniques that compare and contrast similarities between 3D models. 3D retrieval methods Derive a high level description (e.g.: a skeleton) and then find matching results This method describes 3D models by using a skeleton. The skeleton encodes the geometric and topological information in the form of a skeletal graph and uses graph matching techniques to match the skeletons and compare them.Sundar, H., Silver, D., Gagvani, N., Dickinson, S., Skeleton based shape matching and retrieval, In: Proc. SMI, Seoul, Korea (2003) However, this method requires a 2-manifold input model, and it is very sensitive to noise and details. Many of the existing 3D models are created for visualization purposes, while missing the input quality standard for the skeleton method. The skeleton 3D retrieval method needs more time and effort before it can be used widely. Compute a feature vector based on statistics Unlike Skeleton modeling, which requires a high quality standard for the input source, statistical methods do not put restriction on the validity of an input source. Shape histograms, feature vectors composed of global geo-metic properties such as circularity and eccentricity, and feature vectors created using frequency decomposition of spherical functions are common examples of using statistical methods to describe 3D information.Min, P., Kazhdan, M., Funkhouser, T., A comparison of text and shape matching for retrieval of Online 3D models. Research And Advanced Technology For Digital Libraries, 2004, Vol.3232, pp.209-220 2D projection method Some approaches use 2D projections of a 3D model, justified by the assumption that if two objects are similar in 3D, then they should have similar 2D projections in many directions.

Eurographics, Granada, Spain (2003) are good examples of 2D projection methods. 3D Engineering Search System In Purdue University, researchers led by Professor Karthik Ramani at the Research and Education Center for Information created a 3D search engine called the 3D Engineering Search System (3DESS). It is designed to find computer-generated engineering parts. The mechanism behind this search engine is that it starts from an algorithm which can transform query drawing to voxels, then extracts the most important shape information from the voxels by using another algorithm called thinning, and formulates a skeleton of the object‚Äôs outlines and topology. After that, 3DESS will develop a skeletal graph to render the skeleton, using three common topological constructs: loops, edges, and nodes. The processed common constructs graph can reduce the data amount to represent an object, and it is easier to store and index the description in a database.Ortiz, S., 3D searching starts to take shape, Computer, 2004, Vol.37(8), pp.24-26 According to the lead professor, 3DESS can also describe objects using feature vectors, such as volume, surface area, etc. The system processes queries by comparing their feature vectors or skeletal graphs with data stored in the database. When the system retrieves models in response to the query, users can pick whichever object looks more similar to what they want and leave feedback. Challenges Challenges associated with 3D shape-based similarity queries With the skeleton modeling 3D retrieval method, figuring out an efficient way to index 3D shape descriptors is very challenging because 3D shape indexing has very strict criteria. The 3D models must be quick to compute, concise to store, easy to index, invariant under similarity transformations, insensitive to noise and small extra features, robust to arbitrary topological degeneracies, and discriminating of shape differences at many scales. 3D search and retrieval with multimodal support challenges In order to make the 3D search interface simple enough for novice users who know little on 3D retrieval input source requirements, a multimodal retrieval system, which can take various types of input sources and provide robust query results, is necessary. So far, only a few approaches have been proposed. In Funkhouser et al. (2003),Funkhouser, T., Min, P., Kazhdan, M., Chen, J., Halderman, A.,Dobkin, D., & Jacobs, D. (2003). A search engine for 3D models. ACM Transactions on Graphics, 22(1), 83‚Äì105 the proposed ‚ÄúPrinceton 3D search engine‚Äù supports 2D sketches, 3D sketches, 3D models and text as queries. In Chen et al. (2003),Chen, D.Y., Ouhyoung, M., Tian, X.P., Shen, Y.T., Ouhyoung, M., On visual similarity based 3D model retrieval, In: Proc. Eurographics, Granada, Spain (2003) he designed a 3D retrieval system that intakes 2D sketches and retrieves for 3D objects. Recently, Ansary et al.

Pidmohylny created the modern novel, which is focused on urban problems and touches upon philosophical questions of being. In this novel psyche of the characters is analyzed and the conflict takes place between people with different worldviews. Misto is the first urban novel in the Ukrainian literature, with new characters, issues and narrative style.  History of writing  In the novel Valerian Pidmohylny described the Ukrainian peasant youth, who in the early 1920s went in thousands to the cities to conquer them, pour a fresh peasant blood into them, and liquidate the Ukrainian antagonism between the city and the country. The novel was not like a traditional populist prose of the 19th century because the European novel of the 19th ‚Äì early 20th century guided the author. He learned tradition of Romance of Honor√© de Balzac, Guy de Maupassant, Anatole France, Jack London, and domestic ‚Äì Ahatanhel Krymsky, Volodymyr Vynnychenko.  Features of plotline  The story is presented by the history of the soul of Stepan Radchenko. He is an energetic rural young man who arrives in Kyiv (Kiev) to get into the economic university and hopes to come back with new knowledge to the village. Stepan has got nothing in the capital of Ukraine. Nevertheless, over time, there is a gradual conquest of the city. Stepan settles down in the suburbs where life is not much different from rural. Later he moves closer to the center, rents a separate apartment. At the end of the novel, he feels himself the owner of the city: \\"It lies humbly beneath wavy rocks, marked by points of fire, and stretches him from the darkness of the hills sharp stone fingers.\\" In short, it is Impressionism: from fragments of things, people and sounds author makes a portrait of the city. As Stepan assimilates in Kyiv, it changes his perception. Changing of the clothes accompanies his becoming a proletarian. At the beginning, secretary of the bureau advises Radchenko to change clothes: \\"All the Ukrainian woes are because of dressing badly.\\" Before the store with fashionable and expensive clothes Stepan still believes that it should only change his appearance and he can create something extraordinary. When he moves to a new house, Stepan burns his old clothes. During the novel one canobserve that Stephen rises the ladder of the city life. In Kyiv he becomes interested in literature, begins writing, and eventually, he becomes a famous writer. He was convinced that he went to conquer the city. Stepan thought the city needed \\"fresh blood of the village\\" that will change \\"its appearance and being. And he is one of the changes which must win.\\" However, gradually the thought of returning disappear. Pidmohylny does not have a goal to make a documentary description of the writer's medium. He shows the birth of the author, his successes and failures, his wanderings in different worlds of the novel. The last sentence of the novel ends at the instant when the story of Stepan Radchenko begins: \\"Then, in the silence of the lamp over the table he wrote a story about people.\\"  Characters  ‚Ä¢ Stepan Radchenko ‚Äì the protagonist ‚Ä¢ Nadia ‚Äì a girl from the village ‚Ä¢ Levko ‚Äì a student ‚Ä¢ Hanna and Nyusya ‚Äì Nadia‚Äôs friends ‚Ä¢ Luka Hnidy ‚Äì a shopkeeper, who rents out to Stepan ‚Ä¢ Tamara (Musinka) ‚Äì a shopkeeper's wife, Stepan‚Äôs mistress ‚Ä¢ Maxim ‚Äì a son of Tamara and shopkeeper ‚Ä¢ Boris ‚Äì a student, Stepan‚Äôs friend ‚Ä¢ Zoska ‚Äì a city girl, Stepan‚Äôs mistress ‚Ä¢ Rita ‚Äì a ballerina ‚Ä¢ Vyhorsky ‚Äì a poet, Stepan‚Äôs friend.

Mergers & Acquisitions Early 1990s: KCI detailed its operations into four divisions: KCI New Technologies, Inc. (Nutech‚Äîorganized in 1992 focused on lower-cost technologies), KCI Home Care (organized in 1995 focused on selling wholesale to home medical equipment providers), KCI Therapeutic Services, Inc. (KCTS‚Äîrented specialty beds to patients or to hospitals), and KCI International (KCII‚Äîorganized in 1991 focused on providing the services and products of KCI to foreign countries, including most of western Europe, Scandinavia, and Australia). 1990: KCI purchased Medirec for $26 million in cash and $10 million in KCI securities, forming KCI's Medical Services Division. KCI later sold KCI Medical Services in September 1994 for $65.3 million in cash and $18.8 million in promissory notes. 1991: KCI purchased Mediscus International, a British competitor in the specialty bed business. The transaction brought KCI products into 10 countries and formed the KCI International subsidiary. 1996: KCI purchased U.K.-based Astec Medical Ltd. The acquisition added four new products to KCI International's product line and allowed KCI to expand its market share in the U.K. community segment. 1997: KCI acquired the Ethos Medical Group. Later that year, Equitron Manufacturing was acquired, adding bariatric products to the Home Care offerings at KCI. 1998: KCI USA was formed as a result of the merger between KCI's New Technologies (NuTech) with KCI Therapeutic Services. The merger united the sales and marketing operations of the two divisions. 2008: KCI acquired LifeCell, a company specializing in regenerative medicine, in a non- hostile transaction for US$1.7 billion.KCI to Acquire LifeCell for $1.7 Billion in Cash Creating a Global Medical Technology Leader.

Before his election to the Arizona Supreme Court, he served as county attorney for both Coconino and Yavapai counties as well as a member of the Arizona Territorial Legislature. Following Arizona statehood, he served on the state's highest bench for 33 years and was selected Chief Justice on six occasions. Ross served the longest tenure in the court's history while his brother, John Wilson Ross, served the shortest.The Arizona Supreme Court: Its 2000-2001 Decisions, 34 Ariz. St. L.J. 369, 373 (2002) Biography Ross was born on September 12, 1861 to Emily (Terrell) and William Henry Ross in Berryville, Arkansas. He grew up on his family's farm while attending the nearby Clark's Academy. Ross attended the University of Iowa and graduated with a Bachelor of Laws in 1883. After graduation, Ross taught at a school in Arkansas before moving to Flagstaff, Arizona Territory in 1886. He continued to teach for another two years in Arizona. Among his students was future United States Senator Henry F. Ashurst. Admission to the bar led Ross to begin practicing law in Flagstaff and Prescott. He married Margaret Wheeler of El Paso, Texas on April 24, 1890. The marriage produced two sons, Henry David, Jr and John Wheeler. Ross joined the Prescott legal firm of Ross & O'Sullivan in 1894, a partnership he continued until his ascension to the bench. He was elected to a two-year term as Yavapai County attorney in 1888. At the end of his term, Ross became county attorney for the newly created Coconino county. He then represented Coconino County as a member of the House during the 17th Arizona Territorial Legislature. Following his term in the legislature, he became Register for Prescott's land office. He won election for two more terms as Yavapai County attorney, in 1896 and 1908. Promotion to the Arizona Supreme Court came to Ross on February 14, 1912. He won reelection to the post several times and held a seat on the court until his death. During his time on the court, Ross was noted for his work effort, averaging 50 decisions a year over a five-year period at a time when a justice of the Supreme Court of the United States averaged ten to twelve rulings a year. In January 1945, Ross informed friends that he intended to retire at the end of his final term in January 1947. Ross died on February 9, 1945 following a stroke. The stroke occurred 8 days prior to his death and Ross failed to recover consciousness in the intervening time. He was buried at Phoenix's Greenwood Memorial Park.

There are a handful of applications, specifically for mobile devices that utilize search by sound. Shazam (service), Soundhound (previously Midomi), Axwave, ACRCloud and others has seen considerable success by using a simple algorithm to match an acoustic fingerprint to a song in a library. These applications takes a sample clip of a song, or a user-generated melody and checks a music library/music database to see where the clip matches with the song. From there, song information will queried and displayed to the user. These kind of applications are mainly used for finding a song that the user does not already know. Searching by sound is not limited to just identifying songs, but also for identifying melodies, tunes or advertisements, sound library management and video files. Acoustic fingerprinting The way these apps search by sound is through generating an acoustic fingerprint; a digital summary of the sound. A microphone is used to pick up an audio sample, which is then broken down into a simple numeric signature, a code unique to each track. Using the same method of fingerprinting sounds, when Shazam picks up a sound clip, it will generate a signature for that clip. Then it‚Äôs simple pattern matching from there using an extensive audio music database. The practice of using acoustic fingerprints is not limited to just music, however, but other areas of the entertainment business as well. Shazam also can identify television shows with the same technique of acoustic fingerprinting. Of course, this method of breaking down a sound sample into a unique signature is useless unless there is an extensive database of music with keys to match with the samples. Shazam has over 11 million songs in its database. Other services such as Midomi and Soundhound allow users to add to that library of music in order to expand the chances to match a sound sample with its corresponding sound. Query by humming Midomi and Soundhound both offer query by humming. This is a branch off of acoustic fingerprints but is still a musical retrieval system. After receiving a user-generated hummed melody, which is the input query, the system returns a ranked list of songs that are closest to the user query.

The song is a pop ballad that makes use of a \\"baroque piano\\" over a \\"contemplative melody\\". Madonna co-wrote and co-produced the song with Avicii, Mike Dean and Kanye West; additional writers include Arash Pournouri, Salem Al Fakir, Magnus Lideh√§ll, Vincent Pontare and Tommy Brown, with Charlie Heat serving as a co-producer. An early demo of \\"Wash All Over Me\\", as well as the finalized track, both leaked onto the internet prior to the album's scheduled release. The actual version was made available on March 6, 2015, whilst its precedent mix was predominantly influenced by disco and house music before being reworked in the album cut. Lyrically, \\"Wash All Over Me\\" portrays Madonna addressing her insecurities and the release that follows, in addition to her questioning her career's longevity. The recording was generally well received by music critics, with the majority of them comparing it to the singer's previous work on Like a Prayer (1989), Ray of Light (1998) and Confessions on a Dance Floor (2005).  Background and release  When beginning recording sessions for her then- upcoming thirteenth studio album, Madonna enlisted a large team of songwriters and producers for the project. In mid 2014, she uploaded a photo to her Instagram account, which revealed her playing the guitar alongside Swedish electronic musician Avicii. During November 2014, a demo of the unfinished \\"Wash All Over Me\\" leaked onto the internet, resulting in Madonna taking to her Instagram account once again, where she described the situation as \\"terrorism\\" and a form of \\"artistic rape\\". The unintended leaks led the singer to release six completed tracks through iTunes as a pre-order for the album on December 20, 2014. Following this, Avicii was rumored to have produced twelve additional recordings that subsequently leaked. The demo version of \\"Wash All Over Me\\" was considerably different from the reworked version, with Robbie Daw of Idolator finding the leak to have a \\"disco/house vibe\\" with \\"the constant presence of an acoustic guitar\\". In the album's early development stages, Madonna played a handful of unfinished demos to Kanye West, who later agreed to work with the singer on several tracks, including \\"Wash All Over Me\\". Rebel Heart was leaked online in its entirety on February 3, 2015, more than a month in advance to its scheduled release. The final mix of \\"Wash All Over Me\\" was subsequently released with its parent record on March 6, 2015.  Recording and composition  \\"Wash All Over Me\\" was written by Madonna, Avicii, Arash Pournouri, Salem Al Fakir, Magnus Lideh√§ll, Vincent Pontare, Mike Dean, Kanye West and Tommy Brown, while being produced by Madonna, Avicii, Dean and West; furthermore, Charlie Heat serves as a co-producer. Dean further contributed to the drum programming, engineering, mixing, guitars and keyboards, while Demacio \\"Demo\\" Castellon provided the engineering and mixing. Pontare also recorded additional vocals for the track. The song is a ballad which according to Saeed Saeed of The National, features \\"baroque piano\\". The song has a thoughtful melody consisting of a melancholic structure. In regards to Avicii's contributions, Kitty Empire, writing for The Guardian, commented that he \\"play[s] Andrew Lloyd Webber to [Madonna's] Tim Rice\\". Lyrically, \\"Wash All Over Me\\" addresses \\"insecurity and the release that comes in admitting it\\". Jim Farber from New York Daily News opined that Madonna \\"ponders either running from, or accepting the end of, her career\\", whereas Adam R. Holz of Plugged In found Madonna \\"confront[ing] confusion, fear and change\\". Regarding the lyrics \\"I walk this razor's edge / Will I stand or will I fall?\\", Sasha Geffen of Consequence of Sound expressed that: \\"When the world that you made goes onto change without you, keeping up becomes a bigger and bigger risk. If you're Madonna, you take that risk no matter how likely you are to come out the other side without stumbling.\\" The track's second verse portrays Madonna singing: \\"Gonna watch the sun going down / I'm not gonna run from all this madness\\", where \\"she surveys her present condition but vows to keep on moving\\". The singer further makes a reference to the Tower of Babylon and calls attention to changes in the music industry: \\"In a world that's changing, I'm a stranger in a strange land / There's a contradiction and I'm stuck here in between\\". She later concludes that: \\"Life is like a desert, an oasis to confuse me\\".  Critical reception  \\"Wash All Over Me\\" was received positively by music critics. Amy Pettifer of The Quietus praised the track for \\"ha[ving] all the melancholy pleasure of 'The Power of Good-Bye'\\"; she later stated that \\"it's older, wiser and more accepting of endings\\". Sal Cinquemani, writing for Slant Magazine, noted that the song \\"return[s] to the lush, spiritual introspection of Ray of Light,\\" further called it \\"exquisite\\". Likewise, Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph agreed, stating it \\"recall[s] [...] rich depths\\". Geffen labeled it an \\"essential track\\" from Rebel Heart, writing that it \\"arrives like a vivid counterpoint to 'Living for Love'\\". Saeed Saeed of The National congratulated the singer for \\"another addition to [her] underrated collection of ballads\\", explaining that \\"this century has been unkind to Madonna, who has had her share of heartbreak.\\" Andy Gill, writing for The Independent, felt it was a \\"most welcome reminder\\" that \\"recall[s] the career-apex achievements of Like a Prayer\\". Jeff Nelson from People found that \\"Wash All Over Me\\" serves as a reminder that \\"she's still a person\\". Nelson went on stating that \\"it's tracks like the aforementioned 'Wash All Over Me' [...] that showcase the megastar's vulnerable, relatable side\\". Brad Stern, an editor and publisher for MuuMuse, commented that \\"Wash All Over Me\\" was \\"very Confessions-esque\\", further calling it \\"a truly curious concoction of sound\\". In response to a fan of the singer, Stern agreed that it was \\"fabulous and very emotional\\", and opined that \\"the lyrics are much more intriguing than, say, taking shots of Tanqueray like a girl gone wild.\\" Nouses Jack Elliott applauded \\"Wash All Over Me\\", describing it as \\"a lyrically powerful, yet vulnerable ending to the album that could be interpreted as a track celebrating triumph or defeat. It is up to you to interpret it as you wish.\\"  Credits and personnel  Credits and personnel adapted from Madonna's official website. =Management= * Webo Girl Publishing, Inc.

The North Branch Land Trust was established in 1993 and has grown from one conserved property a year to over 12,000 acres of conserved land. The watersheds affected by the NBLT are the Susquehanna River and Delaware River watersheds. North Branch has conserved privately owned farms and camps, and bought entire pieces of property. The mission of this conservation easement is to aim for the long- term management of natural resources by the conserving forests and woodlands and preserving the land for continuous use. North Branch works with landowners to sell the developing rights to the land. This will not only help with evening out the construction rate but also help the ecosystem and the watersheds in this area.  History  The North Branch Land Trust works to conserve the landscapes that sustain the earth through the landowners and their communities. The NBLT originated in 1993 when friends and neighbors wanted a way to protect their land from developers. In 1995, a couple looking to preserve their 43-acre farm near Shickshinny in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania became the first of many properties conserved by the North Branch Land Trust.  Mission  The North Branch Land Trust‚Äôs mission is to help landowners conserve their property and help communities establish smart growth strategies for the benefit of their citizens. NBLT aims for the long-term management of natural resources by the conserving and preserving forests and woodlands, watersheds and waterways, wildlife habitat, agricultural lands and open space in both rural and urban areas. The North Branch protects and enhances scenic natural beauty and cultural landmarks throughout the Back Mountain. The land owned by the NBLT is for public use at any time during the year. Anyone may use the trails and land at their leisure. The North Branch intends to preserve these lands for the use of the community and the protection of the land.  Conserved lands  Since the North Branch Land Trust has been conserving lands there has been a total of 53 properties and 10,831 acres, across eight counties in the Northeastern region of Pennsylvania conserved. That does not include the 1,250 acres that the North Branch owns completely. In these counties, countless properties have environmental treasures that are nearly extinct. Such as spring seeps, vernal pools, acidic shrub swamps, rare red spruce swamps, and an extremely rare glacial kettle bog. This all consumes one property, Bear Creek Camp in Luzerne County. There are other lands conserved with special and biologically significant features such as the Macialek property, and Kuryloski Woods. In 2010 NBLT conserved 3,000 acres in Luzerne County. This property, named after the fact that it was sold for only half it‚Äôs worth, Mocanaqua Tract was preserved to save the rare cranberry bog and orchids that grow on this property. Like most of the lands conserved by the NBLT this property also has a trail system that the public may use at any time.  Watershed  In the Northeastern part of Pennsylvania the watershed is the north branch of the Susquehanna River and the Delaware watershed. Some of the properties eventually end up in the Susquehanna River and the other in the Delaware River, which is one of the very reasons the North Branch Land Trust formed. The purpose of the Land Trust is to not only protect the land from being ruined by developers, but also protect the land and rivers downstream and throughout the rest of that side of the state. By protecting the land, the streams can stay free of pollution from humans and construction. The Bureau of Conservation and Restoration is a department through the state of Pennsylvania that aims to bring polluted streams and lakes off of the impaired waters list.

Chongqing ChangFeng Machinery LTD.CO designed the gun under China South Industries Group Corporation in June 2010. It is primarily targeted for international market and exportation.  Design Details  The pistol features a series of four different calibers, including 9√ó19mm Luger, .45 ACP, 7.62√ó25mm Tokarev and .40 S&W.; By changing the slide, barrel, and magazine, it can fire all the four available calibers. This concept can be seen in other designs such as Beretta Px4 Storm. The production variant of QX-04, named CS/LP6 first appeared in public during 8th China International Exhibition on Police Equipment in May 2011. QX-04 shares a similar structure with the QSZ-92 service pistol yet differs in some aspects. The gun uses a unique operating principle wherein by the barrel is fluted in an opposite twist of the rifling. This fluting causes the pistol when fired to exert opposite rotational force on the barrel therein by locking the front of the slide to the barrel until the fired round leaves the gun. The action of the QX-04 can be seen as similar to that of the Savage made 1907 Automatic Handgun. It is still unclear as of this time if the weapon is considered a delayed-blowback or a retarded blowback pistol.http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2014/11/17/chinese-qx-04-rifling- delayed-blowback-pistol/ References External links *http://modernfirearms.net/en/handguns/handguns-en/china-semi-automatic- pistols/qx4-eng/ Category:.40 S&W; semi-automatic pistols Category:.45 ACP semi-automatic pistols Category:7.62√ó25mm Tokarev semi-automatic pistols Category:9mm Parabellum semi-automatic pistols Category:Semi-automatic pistols of the People's Republic of China ","title":"QX-04"},{"id":"44579207","text":"MakerSquare was a provider of software engineering bootcamp based in Austin, TX, with additional campus locations in San Francisco, CA, Los Angeles, CA and New York, NY.

It occurs exclusively in North America, with the most concentrated outbreaks occurring in northern Arizona and southern Colorado on blue and Engelmann spruce, as well as in Alaska on black and white spruce.Peterson, Roger S. Effects of Broom Rusts on Spruce and Fir. Vol. 7. Ogden, Utah, Intermountain Forest & Range Experiment Station: Forest Service, U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, 1963. This disease alternates its life cycle between two hosts, with the spruce serving as the primary host and bearberry (also known as kinnickinnick) serving as the secondary or alternate host. The name for the disease comes from the distinctive ‚Äúwitches broom‚Äù, commonly yellow in color,Klingstr√∂m, A., and G. Lundeberg. \\"Control of Lophodermium and Phacidium needle cast and Scleroderris canker in Pinus silvestris.\\" European Journal of Forest Pathology 8.1 (1978): 20-25. which forms on the spruce after young needles have been infected. Management must be carried out through physical or mechanical methods, such as the pruning of brooms or the removal of the secondary host from the area, because no chemical control measures (e.g. fungicides) have yet been determined to be economically effective. Generally, spruce broom rust is seen as a mostly cosmetic issue, and it is very rarely the direct cause of tree death; however, research has shown a reduction in overall productivity and health of infected trees, making it an important issue for logging and timber companies.  Hosts  Since this pathogen is a heteroecious rust, C. arctostaphyli has a primary and an alternate host upon which it produces different fruiting structures and different spores unique to each structure. As implied in the disease name, spruce broom rust mainly affects four spruce species: white (Picea glauca), black (Picea mariana) Engelmann (Picea engelmannii) and Colorado blue (Picea pungens).Broom Rusts of Spruce and Fir. US Forest Service Dept. of Agriculture: Rocky Mountain Region. The alternate host is bearberry, which can be any of three species in the genus Arctostaphylos. This host is also sometimes referred to as kinnikinnick, which is the Native American name for common bearberry (Arctostaphylos uva-ursi), which is in the family Ericaceae. The plant is named for the red edible berries it produces, which are a favorite food of bears when they can get them. They follow a similar life cycle to spruce, as they are both evergreens.Cameron, Ward (2005). Mountain Nature Field Guide. There is also another far less common, yet still viable alternate host, manzanita (Arctostaphylos spp.).  Signs and symptoms  Spruce Broom Rust is named from the so-called ‚Äúwitches brooms‚Äù which form as a result of infected needles on the spruce host. The ‚Äúbrooms‚Äù are actually needles that were infected from basidiospores from the bearberry alternate host in spring. Twig tissue is typically infected as well, allowing hyphae to spread into an entire branch of needles. In midsummer, bright yellow pustules which make up the broom can be seen. These are actually aecia containing aeciospores for dispersal, making the broom a sign of disease. From afar, there will appear to be a yellowing broom erupting from a portion of a spruce tree.John Schwandt (2006). Management Guide for Spruce Broom Rust. USDA, US Forest Service Dept. of Agriculture. As summer progresses, the aecia (infected needles) will begin to turn brown. In terms of symptoms of spruce broom rust, twigs of the brooms themselves are typically shorter and thicker than normal. Another common symptom is the formation of a canker or gall at the base of the broom. The main damage from the rust is simply overall volume and growth loss. The number of brooms as well as their proximity to the main stem can also play a role in determining the extent of the damage to the tree.  Disease Cycle  Chrysomyxa arctostaphyli is an obligate parasite, and as with most other rust fungi diseases, spruce broom rust requires two different host plants to carry out its life cycle and is therefore referred to as heteroecious.Ziller, Wolf G. \\"Studies of western tree rusts. VIII. Inoculation experiments with conifer needle rusts (Melampsoraceae).\\" Canadian Journal of Botany 48.8 (1970): 1471-1476. The primary or aecial host of the rust is spruce (Picea spp.), and the secondary or telia host of the rust is bearberry (Arctostaphylos uva- ursi).Ferguson, Brennan A. \\"Broom Rusts.\\" Idaho.gov/forestry. Idaho Department of Lands, Sept. 2014. Web. 11 Nov. 2014. The alternative bearberry host is necessary for aeciospore germination,Krebill, G. (1969). Germination of Aeciospores of Chrysomyxa Arctostaphyli. Phytopathology, Vol. 59, No. 1 (Jan. 1969), pp. 13. and is therefore essential for the rust's lifecycle. Spruce broom rust is a macrocyclic rust, meaning that the fungus produces more spore types in addition to teliospores and basidiospores.Agrios, George. (Dec. 2004). Plant Pathology. 5th Edition, pp. 564-565. In midsummer, aecia appear on the epidermis of spruce needles as orange pustules.\\"Spruce Broom Rust.\\" Yukon Forest Health. Yukon Energy, Mines and Resources Forest Management Branch, Government of Yukon. Web. 11 Nov. 2014. Eventually, these aecia rupture and release millions of microscopic, orange aeciospores, which are carried to bearberry by wind. These aeciospores are capable of infecting bearberry leaves; however, they are not able to reinfect spruce.Forest Service Leaflet. \\"Spruce Broom Rust.\\" Region 10 - State. USDA Forest Service, Aug. 2001. Web. 11 Nov. 2014. Assuming favorable, moist environmental conditions upon the secondary host, these aeciospores germinate and the bearberry's leaves develop dark purple-brown blotches. Come springtime, these blotches develop waxy telia on the bottom of the leaves and pierce the bearberry's epidermis. Teliospores are produced by these telia and germinate to become basidiospores, which infect the primary spruce host when wind carries them to young, developing needles. This infection in the spruce is systemicWood, A. R. \\"Infection of Chrysanthemoides monilifera ssp. monilifera by the rust fungus Endophyllum osteospermi is associated with a reduction in vegetative growth and reproduction.\\" Australasian Plant Pathology 31.4 (2002): 409-415. and perennial, allowing the fungus to live in the brooms from year to year. Upon infection of the developing spruce needles, basidiospores produce haploid mycelia that form spermatia. These spermatia do not infect either host; rather, they serve as male gametes and fertilize receptive hyphae, forming dikaryotic mycelium and in turn dikaryotic aeciospores. From here the disease cycle repeats, and symptoms similar to last season arise on the spruce by midsummer. A feature unique to the Chrysomyxa arctostaphyli disease cycle is the fact that the fungus does not produce urediospores, and thus spruce broom rust is not a truly macrocyclic disease. The lack of urediospores prevents reinfection of the primary host within the same year.  Environment  The intense odor given off from the spermogonia on the needles in the spring attract insects, which cross-fertilize the fungus. This fertilization allows for aecia to form and in turn produce aeciospores. Spruce broom rust is common in the western United States, specifically in the Rocky Mountain Region where it occurs on Colorado blue spruce, and in the boreal forests of Alaska and Canada where it parsitizes both white and black spruce. It was originally thought there was not a connection between bearberry and spruce as hosts, as bearberry had not been documented at such of altitudes of spruce in the Rocky Mountains; it was even initially postulated that the spores found on bearberry were caused by a microcyclic rust which only infected that host and did not have an alternate.Peterson, R. S. (1961). Notes on Western Rust Fungi I. Chrysomyxa. Mycologia, Vol. 53, No. 4 (Jul.-Aug., 1961), pp. 427-431. https://www.jstor.org/stable/3756585 However, it was eventually discovered that bearberry could be located in similar altitudes to spruce, and C. arctostaphyli was even found in bearberry at those altitudes. It was then experimentally proved that when bearberry were inoculated in a moist chamber with aeciospores from spruce brooms, telia would begin to form.  Management  In general, spruce broom rust in considered more of a cosmetic issue, and in many cases no serious management measures are required.\\"Spruce Needle Rust.\\" : Yard and Garden : Garden : University of Minnesota Extension. University of Minnesota Extension. Web. 11 Nov. 2014. However, potential economic consequences can be seen in commercial logging areas. In order to manage this, trees with stem cankers or brooms are selectively removed or the brooms are pruned off of the trees. Pruning of brooms is the most effective and economical control option while still reducing the risk of stem breakage and maintaining tree vigor.\\"Broom Rusts of Spruce and Fir.\\" Forest Health Protection-Rocky Mountain Region. United States Department of Agriculture, 2011. Web. 11 Nov. 2014. If the infection occurs on the tree's main bole, the entire top must be removed, including the brooms. Additionally, since both bearberry and spruce must be in the same area for Chrysomyxa arctostaphyli to survive and complete its life cycle, there is the option to remove all bearberry within 1,000 feet of the spruce. Although effective, this route is often hard to accomplish and expensive. A related control measure would be to attempt to reduce moisture around the bearberry in order to prevent secondary infection, but the logistics of this would also be challenging. No chemical measures like fungicides have been found to be effective as of yet,\\"Spruce Broom Rust (Chrysomyxa Arcostaphyli).\\" Plantwise Knowledge Bank. Plantwise. Web. 11 Nov. 2014. so only the mechanical option of physically removing the brooms to prevent the spread of aeciospores is effective. Since spruce broom rust is mostly cosmetic, infections can potentially be left on the tree to provide habitat for birds and small mammals, which use the large, dense brooms for both resting and nesting.  Importance  Spruce broom rust is an interesting pathogen in terms of its importance in forest management programs. Many spruce trees do not exhibit any symptoms of disease upon infection by Chrysomyxa arctostaphyli, and still many others display effects of a merely cosmetic nature. Besides obviously impacting visual quality, spruce broom rust can also have major, more economically important impacts on timber productivity. Nutrients that were originally sequestered for growth in spruce are redirected to the brooms, which can lead to a reduction in height and radial tree growth. For example, a 1963 US Forest Service study found that trees infected by Chrysomyxa arctostaphyli showed a 30 percent reduction in growth over the course of ten years as compared to healthy trees.Peterson, Roger S. \\"Effects of broom rusts on Spruce and Fir.\\" Research Papers. US Forest Serv. (1963). The extent of this damage depends on the number and size of brooms, as well as their location.Schwandt, John. \\"Management Guide for Spruce Broom Rust.\\" Forest Health Protection and State Forestry Organizations. United States Forest Service, Jan. 2006. Web. 11 Nov. 2014. When brooms occur upon the primary bole of the spruce, this can lead to a phenomenon known as top kill, in which the portion of the spruce above the brooms dies. As the infection continues to grow and more sections of the tree die, new entrance ways open up for wood decaying fungi, such as red ring rot (Phellinus pini).Paragi, Thomas F. \\"Density and Size of Snags, Tree Cavities, and Spruce Rust Brooms in Alaska Boreal Forest.\\" Western Journal of Applied Forestry 25.2 (2010): 88-95. These fungi are capable of devastating the volume of usable wood obtained from spruce trees, and in turn greatly reducing the trees‚Äô marketable value, because they are highly specialized in removing the wood's structural compounds. Additionally, this internal wood decay causes spruce trees to become structurally unstable, posing relevant hazards in residential and recreational areas. Finally, although tree death is not common in infected trees, Chrysomyxa arctostaphyli may weaken the spruce and cause it to become highly vulnerable to other potential killers such as other fungi, bark beetles, or simply by increasing the tree's susceptibility to intense wind, water, and snow. The same 1963 US Forest Service study found that infected trees had a three times greater mortality rate over a ten-year period than healthy trees. Nevertheless, Chrysomyxa arctostaphyli may indeed play an ecologically vital role in the Yukon. Oftentimes squirrels, fishers, and other forest animals utilize cavities within brooms, especially those carved out by other wood decaying fungi, as sources of shelter and dens.Weir, Richard D., and Pedro Lara Almuedo. \\"British Columbia's Interior: Fisher Wildlife Habitat Decision Aid.\\" Journal of Ecosystems and Management 10.3 (2010).

As of November 2017 purple.com no longer displays its older content of a plain purple background, but now serves as a website for Purple Mattress.  Content  The most noticeable feature of the site was the main page with a purple-colored background. The site later added subpages, including FAQs, a notification about abuse and spam, a guideline about linking the site, and guidelines on availability.  History  According to the creator, software engineer Jeff Abrahamson, the site originated from the difficult process of accessing and surfing the internet in its early days, similar to most early single-serving sites. Over the years from 1994 through 2017, when Abrahamson sold the site, he used it for many purposes: novel, personal, and commercial, as stated above. The site was launched on 31 August 1994. From its launch to late 2006 the background colour was #DD00FF, resulting in numerous complaints that it was not actually purple. It was changed to #7D26CD on 6 November 2006 based on recommendations. In November 2017, the domain name was sold to Purple, Inc. for approximately $900k. As of June 2020, Abrahamson has hosted a similarly minimal website as a memorial, ISoldPurple.com.  Impact  Some sites have been created as parodies of the site. Some of the most well known, both created in 2007 are SometimesRedSometimesBlue.com, created by Damon Zucconi which alternates between a red and blue background and LetsTurnThisFuckingWebsiteYellow.com, a site which consists of a yellow background created by Charles Broskoski. Randomcolour.com and notpurple.com are websites that generate a different background colour (chosen at random) when visited. The home page's minimal data size, obvious visual appearance, and unlikelihood of being already cached on a user's browser made it a go-to page for IT support workers to verifying internet connectivity or forcing a redirect to a public internet login page. In January 2018, theoldpurple.com was created as an homage to and replacement for the original, single-page Purple website.

Introduction Batai virus (BATV) is an enveloped, single-stranded, negative sense RNA genome.Plyusnin, A. (2011). Bunyaviridae: Molecular and cellular biology. Norfolk, UK: Caister Academic Press. It is a member of the genus Orthobunyavirus and belongs to the order Bunyavirales; it was first isolated from Culex mosquitoes in Malaysia in 1955. Evidence from serological surveillance and virus isolation shows that this virus is widely distributed around the world. Similar to other orthobunyaviruses it contributes to both human and animal disease. In humans it has been noted in causing severe fever, and in bovines has been associated with premature birth, birth defects, and increased abortion rates. It is transmitted through mosquito bites, ticks, and biting midges, and occurs from cold to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Europe. Structure The structure of Batai virus (BATV) consists of an enveloped nucleocapsid that is composed of three RNA segments: small (S), medium (M), and large (L). The S segment encodes the nucleocapsid (N) and the non-structural (NSs) proteins. The M segment encodes the virion surface glycoproteins (Gn, Gc) and non-structural proteins (NSm). The L segment encodes for the replicase/ transcriptase L protein. The nonstructural proteins NSm participate in virus assembly and NSs plays a key role in counteracting the host immune response by blocking alpha/beta interferon induction The full-length genome of NM/12 consists of a 947 base pair nucleotide S segment, a 4405 base pair nucleotide M segment, and a 6870 base pair nucleotide L segment. It also contains one open reading frame that encode three proteins of 151, 943, or 1395 amino acids. Viral enveloped nucleocapsids utilize membrane glycoproteins on their surface to mediate entry into host cells. Averaging of glycoprotein spikes of membrane viruses, such as HIV-1, has been a particularly successful approach for studying their structure. An understanding of the structure is integral for revealing both the molecular basis of virus‚Äìhost interactions and guiding antiviral and vaccine design development. A software named Jsubtomo enables visualization of the structure of viral glycoprotein spikes to a resolution in the range of 20-40 √Ö and allows for study of the study of higher order spike-to-spike interactions on the virion membrane. Extensive research has yet to be performed on the detailed crystalline structure of Batai virus, but research on the closely related Bunyamwera virus has shown a distinct functionality of each of the two nucleocapsid side chains. An N-terminal arm and a C-terminal tail were found to interact with neighboring NP protomers to form a tetrameric ring-shaped organization. Each protomer bound a 10-nucleotide RNA molecule, which was acquired from the expression host, in the positively charged crevice between the N and C lobes. Cryo-electron microscopy has also determined that whilst Bunyamwera virions are pleomorphic in shape, they display a locally ordered lattice of glycoprotein spikes. Each spike protrudes 18 nanometers from the viral membrane and becomes disordered upon introduction to an acidic environment. Although the exact icosahedral symmetry of a Batai virus viron is yet to be determined, studies using Cryo-electron tomography on related viruses of the Bunyaviridae family have shown that there exists an icosahedral lattice with clear T=12 quasisymmetry. Consequently, this triangulation number would correlate with a viral nuclear capsid exhibiting 720 faces. This study was performed on the Rift Valley Fever Virus (RVFV), which is an arthropod borne disease that is endemic to regions of Africa and Asia, namely the Rift Valley in Kenya from which its name is derived. Viral Classification and Genome Batai virus is a member of the genus Orthobunyavirus and a member of the family Bunyaviridae. Batai virus is part of a diverse group of arthropod- borne viruses. Classified via the Baltimore scheme, Batai virus is a negative- sense, single-stranded RNA virus. The orthobunyavirus genome has a characteristic segmented genome, with small, medium, and large (S, M, and L) segments which generally encode the nucleocapsid, envelope protein and the polymerase protein, respectively. The size of the S segment is 943 nucleotides, the size of the M segment is 4440 nucleotides, and the size of the L segment is 6870 nucleotides. In the S segment there are two open reading frames (ORFs), the nucleocapsid and non-structurals which were overlapping. The M segment has a polyprotein precursor in the open reading frame. The L segment encodes for an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Batai virus is geographically spread throughout Asia and Europe. It has been shown that batai viruses from Japan, Malaysia and India share homologies in the genomic sequence more so than when virus strains from Europe and Asia are compared to each other. Reassortment of the genome can have some serious effects. It has been observed that reassortment between the M segment and the S and L segments with another strain of Batai virus (BUNV) can cause an increase in the virulence of Batai virus. Reassortment of the genome within the genus Orthobunyavirus are not uncommon and can lead to an increase in virulence. Replication of Batai Virus It is well known that the geographical distribution of Batai virus (BATV) includes the regions of Europe, Asia and Africa. The most common vertebrate affected by BATV are domestic pigs, horses, ruminants and wild birds, which have been known to be the primary mammalian hosts. The transmission cycle of BATV occurs in agricultural ecosystems via Anopheles, Culex and Ochlerotatus species mosquitoes in a typical vertebrate‚Äìmosquito cycle. While limited research has been conducted on the viral cycle of the Batai virus, comparable studies with the close relative Bunyamwera virus has shown that viral infection begins in the salivary glands of mosquitos.Yanase, T., Kato, T., Yamakawa, M., Takayoshi, K., Nakamura, K., Kokuba, T. & Tsuda, T. (2006). At the onset of replication the virus particles coalesce into vacuole membranes lining the cytoplasm of the infected cells. Entry into the cell is facilitated by the viral enveloped nucleocapsid, which contains glycoproteins G1 and G2. Encoded by the M RNA segment they are involved in attachment to the host cell through unidentified receptors on the surface and elicit neutralizing antibodies. Transcription of BATV is said to be similar to that of influenza in that mRNA synthesis is primed by cap- containing oligonucleotides that are generated by a certain viral- endonuclease, functioning to cleave the host cell mRNA. These resulting primers are then incorporated into the viral mRNA.Elliott, R. M. \\"Emerging Viruses: The Bunyaviridae.\\" Molecular Medicine 3.9 (1997): 572‚Äì577 BATV will also encode for two non-structural proteins, NSm on the M segment and NSs on the S segment. During the process it is believed that NSm actively participates in assembly of the virus. These newly assembled viral particles will mature over a period of time inside of the hosts cell in the membranes of the Golgi apparatus before being released. However, while able to replicate in both vertebrate and invertebrate species, in mosquito cells no cell death is observed and persistent infection is established. Whereas in mammalian cells infection is typically categorized as lytic and eventually leads to cell death. This stems from the viruses ability to form clear lytic plaques in cells of vertebrate species but not in those derived from insects. It has been demonstrated in previous studies that in mammalian cells, the NSs protein will induce a shut-off of host protein synthesis which will lead to the death of the host cell. It has also been shown to counteract the host cell antiviral response.Weber F, Elliott RM, Brasier A, Garcia-Sastre A, Lemon S, editors. Bunyaviruses and innate immunity. In: Cellular signaling and innate immune responses to RNA virus infections. (2009) Washington, DC: ASM Press. pp. 287‚Äì299. This would establish it as the main virulence factor as it acts during the transcriptional phase by inhibiting RNA polymerase II‚Äìmediated transcription. Meanwhile, the mosquito cells neither host cell transcription nor translation are inhibited by this fact. It would seem the difference in the behavior of the NSs protein could be one of the factors responsible for the different outcomes of infection attributed to the Batai virus in mammalian and mosquito cells. Some have theorized that a release method that does not rupture the cell membrane could explain why viral replication does not kill mosquito cells and persistence is maintained. Similar NSs proteins of the Rift Valley fever phlebovirus have quite a distinct size and amino acid sequence, but they play a similar role in mammalian cells in overcoming the innate immune responses that are a consequence of the global shut-down of the cells transcription mechanisms.

Associated Diseases Batai virus (BATV) is a member of the family Bunyaviridae. Associated viruses include Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Bunyamwera orthobunyavirus, and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome. Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is one of the viruses that is associated with Batai virus, as it is in the same family Bunyaviridae. This occurs in the same areas throughout the world including Africa, Asia, Europe. It mainly infects farmworkers in these regions of the world, and is a tick- borne illness. Infection results in high fever, chills, severe headache, dizziness, back, and abdominal pains. Other symptoms that have been noted include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and cardiovascular and neuropsychiatric changes. If severe symptoms may include hemorrhages in the skin, causing lesions or bruising. It has a 30% fatality rate. A closely associated disease is the Bunyamwera virus, which is of the same family and genus as the Batai virus (BATV); it is known to cause Bunyamwera fever. This particular virus is spread by mosquitos biting infected mice and then biting humans.Mosby, I. (2009). Mosby's dictionary of medicine, nursing & health professions (8th ed.). St. Louis, Mo.: Mosby/Elsevier. Batai virus (BATV) is also associated with severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS). This was a recently discovered in China in 2011 and is transmitted either directly to humans through ticks, or to house pets as an intermediate host and then on to humans. Symptoms are characterized by fever, vomiting, diarrhea, thrombocytopenia and leukopenia. SFTS virus has a 6-30% fatality rate.

This was the game's first foray into television; however, there have been multiple animated shorts and commercials before on channels including the Disney Channel. The special first aired on the Disney Channel on December 18, 2014. Plot Captain Rockhopper sails the seven seas on the Migrator with his pet puffle Yarr. He looks towards the camera, breaking the fourth wall, and acknowledges that the viewer has missed the events of what has occurred before. Rockhopper says that he has a copy from the Internet for the viewer to watch; and so, he takes out a mobile device. As the camera focuses in on its screen, the story begins. The scene shifts to Club Penguin Island on Merry Walrus Eve, where penguins are seen preparing for the annual, beloved holiday known as Merry Walrus. In the middle of all of this, Herbert P. Bear, dressed in a sailor suit, witnesses the seasonal decorating from his submarine and tells his accomplice Klutzy that he plans to ruin the holiday for everyone. Later, Roofhowse, a new arrival to Club Penguin, has found his place on the island and poorly settles his igloo. Two penguins named Blizzard and Sydmull arrive and throw a football at Roofhowse, which he fails to catch. Due to this, they nickname him Fumbles. The two show Roofhowse their igloo, which has a tall beacon on top that requires sunglasses to look at. Impressed, Roofhowse shows them his igloo, which lights on fire and burns to the ground when he turns on the lights. Jangrah, president of the Igloo Owners Association, arrives to tell everyone about her upcoming Merry Walrus play. She has Blizzard sign to play the role of Merry Walrus with permission from Sydmull, who is revealed to be Blizzard's \\"lawyer\\". Jangrah then welcomes Roofhowse to Club Penguin Island, handing him a fruit basket. She explains that on Club Penguin, everybody is friends with each other. After everyone else has left, their friend Lorna appears in front of Roofhowse and tells him about a prophecy; that a stranger would save Merry Walrus from annihilation. She also tells him that she had a dream about waffles, then leaves. With that, Roofhowse's fruit basket catches on fire, and he frowns. Jangrah's play is about to begin. The show starts with Lorna narrating, but a few things go wrong; Blizzard forgets his lines, and Sydmull neglects to control the Blue Crystal Puffle puppets in order to build a model of the digestive tract. The group gets a lot of coins for their performance. Meanwhile, Roofhowse attempts to leave the island, believing that he does not belong with the \\"igloo life\\". A Blue Crystal Puffle comes out of nowhere and gets in his way. Roofhowse trips on his backpack, and both are caught in a giant snowball rolling down the hill, which crashes right into the site of the play. Roofhowse shows his new friends the mythical puffle, and Lorna translates its noises, stating that Merry Walrus needs their help. Everyone chases the puffle to the shoreline of the Beach, wondering how to follow it. Roofhowse sets sail on his boat, leaving the group behind. Rockhopper arrives on the Migrator, and lets the rest aboard. They pick up Roofhowse along the way. Rockhopper tells all five penguins that they need to go to Merry Walrus Island; the home of Merry Walrus. Following the Blue Crystal Puffle, they head there, eventually making it through the Crystal Curtain that blocks trespassers from entering the island. After opening the door to Merry Walrus' large ice palace, they recognize a familiar shape: Herbert, disguised as Merry Walrus. Klutzy cuts a rope, which drops a large net on the group of penguins. The group, now tied up, stand before Herbert, who has now \\"a captive audience\\" to explain his evil plan to, as poor Klutzy has already heard it 20 times. As a screen drops in, the remote control seems to be stuck, so Sydmull helps Herbert by repairing the control. Herbert begins to explain his plan: #Capture the Blue Crystal Puffles. #Breach the Crystal Curtain using the puffles. #Imprison Merry Walrus. #Impersonating Merry Walrus, drop a series of \\"presents\\", which create a sound-proof ice dome (the Snow Globe of Silence) over the penguin crowd. As Herbert claims his plan will bring him his awaited peace and quiet, the group is more interested in Sydmull leveling up on a video game. Herbert then activates one of his machines, which takes Jangrah and wraps her up like a present. He then takes two icicles (to simulate a walrus' tusks) and parts with the sleigh, leaving the six penguins to be wrapped up. As Rockhopper and Roofhowse are about to be wrapped up, the Blue Crystal Puffle they met tries to help them escape, only to activate the machine's malfunctioning system. This causes the system to go completely crazy and puts both Roofhowse and Rockhopper in even bigger perils. Finally, the puffle manages to shut down the machine, just in time as one of the machine's scissors cut Rockhopper free. As Rockhopper and Roofhowse set the other penguins free, the group discovers that one of the gifts is moving, and when they open it, they find none other than Merry Walrus. Merry Walrus is happy to see Enrique, the Blue Crystal Puffle who had helped the group all along; a member of his sleigh team. Lorna comments on how they still have to stop Herbert, and Jangrah says that they must board the Migrator. Unfortunately, the ship is far too slow, and the only way to catch Herbert in time would be using another sleigh. Fortunately, Merry Walrus has one, so Roofhowse and the gang board the sleigh and go to stop Herbert, as Rockhopper tails them from very behind. The scene cuts to Club Penguin Island, where Cadence is hosting the Merry Walrus Party. As the party begins, they notice the sleigh coming in, which is in fact the one with Herbert. As Klutzy takes control of the sleigh, Herbert starts dropping the \\"presents\\" to the island, one of them falling on top of a Merry Walrus cake (which took two weeks to prepare). As Herbert prepares to drop the last \\"present\\", the group shows up, only to realize the \\"present\\" is already falling. Roofhowse manages to catch the present, but he almost trips and drops it. The rest try to take Roofhowse back to safety, when Herbert drops in their sleigh. Assuming nobody will stop him, Merry Walrus gives him a present (and a slight push) and pushes him off the sleigh. Herbert crashes in the middle of the \\"presents\\" ring. Meanwhile, Roofhowse accidentally drops the final one, which causes the Snow Globe of Silence to activate, trapping Herbert inside. As our team cheers for their success, they start delivering the presents all across the island. As Cadence plays a song, we see Herbert inside the ice dome, clamoring for peace and quiet; this does not last long. Herbert remembers his Merry Walrus present, and to his surprise, it's a pair of sound-cancelling earmuffs. We cut to Roofhowse, who thanks Enrique and gives him a pirate hat as a token of appreciation. Rockhopper pops in the scene, bringing the coin bucket as a donation for Coins for Change (as his accountant reminded him he had to pay taxes if he kept the money). He offers Roofhowse to join him as a pirate, but he refuses, as his new friends represent his next great adventure. This pleases Rockhopper, as he sold Roofhowse's boat for scrap. This does not bother the hero, as he joins his friends in the dance floor. Lorna reminds Roofhowse that the prophecy has been fulfilled. Back in the present, Rockhopper, who has just finished telling the story, reminds the viewer that there is a lesson to be learned, but quickly explains that lessons are for \\"scurvy dogs\\". Merry Walrus is then seen atop the Crow's Nest, and the Migrator, being pulled by the Blue Crystal Puffles, hovers up and flies away towards the screen.

Bosshard was one of a number of European-trained jewellers who came to New Zealand in the 1960s and transformed contemporary jewellery in the country; others include Jens Hoyer Hansen, Tanya Ashken and Gunter Taemmler. Training in Switzerland Bosshard undertook a five-year apprenticeship in Zurich with jewellery designer and craftsman Meinrad Burch-Korrodi, and studied at the Zurich School of Applied Arts. Career in New Zealand Bosshard moved to New Zealand in 1961. He worked briefly in a Wellington jewellery shop owned by a fellow Swiss jeweller after arriving in New Zealand, but found the work being done in the shop conservative and left after a brief time. He became a mountain guide, then returned to full-time jewellery making in 1966. Art historian Peter Cape wrote in a 1969 survey of craft in New Zealand: > Kobi Bosshard has exhibited in a number of exhibition throughout New > Zealand, and sells his work regularly through craft and jewellers' shops. He > feels that, as a craft jeweller, he has considerable advantage over > commercial jewellers, in that he is independent, and can design and work > where and when he pleases, developing and following out his own idea, > without the pressures of a mass market. In 1970 Bosshard's work was included in Silver, Gold, Greenstone at New Vision Gallery in Auckland, the first substantial exhibition of contemporary jewellery in New Zealand. In 1972 he was included in Craft 72, an exhibition of New Zealand potters, weavers, wood-turners and jewellers organised by the Queen Elizabeth II Arts Council and toured overseas through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In a 1985 interview Bosshard described his preference for using a limited number of machines in his jewellery making and avoiding pre- cut metals: 'If you buy pieces of silver cut to standard thicknesses, you are tempted to stay with those measurements. It's better to have fewer skills and be master of those than to have many techniques and end up working to formula'. In the same interview he said: > I have to make a piece of jewellery before I know what it looks like. My > hands and material know what they are doing: the jewellery has to feel right > or it's not successful. I try not to let my mind get in the way. I don't > want to end up thinking I am smart and clever and using tricks. In 1985‚Äì86 a retrospective exhibition of Bosshard's work was organised by the Manawatu Art Gallery and toured to the Auckland War Memorial Museum, the Sarjeant Art Gallery and the Dunedin Public Art Gallery. Reviewing the exhibition Douglas Standring wrote 'Kobi Bosshard has long been regarded as one of our best jewellery-makers, but this exhibition at the Manawatu Art Gallery confirms his position amongst the still small group of local craftsmen and women who are making more than craft'. Standring went on to describe the formal qualities of Bosshard's work ('each piece of jewellery is a highly focused design and this accounts for the austere, classical strain in his work') and note a new boldness in recent work: > A new set of brooches particularly display a bolder stroke ‚Äî making, mixing > an urban visual zap with Bosshard's habitual coolness. The key piece here is > an experiment with free form and a larger scale: a lineal strip of silver is > bent into a striking electric signature. The usual conventions of jewellery > (solidity, the concealment of clasps and pins, the focus on the materials) > are inverted: space becomes the dominant feature, and the lines which define > themselves in that space. Thus the brooch pin is liberated from its usual > role as practical appendage and becomes simply another line in space; an > integral part of the design. As a teacher Bosshard has also played an important role as a teacher of younger jewellers, including Peter McKay, Vicki Mason and Lisa Walker. Vicki Mason says: > My love of metal came from him and Fluxus as at art school I‚Äôd majored in > 'hard media' (stone, wood, bone, glass, plastic etc) as opposed to metal. > This is a love affair that I can‚Äôt let go of. He imbued me with a sense of > the history of working with metal. Fluxus In September 1983 Bosshard established Fluxus Contemporary Jewellery, a jewellery workshop and gallery, with Steve Mulqueen in Dunedin; they were shortly joined by jeweller Georg Beer. Martha Moseth, writing in Craft New Zealand in 1985, stated > When goldsmiths Kobi Bosshard and Stephen Mulqueen opened Fluxus in > September 1983 they were prepared for a few risks including a slow start and > indeterminate debt. They have been surprised at the Gallery's success. On a > 'bad' afternoon there are at least five potential customers and on a good > day, thirty to forty. In its first eight months the Gallery has totalled > over 200 sales and the future looks good. The launch of Fluxus was motivated by 'frustration with limited access to customers and a faith in the future of contemporary jewellery'. The name 'Fluxus' was chosen 'for two reasons: for its reference to the 'flowing' agent, like Borax, that goldsmiths use and for the idea of flux, or change, which is part of the Gallery's philosophy of adapting to the needs of the artists and the community'. The gallery was modelled on Auckland's Fingers, functioning as a cooperative. In addition to the jewellers selling their own work a production line of jewellery was made and sold under the Fluxus name. Curatorial roles Bosshard was a member of the selection panel for the influential 1988 Bone Stone Shell exhibition of contemporary New Zealand jewellery. In 1996 he curated the second New Zealand Jewellery Biennial, titled Same But Different, at The Dowse Art Museum. The exhibition had two key themes: 'that contemporary jewellery should remember the needs of the wearer; and that production jewellery was an honourable and important part of contemporary jewellery'. Recognitions In 2012 Bosshard was recognised as a Master of Craft by Objectspace, an honour accompanied by a major touring retrospective exhibition and publication. 2017 documentary 'Kobi' A documentary about Bosshard's life and work, 'Kobi', will premiere at the 2017 New Zealand International Film Festival in July 2017. The film is produced by Torchlight Films and directed by Bosshard's daughter, film maker Andrea Bosshard. Collections Bosshard's work is held in the Auckland War Memorial Museum, the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa and The Dowse Art Museum.

The plot follows President William Howard Taft, scientist Robert Todd Lincoln (Abraham Lincoln's son), Secret Service Chief John Wilkie, Captain (later Major) Archibald Butt, and others as they slowly unravel a worldwide conspiracy over a decade in the making. The book, which was della Quercia's debut novel, was published in 2014 by St. Martin's Griffin, an imprint of St. Martin's Press. The author described the book as not fitting into a single distinct genre, but as an \\"equal parts cocktail\\" of adventure, historical fiction, science fiction, thriller and comedy.http://www.pocketwatchconspiracy.com/ In 2015, della Quercia released a spiritual sequel, License to Quill, of a similar nature that concerns the lives of Christopher Marlowe and William Shakespeare in Reformation-era Europe. The book contains many references to actual events; some, such as the sinking of the RMS Titanic, are important plot points, while others, such as the destruction of the zeppelin Erbsl√∂h, are passively mentioned as news stories or memories. The author also includes excerpts from real newspaper articles, which are used to provide exposition. Similarly, all of the main characters in the book were real, relevant figures in the early 20th century; the characters' profiles were fictionalized to fit in with the book's plot and atmosphere, but their names, positions, occupations and personalities are kept largely intact. Plot In 1910, Robert Todd Lincoln, an esteemed scientist, the only living son of former US President Abraham Lincoln, and a close friend of incumbent President William Howard Taft, reveals to the President that he has found an old pocket watch that belonged to his father. Lincoln explains that he can find no records of his father ever acquiring or owning the watch (though the watch fob was found on Abraham's person the night of his assassination), and although the watch has been running for a very long time, there is no inbuilt way to open or adjust it, and it has no discernible power source, save for a small cylinder of an unknown material. Furthermore, the watch bears a Russian inscription that translates to \\"Made in America\\", suggesting that the watch came from Russian America. Lincoln believes that the watch is so technologically advanced that it could not possibly have been built by humans, leading him to theorize that extraterrestrial beings are beginning to populate Alaska. Lincoln requests to use Taft's secret government zeppelin, Airship One, to travel to Alaska and test his hypothesis, which Taft gladly allows. Meanwhile, while conversing with Nikola Tesla over a wireless telegraph, Airship One intercepts a mysterious exchange between five anonymous \\"gentlemen\\". The men are mining an unknown substance, which they will begin shipping around the world in approximately one year, and imply that they have just carried out a mass murder and that they are maintaining unknown operations in Belfast. After the transmission, Tesla is almost assassinated as part of the mass murder, but he kills the assassin with one of his inventions. Once Taft, Lincoln, Hammond and Captain Archibald Butt, Airship One's pilot and Taft's closest friend, board Airship One to travel to Alaska, they hold a meeting in which they discuss recent events. They deduce that the automaton must have been programmed to kill Taft, as it repeatedly targeted Taft specifically. Lincoln reveals that on the same day that gas from Halley's Comet had been predicted to destroy all life on Earth, a mysterious deep blue light was seen in the night sky over the Wrangell Mountains in Alaska. This reinforces Lincoln's belief in extraterrestrial activity. Hammond, who has worked as the Guggenheims' chief mining engineer, tells the group that miners in the Wrangell Mines (the mines mentioned by the five \\"gentlemen\\") were constantly pressured to dig deeper and deeper, and that he believes that business moguls J. P. Morgan and Benjamin Guggenheim, who jointly owned and administered the mines, were secretly mining for a secret, unknown material. He remembers that what caused him to quit was suspicion that Morgan and Guggenheim were secretly working with the late Belgian King Leopold II, who was notorious for oppressing the natives of the Congo Free State. The expedition proves fruitless, as Lincoln and Taft do not find evidence of any extraterrestrial activity nor any information about the pocket watch. Meanwhile, Wilkie and Wickersham travel to New York City to talk to J.P. Morgan, forcing him to send them all of his financial reports under threat of federal investigation. As Wilkie and Wickersham leave, they decide to have an elite female spy, Miss Knox, enter Morgan's enterprise as a mole, and it is implied that Morgan is the \\"Gentleman from New York\\" from Tesla's broadcast. After working as a personal aide to Morgan for months, Miss Knox finds clues indicating that Morgan's shipping trust, the International Mercantile Marine Company (specifically the White Star Line) is at the center of a smuggling operation, and she plans to have herself transferred to the Line. Over the next year, Lincoln writes to scientists such as Theodor Wulf and Albert Einstein for information about the pocket watch and the blue light over the Wrangells. He finds out that the power source in the watch is made of lead, a material which can not create the necessary heat to power the watch. Lincoln also finds out that the Wrangell mountains possess large quantities of the radioactive element cesium, which may have been the cause of the blue light. He learns that Morgan and Guggenheim have begun shipping material out of the Wrangell mines, meaning that the operation the \\"gentlemen\\" were planning is going undeterred. An inquiry into the U.S. Steel Trust, which includes Morgan and the Guggenheims, has begun, and a criminal investigation of the trust is now certain. Captain Butt has been promoted to Major and is the President's new aide. One night in 1911, Lincoln suddenly remembers that his father accidentally left the pocket watch in Lincoln's room at the White House the night of the assassination. He rushes to Washington to tell the President that his father undoubtedly owned the watch. In the White House, as the Tafts are celebrating their 25th wedding anniversary, the Secret Service are distracted by a ruse, Taft's son Robert is kidnapped, and Taft is informed via note to come alone to the Skull and Bones tomb at Yale University. The note states that if Taft does not come, Robert will be killed, and that if he brings any military or Secret Service or alerts the University, New Haven, Connecticut will be destroyed by an unknown superweapon. The night of the meeting, Taft enters the building alone, and is told by a man named Basil Zaharoff, who claims that he works neither for Morgan nor the Guggenheims, to sign a document abolishing the U.S. Constitution. Taft escapes his bonds and kills all of Zaharoff's mercenaries with his bare hands while Zaharoff escapes. Meanwhile, Lincoln, Wilkie and his Secret Service agents discover the superweapon in Yale's underground steam tunnels in the form of capsules of elemental cesium, which was mined in the Wrangells. Believing that the highly explosive cesium would be used to destroy the university with a large explosion, Lincoln collects the capsules to test them. Robert is rescued by a rescue team, and he and Taft return to the Airship. As they fly to Washington, it is deduced that Zaharoff was the \\"Gentleman from Paris\\" from the Tesla broadcast, and that Morgan and the Guggenheims could not have been responsible for the kidnapping. After testing the capsules, Lincoln realizes that the superweapon is not an explosive, but rather an aerosol; the steam tunnels would have been powered up, and the steam would have carried the extremely corrosive cesium up into New Haven, corroding the town away and killing all its citizens. It is also found that the militiamen who had fought the rescue team were from the Belgian Congo, and Taft and Lincoln travel to the Congo to investigate. The crew finds a house in the middle of the jungle that belongs to insane, murderous Belgian military officer Leon Rom, who is found to have been the \\"Gentleman from Boma\\". The crew kill Rom, but are taken aback by his level of psychosis. Taft, Wilkie, Lincoln and several Secret Service agents travel to London for a meeting with an informant named \\"The Colossus\\" set up by Miss Knox. The Colossus (who turns out to be Sir Arthur Conan Doyle) Reveals that Miss Knox, who has taken on the alias Violet Jessop, has found that the International Mercantile Marine is indeed smuggling materials across the Atlantic. After hearing that the pocket watch's power source is made of lead, Doyle explains that the watch was originally powered by uranium, and the lead is the uranium in its decayed state. The group soon realizes that the uranium, gold, copper in the watch and the gold-bearing quartz in the watch fob were all mined in Alaska, and Doyle guesses that the watch was constructed by Russian minister Eduard de Stoeckl to facilitate the Alaska Purchase by proving that the land contained precious materials. After learning that Zaharoff has a duplicate of the watch made from silver, Doyle guesses that Zaharoff stumbled upon the design for the watch and developed the idea for the superweapon, which he created from Alaskan uranium. Robert realizes that the blue lights in the sky over the Wrangells were caused by a test of the weapon, which was purposely performed when Earth passed by Halley's Comet to mask the effects. However, Robert realizes that, to do substantial damage, the superweapon would have to be the size of \\"three city blocks\\" and would require the use of steam. From this, Doyle realizes that the plan from the beginning has been to activate the superweapon via the steam tunnels of the RMS Titanic. On April 14, 1912, Taft, Robert and Wilkie are aboard Airship One, First Lady Nellie Taft is aboard the SS Californian and Butt is already aboard the Titanic. Miss Knox, Major Butt, Taft, Wilkie, and the rescue team descend upon the ship to take it over, but are soon met with mercenaries who kill the captain and hold Taft hostage while engaging the rescue team. The men are greeted by J.P. Morgan and Leopold, the \\"Gentleman from Brussels\\", who had faked his death to escape disgrace. Leopold reveals that he has killed Benjamin Guggenheim, who was the \\"Gentleman from Philadelphia\\" from the Tesla broadcast. Leopold has chosen to attack and destroy the United States with his weapon, because the United States was the first country to expose Leopold's brutalities in the Congo Free State. Crippling the United States will plunge the world into war, and when the great powers collapse, Zaharoff and Leopold will be purveyors of precious materials, making them the most powerful people on Earth. Taft escapes and runs after Leopold, while Wilkie and Lincoln are chased around by \\"Morgan\\", who is actually an android. As passengers take arms and fight Leopold's men, Airship One is shot down and crashes onto the deck. Robert shorts out the power on the ship, preventing use of the superweapon. As Taft and Wilkie prepare to leave, it is revealed to a shocked Taft that \\"Wilkie\\" is really ex-president Theodore Roosevelt. The Californian arrives to aid the Secret Service and rescue Taft and the others. Taft throws the badly wounded Roosevelt to a lifeboat, but before Taft can jump, the Titanic begins to rise out of the water. Leopold sees Taft jumping and prepares to shoot him, but Butt subdues the monarch as the rising waters rush over and kill them. Taft jumps off the ship and is reeled aboard the Californian. Passengers aboard the Titanic who fought against Leopold are delivered to the U.S. and given new lives by the American and British governments. The public is told that the Titanic collided with an iceberg and sank, while the truth is kept a state secret. J.P. Morgan is forced to appear in court for an investigation of his \\"money trust\\", and dies from stress three months later. Butt is given a state funeral and is buried at Arlington National Cemetery. While Taft loses the 1912 presidential election, President Warren Harding offers him a position as Chief Justice of the United States in 1921. Taft and Lincoln are briefly reunited at the dedication of the Lincoln Memorial, where Robert tells Taft that the pocket watch had saved Robert's life on the Titanic by catching a bullet. In 1936, a rich and healthy Zaharoff is living comfortably at the H√¥tel de Paris in Monte Carlo. Zaharoff laments that working for Leopold had been a mistake, as Leopold relied too heavily on \\"lunatics\\" such as Rom and had lucrative motives. It is revealed he importance of the watch to the initiation of Leopold's plan: Zaharoff discovered blueprints for the watch and, deducing from the uranium that the land in Alaska contained radioactive materials, invited Leopold to mine there the cesium that was so important to his plan. As Zaharoff expresses his excitement over future weapons trade negotiations (which are implied to be with Adolf Hitler), Zaharoff suddenly begins to go into convulsions as his maid, who is actually Miss Knox, poisons Zaharoff and steals from him the designs for the pocket watch and his silver duplicate of the watch. Miss Knox poisons Zaharoff and delivers the watch to Nellie. Nellie mails the watch to Lyman James Briggs, chairman of the Uranium Committee along with a letter from President Franklin D. Roosevelt detailing the use of uranium as a weapon. As Nellie, who has always had a negative opinion of the Roosevelt family, ponders working with the new President Roosevelt, she reverses her anti-Roosevelt stand by stating, \\"I like these Roosevelts\\". Characters =Primary characters= William Howard Taft is the 27th President of the United States for most of the novel. Taft loves his wife, Nellie, more than anyone, and was deeply saddened during her period of extended illness. Nellie persuaded Taft to run for president so that she could influence Taft to implement her political agenda, though he desires to be Chief Justice. Throughout the book, he is shown to be in surprisingly good shape, despite his weight. He is not very knowledgeable in matters regarding science or history, but is surprisingly intelligent and deductive. Robert Todd Lincoln is the only remaining son of former President Abraham Lincoln and a highly respected figure in the world of science. This is a departure from Lincoln's real-life profile, as in reality Lincoln was never involved in science. However, his lifelong interest in astronomy is faithfully depicted in the novel, as is his personal observatory at his Manchester mansion Hildene.http://www.hildene.org/about/estate.html Robert is always looking for information about his father's assassination; This desire causes Robert to discover the watch, thus setting the plot of the book in motion. Archibald Butt is captain of Airship One and Taft's closest personal friend. After Taft's personal aide Charles Dyer Norton is fired, Taft personally hires Butt to take Norton's place. During the raids of New Haven and the Titanic, Butt is portrayed to be a talented strategist and commander, as shown when he expertly directs the sharpshooters to provide cover for the protagonists. Butt is shown to think a lot about his mother, and has a near-romantic relationship with Miss Knox. Theodore Roosevelt is one of the most depicted characters in the book, but in most of his appearances he is disguised as Secret Service Chief John Wilkie. Roosevelt's wartime experience makes him a strong leader of the Secret Service, as demonstrated by his skills in combat. Roosevelt's resourcefulness is another distinguishing quality; Roosevelt is able to significantly damage the android by creating a makeshift Molotov cocktail, and is clever enough to short out the power by shooting Tesla's electric rifle at the android of J.P. Morgan. He is able to effectively fool Taft and the others with his disguise for several years, though he expresses disdain for Wilkie's habit of smoking cigars, which he must enact to maintain his disguise. Nellie Taft often voices her suspicion that Wilkie is a spy working for Theodore Roosevelt, which is, in a sense, true. Miss Knox is an elite Secret Service agent. She is highly trained in martial arts and can easily get herself hired and transferred throughout companies as she pleases. She is one of the Secret Service's most talented agents, as shown by the effectiveness with which she investigates the White Star Line under the alias of Violet Jessop. In real life, after the Titanic sank, Violet Jessop served on its sister ships, the Olympic and the Britannic, suggesting that Miss Knox's character would have continued to monitor the Line even after the Taft administration is out of the White House. =Secondary characters= Nellie Taft is William Taft's loving wife. Although she loves her husband, it is said that the main reason she chose to marry him was that she believed he could ascend to the presidency. Nellie is portrayed as having much more political acumen than Taft, and as the real executive force of the Taft administration. She commissioned the construction of Airship One to keep Taft \\"distracted and away from the White House while she expertly [steers] the world into the 20th century\\". Leopold II is a tyrannical former Belgian monarch. After establishing the Congo Free State, Leopold began to steal private-owned lands and kill their inhabitants. Leopold's crimes was exposed by an American historian, his empire collapsed, causing him to blame America for his being removed from power. He faked his death to escape excommunication and vowed revenge on the U.S. and the rest of the world, eventually drawing Zaharoff, Morgan and Guggenheim into his plan of revenge with promises of money and power. It is implied that Leopold only sought the millionaires so that he could use their money and power to support his plot, and would have killed them if the plot was successful. Basil Zaharoff is a Greek arms dealer and the \\"Gentleman from Paris\\" from the Tesla broadcast. Zaharoff first conceptualized the superweapon after seeing the designs for the pocket watch, and developed it from the cesium mined in Alaska. He serves as the main facilitator of Leopold's plans. George Wickersham is the Attorney General of the United States. Wickersham is faithful to the Taft administration and facilitates the prosecution of the Morgan-Guggenheim Syndicate. He is portrayed as a hotheaded, short-tempered man with endless respect for the law. J.P. Morgan is a famous millionaire businessman. Drawn into Leopold's plan for world domination, Morgan believed that he would become even more powerful than he was; however, it is implied that Leopold has merely used Morgan for his wealth and power, planning to kill him once the plan is complete. Benjamin Guggenheim is a world-renowned mining magnate. Though unseen in the novel, Guggenheim plays a key role in Leopold's plot by providing Leopold and Zaharoff access to his uranium mines. He was likely drawn into the plot just as Morgan was, and Leopold has him killed before he can claim his reward. =Historical figures= In addition to the above characters, The Great Abraham Lincoln Pocket Watch Conspiracy depicts or mentions a large number of historical figures: * John Adams * John Quincy Adams * Albert, Prince Consort * Alexander II of Russia * Jane Herron Anderson * Robert Anderson * Thomas Andrews * H.

Dennis that was first published in The Bulletin magazine on 12 November 1908 as an entry in a National Song Competition which drew 74 entries. The entry was entitled \\"A Real Australian Austra--laise\\", and won its author a special prize.The Making of a Sentimental Bloke by Alec H. Chisholm, 1946, pp 33-34 The poem is also known by the titles \\"The Austrabloodyaise\\" and \\" A Real Australian Austra- laise\\". It can be sung to the tune of \\"Onward Christian Soldiers\\". Originally published as a set of four verses in 1908, with blanks instead of dashes and under the byline \\"A. J. Dennis\\",The Bulletin, 12 November 1908, Red Page the poem was expanded later to its now-familiar 7 stanzas.Backblock Ballads and Other Verses (1913) It was later included in the author's poetry collections Backblock Ballads and Other Verses (1913) and Backblock Ballads and Later Verses (1918). It was subsequently reprinted in various newspaper and magazines, as well as in the poetry anthologies: Complete Book of Australian Folklore edited by Bill Scott (1976); An Illustrated Treasury of Australian Verse edited by Beatrice Davis (1984); and The Penguin Book of Australian Humorous Verse edited by Bill Scott (1984). Dennis was rather staggered by the success of the poem, writing to William Moore, the art critic, \\"Without any guff it really surprised me to see the Australaise so popular. It was written originally as a joke on the editor of the Red Page [of The Bulletin] and was not intended for publication. Since then, comments upon it have turned up from all sorts of unlikely places - the centre of Africa, Fiji, and now London.\\" Footnote to 1915 edition: \\"Where a dash (‚Äî‚Äî) replaces a missing word, the adjective \\"blessed\\" may be interpolated. In cases demanding great emphasis, the use of the word \\"blooming\\" is permissible. However, any other word may be used that suggests itself as suitable.\\" Earlier editions also included this footnote: \\"(With some acknowledgements to W. T. Goodge.)\\". All mention of Goodge had disappeared by 1918.Backblock Ballads and Later Verses (1918) Dennis's acknowledgement to W.T. Goodge refers to that author's poem \\"The Great Australian Adjective\\" published in The Bulletin on 11 December 1897.

It is approximately long and flows through Hazle Township and West Hazleton. Its named tributaries include Cranberry Creek and Wolffs Run. Stony Creek is considered to be impaired by acid mine drainage and also has measurable concentrations of iron, aluminum, and manganese. The Llwellyn Formation and the Mauch Chunk Formation can be found near the creek. Land uses in its watershed include forested land and barren land. A reservoir has been constructed in the watershed and at least one bridge has been built over the creek. The creek is considered to be a coldwater fishery and a migratory fishery. Course Stony Creek begins at the confluence of Wolffs Run and an unnamed stream near State Route 3024 in Hazle Township. It flows north for nearly a mile, receiving an unnamed tributary and entering a valley. The creek then turns east-northeast for a few miles, remaining in its valley. Eventually it crosses Interstate 81 and receives the tributary Cranberry Creek. At this point, Stony Creek turns north and enters West Hazleton after a short distance. A short distance further downstream, it reaches its confluence with Black Creek. =Tributaries= Stony Creek has two named tributaries: Cranberry Creek and Wolffs Run. Hydrology The pH of the waters of Stony Creek is 5.3 and the total concentration of alkalinity is 2 milligrams per liter. The concentration of water hardness in the creek is over 100 milligrams per liter, which is nearly four times more than the concentration of water hardness in any other major headwater tributary of Nescopeck Creek. The specific conductance is 27 micro-siemens. Stony Creek and its tributary Cranberry Creek are considered by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection to be impaired by metals and pH due to acid mine drainage from abandoned coal mines. The creek is one of six streams in the watershed of Nescopeck Creek to be impaired by acid mine drainage. Stony Creek also contributes acid mine drainage to Black Creek. Upstream of Interstate 81, the discharge of Stony Creek is 3209.50 gallons per minute. Downstream of Cranberry Creek, the discharge increases to 5898.83 gallons per minute. There are detectable concentrations of metals on Stony Creek upstream of Interstate 81, but not enough to violate water quality standards. However, there is a total maximum daily load for acidity. The concentrations of aluminum, iron, and manganese there are 0.23, 0.16, and 0.05 milligrams per liter, respectively. The daily loads are , , and respectively. The concentration of acidity is 7.03 milligrams per liter and the concentration of alkalinity is 0.40 milligrams per liter. The load of acidity is per day (the maximum allowable load is per day) and the alkalinity load is per day. Sulfate concentrations range from 7.3 to 8.4 milligrams per liter.

Geography and geology The elevation near the mouth of Stony Creek is above sea level. The elevation of the creek's source is between above sea level. The Hazleton-Dekalb-Buchanan soil series can be found in the watershed of Stony Creek. This soil is also found in several other nearby portions of the Nescopeck Creek watershed, such as the watershed of Black Creek, Hazleton, and West Hazleton. Rock formations in the watershed of Stony Creek include the Llwellyn Formation and the Mauch Chunk Formation. The latter rock formation is the most prevalent one in the watershed of Nescopeck Creek. A mine pool basin known as the Stony Creek Basin drains to the Stony Creek Mine Seepage and the Stony Creek Mine Pool Overflow. This mine pool basin affects Stony Creek. This discharge has a flow of 0.3 cubic feet per second at the surface and 4.0 cubic feet per second underground. Watershed The watershed of Stony Creek is in the south-central part of the Nescopeck Creek watershed. There are several miles of local roads and considerably fewer miles of state roads in the watershed of Stony Creek. More than 50 percent of the Nescopeck Creek watershed is on forested land. However, 30 percent of the watershed of Stony Creek is barren land. Urban land and strip mines occupy a significant portion of the watershed's land. The watershed is one of several sub-watersheds in the Nescopeck Creek drainage basin where coal mining land is prevalent, the others being Black Creek and Cranberry Creek. Stony Creek is entirely within the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Conyngham. A reservoir known as the Humboldt Reservoir is in the watershed of Stony Creek. The reservoir provides 20 percent of Hazleton's water supply. History Stony Creek was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1188763. A concrete culvert bridge carrying Interstate 81 over Stony Creek was constructed in 1967. The bridge is long. The Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission has a water quality sampling station on Stony Creek. Biology Stony Creek is considered to be a Coldwater Fishery, as is its tributary Cranberry Creek. Stony Creek is also designated as a Migratory Fishery.

The pathogen that causes this disease is the fungus Phellinus tremulae. Most of the symptoms of this disease are internal, with the only external signs of a diseased aspen being fruiting bodies called conks. A single conk found on an aspen can indicate advanced decay of up 82% of the tree volume.Pscheidt, J. W., and C. M. Ocamb. \\"Aspen (Populus Tremuloides)-Aspen Trunk Rot.\\" Pacific Northwest Pest Management Handbooks. Oregon State University, 2014. Web. 21 Oct. 2014. Internal decayed wood of freshly cut aspens is spongy, yellow/white colored, surrounded by black zones of discoloration, and contains a distinct wintergreen smell. The fungus is spread via airborne spores released from the fruiting body which can infect through dead branches, branch stubs, or wounds in the tree. Although no direct management control is known, harvesting aspen stands that have been damaged or harvesting stands before decay becomes advanced minimizes tree loss. Aspen wood is white, malleable but strong, and heat-tolerant and therefore has many commercial uses including matches, packing paper, lumber, plywood, pulp, and animal beds. Aspen trees diseased with aspen trunk rot decrease the economic value of the lumber. Hosts and symptoms Aspen trunk rot affects only living aspen and occasionally a variety of poplar trees. Trembling Aspen Populus tremuloides and Large-tooth Aspen Populus grandidentata are two major hosts of trunk rot.Volk, Tom. \\"Phellinus Tremulae, One of the Causes of Heartrot, in Honor of Valentine's Day. Tom Volk's Fungus of the Month for February 2004.\\" N.p., 14 Feb. 2004. Web. 22 Oct. 2014. In all infected species, the most obvious sign of rot is a conk on the stem of the tree. A conk is the woody fruiting body of the fungus that forms a triangular shape. Conks are perennial and can survive for up to twenty years. They form about five years after the initial infection.USDA. \\"Aspen Trunk Rot.\\" Forest Health Protection Rocky Mountain Region(2011): 1-2. Web. 21 Oct. 2014. As the decay progresses, rot within the heartwood occurs. The rot appears as a yellowish- white spongy material with black zone lines surrounding it.Basham, J. T. \\"Decay of Trembling Aspen.\\" Canadian Journal of Botany 36 (1958): 491-505. NRC Research Press. Web. 11 Oct. 2014. The main body of rot occurs in the trunk and stem but basal rot can occur as well.Ostry, Michael E., and James W. Walters. \\"How to Identify and Minimize White Trunk Rot of Aspen.\\" United States Department of Agriculture, 1983. Web. 22 Oct. 2014 The decayed wood has a distinct wintergreen aroma that signifies trunk rot. At the initial stages, the decay may appear discolored but continue to be hard and firm while at later stages, the rot may becomes brownish and the tree may lose structural strength and snap due to a wind gust or other damaging factor.Hebertson, Liz. Management Guide for Aspen Heart Rot 13.6 (2005): 1-6. Forest Health Protection. US Forest Service, May 2005. Web. 11 Oct. 2014. Aspen trunk rot affects older (50‚Äì60 years) trees more than younger trees. Older trees tend to have more wounds and damage. Phellinus tremulae can maintain a resting state for 20 years, so older trees have a greater chance of being infected.Yukon Forest Health, n.d. Yukon Energy Mines and Resources. Web. 22 Oct. 2014. Older trees become diseased and die more quickly than younger trees. Stem wounds also increase the opportunities for infection no matter the age of the tree. In order to diagnose aspen trunk rot, conks are the first sign to look for. Perennial conks with concentric growth rings indicate severe decay because each growth ring signifies a season of disease. It takes many years to build up the concentric rings to indicate severe decay. The conks can appear to have a triangular shape and the lower surface is covered in pores.Worrell, James J. Decay and Discoloration of Aspen. N.p.: US Department of Agriculture-Forest Service, 2009. Knots and stem wounds/scars also indicate decay within the aspen tree while cavities and cracks display the inner decay. Aspen trunk rot is a white rotter because the lignin is broken down within the tree, giving the diseased trunk a white appearance. Disease cycle Phellinus tremulae spreads through airborne basidiospores. Sporulation occurs in late winter, early spring, and continues with moist weather in the summer. Spores germinate sexually in fresh wounds only (<1 week old) and conks are produced by the fungus body after 5 years of infection. The conks produce the basidiospores on the underside and setae surround the basidia for protection. Phellinus tremulae has spherical spores with four basidiospores per basidium and generative, skeletal hyphae.\\"Aspen Bracket (Phellinus Tremulae (Bondartsev) Bondartsev & P.N. Borisov 1953) - Information on Aspen Bracket - Encyclopedia of Life.\\" Encyclopedia of Life. N.p., 1953. Web. 10 Nov. 2014. Compared to other species in the genus Phellinus, the setae are large and the basidiospores are much smaller.Sell, Indrek. \\"Systematics and Ecology of Selected Taxa of Wood-Decaying Basidiomycetes.\\" Dspace. Estonian University of Life Sciences, 2012. Web. 10 Nov. 2014. Within the tube layers, mycelium crowd the space. The infection of aspen trunk rot is localized, but decay can spread 2‚Äì3 meters above and below the infection site.\\"White Trunk Rot of Aspen.\\" Environment-Government of Saskatchewan. Saskatchewan Ministry of Environment, Web. 11 Oct. 2014. The disease cycle of Phellinus tremulae is similar to other fungi but is incomplete. Spores enter new hosts through branch stubs or wounds. Mycelia begin to develop and are activated when exposed to air. The disease spreads through the heartwood and fruiting bodies (conks in advanced decay) develop. Spores are dispersed from the fruiting bodies in all directions. Environment Aspen trunk rot is the most common stem decay of aspen in North America. It is especially common in the Rocky Mountains and in Colorado. Aspen trunk rot prevalence varies with age and soil conditions. In regions where aspen grow quickly and mature early, decay also advances rapidly and early in the tree's life. It kills these trees by directly growing into and killing older sapwood. There is a higher percentage of incidence with dry, shallow soils and less incidence with deep soils with adequate moisture. It is predicted that climate change will impact the prevalence of aspen trunk rot through changing moisture conditions. One effect of climate change is expected increases in temperature. This will result in lower soil moisture levels because of increased transpiration and evaporation. This will cause moisture stress in the trees, making them more vulnerable to aspen trunk rot. Also with less moisture, wind-borne spore dispersal will be impacted. In warmer and drier climates the spread of disease through windborne spores may increase. Management There is no direct known control for aspen trunk rot. There are management steps to preserve healthy stands of aspen. As a rule older stands contain a greater amount of decayed heartwood than young stands. Maintaining healthy stands and preventing mechanical and fire damage reduces the likelihood of disease. This is because trees with open wounds, frost cracks or conks are more susceptible to the fungus.Jones, Alan C., and Michael E. Ostry. \\"Estimating White Trunk Rot in Aspen Stands.\\" Northern Journal of Applied Forestry 15.1 (1998): 33-36. Web. 22 Oct. 2014. This makes it hard to prevent because it can be difficult to prevent wounds on the tree. To reduce the impact that causing wounds can have, it is recommended that development of recreation areas not be in aspen stands because they could become more susceptible to decay and disease following injury caused by humans. It is also recommended that partial cutting to thin and remove defective trees not be used as a management technique because residual stands often deteriorate within 5 years. Instead the goal should be to maintain uniform, well-stocked stands and harvest the whole stand before the decay becomes excessive. Another possible management strategy would be to use the fungus Phoma etheridgei as an inhibitory agent against Phellinus tremulae. In a study published in the Canadian Journal of Botany the occurrence of black galls on aspen trees produced by Phoma etheridgei resulted in a significant decrease or absence of infection by Phellinus tremulae. Further studies on using the antifungal compounds produced by Phoma etheridgei to control aspen trunk rot may play a key role in controlling Phellinus tremulae.Hutchison, Leonard J., P. Chakravarty. \\"Sp.nov. from Black Galls and Cankers of Trembling Aspen and Its Potential Role as a Bioprotectant against the Aspen Decay Pathogen.\\" Canadian Journal of Botany 72.10 (1994): 1424-431. Web. 2 Dec. 2014. Importance Aspen tree wood has many commercial uses due to its soft yet strong and heat- tolerant wood. Some of these uses include matches, building material where low flammability is key, packing paper, plywood, and animal bedding due to lack of irritant phenols in the wood. Because infected trees lose an average of 70% wood volume to the fungus after being infected, Phellinus tremulae causes a lot of economic damage. For example, plywood should be decay-free without any discoloration as this downgrades the product. Phellinus tremulae creates decay and discoloration and therefore results in enormous amounts of waste at the mill. Harvesting aspens with trunk rot is more costly because decay-free trees can be scattered over vast areas in the forest and determining if a tree is infected can be challenging without first cutting down the tree. The high moisture content found in trees infected with Phellinus tremulae increases the shipping costs if dried as it would be with uninfected trees. In order to combat these increased shipping costs, 15% more drying time is required to reduce the moisture content.Hiratsuka, Y., and A. A. Loman. \\"Decay of Aspen and Balsam Poplar in Alberta.\\" AGRIS (1984): 1-17. Web. 10 Nov. 2014. Phellinus tremulae compromises the integrity of the tree structure causing a health risk for anyone walking in an aspen forest, as a gust of wind could blow the infected tree down. In fact, an estimated 80% of standing dead aspen biomass will fall within ten years of being infected and this resultant increase in standing, dead tree biomass represents a significant potential source of carbon emissions to the atmosphere.Hogg, Edward H., and Michael Michaelian. \\"Factors Affecting Fall down Rates of Dead Aspen (Populus Tremuloides) Biomass following Severe Drought in West-central Canada.\\" Scandinavian Journal of Forest Research 27.1 (2012): 10-29. Web. 12 Dec. 2014 On the other hand, Phellinus tremulae provides an important habitat for birds and mammals such as woodpeckers, bats, flying and red squirrels, red-naped sapsuckers, boreal owls, and buffleheads. For example, bats rely on the tree cavities formed by heart rot for communal maternity roosting. The older trees with more heart rot may contribute to a stable, warmer microclimate perfect for fetal development and juvenile growth.Parsons, Sarah, Kathy J. Lewis, and Jennifer M. Psyllakis. \\"Relationships between Roosting Habitat of Bats and Decay of Aspen in the Sub-boreal Forests of British Columbia.\\" Forest Ecology and Management 177.1-3 (2003): 559-70. Web. 2 Dec. 2014 Additionally, according to a study carried out by the USDA, Phellinus tremulae plays a key role in breeding requirements for the red-naped sapsuckers and buffleheads, nest site selection for woodpeckers, and cavities for habitat for squirrels and owls.USDA Forest Service - Rocky Mountain Research Station. \\"Heartrot Fungi‚Äôs Role in Creating Picid Nesting Sites in Living Aspen.\\" Sustaining Aspen in Western Landscapes: Symposium Proceedings; 13‚Äì15 June 2000; Grand Junction, CO.

Harvard of the South released their debut EP Miracle in October 2014. Their song Without was released as a free download via SoundCloud on May 8, 2017. The band has recorded a full album which they plan to release in 2020. Band history Blue October members Jeremy and Justin Furstenfeld became fans of the band Longwave upon seeing them perform in Austin, Texas during SXSW on the tour for their 2003 album The Strangest Things. In interviews at the time, they touted Longwave as being their favorite band, and Jeremy still refers to Longwave as his favorite band ever, and in 2018 Justin referred to Longwave as one of his top three favorite bands. They played The Strangest Things incessantly on the cd player in their tour van. During Blue October's History for Sale tour in 2004, they would play the entire The Strangest Things album over the PA during set changes at their shows, thus exposing countless Blue October fans to Longwave's music. Blue October's manager reached out to Longwave with the idea of the two bands touring together. The tour plans came to fruition in 2009, with Longwave opening Blue October's Approaching Normal summer tour which also coincided with the release of Longwave's album Secrets Are Sinister. At the Boston date of this tour, Justin Furstenfeld joined Longwave on stage to sing the song \\"I Know It's Coming Someday\\", which is his favorite song from The Strangest Things. Following the tour, Longwave guitarist Shannon Ferguson became a father and announced he was taking a break from the band. The remaining members of Longwave decided to place the band on hiatus and work on other projects. Longwave singer Steve Schiltz set to work on a solo project which he dubbed \\"Hurricane Bells\\". Hurricane Bells was invited to open Blue October's spring 2010 Reason to Live tour, however Schiltz did not have a live backing band. He was able to form a live band with help from the members of the other bands on the tour, which were Daniel Orvik of Stars of Track and Field, Ashen Keilyn of Scout, and Jeremy Furstenfeld and Ryan Delahoussaye of Blue October. During the tour, Steve would often join Blue October on stage to sing on the song \\"Into the Ocean\\". At the end of the 2010 tour, Blue October guitarist C.B. Hudson quit the band. On Blue October's next album, Any Man in America, Steve Schiltz was asked to play guitar, which he did in exchange for Justin Furstenfeld providing harmonica on the new Hurricane Bells album, Down Comes The Rain, which included a cover of \\"Into the Ocean\\". Steve and Jeremy also began collaborating on songs which were outside of either Blue October or Hurricane Bells, by setting up their equipment in Jeremy's living room and jamming out song ideas. Julian Mandrake was hired to replace C.B. Hudson as Blue October's guitarist, but he parted ways with the band over creative differences during pre-production sessions for Blue October's 2013 album Sway. Again Steve Schiltz was invited to Texas to play on a Blue October album, and further collaboration occurred. Between 2011 and 2013 Steve and Jeremy composed eleven songs, and recorded them at Jeremy's house, with the majority of their work occurring in 2012 while Justin was in rehab. Once the music was complete, Steve and Justin wrote lyrics to the music. Blue October's bassist Matt Noveskey was brought in to round out the group, and recording was completed in early 2014. Harvard of the South played their first concerts opening for Blue October in San Marcos, Texas March 21-22, 2014. The San Marcos concerts also featured Steve playing guitar with Blue October on their song \\"Bleed Out\\". Steve Schiltz mixed the Harvard of the South album in the summer of 2014, and Fred Kevorkian mastered the tracks. In October the first five songs were released as a limited edition EP, which was sold at concerts. The group played ten more concerts opening for Blue October in November 2014, and played another seventeen shows opening for Blue October in April and May 2015. In May 2015 the group played a live set at Orb Studios in Austin, and released videos of the session on YouTube. A previously unreleased song, \\"Running\\" was among the songs played. On April 17, 2017 Harvard of the South announced they would be opening six dates on Blue October's Heart Go Bang Tour in May 2017. The band released their song WithOut via free download on May 8, 2017. Although the band had recorded a full album, it remained unreleased as the members of Blue October were busy producing and promoting their highly successful album I Hope You're Happy. In 2018 Longwave reunited, toured with Blue October in October of that year, and in 2019 released the album If We Ever Live Forever. Following the conclusion of the I Hope You're Happy tour, Blue October recorded the album This is What I Live For. However their 2020 tour plans were thwarted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Finding themselves with a sudden plethora of down time, Jeremy Furstenfeld and Steve Schiltz revisited the Harvard of the South recordings. During the summer of 2020 they decided to re-record some parts on some songs and remix and remaster the entire album to prepare it for a 2020 release.

ISIL claimed that they had taken control of the city, but pro-government fighters said that fighting was ongoing. However, the following day, Iraqi officials said that 90% of the town was not under their control. ISIL flags were reportedly flying on government buildings, including the governor's office and police station. The assault began after a suicide bomber attacked the city, according to Iraqi officials. They looted many tanks and other military equipment as well. There were also unconfirmed reports that they left the town as a result of coalition airstrikes. On October 5, a suicide bomber detonated an explosive-rigged vehicles into a military checkpoint near the entrance of the city, killing 3 and wounding 5. The suicide bombing took place in the eastern part of the city, and killed Capt. Mohammed Saad as well. On October 13, ISIL took control of a major military base in the region, after Iraqi forces abandoned it. Coalition airstrikes failed to dislodge the militants, and a large number of refugees left the town. 50% of the population had fled the town due to the airstrikes as well. They retreated to the Asad Airbase, which included many senior officers among them. ISIL captured more equipment, including 3 tanks and other vehicles. =Refugee crisis= During and after the fighting, many people fled Hit and other places in the Anbar Province. According to UN officials, more than 180,000 people were displaced because the fighting, and many have gone to government-held areas of Ramadi. Many civilians were left in need of food, blankets and medical supplies. =War crimes= After the fall of the town, ISIL executed several members of the Albu Nimr tribe, because they had fought against them. Many have been abducted from their homes, and their fate is unknown. However, they are widely believed to be dead. A mass grave was discovered outside the city, which had the bodies of 200 people, and an additional 48 fighters were paraded through the streets before being executed. Despite this, the tribe said that they will try to retake the city.

It is endemic in western North America west of the Rocky Mountains from Alaska to southern Mexico. While a natural agent of forest turnover, H. occidentale has become of increased concern due to forest management processes such as pre-commercial thinning, altered site density and species composition, and carbon sequestration. H. occidentale forms part of the genus that includes other species forming the important forest pest Heterobasidion annosum sensu lato that is spread across the Northern Hemisphere. H. occidentale is part of the S-type intersterility group differing from the other North American species, Heterobasidion irregulare. Distribution H. occidentale is found in Western North America from Alaska to Southern Mexico. It is found as far inland as Colorado and Montana, but has not been observed east of the Rocky Mountains. The incidence is of highest importance in stands of intensive silviculture, such as Christmas tree plantations. It is also of high importance to the Abies religiosa forests in Central Mexico that are the winter home for the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexipus). H. occidentale affects several species of trees including major hosts including Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla), and various fir (Abies) species. Other notable hosts include sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) as well as numerous deciduous trees such as red alder (Alnus rubra), bigleaf maple (Acer macrophyllum) and pacific madrone (Arbutus menziesii). Ornamental and landscape trees are seldom affected. This contrasts the Eurasian S-type species, H. parviporum, which has a fairly strict host range of spruce, fir, and larch. Evolution H. occidentale was only formally described and named in 2010, as before it was known as North American ‚ÄòS‚Äô-type or H. parviporum. Interfertility and genetic studies established that H. occidentale is distinct from H. irregulare and H. parviporum. The H. occidentale and H. parviporum ancestor likely occupied Eastern Asia and Western North America 35 to 42 million years ago, where H. occidentale crossed the Bering Strait crossing open 100‚Äì3.5 million years ago and evolved into a unique species. Symptoms, and Signs H. occidentale can be detected in stands due to lower crown height of affected trees in a stand. Infection weakens the roots and will travel up to up the heartwood affecting wood quality and yield. The weakened roots will increase the chance of windthrow, which can be used to identify diseased sites. The hosts of H. occidentale tend to have increased butt and sapwood decay then H. irregulare hosts which suffer from cambial and sapwood necrosis. Affected trees can be hard to identify as older trees tend to show gradual symptoms such as decreased leader growth, abnormally short twigs or needles, as well as decreased root systems. The fruit bodies (basidiocarps) of H. occidentale are its most identifying feature. It is a small shelf or \\"conk\\" with an irregular edge with white spore tubes on the underneath. The basidiocarp is perennial and the top layer will form layering edges that are dark yellow to brown. Basidiocarps tend to form near the forest floor of affected trees and may be hidden in the forest duff. Identification in affected wood, known as white pocket rot, includes symptoms in the form of dark discolouration around the heartwood near the base. Heavily diseased wood will be soft, stringy, and fibrous that may contain black specks parallel to the grain. Quick identification of affected wood can be done by wrapping suspect wood in damp paper towels and left for 5‚Äì6 days for the tell-tale formation of the conidial anamorph, Spiniger meineckellus. The basidiospores are spherical to ellipsoid, distinctive of the family Bondarzewiaceae. Distinction from H. irregulare is difficult as both share similar morphologies, distribution, and host range. In stands were both species are endemic, differentiation by hosts is unreliable due to shared host species and the potential spread from root contacts from other host species. Identification using genetic methods is the most accurate method for differentiation. Morphologically differentiation is most reliably made through pore density of the basidiocarps as H. irregulare has a lower density than H. occidentale with more oblong and larger pores. The discovery of first generation hybrids in Montana could further confuse the speciation. Life Cycle Heterobasidion can be spread through conidia, basidiospores, and mycelia. H. occidentale can not grow freely in soil and relies on aerial infection for distribution. Basidiospores can travel from the basidiocarps through the air infecting exposed sapwood from injured trees. Spores are present year-round, due to the perennial fruiting bodies, with the greatest quantity detected during spring and autumn in the Pacific Northwest. Forest distress such as pre-commercial thinning may increase spore release in affected forests. Conidia can travel through air, water, or soil and can survive up to 10 months in some soil types. Disease symptoms are worse on well-drained soil with little organic litter. Sites with neutral or alkaline soil conditions, such as former agricultural sites may sustain more damage than continuously forested sites. H. occidentale can also spread directly between the adjacent trees through root contact with an infected tree. This phenomenon can devastate forests creating ‚Äòcircles of death‚Äô that can be difficult to remove from a stand. However compared to other root rot pathogens the genets of disease circles are not as large or as old as those found from Armillaria or Phellinus. Control Control measures for H. occidentale focus on limiting the exposure of stumps for colonization by basidiospores. Basidiospores of H. occidentale can quickly colonize exposed stumps after logging, or pre-commercial thinning disturbances but infection rates are low due to competition with other saprotrophic fungi. Covering exposed stumps with a chemical barrier such as borax or urea is used in other parts of North America to control H. irregulare. Biological control agents, such as Phlebiopsis gigantea, have been demonstrated as competitive agents to displace Heterobasidion on stumps. Stump removal is a common method to remove inoculum and bait stumps from forests after logging for other Heterobasidion species but is not a common method of control for H. occidentale.

Born in Rawene, Hokianga, to Eruera and Katina (n√©e Toraki) Nathan, he was of MƒÅori (Te Roroa, NgƒÅti WhƒÅtua and NgƒÅpuhi) descent on his father's side and Greek (Cretan) descent on his mother's side. Nathan was raised in Wekaweka, and subsequently moved to Wellington with his family in 1955. He completed a Diploma of Textile Design at Wellington Polytechnic School of Design in 1968‚Äì70. In 1986, along with Baye Riddell, he founded NgƒÅ Kaihanga Uku, the national MƒÅori clayworkers' organisation in Aotearoa New Zealand. In 1989, he travelled to the United States on a Fulbright grant to visit First Nations Native American potters. A reciprocal visit took place in 1991 and he continued to foster links to indigenous peoples with a clay tradition in the Pacific and in North America. He was a foundation member of Te Atinga, the Visual Arts committee of Toi MƒÅori Aotearoa. Nathan exhibited widely around the world and was actively engaged with cultural exchanges with indigenous peoples of Japan, Australia, the Pacific, the United States and Canada.

Early life Born in Burgsteinfurt, he was the fourth son of Charles, Landgrave of Hesse-Philippsthal-Barchfeld and his second wife Sophie, daughter of Prince Louis William Geldricus Ernest of Bentheim and Steinfurt. Career After serving as cadet and watch officer in the Royal Danish Navy and the British Royal Navy, William joined the Prussian Navy on 29 January 1854 as Lieutenant 1st Class, (captain lieutenant). In the summer of 1854, he served as commanding officer of the corvette . On 15 October 1854 he was promoted to the rank of Korvettenkapit√§n (corvette captain). In the winter of 1855/56, he served as Director of the 2nd Division of the Admiralty. At the same time he took command of the corvette , a post which he held until November 1856. In this ship he participated in an expedition under the command of Admiral Prince Adalbert to Africa. During the trip, William came into conflict with the Admiral for his punitive actions against the Riffians. Adalbert released William from active service for about a month until the Battle of Tres Forcas on 7 August 1856. After returning home, William was again released from active duty from November 1856 to April 1859. During this time, he was promoted to the rank of Kapit√§n zur See (captain at sea) on 24 October 1857. After his return to active service, William took the command of the frigate from May to September 1859. In April 1860, he asked his release from active service duty, and on 22 March 1864 was appointed Konteradmiral (counter admiral). During the Franco-Prussian War William was under the service of the General Governor of the German Coastal Lands (Generalgouverneur der deutschen K√ºstenlande) and General of the Infantry Eduard Vogel von Falckenstein. He sent him to the armed steamer St. George on negotiations with the commander of the French Armed Forces, Vice admiral Martin Fourichon to tell it that shelling the German coast could lead to reprisals in occupied France. Due to the course of the war, the French blockade in the North Sea was canceled after a short time.Hans H. Hildebrand, Albert R√∂hr, Hans-Otto Steinmetz: Die deutschen Kriegsschiffe, vol. 4, no. 1. Auflage, Herford 1982. On 30 May 1872, William was appointed Konteradmiral √† la suite of the Imperial Navy. Personal life In Kassel on 27 December 1857, William married firstly Princess Maria of Hanau and Ho≈ôowitz (1839‚Äì1917), daughter of Frederick William, Elector of Hesse- Kassel; however, the Grand Duke of Hesse-Darmstadt regarded William's marriage as morganatic and refused to recognize their offspring as legitimate Hessian princes. They had five children: * Frederick William (1858‚Äì1902), who married an American, Anne Hollingsworth-Price, in 1890. No issue. * Charles William (1861‚Äì1938), who married to Anne Elise Strehlow in 1891. No issue. * Sophie Auguste Elisabeth (1864‚Äì1919), who married Count Ferdinand of Ysenburg- B√ºdingen in Philippseich in 1886. * Alice (1867‚Äì1868), who died in infancy. * Caroline Louise (1868‚Äì1959), who married Prince Rudolph of Lippe-Biesterfeld, a son of Julius, Count of Lippe-Biesterfeld, in 1889. William and Maria divorced on 18 March 1872, and she lost the right of use the title of Princess of Hesse. Four years later, on 28 July 1876, she and her surviving children were styled Princes and Princesses of Ardeck. =Second marriage= In Burgsteinfurt on 16 August 1873, William married, secondly, Princess Juliane of Bentheim and Steinfurt (1842‚Äì1878), his niece (daughter of his older half- sister Bertha a and her husband, Ludwig Wilhelm, Prince of Bentheim and Steinfurt). Before her death on 29 April 1878 in Burgsteinfurt, they were the parents of four children: * Bertha Louise Ottilie Auguste Adelheid Marie (1874‚Äì1919), who married Leopold IV, Prince of Lippe in 1901. * Chlodwig Alexis Ernest (1876‚Äì1954), who became Landgrave of Hesse-Philippsthal- Barchfeld in 1905 and head of the entire Hesse-Philippsthal branch in 1925. * Edward Ernest Alexis Hermann Philipp (1878‚Äì1879), a twin who died young. * Julian Charles George William (1878‚Äì1878), a twin who died young. =Third marriage= In Burgsteinfurt on 23 August 1879, William married, thirdly, Princess Adelaide of Bentheim and Steinfurt (1840‚Äì1880), the older sister of his second wife.Ludwig Wilhelm F√ºrst zu Bentheim u. Steinfurt in: Genealogy Database by Herbert Stoyan [retrieved 2 December 2014]. The union, who lasted only five months, was childless, before she died in Bingen on 31 January 1880. Her brother, Alexis, Prince of Bentheim and Steinfurt married Princess Pauline of Waldeck and Pyrmont, the elder sister of Marie, Crown Princess of W√ºrttemberg, Emma, Queen of the Netherlands, Helena, Duchess of Albany, Friedrich, Prince of Waldeck and Pyrmont, and Elisabeth, Princess of Erbach- Sch√∂nberg. =Fourth marriage= In Louisenlund Castle on 6 December 1884, William married, fourthly, Princess Auguste of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg- Gl√ºcksburg (1844‚Äì1932), a daughter of Friedrich, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein- Sonderburg-Gl√ºcksburg and niece of King Christian IX of Denmark.

He later came under scrutiny for alleged inaccuracy of terminology and omissions of information. Rival newspapers attacked him for twisting the truth, and more far-right figures went so far as to accuse him of fabrication. His mother-in-law is Yang Sun-Im, a Korean activist who heads the Association for the Pacific War Victims and plaintiff groups for lawsuits by former comfort women.  Kim Hak- sun, story of a comfort woman  Uemura ran a story dated August 11, 1991 in the Asahi newspaper, which profiled a former comfort woman based on a tape- recorded testimony. The identity of the woman was withheld from Uemura at the time, but later it transpired that she was Kim Hak-sun. Kim disclosed her identity in a press conference she held 3 days after this article. The precise wording in Uemura's article was as follows: \\"she was taken away under the name of the 'women volunteer corps'\\" and was a \\"Korean comfort woman serving the army. Uemura followed up with another article on December 25, 1991, based on the interview of Kim Hak-sun conducted by Japanese lawyers. Controversy By 2014, Uemura had retired from the newspaper and was seeking university teaching positions. The articles Uemura had written in the 1990s about the comfort women came under fire, criticized for the choice of language as well as suppression of certain crucial information. In 2014 Asahi retracted certain comfort women-related stories dating to the 1990s which were based on Seiji Yoshida's discredited testimony. There had been a pall of suspicion hanging over the veracity of Seiji's alleged accounts since soon after its publication. As a collateral fallout of these retractions, Uemura, whose articles were also subjected to certain critiques aforementioned, got labeled as \\"fabricator of the comfort women\\" by \\"Right-wing tabloids\\", even though Uemura was not the writer of these pieces based on Yoshida's hoax. Uemura has insisted he did not write any stories based on the Yoshida testimony. While Uemura's articles were not outright retracted, Uemura's reporting on the comfort women were criticized and subjected to corrigenda in Asahi's \\"Corrections\\" article. Specifically, his phraseology that the \\"comfort women\\" were recruited \\"nominally as women volunteer corps\\", and secondly, for omitting the Korean victim Kim Hak-sun's background that she had been a kisaeng (courtesan) in-training prior to being dispatched as a comfort woman in China. This \\"Corrections\\" piece was issued in the form of a \\"Third-party Committee Report\\". = Malapropism allegations = Rival papers such as the Sankei and Yomiuri have attacked the Uemura's use of the term to mean \\"comfort women\\", and similar usage of \\"volunteer corps\\" (teishin-tai) in an Asahi newspaper glossary piece. The Sankei newspaper has accused Uemura of \\"distortions of facts\\" in using such terminology, even though the Asahi's \\"Corrections\\" piece, the Third-party committee concluded there was no \\"distortion\\" here on Uemura's part. The thrust of the criticism here is that the term Joshi Teishin-tai \\"women volunteer corps\\" was an entity clearly distinguishable from comfort women. The \\"women volunteer corps\\" has been described as a body akin to \\"Rosie the Riveter\\" in the U.S. Critics say that these comfort women were never recruited \\"as a\\" volunteer corps in fact, or even by name. However, the instance of the term \\"volunteers\\" (teishin-tai) being used to refer to \\"comfort women\\" is hardly unique to the Asahi's or Uemura's articles dating to 1991‚Äì1992. There are multiple instances where the term has been used in the sense of \\"comfort women\\" in Korea, including a 1973 book, a 1946 newspaper article, and a name of two support organization for Korean comfort women. As a matter of fact, the tape recording of the comfort woman (who turned out to be Kim Hak-sun) which Uemura used for his article had been provided him by the support group that refers to the comfort women as \\"volunteer corps\\". While its official English name is The Korean Council for the Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery by Japan, its native Korean name is Han-guk Jeongsindae Munje Daechaek Hyeobuihoe which transliterates into Japanese as Kankoku Teishintai Mondai Taisaku Kyogikai\\" and literally means \\"The Korean Council to Address the Issue of the Volunteer Corps\\". The fact that Uemura obtained access to hear the tape from this organization is plainly stated in his August 11 article. When questioned in 2015, Uemura stated he could not ascertain if the term Joshi Teishin-tai (\\"women volunteer corps\\") actually appeared in the tape of Kim Hak-sun's testimony he listened to, since he did not retain a copy of the tape, leaving possibility the open that Kim did not use the term in the tape. As Uemura has pointed out, Kim Hak-sun was subsequently quoted as saying \\"I belonged to the volunteer corps\\" in such Korean Newspapers as the Joongang Ilbo. but Kim was also being introduced to the world at large as someone who was conducted away under the pretext of \\"volunteer corps\\" by Professor who headed the support organization, and Yun was the intermediary who spoke to Uemura and provided access to the tape, and additionally, Yun recounted her own experience where she withdrew from college because her parents feared she could be coerced into joining the \\"women's volunteer corps\\". There was admittedly a popular notion that the \\"volunteer corps\\" was linked with the Japanese government implementing forced deployment of Korean women as sex workers, but this was strictly a rumor according to critics of the \\"paradigm\\" that the comfort women were forced, and if the brothel positions were being lied to as factory jobs, such misrepresentations were only undertaken by Korean human traffickers rather than the Japanese \\"colonial authorities\\" according to these critics. = Alleged suppression of Kim's kisaeng background = Three days after Uemura's article, Kim Hak-sun held her press conference August 14, 1991 attended by The Hokkaido Shimbun and Korean media where she revealed she attended a kisaeng school for three years, starting at the age of 14. Subsequently on August 15, the Korean newspaper The Hankyoreh wrote a piece revealing that Kim \\"was sold to a kisaeng school (gwonbeon; ) in Pyongyang at the age of 14 by her mother, and taken away (some years later) by her gwonbeon foster-father. Ms. Kim, who finished her three- year training, thought it was her first job and was taken by her foster-father in front of a unit with over 300 Japanese troops in North China\\". It was alleged by Professor Tsutomu Nishioka in articles written by the reporter for the Sh≈´kan Bunshun weekly tabloid that Uemura must have been privy to the information about Kim's kisaeng background but had deliberately suppressed it. In 2014, Uemura stated that he had not heard her mention the kisaeng school background in the tape, and in October 2019, the tape was produced as evidence to the Tokyo District Court, revealing that the word kisaeng went unmentioned. = Pressures and threats of harm = Uemura left the Asahi Shimbun in March 2014, to pursue a second career as university lecturer. When the anti-Asahi bashing started faulting them for the comfort women coverage, Uemura became the target alongside. Hokusei Gakuen University in Sapporo, in northern Japan, where he lectures, has come under pressure to fire him. The college was bombarded by anonymous letters demanding his removal. \\"Many Japanese-language users of social media such as Twitter and Facebook have joined in the drubbing of the Asahi, accusing it of ‚Äúdamaging‚Äù Japan‚Äôs reputation\\", according to The Japan Times. This conduct has escalated into blackmail in the case of extremists among social media users. There has even been a bomb threat on this Hokkaido campus, blamed on ultra-nationalists; There has also been a call to drive Uemura's teenage daughter into suicide, which also has been attributed to the ultra-right. = Libel suits = In articles which ran in the weekly tabloid Sh≈´kan Bunshun condemning Uemura, Professor Tsutomu Nishioka who was one of the sources, accused Uemura of engaging in willful \\"fabrication\\".http://agora- web.jp/archives/1478590.htmlhttp://shukan.bunshun.jp/articles/-/3596 Uemura has since initiated legal proceedings over the public accusation against its publisher, the Bungeishunj≈´ publishing company.https://news.yahoo.com/japan- ex-reporter-files-lawsuit-over-comfort-women-055457915.html On January 9, Uemura filed a defamation suit with the Tokyo District Court against Nishioka, then-professor of Korean studies at Tokyo Christian University, and Bungeishunj≈´, Ltd. (the publisher of Sh≈´kan Bunshun) in response to the public accusations against him. The suit focused on three claims made by Nishioka: first, that Uemura's depiction of Kim being \\"taken away under the name of the 'women volunteer corps'\\" as involving a misnomer and constituting a fabrication of facts; second, that Uemura knowingly suppressed Kim's background as a kisaeng in training to alter the story of her becoming comfort women that was different from the truth, third, that Uemura had written his piece to influence the impending class-action lawsuits by former comfort women because Uemura' Korean mother-in-law headed a comfort women support organization involved in this litigation. Uemura provided the following counterarguments to these points. The term \\"volunteer corps\\" at least was indeed used as synonym for comfort women in Korea and not a term conjured up by him. Kim being sent to kisaeng school and she being turned into comfort women were two separate events. On the third point, he said he accepted the assignment based on a lead given him by the Seoul bureau chief of his newspaper (not at his mother-in-law's behest), and he denied having written the piece to fulfill ulterior motives that Nishioka accused him of. Uemura's mother-in-law Yang Sun-Im is a Korean activist who heads the Association for the Pacific War Victims. Yang was charged with fraudulently misleading donors to her organization, but has been acquitted, according to Uemura.

He was one of the most important representatives of surrealism in Finland. Mysticism and absurdist humor were central to his work. Biography Alpo Jaakola matured as an artist in the surrealism-tinged atmosphere of Turku School of Fine Arts. His early work emanates covert and sombre mysticism, examining the link between the self and the subconscious. Jaakola's interest in different eras and genres of art became evident early on and he developed into a genuine \\"total artist\\" ‚Äì simultaneously a \\"mystical splinter light painter\\" and an \\"anarchistic junk metal-concrete dadaist\\". In 1977, a documentary film about Jaakola was released. The film won a Jussi Award. The Alpo Jaakola Statuary Park In 1992, the Alpo Jaakola Statuary Park was opened to the public in Loimaa, Finland. The Statuary Park is the result of many decades of creative work and a monument of Alpo Jaakola's artistic power. Art exhibitions, cultural events, theater plays, concerts and festivals are organized continuously. Alpo Jaakola himself is interred in the Statuary Park.

The site was inhabited during the Animas phase (1200-1350 A.D.); it may have also had a Mimbres phase occupation in 1000-1150 A.D. The site's most distinctive feature consists of two stone lines, each roughly long and separated by a gap. While the purpose of the lines is uncertain, they may have demarcated a court for some sort of ball game. The site also includes a large lithic scatter and numerous ceramic fragments.National Register of Historic Places Registration Form: LA 54049 (restricted). National Park Service. The site was added to the National Register of Historic Places on January 23, 1993.

Bednar knew Daynes only through online gaming and had never met him in person until he visited Daynes's flat on the day of the murder. Daynes pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 25 years.  Victim  Bednar was a student at St Bede's School in Redhill in Surrey, and a member of the Air Training Corps 135 Squadron also in Redhill. He attended St John the Evangelist church in Caterham. His mother described him as relaxed and warm-hearted, with many friends with whom he played games online after school, and passionate about computing. Bednar's parents, Barry Bednar and Lorin LaFave, were born in the United States. The family moved to England from the United States three years before Breck's birth. Barry Bednar, 49, is an oil trader and shipping consultant, described by some sources as a millionaire. Lorin LaFave, 48, is a teaching assistant. In 2014 the Evening Standard reported that the family lived with their three children ‚Äì Breck's younger siblings ‚Äì in a family home in Caterham.  Circumstances of death  Bednar's mother, Lorin LaFave, was reported to have \\"limited his access to electronics, installed parental controls and forbade him from using the same server as a boy she had grown suspicious of.\\" She recalled, \\"His personality was changing and his ideology was changing and he was starting to refuse to attend church with us. I felt like it was because of the negative influence of this person.\\" According to the Daily Mail, Bednar had been introduced to the 'exclusive' six-person online gaming club at a church youth group. Bednar's mother described Lewis Daynes as controlling the group, with the power to expel members, owning and controlling an Internet chat channel on which members would communicate by voice. She told the Daily Mail that Daynes had told her son improbable stories, such as donating $2.5 million in bitcoin to Syrian rebels, and had told members they did not need to finish school because he would arrange ¬£100,000 computer technology jobs for them. In December 2013, Breck's mother called Surrey Police expressing concerns about online grooming; she said she warned police that her son was in danger. Nonetheless, it was reported, \\"The teenagers had been playing games online for several months, despite LaFave's efforts to put an end to their relationship.\\" Bednar travelled by taxi to Daynes' flat. On the day of Bednar's death, his father, with whom he had been expected to spend the weekend, sent a text message to tell LaFave that Breck had not arrived. A few hours later his siblings, 12-year-old triplets, began to receive messages that their brother had been killed, describing photos of Bednar that had been posted to social media, which were soon confirmed by the police. The photos, showing Bednar's body, were posted to other members of the six-person online gaming group. Word spread, leading to a friend's text message to one of the triplets, \\"Is it true about your brother? If it's true, it's so sad.\\" At the same time, police were telling Bednar's parents the news that their son had been murdered. Police and paramedics were called to the flat where Bednar was found with stab wounds to his neck, but were unable to prevent him from dying at the scene.  Perpetrator  According to BBC News, \\"Lewis Daynes, 19, of Rosebery Road, Grays, was due to stand trial at Chelmsford Crown Court on a charge of murder but admitted the offence\\" before the jury was sworn. Sentencing by Mrs Justice Cox was scheduled for 12 January 2015. Daynes, an unemployed computer engineer, was believed to have met Bednar while playing online video games. The Daily Telegraph described Daynes as a 'baby-faced killer' who looked 'much younger than his 19 years'. Daynes was reported by the Daily Mirror to have grown up as an only child, and after his parents split when he was 16 he lived alone in a flat owned by his grandparents; his neighbours described him as 'reclusive'. Prosecutor Richard Whittam, QC, told the court, \\"The prosecution case was that at the time of his murder Breck was aged 14. The law makes specific provision for the murder of a child involving sexual or sadistic motivation. The prosecution has advanced the case on that basis and anticipate doing that again on the date of sentence.\\" Simon Mayo, QC, mitigating, said Daynes had Asperger syndrome which \\"affects his ability to make sound judgments.\\" Mayo also argued that there was not enough evidence to prove that the murder had been premeditated. Daynes was given a life sentence with a minimum 25-year term. Crown Prosecutor Jenny Hopkins said: \\"Our case was that Lewis Daynes, even though he was only 18 when he committed Breck's murder, was a controlling and manipulative individual who carefully planned this crime. The degree of planning and manipulation by Daynes is shocking and when you consider the young ages of perpetrator and victim, it stands out as one of the most cruel, violent and unusual cases we have dealt with.\\".  Legacy  Bednar's family established The Breck Foundation to raise awareness of online dangers and promote responsible use of the Internet. His mother was quoted by the BBC: \\"I want Breck's tragedy to open the eyes of everyone to recognise the dangers of online predators. It is a very real danger today. We all need to look after each other.\\" His mother asked his favourite band, Coldplay, to help raise awareness of online dangers. She told ABC News, \\"People think it only happens to anti-social kids, but it's just not true.\\" Ms LaFave has called for \\"more help from the government for online safety\\", saying that she had expected more feedback from Surrey Police and adding, \\"I also wasn't recommended to contact CEOPC (Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre), which I found out ‚Äì when it was too late ‚Äì is a really great agency that would help parents.\\" After Daynes' plea in court, Assistant Chief Constable Gavin Stephens said the handling of Bednar's case by Surrey Police had been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC): \\"Following Breck's death we carried out a review of practices in our call handling centre and implemented changes to improve the way information is handled and shared. Due to the prior contact the case was referred to the IPCC. They have since decided to conduct an independent investigation into the actions taken by Surrey Police following this communication.\\" According to ABC News, the family was \\"filing a lawsuit against Essex and Surrey police over the handling of the case.\\" In March 2016, the family accepted a settlement in which Surrey Police apologised for their mishandling of the case, and paid an undisclosed sum in compensation. On 26 January 2016, BBC Three broadcast a drama-documentary about the murder entitled Murder Games: The Life and Death of Breck Bednar. https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p03cgtx5 It was alleged, in January 2016, that Daynes had been blogging from prison. In March 2018, in the U.S., the story was depicted on the Investigation Discovery channel in the 'Dangerous Games' episode of the Web of Lies series. In 2015, Bednar's murder was featured in the US series Stalkers Who Kill in the episode titled \\"Babyface Killer\\". In 2019, a new play, written by Mark Wheeller and using the words of his friends and family, tells the story of how the teenager was groomed online.

Loosely inspired by Goethe's Faust, it tells the story of Marcellus Faust and his battle of wills with the demon Mephistopheles. Faust began development in late 1998. Designed primarily as a cultural object rather than a game, it was Arxel Tribe's second project derived from German Romantic literature, following Ring. The team's goal was to make a unique, transgressive adventure for adults, with the episodic structure of a television series such as The Twilight Zone or The Kingdom. Arxel drew inspiration from the many interpretations of the Faust legend and sought to create its own version for modern day. Faust underwent one year of development by a team of 30 people, split between France and Slovenia, and ultimately cost ¬£700,000. Its budget was increased by the use of music licensed from Universal, including recordings by Stan Getz and Sarah Vaughan. Although it attracted a cult fan following, Faust was a major commercial flop. Gameplay The player stands atop an earth shelter home in Dreamland. The inventory menu has been opened and runs across the top of the screen, while the cursor rests in the lower third. The game has generic features of post- Myst adventure games. Players pass many 360 panoramic screens, and by clicking on objects and manipulating items, they can progress through the level. The aim of each of the seven levels is to reveal secrets about the sins each person has committed. Once this is achieved, a cutscene will play and the player will commence the next level. Plot The player assumes the role of an elderly African American man named Marcellus Faust. He finds himself in an abandoned amusement park called Dreamland where he meets a mysterious man named Mephistopheles. He explains that he and \\"the boss\\" are arguing over what should happen to seven souls, and tells you that your job is to arbitrate their cases - to look over the evidence and decide if they are guilty or innocent. Through the journeys of the seven characters, the game aims to reveal insights and observations about human nature. At the very end it is revealed that you, not Mephistopheles, is the devil; you have had your memory wiped so you can look over these cases objectively. He is given the opportunity to swap roles with the owner of the park. Development Arxel Tribe began development of Faust in late 1998. The game was a collaboration between Anne Carri√®re Multimedia, Cryo Interactive and Arxel, and production work was split between Paris and Ljubljana, Slovenia. Stephen Carri√®re, son of Anne Carri√®re and co-founder of Arxel Tribe, served as writer and creative director of the project. Faust was devised as one entry in Cryo Interactive's series of literature- and myth-based titles, begun by the company after its success with Atlantis: The Lost Tales. Arxel's game consequently followed the series' overarching design formula, in which \\"the content was definitely more important than the technology\\", according to Cryo's Stephane Ressot. Faust co- writer B√©ryl Chanteux likewise argued that Arxel's goal was not to make \\"the game for the game\\": she reported that Fausts \\"cultural content\\" was its driving force. By December 1998, the title was set to launch in October 1999. Goethe's literary work of the same name. Working from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's play Faust, Arxel Tribe continued its trend of adapting the literary output of German Romanticism, in line with its Richard Wagner-inspired Ring in 1998. However, originality was a main goal for Faust. Arxel's Guillaume de Fondaumi√®re remarked that the team sought to \\"stake out a new type of quest\\" in the gaming medium. Fr√©d√©ric Dufresne of G√©n√©ration 4 noted that Arxel opted for a looser style of adaptation with Faust than it had with Ring, and Carri√®re said that Fausts structure and core ideas were \\"even crazier\\" than those of its experimental predecessor. According to Carri√®re, the team drew influence from the many retellings of Faust's story, including Doctor Faustus by Thomas Mann, The Master and Margarita by Mikhail Bulgakov and The Tragical History of the Life and Death of Doctor Faustus by Christopher Marlowe. In turn, Arxel \\"tried to offer a new contemporary reading\\" of the myth that suited modern times. Faust was built from a 100-page design document written by Carri√®re, which outlined the environments, characters and available actions in each scene throughout the game. The project's episodic structure was based on the model of a television series; each segment was initially meant to end with a credits sequence. By February 1999, the seven episodes of Faust were planned as the first installments in a series of 21‚Äîan episodic release format, set to continue after the game's launch, that Carri√®re called \\"a new approach of adventure\\". He compared the concept to The Twilight Zone and Profit, and to the miniseries The Kingdom by Lars von Trier. The results were intended for an adult audience: Carri√®re told Lib√©ration that Faust was written to be \\"a transgressive game, offbeat and ironic\\". Similarly, de Fondaumi√®re said that it was an attempt to make a uniquely \\"anxious, disturbing\\" adventure unlike other games in its field. The role of Mephistopheles, portrayed as a dandy, was intentionally steeped in moral relativism. In retrospect, de Fondaumi√®re described him as Fausts true protagonist. The Faust team numbered above 30 members and the development cycle lasted one year, with 10 months of production. Arxel Tribe worked with the CINview engine, written by the company during its creation of Ring and Pilgrim: Faith as a Weapon, to generate Fausts rotatable 360¬∞ panoramas. The cutscenes were animated on Silicon Graphics hardware, and they employ Arxel's proprietary CINmovie technology to allow playback up to 25 frames a second. Pre-rendering was used to create most of the game's visuals. Each character in Faust began as a design on paper, which was then developed as a physical sculpture that the team digitized via 3D scanning. Thereafter, motion capture animation was applied. The final budget for Faust totaled 6.2 FF million, or around ¬£700,000. This was a sizable cost for a French adventure game, although de Fondaumi√®re considered it small in comparison to American titles. According to Chanteux, Fausts expenses were raised by its technology and licensed music, the latter provided by the Universal Music Group. Featuring what The Independent called \\"a cool jazz emphasis\\", the Faust soundtrack contains recordings by Sarah Vaughan, Mel Torm√© and Stan Getz, among others. Faust first launched in October 1999, on four CD-ROMs. In Sweden, it was distributed by IQ Media, with actors such as Reine Brynolfsson and Pernilla August in its voice cast. Nival handled the Russian version, brought to shelves in April 2000, while the Czech edition was released in early 2001 by Bohemia Interactive. The latter was significantly delayed by difficulties with dubbing and translation. In the United States, Faust was retitled Seven Games of the Soul and published by DreamCatcher Interactive, which launched the game on November 17, 2000. Reception Faust failed commercially. John Walker of Rock, Paper, Shotgun wrote that the game \\"was an enormous flop, selling fewer than 10,000 copies\\". In the United Kingdom, it was among a string of bombs by Cryo Interactive: the company's entire line sold only 42,000 units in the region during 2000, which led it to cease its British publishing operations. Market research firm PC Data estimated Fausts North American retail sales during 2000 as 4,500 copies, of which 4,429 derived from December. During 2001, the firm tallied another 9,794 retail sales of the game in North America. Despite the title's poor sales, de Fondaumi√®re was nevertheless pleased with Fausts critical reception, and he said that the game drew a cult fan following. Metacritic reported that Faust received \\"mixed or average reviews\\" from critics. GameSpot criticised the game, writing \\" The real problem with Seven Games of the Soul is that it's not only nonsensical, but it's also pretentious. \\" IGN mirrored this view, commenting \\"The box for Seven Games of the Soul promises a game rich with story and immerse atmosphere an adventure that simply oozes inexplicable style and vivid imagery through exotic locations, dark mystery and quirky characters. The truth is, however, that this game makes no freakin' sense whatsoever\\". While questioning the contextual relevance of the musical choices, the latter site also praised Mephisto's character as being \\"wonderfully acted\\". Adventure Gamers offered a more favourable analysis, concluding: \\"A philosophically ambitious game that distinguishes itself from the crowd. A rewarding experience, but expect plenty of confusion along the way\\", praising its \\"unique, complex premise; atmospheric, multi-layered mystery; high production values; excellent music; nice puzzle variety\\". =Awards= The editors of Eurogamer nominated Faust for their Gaming Globes 2000 awards in four categories: \\"Cinematography\\", \\"Adapted Storyline\\", \\"Male Lead Character\\" and \\"Male Supporting Character\\". Mephistopheles ultimately won the editors' choice in the final category; the other awards went variously to Outcast, Final Fantasy VIII and Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine. In Russia, Game.EXE named Faust the best-localized game of the year, praising Nival's \\"fanatical professionalism\\" compared to other Russian game translators' loose and informal work at the time. The voice cast received similar plaudits. Game.EXEs editors also presented Faust with their \\"Best Scenario\\" award, which it shared with four other titles, including The Longest Journey. Legacy During the first years after Fausts release, Eurogamer's John Bye recalled it as \\"one of the best adventure games of 1999\\" and a \\"truly excellent\\" title. In 2001, Guillaume de Fondaumi√®re retrospectively told Game.EXE that Faust was \\"very dear to all of us\\" at Arxel Tribe, despite its commercial performance. Adventure Gamers later named it the 94th-best adventure game released by 2011. The site's staff lauded Fausts uniqueness and depth, and singled out its soundtrack for praise. In 2018, John Walker offered a less positive lookback at Faust, as he disliked Cryo Interactive's entire catalogue of releases. Nevertheless, he argued that Faust was somewhat superior to Cryo's and Arxel Tribe's other output, and called it \\"not all that dreadful.\\" Faust was one of many pop culture interpretations of its source material during the 1990s, including a board game (Doctor Faust) designed by Reinhold Wittig and \\"all manner of musical Faust adaptations\\", according to writer J. M. van der Laan. He grouped Arxel Tribe's Faust with other work that used Goethe's play as \\"window-dressing for mindless entertainments or marketing products such as lipstick, shampoo, cigars, even beer.\\" Author Edwin Gentzler called Arxel's project part of a trend in games and comics that focused on the play's \\"theme of the competition between God and the Devil for Faust's soul.\\" He noted that the Faust legend's prominence in games like Faust led to its being \\"culturally ingrained at a young age\\", among players who otherwise had no knowledge of Goethe's work.

It is a social wasp that demonstrates two different types of nesting strategies, depending upon context. This context-dependent trait makes Mischocyttarus mexicanus cubicola a good model to study social biology within social wasps. In detail, this trait allows for the females of this species to form nests both individually and as co-founders with other females within the same colony.‚ÄúNest Usurpation and Intercolonial Cannibalism in Mischocyttarus mexicanus (Hymenoptera: Vespidae).‚Äù Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society. 68(1):67-73. This subspecies is also known to exhibit cannibalism, with M. m. cubicola queens feeding on their own larvae for nourishment when unaided by workers. Taxonomy and phylogeny Mischocyttarus mexicanus cubicola is part of the family Vespidae, which classifies the species as a wasp. Wasps, including M. m. cubicola are classified under the order of Hymenoptera, making ants, bees, and sawflies, which fall under the same order, relatives of wasps. It then falls under the subfamily Polistinae, which is home to paper wasps specifically.\\"Subspecies Mischocyttarus Mexicanus Cubicola.\\" Welcome to BugGuide.Net! -BugGuide.Net. Web. 3 Dec. 2014.. The genus of this species, Mischocyttarus, is the largest social wasp genus with 189 species and 15 subspecies.Hermann, Henry R., and Jung Tai Chao. \\"Distribution of Mischocyttarus (Monocyttarus) mexicanus cubicola in the United States.\\" Florida Entomologist(1984): 516-520. Mischocyttarus mexicanus cubicola is one of two subspecies in the species mexicanus, the other subspecies being Mischocyttarus mexicanus mexicanus. Description and identification In general, the genus Mischocyttarus can be identified by the asymmetrical internal and external lobes of the thetarsal segments in adults. Similarly, mature Mischocyttarus larvae are identified by appendix-like projections extending forward from the abdominal sternum.Silveira, OT. (2008). ‚ÄúPhylogeny of wasps of the genus Mischocyttarus de Saussure (Hymenoptera, Vespidae, Polistinae).‚Äù Revista Brasileira de Entomologia. 52(4):510-549. M. m. cubicola is similar to other species such as M. flavitarsis and M. angulatus as they all have a sharp secondary margin on their pronotum, the dorsal surface of the prothorax. Males are seen to have short, thick antennae and females have a head plate, called a clypeus, with a falttened apex. The M. mexicanus species is usually orange-yellow in color, and the subspecies cubicola has yellow stripes on the mid tibia and hind tibia base. The metasoma of this subspecies is reddish in color with yellow bands. Distribution and habitat Mischocyttarus mexicanus cubicola is found to habit in primarily neotropical and temperate areas. M. m. cubicola nests have been found in the US states of Florida, Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina. Later, the subspecies was found to extend into Texas as well, as females were spotted in Bellaire, Houston.Carpenter, JM, Hunt, JH, Strassmann, JE. (2009). ‚ÄúMischocyttarus mexicanus cubicola: Major Extension of Its Range to Texas (Hymenoptera: Vespidae).‚Äù Entomologica Americana. 115(1):95-96. This subspecies has also been found in other countries as well, such as Cuba, the Bahamas, and Puerto Rico. In the southernmost part of its range, Mischocyttarus mexicanus cubicola nests through the year, whereas in the more temperate regions, it hibernates during the winter season. This species is common, as it belong to the genus Mischocyttarus, which is the largest social wasp genus with 189 species and 15 subspecies. Colony cycle The nests of Mischocyttarus mexicanus cubicola can be founded by anywhere from one to twenty females. Even through there is an early and late period for nests, the nests can be initiated during any part of the year. The founders of new nests are usually born at the same time and the nests they found are not too far from their natal nest site.Strassmann, JE, Queller, DC, & Sol√≠s, CR. (1995). ‚ÄúGenetic relatedness and population structure in the social waspMischocyttarus mexicanus (Hymenoptera: Vespidae).‚Äù Insectes Sociaux. 42:379-383. Each nest can have one or more queens and in addition there is a range of female sexual development. With that said, most females have the capability of becoming a queen, as most are reproductively viable. These nests have combs of open cells that consist of paper that attached to leaves by a stem. The life cycle of the nest can be divided into two stages: pre-daughter and post-daughter stages, also known as pre-eclosion and post-eclosion nests.Litte, M. (1977). ‚ÄúBehavioral Ecology of the Social Wasp, Mischocyttarus mexicanus.‚Äù Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology. 2(3):229-246. The lifetime of a nest is estimated to be around eight months, although many nest disintegrate before this.Clouse, R. (2001). ‚ÄúSome effects of group size on the output of beginning nests of Mischocyttarus mexicanus(Hymenoptera: Vespidae).‚Äù Florida Entomologist. 84(3):418-424.  Communication  Communication via biting is frequently seen to occur between nestmates of Mischocyttarus mexicanus cubicola. The foragers of pleometrotic nests were found to be the least aggressive individuals of a given colony. It has also been observed that the females with the least developed ovaries were the ones that did the most foraging in a given colony. In addition, it has been hypothesized that as M. mexicanus cubicola individuals age, they accumulate a specific odor, which aligns with the observation that older female wasps are usually rejected from foreign nests.Neves, EF, Andrade, LHC, S√∫arez, YR, Lima, SM, & Antonialli-Junior, WF. (2012). ‚ÄúAge-related changes in the surface pheromones of the wasp Mischocyttarus consimilis (Hymenoptera: Vespidae).‚Äù Genetics and Molecular Research. 11(3):1891-1898. It has also been found that male individuals of this species have exocrine gland cells in their gastral sternites, which supports the idea the M. m. cubicola uses chemicals for communication such as nest-mate recognition and pheromone signaling.Post, DC & Jeanne, RL. (1982). ‚ÄúSternal Glands in Three Species of Male Social Wasps of the Genus Mischocyttarus(Hymenoptera: Vespidae).‚Äù Journal of the New York Entomological Society. 90(1):8-15. Nesting tactics There are two stable nesting strategies found within this subspecies: haplometrosis and pleometrosis. Haplometrosis is the single-foundress nesting strategy and pleometrosis is the strategy that involves multiple cofoundresses. Both tactics are found to be stable in this species because they are context-dependent traits; each strategy is favorable in certain conditions.Mora-Kepfer, F. (2014). ‚ÄúContext- dependent acceptance of non-nestmates in a primitively eusocial insect.‚Äù Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology. 68:363-371. This trait is also suggested to be plastic, as an adult female can switch nesting tactics as an adult depending on the context.Gunnels IV, CW, Dubrovskiy, A, & Avalos, A. (2008). ‚ÄúSocial interactions as an ecological constraint in a eusocial insect.‚Äù Animal Behavior. 75:681-691. Haplometrosis is found most commonly in the winter and spring, whereas pleometrosis is found frequently in the fall. Haplometrotic nests are victim to greater mortality, as eighty percent of haplometrotic nests fail within twenty days. It has been thought that larger females are more likely to be single foundresses in the spring and cofoundresses in the summer. In addition, when the number of potential habitats in a give area is experimentally decreased, the nests are more likely to be constructed by pleometrosis and the converse has also been found to exist as well.  Nest usurpation  When a queen is removed from a nest, it has been observed over the course of a week that the eggs and larvae gradually disappear. During this time, no new cells are constructed in the nest and at the end of this time period, a subordinate wasp may begin the process of becoming the new queen by laying eggs. It has also been noted that non-residents are accepted into a nest when the nest is new and the non-resident wasp is young. With that said, older nests tend to disallow non-residents and older wasps are usually not allowed to join colonies. It has also been hypothesized that this species might be a brood parasite, cannibalizing on eggs of foreign nests and placing their own eggs in an empty cell of the foreign nest. These observations suggest that the M. mexicanus species reject foreign wasps based on the risk of nest usurpation. Social structure Females within M. mexicanus cubicola colonies are at different levels of ovary development and although there are usually one or more queens in a given colony, many females are reproductive viable within the colony. Females are highly variable after a nest is founded, as one may become the queen (the primary reproductive female) while the others become subordinates. Consequently, due to the high variability in females, nest switching is common where if a queen is removed, a resident may quickly replace her over the course of a week. Even though females within a colony are of quite low levels of relatedness, some nests are pleometrotic perhaps due to reduced development times, larger colony sizes, and reduced mortality rates in these cofoundress nests. Lobe erection Mischocyytarus larvae can be distinguished from other wasps by having a one-, two-, or three-pointed lobe on the ventral surface of the first abdominal segment. It has been hypothesized that these abdominal lobes play a role in feeding, with similar morphology to the trophthyllax of pseudomyrmcine ant larvae.Hunt, James H. \\"Lobe erection behavior and its possible social role in larvae ofMischocyttarus paper wasps.\\" Journal of insect behavior 1.4 (1988): 379-386. Later, it was also observed in a relative, M. drewseni, that the lobes did not play a role in feeding, but rather were involved in responding to saliva solicitation of a workers by either producing a droplet or secretion or if it did not have any secretion to yield, by going back into the cell and pulling its abdominal lobes over its head. Therefore, it has also been suggested that these lobes are of adaptive value to the behavior of saliva donorism. This behavior has also been noted in both male and female larvae of Mischocyttarus mexicanus cubicola. Cannibalism Intercolonial cannibalism is also found within the nests of the subspecies Mischocyttarus mexicanus cubicola, with foreign conspecific females having the ability to intrude on a nest once every five hours. It has been thought that conspecifics may pose the greatest threat to females rearing their young in nests. Nest usurpation and stealing brood from those nests to feed young select for ground nest founding in these paper wasps. The cannibalism of this species seems to show that when the queen is unaided by workers, she resorts to nourishing herself by feeding on her brood and their saliva rather than by foraging. Diet M. mexicanus cubicola has been observed to forage for both arthropod and nectar-based foods. In addition to queens exhibiting cannibalism by feeding on their own larvae, it has been hypothesized that this species preys on arthropod larvae as well. Additionally, females have been seen to forage on palmetto and Lyonia flowers. Males also have been found on flowers and frequently jump onto other M. m. cubicola wasps that are foraging the same flowers, which is hypothesized to be related to mating habits of the species.  Predators  Major sources of predation of Mischocyttarus mexicanus cubicola are birds such as wrens, blue jays, yellowthroats, cardinals, mockingbirds, and woodpeckers.Hermann, HR, Gonzalez, JM, & Hermann, BS. (1985). ‚ÄúMischocyttarus mexicanus cubicola (Hymenoptera), Distribution and Nesting Plants.‚Äù The Florida Entomologist. 68(4):609-614. Spiders such as Argiope aurantia and Nephila clavipes are also known to be predators of this species. Ant raids are also common to this species, even though it is rare that ants will raid a nest that hasn‚Äôt already been abandoned. With that said, it is most common that a single ant will encounter a nest and be successfully deterred. Ant species such as Campanotus floridanus, Crematogaster ashmeadi, and Pheidole floridana have been observed to raid live nests and eat the wasp colony‚Äôs brood.

The Archivio di Nuova Scrittura (Archive of New Writing, ANS) is a cultural association founded in 1988 in Milan, Italy by art collector Paolo Della Grazia. The archive preserves a large artistic and documentary heritage about any form of artistic expression featuring the use of both the word and the sign. Born from the encounter between Della Grazia and artist Ugo Carrega, in the 1990s the ANS became the main Italian research center on visual poetry, organizing exhibitions, meetings and other cultural events. In 1998 the Archivio di Nuova Scrittura was deposited in part at the Mart in Rovereto (library, archives and some artworks) and in part at the Museion in Bozen (artworks only). The artwork section of the ANS includes about 1,600 works by international artists at Mart and about 2,000 at Museion. The ANS archives preserve, apart from the internal archive of the association (ANS fonds), the Fraccaro-Carrega fonds, containing the papers of collector Marco Fraccaro and visual poet Ugo Carrega. The library section, preserved at Mart, contains more than 18,000 volumes, among them 600 artist's books and hundreds of futurist first editions, and 600 art magazines including about 300 international artist's magazines. History =The origins= Paolo Della Grazia got interested in the world of art at the half of the 1960s. By frequenting the San Fedele Cultural Center of Milan he came to know the work of the Nuova Figurazione art movement (composed of Fernando De Filippi, Paolo Baratella, Giangiacomo Spadari and Umberto Mariani) and acquired some of their works at the Studio Santandrea directed by Gianfranco Bellora. There he met Baratella, Vincenzo Accame, Gianni Bertini and Mauro Staccioli, whose works he started to collect. Through the exhibitions organized by Bellora, Della Grazia discovered the world of visual poetry, especially at the 1977 review he was able to catch the vastity of the Italian verbo-visual production of that period. There he met artist Ugo Carrega, who had theorized in 1967 the New Writing, an experimental form of writing that associates signs of different extraction, and then had founded the research centers Centro Suolo, Centro Tool, and in 1974 the Mercato del Sale (Salt Market). Through Carrega, Della Grazia was able to meet several exponents of visual poetry, among them Vincenzo Ferrari, Anna Oberto, Martino Oberto, Alik Cavaliere, Emilio Isgr√≤, Magdalo Mussio, Franco Vaccari, Walter Valentini, Emilio Tadini, and Emilio Villa. Della Grazia became a patron for Carrega, acquiring for the Mercato del Sale a new venue in Via Orti in Milan. Della Grazia moved his whole collection, that had become much larger through the years and included artworks, books and documents about any form of artistic expression that features the use of the word and the sign, to the same venue in Via Orti. The collection included works of visual poetry, concrete poetry, Lettrism, Fluxus, and complete bibliographies of Ezra Pound, James Joyce, and E. E. Cummings, authors in which Della Grazia identified the origins of verbo-visual experimentation. =The foundation= On 24 May 1988, Della Grazia founded the Associazione culturale per lo Scritturalismo (Cultural Association for Scripturalism), that after a few months acquired the name Archivio di Nuova Scrittura (Archive of New Writing), clearly influenced by Carrega's poetics. The office of the ANS was in Via Orti, in the same building of the Mercato del Sale, Della Grazia was president of the association, and Carrega was the director. The scientific committee of ANS included Della Grazia, Carrega, Vincenzo Accame, Vincenzo Ferrari, Vittorio Fagone, and Giorgio Zanchetti as secretary. The office of the ANS was opened in Autumn 1989. In the same period the ANS published the catalogue of the collection, containing essays by Della Grazia, Carrega, Accame, and Fagone. The collection was exhibited in the venue, and the inauguration featured Rossana Bossaglia, Gillo Dorfles, and Lea Vergine. In May 1991 the exhibition moved to the Cantonal Library in Lugano, Switzerland, presented by Tomaso Kemeny. At the beginning of the 1990s Carrega decided to abandon his activity and sold to Della Grazia the whole collection of the Mercato del Sale. The ANS also acquired the Anna Oberto fonds and then the Marco Fraccaro fonds, preserved at the Cairoli College in Pavia and containing several futurist books. =The 1990s= Paolo Della Grazia (standing) with artist Dick Higgins. In April 1990 the Archive exhibited Sei lirici della poesia visuale internazionale (Six Lyrists of International Visual Poetry), including works by Alain Arias-Misson, Ugo Carrega, Carlfriedrich Claus, Ian Hamilton Finlay, Tom Phillips, and Shohachiro Takahashi. The exhibition was then moved to the Cairoli College of the University of Pavia from 24 January to 7 February 1991, in collaboration with Marco Fraccaro. The following exhibition was Poesia concreta in Brasile (Concrete Poetry in Brazil), featuring works by Brazilian poets Augusto and Haroldo de Campos, and D√©cio Pignatari, members of the Noigandres group. The exhibition was opened on 21 March and lasted until 21 June 1991, then moved to the Palazzo Doria-Pamphili in Rome, in 1993 to the Museum of Contemporary Art in Marseille, to the Lyon Biennale and finally, in 1995, to the Accademia Carrara in Bergamo. In 1992 the ANS exhibited an anthology of the works of Martino Oberto, curated by Paula Mattoli and Giorgio Zanchetti and containing more than 40 artworks, documents, manuscripts and publications by the artist. On 1 June 1993 the new exhibition Linguaggio/immagine (Language/Image), curated by Adriano Altamira, opened at the ANS. It featured works by Vincenzo Accame, Irma Black, Vincenzo Ferrari, Ketty La Rocca, Arrigo Lora Totino, Magdalo Mussio, Maurizio Nannucci, Anna Oberto, Luca Maria Patella, Lamberto Pignotti, Sarenco, Adriano Spatola, and Luigi Tola. The exhibition was thought as a complement to the 1993 Venice Biennale, which was showing the works of nine artists of the ANS collection: Nanni Balestrini, Ugo Carrega, Giuseppe Chiari, Emilio Isgr√≤, Eugenio Miccini, Martino Oberto, Franco Vaccari, Patrizia Vicinelli, and Emilio Villa. Linguaggio/immagine also included works by Piero Manzoni, Emilio Scanavino, Vincenzo Agnetti, Alighiero Boetti, and several young artists such as Maurizio Arcangeli, Mariella Bettineschi, Gianni Gangai, Francesco La Fosca, and Alessandro Traina. From 28 February to 30 March 1994 the ANS exhibited Una colonna un bar una voce (A Column a Coffee Shop a Voice), organized in collaboration with the Venice Biennale. It exhibited the works by Nanni Balestrini, Franco Vaccari, and Patrizia Vicinelli that had been selected for the Biennale. The following exhibition was Oggetti di poesia (Objects of Poetry), dedicated to Emilio Villa. Lo spazio della scrittura (The Space of Writing), exhibited in the same year, included works by Vincenzo Accame, Nanni Balestrini, Irma Blank, Ugo Carrega, Luciano Caruso, Corrado D'Ottavi, Emilio Isgr√≤, Ketty La Rocca, Stelio Maria Martini, Eugenio Miccini, Magdalo Mussio, Anna Oberto, Martino Oberto, Luca Maria Patella, Lamberto Pignotti, Sarenco, Adriano Spatola, and Franco Vaccari. It was shown in Paris, France from 5 May to 25 May 1994, then in Lille from 31 May to 22 June, and finally at the Ignaz and Mischa Epper Foundation in Ascona, Switzerland from 30 July to 4 September 1994. A round table was also organized, featuring Nanni Balestrini, Paolo Fabbri, and Lamberto Pignotti. In 1995 there was a new exhibition about Terry Atkinson. In the 1990s the ANS organized frequent cultural events, including the series Parola e immagine (Word and Image, 1990), with Luciano Caramel, Vittorio Fagone, Vanni Scheiwiller, Emilio Tadini and Gillo Dorfles, Alfabeto in libert√† (Alphabet in Freedom, 1991) with Cesare Segre, Tomaso Kemeny, Rossana Bossaglia and Tullio Crali, a conference about Ezra Pound with Kemeny and Scheiwiller (1993), and a series of meetings about Futurism featuring Bossaglia, Caramel, Claudia Salaris, Enrico Crispolti, and Anty Pansera (1995). =The transfer to Mart and Museion= At the end of the 1990s Della Grazia noticed that the preservation and administration of the Archive were becoming too complicated and expensive to be managed by one person. Advised by Francesco Conz, he asked Pier Luigi Siena and Andreas Hapkmeyer of the Museion of Bozen to host the collection in their museum. However, the Museion did not have enough space for the entire ANS collection, so Della Grazia decided to involve Gabriella Belli, director of the Mart museum of Trento and Rovereto. The collection was then split, the Museion kept a larger part of the artworks, and the Mart kept some artworks and the whole archives and library of the ANS. In October 1998 Della Grazia made an agreement with Mart, and in February 1999 the archives and library were moved to the new venue. The ANS archives include, apart from the internal archive of the association, the Fraccaro-Carrega fonds containing the papers of art collector Marco Fraccaro and visual poet Ugo Carrega. The library of the ANS, preserved at the Mart museum, includes more than 10,000 volumes, among them 600 artist's books and hundreds of futurist first editions, and 500 art magazines including about 100 international artist magazines. It also includes essays about the history of writing, books about visual poetry, avant-garde magazines, and several rare works of Futurism, Dada, Surrealism, and other artistic movements. For instance, the Mart hosts the Libro imbullonato (Bolted Book) by Fortunato Depero (1927), Chimismi lirici (Lyrical Chemism) by Ardengo Soffici (1915), and the Litolatte by Tullio d'Albisola and Filippo Tommaso Marinetti. The Mart also preserves drawings and graphical artworks by artists such as Eugenio Miccini, Emilio Isgr√≤, Lamberto Pignotti, Anna Oberto, Martino Oberto, Vincenzo Ferrari, Magdalo Mussio, Rolando Mignani, Franco Vaccari, Walter Valentini, Alain Arias-Misson, Giuseppe Desiato, Alik Cavaliere, Emilio Tadini, Luca Maria Patella, Emilio Villa, and Giovanna Sandri. The ANS collection hosted by the Museion includes about 2,000 works by exponents of concrete and visual poetry, such as Shusaku Arakawa, Terry Atkinson, Franco Vaccari (conceptual art), Joseph Beuys, John Cage, Giuseppe Chiari, Dick Higgins, Ben Vautier, Wolf Vostell, Robert Watts (Fluxus). =The 2000s= After the transfer, Della Grazia continued to organize exhibitions and research. The books and documents hosted by Mart were lent to Poesie concrete brasilienne (Brazilian Concrete Poetry), held in Marseille, France in 2001, Alfabeto in sogno (Alphabet in Dreams) in Reggio Emilia, Italy in 2002, and Propaganda, cultura e mito nell'editoria italiana (Propaganda, Culture and Myth in Italian Publishing) held in Siracusa in 2004. In the same year the artist's books of ANS were lent to Deliberatamente. Il libro d'artista negli anni '60 e '70 (Deliberately. The Artist Book in the 1960s and 1970s) in Soncino and to Libri taglienti esplosivi luminosi (Sharp Explosive Bright Books), held in 2005 in Trento and 2006 in Bozen. In 2006 they were also shown in Bologna at the Primo amore. La passione di un collezionista (First Love. The Passion of a Collector) exhibition. On 10 November 2007 the Mart opened the La parola nell'arte (The Word in Art) exhibition, organized in collaboration with the Museion and curated by a committee headed by Giorgio Zanchetti and composed of Gabriella Belli, Achille Bonito Oliva, Andreas Hapkemeyer, Nicoletta Boschiero, Paola Pettenella, Melania Gazzotti, Daniela Ferrari, and Julia Trolp. The exhibition contained more than 800 artworks, both from the Mart and other international collections. On 23 May 2008 the Museion moved to a new building, and director Corinne Diserens curated the exhibition Sguardo periferico & corpo collettivo (Peripheral Look & Collective Body), including works by Gianfranco Baruchello, Joseph Beuys, Alighiero Boetti, George Brecht, G√ºnter Brus, John Cage, Calvin Sumsion, Paul de Vree, Jakov Dorfmann, John Heartfield, Marcel Duchamp, Arturo Schwarz, Ugo La Pietra, Piero Manzoni, Hermann Nitsch, Anna Oberto, Claudio Parmiggiani, Man Ray, Sarenco, Cy Twombly, Franco Vaccari, Ben Vautier, Robert Watts, Emmett Williams. In 2013 the Archive started the Verbo Visuale Virtuale project in collaboration with the Bruno Kessler Foundation, with the aim of building a digital archive of verbo-visual art. This project was made possible by a generous grant from the CARITRO Foundation (Trento, Italy).

In other cases, the lock was used to forbid unauthorized access to the computer by disabling the power supply, hard drive, or keyboard.

It is a part of the Tudor Poor Laws and reaffirms previous poor laws enacted in 1536, 1547, and 1549 which focused primarily on the punishment of vagabonds. 5&6 Edw. VI c. 2; ; The Poor Act of 1552 designated a new position, \\"collector of alms,\\" in each parish. Local authorities and residents elected two alms collectors to request, record, and distribute charitable donations for poor relief. It further provided that each parish would keep a register of all its ‚Äúimpotent, aged, and needy persons‚Äù and the aid they received. Parish authorities were directed to ‚Äúgently exhort‚Äù any person that could contribute but would not, referring them to the Bishop of the Diocese if they continued to refuse. Punishment for neglecting poor relief obligations was adopted in 1563 and reliance on charity was replaced by a system of taxation in 1597. Beier 1983, p. 41; Under the assumption that all poor would be cared for, begging openly was now forbidden.5&6 Edw. VI c. 2; Slack 1990, p. 59-60; Beier 1983, p. 40 Licensed begging would be reinstated by the Marian Parliament of 1555 with the requirement that legal beggars wear badges.;  Social context  During the Tudor period, cultural perceptions began to shift away from the medieval theological belief that poverty was a virtue. The philosophical influence of Renaissance humanismBeier 1983, p. 17; and the emergence of a Protestant work ethicBeier 1983, p. 14 and rogue literatureBeier 1983, p. 17 contributed to views encouraging industriousness and the stewardship of wealth and vilifying idleness, begging, and vagrancy. As poverty rates and the costs of poor relief rose, communities attempted to define and limit who qualified for aid, restricting support by locality and moral conduct.; Beier 1983, p. 23  Economic context  The rise of poverty rates during the Tudor period can be attributed to a confluence of factors. Rebellions in 1549 hampered harvest efforts and crop shortages in the following years contributed to price inflation. A series of coin debasements between 1544-1551 undermined economic confidence.; ; Jordan 1970, p. 459 Rapid population growth and the effects of Tudor enclosure policies led to the supply of labor exceeding demand and agricultural and industrial wages falling sharply. High birth-rates also meant a large percentage of the population were too young to contribute economically.Beier 1983, p.7; Wordie 1997 Additionally, the dissolution of the monasteries removed all Catholic Church-operated charities, religious guilds, and lay fraternities that provided formal and informal aid and confiscated parish lands and livestock which had also been used to provide poor relief. The process of replacing these institutions was often slow and uneven.; McIntosh 2005; Beier 1983, p. 19-23 References Category:English Poor Laws Category:Tudor England Category:1552 in law Category:1552 in England ","title":"Poor Act 1552"},{"id":"44581280","text":"Cirrhochrista annulifera is a moth in the family Crambidae.

Riddell was born in Tokomaru Bay in 1950 and began working with clay in the early 1970s, while living in Christchurch. His early work fits within the contemporary movement in New Zealand craft pottery, largely influenced by the Anglo-Orientalism of Bernard Leach and Japanese potters who were influential in New Zealand, such as Shoji Hamada. Riddell, who had become distant from his MƒÅori heritage, started putting MƒÅori motifs on his pots, and in 1974 he became a full-time potter, the first MƒÅori artist to commit to this profession. Riddell built his first kiln in Christchurch at this time, but soon moved back to the North Island, living in Central Hawkes Bay and Anaura Bay before settling in Tokomaru Bay in 1979. Here he sold work through a cooperative founded by Helen Mason, who introduced him to other potters, including Barry Brickell, Harry Davis and George Kojis as well as the artist Theo Schoon. Through his aunt, Ngoi Pewhairangi, who was working to revive traditional MƒÅori art and culture, Riddell also reconnected with his own heritage. Through the resurgent contemporary MƒÅori art movement at this time Riddell connected with other MƒÅori clay artists, including Colleen Waata Urlich and Manos Nathan and spent time working alongside them at workshops and hui (meetings). In 1986, with Manos Nathan, Riddell was a co-founder of NgƒÅ Kaihanga Uku, the national MƒÅori clayworkers‚Äô organisation in Aotearoa New Zealand. In 1989 he and Nathan were awarded a Fulbright Scholarship to establish an exchange with Native American artists. In 2011 he was awarded the Creative New Zealand Craft/Object Fellowship.

The first two-hour episode premiered on Lifetime on December 7, 2014; the second and final episode aired the next day. The series is based on the best-selling novel of the same name by Anita Diamant.About The Red Tent at MyLifetime.com Plot It is the time of the Old Testament patriarchs of the Book of Genesis. Dinah, the only daughter of Leah and Jacob, chronicles her story from youth through adulthood. She narrates her relationship with her parents, aunts, and eleven older brothers. She often focuses on the significance of the Red Tent, occupied by the women of her tribe (including Jacob's other three wives Rachel, Bilhah and Zilpah) during their time of menstruation. The women have kept alive their old traditions of goddess-worship unbeknownst to their Israelite husbands, managing to keep this secret since men are not allowed in the Red Tent. In the backstory, Jacob arrives at his uncle Laban's settlement to escape from his older brother Esau, and falls in love at first sight with his cousin Rachel. She reciprocates his feelings, as - secretly - does her sister Leah. Jacob asks Laban for permission to marry Rachel, offering his service to Laban in exchange. Rachel, fearing the consummation of the marriage, switches places with her sister at the wedding. Jacob and Leah share a passionate bridal night. The next morning, he pretends to be upset, informs Laban of the trick, and demands the right to marry Rachel, now upping the stakes by claiming Bilhah and Zilpah as compensation. Over the next several years, Leah, Bilhah, Zilpah give birth to several sons. Rachel remains childless, until she finally has a son, Joseph, who becomes Jacob's favorite. Soon after, Dinah is born to Leah, and is doted on by her family as the only girl. The tension between Jacob and Laban reaches its climax following the suicide of Laban's abused wife. Jacob takes his wives, children, and livestock, and departs to establish a new settlement. They encounter his estranged older brother, Esau, and the matriarch, Rebekah. Dinah finds her grandmother testy and ruthless towards lower-class civilians. Rachel is a talented midwife and takes her niece as apprentice. In an altercation and power struggle, Jacob barges into the Red Tent, and seizes and destroys the teraphim, the women's goddess figurines. After settling near the city of Shechem, Dinah and Rachel are called to the palace to assist at a birth. Despite her aunt's warning to guard her honor, Dinah meets and falls in love with Prince Shalem, son of the king. The two quickly decide to marry; the king approves, and the marriage is consummated. When he is told of this fait accompli, Jacob is furious that he has not been consulted, as the customs of his tribe expect. Leah blames Rachel for putting romantic fantasies into Dinah's head. Dinah's brothers, Simeon and Levi, interpret the events as seduction and defilement. All the men of the tribe feel insulted and dishonored. Shalem's father offers to pay any bride price they name, to make matters right, but they spurn his gifts. Joseph asks his brothers in exasperation if they want Prince Shalem's foreskin, and they seize on this suggestion, saying that the only thing that will satisfy their honor is for all the men of Shechem to be circumcised. Shalem and his father, to their surprise, agree, and all the men of the city undergo the operation. A couple of nights later, the brothers (but not Joseph) attack the palace while the men are in pain and unable to defend themselves, murdering Shalem, his father, and all the men they can find. Full of anger and grief, Dinah curses her father and brothers for their sins, and disowns them. Dinah is pregnant, and her formidable mother-in-law, an Egyptian princess, takes her to safety in Thebes. She gives birth to a son whom she names Bar-Shalem (son of the sunset). However, the Queen, blaming Dinah for the death of her son, claims the baby as her own, names him Ra-Mose and forbids Dinah from revealing the truth. Dinah tries to flee with her son but is caught and beaten into obedience. The Queen permits her to attend her son only as wetnurse and handmaid; she is forced to live as a slave for the next ten years, unwilling to leave him. Simeon and Levi, jealous of Jacob's favoritism towards Joseph, kidnap their brother and sell him into slavery, and then present his bloody coat as proof that he has been killed, devastating the family. After Ra-Mose is sent away to become a scribe, Dinah is released from the Queen's service, but she still chooses to stay in Thebes and waits another seven years for her son's return. In that time Joseph, who has the power of prophecy, is discovered by the Pharaoh; Joseph interprets his dream and is named the Vizier of Egypt, under the name Zaphnath-Paaneah. Ra-Mose returns to Thebes as the Queen is dying. She reconciles with Dinah by giving her the shawl that Shalem had given her at their first meeting. Ra-Mose discovers that Dinah is his mother, and that her brothers murdered his father. He feels that she is as guilty as they, and rejects her. With her purpose for staying in Thebes lost, Dinah leaves to start a new life. She marries a kind man named Benia, and begins to practise midwifery again. One day she is summoned to the palace: the wife of the vizier is having a difficult labor. The person summoning her is her son Ra-Mose and the vizier turns out to be her brother Joseph. After Joseph's wife has given birth to a boy, Ra-Mose begs his mother for forgiveness and asks Dinah to tell him the history of her family. Later that night, Dinah and Joseph reunite for the first time in years. Joseph informs Dinah that their mothers have died; Leah died three years prior, peacefully in her sleep, and Rachel died giving birth to a son, Benjamin. Overhearing their talk, Ra-Mose erroneously thinks that Joseph took part in his father's murder, and attempts to kill him before Dinah convinces him of his mistake. Enraged, Joseph orders his execution. Dinah pleads for her son to be spared and reminds Joseph of how much they have to carry the burden of their brothers' sins. At first Joseph refuses to listen, but finally relents and commutes the punishment to banishment. Ra-Mose must assume a new name, and chooses to take the one his mother had given him at birth, Bar-Shalem. Shortly after, they learn that Jacob is dying and wishes to see all of his children. Dinah initially refuses to see her father, but moved by Joseph's words about putting the past to an end, she agrees. Traveling with her brother and husband, she arrives in Migdal Eder and meets Benjamin for the first time. Dinah reconciles with Jacob in his final moments. Dinah visits the Red Tent to reminisce; the wives of her brothers and their daughters have kept her presence alive there. She leaves the Red Tent knowing that she will always have a place there with the memories and stories passed down through the generations. Finally at peace, she bids farewell to her extended family and returns to live the rest of her life at Thebes.

Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports a 75% approval rating with an average rating of 7.1/10 based on 12 reviews. The website's consensus reads, \\"While its premise isn't yet fully realized, The Red Tent boasts an appealing lead and enough energy to suggest greater promise.\\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 57 out of 100, based on 12 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews.\\" The Hollywood Reporter referred to The Red Tent as \\"an engaging and very well cast story of the triumph and resilience of the female spirit\\", but criticised the miniseries for casting white actors \\"exclusively in prominent and positive roles\\" while darker skinned actors were cast in more nefarious roles. Similarly, in her review for LA Times, Mary McManara noted that parts of the miniseries \\"wander close to parody ‚Äî Will Tudor's Joseph is a blue-eyed Botticelli in contrast to the Arabic swarthiness of his murderous brothers\\". Writing for The New York Times, Neil Genzlinger noted that \\"fans of the novel will no doubt watch and revel in this relatively big-budget treatment.

Normal tension glaucoma is in many cases closely associated with general issues of blood circulation and of organ perfusion like arterial hypotension, metabolic syndrome, and Flammer syndrome.  Clinical relevance  Over many years, glaucoma has been defined by an intraocular pressure of more than 20 mm Hg. Incompatible with this (now obsolete) definition of glaucoma was the ever larger number of cases that have been reported in medical literature in the 1980s and 1990s who had the typical signs of glaucomatous damage, like optic nerve head excavation and thinning of the retinal nerve fiber layer, while these patients had an IOP that would generally have been regarded as \\"normal\\". It is now widely estimated that a larger percentage of patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) are suffering from normal tension glaucoma: probably half of all POAG patients in Europe and the majority of POAG patients in East Asia. Among Americans of Japanese descent, for instance, the prevalence of NTG is about four times as high as the prevalence of the \\"classical glaucoma\\" with an IOP of 22 mm Hg and higher. The pillar of the current understanding of normal tension glaucoma is a reduced IOP tolerance of the retinal ganglion cells and the cells in the optic nerve head - an IOP of, for example, 17 or 19 mm Hg that would not affect a healthy eye leads to damage in the eye of an NTG patient.Mi XS, Yuan TF et al.: The current research status of normal tension glaucoma. Clinical Interventions in Aging 2014:9 1563‚Äì1571  Risk factors  In many patients, normal tension glaucoma is common in individuals with a generalized reduced perfusion of organs and certain body tissues. A low blood pressure - whether consistently low or with sudden pressure drops - is associated with NTG as are conditions like Flammer syndrome and obstructive sleep apnea.De Groot V.: Eye diseases in patients with sleep apnea syndrome. Bull Soc Belge Ophthalmol 2009; 312:43-51 Flammer syndrome has been attributed to increase the likelihood of ganglion cell damage in normal tension glaucoma patients with disc hemorrhages as a characteristic clinical sign.Kim KE, Park KH: Update on the Prevalence, Etiology, Diagnosis, and Monitoring of Normal-Tension Glaucoma. Asia Pac J Ophthalmol 2016;5: 23 ‚Äì 31. Besides race (Japanese) and low blood pressure, the female gender is also a risk factor.Maneli Mozaffarieh, Josef Flammer: New insights in the pathogenesis and treatment of normal tension glaucoma.Curr Opin Pharmacol 2013;13:43-49.  Diagnosis  While tonometry, the measuring of IOP and thus a classical instrument in the diagnosis of glaucoma, is not helpful, ophthalmoscopy leads to the diagnosis by showing typical glaucomatous damage, primarily at the optic nerve head, in the absence of elevated IOP. While the excavation of the optic nerve head and the thinning of its rim appear in all kinds of glaucoma (with high tension and with normal tension, in Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) and in secondary glaucoma), small hemorrhages close to the optic disc have been identified as a characteristic clinical sign of normal tension glaucoma. Visual field is very important to detect NTG. It shows a defect that typically appear deeper, steeper and closer to fixation comparing to patients with POAG. Since NTG is closely linked to vascular irregularities, a medical check-up by a general practitioner or a specialist in internal medicine is widely recommended in cases of newly diagnosed normal tension glaucoma. An examination that is considered to be of particular importance is a 24-hour monitoring of the blood pressure.Stephanie Mroczkowska, Alexandra Benavente-Perez et al.: Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma vs Normal-Tension Glaucoma. JAMA Ophthalmol. 2013 Jan;131(1):36-43 NTG patients tend to suffer \\"dips\\", sudden and unnoticed drops in blood pressure during sleep.  Treatment  Without treatment, NTG leads to progressive visual field loss and in the last consequence to blindness. The mainstay of conventional glaucoma therapy, reducing IOP by pressure-lowering eye drops or by surgery, is applied in cases of NTG as well. The rationale: the lower the IOP, the less the risk of ganglion cell loss and thus in the long run of visual function. The appearance of disc hemorrhages is always a warning sign that therapeutic approaches are not successful - the small bleedings, usually described as flame-shaped, almost always indicate a progression of the disease. Besides this classical glaucoma therapy, the vascular component that exists in the majority of NTG patients has to be managed as well. Dips in blood pressure or a generally low blood pressure have to be prevented - which is a rather uncommon approach in modern medicine where high blood pressure is always seen as an immense clinical challenge, affecting large segments of the population. In patients with systemic hypertension under therapy, the blood pressure should not be lowered too rigorously. NTG might be the only severe (= sight-threatening) disease caused in numerous cases by a too low blood pressure.Josef Flammer, Katarzyna Konieczka et al.: The eye and the heart. European Heart Journal 2013;34:1270-1278 Both magnesium and low dose calcium channel blockers have been employed in the treatment of some NTG patients.Maneli Mozafarrieh, Katarzyna Konieczka et al.: Calcium channel blockers: their use in normal tension glaucoma Expert Rev Ophthalmol 2010; 5:617-652 There are therapeutic approaches to underlying conditions like Flammer syndrome. A change in nutrition like the intake of sodium-rich foods has been tried as has the oral administration of low-dosed steroids. Lifestyle interventions are recommended in patients with Flammer syndrome like avoidance of fasting and certain stimuli like a cold environment and stress.Katarzyna Konieczka, Robert Rich et al.: Flammer syndrome.

The trade was mostly Siberian furs for Chinese cotton, silk, tobacco and tea. The earlier Nerchensk trade 1689‚Äì1722 Russia and China came into contact when in 1582‚Äì1639 Russians made themselves masters of the Siberian forests. The border in \\"Manchuria\\" was delineated by the Treaty of Nerchinsk in 1689. This treaty said nothing about Mongolia since this area was not yet under Chinese/Manchu control. The fifth article of the treaty allowed trade with proper documents but was otherwise vague. Russian merchants began organizing caravans from Nerchinsk to Peking, the round trip usually taking 10‚Äì12 months. In 1692‚Äì93 Eberhard Isbrand Ides went on a commercial-diplomatic mission to Peking. He left Peking in February 1694 and reached Moscow 11 months later. Peter the Great now decided that trade should be a state monopoly. There were 14 state caravans to Peking between 1689 and 1722.Foust, page 12. He gives no list Private trade continued, much of it going short distances to places like Urga and Tsitsihar. In 1721 Lorenz Lange estimated that the Urga trade alone was four times greater than the state caravans.Foust, page 14 The first state caravan left Moscow in 1697 and returned two years later. The fourth under Ivan Savateev left Moscow in 1702, used the usual Nerchinsk route but returned via Urga and Selenginsk which took only 70 days.G. Patrick March, Eastern Destiny, chapter 6 It carried a letter from the Lifanyuan suggesting that this become the standard route since Mongolia was now under Manchu control and local relations could be managed by the Tushetu Khan at Urga. There was a fifth caravan under Petr Khudiakov in 1705‚Äì09. The First Oirat-Manchu War had forced the Dzungar Khanate out of Mongolia and made border control more important. The journey of Tulishen in 1712-15 gave the Manchus more knowledge of the western regions. From 1717 the Manchus began to pressure the Russians to delineate the Mongol border. In 1717‚Äì20 Izmailov went to Peking to negotiate a trade treaty, but this failed because of the border problem. A caravan under one \\"Ifin\\" was stopped at the Great Wall and another under Fedor Istopnikov was detained in 1718. In 1722 the Manchus blocked trade until the border problem was settled. This led to the Treaty of Kyakhta. The foundation of Kyakhta Maimacheng in 1910 The Treaty of Kyakhta (1727) specified that all official trade between the two empires would pass through points near Kyakhta and Tsurukaitu on the Manchurian border. Tsurukaitu never became important because the Kyakhta route was much better than the long journey east from Lake Baikal. Before the treaty the Russians in the area were centered at Selenginsk and the Manchus worked through the Tushetu Khan at Urga. Kyakhta was the approximate point where the treaty was negotiated and the point where the border delimitation began. The Russians quickly built the post of Kyakhta at the border and the Manchus built the fort of Maimaicheng a few hundred feet south on their side. Officials on both sides dealt with diplomatic exchanges between the two empires, trade disputes and the usual police matters to be expected on a long border inhabited by nomads who cared little about rules imposed by distant empires. The chief Manchu official was called the Dzarguchei and Maimaicheng was managed by the Lifanyuan which dealt with the western grasslands. The Russians were mainly interested in trade and the Chinese mainly wanted to control the border and prevent Russian interference with their westward expansion toward the Dzungar Khanate. The Manchus would sometimes prevent trade to put pressure on the Russians. The longest interruption was 1785‚Äì92 over a Buryat robber that the Russians had failed to execute. Route Urga (Ulaanbaatar), Gobi Desert, Kalgan (Zhangjiakou) and Peking. Kyakhta is directly north of Urga The trade route followed the usual route to Irkutsk, by flatboat across Lake Baikal, and south by poling up the Selenge River past Selinginsk. Near the mouth of the Chikoy River at a place called Strelka or Petropavlovsk goods were loaded onto carts and carried south to Kyakhta where caravans were assembled or goods bartered. Much barter was done at Kyakhta during the winter and Chinese goods were shipped west when the rivers melted. From the 1760s the overland route from Yekaterinburg began to replace the Siberian rivers. When the ground was frozen solid this might take 70 or 80 days. Later in the century furs from Russian-America were sent via Okhotsk and Yakutsk to Kyakhta. To the south the route went south to Urga, southeast to Kalgan on the Great Wall and then Peking. The crossing of the Gobi took at least 30 to 40 days. The second state caravan followed the Kerulen River east, but this was not repeated. A round trip on the route might take from one to three years. The state caravans The treaty said that caravans would be three years apart. There were six state caravans from Kyakhta between 1727 and 1760. At Peking the caravan leaders dealt with diplomacy, the Russian church in Peking and the few Russian students who were there to learn Manchu and Chinese. The leader often had an audience with the Emperor. # 1727: Molokov, Lorenz Lange as diplomat: Outbound Sep-Dec1727,stayed in Peking 6 months, returned Jul- Sep1728. They set out with 205 men, 1,650 horses, 475 goods carts, 162 provision carts and 665 cattle for food. They had 285,404 rubles in goods including 2,100,000 pelts. Between Selenginsk and Kalgan they lost 489 horses and 258 cattle. At Kalgan they left their extra horses to be picked up on the way back. In Peking they stayed at the Russian House or O-lu-ssu Kuan. Numerous 'guards' soon appeared. Trade went slowly and the Russians blamed the Chinese officials. Before leaving Lange had an audience with the Emperor. They returned with 125,000 yards of silk, 570,000 yards of cotton, 30,000 pounds of tea (much less than later), 65,000 rubles in gold and silver and 404,000 unsold pelts. In 1731-33 excess goods were bartered at the border for about 125,000 rubles at Moscow prices. 335,301 rubles of Chinese goods were brought to Moscow for sale, some remaining unsold until 1735. Cost of caravan estimated at 62,687 rubles. # 1731: Molokov+Lange: Nov'31-Mar'32, returned Sep'32-Sep'33. 113 men, about 100,000 rubles in goods and 140,000 in coin. They returned with 214,699 rubles of Chinese goods at Moscow prices. Lange had another audience with the Emperor. Outbound, to avoid the Gobi desert, they followed the Kerulen River where they were robbed. They returned north to Tsurukaitu and were again robbed. The bandits were captured and the Manchus sent the heads of nine bandits to Kyakhta as a token of good will. The journey from Peking to Tsurukaitu lasted from Sep'32 to Apr'33. At Tsurukaitu they had difficulty finding storage space and laborers. It took them all summer to travel west to Irkutsk. This route was not used again. #1736: Firsov+Lange: Jul?36-Nov‚Äô36, return May-Aug'37. 100,000 rubles in goods. Goods sold in St Petersburg rather than Moscow. # 1741: Firsov: Jun-Sep'41 Apr42-?. About 100,000 rubles. Sold at St Petersburg # 1745: Lebratovsky: Aug45-Dec'45 Jun?46-? # 1753?: Vladykin ?-Dec'53?, Jul?54-? There were no further caravans because of the Dzungar wars. In 1762 Catherine replaced state caravans with free trade. Russian goods would be sold or bartered at Kyakhta. Goods and money There was some amount of illegal and informal trade, but we have no numbers. There were many regulations prohibiting the export of certain goods and making others a state monopoly. The regulations changed frequently. Trade was mostly by barter and both sides sometimes tried to prevent the export of coined money. Money Value The money value of goods had to be estimated, accounting practices were imperfect and there was some bribery. After the period of state caravans the value of goods exported was about: 1755:600,000 rubles, 1768: 1,000,000, 1780:2,700,000, 1800:4,200,000, 1805:5,700,000. Tax revenue was about 20% of exports. The Kyakhta trade was perhaps 7% of Russian foreign trade. Another writerAvery, page 132 says that the annual trade in 1824-30 was between 5.5 and 7.8 million rubles and by mid-century it had reached 16 million rubles, but it is not clear whether this is exports, imports or both. Exports Furs were 70-85% by value, with the percent tending to decline, especially as European-made goods increased. Squirrel was the largest by quantity, about 2-4 million pelts annually.Foust,page 346. Other historians of Siberia say little about squirrel, which seems strange Furs were followed by leather and hides, Russian and later foreign cloth and then miscellaneous goods. In the period 1800-1805 about two thirds of Kyakhta exports were of non-Russian origin. The percent before 1800 is not clear. Imports About 50-60% was cotton (it is not clear where this came from). Silk, both raw and processed was about a third. Tea imports started small but were 22% by value in 1792 and 40% ten years later. These were followed by tobacco and manufactured goods. An unknown part of the northbound trade was brought by \\"Bukharans\\" as the Russians called Central Asian traders. The Chinese side South of Kyakhta the trade route had three sections. *1. 170 miles south to Urga. Here carts could be used. The land had more rain, grass, people, hills and rivers than further south. *2. 625 miles southeast to Kalgan by camel caravan across the Gobi Desert. This took about 30 days. Ox carts were used for heavy loads. Horses were used for speed and to supervise the caravans. *3. 100 miles southeast from Kalgan to Peking over the mountains west of Peking. This took about four days and used mules because of a difficult pass, probably to Juyong Pass. The general tea trade in Mongolia was managed by seven companies, the largest of which was the Da Sheng Kui which was based in Hohhot after 1724. They dealt in other goods and interacted with the numerous lamaseries which were also political and economic centers.

(10/27/14). Hosts and symptoms First described in Java by Marian Raciborski in 1900, taro leaf blight is caused by the oomycete Phytophthora colocasia which infect primarily Colocasia spp. and Alocasia marcorhiza. P. colocasiae primarily infects leaves, but can also infect petioles and corms. Brown lesions on taro; Credit: Scot Nelson, University of Hawaii at Manoa Symptoms on leaves initially occur where water droplets accumulate and eventually form small, brown spots surrounded by halos on the upper surface of leaves. These spots expand very quickly and form large brown lesions.Hunter, D., Pouono, K., and Semisi, S. 1998. The impact of taro leaf blight in the pacific islands with special reference to Samoa. Journal of South Pacific Agriculture. The entire leaf can be destroyed within a few days of the initial appearance of symptoms under wet conditions.Misra, R.S, Sharma, K., and Mishra, A.J. September 2008. Phytophthora leaf blight of taro (Colocasia esculenta) - a review. The Asian and Australian Journal of Plant Science and Biotechnology. 2 (2), 55-63. The undersides of leaves have spots that look water-soaked or gray, and as they expand, blight forms and the leaf is destroyed within a few days. Symptoms occur in a day/night pattern where water soaked areas expand during the night and then dry out during the day. As a result, additional water marks form leading to increasingly larger lesions. As the lesions expand, sporangia develop most actively at the margin of the lesion and progress to attack healthy tissue. One characteristic feature found on leaves is the formation of bright orange droplets oozing out from above and below water soaked leaf surfaces. As a result, the droplets dry out during the day and become crusty. Another sign of P. colocasiae infection are masses of sporangia that form a white, powdery ring around the lesion. Symptoms on petioles includes gray to brownish black lesions that can occur anywhere on the petioles. Petioles become soft and may break as the pathogen destroys the host. Symptoms on corms are often rubber-like and soft as well as having a light tan color. These symptoms occur rapidly and can arise anywhere on the corm and are often subtle in early stages. Decayed corm tissue appears brown and turns purplish in advanced stages of infection. Lesions can also be formed by sporangia that are splashed by rain. The dead central area breaks and falls out as the lesion gets larger. The rate of spread for this disease is very high which results in a high percentage of yield loss. Disease cycle P. colocasiae is an oomycete and is thus characterized by oospores and coenocytic hyphae. Oospores have very thick-walls which provide durable survival structures. As a result, oospores overwinter in soil, underground storage organs, or on leaf debris left in the field after harvest. However, inoculum does not survive for very long on leaf tissue. Other Colocasia plants such as Elephant-ear and Dasheen are an additional means of survival for this pathogen. Finally, chlamydospores have been produced under ideal laboratory conditions in culture, and may also serve as a survival structure in addition to oospores. However, chlamydospores have not yet been observed in the field. Therefore, it is not known if chlamydospores are really part of the Phytophthora colocasiae disease cycle. Upon infection, oospores that overwinter on leaf tissue and petioles give rise to sporangiophores which have lemon-shaped sporangia at their tips. Sporangia can infect taro leaves either directly via germ tubes or indirectly by producing zoospores. Whether sporangia infect directly or indirectly depends on weather conditions. If weather conditions are favorable, such as warm temperatures, sporangia infect directly via germ tubes. Germ tubes give rise to appressorium which form haustorium and allow the pathogen to extract nutrients without penetrating the host‚Äôs cell membrane. As a result, more sporangia are formed and if weather conditions remain favorable, additional sporangia are produced and infection continues either directly or indirectly on other hosts. Zoospore release from sporangia; Credit: Fred Brooks, University of Hawaii at Manoa, Bugwood.org Indirect infections occur under unfavorable or very wet conditions by releasing zoospores from sporangia. Zoospores lose their flagella, become cysts, germinate and feed on the host via a germ tube, and produce more sporangia to continue the disease cycle.Jackson, G.V.H. (1980) Diseases and pests of taro. South Pacific Commission, Noumea, New Caledonia. 51 pp. The slanted shape of the taro leaf encourages sporangia and zoospores to spread to other hosts via splash from rain. The pathogen can also be transmitted across fields by infected plant material or contaminated tools. The pathogen can survive as mycelium for a few days in dead and dying plant tissues as well as in infected corms. On the other hand, encysted zoospores of P. colocasiae can survive for several months without a host. Once infection season comes to an end, sexual reproduction occurs to form an oospore. In order to have successful sexual reproduction, weather conditions must be favorable and mating types must match. Two mating types, A1 and A2, exist for Phytophthora colocasiae. Hormonal signaling allows for sporangia of the two mating types to come together and initiate the development of oogonia and antheridia. An oogonium can be likened to a female reproductive organ while an antheridium carries out the role of a male reproductive organ. The penetration of an oogonium via an antheridium leads to the formation of a sexual spore or an oospore. The oospore will overwinter and germinate to produce infectious sporangia once conditions improve. Environment The pathogen grows voraciously in areas with high humidity and heavy rainfall in addition to an optimal pH of 6.5 and temperature of . The aforementioned cool, wet, and humid conditions favor both the asexual and sexual reproduction of Phytophthora colocasiae. The ideal temperature range for this pathogen is . Sporangia, which develop most rapidly at margins of leaf lesions, can germinate directly on leaves at temperatures ranging from , or spread to neighboring leaves via rain splash. During less ideal conditions, such as low temperatures nearing and high humidity, sporangia release zoospores for indirect germination. Germination occurs over a period of approximately two hours, followed by a 2-4 day incubation period between germ tube penetration and the onset of disease symptoms. The ideal temperatures for reproduction of the Phytophthora colocasiae pathogen has led to its distribution throughout cool tropical areas of Southeast Asia, from where the pathogen is thought to have originated. P. colocasiae has been observed in Indonesia, China, India, the Philippines, Malaysia, Hawaii, Papua New Guinea, and the British Solomon Islands. Management In the past, control of P. colocasiae has been aimed largely at limiting the amount of inoculum via cultural practices. An example of such a practice is roguing, which involves the removal of all or part of infected leaves. This practice has ultimately proved ineffective as the removal of leaves largely mimics the defoliating effects of the Taro Leaf Blight disease itself, and exacerbates the losses in yield already devastating the crop. Increased spacing between taro plants has been explored as a method of limiting transmission. However, this method has also proven ineffective as taro plants grow best when planted close together. Therefore, increasing space between plants also decreases yield. Chemical control of P. colocasiae has offered some relief in the form of preventative sprays containing copper, manganese, and zinc. The slanted shape of taro leaves, and prevalence of the crop in wet climates, necessitates numerous applications which may not be economically practical. The systemic fungicide metalaxyl has also been found to be effective in controlling P. colocasiae, especially when applied in conjunction with the pesticide mancozeb at the first sight of disease symptoms. While chemical control is one of the more effective methods of managing this pathogen, the fact that taro is usually a subsistence crop makes chemical control economically impractical and environmentally unsustainable. A recent study obtained promising results using Eucalyptus globus essential oil to combat P. colocasiae. Upon chemical analysis of the essential oil, researchers determined the most abundant compounds to be 1,8-cineole, Œ±-pinene, and p-cymene. These compounds make up 26.4%, 14.1% and 10.2% of the essential oil, respectively. In vitro studies demonstrated complete inhibition of sporangia germination and mycelial growth following applications of Eucalyptus globus essential oil at a concentration of 0.625 mg/mL and inhibition of zoospore germination at a concentration of 0.156 mg/mL. In situ, these compounds completely inhibited sporulation, necrosis, and overall disease symptom expression at a concentration of 3.5 mg/mL.Sameza, M. L., Boat, M., Nguemezi, S., Mabou, L., Dongmo, P., Boyom, F., and Menut, C. 2014. Potential use of Eucalyptus globulus essential oil against Phytophthora colocasiae the causal agent of taro leaf blight. European Journal of Plant Pathology 140. Despite the promise of chemical control, genetic resistance currently offers the best long-term control of P. colocasiae. In 2013, researchers were able to confer resistance to the taro plant via the oxalate oxidase (OxO) gene gf2.8 of wheat (Triticum aestivum). The researchers were able to isolate a transgenic line which did not develop disease symptoms following inoculation with P. colocasiae zoospores.He, X., Miyasaka, S., Fitch, M., Khuri, S. & Zhu, Y. 2013. Taro (Colocasia esculenta) Transformed with a Wheat Oxalate Oxidase Gene for Improved Resistance to Taro Pathogen Phytophthora colocasiae. HortScience 48, 22‚Äì27. Several Taro Leaf Blight- resistant varieties, such as the K333, K345, and Ainaben, have also been identified. While genetic resistance appears to be the most powerful tool for managing P. colocasiae thus far, certain genetic modifications result in changes in the taste and appearance of the taro plant. Due to its grave cultural and economic significance, the challenge of developing resistant varieties without decreasing the cultural and economic value of the crop remains. Importance Taro is the fourteenth most consumed vegetable worldwide and is a staple crop both in the diet and economy of the tropics. Many tropical nations rely on taro as a main export. Taro Leaf Blight causes varying losses in corm yield depending on how susceptible the cultivars are to Taro Leaf Blight infection and damage. Reductions in corm yield of 25-50% have been reported in various locations across the Pacific. Losses of 25-35% of corm yield have been recorded in the Philippines while in some extreme cases, losses of 95% have been recorded in various cultivars across Hawaii. The most recent epidemic of Taro Leaf Blight spanned the Samoan Archipelago from 1993-1994. Taro export made up 58% of Samoa‚Äôs economy and brought in 3.5 million US dollars annually immediately prior to the epidemic in 1993. In 1994, taro exports brought in only $60,000 US dollars - a 99.98% drop in profit in just one year‚Äôs time. The reason Taro Leaf Blight was able to ravage Samoa‚Äôs taro crop was because taro is vegetatively propagated via cuttings and not seeds. Taro monocultures with no leaf blight resistance had been created with very little genetic variance.Moorhead, A. May 2011. Lesson in Diversity from Samoa‚Äôs taro blight. Plant Protection.18-19. This narrow gene variance left the monocultures devoid of resistant plants to buffer the spread of the pathogen allowing it to quickly spread in the warm humid climate of Samoa, devastating taro production throughout the archipelago. Currently, the taro exportation of Samoa has rebounded due to crossing the Samoan variety with resistant varieties from Southeast Asia. The implementation of virus free tissue testing has ensured that no infected vegetative tissue can be sold and grown on Samoan soil. Samoa‚Äôs epidemic served as an example for other taro exporting countries to ensure Taro Leaf blight resistance among plantations and to test tissue to ensure that the disease does not spread across other countries.

A fashionable beauty reads the posters on the kiosk while two gentlemen surreptitiously ogle her. Eye movement in scene viewing refers to the visual processing of information presented in scenes. This phenomenon has been studied in a range of areas such as cognitive psychology and psychophysics, where eye movement can be monitored under experimental conditions. A core aspect in these studies is the division of eye movements into saccades, the rapid movement of the eyes, and fixations, the focus of the eyes on a point. There are several factors which influence eye movement in scene viewing, both the task and knowledge of the viewer (top- down factors), and the properties of the image being viewed (bottom-up factors). The study of eye movement in scene viewing helps to understand visual processing in more natural environments. Typically, when presented with a scene, viewers demonstrate short fixation durations and long saccade amplitudes in the earlier phases of viewing an image, representing ambient processing. This is followed by longer fixations and shorter saccades in the latter phases of scene viewing, representing focal processing (Pannasch et al., 2008). Eye movement behaviour in scene viewing differs between different levels of cognitive development. Fixation durations shorten and saccade amplitudes lengthen with the increase in age. In children, the development of saccades to the amplitude normally found in adults have occur earlier (4‚Äì6 years old) than the development of fixation durations (6‚Äì8 years old). Yet, the typical pattern of behaviour during scene viewing, when progressing from ambient processing to focal processing, has been observed to occur from the age of 2 years old (Helo, Pannasch, Sirri & R√§m√§, 2014).  Spatial variation  There are particular factors which affect where eye movements fixate upon, these include bottom-up factors inherent to the stimulus, and top-down factors inherent to the viewer. Even an initial glimpse of a scene has been found to generate an abstract representation of the image that can be stored in memory for use in subsequent eye movements (Castelhano & Henderson, 2007). In bottom- up factors, eye guidance can be affected by the local contrast or salience of features in an image (Itti & Koch, 2000). An example of this would be an area with a large difference in luminance (Parkhurst et al., 2002), a greater density of edges (Mannan, Ruddock & Wooding, 1996) or binocular disparity determining the distance of different objects on the scene (Jansen et al., 2009). The top-down factors of scenes have more of an impact than bottom-up features in affecting fixation positions. Behaviourally relevant information that are more interesting in a scene is more salient than low-level features, drawing fixations more frequently and more quickly from scene onset (Onat, A√ßik, Schumann & K√∂nig, 2014). Local scene colour in a fixation position has an influence on where fixations occur. The presence of colour can increase the likelihood of the item being processed as a semantic object as it can aid the discrimination of the object, making it more interesting to view (Amano & Foster, 2014). When viewers are semantically primed by being presented with consistently similar scenes, the density of fixations increase, and fixation durations decrease (Henderson, Weeks Jr., & Hollingworth, 1999). Information separate to what is presented in a scene also has an effect on the area being fixated upon. Eye movements can be guided anticipatorily by linguistic input, where if an item in the scene is presented verbally, the listener will be more likely to move their visual focus to that object (Staub, Abott & Bogartz, 2012). With regard to factors relating to viewers rather than the scene, differences have been found in cross-cultural research. Westerners have an inclination to concentrate on focal objects in a scene, where they look at focal objects more often and quicker in comparison to East Asians who attend more to contextual information, where they make more saccades to the background of the scene (Chua, Boland & Nisbett, 2002).  Temporal variation  Regarding the temporality of fixations, average fixation durations last for 300ms on average, although there is a large variability around this approximation. Some of this variability can be explained through global properties of an image, impacting upon both bottom-up processing and top-down processing. During natural scene viewing, the masking of an image by replacing it with a grey field during fixations has an increase in fixation durations (Henderson & Pierce, 2008). More subtle degradations of an image on fixation durations, such as the decrease in luminance of an image during fixations, also increases the length of fixation durations (Henderson, Nuthmann & Luke, 2013). An asymmetric effect is shown where the increase of luminance also increases fixation durations (Walshe & Nuthmann, 2014). However, the change in factors affecting top-down processing, such as blurring or phase noise, increases fixation durations when used to degrade a scene and decreases fixation durations when used to enhance a scene (Henderson, Olejarczyk, Luke & Schmidt, 2014; Einh√§user et al., 2006). Furthermore, temporal and spatial aspects interact in a complex manner. When a picture is first presented on the screen, fixations made within the first second are more likely to be directed toward the left side of the scene, whereas the opposite holds true for the remaining part of the presentation (Ossand√≥n et al., 2014).

Typically the package may include coverage for business crime, business automobile, boiler and machinery, marine, or farm. The benefits to purchasing multiple- peril insurance coverage include lower overall premium costs for the insured because of the benefits that the insured receives on the basis of an all-in- one type package, as well as broader coverage for losses that typically occur together, like flood damage to an insured‚Äôs basement and wind damage to an insured‚Äôs roof.  Commercial multiple-peril insurance coverage  The term multiple-peril coverage is rarely used in commercial insurance. Rather, most insurance companies offer package plans like a Business Owners Policy (BOP) which covers a variety of risks that face a typical small business. However, multiple-peril coverage is a broader, more inclusive term that includes coverage combinations like business automobile, which is a single category of coverage, but actually qualifies as multiple-peril coverage as it may provide indemnification for the perils of liability, physical damage (property), and medical payments. = Multiple-peril crop insurance coverage = A prominent type of multiple-peril insurance coverage is multiple-peril crop insurance coverage (MPCI). MPCI is a bundle of different policy options that covers loss of crop yields from drought, flood, excessive moisture, and all other natural causes. Recent changes in coverage now allow for a combination of yield protection and price protection to further protect farmers from financial loss. Multiple-peril crop insurance is actually a product of a government partnership and 19 private insurance companies. In essence, the United States Department of Agriculture Risk Management Agency oversees the issuance of MPCI, along with mandating what rates can be charged and what kinds of crops are automatically covered in different parts of the country. The collection of private insurance companies that are allowed to sell MPCI handle the reinsurance and writing of the policies themselves, as well as adjusting and processing claims.  USA Multiple-peril Insurance Act  Currently the government is the only actual provider of flood insurance throughout the nation as part of the National Flood Insurance Program. In 2009, a bill approached the House of Representatives that would have extended the National Flood Insurance Program to include other risks typically associated with catastrophic flooding. This bill was entitled the Multiple-Peril Insurance Act and was sponsored by Representative Gene Taylor of Mississippi. The provisions of this bill would have extended the federal government‚Äôs involvement in the flood insurance to combine the current sale of flood insurance through the NFIP with wind coverage. As a result, those who experienced damage from a catastrophe like a large-scale hurricane would know that they could not fall through a crack in their coverage. However, others argued that the bill was unnecessarily subsidizing the purchase of wind insurance when such insurance is already available in 99% of ZIP codes in the United States. A bundle of wind and flood insurance is the perfect illustration of multiple-peril insurance coverage. Even though the combination of the two kinds of coverage seems logical, the current structure of the flood insurance market makes this bundle impossible to sell because of regulatory issues.  Unusual Multiple- peril Insurance Policies  Sometimes multiple-peril insurance policies bundle some fairly strange coverages together for the sake of covering all possible risks to an insured. For example, some life insurance policies come complete with UFO abduction coverage. Although this may seem strange, in the case of a UFO abduction where it may be fairly difficult to determine whether an individual is dead or alive, the life insurance policy would pay benefits to the insured‚Äôs designated recipient indefinitely or until the insured was returned. Additionally, many employers that have life insurance policies on their top employees often buy a multiple-peril version of the policy that includes kidnapping insurance that will pay ransom in the event of the employees kidnapping that results in an indefinite holding of the employee that may or may not result in death, particularly when it may be difficult to confirm the life status of the employee.

(2003). \\"Angelico, Fra\\". Grove Art Online. is an Early Renaissance fresco by Fra Angelico in the Convent of San Marco in Florence, Italy. When Cosimo de' Medici rebuilt the convent, he commissioned Fra Angelico to decorate the walls with intricate frescos. This included the altarpiece, the inside of the monk's cells, the friar's cloister, the chapter house, and inside the corridors; around fifty pieces in total. All of the paintings were done by Angelico himself or under his direct supervision. Out of all of the frescos at the convent, the Annunciation is the most well known in the art world. The Annunciation is not Fra Angelico's first painting on that theme nor his only one in the convent. His works are scattered across the world in well-known museums and galleries including the Prado. He is credited as the inventor of this type of composition, where Gabriel visits Mary in an outdoor setting. A typical Gothic Annunciation painting contained the archangel Gabriel visiting the Virgin Mary indoors and with Mary enthroned. The figures would appear flat, static, and unrealistic. This painting in particular is supposed to have \\"achieved heights of singular elegance.\\" The way it handles space and lighting is revolutionary because it is a transition out of the Gothic period and into the Renaissance. Previous versions had no spatial awareness. The figures seemed to float in the air, and lines did not end in a vanishing point. This caused them to be lopsided and disproportional. This particular version of the Annunciation is located at the top of the stairs on the first floor where the San Marco dormitories are located - on the north side. This is one of only three frescoes that Fra Angelico painted outside on the walls of the corridor instead of inside the cells. The staircase has undergone many renovations including modifications to the window which affects the amount of light entering the convent. This fresco was meant to be viewed under low light. When viewing the painting, there is an invisible light source that would have made additional light unnecessary to the monks viewing the painting. If visitors to the convent viewed the painting today, it would not look authentic. There are now lights illuminating it from many different angles. With its placement at the top of the stairs Fra Angelico sought to bring the scene into the convent and into the daily lives of the monks. A lighter painting at the time would have been used for decoration, while a darker one was meant for reflection and prayer. The frescos inside the cells at the convent of San Marco were done with reserve. \\"They were intended for contemplation and meditation and a reflection on poverty. Gold leaf and azurite were reserved for Cosimo de' Medici in his private cell and for the frescos in public spaces in the corridors.\\" The gold leaf and azurite were extravagant materials and were a luxury only given to Cosimo because he was a wealthy patron. The friars were given paintings in their cells for the sole purpose of praying. Even with the gold and azurite, the Annunciation in the north dormitory would have still been relatively dull because of its location in a convent. In the Annunciation Gabriel is seen approaching Mary outdoors in the cloister. Overlooking the loggia, an open- sided room of a convent that faces the outside, it is supported by columns. Gabriel is seen clad in pink and gold with multi-coloured wings stooping down with his gaze fixed on Mary. He is seen with his arms bent at the elbow with his hands crossed over his chest gesturing to Mary. Mary is depicted as sweet and innocent, yet taken aback by Gabriel's arrival. Her innocence and virginity is represented by the 'Hortus Conclusus' seen through the fence and the window in the background. Mary is seated facing him in her typical blue indicating her royal status and her purity. Her arms are folded in the same manner as Gabriel but this gesture shows her acceptance, humility, and submission. The cloister is surrounded by columns from the Composite order. They are all supporting Roman arches. Together they all work to frame Gabriel and Mary and highlight the focal point of the piece. The centre column in the foreground separates the painting into two spaces putting Gabriel and Mary at opposite ends, separating them but at the same time keeping them together. This fresco was not intended just for aesthetic purposes. Running across the loggia at the bottom of the fresco there is an inscription that instructs the viewer: \\"Virginis Intacte Cvm Veneris Ante Figvram Preterevndo Cave Ne Sileatvr Ave.\\" It means when you come before the image of the Ever-Virgin take care that you do not neglect to say an Ave. This was a daily reminder for the monks to pray.

Early and personal life Jaresko was born on 24 April 1965 in Elmhurst, Illinois, the daughter of Mary (Maria), n√©e Budziak, and John (Ivan) Jaresko, both Ukrainian immigrants to the United States. Her father was born in Poltava Oblast during the Holodomor, during which her kulak great-grandparents, Feofan and Natalia Brazhnyk, starved to death. Jaresko was raised with two siblings, Katherine and John, in Wood Dale, Illinois. Although her family spoke mainly English, she attended Ukrainian school on Saturdays and the Ukrainian Orthodox church on Sundays. She is bilingual in English and Ukrainian. Residing in Ukrainian Village, Chicago, she studied accounting at DePaul University, earning a B.Sc. degree in 1987. She received a master's degree in public policy from the John F. Kennedy School of Government in 1989. In 2011, she and her husband, Ihor Figlus, divorced. She has two daughters who live in Ukraine. Citizenship Jaresko lived in Ukraine from 1992 to 2000, and returned in 2004. She received Ukrainian citizenship on 2 December 2014, the day of her appointment as Minister of Finance of Ukraine. She remains a U.S. citizen.Willershausen, Florian (2015.09.24) \\"Minister: Ukraine Making Comeback,\\" Chicago Tribune, p. 16. Although the U.S. does not prohibit dual citizenship, Ukrainian law states that she would have to renounce her non-Ukrainian citizenship(s) within two years. Career Jaresko held several economics-related positions at the US Department of State in Washington, D.C., and eventually coordinated activities of the State Department, the Departments of Commerce, Treasury, the United States Trade Representative, and Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) in their economic relations with the Soviet Union and its successors. As part of her work she interacted with the International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Later from 1992 to 1995, she was the first Chief of the Economic Section of the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, responsible for strengthening economic cooperation between the two countries. She has been a governor of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. In 2003 she was awarded the Ukrainian Order of Princess Olga for her contributions to the Ukrainian economy. Jaresko also held several key positions in the private business sector. In February 2001 she became president and chief executive officer of Western NIS Enterprise Fund (WNISEF), which had been disbursing United States Agency for International Development (USAID) funds to small and medium-sized businesses in Ukraine and Moldova since 1995. In 2006, she co-founded Horizon Capital, where she served as a managing partner and chief executive officer, which took over the management of WNISEF. In those positions she established and strengthened economic ties with Ukraine and Moldova. Horizon Capital managed two funds, the Emerging Europe Growth Fund aimed at institutional and individual investors in the west, and the USAID funded Western NIS Enterprise Fund which preceded Horizon Capital. After the divorce of Jaresko and Ihor Figlus, who was a limited partner in Horizon Capital, Horizon Capital litigated to maintain the confidentiality of its internal financial arrangements. When Jaresko left Horizon Capital in December 2014, it had about $600 million of Ukrainian investments under management. Between 2005 and 2010 Jaresko was a member of President Viktor Yushchenko's Foreign Investors Advisory Council and the advisory board of the Ukrainian Center for Promotion of Foreign Investment under the auspices of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. Ukrainian Minister of Finance Nine months after the 2014 Ukrainian revolution, Jaresko was approached by headhunters for the new Ukrainian government, and within days offered the post of minister of finance. Early in Jaresko's term she made an outline agreement for a $40 billion four- year loan from the International Monetary Fund and Western countries. In August 2015 Jaresko was instrumental to restructuring Ukraine's debts, including a partial write-off with a 20% haircut on Ukraine's $18 billion privately held government debt. On 24 March 2016, shortly before she left office, she argued that the economy had to be depoliticized and Ukraine needed a technocratic government, and that she was willing to lead such a technocratic government. The Ukraine Today and Financial Times had reported speculation that Jaresko could become Ukraine's new prime minister, which was also suggested by former United States Ambassador to Ukraine Steven Pifer and President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko. The Ukrainian Weekly reported that Jaresko had started forming a provisional technocratic Cabinet of Ministers the previous month. Jaresko was rejected as a prime ministerial candidate by the governing coalition. When speaker of the Ukrainian parliament, Volodymyr Groysman, was elected as Ukraine's new prime minister on 14 April 2016, he did not retain Jaresko in his new Cabinet. After she left office, Jaresko said she believed the Ukraine macroeconomic situation had stabilized, and that Ukraine needed a further $25 billion of investment beyond the agreed IMF loans to \\"win over the hearts and minds of Ukrainian society\\" as the \\"immediate effects [of reform] on the population have been painful.\\" Later career In May 2016, Jaresko became chair of the board of trustees of the Aspen Institute unit in Kiev, a U.S. headquartered educational and policy studies NGO. In 20 March 2017, Jaresko became the executive director of the Financial Oversight Board of Puerto Rico, as part of the PROMESA bill. It has been reported in the media that Jaresko will make $625,000 a year, and her traveling, moving and security costs will be covered as part of her work.

Education  Brugge originally intended on pursuing a career as a mathematics instructor. While she was attending Northwestern University as an undergraduate student, her sister developed a brain tumor. This event sparked a newfound passion for biology and specifically cancer research. While Brugge was completing her undergraduate degree in biology, she became interested in tumor virology, which refers to the study of how viruses can affect and in some cases produce cancerous cells.\\"Joan Brugge.\\" American Society for Cell Biology 1 (3 Aug. 2009): Print.Javier, R.

Career  After the completion of her doctorate degree, Brugge joined Dr. Ray Erikson at the University of Colorado for her postdoctorate work. It was there that she discovered a protein that was formed from both the viral and cellular forms of the Src gene. This was a major breakthrough in cancer research, since it proved that genes that cause cells to become cancerous originate from normal cellular genes. In 1979, Brugge took an assistant professor position at the State University of New York (SUNY) at Stony Brook, eventually becoming a Professor of Microbiology. She continued her studies on the Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) that she had discovered in her postdoctorate work.

It has been observed in several countries of the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. It is considered to be an endemic virus in greenhouses and field productions of Cucurbitaceae crops, including melon (Cucumis melo), cucumber (Cucumbis sativus), and watermelon (Citrullus lanatus). MNSV is mainly spread through infected soil, seedlings, insects, and by the root-inhabiting fungus vector Olpidium bornovanus. Symptoms vary between Curbitaceae crops, but generally consist of chlorosis, brown necrotic lesions, leaf wilt, fruit decay, and plant death. Management of the disease consists of preventing infection by rotating fields and crops, steam sterilization, and disposal of infected plants. Also, treated seeds with heat or chemicals are efficient in preventing infection. MNSV is important in melon plants as it causes vast economical damage worldwide reducing significant yields. Hosts and symptoms Discoloration in the rind of a seedless watermelon caused by MNSV Melons are one of the most important crops in the tropical and temperate areas of the world. MNSV has been found to have a very narrow host range, restricted to members of the family Cucurbitaceae. In particular, the hosts include watermelons (Citrullus lanatus), cucumbers (Cucumis sativus), and melons (Cucumis melo). On watermelon, MNSV produces chlorotic lesions on leaves, stems, and/or cotyledons, which turn into dark brown local lesions.Hibi T, Furuki I, 1985. Melon necrotic spot virus. Wellesbourne, UK: Association of Applied Biologists: Descriptions of PlantsViruses no. 302 These brown local lesions indicate necrosis occurring on the specific plant parts. Also, the fruit itself may become infected. The fruit may become misshaped with the melon flesh becoming discolored and brown ring rot becoming evident. The fruit can decay while on the plant in severe cases.Tesoriero, Len. Preventing New Diseases - Melon Necrotic Spot Virus. Orange: Government of New South Wales - Department of Primary Industries, 1 Oct. 2013. Pdf. In cucumbers, MNSV produces chlorotic lesions on leaves and cotyledons. In the chlorotic lesions, necrotic brown pinpoint lesions enlarge throughout the lesions, causing the leaf and/or cotyledons to wilt and die. Stem necrosis is generally absent. The cucumber fruit itself will not display lesions. In melons, such as rockmelon, muskmelon, and cantaloupe, MNSV produces necrotic lesions on the leaves and/or cotyledons. The roots will also exhibit necrotic lesions. The melon fruit decreases in size and displays necrotic spots on the rind as well. Overall, infection of the crop will produce small chlorotic spots on the leaves, stems, and/or cotyledons, which turn brown while enlarging in size. The necrotic lesions can cause death to the plant structure and plant as a whole. MNSV symptoms tend to be more severe at lower temperatures. Once a plant is infected with MNSV the infection persists until plant death.Herrera-V√°squez JA, Cebri√°n MC, Rosell√≥ JA, C√≥rdoba-Sell√©s C, Jord√° C, 2007. Molecular variability among isolates of Melon necrotic spot virus (MNSV) from Spain, Mexico and Central America. In: XIII International Congress on Molecular Plant-Microbe Interactions. Italy: Sorrento, 281. If no infection occurs, MNSV can survive in soil for several years. Disease cycle MNSV is seed-borne, soil-borne, and vector-borne. It spreads via two means: the soil fungus Olpidium bornovanus, which is soil-borne and moisture dependent, and the cucumber beetles: western spotted cucumber beetle (Diabrotica undecimpunctata undecimpunctata) and banded cucumber beetle (D. balteata).Coudriet, D.L., A.N. Kishaba, and I.E. Carrol. 1979. transmission of melon necrotic spot virus in muskmelons by cucumber beetles.. J. Econ. Entomol. 72:560-561. Since it is a virus, it is transmitted through vectors. Vectors are mediums with which any pathogens are transmitted. Through seed, infection occurs when the seeds are scattered in soil containing the virus-free fungus. This is known as ‚Äúvector- mediated seed transmission‚Äù. MNSV which is carried on the seed is released into the soil. The virus attaches to the external surface of the zoospores of Olipidium bornovanus using the MNSV coat protein for attachment. The fungus itself is observed in only the root tissue of the virus-infected plants. Once the fungus invades the plant roots it transmits the virus to the host plants.Gonzalez-Garza R, Gumpf DJ, Kishaba AN and Bohn GW. (1979) Identification, seed transmission and host range pathogenicity of a California isolate of melon necrotic spot virus. Phytopathology 69:340-345. The processes is then repeated once seeds are created. Lastly, cucumber beetles act as insect vectors for MNSV. They feed on flowers of the plants, if these are available, rather than feeding on leaves. This causes reductions in fruit yield. If flowers are not available, adult beetles prefer the foliage of the cucurbit crops.EPPO/CABI (1997a) Diabrotica barberi and Diabrotica virgifera. In Quarantine Pests for Europe (2nd ed), pp. 233-237. CAB International, Wallingford (GB). This is the method by which the beetles spread the virus in a persistent manner. Environment MNSV can be found in tropical and temperate areas in the world where its host crops thrive. The first symptoms sighting of MNSV was seen in Japan.Kishi K. 1966 Necrotic spot of melon, a new virus disease. Ann. Phytopathol. Soc. Japan. 32:138-144. The virus has since been reported to be infecting melons in Western Europe, Eastern Europe, the Americas, Asia, and lastly, Australia. In the United States, MNSV can be mainly found in the southern states where climates are favorable. Symptoms are visible during the spring and autumn seasons due to MNSV requiring higher humidity with specific temperature ranges. The virus begins to inoculate plants with symptoms beginning to show when temperatures are under 25‚ÑÉ, with the most severe temperature showing when temperatures drop slightly below 20‚ÑÉ. Management Management of MNSV can be achieved through multiple methods of control. Targeting Olipidium bornovanus is effective in stopping the vector from spreading the disease. Control of the Olipidium vector can be obtained via soil sterilization with steam or methyl bromide. Controlling pest insects is also effective. The chemical substances in insecticides kill the beetles, eliminating spread of the virus. Since MNSV is soil-borne, soil disinfection and prevention of mechanical transmission is important. Removing and disposing infected plants from the soil can help disinfect soil from the virus. Also, cleaning machinery between fields is essential to limit the spread of the virus. If infected soil remains on machinery and equipment, it will spread to other fields. In cases of infection rates being too high in the particular field, crop rotation is necessary. The virus is also seed-borne. Ensuring clean seed when planting is crucial. In order to eradicate MNSV in melon seeds without hindering germination, heat treatment of 144 hours at 70‚ÑÉ is necessary.Herrera-V√°squez, J. A., M. C. C√≥rdoba-Sell√©s, M. C. Cebri√°n, A. Alfaro-Fern√°ndez, and C. Jord√°. \\"Seed Transmission Ofand Efficacy of Seed- disinfection Treatments.\\" Plant Pathology 58.3 (2009): 436-42. Web. 12 Nov. 2014. Also, Trisodium phosphate is an effective chemical that can be used against seeds infected with MNSV. Lastly, breeding for resistance is the most effective method of control against MNSV. Two cultivars in melon that exhibit resistance are ‚ÄúGulfstream‚Äù and the Korean accession PI 161375. Both exhibit a single recessive gene, nsv, which is reported to control the only resistance found to MNSV in melon.\\"Coudriet, D.L., A.N. Kishaba, and G.W. Bohn. 1981. Inheritance of resistance to muskmelon necrotic spot virus in a melon aphid- resistant breeding line of muskmelon. J. Am. Soc. Hort. Sci. 106:709-791.\\" Importance Although MNSV is not well known, it has produced major outbreaks leading back to the first studies of the virus in 1966 in Japan. Kishi first discovered MNSV on Cucumis melo in a greenhouse setting in that year. For the next two decades, there were minor studies in greenhouse and field studies in California and the Netherlands on the transmission of MNSV. In 1982, nurserymen at Brough, Humberside first discovered the disease on their cucumber plants. In May 1983, some plants showed chlorosis and occasional necrotic spots on leaves. By August of that year, nearly 50% of the 120,000 plants in the greenhouse were severely infected and over 60% had MNSV by October. Fortunately the fruits of these plants did not display any symptoms although there was definite reduction in crop yield. More recently researchers have discovered a non-systemic strain of MNSV on cucurbitaceous plants in a 2008 study. This strain was isolated from a watermelon plant and showed similar characteristics to the former MNSV pathogen except for the fact that it wasn't serologically the same and did not show symptoms on six MNSV susceptible plants. For over four decades, this pathogen has proven to be important due to the agricultural community‚Äôs lack of knowledge on MNSV as well its ability to wipe out over 60% of the crop yield as discovered during the Humberside incident.

The slogan implies one has their hands in the air, a common sign of submission, and is therefore not a threat to an approaching police officer. Witness reports from the Brown shooting are conflicted as to what Brown was doing with his hands when he was shot. Most witnesses claimed he physically charged at the officer. One witness initially claimed Brown had his hands in the air before recanting his account. The slogan was adopted at protests against police brutality in the U.S. A United States Department of Justice investigation, under the leadership of African-American U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, found the 'hands up' claim was inconsistent with the physical and forensic evidence, and the witness testimony surrounding the Brown shooting. Origin and backstory The first recorded incident of \\"Hands up\\" being chanted at a protest was during student protests in London in 2009. Trapped by riot police on Westminster bridge, some protesters raised their hands to demonstrate that they were not instigating the police violence and shouted \\"Hands up\\" to encourage others to do the same Video of the 2009 police 'kettle' of protesters on Westminster Bridge: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQvZuVIzzTU. On Saturday, August 9, 2014, Michael Brown and Dorian Johnson were walking together in Ferguson, Missouri after Brown robbed a convenience store. They were stopped by Officer Darren Wilson. There is still no clear report of exactly what transpired between this point of the incident and when Brown was shot because of major inconsistencies in the witnesses' stories. Wilson claimed that Brown reached into his police SUV for the officer's gun, but prosecutors were neither able to confirm nor disprove this.United States, Congress, ‚ÄúDepartment of Justice Report Regarding the Criminal Investigation into the Shooting Death of Michael Brown by Ferguson, Missouri Police Officer Darren Wilson.‚Äù Department of Justice Report Regarding the Criminal Investigation into the Shooting Death of Michael Brown by Ferguson, Missouri Police Officer Darren Wilson, Department of Justice, 2015, pp. 6‚Äì8. After the altercation near the vehicle, the official incident report says that Brown ran away from the vehicle. Then, Brown turned back around and started moving back toward the officer. Officer Wilson claimed he feared for the safety of his life, and that is when he shot and killed Michael Brown.Bosman, Julie, Campbell Robertson, Erik Eckholm, and Ricard A. Oppel Jr., \\"Amid Conflicting Accounts, Trusting Darren Wilson\\", New York Times. November 25, 2014. Accessed: August 5, 2016. Before recanting his story, one recurring feature in Dorian Johnson's eyewitness account of the incident was that Michael Brown put his hands in the air during the encounter with Officer Wilson. A typical recollection by Dorian Johnson was phrased as \\"[Michael Brown] turned around, and he put his hands in the air, and he started to get down.\\" Three days after the killing of Michael Brown, Johnson told MSNBC that Brown said, \\"I don‚Äôt have a gun, stop shooting!\\"Lee, Trymaine. \\"Eyewitness to Michael Brown shooting recounts his friend‚Äôs death\\", MSNBC. August 12, 2014. Accessed: August 1, 2016. In addition to Johnson, several witnesses to the shooting of Michael Brown described him as having his hands up during the encounter. However, no one else recalled Brown asking Wilson not to shoot his firearm.Grinberg. Emanuella. \\"Why 'hands up, don't shoot' resonates regardless of evidence\\", CNN. January 11, 2015.

Retrieved September 19, 2014. Shortly after the shooting, Brown's stepfather held a placard that read \\"Ferguson police just executed my unarmed son!!!\\" By 8:30 that same evening, demonstrators were chanting \\"We are Michael Brown!\\" They also marched to the headquarters of the Ferguson Police Department, where they chanted \\"No justice!

The hands-up pose had been widely adopted by protesters throughout the weekend. The gesture was often paired with the phrase \\"Don't shoot me\\" or \\"Don't shoot us.\\" During the demonstrations on Monday, the media first documented the posture and the phrase being combined into the slogan \\"Hands Up, Don't Shoot.\\" Brown's death took place after the deaths of Eric Garner and Trayvon Martin. In the wake of Trayvon Martin's death, the BlackLivesMatter movement exploded in mainstream media.Simon, Darran. ‚ÄúTrayvon Martin‚Äôs Death Sparked a Movement That Lives on Five Years Later.‚Äù New York Amsterdam News, vol. 108, no. 16, 20 Apr. 2017, pp. 37‚Äì39.

From that moment forward, it was an ongoing protest that was only amplified by the deaths of Michael Brown and the others. Many Black Lives Matter activists traveled to Ferguson in Protest of Brown's death. These activists claim that social media has exploded the conversation about these movements, and police brutality in general. The ‚ÄúHands up, don‚Äôt shoot!‚Äù slogan/gesture was adopted and is still used by BlackLivesMatter activists because of the synonymous origins and causes of both movements.Hafner, Josh. ‚ÄúHow Michael Brown's Death, Two Years Ago, Pushed #BlackLivesMatter into a Movement.‚Äù USA Today, 8 Aug. 2016.

August 13, 2014. Accessed: August 9, 2016. The hands up gesture used widely by black males when dealing with Ferguson police was transformed into a weapon of protest. Al Sharpton encouraged demonstrators to use the gesture by saying, \\"If you're angry, throw your arms up. If you want justice, throw your arms up. Because that's the sign Michael was using. He had a surrender sign. That's the sign you have to deal with. Use the sign he last showed.

Accessed: August 10, 2016. The phrase took off more than a year ago, becoming a rallying cry for protesters and others trying to draw attention to the killing of Brown and other African Americans by police officers. In November 2014, some members of the St. Louis Rams ran out on the field during pregame introductions with their hands raised above their heads, an action repeated by four members of the Congressional Black Caucus on the House floor in December 2014.Gass, Nick, et al. ‚Äú'Hands up, Don't Shoot' Ranked One of Biggest 'Pinocchios' of 2015.‚Äù POLITICO, POLITICO, 14 Dec. 2015, www.politico.com/story/2015/12/hands-up- dont-shoot-false-216736. The hybrid slogan \\"Hands Up, Don't Shoot\\" quickly spread beyond the Ferguson protests. It was often said in solidarity with the protesters in Ferguson.Alund, Natalie Neysa. \\"Oakland: Residents rally against police shootings, support Ferguson protesters\\", The Mercury News.

One of the rallying cries at those protests was \\"Hands Up, Don't Shoot\\". This became a common chant at Black Lives Matter protests, along with the dying words of Eric Garner (\\"I can't breathe\\"), and \\"No justice, no peace\\". =St. Louis Rams protest= On November 30, 2014, several players on the St. Louis Rams, (Tavon Austin, Stedman Bailey, Kenny Britt, Jared Cook and Chris Givens) entered the field during a NFL game making the gesture. The St. Louis Police Officers Association said the act was \\"way out-of-bounds\\" and the organization \\"is profoundly disappointed with the members of the St. Louis Rams football team who chose to ignore the mountains of evidence released from the St. Louis County Grand Jury this week and engage in a display that police officers around the nation found tasteless, offensive, and inflammatory\\". Rams Coach Jeff Fisher and a team spokesman said that they were unaware of the players' plans before the game and the players \\"were exercising their right to free speech\\". Against the St. Louis Police Officers Association's request, the NFL did not punish the players, because the gesture was political and unlike other major professional sports leagues NFL does not punish players for political gestures. The NFL's vice president of communications said, \\"We respect and understand the concerns of all individuals who have expressed views on this tragic situation.\\" Jared Cook, one of the Rams players, received threats after making the gesture. =Capitol Hill= Jeffries (D-NY), Lee (D-Tex.), Green (D-Tex.) and Clarke (D-NY) making the gesture On December 1, 2014, several lawmakers in the United States House of Representatives made the gesture to protest the shooting and police brutality. Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-New York) said on the floor: Other members of the Congressional Black Caucus joining Jeffries were Reps. Yvette Clarke (D-New York), Al Green (D-Texas) and Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas), who praised the football players who made the gesture the night before. On December 11, more than 150 black congressional staffers staged a walkout and silent protest in a display of unity with demonstrations against the Eric Garner and Brown grand jury decisions. Senate Chaplain Dr. Barry Black led the crowd in prayer. They were gathered there, Black said, to be a \\"voice for the voiceless\\". After prayer, the crowd of staff and lawmakers posed while making the gesture. =CNN Newsroom= On December 13, 2014, after a story about the ongoing protest, three members of the CNN Newsroom panel held up their hands while a fourth held up a sheet of paper reading \\"I can't breathe\\", a reference to the death of Eric Garner. \\"Our hearts are with [the protesters]\\" was stated, but \\"hands up, don't shoot\\" was not said during the broadcast. The gesture attracted criticism because it appeared on a non- opinion-based program. =In music= During Pharrell Williams' performance of the song \\"Happy\\" at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards, the singer and backup performers made the hands up gesture. Macklemore and Ryan Lewis reference the chanting of \\"hands up, don't shoot\\" in their song \\"White Privilege II\\". On December 9, 2015, Daye Jack released the song \\"Hands up\\" about police brutality, in which he sings: \\"Living with my head down ‚Äì Hands up ‚Äì no no don‚Äôt shoot, don‚Äôt shoot\\" as a direct reference to the killing of Michael Brown. Kanye West references the gesture in his song \\"Feedback\\" from his 2016 release The Life of Pablo with the lines \\"Hands up we just doing what the cops taught us. Hands up, hands up then the cops shot us.\\" Kimya Dawson's song \\"At the Seams\\" references the gesture, saying \\"Hands up, don't shoot, I can't breathe. Black Lives Matter, no justice no peace.\\" =In religious art= In 2015 Rev. Mark Francisco Bozzuti-Jones, a priest at Trinity Episcopal Church in Manhattan, commissioned the icon Our Lady of Ferguson, which depicts the Madonna and Child with their hands up, in response to the Shooting of Michael Brown.http://nebraskaepiscopalian.org/?cat=32&paged;=2 =Hong Kong= From September to December 2014, protesters in Hong Kong rallied against the Chinese government's reversal of its promise to grant them full democratic rights. During what became known as the Umbrella Revolution, protesters reacted to the heavy-handed tactics of the police by invoking the \\"Hands Up, Don't Shoot\\" chant. Criticism In response to the death of Michael Brown, the Criminal Section of the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Missouri, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation opened an investigation into whether or not Officer Wilson violated federal laws. =Investigation= On March 4, 2015, the Department of Justice released their report of the investigation. This report found that physical and forensic evidence contradicted witnesses who claimed that Brown had his hands up when Wilson shot him. It also stated that witnesses whose testimony aligned with the physical and forensic evidence never \\"perceived Brown to be attempting to surrender at any point when Wilson fired upon him.\\" The report concluded there was no justification for a federal prosecution of Officer Wilson. =The Washington Post= In the wake of the report, many pundits began to refer to the \\"Hands up, Don't Shoot\\" slogan as \\"a lie\\" or \\"based on a lie\\".Capehart, Jonathan. \\"‚ÄòHands up, don‚Äôt shoot‚Äô was built on a lie\\", The Washington Post. March 16, 2015. Accessed: September 2, 2016 The Washington Posts Fact Checker feature gave \\"Hands Up, Don't Shoot\\" four Pinocchios denoting it as an outright lie. Despite this, the slogan has an enduring symbolic meaning for activists. As one protester remarked, \\"Even if you don't find that it's true, it's a valid rallying cry... it's just a metaphor.\\" Outcome =Darren Wilson= The Grand Jury found Officer Darren Wilson not guilty in the shooting of Michael Brown after the long-awaited investigation. This investigation came to an end in March, authenticated that Wilson involvement in this incident had been cleared of any legal or civil rights violations. This initiated an outrage amongst many citizens in the Ferguson community, which is what sparked this Hands Up Don't Shoot movement to begin. After this investigation came to a close, Darren Wilson was no longer a police officer for the Ferguson Police Department, and has moved away to a closely guarded residence which remains unknown. Given that this shooting has brought on a lot of animosity towards Wilson from people around the world, he did have supporters that saved up $500,000 to help pay for his protection and his legal defense team.Worland, Justin. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs Changed in Ferguson a Year After Michael Brown‚Äîand What Hasn‚Äôt.‚Äù Time.Com, Aug. 2015, p.

What led to these changes was an investigation performed by the Justice Department. In the investigation, which was published March 2015, they found \\"a pattern or practice of unlawful conduct.\\" This conduct includes an immoderate number of tickets and amount of fines that were disproportionately given to the black residents of Ferguson. In effect, a reform was put out that enforced changes to the conduct of searches, arrests, and general police interactions with citizens. Now officers are to wear body cameras while on duty, and minorities from the Ferguson Community are stepping up as police officers to strengthen the interactions between the police and the residents of Ferguson.

The aim of this alliance was to drive the Ottoman Empire out of Europe The coalition was led by Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor. The Holy See took for granted that Poland would join the League, together with all most powerful neighbours of the Ottoman Empire, in spite of their mutual enmities. The league expected an assistance of the Balkan's Christian population. The establishing of this Holy League was only partially successful, while Holy League managed to halt further Ottoman conquests in Europe. Preparations Already in 1583 a group of Cossacks proposed to the Pope to initiate crusade against the Ottomans. Ten years later, Aleksandar Komuloviƒá convinced the Pope to support his ambitious plan which also involved Cossacks. His plan was to establish military alliance which would undertake three pronged attack on Ottoman Empire. The first attack would be organized by the army of Poland led by Zamojski, the second attack would be led by Francesco Sforza toward Constantinople through Albania, while the third army of combined forces of Moldavia, Wallachia and Transylvania led by Andrew Batory would attack the Ottomans with support of Cossacks and Russia. The established of this Holy League was initiated by the Papacy already in 1592‚Äì3. With the outbreak of the Long War, Clement VIII sent missions to Emperor Rudolf II, Phillip II of Spain, and other princes. Clement VIII subsidized the Habsburgs with 600,000 scudi in 1594‚Äì95. About three million florins of subsidies were secured by Clement VIII over next ten years, as well as Italian auxiliary troops and France's neutrality toward Holy Roman Empire. The League was projected in grandiose scale, to also include Holy See, Spain and Venice. Clement VIII appealed to Spain and Venice in vain. He also hoped that the Swedish king Sigismund II would fight the Ottomans in his role as king of Poland. In 1597, Clement VIII sent a force under his nephew to Hungary. He did it again in 1598.  Mission of Aleksandar Komuloviƒá  = Background = At the end of January 1593 Petar ƒåedolini, a bishop from Hvar, sent a letter to the Pope inviting him to send envoys to Russia to forge a united Christian coalition against the Ottomans. In the same year a similar proposal was sent to the Pope by Komuloviƒá himself. An anonymous report from 1593, attributed to Komuloviƒá by many scholars, lists predominantly Slavic regions that could be mobilized to fight the Ottomans: Herzegovina, Slavonia, Croatia, Dalmatia, Serbia, Moesia, Bosnia, Rascia, Po≈æega and Teme≈üvar. Dalmatian friar Francesco Antonio Bertucci and Ivan (Janko) Alberti went to Rome to propose to Pope to start anti-Ottoman campaign by Uskok attack and capture of Klis and Herceg Novi. Their proposal was accepted At the beginning of 1594, Clement VIII sent clergyman Aleksandar Komuloviƒá of Nona to central and eastern Europe with the purpose to persuade the rulers of Transylvania, Moldavia, Wallachia, and Muscovy to join an alliance against the Ottomans. Komuloviƒá also tried to enlist the Zaporizhian Cossacks, who were important as frequent raiders of Ottoman territory. Komuloviƒá was to appeal to the Serbs about liberation from the Ottomans. = Members of mission = The mission was led by Aleksandar Komuloviƒá who participated in the mission in its entire period between 1593 and 1597. Komuloviƒá and Giovanni Battista from Cres maintained extensive contacts with the Patriarchate of Peƒá. Another member of Komuloviƒá's mission was Thommaso Raggio (1531‚Äì1599), who returned to Italy in 1595 while Komuloviƒá stayed in the Balkans until 1597 and submitted a detailed report to the Pope upon his return.: \\"While Raggio returned after a year, Komulovic stayed in the Balkans for three years....\\" He travelled to Moscow and twice visited the court of the Russian emperor, in 1595 and in 1597, but failed to convince the Muscovites to accept his proposals. = Countries, territories and people projected as members = This coalition was to include all Christian Slavs, including Orthodox Russia. Komuloviƒá traveled via Venice, Trent, Innsbruck and Vienna to Alba Iulia. The purpose of this trip was to convince the Tsar of Russia, King of Poland (including Zaporozhian Cossacks), the Prince of Transylvania and Voivodes of Moldavia and Wallachia to join a western anti-Ottoman coalition. His aim was also to inspire Serbs to rise up against the Ottomans. According to some sources he continued his journey to Ancona, Hvar, Dubrovnik, Venetian Albania, Kosovo, Macedonia, Bulgaria, and finally Moldavia.  Serbs  The burning of Saint Sava's relics by the Ottomans. Painting by Stevan Aleksiƒá (1912) In Pope Clement VIII's instructions to Komuloviƒá, the Serbs were explicitly praised as brave, while the neighbouring Bulgarians were said to be unwilling to fight. It is possible that these instructions were composed by Komuloviƒá himself. Still, the mission inspired a series of uprisings in Serb-populated territories, such as the Uprising in Banat and Uprising in Peƒá in 1594. Clement VIII chose not to support the Serb Uprising of 1596‚Äì97. Without appropriate support from other Christian countries all this uprisings were suppressed with heavy casualties for Serb civilian population. In an act of retaliation, Grand Vizier Koca Sinan Pasha ordered burning of the relics of Saint Sava, the patron saint of Serbia and Serbs. The Archbishop of Peƒá and Serbian Patriarch and the spiritual leader of the Serbian Orthodox Church Jovan Kantul who supported the uprising of Serbs was captured by the Ottomans and strangled in Istanbul.  Russia  Russia refused to participate using bad relation with Poland as justification.  Cossacks  After the outbreak of the Long War in 1593, Rudolph II sent his envoy Count Eric Lasota to Zaporozhia. In 1594 and 1595 Cossacks plundered Moldavia and invaded Transylvania.  Albanians  In 1593 a strange letter in Italian language was sent to Pope in which \\"elders from Albania\\" requested the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire and King of Poland to \\"move\\" against the Ottomans. Komuloviƒá was instructed to first travel to Venice to establish contacts with Albanians. In Venice he stayed in the house of notable Thomasso Pelessa from Albania. Komuloviƒá allegedly met representatives of \\"Albanians\\" in Venice. The Popes instructions and several letters Komuloviƒá had sewed in a cushion. When he left Venice he made tremendous mistake and forgot the cushion leaving behind three letters written in lingua Serviana by the \\"people of Albania\\". The Venetian authorities got in possession of those letters and concluded they were forged by Komuloviƒá, which is also believed by modern Australian historian Zdenko Zlatar. In July 1594, an assembly was summoned in a monastery in Mat, by Albanian tribal chieftains, joined by some Venetian subjects, of whom Mark Gjin was elected their leader. In 1595 he visited Rome to receive the Pope's support. The Himara Revolt broke out in Albania in 1596, but it was easily suppressed after the Venetians convinced some of the chieftains not to join the rebellion.  Republic of Ragusa  According to some rumours, the Republic of Ragusa was ready to expel Komuloviƒá because the Ottomans offered them some benefits if they did.: \\"The latter was rumoured to be ready to expel Komulovic, \\"due to its (Ragusan government's) benefits derived from the Turks\\"\\" Ragusans were worried because of the anti-Ottoman actions of Ragusan Jesuits.  Holy Roman Empire  In 1597 Komuloviƒá began his return journey and stopped in Prague to propose to Emperor Rudolf II to re-capture Klis, which had a year earlier been briefly captured by the Uskoks. = Result of Komuloviƒá's mission = Komuloviƒá did not succeed in forming the anti-Ottoman coalition, as none of the countries accepted the Pope's invitation.  Treaty of alliance  At the beginning of the Long War in 1593 Rudolph and Bathory prepared the strategy to include participation of Moldavia and Wallachia in the Holy League. In the summer of 1594 their emissaries, led by Giovanni de Marini Poli from Ragusa, easily convinced Aron Movila and Moldavian boyars to join the league. In November 1594 the Triple Alliance of the Three Voivods was established by creation of an alliance between the Prince Sigismund B√°thory of Transylvania, Voivod Aron Tiranul of Moldavia, and Voivod Michael the Brave of Wallachia. Facilitated by the Pope, a treaty of alliance was signed in Prague by Emperor Rudolf II and Sigismund B√°thory of Transylvania in 1595. Aron VodƒÉ of Moldavia and Michael the Brave of Wallachia joined the alliance later that year. Clement VIII himself lent the Emperor valuable assistance in men and money.

Its learning games, \\"Kahoots\\", are user-generated multiple-choice quizzes that can be accessed via a web browser or the Kahoot app. Kahoot! can be used to review students' knowledge, for formative assessment, or as a break from traditional classroom activities. Kahoot! also includes trivia quizzes. History and development Kahoot! was founded in 2012 by Johan Brand, Jamie Brooker and Morten Versvik in a joint project with the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. They teamed up with Professor Alf Inge Wang and were later joined by Norwegian entrepreneur √Ösmund Furuseth. Kahoot! was launched in a private beta at SXSWedu in March 2013 and the beta was released to the public in September 2013. Kahoot! was designed for social learning, with learners gathered around a common screen such as an interactive whiteboard, projector, or a computer monitor. The site can also be used through screen-sharing tools such as Skype or Google Hangouts. The game design is such that the players are required to frequently look up from their devices. The gameplay is simple; all players connect using a generated game PIN shown on the common screen, and use a device to answer questions created by a teacher, business leader, or other person. These questions can be changed to award points. The creator can choose, whether the player can get 0 points, up to 1000 or 2000. The points the player gets are calculated on up to how much can the player get and how long it takes the player to answer. The sooner the player answers, the more points they get if the player answers correctly. Points then show up on the leaderboard after each question. The player can also get a streak, meaning they answered more questions in sequence. The better their streak is, the more points they get when answering a question correctly. Kahoot! has now implemented 'Jumble'. Jumble questions challenge players to place answers in the correct order rather than selecting a single correct answer. It offers a new experience that encourages even more focus from players. Kahoot! can be played through different web browsers and mobile devices through its web interface. There is also an application. In March 2017, Kahoot! reached one billion cumulative participating players and in the month of May, the company was reported to have 50 million monthly active unique users. In September 2017, Kahoot! launched a mobile application for homework. Kahoot Group. Kahoot being used in an English lesson at a Thai high school As of 2017, Kahoot! has raised $26.5 million in funding from Northzone, Creandum and Microsoft Ventures. As of October 11, 2018, Kahoot! is valued at $300 million. As of 11 June 2020, Kahoot was valued at $1.5 billion and raised further capital from Northzone. As of 2020, a Kahoot creator can now use different question types. The Quiz is the basic type of question. It requires the question and at least 2 options, one of which must be marked as the right answer. Premium adds the possibility to choose between \\"single select\\" or \\"multi-select\\". Single select means that the player can choose only one option and Multi-select means that the user can select any number of the four options presented. A true or false variant is also available with the main difference being that the only two options (true or false) are fixed and cannot be changed. These two types do not require any account upgrades. The next question type is Open-ended, meaning the players must type in the correct answer to get points. The creator must select the accepted answer, however he can also set multiple accepted answers. The last type of question is Puzzle, which requires the player to align the four options in order, which the creator sets as correct. For example: Align the countries by population from the least populated to the most populated. Kahoot! offers Polls for Premium users. The interface is the same as Quiz, however, there are no correct answers and no points awarded and also Slides, which give the players explanation. The Word Cloud is still \\"work in progress\\", however it will be available only for Premium users. In the end of the game, there is an animation of the 3 best players appearing on the winners‚Ä≤ Podium. The players can rate the Kahoot based on their experience.  Research and prototypes  The game concept used in Kahoot! started out as an idea of Professor Alf Inge Wang at Department for Computer Science at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in 2006, which resulted in multiple prototypes that were developed and tested in experiments conducted in collaboration with master students. The idea was to transform the classroom, where the teacher acted as the game show host and the students were contenders using their own mobile devices. The initial prototype was named Lecture Quiz. Lecture Quiz 1.0 was developed in 2006 before real smartphones were available (first iPhone was released June 29, 2007). The server was implemented in Java and MySQL integrated with an Apache Web server, the teacher client has implemented as a Java application in combination with Open GL for graphics, while the student clients were implemented on Java 2 Micro Edition, which made it possible to run the client on both mobile phones and laptops. Those students who played the game using their own laptops could use the Wi-Fi available at the university, while those playing using mobile phones had to use 3G over the cellular network. The latter was a disadvantage, as the students had to pay out of their own pocket to play Lecture Quiz as the telecom providers at that time charged per megabyte transferred. The first experiment with Lecture Quiz was carried out in a classroom with twenty students at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology where the focus was on usability and usefulness. The results from the experiment showed that Lecture Quiz was relatively easy to use, contributed to increased learning, that it was entertaining, and increased the motivation for attending more lectures. From 2006 to 2011, four versions of Lecture Quiz were developed, where the main changes were related to improved usability, making it easier to create quizzes, and using newer technology for implementation. Lecture Quiz 2.0 was the first prototype where both teacher and student clients had web- interfaces. An experiment testing the 2.0 prototype showed that the usability had been improved both for the teacher and the student clients, and that the concept increased students' motivation, engagement, concentration and perceived learning. The last version of Lecture Quiz was version 3.0, with significantly improved user-interface implemented using HTML 5 and CSS3, avatars, and multiple game/team modes. Lecture Quiz 3.0 was tested internally at the university as well as externally at various schools such as at Skaun Ungdomsskole where the students rejoiced over having a test in social science. Since Kahoot! was launched in 2013, the research community has conducted many experiments related to the effects of using the game-based learning platform in classrooms. A quasi-experiment conducted at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology with 252 students participating investigated the wear- out effect of Kahoot! by comparing students' perception of the system after playing once vs. playing frequently over five months. The results did not show any statistically significant reductions in students' engagement, motivation, concentration or perceived learning over time, but there was a significant change in classroom dynamics (less communication among players after five months). The conclusion was that Kahoot! manage to boost students' engagement, motivation, concentration and learning after using it repeatedly for five months. The core factor to keep students' attention after heavy repeated usage was found to be the competitive nature of Kahoot!. There is also research that investigates how Kahoot! performs compared to other tools and platforms. In a quasi-experiment with 384 students at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Kahoot! was compared to using a paper quiz and a simple polling system called Clicker. The results show statistically significant improvement in motivation, engagement, enjoyment, and concentration for the gamified approach (Kahoot!) compared to the two other. However, the results did not show any significant differences in learning outcomes. Another quasi- experiment at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, in which 593 students participated, investigated how the use of points and audio in Kahoot! affects concentration, engagement, enjoyment, learning, motivation and classroom dynamics. The results reveal that there are some significant differences whether audio and points are used in the areas of concentration, engagement, enjoyment and motivation. The worst result was for the case where both audio and points were turned off. The most surprising finding was how classroom dynamics was positively affected by the use of audio. According to research by two students at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, the network latency in accessing the website greatly influences the quality of experience of the platform, in both longitudinal and cross- section studies, with a sample size N=21. It was found that about 70% of the sample size regard Kahoot! as having positive results on all delay levels, while a varying number of students (between 10-20%) report that the platform is too time-consuming, forming a direct relationship with the duration of the delay. A literature review containing 93 studies on the effect of using Kahoot! for learning was published in the journal Computers & Education in 2020. This is the first literature review that investigates most published studies (experiments, case studies, surveys, etc.) on how to use Kahoot! affects learning in the classroom. The focus of the review is on learning performance, classroom dynamics, students' and teachers' attuites and perceptions, and student anxiety. The main conclusion is that Kahoot! has a positive effect on learning performance, classroom dynamics, attuites, and anxiety, and the main challenges include technical problems, see questions and answers, time stress, afraid of losing, and hard to catch up. Studies included in this review use a mixture of quantitative and qualitative methods that reveal among other things that Kahoot! has statistical significant improvement in learning performance compared to traditional teaching and other tools, a statistically significant improvement on students‚Äô and teachers‚Äô perception of lectures, statistically significant improvement in classroom dynamics, and that Kahoot! can reduce students‚Äô anxiety compared to traditional teaching and other tools. In 2016 Kahoot!'s pedagogical quality was evaluated and certified by Education Alliance Finland (formerly Kokoa Standard). The quality certification is based on a qualitative assessment of the product's design. The assessment is done by teaching professionals who are specialized in quality evaluations of learning solutions. The evaluation method is developed by Education Alliance Finland in collaboration with Lauri Hietaj√§rvi and Erika Maksniemi, researchers from the University of Helsinki. The evaluation suggests that Kahoot!'s educational value is highest when students are creating quizzes of relevant topics because along with the quiz-creation students need to use creativity and practice 21st century skills.  In popular culture  Kahoot!'s growing popularity in schools led to it becoming an Internet meme. Its interface, as well as catchy musicKahoot Lobby Music - YouTube, has inspired many memes and social media accounts dedicated to posting such content. The website even has its own Know Your Meme page. On March 26, 2019, an Internet user by the name of \\"Max\\" created an Instagram account titled \\"worlds.largest.kahoot\\" with the purpose of breaking the previous record of the world's largest Kahoot! game ever. The game was to be live-streamed on the YouTube channel Maxed on April 19, 2019, but it was later moved to another channel titled Maxed Hangout. The live-stream had more than 50,000 viewers, but the game couldn't be played as the Kahoot! servers crashed when the number of players attempting to join exceeded the 2000 player limit. The organizer of the event stated that he would contact the company and reschedule the game.

Sanders, the junior United States Senator and former Representative from Vermont, began with an informal announcement on April 30, 2015, and a formal announcement that he planned to seek the Democratic Party's nomination for President of the United States on May 26, 2015, in Burlington, Vermont. Sanders had been considered a potential candidate for president since at least September 2014. Though he had previously run as an independent, he routinely caucused with the Democratic Party, as many of his views align with Democrats. Running as a Democrat made it easier to participate in debates and get his name on state ballots. Sanders's chief competitor for the nomination was Hillary Clinton, a former secretary of state. Sanders drew large crowds to his speaking events and his populist and social democratic politics won him particular support among Americans under 40. He performed strongly with white voters, but consistently trailed Clinton by 30 or more percentage points among black voters; polls showed a close race among Hispanic voters. Sanders focused on income and wealth inequality, which he argued is eroding the American middle class, and on campaign finance reform. Unlike most other major presidential candidates, Sanders eschewed an unlimited super PAC, instead choosing to receive most of his funding from direct individual campaign donations. In September 2015, The New York Times reported that the campaign had received one million individual donations, becoming the first in 2015 to reach that threshold. Sanders raised $20,000,000 in the month of January 2016, $5,000,000 more than Clinton during the same time period, with an average donation of $27. Sanders frequently mentioned this $27 figure on the campaign trail as proof of his grassroots support. Following the final primary election (the District of Columbia's, on June 14), Clinton became the presumptive Democratic nominee. Sanders did then endorse Clinton, and said he would work with her to defeat the presumptive Republican nominee, Donald Trump. On June 16, Sanders gave a live online speech to his supporters, saying, \\"The political revolution continues\\". On July 12, Sanders officially endorsed Clinton at a unity rally with her in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. On July 22, 2016, various emails from the Democratic National Committee (DNC), the governing body of the Democratic Party, were leaked and published, revealing bias against the Sanders campaign on the part of the Committee and its chair, Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Schultz subsequently resigned as DNC chair and was replaced by Donna Brazile, who was also implicated in the leaks and apologized to Sanders and his supporters. In the Democratic National Convention roll-call vote on July 26, 2016, Sanders received 1,865 votes (39% of the vote), which consisted of 1,848 pledged delegates won in primary and caucus contests (46% of the total) and 17 superdelegates (4%). After the roll call, Sanders put forward a motion to formally nominate Clinton, which passed by voice vote. Background Sanders at his campaign launch in Burlington, Vermont, late May 2015 Sanders's previous political successes were in Vermont. He has been politically active nearly his entire adult life. While in college, Sanders protested against police brutality, led a weeks-long sit-in against housing segregation, and worked as an organizer for the Congress of Racial Equality. In 1963, he travelled to Washington D.C. to attend the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. As mayor of Burlington, Sanders played a prominent role in building support in Vermont for Jesse Jackson's presidential campaigns in 1984 and 1988. In a November 2013 interview, Sanders laid out several reasons for mounting his own presidential run, including global warming (current climate change), economic inequality, frustration with the Citizens United Supreme Court decision, and the importance of maintaining public programs like Medicare and Medicaid. In a March 6, 2014, interview with The Nation, Sanders stated that he was \\"prepared to run for President of the United States\\" in 2016, but did not officially announce a campaign. When pressed on the issue, Sanders said he was discussing the possibility with people around the country, but felt that it was premature to make an announcement. After the 2014 congressional elections, Sanders continued to discuss running for president.Hafner, Josh (February 21, 2015) \\"Sanders rails on billionaire donors, mulls '16 campaign\\", The Des Moines Register. Retrieved March 11, 2015 On April 28, 2015, Vermont Public Radio reported that Sanders would announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on April 30. In an interview with USA Today on April 29, Sanders stated that he was \\"running in this election to win,\\" and launched a campaign website, effectively beginning his run. Sanders said he was motivated to enter the race by what he termed \\"obscene levels\\" of income disparity, and the campaign finance system. On May 26, 2015, Sanders officially announced his candidacy at Burlington's Waterfront Park. Democratic Party presidential debates Jorge Ramos at the January 2016 Brown & Black Presidential Forum in Iowa The 2016 Democratic Party presidential debates occurred among candidates in the campaign for the party's nomination for President of the United States in the 2016 presidential election. The Democratic National Committee (DNC) announced in May 2015 that there would be six debates. In February 2016, Clinton's and Sanders's campaigns agreed in principle to holding four more, for a total of ten. Critics alleged that the small number of debates and the schedule, with four of the ten on Saturday or Sunday nights, were part of the DNC's deliberate attempt to protect the front-runner, Hillary Clinton. Clinton dropped out of the tenth debate, scheduled to take place just prior to the California elections, citing a need to devote her time making direct contact with voters in California. A spokesperson from Fox News, the television network that was to air the debate, said, \\"Naturally, Fox News is disappointed that Secretary Clinton has declined our debate invitation, especially given that the race is still contested and she had previously agreed to a final debate before the California primary.\\" Sanders responded, \\"I am disappointed but not surprised by Secretary Clinton's unwillingness to debate before the largest and most important primary in the presidential nominating process.\\" Campaign Sanders in Minneapolis facing the first large crowd of his campaign, May 31, 2015 In a preview of his campaign, Sanders told the Associated Press on April 29, 2015, that he would release \\"very specific proposals\\" to increase taxes on the wealthy and corporations, offer free higher education at public universities, and pass a single‚Äëpayer Medicare-for-All healthcare system. He also noted his support for substantial regulation of Wall Street and his opposition to the NAFTA and CAFTA trade agreements and to the Keystone XL pipeline. He made the cornerstone of his campaign the reversal of what he calls the \\"obscene levels\\" of income and wealth inequality that have eroded the middle class over the last 40 years. On November 1, 2015, Sanders released his first campaign ad. A Sanders campaign field office Sanders said his campaign would focus on what he considered \\"real family values\\". \\"The right has claimed the mantle of 'family values' for far too long. When my Republican colleagues use the term they're usually talking about things like opposition to contraception, denying a woman's right to choose, opposition to gay rights, and support for abstinence-only education,\\" Sanders said. His \\"real family values\\" included paid sick time, paid vacations, and access to paid family leave. On abortion rights, he remarked that ‚Äú are saying to every woman in America, that she cannot control her own bod. I disagree. Let's say it loud and clear: Women control their bodies‚Äînot the government‚Äù. Sanders stated that he would run a positive campaign with \\"serious debates on serious issues\\" and that he had \\"never run a negative political ad in life\\". Sanders said that if he were elected president, his cabinet \\"would not be dominated by representatives of Wall Street\\". He cited Paul Krugman, Joseph Stiglitz, and Robert Reich as potential cabinet members. In December 2015, the Democratic National Committee suspended the Sanders campaign's access to its voter data after a staffer viewed data from Hillary Clinton's campaign during a firewall failure. The staffer denied accessing the data but the DNC confirmed it and Sanders apologized. The Sanders campaign criticized the DNC's reaction as excessive and threatened possible legal action unless the Committee restored its access. The campaign claimed it had warned the DNC about glitches in the voter file program months before. On December 18, 2015, the campaign filed a lawsuit, stating the Committee had unfairly suspended its access. The DNC and the Sanders campaign struck a deal the same day that restored the campaign's access to voter data. Addressing the platform of the front-running Republican candidate Donald Trump in an appearance on Face the Nation on December 27, Sanders said that ‚Äúany of Trump's supporters are working-class people and they're angry, and they're angry because they're working longer hours for lower wages, they're angry because their jobs have left this country and gone to China or other low-wage countries, they're angry because they can't afford to send their kids to college so they can't retire with dignity‚Äù. Sanders said that while he believed these are legitimate fears, Trump had ‚Äúconverted them into anger against Mexicans, anger against Muslims‚Äù rather than facing the real issue the American people need to confront, ‚Äúthe greed of corporate America‚Äù. Sanders also noted that Trump wanted more tax breaks for the wealthy and was opposed to an increase in the minimum wage. Sanders was frequently questioned on the controversy over Hillary Clinton's use of an unauthorized and unsecured private e-mail server for her correspondence as Secretary of State, and he consistently refused to use the allegations of wrongdoing in his campaign message. In late May, when it was reported that a State Department inspector general contradicted Clinton's claims of no wrongdoing, Sanders was asked about it by Chuck Todd on Meet the Press. He replied, \\"Well, again, you know, these are areas that I have stayed away from. There is a process, people will draw their conclusions from the inspector general report.\\" Sanders went on to say, \\"I want to break up the Wall Street banks. She doesn't. I want to raise the minimum wage to fifteen bucks an hour. She wants $12 an hour. I voted against the War in Iraq. She voted for the War in Iraq. I believe we should ban fracking. She does not. I believe we should have a tax on carbon and deal aggressively with climate change. That is not her position. Those are some of the issues that I am campaigning on.\\" =Fundraising= Sanders at a town meeting in Phoenix, Arizona, July 2015 Unlike the majority of other presidential candidates, Sanders did not pursue funding through a Super PAC, instead focusing on small, individual donations. Saying, \\"We now have a political situation where billionaires are ... able to buy elections and candidates\\", Sanders called for an overturn of Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission: \\"To equate the ability of billionaires to buy elections with 'freedom of speech' is totally absurd. The Supreme Court is paving the way toward an oligarchic form of society in which a handful of billionaires like the Koch brothers and Sheldon Adelson will control our political process.\\" Sanders raised over $1,500,000 in the first 24 hours after he announced his presidential campaign on April 30, 2015. This was greater than the amount raised by any of the Republican candidates in the first 24 hours after their respective announcements. By May 5, Sanders's campaign had received approximately 75,000 contributions and had raised $3,000,000. Required reports to the Federal Election Commission in July 2015 showed a total of $15,200,000 in donations to the Sanders campaign with an average donation of $31. On September 30, The New York Times reported that Sanders had raised $26,000,000 over the preceding three months, just short of Hillary Clinton's total of $28,000,000. But Clinton had held ten times as many campaign donor events as Sanders with many contributions of $2,700, the maximum amount allowed, while Sanders's contributions had mostly been under $200. Sanders raised $20,000,000 in the month of January 2016, $5,000,000 more than Clinton during the same time period, with an average donation of $27. Sanders frequently mentioned this $27 figure on the campaign trail as proof of his grassroots support, and even ran a television commercial on the subject. He also outraised Clinton in February 2016, pulling in $43.5 million to her $30 million. During March, Sanders raised $44 million from a donor base roughly twice as large as Clinton's. April donations were significantly lower, totaling $25.8 million. In April 2016, campaign finance watchdogs and Sanders supporters expressed concerns about the Hillary Victory Fund, which Clinton supporters represented as a fundraising committee composed of Clinton's presidential campaign, the Democratic National Committee, and 32 state party committees. The setup allowed Clinton to bypass donation limits and to solicit checks of $350,000 or more from supporters. According to Politico, \\"the Hillary Victory Fund appears to be pushing the bounds of joint fundraising in its online advertising campaign, which has included many ads urging readers to ‚ÄúStop Trump‚Äù or to support Clinton.\\" In April, a Sanders campaign lawyer sent an open letter to the DNC that alleged that \\"the victory fund was essentially a pass-through to allow Clinton to benefit from contributions that far exceed the amount that her campaign could legally accept.\\" In a news release accompanying the letter, Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver said ‚Äúit is unprecedented for the DNC to allow a joint committee to be exploited to the benefit of one candidate in the midst of a contested nominating contest.‚Äù Following the nomination of Clinton in June, Sanders thanked his campaign volunteers, saying, \\"Let me also thank the hundreds of thousands of volunteers in every state in our country who worked so hard on our campaign and the millions of our contributors who showed the world that we could run a successful national campaign based on small individual contributions ‚Äì 2 1/2 million of them.\\" Sanders's fundraising efforts have been seen as highly innovative in relying on online communication with voters and proving that a modern candidate can win presidential primaries without the support of Super PACs and big donors. Superdelegate support A superdelegate is a delegate to the Democratic National Convention who is seated automatically, not elected by voters in a primary or caucus. Superdelegates include distinguished party leaders and elected officials, including all Democratic members of the House and Senate and sitting Democratic governors. Other superdelegates are chosen during the primary season. Democratic superdelegates are free to support any candidate for the presidential nomination. As of May, the Democratic Party Superdelegates overwhelmingly supported Hillary Clinton. On Face the Nation, John Dickerson asked Sanders whether the Democratic system was \\"rigged\\". Sanders replied, \\"I wouldn't use the word 'rigged' [...] but what is really dumb is that you have closed primaries, like in New York State, where three million people who are Democrats or Republicans could not participate, where you have a situation where over 400 superdelegates came on board Clinton's campaign before anybody else was in the race, eight months before the first vote was cast.\\" Sanders went on to say that in the states in which he had won landslide victories he believed that the superdelegates \\"should listen to the people in those states and vote for the candidate chosen by the people.\\" =Speaking events= Sanders before a crowd in Conway, New Hampshire, August 2015 Sanders often drew large crowds, with many filled to capacity and some with additional supporters outside who could not fit in the venue but still wanted to attend. Early in his campaign, the media favorably compared his rallies' attendance to Hillary Clinton's. Events scheduled by his campaign were drawing \\"overflow crowds\\" around the country.Tamara Keith (June 15, 2015). Bernie Sanders 'Stunned' By Large Crowds Showing Up For Him. NPR. Retrieved June 16, 2015. Sanders drew more than 700 supporters to a mid-June event in Iowa, which The Wall Street Journal noted was \\"the same number who went to a Hillary Clinton event on Sunday that featured a buffet table and a live band.\\" After an estimated 3,000 people attended an event in Minneapolis, Sanders said he was \\"Stunned. Stunned. I mean I had to fight my way to get into the room. Standing room only. Minneapolis was literally beyond belief.\\" Beginning in June, crowds at Sanders's events became much larger than those of any other presidential candidate who had announced up to that point. At a June 20 appearance in Denver, Sanders drew an estimated 5,000 supporters at a routine campaign stop, equaling the size of the crowd at Hillary Clinton's campaign launch speech in New York City the previous weekend. On July 1, a crowd of at least 10,000 came to see Sanders in Madison, Wisconsin, nearly twice the size of the biggest crowd of his main primary challenger, Hillary Clinton. A Sanders campaign event in Council Bluffs, Iowa, on July 3, drew over 2,500 supporters. To date, this was the largest audience for any 2016 presidential candidate in Iowa. Sanders drew a crowd of over 11,000 on July 18 in Phoenix, Arizona. At that time this had been the largest crowd of any 2016 candidate, of any party. Bernie Sanders rally in Portland, Oregon, August 2015 On a three-day West Coast tour in August, Black Lives Matter activists interrupted an event in Seattle. The activists removed Sanders from the podium and Sanders looked on as they spoke. The campaign eventually shut down the event. On the following day Sanders spoke to a crowd of 28,000 supporters at the Moda Center in Portland, Oregon, and on August 10 more than 27,000 people showed up for his rally in the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena. On September 14, 2015, Sanders spoke at Liberty University, a highly Republican-influenced college, during their Convocation. In September, Sanders made three speeches in New Hampshire on Labor Day, during his first campaign swing since the launch of his political group, Our Revolution. In these, he attempted to convince the progressives who had backed him into backing Clinton. In doing so, he faced down vociferous objections from audience members who still supported third-party candidates such as Jill Stein, and those who objected to Clinton as their party's nominee. =Polls= Sanders supporters, January 2016 Nationwide, Sanders had considerable support among white and liberal-leaning Democrats but considerably less among nonwhite and moderate or conservative Democrats. An April 2015 report by The New York Times suggested that \\"nly about a quarter of Democratic‚Äëleaners hold the consistently liberal views that would potentially put them to the left of Mrs. Clinton\\". A June 2015 New York Times report said, \\"in an poll this week, 95 percent of nonwhite Democratic voters said they could see themselves supporting Mrs. Clinton for the nomination in the primary. Only about one-quarter of respondents said they could see themselves voting for Mr. Sanders\\". Two August 2015 polls showed Sanders leading Clinton by seven points in New Hampshire. Both the RealClearPolitics polling average and The Huffington Post Pollster average for the New Hampshire Democratic primary showed Sanders leading Clinton by about 3.5 percent on August 28, 2015. On November 20, an online NBC News poll showed that Sanders's national support continued to grow. A poll that surveyed 5,755 adults nationwide showed Sanders was the preferred candidate of 33% of Democratic and independent voters, still trailing Clinton by 16 points. Sanders continued to show a strong lead among young voters and trailed Clinton by only three points among white voters. According to a national Quinnipiac University poll on December 2, Sanders polled ahead of the top four Republican candidates in a general election matchup. In weeks preceding the Democratic primaries, Sanders was leading in New Hampshire by 50% to Clinton's 46% and behind Clinton in Iowa, 48% to 45%. A Quinnipiac University poll released on January 12, 2016, showed Sanders leading in Iowa by 49 percent to Clinton's 44 percent.Bernie Sanders Is Pulling Ahead of Hillary Clinton in Iowa, According to New Poll. Vice. January 12, 2016. =Caucuses and primaries= Sanders narrowly lost the February 1, 2016 Iowa Democratic caucuses by 0.25% of the vote (49.59 to Clinton's 49.84). He won the New Hampshire Democratic primary on February 9, 2016 by 22.4% of the vote (60.4% to Clinton's 38.0%), receiving strong support from voters who considered it important to nominate a candidate who is \\"honest and trustworthy\\".\\"New Hampshire Primary Results\\" (February 12, 2016). NYTimes.com. Retrieved 2016-02-20. This made him the first self- described democratic socialist and first non-Christian to win a major party's U.S. presidential primary. In his home state of Vermont, Sanders received 86.1% of the vote, denying Clinton any delegates. He also won \\"landslide\\" victories in Washington, Alaska, and Hawaii. On March 8, Sanders pulled off an upset in the Michigan Democratic primary, where polls had favored Clinton by significant margins. Of the 78% of pledged delegates allocated in primaries and caucuses by May 10, 2016, Clinton had won 54% to Sanders's 46%. Of the 715 unpledged delegates or \\"superdelegates\\" who voted in the convention in July, Clinton had received endorsements from 505 (71%), Sanders 41 (6%). Nevada State Convention At the Nevada Democratic State Convention in May, Sanders delegates were outraged by changes to and interpretations of rules that resulted in denial of the credentials of almost 60 Sanders backers, with the result that Sanders, instead of edging Clinton out in delegates to the national convention, came in second. Angry Sanders backers shouted down keynote speaker Barbara Boxer, a Clinton supporter. It was widely reported that some shoving, and throwing of chairs and other objects, ensued before Nevada Democratic Party Chairwoman Roberta Lange ended the convention early, but no actual evidence of chair-throwing ever emerged. After the convention was adjourned, casino security guards and local police were called to remove Sanders supporters who refused to leave the casino ballroom. Lange received death threats to herself and her family online and by telephone after \\"Sanders supporters posted Lange's home and business addresses, email and cell phone number online.\\" Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs said, \\"We do not condone violence or encourage violence or even threats of violence\\", and denied that the campaign had a role \\"in encouraging the activity that the party is complaining about.\\" The Nevada Democratic Party wrote to the Democratic National Committee accusing Sanders supporters of a \\"penchant for extra- parliamentary behavior ‚Äî indeed, actual violence ‚Äî in place of democratic conduct in a convention setting.\\" Sanders responded, \\"Our campaign of course believes in non-violent change and it goes without saying that I condemn any and all forms of violence, including the personal harassment of individuals,\\" but added that his supporters had not been treated with \\"fairness and respect.\\" In April 2017, The New York Observer reported that DNC chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz had \\"used the nationally reported Nevada Convention to attack Sanders supporters, spreading a falsehood that they were throwing chairs. Wasserman Schultz never apologized or rescinded her comments.\\" = Demonstrations = Sanders supporters organized various demonstrations in support of his campaign. They are known to have participated in large numbers in the Donald Trump Chicago rally protest and the Democracy Spring protests. On April 3, a large number of Sanders supporters protested in front of CNN Headquarters in Los Angeles, demonstrating against the amount of airtime Sanders received in comparison to other candidates. =Advertising= The campaign began to buy advertising in November 2015 when it spent $2million on television ads. In the last two weeks of December and the first week of January, the Sanders campaign spent $4.7million on TV ads, outspending the Clinton campaign. Prior to the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primaries, the campaign launched the advertisement \\"America\\". =Staff= The campaign staff included people with deep political campaign experience and people new to campaign organizing. Campaign manager Jeff Weaver started in politics on Sanders's 1986 gubernatorial campaign. Claire Sandberg was the Director of Digital Organizing. She worked with senior advisers Becky Bond and Zack Exley to run distributed operations leveraging volunteers where the campaign did not yet have paid staff. On April 14, 2016, Sanders fired the campaign's national Jewish outreach coordinator, Simone Zimmerman, after it was discovered that she had used foul language to describe the Prime Minister of Israel and Hillary Clinton on Facebook. The hiring of Zimmerman, who has a history of opposition to Israeli policies in the West Bank and Gaza, had been widely criticized by Jewish groups. = Gender discrimination allegations = In January 2019, The New York Times reported that allegations of sexual harassment, demeaning treatment and pay disparities pertaining to women in the campaign were being circulated by email. Sanders attributed any such misdeeds to members of his staff, claiming that he was not only unaware of them but had instituted new protocols for addressing such issues. Jeff Weaver, Sanders's campaign manager in 2016, acknowledged the existence of problems and expressed a desire to do better in any future campaign. Sanders extended an apology on CNN to \\"any woman who feels like she was not treated appropriately\\". Sanders's campaign committee issued a statement thanking the campaign workers for raising the concerns, and pointing at new policies in the 2018 Senate re- election campaign, already implemented prior to the events from 2016 coming to light. Former staffers sought a meeting to address the events, and in response, Sanders met with them in mid-January. The meeting was facilitated by three female leaders in workplace and employment matters. They stated that it was part of \\"a process to create practical ways for improving the campaign's culture,\\" and were hoping other campaigns would also take note. =Reception= Part of the line to enter at the Bernie Sanders rally in Washington Square Park There was widespread support of Sanders's vision of a \\"political revolution\\", but others believed his vision was unrealistic or overly left-wing. Speaking on Meet the Press on January 24, conservative political commentator David Brooks commented on earlier interviews of Clinton and Sanders, \\"If I didn't know anything about the race until I saw these back- to-back interviews today, I would think, wow, Sanders really has honed his message, and he's captured both authenticity and joy, and Hillary Clinton hasn't honed her message.\\" Filling in for Sanders at a campaign event in Iowa, Cornel West \\"electrified\\" the crowd, opening his speech by saying, \\"What a blessing it is to be here with all of my brothers and sisters of all colors here in central Iowa! Brother Bernie and I come from a great tradition, the tradition of Martin Luther King Jr. and Albert Einstein; the tradition of Helen Keller and Ella Baker; the tradition of John Dewey‚Äîwho is the founder of pragmatism, but he was a democratic socialist, too. The point is that, you see, democratic socialism is not some kind of alien element. It's organic and indigenous in the history of this nation.\\" After polls showed Clinton leading by a wide margin in the March 8 Michigan primary, Sanders won in what has been called \\"one of the greatest upsets in modern political history,\\" drawing comment from political pundits. ABC News wrote, \\"Bernie Sanders' win in Michigan will go down as the stunner of the election cycle to date, handing his campaign a fresh rationale and new evidence of his rival's vulnerabilities at a critical time in the race. Sanders‚Äô win will raise new questions about the presumed strength and dominance of Hillary Clinton's campaign. (It will also raise questions about the reliability of state-level polling).\\" Sanders said of the victory, \\"what we have done is created the kind of momentum that we need to win.\\" On April 1, 2016, Sanders was interviewed by the New York Daily News editorial board. Dylan Byers of CNN politics wrote that the interview \\"showed him having difficulty clearly answering some questions about both foreign and domestic policy\\". In response to the criticism from the press, Tad Devine, the senior adviser for the Sanders campaign, told CNN, \\"I understand when you go to New York you're going to get hit by the tabloids, that's what the primaries are about\\". The Clinton campaign seized on what they considered a poor performance by Sanders, and sent the interview transcript to millions of its backers in a fundraising email, arguing that Sanders hadn't thought through how he would accomplish his biggest goals. But Peter Eavis of The New York Times wrote that \\"Bernie Sanders probably knows more about breaking up banks than his critics give him credit for\\" and that \\"taken as a whole, Mr. Sanders's answers seem to make sense.\\" An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll conducted May 15 through 19 found Clinton and presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump in a \\"dead heat\\" within the poll's margin of error. But the same poll found that if Sanders were the Democratic nominee, 53% of voters would support him to 39% for Trump. Clinton and Trump were the least popular likely candidates in the poll's history. Sanders received a 43% positive, 36% negative rating. Clinton named presumptive nominee On June 6, 2016, the Associated Press and NBC News reported that Clinton had become the presumptive nominee after reaching the required number of delegates, including both pledged and unpledged delegates (superdelegates), to secure the nomination. On June 7, Clinton secured a majority of pledged delegates after winning the California and New Jersey primaries. After the final primary election, the District of Columbia's on June 14, Sanders met with Clinton and congratulated her on her successful campaign. On June 16, Sanders gave a speech broadcast live online to his supporters, saying: > I look forward in the coming weeks to continue discussion between the two > campaigns to make certain that your voices are heard and that the Democratic > Party passes the most progressive platform in its history, and that > Democrats actually fight for that agenda. I also look forward to working > with Secretary Clinton to transform the Democratic Party, so that it becomes > a party of working people and young people, and not just wealthy campaign > contributors, a party that has the guts to take on Wall Street, the > pharmaceutical industry, the fossil fuel industry and the other powerful > special interests that dominate so much of our political and economic life. After the speech, the head of National Nurses United, the first national union to back Sanders, said, \\"What we know about Bernie is that he will be there. He's always been there as a fighter in the Senate, but that he will continue to be there for us. But most importantly, his message was, we have to be there, we have to build a movement, we have to fight.\\" In July, in an effort to win Sanders's endorsement and his supporters' approval, Clinton endorsed several new policies he had advocated for, including plans to eliminate tuition at public colleges and universities and to increase spending for community health centers. On July 12, Sanders endorsed Clinton, saying in a prepared statement: > I am proud of the campaign we ran here in New Hampshire and across the > country. Our campaign won the primaries and caucuses in 22 states, and when > the roll call at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia is > announced it will show that we won almost 1,900 delegates. That is a lot of > delegates, far more than almost anyone thought we could win. But it is not > enough to win the nomination. Secretary Clinton goes into the convention > with 389 more pledged delegates than we have and a lot more super delegates. > Secretary Clinton has won the Democratic nominating process, and I > congratulate her for that. She will be the Democratic nominee for president > and I intend to do everything I can to make certain she will be the next > president of the United States. =Wikileaks email release= On July 22, 2016, WikiLeaks released over 20,000 DNC emails, some of which appeared to show DNC officials favoring Clinton over Sanders during the primary. Among other things, one high-ranking DNC official discussed the possibility of making Sanders's irreligious tendencies a campaign issue in southern states, and DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz referred to campaign manager Jeff Weaver as \\"an ASS\\" and \\"a damn liar\\" and repeatedly called into question Sanders's party loyalty. Wasserman Schultz resigned as DNC chair after the leak, replaced by Donna Brazile, and the Democratic National Committee apologized to Sanders.Released Emails Suggest the D.N.C. Derided the Sanders Campaign. The New York Times, July 22, 2016 Speaking on CNN, Sanders responded to the email leak: \\"it is an outrage and sad that you would have people in important positions in the DNC trying to undermine my campaign. It goes without saying: The function of the DNC is to represent all of the candidates ‚Äî to be fair and even-minded. But again, we discussed this many, many months ago, on this show, so what is revealed now is not a shock to me.\\"Emails released by Wikileaks raise questions of DNC's impartiality. CNN, July 22, 2016. In October 2016, WikiLeaks released emails from Clinton campaign Chair John Podesta showing that Donna Brazile, who was working as a DNC Vice Chair, had given Clinton staff information on the questions to be asked at an upcoming CNN town-hall meeting. Brazile has denied that she was showing favoritism. After the election, the U.S. intelligence community and the Special Counsel investigation assessed that the email leaks were part of a larger interference campaign by the Russian government to cause political instability in the United States and to damage the Hillary Clinton campaign by bolstering the candidacies of Donald Trump, Bernie Sanders, and Jill Stein. =Democratic National Convention= Bernie Sanders speaking at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, on July 25, 2016. Sanders received a three-minute standing ovation when he rose to speak at the Democratic National Convention on July 25. He thanked and congratulated his campaign workers and spoke of his work with the Democratic Platform Committee, saying, \\"there was a significant coming together between the two campaigns and we produced, by far, the most progressive platform in the history of the Democratic Party...Our job now is to see that platform implemented by a Democratic Senate, a Democratic House and a Hillary Clinton presidency ‚Äì and I am going to do everything I can to make that happen.\\" The first night of the Democratic National Convention was frequently disrupted with booing and chanting by a segment of Sanders's campaign workers termed the \\"Bernie or Bust\\" contingent. Even Sanders was booed when he said, \\"We must vote for Hillary Clinton.\\" The comedian Sarah Silverman, who had campaigned for Sanders but pledged support for Clinton at the convention, said, \\"Can I just say: To the 'Bernie or Bust' people, you're being ridiculous.\\" A July 25 report by the Pew Research Center tracing Democratic voters‚Äô support for candidates from March 2015 to June 2016 indicated that 90% of Democratic voters who had consistently supported Sanders said they would support Clinton in the general election. After Sanders lost the primary to Clinton, Jill Stein of the Green Party offered to let Sanders run on the Green ticket, but he did not respond to her offer. On October 28, 2016, Sanders was declared an eligible write-in candidate for president in California, with Tulsi Gabbard as his vice- presidential running mate. For write-in candidates' votes to be counted in California, the candidate must be certified, which \\"only requires that 55 'electors' sign on to declare a person a write-in candidate, not that the person consent\\". =Conclusion= On November 8, as Clinton was defeated by Trump in the general election, Sanders received almost 6% of the vote in Vermont, despite not being a candidate. This was the highest share of a statewide presidential vote for a write-in draft campaign in American history. He also received more votes in Vermont than Gary Johnson, the Libertarian candidate, and Jill Stein, the Green candidate, combined. Nationwide, it was possible to vote for Sanders as a write-in candidate in 12 states, and exact totals of write-in votes for Sanders were published in three states: California, New Hampshire, and Vermont. In those three states, Sanders received 111,850 write-in votes, approximately 15% of the write-in vote nationwide and 0.08% of the vote overall. On December 19, the day that the Electoral College convened in state capitols around the country, Sanders received one electoral vote for president, from David Mulinix, a faithless elector in Hawaii who also voted for Senator Elizabeth Warren for vice president. This was the first electoral vote ever cast for a Jewish American for president in United States electoral history. Two other faithless electors, David Bright in Maine and Muhammad Abdurrahman in Minnesota, attempted to cast their electoral votes for Sanders, but their votes were invalidated by their states' faithless elector laws. Bright subsequently switched his vote to Clinton as pledged, while Abdurrahman was replaced by another elector who voted for Clinton as pledged. Sanders was one of five people who received electoral votes from faithless electors in the 2016 election; the other four were former U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell (who received three electoral votes), Native American activist Faith Spotted Eagle, former United States Representative and Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul, and Governor John Kasich of Ohio. The seven faithless electoral votes for president were the most in history, with the exception of the 63 electors who did not vote for their pledged candidate, Horace Greeley, in 1872 (Greeley had died between election day and the convening of the Electoral College). Media coverage Some Sanders supporters raised concerns that publications such as The New York Times minimized coverage of his campaign in favor of other candidates', especially Trump's and Clinton's. A December 2015 report found that the three major networksCBS, NBC, and ABChad spent 234minutes reporting on Republican candidate Donald Trump and 10minutes on Sanders, despite their similar polling results. The report noted that ABC World News Tonight had spent 81minutes on Trump and less than 1minute on Sanders during 2015. On April 3, 2016, hundreds of Sanders supporters protested CNN's coverage of the presidential elections at CNN headquarters. Calling themselves \\"Occupy CNN\\", they claimed that major media networks had intentionally minimized Sanders's airtime in favor of candidates such as Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. In May 2016, MSNBC's Mika Brzezinski called on Debbie Wasserman Schultz, chairwoman of the DNC, to step down over the DNC's bias against the Sanders campaign. The July 2016 Democratic National Committee email leak revealed that Wasserman Schultz was angry about the media's negative coverage of her actions, and that she emailed Chuck Todd on May 18 to say that such coverage of her \\"must stop\\". Describing the coverage as the \\"LAST straw\\", she ordered the DNC's communications director to call MSNBC president Phil Griffin to demand an apology from Brzezinski. =Social media= Sanders used social media to help his campaign gain momentum. His campaign utilized Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, Tumblr and Reddit. Sanders gained a large online grassroots following, with supporters rallying support on Twitter under the hashtag #FeelTheBern. The Sanders campaign was also known for the intense social media activity of some of his backers. Some online activists who enthusiastically promoted Sanders and criticized Clinton supporters were pejoratively called Bernie Bros, insinuating they were sexist in their critique of Clinton. Sanders gained tens of thousands of followers on Twitter during and after his debate appearances. Although Twitter followers are only one metric of success, this led USA Today to speculate that he had won the October debate. =Popular media= Larry David parodied Sanders on Saturday Night Live Saturday Night Live (SNL) highlighted Sanders in its October 17, 2015, cold open with comedian Larry David portraying him in a parody\\"Democratic Debate Cold Open\\" (Video), NBC.com.

A Facebook group called Bernie Sanders' Dank Meme Stash was created to help spread information and comedic entertainment about Sanders. As of March 20, 2016, the group had nearly 420,000 members. =Online dating service= Sanders's campaign also inspired an online dating service, Bernie Singles. Founded by Arizona State University political science sophomore student Colten Caudle and co-owner David Boni on February 17, 2016, Bernie Singles became a trending topic on Facebook, Reddit, and Twitter. =Tinder= On February 5, 2016, members of the Facebook group \\"Bernie Sanders Dank Tinder Convos\\" (BSDTC) (a spin-off of Bernie Sanders' Dank Meme Stash) were reportedly being banned from dating and social discovery mobile application Tinder for promoting Sanders's presidential campaign. BSDTC members would send messages to other Tinder users promoting Sanders and imploring them to vote for him. In response, many BSDTC members' profiles would either become locked or deleted after being flagged for posting spam or being bots. Tinder spokeswoman Rosette Pambakian stated in an email, \\"We wholeheartedly support people sharing their political views on Tinder, but we don't allow spamming. So feel free to spread the Bern, just don't spam.\\" =Bernie or Bust= Wells Fargo Center during the roll call vote when nominating Hillary Clinton at the DNC \\"Bernie or Bust\\" refers to the intention of some of Sanders's supporters not to vote for Hillary Clinton if she won the Democratic nomination, but rather to write in Sanders, vote for a third-party candidate such as Jill Stein or Gary Johnson, or not to vote at all. The movement stemmed from distrust of the Democratic Party establishment and the party's primary system. The party was accused of bias in Clinton's favor beginning around December 2015, culminating in leaked emails just before the 2016 Democratic National Convention. Sanders repeatedly said he would vote for Clinton in the general election in order to avoid a \\"disastrous\\" Trump presidency and encouraged his supporters to do the same. The Bernie or Bust movement is often cited as one of the contributing factors in Hillary Clinton's loss in the general election via the spoiler effect. Other media commentators have disagreed. According to NPR and Newsweek, more than 20% of Sanders voters voted for Trump or another candidate (or did not vote) in the 2016 general election.Newsweek (August 23, 2017) The movement experienced controversy when, at the Democratic National Convention, comedian Sarah Silverman urged other Sanders supporters to back Hillary Clinton and remarked that Bernie or Bust people were \\"being ridiculous.\\" =Unaffiliated Sanders- for-President organizations= Among the organizations that worked to elect Sanders without any formal affiliation with his campaign was People for Bernie, an online group that grew out of the Occupy movement and was active in sending protesters to shut down Donald Trump rallies. Veterans for Bernie Sanders, also known as \\"Vets for Bernie,\\" was the first national grassroots association of military veterans ever to organize on behalf of a presidential candidate. VFB mobilized veterans in all 50 states to attend Sanders events, including a veterans' rally in Gettysburg. The group has been credited with developing innovative \\"social media content based around endorsements from individual veterans.\\" In April 2015, the grassroots group College Students for Bernie was created by college students from universities from across the country. The group served as an outlet and a resource for college students to take an active role in the 2016 election by campaigning for Sanders and fighting for progressive causes. The organization had over 260 chapters established at various universities and colleges in the United States. = /r/SandersForPresident subreddit = A popular subreddit with over 500,000 subscribers, /r/SandersForPresident was an organizing forum that mobilized resources for the campaign. As one of the first places Sanders announced his campaign, it was connected through Grassroots For Sanders, the campaign's digital arm. It was created on December 6, 2013, about 17 months before Sanders announced his candidacy, by Aidan King, a graduate of the University of New Hampshire, and David Fredrick, co-creator of Grassroots For Sanders. King eventually became the Sanders campaign's social media coordinator. Although the Sanders campaign did not control the subreddit, it communicated with its moderators. Kenneth Pennington, the Sanders campaign's digital director, told media company Mic that \\"We work closely with those in leadership roles on the subreddit to make sure that the large audience on Reddit knows exactly how to get involved in the campaign and spread the senator's message\\".

The Hill. November 10, 2015. Taxes Sanders supported repeal of some tax deductions that benefit hedge funds and corporations, and would have raised taxes on capital gains and the wealthiest two percent of Americans, using some of the added revenues to lower the taxes of the middle and lower classes. Reporting that offshore tax havens have allowed America's largest corporations to avoid taxes on more than $1 trillion in profits, Sanders also introduced legislation to end offshore banking. He believed the American government should invest the resulting revenue in America's small businesses and in aid for working people. Wall Street reform On May 6, 2015, Sanders introduced legislation to break up \\"too big to fail\\" financial institutions. With three of the four banks that were bailed out during the 2007‚Äì08 Global Financial Crisis now larger than they were then, Sanders believed that \\"no single financial institution should have holdings so extensive that its failure would send the world economy into crisis. If an institution is too big to fail, it is too big to exist.\\" Jobs Sanders introduced amendments to Senate bills that promote the creation of millions of middle-class jobs by investing in infrastructure, paid for by closing loopholes in the corporate and international tax system. He also supported legislation that would make it easier for workers to join or form a union.Bernie Sanders (December 1, 2014). An Economic Agenda for America: 12 Steps Forward. The Huffington Post. Retrieved June 27, 2015. Sanders's campaign website also recognized the plight of the long-term unemployed, citing that ‚Äúhe real unemployment rate is much higher than the ‚Äòofficial‚Äô figure typically reported in the newspapers‚Äù. Trade Sanders opposed the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement, which he called \\"a continuation of other disastrous trade agreements like NAFTA [and] CAFTA.\\" (transcript of interview with Judy Woodruff) In 2014, Sanders wrote that \\"the TPP is much more than a 'free trade' agreement. It is part of a global race to the bottom to boost the profits of large corporations and Wall Street by outsourcing jobs; undercutting worker rights; dismantling labor, environmental, health, food safety and financial laws; and allowing corporations to challenge our laws in international tribunals rather than our own court system\\". Federal Reserve Sanders proposed these reforms of the Fed: \\"Banking industry executives must no longer be allowed to serve on the Fed's boards...The Fed should charge (banks) a fee that would be used to provide direct loans to small businesses...As a condition of receiving financial assistance from the Fed, large banks must commit to increasing lending to creditworthy small businesses and consumers.\\"Bernie Sanders (December 23, 2015). Bernie Sanders: To Rein In Wall Street, Fix the Fed. The New York Times. Retrieved January 16, 2016. Paid leave Sanders became a prominent supporter of laws requiring companies to provide their workers parental leave, sick leave, and vacation time, arguing that such laws have been adopted by almost every developed country, and that there are significant disparities among the types of workers who have access to paid sick and paid vacation time. Sanders's Guaranteed Paid Vacation Act (S.1564) would have mandated that companies provide 10 days of paid vacation for employees who have worked for them for at least one year. He cosponsored a Senate bill that would give mothers and fathers 12 weeks of paid family leave to care for a baby. Sanders also cosponsored a bill that would guarantee workers at least seven paid sick days per year for short-term illness, routine medical care, or to care for a sick family member. =Environment= Sanders considered global warming a serious problem.Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders Spar Over Fossil Fuel Donations April 1, 2016 Along with Senator Barbara Boxer, Sanders introduced the Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act of 2007 on January 15, 2007. In a July 26, 2012 speech on the Senate floor, Sanders addressed claims made by Senator Jim Inhofe: \\"The bottom line is when Senator Inhofe says global warming is a hoax, he is just dead wrong, according to the vast majority of climate scientists.\\" He was Climate Hawks Vote's top-rated senator on climate leadership in the 113th Congress. =Health care= Sanders was a staunch supporter of a universal health care system, and said, \\"if you are serious about real healthcare reform, the only way to go is single‚Äëpayer\\". He advocated lowering the cost of drugs that are high because they remain under patent for years; some drugs that cost thousands of dollars per year in the U.S. are available for hundreds, or less, in countries where they can be obtained as generics. As chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Primary Health and Aging, Sanders introduced legislation to reauthorize and strengthen the Older Americans Act, which supports Meals on Wheels and other programs for seniors. Sanders believed that supporting seniors \\"is not only the right thing to do, it is the financially smart thing to do\\", because it decreases expensive hospitalizations and allows seniors to remain in their homes. NARAL Pro-Choice America gave Sanders a 100% score on his pro-choice voting record. =Campaign finance= Sanders supported the public funding of elections and supported both versions of the DISCLOSE Act, legislation would have made campaign finances more transparent, and would have banned U.S. corporations controlled by foreign interests from making political expenditures. He was outspoken in calling for an overturn of Citizens United, a 2010 Supreme Court decision that overturned McCain-Feingold restrictions on political spending by corporations and unions, as it deemed such restrictions a violation of the First Amendment. Saying that he believed that the Citizens United decision is \\"one of the Supreme Court's worst decisions ever\\" and that it has allowed big money to \\"deflect attention from the real issues\\" facing voters, he proposed a constitutional amendment to undo the ruling. \\"We now have a political situation where billionaires are... able to buy elections and candidates\\", he said. =Foreign policy and national security= Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict Sanders supported Israel's right to exist and supported a two- state solution.Bernie Sanders - Vox By Ezra Klein July 28, 2015, Vox In July 2014, Sanders formed part of the \\"unanimous consent\\" on the Senate Resolution in support of Operation Protective Edge, a military operation Israel launched on July 8, 2014. Sanders said that Israel must have a right to live in peace and security. He compared himself to the first Israeli Prime Minister, David Ben-Gurion. When asked about the Palestinian situation, Sanders consistently said that the Palestinians have a right to a state, while Israel has a right to security. A statement published on his Senate website read in part: \\"Sanders believes the Israeli attacks that killed hundreds of innocent peopleincluding many women and childrenin bombings of civilian neighborhoods and UN controlled schools, hospitals, and refugee camps were disproportionate, and the widespread killing of civilians is completely unacceptable. Israel's actions took an enormous human toll, and appeared to strengthen support for Hamas and may well be sowing the seeds for even more hatred, war and destruction in future years.\\"War and Peace , Bernie Sanders, Senate website Surveillance Sanders was critical of U.S. government global surveillance policies. He voted against the USA PATRIOT Act and all of its renewals and the USA Freedom Act and has characterized the National Security Agency as \\"out of control.\\" He frequently criticized warrantless wiretapping and the collection of the phone, email, library, and internet browsing records of American citizens without due process:Sanders Senate Speech on Surveillance. Iraq Sanders strongly opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq and voted against the 2002 resolution authorizing the use of force against Iraq. In a 2002 speech, he said, \\"I am opposed to giving the President a blank check to launch a unilateral invasion and occupation of Iraq\\" and \\"I will vote against this resolution. One, I have not heard any estimates of how many young American men and women might die in such a war or how many tens of thousands of women and children in Iraq might also be killed. As a caring Nation, we should do everything we can to prevent the horrible suffering that a war will cause. War must be the last recourse in international relations, not the first. Second, I am deeply concerned about the precedent that a unilateral invasion of Iraq could establish in terms of international law and the role of the United Nations.\\"Flashback: Rep. Bernie Sanders Opposes Iraq War Official U.S. Senate website Sanders called the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) \\"a barbaric organization\\" and \\"a growing threat\\", but did not believe that the U.S. should lead the fight against it, saying, \\"the United States should be supportive, along with other countries, but we cannot and we should not be involved in perpetual warfare in the Middle East‚Äîthe Muslim countries themselves must lead the effort\\". =Education= Early childhood Drawing figures from an OECD report that ranks the U.S. 33rd out of 36 nations in reading literacy, 27th in mathematical literacy, 22nd in science literacy, and 18th overall in secondary education, Sanders said, \\"In a society with our resources, it is unconscionable to that we do not properly invest in our children from the very first stages of their lives\\". He has introduced legislation to provide child care and early education to all children six weeks old through kindergarten. Sanders said \\"the Foundations for Success Act would provide preschool children with a full range of services, leading to success in school and critical support for hard-pressed families nationwide.\\" Student loans Sanders was an advocate of making college more affordable. He spoke out against the high interest rates on federal student loans, noting that in the next ten years, the federal government will profit by as much as $127 billion from them. He also criticized President Obama for signing legislation that temporarily froze student loan interest rates in exchange for allowing the rates to reach historic highs over the next two years. Sanders believed tax reform was the solution, and developed a plan to bring matching grants from the federal and state governments to cut tuition at public universities by more than half. He criticized both Republicans and Democrats for failing to institute reforms that will stop predatory lending practices in the student loan market. Tuition-free public universities Sanders was in favor of public funding for college students. He believed that \\"we live in a highly competitive global economy and, if our economy is to be strong, we need the best-educated work force in the world.\\" He further maintained that many developed nations in Western Europe have long taken this approach to higher education. Sanders expected his plan to meet strong opposition from the Republican Party, but said it was ultimately \\"the American people\\" who would determine its failure or success. On May 19, 2015, Sanders introduced the College for All Act (S.1373), which would have used a Robin Hood tax of 50 cents on every \\"$100 of stock trades on stock sales\\" to fund tuition at four-year public colleges and universities for students who meet admission standards. In addition, the Robin Hood tax would have included a .5% speculation fee to be charged on investment houses, hedge funds, and other stock trades, while a .1% fee would be charged on bonds, and a .005% fee on derivatives. =Cultural diversity= Racial justice Sanders was a civil rights organizer at the University of Chicago in the 1960s, and has a 100% rating from the NAACP for his civil rights voting record.

Hodges in June 2015, Sanders said: \\"For far too long our justice system has marginalized the gay community, and I am very glad the court caught up to the American people.\\" =Crime= Gun violence Sanders speaking at a rally in Vallejo, California, May 2016 Sanders supports banning semi-automatic weapons and closing a loophole that allows buyers to skirt regulations when making a purchase at a gun show. He is also in favor of instant background checks for gun owners, although he previously opposed the Brady Act, which provided for federal background checks. In the House of Representatives, Sanders voted for the 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. Speaking to CNN's Jake Tapper on State of the Union, Sanders said, \\"If somebody has a gun and it falls into the hands of a murderer and the murderer kills somebody with a gun, do you hold the gun manufacturer responsible? Not any more than you would hold a hammer company responsible if somebody beats somebody over the head with a hammer.\\" Sanders has said, \\"we have millions of people who are gun owners in this country‚Äî99.9% of those people obey the law. I want to see real, serious debate and action on guns, but it is not going to take place if we simply have extreme positions on both sides. I think I can bring us to the middle.\\" Sanders also dismissed the idea that gun control measures could have prevented the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, saying \\"if you passed the strongest gun control legislation tomorrow, I don't think it will have a profound effect on the tragedies we have seen.\\" Justice reform Sanders has called for reforms to sentencing guidelines, drug policy, and use of force policies within police departments. Noting that there are more people incarcerated in the U.S. than any country in the world at an annual cost to taxpayers of $70 billion, Sanders argues that the money would be better spent on education and jobs. He has spoken out against police brutality and the uneven rates of arrest of African-Americans and other minorities, saying: \\"From Ferguson to Baltimore and across this nation, too many African-Americans and other minorities find themselves subjected to a system that treats citizens who have not committed crimes as if they were criminals and that is unacceptable.\\" Following the release of footage depicting the arrest of African American Sandra Bland for a minor traffic violation, Sanders strongly condemned the ‚Äútotally outrageous police behavior‚Äù shown in the video, stating that: ‚ÄúThis video highlights once again why we need real police reform. People should not die for a minor traffic infraction. This type of police abuse has become an all-too-common occurrence for people of color and it must stop.\\" Speaking on Face the Nation on December 27, Sanders said that ‚Äúhe way was yanked out of that car and the way she was treated by that police officer is not something I think would have happened to the average middle class white woman‚Äù.

It was built from 1900 to 1970. It is also known as 10 WRAAC Barracks, The Lady Wilson Red Cross Convalescent Home, and Waterton. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 1 October 2003.  History  Waterton, 1906 The place which functioned as the Queensland Police College until 2012 at Chelmer, was established as a private residence, with additions in the form of staff quarters and a ward block constructed between 1941 and 1942 when the house was converted into a convalescent hospital for the Australian Red Cross Society. The substantial, middle-class residence is thought to have been erected for Thomas Beevor Steele, a Brisbane insurance agent. Steele acquired title to the Laurel Avenue site in March 1900. At this time the property comprised two blocks totalling nearly one and a half acres, stretching from what is now Laurel Avenue to the Brisbane River. A mortgage on the property taken out in September 1900 may have helped finance construction of the house, which was named Waterton. Steele, who previously resided at Indooroopilly, is first listed as resident at Chelmer in the 1901 Queensland Post Office Directory, suggesting that the house was constructed by this date. In February 1901, a Brisbane Courier newspaper article identified the Steele family as residing at \\"Waterton\\", Chelmer, a name that remained in use during its earliest years. In design and decorative elements, the house also suggests an early 20th century date of construction. Title to the property passed in September 1913 to Alison Eavis Harding Frew (1883-1952), a prominent Queensland civil engineer, who resided there until . A. E. Harding Frew specialized in bridge design, his work including approximately 80 bridges throughout Queensland during his career. He was a consulting engineer in Melbourne during the 1920s and on the Pyrmont Power Station at Sydney in the early 1940s. He was a consultant on the 1926 Brisbane Cross River Commission and was the designing engineer for the William Jolly Bridge in Brisbane, from 12 November 1926 to 1932. From 1932 to 1935 he was the Engineer for Bridge Construction on the Hornibrook Bridge project, the bridge linking Sandgate and Redcliffe. Much of this work was carried out during the period in which he and his family were based at 17 Laurel Avenue, Chelmer. In 1938, Harding Frew acquired two blocks of land adjacent to the southern border of his Laurel Avenue property, creating an estate of approximately with a long river frontage. However, he appears to have encountered financial difficulties about this time, taking out a number of mortgages on the property, and reputedly was bankrupted. In January 1939, Queensland Trustees Limited, as mortgagees in possession, offered 17 Laurel Avenue for sale at auction. At this time the dwelling comprised four bedrooms, a large dressing room, drawing and dining rooms, sitting rooms, lounge, spacious front and side verandahs and sleep-out, and a well-appointed kitchen and bathroom. There is a suggestion that Frew had made extensions to the house, but this has not been confirmed. The property did not sell in January 1939. In July 1940, title to just over near the southeast corner of the site was transferred as a residential subdivision block, and in December 1940, the house and the remaining land, nearly , was transferred to the Australian Red Cross Society for use as a convalescent home for Australian servicemen returning from the battlefields of the Second World War. The purchase price was , which scarcely reflected the value of one of the oldest and largest family homes in the Chelmer district. Title was transferred to Red Cross trustees Edith Wassell and George Rees in 1941, and to the Australian Red Cross Society in 1947. The Society converted the house into the Lady Wilson Red Cross Convalescent Home, providing for the rehabilitation of convalescent Australian soldiers, sailors and airmen. The home was named in honour of Lady Wilson, President of the Queensland Division of the Australian Red Cross at this time, and wife of His Excellency Sir Leslie Orme Wilson, Governor of Queensland. Conversion of the house into a convalescent home required additions to, and some alteration to internal partitions in, the main residence, and construction of a substantial dormitory block behind and parallel to the main house. In 1941, Brisbane architects Roderic Walter Voller, Ronald Martin Wilson, and Edward James Archibald Weller, as Honorary Architects to the Australian Red Cross Society, jointly called tenders for a new dormitory and officers' quarters for the Red Cross Society's Lady Wilson Convalescent Home at Chelmer. A contract for construction of the dormitory was let to contractor AS Taylor by June 1941, and tenders for \\"officers' quarters\\" (staff quarters) opened about August 1941. Minor works were still being carried out early in 1942. Photographs of the \\"Chelmer Convalescent Home\\", taken in August 1944, reveal that the northern addition to the house, which comprised the staff quarters, was constructed by this date. The place reputedly accommodated 73 patients. It is also likely that during the 1941-42 extensions including an institutional kitchen and dining room were verandahs, which has been replaced since with simple timber rails. In the early 1950s the convalescent hospital was closed and the property was leased to the Australian Military Forces from 1 April 1953 for use as a Women's Royal Australian Army Corps Barracks, occupied by the 10 WRAAC. The WRAAC had been established in 1951 in response to a severe manpower shortage created by the demands of the Korean War and national service in a time of full employment. In the late 1970s female soldiers began to be integrated into the Army at large and in early 1984, the WRAAC was disbanded. In its 33 years of existence, the Corps played an important role in the evolution of Australia's armed forces and the acceptance of women into this field. A valuation inspection of the Laurel Avenue property made in January 1953, prior to the military authorities taking up the lease, provided a thorough description (accompanied by plans) of the Red Cross structures on the property, and show how the buildings had functioned as a convalescent hospital. The core of the house contained recreational and office spaces, and a large dining room and kitchen extension at the rear. The northern addition to the main house served as staff quarters. To the rear of the main house and parallel to it, was a high-set, timber framed, fibrous-cement clad dormitory building. The main building (the house) was described as approximately 50 years old, timber-framed, with 8\\" chamferboard cladding to the exterior walls, and set on hardwood stumps which varied from to in height. The roof retained its original corrugated galvanized iron. The house was surrounded by extensive verandahs, by that date mostly enclosed, and the verandah roofs were lined with 6\\" vertically jointed pine boards. Flooring to the verandahs and much of the interior was 4\\" x 1\\" hardwood, with some 6\\" x 1\\" pine. The interior walls and ceilings were lined with 4\\" vertically-jointed pine. Most of the joinery, including early doors, fireplace surrounds and palm stands, were cedar. There was a front bay window with \\"colonial sashes\\", and French doors opening onto the verandahs. The main entrance door had leadlight surrounds. The dining room on the southwest corner of the main building had been extended as a dining hall, clad externally and lined internally with fibrous cement sheeting. Adjacent to this was an institutional-size kitchen. Bathrooms and toilets (which appear to have occupied an earlier kitchen wing) had vertically-jointed timber ceilings, fibrous-cement sheeting on the walls, and terrazzo floors. There was a laundry under the main building. At the northern end of the main building was the two- storeyed addition erected as staff quarters. This was timber-framed and clad externally with fibrous-cement sheeting. The ground floor contained an open lounge with a cement floor; an interior lounge with fibrous cement sheeting to ceiling and walls and hardwood floor; a dormitory, lined and ceiling in vertically-jointed timber, with polished timber floor; and a bathroom/toilet. A covered stairway led to the upper level, which had a hardwood timber floor, and was lined with vertically-jointed timber in the central room and fibrous- cement sheeting in two bedrooms and two dormitories. At the rear of the main building was the dormitory or ward block, containing two wards separated by a central ablutions area, and a doctor's room, sister's room, and store room at the far northern end. Floors throughout were of hardwood and the ceilings of Caneite. The ablutions area had terrazzo flooring and contained toilets, showers and locker rooms arranged around a central passageway running north‚Äìsouth, servicing both wards. French doors opened from the wards onto verandahs along both sides, which were screened with Aerolax blinds. A sub- floor extended the entire length of the building. It had concrete flooring and had been used principally as workshops. It was also part-enclosed as library headquarters for the Red Cross in Queensland (a large room at the southern end); store rooms; ablution blocks; laundry; boiler room; and French polishing room. On the western side of the library was an extension which housed the handicraft section. Beyond the dormitory building, to the west, was a detached, single-storey structure, timber framed, double-sheeted with fibrous- cement, and divided into two rooms, which were utilized as male staff quarters. This building had a \\"Super 6\\" roof of corrugated fibrous-cement sheeting. Close to the northern boundary, midway along the depth of the property, was a single garage which appears to have been constructed during the period when the place functioned as a private residence. It was hardwood framed and floored, clad in 6\\" timber chamferboards, and had a tiled roof. Beyond the garage the ground flattened out to a level floodplain, before dropping steeply to the Brisbane River. Comparatively few changes were required for occupation by the 10 WRAAC from 1953 to 1969, and during this period the Red Cross continued to maintain its library headquarters in the sub-floor of the dormitory block. About 1964 or 1965, the Red Cross subdivided the land into smaller residential allotments around an extension of Sutton Street, leaving the buildings leased by the armed forces on a much smaller parcel of land. At this period the house lost its river access. In the late 1960s a new facility for the WRAAC was constructed at Kelvin Grove. 10 WRAAC vacated 17 Laurel Avenue early in February 1969, although the Army's lease didn't expire until 31 October 1969. The Red Cross failed to sell the property at auction in May 1969, but toward the end of the year it was purchased by the Queensland Police Department for use as an in-service training centre. In January 1970, the Queensland Police College opened at 17 Laurel Avenue, offering a wide variety of specialist and qualifying courses. This function ceased in 2012. The main change to the grounds since 1970 has been the construction of a car park along the southern boundary of the property from Laurel Avenue to the former dormitory block.  Description  Abandoned building and grounds in 2014 This place is a memorable element of the Laurel Avenue streetscape, presenting as a large, Federation era house with prominent gable and sweeping verandahs, a big pitched metal roof and chimney, set well back behind an established garden and enhanced with mature fig trees in the street, flanking the entrance path. The entrance path divides around a large circular garden bed before leading to the front stairs beside the prominent verandah gable. The front section of the house consists of formal rooms, along the lines of former drawing and dining rooms, a sitting room and lounge. A bay-fronted room is positioned behind the front gable and is of the same width, projecting a metre or so across the front verandah. The front verandah turns around this room forming the southern edge of the house. Immediately to the northern side of this front formal room is the entrance hall, and to the north of this again are two rooms back to back around a double-sided fireplace. The position of this fireplace is conveyed by the chimney in the views of the building from the front. The verandah turns around this pair of rooms, forming what was the northern side of the original house. The verandah edge details are still intact along this northern side verandah, indicating that northern addition to the original house was built immediately adjacent to the original house rather than cut into it. The entrance hall leads to a north-south connecting hall with a formal room at its southern end. This formal room is identified by its own gable on the southern side of the house and a projecting bay window. The connecting hall runs past what is now a bar and leads to the stairs connecting the lower and upper floors of the northern addition to the original house. The next layer of rooms consists of an institutional dining room and kitchen connected via an original rear verandah to a toilet and shower room wing. Three storerooms/offices in an enclosed verandah exist opposite the toilets/shower rooms. These rooms appear original. As this amenities wing has an external chimney on its rear wall it is likely that this was the original kitchen/servants' wing. The main building is connected via an elevated covered walkway to the dormitory building running along what is now the rear boundary of the property. The dormitory building consists of front and rear verandahs, in various degrees of enclosure, and internally is planned around a central corridor accessing small, simple bedrooms and shared amenities rooms. It is highset with a largely open undercroft, and some simply enclosed rooms which could serve as store rooms or workshops. The addition to the north of the old house is of two storeys. The upper floor consists of a lecture room to the front, a covered verandah space in the middle and two office rooms to the rear. The lower floor has two rooms to either side of the central covered space. A staircase connects both central verandahs and another stair connects the addition to the original building. Internally, the joinery and fittings in the house are of good quality, consistent with the Federation era styling of the exterior, without being excessively lavish. Skirtings and architraves in particular are simple but generously proportioned. It is possible that some of the joinery and moldings currently painted were originally clear finished red cedar, or similar, which if re-instated would increase the visual richness of the interiors considerably. The walls and ceilings generally are lined with painted, tongue- and-groove, vertically-jointed timber, with either elaborate ceiling roses or coffers, bay windows, or decorative fireplaces used to elevate the character of the formal rooms. More simply treated rooms such as bedrooms and service rooms have been largely removed or remodelled. The later additions are altogether more pragmatic and possibly more altered to suit changing needs than the original sections of the building. The internal linings in the two storeyed addition and the dormitory building are generally a combination of tongue-and-groove walling and battened, smooth sheeted ceilings with simple, largely traditional joinery and detailing. The lowest, former house with its generous, pitched roof relates well to its front yard and the Laurel Avenue street trees. It is set well back behind an established garden and enhanced by mature fig trees (Ficus benjamina) in the street, flanking the entrance path. The entrance path divides around a circular garden bed which may be an original garden design feature. Mature trees such as a Jacaranda mimosaefolia, palms and mango (Mangifera indica) in the front yard, and the Camphor Laurel (Cinnamomum camphora) in the street to the south of the figs, contribute significantly to the aesthetics of the setting. The Federation era detailing and decoration of the old house, as seen from the front yard, is strong, well balanced and effective. The battened front gable and heavily shaped verandah posts with decorative sweeps and frieze in particular provide a strong visual appeal. The addition to the north of the original building is discernably different from the earlier building but arguably sympathetic in roof line and joinery. The dormitory building to the rear of the property and the other substantial changes to the house are contained at the rear of the original building, without detracting from the presentation to the street. Despite many years of pragmatic institutional maintenance and incremental change to suit changing functions, each historical layer of building work is clearly articulated, with limited impact on earlier fabric. The buildings in their front garden setting present a cohesive, substantially intact group demonstrating the principal characteristics of both a substantial, middle- class residence and a convalescent home.  Heritage listing  Chelmer Police College (former) was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 1 October 2003 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Queensland Police College (former) at 17 Laurel Avenue, Chelmer, was constructed as a private residence, Waterton, for Brisbane insurance agent Thomas Beevor Steele. From to it was occupied by AE Harding Frew, a prominent Queensland civil engineer. The place demonstrates the pattern of Queensland's history, being evidence of the early 20th century suburban occupation of the Chelmer district by upper middle class residents, who constructed large family homes in spacious grounds, many of which had river frontages. As the Lady Wilson Red Cross Convalescent Home for returned members of the Australian armed services from to , the place provides evidence in the fabric of the building of a Queensland response to the impact of the Second World War. Changes made to the building and grounds to accommodate the hospital have not obliterated evidence of the earlier function as a private residence. Following the close of the convalescent home, the place served as a Women's Royal Australian Army Barracks from 1953 to 1969, and as a Queensland Police College from 1970 to 2012, maintaining an institutional use which had little impact on the predominantly residential character of Laurel Avenue. Evidence of these uses is readily apparent in the fabric of the building. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The former residence in its garden setting is of strong architectural merit, exhibiting particular aesthetic characteristics valued by the community and demonstrates the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural place. This building is a memorable element of the Laurel Avenue streetscape, presenting as a large Federation-era house with prominent gable and sweeping verandahs, a big pitched metal roof and chimney, set well back behind an established garden and enhanced with mature fig trees (Ficus benjamina) in the street, flanking the entrance path. The northern addition to the house to accommodate the convalescent hospital staff is of interest in the sensitive placement beside or behind the original building, indicating that the appearance of the buildings from the street was of importance at the time. The addition to the north of the original house has a similarity of form with the original, and has been distinguished from the original in its use of fibrous-cement cladding consistent with architectural thinking at the time regarding its construction and the character of its use. The dormitory building is also fibrous-cement clad and this is consistent with its institutional use and pragmatic character. As a formerly residential building converted to an institutional use the place provides evidence of the impact of the Second World War on Queensland and is important in illustrating the principal characteristics of its type, namely a convalescent hospital. The dormitory to the rear of the site has been carefully sited to minimise impacts on the appearance of the original building from the street, while achieving a close link with the necessary service spaces such as kitchen and dining room inserted in the original building. The form of the dormitory building is of note - the central enclosed space functioning as either a single space or (as currently) a series of rooms off a central corridor, flanked by verandahs which can be either open or enclosed, is a generic form similar to other Second World War hospital buildings, such as formerly at Rhyndarra in Yeronga (now demolished), but is not a standard public works design. Again, the addition to the north of the house was custom-designed for this site and its particular use. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The former residence in its garden setting is of strong architectural merit, exhibiting particular aesthetic characteristics valued by the community and demonstrates the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural place.

The dormitory building is also fibrous-cement clad and this is consistent with its institutional use and pragmatic character. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The place has had a special association with the work of the Australian Red Cross as a Convalescent Home, with the Australian Army as a Women's Royal Australian Army Corps (WRAAC) barracks, and with the Queensland Police Service as a training college. The combination of these associations, demonstrated in this one building, gives the place significance in Queensland's history.

Life =Early years= He was Minister for Coal and Energy in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) in the 1970s. He hit the headlines in 1979 in connection with his perceived role in exacerbating the consequences of the country's weather/energy crisis during the winter of 1978/79. In 1930 Klaus Siebold was born in Laubusch, a small new town in eastern Saxony. Laubusch, originally named \\"Kolonie Erika\\" had been built ten years earlier to a plan by the architect/town planner Ewald Kleffel: it had taken on the name \\"Laubusch\\" from a nearby settlement that had been removed to make way for a lignite mine. Kleffel, who designed the town, had been much influenced by the English town planner Ebenezer Howard, but whereas Howard designed pleasant dormitory towns for London commuters, Kleffel's towns were built to support the rapidly expanding Lignite (brown coal) mining industry, and Laubusch was built to accommodate workers of the Ilse Bergbau AG mining company. Klaus Siebold's education and later life were in several respects shaped by mining. He trained as a miner. He then studied at a technical college dedicated to mining engineering, where he became a qualified Mining Engineer. Siebel was also selected for higher education at the prestigious Karl Marx Academy just outside Berlin, and here he gained a degree in Social Sciences. =Career= In 1952 Siebold took a job as a full-time official of East Germany's ruling Socialist Unity Party (SED/ Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands). Between 1957 and 1959 he served as director of a lignite-fueled power plant. He then became head of the Coal Industry section, both at the People's Economic Council (VWR / Volkswirtschaftsrat), and with the National Planning and Development Commission. Between 1963 and 1965 he was Deputy Chairman with responsibility for Coal and Energy with the VWR. He entered government in December 1965 as Minister for Primary sector industryNeues Deutschland, 23 December 1965, page 3. and was then switched in November 1971 to become Minister for Coal and Energy,Neues Deutschland, 30 November 1971, page 2. a position he retained till 1979. In April 1978 he traveled to Maputo where he signed an agreement to send more East German mining experts to Mozambique. Since January 1978 East Germans had been working in the Bituminous coal mine at Moatize, following a firedamp explosion that had taken the lives of more than 100 Mozambican miners.Neues Deutschland, 25 April 1978, page 2. As head of the East German side in the joint East German/Mozambique Economic Committee, Siebold visited Mozambique two more times in 1978, and was on each occasion received by President Samora Machel.Neues Deutschland, 11 July 1978, page 1 & Neues Deutschland, 19 December 1978, page 2. Klaus Siebold lost his ministerial position because of the Energy Crisis that followed the exceptional winter weather in 1978/79. He had sanctioned maintenance shut downs of power plant in January 1979 at a time when sustained heavy snow falls imperiled East German power supplies. The pumps serving numerous district heating systems failed and families had to be evacuated from their frozen apartments. In cold barns young cattle were frozen to death, as were hens in their battery cages. Shortly before the snow storms, on 13/14 December 1978, at the 9th conference of the SED Central Committee, Siebold was on the receiving end of the conventional lavish praise, here from a candidate for Politburo membership called Werner Walde.Neues Deutschland, 15 December 1978, page 5. In contrast, at the party's tenth conference, on 27 April 1979, criticism came from the party leader, Erich Honecker, who asked that for a decisive improvement in leadership from the Ministry of Coal and Energy. \\"Sudden power outages should on no account become necessary in the first place.\\" (‚ÄûPl√∂tzliche Abschaltungen d√ºrfen gar nicht erst notwendig werden.‚Äú)Neues Deutschland, 28 April 1979, page 4. On 28 June 1979 Siebold was sacked by the Chairman of the Council of State, Willi Stoph. His dismissal came without official plaudits, in eloquent contrast to the treatment afforded to Kurt Fichtner, the other minister dismissed at the same time: Fichter was fulsomely thanked for his work.Berliner Zeitung, 29 June 1979, page 2. After this Siebold was sent back to work in industry. Among other things, he worked as Director of lignite-fueled power plant. =Democratic politics= In the first, and as it turned out last, free national election held in East Germany, in March 1990, Klaus Siebold stood for election in the Cottbus electoral district, but he was not elected.Neues Deutschland, 9.

The Infantry School, now at Oudtshoorn, was established in November 1953, after a chequered career dating back to the South African Military School in Bloemfontein, established in 1912. It is the Infantry‚Äôs ‚Äúcentre of excellence‚Äù and offers a number of infantry-specific courses to regulars and Reservists. History = Early history = On the 1 July 1912, the South African Military School was established in the old President's residence in Bloemfontein. The school's name was changed to The School of Musketry on the 1 November 1912 and moved to Tempe in Bloemfontein. On the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, the school at Tempe was closed and all the members of the staff were transferred to Potchefstroom. These staff members were responsible for the next number of years for the training of volunteers for overseas duty. During 1920, the South African Military School was established at what was then called Roberts Heights (This has subsequently changed names twice, first to Voortrekkerhoogte and now to Thaba Tshwane). The college was granted the status of School in 1924 as a result of the training of the first group of permanent force Officer Candidates. The school was enlarged just after the outbreak of the Second World War in 1935 with the creation of the following branches: #G Branch #Weapon Training Branch #Signals Branch #Training Depot #National Reserve Volunteers #Research and Development Branch #Chemical Warfare Branch #Regiment Training #Armour Branch During the 1940-1945 years, certain of these branches were moved. The Regimental Training was taken over by the Weapon Training Branch for example. It was during this era that the idea was mooted that there should be an independent Infantry School. In November 1953 the Weapon Training Branch was officially renamed the Infantry School in terms of SADF order No. 206/53, but this renamed unit remained an integral part of the South African Military College. On 1 October 1963, after having been a ghost unit for almost 10 years, the Infantry School was finally established as a self accounting unit. At this stage and until 1 January 1964, Maj J. H. Rossouw, SAIC, was appointed Acting Officer Commanding. It was during this period that the decision to move the Infantry School to Oudtshoorn, its present location, was taken. = Oudtshoorn = On 1 January 1964 the new, fully fledged Infantry School opened its portals in Oudtshoorn to admit its first students under the command of Cmdt M. N. Horner, SAIC. Since that day, the School has undergone two major metamorphoses. The first being in January 1974 when, in addition to its established role, it assumed the role of the unit where National Servicemen Junior Leaders were trained. The second occurred in December 1976 when it was decided to remove virtually all Citizen Force courses from the School and transfer them to the Danie Theron Combat School in Kimberley. In January 1977 another historic event occurred at the Infantry School that is the advent of the first prospective Cadet Officer intake of then recently qualified teachers. In those years, the unit had shouldered its share of the burden of duty in the operational area. Later on it had become policy to send companies of National Servicemen to the operational area as part of their training as Junior Leaders. 1977 was an important year in the school's history as they received their Colours on the 1 October 1977 and were granted the Freedom of the City by the City Council of Oudtshoorn. On the 28 March 1980, the Infantry School received its own song from the well known Dirkie and Doll de Villiers. The song was handed over to the Commanding Officer, Col W.G. Kritzinger, during a parade at the school and the song was performed for the first time by the School's choir. During December 1980, the Exerce Perfectioni Statue was handed over to the School by the City Council of Oudtshoorn. The statue was unveiled by Gen Magnus Malan.

The Croatian Encyclopedia places his family's origin in Apulia, Italy.Hrvatska enciklopedija, Bartuƒçeviƒá http://www.enciklopedija.hr/natuknica.aspx?id=6101 who served as the titular prior of the commandry of the Order at the monastery located in Vrana, a town in present-day Croatia. He is known for his remarkably consistent efforts to turn Habsburg-Ottoman Long War into crusade of Christian alliance against the Ottomans. Originally from the town of Hvar, Bertucci was a relative of the Dalmatian poets Jerolim (Gerolamo) and Hortenzije Brtuƒçeviƒá (Ortensio Bertucci). Bertucci was a member of the Holy League of Pope Clement VIII. In 1592 Bertucci was in Rome where he received Pope's order to catch and kill Marco Sciarra, the leader of rebels, which he did in April 1593.  Plans for Anti-Ottoman crusade  Bertucci was at the heart of 1596 plans for the uprising in the eastern Adriatic region. According to some suggestions, the main reason for his anti-Ottoman activities were his plans to recapture the Priory of Vrana from Ottomans. The contemporary Venetian sources and later sources that rely on them considered Bertucci as papal agent, while some other sources simply considered him as an adventurer who managed to achieve access to the Pope through emperor Ferdinand II. Elisabeth Springer, an Austrian scholar who studied the career of Bertucci, emphasize that Bertucci's earlier attempts to access the pope (before he gained support of Ferdinand II) aimed to convince him to inspire general anti-Ottoman uprising in the Balkans and organize an anti-Ottoman crusade (Holy League), were not successful. Springer further concluded that Bertucci was actually an agent of Holy Roman Empire who initially gained support of Archduke Ferdinand of Graz and later emperor Ferdinand II and members of his court, for his anti-Ottoman plans. According to Bertuccis plan, the rebels (including Uskoks) would first capture Klis, Herceg Novi and Scutari from the Ottomans. That would trigger large Ottoman naval expedition into north Adriatic and draw Venetians, who otherwise refused to join the crusade, to join the alliance against the Ottomans. In the early 1590s the seat of anti-Ottoman conspiracy of Bertucci and his associates was in Ragusa. According to some rumours, the Republic of Ragusa was ready to expel them because the Ottomans offered them some benefits if they did. The seat of anti-Ottoman conspiracy was then moved to Split. In 1595 Bertucci tried to convince the Metropolitan of Cetinje Rufim Njegu≈° to accept union with Catholic Church.  Battle of Klis  On 7 April 1596 a group of Uskoks who were Habsburg citizens and about thirty Venetian citizens attacked the Ottoman-held fortress of Klis (Battle of Klis (1596)) and captured it with the support of some members of the Ottoman garrison. The Habsburgs and Papal State joint troops, led personally by Antonio Bertucci, were sent to reinforce weak Christian garrison in the newly captured fortress. The releaf troops were supplied from the port of Senj. The Ottoman forces first defeated reinforcement troops and then reoccupied Klis. The Habsburg general who was supposed to lead relief troops blamed Bertucci for this defeat. Bertucci was captured during this battle and briefly held in Ottoman captivity until he was ransomed. This defeat had negative influence to his further attempts to convince Balkan Christian rulers to rebel against the Ottomans.

Usually the purpose of the anchor defendant is to allow claims to be brought in a certain court against another defendant (not the anchor defendant) over whom the relevant court would not otherwise have jurisdiction. Accordingly, use of anchor defendants is often a variation of forum shopping. The reference to an anchor is metaphorical; \\"anchoring\\" the proceedings to the relevant jurisdiction where they might otherwise naturally drift to another court. Basis The use of anchor defendants as a litigation strategy relies upon two basic principles common to most legal systems. The first is that where a cause of action involves claims against multiple parties, it is convenient for all of those claims to be tried together to avoid the risk of inconsistent results. The second is that courts in different jurisdictions should seek to avoid holding concurrent trials relating to the same claims (this is usually referred to as the doctrine of lis alibi pendens), both the avoid the risk of inconsistent results and to avoid defendants having to respond to the same claims in different courts. Accordingly, whilst there is a general recognition that courts should only entertain actions against defendants over whom they have jurisdiction, most systems will expand this to include another defendant who is a necessary and property to a claim where there is proper jurisdiction over one of the defendants. For example, with the European Union, Article 6 of the Brussels I Regulation provides: :\\"A person domiciled in a Contracting State may also be sued: ::(1) where he is one of a number of defendants, in the courts for the place where any one of them is domiciled;\\" Similarly, the English Civil Procedure Rules provide in RSC Order 11 (found in Schedule 1): :\\"Rule 1 (1) Provided that the claim form does not contain any claim mentioned in Order 75, r.2 (1) and is not a claim form to which paragraph (2) of this rule applies, a claim form may be served out of the jurisdiction with the permission of the Court if‚Äî ::... ::(c) the claim is brought against a person duly served within or out of the jurisdiction and a person out of the jurisdiction is a necessary or proper party thereto;\\" Limitations As with other types of forum shopping, the courts in various jurisdictions have taken steps to try and prevent the abuse of court system by using anchor defendants. However, attempts to do so will always be limited by the powerful countervailing considerations of the need to ensure that all connected actions should be tried by a single court where ever possible. For example, in Sharples v Eason & Son[1911] 2 IR 436 it was held that leave ought not be given to serve a claim outside of the jurisdiction if the sole, or predominant, reason for beginning the action a party duly served within the jurisdiction is to enable an application to be made to serve parties outside of the jurisdiction. Furthermore, even where the use of an anchor defendant successfully vests the jurisdiction to try an action against a foreign defendant in a court, the court will often have a general residual discretion to stay the proceedings on the basis that it is not the most appropriate court to try the case (the doctrine of forum non conveniens). In AK Investment CJSC v Kyrgyz Mobil Tel Ltd[2011] UKPC 7 Lord Collins gave the opinion of the Privy Council summarising the applicable principles of common lawThe case was an appeal from Isle of Man, but the principles enunciated by Lord Collins were based upon English legal precedent. in relation to determining whether it was proper to grant leave to serve proceedings on a foreign defendant who the court would not otherwise have jurisdiction over after the action had been originally commenced against an anchor defendant: # The fact that the motive in suing an anchor defendant is merely to bring another defendant into the jurisdiction to be joined to the action does not necessarily mean the court will exercise its discretion against giving permission to serve proceedings on a foreign defendant outside of the jurisdiction. But it is a factor which the court will consider in the exercise of its discretion. # However, there must be a serious issue to be tried against the anchor defendant. If there is no serious issue to be tried, or if the claim against the anchor defendant is bound to fail, then the foreign defendant should not be joined. # If there is a serious issue to be tried, is the connection between the anchor defendant and the foreign defendant such that the foreign defendant truly a \\"necessary and proper party\\" to that action? The Court should look to determine if there is \\"one investigation\\" against both parties, or whether the claims against both defendants are \\"closely bound up\\" with each other. Lord Collins subsequently endorsed his own decision on those points in Nilon Limited v Royal Westminster Investments S.A..[2015] UKPC 2 Examples In Multinational Gas and Petrochemical Co v Multinational Gas and Petrochemical Services Ltd[1983] Ch 258 the liquidators of an insolvent company incorporated in Liberia wished to bring claims against the company directors in England for breach of duty and negligence. However, none of the directors were resident in Britain and none of the actions complained of had occurred within the United Kingdom. Accordingly, the liquidators brought a claim against the company's brokers (which was an affiliated company incorporated in England) alleging negligence. The claimant company then sought to join the former directors claiming they had been negligent in reviewing the advice provided by the brokers, and that the directors were a necessary and proper party to the action. The English Court of Appeal held that the only basis for bringing proceedings against the broker was to try and bring the former directors within the jurisdiction of the court, and for this and other reasonsThey also held that there was no sustainable cause of action against the directors under Liberian law because the acts complained of had been ratified by the members of the plaintiff company. they refused to grant leave to serve the writ outside of the jurisdiction on the directors.

He is the principal and a partner of InSite Development, LLC which owns and manages 3500+ apartment units and 320,000 square feet of commercial throughout Southern California. He is best known for revitalization and redevelopment of downtown Lancaster, California. Early life and education Ehrlich was born on July 20, 1965 in Hollywood, California and currently lives in Agoura Hills, California. He earned his bachelor's degree from University of Arizona.  Career  =Real estate development= Ehrlich began his real estate career in 1986, specializing in the financing and development of affordable housing projects using Low Income Housing Tax Credits, Tax Exempt Bond Financing, HUD Section 202 Loans, Redevelopment Set Asides Funds, Mello Roos Districts, Community Development Block Grant Funds, Century Freeway Housing Loans, and CRA programs. Since then, Ehrlich has worked with redevelopment agencies, municipalities, and private developers to fund in excess $214 million for affordable housing projects and commercial redevelopment. Ehrlich has been an integral part in creating over 4,000 newly constructed and rehabilitated apartments throughout California. As a partner of InSite Development, Ehrlich began his Lancaster endeavors by purchasing existing apartment buildings in the Antelope Valley in 1998. From there, InSite Development worked on new construction deals funded by Low Income Housing Tax Credits to build senior housing projects in 2004 and 2005, and partnered with Mental Health America Los Angeles for another project in 2006. In 2009, Ehrlich had a vision to change the image of Lancaster. Working closely with elected officials and City staff, he made plans for the revitalization of the downtown. The first downtown project was the Arbor Artist Lofts, completed in August 2009. The Lofts won the 2010 AIA HUD Secretary's Housing and Community Design Award. In 2009, Ehrlich developed another project, \\"BeX Bar & Grill\\" in Lancaster which has since closed. Since the arbor lofts, Ehrlich and his team have revitalized downtown Lancaster in a relatively short amount of time. In 2010, Ehrlich began the project of Lancaster Boulevard. It transformed the four-lane, automobile-dominated thoroughfare into a pedestrian-friendly boulevard. The BLVD has won numerous awards, including the 2011 APA Planning Excellence in Implementation Award of Merit, the 2012 National Award for Smart Growth Achievement, the 2012 California Redevelopment Association Award of Excellence, the 2012 California Downtown Association Award, the 2013 International Downtown Association Pinnacle Award and the 2014 San Fernando Valley Business Journal's Commercial Real Estate Awards. The Laemmle BLVD Cinema In 2011, Ehrlich developed The Laemmle BLVD Cinemas, which is only luxury style cinema in the Antelope Valley area. It opened to the public on August 14, 2011. He also helped with the development of The BLVD's Renaissance Center. Ehrlich also developed Kinetic Brewing Company in Lancaster which won two bronze medals at the Great American Beer Festival in 2013, which has since closed. In 2012, a new eatery, the 1800 Restaurant on The BLVD in Lancaster was established by Ehrlich's InSite Development with assistance from the City's Commercial Property Improvement Program (CPIP). In the same year, Ehrlich renovated the \\"Woolworth Building\\" to an 8,000 square foot, two-story complex on the BLVD. Later in 2012, Ehrlich's InSite Development, owns and constructed a museum of art history (MOAH) for the city. Ehrlich has a hand in many other BLVD projects such as an underground bowling alley, coffee and yogurts kiosks, the micro-brewery, candy shop, clothing stores, gift shops, cupcake shop, a dog groomer as well as a motorcycle apparel and bike shop. Ehrlich has also been a catalyst for many other entrepreneurial developments in The BLVD area. =Film making= Ehrlich always had the dream of being in a musical, but due to difficulties landing a part without any experience in acting or singing, he wrote an original musical for the stage, \\"Pearly Gates: the Musical\\". He also directed, produced and starred in the musical. It was performed in March and April 2011 in front of 3000 people in 3 theaters in Los Angeles: The El Portal, The Lancaster Performing Arts Center, and The Thousand Oaks Performing Arts Center. Later, Ehrlich has made his first independent feature film of the same name which is scheduled for release in early 2015. The film stars Scott Grimes, Uzo Aduba, Peter Bogdanovich, Bonnie Somerville, Lainie Kazan, Illeana Douglas, Sam McMurray, Larry Miller and Jack Noseworthy. Other works Ehrlich played Professional Tennis in Europe. He won Los Angeles City High School Tennis Championship in Senior Year of High School 1983. In 2014, he was the Coach of California Girls Soccer Team and won the State Cup Championship.

It was built from the 1920s onwards. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 12 December 2003.  History  Edward Harold Fulcher Swain Edward Swain purchased the 1.5 acres of riverfront land for this house in 1920 when he was Director of Forests in Queensland. He took out a mortgage for ¬£1,300 and constructed a California Bungalow style home in which he was living by 1925. He surrounded the house with extensive plantings of native and exotic trees reflecting his life's work in forestry. Edward Harold Fulcher Swain was born in Sydney in 1883 and was the first Cadet Forester in the New South Wales Forestry Branch in 1899. He studied forestry in Montana, USA in 1915 and on his return became a District Forest Inspector in Queensland. Between 1918 and 1924 he was Director of Forests in Queensland. During this time he set aside large tracts of hoop pine forest in the Brisbane and Mary River valleys and planted areas of introduced species. On the abolition of the office of Director in 1924, he became inaugural Chairman of the Queensland Forestry Board until 1932. This Board was responsible for the management and control of the State Forests and National Parks. Swain laid the foundations of modern forestry economics in Queensland. His new ideas and strong personality frequently brought him into conflict with others and he was often a controversial figure in an industry deeply rooted in traditional practice. Amongst other achievements, he pioneered forest assessment surveys, promoted the permanent reservation of good forests and forest land, improved pricing policies which led to a better use of timber resources and expanded staff training and the activities of his department. He wrote a number of books on forestry, was a founder of the Australian Forestry School at the Australian National University and supported community interest in trees. In 1924, he was instrumental in establishing the Sherwood Arboretum, a park on the Brisbane River, which is dedicated to the growth of indigenous trees. In 1932, Swain publicly campaigned against the indiscriminate allocation of forested land as land grants, at the time a policy of the incumbent National Party Government. Although the Labor Party won the election, in the controversy and inquiries which followed Swain lost his job. He became a research consultant for Australian Paper Manufacturers in South Australia before becoming Commissioner for Forests in New South Wales until his official retirement in 1948. Between 1951 and 1955 he was United Nations Forestry Consultant in Ethiopia. Swain died in Brisbane in July 1970. His daughter Nancy and her husband occupied the family home from 1946. She shared her father's interest in indigenous species and planted rainforest trees in the grounds. The house itself reflects Swain's obsession with exploring the potential of Australian timbers. It was constructed of rosewood with the intention of proving that this timber, then not well regarded for the purpose, was suitable for building. The house also displays Queensland timbers to advantage, the joinery including panelling in pine and kauri. Most of the trees planted by Swain and his family survive and are now large trees that make a major contribution to the landscape of the area. The Alan Fletcher Research Station of the Department of Primary Industries nearby uses the hoop pine plantation for research into forestry practices. The house held a number of social events including a local private schools annual dance in the year of 2007.  Description  Residence and driveway, 2014 The Swain house is a single storey timber dwelling with a triple gabled front elevation. It has a hipped roof clad in terracotta tiles. The interior is substantially intact and has a sunroom at the front of the house. The dining and living areas are linked and there is a large sandstone fireplace in the living room. The dining room is lined with timber and a two-way, lead-lighted cupboard, previously linking the dining room and kitchen, now links the kitchen and former breakfast room. At the right hand side of the house are bedrooms and at the rear there is a bathroom, sitting room and maid's room. Part of the rear verandah has been enclosed to form a bedroom. An open deck has been added to the rear and left-hand side of the house. The house is set in an extensive and intact 1920s garden that includes a grass tennis court. The garden contains most of the native and exotic trees planted by Swain in the 1920s and many fruit and rainforest trees. The grounds contain a large plantation of hoop and kauri pine trees near the bank of Brisbane River and a number of mature cedar trees. A row of mature kauri trees lines the southern boundary of the land and tallow wood, crows ash, satinay and yellow pine trees are found in a group to the right of the site behind the tennis court. On a slope to the rear of the house are fruit trees including a loquat, mulberry and mandarin and two eucalyptus trees.  Heritage listing  Swain House was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 12 December 2003 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Swain house was built in the early 1920s on a 1.5 acre block of land fronting the Brisbane River at Chelmer. The land has not been subdivided since the house was built and as a comparatively modest family home in grounds of this size and location, it illustrates and early phase in the development of Brisbane. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The house is a good example its type and era, being substantially intact in both form and internal features. It is rare in retaining its original setting in extensive grounds with mature indigenous trees on the bank of the Brisbane River. Such features as the maid's room and grass tennis court, which illustrate a way of life now passed, are uncommon. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The house and its setting, particularly the stands of mature trees planted by EHF Swain, have aesthetic value and make an important contribution to the streetscape. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. EHF Swain was a nationally significant figure in the development of the forestry industry in Australia and his house and tree plantings have a strong association with his life and work, illustrating his interest in timber and forestry research. The hoop pine plantation continues to be of value for research purposes.

He succeeded the Metropolitan duo of Nikanor and Stevan (s. 1591‚Äì93). Rufim Njegu≈° and Metropolitan Visarion of Trebinje (s. 1590‚Äì1602) aided the Banat Uprising (1594). In 1595 Francesco Antonio Bertucci tried to convince Rufim to accept union with Catholic Church. He was succeeded by Mardarije Korneƒçanin (s. 1637‚Äì59). Rufim is famous as being the first metropolitan who actively took part in armed confrontations with the Ottomans, leading Montenegrin army in three major battles in 1601, 1604 and 1613. Battle of Lje≈°kopolje (1604) Sanjak-bey of Shkod√´r Ali-beg Mimibegoviƒá led an army of 12,000 from Podgorica and clashed with 400 Montenegrins in Lje≈°anska nahija. Rufim reinforced them with 500 Katunjani during the day and sent dozens of small three-members groups, in total amount of 50 warriors to spy and to attack the opponent from rear. The battle lasted through whole night, when at the dawn Montenegrins launched a sudden charge surprising the enemy. Ali-beg was wounded and retreated with 3,500 casualties, while his second-in-command ≈†aban ƒÜehaja was killed. Battle of Kosov lug (1613) Towards the end of September newly appointed Sanjak-bey of Shkod√´r Arslan-bey Baliƒáeviƒá renewed attacks on Montenegrins, splitting his forces in two, and tasking first army with penetration to Cetinje and second army with suppressing rebellious forces around Spu≈æ. Both armies failed, as the first one was stopped in Lje≈°anska nahija again without reaching Cetinje, and the second one was defeated when Rufim personally led a side attack of 700 Katunjani in the aid of Piperi, Bjelopavliƒái and Rovƒçani forces which were already engaging enemy around the village of Kosov lug. The battle resulted in Sultan's official recognition of Montenegrin autonomy, by issuing a berat which states that : \\"... no Turkish official, if not authorised by sultan , can enter Montenegro without the permission from Montenegrins themselves\\" http://vremenskalinija.me/History%20of%20Montenegro%20T%20Line%206.html Legacy Although informations about his life are scarce, Rufim is one of better known Metropolitans of Montenegrin history from predynastic period. His long tenure is well remembered and he is often mentioned as a contemporary of Patriarch Pajsije. In his \\"History of Montenegro\\" Sima Sarajlija lists as one of his more memorable deeds that he: It is, thus, possible that it was him, rather than Metropolitan Rufim Boljeviƒá who famously converted Kuƒçi Vojvode Lale Drekalov. Many authors, most notably Marko Miljanov, cite Boljeviƒá as being the one, however the dates don't add up, since being mentioned in 1614, Lale precedes Boljeviƒá's tenure as Metropolitan by a couple of decades. See also *List of Metropolitans of Montenegro Annotations *Name: His name is mostly spelled Rufim Njegu≈° (–†—É—Ñ–∏–º –ä–µ–≥—É—à), while his given name can be spelled as Ruvim (–†—É–≤–∏–º), and his byname as Njego≈°, as well. He is sometimes numbered Rufim II (–†—É—Ñ–∏–º II), to disambiguate from previous Rufim I (1561‚Äì1568), who was also from Njegu≈°i (sometimes named Rufim Veljekrajski, after a village Velji Kraj in Njegu≈°i tribe) and Rufim Boljeviƒá (Rufim III), the later metropolitan.

He is currently the secretary of a charity which helps disabled and deprived children in Kenya and a lifelong Salvationist. Playing career Although he was born in the Sholing area of Southampton, Maughan was brought up on the Isle of Wight where he attended Cowes Secondary Modern School. After leaving school he became a trainee accountant and played football for Cowes, breaking into their first-team when he was 16. In a match between the Isle of Wight Youth team and Southampton Youths, he scored four goals in a 6‚Äì1 victory and was promptly signed by Southampton's manager Ted Bates. In 1957, he was part of the Southampton Youth team which made their first entry into the FA Youth Cup, scoring 11 goals as the team reached the semi-final, where they were eliminated by Manchester United on aggregate, despite a victory at Old Trafford in which Maugham scored twice. Maughan signed a professional contract in May 1957 and scored 47 goals in 101 appearances for Southampton's reserves. He made his first-team debut on 21 February 1959,when he took the place of the injured Charlie Livesey as centre-forward for a 4‚Äì1 defeat at Reading. In February 1960, he managed three consecutive matches in place of the suspended George O'Brien, but in five years at The Dell he only made eight appearances, scoring once (in a 2‚Äì1 defeat at Sheffield United on 15 April 1961). Despite being described in his early days as \\"a real 90-minute player\\" with \\"pace and ability\\", he only made seven first-team appearances in six years with the Saints. In March 1962, he was sold to Reading for a fee of ¬£4,000. Reading quickly discovered that Maughan had problems with his eyesight and demanded, unsuccessfully, a refund of part of the transfer fee. He stayed at Elm Park for a season, in which he only managed 16 League appearances, scoring three goals. After leaving Reading in the summer of 1963, Maughan dropped into non- league football initially in East Anglia, followed by four years at Bexley United, before returning to Hampshire in 1972, where he played for Basingstoke Town. Later career In 1974, he briefly returned to Bexley United as a coach for the reserve team. In 2000, he was living near Sunbury-on-Thames, working part-time as an IT consultant. In 2013, he was living near Heathrow Airport. A lifelong member of The Salvation Army, Maughan was still playing the trombone for the Army's band at Staines. Between 2008 and 2012 he coached their football team, SA Stainash, in the East Berkshire Football League. He continues to be a season ticket holder at St Mary's Stadium, although his involvement as secretary of The Kenya Trust can cause him to miss some of Southampton's home matches. He is secretary of the Kenya Trust, a Salvation Army charity which was established in 2004 to help disabled and deprived children in Kenya. He also leads the Salvation Army's Men's Fellowship at Staines, and organises the annual \\"Into Africa\\" fund-raising concert, which in September 2014 raised over ¬£4,500 to invest in infrastructure and building projects in Kenya.

History He was born either in 1981, 5 March 1982, or 3 May 1982, in Tunis, Tunisia. According to the US government, he was one of first militants to join the Islamic State, traveling to Iraq as a foreign fighter after the US invasion of the country. In October 2007, IS personnel records were captured by coalition forces in a raid near Sinjar. These records contain a mention of Abu Umar al-Tunisi. A note mentions that he was a soldier, had received medical treatment for an unspecified injury and was returning to his station in Abu Ghraib, Iraq. Syria =2013= Since 2013, he was recruiting and facilitating the travel of fighters for IS. He was named IS's emir for the Syria‚ÄìTurkey border and he received new foreign fighter recruits and provided them light weapons training before sending them to Syria. He arranged the movement of Europeans to Turkey and on to Syria. He and other IS border officials assisted foreign fighters from the United Kingdom, Albania and Denmark. In the middle of 2013, he worked with Abu Muhammad al-Adnani to move an individual to a training camp in Deir ez-Zor, Syria. Also around this time, he was a leader of foreign operations for IS and had ordered individuals to plan a large operation targeting a United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon commander. He also worked to help raise funds from Gulf-based donors for IS. In September 2013, he arranged for IS to receive approximately $2 million from a Qatar-based IS financier, who required that the funds were used for military operations only. The Qatar financier also requested Abu Umar's help with funding efforts in Qatar. In late 2013, he was IS's amir of suicide bombers and a central part of the network that controlled suicide and vehicle-borne improvised explosive device (VBIED) attacks in Iraq. As part of this role, he moved IS members from Syria into Iraq. In October 2013, he requested suicide bombers for operations in Iraq from a Syria-based associate. He also worked with his brother to procure and ship weapons from Libya to Syria for IS. =2014= In early 2014, he was involved in recruiting North Africans to IS. US and UN sanctions On September 24 2014, he was designated by the US Treasury Department as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist with a long list of alternate names and several alternative birthdates. His Tunisian passport number was Z-050399. On May 5, 2015 The U.S. Department of State's Rewards for Justice Program offered an reward of US$3 million for information leading to his capture. Death Tariq al-Harzi was killed in a US drone strike at Shaddadi in north-eastern Syria on 16 June 2015. His brother Ali Awni al-Harzi was killed the previous day in a US airstrike on Mosul, Iraq. An article in the Islamic State's newspaper al-Naba confirms that Tariq al-Harzi was responsible for suicide attacks, referring to him as \\"the good brother and inciter of the istishhadiyin (martyrdom seekers)\\" and gives his nom de guerre as Abu ‚ÄòUmar at-Tunisi. It also confirms his death by saying 'Rahimahullah' after his name. Family His younger brother Ali Awni al-Harzi was also an Islamic militant and member of the Islamic State.
