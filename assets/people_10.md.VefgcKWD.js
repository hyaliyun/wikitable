Since employees often spend a considerable amount of time developing contacts and confidential and copyrighted information for the company they work for, they may feel they have some right to the information and are inclined to copy and/or delete part of it when they leave the company, or misuse it while they are still in employment. They can be sold and bought and then used by criminals and criminal organizations. Alternatively, an employee may choose to deliberately abuse trusted access to information for the purpose of exposing misconduct by the employer; From the perspective of the society such an act of whistleblowing can be seen as positive and is in certain situations protected by law in some jurisdictions, such as the USA. A common scenario is where a sales person makes a copy of the contact database for use in their next job. Typically, this is a clear violation of their terms of employment. Notable acts of data theft include those by leaker Chelsea Manning and self-proclaimed whistleblowers Edward Snowden and Hervé Falciani. Data theft methods The phrase data theft is actually a misnomer, since unlike theft the typical data theft methods typically do not deprive the owner of their data, but rather create an additional, unauthorized copy. =Thumbsucking= Thumbsucking, similar to podslurping, is the intentional or undeliberate use of a portable USB mass storage device, such as a USB flash drive (or \\"thumbdrive\\"), to illicitly download confidential data from a network endpoint. A USB flash drive was allegedly used to remove without authorization highly classified documents about the design of U.S. nuclear weapons from a vault at Los Alamos.Zagorin, Adam \\"A breach in nuclear security.\\" Time, April 19, 2007. Retrieved April 21, 2007 The threat of thumbsucking has been amplified for a number of reasons, including the following: *The storage capacity of portable USB storage devices has increased. *The cost of high-capacity portable USB storage devices has decreased. *Networks have grown more dispersed, the number of remote network access points has increased and methods of network connection have expanded, increasing the number of vectors for network infiltration. Investigating data theft Techniques to investigate data theft include stochastic forensics, digital artifact analysis (especially of USB drive artifacts), and other computer forensics techniques.  Terminology  In some countries this term is incorrect because it is considered that theft is of a thing (material object) and information is not a thing.Código civil Argentino art. 2311Código penal Argentino art. 164 See also *Pod slurping *Bluesnarfing *Sneakernet *Data breach References External links  *USBs' Giant Sucking Sound *Readers Weigh In: Is the IPod a Threat or a Scapegoat?

In its prime, from the 1850s to the turn of the century, it was visited by three U.S. presidents (U.S. Grant, Chester A. Arthur, and Theodore Roosevelt) and the power elite of the day. HistoryConstruction= The Mountain House's site, the \\"Pine Orchard,\\" had long been famous for its panoramic views up and down the Hudson Valley and even beyond to the east. John Bartram and James Fenimore Cooper had both written about it, in different contexts. Artists and writers had discovered the Catskills some time earlier. Shortly after it was constructed, the Mountain House and its surroundings became a favorite subject for Washington Irving and artists of the new Hudson River School, most notably Thomas Cole. Cooper advised his European audience, \\"If you want to see the sights of America, go to see Niagara Falls, Lake George and the Catskill Mountain House.\\" The hotel was built in 1823 and opened a year later by a group of merchants from nearby Catskill on a plateau with sweeping views of the Hudson Valley on one side and two lakes on the other side that provided water and recreation. In 1839, Charles L. Beach, whose father ran a stagecoach line from the town of Catskill to the Mountain House, leased the hotel from the owners for six years and then bought it outright. Beach rebuilt the Mountain House, changing the original Federal design into a neo-classical structure. =The Fried Chicken War= Postcard view of the hotel, undated One summer day in 1880, a prominent Philadelphia businessman and longtime Mountain House guest named George Harding asked a waiter to bring some fried chicken to his daughter Emily instead of the hotel's usual dinner fare of roast beef, as she had been prescribed a diet which excluded red meat. The ensuing argument went all the way to Beach, who refused to budge despite Harding's history with the hotel. In exasperation, Beach suggested that Harding should perhaps build his own hotel. Harding called the bluff, checking his family out that very day and beginning plans for his own hotel, to be located atop neighboring South Mountain and utterly dwarf Beach's. He kept his word, opening the Kaaterskill Hotel next year and offering the Mountain House its first real competition. The rivalry between the two hotels and their proprietors came to be known in the region as the \\"Fried Chicken War.\\" It actually benefited both, since guests at one would often stroll to the other for lunch. The view that made the Mountain House famous came at a cost-- getting up the 1,600-foot (487.6 m) climb from the valley required a five-hour stagecoach ride. As more competing hotels that were easier to reach began to be developed, the Mountain House built the cable-operated Otis Elevating Railway to bring its guests directly from the Hudson to the hotel . But the railway proved to be expensive to operate, and was finally sold for scrap in 1918 during World War I. =Decline= Undated postcard (c. 1915-1920) Beach's promotional claim that the Mountain House sat amid the highest peaks in the Catskills suffered a major blow in the 1880s, when Princeton University geologist Arnold Henry Guyot undertook the first-ever comprehensive survey of the Catskills and found that the highest peak in the region was not Kaaterskill High Peak, which dominates the view south from higher mountains in the area, but Slide Mountain, many miles to the southwest in the Ulster County town of Shandaken. Beach, who had long claimed that the Pine Orchard was at 3,000 feet (914.4 m) above sea level, 750 feet (228.6 m) higher than its actual elevation (a fib perpetuated even today by the state historical marker at the site), joined forces with his rivals to cast doubt on Guyot's claim, and even questioned his scientific credentials. But by 1886, other surveyors had confirmed Guyot's results, and the North-South Lake area was no longer the heart of the Catskills. =Fall= The decaying Mountain House in 1953, during an unsuccessful attempt to renovate the hotel - Image courtesy of http://www.catskillarchive.com Beach and Harding both died in 1902. Just as the fame of the Mountain House was to be eclipsed by other area hotels, so were the Catskills eclipsed by the Adirondacks as the fashionable playground of the wealthy. The Mountain House continued to operate until the start of World War II -- 1941 was its last season. In 1962, the State of New York acquired the property. Preservationists pointed to the hotel's historic value, but were ultimately unsuccessful when it was burned by the state Conservation Department on January 25, 1963 in accordance with revisionist Forest Preserve management policies forbidding most structures on land retroactively decreed by government to be \\"forever wild.\\" =Today= View from the site of the Mountain House, 2004 The state now operates a large public campground, North- South Lake, near the site of the hotel. The Mountain House site is an easy walk from it along the popular Escarpment Trail. All that remains of what was once America's most fashionable resort are the gateposts and the sweeping views from the cleared site.

They are also used as a material to increase the scanning range of barcodes in factory settings. The sheeting consists of retroreflective glass beads, microprisms, or encapsulated lenses sealed onto a fabric or plastic substrate. Many different colors and degrees of reflection intensity are provided by numerous manufacturers for various applications. As with any retroreflector, sheeting glows brightly when there is a small angle between the observer's eye and the light source directed toward the sheeting, but appears nonreflective when viewed from other directions.  Applications  Retroreflective sheeting is widely used in a variety of applications today, after early widespread use in road signage beginning in the 1960s. = High-visibility clothing = High- visibility clothing frequently combines retroreflective sheeting with fluorescent fabrics in order to significantly increase the wearer's visibility from a distance, which in turn reduces the risk of traffic-related accidents. Such clothing is commonly worn as (often mandatory) PPE by professionals who work near road traffic or heavy machinery, often at night or in low-visibility weather conditions, such as construction workers, road workers, and emergency service personnel. It is also commonly worn by cyclists or joggers to increase their nighttime visibility to road traffic. = For road signs = Retroreflective sheeting for road signs is categorized by construction and performance specified by technical standards such as ASTM D4956-11a.; various types give differing levels of retroreflection, effective view angles, and lifespan. Sheeting has replaced button copy as the predominant type of retroreflector used in roadway signs. There are several grades of retroreflective sheeting which include the three major grades—engineer grade, high intensity prismatic (HIP), and diamond grade. Within these categories there are further delineations based on material used and visibility distance. Diamond grade typically has the greatest distance for visibility of the three major categories. = For barcode labels = Barcodes can be printed onto retroreflective sheeting to enable scanning up to 50 feet away.Retroreflective Labels = In motion pictures = The special effects technique of Front Projection uses Scotchlite reflective screens to create false backgrounds for scenes shot in studios. Front projection was used in 2001: A Space Odyssey during the \\"Dawn of Man\\" sequence. Other films that have used front projection techniques include Silent Running, Where Eagles Dare, and Superman. Star Wars episodes IV, V, and VI, used retroreflective sheeting for the lightsaber blades. = Autonomous vehicle navigation = Reflective tape is used to provide an explicit way to do optical navigation of autonomous vehicles. For example, strips of retroreflective tape are used to provide navigation inputs to the prototype Hyperloop pod vehicles on the SpaceX Hypertube test track.

Geography The community shares a valley with the upper reaches of the West River (of Pictou), with the surrounding mountains being the eastern extension of the Cobequid Hills. The community is directly east of Mount Thom and is named after saline springs which bubble up from the foot of the mountain. History Pictou County and much of northeastern Nova Scotia came to be settled by Scottish immigrants fleeing the Highland Clearances during the late 18th century and into the early 19th century. Numerous small family farms were established after clearing the abundant first-growth Acadian Forest. The Salt Springs area was settled by the 1780s and a property referred to as the \\"Salt Springs Lot\\" was settled by the early 19th century. Attempts were made in 1813 and 1823 to recover some of the salt from the springs. The community became home to a Presbyterian church in 1822 (St. Luke's) and a seceding group which formed under the Free Church of Scotland in 1845-1846 (Ebenezer). The St. Luke's and Ebenezer congregations reunited in 1908 (under St. Luke's) and the entire congregation merged into the United Church of Canada in 1929. Industrialization came in 1825 when a clothing or fulling mill was established in 1825 at the confluence of Six and Eight Mile Brooks. A carding machine was subsequently established at Salt Springs by 1832. A woolen mill was established over the location of the fulling mill by 1879. Salt Springs was on the stage coach route from Pictou to Halifax and a hotel named Twelve Mile House was built in 1838. This was renamed Prince of Wales Hotel after the Prince of Wales (HRH Prince Albert) stayed on a brief visit through the area in 1860 and it closed around 1900. A post office was established in 1864 and Salt Springs became home to a school in 1909 when a replacement to the Six Mile Brook school, which had been lost to fire, was built in the community. The population of the community in 1956 was 75. In the early 1960s, the Trans- Canada Highway (Highway 104) was built through the community, causing outmigration. Today's population is roughly 50 inhabitants, most of whom commute to work in nearby centres of New Glasgow and industrial Pictou County, or west to Truro. Trivia On September 20, 2005, former Salt Springs resident J.D. Fortune, was named lead singer of internationally acclaimed rock and roll band INXS after winning the CBS reality television show Rock Star: INXS. The maternal family of Fortune, who goes by his mother's maiden name, hails from the Salt Springs area and he returned with his mother at a young age from his birthplace in Mississauga, Ontario to be raised in this Pictou County community.

While CAMMAC's focus has been amateur music making, a number of alumni have gone on to professional careers in music, in some cases coming back as teachers. From 1978 to 2009, CAMMAC also operated a second music centre in the Toronto area (various locations), called the CAMMAC Ontario Music Centre. This centre was renamed Lake Field Music in 2010, moved to the Lakefield College School in the Kawartha Lakes area of Ontario), and operates as an independent entity. At various times, in addition to the regions mentioned above, CAMMAC chapters were active in Quebec City and Nova Scotia.

The highway runs from Route 2A in Lunenburg in northeastern Worcester County east to Route 2 in Lexington. Route 225 serves the western Middlesex County towns of Shirley, Groton, Westford, and Carlisle. The highway also passes through Bedford along its concurrency with Route 4, which terminates at the same junction with Route 2. Route description Eastbound Route 225 entering Groton Route 225 begins at an intersection with Route 2A (Massachusetts Avenue) on the east side of the town of Lunenburg in Worcester County. The two-lane highway's name changes from Old Massachusetts Avenue to Groton Road when it enters the town of Shirley in Middlesex County. Route 225's name is West Main Street between its two crossings of the Nashua River--at the Shirley-Groton town line and closer to the center of Groton--and continues from the latter crossing as Long Hill Road. The highway turns north onto Farmers Row to run concurrently with Route 111, then the two routes follow Pleasant Street, which crosses the Nashua River Rail Trail, until Route 111 diverges onto Elm Street. Route 225 continues on Pleasant Street until it joins Route 119 on Main Street. Near the south end of downtown, the routes meet the west end of Route 40 (Lowell Road). Route 225 and Route 119 continue southeast along Boston Road to their split in the southeast corner of Groton, where Route 119 continues along Boston Road while Route 225 turns east onto Forge Village Road. The highway enters the town of Westford along Prescott Street and has a grade crossing of a railroad, where the highway continues on Pleasant Street. Southeast of the town center, Route 225 continues along Concord Road. The highway crosses over Interstate 495 (I-495) with no access shortly before its western junction with Route 110 (Littleton Road). The two routes briefly run concurrently on four-lane Littleton Road before Route 225 diverges onto Concord Road, which becomes Carlisle Road midway between Route 110 and Route 27 (Acton Road). East of Route 27, Route 225 enters Carlisle, where the highway follows Westford Street and then Bedford Road east of the town center. Route 225 crosses the Concord River and enters the town of Bedford on Carlisle Road. At the west end of the town center, the highway joins Route 4 on North Road before the two highways join Route 62 (Concord Road) on The Great Road. Route 62 splits north onto Brookside Road and the remaining two routes cross the Shawsheen River and continue to Lexington, which they enter on Bedford Street. Route 225 and Route 4 temporarily expand to a four-lane divided highway through their cloverleaf interchange with I-95 and Route 128 (Yankee Division Highway). In the center of Lexington, the highways turn onto Massachusetts Avenue, which they follow southeast parallel to the Minuteman Bikeway through a brief concurrency with Route 2A between Marrett Road and Maple Street. Near the southeast end of Lexington, Route 225 and Route 4 turn from Massachusetts Avenue, which continues toward Arlington, onto Pleasant Street and then Watertown Street to their joint terminus at a four-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange with Route 2 (Concord Turnpike). The roadway continues south as Winter Street toward Belmont. History Route 225 was formerly known as Route 25 before the construction of I-495 south of Raynham in 1957, which was given the Route 25 designation. The stretch of highway between the Bourne Bridge in Bourne and the I-495-I-195 interchange in Wareham still bears the Route 25 designation, while the rest of Route 25 became an extension of I-495 in 1987.

As is noted by The Encyclopedia Britannica, the work became a \\"standard introductory philosophy text for thousands of university students, particularly in its U.S. paperback edition.\\" Since 2003 it has been marketed as an eleven volume work with two previously published other works by Copleston being added to the series.  Overview  The work provides extensive coverage of Western philosophy from the Pre-Socratics through to John Dewey, Bertrand Russell, George Edward Moore, Jean-Paul Sartre and Maurice Merleau-Ponty. Originally conceived as a three volume work covering ancient, medieval and modern philosophy, and written to serve as a textbook for use in Catholic ecclesiastical seminaries, the work grew into nine volumes published between 1946 and 1975 and to become a standard work of reference for philosophers and philosophy students that was noted for its objectivity. A tenth and eleventh volume were added to the series in 2003 (after Copleston's death in 1994) by Continuum (which later became an imprint of Bloomsbury). The tenth volume Russian Philosophy had previously appeared as Philosophy in Russia in 1986. The eleventh volume Logical Postivism and Existentialism had previously appeared as the revised 1972 edition of Contemporary Philosophy (a essay collection first published in 1956). The series has been translated into Italian, French, Spanish, Japanese, Chinese, Romanian, Polish and Persian. Volume summaries The following is a summary of details (not a full table of contents) for the eleven volumes: =Volume 1: Greece and Rome= Originally published in 1946, this volume covers: * Pre- Socratic philosophy * The Socratic period * Plato * Aristotle * Post- Aristotelian philosophy As with others in the series, this volume would be made available by Image Books (Doubleday) in two parts, the first ending with Plato, the second beginning with Aristotle.Copleston, Frederick Charles (1962).

A History of Philosophy: Volume I, Greece & Rome Part II. Internet Archive. Garden City, N.Y.,: Image Books. p. 6. Gerard J. Hughes reports that in later years Copleston thought the first volume \\"deplorable\\" and wished that he had had the time to rewrite it. = Volume 2: Augustine to Scotus = Originally published in 1950, this volume, which has also borne the subtitle Medieval Philosophy, covers: * Pre-mediaeval Influences (including St. Augustine) * The Carolingian Renaissance * The Tenth, Eleventh, and Twelfth Centuries * Islamic and Jewish Philosophy * The Thirteenth Century (including St. Bonaventure, St. Thomas Aquinas and Duns Scotus) Copleston also produced a work on Medieval Philosophy (1952) which, revised and expanded, became A History of Medieval Philosophy (1972). This work covered some of the same subjects as the second and third volumes of his History. Copleston would also write Aquinas (1955) expanding on his treatment of the thinker in volume 2. =Volume 3: Ockham to Suarez= Originally published in 1953, this volume which has also borne the subtitle Late Medieval and Renaissance Philosophy, covers: * The Fourteenth Century (including William of Ockham) * Philosophy of the Renaissance (including Francis Bacon) * Scholasticism of the Renaissance (including Francisco Suárez) Copleston also produced a work on Medieval Philosophy (1952) which, revised and expanded, became A History of Medieval Philosophy (1972). This work covered some of the same subjects as the second and third volumes of his History. =Volume 4: Descartes to Leibniz= Originally published in 1958, this volume, which has also borne the subtitle The Rationalists, covers: * René Descartes * Blaise Pascal * Nicolas Malebranche * Baruch Spinoza * Gottfried Leibniz =Volume 5: Hobbes to Hume= Originally published in 1959, this volume, which has also borne the subtitle British Philosophy, covers: * Thomas Hobbes * John Locke * Isaac Newton * George Berkeley * David Hume =Volume 6: Wolff to Kant= Originally published in 1960, this volume, which has also borne the subtitle The Enlightenment, covers: * The French Enlightenment (including Jean-Jacques Rousseau) * The German Enlightenment * The Rise of the Philosophy of History (including Giambattista Vico and Voltaire) * Christian Wolff * Immanuel Kant =Volume 7: Fichte to Nietzsche= Originally published in 1963, this volume, which has also borne the subtitle 18th and 19th Century German Philosophy, covers: * Johann Gottlieb Fichte * Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling * Friedrich Schleiermacher * Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel * Arthur Schopenhauer * The Transformation of Idealism (including Ludwig Feuerbach and Max Stirner) * Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels * Søren Kierkegaard * Neo-Kantianism * Friedrich Nietzsche Copleston also wrote separate works on two of the philosophers treated in this volume: Friedrich Nietzsche: Philosopher of Culture (1942), a work expanded in 1975, and Arthur Schopenhauer: Philosopher of Pessimism (1946). He was also interviewed by Bryan Magee on Schopenhauer for BBC Television in 1987., The Great Philosophers BBC 1987, (on YouTube) =Volume 8: Bentham to Russell= Originally published in 1966, this volume, which has also borne the subtitle Utilitarianism to Early Analytic Philosophy, covers: * British Empiricism (including John Stuart Mill and Herbert Spencer) * The Idealist Movement in Great Britain (including Francis Herbert Bradley and Bernard Bosanquet) * Idealism in America (including Josiah Royce) * The Pragmatist Movement (including Charles Sanders Peirce, William James, and John Dewey) * The Revolt Against Idealism (including George Edward Moore and Bertrand Russell) =Volume 9: Maine de Biran to Sartre= Originally published in 1975, this volume which has also borne the subtitle 19th and 20th Century French Philosophy covers: * From the French Revolution to Auguste Comte (including Maine de Biran) * From Auguste Comte to Henri Bergson * From Henri Bergson to Jean-Paul Sartre (including Maurice Merleau-Ponty) =Volume 10: Russian Philosophy= Though (according to Gerard J. Hughes) a tenth volume of History on Russian philosophy had once been projected, Copleston's work in this area resulted in two books not part of that series: Philosophy in Russia (1986) and Russian Religious Philosophy (1988). The former book (which the original publishers had claimed could \\"reasonably be regarded as a companion volume to the series”) was added as Volume 10 by Continuum in 2003 (though it also continued to be sold under its original title to libraries as of 2019). * Ivan Kireevsky, Peter Lavrov, and other Russian philosophers * Philosophy in Dostoevsky and Tolstoy * Religion and Philosophy: Vladimir Solovyov * Plekhanov, Bogdanov, Lenin and Marxism * Nikolai Berdyaev and other philosophers in exile =Volume 11: Logical Positivism and Existentialism= Included, from 2003, as Volume 11 in the Continuum edition, Logical Positivism and Existentialism is a collection of essays which (barring a first chapter rewritten for a 1972 republishing) had all been published in Copleston's Contemporary Philosophy (1956). It covers Logical positivism and Existentialism. Reception and legacy Reviewing the first volume in 1947, George Boas remarked that: \\"None of [Copleston's Thomistic] interpretations will do much harm to the reader of this very scholarly book. Most of them are put in parentheses, as if they were inserted to warn the seminarists that they must not be taken in by the pagans. They could be removed, and a history of ancient philosophy ad usum infidelium*for the use of the unbelievers would result which would be head and shoulders above the usual histories. [...] He obviously knows the ancient literature well and, if he had not felt himself obliged to be a modern Eusebius, he had the knowledge to write a genuine history. On the other hand, he is too given to periodizing and generalizing. [...] One can have but the highest praise for Father Copleston's erudition; it is too bad that he could not have put it into writing a really original study of ancient philosophical ideas.\\" Regarding the objectivity of the work, Martin Gardner, echoing remarks he had made previously, noted: \\"The Jesuit priest Frederick Copleston wrote a marvelous multi-volume history of philosophy. I have no inkling of what he believed about any Catholic doctrine.\\" Reviewing 1986's Philosophy in Russia (sold, from 2003, as of the tenth volume of the Continuum edition) Geoffrey A. Hosking noted that the author was \\"as fair to the atheist and socialist thinkers as he is to the religious ones, with whom, as a member of the Society of Jesus, he is presumably more in sympathy.\\" And said that overall it was \\"a magisterially competent survey.\\" But, he concluded: \\"I confess, though, to being slightly disappointed that Copleston's enormous experience did not generate a few more original insights, and in particular did not provoke him into examining the most important of all the practical questions that Russian philosophy poses.\\" Writing in 2017, philosopher Christia Mercer credited the work as \\"a hugely ambitious and admirably clear study\\" but remarked that although the author includes \\"mystics like Master Eckhart (1260-1328) and prominent Jesuit scholastics like Francisco Suárez (1548–1617), he entirely ignores the richly philosophical spiritual writings of even the most prominent late medieval women, reducing the entirety of philosophy to a series of great men, each responding to the ones who went before.\\" Philosopher and theologian Benedict M. Ashley compared A History of Philosophy to some of the most famous histories of philosophy as follows: \\"Some histories of philosophy, like the admirable one of Frederick Copleston, only attempt to give an accurate account of various philosophies in their general historical setting. Others, like Bertrand Russell in his absurd History of Western Philosophy or Etienne Gilson in his brilliant The Unity of Philosophical Experience proffer an argument for a particular philosophical position.\\" The Washington Post: \\"Copleston's account of western philosophy has long been a standard reference, most familiar to students as a series of slender rack-sized paperbacks. Copleston writes with welcome clarity, but without the slight dumbing down of Will Durant's engaging Story of Philosophy or the biases of Bertrand Russell's provocative History of Western Philosophy. In other words, Copleston's volumes are still the place to start for anyone interested in following man's speculations about himself and his world.\\" Gerard J. Hughes in The New Catholic Encyclopedia, described the work as \\"a model of clarity, objectivity, and scholarly accuracy, unsurpassed in its accessibility and balance.\\" The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the Jesuits: \\"[A] monumental nine-volume [history][...] published between 1946 and 1974, for which [Copleston] would receive wide-spread acclaim. Described by The Times of London as “the best all-round history of philosophical thinking from the pre- Socratics to Sartre” (April 2, 1994), Copleston’s history became renowned for the erudition of its scholarship, the comprehensive scope of its content, and the relatively objective position from which it was written.\\" The Review of Metaphysics: \\"(The) best known historian of philosophy in the English speaking world, and a man to whom many are indebted.\\" Jon Cameron (University of Aberdeen): \\"To this day Copleston’s history remains a monumental achievement and stays true to the authors it discusses being very much a work in exposition.\\" As of September 1979, The Washington Post reported that: \\"[Image/Doubleday's] best-selling multi-volume work, Frederick Copleston's \\"[A] History of Philosophy\\" (nine parts, 17 volumes) has collectively sold 1.6 million copies.\\" Editions  See also * Lectures on the History of Philosophy by Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel * A New History of Western Philosophy by Anthony Kenny References External links  *A History of Philosophy (vol. 3) [Copyright status reviewed by University of Florida staff - Out of copyright.] *E-books available for loan with registration at Internet Archive: **Vol 1, Part I, Vol. 1 Part II, Vol. 3, Vol. 4, Vol. 5, Part I, Vol. 6.

The town is about eight kilometers from Hatkanangale, about twenty seven kilometers from Kolhapur and currently, also is the Taluka or Tehsil Headquarters. The famous Jain Tirtha (pilgrim place) known as Bahubali, is just two kilometers away from the Kumbhoj city. As the name itself suggests, Kumbhoj seems to be connected with well-known ancient term Kamboja of Sanskrit/Pali literature. Alternative name of Kumbhoj is Kumboj (=Kamboj). The former name is apparently free from Iranian or Paisaci influence since Maharashtra location was far removed from the north-west division of ancient India. Kamboj is the standard name found in numerous ancient Sanskrit and Pali texts. Padma Vibhushan Dr. Karmaveer Bhaurao Patil, a renowned social worker and philanthropist was born at Kumbhoj. Bahubali at Kumbhoj is identical to the Bahubali of Shravanabelagola known as Gomateshwar to the south in Karnataka. History During the second century BCE, a section of Kambojas from Central India had joined the great tribal movement to Central Asia. One section of those Kambojas appears to have given their name to this coastal town of southwest India. There is said to be a microscopic Jain community, predominantly agrarian, called Kambhoj living near Nanded in Maharashtra. Kumbhoj was very ancient village where Devi Shakambari has visited. There is a temple of Devi Shakambari which has close relation from Banashankari near Badami. This village was mainly ruled by Brahmins whose surname was \\"Kulkarni\\" (now they are migrated from this village and changed their names to \\"Kumbhojkar\\") who were integral part of Chatrapati Shahu Maharaj' team for consulting them and providing suggestions over critical and political issues. There is a reference to sage Kumbhoja (q.v.) who finds reference in southern Indian recensions of Ramayana. He seems to have lived somewhere on the banks of river Godavari, in southwest India during Ramayana times. Seems like sage Kambhoja originally belonged to northwest and had migrated to south of Vindhya on river Godawri. The Shakambari Madir needs cultivation through Archaeological Survey of India. Kumbhoj is nowadays famous for the agriculture land where sugar cane farming is popular.

Besides the village of Dortan itself, the commune includes the hamlets of Uffel, Vouais, Bonaz, Emondeau, Sénissiat and Maissiat. The population was 1,845 in 2014. History This area was settled in the first century AD by the Sequani, a Gallic people. It was on a route used by the Romans and by the seventh century, the Abbaye de Saint-Claude had been established nearby and the area was evangelized. During the feudal period in the ninth century, the counts were Lambert and Geoffroy de Dortenc, and twenty generations of these seignieres followed. The Château de Dortan was built in the fifteenth century as a replacement for the original twelfth century building. It was attacked on many occasions, including by Cardinal Richelieu in 1637. The last of the de Dortenc lineage was Jean-François de Dortenc, who died in 1708. He had committed various misdeeds and his successor sold the château to Pierre Gaulthier, adviser and secretary of Louis XIV. Today the château is in private ownership and is included in the list of Monument historiques. =1944 massacre= In July 1944, during World War II, the Germans looted and burned the village in reprisal for activities by the French Maquis. Seven people were shot on July 12, including the village priest and a woman. The following day, three villagers were killed and women were raped. On 20 and 21 July, 15 men were arrested and tortured at the château, which was occupied by the German troops. The next day, the remaining inhabitants were rounded up and gathered in the château while the houses in the village were burnt down. In total, 35 civilians were killed, the village was razed and only the château was left standing. Geography Dortan is in the extreme north of the department of Ain in central eastern France, in the district of Nantua close to the Swiss border. Bienne is away and the Jura Mountains lie to the east. The commune includes the hamlets of Uffel, Vouais, Bonaz, Emondeau, Sénissiat and Maissiat, and scattered farms. The D436 road connects the village to Saint- Claude.

His mother and grandmother were the Begums of Oudh. Reign Asaf-ud-Daula became nawab at the age of 26, on the death of his father, Shuja-ud-daula, on 28 January 1775. He assumed the throne with the aid of the British East India Company, outmanoeuvring his younger brother Saadat Ali who led a failed mutiny in the army. British Colonel John Parker defeated the mutineers decisively, securing Asaf-ud-Daula's succession. His first chief minister was Mukhtar-ud-Daula who was assassinated in the revolt. The other challenge to Asaf's rule was his mother Umat-ul-Zohra (better known as Bahu Begum), who had amassed considerable control over the treasury and her own jagirs and private armed forces. She, at one point, sought the Company's direct assistance in the appointment of anti-Asaf ministers. When Shuja-ud-Daula died he left two million pounds sterling buried in the vaults of the zenana. The widow and mother of the deceased prince claimed the whole of this treasure under the terms of a will which was never produced. When Warren Hastings pressed the nawab for the payment of debt due to the Company, he obtained from his mother a loan of 26 lakh (2.6 million) rupees, for which he gave her a jagir (land) of four times the value; of subsequently obtained 30 lakh (3 million) more in return for a full acquittal, and the recognition of her jagirs without interference for life by the Company. These jagirs were afterwards confiscated on the ground of the begum's complicity in the rising of Chait Singh, which was attested by documentary evidence. Ultimately this removed Umat-ul-Zohra as an obstacle to Asaf's reign. In the aftermath of Saadat's revolt, Asaf sought to restructure the government particularly by appointing nobles favourable to his cause and British officers to his miliary. Asaf appointed Hasan Riza Khan as his chief minister. Although he had little experience in administration, his assistant Haydar Beg Khan turned out to be a valuable support. Tikayt Ray was appointed finance minister. Asaf was known for his generosity, particularly the offering of food and public employment in times of famine. Notably, the Bara Imambara, a mosque in Lucknow, was constructed during his reign by destitute workers seeking employment. A popular saying of the time of his benevolence: jisko na de maulā, usko de Asaf-ud-daulā \\"to whom even God does not give, Asaf-ud-Daula gives.\\" He was painted several times by Johann Zoffany. Shifting the capital In 1775 he moved the capital of Awadh from Faizabad to Lucknow and built various monuments in and around Lucknow, including the Bara Imambara. Architectural and other contribution File:Asfi masjid.jpgAsfi mosque, named after the Nawab, Asaf-ud-Daula. File:Bara Imambara Lucknow.jpgBara Imambara (Asafi Imambara), an imambara, was built by Asaf-ud-Daula, in 1784 at Lucknow. Nawab Asaf-ud-Dowlah is considered the architect general of Lucknow. With the ambition to outshine the splendour of Mughal architecture, he built a number of monuments and developed the city of Lucknow into an architectural marvel. Several of the buildings survive today, including the famed Asafi Imambara which attracts tourists even today, and the Qaisar Bagh area of downtown Lucknow where thousands live in resurrected buildings. The Asafi Imambara is a famed vaulted structure surrounded by beautiful gardens, which the Nawab started as a charitable project to generate employment during the famine of 1784. In that famine even the nobles were reduced to penury. It is said that Nawab Asaf employed over 20,000 people for the project (including commoners and noblemen), which was neither a masjid nor a mausoleum (contrary to the popular contemporary norms of buildings). The Nawab's sensitivity towards preserving the reputation of the upper class is demonstrated in the story of the construction of Imambara. During daytime, common citizens employed on the project would construct the building. On the night of every fourth day, the noble and upper-class people were employed in secret to demolish the structure built, an effort for which they received payment. Thus their dignity was preserved. The Nawab became so famous for his generosity that it is still a well-known saying in Lucknow that \\"he who does not receive (livelihood) from the Ali-Moula, will receive it from Asaf-ud-Doula\\" (Jisko na de Moula, usko de Asaf-ud-Doula). =Rumi Darwaza (Turkish Gate)= The Rumi Darwaza, which stands sixty feet tall, was modeled (1784) after the Sublime Porte (Bab-iHümayun) in Istanbul, is one of the very important examples of the exchange between the two cultures.

Divonne-les-Bains is a spa town situated on the border with French-speaking Switzerland, between the foot of the Jura mountains and Lake Geneva. It is situated in the Pays de Gex, about eight km from Gex, from which the area takes its name. Divonne is about 20 km from Geneva to the south-west and 10 km from Nyon to the east. Since 2012 Divonne forms part of a wider agglomeration known as Grand Genève. Divonne-les-Bains, the hotels - approximately 1920A short way above the town there are several springs, which were exploited in the 19th century to provide spa facilities for which Divonne became renowned. The golf course was built in the 1930s. Many of its present-day amenities - casino, hippodrome, open air swimming pool and artificial lake (Lac de Divonne) - were built after 1945. The Casino de Divonne was opened in 1954. A cultural centre by the lake (L'Esplanade du lac) was completed in 2005. Divonne used to host a small chamber music festival every summer, centred on its tiny theatre and the Domaine de Divonne. The Chateau of Divonne, now a luxury hotel, suffered a serious fire in January 2017, and is currently being rebuilt. There is a lively market on Sundays and a succession of cultural and sporting events throughout the year. Every year, the town host a folk festival in the beginning of July at the Hippodrome called Les Vaches Folks. The Sunday market in Divonne Origin of the name Divonne A number of etymologies are suggested: 1) Divona, Devona - the name of a Gaulish goddess of a sacred spring providing water for the city that is now Bordeaux, invoked in a 4th- century Latin poem by Ausonius. The Latin quatrain was engraved on a stone tablet above a spring at Divonne in the nineteenth century by persons erroneously supposing that Divonne was referred to. It can still be seen near the Casino. 2) Conflation of the Latin word divis (rich, abundant) and the word Ona or Ana, for a flowing river (as in the river Rhone) 3) Conflation of the Celtic word vonne (a source) and di (abundant)M. Bullet, Mémoires sur la Langue Celtique, Besançon, 1793, quoted by M Beatrix, Histoire du Pays de Gex, Lyon, 1851 4) Fancifully, divine + eau (divine water) History From the second century B.C. the Romans progressively conquered and settled area north of the Alps and west to Lake Geneva. Julius Cesar decisively defeated the local Helvetii in 58 B.C. Roman settlements flourished in Nyon and Geneva. The natural springs of Divonne were appreciated by the Romans, who built an aqueduct of about 11 km from Divonne to Nyon to supply water to their garrison. Many traces of this aqueduct have been found, and continue to be found and excavated, often as new building developments are undertaken (see, for example, this note from the Roman Museum at Nyon). In the Middle Ages Divonne's name emerges, as a parish and in the context of its fortified castle and feudal owners. In the twelfth century the parish of Divonne was part of the diocese of Geneva. By the beginning of the twelfth century the Lords of Divonne, in the fiefdom of the lords of Gex, had constructed a fortified castle, on the site of the present Chateau de Divonne. In 1225 Amadeus II, the Lord of Gex gifted the fiefdom of Divonne to the monastery of Saint-Claude. Sixty years later in 1285, Léonète, the Lady of Gex, and her son Pierre successfully petitioned Amadeus V of Savoy for the return of the castle to them. The Lord of Divonne in 1356 was Amé II de Joinville, whose daughter Aymonette married Jacques de Gingins. Her descendant, Laurent de Gignins, was the last of his line to be Lord of Divonne. He had married Jeanne de Symond, and following his death in 1653, she married Gilbert I de La Forest of Savoy. She bequeathed the Divonne estate to him, and it was retained in the family until the French revolution in 1789. Although the French Revolution deprived the aristocracy of much of their assets, Louis de la Forest was able recover some of his land including forests in the Jura, and in 1827 he was named as a hereditary member of the \\"Chambre des Pairs\\" (Chamber of Peers) under the constitution of the Restoration. During the eighteenth century the old castle was demolished and the present Chateau built. At this time the population of Divonne was just over 1000. Population The town is home to over 8000 people (2011), some 23% of whom are classified as immigrants - i.e. were not born in France, a high figure reflecting Divonne's proximity to, and involvement with, the international community centred on Geneva. Transportation Divonne was the terminus of a railway line linking it to Gex and Bellegarde, and thus eventually to Paris. The line from Bellegarde was inaugurated in 1889, and eventually closed by SNCF in 1980, against the will of the Ain departmental administration. From 1905 Divonne was also linked by rail to Nyon, via Crassier on the border. The line was closed during the Second World War, re-opened in 1949 and finally closed in 1962. Divonne railway station can still be seen in the town centre, although its future is now in some doubt as the Divonne council considers ways to develop the area surrounding and including the station. An SNCF administrative office still functions in the station for the purchase of tickets from any SNCF departure point. Since 2012 a bus service operates connecting Divonne to the Swiss rail network at Coppet, offering a fast link to Geneva. A regular bus service runs between Divonne and Bellegarde. Economy It is safe to assume that the historical economy of the settlement of Divonne and its surroundings in the Pays de Gex was one of agriculture and forestery. The Divonne river provided power for water mills, and it is said that the present-day thermal spa is built on the site of a diamond-cutting works, powered by a water wheel on the Divonne river. It was in the nineteenth century that Divonne's potential as a Spa was recognised. At the present time, Divonne derives much of its prosperity from tourism and the Casino. It also acts as a dormitory town for many who work across the border in the nearby conurbations of Geneva and Lausanne. A weekly market takes place in the town on Sundays. Recreation The town is well provided with recreational facilities including a 50m open- air swimming pool, football pitches, tennis club, golf course, and a 3.3 km path around the lake for walkers and cyclists, with exercise points. Along a path between the lake and Hippodrome there is a scale representation of the sun and planets of the solar system. Each planet is shown with its astrological symbol and a brief summary of its composition, mass, density distance from the sun, and size relative to the sun.

Christopher Walken reprises his role as the Archangel Gabriel. It was directed by Greg Spence and written by Spence and Matthew Greenberg. Plot Lucifer (Guri Weinberg) ejects Gabriel from Hell, claiming the War of Heaven isn't his to fight and Hell isn't big enough for both of them. Gabriel's new mission is to prevent the birth of a child, a nephilim, the offspring of an angel and a human. The coming of this child, said to precede reconciliation between the warring factions in heaven, has been prophesied by Thomas Daggett, now a monk. The child's conception takes place when Valerie, a nurse, is seduced by an attractive stranger (the angel Danyael) whom she hit with her car. She finds a few days later that she is pregnant. Gabriel attempts to find the whereabouts of the child from Daggett, but kills him when he refuses to help. When Danyael kills members of Gabriel's army of angels, Gabriel instead employs the assistance of a teenage girl (Izzy) who has just committed suicide with her boyfriend. Gabriel keeps her alive to help him in his search for Valerie (despite his powers as an angel, he is completely naive about technology, and is unable to drive a car or work a computer and has her use her computer skills to find her and drive him around). Gabriel's war against Danyael and the other angels climaxes in a battle in Eden, now an industrial wasteland. Danyael and Izzy are killed, but Valerie defeats Gabriel by seizing him and jumping from a building, confident that God will protect her as He told her He would (she reveals that Gabriel is unable to hear His voice as he simply does not listen); she is indeed unharmed, but Gabriel is impaled on a spike. As punishment, Gabriel is turned into a human by Michael. Valerie raises the child by herself, accepting the risk that the angels may come for her. The film ends with Gabriel as a derelict; a face in the sky and ominous clouds show that the war in Heaven is not over.

It runs south to north, serving many of Boston's western and northwestern suburbs, from an interchange with Route 2 in Lexington northwest to an intersection with Route 3A in North Chelmsford. Much of it, north of Lexington, runs parallel to U.S. Route 3 (the Northwest Expressway). The entire route is contained within Middlesex County. Route descriptionConcurrency with Route 225= Route 4 begins at Route 2's Exit 56 interchange in Lexington, just west of the border with Arlington. This interchange also serves as Route 225's eastern terminus, and the two routes begin overlapped with one another. Routes 4 and 225 proceed northward on Watertown Street, turning onto Massachusetts Avenue and meeting Route 2A in East Lexington, briefly sharing pavement with it. The two routes continue through the center of Lexington, where Mass Ave splits to the west, and Routes 4 and 225 continue northwest on Bedford Street. The concurrency passes near North Lexington and interchanges with Interstate 95 (Route 128) at Exit 31, before continuing northwest into the town of Bedford. Routes 4 and 225 pass into the center of town, meeting Route 62 and running concurrent through the town center. After passing through town, Route 62 splits to the west, while Routes 4 and 225 turn northward, splitting themselves soon thereafter; Route 225 to the northwest and Route 4 to the north. =Northern segment= Route 4 proceeds northward out of Bedford by itself, where it begins to parallel US-3 as it passes into Billerica. Route 4 does not intersect any other numbered highways in the town, but does intersect two local roads - Concord Road and Treble Cove Road - which provide nearby access to US-3, which lies to the east. Route 4 continues north into Chelmsford, where it meanders towards the center of town. Near the center, Route 4 intersects the northern end of Route 27 at a rotary-type intersection, and then crosses Route 110, very briefly sharing pavement. Continuing to the north, Route 4 has a half-interchange with Interstate 495 at Exit 33. This interchange provides southbound-only access to I-495 and is a northbound-only exit from the freeway. Access to I-495 northbound is available via Route 110 East, at the nearby Exit 34 interchange. Route 4 continues to the northwest, where it comes to a rotary interchange with US-3 at Exit 32, crossing over the freeway, and continuing another half-mile to the northwest where it ends at an intersection with Route 3A in North Chelmsford. Recently, there have been various maps showing Route 4 being cosigned with Route 3A, extending to the nearby town of Tyngsborough (terminating at Route 113), but Route 4 has ended at Route 3A in North Chelmsford for years. There may be a possibility of this being a new modification to both routes, but there also may be a possibility of the various maps that show the concurrency having inaccurate information as well. Therefore, the true end of Route 4 (as of late) is somewhat controversial.

Interpretation Although the non-arboreal primary meanings of this letter name are well established, one of the arboreal glosses for this name in the Auraicept na n-Éces is cairtheand \\"mountain-ash\\", i.e. \\"rowan\\" (Modern Irish caorthann). The associated verse is : lí súla \\"lustre of eye\\" (from the Bríatharogam Morann mic Moín). The Auraincept interprets this as \\"delightful to the eye is luis, i.e. rowan, owing to the beauty of its berries\\". However, the other two primary Bríatharogaim do not easily fit this arboreal association. While this kenning may be based on the association with luise (\\"flame\\") due to the bright berries, the other kennings are likely based on the association with lus (\\"herb, plant\\"), hence food for cattle. In line with these kennings, the elm tree (Old Irish lem) is another arboreal gloss for luis from the Auraicept: \\"Cara ceathra, friend of cattle, to wit, elm. Cara, to wit, dear to the cattle is the elm for its bloom and for down\\".Auraicept na n-Éces Calder, George, Edinburgh, John Grant (1917), reprint Four Courts Press (1995), pp. 284, Bríatharogaim In the medieval kennings, called Bríatharogaim (sing. Bríatharogam) or Word Oghams the verses associated with Luis are: lí súla - \\"lustre of the eye\\" in the Bríatharogam Morann mic Moín carae cethrae - \\"friend of cattle\\" in the Bríatharogam Mac ind Óc lúth cethrae - \\"sustenance of cattle\\" in the Bríatharogam Con Culainn.Auraicept na n-Éces Calder, George, Edinburgh, John Grant (1917), reprint Four Courts Press (1995),  Notes  While medieval and modern neopagan arboreal glosses (i.e. tree names) for the Ogham have been widely popularised (even for fade whose names do not translate as trees), the Old Irish In Lebor Ogaim (the Ogam Tract) also lists many other word values classified by type (e.g. birds, occupations, companies) for each fid. The filí (Old Irish filid, sing. fili) or poets of this period learned around one hundred and fifty variants of Ogham during their training, including these word-list forms. Some of the notable Old Irish values of these for Luis include: Enogam/Bird-ogam: lachu \\"duck\\" Dathogam/Colour-ogam: liath \\"grey\\" Ogam tirda/Agricultural ogam: loman \\"rope\\" Danogam/Art-ogam: luamnacht \\"pilotage\\" Ogam Cuidechtach/Company Ogam: Laichesa \\"Heroines\\" References Category:Ogham letters ","title":"Luis (letter)"},{"id":"2761318","text":"Robert L. \\"Bob\\" Papa (born September 19, 1964) is an American sportscaster.

It is located on the campus of Eastern Kentucky University, in Richmond, Kentucky, United States. Model Laboratory School is currently home to around 720 students in grades K through 12. Enrollment is open to the public, and families of prospective students may submit an application to attend. Model High School was identified as a U.S. News 2019 Best High School which also features a 98% graduation rate. History Model is the first laboratory school established in Kentucky. It opened its doors on September 11, 1906 (four months prior to the opening of Eastern Kentucky State Normal School). It was initially organized as a private school to provide its students with facilities and opportunities of a superior level, as a demonstration school to acquaint college students with the methods of teaching, and as a training school to give prospective teachers practical experience in teaching. The school was located on the property of Walters Collegiate Institute and was housed in the Central University Building. Col. E. H. Crawford was appointed the first director of the school, but due to his late arrival, J. A. Sharon was made acting principal and actually served as its first administrator. Colonel Crawford served one terms as director, followed by Professor Ira Waite Jayne (1907–09) and E. George Payne (1909–1910). Dr. John Grant Crabbe, then President of the college, assumed the duties of the directorship and held that position until he retired in 1918. R. A. Edwards served as director of the Training School from 1918 to 1954 and as principal of the high school until he was succeeded in 1935 by Dr. J. Dorland Coates. Dr. Coates served as principal of Model High School from 1935 until 1954, when he succeeded Edwards as director of the entire laboratory school. Dr. Henry Martin was appointed the director of the Elementary Training Center in 1954. With the completion of a new school plant in 1961, the elementary and high school divisions were combined and Dixon A. Barr was made the director of the new Model Laboratory School. The school's mascot was formerly the Rebels, but was changed to the Patriots by the student council in 1976 (in contradiction to the student vote for the nickname Raiders). Plans for the new Model Laboratory School were initiated in 1959 by President William F. O'Donnell and the Eastern Board of Regents. The new building replaced the Cammack Building and the historic University Building which had housed \\"old Model\\" since 1906. The current building was named for Dr. H. L. Donovan, President of Eastern from 1928 until 1941, and was occupied in September 1961. The school was integrated in the fall of 1967. Athletics Model currently offers a wide variety of athletics including swimming, diving, volleyball, tennis, golf, soccer, baseball, basketball, softball, track, and cross- country. Model also has many clubs and organizations available to its students, including one of the oldest Key Clubs in the country. As early as 1911, Model was participating in basketball, baseball, and track, and was a participant in the first Kentucky High School Basketball Tournament. The school progressed in modes and methods of public education in spite of many hindrances such as changes in enrollment and the dropping and re-establishment of the high school grades. In 1936, Model High School and the city school, Madison High, combined to enrich their programs and to avoid a duplication of efforts. The schools were accredited jointly by the Southern Association of Secondary Schools as Madison-Model High School. The two divisions retained their respective organizations, but combined such activities as commencement, athletics, and music until the schools were separated in 1961. Current Model is the only laboratory school in the state of Kentucky, and still holds an important place in the vibrant EKU community. In the summer of 2019, the school debuted The Center for Educator Excellence, its professional development organization, which hosted the first ever AP Summer Institute with the goal of providing high school teachers the best practices to teach college-level content. Model is also a member of the Laboratory School Association or NALS: The International Association of Laboratory and University Affiliated Schools. Eastern Kentucky University and Model Laboratory School both celebrated their centennial anniversaries in 2006.  Facilities  The facilities of Model Laboratory School still have some asbestos.

For Those Tears I Died and \\"Children of the Day\\" Shortly after professing to become a Christian in 1969 at sixteen years of age, Stevens-Pino wrote \\"For Those Tears I Died (Come to the Water)\\", a song that was to become widely known and sung in Charismatic Christian churches and youth-groups across the United States. Utilizing her songwriting and singing talents with sister Wendy Carter and friends Peter Jacobs and Russ Stevens, the Contemporary Christian Music group known as \\"Children of the Day\\" was formed. An entry in the Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music states: > If Larry Norman is to be called the father of Christian Rock, then Marsha > Stevens certainly deserves to be known as the mother of contemporary > Christian music ... She was the leader of what is considered to be the > world's first contemporary Christian music group, Children of the Day, and > she has continued as a solo artist to produce albums of worship-oriented and > edifying adult contemporary pop. As such, she remains the progenitor of > what, by 2002, would become the single most popular genre in the > contemporary Christian music market. The album \\"Come to the Water\\" was recorded with money borrowed from Calvary Chapel, whose minister Chuck Smith supported Stevens-Pino's career. However, her later memoir accounts that he enforced female subordination, including appointing a male bandmate as leader of the band.

She married Cindy Stevens-Pino in August 2003 and they ran a music ministry training school for LGBT+ Christians at King of Peace MCC in St. Petersburg FL. They currently lead BALM Ministries and attend Pass-a- Grille Community Church. When she came out as a lesbian after her divorce from Stevens, she faced much vitriol from the conservative Christian community.

Reviews. Retrieved 2016-11-01. Recording history In 1978, Rick Danko headed back into the studio with one-time Beach Boy Blondie Chaplin, Little Feat drummer Richie Hayward, one- time Clapton keyboardist Dick Simms and guitarist Johnny Lee Schell to record his follow-up for the label, producing five tracks, one by Danko, three by Chaplin and one a cover of an old Four Tops number. Further sessions with Simms, one-time Wings drummer Denny Seiwell and guitarists Jim Atkinson, Michael DeTemple and Keith Ellison came later in the year, producing three additional tracks, two by Danko (one co-authored by DeTemple) and a cover of the country standard \\"Cryin' Heart Blues\\". Before any of these recordings could be released, however, Danko was dropped from Arista. Still, Danko persevered, and co-headlined concerts with Paul Butterfield in 1979. Four tracks from a concert in Los Angeles are included on the album, two pulled from Rick Danko, one a cover of The Band's \\"Unfaithful Servant\\" (originally from The Band), and the Sun Records classic \\"Mystery Train\\" (also covered by The Band on Moondog Matinee). Also featured on these recordings are Chaplin and Hayward. An alternate cut of \\"New Mexicoe\\", featuring three guitar heavyweights (Eric Clapton, Pete Townshend and Ronnie Wood) dates from the sessions for Danko's eponymous debut. Lacking the subdued nature of the album version, it is one stage of a work-in-progress. Three tracks featuring Tommy Spurlock are also featured, two dating from 1988 studio sessions (\\"Twilight\\" and \\"When I Get My Just Rewards\\") and the third a 1990 live recording (an acoustic version of \\"Mystery Train\\").

Of these storms, 18 were named, 11 became hurricanes and 3 reached major hurricane status. Although the overall number of storms was normal, an exceptionally active period took place from August 19 through September 1\\\\. During this two-week span, six storms developed, five of which were active simultaneously on August 23: Ione, Joyce, Kirsten, Lorraine and Olive. Of the season's 447 bulletins, 139 were issued during this period. SystemsTropical Storm Aletta= A tropical disturbance formed to the south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec on May 24; sea surface temperatures (SST's) in the area were around . The disturbance slowly organized over the next 60 hours, as it was detaching from the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). On May 28, Tropical Storm Aletta formed. It recurved to the northeast and made landfall in western Mexico on May 30. Effects were minimal. =Tropical Storm Blanca= Blanca formed officially on June 5 and dissipated on June 8 due to surface temps being colder than the required 80 °F for tropical activity. Blanca never had a chance to impact land and had it did at its peak intensity, it would have never done much as its peak wind speeds were 60 mph. Blanca also was the 2nd named storm of the season starting the hurricane season off very weakly. The brunt of the season would start 2 months later in late August. =Hurricane Connie= Hurricane Connie was the first major hurricane. It took a bizarre, twisting path but never made landfall. Connie was never expected to make landfall because of where it formed and the path it took. Connie's track was unique with 2 major turns and potentially 1 loop. =Hurricane Dolores= On June 13, a tropical disturbance south of Mexico showed signs of development. The following day, the system rapidly developed into Tropical Storm Dolores. By June 15, an eye-like feature appeared on satellite imagery as Dolores attained hurricane status. With peak winds of 80 mph (130 km/h), the storm made landfall near Acapulco. Once onshore, Dolores rapidly dissipated and was last noted on June 17. Across Southwestern Mexico, Hurricane Dolores produced heavy rains that triggered widespread flooding and mudslides. Numerous roads sustained damage, separating communities from surrounding areas. At least 18 people were killed and 32 others were injured by the storm. Additionally, an estimated 173,000 people were affected across the country. =Tropical Storm Eileen= In late June, a tropical disturbance developed well to the southwest of Mexico. By June 30, sufficient convection had developed over a newly formed area of low pressure to warrant advisories on a tropical depression. Tracking northward, the system gradually attained tropical storm intensity. Due to the lack of direct observations, Eileen's intensity was based solely on satellite estimates; these estimates indicated the cyclone to have attained peak winds of 40 mph (65 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 997 mbar (hPa; 29.44 inHg). By July 2, Eileen entered a region of stable air, causing convection to diminish. The storm degenerated into a non- convective low late on July 3 as it turned northwestward. The remnants of Eileen were last noted on July 4 well to the southwest of the southern tip of Baja California. =Hurricane Francesca= Francesca was a category 1 hurricane. It neared Baja California by the 17th but turned away before striking. =Hurricane Gretchen= Gretchen was a category 2 hurricane that threatened southern Baja California, but it turned away without affecting land. =Tropical Storm Helga= Helga was a storm that did not affect land. =Hurricane Ione= On August 19, a tropical disturbance was identified near the Intertropical Convergence Zone well to the east-southeast of Hawaii. The next morning, the system developed into a tropical depression as it tracked towards the west-northwest. Later on August 20, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Ione. However, cold air from a nearby stratocumulus field became entrained in Ione's circulation, causing it to weaken to a depression 24 hours later. Now moving towards the west-southwest, the system remained weak for nearly two days. On August 23, Ione rapidly intensified as convection deepened and an eye feature appeared on satellite imagery. The storm subsequently attained hurricane status that evening before crossing 140°W and entering the Central Pacific. Intensification slowed on August 24 as Ione attained winds in excess of 100 mph (155 km/h). Over the next day, the system turned northward and attained its peak intensity late on August 25 with winds of 115 mph (185 km/h). Additionally, the storm attained an estimated minimum central pressure of 954 mbar (hPa; 28.17 inHg). Shortly after reaching this intensity, Ione weakened as it began a U-shaped curve, tracking northeast before turning towards the southwest. During the afternoon of August 27, the system was downgraded to a tropical storm. By August 29, Ione further weakened to a tropical depression and acquired a westward track before dissipating south of Hawaii on August 31. =Tropical Storm Olive= On August 21, just one day after Ione formed, another disturbance formed along the ITCZ and developed into a tropical depression the following day. Tracking generally towards the west, the system slowly organized. By August 23, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Olive well to the south of Hawaii. Olive briefly attained winds of 45 mph (75 km/h) before weakening to a tropical depression on August 24\\\\. Convection waned for the next 30 hours and Olive degenerated into a disturbance on August 25\\\\. The remnant vortex of the storm was last noted on August 26 roughly 210 mi (340 km) southeast of Johnston Island. =Hurricane Joyce= Joyce was a weak hurricane that did not affect land. =Hurricane Kirsten= Hurricane Kirsten took an erratic path. After traveling northwest for a while, it reversed direction and backtracked to almost where it started. It then reversed direction again and underwent a Fujiwhara interaction with Hurricane Ione. =Tropical Storm Lorraine= Tropical Storm Lorraine took an erratic, Z-shaped path during its life. It formed on August 23 and dissipated August 28. =Hurricane Maggie= Hurricane Maggie was the strongest storm of the season. It reached Category 4 but never threatened land. =Hurricane Norma= On September 7, a large area of thunderstorms was identified southwest of Mexico. Over the following two days, the system gradually organized as it moved northwest and was declared a tropical depression on September 9\\\\. Upon being classified a depression, the storm acquired a more northerly track and soon attained tropical storm status. The newly christened Tropical Storm Norma maintained a general northward track towards Mexico. On September 10, Norma briefly strengthened into a hurricane, with peak winds estimated at 75 mph (120 km/h) before making landfall west of Acapulco. Within hours of moving onshore, the storm rapidly deteriorated and dissipated later that day. Heavy rains produced by Norma triggered mudslides in and around Acapulco, resulting in three fatalities. =Hurricane Orlene= On September 19, Category 2 Hurricane Fifi made landfall in Placencia, Belize just below its peak intensity, becoming the third deadliest Atlantic hurricane on record. Fifi rapidly weakened over land, but was able to remain a tropical depression before crossing into the east Pacific and interacting with another disturbance on September 21\\\\. The system restrengthened into a tropical storm and was renamed Tropical Storm Orlene on September 22, although it is unclear how exactly Fifi influenced the formation of Orlene. Orlene gradually intensified as it hugged the coast of Western Mexico, becoming a hurricane again on September 23 as it began recurving to the north-northeast. Orlene reached Category 2 intensity as a small eye developed and the storm made landfall at peak intensity in northwestern Mexico. It rapidly weakened over land and became a remnant low just six hours after landfall. The low continued for several more hours before dissipating over the mountains of Northern Mexico. There were no reports of casualties or major damage in Mexico from either Fifi or Orlene, although reports from Acapulco indicated that of rain fell within a six-hour span on September 22. Remnant moisture from the hurricane brought minor rainfall to portions of Arizona as well. =Hurricane Patricia= On October 3, an area of disturbed weather was identified several hundred miles southwest of El Salvador. Over the following day, an area of low pressure developed within the disturbance and was subsequently declared a tropical depression. Tracking west-northwestward, the depression eventually intensified into Tropical Storm Patricia on October 6 in light of a significant in convection. The next day, a ragged eye developed and the storm strengthened into a hurricane. Intensification continued through the evening of October 9, at which time Patricia attained its peak intensity with winds estimated at 90 mph (150 km/h). Within a day of peaking, the hurricane turned southwestward and weakened. Gradual degradation of the storm took place over the next few days with little convection present over the system by October 11\\\\. By then, Patricia had weakened to a tropical depression. On October 15, Patricia was declassified a tropical cyclone as only a low-level circulation devoid of convection remained. The remnants of the storm were last noted on October 17 well to the east-southeast of Hawaii. =Tropical Storm Rosalie= On October 18, pronounced thunderstorm activity developed along the ITCZ. Gradually, a tropical disturbance formed within this region well to the west- southwest of Mexico. During the morning of October 20, convection rapidly increased and the system was classified as Tropical Storm Rosalie. Visible satellite imagery revealed only an \\"oval-shaped\\" area of thunderstorms with no banding features. Tracking generally towards the west-southwest, Rosalie attained its peak intensity with winds estimated around 65 mph (100 km/h) on October 21. Later that day, the system neared an area of more stable air. Gradual weakening ensued over the following days, with Rosalie degrading to tropical depression status on October 23. Void of convection, the remnant swirl of Rosalie was last noted on October 24 well to the southeast of Hawaii. =Other systems= In addition to the eighteen named storms, there were seven tropical depression during the course of the season. *July 9 – 13, 35 mph (55 km/h) *July 18 – 20, 35 mph (55 km/h) *July 21 – 26, 35 mph (55 km/h) *July 31 – August 11, 35 mph (55 km/h) 1001 mbar (hPa; 29.56 inHg) *August 5 – 7, 35 mph (55 km/h) *September 3 – 7, 35 mph (55 km/h) 1001 mbar (hPa; 29.56 inHg) *October 14 – 15, 30 mph (45 km/h) 1004 mbar (hPa; 29.65 inHg) Storm names The following names were used for named storms that formed in the eastern Pacific in 1974. It is the same list as the 1970 season, except for Aletta, which replaced Adele. This is the last time this list was used to name storms, as modern naming began in 1978. Despite this, the names Aletta, Blanca, Dolores, Norma, Orlene, Patricia and Selma were put on modern naming lists. { width=\\"90%\\"  * Aletta * Blanca * Connie * Dolores * Eileen * Francesca * Gretchen  * Helga * Ione * Joyce * Kirsten * Lorraine * Maggie * Norma  * Orlene * Patricia * Rosalie  * } In this season, the Central Pacific named storms from the western Pacific's typhoon list. One name, Olive, was used. Season effects This is a table of all of the storms in the 1974 Pacific hurricane season. It includes their durations, peak intensities, names, landfall(s), damages, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but are still storm-related.

It serves the Tucson metropolitan area with a community college district consisting of six campuses, four education centers, and several adult education learning centers. It provides traditional and online instruction for over 144 programs.accessed 15 May 2007. The college also offers workforce training, non-credit personal interest classes and post-baccalaureate certificates. PCC is one of the largest multi-campus community colleges in the United States, with relative ranking varying between fourth and tenth largest. PCC is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association.  History  Voters in Pima County approved the creation of a junior college district in 1966 and the first classes were held in 1969 at a temporary campus in an airplane hangar at the Tucson airport, Tucson Medical Center, Villa Maria, and Marana. The college was originally named Pima College but the name was changed to Pima Community College in 1972 to better reflect the mission of the college.http://www.pima.edu/aboutpima/historic_profile/ , accessed 3/21/07 In 2008, PCC's Board of Governors began receiving anonymous complaints of sexual harassment by PCC chancellor Roy Flores. The board took no formal action until 2011 and Flores resigned in 2012 citing health problems. The search for his replacement has been troubled. In February 2013, PCC discovered that the search consultant failed to disclose an issue with a finalist for the job; the consultant was fired and the job search extended. One month after the chancellor search was extended, the interim chancellor resigned in the wake of a scathing report issued by PCC's regional accreditor the Higher Learning Commission (HLC). The report documented not only the ignored complaints of sexual harassment but also a hostile work environment and numerous administrative and financial problems. The report also discussed problems with admissions standards that PCC changed in 2011, problems the college has admitted. As a result of these problems Pima been on probation with the HLC; however, on Feb. 26, 2015 this probation was rescinded. Although the probation was retracted, Pima continues to remain \\"On Notice\\" for deficiencies. PCC also received media attention in early 2011 as the former school of 2011 Tucson Shooting perpetrator Jared Lee Loughner. While at PCC, some of his teachers complained to the administration about his disruptions and bizarre behavior, as they thought them a sign of mental illness and feared what he might do. The college decided to suspend Loughner.  Campuses and learning centers  The original campus for Pima College was located at the site which is now the West Campus. Before the campus opened, classes were taught at a variety of locations around Tucson. From 1971 to the present, the college district has expanded to meet the growing educational needs of the Tucson area. The campuses and learning center provides traditional classroom, distance learning, and hands-on learning opportunities. There are six campuses across the Tucson metropolitan area: * Community campus * Desert Vista campus * Downtown campus * East campus * Northwest campus * West campus Additionally, there are four Learning/Education Centers: * Davis Monthan Air Force Base Education Center * Green Valley Community Learning Center * Northeast Education Center (closed in 2011) * Southeast Education Center = Community campus = The Pima Community College Community campus was opened in 1975 to meet non-traditional educational needs, including distance learning, non- degree activity classes, and adult education. In 1997, the campus moved to its current location at Bonita Avenue and Commerce Park Loop, near St. Mary's Road and Interstate 10. Campus is home to the teacher education program. = Desert Vista campus = First established as the South Education Center in 1986, the Desert Vista campus moved to its present location in 1993. The campus is located at Valencia Viejo, a site once occupied by the Hohokam people, between Irvington Road and Valencia Road on Calle Santa Cruz, west of Interstate 19. The campus supports the nearby Aviation Technology Center at Tucson International Airport and supplies workforce training to the business community at the Center for Training and Development. = Downtown campus = Opened in 1974, Downtown Campus is situated between Speedway Blvd. and Drachman Street on Stone Avenue, close to downtown Tucson and east of Interstate 10. It has traditional academic, occupational, technical, and trade programs. In 2018 the historic Tucson Inn was purchased by the district and added to the campus. = East campus = In 1976, the college established the East Learning Center, which became East campus in 1981 with the construction of a new facility located on of land at Irvington Road and Fred Enke Drive, near Davis-Monthan Air Force Base. Its programs include Veterinary Technology and Emergency Medical Technology. The College East Campus Observatory was established in 1989 by Professor David G. Iadevaia. It includes the Pima College - East Campus observatory and teaching planetarium. After many years in temporary, makeshift facilities, the observatory now has a new, permanent home which was designed by Professor Iadevaia. The observatory is an important part of astronomy education, not only for registered students but also for the public. = Northwest campus = In 2003, the Northwest Community Learning Center (established in 1998) became the Northwest campus, the newest PCC campus. The campus is located on Shannon Road, between Ina and Magee roads in north Tucson. The campus is home to the hotel/restaurant management and therapeutic massage programs. = West campus = The oldest Pima Community College campus, West campus is located on of land between Anklam Road and Speedway Blvd., west of Interstate 10. The campus was opened in 1970. Facilities located at West Campus include the Center for Archaeological Field Training, the Center for the Arts, and the offices of the Aztec Press newspaper and Cababi literary magazine. The campus is home to the college's programs in health-related professions. West Campus is home to Sand Script, a student literary magazine. = Learning centers = The learning centers provide administrative functions and teach classes. These centers are: * Davis-Monthan Air Force Base Education Center, meeting the needs of active duty military at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base and members of the general public. * Green Valley Community Learning Center, south of Tucson along Interstate 19, serving the Green Valley community. Adult learning centers for basic education, ESOL instruction, citizenship classes, and GED preparation are located at the following locations: * Eastside Learning Center on south Alvernon Way * El Pueblo Liberty Learning Center on Irvington Road, east of Interstate 19 * El Rio Learning Center on west Speedway Blvd. * Lindsey Center on south Third Ave. =Partnership with The Catholic University of America= In 2019, a partnership with The Catholic University of America was announced whereby students could earn an associate degree from Pima and a bachelor's degree in business management from Catholic University. The program is administered by Catholic's Metropolitan School of Professional Studies and taught by professors at Catholic University's Busch School of Business. Under the program, first year students enter Pima and take a blend of courses from the two institutions, including foundational courses in philosophy and theology. Over the course of the program, two-thirds of courses will be taken remotely and one-third will be taken in dedicated space on the Pima campus. Between 20 and 25 students will initially be admitted to the program, which has a total four year cost of $32,000, far less than the cost of in-state tuition at a four-year Arizona public college. At the time of launch, it was hoped to grow the program to include 100 students per cohort in three years. Financial aid is available through both institutions. Local businesses in Tucson are also fundraising to support the program. Catholic University officials recognized that most Hispanics in the United States are Catholics but historically have not had access to Catholic higher education in their areas. An analysis by Catholic University found that of \\"the 25 U.S. cities with the largest total increases in the Hispanic population, nine have no Catholic college or university in close proximity.\\" Given this, in 2017, Catholic University began exploring partnerships with existing institutions in the Southwest instead of opening up a new campus. Several cities with large populations of Hispanics and Catholics were considered when then-Tucson Mayor Jonathan Rothschild heard of Catholic University's desire to open a satellite campus. He called the University's provost and then connected the provost with the bishop and over 300 local business leaders and other members of the community. The two colleges worked with local business leaders and with Education Design Lab and Extension Engine to develop the curriculum for the program. Local business leaders will also serve as adjunct professors. The program is targeted at first generation Americans and other under-represented socio-economic groups.  Organization and administration  PCC is governed by a five-member Board of Governors, whose members serve six-year elected terms. Board members are elected based on County electoral district. Governance and leadership The Governing Board of the Pima County Community College District has five members elected by the voters from geographical districts within the Pima County. The Chancellor of PCC serves as its chief executive officer with each campus led by a president and each administrative area run by a vice chancellor.  Academics  PCC offers many community- related programs to support the needs of the Tucson metropolitan area. It provides GED and adult literacy classes, art and theater, senior facilities, and summer camps. PCC also has an extensive small-business development center.For example, see: Marilyn Johnson, \\"Community college center aids entrepreneurs,\\" Arizona Business Gazette, Vol.114, Iss. 11; Sec. 1, p. 17 (Mar 17, 1994); \\"PCC Business Center Turing Firms Around,\\" Arizona Daily Star, March 19, 2000. PCC is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools.accessed 31 March 2007. Additionally, many medical programs (such as nursing or veterinary technology) have additional specialized accreditation by the Arizona and United States Departments of Education. PCC's Aviation Technology Program, through Davis- Monthan Air Force Base, is approved by the Federal Aviation Administration. = Degrees and certificates = PCC awards the following degrees: * Associate of Arts (AA) * Associate of Business (AB) * Associate of Science (AS) * Associate of Fine Arts (AFA) * Associate of Applied Arts (AAA) * Associate of General Studies (AGS) It also awards certificates in many disciplines. = AGEC = In 1999, Arizona approved the Arizona General Education Curriculum (AGEC) for students transferring from an Arizona community college to one of the three state universities. A 35-credit block of general education courses, the AGEC transfers to the state universities (and some other baccalaureate degree granting institutions) to meet their lower division general education requirements. PCC awards the AGEC-A, AGEC-B, and AGEC-S certificates.  Student life  Student publications = * Aztec Press, the student-run biweekly newspaper. The newspaper has been named a national finalist by the Society of Professional Journalists for best all-around two-year college newspaper. * SandScript, a literary magazine. This publication has won the Best Overall Publication, Southwest Division, from the Community College Humanities Association, most recently in 2013.accessed 31 March 2007  Aztec Press  The Aztec Press is the student newspaper at Pima Community College. It was created in the 1970s as the Campus News (1973 to 1977), then named the Aztec Campus News (1977–1978) and Aztec News (1978–1981), before changing to the current name. Valerie Vineyard is the current adviser. The \\"Aztec Press\\" also publishes online at www.aztecpressonline.com. Additionally the Aztec Press serves all six campuses of Pima Community College.

The PAS often uses a network to interconnect sensors, controllers, operator terminals and actuators. A PAS is often based on open standards in contrast to a DCS (distributed control system), which is traditionally proprietary. However in recent times the PAS is considered to be more associated with SCADA systems. PAS is the lowest level of automation, while MES (manufacturing execution system) is considered to be directly positioned above a PAS. Process automation involves using sensors, actuators, computer technology and software engineering to help power plants and factories in industries as diverse as paper, mining and cement operate more efficiently and safely.  The background and technology  In the absence of process automation, plant operators have to physically monitor performance values and the quality of outputs to determine the best settings on which to run the production equipment. Maintenance is carried out at set intervals. This generally results in operational inefficiency and unsafe operating conditions. Process automation simplifies this with the help of sensors at thousands of spots around the plant that collect data on temperatures, pressures, flows and so on. The information is stored and analyzed on a computer and the entire plant and each piece of production equipment can be monitored on a large screen in a control room. Plant operating settings are then automatically adjusted to achieve the optimum production. Plant operators can manually override the process automation systems when necessary.  Process automation and energy efficiency  Factory owners want their equipment to deliver the highest output with as little production cost as possible. In many industries including oil, gas and petrochemicals, energy costs can represent 30 to 50 percent of the total production cost. In process automation, the computer program uses measurements to show not only how the plant is working but to simulate different operating modes and find the optimal strategy for the plant. A unique characteristic of this software is its ability to \\"learn\\" and predict trends, helping speed up the response time to changing conditions. The software and controls regulate equipment to run at the optimum speed that requires the least energy. They also ensure the consistency of quality, meaning less energy is wasted producing products that turn out to be defective, and they forecast when maintenance is needed so less time and energy is spent stopping and restarting equipment for routine inspections. Major blocks of PAS are: microprocessors, micro controllers and micro computers, multiprocessors, LANs, SCADA, RTUs (remote terminal units) and analog and digital I/O modules Category:Industrial automation ","title":"Process automation system"},{"id":"2761428","text":"North Sea Hijack (released as ffolkes outside the UK and as Assault Force on US TV) is a 1980 British action film starring Roger Moore, Lea Brodie , James Mason, Anthony Perkins and Michael Parks. It was directed by Andrew V. McLaglen and adapted by Jack Davies from his novel, Esther, Ruth and Jennifer. This film was a vehicle for both Moore and Perkins to try to escape typecasting. Previously, Moore had been practically typecast as a womanising, happy-go-lucky playboy in such series as The Saint, The Persuaders! and James Bond. In contrast to those parts, he portrays a bearded, eccentric, arrogant, cat-loving misogynist with master strategist skills. Plot Eccentric and cat-loving counter-terrorism consultant Rufus Excalibur ffolkes is asked by Lloyd's of London to develop a contingency plan, should any of the North Sea oil installations it insures be threatened. Months later, a North Sea supply ship named Esther takes on board a group of men posing as reporters who are to visit the oil production platform Jennifer. The leader of this group, Lou Kramer, hijacks the ship; the gangsters attach limpet mines to the legs of Jennifer and its accompanying oil drilling rig, Ruth, then issue a ransom demand for £25 million to the British government. Esther's crew tries to fight back, but is thwarted by Kramer's vigilance, and two of their number end up dead. When the British Prime Minister and her staff consult Lloyd's, where both platforms are insured, about providing the ransom, the CEO informs them about ffolkes, and after some initial hesitation he is hired to take out the terrorists and retake the platforms. ffolkes enacts his plan by traveling to Jennifer as the aide of Admiral Brindsen, who was tasked by the Prime Minister to supervise the operation. With Ruth out of Esther's sight, ffolkes first asks the admiralty to prepare a fake explosion in order to distract Kramer from blowing up Ruth and to buy them more time, then arranges for having Brindsen and himself brought aboard the supply ship to take out the terrorist leaders from within while his men board from underwater. However, Kramer distrusts ffolkes and has him removed from Esther. With his original plan thus upset, ffolkes persuades the Prime Minister to have the ransom helicopter drop off a bomb on Esther in case his team fails to take out Kramer's gang in time. Then he approaches the ship from underwater, and despite some mishaps he manages to thwart the activation of the detonators, leaving Kramer for dead, and prevent the bomb drop on Esther. Kramer, mortally wounded, makes one last attempt to blow up Jennifer, but is stopped by ffolkes and expires. Following the successful conclusion of the mission, ffolkes is rewarded for his service with three kittens named after Esther, Ruth and Jennifer. Cast : * ffolkes is an old English name that is correctly spelled with two lower-case f's. In the book, ffolkes corrects other people several times on this matter. See ffolkes baronets. Release The film was a commercial disappointment. It was released as North Sea Hijack in the United Kingdom but in the United States and other English-speaking territories it was re-titled ffolkes. When it was first broadcast on American television in 1983, it was renamed Assault Force. In West Germany it was known as Sprengkommando Atlantik (lit. \\"Demolition Squad Atlantic\\").

Brown was recognized by DPI as a \\"School of Distinction\\" under the state's ABC standards for public education for the 2003–2010 school years. History During the expansion of the Cannon Mills Corporation during the 1920s, James William Cannon donated a piece of land just east of the town for a school. Central High School would be built in 1924, about the same time, a new Concord High School opened. Later in 1930, Central High School was renamed J. W. Cannon High School, in honor of James William Cannon. In 1933, the school burned down, and was rebuilt in 1934. In 1951, the school was renamed A. L. Brown High School, and the school moved to a new building southeast of the old facility. The former building was converted into a junior high school, under the name Cannon Junior High School.Cannon High School students, early 1940s. Independent Tribune. Retrieved July 14, 2020.

Brown High School, as a result of school integration.George Washington Carver High School Faculty, 1953. Independent Tribune. Retrieved July 14, 2020. Over the course of the schools history, many additions have been built on to A. L. Brown, such as a separate vocational building, as well as a free-standing gymnasium. During the 2006—07 school year, a newer gymnasium facility opened on campus. These free-standing buildings give A. L. Brown its unique character. Instead of a traditional single building like most high schools, Brown has a small, college-like atmosphere with numerous buildings around a central courtyard. All buildings on the campus are built in the Colonial Williamsburg style of architecture. They also are brick with white trim, modeled after most of Kannapolis. A. L. Brown High School in February, 2006 On September 25, 2011, the STEM Academy, designed to resemble the nearby North Carolina Research Campus Core Lab, held its grand opening. The top two floors offer modern science labs, while the second floor will house communication classes. The basement has a health center and an international welcome center. In March 2012, the Stroup Arts Center opened. This replaced the previous Vocational Building or V-Building.

The centerpiece of the park is of churning rapids, some up to Class IV. The daring kayakers and canoeists who shoot Blueberry Slide, Mother's Delight, Dragon's Tooth, Little Banning, and Hell's Gate each spring attract spectators to the park. Landbound visitors can hike along the state's first Wild and Scenic River amid dramatic sandstone rock formations, large potholes carved by the river, and the remains of a historic quarry. Other features are Wolf Creek Falls and Robinson Ice Cave. The park is located directly off Interstate 35. Natural historyGeology= stone potholes carved out by the Kettle River The park lies in a shallow, narrow valley worn by the Kettle River. The topsoil is very thin and in the center of the park the river has cut down through Precambrian sandstone known as the Hinckley Formation and on into the bedrock, resulting in a gorge—up to tall at Hell's Gate—and of rapids. The park is also notable for its numerous glacial potholes, smooth shafts scoured into rock. These were formed at the end of the Wisconsin glaciation when the river was swollen by the melting ice, and powerful eddies sent debris swirling around and around, literally drilling shafts into the streambed. The Log Creek Arches in the northern section are potholes whose bottoms have been worn away on one side. Robinson Ice Cave is a deep cave in the bluffs between Wolf Creek Falls and Sandstone. The cave is not open to the public and the entrance is gated to protect the little brown bats, big brown bats, and Keen's myotis bats that hibernate in it. In winter, large stalagmites of ice often form on the cave floor, but in a strict sense it is not an ice cave because the ice does not persist year-round. Below the rapids, the valley once again begins to widen. Away from the river valley, the topography is generally level to gently- rolling glacial till plain. =Flora= The vegetation in this part of the Mille Lacs Uplands is still recovering from 19th century human industry and forest fires. The forest was logged, and around the quarry the ground was stripped bare. Today middle-successional species like birch and aspen are more prevalent than the Norway and eastern white pines that would have originally dominated the area. =Fauna= 184 bird species have been sighted in Banning State Park, including ruffed grouse. Commonly spotted mammals include white- tailed deer, black bear, fox, coyote, raccoon, beaver, and snowshoe hare. 17 species of reptiles and amphibians and 34 species of mammals live in this park. Cultural history The durable, pink-colored sandstone exposed by the river was an ideal construction material, and in 1892 quarrying began after the St. Paul and Duluth Railroad laid a spur to the outcrop. The 1894 Great Hinckley Fire was a major setback, but quarrying bounced back quickly, and two years later a town arose just outside the quarry. It was named Banning after the president of the railroad, whose tracks allowed the stones to be shipped to St. Paul, Duluth, and beyond. The quarrying frenzy was over by 1905, a victim of local and national factors. Within the quarry most of the easily extractable high-quality sandstone was gone, and there was a nationwide architectural move away from stone to structural steel. An asphalt company lingered on until 1912, but when it closed so too did the town of Banning. The railroad company removed its tracks later that decade. In 1959 the Pine County Historical Society interested the state in acquiring the Banning ghost town as a historical site. Given the obvious scenic value of the area, the proposal quickly evolved into a call for a new state park. A bill to this effect was ratified in 1963, although the state didn't acquire enough land to begin developing recreational facilities until 1967. An undeveloped northern section was added in 1986. In 1995 a dam at the southern tip of the park was removed, restoring a waterfall and another series of rapids. Ironically the remains of the town, which prompted the creation of the park, are no longer even visible. Recreation A kayaker on the Kettle River The Kettle River is a destination for whitewater paddling including rafting, canoeing and kayaking. Within the park there are two carry-in access points and two boat ramps. Much of the river is Class I, with portages around the rapids. Fishing is also available along the Kettle River, which has held and produced state-record sturgeon. Banning State Park's drive-in campground has 33 sites (11 with electrical hookups), a camper cabin, and showers. There are four canoe campsites spaced along the river. Banning State Park staff also manage a campground within nearby General C. C. Andrews State Forest that boasts 38 drive-in sites, 2 walk-in sites, and a group tent camp. The park has of hiking trails. A paved bicycling path leads out of the park and connects with the Willard Munger State Trail. In winter of trail are groomed for cross-country skiing and are open for snowmobiling; snowshoeing is allowed anywhere in the park except for the groomed trails.

Note: Origins of Life is not taught. In addition, the Board resolution stated that this subject is to be covered in lecture form with Pandas to be a reference book. p. 117, Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District, Memorandum Opinion, December 20, 2005 The prominence of this textbook during the trial was such that the case is sometimes referred to as the Dover Panda Trial,Argento, Mike (October 20, 2005). \\"Of Behe and mammary glands\\".

The plaintiffs successfully argued that intelligent design is a form of creationism, and that the school board policy violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. The judge's decision sparked considerable response from both supporters and critics. Eleven parents of students in Dover, York County, Pennsylvania, near the city of York, sued the Dover Area School District over the school board requirement that a statement presenting intelligent design as \\"an explanation of the origin of life that differs from Darwin's view\\" was to be read aloud in ninth- grade science classes when evolution was taught.Following the change in curriculum, the school board had a nine-sentence (four-paragraph) statement prepared. In its final form it asserted that Darwin's \\"Theory is not a fact\\" and said that \\"Intelligent Design is an explanation of the origin of life that differs from Darwin's view. The reference book, Of Pandas and People, is available for students who might be interested in gaining an understanding of what Intelligent Design actually involves.\\" pp. 126–128, Kitzmiller v.

The suit was brought in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. Since it sought an equitable remedy, by the Seventh Amendment, right to a jury trial did not apply. It was tried in a bench trial from September 26, 2005, to November 4, 2005, before Judge John E. Jones III, a Republican appointed in 2002 by George W. Bush.  Outcomes  Legal = On December 20, 2005, Jones issued his 139-page findings of fact and decision ruling that the Dover mandate requiring the statement to be read in class was unconstitutional. The ruling concluded that intelligent design is not science, and permanently barred the board from \\"maintaining the ID Policy in any school within the Dover Area School District, from requiring teachers to denigrate or disparage the scientific theory of evolution, and from requiring teachers to refer to a religious, alternative theory known as ID.\\"Wikisource:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District et al., H. Conclusion = Local school board = All eight of the Dover school board members who were up for re-election on November 8, 2005, were defeated by a set of challengers who opposed the teaching of intelligent design in a science class. (The ninth member was not up for re-election.) The new school board president subsequently stated that the board did not intend to appeal the ruling.Powell, Michael (December 21, 2005). \\"Judge Rules Against 'Intelligent Design'\\". The Washington Post. The Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life. Archived from the original on June 21, 2009.  Background  From 2002, William (Bill) Buckingham and Alan Bonsell, members of the Dover Area School District Board of Education who were young earth creationists, had made various statements supporting teaching creationism alongside evolution. At a board meeting on June 7, 2004, Buckingham mentioned creationism and raised objections to the proposed use of the textbook Biology written by Kenneth R. Miller and Joseph S. Levine, describing it as \\"laced with Darwinism\\" and saying it was \\"inexcusable to have a book that says man descended from apes with nothing to counterbalance it.\\" This story made the York newspapers, and Buckingham was telephoned by Discovery Institute staff attorney Seth Cooper, whose tasks included \\"communicating with legislators, school board members, teachers, parents and students\\" to \\"address the topic of ID in a scientifically and educationally responsible way\\" in public schools. He later stated that he made the call to \\"steer the Dover Board away from trying to include intelligent design in the classroom or from trying to insert creationism into its \\", an account Buckingham has disputed. Cooper sent the book and DVD of Icons of Evolution to Buckingham, who required the Dover High School science teachers to watch the DVD. They did not take up the opportunity to use it in their classes. Cooper advised that the Discovery Institute was not offering legal advice, and soon afterwards Buckingham contacted Richard Thompson of the Thomas More Law Center, who agreed to represent the Dover Board, and recommended the book Of Pandas and People. On October 18, 2004, the school board voted 6–3 resolving that there were to be lectures on the subject, with Pandas as a reference book, and that the following statement was to be added to their biology curriculum: \\"Students will be made aware of the gaps/problems in Darwin's theory and of other theories of evolution including, but not limited to, intelligent design. Note: Origins of life is not taught.\\" On November 19, 2004, the Dover Area School District issued a press release stating that, commencing in January 2005, teachers would be required to read the following statement to students in the ninth-grade biology class at Dover High School: The three school board members who voted against it resigned in protest, and science teachers in the district refused to read the statement to their ninth-grade students, citing the Pennsylvania state code 235.10(2), which requires that \\"The professional educator may not ... Knowingly and intentionally misrepresent subject matter or curriculum.\\" Instead, the statement was read to students by a school administrator. The school board's statement asserting that there are \\"gaps\\" in evolution and that it specifically is a theory \\"not a fact\\" singled out evolution, implying it is just a hunch, even though this is not the actual meaning of the term \\"scientific theory\\". The reference to Of Pandas and People and presentation of intelligent design as an alternative \\"explanation of the origins of life\\" presented it as though it were a scientific explanation, in contrast to the way that evolution was described. Encouraging students to \\"keep an open mind\\" about alternatives without offering an alternative scientific explanation implied an invitation to meditate on a religious view, endorsing the religious view in a way similar to the disclaimer found to be unconstitutional in the Freiler v. Tangipahoa Parish Board of Education case. The school board claimed the statement does not teach intelligent design and simply makes students aware of its existence as an alternative to evolution, but no such statements were made about other subjects. As part of the presentation, the administrators stated that \\"there will be no other discussion of the issue and your teachers will not answer questions on the issue\\", giving intelligent design a position not applied to scientific topics.pp. 43–46, Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District, Memorandum Opinion, December 20, 2005 The board denied that intelligent design was \\"religion in disguise,\\" despite being represented in court by the Thomas More Law Center, a conservative Christian not-for-profit law center that uses litigation to promote \\"the religious freedom of Christians and time-honored family values\\". Its stated purpose is \\"... to be the sword and shield for people of faith\\". The American Civil Liberties Union filed suit on December 14, 2004, on behalf of eleven parents from the Dover school district, and sought a law firm willing to take on the case at the risk of not being paid if the case was lost. Eric Rothschild, a partner at Pepper Hamilton LLP and a member of the National Center for Science Education legal advisory council, was quick to agree to take the case on such a contingency basis. The Discovery Institute's John West said the case displayed the ACLU's \\"Orwellian\\" effort to stifle scientific discourse and objected to the issue being decided in court. \\"It's a disturbing prospect that the outcome of this lawsuit could be that the court will try to tell scientists what is legitimate scientific inquiry and what is not,\\" West said. \\"That is a flagrant assault on free speech.\\" Opponents, represented by the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the National Association of Biology Teachers, contended that his statement is not just ironic, but hypocritical, as the Discovery Institute opposes methodological naturalism, the basic principle that limits science to natural phenomena and natural causes without assuming the existence or non-existence of the supernatural, which by definition is beyond natural explanation. Despite its earlier involvement, the Discovery Institute was concerned that this would be a test case and that the defendants had earlier displayed their religious motivations. This tension led to disagreements with the Thomas More Law Center and the withdrawal of three Discovery Institute fellows as defense experts prior to their depositions – William A. Dembski, Stephen C. Meyer and John Angus Campbell. This was purportedly because the Thomas More Law Center refused to allow these witnesses to have their own attorneys present during deposition,\\"Discovery Institute and Thomas More Law Center Squabble in AEI Forum\\". National Center for Science Education. October 23, 2005. but Discovery Institute director Bruce Chapman later said that he had asked them not to testify (as well as Behe and Minnich, who testified anyway).Postman, David (April 26, 2006). \\"Seattle's Discovery Institute scrambling to rebound after intelligent-design ruling\\". The Seattle Times. In May 2005, the publisher of Of Pandas and People, the Foundation for Thought and Ethics (FTE), filed a motion seeking to intervene in the case. FTE argued that a ruling that intelligent design was religious would have severe financial consequences, citing possible losses of approximately half a million dollars. By intervening, FTE would have become a co-defendant with the Dover Area School Board, and able to bring its own lawyers and expert witnesses to the case. FTE's president Jon Buell implied that if allowed to intervene, FTE would bring Dembski and Meyer as expert witnesses. In his decision on the motion, Jones ruled that FTE was not entitled to intervene in the case because its motion to intervene was not timely, describing FTE's reasons for not trying to become involved earlier as \\"both unavailing and disingenuous\\". Jones also held that FTE had failed to demonstrate that it has \\"a significantly protectable interest in the litigation warranting intervention as a party\\" and that its interests would not be adequately represented by the defendants. In the November 2005 elections, none of the members of the Dover School Board who voted for the intelligent design policy were re-elected, and a new school board, which rejected the policy, took office. This effectively precluded the possibility of an appeal to a higher court.

He said that the plaintiffs would be able to provide many examples of school board members wishing to balance the teaching of evolution with creationism. He attacked prior defense claims that it was a minor affair by saying that there is no such thing as a \\"little\\" constitutional violation. He also provided the definition of creationism given by an early draft of Pandas: \\"Creation is the theory that various forms of life began abruptly, with their distinctive features already intact: Fish with fins and scales, birds with feathers and wings, mammals with fur and mammary glands.\\" He compared this with what was eventually published: \\"Intelligent design means that various forms of life began abruptly through an intelligent agency, with their distinctive features already intact: Fish with fins and scales, birds with feathers, beaks and wings, et cetera.\\" (The definitions had come up earlier in a July 14 pre-trial hearing.) He also argued that intelligent design was not science in its infancy, but rather was not science at all.  Defense  Patrick Gillen gave the opening arguments for the defense. He started by saying that the goal of the board and its supporters was to enhance science education. He argued that the policy was a \\"modest change\\". He distanced the policy from alleged statements by then board member William Buckingham that the plaintiffs argued showed clear religious intent: \\"The board listened to the science faculty more than it listened to Bill Buckingham.\\" He argued that the policy did not have a \\"religious agenda\\". Gillen mentioned that board member Alan Bonsell had done his own reading. He said Bonsell was \\"aware of intelligent design theory, and that 300 or so scientists had signed a statement indicating that biologists were exaggerating claims for the theory. He had read about the famous Piltdown man hoax. He had an interest in creationism.\\" = Witnesses = Witnesses for the plaintiffs  ;September 27, 2005 * Kenneth R. Miller, a biology professor from Brown University and noted author and commentator opposed to the intelligent design and creationist movements, was the first witness. He testified as an expert witness that \\"Intelligent design is not a testable theory and as such is not generally accepted by the scientific community.\\" He said that the idea of intelligent design was not subject to falsification, and demonstrated that many claims made by intelligent-design advocates against evolution were invalid. When asked what the harm was in reading the statement, Miller gave a two-fold response. 1) \\"[I]t falsely undermines the scientific status of evolutionary theory and gives students a false understanding of what theory actually means.\\" And 2) \\"As a person of faith who was blessed with two daughters, who raised both of my daughters in the church, and had they been given an education in which they were explicitly or implicitly forced to choose between God and science, I would have been furious, because I want my children to keep their religious faith.\\" * Tammy Kitzmiller testified as a fact witness. She was the lead plaintiff and a parent of a child in the Dover school system. * Aralene \\"Barrie\\" D. Callahan, a Dover parent, was a plaintiff and was for ten years a board member of the Dover Area School District. She testified that Alan Bonsell, a board member, argued in a board retreat in Spring 2003 that if evolution were taught then creationism should also be taught. * Bryan Rehm was the last witness of the day. He was a former physics teacher at Dover and a parent to children attending school at the Dover Area School District. Both he and his wife were plaintiffs and taught Vacation Bible School. Rehm testified that Alan Bonsell, then-chairman of the board's curriculum committee, had asked teachers to watch a video on intelligent design titled Icons of Evolution. Teachers had expressed concern that Bonsell did not believe in evolution and wished to see classroom discussions of evolution balanced \\"fifty-fifty\\" with creationism. ;September 28 * Robert T. Pennock is a philosopher now working on the Avida digital organism project at Michigan State University where he is an associate professor. He is the author of many books and articles critical of intelligent design. He testified as an expert witness. * Julie Smith is a parent and plaintiff. She made only one point: that the policy created a hostile atmosphere for her daughter, Katherine.

His testimony essentially attempted a qualified defense of the scientific status of intelligent design, arguing that its history can be traced back to Newton, and should include such luminaries of modern biology as Linnaeus and Mendel. He also stressed a distinction from the philosophy of science between the \\"context of discovery\\" (what motivates a scientist) and the \\"context of justification\\" (how the scientist's theory is judged) in order to mitigate the undeniably religious origins of intelligent design. Fuller memorably called for an \\"affirmative action\\" program for intelligent design, which did not win much favor with Jones in his final decision.

Settlement of the legal fees  On February 21, 2006, the newly elected Dover Area School Board voted, unanimously with one abstention, to pay $1,000,011 in legal fees and damages due to the parents and their lawyers as a result of the verdict in the case, a large sum of money for a small district. The previous school board had been offered the opportunity to rescind its policy, and avoid paying legal fees, immediately after the lawsuit was filed in 2004, but it declined. The parents' attorneys Pepper Hamilton stated that court records would show that they were entitled to more than $2 million, but were going to accept less than half that amount in recognition of the small size of the school district, and because the school board that voted for the policy had been voted out of office, leaving the new school board \\"having the bill placed in their laps.\\" The previous school board had been defended without charge by the Thomas More Law Center. Richard Katskee, assistant legal director for Americans United, said of the trial's cost, \\"Any board thinking of trying to do what the Dover board did is going to have to look for a bill in excess of $2 million,\\" and \\"I think $2 million is a lot to explain to taxpayers for a lawsuit that should never be fought.\\"  Potential perjury and deceit  After the trial, there were calls for the defendants, accused of not presenting their case honestly, to be put on trial for committing perjury. \\"Witnesses either testified inconsistently, or lied outright under oath on several occasions,\\" Jones wrote. \\"The inescapable truth is that both [Alan] Bonsell and [William] Buckingham lied at their January 3, 2005 depositions. ... Bonsell repeatedly failed to testify in a truthful manner. ... Defendants have unceasingly attempted in vain to distance themselves from their own actions and statements, which culminated in repetitious, untruthful testimony.\\" An editorial in the York Daily Record described their behavior as both ironic and sinful, saying that the \\"unintelligent designers of this fiasco should not walk away unscathed.\\" Judge Jones recommended to the US Attorney's office that the school board members be investigated for perjury.The Devil in Dover, p.199 = Specific potential perjury = * The defendants claimed that they were presenting an alternative scientific theory, not promoting religion.

Buckingham had given the check to Alan Bonsell, who gave it to his father, who would \\"take it off the table\\" (according to Alan Bonsell) and buy the books.The Devil in Dover, p.171 The money had come from donations from parishioners of Buckingham's church after he stood up and said the board needed it.

Intelligent Design is a scientific theory.\\"Behe testified that ID is scientific But in his 2005-10-18 afternoon testimony, during cross-examination, Behe said that his definition of a scientific theory differs from the accepted definition and would allow both the long-disproved ether theory of light (idea of luminiferous aether) and astrology to be classified as scientific theories.Behe testified that astrology and ether are as scientific as ID Since the standard definition of a scientific theory includes \\"... a well-substantiated explanation ...\\", Behe's personal definition would allow for disproved ideas to be considered scientific theories, whereas the standard definition does not. Behe defended his version of the definition of scientific theory as being one that is commonly used among scientists. Who these scientists are and where they use the Behe definition was not clarified. But Behe's employer, Lehigh University, in an undated proclamation, stated the department faculty's unequivocal support for evolution and \\"...

During his 2005-10-17 (Day 10) morning testimony, when asked \\"Have other scientists acknowledged these design features of the flagellum?\\", Behe cited a 1998 article in the journal Cell by Brandeis University professor David J. DeRosier, The Turn of the Screw, The Bacterial Flagellar Motor, and Derosier's statement that the bacterial flagellum looked designed. Behe left it at that.Behe testified that Derosier agreed # He omitted, as Derosier pointed out in the Nova documentary, that Derosier wrote that bacterial flagellum looked like it was designed by a human.

Analysis and criticism  The University of Montana Law Review published three articles addressing this topic in its winter 2007 issue.\\"Articles - Editor's Note: Intelligent Design Articles \\", University of Montana Law Review, Volume 68, Number 1, April 10, 2007. David K. DeWolf, John G. West and Casey Luskin, senior fellows or officers of the Discovery Institute, argued that intelligent design is a valid scientific theory, that the Jones court should not have addressed the question of whether it was a scientific theory, and that the decision will have no effect on the development and adoption of intelligent design as an alternative to standard evolutionary theory. Peter Irons responded to the DeWolf et al. article, arguing that the decision was extremely well reasoned, and that it marks the end to legal efforts by the intelligent design movement to introduce creationism in public schools. It had been an essential part of the ruling to consider whether ID was a legitimate scientific theory as claimed by its proponents, and DeWolf, et al. had implicitly recognised this by citing the Lemon test, which would have been irrelevant if ID were legitimate science. DeWolf et al. responded to the Irons article in the same issue.

The route crosses four of the Bay State's 13 interstates, as well as U.S. Route 1 (US 1), US 3, Route 2 and Route 128 as it heads from the northern hills of Worcester County through the northern portions of Greater Boston, ending in the North Shore city of Beverly at Route 127. Route description Route 62 begins in Barre, in the north central hills of Worcester County, at Routes 32 and 122, at that town's commons. It heads northeastward into the town of Hubbardston, crossing Route 68 before heading into Princeton. In Princeton, Route 62 has a short concurrency with Route 31. It then crosses into Sterling, intersecting with Route 140 and passing underneath Interstate 190 without junction, before passing through that town's center concurrently with Route 12. Eastbound with Route 70 in Clinton Eastbound in Maynard Wood Square, Hudson, at the junction of Routes 62 & 85 From Sterling, Route 62 passes through the southern end of the town of Lancaster before entering Clinton. In Clinton, it is concurrent with Route 70 for most of the town, with a short section being triply concurrent, with Route 110. Routes 62 and 70 pass through the center of town and pass the dam on the Nashua River which creates the Wachusett Reservoir before Route 62 heads eastward again, splitting with Route 70 just north of the Boylston town line. After crossing through the town of Berlin, it crosses Interstate 495 at Exit 26 before crossing into Middlesex County and the town of Hudson. In Hudson, Route 62 has a short concurrency with Route 85 as it heads eastward, crossing the Assabet River before entering northward into the town of Stow. At the center of Stow, Route 62 turns eastward again, becoming concurrent with Route 117 for two miles into the town of Maynard. In Maynard, the route crosses the Assabet twice more, the second time concurrently with Route 27. Following the path of the Assabet, it then passes through the far southern corner of Acton before heading into Concord. In Concord, Route 62 joins that town's Main Street, passing the West Concord Depot, a commuter rail stop along the Fitchburg Line. As Main Street, Route 62 intersects Routes 2/2A and crosses the Sudbury River before leaving that road at Concord's town common, just south of the site of the Battle of Concord. Route 62 continues northeastward into Bedford, where it shares a concurrency with Routes 4 and 225, passing the historic Fitch Tavern before splitting from those roads. It then splits from that route, crossing U. S. Route 3 at Exit 26 before entering Burlington. It crosses the old Middlesex Turnpike before arcing northward to meet Route 3A just south of the Billerica town line. It becomes concurrent with Route 3A southward for half a mile before turning northward, heading into the town of Wilmington. In Wilmington it crosses Routes 38 and 129 just south of the Wilmington Station along the Lowell Line of the MBTA Commuter Rail line. It then crosses Interstate 93 at Exit 40 just east of Route 62's junction with the southern end of Route 125. After crossing I-93, Route 62 heads eastward into North Reading. It shares a quarter-mile long concurrency with Route 28 before continuing eastward through the town into Essex County and the town of Middleton. In Middleton, Route 62 heads north one final time, sharing a short wrong-way concurrency with Route 114 before turning eastward, crossing the Ipswich River before finally turning southeastward into the town of Danvers. In Danvers, the route has consecutive interchanges with U.S. Route 1 (along the Newburyport Turnpike) and I-95, just north of the former Danvers State Hospital site. It continues eastward, crossing Route 35 and Route 128 (at Exit 22) before entering Beverly. In Beverly, Route 62 crosses Routes 1A and 22 before finally ending at Route 127, just a tenth of a mile north of Mackerel Cove, Beverly Harbor and Massachusetts Bay.

A stream can be thought of as items on a conveyor belt being processed one at a time rather than in large batches. Streams are processed differently from batch data – normal functions cannot operate on streams as a whole, as they have potentially unlimited data, and formally, streams are codata (potentially unlimited), not data (which is finite). Functions that operate on a stream, producing another stream, are known as filters, and can be connected in pipelines, analogously to function composition. Filters may operate on one item of a stream at a time, or may base an item of output on multiple items of input, such as a moving average. Examples The term \\"stream\\" is used in a number of similar ways: * \\"Stream editing\\", as with sed, awk, and perl. Stream editing processes a file or files, in-place, without having to load the file(s) into a user interface. One example of such use is to do a search and replace on all the files in a directory, from the command line. * On Unix and related systems based on the C language, a stream is a source or sink of data, usually individual bytes or characters. Streams are an abstraction used when reading or writing files, or communicating over network sockets. The standard streams are three streams made available to all programs. * I/O devices can be interpreted as streams, as they produce or consume potentially unlimited data over time. * In object-oriented programming, input streams are generally implemented as iterators. * In the Scheme language and some others, a stream is a lazily evaluated or delayed sequence of data elements. A stream can be used similarly to a list, but later elements are only calculated when needed. Streams can therefore represent infinite sequences and series.SRFI 41: Streams * In the Smalltalk standard library and in other programming languages as well, a stream is an external iterator. As in Scheme, streams can represent finite or infinite sequences. * Stream processing — in parallel processing, especially in graphic processing, the term stream is applied to hardware as well as software. There it defines the quasi-continuous flow of data that is processed in a dataflow programming language as soon as the program state meets the starting condition of the stream. Applications Streams can be used as the underlying data type for channels in interprocess communication. Other uses The term \\"stream\\" is also applied to file system forks, where multiple sets of data are associated with a single filename. Most often, there is one main stream that makes up the normal file data, while additional streams contain metadata. Here \\"stream\\" is used to indicate \\"variable size data\\", as opposed to fixed size metadata such as extended attributes, but differs from \\"stream\\" as used otherwise, meaning \\"data available over time, potentially infinite\\".

Emily Lawless (17 June 184519 October 1913) was an Irish novelist, historian, entomologist, gardener, and poet from County Kildare. Her innovative approach to narrative and the psychological richness of her fiction have been identified as examples of early modernism. Biography She was born at Lyons House below Lyons Hill, Ardclough, County Kildare. She spent part of her childhood with the Kirwans of Castle Hackett, County Galway, her mother's family, and drew on West of Ireland themes for many of her works. Her grandfather was Valentine Lawless, a member of the United Irishmen and son of a convert from Catholicism to the Church of Ireland. Her father was Edward Lawless, 3rd Baron Cloncurry (d. 1896), thus giving her the title of \\"The Honourable\\". The death of her father when she was a girl plunged the family into financial difficulties which, compounded by her lack of access to family assets as a woman, meant that she relied on income from her books. Emily had five brothers and three sisters. Her brother Edward Lawless, who inherited the family home, was a landowner with strong Unionist opinions, a policy of not employing Roman Catholics in any position in his household, and chairman of the Property Defence Association set up in 1880 to oppose the Land League and \\"uphold the rights of property against organised combination to defraud\\". Emily Lawless was not in good terms with her brother Edward. The prominent Anglo-Irish unionist and later nationalist, Home Rule politician Horace Plunkett was a cousin. Lord Castletown, Bernard FitzPatrick, 2nd Baron Castletown was also a cousin. According to Betty Webb Brewer, writing in 1983 for the journal of the Irish American Cultural Institute, Éire/Ireland: \\"An unflagging unionist, she recognised the rich literary potential in the native tradition and wrote novels with peasant heroes and heroines, Lawless depicted with equal sympathy the Anglo-Irish landholders.\\" This is the prevalent view of Lawless, yet she unequivocally referred to her Irish \\"patriotism\\"Emily Lawless, 'Traits and Confidences', London: Methuen, 1898, p. 37., and her unshakeable love of Ireland, and several of her short stories denounce the inequalities brought about by colonialism and landlordism in Ireland. W.B.Yeats wrote scathingly about Lawless's supposed stereotyping of Irish peasants, and his views later contributed to the neglect of her work. Similarly, her initial opposition to female suffrage has been often read as an anti-feminist position (rather than a 'feminism of difference'), yet much of her work makes a strong case for female autonomy, in financial and creative terms, and Lawless was a noted and popular writer in the 'New Woman' movement which swept English fiction and journalism in the late nineteenth century. It has been speculated that she may have been lesbian and that Lady Sarah Spencer, dedicatee of A Garden Diary (1901) was her life-partner. She died at Gomshall, Surrey. She occasionally wrote under the pen name \\"Edith Lytton\\". Some archival material pertaining to Emily Lawless is held in Marsh's Library, Dublin. Writings Lawless wrote nineteen works of fiction, biography, history, nature studies and poetry, many of which were widely read at the time. She is increasingly considered a major fiction writer of the late nineteenth century, and an early modernist innovator. She is often remembered for her Wild Geese poems (1902). Her books were: * A Chelsea Householder (1882) * A Millionaire's cousin (1885) * Ireland (1885) * Hurrish (1886) * Major Lawrence FLS (1887) * With Essex in Ireland (1890) * Grania (1892) * Maelcho (1894) * Plain Frances Mowbray and Other Tales (1889) * A Colonel of the Empire (1895) * Traits and Confidences (1898) * Atlantic Rhymes & Rhythms (1898) * A Garden Diary (1901) * With The Wild Geese (1902) * Maria Edgeworth (1904) * Book of Gilly (1906) * The Point of View (1909) * The Race of Castlebar (1914) - co-authored with Shan Bullock * The Inalienable Heritage (1914) =Hurrish= Some critics identify a theme of noble landlord and noble peasant in her fourth book, Hurrish, a Land War story set in the Burren County Clare which was read by William Ewart Gladstone and said to have influenced his policy. It deals with the theme of Irish hostility to English law. In the course of the book a landlord is assassinated, and Hurrish's mother, Bridget, refuses to identify the murderer, a dull-witted brutal neighbour. It described the Burren Hills as \\"skeletons—rain-worn, time-worn, wind-worn—starvation made visible, and embodied in a landscape.\\" The book was criticised by Irish- Ireland journals for its 'grossly exaggerated violence', its embarrassing dialect, staid characters. According to The Nation \\"she looked down on peasantry from the pinnacle of her three generation nobility\\". Her reputation was damaged by William Butler Yeats who accused her in a critique of having \\"an imperfect sympathy with the Celtic nature\\" and for adopting \\"theory invented by political journalists and forensic historians\\". Despite this, Yeats included With Essex in Ireland and Maelcho in his list of the best Irish novels. =Essex and Grania= Her historical novel With Essex in Ireland was better received and was ahead of its time in developing the unreliable narrator as a technique. Gladstone mistook it for an authentic Elizabethan document. Her seventh book, Grania, about \\"a very queer girl leaping and dancing over the rocks of the sea\\" examined the misogynism of an Aran Island fishing society. =With the Wild Geese= Unusually for such a strong Unionist, her Wild Geese poems (1902) became very popular and were widely quoted in nationalist circles, especially the lines: :War-battered dogs are we, :Fighters in every clime; :Fillers of trench and of grave, :Mockers bemocked by time. :War-dogs hungry and grey, :Gnawing a naked bone, :Fighters in every clime :Every cause but our own Two of the poems including \\"Clare Coast\\" (source of the above lines) and \\"After Aughrim\\" were included in The Oxford Book of Irish Verse (1958).MacDonagh, Donagh & Robinson, Lennox, eds.

By the time of the 21st party congress of the Communist Party of the Netherlands in 1964 two pro-China fractions existed inside the party. One was the Marxist-Leninist Centre in Rotterdam. The other was a group based in Amsterdam which published the periodical Rode Vlag (Red Flag). The Rode Vlag- group was led by Chris Bischot, a district level leader of CPN. In December 1964 Bischot was expelled from CPN, along with the leaders of MLC. Initially there were talks on a merger between the two dissident communist factions, but such plans could not develop further mainly because of the perception held by the Rode Vlag-group that the CPN could still be converted into a revolutionary party. In 1966 the Rode Vlag-group started another periodical, Rode Jeugd (Red Youth). Through Rode Jeugd. Through the militant messages given in Rode Jeugd, the group expanded. It gained supporters in IJmuiden, Kampen, Eindhoven, Hague and Rotterdam. But Rode Jeugd would also give problems to the Rode Vlag-group. A clash of generations erupted, and in October 1967 the Rode Jeugd-group broke away and formed a separate organization called Rode Jeugd. In 1969 the group around Rode Vlag constituted BNML. By this time they had completely left the ambition to reform the CPN. Rode Vlag became the central organ of BNML. BNML also started Rood Metal (Red Metal) as a periodical of workers. By 1970 BVD estimated the BNML membership to around 40. The real figure was probably significantly higher. In 1972 BNML was joined by the Red Youth (marxist- leninist), which had broken away from Rode Jeugd. Bischot died in 1973. In the mid-1970s BNML played an important role in conducting debates on a possible merger of the various marxist-leninist factions. Excluded from the talks were the Socialist Party (who had moved away from the Maoist orthodoxy), Red Youth (which had developed into a terroristic orientation) and the Marxist-Leninist Party of the Netherlands (which was in reality, a BVD proxy). Thus the remaining organizations were the Communist Unity Movement of the Netherlands (marxist-leninist) (KEN(ml)), the Group of Marxist-Leninists/Red Dawn (GML), the Communist Circle of Breda (marxist-leninist) (KKB(ml)) and the Communist Workers Organisation (KAO). GML excluded itself from the process due to their rejection of unity with KEN(ml), and KEN(ml) could not arrive at a comprise with the other groups due to their persistence on claiming hegemony over the other factions. In 1978 BNML merged with KAO and KKB(ml) to form the Communist Workers Organisation (marxist-leninist) (KAO(ml)).

Lagnieu has four hamlets which are: Chanves, Charveyron, Posafol and Proulieu. Geography The city of Lagnieu is located south of the department of Ain, on the right bank of the Rhone, 50 km north-east of the Lyon area and 37 km south of Bourg-en-Bresse . The town belongs to the canton of Lagnieu which she is the chief town and the district of Belley. Attached to the foothills of southern Jura (Bugey), it belongs to the natural region of the plain of Ain, also name of the industrial park established about ten kilometers west of the town. Its territory has an altitude ranging from 192 m to 643 m, the town hall is 212 m.  History  According to a Latin text of the seventh century, Lagnieu derives from a landowner named Latinus, giving his name to the district and become Latiniacus.Marianne Mulon, « Anthropotoponymes. Appropriations, commémorations », in Actes du 16e Congrès international des Sciences onomastiques (16-22 août 1987), Université Laval, Québec, 1990, p.15-39. Around 1430, the inhabitants of Lagnieu seized six oxen belonging to the monks of the Carthusian monastery of Portes and ravaged their crops by releasing their pigs.Alain Kersuzan, Défendre la Bresse et le Bugey - Les châteaux savoyards dans la guerre contre le Dauphiné (1282 - 1355), collection Histoire et Archéologie médiévales n°14, Presses universitaires de Lyon, Lyon, 2005, (), p. 36. During the French Revolution, Lagnieu took the revolutionary name of Fontaine-d'Or.Les noms révolutionnaires des communes de France par Figuères In 1957, during the passage of a metal element intended for the Marcoule nuclear power plant, the \\"centipede\\", the Lagnieu fountain was accidentally destroyed. Geology The territory presents a seismic risk as well as natural and technological risks such as flood, dam break, industrial and nuclear risks, transport of dangerous goods. Several natural disasters have occurred in the past such as floods and mudslides (April 30 and May 1, 1983, September 26, 1987, October 9 to 12, 1988, February 13 to 18, 1990, June 25, 2006 CLimate Lagnieu, like the Lyon region, is located at a climatic crossroads. The climate is of a semi-continental type with Mediterranean aspects, especially in summer. Several southern species are present, including the Montpellier pistachio or several species of cicadas. [ref. necessary] The absence of wind in summer contributes to the stifling summer days in the Latini area and more generally Lyon. Population The evolution of the number of inhabitants is known through the censuses of the population carried out in the commune since 1793. As of 2006, the legal populations of the communes are published annually by the INSEE . The census is now based on an annual collection of information, successively covering all municipal territories over a period of five years.

Background The song was composed in the key of C major. At the request of Andy Warhol, band frontman Lou Reed wrote the song about Warhol superstar Edie Sedgwick. According to Reed, Warhol said when asked what he should write about her: \\"Oh, don't you think she's a femme fatale, Lou?\\", so Reed wrote \\"Femme Fatale\\". The song was recorded with vocals by Nico. Guitarist Sterling Morrison said of the song: > \\"Femme Fatale\\"—she [Nico] always hated that.[nasal voice] Nico, whose native > language is minority French, would say \\"The name of this song is 'Fahm > Fatahl'.\\" Lou and I would sing it our way. Nico hated that.

A 1969 live recording of the song was included in Bootleg Series Volume 1: The Quine Tapes released in 2001. Critical reception AllMusic critic Mark Deming thought that \\"Femme Fatale\\" was among the four best songs on the album. American music journalist Stephen Davis called \\"Femme Fatale\\" a beautiful song that portrays the vivid, conflicted and emotional undercurrents of 1966.

Peter Robert Edwin Viereck (August 5, 1916 – May 13, 2006) was an American poet and professor of history at Mount Holyoke College. He won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1949 for the collection Terror and Decorum.\\"Modern Timeline of Poetry\\" , University of Toronto In 1955 he was a Fulbright Scholar at the University of Florence. Background Viereck was born in New York City, the son of George Sylvester Viereck. He received his B.A. summa cum laude in history from Harvard University in 1937. He then specialized in European history, receiving his M.A. in 1939 and his Ph.D. in 1942, again from Harvard. Viereck was prolific in his writing from 1938. He published collections of poems, some first published in Poetry Magazine. He won the annual Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1949 for the collection Terror and Decorum.\\"Modern Timeline of Poetry\\" , University of Toronto In 1955 he was a Fulbright Scholar at the University of Florence. Viereck first taught during 1946–1947 at Smith College. In 1948 he joined the faculty at nearby Mount Holyoke College, also a women's college in Massachusetts. He taught history for nearly fifty years. He retired in 1987 but continued to teach his Russian history survey course there until 1997. Viereck died on May 13, 2006 in South Hadley, Massachusetts after a prolonged illness. Politics Viereck in the 1940s was an early leader in the conservative movement but by 1951 felt that it had strayed from true conservatism. This is reflected in his review of William F. Buckley's God and Man at Yale, The New York Times, November 4, 1951). In April 1940, Viereck wrote an article in the Atlantic Monthly (\\"But—I'm a Conservative!\\"found at theatlantic.com), partly in reaction against the ideologies of his father, George Sylvester Viereck, a Nazi sympathizer. His beliefs are difficult to categorize as they raise questions about what \\"conservative\\" really means: According to Tom Reiss, Viereck was right, as he wrote in Conservatism Revisited (1949), that he \\"had 'opened people's minds to the idea that to be conservative is not to be satanic.' But, he said, 'once their minds were opened, Buckley came in'.\\" In a review of Buckley's 1950 book God and Man at Yale, Viereck wrote: In 1962 he elaborated upon the differences he saw between real conservatives and those he called pseudo-conservatives.

He was previously a member of the Croatian Social Liberal Party (HSLS) and is currently a member of the Croatian Peasant Party (HSS). Rožić was born in Zagreb, as a fourth generation Agramer. His family was very well-to-do before the communists nationalised their property in 1945. His father was considered to be an Ustasha sympathizer and bourgeois, so in socialist Yugoslavia he had to accept jobs he was over-qualified for. Rožić obtained a degree in biology from the Faculty of Mathematics and Science at the University of Zagreb and pursued a scientific career. He planned to defend his doctoral dissertation in 1991 when war erupted in Croatia. Rožić joined the Croatian Army where he served as a translator, due to his fluent use of English, German and Italian. He was also a member of Croatian Social Liberal Party (HSLS), and in 1993 he was elected to Zagreb city council. In 1995, Rožić and his close friend Tonči Tadić left HSLS because of conflicts with party's president Dražen Budiša and party's positioning on the centre-left part of the political spectrum. The same year they joined the HSP. In 1997, Rožić was elected to the now non-existing upper house of Croatian Parliament. He and Tadić became major figures in HSP and refreshed party's image. Rožić became a party leader in Zagreb and ran for mayor in 2005, finishing solid third. In September 2007, after a spat with Anto Đapić, both Rožić and Tadić left HSP.

The price is then set so that the total demand across all agents equals the total amount of the good. Thus, a Walrasian auction perfectly matches the supply and the demand. Walras suggested that equilibrium would always be achieved through a process of tâtonnement (French for \\"trial and error\\"), a form of hill climbing. More recently, however, the Sonnenschein–Mantel–Debreu theorem proved that such a process would not necessarily reach a unique and stable equilibrium, even if the market is populated with perfectly rational agents. Walrasian auctioneer The Walrasian auctioneer is the presumed auctioneer that matches supply and demand in a market of perfect competition. The auctioneer provides for the features of perfect competition: perfect information and no transaction costs. The process is called tâtonnement, or groping, relating to finding the market clearing price for all commodities and giving rise to general equilibrium. The device is an attempt to avoid one of deepest conceptual problems of perfect competition, which may, essentially, be defined by the stipulation that no agent can affect prices. But if no one can affect prices no one can change them, so prices cannot change. However, involving as it does an artificial solution, the device is less than entirely satisfactory. As a mistranslation Until Walker and van Daal's 2014 translation, William Jaffé's Elements of Pure Economics (1954) was for many years the only English translation of Walras's Éléments d’économie politique pure. Walker and van Daal argue that the idea of the Walrasian auction and Walrasian auctioneer resulted from Jaffé's mistranslation of the French word crieurs (criers) into auctioneers. Walker and van Daal call this \\"a momentous error that has misled generations of readers into thinking that the markets in Walras's model are auction markets and that he assigned the function of changing prices in his model to an auctioneer.\\" See also * Double auction * Walras' law ReferencesBibliography * * Category:Types of auction Category:Wholesale markets Category:General equilibrium theory Category:Mathematical optimization ","title":"Walrasian auction"},{"id":"2761658","text":"Yvonne Barr (11 March 1932 – 13 February 2016) was a virologist who co- discovered the Epstein–Barr virus in 1964.

Mario Puzo considered the novel his finest, most poetic, and literary work. In one of his last interviews he stated that he was saddened by the fact that The Godfather, a fiction he never liked, outshone the novel based on his mother's honest immigrant struggle for respectability in America and her courage and filial love. Puzo said that the book's hero, Lucia Santa, is based on his own mother: \\"Whenever the Godfather opened his mouth, in my own mind I heard the voice of my mother. I heard her wisdom, her ruthlessness, and her unconquerable love for her family and for life itself. … The Don's courage and loyalty came from her; his humanity came from her… and so, I know now, without Lucia Santa, I could not have written The Godfather.\\" Plot The novel tells the story of the Angeluzzi-Corbos family, a family of immigrants living an adopted life in New York City. The head of the family is Lucia Santa, a wife, widow and mother of two families. It is her formidable will that steers them through the Great Depression and the early years of World War II. But she cannot prevent the conflict between Italian and American values. Miniseries in 1988, the novel was turned into a miniseries with Sophia Loren in the lead role.

Played out in the worlds of gambling, publishing and the film industry, John Merlyn and his brother Artie Merlyn obey their own code of honor in the ferment of 1950's America, where law and organized crime are one and the same. Set in New York, Hollywood, and Las Vegas, Mario Puzo considered Fools Die to be his personal favorite. The protagonist, John Merlyn, is mostly based on Mario Puzo himself. The paperback rights to the book were sold in 1978 by the publisher, G. P. Putnam's Sons, to New American Library for a then-record $2.55 million. Plot Fools Die starts in Las Vegas, where a group of close friends, including John Merlyn, Cully Cross, and Jordan Hawley, spend several weeks gambling at the Hotel Xanadu. None of these now close friends have met before meeting in Vegas, and indeed they are not long term friends, but simply people who for their own personal reasons have decided to stay in the hotel to gamble. The intro has adventures both gambling and womanizing in Vegas. One night, after a huge $500,000 baccarat and craps win, a depressed Jordan kills himself in his hotel room. Jordan's suicide was in spite of tying a dramatic winner take all $500,000 hand of baccarat, betting against the casino's owner, Alfred Gronevelt. After Jordan's death, Merlyn returns to his family in New York City and continues his life. Cully Cross decides to stay in Las Vegas permanently, and through his prowess as a gambler and a hustler, he has caught the eye of Alfred Gronevelt, the Xanadu Hotel owner. Gronevelt eventually recruits Cully as a key employee, and as time goes on, he grooms Cully as his second in command, and Cully prospers running the casino, and acting as a casino host. In New York, John Merlyn, who was an orphan and is now a government worker and moonlighting novel writer, struggles to make ends meet for his family. His father in law had helped him get the job as an administrative officer in a US Army Recruitment Center. One day, because he is near broke, Merlyn is persuaded by a crooked colleague at work to start taking bribery kick backs in return for getting the adult children of wealthy people out of the military draft by having them join the military reserve before their mailed draft notice is filed. Eventually, authorities find out about the draft scam, and Merlyn is put under grand jury investigation. Merlyn narrowly escapes any Federal charges by calling his old friend, the now mob connected casino manager Cully Cross in Las Vegas. Cross is able to use his political and business connections to get Merlyn off the legal hook. Soon thereafter, Merlyn is offered a job writing book reviews for a large magazine. There he meets a world-famous writer named Osano, and they become close friends. During this time, Merlyn has a successful novel published, and Hollywood studios bid on making the novel into a movie. The winning studio flies Merlyn to L.A to help with the novel's movie script, and to work with the movie producers. In California, Merlyn slowly falls in love with Janelle, a film actress. In the meantime, Merlyn becomes estranged from film production as he becomes aware of the subordination of writers to profit and studio drama that dominates in Hollywood. One several years, most of the people Merlyn feels closest to die. His dear friend, Cully Cross had been involved in an elaborate money exchange scheme with a Japanese millionaire customer at the Hotel Xanadu he worked at. While in Japan, in a move ordered by Gronevelt, the Xanadu owner, Cully is murdered. Merlyn's brother, Artie, dies after a sudden heart attack. After many years of partying and carousing with Merlyn, and even sleeping with Merlyn's girlfriend Janelle, Osano finds he suffers from an incurable disease and decides to kill himself.

Published in 1984 by Random House Publishing Group (), it is based on the life of Sicilian bandit Salvatore Giuliano. It is set in the same universe as Puzo's most famous work, The Godfather (1969), and contains characters from The Godfather. It is regarded as The Godfather's literary sequel and is the second book in The Godfather novel series. It was adapted into a film in 1987, though all Godfather references were removed for copyright reasons in the film adaptation. In this novel, the spelling of Salvatore Giuliano's name was intentionally changed by Puzo to \\"Guiliano\\". This novel, though a work of fiction, is based on the real life exploits of Giuliano. Plot In 1950, Michael Corleone, the son of American Mafia Don Vito Corleone, is preparing to return home to America after his exile in Sicily. He meets with Don Croce Malo, the most powerful Sicilian Mafia boss. Don Croce and Michael's father have allied to help the famous bandit Salvatore \\"Turi\\" Guiliano escape Sicily and go with Michael to America. Michael learns of a set of documents Guiliano has that would cause the downfall of the current Italian government, to be released upon Guiliano's death or capture, called the Testament. Michael also meets Guiliano's parents and Gaspare \\"Aspanu\\" Pisciotta, Guiliano's best friend and second in command. In 1943, Turi Guiliano and Aspanu Pisciotta are stopped by the Carabinieri, the corrupt Italian police, while smuggling food, but they refuse to give up the food or the name of who they were trading with. Guiliano is shot, but he manages to kill his attacker, a police Sergeant. Turi is carried by Aspanu to a local monastery, where he recovers from his wounds and learns more about the criminal side of Sicily under the care of the Abbot Manfredi. After he recovers, he and Aspanu makes their way back to Guiliano's home in Montelepre, where he is still being sought for the murder. While discussing his future with family and friends, the local police attempt to arrest Turi. Turi and Aspanu open fire on the trucks pursuing them and kill some policemen. They flee to the mountains. Innocent citizens of Montelepre are arrested in retaliation. Turi and Aspanu are met by Turi's godfather, Hector Adonis, who fails to dissuade them from becoming bandits. Turi and Aspanu decide to free the prisoners and break into the local police barracks where they are being held. Turi narrowly escapes death at the hands of the Corporal Canio Silvestro whose pistol fails when he pulls the trigger at Turi's head. The freed prisoners include local bandits Passatempo and Terranova, who join Turi's band. Guiliano begins to becomes famous throughout Italy after a high-profile robbery, and he becomes a hero in Sicily, as he gives away much of his band's earnings to the poor. Silvestro, disgraced after being spared by Guiliano, asks to join his band. They test his loyalty by asking him to execute Frisella, a barber who informed on Guiliano. Silvestro does so and they attach a note to his body saying \\"So die all who betray Guiliano\\". Guiliano comes to dominate the entire northwest corner of Sicily. Guiliano orchestrates a kidnapping of a Sicilian nobleman, Prince Ollorto. Ollorto's ransom is arranged by Don Croce, who Ollorto had been paying protection money to. The kidnapping causes Guiliano to come into direct conflict with Don Croce and the Mafia for the first time. Don Croce allows Guiliano to be assassinated by the other Dons, but Guiliano manages to avoid them all. Don Croce finally sends assassin Stefan Andolini, a cousin of Don Corleone's, whose life is only spared by Guiliano due to the intervention of the Abbot Manfredi, his father. Andolini joins Guiliano's band and acts as an emissary between Guiliano and Don Croce. In 1950 Trapani, Michael Corleone is joined by Peter Clemenza, a capo of Don Corleone's, who is helping with the escape. Michael meets Justina, Turi's pregnant wife, and Hector Adonis. She leaves for America. Adonis informs Michael that the Testament is hidden in a gift Guiliano's mother gave him and Michael sends it to his father in America. In 1947, Don Croce is aligned with the ruling Christian Democratic party, mostly to deny power to the Socialist parties that he believes could destroy the Mafia. Don Croce, along with Italy's Minister of Justice Franco Trezza, draw up plans to mount an offensive against Guiliano, but intend give foreknowledge of the plans to Guiliano in return for his help in swinging the upcoming election for the Christian Democrats. Guiliano accepts these terms, along with a promise of a pardon, and helps the campaign using propaganda and intimidation. A Socialist parade celebrating recent victories over the Christian Democrats takes place in the towns of Piani dei Greci and San Giuseppe Jato and converge at a plain called the Portella della Ginestra. Guiliano agreed to suppress the parade, giving his two chiefs, Passatempo and Terranova, orders to \\"shoot over their heads\\" to get the crowds to disperse. The men end up shooting too low, and massacre many people, including women and children. The massacre proves devastating for Guiliano's image in Sicily and destroys any hope of a pardon. Guiliano discovers that Passatempo had been paid off by Don Croce to shoot the paraders and Guiliano executes him. He also executes six Mafia chiefs who were defending the estate of Prince Ollorto from land claims by the local peasants. A large force in Sicily assembles under the command of Colonel Luca to take down Guiliano. Guiliano's parents and many citizens of Montelepre are arrested for conspiring with him. In retaliation, Guiliano robs a heavily guarded truck that held the money for paying the Carabinieri. Colonel Luca then calls for the rest of the reserve force to come in. Guiliano's band is falling apart, with Silvestro escaping to England and Andolini and Terranova being killed by police. With Colonel Luca's forces closing in and Don Croce having betrayed him, Guiliano knows he must leave for America or die in Sicily. Aspanu Pisciotta meets with Michael and tells him where to meet Guiliano. The next day, Clemenza and Michael are heading to the meeting place when they hear that Guiliano has been killed by the Carabinieri. They are arrested by Inspector Velardi, but are released soon after due to the intervention of Don Croce. Michael and Clemenza find out that, having grown increasingly paranoid and resentful of Guiliano, Pisciotta has betrayed Guiliano to Don Croce. Pisciotta had shot and killed Guiliano in a moment of panic, fearing that Guiliano knew of his betrayal. Later, imprisoned for banditry, Pisciotta is poisoned by Hector Adonis with the help of Don Croce. Adonis leaves a note in Pisciotta's pocket reading, \\"So die all who betray Guiliano\\". With Guiliano dead, Don Croce and the Mafia enrich themselves more than ever at the expense of the people of Sicily. Michael returns home to Long Island. Don Corleone tells him that they will not release Guiliano's Testament, under the deal he made with Don Croce to ensure Michael's safety. Michael, shocked, realizes that he had been unknowingly working against Guiliano, and that giving the Testament to his father had allowed Guiliano to be killed. Don Corleone teaches Michael a lesson: it is better to remain alive at whatever costs than to be a dead hero. Characters The real Salvatore Giuliano The principal characters that drive the plot of the story, many of whom are based on real-life figures. *Salvatore \\"Turi\\" Guiliano - A legendary bandit. Conceived in America and born in the small Sicilian village of Montelepre, Salvatore Guiliano is a tall and handsome young man living a relatively normal life for the first twenty years of his life, known as a gentle man and loved dearly by his friends, family and the inhabitants of his tiny village. However, while smuggling food and drink to prepare for the wedding of his sister, Guiliano and his childhood friend, Aspanu Pisciotta, are accosted by the corrupt Italian police, the Carabinieri, and after being shot by a sergeant, Guiliano kills the sergeant with a single shot from his pistol. Helped by Pisciotta, the severely injured Guiliano is taken to the nearby monastery, where the primary priest, the Abbot Manfriedi, shields him from the Caribinieri, and is soon healed back to full health by a doctor and the priests of the monastery. After leaving the monastery, Guiliano dedicates his life to being a bandit, and creates a band, living the next few years forming a legendary reputation all over Italy for his daring exploits in stealing from the rich and wealthy and in giving almost all of his earnings to the poor and underprivileged peasants of Sicily, who honor him as their hero. As his reputation and exploits increase, he is hunted both by the Italian government, who form a special taskforce to capture him, and the Mafia, headed by the capo dei capi, Don Croce Malo, whose interests and influence have been damaged by Guiliano and his band. He is betrayed and killed by his best friend Aspanu Pisciotta before he can escape to America with Michael Corleone.Aspanu Pisciotta (left) and Salvatore Giuliano in real life *Gaspare \\"Aspanu\\" Pisciotta - The childhood best friend and cousin of Salvatore Guiliano. A sly, thin and handsome young man, who suffers from tuberculosis, Aspanu Pisciotta was the closest and most trusted friend of Turi Guiliano, who trusted him with his life. As Guiliano's fame and reputation increases, Pisciotta gradually feels less and less significant and after much of his advice is ignored by Guiliano, Pisciotta is approached by Don Croce, who convinces him to betray Guiliano. *Michael Corleone - The American son of the famed Don Vito Corleone and heir to the Corleone family. Michael has spent four years in Sicily to avoid prosecution for his murder of a high-ranking New York City police officer. After the murders of his wife Apollonia and his brother Sonny, he is eager to return home to his family in New York. However, he is ordered by his father to escort famous bandit Turi Guiliano back to America with him. As he learns more about the reputation and exploits of the legendary Guiliano, Michael becomes intrigued by him and looks forward to their meeting, but Guiliano is killed before the meeting can take place. *Don Croce Malo - The extremely powerful capo dei capi who wields power not only in the entire island of Sicily but also in Rome and with the Italian government and the ruling Christian Democratic party. A legendary negotiator, Don Croce quickly rises to the head of the Mafia and early into Turi Guiliano's career, is eager to make Guiliano the heir to his Mafia empire, but is unable to do so due to Guiliano's deep hatred of the Mafia. As Guiliano's daring exploits increase and after Guiliano assassinates six prominent Mafia leaders and severely damages his interests, Don Croce decides to kill Guiliano, making a deal with Don Corleone to have the Testament kept from the public in exchange for the safety of his son Michael. After Guiliano's death, he and the Mafia are once again the undisputed rulers of Sicily, enriching themselves at the expense of the people. His character is believed to be based on real life Sicilian Mafia boss Calogero Vizzini. *Hector Adonis - Professor of literature and history in the University of Palermo and godfather to Turi Guiliano. A diminutive man, Adonis is an elegantly dressed and extremely intelligent academic, who commands also influence among the Mafia. He loves and cares for his godson Guiliano, whom he taught literature in his childhood and for whom he often brought many books to read while visiting him. *Stefan Andolini - An assassin and bandit who works for Don Croce, then for Turi Guiliano. He is a cousin of Vito Corleone (born Vito Andolini), who he works for in America for some years. He is ordered by Don Croce to join Guiliano's band and assassinate him when the opportunity strikes, but he and his men are found out. His men are killed but he is spared after the intercession of the Abbot Manfredi, who is secretly Andolini's father. He joins Guiliano's band for real and acts as an intermediary between Guiliano and Don Croce. He is killed shortly before Guiliano by Inspector Frederico Velardi. *Passatempo - A member of Salvatore Guiliano's band. A dangerous individual even as a youth, he killed the uncle who gave him his first donkey and turned to banditry along with his companion Terranova. The two were eventually captured and held in the Bellampo barracks, where they were rescued by Guiliano and Pisciotta, later joining their band. Unlike Terranova, he was unnecessarily cruel and lacking in principles, valuing money over all else. He is eventualy executed by Guiliano after he takes money from Don Croce to intentionally fire on the crowd in Portella della Ginestra massacre. *Terranova - A bandit and a member of Salvatore Guiliano's band. Once a hard-working farmer, he had turned to banditry when two tax collectors attempted to seize his prized pig. He was captured and placed in the Bellampo barracks alongside fellow bandit, Passatempo. Both were rescued by Guiliano and Pisciotta and they joined the band. Terranova was trusted with several important tasks such as escorting Guiliano's father and guarding VIP hostages. He also directly handled the band's other kidnapping for ransom plots. Though his fellow lieutenants Gaspare Pisciotta and Passatempo betrayed Guiliano, Terranova remained loyal. He was involved in the Portella della Ginestra massacre, but it was determined by Giuliano that he is not part of the massacre, unlike Passatempo, who had been paid by Don Croce Malo, to deliberately fire at the crowd. Terranova was a somewhat sentimental person with a desire for love. He had a mistress, a widow with children, who he provided for. Terranova was shot to death by the authorities after visiting her in Palermo.

He also played two seasons in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) for the Kintetsu Buffaloes (1987–1988). Oglivie batted and threw left-handed. Oglivie made his MLB debut on September 4, 1971, for the Red Sox and played his final big league game on October 5, 1986, for the Brewers. He hit for power fairly well, breaking the 40-home run mark in 1980 with 41, which was good for a tie (with Reggie Jackson) for the American League (AL) lead. Oglivie hit three home runs in a game three times. In the process, he became the first non-U.S. born player to lead the AL in home runs. In a 16-year Major League career, Oglivie posted a .273 batting average, with 277 doubles, 560 bases on balls, 235 home runs and 901 runs batted in (RBI), in 1,754 games. He had 87 career stolen bases and 784 runs scored. Oglivie picked up 1,615 hits in 5,913 at bats. Continuing his pro career in Japanese baseball (NPB), Oglivie played for the Kintetsu Buffaloes, powering 46 home runs in two seasons. He then returned to attempt a comeback in American minor league baseball (MiLB); although Oglivie posted great offensive numbers in only two Double-A games, it proved to be the end of his pro baseball playing journey. Oglivie has coached at various levels for a number of different organizations, including Milwaukee, Pittsburgh, San Diego, Tampa Bay, and Detroit. In 2000, he joined the Padres’ MLB staff for one season. The Colón, Panama, native was one of six post-1959 players selected as part of the 2012 class inducted in the Latino Baseball Hall of Fame.

He designed among the first high Renaissance buildings in Padua, the Loggia Cornaro, a garden loggia for Alvise Cornaro built as a Roman doric arcade. Along with his brother, Giovanni Antonio Falconetto, he was among the most prominent painters of Verona and Padua in the early 16th century. Biography Loggia Cornaro.jpgLoggia Cornaro, Padua Odeo Cornaro (fronte).jpgOdeo Cornaro, Padua Villa vescovi ingresso lato sx.jpgGarden façade of Villa dei Vescovi, Torreglia Palazzo dell'Orologio Padova.jpgEntrance portal at base of Torre dell'Orologio, Padua Falconetto was born in Verona into an established family of Veronese painters and studied in Rome for a time, in the studio of Melozzo da Forlì. On his return to Verona his standing in his rione made him of use to Emperor Maximilian, who was headquartered in Verona from 1509 to 1517, during the episode of the Italian Wars called the War of the League of Cambrai, and not simply for painting imperial arms to replace those of Venice that had been effaced on Maximilian's orders. With the return of a Venetian governor, Falconetto and his family were proscribed and seem to have withdrawn to Trent. Later his career was passed at Padua, where he was drawn by the patronage of Pietro Bembo and Alvise Cornaro, for whom Falconetto designed the Villa Cornaro at Este (since remodelled), of which an imposing adjacent gate remains. Cornaro's influence with the Bishop of Padua doubtless elicited Falconetto's commission to design the Villa dei Vescovi (\\"Villa of the Bishops\\") located in the town limits of Torreglia in the Euganean Hills. Other works of architecture at Padua include the Loggia Carnica, the Porta S. Giovanni and Porta Savonarola in the city walls, and the arch in Piazza dei Signori. Nearby, he designed the church at Codevigo. As a painter, several works by Falconetto are in the Museo Civico housed in the Castelvecchio. His frescos in the Duomo reappeared in 1870 from under their coat of whitewash applied in 1630 at a time of plague. Frescoes securely attributed to Falconetto decorate the Sala dello Zodiaco in the Palazzo di Bagno, now within Palazzo d'Arco, Mantua, probably executed c. 1520 for a member of the Gonzaga family, as Vasari remarks, \\"he produced at Mantua several things for signor Luigi Gonzaga\\". He died in Padua in 1535.

(or simply Bowring) was a Canadian operator of retail stores, mostly focused on gifts and home decor, throughout Canada. Bowring was formed in 1811 as a private company by Benjamin Bowring and his family, who had just moved to St. John's, Newfoundland. Benjamin Bowring, an English clockmaker, set up shop in that business, while his wife Charlotte established a dry goods store which evolved into a large department store on Water Street.Bowring - About Flag of Bowring Brothers Bowring Brothers was later engaged as a shipowner, fish and general merchant, and steamship agent. In the late 19th century, the Bowring Brothers chartered the ship Nelly, captained by Robert Austin Sheppard (1865–1909), to carry fish to ports in Pernambuco, Brazil and Sydney, New South Wales. The Bowring Brothers ran the Red Cross Line of steamships around Newfoundland and Labrador. In particular, the SS Florizel was one of the first passenger ships in the world specifically designed to navigate icy waters, useful also for seal hunting. Most famously, the Florizel was converted into a troopship and in October 1914 carried the first 540 volunteers of the Newfoundland Regiment into World War I. The numerous vessels owned by the Bowring family between 1818–1937 were cataloged by Arthur Wardle. From 1811 to date Bowring Brothers has been continuously engaged in Newfoundland's commerce, and at its peak the company had various operations on a global scale. After World War II, the company focused on its retail business, including the department store in St. John's and a chain of over 100 gift shops in shopping malls across Canada and the US.Bowring, Derrick (2015). Down to Bowring's: A Memoir. Creative Publishers. p. 133. The Bowring family sold the chain to new owners in the late 1980s or early 1990s, following which the St. John's store closed, leaving Bowring without any retail presence in the province for over a decade. In the early 2000s, Bowring began to shift its energy towards a series of \\"home stores\\" in power centres across Canada, currently numbering 34—including one in St. John's—but continues to operate 31 mall stores in larger centres. Fred Benitah, owner and chief executive officer of the privately owned home-goods retailer Benix & Company, Inc. (based in Toronto, Ontario), purchased the insolvent Bowring Brothers chain in October 2005. Fred Benitah and his brother Isaac Benitah together privately controlled a number of retailers including Fairweather, International Clothiers and Benix & Co. After U.S. retailer Bombay Company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on September 20, 2007, the U.S. business operations and inventory were acquired by a joint venture of Gordon Brothers Retail Partners, LLC, and Hilco Merchant Resources, LLC, on October 12, 2007 (with a plan to liquidate Bombay's U.S. stores) while Bombay's Canadian operations (after inventory disposition) were acquired by Bowring and Benix & Company. On November 6, 2018, Fluid Brands Inc (which supplies for Bowring and The Bombay Company) and is owned by retail mogul, Fred Benitah, claimed insolvency. They obtained protection from creditors under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. According to documents, Fluid Brands Inc is 50 million in debt. As of November 2018, both Bowring and The Bombay Company have shut down all supplier websites and are in liquidation process. As of January 2019 all Bowring and Bombay stores are closed.

In both cases, the term refers to the number of stitches per inch, not the size of the finished garment. In both cases, the gauge is measured by counting the number of stitches (in hand knitting) or the number of needles (on a knitting machine bed) over several inches then dividing by the number of inches in the width of the sample. Gauge on knitting machines There are two types of classification of Knitting Gauges or Unit of Measure: *A – Used for Cotton Fully fashion flat machines (Bentley – Monk, Textima, Sheller etc..) where “Gauge” is measured in 1,5” Inches (2,54 cm x 1,5) and the machine's gauge is expressed by the number of needles needed to achieve that gauge. *B – Used for hand, mechanical or modern Electronic Flat Machines (Stoll, Shima, Protti etc..), where gauge is measured in 1 inch increments (or 2,5 cm) and the machine's gauge is similarly measured by the number of needles required to achieve that number. Compared graduation scale Gauge (GG) A versus B system: A 30 GG (A) Cotton Fully fashion flat machine (30 needles in 1,5”) is comparable to a 20 GG (B) Electronic Flat machine, a 27 GG (A) is an 18 GG (B), an 18 GG (A) is a 12 GG (B), a 12 GG (A) is an 8 GG (B), a 7,5 GG (A) is a 5 GG (B) and a 4,5 GG (A) is a 3 GG (B). Factors that affect knitting gauge The gauge of a knitted fabric depends on the pattern of stitches in the fabric, the kind of yarn, the size of knitting needles, and the tension of the individual knitter (i.e., how much yarn they allow between stitches). * For example, ribbing and cable patterns tend to \\"pull in,\\" giving more stitches over an identical width than stockinette, garter, or seed stitch. Even the same stitch produced in two different ways may produce a different gauge. * Thicker yarns with less loft generally produce larger stitches than thinner yarns (reducing the number of stitches per width and length). * Larger knitting needles also produce larger stitches, giving fewer stitches and rows per inch. Changing needle size is the best way to control one's own gauge for a given pattern and yarn. * Finally, the knitter's tension, or how tightly one knits, can affect the gauge significantly. The gauge can even vary within a single garment, typically with beginning knitters; as knitters become more familiar with a stitch pattern, they become more relaxed and make the stitch differently, producing a different gauge. Sometimes the gauge is deliberately altered within a garment, usually by changing needle size; for example, smaller stitches are often made at the collar, sleeve cuffs, hemline ribbing or pocket edges. =Uneven knitting= Uneven knitting is a knitting technique in which two knitting needles of different sizes are used. The method is sometimes used when the knitter has a significantly different gauge on knit and purl stitches. It is also useful for producing elongated stitches and certain specialty patterns. Knitting gauge in patterns To produce a knitted garment of given dimensions, whether from one's own design or from a published pattern, the gauge should match as closely as possible; significant differences in gauge will lead to a deformed garment. Patterns for knitting projects almost always include a suggested gauge for the project. For illustration, suppose that a sweater is designed to measure 40\\" around the bustline with a gauge of 5 st/inch in the chosen stitch. Therefore, the pattern should call for 200 stitches (5 st/inch x 40\\") at the bustline. If the knitter follows the pattern with a gauge of 4 st/inch, the sweater will measure 50\\" around the bustline (200 st / 4st/in) -- too baggy! Conversely, if the knitter follows the pattern with a gauge of 6 st/inch, the sweater will measure ~33\\" around the bustline (200 st / 6st/inch) -- too tight! Generally, the gauge should match to better than 5%, corresponding to 1\\" of ease in a 20\\" width. Similar concerns apply to the number of rows per inch. Luckily, the gauge can be adjusted by changing needle size, without changing the pattern, stitch, yarn, or habits of the knitter. Larger needles produce a smaller gauge (fewer stitches per inch) and smaller needles produce a larger gauge (more stitches per inch). If necessary, further adjustments can be made by subtly altering the pattern dimensions, e.g., shortening a vertically aligned pattern. Ribbing can also be used to \\"draw in\\" the fabric to the proper gauge. Measuring knitting gauge To check one's gauge before starting a project, a sample of knitting (a swatch) is made, ideally in the stitch pattern used in the garment. The swatch edges affect the reading of the gauge, so it's best that the swatch be at least 4\\" square and more safely 6–8\\" square. Dividing the number of stitches used by the actual size of the sample gives the stitch gauge of that sample. Similarly, the row gauge is calculated by dividing the number of rows knitted by the length of the sample. Making a swatch also helps familiarize the knitter with the stitch pattern and yarn, which will lead to a more uniform gauge in the final garment.

The eastern terminus of the road is in , 51 km northwest of Sydney, where the road continues eastward as Kurrajong Road, which intersects the A9. The western terminus of the road is in , in the Blue Mountains, where the road continues as the Chifley Road. The route, part of the traditional Aboriginal pathway network, was shown to Archibald Bell, Jr. by Darug men Emery and Cogy in 1823. Subsequently, he was accompanied by the Government Assistant Surveyor and the route marked was known as Bell's Line, to be later cleared to become the second road across the Blue Mountains. Due to its condition and the gradients around Mount Tomah it was rarely used before World War II. The road was improved between 1939 and 1943, as an alternative to the Great Western Highway for the war effort. At the same time that it was improved the road from Bell via Scenic Hill to Lithgow was built, so that the westernmost section of Bell's Line of Road between Bell and Mount Victoria across the Darling Causeway (the vertical-sided ridge separating the Grose River and Cox's River catchments) carries relatively little traffic, but is a significant tourist route. Today, the route is still used as an alternative route across the Blue Mountains and is also a popular tourist drive. Route The eastern terminus of Bells Line of Road as an identified route began at the edge of the town of Richmond, but now officially begins at the Richmond Bridge across the Hawkesbury River. West of the Hawkesbury River it passes through the town of and the village of Kurmond, before bypassing Kurrajong. At Bellbird Hill it then proceeds to climb onto the Bell Range of the Blue Mountains, passing through Kurrajong Heights. When on the range, it proceeds through the fruit-growing areas of Bilpin and Berambing, before climbing and descending Mount Tomah, passing by the Mount Tomah Botanic Gardens. After Mount Tomah it proceeds through the Blue Mountains National Park passing Mount Bell and Mount Charles and passing close to Pierces Pass and Mount Banks. before Bell is the turn off to the villages of Mount Wilson and Mount Irvine. At the village of Bell, Bells Line of Road turns south to run along the crest of the Darling Causeway to Mount Victoria, passing the site of the now- demolished Hartley Vale railway station. From Bell the majority of traffic uses Chifley Road, which goes west to and the Great Western Highway. The route has numerous sections of steep and winding road. The steepest section is at Bellbird Hill, where the road rises around from the Hawkesbury Valley to the Bell Range. The road is steep with a grade of 1:8 and has several tight bends. Other steep sections include the east and west ascents of Mount Tomah and Mount Bell as well as \\"The Glen\\" on the west side of Kurrajong Heights. In recent years confusion has arisen as to the western terminus of Bell's Line of Road due to the New South Wales Roads and Traffic Authority (now Roads and Maritime Services) erecting incorrect road signage at a number of locations. This signage confuses the geographical feature of the Darling Causeway between Bell and Mount Victoria with the name of the road itself. =Route numbering= Bells Line of Road is part of the former State Route 40, which began in the Sydney CBD and ran via Victoria Road to Parramatta then via Windsor Road through Windsor to Richmond, then via Bells Line of Road and Chifley Road to terminate at the Great Western Highway in Lithgow. The continuity of this route was broken with the introduction of alpha-numeric route numbering in 2013: east of State Route 40 became A2 then A40, and west of Windsor (including Bells Line of Road) route B59. The length of Bells Line of Road between Richmond and is now designated as part of route B59, which from Bell continues west via Chifley Road to join the Great Western Highway at Bowenfels in Lithgow. JunctionsLowered speed limits In November 2007, the Roads and Traffic Authority (RTA) announced plans to lower the speed limits along much of Bells Line of Road. Within a week, sufficient opposition was expressed that the changes were put on hold. In October 2008, the same changes were again announced, with the RTA claiming that there had been community consultation, but numerous users of the road, including politicians and councillors based west of the Blue Mountains, claimed to have been unaware of any consultation. As a result of the changes, the maximum speed limit east of Bell is now . Future For many years, road-lobby groups have been pushing for what they call a \\"superhighway\\" across the Blue Mountains. They claim that the poor roads across the Blue Mountains are impeding economic growth west of the Mountains. In 2002, road-lobby groups secured $2 million in funding for a feasibility study into building a freeway following Bells Line of Road. The proposed freeway would have linked to the M2 Hills Motorway in Sydney and connected to the Great Western Highway west of Lithgow via a route across the Newnes Plateau. The study report, published in November 2004 concluded that, while feasible to build from an engineering perspective, it would not be economically feasible and would have massive impact on adjacent national parks and local communities. The Great Western Highway has been the main route across the Blue Mountains since its construction in 1815, but after the above studies found that a freeway would be too expensive to build along the route of Bell's Line of Road, the idea was abandoned. However Roads and Maritime Services' 2017 road corridor improvement program (https://www.rms.nsw.gov.au/projects/sydney-west/bells-line-of- road/index.html) provides for a somewhat more modest program of upgradings. It is also revisiting studies last undertaken in the 1960s to extend the planned Castlereagh Freeway (subsequently partly-built as the M2) to connect with Bell's Line of Road at Kurrajong Heights. If this project were to be implemented it would force major improvements to be undertaken to the route followed by Bell's Line of Road, due to the traffic volumes that would be generated by a freeway. Conversely, a freeway could not be justified without a major capacity increase on the Bell's Line of Road route. Alternative routes The next trafficable road north of Bells Line of Road that crosses the Blue Mountains is the Bylong Valley Way, which forms a more direct route between the Central West region and the Hunter Region, including the port of Newcastle, NSW.

The company was originally known as Lipman-Wolfe & Company, named after the two founding partners, Adolphe Wolfe and his uncle, Soloman Lipman. It is now defunct. The 1912 building in downtown Portland that was the company's flagship store is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, as the Lipman–Wolfe and Company Building. History In 1850, Lipman and Wolfe formed a partnership in Sacramento, California during the California Gold Rush. They became prosperous merchants, expanding into Nevada during the great silver rushes. The later decline of the Comstock Lode impacted the business, prompting Wolfe to move to Portland in 1880. Wolfe opened a new store in Portland, re-establishing his business. Floods and space limitations forced the store to move three times, the last of which was in 1912, when the flagship store was opened at Fifth and Washington Streets. The new store was just across the street from Meier & Frank's flagship store, sparking an intense rivalry. Lipman's was one of the anchor stores at the Washington Square mall from 1974–1979, before becoming Frederick & Nelson. Lipman's was well-known locally for establishing several \\"firsts\\" in Portland retail history: *The first use of an elevator system in a department store. *The first retailer to mark set prices on merchandise, eliminating haggling and the fashion code price system. *The first retailer to make change down to the penny instead of nickel. By the end of its identity, the Lipman's brand had grown into a chain of six stores. Adolphe Wolfe died in 1938, passing the company on to his nephew. In the 1950s, the Wolfe family sold Lipman's to the Dayton Hudson Company, which kept the Lipman's brand as a division. Lipman's began to lose market share to Meier & Frank in the 1970s, when Marshall Field's bought all six stores in 1979. All were rebranded as Frederick & Nelson in early April of that year.\\"Tonight we close our doors as Lipman's ....\\". Advertisement in The Oregonian, March 30, 1979, p. A3. In 1986, these stores, except for the downtown store which was closed, were re- branded as Crescent Outlets from The Crescent Chain based in Spokane and Owned by Frederick & Nelson. They were purchased by Lamonts in 1988. Brief resurrection In early 1987, F&N; Acquisition Corp., the owners of Frederick's announced that they would bring back the Lipman's name as an off- price retail division. Five Frederick & Nelson stores in Oregon and four Great Clothes Outlets in Washington were to be renamed Lipman's, but the Oregon locations instead were sold to The Crescent. These stores were slightly smaller in size than normal stores and catered to \\"fashion-conscious 20- to 40-year-olds with money to spend on career and casual wardrobes\\". The division was meant to compete directly with Nordstrom along with complementing its sister store. By January 1988, sales at the stores fell short of the $125-per- square-foot target. Ownership was handed over to F&N; executives and all the stores became Frederick & Nelson Red Tag Clearance Centers by mid-1988. All these stores were closed during 1990 cutbacks. Cinnamon Bear Lipman's is probably best remembered for the Cinnamon Bear, a popular Portland Christmas time tradition since 1937. The Cinnamon Bear was introduced as a Lipman's-sponsored radio story character, meant to count down the days until Christmas. Along with Santa Claus, his costumed likeness appeared every Christmas at Lipman's stores, handing out cookies to children. Frederick & Nelson continued the practice after absorbing the brand. The Cinnamon Bear survives today as a souvenir at the Fifth Avenue Suites. To this day, the Cinnamon Bear is aired during the holidays on K103. The Cinnamon Bear radio show can also be heard on Kool 99.1 in Eugene, Oregon every Christmas Portland flagship store reuse Frederick & Nelson closed the former Lipman's flagship store during a reorganization of the chain in 1986. The building was listed in the National Register of Historic Places, as the Lipman–Wolfe and Company Building, in 1988. In 1996, after extensive renovation, the ten-story, half-block building reopened as the Fifth Avenue Suites, a 222-room hotel. In 2007, the Fifth Avenue Suites was renamed the Hotel Monaco.

Woodson High School or simply Woodson, is a high school located in Fairfax County, Virginia, in the east end of the city of Fairfax, opposite the shopping center on Main Street. The school opened in 1962 and was once the largest school in the state. It is named for W. T. Woodson, who served as Fairfax County School Superintendent from 1929 to 1961. As of 2016, the student population was roughly 2,400. Woodson has the largest campus in Fairfax County in size of area, and also houses Woodson Adult High School, a separate education facility run by FCPS that allows adults to earn their GEDs and HS diplomas. Woodson has appeared multiple times on Newsweek magazine's lists of top or best high schools, including #23 (2003), #34 (2005), #90 (2006), and #74 (2008).

The project was paid for in bonds that were established in 2003 by a voter referendum. The issue of whether to renovate had been debated for several years before the plan was approved. Woodson was one of the oldest schools in Fairfax County Public Schools, as the main facilities (plumbing, heating/cooling, floors, electrical) were still fundamentally the same as they were when the structure was built. The renovations nearly doubled the square footage of the school. The project was completed in 2009. The renovation consisted of complete renovation to all existing interior spaces, as well as adding to the performing arts and athletic wings, creating a new administration wing with a new front entrance, highlighted by a large tower and the addition of a new science classroom wing and two student drop off areas. Activities, groups, and programs Woodson's mascot is a Cavalier and the sports teams play in the AAA Patriot District and the Northern Region. In 1976, the Washington Diplomats of the North American Soccer League used the school's stadium as their home field. =Publications= The Cavalcade is the school newspaper.

Geography The village is situated in the upper section of the narrow Valserine valley, nestled between high limestone cliffs to the south-east that form the first anticline of the Jura mountains and the edge of the Lajoux plateau to the northwest. However, only the south-eastern side of the valley is within the commune's boundary, which stretches from the source of the Valserine river in the north, to the entry into Lélex, further down the valley, in the south. The commune is roughly 16 km long and 2 km wide. Despite its high altitude (just under 1000 m), the village is built around a crossroads of regional importance: the valley road (D991) which links Bellegarde-sur-Valserine with Les Rousses here crosses the D936 which links Saint-Claude with Geneva over the Col de la Faucille. Both are former routes nationales. HistoryOrigins= In 1334 the valley was declared common property and revenue was shared between Jean II de Rossillon and Hugues de Joinville, Sire of Gex. The agreement thereby struck up stated that a hospice should be paid for and built within the valley. The hospice was inhabited by monks who were charged with caring for the poorest pilgrims visiting the tombs of the Saints of Condat in Saint-Claude. Most of the pilgrims were from Geneva or Savoy. This was the first building to be inhabited year-round in Mijoux. =The 15th to 18th centuries= Because of climate conditions within the valley that meant that winter was harsh and that spring was virtually nonexistent, the valley had remained uninhabited for a long time. However, due to the hospice, houses gradually appeared and work to clear the pines began so as to allow agriculture. At first houses were built along the road that links Lajoux to the Col de la Faucille and it would not be until 1601 at the Treaty of Lyon that the river that bisects the town would become a border: the south- eastern side of the valley became French. In 1612 at the Franco-Spanish treaty, signed in Auxonne, the Valserine was chosen as the border between France and Spain. The north-western side of the valley was ceded to France in 1678 at the Treaties of Nijmegen. =The 19th century until today= At the Treaty of Paris in 1815, after Napoleon's downfall, the new border was defined, as it remains today: it passes along Mijoux's thin northern edge. The French customs, however, were set up along the Valserine as Mijoux, Lélex, Chézery-Forens and the Pays de Gex became a pays franc. Today, the Valserine river serves as the border between the regions of Franche-Comté and Auvergne- Rhône-Alpes, Mijoux lying within the latter for its most part. During this time, the valley was inhabited by numerous families, whose jobs changed depending on the season. During the summer, tasks included collecting fodder for the livestock, cultivating barley and potatoes as well as collecting firewood. In winter, when the ground was covered in snow, the same families cut and polished gems. However, the bloodshed of the Great War and the resulting economic crisis contributed to the abandonment of farms and a downturn in population levels that left the commune with only half the population it had had 50 years previously. Today and since 1969, tourism is revitalising this village, mainly due to winter sports. The commune has, for the past 20 years, belonged to the Parc naturel régional du Haut-Jura. PopulationEconomy Mijoux's economy is largely driven by tourism, for the winter sports practised here. Since 1999, Mijoux has been part of the Monts Jura ski resort. Ski lifts link Mijoux to the Col de la Faucille at 1308 m and to Mont Rond, at an altitude of 1543 m above sea level, one of the highest in the Jura Mountains. This part of the ski station is used mostly by downhill skiers. La Vattay, further up the valley but still within Mijoux, is a centre for cross-country skiing.

In 1915, she became the first woman to drive a car unaccompanied across the United States, with her 49-day journey from Hollywood to New York City. Early life Born Anna Keppen to German immigrants in Michigan City, Indiana, her father committed suicide in 1896 when she was twelve years old and two years later her mother died of pulmonary tuberculosis. Left an impoverished orphan with siblings, Keppen went to work as a house servant and in her late teens moved to Chicago. There, the attractive young girl found employment doing modeling and acting in minor parts in theatre. Around 1908 she moved to the West Coast where she developed a fascination with powerful cars after working as a model at California auto shows. Keppen soon learned to drive and by the early 1910s was competing in auto races. The Lasky studio historian, Boswell McGaffey, claimed that she was the first woman automobile racing driver. Following her hospital recovery from an accident in a race in Phoenix, Arizona, she gave up racing and, with the rapid growth of the Hollywood film industry, returned to acting using the stage name Anita King. Her theatre experience opened the door to roles with the Jesse L. Lasky Feature Play Company under director Cecil B. DeMille. Across the United States A film stunt in progress. In 1915, King decided to put her automobile driving experience to the test and set out to become the first female to drive alone across the continental United States. With the backing of studio boss Jesse L. Lasky, and his newly formed Paramount Pictures, they got the Kissel Motor Car Company to provide her with a vehicle equipped with Firestone tires. Dubbed \\"The Paramount Girl,\\" amidst much publicity on August 25, she set out in her Kissel Kar from Paramount's studio in Hollywood. The Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"Her only companions will be a rifle and a six shooter.\\" Lasky arranged for Geraldine Farrar to bid farewell to King at the start of the trip. First heading north to San Francisco, King spent several days doing publicity appearances at the Panama-Pacific World's Fair. With even more fanfare, and declaring that \\"if men can do it, so can a woman,\\" she headed east. After many promotional stops at Paramount theaters along the way, and coverage by major newspapers coast to coast, on 19 October, after forty-nine days on the road, King received a hero's welcome in New York City, with Motor Age remarking she had arrived with \\"Los Angeles air in the front tires of her car\\". Fame King's accomplishment made her a national celebrity and Paramount Studios quickly began production of a movie version of her trip titled \\"The Race\\", directed by George Melford. King made numerous public appearances on behalf of the studio, the Kissel, and Firestone, doing daredevil auto stunts and being photographed with the likes of Barney Oldfield driving his famous Golden Submarine. 200px She used her fame to do charitable works and helped organize a recreation club for young girls trying to get a start in the film business. In 1918, when the U.S. had become involved in World War I, she made a national speaking tour on behalf of the war effort, driving alone across the southern part of the United States from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C.. King appeared in fourteen films while at Paramount, including four with major star Wallace Reid, but in 1918 left to work with Triangle Film Corporation and other studios. She made her last film in 1919 and with the rapid changes in automotive technology plus new and more spectacular racing events, quickly faded from the public eye. Family members said she did not make it in the \\"talkies\\" because she had too low of a voice from years of cigarette smoking. Her first marriage was to James Stuart McKnight, a National Guard officer serving during World War I in Paris, France.\\"English Tots Most Ill-Fed,\\" Los Angeles Times, October 12, 1919, page II-7\`Library card required\` In the early 1930s, she married Thomas Morrison McKenna, a wealthy steelmaker. Widowed in the 1940s, she became part of the Hollywood elite, joining such others as Louis B. Mayer and William Goetz as owners of thoroughbred racehorses. In 1951, jockey Johnny Longden rode her colt Moonrush to victory in the Santa Anita Handicap. Death King died of a heart attack in 1963 at her home in Hollywood and is buried at Forest Lawn in Glendale, California.

It originated in the group around the periodical Rode Jeugd, which had been started by the pro- China Rode Vlag-grouping in 1966. In October 1967 the group around Rode Jeugd broke away, and formed their own organisation, Red Youth. The group was most active in the city of Eindhoven. They also used the names Revolutionair Volksverzet Nederland (Revolutionary People's Resistance Netherlands, RVN) and Philips Griekenland Aktiegroep (Philips Greece Action Group) as public cover names for \\"illegal\\" actions.https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/42090362.pdf (born 1950) became the national secretary of Red Youth. Inside Red Youth two wings emerged. On one side stood the 'terrorists', who were inspired by the West German Red Army Faction (Rote Armee Fraktion, RAF) and who saw the strategy of urban guerrilla warfare as a path to follow to overthrow capitalism, and on the other the 'economists', who wanted to focus on socioeconomic struggles. After the Red Youth congress in July 1971 the 'economists', based in the Red Youth branches in Amsterdam and Kampen, broke away and formed the Red Youth (Marxist-Leninist). At the same time two other Red Youth branches broke away, Rotterdam and Nijmegen, alongside the existing one in Eindhoven, where the leader was Henk Wubben. After the splits the Red Youth was in the hands of those who wanted to develop urban guerrilla. Red Youth members received military training at Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine camps in South Yemen from RAF instructors. They carried out a number of actions, including bomb attacks and molotov cocktail attacks. Most of their bomb attacks were focused in Eindhoven. They also targeted Japanese emperor Hirohito on his state visit to the Netherlands in 1971, burning Japanese flags in front of cameras and a bomb being placed at his hotel, which failed to explode. However, no-one was ever killed in any of the Red Youth's actions. In September 1972 they blew up the car of the Eindhoven police commissioner, J. Odekerken, and the residence of the mayor, Herman Witte. Then on 17 October they planted a bomb under the car of Philips commissioner J.G. Bavinck. American-owned targets in Utrecht and Rotterdam were also bombed, for which the group claims it was directed at \\"U.S. imperialism, in particular Vietnam and Chile.\\" Nobody was injured in these attacks, but it caused much hysteria and a high number of further false bomb alerts in October. After these attacks, in December 1972, Van Hoesel was arrested and was later sentenced to two years in jail for possession of weapons and illegal explosives. Red Youth set up front organizations such as Rode Hulp (Red Aid), giving assistance to prisoners, and Rood Verzetsfront (Red Resistance Front). Through the latter Red Youth conducted protest actions in support of Van Hoesel and RAF prisoners. In June 1973, the group was severely weakened following the arrest of member Ger Flokstra, who was carrying bomb supplies in a plan to bomb American targets. The belief of infiltrated informants in the group caused paranoia and distrust between the members of Red Youth. Officially, the organisation was disbanded on 14 March 1974 - however some members continued activities with the Red Aid organisation.

Because of geographical proximity, similar topography and landscapes, and shared culture and history, the Potomac Highlands region also includes Pocahontas, Randolph, and Tucker counties, even though they are in the Monongahela River or New River watersheds and not that of the Potomac River.West Virginia Travel Regions, General Information, The Wonders of West Virginia: Potomac Highlands, New River, Greenbrier Valley, Eastern Panhandle, Mountaineer Country, Northern Panhandle, Mountain Lakes, Metro Valley, Mid-Ohio Valley 2007 Citynet LLC. All rights reserved, Site Design and Hosting by Citynet (ret. July 11, 2010). The Potomac Highlands broadly overlaps, but is not identical with, the four-state Allegheny Highlands or High Alleghenies region which includes the relatively high and rugged mountains along and near the Allegheny Front from extreme southern Pennsylvania southward across Maryland and West Virginia into adjacent Virginia.  Geography  The region's geologic setting and landscape history make the Potomac Highlands one of the most scenic areas within the central Appalachian Mountains. The eastern part of the region is within the Ridge and Valley physiographic province, where long, steep-sided mountain ridges alternate with parallel broad, flat valleys. Water gaps, where rivers or streams have cut through the ridges, are important not only for their dramatic scenery, but also for their utility as easy crossings of these otherwise formidable mountains for roads, railroads, and telephone and telegraph lines. The western portion of the Potomac Highlands is within the Allegheny Plateau, with the Allegheny Front's prominent escarpment providing the boundary between these two areas. While much of the land in the Potomac Highlands is privately owned, large portions of the area are within the Monongahela National Forest, the George Washington National Forest, or various other kinds of parks, preserves, or other managed wild areas. A group of sites within the Allegheny Highlands has been proposed for inclusion as a new unit within the U.S. National Park System. The Fairfax Stone, marking the source of the Potomac River, is along the north edge of the Potomac Highlands, just south of the southern tip of western Maryland. = Ridge and Valley region = Among notable scenic features or wild areas within the Ridge and Valley portion of the Potomac Highlands are: * The Germany Valley * The Germany Valley Overlook, on U.S. 33 on the western slope of North Fork Mountain * Greenland Gap, a preserve owned by The Nature Conservancy * Ice Mountain, a preserve owned by The Nature Conservancy * Lost River State Park * Nathaniel Mountain Wildlife Management Area * North Fork Mountain, along the axis of the Wills Mountain Anticline, a long, high ridge crossed only by U.S. 33; Kile Knob, Panther Knob, and Pike Knob are among the mountain's high points * North Fork Mountain Red Pine Botanical AreaForest Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture (September 2006), Monongahela National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan; Chapter III, pp 46 and 62. * The North Fork Water Gap, west of Petersburg * Reddish Knob, on Shenandoah Mountain on the state line with Virginia * Seneca Caverns, in the Germany Valley * Seneca Rocks and such similar near-vertical Tuscarora quartzite outcrops as Champe Rocks, Nelson Rocks, and Judy Rocks, all structurally parts of the western limb of the Wills Mountain Anticline. * Short Mountain Wildlife Management Area * The Smoke Hole (or Smoke Hole Canyon) * Smoke Hole Caverns * Trout Pond Wildlife Management Area The George Washington National Forest includes six Recreation Areas within the Potomac Highlands’ Ridge and Valley region: Brandywine RA, Camp Run RA, Rock Cliff RA, Shenandoah Mountain RA, Trout Pond RA, and Wolf Gap RA. = Allegheny Front = The Allegheny Front provides the setting for various high, openly vegetated areas atop massive outcrops of the Pottsville sandstone, including: * Spruce Knob, West Virginia's highest point * Dolly Sods, including the Dolly Sods Recreation Area and the Dolly Sods Wilderness = Appalachian Plateau = Within the region's three western counties, landscapes of the Appalachian Plateau include such features as: * Beartown State Park * Big Ditch Wildlife Management Area * The Blackwater Canyon * Blackwater Falls, in Blackwater Falls State Park * The Canaan Valley, including the Canaan Valley National Wildlife Refuge and Canaan Valley Resort State Park * Cass Scenic Railroad State Park * Cranberry Glades Botanical Area * The Cranberry Wilderness and the Cranberry Backcountry * Droop Mountain Battlefield State Park * Gaudineer Knob (within the Gaudineer Knob Recreation Area) * Greenbrier River Trail State Park * Handley Wildlife Management Area * The High Falls of the Cheat River * Hills Creek Falls * Kumbrabow State Forest * The Otter Creek Wilderness * Seneca State Forest * The Sinks of Gandy * The Valley Bend Wetland * Watoga State Park The Monongahela National Forest includes a number of Recreation Areas on the Appalachian Plateau, including: Bear Heaven RA, Bickle Knob RA, Big Bend RA, Bird Run RA, Bishop Knob RA, Cranberry RA, Gaudineer Knob RA, Horseshoe RA, Lake Buffalo RA, Laurel Fork RA, Old House Run RA, Pocahontas RA, Red Creek RA, Red Lick RA, Spruce Knob Lake RA, Stuart RA, and Tea Creek RA.

The channel, available through cable and satellite distributors in the United States, produces a number of original series and documentaries with emphases in comedy, history, lifestyle, music and drama. BYUtv also regularly broadcasts feature films, nature documentaries, acquired medical/crime dramas and religious programs (consistent with the university's sponsoring organization, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Additionally, BYUtv Sports is the primary broadcaster of BYU Cougars athletics, producing more than 125 live sporting events in 2012 alone. The channel has won multiple Emmy Awards, and several of its original series have been praised by national television critics. BYUtv broadcasts all of its original content, and most acquired content, worldwide online via its website. BYUtv is also carried through KBYU-TV, a television station in Provo, Utah also owned by the university, ensuring HD coverage across Salt Lake City and most of Utah. The channel is one of several operated by the university's BYU Broadcasting division, including the world feed BYUtv Global and BYUradio. Multiple celebrity guests and artists have made special appearances on BYUtv, notably Imagine Dragons and Neon Trees on the series AUDIO-FILES; Lea Salonga, Howard Jones, Duncan Sheik and Sixpence None the Richer on The Song That Changed My Life; and Shawn Bradley, The Piano Guys, and Mates of State on Studio C. Major athletes like Steve Young, Ty Detmer and Jimmer Fredette have also appeared on special BYUtv Sports broadcasts. History Old BYU TV logo BYUtv was founded in 2000, and has grown from a \\"relatively unknown cable channel on a single satellite\\" to a national provider on Dish Network, DirecTV, and over 600 cable systems in the US. During 2010 and 2011, newly appointed BYUtv director of content, Scott Swofford, commissioned focus groups targeting TV viewers who were at least nominally religious, to see what they liked, disliked and wanted on TV. Swofford summarized the results as, \\"We want to be entertained. Then we'll stick around for the message.\\" This led to the creation of the pilot for Granite Flats, which became BYUtv's first and flagship original scripted television drama series, and went on to significantly expand the channel's audience, eventually attracting about 500,000 viewers per episode, compared to the previous top-rated show, Love of Quilting, which typically drew under 10,000. Programming BYUtv produces shows under several categories: BYU Sports, Campus, Documentary, Faith, Family, Lifestyle, People, and Performing Arts. This includes original series, documentaries and religious service programs. The network also maintains film agreements with Walt Disney Pictures, 20th Century Fox, Sony Pictures Entertainment, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Universal Pictures.

Beginning in 2009, the network also began covering BYU-Hawaii Seasiders sports, including all conference home games in women's volleyball and men's basketball, as well as select conference home games in women's basketball and additional non-conference home games for men's basketball. In 2011, BYUtv added the WCC Men's and Women's Basketball Tournaments to their sports broadcasts. BYUtv produced the first round and quarterfinals of the men's and women's basketball tournaments, which were also broadcast on ESPN3.com. In 2011, ESPN reached a deal to become the official broadcaster for most games of the newly independent BYU Cougars football team. At least one home game per season will air live on BYUtv, along with reruns on BYUtv of home games broadcast on ESPN's networks. Its coverage also includes pre-game and post-game shows, with the pre-game show Countdown to Kickoff hosted by BYU Cougars alumni Alema Harrington, Dave McCann and a rotating panel of analysts: Gary Sheide, Blaine Fowler, David Nixon, Brian Logan and Jan Jorgensen. In 2014 Spencer Linton would replace Alema Harrington on the panel. Additionally, the network launched a separate website for its sports coverage, Byutvsports.com, in partnership with ESPN and IMG College. The site features news, video and free video on demand streaming of recent games. The site folded back into byutv.org in fall 2015. The channel also produces its own sports shows including BYU Sports Nation (weekdays, 1 hr), Countdown to Kickoff (preceding each football game, 1 hr), Postgame Show (following each football game, 30m – 1 hr), After Further Review (weekly on Tuesdays, 1 hr), Inside BYU Football (weekly on Tuesdays, 1/2 hour) and previously carried Bronco Mendenhall's post-game press conferences for football games.

He was the pilot for Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo, the Portuguese captain who was sent by the viceroy of New Spain, with two ships in 1542 to explore what is now Northern California. Cabrillo's expedition was the first European exploration of the West Coast. The expedition started on June 27, 1542 from Barra de Navidad, Jalisco, and sailed along the coast up to Punta del Año Nuevo, 37° 10' north of Monterey. The vessels were tossed about, and often separated from each other by the bad weather. Cabrillo died on January 3, 1543, on San Miguel Island, near the channel of Santa Barbara; but Ferrer, who succeeded him in command, continued his discoveries northward up to lat. 43°, where he saw the coast of Cape Blanco, later called Cape Orford by George Vancouver. Excessive cold, want of provisions, sickness, and the unsoundness of his vessel, forced him to return without reaching the parallel mentioned in his instructions. At 41° 30' he perceived a point of land to which, in honor of the viceroy, he gave the name of Cape Mendocino. From this point he sailed back to La Navidad, situated at 19° 45', where they arrived April 14, 1543, and established the fact that the coast was one continuous line between these two points. In this voyage the Spaniards often saw the natives of the country, who were almost naked and painted their faces. He said that “the Indians were weird but smart\\".

Structure Its fibers run perpendicular to the external oblique muscle, beginning in the thoracolumbar fascia of the lower back, the anterior 2/3 of the iliac crest (upper part of hip bone) and the lateral half of the inguinal ligament. The muscle fibers run from these points superiomedially (up and towards midline) to the muscle's insertions on the inferior borders of the 10th through 12th ribs and the linea alba. In males, the cremaster muscle is also attached to the internal oblique. =Nerve supply= The internal oblique is supplied by the lower intercostal nerves, as well as the iliohypogastric nerve and the ilioinguinal nerve. Function The internal oblique performs two major functions. Firstly as an accessory muscle of respiration, it acts as an antagonist (opponent) to the diaphragm, helping to reduce the volume of the chest cavity during exhalation. When the diaphragm contracts, it pulls the lower wall of the chest cavity down, increasing the volume of the lungs which then fill with air. Conversely, when the internal obliques contract they compress the organs of the abdomen, pushing them up into the diaphragm which intrudes back into the chest cavity reducing the volume of the air-filled lungs, producing an exhalation. Secondly, its contraction causes ipsilateral rotation and side-bending. It acts with the external oblique muscle of the opposite side to achieve this torsional movement of the trunk. For example, the right internal oblique and the left external oblique contract as the torso flexes and rotates to bring the left shoulder towards the right hip. For this reason, the internal obliques are referred to as \\"same-side rotators.\\" See also *Abdominal exercise References * Moore, Keith L; & Dalley Arthur R (2006).

Early life and education Ross was born Steven Jay Rechnitz on April 5, 1927, in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Jewish immigrants. His father—who lost all his money during the Great Depression—changed the family name to Ross in hope of finding work with fewer struggles. Ross attended Paul Smith's College for two years and then joined the U.S. Navy. After his military service, he went to work at his uncle's store in the Garment District in Manhattan. Career In 1953, he married Carol Rosenthal, the daughter of a Manhattan funeral home owner, Edward Rosenthal, who operated the largest funeral company in the United States, Riverside Memorial Chapel, where he accepted employment as a funeral director. After noticing that the limousines used in funeral processions were not being used at night, he convinced his father-in-law to let him establish a separate company that would lease out the vehicles in the evenings. The company was solidly profitableNew York Times: \\"A $78 Million Year: Steve Ross Defends His Paycheck\\" BY ROGER COHEN March 22, 1992 and enabled Ross to obtain bank financing to start a rental company, Abbey Rent a Car. He later merged Abbey with a parking lot operator, the Kinney Parking Company, which was then owned by underworld crime figures Manny Kimmel and Abner Zwillman, and added an office cleaning business (which was jointly owned by the funeral home and a cousin of his father-in-law). Kinney was taken public in 1962 with a market valuation of $12.5 million. In 1964, Kinney purchased wood flooring manufacturer Circle Floor from Seymour and Paul Milstein for $15 million with Paul remaining as manager of the unit until 1971.New York Times: \\"Milstein Opens Throttle as Builder\\" October 18, 1981 Ross served as company president and moved the firm from downtown New York to 10 Rockefeller Plaza. In 1966, Kinney expanded into the entertainment business by purchasing the Ashley- Famous talent agency (founded by Ted Ashley) and then in 1969, Kinney paid $400 million for the ailing Warner Bros.-Seven Arts film studio and record business. Three years later, after spinning off its non-entertainment assets, Kinney National Services renamed itself Warner Communications with Ross serving as co-CEO from 1969 to 1972. =Warner Communications/Time Warner= In 1971, Warner expanded into the cable television business by purchasing various small cable companies. Ross competed directly with the Big Three television networks that dominated television broadcasting, believing in the potential of narrowcasting whereby separate cable channels were developed to target specific audiences with narrower interests, mirroring the radio station model. This pioneering approach led to the creation of the successful cable TV channels MTV and Nickelodeon which were both later sold at a great profit. In 1972, Ross was appointed CEO, president and chairman of Warner Communications. He introduced an incentive-based compensation program and delegated responsibility to his middle managers. His support and commitment to his employees, combined with lucrative financial incentives and a hands-off management style, inspired deep loyalty. Many employees saw him as a father figure: \\"Steve was very much what I wish my father was,\\" Steven Spielberg said. Spielberg dedicated his 1993 film Schindler's List to Ross. In 1976, Warner Communications purchased Atari, Inc. and had great success with its Atari 2600 consoles. In 1983, Atari collapsed, leaving Warner Communications vulnerable to a hostile takeover. Rupert Murdoch tried to buy Warner, but Ross was able to impede him by selling 20 percent of Warner to Chris-Craft Industries (then controlled by Herbert J. Siegel). In 1979, needing financing to further expand its cable television business, Ross partnered with American Express, convincing its executives on the potential of selling AmEx credit cards direct to Warner cable TV customers. Warner-AmEx Cable was established and Warner received a much needed capital injection. AmEx's cross-sale expectations never materialized and in 1984, Warner bought out American Express's remaining share. The cable TV business eventually became the cornerstone of the company until being spun off in 2009. In 1989, Warner Communications was merged with Time Inc. in a $14 billion deal creating the largest media and entertainment company at the time. The merger was seen as a perfect fit: Warner's business was 40 percent international while Time's business was 91% percent domestic; Warner had no magazines while Time had 23 titles; Warner had the world's largest record business while Time was not involved in music; and both were big in the capital intensive cable business where economies of scale mattered. Originally advertised as a combination of equals with both Ross and J. Richard Munro of Time Inc. listed as Co-Chief Operating Officers, within a year of the merger, Ross became the sole CEO. By 1989, Time Warner owned Time, People and Sports Illustrated magazines (the three largest advertising draws in American publishing); the Warner Bros. studio in Hollywood; the Warner, Atlantic, Elektra and Asylum record companies; Warner Books; DC Comics; Home Box Office and some of the country's largest cable television systems. Visionary Ross moved before many of his competitors to bet heavily on the worldwide potential of cable television, records, videos, and other experiments. Some of his ideas were successful and others failed, but he definitively influenced the development of media and entertainment with his ideas. \\"If you're not a risk-taker,\\" he once said, \\"you should get the hell out of business.\\" Ross's early interest in cable television helped him envision narrowcasting—cable channels created for specific audiences—MTV and Nickelodeon were expressly launched and developed to serve young audiences. Today, these two channels are still successful, and the cable television universe is now filled with hundreds of channels, specializing in many topics. Other projects that Ross supported were not as successful as MTV and Nickelodeon, but certainly left a mark in television and helped shape the TV we are enjoying today. One important project was QUBE. Qube was launched in 1977 in Columbus, Ohio and was Ross' vision of how television could become interactive. Although this trial was not successful, it was an important step for what became known as advanced television. In some ways, the Qube project failed because it was ahead of its time. QUBE led to further attempts by Warner to integrate more services to cable television. Prominent among these was the Full Service Network that was launched in 1994 in Orlando, Florida. Ross also supported Atari from 1977 to 1983, taking the first widely successful video game console to millions of homes around the world. For several years, Atari was a lucrative business for Warner Communications, but in 1983 it collapsed. Although many of Ross' overly ambitious projects failed, some of these failures shaped future success in the video game and cable industries. Soccer Ross is also known for promoting and popularizing soccer in the USA. He was amongst the group of people that founded New York Cosmos in 1971. Driven by Ross's vision and financially backed by his Warner Communications, the club brought soccer superstars Pelé and Franz Beckenbauer, as well as other prominent players such as Carlos Alberto, Vladislav Bogićević, Johan Neeskens, and Giorgio Chinaglia. Ross was introduced to the sport during the late 1960s by one of his business executives Nesuhi Ertegun from Atlantic Records, the record company co-founded by Nesuhi's brother and also soccer enthusiast Ahmet Ertegun. The two brothers worked for Ross in the early 1970s after Atlantic got bought in 1967 by Warner Bros.-Seven Arts that in turn got bought by Ross's Kinney National Company two years later. When Nesuhi Ertegun had a business opportunity that would require leaving the company, Ross offered anything in an attempt to keep him. Ertegun expressed a desire to have a soccer club created and Ross, a fan of sports in general, obliged. Following 1970 FIFA World Cup in Mexico, the event that Erteguns used to further establish contacts in the soccer world by throwing lavish parties one of which was attended by Pelé, the brothers came back to New York and held Ross to his promise so he and longtime associate Jay Emmett called and convinced eight other executives to contribute $35,000 each towards establishing a new soccer franchise that would compete in the struggling North American Soccer League. =Founding the New York Cosmos= The franchise called the New York Cosmos was created in early 1971 with Englishman Clive Toye as its first general manager and 37-year-old Gordon Bradley as the player/coach. Playing out their debut season in almost empty stadiums with virtually no media coverage, the Cosmos were a rag-tag semi-professional operation, but most importantly Ross was hooked and very much interested to see the team do well. Scared of losing money, the ten original investors sold their stake in the franchise to newly created Warner Communications (the company where Ross was CEO and chairman) for $1. Essentially, with the sale, Ross added the modest franchise to the vast media empire he was in charge of running. =Bringing Pelé to America= Following the first few seasons in obscurity, Ross decided that signing a big marquee name was the way forward to achieving greater prominence and ultimately securing the league's long-term dream—a network television deal. The idea of bringing Pelé to America had actually been around for a while as NASL commissioner Phil Woosnam and eventual Cosmos GM Clive Toye discussed it as far back as 1970 and even made an approach to the player in spring 1971, one month after the Cosmos had been formed. However, in 1975 with Ross willing to spend the big money, conditions were finally there to make the dream transfer happen. He sent Emmett, Toye, Cosmos vice-president Raphael de la Sierra, and Nesuhi Ertegun to Brazil where they met with 34-year-old Pelé at a seaside resort and played soccer with him on the beach. Since by this time Real Madrid and Juventus also started sniffing around Pelé in an attempt to bring him to Europe for the first time, the Cosmos delegation used the possibility of making soccer big in a country new to the sport as their main lure and by the end of the day, the Brazilian agreed in principle to come to New York. The actual negotiation with Warner Communications lawyer Norman Samnick, who was deployed to Brazil by Ross, turned out to be a little more difficult: Ross was willing to risk $2 million for three years of play while Pelé demanded $5 million for two years. In the end, the deal agreed was a complex five-part contract worth around $4.5 million in total that included $1 million for three years of play, $1 million for ten years of marketing rights, $1 million for a fourteen-year PR contract, and another $1 million for a music contract. Warner Communications money thus managed to lure arguably then still the biggest name in soccer out of retirement. In addition to huge amounts of money, due to Pelé's special status in Brazil as the country's national treasure, getting him to leave his homeland for the first time in his career involved a lot of politics as well, especially when the Brazilian president demanded that Pelé play another year in Brazil for the \\"good of his people\\". Ross called on his political connections in an attempt to soften the Brazilian government's position and eventually managed to get to the US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who personally called his Brazilian counterpart telling him that Pelé's move to New York would be a huge step forward in the US–Brazil relations. Pelé's arrival created a media sensation and overnight transformed the fortunes of soccer in the USA. From the moment he signed his contract at the 21 Club on 10 June 1975 in front of ecstatic Ross and a crush of worldwide media, the player's every move was followed, bringing attention and credibility to the sport in America. His debut NASL match five days later versus Dallas Tornado at the dilapidated Downing Stadium on Randall's Island was broadcast live on CBS network. It was the Cosmos tenth match of the season and led by the Brazilian, who recorded an assist and a goal, they managed to come back from two goals down for the 2–2 final score. The contest was also Pelé's first competitive match in eight months since his last outing with Santos FC in October 1974. He would eventually end up with 5 goals in his debut season during which his biggest challenge became figuring out how to fit into this team of journeymen players with abilities far inferior to his. Still his biggest impact was on the sport in New York and the rest of America as Cosmos' home attendance got tripled in just half the season he was there. They also played in front of huge crowds on the road since everyone wanted to see Pelé - towards the end of the season when he pulled a hamstring and couldn't suit up, 20,000 fans in Philadelphia showed up just to see him in street clothes. Furthermore, the league's profile got raised as other NASL teams - encouraged by Ross' investment in Pelé and the prominence his arrival brought to the Cosmos franchise - started bringing over more big-name aging foreign stars such as George Best who was about to turn 30, 31-year-old Rodney Marsh, 34-year-old Geoff Hurst, and 35-year-old Bobby Moore. =More big names arrive in New York= Since the Cosmos failed to make the playoffs in Pelé's debut season, for the next season, Ross decided to complement his superstar with more prominent names from overseas, the biggest of which was 29-year-old temperamental Italian striker Giorgio Chinaglia from S.S. Lazio. The striker became an undeniable goal-scoring hit on the pitch with 19 goals in 19 league appearances that season, but his style of play as well as his egotistical and arrogant manner also got him many detractors both within and outside of the club. However, he endeared himself to Ross as the two soon became very close friends. Due to increased interest, the team moved to Yankee Stadium. Though the Brazilian midfield organizer and the Italian striker quickly developed an uneasy relationship, thanks to their assists and goals, respectively, the club managed to make the playoffs, losing to underdogs Tampa Bay Rowdies led by Rodney Marsh in the conference semifinal series 3 games to 1. Pelé still got the league MVP honors and Chinaglia became the league's top goalscorer. Though furious over the early playoff exit, Ross immediately took the team on an exhibition summer tour of Europe with stops to play friendly games in England, France, Belgium, Switzerland, and Italy. Though hugely expensive, the tour generated plenty of publicity for Warner Communications. The 1977 NASL season—Pelé's final season before retirement—began at the newly built Giants Stadium in New Jersey as New York Cosmos dropped \\"New York\\" from its name to become just the Cosmos. With the new giant home, Ross decided to Americanize the experience of going to a Cosmos game with cheerleaders, halftime show, and mascots. On the field, however, the squad got internationalized even further with a roster that had players from every corner of the world. Attendance rose slightly to just over 20,000 in the first five games (3 of which Cosmos lost), but still not enough to Ross' liking. In search of more people in the seats, Ross decided to raise the bar again. He reached for the chequebook midway through the season and looked oversees for more big stars, singing 31-year-old German superstar Franz Beckenbauer from Bayern Munich in May 1977. The German's debut was a 4–2 loss away at Tampa while the following week Cosmos beat Toronto at home in front of 31,000 fans. Ross was happy with the attendance increase, but wanted even more and to that end enlisted celebrities that did business with Warner Communications to make publicized appearances at Cosmos home games. People like Barbra Streisand, Mick Jagger, Phil Collins, Robert Redford, Muhammad Ali, Quincy Jones, Andy Warhol, Henry Kissinger, Steven Spielberg, etc. became a regular sight in the Cosmos locker room and in the luxury boxes at the Giants Stadium. Other changes were in order too as general manager Toye and head coach Bradley got fired and Tampa Bay's Eddie Firmani became the new coach. The team's striker Chinaglia was said to be the driving influence on Ross to hire Chinaglia's good friend Firmani as Chinaglia and Ross developed a personal relationship. Chinaglia thrived under Firmani, scoring goals one after another. The team's play as well as the attendance also started to pick up - led by Pele's hat-trick, the Cosmos finally managed to avenge the losses to Tampa Bay by beating them at home in front 62,394 fans. However, this was followed by another inexplicable dip in form with five losses in seven games. Ross reacted immediately, throwing more big money into the squad, signing Brazil national team's former inspirational captain defender Carlos Alberto who was about to turn 33 years of age. He joined the squad with only four games remaining in the 1977 regular season. By this time, the attendance was rising sharply as the team as well as the league started to catch major buzz. The summer of 1977 was the franchise's first true foray into big time: on 14 August, the Giants Stadium was sold out for the Cosmos first game of the playoffs against Fort Lauderdale Strikers with 77,691 people in the stands. The Cosmos finally won the title defeating Seattle Sounders in the Soccer Bowl during late August as Beckenbauer became league MVP and Pelé retired in style. =Heading US bid to host the 1986 FIFA World Cup= In November 1982, when Colombia, the originally selected host of the 1986 FIFA World Cup, gave up on organizing the event, for economic reasons, Ross called upon all his soccer connections and campaigned hard to bring the tournament to the US including meeting with FIFA president João Havelange, but in May 1983 FIFA decided on Mexico as the replacement host. The United States eventually hosted the World Cup in 1994. Personal life Ross was married three times: *In 1953 he married Carol Rosenthal, daughter of Edward Rosenthal. They divorced in 1978.

Located in western Lisbon, Alcântara is to the east of Ajuda and Belém and west of Estrela and Campo de Ourique. Alcântara had a population in 2011 of 13,943.Instituto Nacional de Estatística (INE), Census 2011 results according to the 2013 administrative division of Portugal History Primitive utensils from the Paleolithic era have been discovered on the margins of the Alcãntara ravine, and signs in the area of Alvito and Tapada da Ajuda indicate a level of occupation in the Neolithic and Chalcolithic periods. Around 1300, Bronze Age farmers and shepherds established small villages in this area, with a subsistence economy based on herding and the cultivation of cereal crops. During the Roman era, the local area was called Horta Navia in honour of the Roman divinity Nabia, a goddess of rivers and water. The area was notable for a Roman bridge across the Alcântara ravine The bridge was situated in a junction between the current Rua de Alcântara and Rua Prior do Crato, perpendicular to the current railstops at Alcântara-Terra to Alcântara-Mar. and, following the Muslim occupation, the area began to be referred to in terms of this bridge. The name Alcântara, derived from the Arab al-qantara (القنطارة) means bridge. =Medieval= Capela de Santo Amaro, built in 1549 by Diogo de Torralva. Battle of Alcântara, fought between António, Prior of Crato and forces loyal to Philip I of Portugal. After the Reconquista of Lisbon (1147), the area became integrated into the Reguengos de Ribamar that included terrain that extended from the Alcântara ravine to the Laje ravine in Oeiras. After the 13th century, the Reguengos was divided in two and the area of Alcântara was attributed, in gratitude by the King, to the nobility, religious orders or military. Yet, Alcântara became a battlefield in conflicts between Portugal and Castile, which included intrigues involving King Ferdinand and conflicts with the Kingdom of Castile after his death. In March 1382, an armada under the authority of John I of Castile entered the Tagus estuary, but was unable to crack the defenses; the force advanced inland attacking, sacking and stealing cattle. King Ferdinand made António, Prior of Crato, the frontier commander. Later, the death of King Sebastian at the Battle of Alcácer-Quibir resulted in a crisis in dynastic succession between António, Prior of Crato, Catherine, Duchess of Braganza and Phillip II of Spain. From a military perspective, in order to limit support for António's claim to the crown, Phillip II determined to invade Portugal and cement his own claim to the throne. Forces from Badajoz and a Spanish fleet from Cadiz crossed the Caia ravine on 28 June 1580, where they began their invasion. António, Prior of Crato, concentrated his defense in Alcântara along the Caia ravine, where a double line of defense supported 36 carracks and nine galleons. The Portuguese troops had a static defense and could not resist a flanking move, which resulted in the loss of the battle and of Portuguese independence for the next 60 years. In the 15th century, the rock quarries in Alcântara, which mined lime, contributed to the development of the locality (along with the ovens of Cais do Sodré), while orchards and vineyards along the ravines helped to diversify the regional economy. A hospital was constructed in 1520 in the garden of Jerónimo de Eça (Horta Navia) in order to combat the plague. Yet, the plague did not impede nobles from constructing estates along the Tagus; Alcântara was situated near the border of the parish of Ajuda, an extension of the nobility. A chapel dedicated to Santo Amaro was begun in 1549, and served as a sacristy for many of the pilgrims that crossed the territory. =Brigantine era= Burnay Palace, built in 1701, today part of the campus of the Technical University of Lisbon. Although today it is quite central, it was once an outlying suburb of Lisbon, comprising mostly farms and palaces. In the 16th century, there was a brook on which the nobles used to promenade in their boats. As a result of the 1755 earthquake and tsunami, the King and his government moved to the zone of Alcântara, attracting with them the nobility, functionaries, municipal officials and those that lived alongside them, including artists, merchants and artisans. The registries during this era were full of references to families of the upper and lower nobility who began to live in this zone alongside the socially deprived and poor that already existed. After the French invasions, agriculture and industry were paralyzed. The Liberal Wars that followed worsened these conditions along the eastern portions of Lisbon, principally along the ravine between Alcântara and Pedrouços. Still, the accentuated industrialization continued to dominate the valley and lasted until the late 19th century, resulting in many small factories and warehouses, including numerous metal-stampers and tanneries,.The tanneries were located in Santana, Vila Pouca, Horta Navia, Ribeira de Alcântara and Rua da Cascalheira, while the stampers were located in Quinta do Loureiro, Quinta da Várzea and Ponte de Alcântara. =Industrialization= The Instituto Superior de Agronomia, located in the Tapada da Ajuda, was founded in 1853. Between 1807 and 1824, members of the Ratton family constructed a porcelain factory in Calvario, and attempted to construct a mill powered by steam which was not successful. In 1839, the Rattons established an estate in Calvário alongside their Fábrica de Lanifícios Daupias de Pedro Daupias, which was under the management of Jácome Ratton. Near this factory, a textile factory, Companhia de Fiação de Tecidos Lisbonense, was also constructed (1846–1855). Since 1876, a great part of the urbanized part of Alcântara was delimited by Calçada da Tapada and Calçada de Santo Amaro in the north, and in the east and south by Rua de Alcântara, Largo do Calvário and Rua 1º de Maio. During the middle of the 19th century, some factories linked to chemical production (soap, candles, olive and other oils) were built in the same area, transforming the area of Calvário from an area of farms, palaces and convents into an important industrial zone. The industrial area south of Largo do Calvário and the old Rua de São Joaquim were converted and expanded to take on the new roles. Public transport developed after Lisbon in 1860, when the area had many factories. Yet, until 1888, these services were out of range of many of the working-class of the area. The improvements in public transit contributed to the development of the barrio of Alcântara. Pestana Palace, a luxury hotel housed in a noble palace built in 1905. On 2 April 1887, a railline between Alcântara-Terra and Sintra was inaugurated. Extending until the station at Alcântara-Mar, in 1891 the rail-line was completed after public sanitation works along the beach in Alcântara (1876), which resulted in the recovery of an additional 500 meters of land from the Tagus River, which were quickly expropriated by factories, docks and warehouses. Between 1884 and 1886, the barrios of Santo Amaro and Calvário began to develop as social housing, from lands reserved from the old Quinta da Ninfa. The lots were allocated to residents in commemoration of the 300 year anniversary of Luís Vaz de Camões. Santo Amaro Docks, former warehouses converted to commercial spaces in the 1990s. The precarious nature of the economic conditions in the region resulted in several conflicts, including many strikes, conflicts and insurrections, such as the June 1872 event, that came to be known as the \\"A Pavorosa\\". Later, the Empresa Industrial Portuguesa, the largest and most modern metallurgical business until the 1920s, operated in Alcântara, which also created dissent and conflict. On various occasions, in 1886, in 1894 and most importantly in 1903 there were strikes, protests and conflicts between the workers and the residents of the region. The 1903 strike began on 7 December to protest the imposition of a foreign director. On 17 December the strikers, numbering hundreds, fought the police in Santo Amaro. =20th century= Around the early 1990s, Alcântara started to become a place for pubs and discotheques, mainly because its outer area is mostly commercial, and the noise generated at night, and the \\"movida\\", would not disturb its residents. Today, some of these areas are slowly being taken over by loft developments and new apartments that can profit from its river views and central location.

The state requires all members of a particular economic sector to join an officially designated interest group. Such interest groups thus attain public status, and they participate in national policymaking. As a result, the state has great control over the groups, and groups have great control over their members. As with other political cultures, societies have existed historically which exemplified corporate statism, for instance as propounded by Othmar Spann (1878-1950) in Austria and implemented by Benito Mussolini (1883-1945) in Italy (1922-1943) and by António de Oliveira Salazar's Estado Novo in Portugal (1933-1974). Corporate statism most commonly manifests itself as a ruling party acting as a mediator between the workers, capitalists and other prominent state interests by institutionally incorporating them into the ruling mechanism. Corporatist systems were most prevalent in the mid-20th Century in Europe and later elsewhere in developing countries. According to this critique, interests, both social and economic, are so diverse that a state cannot possibly mediate between them effectively through incorporating them. Social conflicts go beyond incorporated dichotomies of labor and capital to include innumerable groups. Furthermore, globalization presents challenges, both social and economic, that a corporate state cannot sufficiently address because these problems transcend state borders and approaches. Corporate statism therefore differs from Corporate nationalism in that it is a social mode of organization rather than economic nationalism operating through private business corporations.

One of Australia's most renowned and successful painters, Pugh was strongly influenced by German Expressionism, and was known for his landscapes and portraiture. Important early group exhibitions include The Antipodeans, the exhibition for which Bernard Smith drafted a manifesto in support of Australian figurative painting, an exhibition in which Arthur Boyd, David Boyd, John Brack, Robert Dickerson, John Perceval and Charles Blackman showed; a joint exhibition with Barry Humphries, in which the two responded to Dadaism; and Group of Four at the Victorian Artists Society Gallery with Pugh, John Howley, Don Laycock and Lawrence Daws. Pugh was made an Officer of the Order of Australia in 1985 for service to Australian Art. In 1990 he was appointed as the Australian War Memorial's official artist at the 75th anniversary celebrations of the Gallipoli landing. Early life Pugh was born in Richmond, Victoria, one of three to an English-born Thomas Owen Pugh, an assistant mechanical engineer and Adeliade born wife Violet Odgen (Cook) Both Pugh's parents were amateur painters, and as a young man during the 1940s Pugh attended evening classes at the Swinburne Technical College to study cartoon drawing. Two years later whilst living in Adelaide he took evening classes in life drawing at the South Australian School of Arts and Crafts. Pugh served with the AIF in New Guinea during World War II and with the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan after the war. A group of Japanese soldiers surrendered to the unit with which Pugh was fighting during a lull in fighting. On receiving orders to proceed Pugh (and possibly others) tortured, shot and killed them. This incident and the guilt he felt affected his attitude to war (he became a pacifist) and his painting. Career After serving in World War II, with the financial support of the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Training Scheme, Pugh returned to Melbourne and enrolled in the National Gallery of Victoria Art School. Pugh was heavily influenced by German Expressionism. He read Sheldon Cheney's The Story of Modern Art (1941) while recuperating in hospital in New Guinea during World War II. Pugh's primary influence was Wassily Kandinsky: \\"I can see Kandinsky in everything I do.\\" His training at the National Gallery School gave him a strong foundation in drawing and he learned the tonal painting technique, but when he took his teacher William (Bill) Dargie to see the first of Sidney Nolan's Kelly and Dargie's attitude was dismissive, Pugh left the school to develop his own ideas. In 1951 Pugh bought of bushland near Cottles Bridge, northeast of Melbourne, which he named Dunmoochin. Pugh at first camped on the site, then built a wattle-and-daub shack. Artists, potters and others also settled at the site. In order to protect and jointly control the area they formed the Dunmoochin Artists Co-operative with a constitution of 13 articles. It was not a commune in any sense of the word except that the titles were communally held. When the co-operative eventually disbanded each member took a section of the land. Artists who worked or resided at Dunmoochin have included Rick Amor, Frank Hodgkinson, John Howley, Helen Laycock, Peter Laycock, Mirka Mora, Kevin Nolan, John Olsen, John Perceval, Alma Shanahan, Albert Tucker, Frank Werther, Fred Williams and Peter and Chris Wiseman. Pugh travelled across the Nullarbor Plain to Perth in 1954 then the Kimberley in 1956. These journeys led to radical changes in his style. Pugh encountered indigenous Australian art for the first time and began utilizing incision, cross-hatching and collage. The work inspired by these journeys was part of the Group of Four Exhibits in 1955 and 1956. In 1959 Pugh wrote to Bernard Smith: Close observation of nature and its cyclical and savage rhythms became a constant theme in Pugh's painting. The Hon E.G. Whitlam (1972) Pugh held his first solo show in 1957 at the Victorian Artists Society Gallery, where he displayed landscapes and portraits. The show was well received by critics. Col. Aubrey Gibson, chairman of the National Gallery, was an early patron, as were a group of businessmen led by David Yencken and the businessman Andrew Grimwade. Pugh joined the stable of the Sydney art dealer Rudy Komon. Komon paid his artists a stipend, balanced against sales of their work, and this generosity made them very loyal, as it gave them stability and freedom from daily money worries. Pugh had consistent official support in the crucial early stages of his career. His inclusion in the 1961 Whitechapel and 1963 Tate exhibitions of Australian art gave him international exposure. In 1966 Komon arranged a one-man show for Pugh at the Artists' Guild Gallery in St Louis in the United States; The Commonwealth Institute staged a retrospective of his work in 1970. He was represented in London by Andre Kalman, who showed him in 1975, 1976, 1977 and 1979, and with the Athol Gallery on the Isle of Man. The Historic Memorials Committee bought his 1964 portrait of the Governor-General Lord De L'Isle and his 1972 portrait of Gough Whitlam. Pugh's fame as an artist grew in the 1970s following the print publication of two radio plays by Ivan Smith: Death of a Wombat and Dingo King, both of which featured Pugh's drawings and paintings. =Printmaker= Pugh worked with the printmaker Stanley Hayter for three months in Paris in 1970. He brought Hayter’s oil viscosity printing technique back to Australia the same year. Pugh and John Olsen purchased an etching press and operated it at Dunmoochin. In 1971 Pugh invited Frank Hodgkinson to move to Dunmoochin and Pugh's \\"enthusiasm proved to be a major stimulus for Hodgkinson's printmaking.\\" =Politics and art= Pugh chaired the Victorian ALP Arts Policy Committee from 1971, and Gough Whitlam appointed Pugh to the Australia Council for the Arts in 1973. Pugh made public his disagreements with Council chairman H C \\"Nugget\\" Coombes who refused to implement the policy Pugh and his fellow committee members had crafted and then taken through the processes of the Victorian and Federal ALP conferences to become official ALP arts policy. Pugh resigned from the Council in 1974. In 1981 as Whitlam launched Pugh's biography at Realities Gallery, he joked about having to make his speech in front of his nemesis Sir John Kerr in a controversial portrait painted by Pugh in 1975; \\"I'll have you know I had nothing to do with the placing of the exhibit.\\" =Protanope colour vision deficiency= Pugh's brother and grandnephew had protanope colour vision deficiency and it is probable that he did on biographical, gene pedigree inheritance and other grounds (such as failing the colour vision test when endeavouring to enlist in the Navy). Personal life Portrait of a Woman (Marlene Pugh) 1956, oil on hardboard Pugh married three times: to June Byford, Marlene Harvey and Judith Ley. Pugh had two sons with Marlene, Shane and Dailan. Pugh became a pacifist during World War II, while on active service, and retained this position during the Vietnam War. He joined the Labor Party to campaign for the end of Australia's involvement in that War. The marriage to Marlene ended in 1969, they divorced in 1971. In 1970 Pugh met Judith. He became very well known, as he and Judith used his status as a painter to improve that of the ALP. They did this in order to ensure the election of the ALP as Pugh was an anti war activist. They separated in 1980 and divorced in 1981. He lived for some years with Adriane Strampp, who trained as a painter. =Death and legacy= Pugh returned to painting full-time after his experience with the Australia Council, and despite suffering three heart attacks and minor ischaemic episodes, continued to paint and make prints until his fatal heart attack in 1990. Pugh established the Dunmoochin Foundation which now forms part of his legacy, and provides residences for artists in his bush property. Pugh also donated Dunmoochin land to the Victorian Conservation Trust (now Trust for Nature) in 1989. Two plants of national significance have been recorded on this land.

The term blowpipe refers to one of several tools used to direct streams of gases into any of several working media.  Blowpipes for torches  Diagram of a bellows-operated blowpipe, circa 1827, from A Practical Treatise on the Use of the Blowpipe If a stream or jet of air is directed through a flame, fuel air mixing is enhanced and the jet exiting the flame is intensely hot. Jewelers and glassblowers engaged in lampwork have used the blowpipe since ancient times, with the blast being powered by the user's lungs. For small work, mouth-blown blowpipes may be used with candle flames or alcohol lamps. Starting in the late 18th Century, blowpipes have been powered by mechanisms, initially bladders and bellows, but now blowers, compressors and compressed gas cylinders are commonplace. While blowing air is effective, blowing oxygen produces higher temperatures, and it is also practical to invert the roles of the gasses and blow fuel through air. Contemporary blowtorches and oxy-fuel welding and cutting torches can be considered to be modern developments of the blowpipe. Kit for blowpipe analysis Carl Osterland, Freiberg, c. 1870 In chemistry and mineralogy blowpipes have been used as scientific instruments for the analysis of small samples since about 1738, according to the accounts of Torbern Bergman. One Andreas Swab, a Swedish metallurgist and Counsellor of the College of Mines is credited with the first use of the blowpipe for 'pyrognostic operations', of which no record remains. The next person of eminence who used the blowpipe was Axel Fredrik Cronstedt, who put it to the purpose of the discrimination of minerals by means of fusible reagents.John Joseph Griffin (1827) A Practical Treatise on the Use of the Blowpipe via Google Books In 1770 an English translation of Cronstedt's work was made by Von Engestrom, annexed to which was a treatise on the blowpipe. Despite this opening, assay by blowpipe was for the time an occupation undertaken for the most part in Sweden. Bergman's use of the blowpipe outstripped all of his predecessors, and he widened its application from mineralogy to inorganic chemistry, giving rise to what may be regarded as a masterpiece of philosophical investigation, De Tubo Ferruminatorio, published in Vienna in 1779 (and translated into English in 1788). Bergman's assistant, Johan Gottlieb Gahn, is credited with improving the design and application of the blowpipe. Gahn travelled with a portable blowpipe, applying it to every kind of chemical and mineralogical enquiry, such as proving the presence of copper in the ashes of vegetables. Gahn published a Treatise on the Blowpipe, which was reprinted a number of times in contemporary chemistry textbooks. Jöns Jakob Berzelius worked with Gahn to ascertain in a systematic manner of the phenomena presented by different minerals when acted on by the blowpipe. He established, according to Griffin, the notion that the blowpipe was an instrument of indispensable utility, and his published work, later translated into English, was regarded as one of the most useful books on practical chemistry extant. The blowpipes of all of the foregoing blasted air into a flame. The blow pipe was used by the Egyptians at around 200 BCE and to today. Antoine Lavoisier is credited as the first to blow oxygen - of which he was co-discoverer - through a blowpipe to support the combustion of charcoal, in 1782. Others, such as Edward Daniel Clarke, employed hydrogen, and later mixed hydrogen and oxygen in the oxy-hydrogen blowpipe. The vastly increased temperatures, and the volatility of hydrogen- oxygen mixes drove on the development of the so-called gas blowpipe as a tool, and at the same time brought many new materials into reach of the blowpipe as a tool for assay. Robert Hare was a noted exponent of the improved tool. Goldsworthy Gurney, whilst at the Surrey Institute, published in 1823 an account of a new blowpipe so constructed as to enable the operator to produce a flame of great size, power and brilliancy by burning large quantities of the mixed gases with the utmost safety. Gurney went on to employ the principles in his Bude light. Blowpipes in glassblowing In glassblowing, the term blowpipe refers to a pipe used to blow a bubble of air into a gather of molten glass, as the first step in the creation of hand-blown glass bottles and bowls. By the end of the first century, the two primary glassblowing tools were the iron blowpipe and pontil.F, Marianne Stern, Oxford handbook of engineering and technology in the Classical world, John Peter Oleson, ed., Oxford University Press, 2008. See page 536. Glassblowing blowpipes are long enough to keep the gather of molten glass at a safe distance from the glassblower, and rigid enough to support the weight of the glass when the pipe is held horizontally. Blowpipes in ironmaking The term blowpipe is also used to refer to the pipe used to blow deliver air to the tuyeres of a forge or blast furnace.Amit Chatterjee, et al, Metallics for Steelmaking -- Production and Use, Allied Publishers, 2001. See page 82. The blowpipe of a forge may be considered to be a large bellows operated version of a mouth- blown blowpipe, directing air through a coal or charcoal flame. Blowpipes for fireplaces or outdoor fires Blowpipes are also known as blow pokers (or just blow pokes). They are used to start and stoke fires. Blowpipes are straight, tube-like tools primarily used to direct oxygen to boost a wooden fire. Blowpipes have been in use for hundreds of years, but were first documented by John Griffin in his 1827 book A Practical Treatise on the Use of the Blowpipe. Blow pokers are multifunctional fire irons. Primarily they are used to arrange the embers or firewood in a wood fire (the poker), secondarily they are used as a blow pipe. The term \\"BlowPoker\\" was introduced in 2005 by the German company Red Anvil GmbH, a manufacturer of fire irons and fireside accessories. Their BlowPoker also has a plate to arrange the ashes. Since 2005 the term blow poker has established itself in the trade as a generic term for a multifunctional poker tool.

The design is incised into the matrix, which is used to create punches.

It is a medieval walled town northeast of Lyon. It is perched on a small hill that overlooks the plain of the Ain River. History Pérouges was inhabited by craftsmen; mainly farmers and linen weavers. It was probably founded by a Gallic colony returning from Perugia in Italy. In 1167, the Seigneur d'Anthon famously shut the commune's walls against the troops of the Archbishop of Lyon, and as early as 1236 the inhabitants earned communal freedom. In 1601 the town officially became French. Until the end of the 18th century, the textile industry in Pérouges boomed. In the 19th century, however, roads and railroads were re-routed and the population dropped from 1,500 to 90.Green Guide Auvergne, Rhône Valley, page 208, Michelin et Cie, 1995, But, starting in 1911, the town was restored and houses were saved. Today, Pérouges is a popular tourist attraction.  Origin  According to the archaeological findings, humans have been present at Pérouges since the Chalcolithic (about –2500 to –1800) age. There is no date for the construction of the fortress itself, but its first written mention appears in 12th century, therefore it is assumed to be built in that period. Although the town has been attacked by French soldiers on multiple occasions, it still prospered, due to its location and proximity to the trade routes. The town is located between Lyon and Geneva, which was one of the active local trade routes, therefore, craftsmanship and trade in the region flourished. The area officially became part of France under the rule of Henri IV in 1601. PopulationFilms set in Pérouges Given its authentic historical appearance, Pérouges is often used as the setting for period films by French directors and others. Films set in Pérouges are: * Monsieur Vincent Fr:(1947) * Les trois mousquetaires Fr:(1961) * Mandrin * Fanfan la Tulipe Fr:(1962) * The Bride Br:(1985) * The Hour of the Pig Br:(1993) Cultural events A spring festival has been held annually between April and June and hosts musical events ranging from Baroque to jazz.

In the , Victoria Point had a population of 15,020 people.  Geography  Victoria Point is approximately south-east of Brisbane, the capital city of Queensland. It is primarily a residential area, but it also contains other public complexes and a ferry service to Coochiemudlo Island.  History  Redland Bay Provisional School opened on 13 November 1877 and in 1880 was renamed Victoria Point Provisional School. When a separate Redland Bay Provisional School opened on 14 December 1881, the two school operated on a half-time basis, sharing a teacher between them until Victoria Point Provisional School became a full time school again with its own teacher on 15 May 1882. In 1916 a new school building was built on a new site and it opened as Victoria Point State School. St Anne's Anglican Church was dedicated circa 1963. It closed circa 1988. Redlands Luthern Primary School (also known as Faith Primary School) opened on 24 January 1982 on land in Link Road, donated by Wally Hauser. It was established by three Lutheran congregations from Cleveland, Redland Bay and Mount Cotton. There were 64 students in Years 1 to 4 and 3 teachers in the school's first year, expanding to offering Years 1 to 7 by the school's third year of operation. The primary school had expected to become a feeder school to the Redeemer Lutheran College, but when that was not possible, it was decided to expand the school to also offer secondary education. Land on Beveridge Road in Thornlands was purchased and the secondary campus of the renamed Faith Lutheran College, Redlands opened on 28 January 2003. The first group of Year 12s graduated in November 2007. In 1993 St Rita's Catholic Primary School opened in the tradition of the Augustinian Fathers offering preschool to Year 2 and attracted 92 students. Victoria Point State High School opened on 28 January 1997. The Victoria Point public library opened in 2006.

Eprapah Creek separates Victoria Point to the north from the next suburb of Thornlands. The headland has two boat ramps for boat entry to Moreton Bay and a Volunteer Marine Rescue unit. Beach areas include Thompson's Beach, a small child safe beach which has a very shallow slope allowing a long tide. Shopping facilities have expanded rapidly in the last few years, with now four supermarkets, cinema complex and many specialty shops and lakeside restaurants. The Redland City Council operates a public library at Lakeside Shopping Centre, 7-15 Bunker Road. It also operates a mobile library service which visits Boat Street.

Early life Duff was born at Fetteresso Castle, Stonehaven, Kincardineshire, son of Arthur Duff (grandson of Robert Duff) and his wife Elizabeth Innes, daughter of John Innes of Kincardine. He was educated at Blackheath School, London. He entered the Royal Navy in 1848, and was made a commander in 1865.Debretts House of Commons and the Judicial Bench 1870 He was a Deputy Lieutenant and J.P. for Banffshire (from April 1894) and Kincardineshire (from January 1900).

His term of office was chiefly marked by his permitting the premier, Sir George Dibbs, to obtain the prorogation of parliament on 8 December 1893, after that minister had incurred a vote of censure. In July 1894, after his ministry had failed to carry the general election, Dibbs desired Duff to nominate several persons to the legislative council on his recommendation. Duff declined to accede to his wish on the ground that the ministry had been condemned by the colony, and in consequence Dibbs and his colleagues resigned.

Background \\"Town and Country\\" was Humble Pie's second studio album, released in November 1969 in the UK only. Conceived at Steve Marriott's 16th-century rural cottage \\"Arkesden\\" in Moreton, Essex, England, \\"Town and Country\\" offered a different, more sensitive pastoral approach from the more straightforward \\"heavy\\" progressive sound prevalent on their debut album, which had been released a mere two months earlier. Like the band's early live shows, which opened with an acoustic set before returning with electric guitars in the second half of the show, \\"Town and Country\\" displayed an eclectic mix of acoustic ballads, country-rock, folk and blues, with a couple of hard rock songs to balance things out. Unlike the debut LP, all four members of the band contributed solo compositions to the album. Musically, Peter Frampton contributed acoustic, Spanish, and lead guitars, Steve Marriott played guitar, sitar, percussion and keyboards, and took a rare turn on bass. Bassist Greg Ridley also contributed guitar and tambourine, while Jerry Shirley handled not only his drum kit, but added a percussion saw on the first cut, as well as tambourine, tablas, maracas, and Wurlitzer piano on his own composition \\"Cold Lady\\". Amongst the more memorable Marriott- composed tracks were his country rock-flavoured compositions of contrasting mood, \\"Every Mother's Son\\", \\"The Sad Bag Of Shakey Jake\\" and \\"Down Home Again\\". Frampton's delicate but atmospheric lead guitar work throughout the album is also worthy of note and his compositions \\"Take Me Back\\", \\"Only You Can See\\" and \\"Home and Away\\" (a nominal co-write with Marriott and Ridley) nod vigorously in the direction he would take in his later solo career. The album also included a driving but tasteful cover of the classic Buddy Holly song \\"Heartbeat\\". The album was produced by Andy Johns at Olympic Studios. Johns was the younger brother of famed producer Glyn Johns who himself had a previous production association with Marriott. Most, if not all, of the material on the album dated back to recordings in the spring and early summer of 1969, when the band recorded as much as three albums' worth of material (the remaining recordings were eventually compiled and released in 1999 on the bands' \\"The Immediate Years: Natural Born Boogie\\" collection). While the band toured exhaustively for the last half of the year to hone their onstage skills and generate interest with the record-buying public, their record label Immediate Records was on the verge of financial collapse. Immediate rush- released the album into UK record shops in November of 1969, hoping it would enter the charts before the company went bankrupt. With no budget to promote it, however, the album quickly sank without a trace despite any artistic merits it may have had. The LP wasn't released at all in the US at the time even though the band was currently on their first American tour, but it still managed to garner favourable attention on underground FM radio stations. As a result, the album bolstered the group's reputation despite its lack of availability, the record company's imminent collapse, and disappointing sales. After this album, Humble Pie returned to what would become their trademark \\"heavy\\" sound, and concentrated their efforts on breaking into the US market. Following Frampton's departure in 1971, the band would continue in the \\"boogie rock\\" vein until the remaining and replacement members disbanded in 1975.

UNSW Asia was the first foreign university and fifth university in Singapore. On 23 May 2007, UNSW Asia Singapore campus announced its planned closure on 28 June 2007, at the end of the first semester due to financial issues and lower than expected student numbers.Channelnewsasia.com As a result of the sudden closure, rifts within the UNSW management were publicised, and accusations were exchanged between the University and the Economic Development Board.Channelnewsasia.com Questions were raised over the Economic Development Board's role in bringing in potentially over-ambitious business plans.Channelnewsasia.com The Singapore government's total loans to the university amounting to S$32 million was also revealed.Channelnewsasia.com The University is expected to repay all loans, and will have to restore the land for its campus to its original state, potentially incurring further costs.Channelnewsasia.com Announcement of Closure UNSW announced its closure on 23 May 2007. It was reported that the closure was due to its low student enrolment, causing the school to run into financial problems. The closure came despite the fact that UNSW had already invested over S$22 million (A$17.5 million) in its Singapore campus. Students who were enrolled at UNSW Asia were offered a place in an equivalent programme at UNSW Sydney. The students of the university petitioned against the closure of the Singapore campus. Together with the petition, they are asked for the S$140 million campus project at Changi to be abandoned to cut costs. They added they were happy with their current Kay Siang Road campus. Some said they did not mind paying their tuition fees in full to help the situation at the loss making campus. The petition was sent to the UNSW management in Sydney as well as the Ministry of Education and the Economic Development Board. Students felt the university should be given a chance and the university had a lot of potential in Singapore as well as being a force in the Asian education system. Local universities said they would admit affected students on a case-by-case basis. Scholarships were given to students to study in the UNSW Sydney campus with S$12,000 given to foreign students and S$22,000 to local students. Plans before ClosurePrograms and research= As a full university, UNSW Asia was to be an English-medium institution offering undergraduate, postgraduate and research programs across multiple disciplines grouped into the two clusters, namely science, engineering and health; and commerce and humanities. Six bachelor's degree programs were to be offered for undergraduates, namely those in science, engineering, commerce, international studies, design and media, and were to have corresponding honours courses. Undergraduates were to be able to pursue a single major or a double major program, which includes Science/Commerce, Science/Media, Science/International Studies, Commerce/International Studies, Commerce/Media, International Studies/Media, Engineering/Commerce and Engineering/International Studies. Other programs could have been added by the university in due course, such as those in medical sciences and health administration. Emphasis was to be made on research work with the establishment of research centres, and would have involved research programs funded and conducted by members of both the Asian and Australian campuses. UNSW Asia was to specialise in research relevant to the Asian region, however, and work closely with research and industry trends in Singapore. All degrees conferred by UNSW Asia were to be awarded by the University of New South Wales, and all academic programs of the Asian campus will be governed and treated on equal standing with those in the Australian campuses under the UNSW Council. =Students= UNSW Asia aimed to establish a high international profile by allocating at least 70% of its intake to non- Singaporeans. Applications open in January 2006 for the pioneering batch of about 500 to 600 students, and UNSW Asia began classes in March 2007. However, only 148 students were enrolled successfully. Prior to that, however, the university commenced a 40-week Foundation Studies program in January 2006 as an independent pre-university course for prospective students, including a course in the English language. Open to both Singaporeans and international students - though Singaporeans have to be above 18 and males need to complete National Service before enrolling, it initially offered courses in commerce and the physical sciences. Singaporean Students needed to have an aggregate score of below 20 for GCE 'O' Levels and a minimum of C6 for English Language. Successful completion of the course would guarantee a place in UNSW Asia, although they may also apply to enter the Australian campuses. The university expected to have a full student population of about 15,000 after 15 to 20 years. =Campus= A site in Changi was allocated for the building of the university's permanent campus. The only university to be sited in the eastern part of Singapore, it is located between Upper Changi Road East and Changi South Avenue 1, sited next to the Changi Business Park and about 400 metres away from the Expo MRT station . The Campus can be seen on Google Maps below in the External Links. An international design competition was held to design the campus masterplan and the library building, with acclaimed Singapore-based Kerry Hill Architects winning the competition in an announcement on 28 June 2005 . Other finalists in the competition were Singapore-based WOHA, and three Australia-Singapore partnerships of FJMT/Architects 61; BVN/RSP Architects; and CM+/Geoff Malone International. Construction of the campus began in 2006, and the first buildings were scheduled be ready for occupation in late 2008, including the library, science/engineering building, academic/administrative building, teaching suites, research laboratories and sports facilities. While the campus was being built, the university commenced classes in 2007 at the former campus of the Republic Polytechnic at 1 Kay Siang Road in Tanglin . However, following the university's closure, the land was later allocated for Singapore's fourth publicly funded university.

Her mother emphasized the importance of education and urged Josefina to \\"Rely on yourself, be independent.\\" In 1938 when Fierro was 18 years old, she entered the University of California, Los Angeles. She planned to study medicine, but activism on behalf of the Mexican American community took up most of her time and effort. Fierro de Bright gave up her studies at UCLA to become an organizer, and her style was described by veteran longshoremen's leader Bert Corona as \\"gutsy, flamboyant, and tough\\".\\\\- Chicanas.com article - URL last accessed 2006-07-25 Aided by her husband John Bright, a Hollywood screenwriter and an activist himself, she began to lead boycotts of companies that did business in Mexican American communities but did not hire Mexican American workers. These activities brought her attention from a Mexican American group El Congreso de Pueblos de Habla Española (Spanish-speaking congress), which was formed in 1938. El Congreso was organizing Hispanic migrants to stand up for their rights. In 1939 El Congreso leaders asked Fierro de Bright to help them to establish a branch in Los Angeles which represented a major effort by the Mexican American generation of the time, to form a working class movement that was aimed at securing basic rights for all Mexican and Spanish speaking people in the United States.  Early life  Josefina Fierro had been involved in revolutionary activism from a young age. Her father had been an officer in “Pancho” Villa's revolutionary army, but it was her mother's passion for activism and commitment to helping others that most strongly influenced her life. Fierro had been raised by her mother, who had immigrated to the United States when Josefina was a baby. Because Josefina's mother's family were followers of the radical Mexican anarchist Ricardo Flores Magón, she had been taught to speak against injustice, to fight for what was right and to treat everyone with “dignity and respect”.  Personal Life and Activism  After high school graduation, Josefina Fierro decided to move to Los Angeles to live with an aunt; there she met and fell in love with Hollywood actor John Bright. Bright, who was blacklisted with several other actors in Hollywood due to allegations of having ties with the Communist Party, inspired Fierro's activism further. After marrying Bright, Josefina found herself in the midst of a campaign that defended Mexican immigrants and Mexican American rights against discrimination during the 1930s. In 1938, at the age of eighteen, Fierro de Bright, who would become executive secretary, collaborated with Luisa Moreno and founded El Congreso de Pueblos de Habla Española, a Mexican civil rights organization that worked to fight for civil rights of Mexican immigrants and Mexican Americans and worker rights as well Fierro de Bright took her and her husband's platform to Hollywood and used it to fund-raise revenue for El Congreso. The networking that she made in Hollywood, brought in actors and other celebrities to help raise the revenue for the organization. Fierro de Bright, with Luisa Moreno, actively worked on issues that targeted the needs of lower-income and non-bilingual Mexicans to help them receive basic civil rights in the United States. Although El Congreso did not last very long, Fierro de Bright's activism did not end with its dissolution. In 1942, during the “Sleepy Lagoon” trial, after receiving complaints of cruel punishment from parents of the boys held in custody, Fierro de Bright organized a committee for the defendants. The committee became known as the Sleepy Lagoon Defense Committee, and raised money so that those on trial could hire a lawyer to represent and defend them. Fierro de Bright was in Los Angeles in 1943 at the start of the Zoot Suit Riots. She said of the violence, \\"I never believed that I could see a thing like that... I went downtown and my husband and I were standing there and we saw all these policemen hanging around... and hundreds of taxis with sailors hanging on with clubs in their hands, bullies just beating Mexicans on Main Street. And we went up and asked a cop to stop it: he says, 'You better shut up or I'll do the same to you.' You can't do a thing when you see people and the ambulances coming to pick them up and nobody is stopping the slaughter. It's a nightmare. It's a terrible thing to see.\\"  Notes  References  *Mexican Americans (pg 145-46,147) (1990) Mario T. García *From Out Of The Shadows (pg 96-98) (1998) Vicki L.

A third line, the City Line, is not owned or operated by Merseyrail, however stations inside Merseytravel's area are branded as Merseyrail. All three lines are funded by Merseytravel. The Northern Line is a north-south crossrail line running through Liverpool's city centre, from Hunts Cross in the south to three termini in the north at: Southport, Ormskirk and Kirkby. The Northern line passes underground through Liverpool's city centre with termini at: * to the south; * , * , and * to the north. Passenger interchange to the Wirral Line is available at Moorfields and Liverpool Central, and to the City Line at Hunts Cross and (including regional and long-distance services) Liverpool South Parkway.  Description  The line runs from Hunts Cross in the south of Liverpool towards Liverpool Central. Brunswick station between and Liverpool Central was added in 1998 to provide a connection to the Brunswick Business Park. In the tunnel just south of Liverpool Central, the line drops into a 1970s tunnel to a lower level into the underground Mersey Railway Liverpool Central (Low Level) station. North of Central the line uses the Mersey Railway tunnel for about half of the route to Moorfields, an underground station built in the 1970s to replace the surface-level Liverpool Exchange. North of Moorfields the route emerges from the tunnel to join the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway lines from the former Exchange station. After Sandhills, the Liverpool, Crosby and Southport Railway branches off towards Southport, while the other routes continue to Kirkdale on what was a joint section of track between Liverpool, Ormskirk and Preston Railway and the Liverpool and Bury Railway. After Kirkdale, the Ormskirk and Kirkby lines diverge. Trains from Hunts Cross continue to Southport, while trains to Ormskirk and Kirkby start at Liverpool Central. Daytime trains operate every 15 minutes on each of the three routes Monday to Saturday daytime and every 30 minutes evenings and Sundays. Summer Sunday frequencies on the Southport route used to be increased to every 15 minutes but this practice ended in 2017. There are no peak hour frequency increases but trains on the Southport and Ormskirk routes are increased to six carriages, as are weekend services during the summer on the Southport route. Special timetables are implemented for major events such as Grand National Race Week at Aintree and golf tournaments at Birkdale. These involve changing services on all branches and even the closure of stations in anticipation of overcrowding risks.

Connections  Interchange with the Wirral line is available at and . As the Northern line does not pass through , passengers from other rail networks must use the Wirral line as a connection. As there is only a direct escalator down to the Wirral line towards Birkenhead at Liverpool Central and given the short distance between Central and Lime Street most passengers prefer to walk rather than use the several escalators necessary to travel between the two stations. Liverpool city centre stations have lifts for wheelchairs buggies and heavy luggage but they are small. Interchange with other National Rail services can be made at Southport, Ormskirk, Kirkby, Liverpool South Parkway and Hunts Cross. Liverpool South Parkway opened on 11 June 2006, replacing Garston and providing connections to the City Line formerly available at . Future Plans to re-open St James station have been proposed. Merseytravel agreed to work with Liverpool Vision in March 2014 to investigate the cost of re-opening the station and its projected usage. Merseytravel listed the re-opening of St James station as a 'top rail project' on a Rail Development and Delivery Committee report in 2016. As part of Lancashire County Council's plans to build a new railway station in Skelmersdale, they have proposed an extension to the Northern Line that would change the terminus of the Kirkby branch of the line from Kirkby to Skelmersdale. The proposals could see a new station built at Headbolt Lane and Merseyrail services also passing through Rainford railway station. By September 2017, Merseytravel and Lancashire County Council had committed £5 million of funding to the scheme. Merseytravel believe the scheme could cost around £300 million to develop and could be ready in a decade. Liverpool City Region Combined Authority, Long Term Rail Strategy document of October 2017, page 37, states a review in 2020 to introduce new Merseyrail battery trains will be undertaken, in view to put Preston onto the Merseyrail network by extending the Merseyrail Northern Line from Ormskirk to Preston. The aim is to have Preston one of the terminals of the Northern Line. The document states, \\"The potential use of battery powered Merseyrail units may improve the business case\\".

The Wirral line connects Liverpool to the Wirral Peninsula via the Mersey Railway Tunnel, with branches to New Brighton, West Kirby, Chester and Ellesmere Port. Beneath Liverpool, the line follows a clockwise circular route in a single- track tunnel called the Loop, built in the early 1970s. The line was created by the amalgamation of several historic railways, and has carried its present name since the opening of the Merseyrail network by Queen Elizabeth II on 25 October 1978 during the British Rail period. The Wirral line is fully electrified with a DC third rail, and has existed in its current form since May 1994 with the start of electric services to . A total of 34 stations are served, with connections available to mainline services at and . The line also connects with the Northern Line of the Merseyrail network at and . History The Wirral line was not originally conceived as a single route, but was built as several lines by individual private railway companies. Even after the Grouping Act of 1921, three of the Big Four companies were active on the Wirral Peninsula until the nationalisation of the railways in 1948 when all four were absorbed into British Railways. During the 1970s under British Rail, the Merseyrail network was developed and privatisation during the 1990s has resulted in services once again being run by private operators, now known as train operating companies. =Pre-grouping=Chester and Birkenhead Railway Part of the Chester and Birkenhead Railway forms the oldest section of today's Wirral line. The route between the two settlements was surveyed by George Stephenson in 1830, however the railway company itself was not incorporated until 12 July 1837 after a previous bill had been rejected a few months earlier. Between 1830 and 1837 an alternative route was surveyed by Francis Giles, but Stephenson's plans were favoured with construction work starting in May 1838 and allocated to three different contractors. By October 1839 over 900 navvies and 40 horses were employed on the southern of the route which included the construction of Mollington Viaduct over the Shropshire Union Canal at Moston, now Grade II listed, and in 2011 having recently undergone strengthening work at a cost of around £800,000. The total cost of the railway was around £513,000, more than double the original estimate of £250,000, and the full length of opened as a single track line on 23 September 1840 between temporary termini at Grange Lane in Birkenhead and Brook Street in Chester, close to the present location of Chester railway station. The inaugural service was operated by locomotive \\"The Wirral\\", taking 50 minutes to travel the length of the line from Birkenhead. In 1842 the company purchased Monks Ferry station and extended their railway north from Grange Lane to reach the new combined rail and ferry terminal, which opened on 23 October 1844. On 22 July 1847 the line was merged with the Birkenhead, Lancashire and Cheshire Railway into the Birkenhead, Lancashire and Cheshire Junction Railway who doubled the track. Chester General station opened a year later on 1 August 1848, still extant today as the southern terminus of the Wirral line and renamed to simply \\"Chester\\" in 1969 following the closure of Chester's other station, Chester Northgate. In 1859 the Birkenhead, Lancashire and Cheshire Junction Railway shortened its name to become the Birkenhead Railway, but was taken over in 1860 by the Great Western Railway (GWR) and the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) who operated the line as a joint affair known as the Birkenhead Joint Railway. Birkenhead Woodside station opened on 31 March 1878 as a new terminus to replace the facilities at Monks Ferry. To connect the new station to the railway, a tunnel was dug using the cut and cover method. Wirral Railway William Gladstone. On 28 July 1863 the Hoylake Railway was incorporated due to The Hoylake Railway Act being granted Royal Assent which authorised the construction of a railway line between Birkenhead and Hoylake. A single track line was constructed between and (adjacent to Wallasey Bridge Road), and the railway opened to passengers on 2 July 1866. The railway had ambitious plans that included the construction of a bridge across the Dee Estuary to join the LNWR North Wales Coast Line at Mostyn, but due to financial difficulties the company went into receivership on 13 February 1869. The railway was bought by the Hoylake and Birkenhead Tramway Company who passed a bill for a new tramway from the Bridge Road station to Woodside Ferry Terminal on 18 July 1872. The Hoylake Railway reopened on 1 August 1872 and in 1878 was extended to West Kirby to the west and an interchange with the tramway and the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board railway system to the east where Birkenhead Dock station had been built. The tramway was sold to the Birkenhead Tramways Company on 11 October 1879 which was already operating other tramways in Birkenhead. On 18 July 1881 the railway became the Seacombe, Hoylake & Deeside Railway Company and acts were passed for lines to , Deeside and Warren Drive, later extended to New Brighton. Before these extensions were complete the railway became the Wirral Railway Company and a decision was made to double the track as far as the western terminus at West Kirby. Whilst the new lines to Seacombe and New Brighton were being surveyed and built, a new joint company, later to become the North Wales and Liverpool Railway Company (NW&LR;), took over the construction of the Deeside line due to a lack of Wirral Railway funds. The planned NW&LR; route would pass through the heart of the Wirral Peninsula from on the Wirral Railway to in Flintshire, Wales where it would meet the Chester and Connah's Quay Railway and the Wrexham, Mold and Connah's Quay Railway (WM&CQR;). The North Wales and Liverpool Railway opened for passengers on 18 May 1896, but powers to extend the service from Bidston to the more appealing destination of Seacombe were not granted until 1898. The NW&LR; and WM&CQR; were both acquired by the Great Central Railway (GCR) on 1 January 1905, and due to a high level of goods traffic the GCR opened a new connection to the docks in 1907 as part of what forms the now-disused Birkenhead Dock Branch. Today the railway from Bidston to Hawarden Bridge forms the northern part of the Borderlands line which is the only railway line on the Wirral that does not form a part of the present-day Wirral line.

Mersey Railway electric multiple unit (EMU) having just departed from Birkenhead Park for Liverpool. The first proposal to connect Birkenhead and Liverpool by a rail tunnel was made in 1864 by the Liverpool and Birkenhead Railway Company. The bill received the support of the chairman of the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board and of John Laird, the Member of Parliament for Birkenhead at the time, although ultimately it was unsuccessful due to strong opposition from the LNWR. A second tunnel proposal was made in 1865 by Sir Charles Fox who planned to build a single track pneumatic railway under the Mersey between the two settlements. The Mersey Railway Act was passed in 1866 although the project was hindered with knowledge of engineering difficulties and limitations with pneumatic railways in other parts of the country. On 22 December 1869, Fox held a meeting with Liverpool businessmen and merchants where it was decided that the pneumatic single track railway would be substituted with a conventional steam double track line. Powers for the Mersey Railway Company to build a steam railway were granted in 1871 as well as those to extend the original planned route to connect with the joint Great Western and London and North Western railway at . A contract was made with John Dickson to raise the necessary funding and then construct the railway, but he soon became bankrupt. Work on constructing the tunnel did not commence until December 1879 when a preliminary contract was entered with Major Samuel Isaac, a London businessman, to dig a pilot tunnel for determining the nature of the strata beneath the Mersey. Isaac subcontracted the construction work to John Waddell & Sons of Edinburgh who appointed James Brunlees and Charles Douglas Fox, eldest son of Sir Charles Fox, as engineers in chief. Two shafts were dug in the grounds of the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board for the pilot tunnel - one in Birkenhead with a diameter of and the other in Liverpool of diameter . It was determined that there was an almost uninterrupted stratum of red sandstone beneath the river and as a result construction began in August 1881 before the pilot bore had been completed. A total of three tunnels were constructed — the main railway tunnel, a ventilation tunnel and a drainage tunnel. The railway tunnel was horseshoe shaped and bored to a width of and height of for two standard gauge tracks. With six layers of brickwork through sandstone and eight courses through clay, a total of around 38 million bricks were required. The drainage tunnel sloped down from the centre to pumping shafts on each side of the river each deep, lined with cast iron through water-bearing strata, and with a capacity of of water. Whilst water was encountered during the construction work, it was not a serious problem and the ground under the riverbanks was found to be wetter than that under the river itself. The ventilation tunnel is in diameter and was bored parallel to the main tunnel. In 1883 the rate of work was greatly improved with the deployment of a Beaumont Cutter which was a compressed air boring machine invented by Colonel Frederick Beaumont of the Royal Engineers. Liverpool Pumping Station was built adjacent to George's Dock and contained a pair of pumps connected to a steam engine. On the opposite bank of the river Shore Road Pumping Station was constructed in Birkenhead. The pumping plants were designed with the capacity to deal with up to four-times the amount of water that entered the drainage tunnel and subsequently the pumping shafts. Steam-driven ventilating fans were installed at James Street, Shore Road and midway between and . The fans combined could draw out of the tunnel of air per minute which meant a complete change of air in the tunnel every seven minutes. At the start of 1884 construction work was pushed ahead with 1400 men and 177 horses underground. On 17 January of the same year two tunnel headings met from the Birkenhead shaft. A ceremony marked this occasion with Henry Cecil Raikes PC, Major Isaac, Colonel Beaumont, James Brunlees, Charles Douglas Fox, Robert Paterson (Mayor of Birkenhead) and David Radcliffe (Mayor of Liverpool) present. The tunneling work was complete by the end of 1885 and thousands of members of the public took the opportunity to walk through the gaslit tunnel ahead of its official opening. King Edward VII, then Prince of Wales performed the opening ceremony on 20 January 1886 accompanied by Prince Albert Victor and Prince George, later to become King George V. All three had spent the previous night at Eaton Hall and travelled on the Royal Train between and Rock Ferry where the locomotive was swapped for a Mersey Railway 0-6-4 tank engine and a temporary connection to the Mersey Railway traversed ahead of the journey through the tunnel to Liverpool. At in the afternoon the Prince inaugurated the railway in James Street before attending a meal at Liverpool Town Hall. The first Mersey Railway passenger service ran ten days later on 1 February 1886. Around 36 thousand passengers travelled on the railway on the first day of service and 2.5 million passengers were carried during the first six months. Upon opening, the railway ran from James Street in Liverpool to Green Lane in Birkenhead via intermediate stations at and . A branch from Hamilton Square to opened on 2 January 1888 where it connected with the Seacombe, Hoylake & Deeside Railway, later to become the Wirral Railway. Once this extension was complete passengers were able to travel from Hoylake to Liverpool without changing trains as only the locomotives were changed for the Mersey Railway tunneled section. On 16 June 1891 an extension was opened from Green Lane to Rock Ferry for connections with the Birkenhead Joint Railway. A further extension opened in Liverpool on 11 January 1892 from James Street to increasing the total length of the railway to . This extension was tunneled using the cut and cover method due to a ban on the use of explosives in Liverpool city centre. Despite the four ventilation fans, passenger numbers on the railway declined due to the steam engines filling the air with smoke and soot. Coupled with the high cost of running the fans and drainage pumps, the railway found itself bankrupt by 1900. Not long afterwards, George Westinghouse, an engineer and inventor, offered to fund and carry out electrification work on the line. By the end of April 1903, and at a cost of £300,000, the electrification work was complete making the railway Britain's first steam-operated line to be converted to electric traction. A generating station adjacent to the pumping station on Shore Road was built and installed with three Westinghouse generators which provided 650 V DC to the fourth rail system. The last steam train departed Liverpool Central on 3 May 1903 at 12.26 am and electric operation commenced that afternoon after a long morning of driver training. Passenger numbers rose again after electrification and the Mersey Railway carried over nine million passengers the following year. To operate electric services 24 motor and 33 trailer carriages were constructed of Baldwin-Westinghouse design. They were long, of an American styling, and were manufactured at the Baldwin Locomotive Works in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Four additional trailer vehicles of the same design were built during 1908 by G. C. Milnes Voss & Company in Birkenhead. The electric Mersey Railway trains all used a multiple unit control system developed by Westinghouse which enabled trains with motor carriages at both ends to be driven from a single cab. From 1904, driving controls were also fitted to selected trailer vehicles which enabled trains to be divided into shorter units during quieter times, yet still be drivable from both ends. Additional vehicles were added to the fleet in 1925 and 1925, constructed by Cravens of Sheffield, and in 1936, built by the Gloucester Railway Carriage and Wagon Company. =The Big Four= A Railway Clearing House map of the railways in Birkenhead and Bidston prior to the 1923 grouping. The Railways Act 1921 took effect on 1 January 1923, when most railway companies in Britain were grouped into one of the Big Four. The Wirral Railway became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) company, while the GCR, which it met at Bidston, was absorbed into the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). The Birkenhead Joint Railway and the Mersey Railway were both unaffected by the grouping of 1923 and remained in existence until the nationalisation of the railways in 1948. The Wirral Railway had considered electrification since 1900, but plans were not taken any further until 1935, when increasing traffic prompted the LMS to revive the scheme. Authorisation was granted for the West Kirby and New Brighton lines, and work was completed by February 1938. The LMS had adopted a 650 V DC third-rail system which differed from the fourth-rail system of the Mersey Railway. To allow through services to run to Liverpool, all trains had to be able to operate with both systems, and automatic changeover devices were installed between each set of rails at Birkenhead Park. The LMS ordered nineteen three-car units to operate their new electric services, which were later to become the Class 503 under the TOPS numbering system. The vehicles were built in Birmingham by Metropolitan Cammell and the Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Company, and were maintained at Birkenhead Central TMD. Station improvement and modernisation work also accompanied the electrification work at , , , Moreton, and . With Mersey Railway trains able to use the LMS electrification system and vice versa, on 13 March 1938 the Mersey Railway was given operation of the line from Birkenhead Park to New Brighton in exchange for LMS running powers between Birkenhead Park and Liverpool Central, thus removing the need for passengers to change at Birkenhead Park for travel to Liverpool. The first direct services from West Kirby and New Brighton to Liverpool Central ran on 14 March 1938, the LMS operating the West Kirby services and the Mersey Railway running the New Brighton services. To keep LMS and Mersey Railway workers familiar with each other's routes, on Sundays the LMS worked the Rock Ferry services, and the Mersey Railway trains ran to West Kirby. The Mersey Railway also ran additional services to West Kirby on bank holidays to cater for day-trippers. During the Second World War, the Liverpool Blitz of 1940-1941 caused severe damage to the Mersey Railway. While overground services were disrupted on several occasions, underground services always continued, despite damage to station buildings. The explosion of a parachute mine just west of Birkenhead Park station demolished the carriage shed that was located there; damaged vehicles were sent to Wolverton works and extensively rebuilt. The importance of a rail connection between Liverpool and Birkenhead during the war was such that four redundant six-car trains from the Hammersmith & City line of the former Metropolitan Railway were reconditioned by the London Passenger Transport Board and transferred to temporary LMS ownership; however, these trains never saw passenger service on the Wirral, despite being stored at Birkenhead North and Hoylake. =British Railways= Nationalisation of the railways took place on 1 January 1948 under the Transport Act 1947. All lines on the Wirral, including the Mersey Railway, were absorbed into the London Midland Region of British Railways. At first, services continued as before, with trains from New Brighton and West Kirby to Liverpool Central, and services on the former Birkenhead Joint Railway from Birkenhead Woodside to destinations such as , Chester General, North Wales, West Kirby (via Hooton), , and Shrewsbury General. In 1955 the original Mersey Railway fourth-rail system was replaced with the third-rail system adopted by LMS from Birkenhead Park to New Brighton and West Kirby, removing the need for automatic changeover switches. Despite the design already being 19 years old at the time, a new batch of 28 third-rail-only Class 503 units was delivered the following year. Of these, 24 were ordered as replacements for the original Mersey Railway trains, and the remaining four to replace stock damaged during the Second World War. As each new train was placed in service, a Mersey Railway train was withdrawn and hauled by steam locomotive to Horwich Works for breaking up. In March 1963, Dr Beeching published his first report on the future of the railways, recommending the closure of one third of the country's railway stations, including Birkenhead Woodside. His second report, in February 1965, proposed 'trunk routes' between major cities, including the West Coast route between London and Liverpool/Manchester, which was then being electrified. Once Birkenhead to Birmingham and London services were replaced with electric trains from Liverpool Lime Street, only local diesel services to Chester and remained using Birkenhead Woodside, which closed to passengers on 5 November 1967. Local services were terminated at Rock Ferry where a change to Liverpool city centre was available. The development of Merseyrail Three Class 503 units at Rock Ferry in 1973. Trains to Liverpool terminated at James Street during this period while construction of the Loop Tunnel took place. Detail of the connections between the Loop Tunnel and the original Mersey Railway tunnel at James Street. Department of Transport requirement for rail stock used in tunnelled sections. The programme of route closures in the early 1960s, known as the Beeching Axe, included the closure of two of Liverpool's mainline terminal stations, and high-level in Liverpool, and also Birkenhead Woodside terminal Station. Riverside terminal station at the Pier Head was the fourth terminal station to close. This was not a part of the Beeching cuts: the demise of the trans-Atlantic liner trade forced its closure in 1971. The Beeching Report recommended that the suburban and outer-suburban commuter rail services into both Exchange and Central High-level stations be terminated and that long and medium-distance routes be concentrated on Lime Street station. Liverpool City Council took a different view, and proposed the retention of the suburban services and their integration into a regional rapid-transit network. This approach was backed up by the Merseyside Area Land Use and Transportation Study, the MALTS report. Liverpool City Council's proposal was adopted and Merseyrail was born.\\"Liverpool City Centre Plan - City Centre Planning Group, 1965\\" The Merseyside Passenger Transport Authority, later named Merseytravel, was formed in 1969 with representatives from all Merseyside local authorities taking responsibility for the local rail network, henceforth known as 'Merseyrail'. At that time, the lines out of Liverpool Exchange, Liverpool Central Low Level and Liverpool Lime Street stations were completely separate and were given the names of 'Northern line', 'Wirral line' and 'City Line' respectively. The new Wirral line was to have a loop tunnel under Liverpool's city centre which would be an extension of the Mersey Railway tunnel. This arrangement meant trains would only terminate in the Wirral. Trains would leave Wirral terminus stations, run into Liverpool's city centre and loop back out. Four underground stations would be on this loop under Liverpool's city centre. A further underground Link Tunnel connection between a new Moorfields through underground station and underground creating a Liverpool north-south crossrail was planned. Moorfields would replace terminus station. The Mersey Railway Extensions Act was passed in 1968 to authorise the first stage of these improvements. The Transport Act 1968 established the Merseyside Passenger Transport Authority to control policy on public transport in the conurbation, and the Merseyside Passenger Transport Executive to manage ferry services and to make agreements with the National Bus Company and British Railways Board. The one track Loop Tunnel was designed to allow trains to run in a clockwise direction beneath Liverpool's city centre. It diverged from the Mersey Railway tunnel beneath Mann Island extending the short Huskisson Dock branch tunnel. This short tunnel was designed to extend to Huskinson Dock for freight purposes, however the works never materialized. A new platform was built at James Street. From James Street the tunnel continued to new deep-level platforms at , and before rejoining the existing Mersey Railway tunnel beneath the Queen Victoria monument to allow trains to continue serving one of the existing platforms at James Street. The existing 1886 tunnel from James Street to Liverpool central was relegated to shunting purposes. The Loop is a single-track tunnel, in length, in diameter, and was driven during 1972 and 1973 through mainly sandstone rock. The depth of the tunnel varies between and lined with concrete. To bore the tunnel, three new DOSCO electro-hydraulic excavating machines were used, giving a maximum work rate of per week. In addition to the construction of the Loop Tunnel, a burrowing junction was constructed at , taking the line towards Birkenhead Park beneath the Rock Ferry lines. This would allow peak-time frequencies to be increased by removing interfering train paths at the flat crossing. A new platform was built at Hamiton Square for this diversion, and the new tunnel is in length. In 1974, Merseyside was created, with Merseyside County Council taking over the responsibilities of the Merseyside Passenger Transport Authority. The Northern line, including the new Link Tunnel between Moorfields and the original Mersey Railway platforms at Liverpool Central, was opened to passengers on 2 May 1977 and the Loop Tunnel opened a week later with Wirral line trains serving Rock Ferry, New Brighton and West Kirby. The first phase of the Merseyrail development was formally opened by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II on 25 October 1978, when she visited Liverpool Central station and rode to on the Northern line. To operate the new Merseyrail services, procurement of new stock began for the Wirral line. Following extensive testing of PEP stock, 43 Class 508 units were ordered and constructed at BREL York during 1979-1980. Due to a stock shortage in the Southern Region, the new four-car trains were first introduced to operate inner-suburban services from . This allowed the few remaining 4-SUB trains to be withdrawn so that their electrical equipment could be reclaimed for the new Class 455 units. In 1981, the first two Class 508 units were sent north to Birkenhead, and three more were transferred in February 1983 as Class 455s began to enter service. The new Class 455/7 units were originally specified as having four vehicles, but they were delivered with only three vehicles as it was decided that one trailer would be removed from each Class 508 unit before being sent north to Birkenhead. The remaining Class 508 units were reduced to three carriages and delivered to Birkenhead by December 1984, allowing the Class 503 units to be withdrawn. In the early 1980s plans were made to extend the Wirral line from Rock Ferry to along the former Birkenhead Joint Railway route. Third-rail electrification work was carried out during 1985, and Hooton to Liverpool services started on 30 September that year, at a 15-minute frequency. Bromborough Rake station opened along the line to coincide with the introduction of electric services, and diesel multiple units provided onwards connections at Hooton to Helsby and Chester. Further electrification work to Chester and was planned to start in 1990. Electric services through to Liverpool from Chester commenced on 3 September 1993 and from Ellesmere Port on 29 May 1994. =Post-privatisation= The privatisation of British Rail began in 1994 and the Railways Act 1993 allowed separate parts of the railway to be transferred to the private sector. The Merseyrail network continued to operate as part of the Regional Railways sector of British Rail until 11 December 1996 when MTL was announced as the preferred bidder for the Merseyrail franchise. MTL ran the Merseyrail franchise as Merseyrail Electrics until 2000 when MTL was sold to Arriva by its shareholders and later rebranded as Arriva Trains Merseyside. The franchise was then run as Arriva Trains Merseyside. In 2003, Merseytravel took over responsibility for the Merseyrail franchise from the Strategic Rail Authority. In conjunction with this, on 20 July 2003, the franchise was awarded to Serco-NedRailways (now Serco-Abellio), a 50-50 joint business venture between Serco and Abellio, a subsidiary of Dutch national train operator Nederlandse Spoorwegen. Merseyrail Electrics 2002 Ltd was established by Serco-Abellio and the franchise is run under the \\"Merseyrail\\" brand with a 25-year contract ending in July 2028 and a review taking place every five years in line with the Merseyside Local Transport Plan. Infrastructure Merseyrail network map. =Track= The Wirral line is built to standard gauge. The majority of the track has a loading gauge of W6 and the line has a Route Availability (RA) of RA 8 except for the New Brighton branch which is RA 6. This makes the whole line fairly restrictive and not very attractive for freight traffic. In 2017, the track laid in the late 1970s which runs under the Mersey was replaced by Network Rail over a six-month period. =Electrification= The Wirral line is electrified using the 750 V DC third rail system. The Mersey Railway was electrified in 1903, making it the first railway in the world to be converted entirely to electrification. The former Wirral Railway, by then part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS), was electrified in 1938. The opening of the Loop in 1977 led to three electrified terminals on the Wirral: New Brighton, West Kirby and Rock Ferry. Electrification south from Rock Ferry to Hooton followed in 1985, with extensions to Chester and Ellesmere Port in 1993 and 1994 respectively. =Rolling stock= In 1938 following the electrification of the former Wirral Railway, the LMS introduced new trains with air-operated sliding doors. These electric multiple units were eventually designated as Class 503. Further Class 503 units were built in 1956 to replace the former Mersey Railway carriages. The entire Class 503 stock was replaced in 1983 with Class 508 units originally built in the late 1970s for services from . A few years earlier (1978-1980), almost identical Class 507 units had been introduced on the Northern line to replace Class 502 stock. Following the privatisation of British Rail in 1993, Class 507 and 508 units have been used interchangeably on both the Wirral and Northern lines and in 2003-2004 the 59-strong Class 507/508 fleet was refurbished by Alstom's Eastleigh Works at a cost of £32 million. Maintenance of the Class 507 and 508 fleet is carried out at Birkenhead North TMD and Kirkdale TMD. Birkenhead North TMD, just west of Birkenhead North station, focuses on major overhauls of the electric fleet, whereas Kirkdale TMD, situated south of Kirkdale station on the Northern line, is used for undertaking minor repairs and cleaning activities. Train cleaning operations took place at the now-defunct Birkenhead Central TMD beside Birkenhead Central station until the late 1990s. It was expected by Merseyrail that the 507s and 508s would be withdrawn around 2014 and replaced by a new EMU, but this has been postponed following the latest refurbishment. In May 2012, Merseytravel announced that it had formally begun a project for replacement of the 507s and 508s. In December 2016, Merseytravel announced that Stadler had won the £460 million contract and that the new trains would be delivered from summer 2019 with all the old trains replaced by 2021. In May 2014, the lease on the Class 507s and 508s was extended to 2018. As part of the agreement with Angel Trains, the fleet will receive a refresh package including external re-livery, internal enhancements and engineering work. ServicesPassenger= During Monday to Saturday, trains run every 15 minutes from Liverpool to each of New Brighton, West Kirby and Chester, and every 30 minutes to Ellesmere Port. During peak times outside of the leaf-fall season in autumn, additional services run to (evening peak), respectively from (morning peak) Ellesmere Port, giving a 15 minutes frequency there in the peak direction only. Hooton is the point of interchange between trains to Ellesmere Port and trains to Chester, and is served by six trains per hour from Liverpool, four of which continue to Chester (only two call at Capenhurst) and two calling at stations to Ellesmere Port. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, these frequencies reduced as of March 2020. Interchange with the Northern line is available at Liverpool Central and Moorfields, and with the City Line at Liverpool Lime Street. Transport for Wales operate services from Bidston along the Borderlands Line to . Various proposals over the years have suggested the electrification of part or all of this route and incorporating it into the Wirral line, as well as also electrifying beyond Ellesmere Port through to . Connections are available with other National Rail services at Liverpool Lime Street and Chester. There is also a very limited connecting service from Ellesmere Port to Helsby and . =Freight= Parts of the Wirral line in Ellesmere Port saw frequent freight traffic until 1996 with branches to several wharves as well as Eastham Oil Terminal. In 2005 a single track line to Manisty Wharf in Ellesmere Port was reopened for a regular coal flow to Fiddlers Ferry power station. This freight route enters the terminus station Ellesmere Port, from the east, only using the Wirral line tracks through the station and branches north immediately after the station to reach the wharf. Freightliner Heavy Haul currently operates the service, with two trains per day. Freightliner Heavy Haul also has a contract with Quinn Glass to deliver sand from Sibelco's Middleton Towers Quarry in Middleton, Norfolk to their site at Elton which outputs 1.2 billion glass containers per year for the food and beverage industry. A trial service ran on 7 April 2011 and a twice-weekly service every Wednesday and Friday commenced on 13 April 2011. At present the sand is transported by road the final five miles to the Quinn Glass plant from a former Cawoods siding in Ellesmere Port beside the Manchester Ship Canal, south of Manisty Wharf, but from November 2011 trains were due to begin using a dedicated terminal at the plant itself. It was announced during this month that construction work had been delayed due to the discovery of a badger sett on the proposed site. Completion of the new line was set back to the end of June 2012 with a reported total cost of more than £2 million. In November 2012 it emerged that Quinn Glass had broken a planning condition requiring the rail terminal to be operational by November 2011. The company cited additional demands by Network Rail and the Environment Agency's decision to switch off the Frodsham Marshes pumping stations as causes of delay. Quinn Glass have since been granted an extended period by Cheshire West and Chester council during which to complete the project. Incidents Class 507 unit 507009 which derailed as it approached Birkenhead North station on 19 May 2004. A number of incidents have occurred on the Wirral line. Unit 508118, while in storage in the siding at Birkenhead North, was subject to an arson attack in 2001. The unit was scrapped. On 19 May 2004, Unit 507009 derailed at points as it approached Birkenhead North station. The leading bogie of four wheels came off the track, but the train remained upright. None of the 20 or so passengers on the train were injured. The cause was a worn switch rail and an imbalance in wheel loads across the leading carriage of the train. At 17:41 on 26 October 2005 the rear bogie of unit 508124 derailed in the Loop tunnel between Liverpool Lime Street and Liverpool Central. Due to concerns by Network Rail as to the condition of the track, there had long been a temporary speed restriction of in the tunnel, although at the time of the derailment the train was travelling at only . None of the 119 passengers were injured; the guard attended hospital overnight with a neck injury, but was not detained. In August 2006 a report by the Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) cited poor track maintenance, inadequacy of the rail fastening system, and the track infrastructure and trains not being designed as a complete system, as causes of the derailment. Liverpool-bound services terminated at James Street instead of going around the Loop while investigation and track renewal work took place. On 19 April 2006 a small fire in the Mersey Railway Tunnel caused electrics to short circuit. The 06:30 service from Ellesmere Port to Liverpool Central was in the tunnel at the time of the incident. All 120 passengers were escorted through the tunnel to . At 11:57 on 11 January 2007, unit 507019 hit the buffers at West Kirby as it was arriving from Liverpool Central. There were no injuries to the 20-30 passengers, but the driver and guard were treated for shock and minor rib injuries respectively. The train was travelling at around at the time of impact when it demolished the buffers and caused other minor damage. The unit was towed to Crewe Works and repaired. On 30 October 2007 a fire broke out on a Liverpool Central to Chester service. The train was evacuated at . The fire was caused by an electrical fault, and the carriage involved was damaged. The West Kirby branch of the line has several level crossings, and accidents at these, involving pedestrian fatalities, have taken place in July 2007, January 2008, and November 2009.

History  Upon the failed Revolutions of 1848, several deputies in the Landtag diet of Prussia maintained the idea of constitutionalism as it had been developed in the Vormärz era. In the 1850s, these Old Liberals gathered in a parliamentary group around Georg von Vincke, an originally conservative Prussian official and landowner (Junker). Vincke, former member of the Frankfurt Parliament, a polished orator and firebrand, had fallen out with Prime Minister Otto Theodor von Manteuffel over his reactionary policies and in 1852 even fought a duel with Bismarck after a heated verbal exchange in parliament (both men missed). When under the regency of William I of Prussia from 1858 the Prussian policies of the new era turned towards a more centrist stance, a left-wing group under Max von Forckenbeck seceded and allied with members of the German National Association to form the Ge the founders were Rudolf Virchow, Theodor Mommsen, Werner von Siemens, Benedict Waldeck, Hermann Schulze-Delitzsch, Hans Victor von Unruh, Wilhelm Loewe and Johann Jacoby. In its program, the party responded to the German Question by the postulation of the unification of the German states with the central power in Prussia (Kleindeutsche Lösung). It demanded representative democracy—though not universal suffrage in view of the Prussian three-class franchise system—implementation of the rule of law and larger responsibility for the local government. Before the rise of the Social Democrats, it was the main left-wing party in Germany and it was also the first German party with its candidates and deputies acting on a common party platform. Supported by the rising bourgeois middle class, the Progressives had the largest group in the Prussian Lower House between 1861 and 1865. In 1862, their refusal to furthermore pass the government budget for a re-organisation of the Prussian Army instigated by War Minister Albrecht von Roon led to the resignation of the centrist Prime Minister Karl Anton, Prince of Hohenzollern. On the verge of his abdication, King William was persuaded by Roon to appoint the young conservative Otto von Bismarck Prussian Minister President. Bismarck ignored the parliament's blockade by proclaiming his Lückentheorie (\\"gap theory\\"), whereafter in a deadlock situation between the king and the assembly, for want of provision by the Prussian Constitution, the decision of the monarch had to tip the balance. Bismarck was able to keep the public indignation covered, accompanied by his famous \\"Blood and Iron\\" speech in the Prussian Abgeordnetenhaus. He continued to rule against the parliamentary majority while the parliament members of the Progressive Party found themselves unable to overthrow his government. Upon the Prussian victory at the Battle of Königgrätz ending the Austro-Prussian War in 1866, Bismarck initiated a law confirming the parliament's power of the purse, but also granting an amnesty for the arbitrary conduct of his government. Meant as an attempt for reconciliation, a vast majority of the parliament approved it, but the liberals were at strife among themselves and the Progressive Party finally split apart—the right-wing which supported Bismarck's policy seceded to form the National Liberal Party in 1867 while a democratic-republican wing in Southern Germany seceded to form German People's Party in 1868. The remaining Progressive parliament members under Benedict Waldeck principally supported Bismarck's formation of the North German Confederation, directed at the establishment of a Prussian-led German nation state, though they rejected the Imperial Constitution of 1871 as undemocratic. In the first federal election of 1871, the party gained 8.8% of the votes cast and 46 seats in the Reichstag parliament, largely outnumbered by its National Liberal rivals. Later on, the Progressives approached towards the policy of the new Chancellor. To characterize Bismarck's politics toward the Catholic Church, the pathologist and parliament member Rudolf Virchow used the term Kulturkampf the first time on 17 January 1873 in the Prussian House of Representatives. In the later years of Bismarck's incumbency, the Progressives again kept their distance to his government. Under the new board of Eugen Richter, Ludwig Loewe, Albert Hänel and Albert Traeger, the party developed to a pan-German liberal democratic party, rejecting Bismarck's Anti-Socialist Laws as well as his free trade restrictions. In the federal election of 1881, the Progress Party reached its best results ever with 12.7% of the votes cast and 56 seats in the Reichstag, becoming the second strongest faction after the Catholic Centre Party. To unite the left-wing liberal forces, the party finally merged on 5 March 1884 with the Liberal Union (a split-off of the National Liberals) into the German Free-minded Party.

Biography Weir was born in Cambridge, England, to Scottish parents. She studied with Sir John Tavener whilst at school (North London Collegiate School) and subsequently with Robin Holloway at King's College, Cambridge, graduating in 1976. Her music often draws on sources from medieval history, as well as the traditional stories and music of her parents' homeland, Scotland. Although she has achieved international recognition for her orchestral and chamber works, Weir is best known for her operas and theatrical works. From 1995 to 2000, she was Artistic Director of the Spitalfields Festival in London. She held the post of Composer in Association for the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra from 1995 to 1998. She received the Lincoln Center's Stoeger Prize in 1997, the South Bank Show music award in 2001 and the ISM's Distinguished Musician Award in 2010. In 2007, she was the third recipient of The Queen's Medal for Music. She was Visiting Distinguished Research Professor in Composition in Cardiff University from 2006 to 2009. In 2005, Weir was appointed CBE for services to music. On 30 June 2014, The Guardian stated that her appointment as the Master of the Queen's Music, succeeding Sir Peter Maxwell Davies (whose term of office expired in March 2014), would be announced;Booth, Robert, \\"Judith Weir to be appointed first female master of Queen's music\\", The Guardian (London), 29 June 2014. Retrieved 2 July 2014 this was officially confirmed on 21 July. In May 2015, Weir won The Ivors Classical Music Award at the Ivor Novello Awards. Weir is a member of the Incorporated Society of Musicians. In 2018 she was elected an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. Music Weir's musical language is fairly conservative, with a \\"knack of making simple musical ideas appear freshly mysterious.\\" Her first stage work, The Black Spider, was a one- act opera which premiered in Canterbury in 1985 loosely based on the short novel of the same name by Jeremias Gotthelf. She has subsequently written one more \\"micro-opera\\", three full-length operas, and an opera for television. In 1987, her first half-length opera, A Night at the Chinese Opera, premiered at Kent Opera. This was followed by a further three full-length operas The Vanishing Bridegroom (1990), Blond Eckbert (1994), the latter commissioned by the English National Opera and Miss Fortune (Achterbahn) (2011). In 2005 her opera Armida, an opera for television, premiered on Channel Four in the United Kingdom). The work was made in co-operation with Margaret Williams. Weir's commissioned works most notably include woman.life.song (2000) for Jessye Norman and We are Shadows (1999) for Simon Rattle. In January 2008, Weir was the focus of the BBC's annual composer weekend at the Barbican Centre in London. The four days of programmes ended with a first performance of her new commission, CONCRETE, a choral motet. The subject of this piece was inspired by the Barbican building itself – she describes it as 'an imaginary excavation of the Barbican Centre, burrowing through 2,500 years of historical rubble'. The first public performance of Weir's arrangement of the National Anthem of the UK, God Save the Queen, was performed at the reburial of King Richard III at Leicester Cathedral on 26 March 2015. =Opera and Music Theatre= * King Harald's Saga (1979, soprano, singing eight roles) *The Black Spider (6 March 1985, Canterbury); also exists in an expanded version for Hamburg State Opera (February 8, 2009, Hamburg) * The Consolations of Scholarship (5 May 1985, Durham, soprano, chamber ensemble) *A Night at the Chinese Opera (8 July 1987, Cheltenham) *HEAVEN ABLAZE in His Breast (5 October 1989, Basildon), based on E.T.A.

It was a co-production with the Royal Opera, Covent Garden, London, and was written in English. The opera reworks a Sicilian folktale as a contemporary parable. Gerhard R. Koch, writing in the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper on 25 July, had these observations: :The music of Judith Weir, who also wrote the libretto for her opera, is neither avant-garde nor experimental but has a highly distilled folkloric style with cantabile voices similar to that of Britten without becoming retrospective. Tonality and atonality are not applied in a strictly antithetical manner, therefore the ideas of the American minimalists Reich and Riley are very present. This music has colour and a rhythmic pulse; it creates characteristic sounds without losing itself in descriptive patterns. Miss Fortune moved to London in March 2012, garnering at least two negative reviews. Edward Seckerson in The Independent (London) wrote of \\"Miss Fortune in name and deed\\" and described the opera as \\"silly and naive\\" and \\"a waste of talent and resources\\", with a libretto that \\"vacillates between the banal and the unintentionally comedic (or is that irony?), full of truisms and clunky metaphors\\" and \\"about as streetwise as a visitor from Venus\\". Andrew Clements wrote in The Guardian of \\"a long two hours in the opera house\\" with scenes that \\"follow like cartoonish tableaux, without real characterisation, or confrontation, and without suggesting a dramatic shape\\", and also criticised the \\"twee rhyming couplets and inert blank verse\\" of Weir's libretto. The American premiere of Miss Fortune was originally planned in 2011 by the Santa Fe Opera to be a part of its 2014 season, but it was announced in the summer of 2012 that the opera was to be replaced by the North American premiere of Huang Ruo's Dr. Sun Yat-sen.Press release from The Santa Fe Opera, 22 August 2012. =Other compositions= * Music for 247 Strings (1981, violin, piano) * Thread!

It was opened in 1816 and closed in 1890. Construction Plan of Millbank Prison The site at Millbank was originally purchased in 1799 from the Marquess of Salisbury for £12,000 by the philosopher Jeremy Bentham, acting on behalf of the Crown, for the erection of his proposed Panopticon prison as Britain's new National Penitentiary. After various changes in circumstance, the Panopticon plan was abandoned in 1812. Proposals for the National Penitentiary continued, however, and were given a legislative basis in the Penitentiary House, etc. Act of 1812 (52 Geo. 3 c. 44). An architectural competition for a new prison building on the Millbank site attracted 43 entrants: the winning design was that of William Williams, drawing master at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. Williams' basic plan was adapted by a practising architect, Thomas Hardwick, who began construction in the same year. Hardwick resigned in 1813, and John Harvey took over the role. Harvey was dismissed in turn in 1815, and replaced by Robert Smirke, who brought the project to completion in 1821. Further legislation was passed in the form of the Millbank Penitentiary Act of 1816 (56 Geo. 3 c. 63). The marshy site on which the prison stood meant that the builders experienced problems of subsidence from the outset, and explains the succession of architects. Smirke finally resolved the difficulty by introducing a highly innovative concrete raft to provide a secure foundation. However, this added considerably to the construction costs, which eventually totalled £500,000, more than twice the original estimate and equivalent to £500 per cell. History The first prisoners, all women, were admitted on 26 June 1816. The first men arrived in January 1817. The prison held 103 men and 109 women by the end of 1817, and 452 men and 326 women by late 1822. Sentences of five to ten years in the National Penitentiary were offered as an alternative to transportation to those thought most likely to reform. In addition to the problems of construction, the marshy site fostered disease, to which the prisoners had little immunity owing to their extremely poor diet. In 1818 the authorities engaged Dr Alexander Copland Hutchison of Westminster Dispensary as Medical Supervisor, to oversee the health of the inmates.Parliamentary Papers 1780–1849, vol. 5, 1825: \\"The General Penitentiary at Millbank\\". In 1822-23 an epidemic swept through the prison, which seems to have comprised a mixture of dysentery, scurvy, depression and other disorders.Evans 1982, p. 249. The decision was eventually taken to evacuate the buildings for several months: the female prisoners were released, and the male prisoners temporarily transferred to the prison hulks at Woolwich, where their health improved. The design of Millbank also turned out to be unsatisfactory. The network of corridors was so labyrinthine that even the warders got lost;Griffiths 1884, p. 27. and the ventilation system allowed sound to carry, so that prisoners could communicate between cells. The annual running costs turned out to be an unsupportable £16,000. In view of these problems, the decision was eventually taken to build a new \\"model prison\\" at Pentonville, which opened in 1842 and took over Millbank's role as the National Penitentiary. By an Act of Parliament of 1843, Millbank's status was downgraded, and it became a holding depot for convicts prior to transportation. Every person sentenced to transportation was sent to Millbank first, where they were held for three months before their final destination was decided. By 1850, around 4,000 people were condemned annually to transportation from the UK. Prisoners awaiting transportation were kept in solitary confinement and restricted to silence for the first half of their sentence. Large-scale transportation ended in 1853 (although the practice continued on a reduced scale until 1867); and Millbank then became an ordinary local prison, and from 1870 a military prison. By 1886 it had ceased to hold inmates, and it closed in 1890.Brodie et al. 2002, p. 60. Demolition began in 1892, and continued sporadically until 1903. Description The prison's burial ground, with the Houses of Parliament in the background. The image was published in 1862. Map of 1867, showing the prison and its surroundings The plan of the prison comprised a circular chapel at the centre of the site, surrounded by a three-storey hexagon made up of the governor's quarters, administrative offices and laundries, surrounded in turn by six pentagons of cell blocks. The buildings of each pentagon were set around a cluster of five small courtyards (with a watchtower at the centre) used as airing-yards, and in which prisoners undertook labour.Griffiths 1884, p. 26. The three outer angles of each pentagon were distinguished by tall circular towers, described in 1862 as \\"Martello-like\\": these served in part as watchtowers, but their primary purpose was to contain staircases and water-closets.Mayhew and Binny 1862.Holford 1828, plan of prison. The third and fourth pentagons (those to the north-west, furthest from the entrance) were used to house female prisoners, and the remaining four for male prisoners. In the Handbook of London in 1850 the prison was described as follows: Each cell had a single window (looking into the pentagon courtyard), and was equipped with a washing tub, a wooden stool, a hammock and bedding, and books including a Bible, a prayer-book, a hymn-book, an arithmetic-book, a work entitled Home and Common Things, and publications of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. Irish republican prisoner Michael Davitt, who was held briefly at Millbank in 1870, described the experience: Later development of the site The site of the prison in 1916, after redevelopment. Its outline is still visible in the pattern of streets and buildings. As the prison was progressively demolished its site was redeveloped. The principal new buildings erected were the National Gallery of British Art (now Tate Britain), which opened in 1897; the Royal Army Medical School, the buildings of which were adapted in 2005 to become the Chelsea College of Art & Design; andusing the original bricks of the prisonthe Millbank Estate, a housing estate built by the London County Council (LCC) between 1897 and 1902. The estate comprises 17 buildings, each named after a distinguished painter, and is Grade II listed. Surviving remains Surviving bollard Surviving perimeter ditch A large circular bollard stands by the river with the inscription: \\"Near this site stood Millbank Prison which was opened in 1816 and closed in 1890. This buttress stood at the head of the river steps from which, until 1867, prisoners sentenced to transportation embarked on their journey to Australia.\\" Part of the perimeter ditch of the prison survives running between Cureton Street and John Islip Street. It is now used as a clothes-drying area for residents of Wilkie House. Archaeological investigations in the late 1990s and early 2000s on the sites of Chelsea College of Art and Design and Tate Britain recorded significant remains of the foundations of the external pentagon walls of the prison, of parts of the inner hexagon, of two of the courtyard watchtowers, of drainage culverts, and of Smirke's concrete raft.Edwards 2007.Edwards 2010. The granite gate piers at the entrance of Purbeck House, High Street, Swanage in Dorset, and a granite bollard next to the gate, are thought by English Heritage to be possibly from Millbank Prison. Cultural references Charles Dickens describes the prison in chapter 52 (\\"Obstinacy\\") of his novel, Bleak House (1852–3). One of the characters is put into custody there, and other characters go to visit him. Esther Summerson, one of the book's narrators, gives a brief description of its layout. In Henry James's realist novel The Princess Casamassima (1886) the prison is the \\"primal scene\\" of Hyacinth Robinson's life: the visit to his mother, dying in the infirmary, is described in chapter 3. James visited Millbank on 12 December 1884 to gain material.Henry James letters, edited by Leon Edel, Vol. 3: 1883–1895, Cambridge, Mass.: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press; London: Macmillan, 1980, page 61. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in chapter 8 of The Sign of Four (1890) refers to Holmes and Watson crossing the Thames from the house of Mordecai Smith and landing by the Millbank Penitentiary. In chapter 8 of Conan Doyle's The Lost World (1912), Professor Challenger says that he dislikes walking along the Thames as it is always sad to see one's final destination. Challenger means that he expects to be buried at Westminster Abbey, but his rival Professor Summerlee responds sardonically that he understands that Millbank Prison has been demolished. The prison is a key location within Sarah Waters' novel Affinity (1999). The prison, Bentham's philosophy surrounding it, and a fictionalized account of Smirke's role in its construction play a key part in the plot of horror fiction podcast The Magnus Archives by Jonathan Sims.

Some degree of fusion of the labioscrotal folds and urogenital folds and clitoral enlargement can occur if exposure occurs from the 8th through the 12th week of gestation, but only clitoral enlargement can occur if exposure occurs after the 12th week. This can in some cases result in ambiguous genitalia. Fetal masculinization of female external genitalia is usually due to enzyme abnormalities involved in adrenal steroid biosynthesis, resulting in congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH); fetal masculinization of female external genitalia is much less frequently due to maternal use of androgenic steroids. Fetal masculinization of female external genitalia due to maternal use of androgenic steroids is generally less advanced than that due to CAH, and unlike CAH, does not cause progressive virilization. Affected females mature normally with normal fertility, there is almost total regression of the genital anomaly in cases of simple clitoral enlargement, and in even the most severe cases, surgical correction of labioscrotal fusion is relatively simple. Dosage The incidence of fetal masculinization of female external genitalia varies with the drug and dosage. =Androgens= The only sex steroid currently utilized in women that can cause virilization of female fetuses when administered in usually administered doses is the androgen danazol, a derivative of ethisterone (ethinyltestosterone). Fetal masculinization of female external genitalia has resulted from doses of danazol as low as 200 mg/day, whereas 800 mg/day is the usual initial dose when danazol is used to treat severe endometriosis. =Progestogens= In general, pregnane derivatives (e.g., progesterone, dydrogesterone, hydroxyprogesterone caproate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, megestrol acetate) do not virilize even in high dose; testosterone derivatives (ethisterone) and 19-nortestosterone (norethisterone, norethisterone acetate, etc.) generally virilize, but there are exceptions (e.g., noretynodrel, allylestrenol) that do not. The only progestogens currently used during pregnancy (e.g., for luteal support in IVF protocols or for prevention of preterm birth in pregnant women with a history of at least one spontaneous preterm birth) are: progesterone, hydroxyprogesterone caproate, dydrogesterone, and allylestrenol. Doses of 19-nortestosterones required for virilization are 10 to 20 mg/day, far in excess of those associated with inadvertent contraceptive exposure during pregnancy. Genital ambiguity due to progestin exposure in pregnancy is thus mostly a topic of historical concern. HistoryAndrogens= The first drugs reported to cause fetal masculinization were the androgens methandriol and methyltestosterone in the mid-1950s. On June 21, 1976, the FDA approved the androgen danazol (Danocrine), a derivative of ethisterone, for treatment of endometriosis, with a warning that its use in pregnancy is contraindicated because of the risk of masculinization of external genitalia of female fetuses. search: Danocrine The first case report of fetal masculinization of the external genitalia of a female infant born to a mother inadvertently treated in pregnancy with danazol was published in 1981. Between 1975 and 1990, the manufacturer of Danocrine, Winthrop Laboratories, received reports worldwide of 129 pregnant women exposed to danazol, with 94 completed pregnancies and the birth of 57 female infants – 23 (40%) of whom were virilized with a pattern of clitoromegaly, fused labia and urogenital sinus formation, with genital reconstructive surgery usually, but not always, required in childhood. It is likely that the true rate of occurrence is much less than 40%, as many cases with a normal outcome would not be reported. No genital anomalies were reported where danazol therapy was discontinued before the 8th week of pregnancy. The warnings against use of danazol were progressively strengthened in the 1980s. In 1991 the FDA required a black box warning that use of danazol in pregnancy is contraindicated because exposure to danazol in utero may result in androgenic effects on the female fetus causing external genitalia masculinization. The black box warning recommends a sensitive hCGβ-subunit pregnancy test immediately prior to starting danazol therapy and use of a non-hormonal method of contraception during therapy. As of 2000, there had been published reports of fetal masculinization of female external genitalia in: * 23 cases associated with danazol (all from inadvertent use from 1975–1990) * 13 cases associated with methandriol (all from use in the 1950s and 1960s) * 11 cases associated with methyltestosterone (all from use in the 1950s and 1960s) =Progestogens=Past use for prevention of miscarriage In the 1940s, some studies suggested that progesterone could prevent threatened abortion and might prevent habitual abortion, but oral bioavailability of progesterone is low and injections of progesterone can be painful, so orally active progestins were tried beginning with ethisterone, followed by other progestins as they became available: noretynodrel (Enovid) and norethisterone (Norlutin) in 1957, medroxyprogesterone acetate (Provera) in 1959, norethisterone acetate (Norlutate) in 1961, and dydrogesterone (Duphaston) in 1962. The first case reports of fetal masculinization of external genitalia of female infants born to mothers treated in pregnancy with high-dose ethisterone and high-dose norethisterone (17α-ethinyl-19-nortestosterone) to prevent miscarriage were published in 1957 and 1958, respectively. In a March 1960 JAMA article, pediatric endocrinologist Lawson Wilkins at Johns Hopkins reported on 34 cases of fetal masculinization of external genitalia of female infants born from 1950 to 1959 to mothers treated with high-dose (20–250 mg/day) ethisterone to prevent miscarriage, and 35 cases of fetal masculinization of external genitalia of female infants born from 1957 to 1959 to mothers treated with high-dose (10–40 mg/day) norethisterone to prevent miscarriage. In 1961, Ciba and Parke-Davis added the reported association of ethisterone and norethisterone with masculinization of external genitalia of the female fetus to the precautions section of their advertisements to physicians and physician prescribing information. A clinical trial published in the October 1962 American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology reported fetal masculinization of external genitalia of 14 of 59 female infants (24%) born to mothers who began high-dose (10–40 mg/day) norethisterone treatment to prevent miscarriage in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy (11 infants had slight clitoral enlargement, 1 had marked clitoral enlargement, 2 infants had marked clitoral enlargement and partial fusion of the labioscrotal folds); fetal masculinization of external genitalia of 1 of 23 female infants born to mothers who began high-dose (10–40 mg/day) norethisterone treatment to prevent miscarriage after the 12th week of pregnancy (1 infant with slight clitoral enlargement was born to a mother who began norethisterone treatment in week 13). In 1964, Parke-Davis revised the physician prescribing information for Norlutin (norethisterone) and Norlutate (norethisterone acetate) to remove their indications for use in infertility, habitual abortion and threatened abortion, and add pregnancy as a contraindication to their use because of the possibility of masculinization of external genitalia of the female fetus. In 1977, the FDA determined that there was no adequate evidence that progestogens (including progesterone, dydrogesterone, and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone caproate) were effective in treating threatened abortion or preventing habitual abortion and withdrew approval for those indications. As of 2000, there had been published reports of fetal masculinization of female external genitalia in: * 78 cases associated with ethisterone (all from use in the 1950s and early 1960s to prevent miscarriage) * 81 cases associated with norethisterone (all from use in the late 1950s and early 1960s to prevent miscarriage) Past FDA labeling requirements On July 22, 1977, the FDA published a notice requiring a black box warning on all progestogen drugs (except contraceptives) to warn against their use during the first four months of pregnancy because of reports of non-genital birth defects. On January 12, 1989, after determining that progestogens did not cause non-genital birth defects, the FDA published a notice revising the black box warning on all progestogen drugs (except contraceptives) to warn against their use during the first four months of pregnancy because of past reports of genital birth defects (an increased risk of hypospadias in male fetuses and mild virilization of the external genitalia in female fetuses). On November 16, 1999, the FDA published a notice effective November 16, 2000 removing (after 22 years) the black box warning on all progestogen drugs because it was unwarranted based on scientific review of current data.

The choke involves using the arms to encircle the opponent's neck in a fashion similar to a guillotine. Application The technique is either a type of tracheal compression restraint (wind choke) that prevents air flow to the lungs, or a blood choke depending on how it is applied. When executed from the ground, the person applying it will try to control the opponent by the hips, for instance using a closed guard. This is done to prevent the opponent from escaping the hold, and to be able to apply additional pressure by extending the hips. It is a very effective maneuver when performed correctly. The arm is wrapped around the trachea and the hands are clasped. Pressure is applied upwards to restrict blood flow to the head, eventually causing unconsciousness and, if applied for more time, even death. It is taught in various grappling martial arts and is considered universal to grappling, including Jujutsu, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, Judo, as well as in mixed martial arts competition and exists as one of the most instinctive chokes. Description The 2002 FM 3-25.150 Army Combatives field manual dictates that the fighter should first ensure that the enemy's head goes underneath one of their arms. The fighter wraps their arm around the enemy's head and under their neck. The fighter's palm should be facing their own chest. With the other hand, the fighter grasps the first hand, ensuring that they have not reached around the enemy's arm, and pulls upward with both hands. They now sit down and place the enemy within their guard, and finish the choke by pulling with their arms and pushing with their legs. In popular culture Although the technique has been around for many centuries, it was popularised by martial artist Bruce Lee in his 1972 movie Way of the Dragon. Before he became better known as WWE star Daniel Bryan, professional wrestler Bryan Danielson used the guillotine choke as his finishing maneuver. Ivelisse Velez currently uses the hold as her finisher. It is also featured prominently as a finishing move in the climactic fight of the movie Never Back Down, about underground MMA fight clubs.

The album peaked at #6 on the U.S. Billboard 200 album chart,US Billboard Chart No. 6 and hit the UK Top 30 and number 9 in Australia. Background The album was Humble Pie's first following the departure of guitarist Peter Frampton, which placed singer and co-founder Steve Marriott as the band's de facto leader. Smokin' is the band's best-selling album, due in large part to the success of the single \\"30 Days in the Hole\\".

Marriott insisted on producing the album himself for the challenge of creating a compact R&B; sound with a high-tech 24-track mixing board. Marriott collapsed with exhaustion in February. New Musical Express (NME) reported at the time: \\"Following intense recording sessions with Humble Pie, Steve Marriott collapsed with nervous exhaustion and doctors told him to rest\\".

Ordinary Finns without a right of domicile have none of these rights in Åland. Ordinary Finns can get Ålandic right of domicile after living on the islands for five years and proving their satisfactory knowledge of Swedish. Ålanders lose their right of domicile after living outside Åland for five years, or on forfeiting their Finnish citizenship.Landskapslagen om hembygdsrätt (ÅFS 2/1993). Retrieved on 22 March 2007.

Municipal domicile and registration  The Finnish law grants several rights, e.g. social services, municipal franchise and education on the basis of municipal domicile (). The concept of municipal domicile is based on residency and is tied to citizenship only weakly. However, the naturalization legislation refers several times to the municipal domicile as a requirement for naturalization. =Registration of the municipal domicile = As the main rule, the person is domiciled in their place of residence. A new-born is domiciled in the municipality of its mother. If a person has several residences, the place which he has closest ties to is their domicile. The ties may be related to work, family or other similar arrangements.

Administratively, the municipal domicile is one of the most important factors in determining the jurisdiction of different state authorities over the person.

Another duty tied to the municipal domicile is the duty to accept a position in municipal board, if the municipal council elects the person to a board. Municipal domicile grants also other than political rights.

The domicile in Finland requires factual residence and home in Finland, as well as permanent and continued physical presence in the country. This applies to foreigners and citizens alike. Persons moving into Finland may be considered domiciled in Finland immediately if they actually intend to remain in the country. This means that not even a Finnish citizen moving into Finland is guaranteed the state social benefits immediately after entry, unless they can show that they intend to remain.Laki asumiseen perustuvan sosiaaliturvalainsäädännön soveltamisesta (1573/1993) 3§.

Students, missionaries, scholars, scientists, aid workers, officials of international organizations and employees of Finnish companies, as well as their family members may retain their domicile in Finland indefinitely even if they lose their municipal domicile. However, the Kela, which determines the domicile status, has a wide leeway to judge the circumstances of individuals.Laki asumiseen perustuvan sosiaaliturvalainsäädännön soveltamisesta (1573/1993) 5–8§.

Loss of Finnish citizenship Although dual citizenship is permitted, a Finnish citizen who is a citizen of another country will lose Finnish citizenship at age 22 unless he or she has sufficiently close ties with Finland. Persons with close ties include those: * born in Finland and domiciled there on their 22nd birthday * with a total of seven years residence in Finland or another Nordic country * to whom a Finnish passport was issued between the ages of 18 and 21 * who have completed military or non-military service in Finland between the ages of 18 and 21 * who have submitted a declaration of retention of Finnish citizenship between the ages of 18 and 21 to the appropriate authorities in Finland or to a Finland diplomatic mission overseas. Renunciation of foreign citizenship is not required. Finnish citizens may also lose citizenship if they formally petition for permission to renounce it. To prevent statelessness, Finnish citizenship may be renounced only if the person proves that they are a citizen of another state. While losing Finnish citizenship is rare, the benefits of citizenship for persons residing abroad without close ties to Finland are few. A citizen without domicile in Finland and without municipal domicile has no rights to Finnish social security, to Finnish consular help in personal emergencies,Hallituksen esitys konsulipalvelulaiksi (HE 283/1998) .

The most important remaining rights are the absolute right to return to Finland, to vote in national elections, to have a Finnish passport, to work in the European Union without the working visa requirements faced by non-European Union citizens, and to enroll in Scandinavian universities as a European Union citizen (waiving university fees). In addition, all Finnish citizens have the right to receive consular protection from Finnish foreign missions in case of a major crisis in the host country or in case of arrest or incarceration.Hallituksen esitys konsulipalvelulaiksi (HE 283/1998) .

Dual citizenship With effect from 1 June 2003, a Finnish citizen acquiring a foreign citizenship does not lose Finnish citizenship. Former Finnish citizens who lost Finnish citizenship prior to this date (upon naturalisation in another country) may re-acquire Finnish citizenship by declaration. Children of former Finnish citizens may also acquire Finnish citizenship by declaration. The deadline for submission of applications was 31 May 2008. As of July 2005, over 5000 people had acquired or resumed Finnish citizenship under this new provision.Maahanmuuttovirasto The changes to the law also mean that foreigners seeking naturalisation as a Finnish citizen do not need to renounce their former citizenship. They may retain it if the law of the other country permits them to do so. Effective 1 May 2019, individuals with dual citizenship can be deprived of their citizenship should they be sentenced for serious crimes which can lead to eight years prison. Given examples of such were terrorism, treason, hostage taking, people smuggling, inciting to war and espionage. The decision on whether to cancel the Finnish citizenship will be taken by the Finnish Immigration Service. The law is not retroactive and therefore does not encompass people with Finnish citizenship who have joined the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Citizenship of the European Union Because Finland forms part of the European Union, Finnish citizens are also citizens of the European Union under European Union law and thus enjoy rights of free movement and have the right to vote in elections for the European Parliament.

Travel freedom of Finnish citizens Visa requirements for Finnish citizens Visa requirements for Finnish citizens are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of Finland. In 2020, Finnish citizens had visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to 188 countries and territories, ranking the Finnish passport fourth in the world according to the Visa Restrictions Index. The Finnish nationality is ranked eighth in The Quality of Nationality Index (QNI). This index differs from the Visa Restrictions Index, which focuses on external factors including travel freedom. The QNI considers, in addition, to travel freedom on internal factors such as peace & stability, economic strength, and human development as well.

It is the seat of the Juan Antonio Sotillo Municipality. The city has road connections to the state capital, Barcelona, to Lecheria and to Guanta. Geography The city of Puerto La Cruz is located on the southern shore of the Caribbean. The elevation of the city varies between . The city position is at Latitude 10° 13' N and Longitude 64° 37' W. Typical temperatures vary between . Borders are represented by Mochima National Park, the North Eastern region, and the Coastal Mountains. History The history of this settlement began with the arrival of the Spanish to the northern coast of what would eventually become Venezuela. In 1780, the Christian Mission of Pozuelos () was founded by indigenous natives. On 9 April 1862, a group of 26 families from Margarita Island decided to settle in Pozuelos Bay. As time progressed, this settlement adopted the Virgen del Amparo () and the Holy Cross () as their religious symbols, celebrating their patron saint on 8 November () and iconography on 3 May (). By 1868 the first church was built, and slowly the name of the town was changed to Puerto de la Santa Cruz (), later shortened to Puerto La Cruz. Economy Puerto La Cruz is home to Puerto La Cruz refinery, one of the largest oil refineries in the country, which, with its per day processing capacity, supplies the domestic market and exports to other Caribbean countries such as Cuba and the Antilles. Also, at , José Plant is one of the primary processing facilities of the largest Venezuelan oil company, PDVSA and is a major refining hub for the crude extracted in the states of Monagas and Anzoátegui. Puerto La Cruz is the terminus of the Carapito-Puerto la Cruz oil pipeline, the San Joaquin-Puerto la Cruz oil pipeline and the Anaco-Puerto la Cruz gas pipeline. The city is the gateway to a large national park. The beaches of Mochima National Park surround the city. Places such as Isla de Plata, Playa Conoma, Isla Arapo and Playa Arapito are known for their beauty. To the west of the city is the terminal of one of the main ferry lines linking Isla Margarita with the mainland, while to the east is a private marina that caters for tourists and visitors. Day trips are available to visit national park islands such as Playa El Faro, Los Chimanas, Cachicamo and Isla Borracha. In addition to tourism, the major international banks have established their regional headquarters in the city. A large number of commercial businesses, and large shopping centers are progressively being developed. Transportation View of the Conferry of Puerto La Cruz. Large avenues cross the city, from north to south, and from east to west. Among them are: *Av. Municipal, which is the main avenue of the city, with two main traffic lanes and 2 service lanes in each direction, and was the first to be paved. *Av. 5 Julio is the most popular avenue for trade; most shops are owned by immigrants of Arab descent. *Av. Paseo Colon; almost all of this avenue borders the Bay of Pozuelos, which is one of the largest bays in the world. It has a boulevard where the symbol of the city of Puerto La Cruz (the Holy Cross) is situated. In addition here are established known hotels. *Av. Bolivar, with a number of shops devoted to the sale of automotive spare parts, as well as car dealers. Paseo with Connects Miranda Av.

Paseo Colon, starts from the sector Espigón, in front of the Razil Hotel, passes through the Sector El Paraiso, and onwards the Ave. Americo Vespusio to Lechería. Puerto La Cruz has several ports from which many destinations, attractions, and shopping facilities can be reached. Margarita Island can be reached by the transport service operated by Conferry and Gran Cacique Express (which resumed its activities in December 2006). The beaches located on the islands of Mochima National Park may also be reached from Lechería. In Guaraguao, Puerto La Cruz, there is also a terminal for the export/import of the crude oil processed at the city's refinery. Puerto La Cruz does not have its own airport and uses Generál José Antonio Anzoátegui International Airport, in the nearby city of Barcelona. Mass transportation El Faro Island in the Mochima National Park View of Puerto La Cruz from the Caribbean Sea According to various sources, local authorities are awaiting the signature of President Hugo Chávez after negotiating an agreement between the mayors of Puerto La Cruz (Sotillo Municipality) and Barcelona (Bolivar Municipality) and the Chinese company Transtech Engineering Corporation for the construction of a network of modern mass transportation. The target date for the launch of this initiative was August 2007, but since the announcement in March of that year has not been re-appointed over the project. The first phase of construction of the Metro urban network is expected to last approximately two years to complete. According to various estimates, this would reduce by 50% the volume of traffic that is logged daily in this metropolitan area. This ambitious project involves an air transport infrastructure, with additional sections on land.

Traditionally, they are made from oat groats that have been dehusked and steamed, before being rolled into flat flakes under heavy rollers and then stabilized by being lightly toasted. Thick-rolled oats are large whole flakes, and thin-rolled oats are smaller, fragmented flakes. Rolled whole oats, without further processing, can be cooked into a porridge and eaten as old-fashioned oats or Scottish oats, but more highly fragmented and processed rolled oats absorb water much more easily and therefore cook faster into a porridge, so they are sometimes called \\"quick\\" or \\"instant\\" oats. Besides porridge, rolled oats are most often the main ingredient in granola and muesli. They can be further processed into a coarse powder, which, when cooked, becomes a thick liquid like broth. Finer oatmeal powder is often used as baby food.  Process  The oat, like other cereals, has a hard, inedible outer husk that must be removed before the grain can be eaten. After the outer husk (or chaff) has been removed from the still bran-covered oat grains, the remainder is called oat groats. Since the bran layer, though nutritious, makes the grains tough to chew and contains an enzyme that can cause the oats to go rancid, raw oat groats are often further steam-treated to soften them for a quicker cooking time (modern \\"quick oats\\") and to denature the enzymes for a longer shelf life. = Steel-cut or pinhead oats = Steel-cut or pinhead oats are oat groats that have been chopped into smaller pieces before any steaming and thus retain bits of the bran layer.  Preparation  Rolled oats can be eaten without further heating or cooking: The oats are soaked for 1–6 hours in water-based liquid, such as water, milk, or plant-based dairy substitutes. The soak duration depends on shape, size and pre-processing technique, saving the time and the energy spent on heating, preserving its taste, and saving its nutritional values destroyed during cooking. Traditionally, oat groats are a whole grain that can be used as a breakfast cereal, just like the various forms of oatmeal, rolled oats and pinhead oats can be cooked to make porridge. Rolled oats are used in granola, muesli, oatcakes, and flapjacks (like a granola bar, not a pancake).  Nutrients  Whole oats (uncooked) are 68% carbohydrates, 6% fat, and 13% protein (table). In a 100 gram reference amount, whole oats supply 379 calories and contain high amounts (20% or more the Daily Value, DV) of the B vitamins - thiamine and pantothenic acid (40% and 22% DV, respectively) - and several dietary minerals, especially manganese (173% DV) and phosphorus (59% DV). As a rich source of dietary fiber (10 grams per 100 gram serving), whole oats supply beta-glucan (4 grams per 100 gram serving; table), a soluble fiber with cholesterol-lowering effects.

Written by Rick Parfitt and Andy Bown, it was released on the album of the same name in 1979 and has become one of the band's better-known works. It originally appeared on the band's 1979 album Whatever You Want and was later re-recorded for their 2003 album Riffs. Composition The song commences with a quiet introduction, containing a guitar playing notes from chords. Rick Parfitt and Francis Rossi used chorus, fuzz and flanging effects on their guitars. This lasts for approximately 26 seconds, and fades out towards the end. After this, the guitar picks up once more with a D-minor riff, and 40 seconds into the piece, the familiar D-major riff of the song begins, accompanied by drums from the 56 second mark. At 1 minute, 11 seconds, all audio pauses for approximately half a second; at this point, the lyrical portion commences. The music returns as soon as the first lyrics are heard. This pause creates a short-lived dramatic start to the song, which lasts for a total of four minutes. Impact Within the United Kingdom, the song reached number 4 in the UK Singles Chart in 1979. The song has been used in advertising campaigns by popular UK retailer Argos and Ireland based The Gift Voucher Shop which sells the One4all gift vouchers and gift cards, as well as being the theme tune to an ill-fated Saturday night TV show of the same name as the song. It was also parodied in a 1990s advertisement for the now defunct retailer What Everyone Wants, singing the store's name in place of the original song title. In 2008, the song was sampled on the hardstyle song \\"1980\\" by Citizen, and then later that same year by German techno band Scooter on the song \\"Jump That Rock (Whatever You Want)!\\" from the hit album Jumping All Over The World. The song has also featured albeit in a modified form for the Australian Supermarket chain Coles. The South African trio Mark Haze (from Idols South Africa season seven), Dozi and Ghapi recorded a version on their album \\"Rocking Buddies\\" in 2013. Retrieved 4 February 2014 In 2010 a segment of the song was played during a Doctor Who Confidential programme called Amy's Choice where Matt Smith was pointing at Arthur Darvill ponytail in reference to Status Quo lead singer Francis Rossi..{{cite weburl=https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6u8mmn In 2013 the band themselves appeared in an Australian television advertisement for Vegemite at the Coles Supermarkets chain, with the song as the backing track, as part of the store's \\"Down Down\\" campaign. The song was reprised, in 2014, for the band's thirty- first studio album Aquostic (Stripped Bare). It was featured in the ninety- minute launch performance of the album at London's Roundhouse on 22 October, the concert being recorded and broadcast live by BBC Radio 2 as part of their In Concert series. The German Bundesliga club FC Schalke 04 used the song as opening song during their home matches until 2015. Dutch Eredivisie club SBV Vitesse has used the song as their opening song for many years.  Arrangement  The song is guitar-oriented, like most Status Quo songs. During recording up to three guitar 'layers' were used, though it can be played with two: rhythm guitar and solo guitar. The other instruments are a bass guitar, keyboards and drums. The lyrics are multi-vocal; for instance the 'Whatever you want' part is sung entirely with two voices. The guitar low 'E' string is tuned to a D (the song is in the key of D). This is required to play the intro and also the low strumming after the intro. In this later part a flanger effect is used together with the ever-present overdrive/distortion effect.

It began as an organized insurrection of Yaik Cossacks headed by Yemelyan Pugachev, a disaffected ex-lieutenant of the Imperial Russian Army, against a background of profound peasant unrest and war with the Ottoman Empire. After initial success, Pugachev assumed leadership of an alternative government in the name of the assassinated Tsar Peter III and proclaimed an end to serfdom. This organized leadership presented a challenge to the imperial administration of Catherine II. The rebellion managed to consolidate support from various groups including the peasants, the Cossacks, and Old Believers priesthood. At one point, its administration claimed control over most of the territory between the Volga River and the Urals. One of the most significant events of the insurrection was the Battle of Kazan in July 1774. Government forces failed to respond effectively to the insurrection at first, partly due to logistical difficulties and a failure to appreciate its scale. However, the revolt was crushed towards the end of 1774 by General Michelsohn at Tsaritsyn. Pugachev was captured soon after and executed in Moscow in January 1775. Further reprisals against rebel areas were carried out by General Peter Panin. The events have generated many stories in legend and literature, most notably Pushkin's historical novel The Captain's Daughter (1836). It was the largest peasant revolt in Russia's history. Background and aims As the Russian monarchy contributed to the degradation of the serfs, peasant anger ran high. Peter the Great ceded entire villages to favored nobles, while Catherine the Great confirmed the authority of the nobles over the serfs in return for the nobles' political cooperation. The unrest intensified as the 18th century wore on, with more than fifty peasant revolts occurring between 1762 and 1769. These culminated in Pugachev's Rebellion, when, between 1773 and 1775, Yemelyan Pugachev rallied the peasants and Cossacks and promised the serfs land of their own and freedom from their lords. There were various pressures on Russian serfs during the 18th century, which induced them to follow Pugachev. The peasantry in Russia were no longer bound to the land, but tied to their owner. The connecting links that had existed between the peasant community and the tsar, which had been diminishing, was broken by the interposition of the serf owners; these private lords or agents of the Church or state who owned the land blocked serfs' access to the political authority. Many nobles returned to their estates after 1762 and imposed harsher rules on their peasants. The relationship between peasant and ruler was cut off most dramatically in the decree of 1767, which completely prohibited direct petitions to the empress from the peasantry. The peasants were also subject to an increase in indirect taxes due to the increase in the state's requirements. In addition, a strong inflationary trend resulted in higher prices on all goods.Forster, Preconditions of Revolution p 165-72. The peasants felt abandoned by the \\"modern\\" state. They were living in desperate circumstances and had no way to change their situation, having lost all possibilities for political redress. There were natural disasters in Russia during the 18th century, which also added strain on the peasants. Frequent recurrence of crop failures, plagues and epidemics created economic and social instability. The most dramatic was the 1771 epidemic in Moscow, which brought to the surface all the unconscious and unfocused fears and panics of the populace.Forster, Preconditions of Revolution p 169. Each ruler altered the position of the Church, which created more pressure. Peter the Great gave the Church new obligations, while its administration assimilated to a department of the secular state. The Church's resources, or the means of collection, could not meet the new obligations and as a consequence, they heavily exploited and poorly administered their serfs. The unrest spurred constant revolt among Church serfs. Leadership and strategy Pugachev's image according to folk memory and contemporary legends was one of a pretender-liberator. As Peter III, he was seen as Christ-like and saintly because he had meekly accepted his dethronement by his evil wife Catherine II and her courtiers. He had not resisted his overthrow, but had left to wander the world. He had come to help the revolt, but he did not initiate it; according to popular myth, the Cossacks and the people did that. The popular mythology of Peter III linked Pugachev with the Emancipation Manifesto of 1762 and the serf's expectations of further liberalizations had he continued as ruler. Pugachev offered freedom from the poll tax and the recruit-levy, which made him appear to follow in the same vein as the emperor he was impersonating. Yemelyan Pugachev Pugachev attempted to reproduce the St. Petersburg bureaucracy. He established his own College of War with quite extensive powers and functions. It is important to emphasize that he did not promise complete freedom from taxation and recruitment for the peasants; he granted only temporary relief. His perception of the state was one where soldiers took the role of Cossacks, meaning they were free, permanent, military servicemen. Pugachev placed all other military personnel into this category as well, even the nobles and officers who joined his ranks. All peasants were seen as servants of the state, they were to become state peasants and serve as Cossacks in the militia. Pugachev envisioned the nobles returning to their previous status as the czar's servicemen on salary instead of estate and serf owners. He emphasized the peasants’ freedom from the nobility. Pugachev still expected the peasants to continue their labor, but he granted them the freedom to work and own the land. They would also enjoy religious freedoms and Pugachev promised to restore the bond between the ruler and the people, eradicating the role of the noble as the intermediary. Under the guise of Peter III, Pugachev built up his own bureaucracy and army, which copied that of Catherine. Some of his top commanders took on the pseudonyms of dukes and courtiers. Zarubin Chaika, Pugachev's top commander, for example, took the guise of Zakhar Chernyshev. The army Pugachev established, at least at the very top levels of command, also mimicked Catherine's. The organizational structure Pugachev set up for his top command was extraordinary, considering Pugachev defected as an ensign from Catherine's army. He built up his own War College and a fairly sophisticated intelligence network of messengers and spies. Even though Pugachev was illiterate, he recruited the help of local priests, mullahs, and starshins to write and disseminate his \\"royal decrees\\" or ukases in Russian and Tatar languages. These ukazy were copied, sent to villages and read to the masses by the priests and mullahs. In these documents, he begged the masses to serve him faithfully. He promised to grant to those who followed his service land, salt, grain, and lowered taxes, and threatened punishment and death to those who didn't. For example, an excerpt from a ukase written in late 1773: Recruitment and support From the very beginning of the insurgency, Pugachev's generals carried out mass recruitment campaigns in Tatar and Bashkir settlements, with the instructions of recruiting one member from every or every other household and as many weapons as they could secure. He recruited not only Cossacks, but Russian peasants and factory workers, Tatars, Bashkirs, and Chuvash. Famous Bashkir hero Salawat Yulayev joined him. Pugachev's primary target for his campaign was not the people themselves, but their leaders. He recruited priests and mullahs to disseminate his decrees and read them to the masses as a way of lending them credence. Vasily Perov, Pugachev's Court (1879 variant; Russian Museum, Saint-Petersburg) Priests in particular were instrumental figures in carrying out Pugachev's propaganda campaigns. Pugachev was known to stage “heroic welcomes” whenever he entered a Russian village, in which he would be greeted by the masses as their sovereign. A few days before his arrival to a given city or village, messengers would be sent out to inform the priests and deacons in that town of his impending arrival. These messengers would request that the priests bring out salt and water and ring the church bells to signify his coming. The priests would also be instructed to read Pugachev's manifestos during mass and sing prayers to the health of the Great Emperor Peter III. Most priests, although not all, complied with Pugachev's requests. One secret report of Catherine's War College, for example, tells of one such priest, Zubarev, who recruited for Pugachev in Church under such orders. “[Zubarev], believing in the slander-ridden decree of the villainous-imposter, brought by the villainous Ataman Loshkarev, read it publicly before the people in church. And when that ataman brought his band, consisting of 100 men, to their Baikalov village, then that Zubarev met them with a cross and with icons and chanted prayers in the Church; and then at the time of service, as well as after, evoked the name of the Emperor Peter III for suffrage.” (Pugachevshchina Vol. 2, Document 86. Author's translation) Pugachev's army was composed of a diverse mixture of disaffected peoples in southern Russian society, most notably Cossacks, Bashkirs, homesteaders, religious dissidents (such as Old Believers) and industrial serfs. Pugachev was very much in touch with the local population's needs and attitudes; he was a Don Cossack and encountered the same obstacles as his followers. It is noticeable that Pugachev's forces always took routes that reflected the very regional and local concerns of the people making up his armies. For example, after the very first attack on Yaitsk, he turned not towards the interior, but instead turned east towards Orenburg which for most Cossacks was the most direct symbol of Russian oppression. The heterogeneous population in Russia created special problems for the government, and it provided opportunities for those opposing the state and seeking support among the discontented, as yet unassimilated natives. Each group of people had problems with the state, which Pugachev focused on in order to gain their support. Non-Russians, such as the Bashkirs, followed Pugachev because they were promised their traditional ways of life, freedom of their lands, water and woods, their faith and laws, food, clothing, salaries, weapons and freedom from enserfment. (Madariaga, 250) Cossacks were similarly promised their old ways of life, the rights to the river Iaik (now the Ural River) from source to sea, tax-free pasturage, free salt, twelve chetvi of corn and 12 roubles per Cossack per year. Map of the Pugachev's Rebellion Pugachev found ready support among the odnodvortsy (single homesteaders). In the westernmost part of the region swept by the Pugachev rebellion, the right bank of the middle Volga, there were a number of odnodvortsy. These were descendants of petty military servicemen who had lost their military function and declined to the status of small, but free, peasants who tilled their own lands. Many of them were also Old Believers, and so felt particularly alienated from the state established by Peter the Great. They were hard- pressed by landowners from central provinces who were acquiring the land in their area and settling their serfs on it. These homesteaders pinned their hopes on the providential leader who promised to restore their former function and status. The network of Old Believer holy men and hermitages served to propagandize the appearance of Pugachev as Peter III and his successes, and they also helped him recruit his first followers among the Old Believer Cossack of the Iaik. The Iaik Cossack host was most directly and completely involved in the Pugachev revolt. Most of its members were Old Believers who had settled among the Iaik River. The Cossacks opposed the tide of rational modernization and the institutionalization of political authority. They regarded their relationship to the ruler as a special and personal one, based on their voluntary service obligations. In return, they expected the czar's protection of their religion, traditional social organization, and administrative autonomy. They followed the promises of Pugachev and raised the standard of revolt in the hope of recapturing their previous special relationship and securing the government's respect for their social and religious traditions. Factory workers supported Pugachev because their situation had worsened; many state-owned factories had been turned over to private owners, which intensified exploitation. These private owners stood as a barrier between the workers and the government; they inhibited appeals to the state for improvement of conditions. Also, with the loss of Russia's competitive advantage on the world market, the production of the Ural mines and iron-smelting factories declined. This decline hit the workers the hardest because they had no other place to go or no other skill to market. There was enough material to support rebellion against the system. By and large the factories supported Pugachev, some voluntarily continuing to produce artillery and ammunition for the rebels. Challenge to the Russian state Pugachev in Kazan In 1773 Pugachev's army attacked Samara and occupied it. His greatest victory came with the taking of Kazan, by which time his captured territory stretched from the Volga to the Ural mountains. Though fairly well-organized for a revolt at the time, Pugachev's main advantage early on was the lack of seriousness about Pugachev's rebellion. Catherine the Great regarded the troublesome Cossack as a joke and put a small bounty of about 500 rubles on his head. But by 1774, the threat was more seriously addressed; by November the bounty was over 28,000 rubles. The Russian general Michelson lost many men due to a lack of transportation and discipline among his troops, while Pugachev scored several important victories. Pugachev launched the rebellion in mid-September 1773. He had a substantial force composed of Cossacks, Russian peasants, factory serfs, and non-Russians with which he overwhelmed several outposts along the Iaik and early in October went into the capital of the region, Orenburg. While besieging this fortress, the rebels destroyed one government relief expedition and spread the revolt northward into the Urals, westward to the Volga, and eastward into Siberia. Pugachev's groups were defeated in late March and early April 1774 by a second relief corps under General Bibikov, but Pugachev escaped to the southern Urals, Baskiria, where he recruited new supporters. Then, the rebels attacked the city of Kazan, burning most of it on July 23, 1774. Though beaten three times at Kazan by tsarist troops, Pugachev escaped by the Volga, and gathered new forces as he went down the west bank of the river capturing main towns. On September 5, 1774, Pugachev failed to take Tsaritsyn and was defeated in the steppe below that town. His closest followers betrayed him to the authorities. After a prolonged interrogation, Pugachev was publicly executed in Moscow on . Indigenous involvement Pugachev's vague rhetoric inspired not only Cossacks and peasants to fight, but also indigenous tribes on the eastern frontier. These indigenous groups made up a comparatively small portion of those in revolt, but their role cannot be underestimated. Each group had a distinct culture and history, which meant that their reasons for following Pugachev were different. Bashkir riders from the Ural steppes The Mordovians, Mari, Udmurts, and Chuvash (from the Volga and Kama basin) for example, joined the revolt because they were upset by Russian attempts to convert them to Orthodoxy. These groups lived within Russia's borders, but held onto their language and culture. During the Pugachev Rebellion, these natives responded by assassinating Orthodox clergy members. Because the natives professed allegiance to Pugachev, the rebel leader had no choice but to implicitly condone their actions as part of his rebellion.Bodger, Alan. “Nationalities in History: Soviet Historiography and the Pugačëvščina.” Jahrbücher für Geschichte Osteuropas, Vol. 39, No. 4 (1991): 563. The Tatars (from the Volga and Kama basin) were the indigenous group with the most complex political structure. They were most closely associated with Russian culture because they had lived within the Empire's borders since the 16th century. Many Tatars owned land or managed factories. As more integrated members of the Russian empire, the Tatars rebelled in objection to the poll tax and their military and service obligations. The Tatars were closely associated with the Cossacks and were a crucial part of Pugachev's recruitment efforts. As a group, the Bashkirs had the most unified involvement in the rebellion. The Bashkirs were nomadic herdsman, angered by newly arrived Russian settlers who threatened their way of life. Russians built factories and mines, began farming on the Bashkir's former land, and tried to get the Bashkirs to abandon their nomadic life and become farmers too. When fighting broke out, Bashkir village leaders preached that involvement in the rebellion would end Russian colonialism, and give the Bashkirs the political autonomy and cultural independence they desired. The Bashkirs were crucial to Pugachev's rebellion. Some of the memorable leaders of the rebellion, like Salavat Yulaev were Bashkirs, and historian Alan Bodger argues that the rebellion might have died in the beginning stages were it not for the Bashkir's involvement. But important to note is in spite of their integral role, Bashkirs fought for different reasons than many of the Cossacks and peasants, and sometimes their disparate objectives disrupted Pugachev's cause. There are accounts of Bashkirs, upset over their lost land, taking peasant land for themselves. Bashkirs also raided factories, showing their aggression towards Russian expansion and industrialization. Pugachev thought that these raids were ill-advised and not helpful towards his cause. Rebels While the Bashkirs had a clear unified role in the rebellion, the Buddhist Kalmyks and Muslim Kazakhs, neighboring Turkic tribes in the steppe, were involved in a more fragmented way. The Kazakhs were nomadic herdsman like the Bashkirs, and were in constant struggle with neighboring indigenous groups and Russian settlers over land. Pugachev tried hard to get Kazakh leaders to commit to his cause, but leaders like Nur-Ali would not do so fully. Nur-Alit engaged in talks with both Pugachev's and Tsarist forces, helping each only when it was advantageous for him. The Kazakhs mostly took advantage of the rebellion's chaos to take back land from Russian peasants and Bashkir and Kalmyk natives. Historian John T. Alexander argues that these raids, though not directly meant to help Pugachev, ultimately did help by adding to the chaos that the Imperial forces had to deal with.Bodger, Alan. “Nationalities in History: Soviet Historiography and the Pugačëvščina.” Jahrbücher für Geschichte Osteuropas, Vol. Bd. 39, No. 4 (1991): 564. The early Volga German settlements were attacked during the Pugachev uprising. According to Darrel P. Kaiser, \\"Kazakh- Kirghiz tribesmen kidnapped 1573 settlers from colonies in 1774 alone and only half were successfully ransomed. The rest were killed or enslaved.\\" The Kalmyks role in the rebellion was not unified either, but historians disagree about how to classify their actions. Historian Alan Bodger argues that the Kalmyk's role was minimal. They helped both sides in the conflict, but not in a way that changed the results. John T. Alexander argues that the Kalmyks were a significant factor in the rebel's initial victories. He cites the Kalmyk campaign led by II’ia Arapov which, though defeated, caused a total uproar and pushed the rebellion forward in the Stavropol region.John T. Alexander, The Emperor of the Cossacks (Lawrence, Kan: Colorado Press, 1973), 100. Defeat Pugachev's execution on Bolotnaya Square. By late 1774 the tide was turning, and the Russian army's victory at Tsaritsyn left 9,000-10,000 rebels dead. Russian General Panin's savage reprisals, after the capture of Penza, completed their discomfiture. By early September, the rebellion was crushed. Yemelyan Pugachev was betrayed by his own Cossacks when he tried to flee in mid-September 1774. He was beheaded and dismembered on 21 January 1775, in Moscow. After the revolt, Catherine cut Cossack privileges further and set up more garrisons across Russia. Provinces became more numerous, certain political powers were broken up and divided among various agencies, and elected officials were introduced. Assessments The popular interpretation of the insurgency was that Pugachev's men followed him out of the desire to free themselves from the oppression of Catherine's reign of law. However, there are documents from Pugachev's war college and eye witness accounts that contradict this theory. While there were many who believed Pugachev to be Peter III and that he would emancipate them from Catherine's harsh taxes and policies of serfdom, there were many groups, particularly of Bashkir and Tatar ethnicity, whose loyalties were not so certain. In January 1774, for example, Bashkir and Tatar generals led an attack on the City of Kungur. During the revolt the nomadic Kazakhs took the opportunity to raid the Russian settlements.NUPI - Centre for Russian Studies Pugachev's troops suffered from a lack of food and gunpowder. Many fighters deserted, including one general who left the battle and took his entire unit with him. One general wrote in a report to his superior, V. I. Tornova, \\"For the sake of your eminence, we humbly request that our Naigabitskiaia Fortress be returned to us with or without a detachment, because there is not a single Tatar or Bashkir detachment, since they have all fled, and the starshins, who have dispersed to their homes, are presently departing for the Naigabanskaia fortress.\\" (Dokumenty i Stavki E. I. Pugacheva, povstancheskikh vlastei i ucherezhdenii, 1773-1774. Moskva, Nauka, 1975. Document number 195. Author's translation) Soviet stamp, 1973 The concept of freedom was applied to the movement in regard to being free from the nobility. A peasant was to be free to work and own the land he worked. Pugachev's followers idealized a static, simple society where a just ruler guaranteed the welfare of all within the framework of a universal obligation to the sovereign. The ruler ought to be a father to his people, his children; and power should be personal and direct, not institutionalized and mediated by land- or serf owner. Such a frame of mind may also account for the strong urge to take revenge on the nobles and officials, on their modern and evil way of life. Pugachev's followers were particularly frightened by apparent economic and social changes. They wished to recapture the old ideals of service and community in a hierarchy ordained by God. They needed a palpable sense of direct relationship with the source of sovereign power. The Cossacks were most keenly aware of the loss of their special status and direct contact with the czar and his government. The Imperial government endeavored to keep the matter of the rebellion strictly secret or, failing that, to portray it as a minor outbreak that would soon be quelled. The absence of an independent Russian press at the time, particularly in the provinces, meant that foreigners could read only what the government chose to print in the two official papers, or whatever news they could obtain from correspondents in the interior. (Alexander, 522) Russian government undertook to propagate in the foreign press its own version of events and directed its representatives abroad to play down the revolt. The Russian government favored the use of manifestos to communicate with the people of Russia. Catherine thought that exhortations to abandon him would excite popular antipathy for his cause and elicit divisions within rebel ranks. Her printed pronouncements were widely distributed in the turbulent areas; they were read on the public squares and from the parish pulpits. In the countryside local authorities were instructed to read them to gatherings of the people, who were then required to sign the decree. These government proclamations produced little positive effect. They actually added more confusion and even provoked unrest when the peasantry refused to believe or sign them. Much of the blame for the spread of the insurrection must be laid on the local authorities in Russia. “They were lax, timid, and indecisive; their countermeasures were belated, futile, and lost lives needlessly.” Catherine herself recognized this assessment. As Catherine said “I consider the weak conduct of civil and military officials in various localities to be as injurious to the public welfare as Pugachev and the rabble he has collected.” The weakness could not have been entirely the fault of the officials. The local bureaucracy in Russia was too remote and too inefficient to adequately deal with even the most basic administrative matters. Pugachev's success in holding out against suppression for over a year proved to be a powerful incentive for future reforms. It made apparent to the government several problems with their treatment of the provinces. They were left weakly controlled and consequently, susceptible to outbreaks of peasant violence. The most crucial lesson Catherine II drew from the Pugachev rebellion, was the need for a firmer military grasp on all parts of the Empire, not just the external frontiers. For instance, when the governor of the Kazan guberniya called for assistance against the approaching Pugachev, there was no force available to relieve him. The revolt did occur at a sensitive point in time for the Russian government because many of their soldiers and generals were already engaged in a difficult war on the southern borders with Ottoman Turkey. However, the professional army available outside the gates of Kazan to counter the Cossack-based army of Pugachev only consisted of 800 men.

While traveling he is lost in a snowstorm, where he encounters a stranger who guides him to safety. He gratefully gives the stranger his fur coat and they part ways when the storm ends. Later his outpost is attacked by Pugachev's forces, led by the stranger - who turns out to be Pugachev himself. Pugachev, impressed with the young man's integrity, offers him a place in his army. The officer has to choose between loyalty to his commission or following the charismatic Pugachev. * Tempest (1958 film) An adaptation of The Captain's Daughter produced by Dino de Laurentis and directed by Alberto Lattuada.

It is located to the east of Tortola, and the two islands are connected by the Queen Elizabeth Bridge. Beef Island is the site of the Terrance B. Lettsome International Airport (IATA code EIS), the main commercial airport that serves Tortola and the rest of the British Virgin Islands. Trellis Bay is a short walk east of the airport. Trellis Bay is a small town, with a market, a restaurant, a coffee shop, local craftshops and a beach. Long Bay is west of the airport. Development controversy In 2007, a major development on Beef Island was delayed after challenges from an environmental group called the British Virgin Islands Heritage Conservation Group. A five-star hotel with a golf course and marina was proposed for development near Hans Creek, on the south east side of the island. After a judicial review the British Virgin Islands court ordered the project suspended. The controversy started in October 2006 when the Chief Minister of the British Virgin Islands, Dr. Orlando Smith, decided to approve the construction of a hotel on the island of Tortola, which is connected to Beef Island by the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge. Despite complaints at a public meeting held by the planning committee on January24 2007, construction plans remained the same. Some of the local reasoning against the construction of the hotel included dangers to island habitats such as the salt pond, coral reef, and mangroves; fears of contaminating the local water supply; increased traffic; and overcrowding. On January31, 2007, the Chief Minister approved construction of another hotel, the Beef Island five-star development. This approval was questionable because Hans Creek is a location that the Virgin Islands Fisheries Regulations had marked as protected, making it illegal to develop anything that would harmfully affect the environment. Fearing this potentially illegal development, activist groups on the island came together to combine their resources and created VIEC, the Virgin Islands Environmental Council. Initially VIEC led small demonstrations in which they went to the proposed construction sites, collected signatures and talked to other locals about the possible harmful effects that could result from the construction. In July VIEC collected 18,000 signatures in support of their efforts from people around the world and presented it to local government agencies. Later in 2007 tactics shifted from protests and demonstrations to focusing on legal proceedings against the government for giving permission to build in a protected location. News articles reported that the legal fight has been inspired by the similar fight on Great Guana Cay, in the Bahamas. The legal action was funded by donations, mainly made by Sir Richard Branson, the owner of two islands in the British Virgin Islands and of Virgin Atlantic Airlines. In 2008 VIEC received additional legal and financial support from the Ocean River Institute, an organization based in the United States. On September23, 2009, coincidentally the international day of peace, VIEC won its lawsuit against the government in the High Court. The Judge ruled that the Beef Island development project was illegally given permission by the Prime Minister to develop at Hans Creek. It was deemed illegal because the development planned was considered harmful development and at Hans Creek, under the Fisheries Regulations, harmful development is illegal. This victory did not last long. On August12, 2011, the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court of Appeal decided that the ruling made in 2009 by the High Court was invalid because Hans Creek had not been correctly made a protected area. This meant that the original planning permission given to the Beef Island Development Project was legal.

It includes selected first-hand accounts, orders, reports, maps, diagrams, and correspondence drawn from official records of both Union and Confederate armies.  History  Collection of the records began in 1864; no special attention was paid to Confederate records until just after the capture of Richmond, Virginia, in 1865, when with the help of Confederate Gen. Samuel Cooper, Union Army Chief of Staff Maj. Gen. Henry W. Halleck began the task of collecting and preserving such archives of the Confederacy as had survived the war. In 1866 a joint resolution of Congress authorized the compilation and publication under auspices of the War Department. Eventually, seventeen Secretaries of War were involved in the process. In 1877, Army Captain Robert N. Scott was appointed by the Secretary of War as director of the Publications Office, War Records. (Scott's name appears in each volume as the preparer, listed with the rank of brevet lieutenant colonel, 3rd U.S. Artillery.)Sauers, p. 2060.  Structure and content  The original title for the records was The Official Records of the War of the Rebellion and they were later renamed The War of the Rebellion: a Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies, which has led to some lasting controversy over the official name for the war. As finally published, the records consist of 138,579 pages with 1,006 maps and diagrams assembled in 128 books,Sauers, p. 2061. Although the volumes are numbered as high as 130, volume numbers 112 and 113 were reserved for a more extensive index of Series I that was never published. organized as 70 volumes grouped in four series, published between 1881 and 1901. Each of the four series of books in the compilation is divided into \\"volumes\\" numbered from the beginning of the series with Roman numerals. In series II, III, and IV each \\"volume\\" coincides with a book. In series I, however, it was found to be usually impracticable, beginning with volume X, to confine \\"volumes,\\" as units of content, within single books. Volume X and most subsequent volumes in series I were therefore issued in \\"parts\\" distinguished by subsidiary Roman numerals, each occupying a separate book. Beginning with volume XXIV, Arabic \\"serial numbers\\" were also printed on the backs of the books issued, although these numbers were not included on the title pages, and are therefore not universally used in citations.National Archives M1026, p. 9. ; Series I — Military OperationsContent descriptions from National Archives M1026, p. 7. : Formal reports, both Union and Confederate, of the first seizures of United States property in the southern States, and of all military operations in the field, with the correspondence, orders, and returns relating specially thereto (Serial Nos. 1-111) ; Series II — Prisoners : Correspondence, orders, reports, and returns, Union and Confederate, relating to prisoners of war and (so far as the military authorities were concerned) to State or political prisoners (Serial Nos. 114-121) ; Series III — Union Authorities : Correspondence, orders, reports, and returns of the Union authorities (including their correspondence with the Confederate officials) not relating specifically to the subjects of series I and II. It includes the annual and special reports of the Secretary of War, of the General-in-Chief, and of the chiefs of the several staff corps and departments; the calls for troops and the correspondence between the National and the several State authorities (Serial Nos. 122-126) ; Series IV — Confederate Authorities : Correspondence, orders, reports, and returns of the Confederate authorities, similar to the Union material in series III, but excluding the correspondence between the Union and Confederate authorities given in that series (Serial Nos. 127-129) A final comprehensive index (Serial No. 130) was published in 1901 with remaining additions and corrections. A companion volume, the Atlas to Accompany the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies, was published in 1895. It included maps of military operations (175 plates), a topographic map of the area of operations (26 plates), and some drawings of weapons, uniforms, insignia, and flags.Sauers, p. 2061. In 1966, the U.S. National Archives began publication of a five-volume set that comprised an arguably superior index to the Army ORs, Military Operations of the Civil War: A Guide Index to the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies, 1861-1865, microfilm publication M1026. Introductory material to the guide- index offers guidance to readers of the ORs: Because of the enormous volume of material, the lengthy time period of collection and publication, and the constant and continuing process of correction by veterans of both sides still living contemporaneously, the records are perhaps the most intensely peer- reviewed documents in historical publication. Historians have argued that some of the modifications made years after the events have decreased the accuracy of the records and were made simply to enhance personal reputations (or to denigrate the reputations of rivals). An additional 100 volumes of previously unpublished reports and correspondence were published by the Broadfoot Publishing Company of Wilmington, North Carolina, from 1995 to 1999, entitled Supplement to the Official Records Of the Union and Confederate Armies.

Further reading  While the Official Records are probably the most-used of all primary sources for historical research on the Civil War, there are other contemporary published works that provide well- sourced insights not constrained by the types of sources compiled by government: ; Southern Historical Society Papers : Published in 52 volumes from 1869 to the 1950s by the Southern Historical Society, includes reminiscences and analyses of war experiences by Confederate veterans. ; Battles and Leaders of the Civil War : A series of articles published between 1884 and 1887 in The Century Magazine and then assembled into a four-volume set of books, includes battle studies by Union and Confederate commanders of all ranks, from Ulysses S. Grant down to company officers. (In the 1990s, additional related material was compiled into two more volumes.) Accounts are usually first-hand and often written by an officer actually in command in a subject engagement or campaign.

He became an anti-war activist after his 20-year-old eldest son Lance Corporal Alexander Arredondo died in action during Iraq War in 2004. Death of first son Arredondo's first wife, Victoria Foley, gave birth to the couple's two sons, Marine Lance Corporal Alexander Scott Arredondo and Brian Luis Arredondo. Alexander Scott and Brian Luis were born in Boston, Massachusetts and raised on South Street in Jamaica Plain, Boston. After the couple divorced, both sons lived with their mother. Alexander graduated from the Blue Hills Regional Technical School, Canton in 2002 and joined the US Marines the same year. Alexander Scott was killed in Najaf, Iraq, during his second tour of duty in Operation Iraqi Freedom on August 25, 2004. Later that day, which was Carlos Arredondo's 44th birthday, the Marines Corps Casualty Assistance Team arrived at the Arredondo home in Hollywood, Florida, to notify the family of their son's death. The Marines had not brought a chaplain with them and spoke with Arredondo in the front yard of his home. Arredondo was distressed by the news, and became upset and agitated when the Marines refused to leave. After some time went by, according to news reports, Arredondo was so distraught that he grabbed a hammer and proceeded to destroy the Marines' van. He then grabbed gasoline and climbed in the Marines' van and splashed gasoline inside the van. A propane torch he had brought inside was lit accidentally, Arredondo said. Arredondo was pulled out to safety by the Marines; however, his clothes had caught fire and burned 26% of his body. He received second- and third-degree burns. He was hospitalized in a burn unit for two weeks followed by outpatient home-based treatment. Despite his burns, he attended his son's funeral on a stretcher with two paramedics at his side. Arredondo and his wife Melida both spent time as inpatient psychiatric patients. The incident is highlighted in the documentary film The Prosecution of an American President, directed by Dave Hagen and David J. Burke. Arredondo and his wife Melida traveled to Hollywood to speak at a screening for the film at the Arclight theater in October, 2012. Arredondo, who once was an illegal (undocumented) immigrant and is now a US citizen is originally from Costa Rica. At the time he had no insurance and was self- employed working as a handyman. His story made national and international headlines. His recovery took over a year. Since that time he apologized to the Marines for his drastic actions. He was not prosecuted. His son was also awarded Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal with combat \\"V\\" and the Purple Heart for his services during the battle. Activism Arredondo along with his second wife Melida were members of the now defunct organization Gold Star Families For Peace whose mission stated: Arredondo and his wife Mélida became activists for peace and have had speaking engagements around the country speaking about his personal tragedy and to parents about the methods recruiters use to enlist youth. He especially works to reach out to the Spanish-speaking community. The Arredondos requested during Mitt Romney's governorship to have flags placed at half-staff upon the death of a Massachusetts native related to his or her war injuries in 2005, a wish that Alex had when he noticed after his first deployment how the public was not noticing the war deaths. They have also lobbied for families' decisions to allow press to cover the arrival of their troops' remains from the combat zone, a statute from George Bush, Sr.'s administration. On December 12, 2006, Arredondo became a U.S citizen, with the help of U.S. Senator Edward Kennedy. He became eligible for citizenship under USCIS INA 329A which allowed parents of those killed in action to become US citizens. He legally changed his name to Alexander Brian Arredondo upon receiving his citizenship. During a daytime peaceful anti-war protest on September 15, 2007, Arredondo was physically assaulted by a mob of counter protesters. The assailants followed Arredondo as he pulled his son's memorial, purposely yelling epithets and eventually seizing a photo of Alex from the casket. An attempt to retrieve his dead son's photo provoked the men to kick Arredondo in the head, legs, stomach and back. Police defused the situation before major damage could be inflicted. In August 2011, a federal post office at 655 Centre St in Jamaica Plain, Boston, a neighborhood where his son grew up, was renamed \\"Lance Corporal Alexander Scott Arredondo, United States Marine Corps Post Office Building\\" following legislation proposed by US Representative Michael E. Capuano and co-sponsored by nine other legislators, and later signed by the President in January 2011. Brian Arredondo On December 19, 2011, Arredondo's surviving son, Brian, died by suicide after battling depression and drug addiction ever since his brother's death. He was 24 years old at the time. Since Brian's death, the Arredondos have dedicated themselves to attending suicide groups sessions and conferences, especially related to military-related suicides. Both have worked with elected officials in the City of Boston and Commonwealth of Massachusetts to change systems regarding suicide policy. Boston Marathon bombing On April 15, 2013 Arredondo attended the 2013 Boston Marathon. At around 2:50 p.m. EDT (18:50 UTC), two bombs were detonated during the race in Copley Square, just before the finish line. Arredondo immediately sprinted into action and he can be seen in a series of photos and videos of the aftermath pulling debris and fencing away from the bloody victims, clearing the way for emergency personnel to tend to their wounds. He saw Jeff Bauman, missing both of his legs and losing blood rapidly. Arredondo lifted Bauman and put him into a wheelchair, and when the fabric used as a tourniquet kept getting caught in the wheels, Arredondo held the fabric out of the way. In an iconic photograph Carlos Arredondo with his cowboy hat is helping rush Jeff Bauman, to an ambulance. He remains in touch with the victims of the bombings, including Jeff Bauman. Arredondo was a spectator of the race, there to support and cheer on members of the National Guard Tough Ruck group, who were running to raise money for families of fallen service members and raise awareness about suicide. A soldier was running in honor of his two deceased sons.

Founded in 1635, the PPCU is one of Hungary's oldest and most prestigious institutions of higher education. The Faculty of Theology was established by archbishop Péter Pázmány in Nagyszombat, the Kingdom of Hungary (today Trnava, Slovakia) in 1635. The university is located in three cities: the Rectors' Office, the Faculty of Theology, the Faculty of Law, the Faculty of Information Technology, and the Postgraduate Institute of Canon-Law are located in Budapest. The campus of the Vitéz János Faculty of Teaching is in Esztergom, around the Esztergom Basilica. The campus of the Faculty of Humanities is in Piliscsaba, in the vicinity of Budapest. The university has several research groups and institutes. One of the most important international research programmes of the university is the Syro-Hungarian Archeological Mission, which does the restoration of Margat's crusader fortress. Nearly 8.000 students attend the university, enrolled in several Bachelor, Master, and PhD programmes. International cooperations include the Erasmus programme and bilateral agreements. It was named in 2009 as one of the most active members of the Erasmus programme. It is a co-establisher of the International Research Universities Network and has strong connections with Radboud University Nijmegen, Catholic University of Leuven, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana in Bogota, Saint Louis University and University of Notre Dame.

Stephaneum, the main building of the Faculty of Humanities Faculty of Humanities The Faculty of Humanities was established by the Hungarian Catholic Bishops' Conference on 30 January 1992. The government of Hungary accepted it on 25 May 1993. It is in the town of Piliscsaba. The campus was created from a Soviet barrack, on 220,000 m². As it is situated in a nature reserve, only pavilion-like buildings were allowed to be built which did not interfere with the landscape's harmony. Its buildings were designed by the group of Imre Makovecz and it has become an architectural landmark. The campus has a train station (since 1995) and a bus stop (since 1996); it is accessible from Budapest centre in less than an hour. Most of its students commute on a daily basis, but it has dormitories for the other students at the venue and in the town. Faculty of Theology Pázmány established the University in Nagyszombat on 12 May 1635. It was approved by Emperor Ferdinand II on 8 October in the same year the inauguration ceremony took place on 13 November 1635. The theological faculty is now located at Veres Pálné u. 24, Budapest H-1053. Because of its Jesuit links, the newly opened university was based on the Official Plan for Jesuit Education, or Ratio studiorum, which had been laid down on 8 January 1599. Pázmány was also influenced by Roman and Austrian structures of higher education. The Faculty of Theology first moved to Buda and then to Pest. It was separated from the rest of the Pázmány Péter Science University in 1950 by the state and was able to continue her mission under the name of Roman Catholic Central Theological Academy. The authorization of the Institute to give an academic degree in Sacred Theology (baccalaureatus, licentiatus, laureatus [doctoratus]) in the name of the Holy See during this time remained, while the diploma was also recognized by the state. The classical five (baccalaureatus) plus two (licentiatus) plus one (doctoratus) years (the last two together is recognized as a PhD instruction by the state) Sacred Theology teaching program which is recognized by the Holy See is built on twelve departments: * Department of Fundamental Theology; * Department of Systematic Christian Philosophy; * Department of History of Philosophy; * Department of Old Testament Studies; * Department of New Testament Studies; * Department of Dogmatic Theology; * Department of Moral Theology; * Department of Liturgy and Pastoral Theology; * Department of Patristic History and Literature; * Department of Medieval and Modern Ecclesiastical History; * Department of Canon Law; * Department of Biblical Languages. The departments do research work as part of the Theological Doctorate School. They also do teaching activity within the fields of mission of the Catholic Church. Serving this purpose, the Faculty has Bachelor programs to form Managers of Catholic Communities, Catechetic and Pastoral Assistants; there are also Master programs to form teachers of religion and Catholic Canon lawyers. When political change happened in Hungary in 1990, the name of the faculty was changed to Pázmány Péter Roman Catholic Theological Academy as an independent university. It became a basis for the new Catholic university of Budapest which has today five flourishing faculties and one institute with faculty rights (i.e. Canon Law Institute). Every educational program of this ancient Theological Faculty of the Pázmány Péter Catholic University has received official state accreditation by the Hungarian Higher Educational Accreditation Committee, which has already accredited the entire university, including the Faculty of Theology, twice, most recently in 2010. Institute of Canon Law The Institute of Canon Law \\"ad instar facultatis\\" (Institute with faculty rights) was established by the Holy See on 30 November 1996. Canon law means the internal own law of the Catholic Church that applies to everyone baptized in the Catholic Church as well as to those who have joined the community of the Church. According to the ecclesiastical authorization the institute can issue baccalaureate, licenciate and doctorate academic degree in canon law. The Hungarian State acknowledges the baccalaureate degree in canon law – based on the Bologna-System – as an MA degree, as well as the doctorate in canon law as a Ph.D. The team of professors – Anzelm Szabolcs Szuromi O.Praem., Géza Kuminetz, Péter Szabó, Catherine Hársfai, George Lefkánits, Blazio Schanda, Csaba Szilágyi, and Philippe Gudenus – organize courses in canonical fields in Hungarian and in other languages (Italian, German, English). The Institute of Canon Law “ad instar facultatis” undertakes scholarly research. To fulfill this aim the institute organizes a yearly international colloquia every February. It publishes an international canon law review Folia Canonica in the main western European languages (from 1998, from 2012: Folia Theologica et Canonica), but also a Hungarian review, i.e. Kánonjog (from 1999); furthermore, a book series, i.e. Bibliotheca Instituti Postgradualis Iuris Canonici Universitatis Catholicae de Petro Pázmány nominatae, which includes four sub-series. In 2001 the institute organized the \\"Eleventh International Congress of the Consociatio Internationalis Studio Iuris Canonici Promovendo and the Fifteenth of the Società per il Diritto delle Chiese Orientali. Also the university Institute of Canon Law hosted the XIIIth International Congress of Medieval Canon Law, which took place in the St. Adalbert Teaching and Research Center of Esztergom in 2008. The research fields of the faculty are ecclesiastical law; theology of canon law; general norms of canon law; constitutional law of the Church; liturgical law; Catholic marriage law; canonical norms of sacraments and sacramentals; canonical process law; canonical penal law; canon law of Eastern Churches; Medieval ius commune and canon law history. The institute was decorated with the title of “Doctor Honoris Causa” Urbano Navarrete Cortes S.J. on 2 May 2000, one of the most significant 20th century canon lawyer, who worked for the renewal of the canonical knowledge in Hungary in the Eighties and died on 22 November 2010. The Canon Law Institute was enriched on 5 May 2011 with two new honorary doctors, i.e. José Tomás Martin de Agar and Bronisław Wenanty Zubert OFM. Faculty of Information Technology and Bionics The Faculty of Information Technology was established by the Hungarian Catholic Bishops' Conference on 24 June 1998. The government of Hungary accepted it on 20 July 2001. It was renamed to Faculty of Information Technology and Bionics on May 1, 2013, effective as of September 1, 2013. It's located in Budapest. Faculty of Law and Political Sciences The Faculty of Law and Political Sciences was established on 3 April 1995. It is located in Budapest. Vitéz János Faculty of Teaching The Vitéz János Teaching College was founded on 3 November 1842, and integrated in the Pázmány Péter Catholic University as Vitéz János Faculty on 1 January 2008. It is in the city of Esztergom. The campus is around the Esztergom Basilica. Its Practicing School has been working since 31 August 1893. =Collegium Hungaricum= The Collegium Hungaricum (officially Collegium Hungaricum Lovaniense, the former Home Cardinal Mindszenty) is a house for Hungarian university students, researchers and teachers in the city of Leuven (25 km from Bruxelles), at the Blijde Inkomstraat 18. The owner of the building is the Hungarian Province of the Jesuit Order, but the maintainer is the Pázmány Péter Catholic University. =Research=Hungarian Bionic Vision Center The goal of the Hungarian Bionic Vision Center is to restore vision of visually impaired patients to the maximum extent and to improve the quality of their lives through using medical and technological aids. They run programmes to study medical and engineering technologies. Homepage: lataskozpont.itk.ppke.hu Robot Lab The RobotLab is to apply ideas inspired by Biology using Information Technologies. How is it possible to design better prosthesis? Can neurobiology help to develop new remote control robots for helicopters? Can a biped be taught to walk in a similar way as we learned our balancing and moving patterns? What is the functional connection between visual and tactile sensing? These are some questions which are addressed by the Rotob Lab. Homepage: robotlab.itk.ppke.hu Ányos Jedlik Research and Development Laboratory The Jedlik Laboratories is a science-education-technology center where the advantages of multidisciplinary work is emphasized in emerging fields of science and technology. In the beginning the key areas were info-bionics and sensor-computing, telepresence and language technologies. Nano–bio technology, VLSI IC design are other areas of research. Other topics of the center's research are life sciences, in particular the neurosciences, genetics and immunology as well as the field of nanoscale engineering and molecular bionics, nanoscale technologies, sensor-computing, telepresence, integrated communication and ad-hoc mobile networks, bio-compatible interfaces, as well as \\"smart\\" energ0y saving devices and integrated nano–micro systems. The Jedlik Laboratories is organized within the Faculty of Information Technology in cooperation with the institutes of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (HAS), namely the Computer and Automation Research Institute, the Research Institute for Experimental Medicine, the Neurobiology Research Unit at the Semmelweis University of Medicine of the HAS, the Research Institute of Technical Physics and Material Science, the Research Institute of Psychology, the Institute of Enzymology of the Biology Research Center of the HAS, the Richter Gedeon Co., the Ericsson Hungary Ltd., and a few SMEs. The cooperating international research laboratories are listed in the International relations section. Homepage: Jedlik Laboratories Biomicrofluidics Research Group The Biomicrofluidics Research group works on the development of point-of-care (POC) diagnostic devices, optofluidic and digital microfluidic (DMF) platforms. This includes theory, numerical modeling, design, fabrication, test and different applications. Their main area of focus is microfluidic devices for biomedical applications. The point-of-care diagnostic project focuses on the continuous observation and monitoring of biological liquids, e.g., veterinary or human blood samples. The integration and interplay between optical and fluidic functionalities defines the emerging field of optofluidics. Microfluidics enables the realization of lab-on-a-chip (LOC) devices in connection with CNN-UM based camera systems. Thus, the obtained biomedical liquid analyzer can recognize cells and particles in the sample flow in real-time. The Research Group's digital microfluidic (DMF) platform is based the electrowetting-on-dielectrics (EWOD) phenomenon; they are working on clinical applications of this. The biological fluid droplets can be moved by electric field on a superhydrophobic surface. Droplet mainulations allow for parallel and multi-reagent analysis. Homepage: en.ufluidics.bionics.hu/ Research Centre for Competitive Law It was established in 2006, at the Faculty of Law and Political Sciences. Its fields are organizing scientific conferences, publishing scientific papers, to spread the culture of competition. Homepage (Hungarian): www.versenyjog.com Syro-Hungarian archeological mission: margat excavations The Syro-Hungarian Archeological mission is a research programme of the Pázmány Péter Catholic University. Its objective is to restore the Fortress of Margat, which is the largest crusader fortress of the Middle East, and to put under discussion the era of the crusades in the Middle East. The head of the mission is archeologist Balázs Major. The huge, 5.2-acre fortress is related to Hungary not only because of this expedition. In 1218 King Andrew II of Hungary visited the fortress protected by the Johannite Order and contributed an annual sum of 1000 silver marks for its upkeep. According to Balázs Major, \\"the most sensational discovery must be the mural found in the chapel.\\" This is the largest crusader mural unearthed in the Holy Land, and it is unique from an iconographical aspect, as well. Avicenna Institute of Middle Eastern Studies The Avicenna Institute is a non-profit research center with the objectives of promoting scholarship in the field of Middle Eastern studies. In this framework, several senior and junior researchers and fellows are assuming and pursuing those aims. Among the projects are organizing public and international scientific workshops and conferences, publishing scientific monographs, conferences’ proceedings, granting scholarship for junior researches. It has connections with Hungarian and international research centres, such as Pazmany Peter Catholic University, Saint Joseph University, Beirut and Università degli Studi di Napoli \\"L'Orientale\\". The institute was founded to conduct research for an understanding of Arabic, Persian and Turkish cultures; to advise decision- makers, media-actors and businessmen interested in Middle-East issues; to disseminate knowledge on current topics in on-going public debates to avoid misunderstandings in intercultural dialogue. The institute works on several projects: * study the factors of continuity and discontinuity in Islamic legacy in the perspective of understanding the current development in the Islamic world, mainly in philosophy, theology, political sciences and literature, classical and modern, * organizing public and international scientific workshops and conferences to disseminate knowledge, * publishing scientific monographs, conferences’ proceedings, * granting scholarship for junior researches in PhD or post-doctoral dissertations.http://www.euromedalex.org/fr/node/4225 Notable peopleHonorary doctors= * Max van der Stoel, the first High Commissioner on National Minorities of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (24 November 1999) * Urbano Navarrete SJ, Cardinal, professor of Canon Law and former rector of the Pontifical Gregorian University (2.May 2000)) * Paul Poupard, Cardinal, former president of the Pontifical Council for Culture and also of the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue (1 March 2001) * Bartholomew I, archbishop of Constantinople, Ecumenical Patriarch (25 April 2001)http://www.katolikus.hu/news/20010426.html *Franciszek Macharski, Cardinal, former Archbishop of Kraków (22.

The image is widely venerated by Brazilian Catholics, who consider her as the principal patroness of Brazil. Historical accounts state that the statue was originally found by three fishermen who miraculously caught many fish after invoking the Blessed Virgin Mary. The statue is currently housed in the Basilica of the National Shrine of Our Lady of Aparecida in Aparecida, São Paulo, Brazil. Colonial documents and papal bulls have referred to the image as Nossa Senhora da Conceição Aparecida. The Roman Rite feast day of Our Lady of Aparecida is on October 12, which since 1980 is also a public holiday in Brazil.

Controversy about the statue was ignited in May 1978 by an intruder who stole the clay statue, which was smashed as he was apprehended, from its shrine, and again in 1995, when a Protestant minister insulted and vandalized a copy of the statue on Brazilian national television. The following papal documents concern the famed statue: * Pope Leo XIII mentioned the Brazilian devotion to Nossa Senhora da Conceição Aparecida in 1903 * Pope Pius X granted a canonical coronation to the image on 8 December 1904. * Pope Pius XI declared Mary under this title Patroness of Brazil through a papal bull of 16 July 1930, signed by Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli. * Pope Paul VI granted the image her first golden rose on 12 August 1967. * Pope John Paul II consecrated her new shrine and on the same date raised it to the rank of minor basilica on 4 July 1980https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/homilies/1980/documents/hf_jp- ii_hom_19800704_aparecida-brazil_en.html * Pope Benedict XVI granted the image her second golden rose on 12 May 2007. * Pope Francis granted the third golden rose on 9 October 2017, honoring the 300th anniversary of the devotion. History According to the account of the discovery of the statue in October 1717, Dom Pedro de Almeida, Count of Assumar and Governor of the Province of São Paulo and Minas Gerais, was passing through the area of Guaratinguetá, a small city in the Paraíba river valley, during a trip to Vila Rica, an important gold mining site. As the people of Guaratinguetá decided to hold a feast in his honour, three fishermen, Domingos Garcia, João Alves, and Filipe Pedroso went down to the Paraíba waters to fish. The fishermen prayed to Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception that God would grant a good catch. The fishermen, having a run of bad luck, cast their nets in the River Paraiba and dragged up a headless statue of the Virgin Mary. They also salvaged the head and, according to the legend, then netted plenty of fish.\\"Brazil's giant basilica is backdrop for Pope visit\\", May 6, 2007 After cleaning the statue, they found that it was a black version of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception. Legend has it that when the fishermen recovered the body, then the head, the slender figure of the Aparecida Virgin became so heavy that they couldn't budge it. The fishermen named the statue Nossa Senhora da Conceição Aparecida ().Our Lady Aparecida profile at Catholic Media. Neighbors began to venerate the statue, which came to be known as Our Lady Appeared, and devotion grew. The first chapel was built in 1745. Devotion to the statue grew rapidly, particularly among Afro-Brazilians, not only for its black Madonna status, but also because it was reported to have performed a miracle for an enslaved young man. Over the years following its discovery, veneration of the Virgin invoked as Aparecida increased as many miracles were attributed to her. For the following fifteen years, the statue remained within Filipe Pedroso's family, and neighbors came to venerate it. Stories of Our Lady of Aparecida's miracles were spread throughout Brazil, and the Pedroso family built her a chapel which soon became too small for so many worshippers. In 1737 the priest of Guaratinguetá built her a chapel on the Morro dos Coqueiros (Hill of Coconut Palms), where public visits began in July 1745. The number of worshippers increased dramatically, and in 1834 work on a larger church was begun; this became known as the \\"Old Basilica\\" when work on the even larger \\"New Basilica\\" was started in 1955; it received pontifical approbation in 1980. In 1928 the \\"City of Aparecida\\" was consolidated around the old Basílica =The image= According to a local tale the clay statue was imported from Portugal; others say that it was made by Frei Agostinho de Jesus, a monk from São Paulo known for crafting artistic sacred images in clay. The small statue is less than three feet tall.de Vries, Lloyd. \\"Pope Canonizes First Brazilian Saint\\". CBS News. May 11, 2007. The image was made around 1650, and must have been underwater for years, since it lost its original polychromy. The image is dark brown, and covered by a stiff dark blue robe of richly embroidered thick cloth emblazoned with the flags of Brazil and the Vatican City State with golden clasps. An imperial crown was added in 1904. A bronze replica of the same image is sponsored by the Embassy of Brazil to the Vatican and was approved for installation within the Gardens of the Vatican City under the mandate of Pope Francis, officially held on 3 September 2016. =First patronage= At the written request of Emperor Pedro I of Brazil, Pope Leo XII declared Saint Peter of Alcantara the \\"Patron of Brazil\\" on 31 May 1826. The ruler of Brazil at that time, Pedro I (born Prince Pedro de Alcantara), was named after Saint Peter of Alcantara.Plinio Maria Solimeo, São Pedro de Alcântara Padroeiro do Brasil Friar Stephano Piat Joseph, OFM, St. Peter of Alcantara, Patron of Brazil, translated from the French language by Father Clarence Neotti OFM, Editora Vozes, Petrópolis, 1962, page. 13 Later, as the Virgin Mary outranks St. Peter of Alcantara in the Catholic hierarchy of saints, with the proclamation of the Virgin Aparecida as the principal Catholic patron saint of Brazil, St. Peter became the secondary patron. =Canonical coronation= On the Feast of the Immaculate Conception 1904, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the 1854 proclamation of the dogma of the Immaculate Conception, the statue of Our Lady Aparecida was Canonically crowned by the archbishop of São Paulo, Lino Deodato Rodrigues, at the decree of the Holy See and in the presence of the Apostolic Nuncio. The Coronation was performed in the name and on behalf of Pope Pius X who granted this approval. The papal coronation of the image of Aparecida was a major event attended by many people and by civil authorities including President Rodrigues Alves, who made the point of witnessing the act in spite of the separation of Church and State that had been instituted when Brazil became a Republic, less than twenty years before. The gold used for the manufacture of the Crown was donated by the head of Brazil's Imperial Family, the exiled Princess Isabel. After the pontifical coronation of 1904 the Holy See granted a divine office and Mass for her feast day. Twenty years later, the village that had grown around the church on Coqueiros hill became a municipality, named after the saint. Papal Bull of 1930 On 16 July 1930, Pope Pius XI declared the Immaculate Conception under the title of Our Lady of Aparecida to be the principal patroness of Brazil, namely widespread in the Archdiocese of Rio de Janeiro. The pontifical decree indicated that Pope Leo XIII granted the approval on the devotion of the image under the title \\"Nossa Senhora da Conceição Apparecida\\". In addition, Saint Pope Pius X established the Office of the Mass under this honor and allowing this devotion to spread due to the widespread piety of the Brazilian people. The Papal decree mentions the 1904 solid gold crown given to the image (assumingly from Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil). It does not however, mention the shrine being elevated to a minor basilica. Furthermore, the devotion was researched and approved by Cardinal Camillo Laurenti, Prefect of the Sacred Congregation of Rites. The papal bull was signed and witnessed by Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli.Acta Apostolica Sedis – 1931 – Page 7 – Beata Virgo Maria Immaculata Sub Titulo Apparecida – Principalis Patrona Brasiliae Constituitur. – https://www.vatican.va/archive/aas/documents/AAS-23-1931-ocr.pdfAssociação Redemptionis Sacramentum (text in Latin and Portuguese) – http://ars- the.blogspot.com.br/2012/10/a-carta-apostolica-de-pio-xi-que.html In the wake of the papal decree naming Our Lady Aparecida Patroness of Brazil, on July 16, 1930, Cardinal Sebastião Leme da Silveira Cintra, the Archbishop of Rio de Janeiro (then the Capital of Brazil), rededicated Brazil to the Virgin under this Marian title. Later years Up until the early 1950s, Aparecida remained an unassuming city with a small community of Redemptorists. They arrived from the sanctuary of the Virgin of Altötting in Germany and took on the responsibility for the shrine of Our Lady Aparecida, making it the first Redemptorist parish in Latin America. Devotion to the Marian image grew under Padre Vítor Coelho (1899-1987), a Redemptorist priest and catechist.http://santuarionacional.vteximg.com.br/arquivos/imagens.png In 1958, due to the growth of the Catholic community around the Marian Shrine of Aparecida, the Holy See decided to erect the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Aparecida, separating its territory in part from the Archdiocese of São Paulo and in part from the Diocese of Taubaté and transferring three suffragan Dioceses that previously were subject to the Metropolitan Archbishop of São Paulo to form the new ecclesiastical province of Aparecida. The new See was led by administrators until 1964, when the first Archbishop of Aparecida was appointed. Contrary to popular belief, John Paul II was the first Pope to consecrate the shrine with the title of Basilica on July 4, 1980. In his Apostolic message, the Pontiff mentioned the coronation of 1904, the Patronage granted in 1930, and his culminating purpose of consecration of the shrine as a Basilica during that time. By research in Vatican documents, there is no mention of 1908 proclamations of the shrine as a Basilica by the Pope or any Vatican prelate. Pope Francis installed a replica of the same Marian image within the Vatican Gardens in September 2016 via the diplomatic efforts of the Brazilian embassy to the Holy See. =Assault on the image= Pieces of the vandalized Marian image taken in 1978. The image became the source of religious conflicts between Catholics and Protestants, primarily driven by non-mainline churches identified with charismatic, evangelical, or fundamentalist theology, including all branches of Pentecostalism, due to the nature of Catholic Marian devotion associated with the religious image. On May 16, 1978, a person identified as a member of a Protestant sect took the statue from its niche on the Basilica after the last Mass of the day. He was chased by guards and some of the church goers.Oliveira, Plinio Corrêa. \\"Feast Days of Our Lady: Our Lady Aparecida – October 12\\". Tradition in Action, Inc. As he was caught, the statue fell to the ground breaking to pieces; a group of artists and artisans pieced it together again. On her feast day in 1995, a public holiday, an incident later known as \\"kicking of the saint\\" took place when televangelist Sérgio Von Helder (or Helde), of the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God (UCKG), insulted and kicked a replica of Our Lady of Aparecida, and said that \\"it could not do anything for you\\", on a late-night religious program broadcast by UCKG television station Rede Record.Epstein, Jack (November 24, 1995). \\"Kicking of icon outrages Brazil Catholics\\".

Several temples of the UCKG were targeted by protesters, and Von Helder was transferred to South Africa until the end of the controversy.\\"Church makes airwaves\\". BBC. August 3, 2000. Retrieved 2009-01-06. The New Basilica The National Basilica, located in Aparecida, São Paulo, Brazil In the mid-20th century, as the popularity of Our Lady of Aparecida grew, the construction of a much larger building to shelter the image became necessary. In 1955, work on the present Basilica of the National Shrine of Our Lady of Aparecida was begun. Architect Benedito Calixto designed a building in the form of a Greek cross. It can hold up to 45,000 people. On July 4, 1980, while still under construction, the new church was consecrated by Pope John Paul II and given the title of Minor Basilica. It is currently the largest Marian temple and the second largest Basilica in the world, second only to St. Peter's in the Vatican City. Since then, the two Basilicas in the city of Aparecida have been known as the \\"Old Basilica\\" and the \\"New Basilica\\". Upon its completion, the Brazilian Conference of Catholic Bishops declared the new Basilica a National Shrine. As the National Shrine, dedicated to the patroness of Brazil, one of the functions of the Basilica is to function as a site of pilgrimage for laborers. The traditional pilgrimage of the laborers takes place each year on Brazil's independence holiday, September 7. According to recent estimates, the Basilica attracts about 8 million pilgrims a year.Lugo, Luis. \\"Pope to Visit 'Pentecostalized' Brazil\\". Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life. April 19, 2007. The influence of Our Lady of Aparecida on Brazilian Catholic society is incalculable. In 1992 a study showed that 296 parishes were dedicated to her while five cathedrals had the same title. In addition, many towns are named after the Virgin and so are many Brazilian women and girls. The modern art styled cathedral of Brasilia designed by Oscar Niemeyer is dedicated to Our Lady Aparecida, as Brasilia is the national capital and she is invoked as Brazil's special protector. In 2004, to commemorate the centennial of the pontifical coronation commanded by Pope Pius X and the 150th anniversary of the dogmatic definition of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary, the statue of Our Lady of Aparecida was granted a renewed canonical coronation by the Holy See. The renewed coronation was presided by the Archbishop emeritus of Rio de Janeiro, Cardinal Eugênio Sales, in the capacity of special papal envoy of Pope John Paul II. On May 12, 2007 Pope Benedict XVI granted the Basilica of the National Shrine of Our Lady Aparecida a Golden Rose. The \\"Old Basilica\\" also possesses a Golden Rose, awarded by Pope Paul VI on August 12, 1967 and presented by the Apostolic Nuncio; it was a gift of the Holy See to mark the Pope's participation in the commemorations of the 250th anniversary of the devotion to the Virgin of Aparecida. The \\"New Basilica\\"'s Golden Rose was presented by Pope Benedict, who visited the Basilica and celebrated Mass there during his 2007 Apostolic visit to Brazil. Pope Francis celebrated Mass at the shrine on July 24, 2013 and entrusted his pontificate as well as the World Youth Day to the maternal protection of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Feast day Since the 19th century, the Feast Day of Our Lady Aparecida is celebrated on October 12. The date coincides with the foundation of the Empire of Brazil in 1822, and is regarded in Brazilian culture as Children's Day. In the Roman Rite Catholic Liturgical Calendar approved for Brazil, the day of Our Lady Aparecida ranks as a solemnity, and is a holy day of obligation. The feast's rank as a day of precept was established by the Holy See at the request of the National Conference of Brazilian Bishops. The feast day of Our Lady of Aparecida has been a National Holiday in Brazil since 1980. The federal statute declaring October 12 a national holiday in honour of \\"Our Lady of Aparecida\\", Patroness of Brazil, was passed by Congress and signed into law on June 30, 1980, during Pope John Paul II's first visit to the country; that was also the first visit by a Pope to Brazil, and during that visit the \\"New Basilica\\" of Aparecida was consecrated.  Cultural references  The telenovela A Padroeira (The Patroness), broadcast on Rede Globo between June 18, 2001 and February 23, 2002, was a fictional portrayal of the finding of the Our Lady of Aparecida statue, loosely based on the 1865 novel As Minas de Prata by José de Alencar, which itself had been adapted for the telenovela format in 1966 by the now defunct TV Excelsior.

It stars Jim Carrey and Téa Leoni and is a remake of the 1977 film of the same name. The story focuses on a married, middle-class couple who resort to robbery when the husband's employer goes bankrupt. Alec Baldwin, Richard Jenkins, Angie Harmon, John Michael Higgins, Richard Burgi, Carlos Jacott, Gloria Garayua and Stephnie Weir also star, and James Whitmore appears in an uncredited cameo in one of his final roles. Fun with Dick and Jane was released by Sony Pictures Releasing label to Columbia Pictures on December 21, 2005 and grossed over $202 million worldwide at the box office.  Plot  In the year 2000, Dick Harper (Jim Carrey), an executive for a major media corporation called Globodyne, gets promoted to Vice President of Communications. He convinces his wife Jane (Téa Leoni) to quit her job as a travel agent to spend more time with their son, as his salary would be able to cover their expenses. On his first day on the job, however, while doing an interview on television, he learns that his CEO sold a majority of share of his stocks through shell companies, and Globodyne is accused of \\"perverting the American dream\\" by presidential candidate Ralph Nader (himself). As this happens, all of the company's stocks drop to zero, and everyone, including Dick, loses their jobs, savings, and pensions. Dick goes back to the company to confront Jack McCallister (Alec Baldwin), the CEO, but he dismisses Dick's concerns and flies away in the company's helicopter. Dick breaks the news to the family that night over dinner, but tries to assure them that he can find another job as vice president. However, over the next few months, he finds that Globodyne's collapse has sent the overall economy into a recession, and thus left it next to impossible to find a new vice president position due to there being a large influx of other candidates. In addition, he becomes a target for ridicule because of the television interview. Even worse, Jane discovers that because their pension and all of their savings and investments were in Globodyne's now-worthless stock, they now have no assets and face possibly losing their home. Dick and Jane then accept low paying work, but they prove unable to keep their jobs, and after having their utilities cut off, they resort to selling their personal property and taking off-the-books work to stay afloat, the latter resulting in Dick getting arrested and deported, necessitating his illegal re-entry. When the family is given a 24-hour eviction notice, Dick, tired of being screwed around after doing everything right, decides to turn to a life of crime and persuades Jane to follow him. After a few mishaps, they finally manage to rob a head shop, and with newfound confidence, they proceed to get better at armed robbery. After a few nightly robbing sprees, they become more comfortable and professional over time, and eventually manage to retire their entire debt. For one last heist, they plan to steal from a local bank. All goes as planned until the Petersons – another couple formerly employed at Globodyne – make an amateurish attempt to rob the same bank. The Petersons are quickly arrested and Dick and Jane manage to use the mass hysteria to escape the police's attention and head home, albeit empty-handed. After watching a news report detailing the arrests of the Petersons and other former Globodyne employees who turned to similar illegal activities to make ends meet, the Harpers decide to cease their life of crime. However, Dick discovers that his failed interview with Ralph Nader has caused him to be investigated, and ultimately, indicted for his unwitting role in the company's collapse. While drinking his sorrows at a fancy millionaire's club, he stumbles upon the drunk former CFO of the company, Frank Bascombe (Richard Jenkins). When he and Jane confront Frank, the CFO remorsefully admits that McCallister had planned everything from the beginning: during Dick's interview, the CEO diverted all of Globodyne's assets and then dumped the entire stock, thus ruining the company and its employees and investors, and leaving Dick and Frank among others to take the blame, while embezzling a $400 million fortune and getting off scot-free. Frank, who is about to go to prison for 18 months after failing to expose McCallister's crimes, got a $10 million bribe from him to stay quiet. Frank tells Dick that McCallister plans to transfer his $400 million in bearer bonds to an offshore account and creates a plan with Dick and Jane to intercept the transfer from inside the bank and substitute a fake form, transferring the funds to an account Frank has established. Things go wrong when Dick loses the form by accident, so they enter the bank to print a new form while McCallister is there making the transfer, but McCallister realizes there are incorrections on the form and spots Dick. In a final attempt, Dick holds Jack discreetly at gunpoint and demands him to sign a check, which he does. Jane tells Dick that McCallister could cancel the check at any moment, but Dick reveals that it was all a ruse to get McCallister's signature, and Jane, being an art major, can forge it. The next day, McCallister is mobbed by reporters and former Globodyne employees, all praising him for a sudden \\"generosity\\" of his. Dick shows up as McCallister's vice president and hands him a prepared statement, which McCallister reads on live television. He is shocked to announce that he has transferred $400 million to a trust fund to support Globodyne's defunct pension plan in gratitude to his former employees and gets carried away by a cheering crowd, befuddled. A news report reveals the company's former employees (including the imprisoned Petersons) receiving their pension checks from the fund, Dick has managed to evade indictment, and McCallister's net worth has been reduced to a mere $2,238.04. A year later, Dick's family drives a Volkswagen Rabbit convertible into the sunset. While Billy (Aaron Michael Drozin) is teaching his parents Spanish, Dick's friend Garth (John Michael Higgins) approaches driving a brand new Bentley Azure, excited to reveal that he has a new job with great benefits at a company called Enron. CastBackground The film is based on the novel of the same name by Gerald Gaiser which was previously filmed in 1977. Peter Tolan wrote the first draft of the screenplay. In June 2003 it was announced that Jim Carrey would star in the film with Barry Sonnenfeld directing and Brian Grazer producing. On July 14, 2003 it was announced that Cameron Diaz would star opposite Carrey. The same day it was also reported that the Coen brothers would rewrite the script. On July 3 it was announced that Sonnenfeld had left the film six weeks before the start of production. Production was postponed until after Carrey had completed his next film Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events. On October it was announced that Dean Parisot would replace Sonnenfeld as director and that production would start in June 2004. Judd Apatow and Nicholas Stoller worked on the script with Parisot. Diaz then left the film. On July 21, 2004, it was announced that she would be replaced by Téa Leoni. Production The film had more than two weeks of reshoots and numerous rewrites. David Koepp, Ed Solomon, Ted Griffin and the team of Alec Berg, David Mandel and Jeff Schaffer all did uncredited rewrites. ReceptionCritical reaction= On Rotten Tomatoes, Fun With Dick and Jane has an approval rating of 28% based on 135 reviews, with an average rating of 4.9/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"This muddled comedy has a few laughs, but never sustains a consistent tone.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 47 out of 100, based on 33 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B\\" on an A+ to F scale. Justin Chang of Variety positively described the film as \\"the rare Hollywood remake that, by daring to reinterpret its source material within a fresh political context, actually has a reason to exist\\". Manohla Dargis of the New York Times commented that \\"... the film never settles into a groove, zigging and zagging from belly laughs to pathos ...\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote: \\"Recycles the 1977 comedy right down to repeating the same mistakes.\\" Ebert was critical of the film's unexplored opportunities and wrote that it instead turns to \\"tired slapstick\\". He suggested viewers might watch The New Age instead. =Box office= The film grossed $14 million on its opening weekend in third place when competing with King Kong and The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe during the holiday season. It eventually earned $110,332,737 at the domestic box office, and $91,693,375 in international receipts, for a total, worldwide revenue of $202,026,112, against a production budget of $100 million. It is one of twenty feature films to be released in over 3,000 theaters and improve on its box office performance in its second weekend, increasing 14.9% from $14,383,515 to $16,522,532. The high earnings despite the criticism were partially attributed to the scheduled trial of Kenneth Lay and Jeffrey Skilling, and the film credited corporate scandals for inspiration.

It sheds light on English life and childhood during the First World War, through a detailed pre-adolescent female character and a time-slip narrative. The setting The story is about an orphaned girl called Jessamy, age unstated but about nine to eleven, who lived with one aunt during school term and another during school holidays. Both aunts were superficially affectionate, but neither paid heed to her as a person. The book begins with her arrival unaccompanied by train, to find that her \\"holiday\\" aunt's uncongenial children had caught whooping cough. Jessamy had to be farmed out for the summer to Miss Brindle, the childless caretaker of an empty Victorian mansion: Posset Place. Jessamy was taken aback by the old Miss Brindle, who was wary of children – \\"I daresay you won't mind being treated like a grown-up person. I don't know any other way,\\" she was told (p. 14).In-line references are to the first UK edition: Barbara Sleigh: Jessamy (London: Collins, 1967). Once Jessamy had reassured her – \\"I'll try not to be a menace\\" (p. 13) – she was allowed to explore the house and came across a schoolroom. She opened a large empty cupboard and saw three sets of old pencil marks on the door showing the heights of four children, one of them, appearing only in the first set, named Jessamy, like her. She was exhausted that night and went to bed, only to be woken by moonlight shining through her window. She put on a dressing gown and stole back to the schoolroom with an electric torch. \\"Her bare feet seemed to take charge of her, almost as if they knew the way themselves\\" (p. 25). This time she found clothes hanging in the cupboard and only the first set of pencil marks on the door. Beside them was a date: \\"July 23rd, 1914\\" (p. 25), precisely 53 years before, and two weeks before Britain would declare war on Germany. A drip of hot wax on her hand signalled that her torch had turned itself into a candle. The time slip Sleigh takes great care with the join between the two narratives. Jessamy herself was puzzled: \\"'This is a dream, it must be!' she said. 'I'm sound asleep in the camp bed really'\\" (p. 26). Jessamy had been reading Francis Hodgson Burnett's The Secret Garden (1911) on the train (p. 7), and there was something secret about the way the holiday aunt and Jessamy stepped from a modern street into the walled garden round a house that Jessamy felt looked \\"half like a church, and half like a castle with those battlements and stained glass windows and things\\" (p. 14). Back in time, Jessamy found she had fallen from a tree the previous day and should be recovering in bed from concussion. She was thought to have suffered some memory loss, which happily accounted for some of her strange questions. She was found by a parlour maid, Matchett, who was up and in street clothes suspiciously late, and asked crossly what she was doing in the cupboard, \\"'I don't quite remember,' Jessamy heard herself say slowly. 'I think I was looking for something'\\" (p. 28). Readers are also helped over the time slip by the dazzling improvement it brought in Jessamy's life. In the present, she was a brave, well-meaning and intelligent enough girl, but isolated and deprived of love and companionship, not to mention adventure, and wishing she were able to go to boarding school. In her 1914 state, most of those deficiencies were met: she found an aunt, the cook-housekeeper Mrs Rumbold, who loved her dearly, took her in hand and gave her things to do; she gained a true companion in the younger boy Kitto and an untrue one in his ill- disposed sister Fanny; and she could bridge two societies: below stairs with the staff, and above stairs in the schoolroom with the children of the family, who were orphaned like herself, and being raised by an older sister and a rich grandfather who owned a pharmaceutical factory (hence Posset Place for the house). The duality in the story continues, with Jessamy turning over in her present-day mind what was happening to her in a different life: \\"Quite suddenly Jessamy realised that she was very hungry. The faint rumble of her inside was reassuring. It belonged to the Jessamy of both worlds\\" (p. 37). The theft Against this new-found love, companionship, and contentment, Sleigh sets about outlining Jessamy's new worth. The grandfather Mr Parkinson, owner of Posset Place, took Jessamy, his grandson Kitto, and the groom William Stubbins to an auction, where he bought a medieval book of hours for the large sum of £300. The eldest boy Harry, everybody's favourite, then returned from Oxford, set upon joining the army instead of completing his final year, and burdened by debts. After a dreadful row and Harry's departure in the night, the book of hours was found to be missing. Mr Parkinson assumed Harry had stolen it, but Jessamy, Kitto and others were appalled at the accusation. Not so the parlour maid Matchett or her lover, William the groom. Trust is a recurrent theme in the book. On arrival in the earlier Posset Place, Jessamy had promised Matchett, who was up late at night, not to betray her love affair. Soon after, Fanny grudgingly thanked her for not revealing that her fall from the mulberry tree came about because Fanny had pushed her. Now she set about helping Fanny again, for Fanny had borrowed her elder sister's mother-of-pearl penknife without asking, and left it in the tree house at the time of Jessamy's fall. Disobeying Mr Parkinson's orders to the children never to climb the tree again, Jessamy went up to retrieve the knife, but was caught in the act. Again there was a row, and it looked as if Jessamy's escapade might cost Mrs Rumbold her job on the domestic staff. But Jessamy managed to slip the penknife to Kitto, and the danger to Mrs Rumbold passed when Fanny came clean about why Jessamy was up the forbidden tree. Returning to the schoolroom later, Jessamy went to the cupboard to see if Fanny's hat was there and she had returned from a walk. The door of the cupboard shut behind Jessamy and she found herself back in the present, still wearing her dressing gown and holding not a candle but her torch. The aftermath Back in the present, Jessamy had a second fall when the paper boy, Billy, opened the gate suddenly and knocked her over. But some of the improvement Jessamy had found in her 1914 life was matched in the present. She befriended Billy and told him her story, as if she were just making it up. She became fond of Miss Brindle, the caretaker, and helped her with the house. She enjoyed a seaside holiday with her aunt, despite the petulance of her cousins. But examining the second set of dated marks in the cupboard, from 1915, convinced Jessamy that if she were ever to get back to the other Posset Place, it would have to be on August 14. She succeeded, picked up the strands, and became skilled at soothing Billy, the baby boy of Matchett, by then Mrs Stubbins with a husband away in the army. One day Jessamy and Kitto took along the baby in his pram when they went to deliver some magazines to a military hospital. There in a ward Jessamy found Harry, lying in bed with his arm amputated. It was soon clear to Jessamy and Kitto that Harry did not even know the theft had occurred. They engineered a reconciliation between him and his grandfather, but the book of hours remained unfound. The children's suspicions fell on the Stubbinses. Jessamy cornered Mrs Stubbins into admitting, under a vow of secrecy, that her husband had stolen it, but she did not know where he had hidden it, and he was away at the war. The note he had written giving its whereabouts was with his will, in an envelope which Mrs Stubbins had promised not to open unless her husband should be killed. Jessamy, however, found the envelope tucked down the side of the pram, opened it and took out the note. She was seen doing this by Mrs Stubbins, who chased her, so that she was unable to read it. She managed to crumple the note and tuck it into the mouth of a tiger hearth rug in the drawing room, but Mrs Stubbins chased her up to the schoolroom, where Jessamy hid in the cupboard – and promptly returned to the present. Back in the present a second time, it emerged that the paper boy Billy was the grandson of Stubbins the groom, who had after all died in the war. Furthermore, it emerged from remarks made by her holiday aunt that Jessamy's forebear, whose name was Jessamy too, had lived as a child at Posset Place with an aunt who was on the staff. There was one more set of marks in the cupboard, September 10, 1916, but Jessamy, to her sorrow, failed to slip back in time on that day. Later, Billy and Jessamy fixed a swing to an old bough of the mulberry tree, which broke off, revealing the book of hours hidden in a crack, just where the tree house had been. It was damp and discoloured, but Miss Brindle showed it to the house agent, who showed it to the owner of Posset Place. He was delighted to have it, for when the present-day Jessamy visited him at his request, he turned out to be the aged Kitto. Dramatic irony appears. \\"'You must forgive me, my dear,' he said, 'I'm afraid I may have been talking nonsense.... I almost thought I was talking to the other Jessamy, the one I used to know. You were so like her in the half dark'\\" (p. 157). Not long after, Kitto wrote to Jessamy offering to pay for her to go to boarding school, as she so much wanted to do (p. 159).There are some differences between the last chapters of the first UK and first American editions.

It is inspired by William Shakespeare's play Twelfth Night. The film centers on teenager Viola Hastings, who enters her brother's new boarding school, Illyria Prep, in his place while he tries to break into the music scene in London. Viola pretends to be a boy, in order to play with the boys' soccer team after her team gets cut at her school. Plot Viola Hastings (Amanda Bynes) is a teen girl who plays for Cornwall's soccer team until the team gets cut. Her dream is to play for the North Carolina Tar Heels. Meanwhile, her twin brother, Sebastian (James Kirk), is supposed to enroll in Illyria, an elite boarding school, but he secretly goes to London with his fledgling band instead. Viola agrees to cover for him and decides to pass herself off as Sebastian, in hopes of joining their boys' team and beating Cornwall to prove their coach and her cocky ex-boyfriend, Justin (Robert Hoffman), wrong for suggesting cancellation of the ladies' soccer team. With the help of her stylist friend, Paul (Jonathan Sadowski), she is transformed into \\"Sebastian\\" and attends Illyria in his place. While moving in, she meets her roommate, Duke Orsino (Channing Tatum), an attractive soccer player and Illyria's team captain. During tryouts, Viola fails to impress Coach Dinklage (Vinnie Jones) and is assigned to second string, much to her dismay. Her teammates, including Duke, initially dislike \\"Sebastian\\" due to his awkward and strange behavior. However, with help from Paul once again, they begin to accept him into their social circle. \\"Sebastian\\" then gets the popular and pretty Olivia (Laura Ramsey) as his lab partner, which frustrates Duke, as he has feelings for her. \\"Sebastian\\" agrees to put in a good word for Duke if he promises to train him to be a better soccer player. Coach Dinklage eventually notices \\"Sebastian's\\" effort and improvement, thus promoting him to first string. At the Junior League carnival, where her mother has made her volunteer, Viola works a shift at the kissing booth and shares a kiss with Duke. Duke expresses to \\"Sebastian\\" that he might move on from Olivia as he is starting to like Viola now. Viola is delighted as she secretly feels the same way. Olivia who now has a crush on \\"Sebastian\\", asks Duke out on a date in hopes that it will make \\"Sebastian\\" jealous. Viola, who is unaware of Olivia's true intentions, is enraged instead because Duke has now abandoned his interest in Viola. When Viola finds out the truth, she encourages Olivia to tell \\"Sebastian\\" directly about her feelings. The situation becomes even more complicated when the real Sebastian returns from London a day early, unbeknownst to Viola. As soon as he arrives at Illyria, Olivia confesses her feelings and kisses him. Duke, seeing this, believes his roommate has betrayed him. When \\"Sebastian\\" returns to their room, the two have an argument and Duke kicks him out. Viola oversleeps and misses the first half of the game, while the real Sebastian is mistaken for \\"Sebastian\\" and winds up poorly playing his sister's game instead. At half-time, Viola explains the situation to Sebastian and they switch places again. Duke, still furious at \\"Sebastian\\", refuses to cooperate with him on the field. Determined to makes amends with Duke, \\"Sebastian\\" explains that he is actually Viola. Illyria wins the game when Viola scores a goal, finally humiliating Justin and the rest of the Cornwall boys. Everyone at Illyria celebrates their victory over Cornwall, except for Duke who is hurt about Viola's deception. Viola introduces Sebastian and Olivia officially, and they begin dating. Viola and Sebastian's divorced parents also make up, exchanging contact information so as to be better parents towards their children. She invites Duke to her debutante ball, with an invitation delivered by Sebastian, now Duke's actual roommate. Still hurt, Duke doesn't respond to Viola's invitation, which devastates her. At the ball, Viola is skeptical that Duke will show up; she distracts herself by assisting Olivia, who is being escorted by Sebastian to the ball, and is touched when Paul asks to be her date. Her mother shows up with a dress that will suit Viola's \\"no ruffles\\" policy, but Viola decides to go for a walk instead. She runs into Duke outside, who tells her that he has feelings for her, but that he doesn't want there to be any more deception on her part; Viola promises to be honest with him. Later, Monique (Alex Breckenridge) is escorted by Justin, Olivia is escorted by Sebastian, and Viola and Duke enter the stage late, but together, with Viola in her new dress, much to the joy of her mother. Viola and Duke share a kiss before joining the crowd. At the end of the film, Viola and Duke are shown happily playing on Illyria's soccer team together.

The unit perform emergency nuclear airlift, aeromedical evacuation & humanitarian relief missions in the technologically advanced, C-17A airlift aircraft in all phases of ground and flight activity. HistoryWorld War II= 20 Nov 1940, the unit was constituted as 16 Transport Squadron and activated two weeks later on 11 Dec 1940. The squadron converted to Douglas DC-2 transport aircraft as a GHQ Air Force transport squadron. Converted to Douglas C-47 Skytrains in early 1942, trained under I Troop Carrier Command for combat operations. Redesignated 16 Troop Carrier Squadron on 4 Jul 1942. Assigned to VIII Air Support Command, Eighth Air Force and deployed to England in August 1942, providing transport to the newly established American Air Force. Was transferred to Algiers, Algeria in November 1942, and attached, being later assigned to Twelfth Air Force as part of the North African Campaign. The squadron's aircraft flew supplies to front- line units in Algeria and Tunisia as soon as suitable landing strips were available and evacuated casualties back to rear area field hospitals. A flight of the squadron deployed to Tenth Air Force in India during the fall of 1942, to assist in the re-supply of Brigadier General Merrill and his men, affectionately known as \\"Merrill's Marauders\\". It was during this Ceylon, Burma, India campaign that the squadron received its first Distinguished Unit Citation, returning to Tunisia by the end of the year. The squadron moved to Sicily, dropping airborne forces onto the island during Operation Husky, then moved to forward airfields in Italy during 1943 as part of the Italian Campaign. Just prior to D Day, part of the 16th left India for Italy to tow gliders into France on \\"D\\" Day. In July 1944, the detached unit was joined by the remainder of the 16th at Ciampino Airport, Italy and as the European Theater closed in on Germany, part of the 16th again went on detached service to Rosignano Airfield, Italy, operating resupply missions to Greek partisans during September to October 1944. In the fall of 1944, moved to France in support of Operation Anvil, the Allied invasion of Southern France, and supported ground forces moving north through the Rhone Valley to link up with Allied forces moving east from Normandy. Returned to Northern Italy in early 1945, supporting the drive into the Po River Valley and the end of combat in Italy during May 1945. The squadron also hauled food, clothing, medicine, gasoline, ordnance equipment, and other supplies to the front lines and evacuated patients to rear zone hospitals. In late May 1945, after V-E Day, the squadron moved to Waller Field, Trinidad and attached to Air Transport Command. From Trinidad, the squadron ferried returning military personnel to Morrison Field, Florida, where they were sent on to other bases or prepared for separation after the war. Inactivated at the end of July 1945. =Tactical airlift in the Cold War= Reactivated briefly in 1947–1948 at Langley Field, Virginia as a Tactical Air Command troop carrier squadron, but never fully manned or equipped. Reactivated during the Korean War at Sewart Air Force Base, Tennessee and equipped with Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcars and other assault transports to be used for airborne combat assault operations. Performed training for combat units, but remained in the United States. Moved to Ardmore Air Force Base, Oklahoma in 1954 and was inactivated in 1955. Redesignated the 16th Tactical Airlift Training Squadron on 14 August 1969 and was reactivated six weeks later flying Lockheed C-130 Hercules at Sewart Air Force Base, TN. On 1 October 1993 the 76th Airlift Squadron at Joint Base Charleston, SC, was renamed the 16th Airlift Squadron and assigned to the 4442nd Combat Crew Training Wing. With the closure of Sewart, the squadron moved to Little Rock AFB, Arkansas in March 1970 with the 4442 CCTW, flying and conducting initial upgrade training on the C-130 A and E models. =Strategic airlift= On 1 October 1993, the 76th Airlift Squadron at Charleston Air Force Base, SC, was renamed the 16th Airlift Squadron, and transitioned to the C-141 as the squadron's primary aircraft. 15 July 2000 saw the unit's C-141 Starlifter leave and the squadron was inactivated. 1 Jul 2002, the squadron reactivated with Boeing C-17A Globemaster III heavy-lift strategic transport aircraft.

DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and RNA (ribonucleic acid) are examples of polynucleotides with distinct biological function. The prefix poly comes from the ancient Greek πολυς (polys, many). DNA consists of two chains of polynucleotides, with each chain in the form of a helical spiral. Sequence Although DNA and RNA do not generally occur in the same polynucleotide, the four species of nucleotides may occur in any order in the chain. The sequence of DNA or RNA species for a given polynucleotide is the main factor determining its function in a living organism or a scientific experiment. Polynucleotides in organisms Polynucleotides occur naturally in all living organisms. The genome of an organism consists of complementary pairs of enormously long polynucleotides wound around each other in the form of a double helix. Polynucleotides have a variety of other roles in organisms. Polynucleotides in scientific experiments Polynucleotides are used in biochemical experiments such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or DNA sequencing. Polynucleotides are made artificially from oligonucleotides, smaller nucleotide chains with generally fewer than 30 subunits. A polymerase enzyme is used to extend the chain by adding nucleotides according to a pattern specified by the scientist.

Biography Coolidge was born in Westminster, Massachusetts, son of Frederick Spaulding Coolidge. Through his father, he was descended from both John Coolidge (1604–1691) and Thomas Hastings who came from the East Anglia region of England to the Massachusetts Bay Colony, in 1630 and 1634 respectively. After attending public schools and Bryant & Stratton Commercial College at its former Boston, Massachusetts campus, Coolidge worked with his father's company in manufacturing chairs and rattan. He later worked in the contracting business, building street railways, water works, and bridges. In 1916, Coolidge was elected mayor of Fitchburg, Massachusetts. In 1919, President Woodrow Wilson appointed Coolidge as special envoy to Poland to represent the Peace Commission. He became chairman of the Democratic state convention in 1920. That year he was defeated for lieutenant governor by Republican Congressman Alvan T. Fuller. Coolidge also served as trustee and president of the Cushing Academy at Ashburnham, Massachusetts. After being elected to the United States Senate in 1930, Coolidge served as chairman of the Committee on Immigration for the Seventy-third and Seventy-fourth Congresses, but was not a candidate for renomination in 1936. After leaving the Senate, Coolidge returned to Fitchburg and his former business pursuits. He died at St. Francis Hospital in Miami Beach, Florida in 1947, aged 81, and is interred at Mount Pleasant Cemetery in Westminster, Massachusetts. He donated substantial land to the city of Fitchburg for a recreational park located in the north section. The park bearing his last name is the largest in the city and bears an engraved stone memorializing his notable activities and public contributions.

A native of Birmingham, Alabama, Grammas played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the St. Louis Cardinals, Cincinnati Redlegs and Chicago Cubs. He threw and batted right- handed, and was listed as tall and . Playing career Grammas attended Mississippi State University and signed with the Chicago White Sox in 1949. During his third season in the ChiSox' farm system, he was acquired by Cincinnati in 1951 and continued his minor league apprenticeship in the Reds' organization. Loaned to the New York Yankees' Kansas City Blues affiliate in 1953 (Cincinnati at the time lacked a Triple-A farm team), Grammas collected a career-high 179 hits and batted .307. He was named the American Association's All-Star shortstop. With Roy McMillan blocking his path in Cincinnati, the Redlegs traded Grammas in December 1953 to the St. Louis Cardinals; the trade marked an unusual \\"ping-pong\\" trend in Grammas' playing career, as he would bounce between Cincinnati (prior to 1954: 1956–58) and St. Louis (1954–56; 1959–62) during the 1950s. The Cardinals finally broke the pattern in June 1962 by trading Grammas to the Cubs, where he finished his career (1962–63). Grammas was the Cardinals' starting shortstop in , and and ranked no lower than third in fielding percentage among National League shortstops each season; he finished his career with a .969 overall fielding mark. He was a reserve infielder with the Redlegs and Cubs. All told, he appeared in 913 games played over ten MLB seasons, collecting 512 hits, with 90 doubles, ten triples, 12 home runs and 163 runs batted in. He batted .247 lifetime. Managerial and coaching career In 1964, Grammas began his managing career as skipper of the Cubs' Double-A affiliate, the Fort Worth Cats of the Texas League. Although he spent the entire year at Fort Worth, as one of the Cubs' minor league pilots he was listed as a member of the Cubs' College of Coaches that season. He then joined Harry Walker's staff as the third base coach for the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1965, staying on following Walker's dismissal in mid-1967. He began his big-league managerial career when he was asked finish out the Pirates' 1969 season after Larry Shepard was fired as the team's manager on September 26. Although Grammas guided the 1969 Bucs to a 4–1 finish, Danny Murtaugh took over as the team's manager in 1970. Grammas then returned to the Cincinnati Reds as third base coach under Sparky Anderson, spending six seasons in that post during the \\"Big Red Machine\\" era, including service on Cincinnati's 1970 and 1972 National League champions and the 1975 world champions. After the Milwaukee Brewers fired Del Crandall as manager near the end of the 1975 season, his place was taken on an interim basis by Harvey Kuenn. But following the 1975 World Series, the Brewers set their sights on Grammas as their next skipper, and signed him to a three-year contract in November 1975. Milwaukee Brewers President Bud Selig said that Grammas was the only manager they wanted. He added, \\"There is no question in our mind, we got the best man available. In the years I've been in baseball, never has anybody been recommended by as broad a spectrum of people as Alex Grammas.\\" Grammas was, however, unable to bring the success he had seen with the Reds to Milwaukee. In 1976 and 1977, Grammas led the Brewers to consecutive sixth-place finishes in the American League Eastern Division, in which the Brewers finished 32 and 33 games, respectively, out of first place. Only the expansion 1977 Toronto Blue Jays, who lost 107 games in their inaugural season, kept the Brewers from consecutive last-place finishes under Grammas. A 10-5 start in 1976 led Sports Illustrated to publish a story praising Grammas' positive attitude and mental approach to the game. But the Brewers faded soon thereafter, losing 22 of their last 26 games. Internal signs of trouble were evident by mid-season in 1977. With the Brewers at 39–45, Brewers reserve first baseman Mike Hegan, who was dissatisfied with his playing time under Grammas, made national news by saying \\"Grammas is a nice guy, but as a manager, he makes a good third base coach\\". Hegan added, \\"I think that we all expected that, when he came over here, he was going to provide motivation and leadership...but that hasn't happened\\". Grammas, for his part said some players were not putting out as much effort as they had earlier in the season, that every team has players who \\"cop out\\", including the Brewers, that the team had not played up to its potential, and that \\"I would say there have been times that we could have put out a lot harder\\". After this point, the Brewers went 27-50. On November 21, 1977, Brewers President Bud Selig fired both Grammas and General Manager Jim Baumer. Grammas ended his managerial career with a record of 137-191. Grammas then returned to the coaching ranks and the Reds in 1978 as a member of Anderson's staff; then, after Anderson's controversial firing, Grammas coached under Bobby Cox with the 1979 Atlanta Braves. In mid-June of , Anderson was hired as skipper of the Detroit Tigers, and during his first off-season as Detroit's manager, he added Grammas to his staff as third base coach, where Grammas served for 12 consecutive years (1980–91), including on the Tigers' 1984 world championship season. Death Grammas died at his home in Birmingham, Alabama on September 13, 2019. Quote Grammas's family origins are from Agios Dimitrios near Sparta, Greece. *\\"I went to Greece in 1992 for the first time, and I liked Greece very much,\\" said Alex. \\"All my life my father was telling me good things about Greece. When he was talking, I was laughing, but when I saw with my own eyes, I realized he hadn't said enough about Greece. I love Greece very much. In 1992, we stayed about three weeks. I am gonna tell you, when I walked up to the Acropolis and saw the Parthenon, the hairs on my head were standing straight up. I couldn't believe it.

Applying pressure using both legs and the opponent's own shoulder, the technique is a type of lateral vascular restraint that constricts the blood flow from the carotid arteries to the brain. History Historical Kosen judo triangle choke The triangle choke was seen in early kosen judo competition. While details of its origin are unknown, it is strongly associated to Yaichibei Kanemitsu and his apprentice Masaru Hayakawa, who featured the first registered use of the move in a kosen judo tournament in Kobe, Hyogo in November 1921.乱取外編・三角絞めKaminarikai Kudo, Gakusei Judo no Dento, May 25, 1973, Hiroku Nippon Judo Earlier names for the technique would have been , or before finally settling down on . According to Kanemitsu himself, a primitive version of the move had been shown by Takenouchi-ryū master Senjuro Kanaya around 1890, though it was apparently a simpler form of neckscissors without the posterior triangle action.Yaichibei Kanemitsu, Okayama Ken Judo Shi, 1958 The sankaku-jime was officially adopted and endorsed by important judokas like Masami Oyama, and soon met plenty of use both in kosen judo and mainstream judo.Takeshi Kuroda, Mai Senshu Monogatari 51: Kanemitsu Yaichibei 9 dan – Shitei kyodo de sankaku-jime o hatsumeishi tan e-waza no oya, January 1984, Kindai Judo Tsunetane Oda, a fellow kosen judoka,Toshikazu Okada. Master Tsunetane Oda demonstrated the technique on videoTsunetane Oda - judo ne-waza 3 of 3 and is also credited with the creation of the move in some sources. The first reported variation was the front triangle choke or , applied from the position known in modern times as guard, often after a pull down or .Toshiya Masuda, Why Kimura Didn't Kill Rikidozan appendix, 2011 Another variation was the horizontal triangle or , performed from the side. Martial arts historian Toshiya Masuda has attributed its innovation to Masahiko Kimura, who would have created it during the Takudai kosen judo tournament at Takushoku University and accomplished prolonged success with it, though he also deems probable that Kimura only popularized the variation instead of creating it. The inverted variation or , typically seen in modern judo competition, was the next addition, preceding many others. Among those variations, the front triangle is particularly favored by practitioners of Brazilian jiu-jitsu. According to a popular belief maintained by Romero Cavalcanti, the technique was introduced in Brazilian jiu-jitsu by Rolls Gracie after finding it in a judo book.Roberto Pedreira, Jiu-Jitsu in the South Zone, 1997-2008, January 1, 2013 Márcio \\"Macarrão\\" Stambowsky, who was named by Rickson Gracie as one of the earliest Brazilian competitors to popularize the concept, has also credited Rolls. Other sources, like Toshiya Masuda and Roberto Pedreira, believe it might have been introduced in Brazil much earlier by Yasuichi and Naoichi Ono, disciples of Yaichibei Kanemitsu himself, as well as possibly other judo practitioners like Ryuzo Ogawa. Rolls trainee Mario Tallarico lends credibility to this theory, as does a 1935 newspaper clipping that depicts Yasuichi Ono performing a Triangle Choke in his training for an upcoming fight with Helio Gracie.https://jitsmagazine.com/submission-history-the-origins-of- the-triangle-choke/ The triangle choke was first shown in mixed martial arts on March 11, 1994, when Jason Delucia used a triangle to defeat Scott Baker at UFC 2. This variation has remained as the most commonly seen in MMA, although the side or inverted triangle has been also used; on September 26, 1995, Shooto fighter Rumina Sato submitted Isamu Osugi with a flying inverted triangle choke, while many years later, Toby Imada won 2009 Submission of the Year with an inverted triangle choke over Jorge Masvidal. Even more complex holds, like Chris Lytle's inverted mounted triangle/straight armbar combination at UFC 116 in 2010, have also surfaced.  Technique  Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Black Belt Marcos Torregrosa landing a flying triangle choke. Tactically speaking, the triangle choke is a very effective counterattack employed from the bottom position, generally applied from the guard, or open guard (defensive positions). The choke can also be applied in the mount, side mount and back mount positions by more advanced grappling practitioners. The need for isolation of one arm could be a rationale for the frequency with which it is attempted in mixed martial arts and combat sports due to the brief vulnerability of one arm while executing hand strikes against an opponent in one of the aforementioned positions. Soldiers demonstrating a triangle choke =Defensive action= To escape a triangle choke, the defending practitioner must first elevate their head so as the preclude the full force of the submission, and subsequently must bring their arm away from opposition with their own carotid artery. Once out of immediate danger of loss of consciousness, the practitioner can concentrate on reversing or escaping the figure-four lock. One method for this is to break the opponent's legs apart. With the opposing practitioner applying the choke in a bottom guard position, the defender should start to stand up, with both hands stacked and bearing weight on or above the breast opposite the arm in the choke (or gripping the collar of the opponent's gi). When the defender is nearly standing and leaning over so as to bring their weight to bear on their opponent, the defender should start to walk to the side opposite the captured arm. This pushes the defender's back and shoulder into the leg wrapped around their back, and forces the opponent's other leg to reach forward to maintain the lock. This weakens the strength of the choke and allows the defender to muscle out or force the attacker to release the choke. In mixed martial arts, it is possible for the defender to lift the person applying the choke and slam them down with a powerbomb (also known as a slam) to get them to release the hold.

Born in Amersham, Buckinghamshire, Wilson opened the bowling in Worcestershire's very first County Championship match against Yorkshire on 4 May 1899, and made his mark at once by dismissing England batsman Jack Brown before Yorkshire had scored a run. He continued in the same vein, finishing with an outstanding debut innings return of 8–70, although he was less successful (2–69) in the second innings and Worcestershire were defeated by 11 runs thanks to 6–19 from John Brown. Wilson enjoyed a fine first season in first-class cricket, finishing with 92 wickets at 22.46, including 8–46 in Worcestershire's first win, against Oxford University and eight wickets in the match in their first Championship win, against Leicestershire in late July. He also played twice against the touring Australians: once for an England XI, when he took only one wicket (that of Victor Trumper), and once for a Midland Counties side, for whom he was more successful and picked up five wickets in the game. In 1900, Wilson passed 100 wickets for the first time, a feat he was to repeat in 1901 and 1902, his best being 122 wickets in 1901. The 1900 season also saw him make his highest score of 78 against London County, batting at number 11 and adding 97 for the last wicket with Albert Bird; while in 1901, he played in a Rest of England side against Yorkshire, a game in which Gilbert Jessop scored 233 for the Rest of England in about two and a half hours. In these three summers combined, Wilson took five or more wickets in an innings on 30 occasions. From 1903 onwards, Wilson's effectiveness steadily declined; indeed, after 1901, he took fewer wickets each summer until his retirement five years later. However, he remained good enough to be selected for the Players of the South against Gentlemen of the South in 1903, while the following year he achieved career- best innings figures of 9–75 against Oxford University. In 1906 Wilson's season's bowling average, which with the exception of 1904 had remained in the low twenties throughout his career, ballooned to 36.09, and at the end of that season he retired from first-class cricket. He died in Abbots Langley, Hertfordshire, just over a month short of his 85th birthday. His son, George Clifford Wilson, played 70 times for Worcestershire between 1924 and 1926.

The seminaries are independent institutions but relate dynamically to the PC(USA) through the Committee on Theological Education, a committee of seminary presidents and ministers and elders from across the PC(USA). The Theological Education Fund (TEF) is the only denomination-wide funding system to support the schools. All PCUSA seminaries grant the Master of Divinity with some also granting other degrees, such as the Master of Theological Studies, Master of Theology, Doctor of Ministry, Doctor of Theology, and the Doctor of Philosophy degree. Presbyterian seminaries are often very highly regarded academically. That reputation is in part a reflection upon the Presbyterian emphasis on education, as well as the relatively high academic requirements for ordination in the PC(USA). The Presbyterian Church, for instance, is one of the few Protestant denominations that still requires all ministers to have a working knowledge of both Biblical Greek and Hebrew. The ten Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) seminaries relate to the denomination through the Committee on Theological Education (COTE). COTE has responsibility for providing an arena wherein a comprehensive plan for theological education from the perspective of the whole church can be developed and maintained. It seeks to identify, develop, and propose strategies for a systemic approach to theological education within the denomination. COTE serves as an advocate for theological education, seeking to support the seminaries (both financially and in other ways) and to strengthen them for their mission to the whole church. It is the body through which the seminaries report and are accountable to the denomination. COTE can also be seen as a two-way communication link between the denomination and its graduate theological institutions. List PC(USA) seminaries include: *Austin Theological Seminary *Columbia Theological Seminary *Dubuque Theological Seminary *Johnson C. Smith Theological Seminary *Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary *McCormick Theological Seminary *Pittsburgh Theological Seminary *Princeton Theological Seminary *San Francisco Theological Seminary *Union Presbyterian Seminary Two additional seminaries are related to the PC(USA) by covenant agreement. They are: *Auburn Theological Seminary *Evangelical Seminary of Puerto Rico Description These seminaries differ greatly in size, endowment, and theological viewpoints. Some, like Princeton Theological Seminary, are quite large with expansive campuses. Most, like Union Presbyterian Seminary and Columbia Theological Seminary, are more moderate in student size, but still have substantial campuses. Johnson C. Smith Theological Seminary, on the other hand, is quite small and does not have its own campus but is located on the campus of the Interdenominational Theological Center. Another important distinction to consider is the historical background of the seminary. Before the reunion of the two branches of the PCUSA in 1983, seminaries were affiliated with either the \\"Northern\\" United Presbyterian Church or the \\"Southern\\" Presbyterian Church in the United States. Princeton, Pittsburgh, Dubuque, San Francisco, McCormick and Johnson C. Smith were all \\"Northern\\" seminaries. Columbia, Union and Austin were all \\"Southern\\" seminaries. Louisville was affiliated with both churches. Additionally, Johnson C. Smith was founded as an African-American seminary, the only one of its kind in the PCUSA. Given the current atmosphere of theological debate in the church, some seminaries have become nominally associated with the liberal and conservative branches of the church in many church members' minds. Princeton and Dubuque, for instance, tend to have more conservative reputations. Columbia, McCormick, and Louisville fall on the more progressive side. In reality, there are students and faculty at all of the ten institutions who subscribe to all sides of the theological spectrum, and it's difficult to make a blanket statement about which seminary is \\"left\\" or \\"right.\\" Most PC(USA) ministers receive their training at one of these ten schools. Other schools which have educated substantial numbers of PC(USA) ministers include Harvard Divinity School, Yale Divinity School, Union Theological Seminary in New York, Vanderbilt Divinity School, Erskine Theological Seminary, Fuller Theological Seminary and Gordon- Conwell Theological Seminary. Presbyteries differ greatly in their acceptance of candidates from these non-affiliated schools. Regardless of where a candidate for ministry receives their degree, however, they are required to complete the Inquiry and Candidacy processes of the church, and to pass stringent ordination exams in order to be ordained.

He had a 13-year career in MLB for the New York Giants (1941–43, 1946–49, and 1955), Boston Braves (1950–52), Milwaukee Braves (1953), and Pittsburgh Pirates (1954–55). Gordon was one of the Giants' most popular players. In the majors he batted .283, hitting 202 home runs, and batting in 805 runs. In three different years he homered at least once in every park in which he played. A slugger, he also had a great eye—he drew 731 walks, against only 356 strikeouts. Harold Ribalow in his book The Jew in American Sports referred to Gordon as the \\"Solid Man\\". Early life Gordon was born in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn, and was Jewish.Sidney (Sid) Gordon His parents were Morris and Rose (née Meyerson) Gordon. Morris emigrated from Russia, and became a plumber and a coal dealer in the United States. Eventually, the family moved to the Flatbush section of Brooklyn. Gordon went to Samuel J. Tilden High School, where he was a star baseball player. In 1936, the year he graduated from Tilden, Gordon's high school coach arranged for Gordon to work out for Casey Stengel, then manager of the Dodgers. Stengel liked what he saw, but soon after the Dodgers fired Stengel. Gordon attended Long Island University's Brooklyn campus. Gordon kept playing in sandlot baseball, where he was noticed by scout George Mack of the Giants. In January 1938, he was signed as undrafted amateur free agent by the Giants, and Mack sent Gordon to the Milford Giants in Milford, Delaware, in the Eastern Shore Baseball League. Minor leagues At Milford in 1938, Gordon was put at third base, an unfamiliar position, but responded with a .352 average and 25 homers, while playing every game. Gordon led the league in hits (145), total bases (256), and triples (9). In 1939 Gordon played in Three-I League with the Clinton Giants. He batted .327 and hit 24 triples. In 1941 he hit .304 and stole 15 bases in the International League. At the end of the 1941 season, the Giants brought him up. Wanting to get Gordon more experience as an outfielder, manager Bill Terry sent Gordon to the Jersey City Giants in 1942, where he hit .300.Jews and Baseball: Volume 1, Entering the American Mainstream, 1871–1948 - Burton A. Boxerman, Benita W. Boxerman - Google Books Major LeaguesNY Giants (1941–43)= On September 11, 1941, he appeared in his first major league game.Sid Gordon Stats  Baseball-Reference.com The Giants put four Jewish players on the field: Gordon and Morrie Arnovich in the outfield, Harry Feldman on the mound, and Harry Danning behind the plate. Gordon's first full year in the majors came in 1943; he hit only .251, but with 32 strikeouts and 43 walks showed discipline at the plate. He also hit 11 triples, 5th in the league. =World War II (1944–45)= With World War II raging, Gordon spent 1944 and 1945 in the Coast Guard. Bill James listed Gordon as a player who may have lost a shot at the Hall of Fame due to World War II, writing \\"there are guys in the Hall of Fame who didn't have careers as good as Gordon's, and Sid missed two full seasons due to the war.\\" =NY Giants (1946–49)= Returning to baseball after the war, he was 10th in the league in on-base percentage (.380) in 1946. In 1947 he hit 8 triples, 6th highest in the league, and a career-high 13 outfield assists. The Giants broke the single-season home run record, and Gordon hit 13 of their 221. Giant manager Mel Ott had put together a one-dimensional ball club built around a lot of sluggers with little speed. Leo Durocher famously observed that Ott was too nice a guy, and his team would finish last. Durocher listed a number of players who he thought were nice guys, Gordon among them. In 1948 Gordon changed his approach to hitting under the guidance of Giant coach Red Kress. As Gordon recalled, \\"Before 1948 I could hit a fairly long ball, but it always went to right or right-center. At the Polo Grounds, right-center is just a big out. Red Kress, a coach on the Giants, used to get me to pull the ball to left. He started out by moving my right-hand grip on the bat around a little and he opened up my stance – I now put my left foot toward third when I hit. I learned to roll my wrists more and to step into the ball. Pretty soon I was dropping them in left. Red spent hours working with me on it. I can't give him enough credit.\\" In 1948 Gordon was 3rd in the National League in slugging percentage (.537), 4th in RBIs (107), 5th in home runs (30; a career high) and at-bats per home run (17.4), 6th in runs (100; a career high) and total bases (280), 8th in batting average (.299), 9th in walks (74) and OBP (.390), and 10th in stolen bases (8). He was voted onto the All-Star team for his first time. The Giants held \\"Sid Gordon Day\\" at the Polo Grounds, and he received a new car, golf clubs, and a set of luggage. July 3 was also dubbed \\"Sid Gordon Day\\" at Ebbets Field, marking a rare honor for a visiting player. He finished 4th in voting for the 1948 National League MVP. After his breakout 1948 season, Gordon held out in the spring of 1949. He signed for $2,500 ($ today) less than he wanted. In 1949 he was 4th in the league in at-bats-per-home run (18.8), 5th in home runs (26) and walks (95; a career high), 6th in OBP (.404), and 9th in slugging percentage (.505). In 1949 he homered twice in one inning, tying a major league record that still stands. He was voted onto the All-Star team for the second year in a row. He finished 30th in voting for the 1949 NL MVP. =Boston Braves/Milwaukee Braves (1950–53)= When Durocher took over in late 1949, he wanted speed and a good double play combination. In December 1949 he traded Willard Marshall, Red Webb, Buddy Kerr, and nice guy Gordon to the Boston Braves for Alvin Dark and Eddie Stanky. The deal having been consummated, Giants owner Horace Stoneham told him that \\"it broke my heart to let you go,\\" and sent Gordon a check for $2,500 as a token of his respect for the popular slugger. In 1950, he had a good year, finishing 4th in the league in slugging percentage (.557), 6th in at-bats per home runs (17.8), 7th in obp (.403), 8th in batting average (.304) and doubles (33), and 9th in home runs (27) and RBIs (103), and 10th in walks (78). He also hit 4 grand slams, tying what was then the major league record. While he hit only 5 home runs at home, he hit 22 on the road; the 17 home run disparity tied for the greatest disparity ever in one season at the time. He finished 22nd in voting for the 1950 NL MVP. Playing for Boston in 1951 and 1952, he moved with them to Milwaukee in 1953. In 1951 he finished 2nd in the league in RBIs (109; a career high), 8th in the league in home runs (29), runs (96), and at-bats per home runs (19.0), and 9th in slugging percentage (.500) and walks (80). On August 11 he hit a home run in a doubleheader, the first major league games to be telecast in color. He finished 16th in voting for the 1951 NL MVP. In 1952 he finished 4th in the league in home runs (25) and at-bats per home run (20.9), 7th in obp (.384) and slugging percentage (.483), and 8th in walks (77). He finished 30th in voting for the 1952 NL MVP. =Pittsburgh Pirates (1954–55)= In December 1953 he was traded by the Braves with Larry Lasalle, Fred Walters, Curt Raydon, Sam Jethroe, Max Surkont, and cash to the Pittsburgh Pirates for infielder Danny O'Connell. It was the only six-for-one trade in major league history, and was surpassed years later only by the 7-for-1 deal that sent Vida Blue from Oakland to San Francisco in 1978. He hit .306 for the Pirates in 1954. =NY Giants (1955)= In 1955, as the 9th- oldest player in the league, he was back with the Giants, where he ended his baseball career. Through 2010, he was third in career home runs (behind Shawn Green), fourth in RBIs (behind Buddy Myer), and sixth in hits (behind Brad Ausmus) among all-time Jewish major league baseball players. Reactions to Gordon as a Jew; Anti-Semitism A well-liked and highly regarded person wherever he traveled, Gordon was nevertheless subjected to a stark case of anti-Semitism. One day in June 1949 in St. Louis the Cardinals' bench was all over him, hurling antisemitic remarks at him. But Cards manager Eddie Dyer said, \\"Sid is a friend of mine\\", and that Gordon had been attacked not because he was Jewish but because he was a good player and \\"the good ones receive the attention of bench jockeys.\\" Gordon for his part took the high road, ignoring the antisemitic remarks and forcing the bigots to admire him. When the Dodgers were desperately looking for a Jewish player and found Sandy Koufax, Walter O'Malley told reporter Dave Anderson that he hoped Koufax would be as good as Hank Greenberg or Sid Gordon. Gordon is fourth all-time in home runs by Jewish baseball players (behind Hank Greenberg, Shawn Green and Ryan Braun), third in RBIs (behind Greenberg, Braun and Green) and sixth in hits (behind Green, Lou Boudreau, Greenberg and Brad Ausmus). In a 1976 Esquire magazine article, sportswriter Harry Stein published an \\"All Time All-Star Argument Starter\\", consisting of five ethnic baseball teams. Gordon was the left fielder on Stein's Jewish team. \\"Gordon\\" seems surprising as a Jewish name. It is usually and properly assumed to be Scottish, Norman English, or Irish, as a place name meaning \\"spacious fort.\\" However, according to Patrick Hanks and Flavia Hodges, the name is also \\"Jewish, Eastern Ashkenazic: probably a habituation name from the Belarus city of Grodno, whence the Eastern Ashkenazic surnames Gardin(ski). It goes back at least to 1657. It was widespread among Jews in Poland by the end of the 17th century, when two naturalized Polish noblemen, Henry and George Gordon, successfully introduced legislation to prevent its continued adoption by Jews. Honors *Member of the National Jewish Sports Hall of Fame (2004). *Inducted into the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame (2010). Personal life Gordon married his high school sweetheart Mary Goldberg in 1940. They had two sons, Michael and Richard. Michael was a catcher in the minors from 1963 to 1965. Death Gordon was playing softball in Central Park in New York on June 17, 1975, when he had a heart attack. Taken to Lenox Hill Hospital, he died several hours later. He was 57 years old. His wife Mary and two sons survived him. He was buried at the New Montefiore Cemetery in Farmingdale, New York.

It is now owned by Historic New England, formerly the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities (SPNEA), and operated as a study museum. The house's original section was built in 1670 by Stephen Swett, one of Newbury's first settlers, on a south-facing single-room plan with chimney bay. Under various owners, the house remained more or less unaltered until about 1720, when it was enlarged by addition of a second single-room household (with its own door) north of the original block. A new roof—made in part with salvaged rafters of the older roof—was built over the whole, changing the ridge pole direction from an east–west to a north–south axis. The chimney, then located at the northwestern corner of the main block, was retained, but its upper stack was probably modified at that time. The house underwent a series of additions during the 18th and 19th centuries when it also served as a \\"tobacconist business,\\" a chocolate mill, and a tavern. It was further extended to the north, although its irregular lot required that the eastern wall stopped two feet before the western wall. The original chimney was demolished, and a new central chimney was added to serve the 1670 and 1720 portions of the house. In 1756, the house's irregular shape was somewhat squared when the purchase of land to the north yielded an opportunity to build a final northern addition of single-room plan with stair-hall and separate chimney. The building achieved its present form with the construction of a kitchen lean-to at the western end of the house, containing one of the largest fireplaces of the period, with three beehive ovens. In 1911, the house was purchased by SPNEA, its first architectural acquisition. With advice from restoration architect Henry Charles Dean, SPNEA removed layers of lath and plaster to reveal original timbers, early 18th-century paneling, and one of the largest fireplaces in New England. Restoration stopped when funds were exhausted, before any long-gone original features like diamond-paned casements were recreated, resulting in a house with an unrestored 18th-century exterior and a partially restored interior reflecting both the 17th and early 18th centuries. After restoration, the house was rented to a series of tenants, who operated a tea room there until 1965 when the house became a study museum.

His term as governor saw a major increase in statewide taxation, including the first state sales tax, and the passage of several important civil rights bills, making Indiana one of the most friendly states to ethnic and religious minorities at that time. His tax hikes led to a near tax revolt in the state, and people began writing \\"Indiana--Land of Taxes\\" on their license plates, at entry points into the state, in stores, and other public places. The situation killed any chance he had seeking higher office and earned him the moniker \\"Sales Tax Matt\\". Despite numerous reforms and his popularity within the Democratic Party, he was defeated when he ran for governor again in 1972. After leaving office, he served as chairman of the Indiana Democratic Party, as a member of the Democratic National Committee from 1964 until 1968, and as a federal commissioner on the International Joint Commission from 1966 until 1970. Throughout his life, Welsh was known for his personal motto, \\"It doesn't cost you anything to be a gentleman.\\" After his retirement in 1972, he returned to Indianapolis, where he remained until his death in 1995. Early lifeFamily and background= Matthew Welsh was born on September 15, 1912, in Detroit, Michigan, the son of Matthew William and Inez Empson Welsh. Both of his parents were natives of Jackson County, Indiana and had only recently moved to Detroit where his father took a job as a secretary and legal counsel for an insurance company. He had three younger siblings, Mary, John and Margaret. At the outbreak of World War I, his father was hired as an industrial expediter by the federal government and began traveling often. Welsh and his mother moved to Brownstown, Indiana, where her parents lived. After the war ended, Welsh's father joined them in Brownstown, where he became the president of a local bank. In 1926, the family moved again to Vincennes, where Welsh's father took a new job as president of an investment firm.Gugin, p. 336 Welsh's father had been active in local Democratic politics for many years, and from an early age Welsh was also interested in politics. He attended public school in Vincennes and graduated from Lincoln High School in 1930.http://legdb.iga.in.gov/#!/legislator/6047/Matthew-Welsh He enrolled in the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, graduating in 1934. He enrolled in Indiana University School of Law the same year. While there, he coauthored an article with Law Professor (and future IU Dean) Frank Horack, describing Indiana's practice of enacting special legislation as a \\"twilight zone\\" of Indiana law.Randall T. Shepard, Indiana's Constitution as a Document of Special Aspirations, 69 Alb. L. Rev. 529, 534 (2006). Welsh met Mary Virginia Homann while attending IU, and the couple began a relationship. After two years at IU, Welsh transferred to the University of Chicago School of Law, where he graduated with a degree in law in 1937. The same year, he was married to Mary and the couple settled in Vincennes.Gugin, p. 338 =Politics and World War II= In Vincennes, Welsh opened a law practice and purchased a new home. He and his wife had twin daughters, Kathryn and Janet, in 1942. Welsh became involved in politics and ran for a seat in the Indiana House of Representatives and won in the 1940 election. He was reelected to his seat in 1942, but resigned after the first session of the General Assembly to enlist in the navy, as World War II broke out. Welsh saw little action during the war and spend most of it on patrol of the American coastline. In 1946, he was discharged from the navy and returned home to resume practicing law. In 1950, President Harry Truman appointed him to serve as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Indiana, a position he held until resigning in 1952 to return to his law practice. Welsh had determined not to reenter politics but in 1954 he changed his mind and ran for the Indiana Senate, winning the election. As the General Assembly was dominated by the Republican Party at that time, Welsh had very little impact during his time as senator. In 1956, his name was entered as a candidate for governorship at the State Democratic Convention, but he was narrowly defeated in the vote by Ralph Tucker, the mayor of Terre Haute. In 1957, he became the minority leader in the state senate, a position he held until 1959. Governor President John F. Kennedy in 1961 =Election= Using the power of his new position, Welsh was able to maneuver himself into being a candidate for governor again at the 1960 state convention. This time his popularity had risen to such a height that he easily overcame his opposition to secure the nomination. In the general election, he faced Lieutenant Governor Crawford F. Parker, the Republican nominee. The campaign focused primarily on the looming budget deficit and secondarily on the civil rights issues being debated nationally. Although his party lost Indiana in the presidential election, Welsh won a narrow victory at the polls, winning by about 23,000 votes out of 2.1 million cast. =Tax increases= The Indiana Statehouse in Indianapolis After taking office, Welsh was immediately confronted with the state's $18.2 million budget deficit. His predecessor, Harold Handley, had tackled the deficit with a combination of reforming the tax system, and an increase in the gasoline tax. The public, however, was not pleased with the tax increase, and was a factor Handley's defeat for the United States Senate in 1958. Despite the previous public reaction, Welsh recommended an additional tax increase to cover the deficit. The Indiana General Assembly, however, was divided with Republican strongly controlling the House, and the Democrats with only a two-vote majority in the Senate. This created deadlock on most of Welsh's taxing measures. He was able to advocate the passage of the Property Tax Assessment Act of 1961 which improved the efficiency of the revenue department, gaining the government money in administrative savings, and reimposing a small state property tax; the state property taxes had only recently been repealed in the state. A second reform bill was passed creating the Division of Tax Review which had power to review and reassess property taxes statewide. The Division of Audit was also created, which for the first time which allowed the government to audit tax data and forcibly collect it and also begin cross-checking state tax returns with federal tax returns. Warrant officers were hired who, with the assistance of a local sheriff, could seize money and property to pay delinquent tax debts. This led to thousands of individuals statewide having their unpaid back taxes seized by the government. Despite all the activity, state revenue still fell short forcing the government to use its reserve funds; an even larger deficit was predicted for the 1958 tax year. In the 1962 mid term election Republicans strengthened their majority in the House and retook the Senate. To cajole them into action, Welsh submitted two budgets to them. One \\"balanced budget\\" made drastic cuts in education and state services. A second \\"budget of needs\\" continued adequate funding of the state government, and increased funding and spending in different areas, resulting in a $447 million difference between the two biennial budgets. The General Assembly discarded both of Welsh's budgets, claiming he was trying make the budget process political by giving the assembly two bad choices; they believed there was better third option. They passed their own budget, which made a significant cut in spending, but did not authorize any new taxation. Assembly leaders recommended using the reserve fund to cover the deficit until the national economy could recover.Gugin, p. 339 After the General Assembly adjourned, Welsh launched a campaign advocating increased taxes. He argued that the state could not risk waiting on the economy to recover, and that a long-term deficit would use the entire reserve fund and leave the state in a desperate condition. He advocated a plan of tax increases in every many area he called the \\"2-2-2 plan\\". It would impose a 2% sales tax for the first time in the state, raise the state income tax to 2% on net income for individuals, and 2% on the net income of corporations. Additionally, he advocated an increased tax on cigarettes to construct two new bridge in the state. After announcing his plan, he called a 38-day special session beginning March 12, 1963, of the General Assembly to consider and adopt his plan. After the House wrangled on the issue for two weeks, they passed the plan. In the Senate, the body had a tie vote in which the Republican lieutenant governor cast the break vote, passing the measure. The bill was largely unaltered from Welsh's original proposal, and named one of the new bridges in Welsh's honor, the Matthew E. Welsh Bridge. Welsh, the lieutenant governor, and party leaders all paid a heavy political price for passing the massive tax increase, primarily because of the sales tax which was almost universally opposed by the public. Welsh's opponents labeled him \\"Sales Tax Matt\\" and a virtual statewide tax revolt ensued. Across the state the motto \\"Indiana--Land of Taxes\\" began to be displayed on car license plates, bumper stickers, placed on large billboards at entries into the state, in many businesses, and a number of other high- profile places.Gugin, p. 340 =Governmental reorganization= Welsh had an easier time persuading Republicans to make a number of reforms to state agencies and departments. The new Department of Administration, placed under the control of the Indiana Secretary of State, was created to streamline many state agencies. The state highway department was compelled reorganized, by replacing the commission that ran it with an executive director who was required to be a civil engineer, and replacing its patronage position with a merit system of hiring. The Department of Mental Health was created to consolidate the management of the states eight mental health hospitals under a single board of trustees. The board was also given oversight in a number of other areas including education for the mentally disabled, and the state alcoholic treatment center. The Department of Corrections was also signification altered to focus on rehabilitating prisoners. A new juvenile prison was built as a key feature of the new Rehabilitation Policy. The state's first art commission was created by an executive order in 1964 and was charged with promoting the arts in Indiana.Gugin, p. 341 The consolidation of the state's education system, began in 1959, was accelerated and largely completed during Welsh's term. He aggressively pursued the consolidation agenda at the recommendation of his education adviser. By the time he left office he had reduced the number of public schools in Indiana from 966 to 466. Welsh was also concerned with the lack of accessibility to higher education in the state and urged for the creation of a commission to investigate the problem and make recommendations to improve the situation. The General Assembly obliged, and the commission was created and recommended creating a state scholarship program, expanding Purdue and Indiana University to include satellite campuses around the state, and to construct several new vocational schools. Welsh endorsed the plan, which the legislature implemented during his last year in office. =Civil rights= Throughout his term, Welsh was an outspoken advocate of civil rights for African Americans and other minorities. In 1960 he successfully advocated the passage of a Fair Employment Protection Act to ensure that minorities were not discriminated against in hiring and employment. Penalties were increased for offenders of the existing laws. Welsh issued an executive order throughout the state government ordering an end to any discrimination in hiring for executive positions and ordering an anti- discrimination clause be added into all state contracts.Gugin, p. 342 In 1963 a second law was passed creating the Indiana Civil Rights Commission and given the power to investigate allegations of discrimination, issue cease and desist order, arrest offenders, and issue fines. In June of the same year, Welsh issued an executive order requiring all state departments to use their licensing powers to prohibit discrimination by adding anti-discrimination clauses to their licensing agreements. In the 1964 Democratic presidential primary election, incumbent President Lyndon Johnson refused to enter any primary races to campaign on his own behalf because he already had enough delegates in the caucus nominating states to win the nomination. Indiana was among the states that held primary elections, and Johnson's challenger, the segregationist Governor of Alabama George C. Wallace, entered the Indiana primary to show that northerners also supported his segregationist platform. Although Johnson did not approach Welsh to take any action, Welsh feared it would hurt the state Democratic party should Wallace win the state primary-- and he certainly would win because he was running unopposed. Welsh decided to personally run against Wallace only to deny him a win in Indiana, knowing Johnson had enough support in caucus states to win the nomination. Welsh stumped the state touting his civil rights credentials and denigrating Wallace. His slogan was \\"Clear the way for LBJ, vote Welsh the fifth of May.\\"Gray, p. 393 During the primary campaign, Welsh had taken part in a Civil War Centennial Tour where he visited the capitals of each of the southern states, except Alabama's, and returned the battle flags captured by Hoosier soldiers during the American Civil War in official ceremonies. Wallace refused to hold such a ceremony and Alabama's captured battle flags still remain on display in the Indiana World War Memorial.Gray, p. 394 In the primary election, Welsh won a victory over Wallace, 376,023 to 172,646. Wallace also won two delegates when he won the northwestern First Congressional District of Gary, Indiana. However, at the national convention, the Hoosiers delegation refused to award the two votes to Wallace. They voted for Welsh on the first ballot; afterwards, Welsh directed his supporters to vote for Johnson.Gray, p. 402 One of Welsh's most effective long-term changes was his gradual attempt to change the state's position on accepting money from the federal government. Since 1947, Indiana had been under a law that preventing it from accepting any money from the federal government except in cases specifically allowed by the General Assembly. This law had been enacted following the Great Depression and the government's fear at that time of the domination it had come under after accepting major amounts of money from the federal government, and the strings that came attached to it. Welsh was able to have the law overturned, with little fanfare.Gugin, p. 343 =Louie, Louie= Welsh is also known for banning radio stations in Indiana from playing the 1963 hit song Louie, Louie, for its allegedly-obscene lyrics. Later years Constitutionally prevented from seeking a consecutive term, Welsh left office in January 1965 and returned to his law practice in Vincennes. He remained active in the Democratic Party, and had been made a member of national committee in 1964, a position he held until 1968. In 1965, President Johnson appointed him the International Joint Commission that oversaw a range of issues affecting both Canada and the United States, he continued on the commission until 1970. During 1969 he also served on the Indiana Constitutional Revision Committee that authored a series of amendments reorganizing the state courts expanding the power of governors, and making several new constitutional bodies. In 1972, Welsh was nominated by his party to run for a second term as governor. The campaign was hard fought and focused much on Welsh's record as governor. His Republican opponent, Dr Otis R. Bowen, attacked him on the tax plan he had enacted, saying that it was a failure, and the state was still suffering from its effects. Welsh touted his experience and civil-rights support, but ultimately lost the election by a decisive margin. Welsh spent his final years in Vincennes, but died after seeking medical attention in Indianapolis on May 28, 1995, aged eighty-two. Throughout his life he often repeated his motto, \\"It doesn't cost you anything to be a gentleman,\\" and many of his friends and acquaintances say he lived up to it. His remains were interred in Vincennes' Memorial Park Cemetery.

Dalcroze eurhythmics influenced Carl Orff's pedagogy, used in music education throughout the United States. Dalcroze's method teaches musical concepts, often through movement. The variety of movement analogues used for musical concepts develop an integrated and natural musical expression in the student. Turning the body into a well-tuned musical instrument—Dalcroze felt—was the best path for generating a solid, vibrant musical foundation. The Dalcroze method consists of three equally important elements: eurhythmics, solfège, and improvisation. Together, according to Dalcroze, they comprise the essential training of a complete musician. In an ideal approach, elements from each subject coalesce, resulting in an approach to teaching rooted in creativity and movement. Dalcroze began his career as a pedagogue at the Geneva Conservatory in 1892, where he taught harmony and solfège. It was in his solfège courses that he began testing many of his influential and revolutionary pedagogical ideas. Between 1903 and 1910, Dalcroze had begun giving public presentations of his method. In 1910, with the help of German industrialist Wolf Dohrn, Dalcroze founded a school at Hellerau, outside Dresden, dedicated to the teaching of his method. Many musicians flocked to Hellerau, among them Prince Serge Wolkonsky, Vera Alvang (Griner), Valeria Cratina, Jelle Troelstra (son of Pieter Jelles Troelstra), Inga and Ragna Jacobi, Albert Jeanneret (Le Corbusier's brother), Jeanne de Salzmann, Mariam Ramberg, Anita Berber, and Placido de Montelio. With the outbreak of World War I in 1914, the school was abandoned. After the Second World War, his ideas were taken up as \\"music and movement\\" in British schools. Biography 250px Émile Henri Jaques was born in Vienna in 1865. He later adopted the name Émile Jaques-Dalcroze. His mother, Julie Jaques, was a music teacher, so he was in contact with music since his childhood. By influence of his mother, Dalcroze formally began his musical studies still in his early years. When he was 10 years old, his family moved to Geneva, Switzerland, and in 1877, Dalcroze joined the Conservatoire de Musique. He also studied at the College of Geneva, which he did not appreciate. Dalcroze considered the college as a \\"prison\\" where education was basically rules, which were not concerned about the students' interests. In 1881, he was part of the Belles-Lettres Literary Society, a student group dedicated to acting, writing, and performing music. At that time, Dalcroze felt more interested in composing. In 1884, he studied composition with Léo Delibes and Gabriel Fauré. Around the same year, he was part of the Comedie Francaise. Further on, he studied composition with Mathis Lussy, which influenced him in the process of rhythmic development. By the year 1886, he was the assistant conductor in Argelia, where he discovered Arab folk music. In contact with this kind of music, Dalcroze noticed that there were different worlds of rhythmic expression, each of which would require a particular way of writing, as well as a unique performance style. Accordingly, he developed a new kind of music notation. In 1887, he went to the Conservatory of Vienna, where he studied with Anton Bruckner. Dalcroze was appointed Professor of Harmony at the Conservatoire de Musique de Genève in 1892, but in 1910, he left and established his own school in Hellerau, near Dresden. Many great exponents of modern dance in the twentieth century spent time at the school, including Kurt Jooss and Hanya Holm, Rudolf Laban, Maria Rambert, Uday Shankar, and Mary Wigman. In 1911, Dalcroze and his students were invited by Prince Sergei Volkonsky to show their work in St. Petersburg and Moscow, establishing eurhythmics at the Moscow Art Theatre and inspiring Stanislavski's \\"tempo-rhythm\\".https://ttu-ir.tdl.org/ttu-ir/handle/2346/15905 His work was part of the music event in the art competition at the 1912 Summer Olympics. Dalcroze came back to Geneva in 1914 to open a new institute and in 1920, the school was moved to Helleray Laxenburg, near Vienna. However, it was closed by the Nazis. Dalcroze died in Geneva on 1 July 1950. Educational philosophy In his search for a more intense rhythmic experience, Dalcroze posed some questions. First, he questioned why music theory and notation were taught as abstractions, dissociated from sound, movements, and feelings that they represented. Moreover, by taking the pianist as an example, he asked how the finger technique taught by professors could be considered a complete musical education. Finally, he was intrigued that the qualities that characterize a real musician were rarely experienced in a music class. Dalcroze believed the first instrument that must be trained in music is the body. He developed techniques that combined hearing with a physical response, transferring to a physical response in singing and reading music. He did many experiments with his students, used to help in the process of learning and feeling music. His main goal was to develop the inner ear to facilitate musical thinking, reading, and writing music without the help of an instrument. While continuing to build his methodology, he observed his students and noticed that the students who could not play in time in the music world, were able to walk in time in the real world. The walking was completely spontaneous and easy.http://www.dalcroze.org.uk/resources/Article%20-%20Jacqueline%201.pdf He observed that some of his best students could tap the beat using their feet, or shake their heads and bodies in response to music. This physical response was natural and common to all ages and cultures. Moreover, he noticed that students would change their movements when following a crescendo, and would respond physically to the accents of the music. They also relaxed their muscles with the endings of phrases. As they seemed to hear the music, feeling its effects, he concluded that the students themselves were the instruments, not the piano. Dalcroze eurhythmics Dalcroze noticed that students had a mechanical understanding instead of a musical comprehension. They were not able to hear harmonies that they wrote in the music theory classes, and they could not create simple melodies and chord sequences. This resulted in a lack of musical sensitivity that caused problems in the performance. His aim was to find ways to help students to develop skills to feel, hear, create, imagine, connect, memorize, read, and write, as well as perform and interpret music. He worked in order to free his students from the conflicts between mind and body, feeling and expression.http://www.dalcroze.org.uk/resources/Article%20-%20Anita%202.pdf Dalcroze realized that the aspects of music that are more connected to the senses are rhythm and movement. Regarding the three elements of music, pitch, rhythm, and dynamic, he recognized that the last two were entirely dependent on movement. He also found their best models in the muscular system. For him, all degrees of time (tempi) can be experienced, understood, and expressed through the body. He felt that the enthusiasm of musical feelings depended on the sharpness of physical sensations. He was convinced that the combination of intense listening and the responses of the body would generate and release a powerful musical force. Dalcroze needed a laboratory to test his theories. By working with students, he decided to hire his own workspace. He started to look for principles, teaching strategies, teaching styles, and methods that could convert music into a practical educational tool. The principles and methods which he developed were unique and new, so he gave them a special name: eurhythmics.http://www.dalcroze.org.uk/resources/Article%20-%20Anita%201.pdf In the beginning, Dalcroze thought that the solution to many problems would be teaching musicians to contract and relax in a specific time (the speed of sound or time), in a specific space (the duration of a sound), and with a particular force (energy dynamics of a sound). Thus, he worked on a new series of exercises designed to help students strengthen their perception by the metric and its instincts by many streams of the movement, called rhythm. Then, he began to propose exercises by playing music and suggesting that students walk as they would feel the pulse. Surprisingly, students acted differently and had difficulties in different tempos. Therefore, he deduced that people still had trouble reaching the goal of speed, accuracy, and performance by being rhythmically expressive. He realized that there could be some system of quick communication between the brain, which understands and analyzes, and the muscles that perform. =Objectives of Dalcroze eurhythmics= 1\\\\. Mental and emotional: awareness, concentration, social integration, realization, and expression of nuances. 2\\\\. Physical: to make the performance easier, to make the performance accurate, to develop personal expressiveness through the performance. 3\\\\. Musical: quickness, precision, comfort, expressive personal response to the listening, analysis, writing, and improvisation. Dalcroze Eurhythmics practices 3 concepts: * Eurhythmics – Musical expression through movement; developing musical skills through kinetic exercises. The students can learn rhythm and structure by listening to music and expressing what they hear through spontaneous bodily movement. * Solfège – Helps develop ear- training and sight-singing skills. Dalcroze utilized a fixed tonic (fixed-do) solfége system believing that all children can eventually develop perfect pitch. * Improvisation – Using instruments, movement, and voice. =Techniques of Dalcroze eurhythmics= In 1905, Dalcroze organized thousands of games and exercises by connecting beautiful music, intense listening, and consciously improvised movement. According to him, the professor must be able to improvise the songs for the activities in the music class. The motions approached by Dalcroze were: movements, postures, and gestures to express the tempo, duration, dynamics, accents, and other elements that produce rhythmic material.http://musiced.about.com/od/lessonplans/p/dalcroze.htm =Methods and exercises= * 12 kleine melodische und rhythmische Studien, for piano (Berlin: Simrock, 1913) * 16 plastische Studien, for piano (Berlin: Simrock, 1913) * 20 Caprices and Rhythmic Studies, for piano (London: Augener, 1920) * 50 Études miniatures de métrique et rythmique, for piano (Paris: Sénart, 1923) * 10 mehrstimmige Gesänge ohne Worte zu plastischen Studien (Berlin: Simrock) * 3 Vocalises (Paris: Heugel) * 6 Exercices pratiques d'intonation (Lausanne: Foetisch) * 6 Jeux rythmiques pour enfants et adolescents pour le piano (Paris: Heugel) * 6 Petites pièces en rythmes alternés, for piano (Lausanne: Foetisch) * Esquisses rythmiques, for piano (Lausanne: Foetisch) * Exercices de disordination, for piano (Paris: Enoch) * La Jolie musique, jeux et exercices pour les tout petits, for voice (Le Locle: Huguenin) * Marches rythmigues, for voice and piano (Lausanne: Foetisch) * Métrique et rythmique, 200 études, for piano (Paris: Lemoine * Moderne Tonleiterschule (with R.

(née Mountbatten; born 19 April 1929) is a British aristocrat and relative of the British royal family. She is the younger daughter of Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma, formerly Prince Louis of Battenberg, and Edwina Ashley. Through her father, Lady Pamela is a first cousin of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, and a grandniece of the last Empress of Russia, Alexandra Feodorovna. She served as a bridesmaid and later as a lady-in-waiting to Queen Elizabeth II.  Early life and family  Lady Pamela was born on 19 April 1929 in Barcelona, Spain to Edwina Ashley and Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma. She is the second of two children, as a younger sister of Patricia Knatchbull, 2nd Countess Mountbatten of Burma. A member of the Mountbatten family by birth, she descended from the Battenberg family, a morganatic cadet branch of the House of Hesse-Darmstadt. At the request of George V her father, who was born Prince Louis of Battenberg, relinquished his German princely title in 1917, along with his parents Prince Louis of Battenberg and Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine, in exchange for titles in the British peerage due to anti-German sentiment in Britain. Her father was created as the Earl Mountbatten of Burma and her grandfather was created the Marquess of Milford Haven. Through her father she is a great-great granddaughter of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Her mother, Edwina, was the daughter of Wilfrid Ashley, 1st Baron Mount Temple. Through her mother, Lady Pamela is also a great-great granddaughter of Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury. Through her father, she is a first cousin of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. She attended Hewitt School in New York City. In 1947, Lady Pamela accompanied her parents to India remaining with them throughout her father's term as Viceroy of pre-Independence India and then Governor-General of post-Partition India through 1948, living with them in Government House, New Delhi and the summer Viceregal Lodge in Simla.  Official duties  In November 1947, Lady Pamela acted as a bridesmaid to then-Princess Elizabeth at her 1947 wedding to Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. As lady-in-waiting to Princess Elizabeth she was with her and the Duke of Edinburgh in Kenya when King George VI died on 6 February 1952. In late 1953 and early 1954, she accompanied the Queen as lady- in-waiting on the royal tour to Jamaica, Panama, Fiji, Tonga, New Zealand, Australia, Ceylon, Aden, Libya, Malta and Gibraltar. Queen Elizabeth II and her Lady-in-Waiting Lady Pamela Mountbatten arrive at a Women's Reception at Brisbane City Hall, 1954.

In the period from 1972 to 1976, Shogakukan published the 20-volume first edition. The 14-volume second edition was published in the period from November 2000 to December 2001. It includes substantial additions to and improvements over the first edition. Composition The first edition of 1972–76 included some 450,000 entries in 20 volumes, while the second edition reduced the number of volumes to 13 (by making each volume much bigger) and added 50,000 entries. The Second edition is the largest Japanese dictionary published with roughly 500,000 entries and supposedly 1,000,000 example sentences. It was composed under the collaboration of 3000 specialists, not merely Japanese language and literature scholars but also specialists of History, Buddhist studies, the Chinese Classics, and the social and physical sciences, over the course of 40 years. Entries are listed by kana, in the gojūon (五十音) order (the native alphabetical order of the Japanese syllabary). They provide the most common kanji used to write the word, the part of the speech, the various definitions, some early examples of the use of the word, and notes on the pronunciation. The first edition required the use of a slim supplementary pamphlet to track down the date and author of the historical works cited, but the dates have now been incorporated into the actual entries in the second edition. A supplementary volume includes an index of kanji, dialect words, and greater detail of the historical citations. Shogakukan has compared its Nikkoku dictionary to the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) because the Nikkoku represents the largest and most thorough dictionary of the Japanese language, and also provides etymologies and historical citations for its entries. Most entries contain citations from early known usages of the word in a text. Concise edition (〔精選版〕日本国語大辞典) is based on the 2nd edition, with 3 volumes, 300,000 entries, 300,000 examples. Uses The Nikkoku, because of its size, has many features normally found only in specialized dictionaries. These include: definitions and etymologies of foreign loan words (gairaigo, 外来語), highly recent words (gendai yōgo, 現代用語), archaic words (kogo, 古語), idiomatic compound phrases (jukugo, 熟語), words that can be written using more than one possible Chinese character to produce subtle differences in meaning (dōkun iji, 同訓異字), and Chinese characters that are written differently but have the same pronunciation (iji dōkun, 異字同訓), some slang (ingo, 隠語), and words used only in regional dialects (hōgen, 方言). Certain specialized dictionaries may have a few entries that do not exist in the Nikkoku, and many specialized scholars will need to rely on specialized dictionaries, but it is certainly sufficient for most general reference needs. Evaluation The cost and size of this dictionary makes it somewhat unsuitable as a desktop reference; however, it is essential for learning the full range of a word's meanings. Online On July 2, 2007, the dictionary became available online via Japan Knowledge. For a monthly fee, it is accessible to individuals and institutions.

The ideology is defined in opposition to more optimistic outlooks on life. Doomers believe that government corruption, civilian apathy, and/or structural oppression are unfixable. Common themes Doomers tend to express feelings of despair and hopelessness about their own lives. The subreddit r/doomer was created in 2009 as a place for doomers to express their feelings and thoughts. A post written by Redditor u/newdoomr on 18 January 2020 titled \\"notes from a doomer\\" lists the doomer frustrations to the public at-large, questioning how they \\"are not all walking around in a state of pure unquellable panic.\\" Expressed within the text of the post is a determination that doomers are \\"awake\\" to the knowledge that the world is a cruel, sick, and meaningless place, that humans are only capable of destroying the natural world, and that even if doomers could \\"ascend\\" past their anxieties, it would be pointless, as the world is faced with inevitable collapse. The moderators of r/doomer pinned the post, and as of 8 August 2020, it had received 207 upvotes.  History Peaknik Subculture= The term \\"doomer\\" was reported in 2008 as being used in early internet peaknik communities, notably on internet forums where members discussed the theorized point in time when oil extraction would stop due to lack of resources, followed by societal collapse. Doomers of the mid-aughts subscribed to various ideas on how to face this impending collapse, including doomsday prepping, as well as more contemporary feelings of resignation and defeat. Canadian Doomer Paul Chefurka hosted a website where he encouraged his readers to eat lower on the food chain, modify their homes for the apocalypse, and to consider not to bring children into the world. Notably, unlike modern doomers, some of these peaknik doomers did not subscribe to such fatalist strategies. U.S. Army Ranger Chris Lake, when writing recommendations on how to survive the societal collapse, suggested that doomers \\"adopt a positive attitude,\\" because, as he put it, \\"Hard times don't last, hard people do.\\" =Wojak \\"Doomer\\" internet meme= By 2018, 4chan users had begun creating Wojak caricatures with the -oomer suffix to mock various groups online, the first of which was titled the \\"30-year-old Boomer,\\" a criticism of Millennials who had a similar outlook and ideas as Baby Boomers. This is the same trend that popularized the term \\"Zoomer\\" when referring to members of Generation Z. Three of these caricatures were referred to as \\"Bloomers\\", \\"Gloomers\\" and \\"Doomers\\". All three of these characters were created as gradients of the same 20-something Zoomer. \\"Bloomers\\", in this context, are Zoomers who are well-adjusted adults, \\"Gloomers\\" are Zoomers who are depressed because they aren't as well-adjusted. Doomers, in contrast, were Zoomers who \\"simply stopped trying\\". As Kaitlyn Tiffany, a social media journalist from The Atlantic observed, 2018 Doomers were \\"no longer pursuing friendships or relationships, and get no joy from anything because they know that the world is coming to an end.\\" =Use in Media= The term \\"doomer\\" was later brought into popular use in the commentary surrounding Jonathan Franzen's 2019 essay in The New Yorker titled \\"What if We Stopped Pretending\\". The piece made an argument against the possibility of averting climatic catastrophe. In addition to popularizing the term among general audiences, Franzen's piece was highly popular among online Doomer communities, including the Facebook groups Near Term Human Extinction Support Group and Abrupt Climate Change. In an article in the BBC, Jem Bendell's self-published paper Deep Adaptation: A Map for Navigating Climate Tragedy was described as \\"the closest thing to a manifesto for a generation of self-described 'climate doomers'\\". As of March 2020, the paper had been a downloaded more than a half million times. In it, Bendell claims there is no chance to avert a near-term breakdown in human civilization. As the BBC review also noted, \\"Prof Michael Mann, one of the world's most renowned [climate scientists], describes Bendell's paper as 'pseudo-scientific nonsense'\\". The New York Times notes that supporters of Uncivilization: The Dark Mountain Manifesto have been described as \\"doomers\\" for the reckless nature of the text's message. The manifesto critiques the idea of progress, having been published by Paul Kingsnorth and Dougald Hine to signal the beginning of the artists' group the Dark Mountain Project. In February 2020, Kate Knibbs of Wired noted the development of a popular and growing strain of \\"doomer\\" climate fiction, in contrast to the typically optimistic undertones of the genre. In addition, Amy Brady, a climate fiction columnist for the Chicago Review of Books, notes that the genre has moved from future scenarios to near-past and present stories.  Criticism  Climate scientist Michael Mann sees doomerism as a \\"dangerous new strain of crypto- denialism\\", stating that the doomer ideas \\"will lead us down the very same path of inaction as outright climate change denial. Fossil fuel interests love this framing.\\" A critique of Deep Adaptation in OpenDemocracy argues that \\"[Bendell's] claim that runaway climate change has made societal collapse inevitable is not only wrong, but that it undermines the cause of the climate movement.\\" It instead argues that whilst \\"there are real reasons for despair\\", \\"the choice to believe in an inevitable collapse is itself a luxury, a form of escapism only available to those with the time and resources to plan for its consequences.\\" See also *Ecological grief *Climate grief *Anarcho- primitivism *Deindustrialization *Apocalypse *Human overpopulation *Millenarianism *Myth of Progress *Overshoot (population) *Pessimism#Technological and environmental *Societal collapse *What a Way to Go: Life at the End of Empire ReferencesExternal links * Doomsters(sic) - A journal article discussing peak oil and \\"Doomsters\\" Category:Survivalism Category:Nihilism Category:Internet memes introduced in 2018 ","title":"Doomer"},{"id":"2763406","text":"UNM or unm may refer to: * University of New Mexico, a state university in New Mexico in the United States * Universidad Nacional de México, former name of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México) in Mexico City * United National Movement (Georgia) (Ertiani Natsionaluri Modzraoba), a political organization in the country Georgia * Unum, Chattanooga, Tennessee-based insurance company * Upper motor neuron * Unami language's ISO 639-3 code ","title":"UNM"},{"id":"2763412","text":"In linguistics, a hypostasis (from the Greek word ὑπόστασιςHenry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon meaning foundation, base or that which stands behind) is a relationship between a name and a known quantity, as a cultural personification (i.e. objectification with personality) of an entity or quality. It often connotes the personification of typically elemental powers, such as wind and fire, or human life, fertility, and death.

In Neoplatonism the hypostasis of the soul, the intellect (nous) and \\"the one\\" was addressed by Plotinus. In Christian theology, a hypostasis is one of the three hypostases (Father, Son, Holy Spirit) of the Trinity. Ancient Greek philosophy Pseudo-Aristotle used hypostasis in the sense of material substance.Pseudo-Aristotle, De mundo, 4.19. Neoplatonists argue that beneath the surface phenomena that present themselves to our senses are three higher spiritual principles, or hypostases, each one more sublime than the preceding. For Plotinus, these are: the Soul, the Intellect, and the One.Neoplatonism (Ancient Philosophies) by Pauliina Remes (2008), University of California Press , pp. 48–52. Christian theology In early Christian writings, hypostasis is used to denote \\"being\\" or \\"substantive reality\\" and is not always distinguished in meaning from ousia ('essence' or 'substance'). It was used in this way by Tatian and Origen, and also in the anathemas appended to the Nicene Creed of 325. =Trinitarian definitions= It was mainly under the influence of the Cappadocian Fathers that the terminology was clarified and standardized so that the formula \\"three hypostases in one ousia\\" came to be accepted as an epitome of the orthodox doctrine of the Trinity. Specifically, Basil of Caesarea argues that the two terms are not synonymous and that they, therefore, are not to be used indiscriminately in referring to the godhead. He writes: This consensus, however, was not achieved without some confusion at first in the minds of Western theologians since in the West the vocabulary was different. Many Latin-speaking theologians understood hypo-stasis as \\"sub- stantia\\" (substance); thus when speaking of three \\"hypostases\\" in the godhead, they might suspect three \\"substances\\" or tritheism. However, from the middle of the fifth century onwards, marked by Council of Chalcedon, the word came to be contrasted with ousia and used to mean \\"individual reality,\\" especially in the trinitarian and Christological contexts. The Christian concept of the Trinity is often described as being one god existing in three distinct hypostases/personae/persons.

He was the batting coach for the Toronto Blue Jays' Triple-A affiliate, the Buffalo Bisons. Hebner was known for working as a gravedigger at a cemetery run by his father and brother, Dennis, during the offseason. Early years The left-handed batting Hebner threw right-handed, and was originally a shortstop when he was drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates in the first round (15 overall) of the 1966 MLB draft out of Norwood High School (Massachusetts). He was moved to third base in the minors, and batted .308 with twelve home runs and 84 runs batted in (RBI) over three seasons in the minors to receive a September call-up to the majors in 1968. Pittsburgh Pirates When Manny Mota was selected by the Montreal Expos in the 1968 Major League Baseball expansion draft, it created a hole at third base that Hebner was expected to fill. Hebner got off to a torrid start to his rookie season, as he flirted with a .400 batting average through the middle of May. By season's end, he settled into a .301 average with eight home runs and 47 RBI. Hebner put up similar numbers in 1970 (.290 average, 11 home runs, 46 RBIs), but crushed Chicago Cubs pitching (.333 average, 3 home runs, 13 RBI in 15 games) to help his team capture the National League East by five games over their division rival. Despite the fact that they were swept by Cincinnati's mighty \\"Big Red Machine\\" in the 1970 National League Championship Series, Hebner had a great series. He was four- for-six with two walks. Whereas his batting average dipped in 1971 (.271), Hebner's power numbers increased, as he clubbed seventeen home runs and drove in 67. The Pirates repeated as division champions to face the San Francisco Giants in the 1971 National League Championship Series. With the series tied at one game apiece, and the Pirates winning the third game by a score of 1-0, Hebner committed a throwing error in the sixth inning that allowed the Giants to tie the score. He redeemed himself in the eighth, hitting a game-winning solo shot off Juan Marichal to give the Pirates the 2-1 edge in the series. He provided similar heroics in the fourth game of the NLCS with another Hall of Fame pitcher on the mound. With the Giants leading 5-2, Hebner hit a three run home run off Gaylord Perry to tie the score. The Pirates went on to a 9-5 victory, and faced the Baltimore Orioles in the World Series. Hebner continued his trend of hitting home runs off Hall-of-Famers, as the only scoring the Pirates did off Jim Palmer in the second game of the series was Hebner's three-run homer. The Pirates would win the World Series in seven games. Hebner clubbed nineteen home runs and batted an even .300 in 1972 to help his team cruise to the postseason for the third straight year. He hit a career high 25 home runs in 1973, the most memorable of which came when the St. Louis Cardinals and Pirates went into extra innings in the first game of a September 3 doubleheader. With the two teams battling for first place in the division, Hebner led off the bottom of the thirteenth inning with a walk off inside-the- park home run. Both teams would eventually succumb the division to the New York Mets in 1973, but they would again find themselves in a tight race in 1974. Hebner hit a three-run home run off Cardinals closer Al Hrabosky at Three Rivers Stadium on September 19 to carry his team to an 8-6 victory. Four days later, his team would travel to St. Louis. The Pirates' Jim Rooker and Cardinals' Lynn McGlothen both pitched masterfully, as the game headed into extra innings scoreless. In the top of the tenth, Hebner drove in Miguel Dilone for the only run of the game. They would go on to win the division by a game and a half over the Cards. After batting a career low .246, and seeing a dropoff in every offensive category in 1975, Hebner's salary was cut by the Pirates for 1976. Hebner was unhappy with his club's decision, and made his feelings known to the fans and media. Coupled with an abysmal month of May (.149 batting average, 5 RBI), this landed Hebner square in the crosshairs of Pirates fans and sports writers. After hovering in the low .200s for most of the 1976 season, he rebounded with an excellent month of September to bring his season average to .249 with eight home runs and 51 RBIs (both even further dropoffs from the previous season). Needing a change in scenery, Hebner opted to play out his contract and become a free agent at the end of the season. Pirates general manager Pete Peterson attempted to dissuade Hebner from signing with another team, and offered to match any dollar offer he received elsewhere. Regardless, Hebner signed with the division rival Philadelphia Phillies. Philadelphia Phillies With perennial All-Star and Gold Glove winner Mike Schmidt manning third base, the Phillies shifted Hebner (who had never excelled defensively at third base) across the diamond to first. Hebner took to his new position nicely and also enjoyed something of a renaissance with the bat. He batted .285 with eighteen home runs and 62 RBI to help the Phillies return to the postseason for a second year in a row. Hebner was part of a controversial play in the 1977 National League Championship Series. With the series tied at one game apiece, and the Phillies holding onto a 5-3 lead in game three at Veterans Stadium, Dusty Baker and Rick Monday led off the Dodger half of the ninth inning with ground outs, tying Hebner for the NLCS record for putouts with fourteen. After a single by Vic Davalillo and double by Manny Mota scoring Davalillo, Davey Lopes hit a ground ball to third that Schmidt was unable to handle cleanly. Phillies shortstop Larry Bowa quickly picked up the ball, and hurled it to Hebner for what appeared to be the final out of the game, and a National League record fifteenth putout for Hebner. First-base umpire Bruce Froemming called Lopes safe, however, allowing Mota to score the tying run. After a botched pickoff attempt moved Lopes to second, Bill Russell drove him home with a single to center for the game-winning run. The Phillies won their division again in 1978, only to fall to the Dodgers in the National League Championship Series for a second year in a row. Believing that his team was one piece away from being a World Series team, Phillies GM Paul Owens heavily pursued Cincinnati Reds free agent Pete Rose, with the intention of converting him into a first baseman. When Rose signed a four-year deal with the club on December 5, Hebner became trade bait for a much needed starting pitcher. Hebner was outspoken during spring training 1979 about his disappointment over the signing of Rose. After considering moving Hebner to second base or into the outfield, the Phillies returned to plan A, and put him on the trading block for a starting pitcher. On March 27, he and minor leaguer José Moreno were traded to the New York Mets for Nino Espinosa. New York Mets The much-hyped new acquisition was sold to Mets fans as the savior who would turn the struggling franchise around. He went four-for-five with a home run, two doubles and four RBIs in his first game as a Met, but it was obvious that Hebner, who was used to playing for contenders, hated playing for a team that consistently finished in last place in the NL East. He also did not take well to returning to third base after two seasons away from the \\"hot corner,\\" displaying limited range and logging a below average .940 fielding percentage for the season. As the result of an umpire strike, MLB went with replacements umpires to open the 1979 season. They often received the brunt of Hebner's frustration. On April 15, the Mets faced Hebner's former franchise, the Phillies, in a doubleheader. Home plate umpire Dave Pallone called a strike on Hebner in his first at-bat in the first game that Hebner believed was high. Hebner offered an obscenity laced opinion of the call before grounding out to second. As he ran out the ground ball, he shoved Pete Rose at first base. He then returned to home plate yelling and bumping Pallone about the called strike. Along the way, Hebner was ejected from the game, and needed to be restrained by teammates and coaches. He also had a run-in with Lanny Harris on August 19 at Riverfront Stadium. With the Mets trailing the Reds 5-2, Hebner led off the sixth inning with a walk. There was a play at the plate as he attempted to score all the way from first on Ed Kranepool's double. Though instant replay showed that Hebner clearly touched home plate before Johnny Bench's tag, Harris called him out. A huge argument ensued with Hebner once again being ejected. He batted .182 in July, and .230 with no home runs and six RBIs in August. He soon began feeling the ire of the frustrated Mets fan base, and once flipped-off the Shea Stadium crowd following a strikeout to show them that the feeling was mutual. Hebner ended the season tied with Lee Mazzilli for the team lead in RBIs with 79. Regardless, on October 31, 1979, the Mets traded Hebner to the Detroit Tigers for Phil Mankowski and former Met Jerry Morales. Detroit Tigers Hebner began his Tiger career at third base, but was shifted back to first base when the Tigers traded away first baseman Jason Thompson. Hebner was batting .291 with a team leading 82 RBIs when he strained instep ligaments in his right foot on August 22 against the Minnesota Twins. It limited him to eight at-bats over the rest of the 1980 season. Hebner hit a game-winning three-run home run on opening day of the 1981 season. Soon afterwards, however, he would fall into the worst slump of his career. Following an RBI single in the second game of the season, Hebner would not collect another RBI for the rest of April. His batting average hovered below .200 for most of the first half of the season, inching just barely over the \\"Mendoza Line\\" (.206) when the players' strike came. His hitting improved slightly when play resumed (.253) to bring him to .226 with five home runs and 28 RBIs for the season. With Enos Cabell's acquisition during spring training 1982, Hebner entered into a righty/lefty platoon with Cabell at first base. The system seemed to be working as both ended the month of May batting over .300, but he would still wind up on waivers on August 13 to make room for prospect Howard Johnson. Shortly afterwards, he returned to the Pirates for a player to be named later. Pirates and Cubs Despite having never played the outfield in his professional career, Hebner was used in right field to fill in for an ailing Dave Parker. On September 14, Hebner and Bill Madlock both connected for grand slam home runs in the same game against the Chicago Cubs. It was the 31st time this occurred in major league history. Hebner remained in a part-time role with the Pirates through the 1983 season. After which, he signed with the Chicago Cubs as a free agent. Used primarily as a pinch hitter, and occasionally filling in at first and third, he played a valuable role for the team that reached the postseason for the first time since 1945. He returned to that role with the Cubs in 1985, and was among the league leaders in pinch hits before ending the season in an 0 for 22 slump. He still led the majors with twelve pinch-hit RBIs. When his contract was up, the Montreal Expos sought Hebner, but he re-signed with the Cubs. Following a poor spring, he was released. Rather than try to catch on with the Expos or any other team, he retired. Coaching Hebner was named manager of the Myrtle Beach Blue Jays in November 1987, and led the team to an 83-56 finish. He was named first-base coach of the Toronto Blue Jays, but shortly after accepting the job, he moved over to the Boston Red Sox organization to replace Walt Hriniak as batting coach. He held that job through the 1991 season, after which manager Joe Morgan and his entire coaching staff were fired. He returned to the Toronto Blue Jays organization in November 1992 as minor-league hitting instructor. He was placed in an awkward position by the organization during the players' strike that canceled the end of the 1994 season. When the owners decided to go with replacement players the following spring, the Blue Jays determined that they would prefer that manager Cito Gaston and his major league staff not work with the strike-breakers. Instead, Hebner and fellow minor league coaches Bob Didier and Reggie Cleveland were given the task while Gaston worked with minor leaguers who would not be asked to break rank. When the strike finally ended in March 1995, Hebner began coaching the triple A Syracuse Chiefs. He was promoted to manager of the club in June, and remained at the helm through the 1996 season. He returned to the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1998 as the hitting coach for the triple A Nashville Sounds, and managed the Sounds for the second half of the 2000 season after former manager Trent Jewett was promoted to the major league coaching staff. He returned to the major leagues as part of former teammate Larry Bowa's coaching staff on November 7, 2000, following Bowa's hiring as manager of the Phillies. He was fired after one season as their hitting coach despite increases in every offensive category in 2001. In January 2002, he was hired by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays as hitting coach for the triple A Durham Bulls of the International League. When he was fired at the end of the 2006 season, he jumped to the Chicago White Sox organization as hitting coach for the double A Birmingham Barons. He spent just one season at Birmingham, then was hired as manager of the Frederick Keys 49 games into the 2008 campaign on May 26, replacing Tommy Thompson who was granted a leave of absence due to personal reasons. In the two seasons under Hebner's watch, the Keys went 35-55 (6-15/29-40) in 2008 and 64-75 (31-38/33-37) in 2009. He was named the hitting coach for the Norfolk Tides on January 7, 2010; he lasted one season in that capacity, as the Orioles declined to retain him on September 24.

The word Koori refers to Aboriginal Australians from the State of Victoria in south-east Australia. Koori Courts were created in order to allow participation of the Aboriginal community and culture in the legal system, in an attempt to bridge the differences between Indigenous Customary law and Australia's common law system. They began operation in 2002, and are held on a designated day in an ordinary courthouse. The laws administered are exactly the same as in any Australian courthouse, but the format of the hearing is different. In Koori Court, the Magistrate or Judge sits at a table with the offender, solicitors and community elders, and legalese is not allowed. The defendant may have members of their family sit with them and participate in the proceedings. Prosecutors have personal conversations with the defendant about their circumstances, in order to arrive at the most suitable and culturally appropriate sentence. An elder from the community is present to advise the Magistrate on the sentence. The Koori Courts have been successful in not only reducing recidivism but also in strengthening the role of community elders and family structures. Koori Courts in Victoria are located in Bairnsdale, Broadmeadows, Latrobe Valley (Morwell), Mildura, Shepparton and Warrnambool. There are also two Koori Children's Courts, one in Melbourne and one in Mildura. A Koori County Court operates at Melbourne and La Trobe valley. The Koori Courts are an initiative of the Victorian Aboriginal Justice Agreement, a joint partnership strategy between the Victorian Government and the Victorian Koori Community developed to reduce Indigenous over-representation in the criminal justice system and to improve justice outcomes for the Koori Community. A year-long pilot of the Koori Court model was conducted at Parramatta children’s court in 2015. However the programme did not receive ongoing funding. The Koori Courts cannot deal with family violence or sexual offences.

The Karelian ASSR was formed as a part of the Russian SFSR by the Resolution of the Presidium of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee (VTsIK) of June 27, 1923 and by the Decree of the VTsIK and the Council of People's Commissars of July 25, 1923 from the Karelian Labor Commune.Administrative-Territorial Division of Murmansk Oblast, p. 31 In 1927, the ASSR was divided into districts,Administrative-Territorial Division of Murmansk Oblast, p. 35 which replaced the old volosts. From 1940 to 1956, territory annexed from Finland (which had briefly constituted a puppet Finnish Democratic Republic) was incorporated with the previous Karelian Autonomous Republic to form the Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic, which had the status of a union republic in the federal structure of the Soviet Union. However, by this time, only a small portion of the population of this region was of Karelian or Finnish ethnic background. Some later historians believe that this unorthodox upgrade was likely a \\"convenient means for facilitating the possible incorporation of additional Finnish territory\\" (or all of Finland) or \\"at least a way to keep Finland continuously under the gun\\". On July 16, 1956, the SSR was downgraded from a Union Republic to an ASSR, and retroceded to the Russian SFSR. Beginning on August 9, 1990, the Karelian ASSR declared state sovereignty and renamed to the Karelian Soviet Socialist Republic (; ). The Karelian SSR was renamed to the Republic of Karelia on November 13, 1991 and remains a federal subject of Russia.

Early years Otto was born in Großschirma, Saxony on 23 October, 1874. His father was a railway official. In 1889 he started to train as teacher in Oschatz. Whilst there he became involved with the German Freethinkers League. In 1895 he became the private tutor for the Countess von Bühren, whilst also teaching at Öderan. Political career He joined the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) in 1896 and soon established a socialist Sunday school. However he was dismissed as a primary school teacher in 1902, and soon supported himself as a writer and editor of social democratic newspapers in Hamburg, followed by Breslau, Chemnitz, Pirna and Zwickau. Rühle had already became a vocal critic of existing teaching methods and set up a social democratic educational society for the Hamburg area. In 1907 he became an itinerant teacher for the In 1907 he became a traveling teacher of the SPD's educational committee and developed a reputation in the SPD, through his socially critical educational writings: \\"Work and Education\\" (1904), \\"The Enlightenment of Children About Sexual Matters\\", (1907), and, above all, \\"The Proletarian Child\\" (1911). Rühle joined Karl Liebknecht, Rosa Luxemburg, Franz Mehring and others in founding the group and magazine Internationale, which proposed a revolutionary internationalism against a world of warring states. In 1916, Rühle also took part in the Spartacus League. =Reichstag= In 1912 he was elected as deputy for Pirna-Sebnitz, in Saxon Switzerland. He represented the SPD in the Reichstag. In 1918, Rühle decided not to seek re-election. Following the disorderly period of time in Germany, 1918–19, the dissolution of the Reichstag, which would subsequently be the end of Rühle's term in office, is not exactly known. However, given that the abdication of Wilhelm II was the first event in a series of events that would eventually lead to a new republic, this is the date that shall be put as the end of his term in office. The German Revolution The Spartacus League took an oppositional stance to Leninism and was criticized by the Bolsheviks for inconsistency. Although Liebknecht and Luxemburg were murdered in 1919 for their involvement in the German Revolution, Rühle lived on to participate in the left opposition of the German labour movement, developing both an early communist critique of Bolshevism and an early opposition to fascism. Rühle saw the Soviet Union as a form of state capitalism that had much in common with the state-centred capitalism of the West as well as fascism, saying: > It has served as the model for other capitalistic dictatorships. Ideological > divergences do not really differentiate socioeconomic systems. While Rühle saw the Leninist vanguardist party as an appropriate form for the overthrow of tsarism, it was ultimately an inappropriate form for a proletarian revolution. As such, no matter what the actual intentions of the Bolsheviks, what they actually succeeded in bringing about was much more like the bourgeois revolutions of Europe than a proletarian revolution, arguing: > This distinction between head and body, between intellectuals and workers, > officers and privates, corresponds to the duality of class society. One > class is educated to rule; the other to be ruled. Lenin's organisation is > only a replica of bourgeois society. His revolution is objectively > determined by the forces that create a social order incorporating these > class relations, regardless of the subjective goals accompanying this > process. Rühle was also critical of the party as a revolutionary organisational form, stating that \\"the revolution is not a party affair\\". As a result, he supported a more council communist approach which emphasised the importance of workers' councils. In October 1921, he was involved in setting up the Allgemeine Arbeiter-Union – Einheitsorganisation. In Anti-Bolshevik Communism, Paul Mattick describes Rühle as an exemplary radical figure within a German labour movement that had become ossified into various official structures, a perpetual outsider defined by his antagonistic relationship with the labour movement and to Marxism–Leninism as well as to bourgeois democracy and fascism.Mattick, Paul (1978). Anti-Bolshevik Communism. London: Merlin Press. See the PDF version. With the signing of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact in 1939, Rühle began to see the parallels between the two ideological dictators, writing: > Russia was the example for fascism. [...] Whether party 'communists' like it > or not, the fact remains that the state order and rule in Russia are > indistinguishable from those in Italy and Germany. Essentially, they are > alike. One may speak of a red, black, or brown 'soviet state', as well as of > red, black or brown fascism.Rühle, Otto (1939). \\"The Struggle Against > Fascism Begins with the Struggle Against Bolshevism\\". First appeared in the > American Councilist journal Living Marxism (4: 8). A longer text was > published in French as \\"Fascisme Brun, Fascisme Rouge\\" by Spartacus in 1975 > (Série B: 63). Because of his connection to Leon Trotsky, Rühle found it difficult to find work in Mexico and was forced to hand-paint notecards for hotels to financially survive.Roth, Gary (2015). Marxism in a Lost Century: A Biography of Paul Mattick. Leiden/Boston: Brill Nijhoff and Hotel Publishing. p. 195. See the PDF version. Rühle was a member of the Dewey Commission which cleared Trotsky of all charges made during the Moscow Trials. In 1928, Rühle wrote a very detailed Karl Marx: His Life and Works.Rühle, Otto (1928); trans. 1929). Karl Marx: His Life and Works. New York: Viking Press.  Personal life  In 1921, Rühle married Alice Gerstel, a German-Jewish writer, feminist and psychologist. In 1936, Gerstel followed him to Mexico in 1936 and committed suicide on the day of his death on 24 June 1943.

The rebellion arose out of concern over Queen Mary I's determination to marry Philip of Spain, which was an unpopular policy with the English. Queen Mary's overthrow was implied in the rebellion, although not expressly stated as a goal. Reasons The precise reason for the uprisings has been much debated. Many historians, such as D.M. Loades, consider the rebellion to have been primarily motivated by political considerations, not easily separated from religious ones in the 16th century, and notably the desire to prevent the unpopular marriage of Queen Mary I to Prince Philip of Spain. On 16 November 1553 a Parliamentary delegation had waited upon the Queen and formally requested that she choose an English husband, the obvious though tacit candidate being her kinsman Edward Courtenay, recently created Earl of Devon. The rebels explained that the reason for the rebellion was \\"to prevent us from over-running by strangers.\\" Nevertheless, all the rebel leaders were committed Protestants. An informer named William Thomas claimed that the conspirators in fact intended to assassinate the Queen and named John Fitzwilliam as the assassin. However, the Crown at Wyatt's trial acquitted him of any intention to actually harm the Queen. Though many modern day historians have given less weight to religion as a motive for the rebellion, it is important to note the high anti-Catholic sentiment that existed in England at the time. After Queen Mary I’s rise to the throne there was much debate over the possibility that England would revert to Catholicism. While some would have welcomed a return to the papacy, many Protestants were deeply opposed. As more and more Catholics were appointed to the Privy Council and other important posts, these fears began to grow larger. It is impossible to fully separate the religious and political reasons for the uprising. Beyond the beliefs of the leaders, the rebellion acted as way for the lower classes to voice their frustrations. Specifically yeomen, husbandmen, and urban workers were able to express social and economic frustrations through the rebellion. Though the unrest was not universal, it was symptomatic of a wide range of discontent among the English populace. Initial plans There were four chief rebel leaders: *Sir Thomas Wyatt, who owned large areas of land in Kent and had great influence there *Sir James Croft, who came from an influential Herefordshire family *Sir Peter Carew, who was an MP for Devon *Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk, who was based in Leicestershire. Other rebels included Edward Courtenay, Earl of Devon, Sir Henry Isley, Lord John Grey of Wilton, Lord Thomas Grey (Henry Grey's brother), Sir William Thomas (Clerk of the Privy Council), Sir Nicholas Throckmorton, John Harington, 1st Baron Harington of Exton, Sir Nicholas Arnold and Sir William St Loe. Others involved included the French ambassador, Antoine de Noailles, who knew that a Spanish king on the throne of England was not in the best interests of France, and the mathematician Leonard Digges. Each of the four leaders would raise rebellions in one of the four counties, and together they would converge on London, on 18 March 1554. They would then replace Mary with her half-sister Elizabeth, who would then marry Lord Devon. Meanwhile, a fleet of French ships would prevent Philip of Spain from reaching England. Implementation of these plans was prevented when Simon Renard, the Holy Roman Empire's ambassador to England, suspected a plot. He informed the Lord Chancellor, Bishop Stephen Gardiner, who on 21 January arrested Devon, who revealed that there was indeed a rebellion planned. Under increased pressure of time, the planned rebellion was moved forward and went awry. The following day Sir James Croft delivered a message to Elizabeth at Ashridge House in Hertfordshire, but realising that under the circumstances a rebellion would be unsafe, Croft gave up. Suffolk proved more determined, but only managed to raise a force of 140 rebels, many of whom were his own men. He was refused entry to Coventry, and gave himself up. He was later tried and beheaded, as were his daughter Lady Jane Grey, and her husband Lord Guilford Dudley, both still in prison since the failed attempt to put Lady Jane on the throne and neither of whom were involved in the uprising. View of Allington Castle, Kent, before the modern rebuilding. News that Sir Peter Carew was spreading dissent at Exeter in Devon, by saying publicly that a Spanish king would bring the Spanish Inquisition, reached the Court in January 1554. Carew attempted to raise support for the uprising in Devon, but the Protestant nobles there proved unwilling to commit treason, and the county's peasant inhabitants were largely Catholic. Also, he had played a large part in crushing the earlier Prayer Book Rebellion there. A warrant was issued for Carew's arrest, but, forewarned, he escaped across the Channel to Normandy, but was arrested soon after. By this time, the French ships found themselves unable to maintain their position and returned to France. Only Wyatt succeeded in raising a substantial force. On 22 January 1554 he summoned a meeting of his friends at his castle of Allington, and 25 January was now fixed for the rising. Rebellion On 26 January Wyatt occupied Rochester, and issued a proclamation to the county. Many country people and local gentry collected. At first the queen's supporters, led by Lord Abergavenny and Sir Robert Southwell, the sheriff, appeared to be able to suppress the rising with ease, routing a rebel force of 500 at Hartley Wood on 28 January. But the Spanish marriage was unpopular, and Kent was more affected by the preaching of the reformers than most of the country districts of England. Abergavenny and Southwell were deserted by their men, who either disbanded or went over to Wyatt. He now had 3,000 men at his command. A detachment of the London trainbands was sent against him under the command of the elderly Duke of Norfolk. But they also joined the rebels, raising their numbers to 4,000, while the Duke fled to London. Elizabeth, meanwhile, had been summoned to Court and was held incommunicado, in mortal fear. The rising now seemed so formidable that the Queen and Council sent a deputation to Wyatt to ask for his terms. He demanded that the Tower of London should be surrendered to him, and the Queen put under his charge. The insolence of these demands turned an initially sympathetic London against Wyatt, and Mary was able to rally the capital to her cause on 1 February by delivering a rousing speech at the Guildhall. Wyatt's army reached Southwark on 3 February. Mary's supporters occupied London Bridge in force, and the rebels were unable to penetrate into the city. Wyatt was driven from Southwark by the threats of Sir John Brydges, afterwards Lord Chandos, who was prepared to fire on the suburb with the guns of the Tower. Refusing to give up, the rebels marched to Kingston. The bridge there was also destroyed, but the rebels repaired it and crossed over. They met little resistance as they marched through the outskirts of London, but were stopped by the inhabitants of Ludgate. The rebel army then broke up. Aftermath Wyatt surrendered, and was tried and executed along with approximately 90 rebels, many of whom were hanged, drawn and quartered. Wyatt himself, after being severely tortured in the hope of extracting a confession implicating Elizabeth, was beheaded at Tower Hill and his body quartered. Courtenay was exiled and would die in the city of Padua, Italy. Lord Thomas Grey and William Thomas were both executed. Throckmorton was found not guilty and released. Sir Nicholas Arnold was never brought to trial but he was pardoned. Of the other ringleaders, Sir Peter Carew was imprisoned but released; Sir James Croft was tried and found guilty, but would be pardoned; and William St Loe also evaded punishment. The rebellion had an unintended consequence of leading to the eventual execution of Lady Jane Grey. Though she had already been convicted, her execution had been suspended until her family's involvement with the rebellion. With her father and brother choosing to join the rebels, Lady Jane Grey's fate was all but concluded. Elizabeth was intensely interrogated and in danger of execution, but managed to be spared due to evasive and intelligent responses, in which she maintained she had been unaware of the planned uprising. Nothing could be proved, but the degree to which she was privy to the preparations has been questioned by modern scholars. Elizabeth remained imprisoned as a precautionary measure. The rebellion proved disastrous for the Wyatt family, as they lost their title and lands, including the family home, Allington Castle. However, when Elizabeth, herself a Protestant and distant relative of the Wyatt family, ascended the throne in 1558, she restored the family titles and lands. References * Froude, J. A. (1889).

The efficient- market hypothesis assumes that whenever mispricing of a publicly traded stock occurs, an opportunity for low-risk profit is created for rational traders. The low-risk profit opportunity exists through the tool of arbitrage, which, briefly, is buying and selling differently priced items of the same value, and pocketing the difference. If a stock falls away from its equilibrium price (let us say it becomes undervalued) due to irrational trading (noise traders), rational investors will (in this case) take a long position while going short a proxy security, or another stock with similar characteristics. Rational traders usually work for professional money management firms, and invest other peoples' money. If they engage in arbitrage in reaction to a stock mispricing, and the mispricing persists for an extended period, clients of the money management firm can (and do) formulate the opinion that the firm is incompetent. This results in withdrawal of the clients' funds. In order to deliver funds, the manager must unwind the position at a loss. The threat of this action on behalf of clients causes professional managers to be less vigilant to take advantage of these opportunities. This has the tendency to exacerbate the problem of pricing inefficiency. In perhaps the best known example, the American firm Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) fell victim to limits-to-arbitrage, in 1998. The company had staked its investments on the convergence of the prices of certain bonds. These bond prices were guaranteed to converge in the long run. However, in the short run, due to the East Asian financial crisis and the Russian government's debt default, panicked investors traded against LTCM's position, and so the prices that had been expected to converge were, instead, driven further apart. This caused LTCM to face margin calls. Because the firm did not have enough money to cover these calls, they were compelled to close out their positions and to take great losses; whereas, if they had held their positions, they then could have made significant profits.

As of February 2015, approximately 86,062,000 American households (73.9% of households with television) receive Investigation Discovery.  History  The channel launched in 1996 under the name Discovery Civilization Network: The World History and Geography Channel. It was one of four digital cable companion networks rolled out by Discovery Communications simultaneously in October 1996. Plans for the channel had surfaced in November 1994, when its working name was \\"Time Traveler\\". In April 2002, New York Times Television and Discovery Communications announced a joint venture to run the Discovery Civilization Channel. By then, it was available in 14 million households. The partnership aimed to complement the historical shows, with programming about current events and contemporary history. On March 25, 2003, the channel was rebranded as Discovery Times, focusing more on the culture of the United States, as well as other miscellaneous programming. The previous name was described as \\"a little off-message\\" by executives. In April 2006, The New York Times sold its stake in Discovery Times back to Discovery Communications, ending its ownership in the channel. On January 27, 2008, Discovery Times was relaunched as Investigation Discovery (ID), oriented towards true crime programs. In 2016, owing to a resurgence in popularity within the true crime genre, ID was the second-highest-rated cable network among women 25-54. In 2018, ID was the sixth-highest-rated basic cable network in full-day viewership. Programming Most of ID's programs are original productions, but it also airs re-titled off-network reruns, including ABC's 20/20, CBS' 48 Hours, and NBC’s Dateline. ID's longest-running series is On the Case with Paula Zahn which debuted in 2009. Other long-running shows on the network include Disappeared and Homicide Hunter: Lt. Joe Kenda. On June 7, 2015, ID aired its first ever scripted mini-series; Serial Thriller: Angel of Decay chronicled the investigation of convicted (and later executed) serial killer Ted Bundy. A second installment, Serial Thriller: The Chameleon, premiered as a two-part miniseries in December 2015, chronicling the crimes that resulted in the execution of American serial killer Stephen Morin. A third installment, Serial Thriller: The Headhunter, about serial killer Edmund Kemper (which possibly includes the story of serial killer Herbert Mullin), premiered on February 20, 2016.

It was also the name of one of the two main performance venues within the complex. The other venue was Kool Haus (formerly The Warehouse). Other smaller rooms within the complex included: The Drink (renovated to become Cathouse then Surface), D'Luxe Lounge (renovated to become Haven), The Orange Room (renovated to become Chroma), SkyBar, Charlies (renovated to become Gallery), Tanja and Acid Lounge. The Guvernment opened in 1996 and closed in early 2015. Prior to closure, the property was sold to The Daniels Corporation real estate development company and is since March 2015 in the process of being turned into C$700 million condominium development called City of the Arts. HistoryFresh= The site of the Guvernment was first converted into a nightclub in 1984 as Fresh Restaurant and Nightclub by Tony and Albert Assoon, two of the four Assoon brothers who ran the successful and influential Twilight Zone after-hours club at 185 Richmond Street West.BlogTO History of Guvernment However, Fresh did not do well and was quickly sold by late 1985. =RPM= The space returned almost immediately as RPM under the ownership of Murray Ball, an artist who had formerly fronted the Toronto-based punk/new-wave band The Dishes before turning to hospitality entrepreneurship on the Toronto nightlife scene having successfully run The Copa in Yorkville on behalf of its owner — Tom Kristenbrun's Chrysalis Group. Joining Ball in the new RPM ownership group were Martin Arts, formerly The Copa's original general manager, and Neil Vosburgh. Within a few months, by March 1986, well known local DJs Terry \\"TK\\" Kelly and Chris Sheppard were brought over from The Copa to be RPM's residents. Initially, TK played Mondays (billed as 'Psychedelic Mondays'), Thursdays ('Disco Thursdays'), and Saturdays ('dance‐music Saturdays' blending house, funk, and new wave), while Sheppard was hired away from his popular alt-rock Sunday-night gig at The Copa to recreate the same energy at RPM. TK's Monday nights quickly began gaining in popularity, attracting patrons with an eclectic rock mix covering a wide range of old and new from The Four Horsemen, AC/DC, and Jimi Hendrix to The Doors and Nirvana. Bringing his Sunday-night club act over from The Copa, Sheppard decided to infuse it with more underground music and remove the age restriction; his all‐ages Sundays immediately became RPM's signature night with teenage crowds reaching capacity well before 9 p.m. each week and many lining up outside around the block at the foot of Jarvis Street. Sheppard occasionally booked live acts for appearances during his club Sundays such as the time during fall 1986 when he brought on the still-not-widely-known Beastie Boys whose debut album had just come out. From the very beginning, in addition to club nights, RPM served as a live music venue. Among others, its star DJ, Chris Sheppard, participated in booking acts for live gigs at the venue, bringing Ministry, Skinny Puppy, and Chris & Cosey throughout 1986. A synth-pop band in the middle of making a turn towards industrial music with the release of their second album, Ministry's show at RPM on 10 April 1986 became particularly notable due to its bootleg recording that would end up getting circulated for almost thirty years before the band eventually decided to release it as an official live album named Toronto 1986. Initially capped at 1,100, RPM's capacity steadily expanded over the years due to high demand. Featuring oversized art, blacklight, and bright psychedelic lighting throughout the venue, the group of individuals running RPM especially focused on the club's visual component, manipulating it regularly every year with different installations including dinosaurs, dolphins, an airplane with parachuting soldiers, flashing neon signs as well as a black convertible Cadillac suspended from the ceiling with wax figures of John F. Kennedy and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis sitting in it. The club's sound system was installed by the Canadian audio engineer Ted MacDonald. Located in a semi- industrial area on the eastern edge of Toronto's downtown, due to being somewhat off the beaten path, RPM's management arranged a free shuttle bus service from Union Station throughout the night. A few years into RPM's operation, Sheppard moved to Fridays for a 19+ age-restricted night that was simultaneously broadcast live-to-air on CFNY while his vacated Sunday spot got taken over by Terry Kelly and later Matt C. Initially playing dance music in the most general sense, Sheppard's club nights at RPM gradually began moving away from rock and coalescing around house music and the emerging rave culture with even some early bleep techno. In the early 1990s an adjacent venue opened as The Warehouse, a large club space used for concerts such as Björk, Suede, Radiohead, Pet Shop Boys, Bush, Catherine Wheel, David Bowie, and Foo Fighters.Discogs - The Warehouse, Toronto - Discography recorded at The Warehouse =The Guvernment= The declining RPM and The Warehouse venues were taken over in late 1995 by Charles Khabouth. Following extensive renovation, he renamed RPM as The Guvernment, reopening in September 1996. Initially kept, The Warehouse name got changed to Kool Haus by 2001. Khabouth revamped RPM by installing a series of smaller lounges and bars within the complex. A sound system was designed for the main room by audio engineer Steve Dash and remained throughout the club's existence despite various renovations.DJ Mag article Khabouth credited the system as one of the best in the city and would call Dash up from the United States to tune the room's mixer when required. Additionally, Khabouth also arranged for the installation of a wooden raised floor that had to be redone every year due to wear and tear by dancers at a cost of $30,000 to $40,000, citing it as a necessary component to achieve better sound. Saturdays at The Guvernment (promoted as 'Spin Saturdays') featured underground electronic dance music until 7AM with resident DJs Mark Oliver and the Manzone & Strong duo. Additionally, 'Spin Saturdays' (later known as 'Alive till 7') played host to many international DJs such as Above & Beyond, Armin Van Buuren, David Guetta, Ferry Corsten, Marco V, Markus Schulz, Deadmau5, Sasha, Paul Oakenfold, and Carl Cox. Deep Dish created a Global Underground compilation, Global Underground 025: Toronto, based on their performance at the Guvernment. In 2009, Markus Schulz released a compilation album, called Toronto '09, which reflected on his affection towards the city of Toronto and, in particular, the Guvernment complex.trance.nu - Markus Schulz - Toronto 2009 In December 2014, John Digweed released a live recording of his final set at The Guvernment from two months prior. Annually, The Guvernment / Kool Haus venues would host \\"full-complex\\" events where all seven rooms that made up the complex were accessible. These events were held on long weekends and special occasions and sometimes went as late at 10AM. Some of these events included 'Labour of Love', 'Decadence', 'Freedom', 'Thriller', and the nightclub's anniversary party. On these nights, various international electronic music artists performed in the different themed rooms hosting upwards of 10,000 guests. Steve Lawler's Canada Day sunrise sets on the roof top terrace SkyBar were considered legendary by many. The Guvernment consistently placed high in DJ Mag's Top 100 Clubs annual list. Its highest ranking, number 8 in the world, came in 2008.DJMag - top100clubs - Guvernment =Closure and demolition= In parallel with the Toronto-wide condo boom that had been on since early 2000s, the rumours and speculation about the imminent sale of The Guvernment's attractive Queen's Quay East lakefront location to property developers and subsequent closure of the nightlife complex have circulated for years. With the rampant trend of downtown Toronto buildings that house nightclubs being sold and then demolished to make way for condominiums, the Toronto Star reported during April 2013 about The Guvernment's fate already being sealed in the same manner. The official confirmation occurred over a year later when, on 1 May 2014, The Guvernment's parent company, INK Entertainment, announced plans of closing the entertainment complex effective 31 January 2015. The decision was prompted by the sale of the city-owned property, that INK had been renting since 1996, to The Daniels Corp, a property development company, which outbid INK and also bought out the rest of the block in preparation for what was expected to be a massive condo development. According to the club's owner Charles Khabouth, the venue had already been slated to close a year earlier, but did not due to his company putting up a legal fight: \\"We fought tooth and nail, spending a lot of money on legal fees, and ending up not being able to stretch it much more than a year...I knew about it and delayed it as much as I could\\". He further promised a series of farewell events leading up to the closure. On Sunday, 25 January 2015, The Guvernment hosted its final event with deadmau5 as the headliner. Resident DJ Mark Oliver along with Khabouth played the final track, Patrick Cowley's mix of \\"I Feel Love\\" by Donna Summer. Following a month-long dismantling that commenced immediately after the final night, the complex began demolition in late February 2015. Khabouth has indicated his intention to build a bigger venue of approximately 100,000 square feet to replace the Guvernment while admitting that it would probably have to be outside of downtown Toronto due to difficulty of finding a suitable property of that size in the heart of the city. In late March 2015, at a presentation attended by Toronto mayor John Tory, The Daniels Corporation announced plans of building a C$700 million development named City of the Arts that is to include two mid- rise commercial towers, two sky-high residential ones and post-secondary academic space.

Such systems can be understood as means of trading wealth indirectly; not directly as with barter. Money is a mechanism that facilitates this process. Money may take a physical form as in coins and notes, or may exist as a written or electronic account. It may have intrinsic value (commodity money), be legally exchangeable for something with intrinsic value (representative money), or only have nominal value (fiat money). Overview The invention of money took place before the beginning of written history.Denise Schmandt-Besserat, Tokens: their Significance for the Origin of Counting and WritingKeynes, J.M. (1930). A Treatise on Money. Volume I, p. 13 Consequently, any story of how money first developed is largely based on conjecture and logical inference. The significant evidence establishes many things were bartered in ancient markets that could be described as a medium of exchange. These included livestock and grain – things directly useful in themselves – but also merely attractive items such as cowrie shells or beads were exchanged for more useful commodities. However, such exchanges would be better described as barter, and the common bartering of a particular commodity (especially when the commodity items are not fungible) does not technically make that commodity \\"money\\" or a \\"commodity money\\" like the shekel – which was both a coin representing a specific weight of barley, and the weight of that sack of barley.Kramer, History Begins at Sumer, pp. 52–55. Due to the complexities of ancient history (ancient civilizations developing at different paces and not keeping accurate records or having their records destroyed), and because the ancient origins of economic systems precede written history, it is impossible to trace the true origin of the invention of money and the transition from \\"barter systems\\" to the \\"monetary systems\\". Further, evidence in the histories supports the idea that money has taken two main forms divided into the broad categories of money of account (debits and credits on ledgers) and money of exchange (tangible media of exchange made from clay, leather, paper, bamboo, metal, etc.). As \\"money of account\\" depends on the ability to record a count, the tally stick was a significant development. The oldest of these dates from the Aurignacian, about 666 years ago.*Graham Flegg, Numbers: their history and meaning, Courier Dover Publications, 2002 , pp. 41–42. The 20,000-year-old Ishango Bone – found near one of the sources of the Nile in the Democratic Republic of Congo – seems to use matched tally marks on the thigh bone of a baboon for correspondence counting. Accounting records – in the monetary system sense of the term accounting – dating back more than 7,000 years have been found in Mesopotamia,Friedlob, G. Thomas & Plewa, Franklin James, Understanding balance sheets, John Wiley & Sons, NYC, 1996, , p. 1 and documents from ancient Mesopotamia show lists of expenditures, and goods received and traded and the history of accounting evidences that money of account pre-dates the use of coinage by several thousand years. David Graeber proposes that money as a unit of account was invented when the unquantifiable obligation \\"I owe you one\\" transformed into the quantifiable notion of \\"I owe you one unit of something\\". In this view, money emerged first as money of account and only later took the form of money of exchange. Regarding money of exchange, the use of representative money historically pre-dates the invention of coinage as well. In the ancient empires of Egypt, Babylon, India and China, the temples and palaces often had commodity warehouses which made use of clay tokens and other materials which served as evidence of a claim upon a portion of the goods stored in the warehouses.Robert A. Mundell, The Birth of Coinage, Discussion Paper #:0102-08, Department of Economics, Columbia University, February 2002. Because these tokens could be redeemed at the warehouse for the commodity they represented, they were able to be traded in the markets as if they were the commodity or given to workers as payment. While not the oldest form of money of exchange, various metals (both common and precious metals) were also used in both barter systems and monetary systems and the historical use of metals provides some of the clearest illustration of how the barter systems gave birth to monetary systems. The Romans' use of bronze, while not among the more ancient examples is well documented, and it illustrates this transition clearly. First, the \\"aes rude\\" (rough bronze) was used. This was a heavy weight of unmeasured bronze used in what was probably a barter system—the barter-ability of the bronze was related exclusively to its usefulness in blacksmithing and it was bartered with the intent of being turned into tools. The next historical step was bronze in bars that had a 5-pound pre-measured weight (presumably to make barter easier and more fair), called \\"aes signatum\\" (signed bronze), which is where debate arises between if this is still the barter system or now a monetary system. Finally, there is a clear break from the use of bronze in barter into its undebatable use as money because of lighter measures of bronze not intended to be used as anything other than coinage for transactions. The aes grave (heavy bronze) (or As) is the start of the use of coins in Rome, but not the oldest known example of metal coinage. Theories of money The earliest ideas included Aristotle's \\"metallist\\" and Plato's \\"chartalist\\" concepts, which Joseph Schumpeter integrated into his own theory of money as forms of classification. Specifically, the Austrian economist attempted to develop a catallactic theory of money out of Claim Theory. Schumpeter's theory had several themes but the most important of these involve the notions that money can be analyzed from the viewpoint of social accounting and that it is also firmly connected to the theory of value and price. There are at least two theories of what money is, and these can influence the interpretation of historical and archeological evidence of early monetary systems. The commodity theory of money (money of exchange) is preferred by those who wish to view money as a natural outgrowth of market activity.Tymoigne, Éric & Wray, L. Randall (2005), Money: An Alternative Story, p. 2 Others view the credit theory of money (money of account) as more plausible and may posit a key role for the state in establishing money. The Commodity theory is more widely held and much of this article is written from that point of view.Wray, L. Randall (2012), Introduction to an Alternative History of Money, p. 3 Overall, the different theories of money developed by economists largely focus on functions, use, and management of money. Other theorists also note that the status of a particular form of money always depends on the status ascribed to it by humans and by society. For instance, gold may be seen as valuable in one society but not in another or that a bank note is merely a piece of paper until it is agreed that it has monetary value. Prehistory: predecessors of money and its emergenceNon-monetary exchange=Barter There is no evidence, historical or contemporary, of a society in which barter is the main mode of exchange;Humphrey, Caroline. 1985. \\"Barter and Economic Disintegration\\". Man, New Series 20 (1): 48–72. instead, non-monetary societies operated largely along the principles of gift economy and debt.Mauss, Marcel. The Gift: The Form and Reason for Exchange in Archaic Societies. pp. 36–37.David Graeber: Debt: The First 5000 Years, Melville 2011. Cf. review When barter did in fact occur, it was usually between either complete strangers or potential enemies. With barter, an individual possessing any surplus of value, such as a measure of grain or a quantity of livestock, could directly exchange it for something perceived to have similar or greater value or utility, such as a clay pot or a tool, however, the capacity to carry out barter transactions is limited in that it depends on a coincidence of wants. For example, a farmer has to find someone who not only wants the grain he produced but who could also offer something in return that the farmer wants. =Hypothesis of barter as the origin of money= In Politics Book 1:9S Meikle \\"Aristotle on Money\\" Phronesis Vol. 39, No. 1 (1994), pp. 26–44 Retrieved 2012-06-05 () the Greek philosopher Aristotle contemplated the nature of money. He considered that every object has two uses: the original purpose for which the object was designed, and as an item to sell or barter.Aristotle Politics Translated by Benjamin Jowett MIT University The assignment of monetary value to an otherwise insignificant object such as a coin or promissory note arises as people acquired a psychological capacity to place trust in each other and in external authority within barter exchange. Finding people to barter with is a time-consuming process; Austrian economist Carl Menger hypothesised that this reason was a driving force in the creation of monetary systems – people seeking a way to stop wasting their time looking for someone to barter with. In his book Debt: The First 5,000 Years, anthropologist David Graeber argues against the suggestion that money was invented to replace barter. The problem with this version of history, he suggests, is the lack of any supporting evidence. His research indicates that gift economies were common, at least at the beginnings of the first agrarian societies, when humans used elaborate credit systems. Graeber proposes that money as a unit of account was invented the moment when the unquantifiable obligation \\"I owe you one\\" transformed into the quantifiable notion of \\"I owe you one unit of something\\". In this view, money emerged first as credit and only later acquired the functions of a medium of exchange and a store of value. Graeber's criticism partly relies on and follows that made by A. Mitchell Innes in his 1913 article \\"What is money?\\". Innes refutes the barter theory of money, by examining historic evidence and showing that early coins never were of consistent value nor of more or less consistent metal content. Therefore, he concludes that sales is not exchange of goods for some universal commodity, but an exchange for credit. He argues that \\"credit and credit alone is money\\".Innes, A. Mitchell 1913. \\"What is Money?\\". The Banking Law Journal (May): 377–408. Reprinted in L. Randall Wray (Ed.) 2004 \\"Credit and State Theories of Money\\" Anthropologist Caroline Humphrey examines the available ethnographic data and concludes that \\"No example of a barter economy, pure and simple, has ever been described, let alone the emergence from it of money; all available ethnography suggests that there never has been such a thing\\". Economists Robert P. Murphy and George Selgin replied to Graeber saying that the barter hypothesis is consistent with economic principles, and a barter system would be too brief to leave a permanent record. John Alexander Smith from Bella Caledonia said that in this exchange Graeber is the one acting as a scientist by trying to falsify the barter hypotheses, while Selgin is taking a theological stance by taking the hypothesis as truth revealed from authority. Gift economy In a gift economy, valuable goods and services are regularly given without any explicit agreement for immediate or future rewards (i.e. there is no formal quid pro quo). Ideally, simultaneous or recurring giving serves to circulate and redistribute valuables within the community. There are various social theories concerning gift economies. Some consider the gifts to be a form of reciprocal altruism, where relationships are created through this type of exchange. Another interpretation is that implicit \\"I owe you\\" debt and social status are awarded in return for the \\"gifts\\".Gifford Pinchot – The Gift Economy . Context.org (2000-06-29). Retrieved on 2011-02-10. Consider for example, the sharing of food in some hunter-gatherer societies, where food-sharing is a safeguard against the failure of any individual's daily foraging. This custom may reflect altruism, it may be a form of informal insurance, or may bring with it social status or other benefits. =Emergence of money= Anthropologists have noted many cases of 'primitive' societies using what looks to us very like money but for non-commercial purposes, indeed commercial use may have been prohibited: This suggests that the basic idea of money may have long preceded its application to commercial trade. After the domestication of cattle and the start of cultivation of crops in 9000–6000 BC, livestock and plant products were used as money. However, it is in the nature of agricultural production that things take time to reach fruition. The farmer may need to buy things that he cannot pay for immediately. Thus the idea of debt and credit was introduced, and a need to record and track it arose. Ancient artifacts such as the Ishango Bone hint at a very early origin for accounting of some kind. The simplest system of money of account, Mutual credit, is not well attested in the archeological record however. The establishment of the first cities in Mesopotamia (c. 3000 BCE) provided the infrastructure for the next simplest form of money of account--asset-backed credit or Representative money. Farmers would deposit their grain in the temple which recorded the deposit on clay tablets and gave the farmer a receipt in the form of a clay token which they could then use to pay fees or other debts to the temple.Denise Schmandt-Besserat, Tokens: their Significance for the Origin of Counting and Writing Since the bulk of the deposits in the temple were of the main staple, barley, a fixed quantity of barley came to be used as a unit of account.Tymoigne, Éric & Wray, L. Randall (2005), Money: An Alternative Story Aristotle's opinion of the creation of money of exchange as a new thing in society is: Trading with foreigners required a form of money which was not tied to the local temple or economy, money that carried its value with it. A third, proxy, commodity that would mediate exchanges which could not be settled with direct barter was the solution. Which commodity would be used was a matter of agreement between the two parties, but as trade links expanded and the number of parties involved increased the number of acceptible proxies would have decreased. Ultimately, one or two commodities were converged on in each trading zone, the most common being gold and silver. This process was independent of the local monetary system so in some cases societies may have used money of exchange before developing a local money of account. In societies where foreign trade was rare money of exchange may have appeared much later than money of account. In early Mesopotamia copper was used in trade for a while but was soon superseded by silver. The temple (which financed and controlled most foreign trade) fixed exchange rates between barley and silver, and other important commodities, which enabled payment using any of them. It also enabled the extensive use of accounting in managing the whole economy, which led to the development of writing and thus the beginning of history.Michael Hudson, Cornelia Wunsch (Eds.) 2004, Creating Economic Order: Record-keeping, Standardization, and the Development of Accounting in the Ancient Near East Bronze Age: commodity money, credit and debt Many cultures around the world developed the use of commodity money, that is, objects that have value in themselves as well as value in their use as money. Ancient China, Africa, and India used cowry shells. The Mesopotamian civilization developed a large-scale economy based on commodity money. The shekel was the unit of weight and currency, first recorded c. 3000 BC, which was nominally equivalent to a specific weight of barley that was the preexisting and parallel form of currency.Cripps, Eric L., \\"The Structure of Prices in the Neo-Sumerian Economy (I): Barley:Silver Price Ratios\\", 2007 The Babylonians and their neighboring city states later developed the earliest system of economics as we think of it today, in terms of rules on debt, legal contracts and law codes relating to business practices and private property. Money was not only an emergence, it was a necessity.Sheila C. Dow (2005), \\"Axioms and Babylonian thought: a reply\\", Journal of Post Keynesian Economics 27 (3), pp. 385–391.The Reforms of Urukagina . History-world.org. Retrieved on 2011-02-10. The Code of Hammurabi, the best-preserved ancient law code, was created c. 1760 BC (middle chronology) in ancient Babylon. It was enacted by the sixth Babylonian king, Hammurabi. Earlier collections of laws include the code of Ur-Nammu, king of Ur (c. 2050 BC), the Code of Eshnunna (c. 1930 BC) and the code of Lipit-Ishtar of Isin (c. 1870 BC). These law codes formalized the role of money in civil society. They set amounts of interest on debt, fines for \\"wrongdoing\\", and compensation in money for various infractions of formalized law. It has long been assumed that metals, where available, were favored for use as proto-money over such commodities as cattle, cowry shells, or salt, because metals are at once durable, portable, and easily divisible.I I Rubin, A History of Economic Thought, translated Donald Filtzer, Ink Links, 1979 (original Moscow, 1929) The use of gold as proto-money has been traced back to the fourth millennium BC when the Egyptians used gold bars of a set weight as a medium of exchange, as had been done earlier in Mesopotamia with silver bars.

Cf. http://www.socialtextjournal.org/reviews/2011/10/review-of-david-graebers- debt.php While these Aegean coins were stamped (heated and hammered with insignia), the Indian coins (from the Ganges river valley) were punched metal disks, and Chinese coins (first developed in the Great Plain) were cast bronze with holes in the center to be strung together. The different forms and metallurgical processes imply a separate development. All modern coins, in turn, are descended from the coins that appear to have been invented in the kingdom of Lydia in Asia Minor somewhere around 7th century BC and that spread throughout Greece in the following centuries: disk-shaped, made of gold, silver, bronze or imitations thereof, with both sides bearing an image produced by stamping; one side is often a human head. Maybe the first ruler in the Mediterranean known to have officially set standards of weight and money was Pheidon.Full text of \\"The earliest coins of Greece proper\\". archive.org.

Amisano, in a general publication, including the Etruscan coinage, attributing it the beginning to about 550 BC in Populonia, a chronology that would leave out the contribution of the Greeks of Magna Graecia and attribute to the Etruscans the burden of introducing the coin in Italy. In this work, constant reference is made to classical sources, and credit is given to the origin of the Etruscan Lydia, a source supported by Herodotus, and also to the invention of coin in Lydia.Giuseppe Amisano, \\"Cronologia e politica monetaria alla luce dei segni di valore delle monete etrusche e romane\\", in: Panorama numismatico, 49 (genn. 1992), pp. 15-20 Other coins made of electrum (a naturally occurring alloy of silver and gold) were manufactured on a larger scale about 7th century BC in Lydia (on the coast of what is now Turkey).Goldsborough, Reid. \\"World's First Coin\\" Similar coinage was adopted and manufactured to their own standards in nearby cities of Ionia, including Mytilene and Phokaia (using coins of electrum) and Aegina (using silver) during the 7th century BC, and soon became adopted in mainland Greece, and the Persian Empire (after it incorporated Lydia in 547 BC). The use and export of silver coinage, along with soldiers paid in coins, contributed to the Athenian Empire's dominance of the region in the 5th century BC. The silver used was mined in southern Attica at Laurium and Thorikos by a huge workforce of slave labour. A major silver vein discovery at Laurium in 483 BC led to the huge expansion of the Athenian military fleet.

Assaying Assaying is analysis of the chemical composition of metals. The discovery of the touchstone for assaying helped the popularisation of metal-based commodity money and coinage. Any soft metal, such as gold, can be tested for purity on a touchstone. As a result, the use of gold for as commodity money spread from Asia Minor, where it first gained wide usage. A touchstone allows the amount of gold in a sample of an alloy to been estimated. In turn this allows the alloy's purity to be estimated. This allows coins with a uniform amount of gold to be created. Coins were typically minted by governments and then stamped with an emblem that guaranteed the weight and value of the metal. However, as well as intrinsic value coins had a face value. Sometimes governments would reduce the amount of precious metal in a coin (reducing the intrinsic value) and assert the same face value, this practice is known as debasement. General notes Gold and silver have been the most common forms of money throughout history. In many languages, such as Spanish, French, Hebrew and Italian, the word for silver is still directly related to the word for money. Sometimes other metals were used. For instance, Ancient Sparta minted coins from iron to discourage its citizens from engaging in foreign trade. In the early 17th century Sweden lacked precious metals, and so produced \\"plate money\\": large slabs of copper 50 cm or more in length and width, stamped with indications of their value. Gold coins began to be minted again in Europe in the 13th century. Frederick II is credited with having reintroduced gold coins during the Crusades. During the 14th century Europe changed from use of silver in currency to minting of gold. Vienna made this change in 1328. Metal-based coins had the advantage of carrying their value within the coins themselves – on the other hand, they induced manipulations, such as the clipping of coins to remove some of the precious metal. A greater problem was the simultaneous co-existence of gold, silver and copper coins in Europe. The exchange rates between the metals varied with supply and demand. For instance the gold guinea coin began to rise against the silver crown in England in the 1670s and 1680s. Consequently, silver was exported from England in exchange for gold imports. The effect was worsened with Asian traders not sharing the European appreciation of gold altogether — gold left Asia and silver left Europe in quantities European observers like Isaac Newton, Master of the Royal Mint observed with unease. Stability came when national banks guaranteed to change silver money into gold at a fixed rate; it did, however, not come easily. The Bank of England risked a national financial catastrophe in the 1730s when customers demanded their money be changed into gold in a moment of crisis. Eventually London's merchants saved the bank and the nation with financial guarantees. Another step in the evolution of money was the change from a coin being a unit of weight to being a unit of value. A distinction could be made between its commodity value and its specie value. The difference in these values is seigniorage. =Roman banking system=400–1450Medieval coins and moneys of accountBanknotes= Earliest banknote from China during the Song Dynasty which is known as \\"Jiaozi\\" Paper money was introduced in Song dynasty China during the 11th century. The development of the banknote began in the seventh century, with local issues of paper currency. Its roots were in merchant receipts of deposit during the Tang dynasty (618–907), as merchants and wholesalers desired to avoid the heavy bulk of copper coinage in large commercial transactions.Ebrey, Walthall, and Palais (2006), 156.Bowman (2000), 105.Gernet (1962), 80. The issue of credit notes is often for a limited duration, and at some discount to the promised amount later. The jiaozi nevertheless did not replace coins during the Song Dynasty; paper money was used alongside the coins. The central government soon observed the economic advantages of printing paper money, issuing a monopoly right of several of the deposit shops to the issuance of these certificates of deposit.Ebrey et al., 156. By the early 12th century, the amount of banknotes issued in a single year amounted to an annual rate of 26 million strings of cash coins.Gernet, 80. The taka was widely used across South Asia during the sultanate period Silver coin of the Maurya Empire, known as rūpyarūpa, with symbols of wheel and elephant. 3rd century BC. The French East India Company issued rupees in the name of Muhammad Shah (1719–1748) for Northern India trade. This was cast in Pondicherry. In the Indian subcontinent, Sher Shah Suri (1540–1545), introduced a silver coin called a rupiya, weighing 178 grams. Its use was continued by the Mughal Empire. The history of the rupee traces back to Ancient India circa 3rd century BC. Ancient India was one of the earliest issuers of coins in the world, along with the Lydian staters, several other Middle Eastern coinages and the Chinese wen. The term is from rūpya, a Sanskrit term for silver coin, from Sanskrit rūpa, beautiful form. The imperial taka was officially introduced by the monetary reforms of Muhammad bin Tughluq, the emperor of the Delhi Sultanate, in 1329. It was modeled as representative money, a concept pioneered as paper money by the Mongols in China and Persia. The tanka was minted in copper and brass. Its value was exchanged with gold and silver reserves in the imperial treasury. The currency was introduced due to the shortage of metals. Both the Kabuli rupee and the Kandahari rupee were used as currency in Afghanistan prior to 1891, when they were standardized as the Afghan rupee. The Afghan rupee, which was subdivided into 60 paisas, was replaced by the Afghan afghani in 1925. Until the middle of the 20th century, Tibet's official currency was also known as the Tibetan rupee. In the 13th century, paper money became known in Europe through the accounts of travelers, such as Marco Polo and William of Rubruck. Marco Polo's account of paper money during the Yuan dynasty is the subject of a chapter of his book, The Travels of Marco Polo, titled \\"How the Great Kaan Causeth the Bark of Trees, Made into Something Like Paper, to Pass for Money All Over his Country.\\" In medieval Italy and Flanders, because of the insecurity and impracticality of transporting large sums of money over long distances, money traders started using promissory notes. In the beginning these were personally registered, but they soon became a written order to pay the amount to whomever had it in their possession.The Alchemists: Three Central Bankers and a World on Fire – Neil Irwin – Google Books These notes can be seen as a predecessor to regular banknotes.De Geschiedenis van het Geld (the History of Money), 1992, Teleac, page 96 =Trade bills of exchange= Bills of exchange became prevalent with the expansion of European trade toward the end of the Middle Ages. A flourishing Italian wholesale trade in cloth, woolen clothing, wine, tin and other commodities was heavily dependent on credit for its rapid expansion. Goods were supplied to a buyer against a bill of exchange, which constituted the buyer's promise to make payment at some specified future date. Provided that the buyer was reputable or the bill was endorsed by a credible guarantor, the seller could then present the bill to a merchant banker and redeem it in money at a discounted value before it actually became due. The main purpose of these bills nevertheless was, that traveling with cash was particularly dangerous at the time. A deposit could be made with a banker in one town, in turn a bill of exchange was handed out, that could be redeemed in another town. These bills could also be used as a form of payment by the seller to make additional purchases from his own suppliers. Thus, the bills – an early form of credit – became both a medium of exchange and a medium for storage of value. Like the loans made by the Egyptian grain banks, this trade credit became a significant source for the creation of new money. In England, bills of exchange became an important form of credit and money during last quarter of the 18th century and the first quarter of the 19th century before banknotes, checks and cash credit lines were widely available.Davies, Glyn, ‘’A History of Money’’, University of Wales, 1994, pp. 172, 339. =Islamic Golden Age= At around the same time in the medieval Islamic world, a vigorous monetary economy was created during the 7th–12th centuries on the basis of the expanding levels of circulation of a stable high-value currency (the dinar). Innovations introduced by Muslim economists, traders and merchants include the earliest uses of credit, cheques, promissory notes, savings accounts, transactional accounts, loaning, trusts, exchange rates, the transfer of credit and debt, and banking institutions for loans and deposits. =Indian subcontinent= In the Indian subcontinent, Sher Shah Suri (1540–1545), introduced a silver coin called a rupiya, weighing 178 grams. Its use was continued by the Mughal rulers. The history of the rupee traces back to Ancient India circa 3rd century BC. Ancient India was one of the earliest issuers of coins in the world, along with the Lydian staters, several other Middle Eastern coinages and the Chinese wen. The term is from rūpya, a Sanskrit term for silver coin, from Sanskrit rūpa, beautiful form. The imperial taka was officially introduced by the monetary reforms of Muhammad bin Tughluq, the emperor of the Delhi Sultanate, in 1329. It was modeled as representative money, a concept pioneered as paper money by the Mongols in China and Persia. The tanka was minted in copper and brass. Its value was exchanged with gold and silver reserves in the imperial treasury. The currency was introduced due to the shortage of metals. =Tallies= The acceptance of symbolic forms of money meant that a symbol could be used to represent something of value that was available in physical storage somewhere else in space, such as grain in the warehouse; or something of value that would be available later, such as a promissory note or bill of exchange, a document ordering someone to pay a certain sum of money to another on a specific date or when certain conditions have been fulfilled. In the 12th century, the English monarchy introduced an early version of the bill of exchange in the form of a notched piece of wood known as a tally stick. Tallies originally came into use at a time when paper was rare and costly, but their use persisted until the early 19th century, even after paper money had become prevalent. The notches denoted various amounts of taxes payable to the Crown. Initially tallies were simply a form of receipt to the taxpayer at the time of rendering his dues. As the revenue department became more efficient, they began issuing tallies to denote a promise of the tax assessee to make future tax payments at specified times during the year. Each tally consisted of a matching pair – one stick was given to the assessee at the time of assessment representing the amount of taxes to be paid later, and the other held by the Treasury representing the amount of taxes to be collected at a future date. The Treasury discovered that these tallies could also be used to create money. When the Crown had exhausted its current resources, it could use the tally receipts representing future tax payments due to the Crown as a form of payment to its own creditors, who in turn could either collect the tax revenue directly from those assessed or use the same tally to pay their own taxes to the government. The tallies could also be sold to other parties in exchange for gold or silver coin at a discount reflecting the length of time remaining until the tax was due for payment. Thus, the tallies became an accepted medium of exchange for some types of transactions and an accepted store of value. Like the girobanks before it, the Treasury soon realized that it could also issue tallies that were not backed by any specific assessment of taxes. By doing so, the Treasury created new money that was backed by public trust and confidence in the monarchy rather than by specific revenue receipts.Davies, Glyn, ‘’A History of Money’’, University of Wales(England), 1994, pp. 146–151 1450–1990Goldsmith bankers= Goldsmiths in England had been craftsmen, bullion merchants, money changers, and money lenders since the 16th century. But they were not the first to act as financial intermediaries; in the early 17th century, the scriveners were the first to keep deposits for the express purpose of relending them.Richards Merchants and traders had amassed huge hoards of gold and entrusted their wealth to the Royal Mint for storage. In 1640 King Charles I seized the private gold stored in the mint as a forced loan (which was to be paid back over time). Thereafter merchants preferred to store their gold with the goldsmiths of London, who possessed private vaults, and charged a fee for that service. In exchange for each deposit of precious metal, the goldsmiths issued receipts certifying the quantity and purity of the metal they held as a bailee (i.e., in trust). These receipts could not be assigned (only the original depositor could collect the stored goods). Gradually the goldsmiths took over the function of the scriveners of relending on behalf of a depositor and also developed modern banking practices; promissory notes were issued for money deposited which by custom and/or law was a loan to the goldsmith,Thus by the 19th century \\"[i]n ordinary cases of deposits of money with banking corporations, or bankers, the transaction amounts to a mere loan or mutuum, and the bank is to restore, not the same money, but an equivalent sum, whenever it is demanded\\". Joseph Story, Commentaries on the Law of Bailments (1832, p. 66) and \\"Money, when paid into a bank, ceases altogether to be the money of the principal (see Parker v. Marchant, 1 Phillips 360); it is then the money of the banker, who is bound to return an equivalent by paying a similar sum to that deposited with him when he is asked for it.\\" Lord Chancellor Cottenham, Foley v Hill (1848) 2 HLC 28. i.e., the depositor expressly allowed the goldsmith to use the money for any purpose including advances to his customers. The goldsmith charged no fee, or even paid interest on these deposits. Since the promissory notes were payable on demand, and the advances (loans) to the goldsmith's customers were repayable over a longer time period, this was an early form of fractional reserve banking. The promissory notes developed into an assignable instrument, which could circulate as a safe and convenient form of money backed by the goldsmith's promise to pay.Richards. The usual denomination was 50 or 100 pounds, so these notes were not an everyday currency for the common people. Hence goldsmiths could advance loans in the form of gold money, or in the form of promissory notes, or in the form of checking accounts.Richards, p. 40 Gold deposits were relatively stable, often remaining with the goldsmith for years on end, so there was little risk of default so long as public trust in the goldsmith's integrity and financial soundness was maintained. Thus, the goldsmiths of London became the forerunners of British banking and prominent creators of new money based on credit. =Demand deposits= Demand deposits are funds that are deposited in bank accounts and are available for withdrawal at the discretion of the depositor. The withdrawal of funds from the account does not require contacting or making any type of prior arrangements with the bank or credit union. As long as the account balance is sufficient to cover the amount of the withdrawal, and the withdrawal takes place in accordance with procedures set in place by the financial institution, the funds may be withdrawn on demand. =Banknotes= 100 USD banknote The first European banknotes were issued by Stockholms Banco, a predecessor of Sweden's central bank Sveriges Riksbank, in 1661. These replaced the copper-plates being used instead as a means of payment,Karl Gunnar Persson, An Economic History of Europe: Knowledge, Institutions and Growth, 600 to the Present Cambridge University Press, 28 January 2010, – Retrieved 2012-06-03 although in 1664 the bank ran out of coins to redeem notes and ceased operating in the same year. Inspired by the success of the London goldsmiths, some of whom became the forerunners of great English banks, banks began issuing paper notes quite properly termed \\"banknotes\\", which circulated in the same way that government- issued currency circulates today. In England this practice continued up to 1694. Scottish banks continued issuing notes until 1850, and still do issue banknotes backed by Bank of England notes. In the United States, this practice continued through the 19th century; at one time there were more than 5,000 different types of banknotes issued by various commercial banks in America. Only the notes issued by the largest, most creditworthy banks were widely accepted. The scrip of smaller, lesser-known institutions circulated locally. Farther from home it was only accepted at a discounted rate, if at all. The proliferation of types of money went hand in hand with a multiplication in the number of financial institutions. These banknotes were a form of representative money which could be converted into gold or silver by application at the bank. Since banks issued notes far in excess of the gold and silver they kept on deposit, sudden loss of public confidence in a bank could precipitate mass redemption of banknotes and result in bankruptcy. In India the earliest paper money was issued by Bank of Hindostan (1770– 1832), General Bank of Bengal and Bihar (1773–75), and Bengal Bank (1784–91). The use of banknotes issued by private commercial banks as legal tender has gradually been replaced by the issuance of bank notes authorized and controlled by national governments. The Bank of England was granted sole rights to issue banknotes in England after 1694. In the United States, the Federal Reserve Bank was granted similar rights after its establishment in 1913. Until recently, these government-authorized currencies were forms of representative money, since they were partially backed by gold or silver and were theoretically convertible into gold or silver. 1990–present The development of computer technology in the second part of the twentieth century allowed money to be represented digitally. By 1990, in the United States, all money transferred between its central bank and commercial banks was in electronic form. By the 2000s most money existed as digital currency in banks databases. In 2012, by number of transaction, 20 to 58 percent of transactions were electronic (dependent on country). The benefit of digital currency is that it allows for easier, faster, and more flexible payments. =Cryptocurrencies= In 2008, Bitcoin was proposed by an unknown author/s under the pseudonym of Satoshi Nakamoto. It was implemented the same year. Its use of cryptography allowed the currency to have a trustless, fungible and tamper resistant distributed ledger called a blockchain. It became the first widely used decentralized, peer-to-peer, cryptocurrency.. Other comparable systems had been proposed since the 1980s. The protocol proposed by Nakamoto solved what is known as the double-spending problem without the need of a trusted third-party. Since Bitcoin's inception, thousands of other cryptocurrencies have been introduced. Money supply In modern times economists have sought to classify the different types of money supply. The different measures of the money supply have been classified by various central banks, using the prefix \\"M\\". The supply classifications often depend on how narrowly a supply is specified, for example the \\"M\\"s may range from M0 (narrowest) to M3 (broadest). The classifications depend on the particular policy formulation used: * ': In some countries, such as the United Kingdom, M0 includes bank reserves, so M0 is referred to as the monetary base, or narrow money.M0 (monetary base). Moneyterms.co.uk. * MB: is referred to as the monetary base or total currency. This is the base from which other forms of money (like checking deposits, listed below) are created and is traditionally the most liquid measure of the money supply. * M1: Bank reserves are not included in M1. * M2: Represents M1 and \\"close substitutes\\" for M1. M2 is a broader classification of money than M1. M2 is a key economic indicator used to forecast inflation. * M3: M2 plus large and long-term deposits. Since 2006, M3 is no longer published by the U.S. central bank.\\"Discontinuance of M3\\", Federal Reserve, 10 November 2005, revised 9 March 2006. However, there are still estimates produced by various private institutions. * MZM: Money with zero maturity. It measures the supply of financial assets redeemable at par on demand. Velocity of MZM is historically a relatively accurate predictor of inflation.

The first castle on the site was an unauthorised fortification, built during The Anarchy of the early 12th century and torn down later in the century when royal control was reasserted. It was replaced by a manor house, which was fortified with royal permission in the 13th century. Various alterations and expansions were made by successive owners over the following two centuries. The property was developed into a fortified compound with six towers at irregular intervals along the curtain wall and domestic buildings in the interior, including one of the first long galleries built in England. In 1554 it was seized by the Crown in the course of dispossessing its owner, Sir Thomas Wyatt the Younger, after the failure of his rebellion against Queen Mary. The castle subsequently fell into a state of decay that was accelerated by damaging fires, neglect and vandalism, until it was largely ruined by the start of the 20th century. It was saved and restored by the efforts of Sir Martin Conway and his wife during the first half of the century. After nearly fifty years of occupation by a community of Carmelite friars and nuns, it returned to being a private residence in 1999 and is currently the home of Sir Robert Worcester, the founder of the MORI polling company. It is a grade I listed building and is used as a wedding venue, though there is no public access otherwise. History12th to 15th century= 1890s view of Allington Castle, illustrating its riverside location The first castle was built by William de Warenne, 2nd Earl of Surrey during the reign of King Stephen in the first half of the 12th century. It took the form of a moated mound (possibly a motte and bailey) built on a site adjoining a bend in the River Medway about north of Maidstone. The fortification was subsequently expanded but as it was an unauthorised adulterine castle, its demolition was ordered in 1174 during the reign of Henry II. It was replaced with a small unfortified manor house. The present castle was built between 1279–99 by Stephen de Pencester, the Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, who was granted a licence to crenellate the existing manor house by Edward I. It was inherited by Penchester's daughter and passed via marriage to the Cobham family, who owned it until 1492. The building's development was continued in the early 13th century by Sir Henry de Cobham, incorporating the remains of the old manor house into the new castle.Ingleton, p. 92 Although it was fortified, it was more of a residence than a fortress, as indicated by its extensive – and early – use of brick, which may have reflected Stephen's interests in a brickyard in Essex.Ingleton, p. 29 It seems to have been neglected subsequently; it is described by documentary sources as being in a very bad condition by 1398–99.Ingleton, p. 92 =Tenure of the Wyatts= Allington Castle was acquired in 1492 by Sir Henry Wyatt, a prominent supporter of Henry Tudor, who was later to become King Henry VII. He undertook major alterations, dividing the courtyard into two unequal parts by constructing a two-storeyed building which contained what may have been one of the first long galleries in England. He also added a half-timbered block adjoining the curtain wall, which was used as the castle's kitchens and stables. Henry VII visited it during Wyatt's tenure. Henry VIII also visited in 1527, 1530 and 1536, as did Cardinal Wolsey in 1527 and Catherine Parr in 1544. Henry was said to have been so concerned for his personal safety while staying in the castle's north-east tower that he had the single entry, a spiral staircase, blocked off by a dry stone wall each night that he was there. His son, the poet Thomas Wyatt, was born there in 1503, but in 1554 Thomas Wyatt the younger forfeited the castle after his unsuccessful rebellion against Queen Mary. The plotters had held their first meeting at the castle before marching to London; after the rebellion had been crushed, many of the failed rebels were imprisoned in the castle. Sir Thomas was executed, the Wyatts were deprived of the rest of their extensive estate, and the surviving members of the family emigrated to America.Ingleton, p. 93 =Fall into ruin= Buck brothers. The castle and manor were granted in 1568 to John Astley, Queen Elizabeth's Master of the Jewel House, though he did not live there. Around 1600, two farm houses were subsequently built in the grounds of Allington Castle while the rest of the castle gradually fell into ruin. Most of the Great Hall and the north-east wing were destroyed in a disastrous fire in the second half of the 16th century. An early 17th-century lessee named John Best pulled down the battlements and added a half-timbered gabled second storey to the east and west wings as a replacement for the fire-damaged areas of the castle. The Bests were Catholics and used a room in the east tower as their private chapel. There is still a priest hole in the lodge of the gatehouse, a sign of the persecution that Catholics faced at the time.Allington Castle, p. 8 Allington Castle was bought in 1720 by Sir Robert Marsham, the 2nd Baron Romney and a descendant of the Wyatts, but he did not live there and let it deteriorate. Its decaying appearance was recorded by JMW Turner in sketches and watercolours made in 1798. The top of the Long Gallery was destroyed in another fire in the early 19th century and the rest of the castle was nearly demolished a few decades later by Charles Marsham, 5th Earl of Romney. He was dissuaded by opposition from local residents, notably the Rector of the nearby Church of St. Lawrence, but by this time the castle was totally ruined. The Penchester wing was abandoned and used as a quarry for building materials, while the ground-floor remnants of the Long Gallery were converted into a pair of farmhouses. =Restoration= The ruins of the castle in 1905 In 1895, a retired London barrister named Dudley C. Falke rented the castle from Lord Romney and began the lengthy task of restoration. However, this proved too expensive for his resources. In 1905 he approached the distinguished mountaineer and cartographer Sir William Martin Conway (later Lord Conway), who he had heard was looking to buy an old castle or manor house. Conway had posted an advertisement in The Times stating: \\"Wanted to purchase, an old manor-house or abbey, built in the 16th century or earlier.\\" The castle made a great impression on Conway and his American wife Katrina when they saw it for the first time: Conway decided to purchase the castle's freehold from Lord Romney at a cost of £4,800 and spent the next 30 years restoring it with the assistance of the architects W. D. Caroe and Philip Tilden. He was able to draw on his own and his wife's wealth, and his efforts were also supported by his wife's wealthy stepfather, a businessman named Manton Marble. Corbens, a local building firm, was hired to carry out the work and provided traditional craftsmen to undertake the restoration in an architecturally and historically sympathetic style. Conway and his daughter Agnes, an archaeologist, also undertook extensive research into the history of the castle. Much of the restoration had been completed by the start of the First World War in 1914. The gatehouse and the Penchester wing had been completely restored and most of the old keep had been completed as well. The Long Gallery was rebuilt and the Tudor house within the castle walls was linked to it. An old dovecot on the castle grounds was restored for use by Agnes Conway as a study. After the war, Lord Conway set about clearing the exterior of the castle from the ramshackle collection of rural buildings that had accumulated over the centuries just outside the walls. They were replaced with planted poplars and gardens built under Philip Tilden. The Great Hall was rebuilt by 1927, and the restoration of the north-east wing was completed by 1932. Lord Conway died in 1937, whereupon Agnes inherited Allington Castle. By this time, the restoration work had ceased for lack of funds and the castle was leased between 1936 and 1946 to the politician and architect Alfred Bossom. Agnes Conway subsequently returned to it with her husband, George Horsfield. After Agnes died in 1950 the castle was sold by her husband to the Order of Carmelites from the nearby Aylesford Priory at a price of £15,000, and it became the home of a community of Carmelite Friars from March 1951. There was a certain amount of historical irony in this, as the Wyatts of Allington Castle had obtained Aylesford Priory and dispossessed its occupants during Henry VIII's Dissolution of the Monasteries; now the tables were turned. View of Allington Castle from the River Medway The castle was managed between 1951 and 1958 by the Institute of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, which undertook a substantial programme of repairs and restoration. It subsequently became a centre for ecumenical work with the monastic community at Aylesford taking on responsibility for running it. Further renovations were undertaken to provide accommodation and facilities for the castle's inhabitants. In September 1972, Allington Castle became an independent priory. The friars eventually vacated the castle in 1999.Ingleton, p. 94 It is now the home of Sir Robert Worcester, the founder of the MORI polling company. The castle is not open to the public, but is used as a wedding venue. It has been a Grade I listed building since 1951. Architecture Plan of Allington Castle in 1906 Allington Castle takes the form of an irregular parallelogram with a curtain wall incorporating six round towers of various sizes. A gatehouse, incorporating the remains of the original manor house from which the castle developed, stands on the north-west side. The largest and most significant of the towers, the four-storeyed Solomon's Tower, projects from the south-west side of the curtain wall. Just to its north, adjoining the west curtain wall, is the Penchester Lodgings, one of two surviving ranges of early buildings, which may incorporate remains of the earlier manor house. The banqueting hall and main apartments stood against the east curtain wall. It has largely been reconstructed, though the 15th-century porch is original. The interior of the castle was once a single large open space, but is divided into a large outer and a smaller inner courtyard. The latter was once occupied by buildings against the south curtain wall and appears to have been the site of the first castle on the site, judging by the remains of foundations discovered during Conway's restoration work. The range dividing the two courtyards contains the Long Gallery on the upper floor, with offices below. The buildings in the south-east corner were occupied by kitchens and a buttery with rooms above. The moat surrounding the castle was once flooded and was crossed by a drawbridge, with a portcullis closing the entrance to the castle. The ruins of a barbican can be seen on the far side of the moat. A short distance to the south-west of the castle is a low mound, which is all that survives of the 12th-century motte.  In film  The Castle was the site of the filming of the 1975 children's movie Robin Hood Junior, produced by the Children's Film Foundation (CFF) and starring Keith Chegwin as young Robin. Allington Castle was depicted as the Locksley (or Loxley) Castle of Lord Gilbert during the Crusades era.  In television  The Castle was the site of the filming of the 1965 episode \\"Castle De'ath\\" of The Avengers TV series. It also served for the external shots and views for the castle Covington Cross in the eponymously named 1992 TV series Covington Cross.  In music  The Castle was the site of the filming of the music video for \\"Lover Chanting\\" by the Swedish band Little Dragon.

It was established as a substitute for tariff reform and protectionist legislation and this is why it was eventually abolished in 1933, as a system of imperial preference replaced free trade. According to one study, the board failed to promote intra-Empire trade.  Overview  Amery was its first Chairman, Sir Stephen George Tallents its Secretary, Edward Mayow Hastings Lloyd its Assistant Secretary, and Walter Elliot was Chairman of its Research Committee. The EMB had three principal aims: * to support scientific research; * promotion of economic analysis; and * publicity for Empire trade. In 1925 the Imperial Economic Committee; a board which hosted representatives from the Dominions and Britain; conceived the Empire Marketing Board to generate public support for purchasing Empire goods. The Committee wrote “that the grant of £1 million per annum should be spent by an ‘executive commission’ which would undertake a ‘national movement’ to increase Empire buying by the British public”. The Empire Marketing Board would implement its budget on a variety of projects including scientific research and advertisement. The clear purpose of the Empire Marketing Board was to boost Empire trade through the promotion of Dominion and British goods while also improving their production to become more advantageous to foreign competition. The Empire Marketing Board’s formal objectives were declared shortly after its creation in saying that scientific research and marketing tactics were primary objectives for the Board to assist private industries across the Empire. This message is found in the first annual report of the Empire Marketing Board with an address by Secretary Stephen Tallents who wrote > Fundamentally the stimulation of Empire marketing must depend on the private > enterprise of producers and traders… The best service that can be done to > the Empire producer is to place freely at his disposal the resources of > science and economic investigation – to see that he is made aware of sowing > and planting, of tending and harvesting; to show him how his produce should > be graded and packed to ensure that it is transported safely and without > deterioration: to suggest lastly how its presentation, in the shop window or > on the counter, may be fitted to win the housewife’s critical eye.  Scientific research  Scientific research took up a large proportion of the EMB's work and budget. It also assisted 126 agricultural and medical research projects and issued many Intelligence Notes, pamphlets and surveys. In 1931 Walter Elliot of the Royal Society detailed the research programs of the Empire Marketing Board in saying that > a large group of grants is made towards the fostering of Central > Institutions are trained, such as Cambridge University and the Imperial > College of Tropical Agriculture in Trinidad. For these two purposes £189,000 > has been pledged. Another example is a grant of £65,000 for the study of > animal health problems, to Onderstepoort Station at Pretoria, the sum of > £58,000 to a wide investigation into the deficiencies of natural pasture > centred at the Rowett Institute at Aberdeen, and £160,000 to the Low > Temperature Research Station at Cambridge, with its allied Cold Store at > East Malling in Kent. The mandate to focus on scientific research would prove to be a large undertaking when accompanied by an aggressive advertising campaign that would run until 1933. The scientific research was large and widespread across the Empire encompassing a multitude of the branches of the sciences with large amounts of funding put into each program. The research would continue across the Empire with investigations into improving Empire production and industry with large amounts of funding until 1933 with the closure of the Empire Marketing Board. The EMB made links with buyers and produced analyses of markets to help producers. Tallents decided that EMB's staff should employ personnel directly from the media and the advertising industry - as well as giving commissions to some of the most talented poster artists of the day.  Advertisement campaigns  The EMB organised poster campaigns, exhibitions, 'Empire Shopping Weeks', Empire shops, lectures, radio talks, schools tour, its own library, advertisements in the national and local press and of shop window displays. Most famous was the EMB film unit led by John Grierson, often considered the father of modern documentary film, which produced around 100 films with such names as Solid Sunshine (which promoted New Zealand butter), Drifters (North Sea herring), The Song of Ceylon (tea), Wheatfields of the Empire, Industrial Britain and One Family. None of the \\"empire shops\\" proposed in the 1920s ever opened. A public art exhibit in 2016 used the empire shops as a way of thinking about postcolonialism and globalization.Daniel Fernández Pascual, Alon Schwabe, The Empire Remains Shop: Cooking Sections, Columbia University Press 2018, Efforts by the Empire Marketing Board to increase consumer purchasing of Empire produced goods was pursued through a large scale aggressive advertisement campaign. The primary method of advertisement came through the use of posters and printed media with large print and vibrant colours to entice consumers. The posters were uniquely designed as the Empire Marketing Board “used a series of five posters in a sequence, a little like a cartoon strip, with each of the posters telling a part of the story in pictures, or with copy and slogans… erected in over 1700 sites, in 450 British cities and towns”. This ad campaign flooded British markets and was to a lesser extent across to the Dominions. The messaging on the posters was tailored to men and women separately in order to support the old styled imagery connected to the Empire. The posters that were released by the Empire Marketing Board “depicted men as ‘Empire Builders’ and showed women buying empire products, especially food. The idea of women as citizen-consumers was spread further by the BBC’s Household Talks in 1928 in collaboration with the EMB to encourage and instruct women in the use of empire materials and goods”. These advertisements attempted to use bold colours and stir patriotic feelings amongst citizens of the Empire but the effectiveness of the campaign also drew criticism. Colonial governments were reluctant to join the EMB, however. Some Dominions of the Empire protested that the posters did not have an effect on their exports and there were unintended effects. The government of New Zealand reported that the poster series were “ineffective as sellers of produce and of little practical value… The whole empire propaganda work is carried out from the political angle of impressing the dominions with what it is doing rather than from the point of selling Empire Produce”. What opinions may exist about the Empire Marketing Board and its short campaign for inter-Empire trade did have a lasting impact through the posters, shopping weeks, radio shows and numerous other advertisements it ran. The EMB was ended September 1933 as a result of government cuts and the introduction of Imperial Preference. The film unit was moved to GPO, and during World War II was reorganised into the Crown Film Unit. There is a collection of the EMB's posters at the Manchester Art Gallery and some originals at the Victoria Falls Hotel, Zimbabwe, as well as the National Archives of Canada.

The channel focused on fitness and exercise-related programming. FitTV offered programming with such fitness celebrities as Cathe Friedrich, Sharon Mann, Gilad Janklowicz, Marilu Henner, Tamilee Webb and others. On February 1, 2011, it merged with Discovery Health Channel to become Discovery Fit & Health, now known as Discovery Life. HistoryEstablishment= International Family Entertainment (IFE) debuted a continuous preview of the Cable Health Club on August 20, 1993. Beginning Aug. 31, the channel would be available in a half-hour continuous programming format to cable system operators for free. In October, the channel moved to 24-hour programming. Jake Steinfeld, who had starred on the network's Big Brother Jake, hosted its first program and was a constant presence on the channel in its early years. The original formatting of an hour on Cable Health Club included a 20-minute aerobic conditioning workout at the top of the hour featuring Tamilee Webb; a segment on healthy living; a Body by Jake workout starting at the bottom of the hour; and \\"Fitness Plus\\", a home shopping segment for fitness items and equipment. In 1994, Cable Health Club received new sponsors and minority partners, Reebok International (its first charter advertiser) and Liberty Media. By this time, the channel was received in one million homes and carried for two hours a day on the Family Channel.\\"Cable Health Club takes new partners.\\" Adweek Western Edition 2 May 1994: 12. By November 1994, the Club was sharing a channel with Prime Sports Northwest on Seattle cable. In January 1997, Cox Communications paired the service with Home Team Sports between the hours of 5:30–11 a.m. The service took out full- page ads in The Virginian-Pilot newspaper through May 4, requesting viewers to call a toll free number to register support for the channel to be 24 hours with responses forwarded to Cox. By April 1997, the Cable Health Club was renamed Fit TV.

The \\"Health Mall\\" carried upscale, harder-to-find items for a healthy living. AHN had a deal with Clearwater, Florida-based Home Shopping Network to provide orders and shipping infrastructure. For cable operators, carriage deals included a small percentage of advertising and shopping revenue. With an initial cable audience of 200,000 subscribers, America's Health Network had reached 700,000 subscribers by May 1996 and 6 million by the time of the sale of its first majority owners. However, cable carriage was a long struggle for AHN and other cable outlets that launched in this time frame (Electronic Media, now TV Week magazine, described the environment many cable networks launched in 1996 faced as a \\"jungle\\"). Time Warner Cable, the primary cable provider in Orlando, did not carry AHN, and so many people in the channel's own hometown were unable to see its programs.

The name is derived from the temporary chubby-cheeked resemblance to putti, often confused with cherubs, in Renaissance paintings. Signs and symptoms The appearance of people with the disorder is caused by a loss of bone in the mandible which the body replaces with excessive amounts of fibrous tissue. In most cases, the condition fades as the child grows, but in rare cases the condition continues to deform the affected person's face. Cherubism also causes premature loss of the primary teeth and lack of eruption of the permanent teeth. Cherubism is a rare autosomal dominant disease of the maxilla and mandible. Approximately 200 cases have been reported by medical journals with the majority being males. Cherubism is usually first diagnosed around age 7 and continues through puberty and may or may not continue to advance with age. Degrees of cherubism vary from mild to severe. Osteoclastic and osteoblastic remodeling contributes to the change of normal bone to fibrous tissue and cyst formation. As noted by the name, the patient's face becomes enlarged and disproportionate due to the fibrous tissue and atypical bone formation. The sponge-like bone formations lead to early tooth loss and permanent tooth eruption problems. The condition also affects the orbital area, creating an upturned eye appearance. The cause of cherubism is believed to be traced to a genetic defect resulting from a mutation of the SH3BP2 gene from chromosome 4p16.3. While the condition is rare and painless, the afflicted suffer the emotional trauma of disfigurement. The effects of cherubism may also interfere with normal jaw motion and speech. Currently, removal of the tissue and bone by surgery is the only treatment available. This condition is also one of the few that unexpectedly stops and regresses. Normal bone remodeling activity may resume after puberty. Cherubism is displayed with genetic conformation and when excessive osteoclasts are found in the affected areas of the mandible and maxilla. Large cysts will be present with excessive fibrous areas inside the bone. The fibers and cysts will be found among the trabecula of the Coronoid process, the ramus of mandible, the body of mandible and the maxilla regions. The maxilla will be affected up to and including the orbits and sometimes inside the lower orbits. The maxilla and zygomatic bones are depressed and eyes appear to gaze upward. The maxilla has been found to be more severely affected in most cases than the mandible bone. Some patients found with lower inner orbital growths and cysts may lose vision.  Causes  Cherubism is autosomal dominantly linked. Cherubism has also been found from the random mutation of a gene in an individual having no family history of the condition. However it is not well understood why males tend to express the disease more frequently. Children with cherubism vary in severity in their maxilla and mandible bony lesions. The disease is expressed at a rate of 80 to 100% of all affected. Studies of multiple generations of families with the gene found that all boys developed cherubism, but 30–50% of girls show no symptoms. The cause of cherubism is believed to be from a mutation of gene of SH3BP2. Cherubism has also been found combined with other genetic disorders including Noonan syndrome, Ramon syndrome, and fragile X syndrome. Mutations of the SH3BP2 gene are only reported in 75% of Cherubism cases. The mutation of the SH3BP2 gene is believed to increase production of over active proteins from this gene. The SH3BP2 gene is found on the smaller arm of chromosome 4 at position 16.3. The SH3BP2 protein is involved with chemical signaling to immune system cells known as macrophages and B cells. The effects of SH3BP2 mutations are still under study, but researchers believe that the abnormal protein disrupts critical signaling pathways in cells associated with the maintenance of bone tissue and in some immune system cells. The overactive protein likely causes inflammation in the jaw bones and triggers the production of osteoclasts, which are cells that break down bone tissue during bone remodeling. Osteoclasts also sense the increased inflammation of the mandible and maxilla and are further activated to break down bone structures. Bone loss and inflammation lead to increased fibrous tissue and cyst growth. An excess of these bone-eating cells contributes to the destruction of bone in the upper and lower jaws. A combination of bone loss and inflammation likely underlies the cyst-like growths characteristic of cherubism. Diagnosis The chemical imbalance is usually diagnosed when dental abnormalities are found. These abnormalities include premature deciduous teeth and abnormal growth of permanent teeth due to displacement by cysts and lesions. The only definite way to correctly diagnose the condition is by sequence analysis of the SH3BP2 gene. The gene has been found to have missense mutation in exon 9. Initial study of the patient is usually conducted using x-ray and CT scans. Neurofibromatosis may resemble cherubism and may accompany the condition. Genetic testing is the final diagnosis tool.  Prevention  Because this genetic anomaly is genetically linked, genetic counseling may be the only way to decrease occurrences of cherubism. The lack of severe symptoms in the parents may be the cause of failure in recognizing the disorder. The optimal time to be tested for mutations is prior to having children. The disorder results from a genetic mutation, and this gene has been found to spontaneously mutate. Therefore, there may be no prevention techniques available. Treatment Because cherubism changes and improves over time, the treatment should be individually determined. Generally, moderate cases are watched until they subside or progress into the more severe range. Severe cases may require surgery to eliminate bulk cysts and fibrous growth of the maxilla and mandible. Surgical bone grafting of the cranial facial bones may be successful on some patients. Surgery is preferred for patients aged 5 to 15. Special consideration should be taken when operating on the face to avoid the marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve as well as the zygomatic branch of the facial nerve. Unintentional damage to these nerves can decrease muscle strength in the face and mandible region. Orthodontic treatment is generally required to avoid permanent dental problems arising from malocclusive bite and misplaced permanent teeth that have not erupted. Orthodontic treatment may be used to erupt permanent teeth that have been unable to descend due to lesions and cysts being in their path of eruption. Patients with orbital issues of diplopia, eye proptosis, and visual loss will require ophthalmologic treatment.  Prognosis  Due to the rarity of the condition, it is difficult to reliably estimate statistics. However, a 2006 study which followed 7 cases over an average of 8.5 years noted that \\"In general, cherubism does not have a poor prognosis. It has been noted that the condition does not progress beyond puberty. As the patient grows to adulthood, the jawbone lesions tend to resolve, and a progressively more normal jaw configuration is noted.\\" History Cherubism was first documented and named in 1933 by Dr. W. A. Jones of Kingston, Ontario, describing a case of three siblings of the same family of Jewish Russian heritage. All that was known at the time was the characteristic swelling pattern and the increase and then regress of bone lesions. By the time the children reached the ages of fifteen, sixteen, and seventeen, the facial deformity had become an obvious disfigurement and in 1943, the children were operated on by the Jones medical team, reducing the hard swelling of their jaws. Four years following the surgeries, there was no reappearance of the swellings. Yet, in some cases dysplasia recurred after surgery, necessitating additional surgeries.

History  The band was started by brothers Eddy and Danny Garcia in the early 1990s and was originally named \\"Back Door Cyclops.\\" They then changed their name after a coined phrase thought up by the original vocalist, Dave McNutt, after he contracted \\"the clap\\" and described the pain. In the late 1990s, McNutt quit and Joe Rodriguez was brought on. A short time later, drummer Danny Garcia decided to move from El Paso, TX to New York City, NY. and Eddie took this opportunity to switch from playing guitar to drums while Matt Lynch moved from bass to guitar. This left the group with a spot for a new bassist. Rick Valles, a long time guitarist who used to be part of another band with Joe Rodriguez was then hired as the new bassist. This line-up proved to be progressive as the four began to work on new material. In 1997, after submitting countless demos to record labels across the US, the band was signed to German/Los Angeles-based Noise Records and released their self-titled CD the following year. Five more albums were released in the band's four-year existence and the band got the opportunity to participate in several festivals and shows across the world. In 2000, the band was asked to contribute a song for a Pantera tribute album, entitled \\"Panther: A Tribute To Pantera\\" from Eclipse Records. They provided the opening track, \\"Domination\\". Shortly after their first major tour, Mat Lynch decided to depart the band as the toll of being away from his wife and child grew heavy and the band's financial situation had not improved since the contract with Noise Records. The band would recruit then-guitar tech for Lynch, Cesar \\"Achmex\\" Soto into his place. This only made sense, as Soto was already familiar with the material and was open to extended time away from home and did not have a family to support. The band continued writing material for the \\"Fields Of Disbelief\\" album where Soto's classical style contributed to the now modified sound of the band. Later in 2000, singer Joe Rodriguez quit the band as well, due to his growing family and financial needs. The band at this point were still proving their worth to the label and were not generating sufficient income despite the low cost of living in far west Texas. Joe was replaced by Jason \\"Dewey\\" Bragg from California who again was from another unsigned band. Bragg who only recorded on the 2001 album \\"Where We Come From\\", left shortly afterwards due to conflicting personalities that were not discovered until they were on the \\"Where We Come From\\" tour. Jason Bragg was quickly replaced by a local vocalist from El Paso; Andre Acosta who had not worked with any signed bands in addition to not having any touring experience. Some say this was a missed opportunity to hire a seasoned member who could help level off the group's lineup changes while providing insight to the music business. By this time, the band had gained some traction and could attract talent from other bands on the same level. Andre's studio test and first contribution to the band would be the live album \\"Live in the Devil's Triangle\\", titled after the nickname given to the area of town where Eddie Garcia grew up in and featured the band's actual touring RV on the cover. Despite the recording being marketed as a live performance, the recording was done in the same studio that the first unsigned release was recorded in with a few close friends providing the \\"live crowd\\" sounds. 2002 brought yet another detrimental line-up change when Cesar \\"Achmex\\" Soto abruptly quit the band in October due to the everlasting financial issues of the band. The band was still not generating enough income to support the band and all of the other members were working part- time/seasonal jobs when not on tour. Cesar contacted the widely popular at the time Roadrunner Records site; Blabbermouth.net to publicly announce his departure even though he was asked to keep it under wraps as the remaining partners (Eddie and Rick) figured out the band's next step. Shortly after, it was announced on the same site that he had joined fellow ex-members of the band; Matt Lynch and Joe Rodriguez in a new unsigned and short lived project named \\"Fueled II Fire\\". Before the end of the year, founding members; Eddy and Rick contracted Matt Difabio, from Langhorne, PA as Soto's replacement. Difabio, was also involved in leading a band of his own as well as his own local small business. Difabio and Acosta contributed to the 2003 \\"Evolution\\" CD. The band then followed the release with a short tour. In 2004, Pissing Razors quietly disbanded following the less than enthusiastic response of the band's final record \\"Evolution\\". Some blame the constant lineup changes, bad management and the lack of talent that would take the music seriously ultimately contributed to their down fall. In 2014, Pissing Razors announced an attempt to \\"put the band back together\\" on social media. Despite the fact that the rehash involved founding members; Eddie, Matt, and Joe, Rick Valles decided to not participate in this regroup and thus they were forced to start in the same manner they left off in ten years prior, with new and inexperienced talent. In the past 5 years, the band have released two new tracks as well as a music video as part of this effort but have not had any attention by a record label and have only done a few shows here and there.

The World League Against Alcoholism was organized by the Anti-Saloon League, whose goal became establishing prohibition not only in the United States but throughout the entire world. As ratification of the Eighteenth Amendment creating prohibition in the U.S. neared, Anti-Saloon leader Ernest Cherrington promoted creation of the World League Against Alcoholism. Created in 1919, the new organization cooperated with temperance groups in over 50 countries on six continents. It provided assistance including speakers and educational materials to advance an international temperance movement. Just as the Anti-Saloon League opposed not only saloons but any consumption of alcohol, the World League Against Alcoholism not only sought to prevent alcoholism but any consumption of alcoholic beverages. Following the repeal of prohibition in 1933, the Anti- Saloon League's fortunes fell dramatically and it found itself unable to continue supporting the World League Against Alcoholism.

Population Inhabitants of Pont-Aven are called in French Pontavenistes. History * Pont-Aven is mentioned among the towns which took part in the Breton anti-tax Rebellion of the Red Bonnets against Louis XIV of France in 1675. Arts Pont-Aven is mainly known because of the group of artists who flocked round Émile Bernard and Paul Gauguin, and who were joined in 1888 by Paul Sérusier. They were collectively known as \\"Pont-Aven School\\" (French: École de Pont-Aven, Breton: Skol Pont- Aven). Pont Aven School of Contemporary Art (PASCA) is an international fine arts program located in the historic artists' colony of Pont-Aven (Brittany, France). The student body is made up of third-year university or art college honors students or post-baccalaureate art majors (fourth/fifth-year) seeking further study. The Musée des Beaux Arts de Pont-Aven houses a historical reconstruction of Pont-Aven at the end of the 19th century as well as a permanent collection dedicated to the Pont-Aven School. Pont Aven still attracts artists and art lovers with many commercial galleries in addition to the town's public gallery. Pont-Aven, le port Geography The Aven River runs through Pont-Aven. The river has relatively favourable water quality, with pH levels slightly alkaline at about 8.5 and electrical conductivity of 19 micro Siemens per centimeter.Hogan, C Michael, \\"Water quality of fresh water bodies in northern France\\", Lumina Press, Aberdeen, Scotland 2006 The town is at the interface of the tidal estuary and the freshwater river. Sights Before Pont-Aven attracted Gauguin and other artists it was a centre for milling with the river Aven being divided above the town to provide a mill race which powers a series of water mills. Whilst several of these retain their wheels only the last, the Moulin Poulguin, is still capable of operating. The mill is now a restaurant and you can see the machinery inside. Just outside the town are the beech woods of the Bois d'Amour, a source of inspiration for many artists. The town is close to Domaine de Kerlann Holiday Park on the road to the adjoining commune of Nevez. To the northwest of the town, in the small community of Nizon, the ruins of Château de Rustéphan are to be found. Nizon was more famous than Pont-Aven at the 19th century but the painters made it well known. Popular culture The Brittany Ferries flagship is named after the town. Les Galettes de Pont-Aven is a 1975 drama on the life of a middle-aged aspirant painter who settles in the town. Pont-Aven is the setting for Death in Brittany (2012), the first book in the series of Commissaire Dupin detective novels by Jean-Luc Bannalec (Jörg Bong).

One of the primary causes for the rise in the number of smaller land holders was a decline in the custom of primogeniture. Towards the end of the Kamakura period, inheritance began to be split among a lord's sons, making each heir's holdings, and thus their power, smaller. Over time, many of these smaller fiefs came to be dominated by the shugo, constables who were administrators appointed by the shogunate to oversee the provinces. Resentful and mistrustful of the interference of government officials, people under their control banded together into leagues called ikki. The uprisings that resulted, particularly when the shugo tried to seize control of entire provinces, were also called ikki; some of the largest and most famous took place in Wakasa Province in the 1350s.

As of 2009, all servers have been shut down. However, there is a fan based version http://bomber-world.com still active today. In early 2003, after the beta-testing phase, Bomberman Online was shut down in Japan. The official website stated that the game was stopped for debugging and was in development for a commercial release. The Taiwan server supported Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau regions, however on November 1, 2005 the game went out of business in those regions. In October 2005, The Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau site announced that they were closing the websites and all the servers involved with the game. This announcement caused a wave of shock amongst many players in that region. In response, several users in the forums declared that they will attempt to clone the game and setup private servers with no moderators or administrators doing anything to stop it. The end result became Bomberman Online International.http://www.bomber-world.com/ The Japanese version went back online on December 1, 2005, but then closed again on July 31, 2007. Gameplay There are four gameplay modes in Online Bomberman: 'Survival Mode', 'Panel Paint Mode', 'Hyperbomb Mode', and 'Boss Battle Mode'. *In Survival Rule, you either battle in a team or by yourself. You must kill all opposing players in order to win. *In Panel Paint Mode, the floor is colored. When your bomb explodes, the floor will be covered with your team color. When you die you will be revived but the area you had 'occupied' will be erased. *In Hyperbomb Mode, there are special hyperbomb items that you have to collect in order to win. There are 5 items in total. However, you only need to collect 3 then reach the center of the room in order to win. The difficult part in this game setting is that sometimes you must choose between letting your character die or losing all of your collected items. *In Boss Survival Mode, the player will face a boss of his or her choice. The boss will place special bombs and hide. To combat the boss, the player can purchase items and use it for special effects. There are 2 other buttons found in the game's data with the text 'Submarine Mode' and 'Ring Match'; the two have never taken place in the releases. =Item shop= In late 2004, Bomberman Online in Taiwan and Hong Kong opened an item shop where players could buy items for the boss battle mode including character cards and nickname cards. Character cards are characters that require a money payment, and can only be used for a short period of time. There are two kinds of nickname cards. One type will affect the background of the nickname display area, the other one will simply change the color of the text. Both of the items affect the player's name display. In order to buy items, user must obtain Bomberyen. Bomberyen can be obtained through normal gameplay, by defeating bosses in Boss Survival Mode, by entering Tournaments, or by purchasing it with cash. Item shop also existed in the new version of the Japanese Bomberman Online, containing clothing and accessories to be used by a custom character in the game. Net de Bomberman In 2004, Bomberman Online got ported over to the PlayStation 2 in Japan only as Net de Bomberman. Unlike the US-only Dreamcast release, it is completely designed around its (now defunct) subscription-based online multiplayer, without any support for offline play. Only playable online, the game features ten different maps, based on the grid-like mazes seen in classic Bomberman titles. Accompanied by up to seven other players, the player has to collect items and kill enemies in order to unlock new stages. Players were able to communicate with other players through online chat. From November 2003 to February 2004, the game could be played as a free pre-launch test. After the time frame ended, the service required a monthly payment of ¥500 (tax excluded). In 2008, this service was discontinued. Bomberman Online Japan Bomberman Online Japan (ボンバーマンオンライン Japan) is the successor of Bomberman Online. The software uses Shockwave Entertainment, Inc.'s 55Shock! online service. It was released on PC in Japan only. Player obtains experience points during battle. Each player has a bomb waza bar. When the bar is full, it refills the bomb waza gauge. When the gauge is full, player can use a bomb technique. Items collected in a course can be saved for later use.

Written in 1973, it was inspired by George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four and, like much of its parent album, originally intended for a stage musical based on the novel, which was never produced because permission was refused by Orwell's widow Sonia.Roy Carr & Charles Shaar Murray (1981). Bowie: An Illustrated Record: p.64  Music and lyrics  The centrepiece of Side Two of the original vinyl album, in the context of Bowie's adaptation of Orwell's story, \\"1984\\" has been interpreted as representing Winston Smith's imprisonment and interrogation by O'Brien. The lyrics also bear some similarities to Bowie's earlier song \\"All the Madmen\\", from The Man Who Sold the World (\\"They'll split your pretty cranium and fill it full of air\\").Nicholas Pegg (2000). The Complete David Bowie: p.153 \\"1984\\"'s wah-wah guitar sound is often likened to the \\"Theme from Shaft\\" (1971) by Isaac Hayes.David Buckley (1999). Strange Fascination – David Bowie: The Definitive Story: p.214 Played by Alan Parker, it was one of the few instances on the Diamond Dogs album where Bowie himself did not take the lead guitar part. The track's funk/soul influence has been cited as a clear indicator of where Bowie's style was headed on his next album, Young Americans.  Recording and release  \\"1984\\" was first recorded during the Aladdin Sane sessions.Kevin Cann (2010). Any Day Now – David Bowie: The London Years: 1947–1974: p.283 The song received its public debut, in a medley with \\"Dodo\\", known as \\"1984/Dodo\\", on the U.S. TV special The 1980 Floor Show (later bootlegged on record as Dollars in Drag), which was recorded in London on 18–20 October 1973. A studio version of \\"1984/Dodo\\" was recorded around that time, but went unreleased until it appeared on the Sound + Vision box set in 1989. This was Bowie's last recording with Mick Ronson, Trevor Bolder and producer Ken Scott at Trident Studios, London. In addition to the \\"1984/Dodo\\" medley, \\"Dodo\\" and \\"1984\\" were also recorded separately, \\"Dodo\\" as a demo in September 1973Kevin Cann (2010).

The final version of \\"1984\\" was faster and funkier than the medley and, as described by Bowie encyclopedist Nicholas Pegg, \\"an obvious single if there ever was one\\". However, it was released as a single (PB 10026) only in America, Japan and New Zealand, where it failed to chart. The track generally opened the Diamond Dogs concerts in 1974 but was not performed live after the soul tour in 1975.

P. Lovecraft and Kenneth J. Sterling, written in January 1936 and first published in Weird Tales magazine in October 1939. It is unusual among Lovecraft's work, being a standard science fiction story involving space exploration in the near future. Plot The story, written in first-person narrative is Lovecraft's first and only foray into science fiction, and depicts the life and death of a prospector on the planet Venus who, while working for a mining company, becomes trapped in an invisible maze. The story takes place in the future, when humanity has developed space travel and begun to explore Venus. There, they discover valuable crystal orbs that can be used as a source of electrical power, as well as a race of primitive lizardmen who guard the crystals fervently and who attack any humans who try to take them. The narrator, Kenton J. Stanfield, is one of many explorers employed to collect the crystals. He is equipped with a breathing apparatus fueled by oxygen cubes (as Venus' atmosphere cannot sustain human life) and has a leather protective suit, as well as a \\"flame pistol\\" to use against lizardmen. While on a routine mission, the narrator encounters a bizarre structure: a maze whose walls are completely invisible, inside of which is a crystal of unusually large size. The prize is held by a dead prospector. The protagonist, feeling confident he can map out the maze, makes his way to the center after collecting the crystal in order to explore the structure. However, he soon discovers that he has misjudged the maze, and is unable to relocate the entrance point. Trapped in the maze, the narrator's oxygen and water supply steadily begins to run out, and lizardmen soon begin to gather at the outside of the maze to observe and mock him. Realizing the futility of his situation, the narrator begins to grasp the religious significance of the crystals to the lizardmen, and also realizes that the maze's nature as a constructed structure, and as a trap, indicates that the lizardmen are actually more intelligent than the humans are willing to admit. In time he realizes that he will face the same fate as the preceding prospector. Dying, the narrator writes down his observations on a futuristic form of recording paper. He describes how in his last moments he has developed a feeling of kinship with the lizardmen, and pleads with his superiors to leave Venus, the lizardmen, and the crystals alone, as they hold mysteries humanity cannot begin to grasp, and mankind does not really need to exploit them. The narrator's testimony, along with his body, are soon recovered by a search party, who discover an additional exit just behind the ground where Stanfield died, which the prospector missed when attempting to map out the maze. However, his dying pleas for humanity to leave Venus alone are dismissed by his employers as unfortunate dementia caused by his desperate situation, and instead the crystal mining company decides to use draconian measures to annihilate the lizardmen completely. Analysis The name of the story's main character, Kenton J. Stanfield, closely resembles that of its co-author, Kenneth J. Sterling. Eryx, or the Erycinian Highland, is a vast plateau on Venus. Unlike the actual planet, Lovecraft's Venus has a tropical climate and is filled with lush, swampy jungles, though its atmosphere is poisonous to humans, while at the same time not so dangerous as to require hermetically sealed space suits. The themes of prejudice, religious intolerance, and discrimination are evident in the story. The references in the story to \\"wriggling akmans\\" and \\"efjeh-weeds\\" are believed to be jokes aimed at Forrest J Ackerman, a correspondent with whom Lovecraft feuded over Ackerman's criticism of a Clark Ashton Smith story.Joshi and Schultz, p. 1. The story contains several other in-jokes, including references to \\"farnoth flies\\" (for Weird Tales editor Farnsworth Wright) and \\"ugrats\\" (derived from \\"Hugo the Rat\\", Lovecraft's unaffectionate nickname for Wonder Stories editor Hugo Gernsback). Writing Sterling, a precocious Providence high school student who had befriended Lovecraft the previous year, gave Lovecraft a draft of the story in January 1936. This draft included the idea of an invisible maze—a concept Sterling recalled as being derived from the story \\"The Monster-God of Mamurth\\" by Edmond Hamilton, published in the August 1926 issue of Weird Tales, which featured an invisible building in the Sahara Desert. Lovecraft thoroughly rewrote Sterling's draft, lengthening the story to 12,000 words (from an original 6,000-8,000). Though the original draft does not survive, most of the prose in the published version is believed to be Lovecraft's. Reception The story seems to have been rejected by Weird Tales, Astounding Stories, Blue Book, Argosy, Wonder Stories, and possibly Amazing Stories. After Lovecraft's death, it was resubmitted to Weird Tales and finally published in its October 1939 issue. ReferencesSources  * Definitive version. External links * In the Walls of Eryx by H.P.

History Band Formation and Early Years (1993–1998)= In the early 1990s Britt Edwards, Jason Light, Dwayne Coppedge, and West Adams were singing in the band Christ Denomination (or CD Boys). At times the band invited such friends as Jason Brown (Sessoms) and Adam Stone to perform with them. This was one of the first Christian bands that Edwards would be in. Christ Denomination performed original songs and covers (DC Talk was a favorite). After CD Boys split, Light became a sheriff's deputy, marry Ginger, and have two children. He is now doing sales. He started No Ticket, No Problem, a free concert that featured such artists as T-Bone, Christafari and The Swift. While Christ Denomination was ending, Regeneration X was beginning in a local Baptist church with a few teens, Danny Daughtridge (vocals/bass/songwriter), Mike Simons (drums) and Matt Wilder (lead guitarist). Regex, as they were known by locals, sounded like a teen garage band at the time. Jason Williams was free from any band obligations so he joined Regex as a rhythm guitarist to give them a fuller sound. Britt Edwards was asked to join the band after a party in the back yard of a mutual friend, Christ Turner. A great musical shift in the band occurred when Adam Stone was asked to join and play drums (also Animal played for a short while as well). Mike Simons moved to percussion and harmonica solos. Over the next three years the 14-year-old Simons became an accomplished percussionist, bassist, guitarist and even, a banjo player. Regex took off in the local area and created a large fan base. Edwards had always felt a calling and also was pursuing a solo ministry, which left Regex without a full-time front man. Second Nature, was also in the making and put two Christ Denomination members back together. Dwayne Coppedge and West Adams created a Christian pop duo. With a lot of help and support from Britt Edwards, Second Nature recorded soundtracks to perform live on stage. In 1995, Second Nature traveled to Atlanta, Georgia to perform in the Atlanta-fest Artist Talent Competition where they won First Place. After AtlantaFest, Second Nature needed to expand their ministry, sound and stage presence, so with the help of John Wesley Linton, they began to expand their personal style. In a collaboration of talent, John Wesley Linton helped to open another opportunity for them. With West Adams, Dwayne Coppedge, Matt Wilder, Mike Simons and Bo Faulkner, \\"Zacchaeus Tree\\" was formed. Linton, of Greenville, North Carolina, promoted and managed the band as a mentor, financial advisor, and band pastor under the name 'Sunday School Hype'. With original music, strong vocals and powerful guitar ballads, the band's ministry grew quickly. Mike Simons and Matt Wilder were still in high school, but Zaccheus Tree allowed them the chance to perform on the local stage and on a much larger regional level. During the band's time together they ministered and performed all over the Southeast. The band was asked to open for several major Christian artists, which offered the hope of a record deal. However, with time conflicts and creative differences the band decided, together, to explore different musical avenues. Zacchaeus Tree ended in 1999. West Adams went on writing, singing and performing, focusing on country and pop. Dwayne Coppedge joined the Anchorman (a popular Southern Gospel Group) and now is serving in a local church with his wife and two children. =Puddleglum (1998–2002)= With Daughtridge and Edwards bandless, the two friends soon started meeting together and writing/recording music. Jason Williams would join them in their efforts at times. They called themselves \\"Puddleglum\\" after the C.S. Lewis character in The Chronicles of Narnia. Chris Byers replaced Jason Williams and Phillip Wall was brought in as a lead guitarist. Byers' college buddy, Trae Drose, became the permanent drummer around the same time. Danny Daughtridge left (and now performs as the Danny Daughtridge Trio) and was replaced by Wall's brother-in-law, Phil Sabella, who would later go on to form Oldmangrady with Lee Modlin and Joe Knowles. Mike Simons joined as percussionist and vocalist. Phillip Wall left to attend seminary and the band continued as a four-piece. As the band began to tour, it gained popularity which fueled the need for original music and a record label. =The Swift (2002–2004)= In 2002, the group was signed by Flicker Records and changed their name to the Swift. That year the band released their self-titled album which produced two top ten Contemporary Christian hits: \\"Under The Sun\\" and \\"More Than Gold.\\" Shortly after their album release, the Swift picked up touring dates opening up for the popular Christian band MercyMe. =Today (2004-2006)= Early 2004 brought about a line-up change. Guitarist Chris Byers left the band and was replaced by Justin Sharbono (formerly of Superchic[k] fame). The Swift then released their second album entitled Today. After only seven months with the band, guitarist Sharbono left the band to pursue other interests. In order to fill the void, the band decided to reach back into their hometown and added guitarist Matt Wilder (also from Zacchaeus Tree) to the roster in December 2004. Drummer Trae Drose announced his decision to leave the band in May 2006. He was replaced by Guy Lemon. =Singing Back to You (2006-2007)= In 2006, the band broke with Flicker Records and signed with Rocketown Records and released a softer, more contemplative album, Singing Back to You. At the Life Conference in Orlando, Florida the band announced that they were exploring other opportunities and the worship concert they gave would be the last performance of the Swift.

He has two daughters, Ada Berktay and Aslıgül Berktay, from two separate marriages. Berktay uncovered that the Turkish government purged a lot of the evidence and documents on the Armenian Genocide from the Turkish archives. According to him, the purge was \\"most probably implemented by Muharrem Nuri Birgi, a former Turkish ambassador to London and NATO and Secretary General of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs\\". Berktay also claimed that \\"at the time he was combing the archives, Nuri Birgi met regularly with a mutual friend and at one point, referring to the Armenians, ruefully confessed: 'We really slaughtered them'\\".

Traditionally, jointing was performed using a jointer plane. Modern techniques include the use of a jointer machine, a hand held router and straight edge, or a table- mounted router. Although the process derives its name from the primary task of straightening an edge prior to joining, the term jointing is used whenever this process is performed, regardless of the application. Normally, the desired outcome of jointing is an edge which is straight along its length and perpendicular to the face of the board. However, there is a technique often used when gluing up panels, referred to as a sprung joint. In this technique, the desired outcome is an edge which is slightly concave along its length. When two such edges are brought together and clamped, the sprung edges create greater tension at the ends of the join, which assists in creating a seamless joint. When using a hand plane to perform this operation, two boards are often clamped face to face in the vice and both jointed at once. This creates two edges that are the mirror image of one another. In this way, even if the edges are not perfectly perpendicular to their respective faces, when the two board edges are brought together, the result is a flat panel because the error in each edge cancels the other out.

A shipmate is literally a mate on one's own ship (i.e., a member of the same ship). In the navies of English-speaking nations (and the United States Coast Guard), the term \\"shipmate\\" is used among sailors as a generic moniker. It is used in the third person by a member of a ship's crew to describe another member, or in the second person when referring to any other Naval service member. In the United States Navy, \\"shipmate\\" is most accurately a term used by anyone in the Navy to reference anyone else in the Navy. It can be used with a range of connotations—most often as an expression of camaraderie, but also as a respectful way to address other crew members whose rank or naval rating is not obvious. It can even be used in a derogatory manner. It is used both on land and at sea and it is used among Naval service members without regard to whether they are in fact members of the same ship. The term is used so abundantly in the American Navy that the inflection, context, and tone of the speaker can connote more meaning than the term itself. In the United States Navy, recruits are indoctrinated with heavy use of the term immediately upon beginning training at Recruit Training Command (or \\"boot camp\\"). There, they use the term abundantly to refer to their peers in all but the least formal settings. Notably, recruits use the term superfluously and with enthusiasm to sound off to their peers in scenarios when referencing another person by name or title would be otherwise unnecessary. For example, a recruit in the chow line will add \\"shipmate\\" after identifying each item of food he or she wishes fellow recruits to place on his or her tray (\\"potatoes, Shipmate!\\", \\"green beans, Shipmate!\\", \\"bread, Shipmate!\\" etc.). In turn, the recruits serving his or her food will repeat the expression as the recruit moves down the line \\"potatoes, Shipmate!\\", \\"green beans, Shipmate!\\", \\"bread, Shipmate!\\"... to confirm that they understood the commands. It is used so abundantly during this stage of a sailor's training that it can sound curious to a new recruit or a visitor. The term is almost never used by superiors to refer to inferiors during recruit training except ironically or in a derogatory tone. Sometimes the term is modified to connote the derogation more explicitly, as in \\"Shipwreck\\" in reference to someone who is messy or fails to maintain a military bearing. As the extreme hierarchical distinctions in recruit training tend to fade once the recruit joins the regular Navy, so do the above distinctions. It is not uncommon to hear an Admiral or Captain refer to his lowest subordinates as \\"shipmate\\" in order to express camaraderie. Inversely, it is not uncommon for peers to refer to one another as \\"shipwreck\\" or use a vocal inflection that connotes derogation, usually with an accent on the \\"-mate.\\" The term is often used in a follow-on training status such as \\"A\\" School from superiors to their subordinates to point out deficiencies, usually when rank of the subordinate is not easily identified. An example would be \\"Hey shipmate! Fix your uniform!\\" The use of the term in this context would be similar to a division commander referring to a recruit as \\"Recruit\\". Although the term is not commonly used outside maritime scenarios, it is often used by Navy veterans toward one another as a means to reminisce or bond about shared experience. Usage in literature Herman Melville's Moby-Dick, a popular maritime novel, is laced with the term, although the narrator Ishmael seldom uses the word: \\"This man interested me at once; and since the sea-gods had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate (though but a sleeping partner one, so far as this narrative is concerned), I will here venture upon a little description of him.\\" Usage in contemporary maritime dialogue One might refer to a fellow crew member by saying, \\"He and I were shipmates before reporting for duty here in Norfolk.\\" The word is used in this sense in the old song \\"Don't Forget Your Old Shipmates\\". When getting the attention of a fellow sailor, one might simply call out \\"Shipmate!\\" or \\"Hey, shipmate!\\" When speaking to a group or crowd of sailors, i.e. \\"My fellow shipmates...\\" References * Melville, Herman. * Shipmates Chandlers Ltd Category:Nautical terminology Category:Military slang and jargon Category:Nautical slang ","title":"Shipmate"},{"id":"2764020","title":"Peter M.

Marguerite is the ancestress of the Bourbon kings of France, being the mother of Jeanne d'Albret, whose son, Henry of Navarre, succeeded as Henry IV of France, the first Bourbon king. As an author and a patron of humanists and reformers, she was an outstanding figure of the French Renaissance. Samuel Putnam called her \\"The First Modern Woman\\".Patricia F. Cholakian and Rouben C. Cholakian, Marguerite de Navarre: Mother of the Renaissance (2006). Early life Marguerite was born in Angoulême on 11 April 1492, the eldest child of Louise of Savoy and Charles, Count of Angoulême. Her father was a descendant of Charles V, and was thus the successor to the French crown by masculine primogeniture, if both Charles VIII and the presumptive heir, Louis, Duke of Orléans, were unable to produce male offspring. On 16 February 1488, her father, Charles, married eleven-year-old Louise, the daughter of Philip II of Savoy and Margaret of Bourbon, who was the sister of the Duke of Beaujeu. Louise was considered one of the most brilliant feminine minds in France and she named their first-born, \\"Marguerite\\", after her own mother. Two years after Marguerite's birth, the family moved from Angoulême to Cognac, \\"where the Italian influence reigned supreme, and where Boccaccio was looked upon as a little less than a god\\".Putnam, Samuel. Marguerite of Navarre. New York: Coward McCann, Inc.: 1935. Print. Marguerite's brother, Francis, later to be King Francis I of France, was born there on 12 September 1494. She had several half-siblings, from illegitimate relationships of her father, who were raised alongside Marguerite and her brother. Two girls, Jeanne of Angoulême and Madeleine, were born of her father's long relationship with his châtelaine, Antoinette de Polignac, Dame de Combronde, who later became Louise's lady-in-waiting and confidante.Francis Hackett, Francis The First, pages 48-52. Another half- sister, Souveraine, was born to Jeanne le Conte, also one of her father's mistresses. Her father died when she was nearly four; her one-year-old brother became heir presumptive to the throne of France. Thanks to her mother, who was only nineteen when widowed, Marguerite was carefully tutored from her earliest childhood and given a classical education that included Latin. The young princess was to be called \\"Maecenas to the learned ones of her brother's kingdom\\". When Marguerite was ten, Louise tried to marry her to the Prince of Wales, who would later become Henry VIII of England, but the alliance was courteously rebuffed. Perhaps the one real love in her life was Gaston de Foix, Duc de Nemours, nephew of King Louis XII. Gaston went to Italy, however, and died a hero at Ravenna, when the French defeated Spanish and Papal forces.Cholakian and Cholakian, Marguerite de Navarre: Mother of the Renaissance (2006) p. 21. First marriage 17th century portrait of Charles d'Alencon, Marguerite's first husband. At the age of seventeen Marguerite was married to Charles IV of Alençon, aged twenty, by the decree of King Louis XII (who also arranged the marriage of his ten-year-old daughter, Claude, to Francis). With this decree, Marguerite was forced to marry a generally kind, but practically-illiterate man for political expediency—\\"the radiant young princess of the violet-blue eyes... had become the bride of a laggard and a dolt\\". She had been bartered to save the royal pride of Louis, by keeping the County of Armagnac in the family. There were no offspring from this marriage. After the death of Queen Claude, she took in her two nieces Madeleine and Marguerite, for whom she would continue to care during her second marriage. Second marriage and recognition Henri d'Albret King of Navarre After the death of her first husband in 1525, Marguerite married Henry II of Navarre. Ferdinand II of Aragon had invaded the Kingdom of Navarre in 1512, and Henry ruled only Lower Navarre, the independent principality of Béarn, and several dependencies in Gascony. Approximately a year after the lead image (in the information box) that was painted by Jean Clouet, on 16 November 1528, Marguerite gave birth to a daughter by Henry, the future Jeanne III of Navarre, who became the mother of the future Henry IV of France. A Venetian ambassador of that time praised Marguerite as knowing all the secrets of diplomatic art, hence to be treated with deference and circumspection. Marguerite's most remarkable adventure involved freeing her brother, King Francis I, who had been held prisoner in Spain by Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor after being captured in the Battle of Pavia, Italy, 1525. During a critical period of the negotiations, Queen Marguerite rode horseback through wintry woods, twelve hours a day for many days, to meet a safe-conduct deadline, while writing her diplomatic letters at night. Her only son, Jean, was born in Blois on 7 July 1530, when Marguerite was thirty-eight, an age considered old by sixteenth century standards. The child died on Christmas Day the same year. Scholars believe that her grief motivated Marguerite to write her most controversial work, Miroir de l'âme pécheresse, in 1531. Sorbonne theologians condemned the work as heresy. A monk said Marguerite should be sewn into a sack and thrown into the Seine. Students at the Collège de Navarre satirized her in a play as \\"a Fury from Hell\\". Her brother forced the charges to be dropped, however, and obtained an apology from the Sorbonne. Legacy Marguerite de Navarre, from a crayon drawing by François Clouet, preserved at the Bibliothèque nationale de France, Paris Following the example set by her mother, Marguerite became the most influential woman in France during her lifetime when her brother acceded to the crown as Francis I in 1515. Her salon, known as the \\"New Parnassus\\", became famous internationally. Pierre Brantôme said of her: \\"She was a great princess. But in addition to all that, she was very kind, gentle, gracious, charitable, a great dispenser of alms and friendly to all.\\" The Dutch humanist Erasmus wrote to her: \\"For a long time I have cherished all the many excellent gifts that God bestowed upon you; prudence worthy of a philosopher; chastity; moderation; piety; an invincible strength of soul, and a marvelous contempt for all the vanities of this world. Who could keep from admiring, in a great king's sister, such qualities as these, so rare even among the priests and monks.\\" Marguerite wrote many poems and plays. Her most notable works are a classic collection of short stories, the Heptameron, and a remarkably intense religious poem, Miroir de l'âme pécheresse (Mirror of the Sinful Soul). This poem is a first-person, mystical narrative of the soul as a yearning woman calling out to Christ as her father- brother-lover. Her work was passed to the royal court of England, suggesting that Marguerite had influence on the Protestant Reformation in England. Role in the Reformation Following the expulsion of John Calvin and William Farel from Geneva in 1538, Marguerite de Navarre wrote to Marie Dentière, a notable French Protestant reformer in Geneva. The two women appear to have personal history outside of their written correspondence: Marguerite was godmother to the daughter of Marie Dentière and Dentière's daughter composed a French guide to the Hebrew language to send to Marguerite's daughter.Dentiére, Epistle to Marguerite de Navarre, 53. In her letter, Marguerite inquired what was the cause for Calvin and Farel's expulsion. Dentière responded in 1539 with the Epistre tres utile, commonly known today as the Epistle to Marguerite de Navarre.Marie Dentiere, Epistle to Marguerite de Navarre and Preface to a Sermon by John Calvin. Edited and translated by Mary B. McKinley. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 2004. This epistle criticized the Protestant clergy who had expelled Calvin and Farel, asked for Marguerite's support and aid in increasing scriptural literacy and access among women, and advised her to act in expelling Catholic clergy from France.Dentiére, Epistle to Marguerite de Navarre. During her years in France, Anne Boleyn had been a lady-in-waiting to Queen Claude. There is conjecture that the courts of Claude and Marguerite overlapped and that perhaps Anne was in service to Marguerite rather than to Claude, and may have become a follower of Marguerite's, absorbing her views about Christianity. A letter by Anne Boleyn after she became queen exists in which she makes strong expressions of affection to Marguerite. It is conjectured that Marguerite gave Anne the original manuscript of Miroir de l'âme pécheresse at some point. It is certain that in 1544, nine years after Anne Boleyn's execution, that Anne's daughter, who would become Elizabeth I (1533–1603), translated the poem into English prose as The Miroir or Glasse of the Synneful Soul when she was eleven years old and presented it, written in her own hand, to her then-stepmother, the English queen Katherine Parr. This literary connection between Marguerite, Anne Boleyn, Katherine Parr, and Elizabeth suggests a direct mentoring link or legacy of reformist religious convictions. \\"Francis I and Marguerite de Navarre\\" by Richard Parkes Bonington As a generous patron of the arts, Marguerite befriended and protected many artists and writers, among them François Rabelais (1483–1553), Clément Marot (1496–1544), Claude de Bectoz (1490-1547) and Pierre de Ronsard (1524–1585). Also, Marguerite served as a mediator between Roman Catholics and Protestants (including John Calvin). Although Marguerite espoused reform within the Catholic Church, she was not a Calvinist. She did, however, do her best to protect the reformers and dissuaded Francis I from intolerant measures as long as she could. After her death, eight religious wars occurred in France, marked notably by the notorious St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre of 1572. American historian Will Durant wrote: \\"In Marguerite the Renaissance and the Reformation were for a moment one. Her influence radiated throughout France. Every free spirit looked upon her as protectoress and ideal .... Marguerite was the embodiment of charity. She would walk unescorted in the streets of Navarre, allowing any one to approach her and would listen at first hand to the sorrows of the people. She called herself 'The Prime Minister of the Poor'. Henri, her husband, King of Navarre, believed in what she was doing, even to the extent of setting up a public works system that became a model for France. Together he and Marguerite financed the education of needy students.\\" Jules Michelet (1798–1874), the most celebrated historian of his time, wrote of her: \\"Let us always remember this tender Queen of Navarre, in whose arms our people, fleeing from prison or the pyre, found safety, honor, and friendship. Our gratitude to you, Mother of our [French] Renaissance! Your hearth was that of our saints, your heart the nest of our freedom.\\" Pierre Bayle (1647–1706), French philosopher and critic, whose Dictionnaire historique et critique (Historical and Critical Dictionary, 1697) greatly influenced the French Encyclopedists and the rationalist philosophers of the eighteenth century, such as Voltaire and Diderot, esteemed her highly, writing: \\"... for a queen to grant her protection to people persecuted for opinions which she believes to be false; to open a sanctuary to them; to preserve them from the flames prepared for them; to furnish them with a subsistence; liberally to relieve the troubles and inconveniences of their exile, is an heroic magnanimity which has hardly any precedent ...\\" Clos Lucé in Amboise, France, where Leonardo da Vinci died in 1519 Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519) died while guest of Marguerite and her brother, Francis I. They had been raised at Château d'Amboise, which belonged to their mother, Louise of Savoy. The king maintained his residence there and Marguerite maintained a residence nearby. During the first few years of the reign of Francis the château in which he lived reached the pinnacle of its glory. Leonardo had been the architect of a large château for them, among many other projects, and they provided quarters for him when he left Italy and joined her court. As a guest of the king, who provided him with a comfortable stipend, Leonardo da Vinci came to Château Amboise in December 1515 and lived and worked in the nearby Clos Lucé, connected to the château by an underground passage. Tourists are told that he is buried in the Chapel of Saint-Hubert, adjoining the Château, which had been built in 1491–96.Records show that Leonardo da Vinci was buried in the church of Saint-Florentin, part of the Château Amboise. At the time of Napoleon this church was in such a ruinous state, dilapidated during the French Revolution, that the engineer appointed by Napoleon decided it was not worth preserving; it was demolished and the stonework was used to repair the château. Some sixty years later the site of Saint-Florentin was excavated: a complete skeleton was found with fragments of a stone inscription containing some of the letters of Leonardo's name. It is this collection of bones that is now in the chapel of Saint-Hubert. In 1550, one year after Marguerite's death, a tributary poem, Annae, Margaritae, Ianae, sororum virginum heroidum Anglarum, in mortem Diuae Margaritae Valesiae, Nauarrorum Reginae, Hecatodistichon, was published in England. It was written by the nieces of Jane Seymour (1505–1537), third wife of King Henry VIII.

DNA Polymerase II is an 89.9-kDa protein and is a member of the B family of DNA polymerases. It was originally isolated by Thomas Kornberg in 1970, and characterized over the next few years. The in vivo functionality of Pol II is under debate, yet consensus shows that Pol II is primarily involved as a backup enzyme in prokaryotic DNA replication. The enzyme has 5′→3′ DNA synthesis capability as well as 3′→5′ exonuclease proofreading activity. DNA Pol II interacts with multiple binding partners common with DNA Pol III in order to enhance its fidelity and processivity.  Discovery  DNA Polymerase I was the first DNA- Directed DNA polymerase to be isolated from E. coli. Several studies involving this isolated enzyme indicated that DNA pol I was most likely involved in repair replication and was not the main replicative polymerase. In order to better understand the in vivo role of DNA pol I, E. coli mutants deficient in this enzyme (termed Pol A1−) were generated in 1969 by De Lucia and Cairns. As characterized, this new mutant strain was more sensitive to ultraviolet light, corroborating the hypothesis that DNA pol I was involved in repair replication. The mutant grew at the same rate as the wild type, indicating the presence of another enzyme responsible for DNA replication. The isolation and characterization of this new polymerase involved in semiconservative DNA replication followed, in parallel studies conducted by several labs. The new polymerase was termed DNA polymerase II, and was believed to be the main replicative enzyme of E. coli for a time. DNA pol II was first crystallized by Anderson et al. in 1994. Structure  DNA Pol II is an 89.9 kD protein, composed of 783 amino acids, that is encoded by the polB (dinA) gene. A globular protein, DNA Pol II functions as a monomer, whereas many other polymerases will form complexes. There are three main sections of this monomer colloquially referred to as the palm, fingers, and thumb. This “hand” closes around a strand of DNA. The palm of the complex contains three catalytic residues that will coordinate with two divalent metal ions in order to function. DNA Pol II has a high quantity of copies in the cell, around 30-50, whereas the level of DNA Pol III in a cell is five times fewer. General \\"Hand\\" Structure of a Group B Polymerase (Based on PDB entry 3NCI) = Similarity to other group B polymerases = Most of the polymerases have been grouped into families based on similar structure and function. DNA Pol II falls into the Group B along with human DNA Pol α, δ, ϵ, and ζ. These are all homologs of RB69, 9°N-7, and Tgo. The other members of group B do have at least one other subunit which makes the DNA Pol II unique.  Function  Confirmed = Polymerases all are involved with DNA replication in some capacity, synthesizing chains of nucleic acids. DNA replication is a vital aspect of a cell's proliferation. Without replicating its DNA, a cell cannot divide and share its genetic information to progeny. In prokaryotes, like E. coli, DNA Pol III is the major polymerase involved with DNA replication. While DNA Pol II is not a major factor in chromosome replication, it has other roles to fill. DNA Pol II does participate in DNA replication. While it might not be as fast as DNA Pol III, it has some abilities that make it an effective enzyme. This enzyme has an associated 3′→5′ exonuclease activity along with primase activity. DNA Pol II is a high fidelity enzyme with a substitution error rate of ≤ 2×10−6 and a −1 frameshift error rate of ≤ 1×10−6. DNA Pol II can proofread and process mismatches caused by the Pol III. Banach-Orlowska et al. showed that DNA Pol II is involved with replication but it is strand dependent and preferentially replicates the lagging strand. A proposed mechanism suggests that when DNA Pol III stalls or becomes non-functional, then DNA Pol II is able to be specifically recruited to the replication point and continue replication. There are many different ways that DNA can be damaged, from UV damage to oxidation, so it is logical that there are different types of polymerases to fix these damages. One important role that DNA Pol II is the major polymerase for the repairing of inter-strand cross-links. Interstrand cross-links are caused by chemicals such as nitrogen mustard and psoralen which create cytotoxic lesions. Repairing these lesions is difficult because both DNA strands have been damaged by the chemical agent and thus the genetic information on both strands is incorrect. The exact mechanism of how these interstrand cross-links are fixed is still being researched, but it is known that Pol II is highly involved. = Activity = DNA Pol II is not the most studied polymerase so there are many proposed functions of this enzyme which are all likely functions but are ultimately unconfirmed: * repair of DNA damaged by UV irradiation * replication restart in UV-irradiated E. coli * adaptive mutagenesis * long-term survival Mechanism DNA Polymerase II Repair Active Site (PDB ID: 3K5M) During DNA replication, base pairs are subject to damage in the sequence. A damaged sequence of DNA can cause replication to be stalled. In order to fix an error in the sequence, DNA Pol II catalyzes the repair of nucleotide base pairs. In vitro studies have shown that Pol II occasionally interacts with Pol III accessory proteins (β‐clamp and clamp loading complex) giving the Pol II access to the growing nascent strand. Concerning the function of DNA Pol II during DNA replication, this makes sense as any mistakes that Pol III produces will be in the growing strand and not the conservative strand. The N-terminal domain of DNA Pol II is responsible for the association and dissociation of the DNA strand to the catalytic subunit. There are most likely two sites in the N-terminal domain of DNA Pol II that recognize single-stranded DNA. One site(s) is responsible for recruiting single-stranded DNA to DNA Pol II and another site(s) is responsible for the dissociation of single-stranded DNA from DNA Pol II. DNA Pol II Active Site (PDB ID 3K5M) Upon binding of substrate, DNA Pol II binds nucleoside triphosphates to maintain the hydrogen bonded structure of DNA. The correct dNTP is then bound and the enzyme complex undergoes conformational changes of subdomains and amino acid residues. These conformational changes allow the rate of repair synthesis to be fast. The active site contains two Mg2+ ions that are stabilized by catalytic Aspartic Acids D419 and D547. Magnesium ions bind to DNA along with dNTP in the open state and coordinate conformational changes of active site amino acid residues in order for catalysis to take place (closed state). After magnesium ions are released, the enzyme returns to its open state.  Species distribution  Prokaryotic = DNA Polymerase II is a member of the polymerase B family and supports Polymerase III in DNA replication moving from the 3′ end to the 5′ end. In the case when Polymerase III stalls during a replication error, Polymerase II can interrupt and excise the mismatched bases. Polymerase II has a much higher fidelity factor than Polymerase III, meaning that it is much less likely to create mispairings. Without Polymerase II's proofreading step, Polymerase III would extend the mispairings and thus create a mutation. In addition to protecting from mutations that could be caused by Polymerase III, Polymerase II functions to protect against mutations caused by Polymerase IV. Polymerase IV is much more error prone than Polymerase II but also functions to repair mismatched base pairings starting from the 3′ end. Polymerase II protects the 3′ end from Polymerase IV and blocks it from acting. This protection will prevent the formation of mutations while the Polymerase II is functioning normally. If the Polymerase II is knocked out by a mutation or disabled by other factors, Polymerase IV will take its place to fix the mispaired bases. =Eukaryotic= While Polymerase II will not function naturally in conjunction with the eukaryotic members of Family B, it does share similar structural and functional motifs. The members of Family B include Polymerase α, ε, ζ, and δ. These polymerases all function to proofread the newly synthesized DNA in the 3′→5′ direction. These polymerases are capable of synthesizing DNA on both the leading and lagging strands. This class of polymerase tends to be very accurate which allows them to correct any mispairings that occur during DNA synthesis. Regulation DNA Polymerase II is naturally abundant in the cell, which usually amounts to five times greater than the amount of Polymerase III. This greater abundance allows Polymerase II to overpower Polymerase III in the case of mispairings. This amount can be increased upon the inducement of the SOS response, which upregulates the polB gene so the amount of Polymerase II increases to about sevenfold greater. Although Polymerase II can work on both strands, it has been shown to prefer the lagging strand versus the leading strand.

The association was founded in 1940 by physicians interested in improving the quality of medical writing and editing. The current president is Cyndy Kryder, MS. AMWA includes a variety of medical communicators, including administrators, advertisers, authors' editors, college and university professors, journal editors, pharmaceutical writers (and those involved in pharmaceutical publication planning), public relations specialists, publishers, reporters, researchers, statisticians, and translators. Many members are freelance writers and editors. Membership in AMWA is open to anyone interested in any aspect of medical communication. AMWA's headquarters are located in Rockville, Maryland, United States.  History  On the evening of September 25, 1940, in the Mississippi River town of Rock Island, Illinois, Drs. Harold Swanberg, George B. Lake, N. C. Barwasser, Norman Zolla, Florence Johnson, and James Dunn organized the Mississippi Valley Medical Editors' Association (MVMEA).Fishbein, Morris; Snively, WD (July 1965). \\"Forewords to Swanberg's AMWA History\\" (PDF). American Medical Writers Association. The MVMEA was absorbed by the new AMWA, which was formed at Springfield, Ill., September 29, 1948, during the meeting of the Mississippi Valley Medical Society in that city. At this time The Mississippi Valley Medical Journal was made the official publication of AMWA. During the 1948 meeting, Morris Fishbein, M.D., then editor of The Journal of the American Medical Association, gave a two-hour course on medical writing at the meeting.Swanberg, Harold (May 2001). \\"AMWA History, 1924–1948\\" (PDF). American Medical Writers Association. Dr. Fishbein was president of AMWA, 1958–1959. Up until 1951, the constitution of AMWA was written so that only physicians could be members. The constitution adopted for 1951–1956 allowed, besides physicians, \\"medical librarians and health educators,\\" and, importantly, \\"personnel of hospitals, foundations, technical companies and allied organizations, educational institutions, publishing and who are concerned with medical writing or publishing...\\"\\"Purposes, Objectives, Membership Requirements\\" (PDF).

The MWC program is an exam-based certification designed for professional medical writers holding a bachelor or advanced degree and with at least two years of paid medical writing experience. Professionals who hold this credential have demonstrated their understanding of medical writing core competencies.  The role of professional medical writers  In 2017, AMWA collaborated with the European Medical Writers Association (EMWA) and the International Society of Medical Publication Professionals (ISMPP), to create the AMWA-EMWA-ISMPP Joint Position Statement. In summary, the statement asserts that, \\"professional medical writing support helps authors and sponsors to disclose their research in peer-review journals and scientific congresses in an ethical, accurate, and timely manner, with the ultimate aim of advancing patient care.\\" The statement describes the appropriate role of professional medical writers in the development of medical and scientific publications, including: * Articles and supplementary content (e.g., video abstracts) for publication in peer-reviewed journals * Abstracts, posters, and oral presentations for dissemination at scientific congresses\\"AMWA‒EMWA‒ISMPP Joint Position Statement on the Role of Professional Medical Writers\\" (Jan 2017). American Medical Writers Association. http://c.ymcdn.com/sites/www.amwa.org/resource/resmgr/about_amwa/JointPositionStatement.Profe.pdf Previously, AMWA published a position statement on the contributions of medical writers to scientific publications in the 2003 AMWA Journal. This article explained the work of the AMWA 2002 Task Force on the Contributions of Medical Writers to Scientific Publications as it prepared, adopted, and presented the position statement. The position statement addressed the controversy of guest authorship and the use of medical ghostwriters, particularly when pharmaceutical companies fund the research. Critics charge that the use of biomedical communicators encourages commercial bias. Advocates claim that professional biomedical communicators provide a valuable service that improves the quality and timeliness of publication of research. The debate centers around how to define authorship. In 2005, the World Association of Medical Editors tightened its policy on ghost writing of medical research papers after a US journal highlighted allegedly illegitimate ghostwriting practices. The New York Times reported on a study released by editors of The Journal of the American Medical Association that found a significant number of articles in top medical journals published in 2008 were written by ghostwriters. Cindy Hamilton (AMWA president at the time) replied to this article in a letter to the editor by stating, in part: Reuters has reported that some medical journal editors are resorting to computer forensics to help reveal ghost writers on manuscripts. Despite conflicting viewpoints on ghostwriting and guest authorship in medical communications, common ground can be found. This viewpoint was neatly summed up in the September 2009 issue of Mayo Clinic Proceedings:'  See also  *American Association for the Advancement of Science *Board of Editors in the Life Sciences (BELS) *Council of Science Editors *Editors' Association of Canada *European Association of Science Editors *European Medical Writers Association *Society for Technical Communication *Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals  References  External links  *American Medical Writers Association *Toolkit for New Medical Writers *Exploring a Career in Medical Communication: A Collection of Articles from the AMWA Journal *AMWA Position Statements *AMWA Online Learning *AMWA Essential Skills Certificate Category:Health care-related professional associations based in the United States Category:Professional titles and certifications Category:Science writing organizations Category:Organizations established in 1940 Category:Medical and health organizations based in Maryland Category:American writers' organizations AMWA Category:1948 establishments in Illinois ","title":"American Medical Writers Association"},{"id":"2764123","text":"Deportivo Pereira is a professional Colombian football team based in Pereira, that currently plays in the Categoría Primera A. They play their home games at the Hernán Ramírez Villegas stadium. History While there are several teams in the Third Division (Primera C), Pereira is the only professional team in Risaralda Department. Deportivo Pereira made its First Division debut (Primera A) in the 1949 season. Deportivo Pereira replaced Universidad, a soccer club founded in Bogotá that had played its previous season in the 'Pearl of the Otún River', nickname of the city of Pereira. =Early Years= Founded on February 12, 1944, the team played its first game at home against Universidad De Bogotá, losing 1–2. The team's first goal was scored by Ecuadorian player Humberto Suárez. Its first victory was against Atlético Bucaramanga, with a final score of 1–2, and goals scored by Omar Barahona and José “Mico” Zapata. A second victory as a visitor was obtained against Bucaramanga 3–4. The team's first victory playing at home was in October 9, 1949, beating Huracán 4–1, with goals scored by Carmelo Enrique Colombo, José \\"Mico\\" Zapata, Inocencio Paz Lasso \\"Cencio\\" and an own goal from Huracan's player Santos Isaza. The first top scorer of the \\"Matecaña\\" (another of Pereira's nicknames) team was the Colombian Inocencio Paz Lasso \\"Cencio\\", with 11 goals. The team finished the season in last place with only 14 points. Deportivo Pereira has never won a Primera A championship. The team's most successful season was in 1974, where the team got third place. =1982= Led by Gilberto Osorio, the roster included Óscar Héctor Quintabani, \\"Ratón\\" Echeverri, Víctor Longo, Henry Viáfara, Gilberto Cabrera, Farid Perchy, Sergio Cierra, Benjamin \\"Mincho\\" Cardona, Eduardo Emilio Vilarete, Jairo \\"Chiqui\\" Aguirre, and as substitutes Goalkeeper Reynel Ruiz, Midfielders Manzi and Ponciano Castro and strikers Abel Augusto Lobatón, Hernán \\"Pistolero\\" Villa and Iván Darío \\"Chumi\\" Castañeda. The team finished the tournament in 4th place. =Other highlights= In 1991, Colombia's Dimayor decided to modify the tournament so the Second Division champion would be promoted to First Division and the last team from the First Division would be demoted to Second Division. In 1995, the team got a decent sixth place that placed it comfortably far from Second Division. However, during the 1997 tournament, the team was relegated to Second Division and it had to remain in Second Division during 1998, 1999 and 2000. Led by coach Walter Aristizabal and stars like Rafael Castillo, Hernán Darío Cardona, Daniel Vélez and Jairo Serna, the team won the Second Division tournament in the year 2000, and returned to First Division. Since then, the team has reached three First Division semi-finals, and achieved fourth place during the 2003 tournament. In 2007, the team finished second to last and had to play against Academia for the Second Division's Demotion/Promotion game. Deportivo Pereira was able to keep its place in the First Division, beating Academia 4–2, thanks to striker Óscar Restrepo. By the end of 2008, and after a splendid season, the club's democratization process was started. After several months of legal processes, the team was confirmed by the División Mayor del Fútbol Colombiano (Dimayor) and the Federación Colombiana de Fútbol as Deportivo Pereira SA. On November 6, 2011, Deportivo Pereira lost its First Division status by losing 1–0 against Deportes Tolima in Ibagué. In the second tournament of 2012, Deportivo Pereira, under the leadership of coach Octavio Zambrano, achieved a record to get into the second half of the 2012 Categoría Primera B season with a total of 43 points out of 54 possible obtained in a single season, making it the first team to have achieved this number. However, the club missed the chance to return to the top flight in the semifinals.

As of the 2010 census it had a population of 948. History Founded circa 1845, the community was established at a relatively high elevation in the \\"low country\\" of South Carolina, and it gave an escape from mosquitoes and uncomfortable heat. It became a gathering place for those of means during this time. It shared this aspect with other communities throughout the plantation economy of this era. A resident spontaneously coined the name \\"Pinopolis\\" because of the many pine trees. This is probably a reflection of schooling that included references to Greek and Latin. During the pre-Civil War period it developed in this way and maintained as a place of polish and refinement. In the post-Civil War period and during the change of the South, it became the location of the first elementary school for black students. In 1939, the Santee Cooper Project dammed the Santee River, flooding nearly and creating Lake Moultrie with the Pinopolis Dam in 1946. Because of its high elevation, Pinopolis was spared from the flooding, and now exists as a peninsula on the lake. The Pinopolis Historic District North, Pinopolis Historic District South, and William Robertson House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

It is often used in an office network environment, to ensure that users do not store data locally, when a network device is the preferred storage location. Folder Redirection allows saving data regardless of storage location and separates user data from profile data decreasing the time required to log on. Other advantages include: * Data is stored on a server where it can be backed up * If the same redirection is applied to multiple users, all data is stored in the one location * Allows for sharing of data between users directly from the server rather than creating shares on individual workstations * Allows system administrators to spend less on workstation hard drives, and more on file server hard drives * If all user folders are redirected and caching is disabled, no files are stored on the workstations and thus data is better protected from theft Under Microsoft Windows, the redirection is often performed by Group Policy, when used in an Active Directory environment. It can also be performed by manually editing the Windows Registry, changing library locations, or with tools such as Tweak UI. Disk quotas can be used to limit the amount of space taken up by users' special folders. The \`%username%\` and \`%userprofile%\` environment variables can also be used with Folder Redirection. Up to Windows XP, the Application Data, Desktop, My Documents, My Pictures, and Start Menu special folders can be redirected to a file server. Windows XP also implements a Recycle Bin for the My Documents folder. Windows Vista introduces the ability to independently redirect up to 10 user profile sub-folders to a network location.Managing Roaming User Data Deployment Guide There is also a Management Console snap-in in Windows Vista to allow users to configure Folder Redirection for clients running Windows Vista, Windows XP, and Windows 2000. Each redirected folder in Vista and later also has a Recycle Bin associated with it. Under Windows 7 and later, the following user folders may be redirected: AppData/Roaming, Contacts, Desktop, Downloads, Favorites, Links, Music, Documents, Pictures, Saved Games, Searches, Start Menu, and Videos. The equivalent functionality is achieved in Unix-like systems by using \`mount\` or \`ln\` and a NFS or CIF.

It was developed by the Civilian Conservation Corps starting around July 1934. One of the projects was a huge overlook wall, built from locally quarried gabbro. The roadside development plans were drawn by Arthur R. Nichols and Harold E. Olson. The project was considered a model for roadside development. The development work was supervised and inspected not just by National Park Service employees, but also by members of the Minnesota Highway Department, staff of the Minneapolis Park Board, Civilian Conservation Corps individuals, members of the Minnesota Legislature, and some Canadian officials.

Geography The river rises approximately south of Newman and flows in a west-north-westerly direction until discharging into the Indian Ocean approximately south west of Onslow. The North West Coastal Highway crosses the river at Nanutarra. The river has a length of approximately . The river basin covers an area of and includes the towns of Paraburdoo and Tom Price.  Tributaries  Some of the larger tributaries of the Ashburton river include Beasley River, Henry River, Hardey River and Ethel river. Some of the smaller tributaries include Duck Creek, Turee Creek, Tunnel Creek, Angelo River, Stockyard Creek, Gorge Creek, Goldfields Creek, Peepingee Creek and Jubricoo Creek.  History  Caert van't Landt van d'Eendracht The Ashburton River is believed to have first been named Willem's River during the voyage of the Dutch East India Company (Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie, or VOC) ship Mauritius in 1618, under command of Supercargo Willem Janszoon, and captained by Lenaert Jacobszoon. It was one of the few features named on a nautical chart made in 1627., cited in Caert van't Landt van d'Eendracht This area was first visited by Europeans in 1618, when the crew of the ship Mauritius encountered the Western Australian coastline, and mapped a river they named Willem's River. Janszoon was the captain of the Duyfken in 1605-1606, when part of the Gulf of Carpentaria was mapped, during the earliest documented visit to Australia by a vessel from Europe. Caert van't Landt van d'Eendracht (\\"Chart of the Land of Eendracht\\") is a 1627 chart made by Hessel Gerritsz and is one of the earliest charts showing the coastline of Western Australia. The Willem River is located to the extreme left (north) end of the coastline on the chart and a closer view is provided below. Caert van't Landt van d'Eendracht, enlarged detail showing Willem River by Hessel Gerritsz, (reoriented with north to top). The chart shows Willems revier, besocht by 't volck van 't Schip Mauritius in Iulius A° 1618 (\\"Willem's River, visited by the crew of the ship Mauritius in July 1618\\"). The detail of the river’s position on the chart backs up the claim that this is the Ashburton River, which, being at 21 degrees 40 minutes south and 114 degrees 56 east, is almost exactly the latitude as shown on the chart, and given by Hessel Gerritsz as 21 degrees 45 minutes south latitude. The chart is oriented with north to the left, showing lines of latitude from 20th parallel south to the 35th parallel south at the base of the map. The lines of latitude appear to be very accurate, matching known features through the length of the chart. Other factors to back up that this is the Ashburton River is that it takes almost a 90 degree turn north-east, once in the mouth, as shown on the chart, and the northern headland of the river mouth matches closely the shape of the headland as shown on the chart. The township of Onslow was located at the mouth of the Ashburton River where a jetty was used as the town's and region's port, but once the new deep water port facility was completed at Beadon point north of the old townsite, the townsite was moved.  Fauna  The river supports a wide variety of fish including barramundi and mangrove jack. The occasional salt water crocodile is also spotted in the river. Bird species such as black swans, the striated heron, Australian bustard and bush stone-curlew can be found along the river's banks.

Mathilde Marchesi (née Graumann) (24 March 1821 – 17 November 1913) was a German mezzo-soprano, a singing teacher, and a proponent of the bel canto vocal method. Biography Marchesi was born in Frankfurt. Her father's name was Graumann; her aunt was the pianist and friend of Beethoven, Dorothea von Ertmann, née Graumann. In her adolescence her family fortunes failed, so she travelled at the age of 22 to Vienna to study voice. Thereafter she went to Paris and studied with Manuel García II, who was to have the foremost influence on her. She made her debut as a singer in 1844, and had a short career in opera and recital. Her voice, however, was only adequate, so she moved to teaching in 1849. In 1852, she married Italian baritone Salvatore Marchesi (pseudonym of Salvatore de Castrone della Rajata) (d. 1908). It was in this field that she would become famous. She taught at the conservatory in Cologne and, in the 1870s at the Vienna Conservatory, where she tutored Marie Fillunger among others. In 1881 she opened her own school on the in Paris, where she was to remain for most of her life. Ultimately, she was best known as the vocal teacher of a number of great singers. The most famous among them is perhaps Nellie Melba, but she also trained such illustrious singers as Emma Calvé, Frances Alda, Ellen Gulbranson, Selma Kurz and Emma Eames. Marchesi died in London in 1913. The mother of Joan Sutherland was taught by a pupil of Marchesi. Today, Marchesi is remembered not at all for her singing career. Rather, she is known first and foremost as the teacher of a surprising number of great singers, and also as the person who carried the bel canto technique into the 20th century. Her ideas are still studied, primarily by female singers, especially those with voices in the soprano range, in which Marchesi had specialized. Teachings Marchesi was clearly committed to the bel canto style of singing. Despite this, she did not particularly identify herself as a bel canto teacher. She asserted that there were only two styles of singing: \\"the good...and the bad\\" and argued that a properly trained vocalist could sing the old bel canto style just as easily as the then newer, more dramatic style. She was generally an advocate of a naturalistic style of singing: she called for a fairly instinctive method of breathing and argued against the \\"smiling\\" mouth position that many teachers of her day preferred. She was particularly concerned with vocal registration, calling it \\"the Alpha and Omega of the formation and development of the female voice, the touchstone of all singing methods, old and new.\\" She also repeatedly expressed disdain for the teachers of her day who offered methods that they asserted would fully develop the voice in only a year or two. Instead, she felt that vocal training was best approached at a slow and deliberate pace. Two of the most distinctive features of her teachings were her \\"analytical method\\" and her insistence on very short practice times for beginners. Her \\"analytical method\\" placed great importance on intellectually understanding both the technical and the aesthetic nature of everything sung, from grand arias to simple vocal exercises. She argued that rote practice without understanding was ultimately harmful to the artistic use of the voice.

Lyman (born September 17, 1938, in Great Falls, Montana) is an American farmer and animal rights activist known for promoting vegan nutrition and organic farming. In 1997 he was awarded the Peace Abbey Courage of Conscience Award for his leadership in the animal rights movement. Biography Lyman was raised as a fourth generation rancher on a farm that produced dairy and meat commodities. He attended Montana State University and graduated with a B.S. degree in general agriculture in 1961. Upon graduation, he spent two years in the United States Army before returning to work on the farm. From 1963 to 1983 he was actively engaged in animal and grain production. The areas in which he was involved were dairy, pork, registered Hereford, chicken, range cattle, feedlot beef production, veal, grain, silage, and hay production. In 1979 Lyman was diagnosed with a tumor in his spine. Faced with the prospect of paralysis, he vowed to return to non-chemical means of farming if he beat the cancer. He survived an operation to remove the tumor and set out to transform his land into an organic farm. He also ran for political office, but lost his first election. He then became a lobbyist, and moved to Washington, D.C. Circa 1990, again facing health concerns, he became a vegetarian and found his health improved. In 1989 Lyman had begun to investigate Mad Cow disease, which was just becoming an issue in the UK. He eventually became a vegan. In April 1996 Lyman came to national attention during an appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show. Lyman's remarks on the show led to Winfrey renouncing hamburgers. The National Cattlemen's Beef Association sued Lyman and Winfrey. Both were found not guilty in 1998.https://www.animallaw.info/case/texas-beef-group-v-winfrey While the CDC and USDA maintained that Mad Cow Disease could not occur in the US, the government of Japan did not agree.http://www.cnn.com/2004/BUSINESS/01/21/madcow.japan.reut/ Publications He has co-authored the book Mad Cowboy (1998) and co-authored No More Bull (2005) and became president of EarthSave.

Examples of reading disabilities include: developmental dyslexia, alexia (acquired dyslexia), and hyperlexia (word-reading ability well above normal for age and IQ). Definition National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke defines reading disability or dyslexia as follows: \\"Dyslexia is a brain-based type of learning disability that specifically impairs a person's ability to read. These individuals typically read at levels significantly lower than expected despite having normal intelligence. Although the disorder varies from person to person, common characteristics among people with dyslexia are difficulty with spelling, phonological processing (the manipulation of sounds), and rapid visual-verbal responding. In adults, dyslexia usually occurs after a brain injury or in the context of dementia. It can also be inherited in some families, and recent studies have identified a number of genes that may predispose an individual to developing dyslexia.\\" The NINDS definition is not in keeping with the bulk of scientific studies that conclude that there is no evidence to suggest that dyslexia and intelligence are related. Definition is more in keeping with modern research and debunked discrepancy model of dyslexia diagnosis: *Dyslexia is a learning difficulty that primarily affects the skills involved in accurate and fluent word reading and spelling. *Characteristic features of dyslexia are difficulties in phonological awareness, verbal memory and verbal processing speed. *Dyslexia occurs across the range of intellectual abilities. *It is best thought of as a continuum, not a distinct category, and there are no clear cut-off points. *Co-occurring difficulties may be seen in aspects of language, motor co- ordination, mental calculation, concentration and personal organisation, but these are not, by themselves, markers of dyslexia. *A good indication of the severity and persistence of dyslexic difficulties can be gained by examining how the individual responds or has responded to well founded intervention. Reading disabilitiesDyslexia= Dyslexia is a learning disability that manifests itself as a difficulty with word decoding and reading fluency. Comprehension may be affected as a result of difficulties with decoding, but is not a primary feature of dyslexia. It is separate and distinct from reading difficulties resulting from other causes, such as a non-neurological deficiency with vision or hearing, or from poor or inadequate reading instruction. It is estimated that dyslexia affects between 5–17% of the population. Dyslexia has been proposed to have three cognitive subtypes (auditory, visual and attentional), although individual cases of dyslexia are better explained by the underlying neuropsychological deficits and co- occurring learning disabilities (e.g. attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, math disability, etc.). Although not an intellectual disability, it is considered both a learning disability and a reading disability. Dyslexia and IQ are not interrelated, since reading and cognition develop independently in individuals who have dyslexia. \\"Nerve problems can cause damage to the control of eye muscles which can also cause diplopia.\\" (WEBMD, 2005)\\"Double Vision (Diplopia).\\" WEB MD. N.p., n.d. Web. 3 Nov. 2014. =Hyperlexia= Hyperlexic children are characterized by word-reading ability well above what would be expected given their ages and IQs. Hyperlexia can be viewed as a superability in which word recognition ability goes far above expected levels of skill. However, in spite of few problems with decoding, comprehension is poor. Some hyperlexics also have trouble understanding speech. Most or perhaps all children with hyperlexia lie on the autism spectrum. Between 5–10% of autistic children have been estimated to be hyperlexic. Remediation Remediation includes both appropriate remedial instruction and classroom accommodations.

It was named for Edward D. Taussig, a rear admiral of the United States Navy whose career spanned over 50 years. Adm. Taussig is remembered for claiming Wake Island for the United States on January 17, 1899 while commanding the gunboat and for accepting the physical relinquishment of Guam from Spain, ending 300 years of Spanish colonial rule. The ship was laid down on 30 August 1943 at Staten Island, New York, by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding & Drydock Co.; launched on 25 January 1944; sponsored by Miss Ellen M. Taussig, Adm. Taussig's granddaughter; and commissioned at the New York Navy Yard on 20 May 1944, Commander Joseph A. Robbins in command.  Initial operations  Taussig fitted out at the New York Navy Yard and conducted a five-week shakedown cruise near Bermuda before returning to New York on 13 July for post-shakedown availability. Repairs complete, she got underway on 18 August for more training — this time at Casco Bay, Maine. On 25 August, Taussig headed south from Boston and, on 1 September, transited the Panama Canal. From there, she headed north for a one- day stop at San Diego before continuing west to Pearl Harbor. After six days of training in Hawaiian waters, the warship cleared Pearl Harbor on 28 September in company with Destroyer Squadron 61 (DesRon 61) bound, via Eniwetok, for Ulithi. She entered the lagoon at Ulithi on 19 October and reported for duty with the 3rd Fleet.  World War II  Upon joining the 3rd Fleet, Taussig went to work with Task Force 38 (TF 38). For the remainder of October, the destroyer searched the area just off the Philippines for pilots downed in sweeps of the archipelago during the Leyte invasion. Early in November, she joined the screen of TF 38 itself while its planes continued to support the Leyte operation with covering strikes up and down the Philippine chain. Along with more of the same duty, December brought an added danger — frightful weather. One fatal typhoon late in 1944 swallowed three American destroyers. The December sweeps, made in preparation for the invasion of Luzon at Lingayen Gulf, continued into the first week of January 1945. On 8 January, the fast carriers began their aerial assault on the shores surrounding the South China Sea. Taussig screened the flattops while their planes attacked Japanese bases along the Chinese and Indochinese coasts and on the islands of Formosa and Okinawa as well as providing support for the Allied conquest of Luzon. During the night of 20 January, the destroyer helped shepherd TF 38 through the Balintang Channel, in the northern Philippines between Batan and Babuyan Islands, and into the Philippine Sea. On 23 January, TF 38 returned to Ulithi for a brief rest and replenishment. At midnight three days later, it became TF 58 once again when Admiral Raymond Spruance relieved Admiral William F. Halsey as commander of the Central Pacific Force. The fast carrier task force sortied from the lagoon on 10 February, and Taussig screened Task Group 58.1 (TG 58.1) as it headed north to participate in the first carrier-based aerial attack on the Japanese home islands since the Doolittle raid of April 1942. On the morning of the 16th, TF 58 arrived at a point some 125 miles (230 km) southeast of Tokyo. While Taussig and her sister destroyers screened them from enemy submarines, the carriers hurled their planes against Tokyo and other targets on Honshū. After another strike on the morning of the 17th, TF 58 steamed south to support the Iwo Jima invasion. While two of TF 58's task groups moved in to support the Iwo Jima assault on 19 February, Taussig stood off to the south to screen a refueling rendezvous between TG 30.8 and the three remaining carrier task groups. That same day, the destroyer subjected a submarine contact to an intensive depth-charge attack. Though she apparently failed to sink the boat, Taussig succeeded in her primary mission, protecting the carriers. Task Force 58 cleared the Volcano Islands on 22 February to resume the air offensive against the heart of the Japanese Empire. Bad weather precluded the carrying out of operations against Tokyo and Nagoya which had been planned for the 25th and 26th, respectively, and Taussig steamed southwest to strike Okinawa on 1 March. The following day, Taussig joined , , and Destroyer Squadron 61 in a bombardment of Okino Daito Shima. Two days later, the task force returned to Ulithi. On 14 March, Taussig exited Ulithi lagoon to accompany the fast carriers on another raid against Japan. This time the target was Kyūshū, the southernmost of the major islands which constitute Japan proper. With the invasion of Okinawa just over a fortnight away, the carriers sought to pulverize airfields from which kamikaze attacks could be launched against the invasion force. During the raids of 18 and 19 March, American planes also attacked Japanese warships at Kure and succeeded in damaging the carriers and as well as the battleship . Taussig helped splash two planes on the 18th and the next day screened TF 58 as it retired from the vicinity of Kyūshū after a devastating kamikaze attack. She defended her big sisters during the sporadic air attacks of the 20th and, after the task force reorganization of the 22d, she moved off to screen TG 58.1 during the week- long aerial assault inflicted upon Okinawa at the end of March. On 1 April, the troops stormed ashore at Okinawa to begin the concluding operation of World War II. TF 58 provided air support through the first three months of the campaign, and Taussig moved about off Okinawa screening the carrier from Japanese submarines and planes. The entire campaign was characterized by intense enemy air activity, particularly by kamikazes. On 6 April, a Nakajima Ki-43 \\"Oscar\\" dropped a bomb which barely missed Taussig. The destroyer responded with her antiaircraft battery and scored hits on the intruder, but TF 58's combat air patrol finally claimed the tally. On the night of 15 and 16 April, Taussig gunners brought down two bombers and, the following day, claimed credit for downing two suicide planes as well as for assisting in the destruction of a Yokosuka P1Y \\"Frances\\" finished off by a combat air patrol. On 21 April, she teamed up with and DesRon 61 to subject Minami Daito Shima to their guns. Taussig underway during the late 1940s or early 1950s. At the end of April, Taussig returned to Ulithi with TG 58.1 and remained there through the first week in May. On the 8th, she cleared the lagoon to take up station off Okinawa once more. She screened TG 58.1 carriers while their planes supported the ground forces on Okinawa. Taussig continued to guard against the enemy's submarines, but his planes remained the most immediate threat. On 25 May, the destroyer helped to bring down three more Japanese aircraft when her radio controllers vectored combat air patrols in to the kill. Three days later, Admiral Halsey relieved Admiral Spruance, and the 5th Fleet again became the 3d Fleet. Taussig remained with the same task group, which simply changed designation to TG 38.1. Through the first week in June, she continued to protect those carriers off Okinawa while they sent their planes against the beleaguered island's stubborn defenders and against air bases on Kyūshū. She then headed south with TF 38 and arrived at the Leyte Gulf base on 13 June to prepare for the expected invasion of the Japanese home islands. On 1 July, Taussig put to sea with TF 38 for the last series of offensive operations in World War II. For the next month and one-half, she cruised off Japan screening the carriers while their planes softened Japan for the expected invasion. Her guns spoke several times during those operations. On the night of 22 and 23 July, she made an antishipping sweep off Honshū with DesRon 61. The destroyers encountered a four-ship Japanese convoy, engaged it with guns and torpedoes, and claimed to have sunk all four enemy ships. Air operations and antishipping sweeps continued until 15 August 1945 when news of Japan's willingness to capitulate brought an end to hostilities. Taussig remained in the Far East until shortly after the formal surrender ceremony in Tokyo Bay on 2 September. In October, she returned to the United States and began repairs at Seattle. The destroyer remained there until 1 February 1946, when she sailed for a year of duty off the Chinese coast. In March 1947, Taussig returned to the west coast at San Diego, California Upon her return to the United States, she became a school ship for the General Line School at Monterey. For the next three years, the destroyer conducted cruises along the west coast familiarizing officers assigned to the school with operations at sea. In addition, she was frequently called upon to take Naval Reservists on board for training cruises.  Korean War  In 1950, her training duties ended. On 1 May, Taussig departed San Diego, bound for the western Pacific. En route, she stopped in Hawaii for a few days training and for liberty in the islands. By 1 June, though, she was again underway for Samar in the Philippines. Just 24 days later, war erupted in the Far East when North Korean troops streamed south across the 38th parallel into the Republic of Korea. Less than 48 hours later, Taussig — assigned to DesDiv 92, 7th Fleet — resumed familiar duty in the Sea of Japan screening TF 77 carriers while their planes joined South Korean ground forces in an attempt to stem the communist tide. That duty continued until the second week in July when Taussig made visits to Buckner Bay, Okinawa, and to Keelung, Taiwan, before returning to the war zone on the 11th. Over the following six months, the destroyer operated off both coasts of Korea, usually as a unit of the task group built around and . She spent the bulk of that time at sea and participated in the operations at Inchon, Pohang, and Wonsan. In late December, Taussig also assisted in the evacuation of Wonsan. Early in 1951, she returned to the west coast, underwent a three-month overhaul at the San Francisco Naval Shipyard, and conducted extensive underway training out of San Diego in preparation for her return to the war zone. On 27 August, Taussig headed back toward the western Pacific. After stops at Pearl Harbor, Midway, and Japan, she joined the United Nations Blockading and Escort Force, TF 95, off Korea on 20 September. During ensuing operations with that force until 2 October, the destroyer visited Pusan and conducted shore bombardments near the Han River and near Songjin. From 2 October to 2 November, she screened the carriers of TF 77\\\\. Between 3 and 23 November, Taussig participated in hunter-killer operations with units of the ROK Navy before heading south for a month with the Taiwan Strait Patrol. She spent Christmas in Sasebo and then rejoined TF 95 on 26 December for more than a month of operations, primarily shore bombardment and night illumination fire along Korea's western coast. Following rest and relaxation in Yokosuka, Taussig began her last tour of combat duty of the deployment on 7 February 1952. For the remainder of this assignment, she screened TF 77 while the carriers conducted air operations. On 24 April, the destroyer completed her second Korean War deployment in the Orient and headed back to the United States. Taussig returned to San Diego on 11 May and, after a month of leave and upkeep, began training operations which continued until 1 October when she entered the Mare Island Naval Shipyard for repairs. In mid-November, she returned to San Diego and, on the 20th, headed west for her third Korean War deployment. She reached Yokosuka on 22 December and, on the day after Christmas, put to sea to join the screen of TF 77\\\\. During the following six months, she alternated screening and plane guard duty for the carriers with bombardment and patrol duty with the Escort and Blockading Force as well as hunter-killer group duty and Taiwan Strait patrols.  Post Korean War  Taussig underway off Oahu, 10 May 1963. On Independence Day 1953, she headed home. By the time of the destroyer's departure from the Far East in the summer of 1953, the Korean War had wound down almost to inactivity. Over the next decade, Taussig made eight more deployments to the western Pacific. Though she continued to operate with the Korean War task organizations, her duty was increasingly modified to peacetime training and \\"show-the-flag\\" duty. Between the seventh and eight deployments, she entered the Long Beach Naval Shipyard on 22 January 1962 to begin a nine-month Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM) overhaul, which she completed on 11 October. Her eighth peacetime deployment to the Far East was from April to December 1963. Upon her return, the warship conducted operations off the west coast until October 1964.  Vietnam  On 23 October 1964, Taussig cleared San Diego harbor for another deployment to the western Pacific. She operated in the Hawaiian Islands until Christmas and then continued on to the western Pacific. On 6 January 1965, the destroyer joined a task unit built around off the coast of Japan to begin duty with the 7th Fleet. During this deployment, the warship saw her first tour of duty off the coast of Vietnam, where civil strife was growing steadily in intensity. Soon the United States would be deeply committed to bolstering the democratic forces in that Southeast Asian country against communist aggression. For the time being, however, Taussig's one short patrol at \\"Yankee Station\\" in March constituted her only Vietnam service during her ninth deployment since the Korean War. For the remainder of that deployment, she conducted normal peacetime training and patrol operations, including a tour in the Taiwan Strait Patrol. The destroyer departed the Orient on 2 May and, after a stop at Pearl Harbor, reached San Diego on 24 May. On 24 July, she entered the Long Beach Naval Shipyard to begin regular overhaul which she completed on 8 November. After a month of independent ship's exercises and holiday standdown, she commenced refresher training on 3 January 1966. On 12 February, the ship entered the Long Beach Naval Shipyard for three weeks of sonar repairs. Following further exercises and shore bombardment qualifications, the destroyer got underway from San Diego on 20 April to return to the Far East to provide naval support for the burgeoning American presence in the Republic of Vietnam. She stopped at Pearl Harbor from 26 to 28 April and then continued on her way — via Guam and the Philippines — to duty off Vietnam. She departed Subic Bay on 26 May for her first real line period of the Vietnam War. On the 27th, she was ordered to assist in a search and rescue (SAR) mission for flyers downed by Typhoon Judy. On 1 June, she took up station off the coast of Vietnam to provide naval gunfire support for operations ashore. From then until early October, Taussig alternated naval gunfire support with plane guard duty for Constellation on the southern SAR station off Vietnam. After 10 days in Subic Bay as naval gunfire support ready ship, the warship headed south on 9 October to participate in Operation \\"Swordhilt.\\" She refueled at Manus on 15 October and, on the 16th, joined ships of the Australian, New Zealand, and British navies for the 11-day exercise in which antisubmarine warfare and air defense were emphasized. Following Operation \\"Sword-hilt\\", she visited Australia. On 4 November, Commander, 7th Fleet, cut short her stay at Melbourne by ordering Taussig to assist which had run aground on Frederick Reef some 300 miles northeast of Australia. She escorted the damaged submarine into Brisbane on the 7th and sailed two days later for the United States. She stopped at Suva, Fiji, along the way and entered San Diego on the 25th. Taussig spent the following year engaged in operations out of San Diego. She conducted ASW training operations during the first two weeks of January and underwent hull repairs at Long Beach for the rest of the month. Early in February, she conducted ASW exercises with , , , and , and then entered San Diego for a tender availability from 11 to 24 February. In March, the destroyer visited Acapulco, Mexico, and returned to San Diego on the 23d. On the last day of the month, she moved to Long Beach, where she began additional hull repairs on 1 April. Those repairs were completed exactly a month later, and she returned to San Diego on 4 May. In June and July, she embarked NROTC midshipmen for their summer cruise, conducted gunnery drills at San Clemente Island, and resumed antisubmarine warfare (ASW) training with Lofberg, Chevalier, , and . She disembarked the midshipmen on 3 August and returned to San Clemente for naval gunfire support exercises with Marine Corps spotters. For the remainder of the year, she participated in various drills and exercises — primarily in ASW — along the West Coast. Early in December, she put into San Diego to make final preparations for her next deployment. On 28 December, Taussig departed San Diego in company with ASW Group 1 bound, via Hawaii, for the western Pacific. She reached Pearl Harbor on 6 January 1968 and, after a week of ASW exercises and another of rest and relaxation, got underway for Yokosuka, Japan. The destroyer never reached that port. On 23 January, units of the North Korean Navy seized the electronic reconnaissance ship , and ASW Group 1 was diverted to the Sea of Japan. Taussig and her colleagues arrived in their patrol area on 29 January, and as part of Operation Formation Star, Taussig remained on patrol station for 45 days. Taussig departed the Sea of Japan on 1 March and put into Subic Bay for upkeep three days later. The destroyer left the Philippines on the 12th to take up naval gunfire support station off Vietnam. On 14 March, she relieved off the coast of the U.S. III Corps area of South Vietnam. That evening, she fired her first round of the deployment in support of Allied forces ashore. relieved her on 1 April, and Taussig arrived in Kaohsiung on the 4th for a tender availability. Eleven days later, the warship put to sea to return to Vietnamese waters. On the 15th, she joined the screen of in the Gulf of Tonkin. After five days serving as plane guard for the carrier, Taussig parted company with the task unit and proceeded to the III Corps area of South Vietnam for three days of gunfire support duty. The destroyer rejoined ASW Group 1 on the 23d and, after a five-day visit to Hong Kong, conducted ASW exercises near the Philippines en route to \\"Yankee Station\\" in the Gulf of Tonkin, where she spent most of May plane-guarding and . On the 26th, Taussig headed for Port Swettenham, Malaysia, where she arrived on the 29th. The destroyer put to sea again on 2 June and, by the 5th, was back on station in the Gulf of Tonkin. After 12 days of plane guard duty, she pointed her bow toward Sasebo for the first leg of her journey home. On 21 June, Taussig stood out of Sasebo, formed up on Yorktown along with the rest of ASW Group 1, and headed for the California coast. On 5 July, the warship steamed into San Diego and began a six-week post-deployment standdown. She departed San Diego again on 21 August to enter the San Francisco Bay Naval Shipyard for overhaul. Her refurbishing was completed on 26 November, and Taussig departed San Francisco to return to San Diego, whence she operated for the remainder of the year. Taussig spent the first six weeks of 1969 preparing for refresher training, which she commenced on 14 February. For the ensuing six weeks, the destroyer went through a seemingly unending series of drills, inspections, exercises, and battle problems. Finally, however, Taussig passed her final examination on 28 March and settled back into routine operations out of San Diego. She departed San Diego on 4 June, in company with , , Prichett, , and . The six destroyers refueled at Pearl Harbor and continued on to Japan, arriving at Yokosuka on the 21st. Two days later, Taussig stood out for Vietnam, reaching Vung Tau on 28 June. From 29 June to 15 July, she provided gunfire support for the Allied ground forces fighting North Vietnamese and Viet Cong units in the U.S. IV Corps area of South Vietnam. From here, she headed for Kaohsiung, Taiwan, for a two-day liberty after which the destroyer steamed on to Japan. After a tender availability alongside at Sasebo, Taussig entered the Sea of Japan on 4 August to \\"ride shotgun\\" for and Halsey. On 24 August, the warship headed for Hong Kong where she arrived on the 28th. Five days later, she departed Hong Kong and returned to the gunline, this time near the U.S. I Corps area of South Vietnam. On 3 September, Taussig supported a combined United States–Korean amphibious landing about 20 miles down the coast from Da Nang. As the only gunfire support for Operation \\"Defiant Stand\\", Taussig and her crew kept up a hectic pace until 21 September when her relief arrived, and she headed for the Philippines. She completed repairs and departed Subic Bay on 2 October in company with . She did plane guard duty for the carrier in the Gulf of Tonkin until the 11th when she headed for Yokosuka.  End of service  Taussig remained in Japan from 16 to 19 October before resuming her voyage home. Forced to turn back to Yokosuka by Typhoon Ida, she set out once more on 24 October and, after stops at Midway and Pearl Harbor, reached San Diego on 7 November. Leave and upkeep took up the remainder of 1969, and installation of two new gun mounts occupied the first three months of 1970. In April, she entered the Long Beach Naval Shipyard where she received a new sonar dome. Following that, she embarked upon a vigorous training program in preparation for her deployment to the western Pacific scheduled for July. However, that deployment was cancelled, and Taussig was slated for inactivation. From August to December, her crew worked to prepare the destroyer for decommissioning. On 1 December 1970, Taussig was placed out of commission at San Diego and berthed with the San Diego Group, Pacific Reserve Fleet. On 1 September 1973, Taussig was struck from the Navy List. On 6 May 1974, she was sold to Taiwan, where she served the Taiwan Navy as Lo Yang (DD-14). There were plans for Lo Yang to become a museum ship in Taiwan around 2004, but the ship was eventually scrapped in 2013. Taussig earned six battle stars during World War II, eight battle stars during the Korean War, and six battle stars during the Vietnam War.  Rod Steiger's World War II service on Taussig  As a young man, future Hollywood actor and recipient of the 1968 Academy Award for Best Actor, Rodney Steven Steiger, served on Taussig as a \\"plank owner\\" from the time of her commissioning until May 1, 1945. Steiger advanced from seaman first class to torpedoman third class during his time on the ship. Steiger later commented: \\"I loved the Navy. I was stupid enough to think I was being heroic\\". His experiences during the war haunted him for the rest of his life, particularly the loss of Americans during the Battle of Iwo Jima, as well as the sinking of vessels by Taussig which were known to have women and children aboard. During Typhoon Cobra also known as \\"Halsey's Typhoon\\" on December 17, 1944, with winds reaching one hundred knots (115 mph) and 80 foot (24 m) waves off the coast of Luzon in the Philippines, Steiger was on deck, having secured himself with rope and flattening himself as waves engulfed the ship.

The district operates 25 elementary schools (grades Preschool–5), six middle schools (6–8); five comprehensive high schools (9–12); and one continuation high school. Twenty-one of the district's schools are located in the city of San Diego; eleven others are in the city of Poway. The district serves approximately 33,000 students in San Diego County and is the third- largest school district in the county. Poway Regional Occupation Program High school students may earn credits to meet high school graduation requirements by taking career-technical education classes offered by the Regional Occupation Program at various sites throughout the district, both after school and in the evenings. These courses are designed to provide students with the opportunity to apply academic skills, explore and prepare for careers, develop leadership skills, and ultimately to provide students with the skills necessary for a successful transition to post-secondary education and the workforce. The Regional Occupation Program is affiliated with the San Diego County Office of Education Regional Occupational Program. Students can take classes from other school districts that participate in the Regional Occupational Program. School construction and renovation In the early 2000s, schools built for 500 children had as many as 700 children attending. Poway High School, built to hold 1,500 students, had 3,100 students in attendance in the 2004–2005 school year. The oldest school building in the district was built in 1949. Many of the other school district's buildings were constructed in the mid-1970s and were nearly 30 years old. Much of the wiring, plumbing, mechanical systems, and structures had not been updated. In November 2002, voters approved the $198 million Proposition U bond measure. They approved an additional $179 million bond, Proposition C, in 2008. The money was intended to fund renovation, repairs, and construction at existing schools within the school district, including additional classrooms and electrical, plumbing, heating, and ventilation system upgrades for safety and efficiency. The money was also expected to be used to upgrade school facilities to meet current safety codes. A requirement of Propositions U and C was the establishment of the Citizens' Oversight Committee. In May 2009, committee chair Chrissa Corday, in a final community report, concluded that \\"the goals achieved under Proposition U continue to foster voter confidence in the building program, as reflected in the successful passage of Proposition C, the ballot measure passed by PUSD voters in February 2008 that provides $179 million in bond authorization.\\" Corday cited many notable accomplishments, including the demolition and reconstruction of Midland Elementary School, the district's oldest elementary school; the modernization and expansion of both Poway High School and Mt. Carmel High School, including the addition of a two- story, 81,000-square-foot classroom building at Poway High School; construction of new classrooms to replace portable buildings; upgrades to restroom facilities to comply with Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA); renovation and expansion of libraries and computer labs; complete modernization of seven of the oldest elementary schools in the district; full modernization and renovation of Twin Peaks Middle School, and full technology upgrades.Corday,Chrissa \\"Building for Success Program community report\\" Citizen's Oversight Committee, May 2009 Some voters argued that the amount to be repaid was exorbitant. When presenting the bond offerings, the district guaranteed that there would be no increases in property taxes, which would require repayment to come from non-traditional sources. County Treasurer and tax collector Dan McAllister wondered about the future economic impact. \\"It's not just this generation, or the next generation, but probably two generations down the road,\\" McAllister said of the economic impact of the bond. \\"We're not saying this is going to end up an Armageddon situation, but potentially the risks are much greater with this kind of financing than what would be a more traditional way,\\" he added.

The program is based in San Diego, California, where animals are housed and trained on an ongoing basis. NMMP animal teams have been deployed for use in combat zones, such as during the Vietnam War and the Iraq War. The program has been dogged by controversy over the treatment of the animals and speculation as to the nature of its mission and training. This has been due at least in part to the secrecy of the program, which was de- classified in the early 1990s. Since the program's inception, there have been ongoing animal welfare concerns, with many opposing the use of marine mammals in military applications, even in essentially non-combatant roles such as mine detection. The Navy cites external oversight, including ongoing monitoring, in defense of its animal care standards. History The origins of the program date back to 1960, when a Pacific white-sided dolphin was acquired for hydrodynamic studies seeking to improve torpedo performance.A Brief History of the Navy's Marine Mammal Program from the foreword to the Annotated Bibliography of Publications from the NMMP The aim was to determine whether dolphins had a sophisticated drag-reduction system, but the technology of the day failed to demonstrate that dolphins have any unusual capabilities in this respect. This research has now resumed with the benefit of modern-day technology; among the possible drag-reducing mechanisms being studied for human use are skin compliance, biopolymers, and boundary-layer heating. In 1962, the animals' intelligence, exceptional diving ability, and trainability led to the foundation of a new research program at Point Mugu, California, where a research facility was built on a sand spit between Mugu Lagoon and the ocean. The intention was to study the dolphins' senses and capabilities, such as their natural sonar and deep-diving physiology, and to determine how dolphins and sea lions might be used to perform useful tasks, such as searching for and marking objects in the water. A major accomplishment was the discovery that trained dolphins and sea lions could be reliably worked untethered in the open sea. In 1965, a Navy dolphin named Tuffy participated in the SEALAB II project off La Jolla, California, carrying tools and messages between the surface and the habitat 200 feet (60 m) below. Tuffy was also trained to locate and guide lost divers to safety. In 1967 the NMMP was classified and has since evolved into a major black budget program. The Point Mugu facility and its personnel were relocated to Point Loma in San Diego, and placed under the control of the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center San Diego. Additionally, a laboratory was established in Hawaii at the Marine Corps Air Station on Kāneohe Bay at the northern end of Mokapu Peninsula. However, in 1993, as the result of the Base Realignment and Closure process, the Hawaii lab was closed and the majority of the animals were moved to San Diego; some animals remained, as part of a program of joint research between the Navy and the University of Hawaiʻi. The program The Navy Marine Mammal Program is based in San Diego, California, as part of SSC San Diego. The animals are trained in San Diego Bay; dolphin handlers can frequently be seen on the bay, where specialized small boats are used to transport dolphins between their pens and the training areas. Other locations are sometimes used for specific research, such as San Clemente Island in the Channel Islands of California, and torpedo test ranges in Seattle and Canada. The program's stated animal activities include protecting ports and Navy assets from swimmer attack, locating and assisting in the recovery of expensive exercise and training targets, and locating potentially dangerous sea mines. There are five marine mammal teams, each trained for a specific type of mission. Each human- animal team is known in military jargon by a \\"mark\\" number (MK for short); the five teams are called \\"MK 4\\", \\"MK 5\\", \\"MK 6\\", \\"MK 7\\", and \\"MK 8\\". The MK 4, 7 and 8 teams use dolphins; MK 5 uses sea lions, and MK 6 uses both sea lions and dolphins. These teams can be deployed at 72 hours' notice by ship, aircraft, helicopter, and land vehicle to regional conflicts or staging areas around the world. NMMP dolphins, such as the one pictured here wearing a locating pinger, performed mine clearance work in the Persian Gulf during the Iraq War. =Mine hunting= Three of the marine mammal teams are trained to detect enemy sea mines, which constitute a major hazard to U.S. Navy ships.U.S. Navy Marine Mammal Mine Hunting Systems from the NMMP's home page MK 4 uses dolphins to detect and mark the location of tethered sea mines floating off the bottom, while MK 7 dolphins are trained to detect and mark the location of mines on the sea floor or buried in sediment. The MK 8 team is trained to swiftly identify safe corridors for the initial landing of troops ashore. In operations, a dolphin awaits a cue from its handler before starting to search a specific area using its natural echolocation. The dolphin reports back to its handler, giving particular responses to communicate whether a target object is detected. If a mine-like target is detected, the handler sends the dolphin to mark the location of the object by releasing a buoy, so it can be avoided by Navy vessels or neutralized by Navy divers. Mine- clearance dolphins were deployed to the Persian Gulf during the Iraq War in 2003. The Navy said these dolphins were effective in helping to detect more than 100 antiship mines and underwater booby traps from the port of Umm Qasr.Smithsonian Magazine: Uncle Sam's Dolphins — an article about the NMMP's mine-clearance work in Iraq =Force protection= MK 6 uses dolphins and sea lions as sentries to protect harbor installations and ships against unauthorized human swimmers. MK 6 was first operationally deployed with dolphins during the Vietnam War from 1965 to 1975 and in Bahrain from 1986 to 1988. When an enemy diver is detected by a dolphin, the dolphin approaches from behind and bumps a device into the back of the enemy's air tank. This device is attached to a buoy which then explodes, alerting the Navy personnel of the intruder. Sea lions carry a similar device in their mouth, but instead attach it by hand-cuffing one of the enemy's limbs. The animals depend on their superior underwater senses and swimming ability to defend against counterattacks. =Object recovery= An NMMP sea lion attaches a recovery line to a piece of test equipment during training. MK 5 is dedicated to the recovery of test equipment that is fired from ships or dropped from planes into the ocean; the team uses California sea lions to locate and attach recovery hardware to underwater objects such as practice mines. In this role they can out-perform human divers, who are restricted to short working times and limited repeat diving. This team first demonstrated its capabilities when it recovered an ASROC (anti submarine rocket) from a depth of 180 feet (50 m) in November 1970. The team has trained in the recovery of dummy victims in a simulated airplane crash. =Attack missions= The Navy says that it has never trained its marine mammals for attack missions against people or ships.U.S. Navy Marine Mammal Program Frequently Asked Questions from the NMMP's home page The Navy stated that since dolphins cannot discern the difference between enemy and friendly vessels, or divers and swimmers, this would be a haphazard means of warfare; instead, the animals are trained to detect all mines and swimmers in an area of concern, and to report back to their handlers, who then decide upon an appropriate response. Animals Bottlenose dolphins are among the species used by the Navy's Marine Mammal Program. The Navy identifies the following animal species as having been used or studied by the program at various times: { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" cellspacing=\\"12\\" style=\\"margin:auto;\\" - valign=\\"top\\" Cetaceans: * Beluga * Bottlenose dolphin * Common dolphin * Dall's porpoise * False killer whale * Orca * Pacific white-sided dolphin * Pilot whale * Risso's dolphin * Rough- toothed dolphin Pinnipeds: * California sea lion * Common seal * Elephant seal * Fur seals * Grey seal * Steller sea lion Other: * Birds * Sharks * Rays * Sea turtles } Bottlenose dolphins and California sea lions are the main animals used, and are kept at the base in San Diego. Dolphins have powerful biological sonar, unmatched by artificial sonar technology in detecting objects in the water column and on the sea floor. Sea lions lack this, but have very sensitive underwater directional hearing and exceptional vision in low-light conditions. Both of these species are trainable and capable of repetitive deep diving. As of the late 1990s, about 140 marine mammals were part of the program. Animal welfare USS Gunston Hall (LSD-44). There has been controversy related to alleged mistreatment of animals in the program, and controversy continues over the use of marine mammals for military purposes. The Navy's policy requires that only positive reinforcement techniques be used in the training of their animals, and that they be cared for in accordance with accepted standards. The NMMP says it complies strictly with United States Department of Defense requirements and federal laws regarding the proper care of the animals, including the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Animal Welfare Act. The program is listed as an accredited institution by the Association for the Accreditation of Animal Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC), whose voluntary accreditation program requires research programs to demonstrate that they meet standards of animal care beyond those required by law. As a standard targeted at laboratory animals, this accreditation requires a specific standard of general animal care, but does not set restrictions on the purposes for which the animals are used. The NMMP is also listed as a member of the Alliance of Marine Mammal Parks and Aquariums. The NMMP protocols for both care and research must be approved by an institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC). The NMMP IACUC includes non-NMMP researchers, veterinarians, and members of the community. The use of marine mammals by the Navy, even in accordance with the Navy's stated policy, continues to meet opposition. Opponents cite the inevitable stresses involved in this type of training, which is contrary to the animals' natural lifestyles, particularly regarding their confinement when not training. There is continuing controversy over the use of anti-foraging devices, such as muzzles, which prevent the dolphins from foraging for food while working. The Navy states that this is to prevent their ingesting harmful objects, but opponents say that this is done to reinforce the handlers' control over the dolphins, which is based on food rewards.European Cetacean Bycatch Campaign — a page on military dolphin use The re-integration and/or extended care of \\"retired\\" animals is also a concern. Personnel attending four dolphins during a flight aboard a C-17 Globemaster III. The field use of the animals is also an issue for some critics, partly because of the stresses involved in transportation — particularly where dolphins are transported on dry carriers — as well as stresses arising from the sudden transplantation of the animals into an unfamiliar environment. Dolphins native to areas in which NMMP dolphins are introduced can also pose a threat, since they are known to defend their territory from intruders. Other people raise the issue of hazards to the animals in their working environments. The risk of accidental detonation of a mine by an animal is of concern to some; the Navy maintains that the chances of this are minimal, because the animals are trained not to touch the mines, which in any case are specifically designed not to be detonated by marine animals. Another fear is that opposing forces, aware of mine-hunting dolphins in a given area, may shoot dolphins in the water, leading to deaths of both NMMP and native animals. In the media The NMMP has received much sensational coverage in the media, in some part because of the unusual nature of the program and the controversial concept of using intelligent marine mammals for military purposes. The NMMP was classified until the early 1990s, which also contributed to speculation about its true nature and even its proper title, with some referring to it as the Cetacean Intelligence Mission. From time to time, stories have surfaced in the media claiming that military dolphins trained for attack missions, or even equipped with weaponry, have escaped and pose a danger to the public, but the Navy has stated that its dolphins have never been trained for any kind of attack mission against ships or people. During Hurricane Katrina in 2005, there were media reports that some of the Navy's dolphins, equipped with poison dart guns and trained to attack hostile swimmers in the water, escaped when their containment area in Lake Pontchartrain was breached, posing a threat to swimmers.Armed and dangerous — Flipper the firing dolphin let loose by Katrina — story published in the Observer, September 25, 2005, about armed dolphins allegedly let loose by Hurricane Katrina However, the Navy reported that all of its dolphins were accounted for, and that its only dolphin training centre is in San Diego. During the hurricane, some dolphins did escape from the unrelated Marine Life Oceanarium in Gulfport, Mississippi, and were subsequently recaptured.Dispelling a myth of dangerous Navy dolphins — NBC News story in response to the Katrina story in the ObserverSnopes: Killer Dolphins — article on the Katrina story from the Urban Legends Reference page In fiction The concept of military dolphins has been explored in fiction, notably in the film The Day of the Dolphin (Mike Nichols, 1973) loosely based on the novel Un animal doué de la raison (A Sentient Animal, 1967) by Robert Merle. Vonda McIntyre published a short story titled \\"The End's Beginning\\" with this theme in 1976; it was later collected in the anthology Fireflood. The William Gibson short story \\"Johnny Mnemonic\\" and its film adaptation also featured a cyborg dolphin Navy veteran named \\"Jones\\" with a talent for decryption, and a heroin addiction. The TV series seaQuest DSV featured a trained dolphin, Darwin, as a member of the crew. Dolphins armed with sonar cannons were also portrayed in the popular video games Red Alert 2 and Red Alert 3. The writer David Brin's book Startide Rising is about genetically engineered dolphins crewing a spaceship.

The company also produces Almond Joy bars, in which the coconut is topped by whole almonds and the coating is milk chocolate. The two products share a common packaging/logo design, but Mounds uses a red color scheme while Almond Joy uses blue. Mounds' original slogan, \\"Indescribably Delicious\\", was created when Mounds ran a contest to come up with the best two words to sell candy. Leon Weiss, who came up with the slogan, won $10. Mounds continues to use the slogan in advertising and on the wrapper. Mounds uses a packaging and logo design similar to its sister product, with Almond Joy's blue replaced by red, and the two candies are often advertised together. The candy's 1970s ad campaign used a jingle, \\"Sometimes you feel like a nut / sometimes you don't / Almond Joy's got nuts / Mounds don't\\", written by Leon Carr. A limited-edition Mounds Island Orange candy bar was introduced in 2006 with orange-colored and orange-flavored coconut.  History  A bar broken in half Originally invented by candy maker Vincent Nitido of West Haven, Connecticut, Mounds was created in 1920 as a single piece for 5 cents. In 1929, the Peter Paul Candy Manufacturing Company purchased the line and began production. The format changed to two pieces that still sold for 5 cents, with the price rising to 10 cents after World War II. Mounds was made in milk chocolate as well. During World War II, Peter Paul was faced with severe shortages of sugar and coconut which had been shipped from the Philippines before war broke out. Rather than sacrifice quality, the company discontinued some of its lesser selling brands and concentrated production on the Mounds candy bar. Over the years, Peter Paul added several products to its line, including the Almond Joy candy bar and York Peppermint Patties. Cadbury and Peter Paul merged in 1978, and Hershey Foods purchased the company's U.S. operations in 1988.  In popular culture  In the 1985 film Back to the Future, Mounds is in exhibition for sale at the counter's desk in the 1955 fountain parlor. In Family Guy, Joe Swanson's favorite candy bar is the Mounds bar. In the episode \\"Finders Keepers\\", Joe states that he has eaten them \\"two or three times a day for the last 25 years\\". Mounds is mentioned in Philip Roth's debut novel, Goodbye, Columbus. The main character's aunt and uncle are described as \\"sharing a Mounds Bar in the cindery darkness of their alley\\". In an opening monologue on NBC's television show Saturday Night Live, comedian Louis C.K. compared his love for Mounds bars with a child molester's love for molesting children.

Rockwell was born in Colebrook, Connecticut and educated at private schools and then Yale, where he studied law, graduating in 1826. He was admitted to the bar and in 1830 commenced practice in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. He was elected a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1834 and served four years, three of them as Speaker. Rockwell was appointed commissioner of the Bank of Massachusetts from 1838 to 1840. In 1842 he successfully ran as a Whig candidate for the House of Representatives and was re-elected three times, serving from 1843 to 1851. He did not seek renomination in 1850. He was a delegate to the state constitutional convention in 1853, and was appointed to the Senate in 1854 to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Edward Everett, serving from June 3, 1854 to January 31, 1855, when his successor Henry Wilson was elected. Rockwell voted in the electoral college for the Republican candidate John C. Frémont in the presidential election of 1856. Rockwell returned to his old post of Speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1858, until his appointment to the Massachusetts Superior Court in 1859. He retired as a judge in 1886 and died May 19, 1888 in Lenox, Massachusetts, where he is buried.

Note that in fields that commonly deal with groundwater chemistry, arsenite is used generically to identify soluble AsIII anions. IUPAC have recommended that arsenite compounds are to be named as arsenate(III), for example ortho-arsenite is called trioxidoarsenate(III). Ortho-arsenite contrasts to the corresponding anions of the lighter members of group 15, phosphite which has the structure and nitrite, which is bent. A number of different arsenite anions are known: * ortho-arsenite, an ion of arsenous acid, with a pyramidal shape * meta- arsenite, a polymeric chain anion. * pyro-arsenite, O2As–O–AsO2 * a polyarsenite, [O2As–O–As(O)–O–AsO2] * a polyarsenite, [O2As–O–As(O)–O–As(O)–O–AsO2] *, a polymeric anion In all of these the geometry around the AsIII centers are approximately trigonal, the lone pair on the arsenic atom is stereochemically active. Well known examples of arsenites include sodium meta-arsenite which contains a polymeric linear anion, , and silver ortho-arsenite, Ag3AsO3, which contains the trigonal anion. Preparation of arsenites Some arsenite salts can be prepared from an aqueous solution of As2O3. Examples of these are the meta-arsenite salts and at low temperature, hydrogen arsenite salts can be prepared, such as Na2(H2As4O8), NaAsO2·4H2O, Na2(HAsO3)·5H2O and Na5(HAsO3)(AsO3)·12H2O Arsenite minerals A number of minerals contain arsenite anions: reinerite, Zn3(AsO3)2; finnemanite, Pb5Cl(AsO3)3; paulmooreite, Pb2As2O5; stenhuggarite, CaFeSbAs2O7 (contains a complex polymeric anion); schneiderhöhnite, FeFe(As2O5)2AsO3;Hawthorne, Frank C. \\"Schneiderhoehnite, , a densely packed arsenite structure.\\" The Canadian Mineralogist 23.4 (1985): 675–679. magnussonite, Mn5(OH)(AsO3)3; trippkeite, CuAs2O4; trigonite, Pb3Mn(AsO3)2(HAsO3); tooeleite, Fe6(AsO3)4SO4(OH)4·4H2O. Arsenites in the environment Arsenic can enter groundwater due to naturally occurring arsenic at deeper levels or from mine workings. Arsenic(III) can be removed from water by a number of methods, oxidation of AsIII to AsV for example with chlorine followed by coagulation with for example iron(III) sulfate. Other methods include ion-exchange and filtration. Filtration is only effective if arsenic is present as particulates, if the arsenite is in solution it passes through the filtration membrane.EPA, United states Environmental Protection Agency, Report 815R00012, \\"Technologies and Costs for the Removal of Arsenic From Drinking Water\\", December 2000 http://water.epa.gov/drink/info/arsenic/upload/2005_11_10_arsenic_treatments_and_costs.pdf Uses Sodium arsenite is used in the water gas shift reaction to remove carbon dioxide.

Naidu, Csiro Publishing, 2006, as a solution of potassium meta- arsenite, KAsO2. Bacteria using and generating arsenite Some species of bacteria obtain their energy by oxidizing various fuels while reducing arsenates to form arsenites. The enzymes involved are known as arsenate reductases. In 2008, bacteria were discovered that employ a version of photosynthesis with arsenites as electron donors, producing arsenates (just like ordinary photosynthesis uses water as electron donor, producing molecular oxygen). The researchers conjectured that historically these photosynthesizing organisms produced the arsenates that allowed the arsenate-reducing bacteria to thrive.\\"Arsenic-loving bacteria rewrite photosynthesis rules\\", Chemistry World, 15 August 2008 In humans, arsenite inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH complex) in the pyruvate–acetyl CoA reaction, by binding to the –SH group of lipoamide, a participant coenzyme. It also inhibits the oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex by the same mechanism. The inhibition of these enzymes disrupts energy production.

It exploits differences in the refractive index of different materials to differentiate between structures under analysis. In conventional light microscopy, phase contrast can be employed to distinguish between structures of similar transparency, and to examine crystals on the basis of their double refraction. This has uses in biological, medical and geological science. In X-ray tomography, the same physical principles can be used to increase image contrast by highlighting small details of differing refractive index within structures that are otherwise uniform. In transmission electron microscopy (TEM), phase contrast enables very high resolution (HR) imaging, making it possible to distinguish features a few Angstrom apart (at this point highest resolution is 40 pm). Light microscopy See also: Phase contrast microscopy and Quantitative phase contrast microscopy Phase contrast takes advantage of the fact that different structures have different refractive indices, and either bend, refract or delay the light passage through the sample by different amounts. The changes in the light passage result in waves being 'out of phase' with others. This effect can be transformed by phase contrast microscopes into amplitude differences that are observable in the eyepieces and are depicted effectively as darker or brighter areas of the resultant image. Phase contrast is used extensively in optical microscopy, in both biological and geological sciences. In biology, it is employed in viewing unstained biological samples, making it possible to distinguish between structures that are of similar transparency or refractive indices. In geology, phase contrast is exploited to highlight differences between mineral crystals cut to a standardised thin section (usually 30 μm) and mounted under a light microscope. Crystalline materials are capable of exhibiting double refraction, in which light rays entering a crystal are split into two beams that may exhibit different refractive indices, depending on the angle at which they enter the crystal. The phase contrast between the two rays can be detected with the human eye using particular optical filters. As the exact nature of the double refraction varies for different crystal structures, phase contrast aids in the identification of minerals. X-ray imaging X-ray phase-contrast image of spider There are four main techniques for X-ray phase-contrast imaging, which use different principles to convert phase variations in the X-rays emerging from the object into intensity variations at an X-ray detector. Propagation-based phase contrast uses free-space propagation to get edge enhancement, Talbot and polychromatic far-field interferometry uses a set of diffraction gratings to measure the derivative of the phase, refraction- enhanced imaging uses an analyzer crystal also for differential measurement, and x-ray interferometry uses a crystal interferometer to measure the phase directly. The advantage of these methods compared to normal absorption- contrast X-ray imaging is higher contrast that makes it possible to see smaller details. One disadvantage is that these methods require more sophisticated equipment, such as synchrotron or microfocus X-ray sources, x-ray optics, and high resolution X-ray detectors. This sophisticated equipment provides the sensitivity required to differentiate between small variations in the refractive index of X-rays passing through different media. The refractive index is normally smaller than 1 with a difference from 1 between and . All of these methods produce images that can be used to calculate the projections (integrals) of the refractive index in the imaging direction. For propagation-based phase contrast there are phase-retrieval algorithms, for Talbot interferometry and refraction-enhanced imaging the image is integrated in the proper direction, and for X-ray interferometry phase unwrapping is performed. For this reason they are well suited for tomography, i.e. reconstruction of a 3D-map of the refractive index of the object from many images at slightly different angles. For X-ray radiation the difference from 1 of the refractive index is essentially proportional to the density of the material. Synchrotron X-ray tomography can employ phase contrast imaging to enable imaging of the interior surfaces of objects. In this context, phase contrast imaging is used to enhance the contrast that would normally be possible from conventional radiographic imaging. A difference in the refractive index between a detail and its surroundings causes a phase shift between the light wave that travels through the detail and that which travels outside the detail. An interference pattern results, marking out the detail.\\"Phase Contrast Imaging\\", UCL Department of Medical Physics and Bioengineering Radiation Physics Group, http://www.medphys.ucl.ac.uk/research/acadradphys/researchactivities/pci.htm accessed online 2011-07-19 This method has been used to image Precambrian metazoan embryos from the Doushantuo Formation in China, allowing the internal structure of delicate microfossils to be imaged without destroying the original specimen.Chen et al. (2009) Phase contrast synchrotron X-ray microtomography of Ediacaran (Doushantuo) metazoan microfossils: Phylogenetic diversity and evolutionary implications. Precambrian Research, Volume 173, Issues 1-4, September 2009, Pages 191-200 Transmission electron microscopy In the field of transmission electron microscopy, phase-contrast imaging may be employed to image columns of individual atoms. This ability arises from the fact that the atoms in a material diffract electrons as the electrons pass through them (the relative phases of the electrons change upon transmission through the sample), causing diffraction contrast in addition to the already present contrast in the transmitted beam. Phase-contrast imaging is the highest resolution imaging technique ever developed, and can allow for resolutions of less than one angstrom (less than 0.1 nanometres). It thus enables the direct viewing of columns of atoms in a crystalline material. The interpretation of phase-contrast images is not a straightforward task. Deconvolving the contrast seen in an HR image to determine which features are due to which atoms in the material can rarely, if ever, be done by eye. Instead, because the combination of contrasts due to multiple diffracting elements and planes and the transmitted beam is complex, computer simulations are used to determine what sort of contrast different structures may produce in a phase-contrast image. Thus, a reasonable amount of information about the sample needs to be understood before a phase contrast image can be properly interpreted, such as a conjecture as to what crystal structure the material has. Phase-contrast images are formed by removing the objective aperture entirely or by using a very large objective aperture. This ensures that not only the transmitted beam, but also the diffracted ones are allowed to contribute to the image. Instruments that are specifically designed for phase- contrast imaging are often called HRTEMs (high resolution transmission electron microscopes), and differ from analytical TEMs mainly in the design of the electron beam column. Whereas analytical TEMs employ additional detectors attached to the column for spectroscopic measurements, HRTEMs have little or no additional attachments so as to ensure a uniform electromagnetic environment all the way down the column for each beam leaving the sample (transmitted and diffracted). Because phase-contrast imaging relies on differences in phase between electrons leaving the sample, any additional phase shifts that occur between the sample and the viewing screen can make the image impossible to interpret. Thus, a very low degree of lens aberration is also a requirement for HRTEMs, and advances in spherical aberration (Cs) correction have enabled a new generation of HRTEMs to reach resolutions once thought impossible.

Course The Verdigris is formed near Madison, Kansas, by the convergence of two short headwaters streams, its North and South forks, and flows generally southward throughout its course. South of Coffeyville, Kansas, the river enters Oklahoma. It joins the Arkansas River near Muskogee, Oklahoma, about a mile upstream of the mouth of the Neosho River. The area of convergence of the three rivers Arkansas, Verdigris and Neosho is called \\"Three Forks\\". History The river is mentioned in accounts by Zebulon Pike (1806), Thomas Nuttall (1818). Fur traders had numerous posts along its route where they met with Native Americans to exchange goods for furs. The river is also mentioned in the novel Little House on the Prairie (1935) by Laura Ingalls Wilder, of her memories when her family moved to Kansas from Wisconsin. The name is derived from the Spanish words verde, meaning \\"green,\\" and gris, meaning \\"grey.\\" According to the Encyclopædia Britannica, the name may be derived from a gray-green substance resembling a copper ore, which tinged the water.Britannica Online Encyclopaedia. \\"Verdigris River.\\" Accessed September 4, 2011.

He served as a Senator for Victoria from 1935 to 1947, having previously been a member of the House of Representatives from 1917 to 1919 and the Victorian Legislative Assembly from 1913 to 1917. Early life Leckie was born at Alexandra, Victoria and educated at Scotch College, Melbourne. He played Australian rules football for Fitzroy Football Club (then in the Victorian Football Association) in 1895. He studied medicine at the University of Melbourne for two years, but after falling out with his father he prospected for gold in Kalgoorlie, Western Australia and played football in Fremantle. In 1897, he returned to Alexandra to run the family store, his father having died. In April 1898, he married May Beatrix Johnston. His wife died in 1910 and he moved to Melbourne in 1912 and co-founded a firm of lithographic printers and canister manufacturers. He married Hattie Martha Knight in April 1917. In 1920, the eldest of his daughters from his first marriage, Pattie Maie married future Prime Minister Robert Menzies.  Political career Victorian politics= Leckie was a member of the Alexandra Shire Council from 1900 to 1911 and was shire president in 1904–05. During his council service, he ran unsuccessfully for the Anti-Socialist Protectionists for the House of Representatives seat of Mernda at the 1906 election. After leaving local government in 1911, he was elected as member for Benambra in the Victorian Legislative Assembly in 1913 as a Commonwealth Liberal Party candidate. =Federal politics= Leckie won the federal seat of Indi in the 1917 election for the Nationalist Party. He lost his seat at the 1919 election to a Victorian Farmers' Union candidate. He ran unsuccessfully for the state seat of Upper Goulburn in 1921 and then concentrated on his business and business groups. At the 1934 election, Leckie was elected Senator for Victoria as a member of the United Australia Party. In October 1940, he became Minister without portfolio assisting the Minister for Trade and Customs and Minister without portfolio assisting the Minister for Labour and National Service in his son-in-law's ministry. In June 1941, he became Minister for Aircraft Production and held that position until the defeat of the Fadden government in October 1941. During the UAP's term in opposition, he was deputy leader of the party in the Senate. He lost his bid to be re-elected at the 1946 election and served out his term ending in June 1947. Three months later, Leckie died of cancer at his home in the Melbourne suburb of Hawthorn, survived by his wife and their son and by three daughters from his first marriage. His son Roland Leckie was the member for the state seat of Evelyn from 1950 to 1952 and later a crown prosecutor and a judge of the County Court.

Each 18-24 boarders will be assigned with a cluster mentor, who provides a link between boarding school and parents and who is concerned with all aspects of his/her education, personal development and welfare.  Boarding complex and facilities Designed by architect Kenzo Tange, the complex consists of seven 6-storey blocks (Hall A - Hall G) providing accommodation for up to 1,000 boarders or guests. Halls A, B and C each has five residential levels (six for Hall E, F and G), in which each level is separated into left and right clusters, while Halls E, F and G each has six residential levels. Halls E, F, and G are also connected with walkways. Each cluster is supervised by a cluster mentor, who act as guardians to the students living there. Integrated Boarding Programme Besides scholars, all secondary 3 and 4 students of Hwa Chong Institution (High School) are given an opportunity to board in the boarding school for one term (at a time). Students may choose to continue boarding after their term has ended. As of 2014, it has been increased to 2 terms.

In this framework, a stream is a chain of coroutines that pass messages between a program and a device driver (or between a pair of programs). STREAMS originated in Version 8 Research Unix, as Streams (not capitalized). STREAMS's design is a modular architecture for implementing full-duplex I/O between kernel and device drivers. Its most frequent uses have been in developing terminal I/O (line discipline) and networking subsystems. In System V Release 4, the entire terminal interface was reimplemented using STREAMS. An important concept in STREAMS is the ability to push drivers custom code modules which can modify the functionality of a network interface or other device together to form a stack. Several of these drivers can be chained together in order.  History  STREAMS was based on the Streams I/O subsystem introduced in the Eighth Edition Research Unix (V8) by Dennis Ritchie, where it was used for the terminal I/O subsystem and the Internet protocol suite. This version, not yet called STREAMS in capitals, fit the new functionality under the existing device I/O system calls (open, close, read, write, and ioctl), and its application was limited to terminal I/O and protocols providing pipe-like I/O semantics. This I/O system was ported to System V Release 3 by Robert Israel, Gil McGrath, Dave Olander, Her-Daw Che, and Maury Bach as part of a wider framework intended to support a variety of transport protocols, including TCP, ISO Class 4 transport, SNA LU 6.2, and the AT&T; NPACK protocol (used in RFS). It was first released with the Network Support Utilities (NSU) package of UNIX System V Release 3. This port added the putmsg, getmsg, and poll system calls, which are nearly equivalent in purpose to the send, recv, and select calls from Berkeley sockets. The putmsg and getmsg system calls were originally called send and recv, but were renamed to avoid namespace conflict. In System V Release 4, STREAMS was extended and used for the terminal I/O framework and pipes, providing useful new functionality like bidirectional pipes and file descriptor passing. A port for Unicos was also produced. Eric S. Raymond quotes Ritchie as saying about the complexity of System V STREAMS when compared to his V8 Streams that \\"Streams means something different when shouted\\". Concurrent with the System V Release 3 port, AT&T; developed protocol-independent STREAMS message passing guidelines for the link, network, and transport layers of the OSI model (layers 2-4). Due to the typically close implementation coupling of the network and transport protocols in a given protocol stack, and the typical practice of implementing layers 5-7 outside of the kernel, only the link and transport layer STREAMS service interfaces were later standardized by X/Open. In conjunction with the transport message passing model, the Transport Layer Interface (later adopted as the X/Open Transport Interface) was defined to provide a transport protocol-independent API for application development. Also, a library supporting the session, presentation and application layers was defined and later standardized by The Open Group. STREAMS was required for conformance with the Single UNIX Specification versions 1 (UNIX 95) and 2 (UNIX 98), but as a result of the refusal of the BSD and Linux developers to provide STREAMS, was marked as optional for POSIX compliance by the Austin Group in version 3 (UNIX 03). POSIX.1-2008 with TC1 (IEEE Std 1003.1, 2013 edition) has designated STREAMS as 'marked obsolescent' meaning that said functionality may be removed in a future version of the specification. However, the specific definition of 'obsolescent' used also says that strictly conforming POSIX applications 'shall not use obsolescent features'.  Technical overview  Example use of Streams to implement remote command execution over a network, after In Version 7 Unix, a command was connected to a terminal (keyboard and screen, or keyboard and printer) through a mechanism called the line discipline, which would buffer a single line of input, i.e., wait for the user to press the Return key before sending input to the program for processing; this allowed simple error correction. Streams replaced this with a set of processing modules organized in a linear chain that allowed bidirectional communication between neighboring modules. Programs could \\"push\\" a new module onto one end of the chain to change the behavior of a terminal or other character device. Ritchie gives the example chain of a terminal module chained with a Datakit network module to achieve remote login over a network. Aside from characters (bytes) going from program to device and vice versa, Streams could carry control messages such as \\"hangup\\" (drop connection) and ioctl messages. Streams could also be used for inter-process communication, by connecting two processes to pseudoterminals. This functionality was implemented in the mpx window system for the Blit graphics terminal, which could display multiple terminal emulator windows. Each window was a process that communicated with the window system through a pseudoterminal that had the line discipline driver installed, sending typed characters to it and receiving text (and graphics) to display. Control signals designated the user's wish to switch between windows or close them. The actual Streams modules live in kernel space on Unix, and are installed (pushed) and removed (popped) by the ioctl system call. For example, to install the aforementioned line discipline on a file descriptor \`fd\` referring to a terminal device, one would write (in C): ioctl(fd, PUSH, TTYLD); To perform input/output on a stream, one either uses the \`read\` and \`write\` system calls as with regular file descriptors, or a set of STREAMS-specific functions to send control messages.See: , and . Ritchie admitted to regretting having to implement Streams in the kernel, rather than as processes, but felt compelled to do so for reasons of efficiency. A later Plan 9 implementation did implement modules as user-level processes.  Implementations  STREAMS has mostly been used in the System V Unix world; however, other implementations exist: * Plan 9 originally used a multi-processor variant of Research Unix's Streams. During the transition to the third edition of Plan 9, Streams were further simplified to simple I/O queues. * An implementation written at Mentat was used in Novell NetWare for its TCP/IP stack, and licensed by Apple for use in the classic Mac OS starting in version 7.5.2, as part of the Open Transport networking system. (In macOS, the Classic Environment used the STREAMS architecture, but the native networking architecture uses the Berkeley sockets API and is derived from the BSD networking code.) * FreeBSD has basic support for STREAMS-related system calls, as required by SVR4 binary compatibility layer. * The Windows NT kernel offered a full port of STREAMS as the streams.sys binary. NT DDK even had a chapter on STREAMS, going as late as NT4 though in NT4 DDK it was declared obsolete. The original TCP/IP stack for Windows NT 3.1 was implemented atop STREAMS by Spider Systems, and used the streams.sys binary. From NT 3.5 up, TCP/IP was remade completely, by adopting the one from Microsoft LAN Manager for OS/2 1.x. Linux does not include STREAMS functionality without third-party add-ons. Caldera had \\"pushed\\" for STREAMS to be included in Linux ca. 1998, to support its Netware for Linux, but it was rejected outright by the Linux kernel developers on technical grounds (mainly performance). The compatibility layers in Linux for other operating systems convert STREAMS operations into sockets as early as possible.Alan Cox, Streams and Linux, Linux Kernel Mailing List, 28 June 1998 The implementation used by Caldera was \\"LiS\\", by a company called GCOM; it later figured in the legal battles by Caldera's successor, the SCO Group, against Linux, with SCO claiming that Linux with STREAMS infringed what it believed to be its copyrights to System V.

Her work focuses on the issues of feminism and gender roles within a Latin American context. It has been praised by a number of writers, including Carlos Fuentes, Alma Guillermoprieto, Roberto Bolaño and Elena Poniatowska, as well as publications such as Publishers Weekly. Early life Boullosa was born on September 4, 1954 in Mexico City, Mexico. Career Boullosa has published eighteen novels. Though all different from one another, on theme and form, Boullosa's style has a distinctive personality. One of her novels, Son vacas, somos puercos (1991, translated into English in 1997 as They're Cows, We're Pigs) is narrated in the first person by an old man looking back on his life. He was kidnapped and sent from his native France on a slave ship to the West Indies at the age of thirteen. To gain his freedom, he joins a group of pirates (or \\"pigs\\"), allowing Boullosa to compare two very different societal and political systems-- traditional Europe and carefree pirates. In La milagrosa, a novel written in 1993, the protagonist is a girl who has the power to heal the sick and perform other miracles while she sleeps. She falls in love with Aurelio Jimenez, a detective sent to discredit her, even though she fears that her powers will disappear if she spends time with people. It ends ambiguously, leaving an unsolved murder without closure. Duerme, another popular work published in 1995, tells the story of Claire, a French woman whose mother was a prostitute. Attempting to escape the same profession, she arrives in Spain dressed as a man. To save a subject of the Spanish king, she reveals herself as a female and prepares to take his punishment of death by hanging. Beforehand, however, she is wounded in the left breast and her blood is replaced by water from the lakes of Mexico City. The water's magical powers make it possible for her to survive the punishment. Boullosa is also well known for her Teatro herético (1987), a compilation of three parodies in play format--Aura y las once mil vírgenes, Cocinar hombres, and Propusieron a María. The first tells the story of a man called by God to \\"deflower\\" eleven thousand virgins in his life, so that heaven's overpopulation problem might be addressed, since the women will have to wait in purgatory for a time. The man then uses his sexual encounters as material for his television commercials and becomes a successful advertising agent. Cocinar hombres tells the story of two girls who find themselves to have become young adult witches overnight, so as to fly over the earth tempting but not satisfying men. Finally, the third play satirically recounts the conversation between Joseph and Mary before Mary gives birth to Jesus and ascends to heaven. Personal life Boullosa has two children, Juan Aura and actress María Aura, with her former partner, Alejandro Aura. She is now married to author Mike Wallace.

It lies east of Hoseason Island, south of Deception Island in the South Shetland Islands, and north-northwest of Cape Andreas on the Antarctic Peninsula. The island was named by Otto Nordenskiöld, leader of the 1901-1904 Swedish Antarctic Expedition (SAE) in commemoration of Edward Bransfield's \\"Trinity Land\\" of 1820. History Trinity Island, or the adjoining Davis Coast stretch of the Antarctic Peninsula, may have been the first part of Antarctica spotted by Nathaniel Palmer, on 16 November 1820. He was an American sealer, exploring southwards from Cape Horn in his little sloop searching for seal rookeries. The whole archipelago was named in his honour in 1897 by Adrien de Gerlache, leader of the Belgian Antarctic Expedition. Geography Trinity Island is one of the most northerly of the islands of the Palmer Archipelago, a chain of more than fifty islands running parallel with the coast of the Antarctic Peninsula. It is about long and wide, with an irregular shape and coastline that encompasses many points, capes, bays, coves, and other subordinate features. Many of these geographic features have been charted and named by various Antarctic expeditions, as well as the nations of Argentina and Bulgaria. Trinity Island is separated from Tower Island to the east by Gilbert Strait. Both islands are separated from the Davis Coast to the south by Orléans Strait, running northeast–southwest. To the southwest, Chayka Passage separates Trinity Island from Spert Island by just . = Northern portion = Cape Wollaston marks the island's northwest extremity. The name was originally applied by the 1828-1831 British Chanticleer expedition for William H. Wollaston, commissioner of the Royal Society from 1818–28. To the east along the north coast is Lorna Cove, wide, with ice-covered Albatros Point marking its eastern shore. Both features were named for Bulgarian fishing trawlers from the Ocean Fisheries company. Continuing east, Cape Neumayer forms the northeast end of Trinity Island. It was charted by the SAE and named after German geophysicist Georg B. von Neumayer. On the west coast, Preker Point sits to the southwest of Cape Wollaston. It is named for a mountain in the Balkan Mountains. It marks the northern point of Saldobisa Cove, which is wide, and was named for an ancient Thracian settlement in northern Bulgaria. Burya Point, formed by an offshoot of Ketripor Hill, divides Saldobisa from Olusha Cove to the south. It was named for Burya, a village in Bulgaria. Olusha Cove, named for a Bulgarian fishing trawler, is wide and marked to the south by Consecuencia Point. Continuing south down the west coast, just north of Lyon Peak, sits Milburn Bay, fed by Pastra Glacier. The bay was shown on an Argentine government chart of 1952 and named by the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee (UKAPC) in 1960 for M. R. Milburn, an air traffic control officer of the Falkland Islands and Dependencies Aerial Survey Expedition (FIDASE), which photographed this area in the period 1955–57. = Southern portion = Gentoo penguins at Mikkelsen Harbor, Trinity Island Towards the southern end of the west coast is Krivina Bay, a -wide bay that indents the coast to a depth of . Three small, rocky islands lie in the northern part of the bay. Northernmost is Imelin Island, long by wide. Dink Island lies to the south. It is long by wide, and lies north of Rogulyat Island, which is the southernmost of the three. Rogulyat Island is long by wide. The bay and its islands are named for locations in Bulgaria: the villages of Dink, Krivina, and Rogulyat, and Imelin Cave. On the southwest side of the island is Belimel Bay, a -wide bay that indents the coast to a depth of . It is named for Belimel in northwestern Bulgaria. The bay is defined on the north by Spert Island and to the south by Asencio Point. The point is named for Alferez de Navío Salvador Asencio of the Uruguay. Tizoin Point, named for a cave in Bulgaria, projects southwards into the middle of the bay. On the east side of the southern portion of the island, northeast of Borge Point, Awl Point projects a short distance from the shore. Awl Point was shown on an Argentine government chart of 1952, and named by the UKAPC in 1960 because the point is low in elevation but very sharply pointed in plan, suggesting an awl. The southernmost point of the island is called Skottsberg Point, which marks the west side of Mikkelsen Harbor, the most prominent feature on the southern half of the island. = Offshore features = The Hydrodist Rocks lie off the west coast of Trinity Island. They were first fixed in January 1964 by by means of a helicopter-borne hydrodist. Judas Rock lies west of the southwest end of the island. First shown on an Argentine government chart of 1950, UKAPC named it in 1960 after Judas Iscariot because the rock marks the southern extremity of a hazardous shoal area which extends northward from it for in an otherwise clear passage.  Important Bird Areas  A site comprising a rocky headland rising to above sea level, at the south- western extremity of the island, has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports a breeding colony of about 200 pairs of imperial shags. Chinstrap penguins also nest at the site. Cape Wollaston, at the northwest extremity of the island, has also been designated an IBA because it supports a large breeding colony of about 10,000 pairs of southern fulmars. The site comprises the ice-free land of the cape. It has an elevation of about 250 m.

Khan was born into a classical musical family and has performed internationally since the 1960s. He was awarded India's second highest civilian honour Padma Vibhushan in 2001. Career and recognition Khan first performed in the United States in 1963 and continued into the 2000s, with his sons. He has experimented with modifications to his instrument throughout his career. Khan played with the Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra and worked as a visiting professor at the University of New Mexico. In 2011, he performed on Carrie Newcomer's album Everything is Everywhere. In 2014, along with his two sons, Ayaan Ali Khan and Amaan Ali Khan, he performed 'Raga For Peace' in 2014 Nobel Peace Prize Concert. Khan was awarded 21st Rajiv Gandhi National Sadbhavna Award. Khan received Padma Shri in 1975, Padma Bhushan in 1991, and Padma Vibhushan in 2001, and was awarded the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award for 1989 and the Sangeet Natak Akademi Fellowship for 2011. He was awarded the Fukuoka Asian Culture Prize in 2004. The U.S. state Massachusetts proclaimed 20 April as Amjad Ali Khan Day in 1984. Khan was made an honorary citizen of Houston, Texas, and Nashville, Tennessee, in 1997, and of Tulsa, Oklahoma, in 2007. He received the Banga-Vibhushan in 2011. A Gulzar directed documentary on Amjad Ali Khan won the Filmfare award in 1990. Personal life Amjad Ali Khan Ustad Amjad Ali Khan performing at the IGNCA, Delhi. Born on 9 October 1945 as Masoom Ali Khan, the youngest of seven children, to Gwalior court musician Hafiz Ali Khan and Rahat Jahan. His family is part of the Bangash lineage and Khan is in the sixth generation of musicians; his family claims to have invented the sarod. His personal name was changed by a sadhu to Amjad. Khan received homeschooling and studied music under his father. In 1957, a cultural organization in Delhi appointed Hafiz Ali Khan as its guest and the family moved to Delhi. Hafiz Ali Khan received training from the descendants of Tansen, the magical musician, was one of the 'Nav-ratna' ( nine gems) at the court of the Mughal Emperor Akbar. Thus, Amjad belongs to the lineage of Tansen. Friends of Hafiz Ali Khan convinced him of the importance of formal schooling for his son; as a result, Amjad was taken to meet the Principal of Modern School in New Delhi and admitted there as a day scholar. He attended Modern School from 1958 to 1963. As a young bachelor, Amjad had an affair with an older woman, who was a divorcée and a mother. The affair lasted eight years (1967–75), but the lady did not wish to marry him. Amjad's family disapproved of the relationship from the very beginning, and in the early 1970s, as his father's health deteriorated, they convinced him to let go of this relationship and marry a girl chosen by them. Amjad finally agreed to their wishes around the time of his father's death in 1972. However, although his wife came from similar background and was the same age as he, Amjad did not bond with her. On the other hand, he kept in touch with his previous lover and maintained a platonic friendship with her, which was not acceptable to his wife. Hardly a year after their wedding, Amjad and his wife had a daughter. However, the marriage broke down completely around the time of the birth of the child. The process of separation and divorce was painful for the couple and to their families. An unexpected outcome was that the process of divorce was that, Amjad overcame his attachment to the divorced woman, due to differences in their thinking and mindset and gave him a clearer understanding of his cultural moorings and priorities. He came out of the relationships with the divorced woman in 1975, and divorced his wife the same year. The daughter born of this first marriage was raised by Amjad's brother, Rehmat Ali Khan, who was childless. The following year, on 25 September 1976, Khan got married a second time. His bride was Bharatanatyam dancer Subhalakshmi Barooah, hailing from Assam in north-eastern India. They have two sons, Amaan and Ayaan, both of whom are performing artists trained in music by their father. Khan cared for his diabetic father until he died in 1972. Their family home in Gwalior was made into a musical center and they live in New Delhi.

It was the first application-independent implementation of a TCP stack for a non-Unix platform and predates Winsock by over 5 years. Released in 1988, it is considered obsolete and has reliability issues and incomplete features that sometimes prevent it from operating properly on the modern Internet. In addition, the API was unique to the Mac OS, and at least one developer released a Berkeley Sockets-derived API to make porting from other platforms easier. It was originally a substantial purchase, carrying a $2,500 price tag for a site license, with an additional $2,500 fee for commercial use. The price was lowered until by the mid-1990s it sold for $60. MacTCP was not included free with Mac OS until System 7.5, when the rising popularity of the Internet made it a necessity. Apple replaced it in 1995 with Open Transport, which had an improved interface for user configuration, although MacTCP remained in use on older systems due to its generally lower system requirements.

They released their self-titled debut album in 1998, followed by their second and final album, Night on Earth, in 2001. Their single \\"Untouchable\\" reached the top 20 in the UK Singles Chart. In the summer of 1998, Rialto became the first ever UK chart band to release a single exclusively through the internet. Despite finding favour with music critics, with Melody Maker anticipating \\"a fairytale future of Oasis-like proportions\\", the band were famously dropped by their label East West, a Warner Music Group imprint, a month before the release of their heavily promoted eponymous debut album, denting the group's chances of major commercial success. Neil McCormick noted that Rialto were \\"among the most critically acclaimed and highly touted new groups to emerge\\" of the late 1990s, making \\"carefully crafted, Beatlesque pop, with an epic, cinematic sound and slightly sinister lyrics\\". The group gained a following in East Asia, particularly in South Korea where their debut reached the number one spot in the album charts. Band members * Louis Eliot – lead vocalist, guitar, songwriter * Jonny Bull – guitar, programming, backing vocals, producer * Julian Taylor – bass, backing vocals and trumpet * Pete Cuthbert – drums * Toby Hounsham – keyboards (1997–2000) * Anthony Christmas – drums (1997–2000) Biography Rialto grew from the remains of the band Kinky Machine, which featured singer Louis Eliot and guitarist Jonny Bull. Kinky Machine released two albums: their self-titled debut in 1993 (Oxygen/MCA Records) and Bent in 1995. In 1997, Eliot and Bull rejoined and, with the addition of bassist Julian Taylor, drummer Pete Cuthbert and keyboardist Toby Hounsham, formed Rialto. Later that year they released their first singles, \\"When We're Together\\" and \\"Untouchable.\\" The latter was re-released in January 1998 and cracked the Top 20 in the UK Singles Chart. Despite the anticipated arrival of their self-titled debut album, East West Records dropped them from their label, with China Records releasing the album on 13 July 1998 instead. In September 1998, Rialto played a gig at the University of Leeds during freshers’ week. The six-track Girl On A Train EP followed two years later, receiving accolades from NME and Q magazines. By the time Rialto gathered to make a second album, Hounsham and Christmas had left the group, leaving them as a four-piece. The band finally released their second and final album, Night on Earth, in 2001. Post-band activities Following the band's split, Eliot released his solo debut, the Everybody Loves You When You're Dead EP, in 2002, followed by his full-length debut, Long Way Round, on Iodine Records in 2004. Bull co-wrote the song \\"Friday Night\\" with Lily Allen at his studio in southwest Portugal. The song ended up on her debut album Alright, Still. In 2011, he wrote and sang the song for the \\"Ph.

History According to General Mills, Bisquick was invented in 1930 after one of their top sales executives met an innovative train dining car chef, on a business trip. After the sales executive complimented the chef on his deliciously fresh biscuits, the dining car chef shared that he used a pre-mixed biscuit batter he created consisting of lard, flour, baking powder and salt. The chef then stored this pre-mixed biscuit batter on ice in his kitchen, enabling him to bake fresh biscuits quickly on the train every day. As soon as the sales executive returned from that business trip, he created Bisquick. The recipe was adapted, using hydrogenated oil, thus eliminating the need for refrigeration. Bisquick was officially introduced on grocers' shelves in 1931. Though first promoted for only baking biscuits (\\"90 seconds from package to oven\\", the slogan read), Bisquick was soon used to prepare a wide variety of baked goods from pizza dough to pancakes to dumplings to snickerdoodle cookies. Substitution One cup of Bisquick can be substituted by a mixture of one cup of flour, teaspoons of baking powder, teaspoon of salt, and tablespoons of oil or melted butter (or by cutting in tbsp Crisco or lard). Ingredients The ingredients in Bisquick Original consist of bleached wheat flour (enriched with niacin, iron, thiamine mononitrate, riboflavin and folic acid), corn starch, dextrose, palm oil, leavening (baking soda, sodium aluminum phosphate, monocalcium phosphate), canola oil, salt, sugar, DATEM, and distilled monoglycerides.

(j.g.) Thomas Edward Zellars, a sailor who served on the battleship . On 12 June 1924, Thomas Zellars and 47 other crew members died in a firing accident. However, before they were killed, Zellars apparently opened a flood valve that extinguished the fire, preventing further damage to the ship and likely saving the lives of his shipmates. The destroyer that was named for him was laid down on 24 December 1943 at Seattle, Washington, by the Todd-Pacific Shipyards, Inc.; launched on 19 July 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Thomas M. Zellars; and commissioned on 25 October 1944, Commander Blinn Van Mater in command. Zellars was eventually transferred to the Iranian Navy and renamed Babr. The current status of the ship is unknown. World War II Zellars and the battleship after both vessels had been hit by kamikazes on 12 April After six weeks of shakedown training out of San Diego, California, Zellars returned north to Bremerton, Washington, for post-shakedown availability. She spent Christmas 1944 in Bremerton but, soon thereafter, got underway for Pearl Harbor and the second phase of training preparatory to her entry into combat. That training lasted until mid-March 1945 at which time she put to sea with a portion of the Okinawa invasion force. She was assigned to Task Group (TG) 54.3, a part of Rear Admiral Morton L. Deyo's Task Force 54 (TF 54), a Gunfire and Covering Force built around the old battleships. Staged through Ulithi in the Western Carolines, Zellars and her consorts arrived in the Ryukyus on 25 March. For the next week, she worked with the battleships and cruisers of TF 54, first in supporting the occupation of the roadstead at Kerama Retto and then in subjecting Okinawa itself to a systematic, long-duration, preinvasion bombardment. Because most of the targets on Okinawa were located well inland in accordance with Japan's relatively new strategy of defense in depth, Zellars' 5-inch guns usually deferred to the larger caliber batteries on board the battleships and cruisers while she provided them with antisubmarine and antiaircraft protection. After the 1 April amphibious assault of Okinawa, she continued to screen the larger ships of TG 54.3 and provided call fire in support of the troops ashore. Her combat service, however, proved extremely short; less than a month, in fact. On the afternoon of 12 April, she was screening the battleship when three Japanese \\"Jills\\" made a coordinated attack on her. They came at the destroyer's port quarter from an altitude of about above water. Zellars rang up to unmask all batteries and opened fire. She splashed the lead attacker at a range of and caught the second some away. The destroyer then shifted fire to the third intruder and began scoring 40-millimeter hits on him. The Japanese pilot, however, pressed home his attack and crashed into Zellars port side, forward of the bridge in her number 2 handling room. His 500-kilogram bomb tore through several light bulkheads before exploding on the starboard side of the ship in the scullery. She temporarily lost all power, and the fireroom had to be secured. Meanwhile, the after 20-millimeter guns continued to ward off additional tormentors and assisted in splashing another plane. That evening, she limped into Kerama Retto with extensive damage. After temporary patching, the destroyer headed back toward the United States and arrived at Terminal Island, California, on 1 June. During some two and one-half months in which the ship underwent repairs and overhaul, World War II ended. Post war Zellars conducted refresher training out of San Diego in September, transited the Panama Canal on 8 October, and entered the New York Naval Shipyard on the 16th. Following availability, the destroyer made a cruise, in company with the aircraft carrier , down the Atlantic coast to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and thence to Culebra Island where the destroyer conducted shore bombardment practice. Upon her return to the United States, the warship received orders directing her to escort the carrier on her shakedown voyage during January and February 1946. The highlight of the voyage was an early February visit to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 1 to 11 February. On the return trip, Zellars received orders detaching her from the big new carrier and sending her to Pensacola, Florida. She served there until 22 April when she got underway for Earle, New Jersey. There, Naval Academy midshipmen came on board for a summer cruise that lasted until August. Following routine repairs and post-availability shakedown at Casco Bay, Maine, the destroyer reported for duty with the Submarine Force, Atlantic Fleet, on 4 October. During the next three months, she served as a target ship for submarines conducting torpedo training. In January and February 1947, she participated in the first major fleet tactical exercise since Fleet Problem XXI in 1940. The warship returned to Norfolk on 17 March and, for the next four months, operated along the middle Atlantic and New England coasts. On 21 July, Zellars departed Norfolk on a deployment to European waters. She arrived in Plymouth, England, 10 days later and, for the next month, made the rounds to various British ports. Early in September, she transited the Strait of Gibraltar to begin a three-month cruise in the Mediterranean Sea. She visited Soudha Bay at Crete; Taranto, Naples, Venice, Salerno, and Trieste in Italy; and Tangiers on the North African coast. Zellars concluded her first 6th Fleet deployment upon her arrival at Boston on 1 December 1947 and entered the Boston Naval Shipyard that same day for a three-month overhaul. Following repairs, she conducted a five-week refresher cruise out of the base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Zellars reentered Norfolk again on 20 April 1948 and remained there for six weeks preparing to deploy once more to the 6th Fleet. On 1 June, the destroyer set sail from Norfolk and shaped a course for the Mediterranean. Her second tour of duty with the 6th Fleet proved brief, for she returned to Norfolk early in October. For almost two years, she conducted normal 2nd Fleet operations out of Norfolk. Korean War Late in June 1950, communist forces from North Korea moved south and invaded the Republic of Korea. As a result, Zellars departed Norfolk in August in company with the other destroyers of Destroyer Division (DesDiv) 162 and headed for the Far East. She and her division mates arrived in Yokosuka, Japan, early in October; provisioned, and set sail for Korean waters. The destroyer remained in the Korean War zone for nine months. During that time, her primary missions were gunfire support for United Nations troops ashore and coastal surveillance as well as antisubmarine protection for the larger American warships against an underwater threat that never materialized. As soon as she arrived on station in October 1950, she took part in the opening of Wonsan harbor. Late in November, the Chinese intervened in the conflict driving the United Nations troops into a southward retreat. Zellars initially supported the retirement of a South Korean division down the east coast and then provided gunfire support to the marines in the defensive perimeter around Wonsan while the Army's 3rd Infantry Division was evacuated by sea. In mid- December, the warship moved north from Wonsan to Hŭngnam to provide gunfire support during the evacuation of another coastal enclave held by retreating United Nations forces. She remained in Korean waters for another six months after the November–December evacuations and ranged both coasts of Korea delivering gunfire in support of the ground troops and interdicting coastal logistics. The destroyer returned to the United States in July 1951 and resumed duty with the Atlantic Fleet. Upon her return, she concentrated increasingly upon honing her antisubmarine warfare (ASW) capability. Over the next eight years, training in ASW tactics was emphasized on five extended cruises to European and Mediterranean waters and in exercises in the western Atlantic and in the Caribbean Sea. FRAM Late in 1959, Zellars entered the Norfolk Naval Shipyard and began Mark II Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM) overhaul and alterations. The addition of more up-to-date equipment added years to her projected service life and greatly enhanced her ASW capability. The most noticeable change was the addition of a flight deck and stowage area for an ASW helicopter. These modifications were completed in June 1960; and the ship moved south to a new home port, Mayport, Florida. Between June 1960 and December 1965, Zellars made five deployments to European waters. Four of those assignments consisted of duty in the Mediterranean with the 6th Fleet and the remaining one involved a midshipman summer cruise to northern European ports. Her duties with the 2nd Fleet in the western Atlantic and Caribbean consisted for the most part of training and yard overhauls but were highlighted by participation in operations enforcing the Cuban quarantine in the fall of 1962 and occasional duty supporting the Polaris missile test program. In August 1964, Zellars moved to Newport, Rhode Island, her new home port. In 1966, she remained in the western Atlantic for the entire year, breaking her training routine between mid-May and mid-September for regular overhaul at the Boston Naval Shipyard. More than half of 1967 was taken up by the NATO exercise Operation \\"Matchmaker III,\\" an experiment designed to determine what problems might arise from combined operations of ships of various nations and to test solutions to those problems. The operation began in mid-January 1967 and lasted until mid-August. It took her first to the West Indies, thence across the Atlantic to the waters around northern Europe, up over the Arctic Circle and finally to the coasts of New England and Canada. In September 1967, she resumed 2nd Fleet operations along the eastern seaboard. After completing the annual \\"Springboard\\" operation in February and preparing at Newport, Rhode Island, for overseas movement, Zellars sailed for the Mediterranean once again, putting to sea from Newport on 4 April 1968. That deployment, consisting of the usual unilateral and multinational training exercises and goodwill port visits, lasted until 27 September when she tied up at Newport once again. Following eight months of operations out of Newport, the destroyer embarked upon the last Mediterranean cruise of her career on 9 April 1969. The usual Mediterranean training and port visit routine occupied her time for the next six months. Zellars earned one battle star during World War II and four battle stars during the Korean War. Iranian service Babr in the late 1970s. The warship returned to Newport on 10 October and, one month later, moved to New York where she became a Naval Reserve training ship. That duty constituted her mission for the remaining 16 months of her active career. Zellars was decommissioned on 19 March 1971, and her name was struck from the Navy List. Set aside for sale to the Iranian government, she was moved to the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard where she underwent extensive modification over the next 20 months. Renamed Babr (Tiger) (DDG-7), she was commissioned in the Imperial Iranian Navy on 12 October 1973 at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard.

It is the second largest non- apartment style unit of the Berkeley Student Cooperative (BSC), behind Cloyne Court Hotel. Located at 2422 Ridge Road, the house is a block from the center of the northern edge of the University of California, Berkeley campus. The yellow stucco fortress overlooks North Gate, and the two accessible roofs provide a view of San Francisco, the East Bay, the Berkeley Hills, and most of campus. It sits on Northside atop Holy Hill, the area in the vicinity of a five-way intersection surrounded on all sides by churches and seminaries. The BSC central office and central kitchen are located within the Casa Zimbabwe building, but they only connect to the main residential area by a few doors. The residents of Casa Zimbabwe are affectionately referred to as Czars, though the pejorative term of Krackistani is not without use. History When CZ opened in 1966, it was known as \\"Ridge Project\\" since it shares its lot with Ridge House, another BSC cooperative. Ridge Project residents referred to themselves as \\"Projectiles\\". Ridge Project was one of the first instances of co-ed housing on the Berkeley campus. In 1987, the house residents successfully petitioned to change the house name to its current one. The name \\"Casa Zimbabwe\\" was first proposed in 1983. At that time, the USCA had a Minority Affairs committee that was looking to increase the number of minorities at Berkeley in general and in the co-ops in particular. The word “project” had a negative association with public housing. An additional issue was the frequent confusion between Ridge Project and Ridge House. No satire was intended with the name \\"Casa Zimbabwe\\"; it reflected the composition of the house. White minority rule had recently ended in Rhodesia/Zimbabwe, and many believed that Zimbabwe would become a prosperous western-style democracy. Over time it was recognized that 'House of Stone' was indeed a fitting name, given the structure's craggy exterior and oft stoned inhabitants, and was accepted by the USCA. In the spring of 2001, the residents voted during house council to change the house name to Krackistan (though this has never been recognized by anyone outside of the house). Casa Zimbabwe closed December 19, 2006 in order to perform major seismic retrofitting work. The house reopened August 23, 2007. Members The residents and boarders of CZ are the members of the cooperative. Each resident pays rent in addition to contributing five hours of work per week. Each boarder only pays for food, and his/her work contribution per week is dependent on how many meals s/he eats at CZ. CZ holds a weekly council meeting, usually on Sunday at 6PM, where members gather to discuss house business. Building While every other BSC house was a pre- existing structure eventually converted into a co-op, CZ is unique in that it was built with the specific intent of being used as a cooperative living space. The house is divided into three segments. Residents' rooms are located in the east and west wings (known as the \\"10s\\" and the \\"100s\\" for the room numbering scheme used), both of which are connected in the middle by two stories of wide open common space. The west wing was originally intended to be all male and the east wing all female. The first room on the first floor of the east wing was known as \\"Heidi's Room\\", Heide Wolgemuth having been the housemother when the building opened. The segregation of the wings by gender ended in the 1970s. Forty solar panels were installed on the CZ roof in 1979. The panels supply hot water to the building.

For over 100 years, the arsenal was the primary US Army Ordnance facility for the West Coast of the United States. In 1847 a parcel of land adjoining the Benicia city limits on the east was acquired for a military reserve. First occupation of the post was on April 9, 1849, when two companies of the 2nd Infantry Regiment set up camp to establish Benicia Barracks, which also housed the 3rd Artillery Regiment. In 1851, after the urging of General Persifor F. Smith, the first Ordnance Supply Depot in the West was established in Benicia. In 1852 it was designated Benicia Arsenal. Notable military personnel who were stationed there during this time include Ulysses Grant, Edward Ord, and Joseph Hooker, among others. The grounds of the Benicia Arsenal are also famous for stabling one of the elements of the Army's Camel Corps. The short-lived Camel Corps was disbanded in 1863, but the Camel Barns, built in 1855, remain and are now the Benicia Historical Museum. The Benicia Arsenal was a staging area during the Civil War for Union troops from the West, and the installation remained a garrisoned post until 1898 when troops were assigned to duty in the Philippines during the Spanish–American War. From 1911 to 1913, the arsenal was commanded by Colden Ruggles, who later served as the Army's Chief of Ordnance. During World War I, the Benicia Arsenal gave ordnance support to all large Army installations in the Western States as well as supplying Ordnance material to American expeditionary forces in Siberia. Italian Service Units of the 4th, 4th and 50th Italian Quartermaster Service Company worked at the Arsenal during World War 2.militarymuseum.org, Prisoner of War Camps and Italian Service Units in California Workers loading cartridges for big guns at the arsenal In the 24 hours following the Pearl Harbor bombing, 125 separate truck convoys were loaded and dispatched from the Benicia Arsenal, leaving its stock of ammunition, small arms, and high explosives completely exhausted. Throughout the war, the arsenal supplied ports with weapons, artillery, parts, supplies, and tools. In addition, the arsenal overhauled 14,343 pairs of binoculars, manufactured 180,000 small items for tanks and weapons, and repaired approximately 70,000 watches. However, the arsenal is most famous for supplying munitions to Lieutenant Colonel Jimmy Doolittle for the first bombing raid on Tokyo on April 18, 1942, launched from the USS Hornet. Guardhouse Prior to 1940, the arsenal employed 85 civilian employees; by October 1942, the payroll had reached 4,545. The labor shortage in 1944 forced the arsenal commander to put 250 Italian and 400 German prisoners of war to work, alongside 150 juveniles from the California Youth Authority. Women comprised nearly half the civilian employee force. During the Korean War, the number of civilians reached an all-time high of 6,700 workers. The Benicia Arsenal was deactivated in 1963, and the facility was closed in 1964. The arsenal has been redeveloped as work and sales space for artists and artisans. Medal of Honor recipient John H. Foley is buried in the arsenal's cemetery.

The route was originally designated by 1939, replacing the southern portion of SH 19. Route description In Harris County, SH 288 is the South Freeway, a divided freeway known for having one of the widest medians of the local road system. It begins as freeway status from its northern terminus at Interstate 69/U.S. Route 59 just south of downtown southward through south Houston. It reaches an intersection with I-610 and continues south through newer subdivisions. It reaches an intersection with State Highway 6, after which it loses its freeway status. From the Harris-Brazoria County Line to Freeport, it is referred to as the Nolan Ryan Expressway, in recognition of Baseball Hall of Fame pitcher Nolan Ryan who grew up in Alvin, Texas, which is not directly on this road. Brazoria County will be calling the tolled portion of the highway, located within the county, the Brazoria County Expressway. North of Angleton, the route returns to freeway status passing west of Angleton, near the Texas Gulf Coast Regional Airport, and around the southwestern side of Lake Jackson. It then turns southward toward Freeport. In Freeport, it is known as Brazosport Boulevard. It reaches its southern terminus at State Highway 36 on the southwest side of town. Toll Lanes To help alleviate congestion on SH 288, HCTRA and BCTRA will construct toll lanes in the median of the existing freeway in the Greater Houston area. The route will begin at I-69/US 59 and terminate at the intersection of the proposed Grand Parkway (SH 99) for a total length of . The entire length of the project will have 4 lanes with interchanges at IH-610, Beltway 8 and at the Grand Parkway. HCTRA will take on the portion located in Harris County, beginning at I-69/US 59 and terminate at the Harris/Brazoria County line at Clear Creek located just north of FM 2234 for a total of . BCTRA will construct the portion located in Brazoria County in two phases. Phase 1 will be from the Harris/Brazoria County line, southward to just south of County Road 58 (Croix Rd) for a total of while phase 2, to be built by TxDot's Toll Operations Division, will continue southward to the Grand Parkway (TX 99) for the remaining . Design work for the entire project began in the summer of 2015. Construction on the toll lanes in Harris County began in November 2016 and construction of phase 1 in Brazoria County begun in June 2017. It has not been determined as to how tolls will be collected but drivers will be able to use any electronic toll tags, accepted in Texas, if they have them while driving on the tolled lanes. History State Highway 288 was designated on September 26, 1939 as the renumbering of the portion of State Highway 19 south of downtown Houston. On August 1, 1962, SH 288 was extended to FM 1495. On June 25, 1981, SH 288 was rerouted from I-45 to MacGregor Way in Houston on the new freeway. The original routing ran southward along Almeda Road in Houston. The route traveled southward through Fresno, past the Houston Southwest Airport, before reaching Bonney. This entire portion of the route from US 90A southward was transferred to Farm to Market Road 521 and Spur 300 on December 14, 1981, as SH 288 was rerouted onto the new freeway from US 90A to Spur 300. The route then traveled east through downtown Angleton, continuing southeast before reaching Freeport. This original section is now part of County Road 543 and Farm to Market Road 523. SH 288 was redirected southward from Angleton when the city of Clute became more populated, then continued southward to a new intersection with State Highway 36 west of Freeport. On November 18, 1983, SH 288 was rerouted on the new freeway from MacGregor Way to US 90A. The entire remaining section from FM 521 north of Angleton to Clute was transferred first to Texas State Highway 227 on September 26, 1986, and later Business Highway 288 on October 25, 1990 when the bypass around the western side of Lake Jackson opened. The section from Clute south to Freeport was transferred to SH 227, and the section concurrent with SH 36 became SH 36 on February 23, 1989. On August 15, 1989, SH 288 was extended south over part of SH 227 and concurrent with SH 36, restoring the lost section from Clute to Freeport.

Biography Street was born in Lumberton, Mississippi, in 1903. As a teenager, he began working as a journalist for newspapers in Laurel (Laurel Leader Call) and Hattiesburg, Mississippi. At the age of 20, Street, born a Roman Catholic, decided to become a Baptist minister, attending Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary and Howard College. Unsatisfied with his pastoral work after ministering stints in Missouri, Mississippi, and Alabama, Street returned to journalism in 1926. After briefly holding a position with the Pensacola, Florida Journal, Street joined the staff of the Associated Press. The AP position took him to New York, where he began freelance writing fiction. Hired away from the AP by the New York World-Telegram in 1937, Street sold a short story (\\"A Letter to the Editor\\") to Cosmopolitan magazine, which caught the eye of film producer David Selznick, who turned it into a hit film, Nothing Sacred. The Broadway musical, Hazel Flagg, was based on his short story, as well as the Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis-film Living It Up. His success allowed him to write full-time, and throughout the 1940s he worked on a five-novel series of historical fiction about the progress of the Dabney family through the 19th century. The Dabney pentology--Oh, Promised Land, Tap Roots, By Valor and Arms, Tomorrow We Reap, and Mingo Dabney—explored classic Southern issues of race and honor, and strongly characterized Street's struggle to reconcile his Southern heritage with his feelings about racial injustice. The series was a critical and popular success, with several of the books being made into feature films. Street modeled characters in his Dabney family saga on Sam Dale, Newt Knight and Greenwood LeFlore. Street also published two popular works about boys and dogs, the short story \\"The Biscuit Eater\\" and the novel Good-bye, My Lady, both turned into movies (the former in both 1940 and 1972, the latter in 1956), and a set of semi-autobiographical novels about a Baptist minister, The Gauntlet and The High Calling, both were bought by Hollywood but never produced. Street's short stories and articles appeared regularly in Cosmopolitan, The Saturday Evening Post, Collier's and Holiday. Death Street died of a heart attack in Chapel Hill, N.C., on September 28, 1954, at age 50. He was in Chapel Hill to present awards for excellence in radio broadcasting at a banquet, for which the main speaker was a \\"Reporter From the Pentagon\\" (as described by Scott Jarrad, a radio journalist who was to receive an award, who did not give the man's name). According to Jarrad, the \\"Reporter from the Pentagon\\" made a pure power politics argument in favor of preventive war against the Communist nations. Street, who was to present the awards, speaking after that main address, vehemently attacked the position put forward by the \\"Reporter from the Pentagon,\\" in a spontaneous rant Jarrad described as \\"an explosion,\\" laced with mild profanity; \\"in a word, he was magnificent.\\" Following that rant, however, again according to Jarrad, Street presented the broadcasting awards warmly and politely. Jarrad specifically mentioned the firm and affectionate handshake from Street at the presentation of the award. However, shortly after the ceremony, Street \\"laid his head on the table like a baby,\\" dead of a fatal heart attack. Jarrad speculated that the \\"explosion\\" of Street's vehement rant may have been the stress that caused his fatal heart attack.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFwGQW-ZwE Scott Jarrad's letter was recorded by professional actors and made into the short film, \\"A Colleague's Tribute to Southern Author James Street.\\" Included is a gallery of 32 private family photographs.

The men submitted their design to the Marine Ministry on May 3, 1901; it was approved the following July, and the Baltic Shipyard was then awarded the order for construction of Torpedo Boat No. 113 (later renamed combat submarine Dolphin). Bubnov was appointed Head of the Construction Commission for Submarines. It was this Construction Commission that after multiple transformations and name changes became the Rubin Central Design Bureau for Marine Engineering. Dolphin Construction of the Dolphin was completed in 1903, and its success in subsequent tests was the impetus for the creation of newer, more advanced types of submarines. By 1918 seventy- three submarines of classes Kasatka, Minoga, Akula, Morzh, and Vepr had joined the Russian Navy, and four more of the new class Major-General Bubnov were still under construction. Thirty-two of these were built to the designs of I.G. Bubnov, who had become Major General of the Naval Architect Corps and Honoured Professor at the Nikolayev Marine Academy. =Pre-World War II= In 1926 the Construction Commission for Submarines became Technical Bureau No. 4, and six years later was renamed the Central Design Bureau for Special (Military) Shipbuilding No. 2, headed by B.M. Malinin. He designed submarines of the Dekabrist-class, Leninets-class, and Shchuka-class. Another milestone of the era came in 1935, when Central Design Bureau engineer S.A. Bazilevskiy proposed an air-independent propulsion system which allowed engine operation based on the closed cycle REDO in both surface and submerged submarine conditions. Experiments on this cycle implementation were carried out on board submarines of Series XII M-92 (S-92, R-1). More change came in 1937, when the Bureau was given the new name Central Design Bureau No. 18 (or TsKB-18), and furthermore became an independent economic organization directly subordinated to the Second Chief Department of People's Commissariat of Defence Industry. =World War II= By the beginning of World War II, 206 submarines were built to 19 different TsKB-18 designs. 54 more submarines were constructed at the Bureau during the War. During the Siege of Leningrad TsKB-18 was evacuated from Leningrad to Gorkiy. =Cold War= The Russian Navy nuclear-powered cruise missile submarine OMSK (K-186), which became the fifth Oscar II class unit In 1947 TsKB-18 completed the development of Technical Design No.613 (called the Whiskey class submarine in NATO classification) – a torpedo diesel-electric submarine of medium displacement which took into account the combat experiences of Soviet and German submarines from the War. Commissioned by the Navy in 1951, the 215 unit series built to Design 613 was the largest in the Soviet Union. Approximately 25 to 30 of the submarines were built in People's Republic of China, and the design was handed over to Chinese technicians. P.P. Pustyntsev (:ru:Пустынцев, Павел Петрович), who headed the Bureau from 1951 to 1974, created the design for Project 641 (NATO classification: Foxtrot class), which began development in 1955. 75 units of this class were commissioned to the Navy in 1963. The same year the Hotel class submarine, which had begun development in 1956 as Project 658, was redesigned to enable underwater launching of D-4 ballistic missiles. In 1965 the Lenin Prize was awarded for works related to the underwater launch of ballistic missiles. In 1963 technical design 667A (NATO classification: Yankee class), a second-generation nuclear missile submarine, was developed. Joining the Soviet fleet in 1967, the Project 667A submarine became the first ship of the largest series of nuclear missile submarines (34 units). Later known as \\"nuclear missile submarine cruisers,\\" improvements to the Yankee class submarines would include the installation of longer-range and multiple-warhead missiles. The success of submarine Projects 667A and 667B (Delta class submarine) would be rewarded with Lenin Prizes in 1970 and 1974, respectively. The Yankee-based ballistic missile submarine family comprises: Project 667A Yankee, Project 667B Delta I, Project 667BD Delta II, Project 667BDR Delta III, and Project 667BDRM Delta IV. TsKB-18 got the name Rubin in 1966. The Oscar class submarine started development in 1971, and followed by the Typhoon class in 1976. In 1974 Igor Spassky succeeded Pustyntsev as head of the bureau and remained in the position until the 2000s (decade). Sergey Kovalev was director of the Rubin Design Bureauthumb Present dayMarket economy= Since the advent of Perestroika, Rubin has continued to produce nuclear submarines with such projects as the construction of the fourth- generation ballistic missile Borey class, also known as the Dolgorukiy class, which started in 1996 . Rubin now also works with outside companies (including Halliburton) on the production of oil platforms that are now used in drilling around Sakhalin Island in the Sea of Okhotsk and in the waters adjacent to South Korea. Another of the company's important projects of recent years is Sea Launch, a unique spacecraft launch technology. With marine components produced by Rubin, Sea Launch uses a specially-modified floating oil platform positioned in the equatorial Pacific Ocean, as a launch pad. In 1999, shortly after the company was founded, the Sea Launch consortium claimed that their launch-related operating costs would be lower than a land-based equivalent due in part to reduced staff requirements. The platform and command ship have 310 crew members. Sea Launch launch platform Ocean Odyssey in its former home port at Long Beach, California Rubin has also developed such exotic projects as a Submarine Cargo Vessel that can operate year-round in the Arctic Ocean and a Nuclear Underwater Gas Transfer Station for trans-ocean natural gas pipeline transport. Other recent projects include a high-speed train, the ES-250 Sokol , intended for the Moscow-St. Petersburg Railway, and a design for a low-floor tram . As a joint project with the Italian shipbuilding company Fincantieri, Rubin is developing a new diesel air-independent propulsion submarine, the S1000, based on a new fuel cell air independent propulsion system developed in Italy. Its length is 56.2 metres and its displacement is 1,000 tonnes. A mock- up was exhibited at Euronaval 2006.

It derives from the Delphi method which was developed in the 1950-1960s at the RAND Corporation as a forecasting tool. It has since been adapted across many industries to estimate many kinds of tasks, ranging from statistical data collection results to sales and marketing forecasts. Wideband Delphi Process Barry Boehm and John A. Farquhar originated the Wideband variant of the Delphi method in the 1970s. They called it \\"wideband\\" because, compared to the existing delphi method, the new method involved greater interaction and more communication among those participating. The method was popularized by Boehm's book Software Engineering Economics (1981). Boehm's original steps from this book were: # Coordinator presents each expert with a specification and an estimation form. # Coordinator calls a group meeting in which the experts discuss estimation issues with the coordinator and each other. # Experts fill out forms anonymously. # Coordinator prepares and distributes a summary of the estimates # Coordinator calls a group meeting, specifically focusing on having the experts discuss points where their estimates vary widely # Experts fill out forms, again anonymously, and steps 4 to 6 are iterated for as many rounds as appropriate. A variant of Wideband Delphi was developed by Neil Potter and Mary Sakry of The Process Group. In this process, a project manager selects a moderator and an estimation team with three to seven members. The Delphi process consists of two meetings run by the moderator. The first meeting is the kickoff meeting, during which the estimation team creates a work breakdown structure (WBS) and discusses assumptions. After the meeting, each team member creates an effort estimate for each task. The second meeting is the estimation session, in which the team revises the estimates as a group and achieves consensus. After the estimation session, the project manager summarizes the results and reviews them with the team, at which point they are ready to be used as the basis for planning the project. * Choose the team. The project manager selects the estimation team and a moderator. The team should consist of 3 to 7 project team members. The team should include representatives from every engineering group that will be involved in the development of the work product being estimated. * Kickoff meeting. The moderator prepares the team and leads a discussion to brainstorm assumptions, generate a WBS and decide on the units of estimation. * Individual preparation. After the kickoff meeting, each team member individually generates the initial estimates for each task in the WBS, documenting any changes to the WBS and missing assumptions. * Estimation session. The moderator leads the team through a series of iterative steps to gain consensus on the estimates. At the start of the iteration, the moderator charts the estimates on the whiteboard so the estimators can see the range of estimates. The team resolves issues and revises estimates without revealing specific numbers. The cycle repeats until either no estimator wants to change his or her estimate or the estimators agree that the range is acceptable. * Assemble tasks. The project manager works with the team to collect the estimates from the team members at the end of the meeting and compiles the final task list, estimates and assumptions. * Review results. The project manager reviews the final task list with the estimation team.

He was an indentured servant and in later years an executive assistant and personal secretary to Governor John Carver. In 1620 he signed the Mayflower Compact and helped found the colony.William Bradford, Of Plymouth Plantation, 1620-1647, ed. by Samuel Eliot Morison, The Modern Library, (New York: Random House, 1967),pp. 59, 68, 195, 263, 400-3, 415-417 During his service to Governor Carver in 1621, Howland assisted in the making of a treaty with the Sachem Massasoit of the Wampanoag. In 1626, he was a freeman and one of eight settlers who agreed to assume the colony's debt to its investors in exchange for a monopoly on the fur trade.Philbrick, Pg. 168 He was elected deputy to the Plymouth General Court in 1641 and held the position until 1655, and again in 1658. English origins  John Howland was born in Fenstanton, Huntingdonshire, England around 1592.Pilgrim Hall Museum He was the son of Margaret and Henry Howland, and the brother of Henry and Arthur Howland, who emigrated later from England to Marshfield, Massachusetts. Although Henry and Arthur Howland were Quakers, John himself held to the original faith of the Separatist Pilgrims.  Speedwell and Mayflower  William Bradford, who was the governor of Plymouth Colony for many years, wrote in Of Plymouth Plantation that Howland was a man-servant of John Carver. Carver was the deacon of the Separatists church while the group resided in Leiden, Netherlands. At the time the Leiden congregation left the Netherlands on the Speedwell, Carver was in England securing investments, gathering other potential passengers, and chartering the Mayflower for the journey to North America. Howland may have accompanied Carver's household from Leiden when the Speedwell left Delfshaven for Southampton, England, in July 1620. Ansel Ames, in Mayflower and Her Log, said that Howland was probably kin of Carver's and that he was more likely a steward or a secretary than a servant. The Separatists planned to travel to the New World on the Speedwell and the Mayflower. The Speedwell proved to be unseaworthy, and thus most of the passengers crowded onto the Mayflower.  Voyage  William Bradford's transcription of the Mayflower Compact The Mayflower departed Plymouth, England, on September 6/16, 1620. The small, 100-foot ship had 102 passengers and a crew of about 30-40 in extremely cramped conditions. By the second month out, the ship was being buffeted by strong westerly gales, causing the ship's timbers to be badly shaken with caulking failing to keep out sea water, and with passengers, even in their berths, getting wet. This, combined with a lack of proper rations and unsanitary conditions for several months, contributed to sicknesses. On the way, there were two deaths, a crew member and a passenger. After arriving at their destination, in the space of several months, almost half the passengers perished in the cold, harsh, unfamiliar New England winter.Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691, (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), p. 413 During the voyage there was a turbulent storm during which Howland fell overboard. He managed to grab a topsail halyard that was trailing in the water and was hauled back aboard safely. On November 9/19, 1620, after about three months at sea, including a month of delays in England, the crew and passengers spotted land, which was the Cape Cod Hook, now called Provincetown Harbor. After they struggled for several days to get south to their planned destination of the Colony of Virginia, strong winter seas forced them to return to the harbor at Cape Cod hook, where they anchored on November 11/21. On November 11, 1620, the Mayflower Compact was signed. Howland was the thirteenth of the 41 \\"principal\\" men to sign.George Ernest Bowman, The Mayflower Compact and its signers, (Boston: Massachusetts Society of Mayflower Descendants, 1920). Photocopies of the 1622, 1646 and 1669 versions of the document pp. 7-19.  Plymouth Colony  The first winter in North America proved deadly for the Pilgrims as almost half their number perished. The Carver family, with whom Howland lived, survived the winter of 1620-21. However, the following spring, on an unusually hot day in April, Carver, according to William Bradford, came out of his cornfield feeling ill. He passed into a coma and \\"never spake more\\". His wife, Kathrine, died soon after her husband. The Carvers' only children had died while they lived in Leiden, and it is possible that Howland inherited their estate. In 1621, after Carver's death, Howland became a freeman.Philbrick. Pg. 102 In 1624, he was considered the head of what was once the Carver household when he was granted an acre for each member of the household including himself, Elizabeth Tilley, Desire Minter, and a boy named William Latham. In the several years after becoming a freeman, he served at various times as selectman, assistant and deputy governor, surveyor of highways, and as member of the fur committee. In 1626, he was asked to participate in assuming the colony's debt to its investors to enable the colony to pursue its own goals without the pressure to remit profits back to England. The \\"undertakers\\" paid the investors £1,800 to relinquish their claims on the land, and £2,400 for other debt. In return the group acquired a monopoly on the colony's fur trade for six years.Stone. Pg. 7 The Jabez Howland House in Plymouth, Massachusetts, built c. 1667 and photographed in 1921. Elizabeth (Tilley) Howland lived there for five years. Howland accompanied Edward Winslow in the exploration of Kennebec River (in current day Maine), looking for possible fur trading sites and natural resources that the colony could exploit. He also led a team of men that built and operated a fur trading post there. While Howland was in charge of the colony's northerly trading post, an incident occurred there that Bradford described as \\"one of the saddest things that befell them.\\"Bradford, William, Of Plymouth Plantation, Edited by Harold Paget. (E.P. Dutton & Company. 1920), Pg. 253-256 A group of traders from Piscataqua (present day Portsmouth, New Hampshire) led by a man named John Hocking, encroached on the trading ground granted to Plymouth by a patent, by sailing their bark up the river beyond their post. Howland warned Hocking to depart, but Hocking, brandishing a pistol and using foul language, refused. Howland ordered his men to approach the bark in a canoe and cut its cables setting it adrift. The Plymouth men managed to cut one cable when Hocking put his pistol to the head of Moses Talbot, one of Howland's men, and shot and killed him. Another of the Howland group shot Hocking to death in response.Stone. Pgs. 7-9 In Plymouth, the Howlands lived on the north side of Leyden Street. They lived for a short time in DuxburyHurd. Pg. 357 and then moved to Kingston where they had a farm on a piece of land referred to as Rocky Nook. The farm burned down in 1675 during King Philip's War. By that time, John had died and Elizabeth moved in with her son, Jabez. Before moving to Rhode Island, Jabez Howland owned a home in Plymouth at 33 Sandwich Street. The house was built by Jacob Mitchell in about 1667 and was sold to Jabez Howland. John and Elizabeth had wintered in the house, and Elizabeth lived there from 1675, when the Rocky Nook farm was burned down, until Jabez sold it in 1680. It is the only house standing in Plymouth in which Mayflower passengers lived. Elizabeth Tilley Until Bradford's Of Plymouth Plantation was discovered in 1856, it was presumed that Howland's wife, formerly Elizabeth Tilley, was the adopted daughter of the Carvers. (Her parents, uncle and aunt who came to the New World died of sickness during the first winter.) This error was even recorded on a gravestone that was erected for Howland on Burial Hill, in 1836. However, the Bradford journal revealed that she was, in fact, the daughter of John Tilley and his wife, Joan (Hurst). Elizabeth Tilley Howland was born in Henlow, Bedfordshire, England where she was baptized in August, 1607. She and her parents were passengers on the Mayflower. John Tilley and his wife Joan both died the first winter as did his brother Edward Tilley and wife Ann. This left Elizabeth an orphan and so she was taken in by the Carver family. The Carvers died about a year later, and part of their estate was inherited by Howland, and Elizabeth became his ward.Caleb H. Johnson, The Mayflower and Her Passengers, (Indiana: Xlibris Corp., 2006), pp. 237-238Charles Edward Banks, The English Ancestry and Homes of the Pilgrim Fathers (New York: Grafton Press, 1929), p. 87 In 1623/24, she married Howland.

History  The inception of the George Whitfield College was in the early 1970s when candidates for the Church of England in SA (CESA) Ministry were trained at the Bible Institute of South Africa in Kalk Bay. Bishop Bradley and other members of the Church were aware that the candidates were not receiving adequate training and knowledge of the doctrines, practices and history of the Church of England. It was agreed that this was necessary so once a week, these candidates met in the library at the Institute for tuition on the Book of Common Prayer and other issues central to the CESA worship. The Rev Shucksmith from the Pinelands congregation took these lectures until his return to the UK. This tuition however was very hit and miss, on again and off again. In 1976 Rev Streeter joined the lecturing staff of the Bible Institute from Fort Victoria in what was then Rhodesia. (Zimbabwe) He headed up the George Whitfield College. As time passed the Bible Institute became concerned that it may be perceived as being closely aligned to one denomination so it became apparent that change was necessary. George Whitefield College was founded in 1989 on the initiative of Bishop Joe Bell, then presiding bishop of the Church of England in South Africa, and its founding Principal was David Broughton Knox, who had for 27 years been Principal of Moore Theological College, Sydney. In 1997 GWC became affiliated with Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education,(Under the management of Prof C.J. Reinecke) now known as North-West University and with Dr Seccombe an accredited external New Testament professor of NWU. Up until 2010, most students of GWC were also students of NWU, and although they studied at GWC with GWC’s curriculum, they were able to graduate with the Bachelor of Theology, the Bachelor of Arts Honours, and the Master of Arts from NWU. Since January 2010 GWC has offered its own BTh program, one that has been fully accredited by the Council for Higher Education. Visiting scholars spend time at GWC and conduct PostGraduate modules: In 2011 Dr Paul Bowers (New Testament), in 2012 Dr Abel Ndjerareou (Old Testament), Dr George Athas (Hebrew), Dr Peter Bolt (New Testament) and as special guest in Feb 2013 Dr Mark Thompson, principal elect of Moore Theological College. GWC has also employed new PhDs in a postdoc capacity resulting in the publishing of several books: Dr Vhumani Magezi on Pastoral counselling and Aids in Southern Africa (2011), and Dr Fabulous Moyo in the area of Church history in Malawi (2012). GWC hosts an annual lecture which in October 2009 was given by former member of faculty Dr James Krohn on the topic of Calvin as preacher of the Word. In October 2010 Dr John Azumah delivered this lecture. In 2012 this lecture was given by Dr Ashley Null. GWC seeks to maintain friendly ties with the Bible Institute of South Africa situated in Kalk Bay in Cape Town,http://www.bisa.org.za/ and two sister CESA colleges: the Johannesburg Bible College and the Kwazulu-Natal Missionary and Bible College (KMBC) formerly Trinity Academy.Email: trinityacademy@holytrinitypmb.org.za The college also enjoys close ties with several local churches including St James Church Kenilworth whose rector is former GWC vice principal Dr Mervyn Eloff. The college is also keen to maintain ties with former students and faculty, and supports the creation of electronic pages by students to this end - see GWC Facebook page George Whitefield College is overseen by a board of directors chaired by Bishop Frank Retief up till September 2010, but recently succeeded by Bishop Desmond Inglesby currently the presiding bishop of the Church of England in South Africa. The board is fully compliant with demands set by King 3.  Programs  The GWC faculty in 2013 totals eight full-time members and numerous part- time lecturers. The administration comprises a registrar, assistant registrar, business manager, IT manager, library director, student services manager, a librarian and two development managers. The Explore correspondence course is internally managed, and currently has 100 enrolments in about 10 countries, including Madagascar and Thailand. The library (which started off as Dr Knox's substantial personal library) has grown to 35,000 volumes (adding in about 800 new titles each year), and is housed in a custom-built resource centre. There are currently over 80 full-time undergraduates enrolled for the 3 year BTh, and in the Postgraduate program there are 7 in honours, 11Masters students, and 5 engaged in doctoral studies. Students have the use of a computer centre as well as an intranet, along with wireless access to the internet. Lecture rooms are equipped with data projectors and modern seating. Applications for study flow in from all over the world and it is not uncommon to have students from Chile, England, Germany, Korea and Australia. Most however come from Africa, with the majority from South Africa. The bulk of the enrollments are for a BTh in Pastoral Ministry, but the college has for many years offered a BTh in Children's Ministry, a unique degree. There is also a fully accredited one year Certificate qualification, and each year several students prior to any engagement with other studies, come to the college for some theological grounding. At the commencement of each year, there is an 8 day language school which introduces the rudiments of Biblical Greek and Hebrew, and is open to members of the public.

Preceded by Ghana Bassi, Manin was the last ruler of the Ghana Empire before the Almoravid conquest. Accounts of Tunka Manin come from al- Bakhri, a visitor to the Ghana kingdom who described him as a \\"lover of justice and favorable to Muslims\\". Manin inherited his throne from his mother, brother, King Basi, and as King, he was the chief decision-maker. Manin settled disputes and ordeals and also had ministers who collected taxes and made laws. During his reign, he controlled numerous warriors that were tasked with defending the kingdom. Later on in his reign, the kingdom would eventually fall because of a few factors. One factor as the system of governance, religious reasons (which sparked the Almoravids movement), the fact that Manin himself was not Muslim, and division between Muslims and non- Muslims. Ibn Yacin, who started the Almoravid movement, declared jihad on Tunka Manin's kingdom in a struggle that would span over ten years with the Almoravids briefly gaining control. Manin had succeeded Bassi in 1062 and like him had refused to convert to Islam.African Glory: The Story of Vanished Negro Civilizations by John Coleman De Graft-Johnson, page 88 The missionary Almoravids who wanted to convert other people to their faith had been angered by Bassi's refusal to convert had started invading the empire under Abu Bakr ibn Umar.African Glory: The Story of Vanished Negro Civilizations by John Coleman De Graft-Johnson, page 87 Al-Bakri noted that Manin controlled some 200,000 warriors.Early African Empires and their Global Connections However, in 1076, the Almoravids succeeded in sacking the empire's capital of Kumbi Saleh.The Oxford Encyclopedia of African Thought, Volume 1 byAbiola Irele, Biodun Jeyifo, page 407 Manin continued to rule as a vassal of the Almoravids and paid tribute to them.African Glory: The Story of Vanished Negro Civilizations by John Coleman De Graft-Johnson, page 88 The Almoravids were expelled in 1087 with Abu Bakr being killed.

He is particularly noted for his work on spectroscopy and diffraction gratings. Early life and education Born in Wimbledon, Surrey, Thomas Ralph Merton was the only son of Emile Ralph Merton and Helen, daughter of Thomas Meates, a descendant of Sir Thomas Meutas, Secretary to Sir Francis Bacon. Emile Merton was for a time in the family metal trading business as a partner in Henry R. Merton & Co. which was started in London by his eldest brother in 1860. Another brother William Ralph Merton founded the Metallgesellschaft in Frankfurt-am-Main in 1881, which became the second largest company in Germany and the largest non-ferrous mining company in the world. The two companies worked closely with one another, along with the American Metal Company in New York City. Thomas was educated at Farnborough School and Eton College, where Dr T. C. Porter, the physics master, encouraged him to begin research. Between leaving Eton in 1905 and going up to Balliol College, Oxford, in 1906, he worked at King's College London. He went to Balliol with distinguished fellow Etonians Julian Grenfell, Ronald Knox, and Julian Huxley. In view of his delicate health and his promise as a scientist, Oxford allowed Merton to go straight to a research thesis without taking his final exams; this was an unusual privilege. His investigation of the properties of solutions of caesium nitrate earned him a BSc in 1910. Meanwhile, he had been reading widely and conceived many ideas for improving the techniques of spectroscopy. While still a schoolboy he had set up a room in his father's house as a primitive laboratory. In 1912 he married (Violet) Marjory, the charming and accomplished daughter of Lt.-Colonel W. H. Sawyer, and moved -- with his laboratory in tow -- to his London house, on Gilbert Street. Theirs was an exceptionally happy partnership, which lasted for 57 years, during which they were never separated for more than a few days. Spectroscopy research: 1913-1928 After 1913 a steady stream of papers came from Merton's private laboratory, in which he assembled the latest spectroscopic equipment. His early work was on the absorption spectra of solutions, but he soon changed to the spectra of gases and to astrophysics, which were to be the main fields of his investigations. His early papers were distinguished by the beauty and accuracy of his experimental techniques. In 1916 he obtained his DSc from Oxford and was appointed lecturer in spectroscopy at King's College London. In the same year his first joint paper with his friend J. W. Nicholson appeared. It was a fortunate chance which brought together Nicholson's brilliant mathematical analysis and Merton's experimental skill. The paper dealt with the broadening of spectral lines in a condensed discharge. By an ingenious technique Merton measured the discontinuities in the lines due to their partial breaking up into components under the influence of the magnetic field between adjacent atoms. The two men applied the same technique to the measurement of the spectra of hydrogen and helium, reproducing the distribution of intensity of some stellar lines in the laboratory for the first time. In 1919 Balliol elected Merton to a research fellowship and Oxford made him reader (from 1923 professor) in spectroscopy. He worked on a series of problems, usually with a young student as his assistant. He was elected to the Royal Society in 1920 and in 1922, with Sydney Baratt, gave the society's Bakerian lecture, on the spectrum of hydrogen. They cleared up a number of discrepancies in the secondary spectrum of hydrogen which were shown to be due to the hydrogen molecule, and they also showed the profound influence that traces of impurities can exert on gas spectra. In 1923 Merton left Oxford to live at Winforton House in Herefordshire, the estate he had acquired with 3 miles of salmon fishing on the Wye. He was a good shot and a most skilful fisherman. He transferred his laboratory to Winforton, so that he was able to combine a sporting life with his scientific research. The First 'Q' in MI6 The First World War scarcely interrupted his research activity. Having been rejected for active service on grounds of health, he was commissioned in 1916 as a lieutenant in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve. In 1915, he was handpicked by Sir Mansfield Smith-Cumming to work for MI6, the first such scientist to be appointed by the newly created organisation. He conducted various ink experiments with many different chemical solutions, including potassium permanganate, antipyrine and sodium nitrate. Spies were also advised to make invisible ink from semen. However, this was eventually abandoned because of complaints about the smell from those receiving the letters. His success in identifying the secret ink carried by German spies in their clothing, and inventing a new means of secret writing, won a mention in dispatches. Contribution to diffraction gratings There is a gap of nearly twenty years between Merton's scientific papers of 1928 and 1947. In this interval he was busy in the laboratory and was taking out patents for his inventions. Diffraction gratings were one of his lifelong interests and here his inventive genius best showed itself. The rarity and expense of good diffraction gratings led him to devise, in 1935, a method of copying them without loss of optical quality, by applying a thin layer of a cellulose ester solution to an original plane grating. When the solvent had evaporated he detached this pellicle and applied its grooved surface to a moist gelatine film on a glass plate. When dry, the gelatine bore a faithful record of the original rulings. In 1948 Merton made an important basic advance in the art of ruling diffraction gratings. Since 1880 these had been ruled groove by groove by the method used by Rowlands. In place of this, Merton ruled a very fine helix continuously on a steel cylinder which he then opened out upon a plane gelatine-coated surface by his copying method. No lathe could, however, rule a helix free from errors of pitch and these Merton eliminated by an ingenious device. It consisted of a ‘chasing lathe’ by which he cut a secondary helix on the same cylinder with a tool mounted on a ‘Merton nut’ lined with strips of cork pressed upon the primary lathe-cut helix. Periodic errors were thus averaged and eliminated by the elasticity of the cork. Merton handed these processes over to the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) for further development and they formed the basis of a considerable research programme. The ‘blazed’ gratings made by the Merton–NPL method were of great value in making available cheap infra-red spectrometers of high resolving power for research and industry, while long gratings ruled by this method came into use for engineering measurement and machine tool control. Experiments with cathode rays In the laboratory at his father's house Merton had bombarded various newly discovered phosphorescent powders with cathode rays. He was surprised to find that while all lit brilliantly, the afterglow was brief and feeble. By experiment, he discovered that this was because the excitation and emission lines of the spectra barely overlapped, and that by mixing suitable powders he could increase the afterglow. He realized that persistent afterglow could be got by a double layer of powders, in which the light emitted by the back layer excited the front layer, but as this technique seemed to have no practical use he forgot about it for thirty-three years, until 1938 when Sir Henry Tizard asked if he could achieve such a long afterglow. Merton was able to reply by return of post, and soon after was asked to join the air defence committee where he learned that his discovery had made possible the two-layer long- persistence radar screens which helped to bring victory in the Battle of Britain. His other wartime inventions included a black paint which reduced the proportion of light reflected from bombers in a searchlight to less than one per cent; the use of nitrous oxide in the fuel to accelerate fighter aircraft; and a diffraction rangefinder for fighters, which was used against doodlebugs. Treasurer of the Royal Society From 1939 to 1956 Merton was treasurer of the Royal Society, where his knowledge and experience of business were of considerable benefit. He formed a committee of experts to control its finances, and it was on his initiative that charitable bodies were given power to invest in equities, where they had previously been limited to gilt-edged stock. The income of all the society's funds showed a large increase during his treasurership.Hartley, H.; Gabor, D. (1970), pp.435–436 Art collection In 1930 John, the eldest of the Mertons' five sons, brought home the drawing prize from Eton and this proved a turning point in both his and his father's lives. It awoke in Merton some latent interest and he spent months in Italy with his son seeing all the great collections of Renaissance paintings. He began to make a remarkable collection of pictures of the period 1450-1520\\\\. From 1944 until his death he was a member of the scientific advisory board of the National Gallery, and its chairman from 1957 to 1965. He was also a trustee of the gallery, and of the National Portrait Gallery from 1955 to 1962. Merton was knighted in 1944 and in 1956 was appointed KBE due to his achievements as a treasurer of the Royal Academy.Hartley, H.; Gabor, D. (1970). p.436 He was awarded the Holweck Prize in 1951 and the Rumford medal of the Royal Society in 1958. In making his collection Sir Thomas followed his own interests and every work in it represents the personal taste of its owner, be the subject sacred or secular. As most of the works belong to the period of 1450 to 1520, the collection has great homogeneity and, in spite of the self- imposed limit of time, great diversity of subjects and techniques. No picture has been admitted merely because of size or with the intention of filling a certain space, but each has been selected for its pigmentary quality and with the determination to exclude anything that falls short of a high standard of perfection. Preference is given to portraits which in expression, deportment and costume, convey a very clear idea of the life, taste and colour of their period... Next come the group of devotional pictures on a small scale, intended originally for the privacy of the home rather than public worship... A few pictures fascinate by their narrative as the predella by Fungai or the three Cassoni as do the drawings by being preparatory studies for the more elaborate works. Twenty-two of the works, including drawings, were Italian, and ten of the northern schools. Merton's instinctive connoisseurship is indicated by the distinction of so many of his acquisitions. The clou of his Italian pictures was the Botticelli Portrait of a Young Man holding a Medallion, now on loan to the National Gallery of Art, Washington, which had been in the Newborough collection:Hartley, H.; Gabor, D. (1970), 434 this cost £17,000 in 1941. He owned cassone panels formerly in the collections of Otto H. Kahn and Lord Crawford, as well as Fungai's predella panel of the Martyrdom of Saint Clement, now reunited with an erstwhile companion in the City Art Gallery, York. The Madonna and Child with a Donor by Bartolommeo Montagna, now in the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool, is one of the most beautiful of that Vicentine master's creations and was the finest picture from the collection of Dr. Alfred Mond to be withheld from his bequest to the National Gallery. Signorelli's exceptional chalk study of a young warrior was sold by private treaty through Christie's, also to the Walker Art Gallery, in 1980. Of the northern pictures seven were portraits, the earliest being the Portrait of a Man formerly believed to be Guillaume Fillastre, long on loan to the National Gallery, now thought to be by a close follower of Rogier van der Weyden: purchased for £18,500 in 1940, this was sold in lieu of taxation through Christie's in 1987 and is now in the Courtauld Institute. The Behams catalogued below, which Scharf's erroneously ascribed to Mielich, were appropriately complemented by portraits by two of the artist's German contemporaries, Cranach and Hans Krell. Sir Thomas knew how important a contribution frames could make to the impact of his pictures, and in this respect was well served by Pollak, the framer who was admired by other major collectors of his generation. Some sense of what pictures meant to Merton is suggested in two passages in the notebook in which he recorded certain thoughts. \\"'Signal to noise ratio' is a term often used in physics. In fact it applies to everything we try to understand and measure, from the precision with which the deflection of a galvanometer can be read to the amount we can grasp of a conversation at a cocktail party, where the signal is what someone is saying to us and the noise is the integrated chatter of the other guests. It applies also to the fine arts. In what is perhaps one the greatest of all works of art, Michelangelo's Pietà in St. Peter's, it is nearly all signal and no noise, while in the work of the action painters it is all noise and no signal. There is nothing new in the products of the action painters. Leonardo da Vinci in his notes says that 'if you look at any walls spotted with various stains or with a mixture of different kinds of stones, if you are about to invent some scene you will be able to see in it a resemblance to different landscapes adorned with mountains etc., etc., and an infinite number of things which you can reduce into separate and well-conceived forms.'\\" \\"In these days of 'Do-it-yourself' we are expected to 'reduce into separate and well- conceived forms' ourselves. Some of us prefer to have it done for us by a great artist.\\" His collection showed that Sir Thomas could fairly be stated to have admired great artists. But his desire for possession was not unlimited: \\"Pictures are like women. There are quite a number of them which one can admire without wanting to live with them.\\" Later life In 1947 Merton bought Stubbings House, at Maidenhead Thicket, Berkshire. Its spacious rooms made an appropriate setting for his collection of pictures. As a man of considerable wealth, he maintained what was probably the last private physics laboratory in Britain. Papers and patents continued to appear, based on his researches there. In 1957 he had several serious operations and thereafter he rarely left his home, where he died on 10 October 1969.

Created in 1952 by Robert Kanigher of Wonder Woman fame and artist Alex Toth, Rex has sometimes been compared to Superman's dog Krypto, who was created three years later. While the two canine crime fighters do share some similarities, they are decidedly different. Rex shares his name with a canine film actor \\"Rex the Wonder Dog\\", from numerous silent films of the 1920s. Publication history Rex the Wonder Dog first starred in his own bi-monthly series, The Adventures of Rex the Wonder Dog #1 - 46 (January/February 1952 - September/October 1959), titled Rex the Wonder Dog for issues #1 and #2. The series was written by Robert Kanigher, and was illustrated for the first three issues by Alex Toth. From issue #2 (March/April 1952) almost every issue had one Rex story written by Kanigher and one written by John Broome. From issue #4, the stories were drawn by Gil Kane and mostly inked by Bernard Sachs; although from issue #29 (September/October 1956) a few issues had scripts by Bob Haney instead of Kanigher. Gil Kane also drew all of the distinctive covers. The title was cancelled after issue #46 (Nov-Dec 1959). After the cancellation, Rex did not appear again for another 18 years, until he was re- introduced by writer Steve Englehart in Justice League of America #144 (July 1977), a flashback issue to 1960 which featured a number of minor 1950s DC Comics characters that had once had their own series. After this there were only sporadic appearances: a 'Whatever happened to ...' tale in DC Comics Presents #35 (July 1981) written by Mike Tiefenbacher with art by Gil Kane, Secret Origins #48 (April 1990), The Flash vol. 2 #46 - 47, (January - February 1991), Green Lantern, vol. 3 #30 - 31 (October 1992) and the linked The Flash #70, November 1992, and Guy Gardner: Warrior #29 (March 1995). Rex then had a supporting role in Superboy and The Ravers (September 1996 - March 1998), and later Day of Vengeance: Infinite Crisis Special #1 (March 2006), which led directly into Rex making a number of appearances in Shadowpact (July 2006 - July 2008). Fictional character biography Rex is a white German Shepherd Dog who spent his early years in the U.S. Army's K-9 Corps, alongside his brother, Pooch. Early in his training it became apparent that Rex had great potential, which resulted in Dr. Anabolus selecting him as a test subject for a super-soldier serum. After receiving an injection of the serum, Rex found himself endowed with great strength, speed, stamina, and intelligence. Dr. Anabolus was killed by a Nazi spy soon after, and as Anabolus left no records, this led to Rex being the only dog of his kind.Secret Origins #48 (April 1990) Rex served during World War II, acting during the Italian campaign and earning an unspecified medal for saving his handler Lieutenant Dennis from a German patrol,The Adventures of Rex the Wonder Dog #4 (July/August 1952) and later receiving a Silver Star for saving POWs.The Adventures of Rex the Wonder Dog #5 (September/October 1952) He and then Captain, later Major, Dennis followed this by serving in the Pacific campaign against Japan,The Adventures of Rex the Wonder Dog #8 (March/April 1953)The Adventures of Rex the Wonder Dog #9 (May/June 1953) then later in Korea.The Adventures of Rex the Wonder Dog #6 (November/December 1952)The Adventures of Rex the Wonder Dog #7 (January/February 1953) After his army career, Rex was adopted by Major Dennis and his family.Rex the Wonder Dog #1 (January/February 1952) Not long after moving into his new home, Rex began a new career as a crime solver when Major Dennis's son Phillip was accused of murder and, when the police were unable to solve the crime, Rex succeeded in finding all the requisite clues to clear Phillip's name. Soon after, he was made an honorary Forest Ranger and became a Hollywood stunt dog.Rex the Wonder Dog #2 (March/April 1952) In most of his subsequent adventures he would be seen accompanying Phillip's younger brother, Danny. Over the next few years, as well as solving a never-ending series of burglaries, robberies, murders and other crimes, becoming a film star and a circus actor, and daring natural disasters such as forest fires and thick snow, Rex also managed to survive attacks from lions, wolves, bears, panthers, and even octopi (twice).The Adventures of Rex the Wonder Dog #27 (May/June 1956)The Adventures of Rex the Wonder Dog #42 (November/December 1958) He could ride a horse, or bull,The Adventures of Rex the Wonder Dog #19 (January/February 1955) and proved an expert bullfighter.The Adventures of Rex the Wonder Dog #36 (November/December 1957) He often operated small appliances such as cameras,The Adventures of Rex the Wonder Dog #3 (May/June 1952)The Adventures of Rex the Wonder Dog #24 (November/December 1955) swung on ropes and vines to save people. Many of Rex's adventures took place in the American Midwest, but a number happened in Europe, Asia and especially Africa (largely as a result of Major Dennis being involved in various archaeological expeditions). Rex added to his military medals when he was decorated for bravery by the French Foreign Legion in North Africa,The Adventures of Rex the Wonder Dog #26 (March/April 1956) after one of several adventures with them, and added further to his awards when he became an honorary Native American Indian Chief, and an Honorary Fire Chief. Occasionally Rex was forced to perform heroic acts in strange circumstances. Wearing very cool protective shades he once witnessed a nuclear explosion, then fought the Tyrannosaurus rex and pterodactyl that appeared from an underground world as a result of the seismic shift,The Adventures of Rex the Wonder Dog #11 (September/October 1953) and fought frozen mammoths on several occasions. In Australia he met an alien, Xstar, and helped him recapture an escaped creatureThe Adventures of Rex the Wonder Dog #39 (May/June 1958) he soon met Xstar again to solve an outer space crimeThe Adventures of Rex the Wonder Dog #41 (September/October 1958) becoming 'Wonder Dog of Earth' in the process. While staying with a scientist friend of the family, John Rayburn, who created a formula to shrink living beings to microscopic size. They had a number of adventures at a much-reduced sizeThe Adventures of Rex the Wonder Dog #43 (January/February 1959) in a sub-atomic world.The Adventures of Rex the Wonder Dog #44 (November/December 1959) Pre-empting Ray Palmer, The Atom by over a year, using the formula in reverse, they had several adventures in a giant-sized 'super-atomic world'.The Adventures of Rex the Wonder Dog #45 - 46 (January/February - March/April 1960) Around this time, Rex was involved in thwarting an attempted invasion of Earth by Martians with the future founding members of the Justice League of America: The Flash, Superman, Wonder Woman, Batman and Green Lantern, among others.Justice League of America #144 (July 1977) After this, he and Danny Dennis became a circus act for many years,DC Comics Presents #35 (July 1981) where Detective Chimp came to see them and got involved in an adventure with a now obviously aging Rex. Taken to the Caribbean, Rex and Detective Chimp accidentally drank from the lost Fountain of Youth and were both rejuvenated. Some years later, Lt. Colonel Daniel Dennis and Rex became part of a U.S. moon landing team, Rex becoming 'America's first Wonder Dog on The Moon' in the process. By 1991, it became clear that more than a new lease of life had happened to Rex. While saving the world from Gorilla Grodd, 'the dog at the heart of the world, the dog for whom the universe has waited' (as he now described himself) confidently communicated with the newly sentient animals of Central City, and persuaded them to fight against Grodd.The Flash (vol. 2) #46-47 (January - February 1991) No reason was given for this new ability, but shortly afterwards Rex joined 'The Bureau of Amplified Animals', an organisation of animals with abnormally high intellect run by Detective Chimp to help mankind, and was instrumental in defeating Grodd again;Green Lantern (vol. 2) #30-31 (October 1992)The Flash #70 (November 1992) also revealing that he can speak, and possesses 'the knowledge of force of mind, and how to use it'. Detective Chimp later explained that both his and Rex's new powers were another effect of drinking from the Fountain of Youth.Day of Vengeance #4 (September 2005) =Working without Danny= At some point after this, it appears that Danny and Rex parted company, as the now ageing Danny does not feature in Rex's later adventures. After being (accidentally) involved in a fight between almost every DC hero and many villains at the opening of Guy Gardner's bar 'Warriors',Guy Gardner, Warrior #29 (March 1995) Rex later became attached to Hero Cruz (also known as HERO) sometime before he became a member of 'Superboy and The Ravers', and lived with him in Metropolis. Hero, owner of the \\"H-Dial\\" from 'Dial H for Hero', later made reference to having discovered Rex imprisoned in a metal box. It is known that Hero found the H-Dial and other heroic relics after breaking into a weapons cache owned by the villainous Scavenger;Superboy and the Ravers #5 (January 1997) but it is unknown whether, although likely that, Rex had previously been captured and was found during the same raid. Rex's part in the Ravers adventures was minor, and showed little of his powers. How long he stayed with Hero afterwards is unknown, but Rex was next seen, without Hero, assisting the mystical team Shadowpact in battling the Seven Deadly Enemies of Man, which had been loosed in Gotham City.Day of Vengeance: Infinite Crisis Special (March 2006) During this event Rex was taken over by the entity known as 'Sloth' - a situation rectified by his friend Detective Chimp. Shortly afterwards it's confirmed that Rex held a place in DCs pantheon of mystical powered characters when first he was called as one of Earth's most powerful magical characters to aid The Spectre in saving the Universe.Infinite Crisis #6 (May 2006) Soon after he is one of the many agents tasked by the Phantom Stranger to monitor a mystical bubble that contained the town of Riverrock, Wyoming and the newly formed Shadowpact vowing to stay until Detective Chimp was freed, and as a result ended up staying a year. The Shadowpact free themselves through other means.Shadowpact #1-3 (July - September 2006) He later deliberately allows himself to be influenced by The Huntsman's Hellhound Pack to infiltrate them,Shadowpact #7 (January 2007) but became trapped with the pack, and spent a considerable amount of time using his intelligence to become their leader, although he eventually aided Shadowpact to beat The Huntsman and return to Earth.Shadowpact #20 (February 2008) =Relatives= His brother, Billy, affectionately known as 'Pooch', became the mascot of Gunner and Sarge of 'Losers' during World War II. His adventures were documented in 'Our Fighting Forces' and several series of 'The Losers' for DC Comics and the Vertigo imprint. Without Rex's powers, Pooch followed Gunner and Sarge through thick and thin, was wounded multiple times and received the honorary rank of Sergeant. He perished alongside Gunner, Sarge, and The Losers near the end of World War II.Losers Special (1985) An alternate-universe story places the death of those heroes on Dinosaur Island. Powers and abilities Originally Army trained, Rex has augmented abilities far beyond those of normal dogs, with the ability to communicate to humans and all animals, together with exceptional strength, speed, stamina, and intelligence and an understanding of the world around him that is at least comparable to most humans. Rex has revitalized health and longevity stemming from a drink from the Fountain of Youth. He has also exhibited unspecified other enhanced powers as a result of this, and is acknowledged as a member of DC's magical and mystical community. In other mediaTelevision= *In the animated series Batman Beyond, Terry McGinnis once refers to Bruce Wayne's Great Dane, Ace, as \\"Wonder Dog\\" - a nod to both Rex and Ace the Bat-Hound, as well as to Marvin White's Wonder Dog from Super Friends. *The character Wolf from Young Justice is modeled after Rex. Other information *Rex was based on the character Streak the Wonder Dog who became Green Lantern's dog sidekick in 1941 and eventually replaced the superhero as the cover star of his own magazine. *Dr. Anabolus and his formula were all created for Rex's origin in Secret Origins #48, in a humorous retcon written by Gerard Jones which parodied the origin of Marvel Comics character Captain America. Despite the parody tone of the tale, the story has not been written out of Rex's history since. ReferencesExternal links * GCD: Rex the Wonder Dog * Rex the Wonder Dog at Don Markstein's Toonopedia.

It premiered on September 10, 1966 on CBS, and ran for two seasons on Saturday mornings. Overview The program contained two segments, which each served as a middle ground between Hanna-Barbera's traditional early output and its superhero-based late-1960s cartoons. Each episode would feature two segments with The Impossibles, and Frankenstein, Jr. in between. * Frankenstein, Jr.: Taking place in Civic City, boy scientist Buzz Conroy (voiced by Dick Beals) and his father Professor Conroy (voiced by John Stephenson) fight supervillains with the aid of a powerful heroic robot named \\"Frankenstein, Jr.\\" (voiced by Ted Cassidy). Buzz built \\"Frankie\\" and activated him through an energy ring. * The Impossibles: The title characters are a trio of superheroes (Multi-Man, Fluid-Man, and Coil-Man) who pose undercover as a Beatlesesque rock music band. The characters' names are descriptive of their powers: Multi-Man (voiced by Don Messick) can create identical copies of himself; Coil-Man (voiced by Hal Smith) can form into a super-springy coil; and Fluid-Man (voiced by Paul Frees) can transform his body into any fluid. The heroes receive assignments from \\"Big D\\" (also voiced by Frees), who contacts them via a receiver in the base of Coil-Man's left-handed guitar. During the development of the show, this group was called \\"The Incredibles,\\" but was changed to \\"The Impossibles\\" by the time of production. The team's pre-production name was later given to the superhero family from the 2004 Disney/Pixar film of the same name. The show was the target of complaints about violence in children's television, and was canceled in 1968 (first-run episodes had already ceased a year earlier). The Frankenstein, Jr. segments were later recycled in the 1976 series Space Ghost and Frankenstein, Jr., which aired on NBC from November 27, 1976 to September 3, 1977, replacing the canceled Big John, Little John. Voice cast * Dick Beals as Buzz Conroy * Ted Cassidy as Frankenstein, Jr. * John Stephenson as Professor Conroy * Paul Frees as Fluid Man, Big D * Don Messick as Multi Man * Hal Smith as Coil Man List of episodesFrankenstein, Jr.The Impossibles=Home video On April 26, 2011, Warner Home Video (via the Warner Archive Collection) released Frankenstein, Jr. and The Impossibles: The Complete Series on DVD in region 1 as part of their Hanna–Barbera Classics Collection. This is a Manufacture-on-Demand (MOD) release, available exclusively through Warner's online store and Amazon.com. Other appearances * Buzz Conroy and Frankenstein, Jr. appeared in the Yogi's Space Race episode \\"Race Through the Planet of the Monsters\\". Adaptations Fantastic Four #1 A single issue of a Frankenstein Jr. and the Impossibles comic was released by Gold Key Comics in 1966 as a tie-in to the TV series, and the contents were reprinted in The Impossibles Annual by Atlas Publishing & Distributing Co. Ltd, UK in 1968. The two Frankenstein Jr. comic stories were titled \\"The Image Invasion\\" and \\"Frankenstein Jr. Meets the Flea Man\\". A new text-based story, specially written for the annual, was \\"A Spook in his Wheel\\". The character reappeared in the comic Hanna-Barbera Presents #8 published by Archie Comics in 1996. The front cover featured Frankenstein, Jr. battling the Impossibles in an homage to the front cover of the original Fantastic Four #1 by Marvel Comics. A Big Little Book titled Frankenstein, Jr.: The Menace of the Heartless Monster was published in 1968.http://www.biglittlebooks.com/frankensteinjr.html The Impossibles' heroic identities were re-used for a later Hanna-Barbera production, The Super Globetrotters (which also featured a similar concept—in this case, the famous Harlem Globetrotters as undercover superheroes): * Nate Branch's heroic identity was alternately known as \\"Fluid Man\\" or \\"Liquid Man\\", with powers (and a flippered costume) similar to the Impossibles' Fluid-Man. * \\"Twiggy\\" Sanders became \\"Spaghetti Man\\", with coiling and stretching abilities similar to Coil-Man. * \\"Geese\\" Ausbie as \\"Multi Man\\" had virtually identical powers as his Impossibles counterpart and a similar costume. In 2016, Buzz and Frankenstein, Jr. and the Impossibles played a major role in the DC Comics series Future Quest, that also featured characters from various animated series produced by Hanna-Barbera such as Jonny Quest, Space Ghost, The Herculoids, Birdman and the Galaxy Trio and Moby Dick and Mighty Mightor.In this series, the team gained a new female member named Cobalt.

The Bible Institute of South Africa is an evangelical Bible college located in Kalk Bay, a suburb of Cape Town on the False Bay coast of the Cape Peninsula, South Africa. The college has students from all over Africa, as well as from Europe, Asia and North America. Looking down over Kalk Bay village and harbour from Boyes Drive BISA is a non-denominational bible training college. Staff and students are drawn from a range of church affiliations in SA and internationally, rather than one single denomination, as would be expected in a Seminary. The method and content of study is Christocentric and employs a historic Protestant and Reformational hermeneutic in the interpretation of the Bible. The teaching ethos is two-fold, not only to impart knowledge, but to take that knowledge and use it in the development of the skills and character needed by the student to be effective in life and service. The outcome for each student is to be able to think rationally, clearly and critically about life issues in a way that is biblical and sustainable in a context of serving others in multi- faith, multi-cultural and international communities. The college functions as a community in residence, sharing tuition, meals, assemblies and prayer times together. Since its founding in 1923 BISA has trained over two thousand men and women in a variety of subjects including Hermeneutics, Biblical and Systematic Theology, the Doctrines of Scripture, Old and New Testament Studies, Ontology, Christian Thinking and Hebrew & Greek bible languages.  History  In the early part of the 20th century formal theological education in South Africa was only available in the universities. In the 1920s three church leaders, the Rev. Marsh, Rev.Douglas and Rev. Dr J. R. L. Kingon FRSE, were concerned with the commitment to bible teaching in the theological departments of the time. With this in mind they proposed to endow a theological professorship at one of the South African universities, but because of the prevailing liberal theological influence, their wish was frustrated. They subsequently planned to establish a college where the evangelical doctrines of the bible would be taught. In 1923, they founded the Bible Institute of South Africa in Mowbray in the Cape Peninsula. Their intention was to create academic training of a high quality – at a degree level – in order to provide Churches in South Africa with men and women equipped to meet the challenge of a post-war world. Immediately prior to World War II the Institute moved to Kalk Bay, and has developed into the present campus where the BTh programme is accredited by the South African Council on Higher Education for contact and distance modes.  Courses and Accreditation  The college has several hundred students involved in a selection of courses. The residential course comprises a Bachelor of Theology, BTh (CHE accredited) and a Christian Foundations Gap-Year (not accredited). Programmes for off-campus students include a correspondence-based Distance Learning Programme - a Bachelor of Theology, BTh (CHE accredited) as well as a part- time Christian Leadership Programme, the CLP (not accredited). The residential courses include weekly practical ministry experience as well as a one-week Community Outreach, held annually in March. The BISA Winter School held annually in June/July is open to church leaders and workers and offers courses taught by international academics and researchers in their specific fields. Guest speakers have included Darrell Bock Doug Moo, Craig Blomberg, Greg Cook George H Guthrie and Bill Mounce. Two colleagues travel annually to Africa to lecture in the CLP programme on campus; Robert W. Yarbrough and Pastor Bill Shields Classes are held on campus in the residential programme and by distance in the Distance Learning Programme. Both programmes use the Learning Management System CANVAS in addition to specifically developed software B-SIS online. In March 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic and following RSA presidential directives, all courses migrated to online tuition, until the cessation of lockdown. The Bible Institute of South Africa is registered with the Department of Higher Education and Training until 31 December 2022 as a private higher education institution under the Act. Registration certificate No. 2018/HE08/002.  Principalship  Since its founding year 1923, the Bible Institute has appointed eleven Principals – *Alfred Daintree (1923–38); *Joseph Ward (1939); *Arthur Taylor (1940–45); *Stuart Law (1945–53); *Sandy Gilfillan(1953-1959); *Murdo Gordon (1960–81); *Clive Tyler (1981-1994); *Bryan Williams (1995-1999); *Tom Austin (2000–04); *Raymond Potgieter (2006–11); *Daniel Simango (2014 - to present date) The college Faculty is made up of full-time and part-time lecturers from South Africa and other countries. The Institute entered into a partnership agreement with Mission to the World in 1997 \\\\- the missionary sending agency of the Presbyterian Church in America – in terms of which a number of MTW teachers have joined the Faculty. The Bible Institute of South Africa partners with several Missions Agencies giving students both pre and post-graduation opportunities to work cross culturally in society. The Principal, Zimbabwe born Dr Daniel Simango, holds a Licentiate in Theology (LTh) from the Bible Institute of South Africa (2000), a BA in Theology (Cum Laude), a BA Honours in Theology from Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education (2002), and a MA in Old Testament from North West University (2006). In 2011, Daniel was awarded a PhD in Old Testament from North-West University. He lectures Old Testament and Hebrew courses to under-graduate students and supervises post-graduate students in Old Testament studies.

In fall 1965, the show aired as two independent half-hour programs. The Atom Ant Show featured the tiny superhero Atom Ant, with additional segments Precious Pupp and The Hillbilly Bears. The Secret Squirrel Show featured the master spy Secret Squirrel, backed up with Squiddly Diddly and Winsome Witch. In the winter, the shows combine into an hour-long format, The Atom Ant/Secret Squirrel Show. For the series' final NBC run under the Atom Ant/Secret Squirrel title, the show was one half-hour long. Production On September 12, 1965, the series had an hour-long primetime preview on NBC called The World of Secret Squirrel and Atom Ant. The Hillbilly Bears cartoon segments were later repeated during the second season of The Banana Splits Adventure Hour (1969–1970), and all 52 Atom Ant and Secret Squirrel half-hours were syndicated as part of The Banana Splits and Friends Show, an umbrella title for a package combining episodes of several different Hanna-Barbera series (the other series included The Banana Splits Adventure Hour, The New Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, and The Adventures of Gulliver). Segments The program contained six segments: * Atom Ant: A cartoon about a superheroic ant (voiced by Howard Morris). When he flew, he used his catchphrase \\"Up and at'em, Atom Ant!\\" * Secret Squirrel: The adventures of a secret agent squirrel (voiced by Mel Blanc) and his trusty assistant Morocco Mole (voiced by Paul Frees). * Squiddly Diddly: A cartoon about a friendly anthropomorphic squid (voiced by Paul Frees) in his quest for stardom while trying to avoid being foiled by Chief Winchley (voiced by John Stephenson). * Precious Pupp: A cartoon about a dog (voiced by Don Messick) and his elderly lady mistress Granny Sweet (voiced by Janet Waldo). He is characterized by a sneaky, wheezy laugh, making him a possible precursor to Muttley from 1968's Wacky Races and one of its two spin-offs, 1969's Dastardly and Muttley in Their Flying Machines. * The Hillbilly Bears: A situation comedy (inspired by The Beverly Hillbillies) about the Rugg family of hillbilly bears consisting of Paw Rugg (voiced by Henry Corden), Maw Rugg (voiced by Jean Vander Pyl), Floral Rugg (also voiced by Jean Vander Pyl), and Shag Rugg (voiced by Don Messick). * Winsome Witch: A cartoon about a friendly, yet somewhat inept, witch named Winsome W. Witch (the \\"W\\" stood for Wacky) (voiced by Jean Vander Pyl). Winnie's catchphrase when casting a spell was \\"Ippity - Pippity - Pow!\\".

He is known as the lead singer and guitarist for heavy metal band Prong, which he founded in New York City in 1986, as well as the guitarist for heavy metal band Danzig intermittently since 1996 and full-time since 2008. Biography Ministry in May, 2008 In the late 1980s, Victor worked as a sound engineer at the trendy venue CBGB in New York City. After the release of Rude Awakening in 1996, Prong disbanded and Victor moved to Los Angeles, but later revived the band to release new Prong records. He took a break from Prong during which Victor worked alongside rock musicians including Rob Zombie, Marilyn Manson, Trent Reznor and Glenn Danzig. Since 2012's Carved into Stone, Prong have been very active again, releasing albums and touring relentlessly. 2013 saw the band release their Official Bootleg -- Unleashed in the West album which featured re-recordings of 17 classic Prong tracks. The next studio album, Ruining Lives was released in 2014, and 2015 saw the band release their first ever covers album entitled Songs from the Black Hole. Victor is also working with Glenn Danzig on his upcoming Danzig album. He is also part of the hard rock, heavy metal, hardcore punk and punk rock supergroup Teenage Time Killers. Victor has toured and recorded with Ministry and Danzig. He has also provided guest vocals for the Soulfly album Omen. He contributed to the Argyle Park album Misguided, and wrote the main riff for the song \\"Doomsayer,\\" which he later used on the Prong song \\"Controller.\\" Equipment Victor has been endorsed by Schecter Guitar Research ever since reuniting with Prong, using both an S-1 and C-1 in early live performances. He would later on start using their Devil guitar, which would be the basis for his second signature model. In 2013, his first signature model would be released, based on the newly introduced Banshee series, but with a mahogany body and neck, ebony fretboard, EMG pickups, and custom inlays. In 2015, his second signature model was introduced, based on the Devil series guitar and with similar specifications to his first signature model, but with black nickel hardware, and a single 12th-fret Prong inlay. Before using Schecter, Victor relied on several guitars, most famously a Charvel Surfcaster. Other guitars he used around that era were a Charvel LSX, Charvel Predator, and Gibson SG Custom. Around the release of Rude Awakening, and before Prong's breakup, he was endorsed by Fernandes Guitars, using both a Vertigo and Deuce WS model.

History The Armsel Striker was designed by an ex-Rhodesian national, Hilton R. Walker, in 1981. Walker subsequently emigrated to South Africa, bringing with him the design for the Striker shotgun. His shotgun became a success, and was exported to various parts of the world. Even though it was successful, the shotgun still had its flaws. The rotary cylinder-type magazine was bulky, had a long reload time, and the basic action was not without certain flaws. Walker redesigned his weapon in 1989, removing the cylinder rotation mechanism, and adding an auto cartridge ejection system. The new shotgun was named the Protecta. A copy of the Striker was made by the US gunmaker Cobray and marketed as the SWD Street Sweeper from 1989 through 1993. Design and features The weapon's action is similar to that of a revolver, using a rotating cylinder. Since the Striker uses a conventional double action only trigger and a very large and heavy cylinder (compared to handguns), Walker added a pre-wound clock-work spring to revolve the magazine which proved to make loading the weapon slow, in exchange for a shorter and lighter trigger pull. The design was changed into having a cocking lever on the right side of the barrel. The first designs were criticized as having a slow and cumbersome firing mechanism. The shells had to be individually loaded and then the drum wound by a clockwork mechanism. Shell ejection was by an ejector rod along the right hand side of the barrel. The last version has the clockwork winding mechanism removed, the ejector rod has been replaced by an automatic ejection system and in the rod's place is a cocking lever that winds the drum automatically. The Striker design has a twelve-round magazine capacity and short overall length. Compact variants have 7 rounds. Availability in the United States The Striker and Streetsweeper were declared destructive devices under the National Firearms Act with no sporting purpose by Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen in 1994 and their transfer and ownership is regulated by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). Variants *Armsel Striker—this is Hilton Walker's first design. *Armsel Protecta—An improved version of the Armsel Striker. Readying the weapon for firing was simplified and the weapon's reliability was improved. *Armsel Protecta Bulldog—An extremely shortened, stockless version of the Armsel Protecta. It is intended for building entry and vehicular duties. *Sentinel Arms Striker-12—A fully licensed and improved copy of the Armsel Striker for the American market made by Sentinel Arms Co. It was available with an 18-inch barrel and a 7-inch stockless version. *Cobray/SWD Streetsweeper—A lower-end clone of the Armsel Striker, having a limited parts commonality to the original weapons system. *Cobray/SWD Ladies Home Companion—A reduced caliber version of the Streetsweeper. The triggergroup is attached to a .410 bore or .45/70 Government drum and barrel.

Shooting is performed with the hand directly, as opposed to deck shuffleboard's use of cue sticks.  Tables  Table Shuffleboard player Shuffleboard tables vary in length, usually within a , and are at least wide. Tables are intended to be kept flat, but any given table may have its own slight concave or convex condition, adding an extra challenge. In order to decrease friction, the table is periodically sprinkled liberally with tiny, salt-like beads of silicone (often referred to as shuffleboard wax even though silicone is not a wax, or sometimes as shuffleboard sand, or shuffleboard cheese, due to its visual similarity to grated cheese). These beads act like ball bearings, letting a puck slide down the table a great distance with only a slight push. There are many different speeds of wax to choose from to match the player's skill level. Powdered wax is made of silicone, cornmeal and sometimes compressed walnut shells. The longer the table, the greater speed of wax you need. Faster speed waxes have more silicone and less cornmeal.\\"Table Shuffleboard Powder Wax Guide\\" Each end of the table is divided into three scoring sections by straight lines across the width of the table. The scoring sections extend from the very edge of either end of the table towards the middle of the table, covering approximately one-third of the length of the table. The outer scoring section, at the end of the table, is labeled with the number \\"3\\" in the middle (for \\"3 points\\"). The next section is adjacent to this section, of equal length (6 inches), and is labeled with a \\"2.\\" The final section, \\"1\\", is adjacent to section \\"2.\\" This section continues all the way to the foul line. The foul line measures 6 feet from the end of the table. The center third of the table is unmarked. The line that separates the center third of the table and the beginning of the \\"1 point\\" section is called the \\"foul line\\" (a weight which does not pass the foul line closest to the player is removed from the table for the round). The table is surrounded by a gutter, or \\"alley\\"; pucks that accidentally fall, or are knocked, into a gutter are out of play for the rest of the round. Game playScoring= Table shuffleboard scoring Players take turns sliding, or \\"shuffling,\\" the weights to the opposite end of the board, trying to score points, bump opposing pucks off the board, or protect their own pucks from bump-offs. Points are scored by getting a weight to stop in one of the numbered scoring areas. A weight has to completely cross the zone line to count as a full score (if a weight is partially in zone 2 and 3 the weight's score is 2). A weight that's hanging partially over the edge at the end of the table in the 3-point area, called a \\"hanger\\" (or sometimes a \\"shipper\\"), usually receives an extra point (count as 4). If a puck hangs off the end corner, it receives no additional scoring points other than being a 4 for hanging over the back edge of the board. Weights that haven't passed the foul line closest to the player are removed for the round. Pucks that fall off or are bumped off the table into the gutter are removed from play for the round. No points are tabulated until the end of the round. When all weights have been shuffled, the player with the puck closest to the far edge of the table takes points for all pucks that are ahead of their opponent's furthest shot. The other player does not take points. For example: there is a red puck in 3, a red in 1, a blue in 1, but not as close to the end as the red, and two red pucks in 1 but further away from the end of the table than the blue puck. Red player would receive 4 points for the first 2 pucks ahead of the blue and no points for the pucks behind the blue, blue player does not score. The player who scores will shoot first the next round. In 1974, Reginald Charles Gilchrist invented the digital scoring unit for table shuffleboards while president of Universal Shuffleboards, one of the companies he founded. =Object of the game= The objective of the game is to slide, by hand, all four of one's weights alternately against those of an opponent, so that they reach the highest scoring area without falling off the end of the board into the alley. Furthermore, a player's weight(s) must be farther down the board than his opponent's weight(s), in order to be in scoring position. This may be achieved either by knocking off the opponent's weight(s), or by outdistancing them. Horse collar, the most common form of the game, is played to either 15 or, more typically, 21. Below is an image of the weights on the board. Only the weights in front score.\\"Shuffleboard Table Game Rules\\" =One-on-one= In one-on-one, each player is assigned a color of puck (4 pucks per player). Play begins at one end of the table, and each player alternates shuffling one weight at a time down towards the opposite end of the table (which becomes the \\"scoring end\\" of the table), until all 8 pucks have been shuffled. Each player tries to either land his puck closest to the end of the table, knock the opponent's pucks off the table, knock their own puck into a higher scoring area, or position a puck so that it will block their opponent from being able to hit another puck off the table. This finishes the \\"round.\\" Play then continues from the other end of the table, where the pucks have come to rest. When a set number of points has been reached by a player (often 15 or 21), that player has won that \\"frame.\\" A \\"match\\" consists of a predetermined number of frames. =Teams= A set of pucks In two-on-two, teammates stand on the opposite end of the table and play every other round, shooting from alternating ends of the table (i.e. two games are effectively played at once, with team scores combined). Sometimes players will switch to the other end of the table between frames. An unofficial but common variation has all players at one end of the table. Each player will have 2 weights/shots per round. Teams alternate turns, with each teammate shooting every other turn. =Variations= While there are some official rules agreed upon by shuffleboard organizations, players should be aware that it can be a very informal and spontaneous game, and as such, regional variations and house rules abound. There are some differences by country, as well. In Canada, the game is played under rules approved by the Canadian Shuffleboard Congress. Except in certain tournaments, in one-on-one play, games are played to 15. Two-person teams compete until one team reaches 21 points. In both cases, a frame consists of four stones (pucks) per player. Variants and related gamesBankboard/Cushion Shuffleboard/Bumper Shuffleboard= A variant of table shuffleboard, more clearly related to billiards and air hockey, is bankboard (often simply called shuffleboard by its players), in which the player may bounce the puck off one of the rubber cushions or banks that run the length of both long sides of the table (in place of gutters), e.g. to go around an interfering puck. Bankboard tables are within the shorter range of table sizes (usually 12-13 ft long) and so can be useful for maximizing revenue per square foot of floorspace in a bar or other venue. =Sjoelen= A sjoelen board is called a sjoelbak. It features four scoring boxes, the value of each denoted by the number of dots or tacks above each box's entrance. A Dutch variation known as sjoelen, apparently influenced by bagatelle (a billiards offshoot and pinball ancestor), bar billiards, skeeball, miniature golf and related games, makes use of a long, unidirectional board placed on a table in which the goal is to slide 30 wooden pucks towards the end of the board and try to have them enter through small open doorways or arches into numbered scoring boxes. Each player has 3 sub-turns to get as many pucks in the scoring boxes. The boxes are numbered from left to right: 2, 3, 4 and 1. A notable rule is that for each set of pucks (a puck in every box) they count double so instead of 10 points for a set, the player will get 20 points for each set. The maximum score is 148 which is accomplished by getting 7 pucks in 2, 7 pucks in 3, 9 pucks in 4 and 7 pucks in 1. It totals to 7 × 20 + 4 + 4 = 148\\\\. However, if the player accomplishes the max score of 148 in less than 3 sub-turns, they are returned one puck for each sub-turn less, increasing the maximum possible score to either 152 (148 in 2 sub-turns) or 156 (148 in 1 sub-turn). The most famous manufacturers of sjoelbakken (sjoelen boards) are Homas, Heemskerk Sport and Schilte, who mass-produce the game for the continental European market and more recently American Sjoel with their branded Shool Game at shoolgame.com in the North American market. =Shove ha'penny= An even more miniaturized, related British game, with a much less elongated board and many more scoring zones, is played with coins and known as shove ha'penny. An evolutionary relationship between the game variants is uncertain. =Bonus Shuffle= In the 1979–1980 version of Beat the Clock which aired on CBS and was hosted by Monty Hall, the final round of the main game was called Bonus Shuffle, a game of table shuffleboard where the two teams attempted to throw disks to win cash from $300–$1,000. The team whose disk was the farthest won the game and the chance to play the Bonus Stunt for 10 times their Bonus Shuffle amount from $3,000–$10,000.

In general terms, a motor is a device that consumes energy in one form and converts it into motion or mechanical work; for example, many protein-based molecular motors harness the chemical free energy released by the hydrolysis of ATP in order to perform mechanical work. In terms of energetic efficiency, this type of motor can be superior to currently available man-made motors. One important difference between molecular motors and macroscopic motors is that molecular motors operate in the thermal bath, an environment in which the fluctuations due to thermal noise are significant.  Examples  Kinesin uses protein domain dynamics on nanoscales to walk along a microtubule. Some examples of biologically important molecular motors: * Cytoskeletal motors ** Myosins are responsible for muscle contraction, intracellular cargo transport, and producing cellular tension. ** Kinesin moves cargo inside cells away from the nucleus along microtubules, in anterograde transport. ** Dynein produces the axonemal beating of cilia and flagella and also transports cargo along microtubules towards the cell nucleus, in retrograde transport. * Polymerisation motors ** Actin polymerization generates forces and can be used for propulsion. ATP is used. ** Microtubule polymerization using GTP. ** Dynamin is responsible for the separation of clathrin buds from the plasma membrane. GTP is used. *Rotary motors: **FoF1-ATP synthase family of proteins convert the chemical energy in ATP to the electrochemical potential energy of a proton gradient across a membrane or the other way around. The catalysis of the chemical reaction and the movement of protons are coupled to each other via the mechanical rotation of parts of the complex. This is involved in ATP synthesis in the mitochondria and chloroplasts as well as in pumping of protons across the vacuolar membrane. ** The bacterial flagellum responsible for the swimming and tumbling of E. coli and other bacteria acts as a rigid propeller that is powered by a rotary motor. This motor is driven by the flow of protons across a membrane, possibly using a similar mechanism to that found in the Fo motor in ATP synthase. Molecular dynamics simulation of a synthetic molecular motor composed of three molecules in a nanopore (outer diameter 6.7 nm) at 250 K. * Nucleic acid motors: ** RNA polymerase transcribes RNA from a DNA template. ** DNA polymerase turns single-stranded DNA into double-stranded DNA. ** Helicases separate double strands of nucleic acids prior to transcription or replication. ATP is used. ** Topoisomerases reduce supercoiling of DNA in the cell. ATP is used. ** RSC and SWI/SNF complexes remodel chromatin in eukaryotic cells. ATP is used. ** SMC proteins responsible for chromosome condensation in eukaryotic cells. ** Viral DNA packaging motors inject viral genomic DNA into capsids as part of their replication cycle, packing it very tightly. Several models have been put forward to explain how the protein generates the force required to drive the DNA into the capsid; for a review, see . An alternative proposal is that, in contrast with all other biological motors, the force is not generated directly by the protein, but by the DNA itself. In this model, ATP hydrolysis is used to drive protein conformational changes that alternatively dehydrate and rehydrate the DNA, cyclically driving it from B-DNA to A-DNA and back again. A-DNA is 23% shorter than B-DNA, and the DNA shrink/expand cycle is coupled to a protein-DNA grip/release cycle to generate the forward motion that propels DNA into the capsid. * Enzymatic motors: **Catalase **Urease **Aldolase **Hexokinase **Phosphoglucose isomerase **Phosphofructokinase **Glucose Oxidase *Synthetic molecular motors have been created by chemists that yield rotation, possibly generating torque.  Theoretical considerations  Because the motor events are stochastic, molecular motors are often modeled with the Fokker–Planck equation or with Monte Carlo methods. These theoretical models are especially useful when treating the molecular motor as a Brownian motor.  Experimental observation  In experimental biophysics, the activity of molecular motors is observed with many different experimental approaches, among them: * Fluorescent methods: fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF). * Magnetic tweezers can also be useful for analysis of motors that operate on long pieces of DNA. * Neutron spin echo spectroscopy can be used to observe motion on nanosecond timescales. * Optical tweezers (not to be confused with molecular tweezers in context) are well-suited for studying molecular motors because of their low spring constants. * Scattering techniques: single particle tracking based on dark field microscopy or interferometric scattering microscopy (iSCAT) * Single-molecule electrophysiology can be used to measure the dynamics of individual ion channels. Many more techniques are also used. As new technologies and methods are developed, it is expected that knowledge of naturally occurring molecular motors will be helpful in constructing synthetic nanoscale motors.  Non- biological  Recently, chemists and those involved in nanotechnology have begun to explore the possibility of creating molecular motors de novo. These synthetic molecular motors currently suffer many limitations that confine their use to the research laboratory. However, many of these limitations may be overcome as our understanding of chemistry and physics at the nanoscale increases. One step toward understanding nanoscale dynamics was made with the study of catalyst diffusion in the Grubb's catalyst system. Other systems like the nanocars, while not technically motors, are also illustrative of recent efforts towards synthetic nanoscale motors. Other non-reacting molecules can also behave as motors. This has been demonstrated by using dye molecules that move directionally in gradients of polymer solution through favorable hydrophobic interactions. Another recent study has shown that dye molecules, hard and soft colloidal particles are able to move through gradient of polymer solution through excluded volume effects.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Los Angeles Dodgers, Pittsburgh Pirates, Atlanta Braves, and Houston Astros between 1983 and 1994. He is specifically remembered for his game-winning run scored in the 1992 National League Championship Series that sent the Braves to the World Series.\\"Sid Bream Statistics and History\\". \\"baseball-reference.com. Retrieved on 2017-05-12. CareerAmateur= Bream attended Liberty University, and in 1980 he played collegiate summer baseball with the Falmouth Commodores of the Cape Cod Baseball League. =Los Angeles Dodgers= Bream was selected by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the second round of the 1981 MLB Draft. During his minor league career he hit .329 with 83 home runs and 407 RBI, including a .419 on-base percentage and a .537 slugging percentage in the Dodgers' farm system. Bream's minor league success led to his big-league debut with the team in . Despite his excellent power numbers in the minors, Bream demonstrated mostly gap power in the majors (resulting in many doubles), and he was known for above-average defense at first base. The Dodgers expected him to compete with Greg Brock for the first base job, as Brock had performed below expectations after longtime starter Steve Garvey left to sign with the San Diego Padres. But Bream failed to hit for the Dodgers in multiple opportunities from 1983-85. =Pittsburgh Pirates= The Dodgers finally gave up on Bream late in the season and traded him along with Cecil Espy and R.J. Reynolds to the Pittsburgh Pirates for Bill Madlock, who the Dodgers wanted as they pursued the NL West title. It was in Pittsburgh where Bream finally had a chance to play every day. In he set an MLB record with 166 assists at first base. Bream's best season at the plate in Pittsburgh was also 1986 when he batted .268 with 16 home runs and 77 runs batted in. =Atlanta Braves= Following the season, Bream became a free agent and signed with the Atlanta Braves. He suffered through injuries in Atlanta, which limited his playing time. However, he did play in two World Series, in 1991 and 1992. After a poor start in , the Braves acquired Fred McGriff from the San Diego Padres to play first base and Bream was relegated to pinch-hitting for the rest of the season. The Slide The most famous moment of Bream's career came in Game 7 of the 1992 National League Championship Series. Bream was the Atlanta first baseman, and the Braves were playing his old team, the Pittsburgh Pirates, in the NLCS. The Pirates carried a 20 lead into the bottom of the ninth inning under the pitching of their ace, Doug Drabek, needing just three outs to make the World Series. However, Drabek gave up a leadoff double to Terry Pendleton, then allowed another runner, David Justice, on an infield error by second baseman José Lind. After Drabek walked Bream to load the bases, Pirates manager Jim Leyland pulled him out of the game. Reliever Stan Belinda replaced him on the mound, and managed to get two outs, despite giving up a run on a sacrifice fly by Ron Gant. Then, Braves third-string catcher Francisco Cabrera belted a single to left field, and Justice scored easily to tie the game. Pirates left fielder and eventual National League MVP Barry Bonds fielded the ball as Bream ran toward home plate. Bonds's throw arrived first, but it was slightly offline and bounced on its way towards the first- base line. As soon as catcher Mike LaValliere received the ball, he desperately lunged toward the plate to tag Bream out, but Bream was able to slide just underneath the tag to score the winning run and send the Braves to their second World Series in a row. =Houston Astros= Following the 1993 season, Bream signed with the Houston Astros and served as a backup to Jeff Bagwell. He hit .344 in limited play, and retired during the baseball strike. =Career statistics= In 1088 games over 12 seasons, Bream compiled a .264 batting average (819-for-3108) with 351 runs, 191 doubles, 12 triples, 90 home runs, 455 RBI, 50 stolen bases, 353 walks, 450 strikeouts, .336 on-base percentage and .420 slugging percentage. Defensively, he recorded a .992 fielding percentage. In postseason play, in 4 National League Championship Series and 2 World Series (1991 and '92) covering 28 games, he batted .250 (20-for-80) with 9 runs, 3 home runs, 8 RBI and 12 walks. =Retirement and family= Bream retired to the northern suburbs of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania where he lives with his wife Michele.Premier Speakers website The couple have four children. He is currently a motivational speaker and served as the hitting coach for the State College Spikes in 2008.Post Gazette website Bream serves as the spokesman for Christian Sports International (CSI,) a 501(c)(3) faith-based charity based in Pittsburgh.

Rasmussen of Boston College Criticized for his \\"discourse ethics\\" first propounded in 1990, Habermas, in this book, attempts to draw out the political, legal, and institutional implications of his theory, asserting that discourse ethics ought to be complemented by a theory of socialization that accounts for its institutionalization. (\\"Discourse ethics\\" is Habermas's attempt to explain the universal and obligatory nature of morality by evoking the universal obligations of communicative rationality.) Habermas contends that law is the primary medium of social integration in modern society, and is power that extracts obedience from its subjects. As power alone cannot grant it its legitimacy in modern society, law derives its validity from the consent of the governed. Habermas further accommodates his critics on the role of law by making a distinction between ethics and morality. In a modern pluralist culture, he argues, normative issues should be separated from issues of the good life. Only when various ethical traditions come into conflict with one another, as they inevitably do in a modern pluralist culture, do normative issues arise that have implications for everyone. In Habermas' deliberative paradigm, law stabilizes society, but only through the universal voice of democracy. Between Facts and Norms concludes with a proposal for a new paradigm of law that goes beyond the dichotomies that have afflicted modern political theory from its inception, and that still underlie current controversies between so-called liberals and republicans.

Situated due north of the city centre, Braamfontein is the fourth-largest office node in the city of Johannesburg containing many multi-storied buildings representing various architectural styles including Art Deco and Brutalist. Numerous office buildings have and are in the process of being converted to residential apartments. The offices of the Johannesburg City Council and the University of the Witwatersrand are situated in Braamfontein. The Nelson Mandela Bridge is a landmark that connects Braamfontein to the city centre, traversing South Africa's most extensive passenger train marshalling yard. Jan Smuts Avenue and Empire Road are two major road thoroughfares that run through the suburb. History De Korte Street. The Nelson Mandela Bridge. The Joburg Theatre. The name \\"Braamfontein\\" dates from as early as 1853, when a farm with this name to the north-west of Randjeslaagte belonged to Gert Bezuidenhout. In that year he applied to the government to have his farm surveyed. In 1858, Gert sold his farm to F.J. Bezuidenhout. Like many farms on the Witwatersrand, Braamfontein was subdivided early on, indicating a fairly dense population in the area. Two other Bezuidenhouts, Gerhardus Petrus and Cornelis Willem, each purchased one third of the farm in 1862, and a third part went to Frans Johannes van Dijk. Between 1862 and 1886 different portions were further subdivided. Three other well-known owners were Johannes Jacobus Lindeque, who in 1884, bought a section where the Country Club was later established in 1906, and Frans Eduard and Louwrens Geldenhuys. The first suburb established on the farm Braamfontein in 1888-1889 was unofficially named after the farm, as an official extension of the city of Johannesburg. This area is still called Braamfontein. There was, however, an earlier but unsuccessful effort to create a suburb prior to this. On February 19, 1896, a freight train containing 56 tonnes of dynamite exploded in Braamfontein, killing 78 people. During the apartheid era, large- scale commercial development in the area was encouraged. Until the middle of the 1980s an electric trolley-bus line traversed some of the area's roads. After the abolition of apartheid, the area began to deteriorate. However, intervention by both the city of Johannesburg and large corporate business, acting as the \\"Braamfontein Management District\\", initiated a process of urban renewal in this district. Urban renewal efforts and the establishment of the Braamfontein Management District by the Johannesburg Development Agency and property owners have prevented the district from decaying to the same extent as the Johannesburg CBD; however, considerable work remains to be done in order to restore the area's economic infrastructure to developed-country standards, eliminate dangerous and unsanitary buildings owned by the private sector, eliminate violent crime, reduce petty crime to tolerable levels, and prevent infringements of road traffic laws. As of February 2018, the Hollard Group has commenced with refurbishing the area's iconic Rennie House building, named after the South African shipping magnate Thomas Rennie.

There are two types of coarticulation: anticipatory coarticulation, when a feature or characteristic of a speech sound is anticipated (assumed) during the production of a preceding speech sound; and carryover or perseverative coarticulation, when the effects of a sound are seen during the production of sound(s) that follow. Many models have been developed to account for coarticulation. They include the look-ahead, articulatory syllable, time-locked, window, coproduction and articulatory phonology models. Coarticulation in phonetics refers to two different phenomena: *the assimilation of the place of articulation of one speech sound to that of an adjacent speech sound. For example, while the sound of English normally has an alveolar place of articulation, in the word tenth it is pronounced with a dental place of articulation because the following sound, , is dental. *the production of a co-articulated consonant, that is, a consonant with two simultaneous places of articulation. An example of such a sound is the voiceless labial-velar plosive found in many West African languages. The term coarticulation may also refer to the transition from one articulatory gesture to another. References *Crowley, Terry. (1997) An Introduction to Historical Linguistics. 3rd edition.

Laureano also took the place of 1349 drummer Frost on the Enslaved tour during September 2006 in the UK, as Frost was busy writing material with Satyricon. In June 2007, he returned to Dimmu Borgir stepping in for Hellhammer, who was recovering from a neck injury. He was later replaced by ex-Vader drummer Daray in late August, who became Dimmu Borgir's new drummer for their next album. Tony toured in the summer of 2009 with All That Remains, after drummer Jason Costa suffered a broken hand during the week of June 21. Laureano later toured with 1349 on several dates of Cannibal Corpse's \\"Evisceration Plague\\" tour, on account of drummer Frost being detained by US customs due to problems with his visa. On October 8, 2015, Metalsucks.net reported that Laureano had been playing with Megadeth while they were on tour in Asia. Frontman Dave Mustaine confirmed in a February 17, 2016 interview with Ticketmaster Insider that Laureano would be filling in for Chris Adler on nights that his schedule wouldn't permit him to play.

The novel is a humorous story of love. Through the hilarious dialogs, Basheer attacks religious Conservatism and the dowry system. Plot summary A young bank employee, Keshavan Nair, Hindu by religion, Nair by caste lodges on the upper floor of the house belonging to Saramma's father. Saraamma is a Christian by religion, beautiful, young, unmarried, unemployed, happy-go-lucky with a sting on the tip of her tongue. Keshavan Nair is an honest simpleton hopelessly in love with her. The book gets its title from the letter that Keshavan Nair composes to reveal to Saramma his love for her. The setting is 1940s Kerala. The story is a sarcastic commentary on the dowry system and is in favour of inter-religious marriage. But this is disguised in a funny love story. Basheer was not a Nair or a Christian, he was a lover of humanity. Saramma is an educated woman, and she is trying to get a job, and she has applied for jobs in many countries( because the story is set in Travancore, which was a country, or princely state). At last she gets a job. The job provider was Keshavan Nair, and the only job assigned to Saramma was to love him!He pays for that too in a monthly basis. Now the serious questions arise. They belong to different religions, then which religion will their children follow? They decides to teach their children every religion and it is up to the children to choose their religion. They plan to grow their children \\"Religion less\\". Then comes the other serious issue, How will they name the child? They cannot choose a Hindu name or Christian name, Keshavan Nair asks \\"Shall we go for Russian names?\\"Saramma asks \\"How will it be?\\" \\"Anything ending with 'Visky'is a Russian name\\" Saramma was not happy with it. Keshavan Nair asks \\"Shall we go for Chinese names like Kwang\\" Saramma is still not happy. Finally they decides to go with names over objects like sky, sand, Air, toffee, balloon. They finally decide to take a lot of these objects, The result of the lot will be two chits which say \\"Sky\\" and \\"Toffee\\". They name their child as \\"Skytoffee\\". Keshavan Nair shouts saying \\"Mr.Skytoffee\\",\\"Skytoffee\\",\\"Comrade:Skytoffee\\". Saramma interrupts \\"Do you want our child to become a communist\\" Keshavan Nair says \\"Let him decide on that\\". The story ends happily. The love letter The love letter =Translation= My dearest Saraamma, When life is at its most intense state of youth, and one's heart has reached its most beautiful state of love, how does my dearest friend spend her time during this rare and short-lived beautiful period of life? As for me, I am living each moment of my life with my mind stirring hopelessly in love with my Saaraama. What about Saaraamaa? I request you to think deeply and kindly bless me with a sweetly generous reply, Saaraama's own, Keshavan Nair.... Writing and publication Premalekhanam was written in 1943 when Basheer was under imprisonment at Thiruvananthapuram Central Jail, Poojappura as a political prisoner on charges of raajadroham (treason), for writing articles against Dewan C. P. Ramaswami Iyer. Basheer mentions the writing of Premalekhanam in his later work Mathilukal. The love- story that forms the plot of Mathilukal happened during the same prison term. At jail, he wrote many stories to entertain fellow prisoners, especially people sentenced for life. But at the time of leaving prison, the only work that he could get hold of was Premalekhanam. (Some of the other stories he later rewrote from memory). After his release, he got Premalekhanam published in 1943. By 1944, the book was banned in Thiruvithankoor, although there was nothing political in it. The main reason for banning this book in Travancore is that, Travancore was a Hindu country(princely state)where interreligious and intercaste marriages were strictly opposed, and the book indirectly favoured interreligious marriages. Film adaptation P. A. Backer adapted the novel for his film of the same name in 1985.

At that time, Burroughs machines ranged in price from $300 to $500 depending on model. Burroughs manufactured its 50,000th machine in 1907 and claimed that the 13,300 machines that it sold during 1907 exceeded \\"the combined sales of all other makes of adding machines during all the years of their existence.\\" In 1908 Burroughs offered 58 models, \\"One built for every line of business.\\" The many models varied in number of columns, the width of the paper onto which they printed, whether they were designed for computations involving fractions, feet and inches, pounds and ounces, etc., and whether they had features such as counters and split keyboards. In 1908 Burroughs also stated that \\"Nine out of ten adding machines in use are Burroughs.\\" That same year Burroughs also acquired the Universal Adding Machine Co. which described its products as \\"A Typewriter Carriage on an Adding Machine.\\" In 1909, Burroughs acquired the Pike Adding Machine Co. and in the same year began to sell Burroughs Pike visible adding machines. During the first decade of the 20th century, Burroughs faced competition from both key-driven calculators and a number of rival adding-listing machines, including Dalton, Pike, Standard, Universal, and Wales. Unlike Burroughs, these competing machines had \\"visible\\" printers that printed in view of the operator. Pike, Universal, and Wales machines had full keyboards like the machines produced by Burroughs. By contrast, Dalton Adding Machine and the Standard Adding Machine Company had more modern ten-key keyboards.http://www.officemuseum.com/calculating_machines_adding_listing.htm By 1910 Burroughs offered 74 models with between 6 and 17 columns of keys and began advertising some of its models as bookkeeping machines. In 1911 there were 78 Burroughs models ranging in price from $175 to $850 and Burroughs introduced its Burroughs Class 3 visible adding machines based on the Pike design. Also in 1911, Burroughs introduced a key-driven calculator that looked very much like a Felt & Tarrant Comptometer. In 1912, the Burroughs Calculator was $150. Felt & Tarrant sued Burroughs for patent infringement based on the similarity of the cases, and Burroughs modified the appearance of its calculator. In 1914, following an antitrust suit, Burroughs was banned from buying competing companies.http://www.officemuseum.com/calculating_machines_adding_listing.htm By 1916 there were 98 models, including a machine with 17 columns of keys priced at $615–$715. In 1928, Burroughs claimed that 100,000 Burroughs Portables had been sold. In 1935, Burroughs offered 450 standard models. Although the machine was a commercial success, Burroughs died in 1898 before receiving much money from it. However, one year before his death he received the John Scott Medal of the Franklin Institute as an award for his invention.

The first African novel published in English outside of Africa, this quest tale based on Yoruba folktales is written in a modified English or Pidgin English. In it, a man follows his brewer into the land of the dead, encountering many spirits and adventures. The novel has always been controversial, inspiring both admiration and contempt among Western and Nigerian critics, but has emerged as one of the most important texts in the African literary canon, translated into more than a dozen languages. Plot The Palm-Wine Drinkard, told in the first person, is about an unnamed man who is addicted to palm wine, which is made from the fermented sap of the palm tree and used in ceremonies all over West Africa. The son of a rich man, the narrator can afford his own tapster (a man who taps the palm tree for sap and then prepares the wine). When the tapster dies, cutting off his supply, the desperate narrator sets off for Dead's Town to try to bring the tapster back. He travels through a world of magic and supernatural beings, surviving various tests and finally gains a magic egg with never-ending palm wine. Criticism The Palm-Wine Drinkard was widely reviewed in Western publications when it was published by Faber and Faber. In 1975, the Africanist literary critic Bernth Lindfors produced an anthology of all the reviews of Tutuola's work published to date. The first review was an enthusiastic one from Dylan Thomas, who felt it was \\"simply and carefully described\\" in \\"young English\\"; his lyrical 500-word review drew attention to Tutuola’s work and set the tone for succeeding criticism. The early reviewers after Thomas, however, consistently described the book as \\"primitive\\", \\"primeval\\", \\"naïve\\", \\"un-willed\\", \\"lazy,\\" and \\"barbaric\\" or \\"barbarous\\". The New York Times Book Review was typical in describing Tutuola as \\"a true primitive\\" whose world had \\"no connection at all with the European rational and Christian traditions,\\" adding that Tutuola was \\"not a revolutionist of the word, …not a surrealist\\" but an author with an \\"un-willed style\\" whose text had \\"nothing to do with the author’s intentions.\\" The New Yorker took this criticism to its logical ends, stating that Tutuola was “being taken a great deal too seriously” as he is just a “natural storyteller\\" with a \\"lack of inhibition\\" and an \\"uncorrupted innocence\\" whose text was not new to anyone who had been raised on \\"old-fashioned nursery literature.\\" The reviewer concluded that American authors should not imitate Tutuola, as \\"it would be fatal for a writer with a richer literary inheritance.\\" In The Spectator, Kingsley Amis called the book an \\"unfathomable African myth\\", but credited it with a \\"unique grotesque humour\\" that is a \\"severe test\\" for the reader. Given these Western reviews, it is not surprising that African intellectuals of the time saw the book as bad for Africa, believing that the story showed Nigerians as illiterate and superstitious drunks. They worried that the novel confirmed Europeans’ racist \\"fantastic\\" concepts of Africa, \\"a continent of which they are profoundly ignorant.\\" Some criticized the novel as unoriginal, labeling it as little more than a retelling of Yoruba tales heard in the village square and Tutuola as \\"merely\\" a story teller who embellished stories for a given audience. Some insisted that Tutuola’s \\"strange lingo\\" was related to neither Yoruba nor West African Pidgin English. It was only later that the novel began to rise in the general estimation. Critics began to value Tutuola's literary style as a unique exploration of the possibilities of African folklore instead of the more typical realist imitation of European novels in African novels. One of the contributions Tutuola made was to \\"kill forever any idea that Africans are copyists of the cultures of other races.\\" Tutuola was seen as a \\"pioneer of a new literary form, based on an ancient verbal style.\\" Rather than seeing the book as mere pastiche, critics began to note that Tutuola had done a great deal \\"to impose an extraordinary unity upon his apparently random collection of traditional material\\" and that what may have started as \\"fragments of folklore, ritual and belief\\" had \\"all passed through the transmuting fire of an individual imagination.\\" The Nigerian critic E. N. Obiechina argued that the narrator’s “cosmopolitanism\\" enables him \\"to move freely through the rigidly partitioned world of the traditional folk-tale.\\" In contrast to the works of an author like Kafka, he added, in which human beings are the impotent victims of inexorable fate, the narrator of The Palm Wine Drinkard \\"is the proud possessor of great magical powers with which he defies even Fate itself.\\" The lack of resolution in the novel was also seen as more authentic, meant to enable group discussion in the same way that African riddles, proverbs, and folktales did. Tutuola was no more ungrammatical than James Joyce or Mark Twain, whose use of dialect was more violent, others argued. The Nigerian novelist Chinua Achebe also defended Tutuola's work, stating that it could be read as a moral commentary on Western consumerism. Well aware of the criticism, Tutuola has stated that he had no regrets, \\"Probably if I had more education, that might change my writing or improve it or change it to another thing people would not admire. Well, I cannot say. Perhaps with higher education, I might not be as popular a writer. I might not write folktales. I might not take it as anything important. I would take it as superstition and not write in that line.\\" He also added \\"I wrote The Palm-Wine Drinkard for the people of the other countries to read the Yoruba folklores. ... My purpose of writing is to make other people to understand more about Yoruba people and in fact they have already understood more than ever before.\\" Although The Palm- Wine Drinkard is often described as magical realism, the term was not invented until 1955, after the novel was published. In popular culture Kool A.D., one of the rappers in Das Racist, released a mixtape of the same name in 2012. Law and Order SVU character Detective Odafin \\"Fin\\" Tutuola's name is derived from this novel. Canadian rock band The Stills named a track on their 2008 album Oceans Will Rise after the book.

It is the fourth academic society in the United States to be organized around recognizing academic excellence, Earlier honor societies were Phi Beta Kappa for the arts and sciences (1776), Tau Beta Pi for Engineering (1885), and Sigma Xi for Scientific Research (1886). and is the oldest all-discipline honor society. The society's motto is (Philosophía Krateítõ Phõtôn), which is translated as \\"Let the love of learning rule humanity\\", and its mission is \\"to recognize and promote academic excellence in all fields of higher education and to engage the community of scholars in service to others.\\" Membership Membership is by invitation only, by an established campus chapter, and is restricted to students with integrity and high ethical standards and who are ranked scholastically in the top of their class, regardless of field of study: the top 7.5 percent of second-semester university juniors and the top 10 percent of seniors and graduate students. Faculty, professional staff and alumni who have achieved scholarly distinction also might be eligible. Phi Kappa Phi claims to have over 100,000 active members, to initiate approximately 30,000 new members annually, and to have a total of more than 1 million members since its creation, from over 300 college-based chapters in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines. History Phi Kappa Phi Banner Phi Kappa Phi Medallion used for graduation/recognition. Phi Kappa Phi pin In the late 1800s, there were only two academic societies founded and organized as honor societies, and they were discipline specific - Tau Beta Pi and Sigma Xi, which were founded in 1885 and 1886, respectively. There was also Phi Beta Kappa, a social and literary society that did not originate as an honor society when it was founded in 1776 but would soon become one for the liberal arts and sciences. Although Phi Beta Kappa was not exclusive to one discipline, it did not extend its membership beyond the liberal arts and sciences, hence the establishment of Tau Beta Pi, an honor society for engineering. Phi Beta Kappa became sufficient as an all- campus honor society for liberal arts colleges, but there was no honor society that could serve as such for the universities encompassing both liberal education and also technological and professional education, a mission to which the newly burgeoning land-grant universities of the time were dedicated.Land-grant university That was to change in 1897 when the first organizational meeting of Lambda Sigma Eta (later named Phi Kappa Phi), the nation's first all-discipline honor society, was held in Coburn Hall at the University of Maine under the leadership of undergraduate student Marcus L. Urann. In opposition to what he saw as the separateness and exclusivity promoted by the social fraternities and discipline bound honor societies, Urann wanted to create a society that was defined by inclusiveness and that unified a campus, constituted by \\"high rank men drawn from all classes and all groups and all societies\\". Those selected for invitation into the society would be the top ten students of the senior class whose rank did not fall below the 90th percentile for the four years of work at the university. In all, the society was founded by 10 senior students, two faculty members, and the university president, Abram Winegaard Harris. Urann graduated in 1897, and leadership of Phi Kappa Phi was assumed by President Harris. A year or so later, the name was changed to the Morrill Society, in honor of the sponsor of the Congressional Act which provided for land-grant universities. In 1899, the first woman was initiated into the society, Pearl Clayton Swain. In 1900, the society became national in scope by action of the presidents of the University of Maine (the founding chapter), University of Tennessee, and Pennsylvania State University. There was considerable debate among the three existing chapters regarding the purpose and naming of the society. Pennsylvania State University's President George W. Atherton cautioned that using Greek letters to label the society would be \\"too much like aping other organizations\\", and President Charles W. Dabney of the University of Tennessee did not want to accept institutions that already had a chapter of Phi Beta Kappa. Nonetheless, on June 12, 1900, the society changed its name to Phi Kappa Phi, drawing from the initial letters of the Greek words forming its motto (see article lede). The year 1900 also saw the first national convention of Phi Kappa Phi, which was held in New Haven, Connecticut and attended by delegates representing the three original chapters. In 1915, Phi Kappa Phi continued to struggle to earn a reputation. The then Secretary of the organization, L.H. Pammel, pointed out that institutions that were seeking to establish a chapter of Phi Beta Kappa were often hesitant about establishing a chapter of Phi Kappa Phi. To this, the society continued to make its case: > Phi Beta Kappa, it was repeated time after time, represented the literary > side of education such as history, literature, and economics.\\"The Phi Kappa > Phi on the other hand stands not only for the democracy of education, making > no distinction between different lines of investigation, such as literature, > history, science, home economics, agriculture, veterinary medicine, law, but > for sound scholarship based on four years of collegiate work.\\" It would later be asserted that the society's aim is not to replace older societies, but to \\"help raise the broader educational program initiated by our government when it established the land-grant system, to appreciation of scholarly worth whether the subject matter be strictly academic or of a more vocational type.\\" 1915 was the same year the first issue of The Phi Kappa Phi Journal was published and also the year the society established an association with the American Association for the Advancement of Science that would last until 1962. In 1919, Phi Kappa Phi still struggled with securing growth and in the spirit of \\"the unity and democracy of education\\" the leadership took the stance that \\"although certain honor societies like Phi Beta Kappa and Sigma Xi are unwilling to venture out into these technical schools\\", Phi Kappa Phi should push to become part of those institutions. In 1922, the question of admitting African-Americans into the society was raised openly, and the leadership decided that although the constitution did not debar African- Americans, the society would not \\"urge the election of colored people\\" because the \\"southern institutions would resent it.\\" Nonetheless, in 1925 the society as a whole formally took the position that it would not discriminate on color or race. Yet it would take until 1976 for Phi Kappa Phi to successfully establish a chapter at a Historically Black College or University, when one was established at Jackson State University. Also in 1925, Phi Kappa Phi would be instrumental in creating the Association of College Honor Societies (ACHS), being one of its six charter members. In 1933, while the Philippines was still an American colony, the first chapter outside of the continental United States was founded at the University of the Philippines. About this time, president of the society Frank D. Kern stated that \\"integrity, moral courage, spirited discernment, and concern for human welfare\\" were equally important for membership in the society. During the two world wars and into the 1960s, Society membership numbers and finances struggled. In 1963, Chapter 105 was chartered at the oldest and largest university system in the American territory of Puerto Rico, Universidad de Puerto Rico. By 1969, new member numbers were triple what they were in 1960. That year, the Phi Kappa Phi Foundation was incorporated to promote academic excellence and achievement by means of scholarships and fellowships. To support first-year graduate work, the society now offers annually through the Foundation 60 Fellowships and 30 Awards of Excellence, on a competitive basis, to graduating students who have been initiated into the society and who have also been nominated by their chapters for the competition. In a 1969 Special Convention, the motto devised in 1900, \\"The Love of Learning Rules all Mankind\\", was changed to \\"Let the Love of Learning Rule Mankind\\" due to membership insistence that the former was, in the words of one member, \\"the most barefaced lie that had ever been cast in bronze.\\" By 1971, 74 years after its founding, Phi Kappa Phi numbered 120 chapters. In the next 12 years, that number would double to 239. Mission Phi Kappa Phi's mission is \\"to recognize and promote academic excellence in all fields of higher education and to engage the community of scholars in service to others.\\" In honoring \\"those persons of good character who have excelled in scholarship, in whatever field, it will stimulate others to strive for excellence.\\" To this end, the society insists that \\"in order to acquire a chapter ... an institution provide the means and atmosphere conducive to academic excellence.\\" Furthermore, the society awards more than $700,000.00 in national and local scholarships annually, as well as grants and graduate fellowships. According to Baird's Manual of College Fraternities, the aim of these awards \\"is not to give the recipient something which may encourage complacency, but to challenge the member to continued excellence.\\" According to the website of the National Association of Fellowships Advisors, \\"The multidisciplinary nature of Phi Kappa Phi is reflected in its Fellowship and Award of Excellence recipients. Awardees represent a variety of fields including biology, chemistry, engineering, political science, mathematics and psychology. Likewise, the professions they select are equally diverse: law, medicine, business, education, science, or the arts\\". This multidisciplinary nature is represented by the rays of light on the Phi Kappa Phi badge (see \\"Society Symbols\\" below). In addition, Phi Kappa Phi aims to foster community service and leadership through its grants for local and national literacy initiatives, promotion of excellence grants, and training and leadership opportunities available to its membership. Some chapters of Phi Kappa Phi also sponsor conferences and campus speakers.See, for example, ;  Publications  Phi Kappa Phi publishes for its active membership a quarterly journal, The Phi Kappa Phi Forum and the triannual Honor Chord e-zine, both of which have won awards.The Phi Kappa Phi Forum and the Honor Chord e-zine received 2008 APEX Awards for Publication Excellence. See The society also publishes the Monthly Mentions newsletter. Each issue of The Phi Kappa Phi Forum is devoted to a significant theme and addresses prominent issues of the day from an interdisciplinary perspective. The journal features articles by scholars inside and outside the academic community. In addition to timely articles, each issue of The Phi Kappa Phi Forum contains selected poetry and reviews of current books and periodical literature. The Honor Chord e-zine and Phi Kappa Phi Newsletter feature professional advice columns and news items of interest to members on both the national and local levels. Notable people who have contributed to The Phi Kappa Phi Forum include Ronald Reagan, Bob Dole, Edward Kennedy, Jesse Jackson, Sr., Newt Gingrich, Myrlie Evers-Williams, Michael Dukakis, Thomas \\"Tip\\" O'Neill, Annette Kolodny, Warren E. Burger, Ellis Marsalis, Jr., and Molefi Kete Asante.  Organization and governance  Phi Kappa Phi is governed ultimately by the Biennial Convention, supplemented by any interim - though rare - special conventions deemed necessary. Each chapter may send one official delegates to a convention, which is held at a major city in the United States. Between conventions, the business of the society is conducted by the board of directors, composed of 12 people, of whom 11 are elective (president, president-elect, a vice president of development, five directors, two student representatives, and the immediate past president) and one is appointive (executive director of the society). The executive director is in charge of the society's national office. Each of the 300 active chapters of Phi Kappa Phi elect their own set of chapter officers and is governed by the chapter constitution and by-laws. Chapters are numbered chronologically based on their date of founding, with the oldest chapter at the University of Maine identified as Chapter 001. Phi Kappa Phi is a 501(c)(3) organization under the United States Internal Revenue Code. Its national headquarters is located in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. =Presidents= The following served as president of the society since its founding:http://www.phikappaphi.org/about/news/news- landing/2014/08/15/2014-2016-board-of-directors-elected#.U_Zka13lrIU  Symbols The Badge= The Seal of Phi Kappa Phi The badge, which appears on the key and in the center of the society's seal, is the terrestrial globe with the sun's eight-rayed corona extending behind it. The sun represents the dissemination of truth and knowledge as light. The eight-rayed sun represents the various branches into which general education at the time was divided, and the arrangement of the rays \\"stood for the unity and democracy of the various branches of learning\\" Encompassing the globe is a band with the Greek letters Phi(Φ) Kappa(K) Phi(Φ), representing the honor society's motto, (Philosophía Krateítõ Phõtôn). This band represents the bond of fellowship that binds all lovers of learning in a common purpose. =The seal= The seal of the society has at its center the badge. This in turn is surrounded by a crenelated line which represents the battlements and walls of Troy as well as a technological aspect of the ancient Greek culture. In the space between this line and the periphery of the seal appear three stars just above the badge, one for each of the three original chapters. Just below the badge is the phrase \\"Founded 1897.\\" =The ribbon= The Ribbon of Phi Kappa Phi The ribbon of the society portrays the meander pattern common in Greek art, suggesting the enduring values and ideals of learning and community leadership promoted by Phi Kappa Phi.

Insect traps are used to monitor or directly reduce populations of insects or other arthropods, by trapping individuals and killing them. They typically use food, visual lures, chemical attractants and pheromones as bait and are installed so that they do not injure other animals or humans or result in residues in foods or feeds. Visual lures use light, bright colors and shapes to attract pests. Chemical attractants or pheromones may attract only a specific sex. Insect traps are sometimes used in pest management programs instead of pesticides but are more often used to look at seasonal and distributional patterns of pest occurrence. This information may then be used in other pest management approaches. The trap mechanism or bait can vary widely. Flies and wasps are attracted by proteins. Mosquitoes and many other insects are attracted by bright colors, carbon dioxide, lactic acid, floral or fruity fragrances, warmth, moisture and pheromones. Synthetic attractants like methyl eugenol are very effective with tephritid flies.  Trap types  Insect traps vary widely in shape, size, and construction, often reflecting the behavior or ecology of the target species. Some common varieties are described below = Light traps = Light traps, with or without ultraviolet light, attract certain insects. Light sources may include fluorescent lamps, mercury-vapor lamps, black lights, or light-emitting diodes. Designs differ according to the behavior of the insects being targeted. Light traps are widely used to survey nocturnal moths. Total species richness and abundance of trapped moths may be influenced by several factors such as night temperature, humidity and lamp type.Jonason, Franzén and Ranius (2014) Surveying Moths Using Light Traps: Effects of Weather and Time of Year. PLoS ONE, 9, e92453. Grasshoppers and some beetles are attracted to lights at a long range but are repelled by it at short range. Farrow's light trap has a large base so that it captures insects that may otherwise fly away from regular light traps. Light traps can attract flying and terrestrial insects, and lights may be combined with other methods described below. =Adhesive traps = Sticky traps may be simple flat panels or enclosed structures, often baited, that ensnare insects with an adhesive substance. Baitless ones are nicknamed \\"blunder\\" traps, as pests might blunder into them while wandering or exploring. Sticky traps are widely used in agricultural and indoor pest monitoring. Shelter traps, or artificial cover traps, take advantage of an insect's tendencies to seek shelter in loose bark, crevices, or other sheltered places. Baited shelter traps such \\"Roach Motels\\" and similar enclosures often have adhesive material inside to trap insects. = Flying insect traps = These traps are designed to catch flying or wind-blown insects. A sticky insect trap used to monitor pest populations Flight interception traps or are net-like or transparent structures that impede flying insects and funnel them into collecting. Barrier traps consist of a simple vertical sheet or wall that channels insects down into collection containers. The Malaise trap, a more complex type, is a mesh tent-like trap that captures insects that tend to fly up rather than down when impeded. Pan traps (also called water pan traps) are simple shallow dishes filled with a soapy water or a preservative and killing agent such as antifreeze. Pan traps are used to monitor aphids and some other small insects. Bucket traps and bottle traps, often supplemented with a funnel, are inexpensive versions that use a bait or attractant to lure insects into a bucket or bottle filled with soapy water or antifreeze. Many types of moth traps are bucket-type traps. Bottle traps are widely used, often used to sample wasp or pest beetle populations. = Terrestrial arthropod traps = Pitfall traps are used for ground-foraging and flightless arthropods such as Carabid beetles and spiders. Pitfall traps consist of a bucket or container buried in soil or other substrate so that its lip is flush with the substrate. A grain probe is a type of trap used to monitor pests of stored grain, consisting of a long cylindrical tube with multiple holes along its length that can be inserted at various depths within grain. Soil emergence traps, consisting of an inverted cone or funnel with collecting jar on top, are employed to capture insects with a subterranean pupal stage. Emergence traps have been used to monitor important disease-vectors such as Phlebotomine sandflies. Aquatic emergence trap = Aquatic arthropod traps = Aquatic interception traps typically involve mesh funnels or conical structures that guide insects into a jar or bottle for collecting. Aquatic emergence traps are cage-like or tent-like structures used to capture aquatic insects such as chironomids, caddisflies, mosquitoes, and odonates upon their transition from aquatic nymphs to terrestrial adults. Aquatic emergence traps may be free floating on the water's surface, submerged, or attached to a post near shore.

The highway's importance grew after Compaq Computer Corporation (now known as Hewlett-Packard) moved its headquarters close to the intersection of SH 249 and Louetta Rd. In 2003, a portion of SH 249 in Tomball was renamed Business SH 249B from Hicks Road to Holderreith Road. This is because of bypass that bypasses Tomball on the west side of the city. In 2015, SH 249 was extended northwest 24.4 miles from FM 149 and FM 1774 to SH 105 near Stoneham. A section of SH 249 from Woodtrace Boulevard to FM 149 was renumbered as a southern extension of FM 1774 in December 2019. On August 8, 2020, the section of SH 249 from FM 1774 to FM 1488 was opened. Previously, SH 249 was designated on June 22, 1937 from then-SH 73 (now Interstate 10) near San Felipe north to the Brazos River. The route was redesignated on May 9, 1940 as Texas Spur 99. The route became part of Farm to Market Road 1458 on January 20, 1966. Future Current plans call for the highway to extend to the Bryan–College Station area. Continued growth in the Bryan/College Station, Conroe and NW Houston regions have congested existing roadways, including SH 105 and FM 1774. Texas A&M; University and businesses in the Bryan/College Station area would benefit from faster connections to Bush-Intercontinental Airport, the Port of Houston and the Texas Medical Center. A bypass of Magnolia, Texas is desirable because of the large traffic load every October due to the annual Renaissance fair. Decreased funding for road projects in recent years had stalled the extension of SH 249. However the rapid growth in the area has led to a renewed push in 2012 to build further segments. Plans for the middle segments (Pinehurst-Todd Mission) and north segment (Todd Mission-Navasota) were revived by the Texas Department of Transportation in early 2013. TxDOT has formed a working group with local officials and stakeholders to discuss alternatives for the SH 249 corridor. The segment from Sentinel Oaks to FM 1774 in Pinehurst (maintained by MCTRA) opened in spring 2020. From FM 1774 in Pinehurst, north up to SH 105 in Grimes County, SH 249 will be under the jurisdiction of TxDOT. The remaining portion of SH 249 in Montgomery County from FM 1488 to FM 1774 in Todd Mission is projected to be completed in spring 2021. In Grimes County, the north segment will be constructed as a non-tolled two-lane freeway.SH 249 - Todd Mission to Navasota (Schematics) Texas Department of Transportation. 2 October 2019 (Retrieved 16 August 2020) Construction in Grimes County began in late 2018 and is projected to be completed in spring 2023.

That year, he recorded 55 tackles and led Green Bay with eight interceptions. After the 1996 season, the Packers went on to win Super Bowl XXXI 35–21, over his hometown team, the New England Patriots, earning Robinson his first and only championship ring. Then again, after the 1997 season, Robinson and the Packers went to Super Bowl XXXII, however they lost 31–24, to the Denver Broncos. With his team trailing 24–17 in the third quarter, Robinson intercepted a pass from Broncos quarterback John Elway in the end zone, preventing Denver from building a bigger lead and setting up a touchdown on Green Bay's ensuing drive to tie the game. He also recorded an interception of Steve Young that set up a touchdown in the Packers 23–10 win over the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC title game two weeks prior. During Super Bowl XXXII, Robinson not only declared to his teammates that the Broncos were like the Colts (the worst team in football that year, but who defeated the Packers 41–38 in week 12), but also declared, \\"This team is not better than us; they're not even good!\\" =Atlanta Falcons= After the 1997 season, Robinson joined the Atlanta Falcons in 1998. During the season, Robinson recorded 46 tackles, two fumble recoveries, four interceptions, and one touchdown return, earning his third career Pro Bowl selection. After making a game-saving play in the NFC Championship game (breaking up an otherwise certain winning touchdown to Minnesota Vikings wide receiver Randy Moss) Robinson made it back to the Super Bowl (the Falcons' first appearance ever) for the third year in a row, and again faced the Broncos. The night prior to Super Bowl XXXIII, Robinson was arrested by an undercover police officer for soliciting a prostitute. Earlier that day, Robinson received the Athletes in Action/Bart Starr Award, given annually to a player who best exemplifies outstanding character and leadership in the home, on the field and in the community. After the arrest, Robinson agreed to return the award. The next day, without much sleep the night before due to the prostitution incident, Robinson gave up an 80-yard touchdown reception to Broncos receiver Rod Smith, giving the Broncos a 17–3 lead over the Falcons. Later, in the fourth quarter, he missed a tackle on Denver running back Terrell Davis that enabled Davis to break a long run to the Atlanta 10-yard line. The Atlanta Falcons ended up losing the game, 34–19, and Robinson was widely denounced by the press and fans for the previous night's incident. The next season was Robinson's last with the Falcons. =Carolina Panthers= After leaving the Falcons, Robinson joined the Carolina Panthers, and retired following the 2000 season. =Career summary= In his 16 seasons, Robinson recorded 1,415 tackles, 57 interceptions, 762 return yards, 22 fumble recoveries, 71 return yards, and two touchdowns (one fumble return, one interception return), and 7.5 sacks. His 57 interceptions have been exceeded by just 11 players, four of whom are in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Coaching and broadcasting career Robinson served as a color analyst for the Carolina Panthers Radio Network from 2002-18. He currently serves as a varsity football and wrestling coach at Charlotte Christian School in Charlotte, North Carolina. Beginning in January 2015, Robinson is a co-host of the morning television show Charlotte Today on WCNC-TV, Charlotte, NC. Personal life Robinson is a Christian.

He was the first international player to play in the NBA Finals for two teams.JS Online: Hall snubs leave a few questions Zan Tabak averaged 5.0 points in his 6-year NBA career. Early career Born in Split, SR Croatia, SFR Yugoslavia, Tabak's father-in-law Ratomir Tvrdić was a top European basketball player, his wife played first-division basketball for Croatia, and his younger brother played professionally in Croatia. Tabak began his basketball career in 1985, at the age of fifteen, making his debut with the Jugoplastika Split organization. Only a few years later, he and Split teammates Dino Rađa and Toni Kukoč led the club to three consecutive European Championships (1989–91), a feat only equaled in EuroLeague's storied history by its first champions, Rīgas ASK, some thirty years before.Real Madrid C.F.

He did not immediately play for Houston, however, opting instead to spend another year in Croatia with SD Split. = Return to Europe (1991–1994) = On June 25, 1991, Croatia, along with Slovenia, decided to end relationships with the other republics of the Yugoslavia. The newly independent state, then, was able to send its own athletes to the 1992 Summer Olympic Games; this delegation also included a national basketball team. Along with previous Split teammates and Dražen Petrović, Tabak and the Croatian team performed well and won the silver medal; they were bested only by the star-studded United States Dream Team. After Barcelona, Tabak continued with his career, spending two years in the Italian Serie A league. In his years there, Tabak shot the ball extremely well, with a field goal percentage of over 60%. He also averaged a double-double in points and rebounds in both the 1992–93 season for Baker Livorno and in the 1993–94 season for Recoaro Milano.Lega A Basket = Return to NBA (1994–1998) = Over three years after he was drafted by them, Tabak was signed by the Rockets on July 20, 1994. With nine years of experience, he played his first NBA minutes on November 5, 1994. As a rookie, he saw limited playing time, averaging less than five minutes per game in thirty-seven appearances. He spent the season as a backup to Hakeem Olajuwon, who led Houston to the franchise's second NBA title that year as Tabak won his first and only NBA championship.

As back-up to Rik Smits, Tabak contributed to the Pacers' appearance in the 2000 NBA Finals, which was ultimately won by the Los Angeles Lakers. The 2000–01 season was to be Tabak's last in the NBA, despite improved numbers and increased playing time. When asked about his decision to return to European basketball Tabak said \\"...I wanted to come back [to Europe] because I felt I was 31 years old and I was feeling my career was coming to the end. I didn't want to finish my career being just one of the players. I wanted to be an important player in my team.\\"HoopsHype - Interviews - Zan Tabak: \\"Pitino made some wrong choices about players\\" Post-NBA career Tabak spent the remaining four years of his playing career in Spain with Real Madrid, DKV Joventut, and Unicaja Málaga.

He played his entire Major League Baseball career as a catcher for the Baltimore Orioles from 1989 to 1998. Although his playing career was shortened by injuries, Hoiles was considered one of the best all-around catchers in Major League Baseball, performing well both offensively and defensively. He was inducted into the Baltimore Orioles Hall of Fame in 2006.  Baseball career  Hoiles was drafted by the Detroit Tigers in the 19th round of the 1986 Major League Baseball draft. He played in the Tigers' minor league system until 1988, when he was traded with Cesar Mejia and Robinson Garces to the Baltimore Orioles for Fred Lynn. Hoiles made his major league debut with the Orioles on April 25, 1989 at the age of 24, but appeared in only six games with the Orioles, as he spent most of the season in the minor leagues with the Rochester Red Wings. He appeared in 23 games with the Orioles in 1990, but once again spent most of the season playing in Rochester. Hoiles returned to the major leagues in 1991 when the Orioles traded away catcher Mickey Tettleton and gave Hoiles an opportunity to be their starting catcher. He made only one error in 89 games played as a catcher and ended the year with a league-leading .998 fielding percentage, becoming the fifth rookie catcher in major league baseball history to win a fielding title. Hoiles had his best season offensively in 1993, hitting for a .300 batting average at mid-season. Cito Gaston, the American League manager for the 1993 All-Star Game held in Baltimore, received criticism for naming Oakland catcher Terry Steinbach as a reserve player instead of hometown favorite Hoiles. Both players were hitting .300, but Hoiles had 18 home runs compared to Steinbach's seven. Gaston explained that he was forced by Major League Baseball rules to name at least one Oakland player to the All-Star team. Hoiles finished the season with a .310 batting average along with 29 home runs, 80 runs batted in, a .416 on-base percentage and a .585 slugging percentage. He ranked fifth in the American League in slugging percentage and in on-base percentage, and finished in 16th place in balloting for the 1993 American League Most Valuable Player Award. By early 1996, Hoiles' offensive production had diminished to the point to where the Orioles tried to drop him from the team by exposing him through waivers, but he managed a comeback. On May 17, 1996, Hoiles joined the list of 23 major league players who have hit an ultimate grand slam when he hit a grand slam in the bottom of the ninth inning with the Orioles down by three runs against the Seattle Mariners. Hoiles' feat was unique, in that he hit his home run on a full count with two outs, only the second time in major league history this has ever been recorded (the first was by Alan Trammell in 1988https://www.baseball- reference.com/boxes/DET/DET198806210.shtml). Hoiles ended the 1996 season with 25 home runs and 73 runs batted in to help the Orioles finish in second place in the American League East Division and capture the wild card berth, the Orioles' first postseason berth since winning the 1983 World Series. The Orioles went on to defeat the Cleveland Indians in the first round of the playoffs, before losing to the eventual world champion New York Yankees in the 1996 American League Championship Series. In 1997, Hoiles played the entire season without committing an error, leading American League catchers with a 1.000 fielding percentage, as the Orioles went on to win the American League East Division title. The Orioles defeated the Seattle Mariners in the first round of the playoffs, before losing to the Cleveland Indians in the 1997 American League Championship Series. On August 14, 1998, at Jacobs Field in Cleveland, Hoiles became the ninth player and the first catcher in major league history to hit two grand slams in one game. He played in his final major league game on September 27, 1998 at the age of 33. By the beginning of 1999, the 34-year-old Hoiles was hampered by injuries that included a degenerative hip and a bad back. On May 1, 1999, the Orioles announced that Hoiles had been placed on waivers, but had been offered another job within their organization. Career statistics In a ten-year major league career, Hoiles played in 894 games, accumulating 739 hits in 2,820 at-bats for a .262 career batting average along with 151 home runs, 449 runs batted in and an on- base percentage of .366. He led American League catchers four times in fielding percentage and ended his career with a .994 average, which was .004 above the league average during his playing career. His .994 career fielding percentage ranks ninth all-time among Major League catchers. Hoiles' career .837 on-base plus slugging percentage is seventh-highest all time among major league catchers. His .467 slugging percentage is 11th highest all-time among major league catchers. His 151 career home runs rank 12th highest in Orioles team history. Hoiles was the Orioles' catcher on July 13, 1991, when four Orioles pitchers combined to pitch a no-hitter. In a game against the Kansas City Royals on April 9, 1998, Hoiles set a major league record for catchers by being involved in four double plays in one game. Post-baseball career After his playing career, Hoiles returned to his alma mater, Eastern Michigan University, where he served as a baseball coach. He later became a baseball coach at Bowling Green State University. He was inducted to the Eastern Michigan University Athletics Hall of Fame in 2000. Hoiles was inducted into the Baltimore Orioles Hall of Fame on August 26, 2006. On December 20, 2006, Hoiles was named as the first manager of the York Revolution of the independent Atlantic League of Professional Baseball. He led the team to the playoffs, after winning the Freedom Division in the second half of the 2008 season. He stepped down as the manager on August 5, 2009, citing personal reasons. In April 2010, along with Adam Gladstone, Hoiles began his professional radio career as co-host of \\"Bird Talk\\", a daily baseball show heard on Baltimore's Fox 1370.

The islands were named on Petter Sørlle's chart, based upon his survey of the South Orkney Islands in 1912–1913, in honour of Carl Anton Larsen. The islands were recharted in 1933 by Discovery Investigations (DI) personnel on the Discovery II, who used the name Larsen Islands for the group and named the largest island Larsen Island. This scheme was found to be confusing, so Larsen Island was renamed in 1954 by the UK Antarctic Place-names Committee (UK-APC) for the sloop James Monroe, which was commanded by Captain Palmer at the time of discovery and anchored in this vicinity in December 1821. Monroe Island The largest island of the group, Monroe Island, lies about 10 km from Coronation. Veitch Point is a point situated centrally along the northeast end of the island. Sphinx Rock lies immediately off the southwest end of Monroe Island. Both features were charted and named by DI personnel. Important Bird Area The Larsen Islands, together with Moreton Point and an adjacent area of ice-free land to the west, have been identified as a 1580 ha Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports large breeding colonies of seabirds, including some 125,000 pairs of chinstrap penguins and 125,000 pairs of southern fulmars.

It consists of the partitioning of processors into separate computing environments running different operating systems. Providing up to 32 processors that are crossbar connected to 64GB of memory and 96 PCI cards, a CMP system provides mainframe- like architecture using Intel CPUs. CMP supports Windows NT and Windows 2000 Server, AIX, Novell NetWare and UnixWare and can be run as one large SMP system or multiple systems with variant operating systems. There is a concept of creating CPU Partitions in CMPs, e.g. one can create a full partition of 32 processors, Or one can create two partitions of 16 processors each, these two partitions will be visible to the OS installed as two machines. Similarly for 32 processors it is possible to create 32 partitions at max each having a single CPU. Unisys' CMP is the only server architecture to take full advantage of Microsoft's Windows 2000 Datacenter Server operating system's support for 32 processors. In case of LINUX/UNIX OS the CMP technology is proven to be very best, whereas in case of Windows 2003 Servers installations, there are certain limits for partitions having number of CPUs, like for a windows 2003 installation the maximum CPU in a partition can only be 4, if more CPUs are assigned severe performance degrade are observed. Even on 8 CPU partition the performance is comparable to the performance of a 2 processors partition. A CMP subpod contains four x86 or Itanium CPUs, which connect through a third- level memory cache to the crossbar. Each crossbar supports two subpods, two direct I/O bridges (DIBs) and can connect to four memory storage units (MSUs).http://www.computerlanguage.com/ Unisys is also providing CMP server technology to Compaq, Dell, Hewlett-Packard and ICL, under OEM agreements.

Life Born in Folkestone, Kent, England, in April 1947, Picknett grew up in an alleged haunted house in York, attending Park Grove Junior School and Queen Anne Grammar School. After graduating from university with an Upper 2nd (hons) degree in English Literature, she briefly became a teacher, a shop assistant, and a stand-up comic before moving to London in 1971 to join Marshall Cavendish Publications as a trainee sub-editor. In the 1980s, she was Deputy Editor on The Unexplained and contributor to many other publications. She was also a regular contributor on various radio shows, including Michael van Straten and Clive Bull's on LBC and Talk Radio. She was also a television presenter for both Anglia and Southern TV. In 1990 she was guest curator for the Royal Photographic Society's exhibition The Unexplained at Bath, performing the same function in 1999 for the National Museum of Photography, Film and Television at Bradford. In the early 1990s, she teamed up with fellow researcher and writer Clive Prince. Their first book, Turin Shroud: How Leonardo da Vinci Fooled History, was the first mainstream work to reveal how all the so-called miraculous characteristics of the Turin Shroud could be reproduced only using a pinhole camera (camera obscura), and argued that Leonardo da Vinci not only faked it, but used his own face for the model of Jesus, overlooking the fact that the first exhibition of the Shroud of Turin, authentic or not, was in 1357, almost one century before the birth of Leonardo.Carl E.

Picknett and Prince perform most of the research for their books themselves, though they are sometimes helped by several friends and fellow researchers. They have credited Keith Prince as a main contributor for their work on the Turin Shroud, Philip Coppens in The Stargate Conspiracy (published in 1999), and Robert Brydon for their work on Rudolf Hess (titled Double Standards: The Rudolf Hess Cover-Up and published in 2001). Picknett and Prince make a brief appearance in the film The Da Vinci Code. The pair appear on a London bus as the protagonists are travelling to the Temple Church, off Fleet Street in central London.

Plot summary Architect Sir Alistair Sinclair and his foreman, Dennis McKay, have been slain in the midst of rehabilitating the medieval west tower of the Royal Palace of Holyrood—the very wing where Mary, Queen of Scots, had lived, and where David Rizzio had met his brutal, politically motivated end. Mycroft Holmes fears these murders portend new threats against Britain's present monarch—the elderly Queen Victoria, who occasionally lodges at the palace—by a known assassin, perhaps in nefarious league with the German Kaiser. En route north, Holmes and Watson are menaced aboard their train by a red-bearded bomb thrower (supposedly a rabid Scots nationalist), only to discover that still greater dangers await them, and others, at Holyroodhouse. The plaintive drone of a weeping woman, cruelly punctured and shattered corpses, a pool of blood \\"that never dries\\", and a disembodied Italian voice with unexpected musical tastes all imply the wrath of wraiths behind recent atrocities. But Holmes and Watson deduce that greed, rather than ghosts, may be to blame. Characters in The Italian Secretary * Sherlock Holmes * John H.

It means that a horse will carry a set weight in accordance with the Weight for Age Scale. This weight varies depending on the horse’s age, its sex, the race distance and the month of the year. Weight for age races are usually Group 1 races, races of the highest quality. It is a form of handicapping for horse racing, but within the horse racing industry is not referred to as handicap which is reserved for more general handicapping. WFA is a method of trying to equal out the physical progress which the average thoroughbred racehorse makes as it matures. The thoroughbred matures extremely quickly compared to the human being. By the age of two the horse has achieved 95% of its mature height and weight, and by the end of its third year it will be fully mature. To allow for this variation in maturity in the context of racing, it is necessary to express it as a function of the weight a horse will carry in a race. It is also necessary to take into account the race distance because stamina comes with maturity, and younger horses are at a greater disadvantage the further they have to run. If no allowance was made, a mature older horse would always beat a younger one. The principle of WFA was developed by Admiral Rous, a handicapper with the English Jockey Club. Rous experimented with weights until he arrived at a relationship between age and maturity, expressed in terms of weight. His original scale has undergone only minor alterations since his work in the 1860s.

A talented violinist, he attended the National Music Camp and graduated from the Interlochen Arts Academy in Michigan in 1970, where he majored in composition. He then moved to New York City, where he was a composition student of Elliott Carter at The Juilliard School. Discouraged by his progress and fascinated by the cultural and social upheavals going on in New York at the time, he discontinued his composition studies, eventually enrolling at Hunter College as a composition major, where he earned a degree and made several short films. He had a promising career as a filmmaker, but died in New York City from AIDS complications. He is best known for his 1986 film Parting Glances, made for $310,000, a bittersweet romantic comedy that spans a 24-hour period in the upwardly mobile New York gay community. He wrote half a dozen screenplays and completed three short films in the six years before Parting Glances, and wrote additional screenplays in the four years after.

They were literally \\"foot companions\\" (in Greek, pezos means \\"pedestrian\\" and hetairos means \\"companion\\" or \\"friend\\"). The Macedonian phalanxes were made up almost entirely of pezhetairoi. Pezhetairoi were very effective against both enemy cavalry and infantry, as their long pikes could be used to impale enemies charging on horse-back or to keep enemy infantry with shorter weapons at bay. Description The pezhetairoi were the battalions of the Macedonian phalanx. They first came to prominence during the reign of Philip II, particularly when they played such an important role in Philip's subjugation of Greece at the Battle of Chaeronea in 338 BC. Philip created this unit by lengthening the spear to the point of becoming a true pike, removing the heavy armor, and replacing the large shield with a smaller alternative. They were armed with the sarissa, a long spear with a shaft made from flexible cornel wood, which had a much longer reach than the traditional hoplite spear. Because of its length the phalanx could present the spearpoints of around five files of men; which made the phalanx almost impenetrable, and fearsome to oppose. The name \\"foot companions\\" was used coined by Alexander II during the reign of his father Philip II as a recruiting method. By labeling his infantry as his personal \\"companions\\" and \\"friends,\\" Philip was able to engage a wider manpower base for his subsequent military campaigns, as positions in his personal infantry would denote pride and honor. Tactically, the pezhetairoi were best used as a strong defensive line, rather than as shock troops. The length of the sarissa, while making them terrifying for an enemy to oppose, severely limited their maneuverability; and if they were taken in flank or rear they had little chance of responding. This was particularly clear at the Battle of Gaugamela in 331 BC, when the rapid advance of the right wing caused a breach to open between two of the battalions of pezhetairoi—a force of enemy cavalry broke through and, had it not been for a lack of discipline in their own command, under Parmenion, and for Alexander's placing of a second line of traditional hoplites in reserve, the phalanx might have been destroyed from the rear. Apart from in pitched battles, the pezhetairoi and their sarissas were not very practical; it is supposed that they were re-armed, and their tactics adapted, to suit the guerrilla warfare that was prevalent, and necessary, in Bactria and Sogdia. Asthetairoi There is a separate group of Pezheteroi called Asthetairoi (singular Asthetairos). There is a debate as it is not fully clear what the prefix (Greek: -) is referring to. Some claim it comes from asty (= city) or (= townsmen), which would mean the Asthetairoi were recruited from cities. But the units referred to as Asthetairoi where recruited in northern Macedonia, where there are just a few cities. Another suggestions say comes from aristoi (= the best) and thus implying they were some kind of elite. This would correspond to the fact, that they were placed on the right side next to the Hypaspists. The common conception is that Asthetairoi means 'closest companion' in terms of kinship and designated units from Upper Macedonia. Another explanation is that 'close' is referring to their position in battle, as they were the closest to the king. For fighting near the Hypaspists it is possible, that they were better trained and equipped than normal Pezheteroi.Macedonian Warrior: Alexander's Elite Infantryman Battalions The battalions of pezhetairoi appear to have been organised on a regional basis, at least to begin with. We know of battalions named for the regions of Orestis/Lyncestis (two battalions probably combining men from both regions), Elimaea and Tymphaea—if all pezhetairoi were from Upper Macedonia then we would expect the other battalions to have represented Eordaea and Pelagonia. In 334 BC Alexander the Great took six battalions of pezhetairoi with him to Asia. By the time the army moved into India in 327 BC, a seventh battalion had been added. * At the Battle of the Granicus the battalions were those of (from right to left): Perdiccas, Coenus, Amyntas, Philip, Meleager, and Craterus.Arrian, Alexander's Anabasis 1.14.2 * At the Battle of Issus the battalions were those of (from right to left): Coenus, Perdiccas, Craterus, Meleager, Ptolemy (replacing Philip), Amyntas.Arrian, Alexander's Anabasis 2.8.3–4. * At the Battle of Gaugamela the battalions were those of (from right to left): Coenus, Perdiccas, Meleager, Polyperchon (replacing Ptolemy), Simmias (deputising for Amyntas, who was recruiting in Macedonia), Craterus.Arrian, Alexander's Anabasis 3.11.9–10. * At the Battle of the Hydaspes River only five battalions took part, and were those of (from right to left): Antigenes, Clitus the White, Meleager, Attalus, Gorgias. The other battalions (those of Polyperchon and Alcetas) remained on the western bank of the Hydaspes, under the command of Craterus, and crossed only when Alexander was victorious, in order to continue with the pursuit of the fleeing Indians. However, there is much supposition and guesswork regarding this battle.Fuller, pp. 180–199. See also *Ancient Macedonian army *Hypaspists *Macedonian phalanx *Peltast  Notes  References  * F.E.

Overview On the battlefield Sarissophoroi wielded a weapon given the same name as the infantryman's (pezhetairos) pike, the sarissa; this was possibly in reality merely a longer version of the cavalry lance, the xyston. However, for scouting duties they carried javelins. They were amongst the most versatile of the Macedonian cavalry.English, p. 42 In the primary sources Arrian mentions that the Macedonian officer Aretes commanded the prodromoi, in the same context Curtius says that Aretes commanded the sarissophoroi. It would appear that the same unit of cavalry was known by both names.Arrian, trans. Hammond, p. 267 Scholarship is divided as to the ethnic composition of the sarissophoroi/prodromoi of the Macedonian army. Most authorities regard the sarissophoroi/prodromoi as being raised from Macedonians.Brunt, pp. 27-28 This would parallel the composition of the Athenian prodromoi, who were raised from the Thetes, the lowest census class of Athenian citizens.Gaebel, p. 178 Sekunda, however, gives them an origin from Thrace.Sekunda 2010, p. 454 Arrian usually differentiates the prodromoi of the Macedonian army from the Paeonian light cavalry, which suggests a fixed ethnic composition. This uncertainty is probably due to the lack of a definite understanding of the use of the term \\"prodromoi\\" by the primary sources.Gaebel, p. 178-179 Persian light cavalry took over the bulk of scouting duties when they became available to the Macedonian army following Gaugamela. The sarissophoroi then assumed a purely battlefield role as shock cavalry. It is possible that the sarissaphoroi, due to their skill in wielding long lances and their extensive battle experience, were considered more valuable in the role of shock cavalry, especially after the departure of the Thessalian cavalry. In battle the sarissophoroi were usually placed on the outer flank of the Companion cavalry. Four ilai, each 150 strong, of sarissophoroi/prodromoi operated with Alexander's army in Asia.Ashley. pp. 32-33 At Gaugamela, the sarissophoroi under Aretes were responsible for finally routing the Persian left wing cavalry, winning the battle in this sector. In their final charge they broke the Massagetae heavy cavalry, Aretes personally killing their leader.Ashley. p. 32Sidnell, p. 113 The sarissophoroi are last mentioned in the sources in 329BC, there is no firm evidence as to their fate. It is, however, assumed that they were absorbed into the companion cavalry, as their role as light cavalry was adequately covered by the availability of numerous Asiatic light horsemen.Brunt, p. 28 ReferencesBibliography *Ashley, J.R.

He was very influential in France's New Left, and considered one of \\"the most visible Marxists in the capitalist world\\" (Le Monde, 4 April 1972), in France as well as in Spain, Italy, Latin America, and India.  Biography  Henri Bettelheim, the father of Charles Bettelheim, was a Viennese Austrian of Jewish origin, and a representative of a Swiss bank in Paris. The family had to leave France after the beginning of the First World War in 1914. The Bettelheims lived in Switzerland then in Egypt. In 1922, Charles Bettelheim returned to Paris with his French mother, during which time his father, who was living in Egypt, committed suicide. After Adolf Hitler's rise to power in 1933, Charles Bettelheim broke away from his familiar environment, first joining the \\"Young Communists\\" (Jeunesses communistes), and subsequently the French Communist Party. In addition to his studies in philosophy, sociology, law and psychology, he also learned Russian. In July 1936, he arrived in Moscow with a tourist visa. Thanks to his mastery of the language, he was able to get a resident permit for five months, during which time he worked as a tourist guide, and later on with the French edition of the Moscow Journal, and finally at Mosfilm, where he directed film dubbing. His experiences during his Moscow stay, in the anxious atmosphere at the beginning of the \\"purges\\" and the trials of the Bolshevik leaders who opposed Joseph Stalin, made him keep a critical distance from the Soviet Union, without actually abandoning his Communist convictions. He was excluded from the Communist Party for his \\"slanderous\\" remarks. In 1937, he married a young militant Communist, Lucette Beauvallet. During the German occupation, he cooperated with the French Trotskyists (the Internationalist Workers Party). His decision to choose economics as a profession was not an easy one, since at that time economics was considered a minor science; however, inasmuch as he had become so knowledgeable about the Soviet Union and about economic planning, Bettelheim was able to fill a gap. After World War II, he became an official in the Ministry of Labor. In 1948 he entered the \\"Sixth Section\\" of the École Pratique des Hautes Études (EPHE). In the Fifties, Bettelheim began his international activities as an advisor to the governments of Third World countries; he was the spokesperson for Gamal Abdel Nasser in Egypt, for Jawaharlal Nehru in India, and for Ahmed Ben Bella in Algeria. In 1958, he created an institutional base for his research by founding the CEMI. In 1963, Che Guevara invited him to Cuba, where he participated in a \\"grand debate\\" on socialist economics. In 1966, Bettelheim was particularly interested in China. He helped the Union of Young Communists (Marxist–Leninist) with theoretical planning, without being directly affiliated with the organization. In his capacity as President of the Franco-Chinese Friendship Association (Association des amitiés Franco-Chinoises), he visited the People's Republic of China several times, in order to study new methods of industrial development created by the Cultural Revolution. After the death of Mao Zedong in 1976, Bettelheim was very critical of the new leaders (Hua Guofeng and Deng Xiaoping) who began to abandon Maoist principles, and replacing them with a politics of modernization which Bettelheim considered reactionary and authoritarian. From 1980 onward, Bettelheim fell more and more by the wayside—a result of the profound political changes in the Third World—and, in Europe, of the decline (and eventual dissolution) of \\"hard-line socialism\\", which rendered \\"obsolete\\" any debate over the paradigms of development in the Southern countries, in an atmosphere of planned economy independent of the world market—an economy to which Bettelheim had contributed so much. Bettelheim has written a book of memoirs which has remained unfinished. Until his death, Bettelheim lived in Paris. He did not publish anything in his later years. His student and long-time colleague Bernard Chavance is among the leading exponents of Regulation theory.  Thought  Despite his negative experiences in Moscow, Bettelheim retained a favorable attitude towards Soviet socialism until the Sixties, citing the economic accomplishments of the Soviet Union, which he appreciated from an independent point of view. In 1956, he endorsed the De-Stalinization inaugurated by Nikita Khrushchev at the Twentieth Congress of the Soviet Communist Party, as well as the reforms conceived by Soviet economist Evsei Liberman, suggesting a decentralization of decisions made within the planning leadership. = From the Cuban debate to the critique of \\"economism\\" = In the Cuban debate of 1963, Bettelheim was opposed to the voluntarist ideas of Che Guevara, who wanted to abolish free market and the production of merchandise through a very rapid and centralized industrialization, morally mobilizing \\"the new man.\\" Bettelheim took a position against this plan, to which Fidel Castro had also subscribed: both Che Guevara and Castro preferred the monoculture of sugar as the basis of Cuban economy, rather than a strict analogy to the economy of the Soviet Union. In Cuba, Bettelheim recommended a diversified economy, based on agriculture, prudent industrialization, broad central planning, mixed forms of property ownership with market elements—a pragmatic strategy similar to the \\"New Economic Policy\\" begun in Russia by Vladimir Lenin in 1922. Opposing Guevara, Bettelheim argued (in line with the last writings of Stalin) that the \\"law of value\\" was the manifestation of objective social conditions which could not be overcome by willful decisions, but only by a process of long-term social transformation. This debate demonstrated the profound differences which, from then on, separated Bettelheim from Marxist \\"orthodoxy\\", which considered Socialism as the result of \\"the development of maximum centralization of all forces of industrial production\\". For Bettelheim, socialism is rather an alternative voice in development; a process of transformation of social understandings. Inspired by the Chinese Cultural Revolution and the thought of Mao Zedong, and in cooperation with the Marxist philosopher Louis Althusser, Bettelheim was opposed to \\"economism\\" and to the \\"primacy of the means of production\\" of traditional Marxism: against the idea that socialist transformation of social bonds was a necessary effect of the development of the forces of production (liberating those bonds from them, according to Marxist orthodoxy, since private property dominates them in \\"bourgeois\\" society), he affirmed the necessity for actively and politically transforming social connections. In his book Economic Calculations and Forms of Ownership (Calcul économique et formes de proprieté), Bettelheim re-thinks the problems of transition to socialism, while criticizing the supposition that nationalization and state ownership of the means of production was already \\"socialist\\"—it is not the legal form of property, but true socialization of the web of production, which characterizes such a transition ; the crucial problem in socialist planning is the replacement of the form of \\"value\\" with the development of a method of measurement which takes into account the social utility of production. = Chinese experience and analysis of the Soviet Union = In China, Bettelheim had the impression that he was in the process of witnessing just such a process of transformation. More specifically, he noted that the Cultural Revolution—a revolution of the political, ideological and cultural superstructure—changed the industrial organization accompanying it by a general participation by the workers in all decisions, and overcoming the division of \\"manual\\" and \\"intellectual\\" labor. During these years, China was the benchmark for the Neo-Marxist \\"radical school of economics\\", represented by Bettelheim, Paul Sweezy, Andre Gunder Frank, Samir Amin and others who, by fighting against theories of \\"modernization,\\" affirmed that at the periphery of the worldwide capitalist system, in \\"under-developed\\" countries, \\"development\\" is only possible under conditions where these countries pry themselves free from their unequal and asymmetrical connections with the world market, dominated by imperialist countries, in order to choose a different and autonomous path: a development of production neither for profit, nor for an accumulation of abstract wealth, but for the needs of the people. Under the banner of such a \\"Maoist\\" approach, Bettelheim began his voluminous work on the history of the Soviet Union: Les luttes de classes en URSS (1974–1982) (Class Struggle in the USSR (1974–1982)), where he examines the reasons for the distortions of soviet socialism, which, according to Bettelheim, is nothing more than a \\"State Capitalism.\\" Bettelheim showed that after the October Revolution, the Bolsheviks had not succeeded in any long-term stabilization of the alliance between workers and poor peasants which had earlier been conceived by Lenin. During the 1920s, this alliance was replaced by an alliance of elite workers and technological intellectuals against the peasants, culminating in the forced collectivization of agriculture in 1928. \\"Economistic\\" ideology (the \\"primacy of the forces of production\\"), born in social-democracy and fed by the interests of the \\"worker aristocracy\\" and progressivist intellectuals, was resurrected by the enablement of the Bolshevik Party, acting as a legitimization of new technocratic elites which established the same divisions of labor and social differentiations, as had capitalism. However, the \\"legal\\" mirage, according to which the property of the State is defined as \\"socialist,\\" hides the actual exploitation. Finally, Bettelheim called into doubt the socialist character of the October Revolution, interpreting it as a seizing of power by a radical branch of the Russian intelligentsia, which \\"confiscated\\" a popular revolution. Bettelheim was a leading proponent of the thesis that \\"development\\" in the countries of the \\"Third World\\" necessitates a political break with imperialism and a distantanglement from the bonds of dependency on the unequal international division of labor of the world market. This position also includes a sharp criticism of the international role of the Soviet Union whose politics of development Bettelheim saw as just another variant of capitalist accumulation models. This theory saw a chance for a disentanglement of the political groundwork in order to practice an alternative development model, one that was not oriented towards accumulation and profit, but rather towards an economy for the everyday needs of the people, with a balanced proportion allowed between agriculture and industry. = Decline of the Marxist environment = When, in 1978, the People's Republic of China, under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping, put paid to the \\"Maoist\\" strategy of autarkic (tr. note: independent and self-sustaining) development, guided by political priorities, in order to reaffirm the primacy of the economy and to introduce itself into the world market, the theoreticians' paradigm of autonomous development lost the force of its convictions. At the same time, Marxism lost its influence, especially in France, where a wave of anti-Communism succeeded in discrediting not only the \\"archaeo-Communist\\" orthodoxy, but also Marxist critics such as Bettelheim. Bettelheim, who had never abandoned Marxist thinking, was condemned to disappear. In 1982, he published the two volumes of the third part of Class Struggle in the USSR, dedicated to the \\"dominated\\" and \\"dominators\\" of Stalinism, but the Marxist environment, in which Bettelheim had been rooted before, had dissolved. = Legacy = Although his name and work might have been forgotten, Charles Bettelheim has left some tracks. His heterodox Marxist thinking has helped bring into doubt the \\"Progressivism\\" and \\"Productivism\\" of classic leftism, giving rise to \\"alternative\\" thinking, which not only gave birth to the idea of \\"social emancipation from industrial growth\\" as an end in itself, but aspired to put productive development into the context of social consciousness (basically, it was no more than the idea originated by Karl Marx: to end the submission of social action to the process of production, in favor of conscious submission to production for social needs). Thus, Bettelheim was an intermediary between \\"red\\" thinking and \\"green\\", between socialism and ecology. In the realm of economic theory, his analysis, distinguishing different forms of capitalism, influenced the school of \\"Regulation.\\"  Publications  * La planification soviétique.

The preface of the Gospel of Mark in Codex Gigas (13th century). Image of page from the 7th century Book of Durrow, from The Gospel of Mark. Trinity College Dublin.  Text  The original text was written in Koine Greek. This chapter is divided into 45 verses. =Textual witnesses= Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter are: *Papyrus 137 (2nd/3rd century; extant verses 7–9, 16–18) *Codex Vaticanus (325-350; complete) *Codex Sinaiticus (330-360; omit verse 33) *Codex Bezae (~400; complete) *Codex Washingtonianus (~400; complete) *Codex Alexandrinus (400-440; complete) *Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus (~450; extant verses 18-45) Opening: Verse 1 : The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God KJV The opening verse of the Gospel of Mark states right from the start Mark's belief. American academic Robert J. Miller translates it as \\"The good news of Jesus the Anointed\\", on the basis that χριστου means \\"anointed\\" and the phrase υιου του θεου is not present in a few early witnesses. The \\"beginning\\" could refer to the beginning of the book, or the next verse,\\"The gospel of Jesus the Anointed begins with something Isaiah the prophet wrote:\\" 1:1-2a Scholars Version, Miller 1994, p. 13 or the beginning of the story of Jesus, as Mark is only beginning to tell the reader about Jesus' life, not writing his entire biography. By saying he is the anointed, Mark is declaring Jesus the Messiah, the successor to King David. Mark always uses \\"Christ\\" which is derived from the Greek translation, he never uses \\"Messias\\" () which is derived from the Greek transliteration of the Aramaic word for \\"Messiah\\". \\"Son of God\\" can be seen as synonymous with a political messiah, in this case the King of the Jews, but can also be seen as expressing divinity, as in the phrase \\"God the Son\\". Only the demonic opponents of Jesus call him this in Mark until the centurion in . The \\"good news\\" could refer to the news about Jesus or from Jesus or Jesus as the good news or a combination of them all. Henry Barclay Swete's Introduction to the Old Testament in Greek, pages 456–457 states: :\\" [Good news or Gospel] in the LXX occurs only in the plural, and perhaps only in the classical sense of 'a reward for good tidings' ( [also , , , ]); in the NT it is from the first appropriated to the Messianic good tidings (Mark 1:1, ), probably deriving this new meaning from the use of in , , 60:6, 61:1.\\" Some old manuscripts (such as Codex Koridethi (Θ; 038), Minuscule 28) omit \\"Son of God\\", but Wasserman concludes that the omission was accidental.Wasserman, Tommy (2011) \\"The 'Son of God' was in the Beginning (Mark 1:1)\\".

TC: A Journal of Biblical Textual Criticism. Vol 20. Pages 1-8. .The original version this verse in the Codex Sinaiticus did not include the phrase \\"the Son of God\\", but later was added by a corrector (\\"S1\\"). Announcement of the prophetsVerses 2–3= :As it is written in the Prophets: ::\\"Behold, I send My messenger before Your face, ::Who will prepare Your way before You.\\" NKJV ::\\"The voice of one crying in the wilderness: ::\\"'Prepare the way of the Lord;'' ::Make His paths straight.'\\" NKJV In the Greek texts of Mark edited by Westcott and Hort, Samuel Prideaux Tregelles and the Society of Biblical Literature, the prophecies quoted are described as being written \\"εν τω ησαια τω προφητη\\" (en tō Ēsaia tō prophētē, \\"in the prophet Isaiah\\"), as they are in manuscripts B, D, L, Δ and א,Meyer's NT Commentary on Mark 1, accessed 9 November 2017 whereas the Textus Receptus reads \\"εν τοις προφηταις\\" (en tois προφῆται, \\"in the prophets\\") in line with many other ancient manuscripts and patristic writings. Some think this might indicate that Mark did not use a complete Jewish Bible but instead used a general collection of quotations from them. Protestant theologian Heinrich Meyer suggests that the reference to Isaiah is authentic but it was a \\"mistake of memory\\". The quote appears to be a composite from the books of Exodus (), Malachi (3:1) and Isaiah (40:3),Novum Testamentum Graece, Nestle-Aland, \\"Kata Markon 1\\", 27th edition, 1979, Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft Stuttgart, p. 88. See article on: Novum Testamentum Graece linking the gospel of Jesus with a fulfillment of the \\"Old Testament\\". Mark assumes they refer to John the Baptist or applies them to him. The passage from Malachi describes one who will prepare the way of God for God. Mark has changed the statement of Malachi, which refers to Elijah returning to prepare God's way, to one in which John is seen as Elijah, because the spirit of Elijah rested on him and \\"my\\" way has been changed to \\"your\\" way, i.e. Jesus' way. Mark thus might be equating Jesus with God. In more detail, it appears Mark has taken part of Exodus 23:20 of the Septuagint: (Brenton Ex 23:20: \\"behold, I send my angel before thy face\\") and combined it with part of Malachi 3:1 of the Septuagint: (Brenton Mal 3:1: \\"survey the way\\") to create in the Westcott-Hort Greek NT: . The significant differences are (\\"survey\\" -Brenton) is replaced with (\\"prepare\\" -NRSV) and a final (\\"your\\" -NRSV) has been added: \\"See, I am sending my messenger ahead of you,Gk. before your face who will prepare your way\\" ( in the NRSV). The following quote of Isaiah 40:3 is specifically from the Septuagint,Novum Testamentum Graece, p.88; also Catholic Encyclopedia: Septuagint Version: \\"We know also that the writers of the New Testament made use of it, borrowing from it most of their citations; it became the Old Testament of the Church and was so highly esteemed by the early Christians that several writers and Fathers declared it to be inspired. The Christians had recourse to it constantly in their controversies with the Jews, who soon recognized its imperfections, and finally rejected it in favour of the Hebrew text or of more literal translations (Aquila, Theodotion).\\", see also Hexapla compare Brenton Isa 40:3: \\"The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight the paths of our God.\\" to the Masoretic Text : \\"Hark! one calleth: 'Clear ye in the wilderness the way of the LORD, make plain in the desert a highway for our God.\\" or the NRSV : \\"A voice cries out: ‘In the wilderness prepare the way of the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.\\" or the new JPS Tanakh (1985) 40:3: \\"A voice rings out: Clear in the desert A road for the Lord! Level in the wilderness A highway for our God!\\" All four gospels use the quote from Septuagint Isaiah: it is in Luke in , Matthew in Matthew 3:3, and John in . This section of Isaiah is about the return journey home from the Babylonian captivity and was a passage Jews often used as a way of expressing the help of God. Isaiah probably uses this passage symbolically to describe moral cleansing and renewal. Thus John is linked to Isaiah as well and once again Mark equates the lord of this passage, Yahweh, with Jesus.  John the Baptist  Sand Mountains in the Negev John the Baptist in the Wilderness by Geertgen tot Sint Jans Mark describes John's activities, preaching repentance and forgiveness of sins and baptising in the Jordan river. He says he wore camel hair, a leather belt, and survived on locusts and wild honey. His clothes resemble Elijah's as described in . There is also the prophecy of true prophet's clothing in the Book of Zechariah . His diet may have been his attempt at purity. There has been much speculation that John was an Essene, perhaps also Jesus, but there is no hard evidence either way. According to Luke, Jesus and John were relatives () and John is described as being a Nazarite from birth (). All portraits of him paint him as certainly an ascetic, but also as a popular and respected preacher. This portrait of John is somewhat the same but somewhat different from the one Josephus gives us. Josephus states that John baptized, but not for the forgiveness of sins and that he was a great leader of the people, making no mention of Jesus regarding John. This difference might show how Mark views John, as a representative of Elijah and merely the herald of who Mark deems the more important, Jesus. According to the Q hypothesis John baptising was also found at the beginning of that book as well. John is revered in Mandaeism. Many people from Judea and (or 'including') : New Living Translation Jerusalem come to confess their sins and be baptised by John. Lutheran pietist Johann Bengel makes the point that \\"capital cities are [often] not readily wont to follow a new institution [a new mode of life preached for the first time]\\".Bengel, J. A., Bengel's Gnomon on Mark 1, accessed 27 May 2018 John tells them \\"After me will come one more powerful than I, the thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie. I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit\\". Untying someone's sandals was a task commonly done by someone's slave. What baptising with the Holy Spirit refers to, as Jesus never baptises in Mark, is uncertain if one only considers Mark. has Jesus' disciples (but not Jesus) baptising at the same time as John the Baptist. (See also Paraclete, , , , ). Matthew 3:11 and Luke 3:16 specify baptism with holy spirit and fire. =Verse 7= : And he preached, saying, :: “There comes One after me who is mightier than I, whose sandal strap I am not worthy to stoop down and loose.” NKJV =Verse 8= :: “I indeed baptized you with water, but He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.” NKJV Some see John's statement patterned on the Book of Exodus, in . Other books used this pattern to describe other prophets, such as Hosea in and . The Jesus Seminar concluded that this was one of the authentic (\\"red\\") acts of Jesus, recorded in , , , Gospel of the Ebionites 1, and which it calls \\"A voice in the wilderness\\".  Jesus' baptism and temptation Appearance of Christ to the People, by Alexander Ivanov, 1837-57 Jesus is one of the many who come to be baptised, in his case from Nazareth in Galilee. Since John, according to Mark, baptised repentance for the forgiveness of sins () some have argued Jesus also is coming to be forgiven for his sins; but Mark notes that John says that he is unworthy (Mark 1:7-8). Mark also has John's function as preparing things for Jesus, and some argue this baptism is meant to forward the fulfillment of Jesus' plan. has John say his baptism was his method of revealing Jesus to Israel. Perhaps Jesus is doing this to embrace the doctrine of baptism and repentance of sins and his oneness with those who embrace it. The Epistle to the Hebrews, in Hebrews 4:15, says Jesus was \\"just as we are — yet was without sin\\" and states: \\"...sin is lawlessness.\\" Mark introduces Jesus without a history or a description, suggesting the intended reader already has heard of him. Mark, like the other Gospels, gives no physical description of Jesus, unlike the short previous description of John. Mark's readers are assumed already to know about the two of them. John baptizes him and Jesus then sees a theophany. He sees \\"heaven being torn open\\" (, schizomenous, rent open), \\"and the spirit descending on him like a dove\\",: NIV translation) and hears a voice telling him that he is God's son whom God loves, and with whom God is well pleased. The vision could be related to a Psalm , as well as Isaiah 42:1. The \\"opening of the heavens\\" So translated, for example in the King James Version, but translated as their being \\"torn apart\\" in the New Revised Standard Version is often seen as the union and beginning of communication between God and the world. Whether anyone else besides Jesus saw this has been often debated: says the Spirit descended in \\"bodily\\" form; says John said he saw the Spirit descend onto Jesus. Some have speculated that this event may have been a story that has its origins in the Early Christian practice of baptism, although Franciscan theologian Robert J. Karris Noted Scripture scholar Robert Karris develops book of reflections for 30 days, published 17 September 2012, accessed 13 May 2018 argues that this is unlikely. Some have argued that since Mark begins his story here, at the baptism, that this could be seen as a form of adoption, as it is God's action which changed Jesus' life, although Mark probably is confirming their preexistent relationship. Jesus is never declared as God's adopted son anywhere in the book, but Mark does not exactly state how or when Jesus became God's son. Both Matthew and Luke use their infancy narratives to show that Jesus was God's son from the moment of conception, and John 1:1 has him as the word of God from the moment of creation. The voice from heaven calls Jesus \\"beloved\\". Some see a relationship between this description and that of Isaac in Genesis , where Abraham had shown his devotion to God by being willing to sacrifice his son, so God shows his love for humanity by actually sacrificing his son, see also Substitutionary atonement. There is also the possible link with this and the beloved servant of God in , , , and . Christ in the desert by Ivan Kramskoi The spirit then \\"at once\\", kai , sends him out into the desert to be tempted by Satan for forty days. Forty is a common numerological device in the Bible, such as the forty days of the flood in and the forty years of the Israelites wandering in the desert in Exodus. Elijah also spent forty days and nights travelling to Mount Horeb in . Unlike Matthew 4:1-11 and the number of temptations or what they were are not described. Mark does say that Angels came to minister to him. Karris argues the angels and the wilderness are related to . John is put into prison, presumably by Herod Antipas. Mark uses the term ' to describe John being \\"turned over\\", which Mark also uses to describe Jesus being arrested during his Passion. Mark has already highlighted two themes, Jesus' power from and favor of God, contrasted with his confrontation with Satan and John being arrested, showing his power and mission have already encountered the most extreme challenges both from the authorities of this world and supernatural powers. The Jesus Seminar concluded that parts of these accounts were authentic (\\"red\\") acts of Jesus, specifically: \\"John baptizes Jesus\\": , Matthew 3:13-17, , Gospel of the Ebionites 4; and \\"Jesus proclaims the gospel\\": Mark 1:14–15.  Calling of the four disciples  Landscape in northern Israel Fisherman in the Sea of Galilee, 1890-1900 Petrusaltar: Jesus stutzt Petrus auf dem Wasser, Luis Borrassá, c.1400 =Verses 14–15= : Now after John was put in prison, Jesus came to Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God, : and saying, \\"The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand. Repent, and believe in the gospel.\\" NKJV *\\"The kingdom of God\\": is a major theme of Jesus' teaching and of the debate among interpreters and scholars, with discussion mainly 'centering around the nature of the kingdom (earthly, heavenly, or both) and the kingdom’s arrival (present, future, or both)', as well as the relationship between the kingdom of God and Jesus himself.Note on Mark 1:15 in NET *\\"Is at hand\\": or \\"has drawn near\\" (NKJV);Note on Mark 1:15 in NKJV \\"has come near\\" (ESV);Note on Mark 1:15 in ESV Jesus then goes into Galilee, preaching \\"The kingdom of God is near (ēngiken). Repent and believe the gospel (euangelion)!\\" The kingdom of God can be seen as a physical or spiritual place. It could also be translated as \\"God's imperial rule\\", indicating the power of God over all things. The gospel is seen as not just God's message but his actions. Jesus here links the coming of God with the term ēngiken (Strong's G1448), which some see as meaning \\"near\\" as in \\"upcoming in the future\\" but others argue it means \\"near\\" as in Jesus himself is near and the coming of God has arrived. These are then linked with repentance, a change of heart, and then belief. Belief and repentance are thus what Jesus says God desires. See also Justification (theology). Jesus goes to the Sea of Galilee and finds Simon (whom he will name Rock (Peter) in ) and his brother Andrew. They are fishing, a large business then in Galilee. He speaks the famous phrase \\"Come, follow me,...and I will make you fishers of men.\\" Some have argued their status as fishermen is metaphorical, based perhaps on , but Karris argues that their occupations as fishermen was historical and related by Mark to show the costliness of being a disciple, as they had to leave a presumably thriving business. Andrew was a disciple of John the Baptist according to John. He only appears three times in Mark, here, and in and . They follow him and then soon come upon James and John (whom he will name the Sons of Thunder in ), who also quickly join the group, \\"they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men.\\" Peter, James, and John will play a prominent part in several incidents in the Gospel. Mark does not relate that Jesus convinced them to follow him in any way. Mark simply has them follow him without question. Kilgallen argues that historically this calling was not so sudden, with perhaps a prior meeting, but Mark has shortened it for extra effect to emphasize total devotion to Jesus. John relates Jesus convincing Nathanael to join the group. Mark says they had nets in Mark 1:16 and they and their father, Zebedee, employed other men in . Karris argues this shows they had money and a high probability of being educated, with a knowledge of the Jewish Bible. Others point to to show that they were unschooled, but Karris argues against reading this too literally. has Andrew and someone else who are with John the Baptist follow Jesus after John calls him the Lamb of God. They then bring Simon to Jesus, who gives him the Aramaic name Cephas, meaning Rock (Peter). Philip and Nathanael are then called secondly, not James and John. The calling of disciples is also found in and Matthew 4:18–22. =Verse 16= :And as He walked by the Sea of Galilee, He saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen. NKJV Bauckham makes interesting observations pertaining to the prominence of Simon Peter's name in the Gospel of Mark: * The name is first mentioned in this verse. * It is also the first among disciples' name to be noted * Mark consistently uses 'Simon' until 3:16 when Jesus change the name to 'Peter', which is since used more often until the last mention in Mark 16:7 * The appearance of 'Simon' (first time) in this verse and 'Peter' (last time) in Mark 16:7 form a literary inclusio of eyewitness testimony to indicate Peter as the main eyewitness source.  Jesus in Capernaum and the tour of Galilee  A 1923 map showing Galilee circa 50 AD. Capernaum is in the upper right while Nazareth is towards the centre. Jesus and the four go to Capernaum, which Mark has as Jesus's center of activity and Jesus teaches in the synagogue on the sabbath. Eventually, in , at the Transfiguration of Jesus, Mark uses the technical term , ', \\"rabbi\\", meaning a Jewish teacher of Mosaic Law. See also Rabboni. Gathering disciples (students) and teaching are thus the first part of what Jesus does to proclaim the kingdom of God. Mark does not relate what Jesus taught, which could mean he left it out because he did not deem it important enough for his book or because he did not know what Jesus taught there. Some archaeologists believe a synagogue in Capernaum that has been excavated lies on top of the synagogue that existed at this time that would have been the one Jesus would have gone to. Anyone who showed a sufficient knowledge of the scriptures could preach in the synagogue. Mark says the people thought Jesus taught with \\"authority\\", which the scribes did not. The scribes would answer questions in a traditional, official manner, see also Pharisaic Principles and Values. Jesus in Mark operates on no authority but his own judgement. According to Jesus attended the Marriage at Cana before going to Capernaum. He then performs an exorcism on a demon possessed man. Curing people, especially possessed people, will be another major method Jesus uses in his mission in Mark. The demon recognizes Jesus as \\"the Holy one of God\\", the first time Jesus' supernatural opponents are shown to know his true identity. Jesus simply says \\"Be quiet, and come out of him!\\", healing the man with words alone. The people are amazed. This follows a path Mark often uses, that of a description of the affliction, Jesus' cure of the affliction, and then a demonstration of the cure to others. The power of Jesus' word over the demon might be Mark's way of trying to show to his audience, perhaps under the threat of persecution, that Jesus' message will overcome evil. By showing Jesus' teaching first before his exorcism Mark might be placing emphasis on Jesus' teachings as more important that any miracle he could perform. There were several people who were claimed to have the ability to perform exorcisms in the ancient world and many ancient opponents of Christianity dismissed Jesus as just another magician.For example, Origen, Contra Celsus 1.28: \\"born in a certain Jewish village, of a poor woman of the country, who gained her subsistence by spinning, and who was turned out of doors by her husband, a carpenter by trade, because she was convicted of adultery; that after being driven away by her husband, and wandering about for a time, she disgracefully gave birth to Jesus, an illegitimate child, who having hired himself out as a servant in Egypt on account of his poverty, and having there acquired some miraculous powers, on which the Egyptians greatly pride themselves, returned to his own country, highly elated on account of them, and by means of these proclaimed himself a God.\\" Most descriptions of exorcisms at the time tended to involve the exorcist tricking the spirit or demon into leaving the victim by convincing them the exorcist had more power than the being, not a method Jesus employs. Parallels in Hellenistic cultural stories of exorcisms differ in that they usually involve an associated disease, which is not the case here. John P. Meier sees a clear distinction between these incidents and descriptions of magicians at the time. Capernaum, Israel They go to Peter and Andrew's house and Jesus cures Peter's sick mother-in-law. The house was presumably near the synagogue. She then gets up and helps Jesus and his companions. Attending to her guests would have been her social duty in the Jewish culture. Mark uses the term ', \\"to lift up\\", to describe Jesus' cure of her, followed by ', \\"she served\\", which some have seen as a theological message about Jesus' power requiring service. Karris argues for this event's historicity, perhaps based on an eyewitness. A story about Peter's mother-in- law might have survived due to the popularity of Peter among early Christians. Peter is clearly listed here as having a wife, as Jesus healed his mother-in- law. Paul says that other Apostles, Cephas (Peter), and Jesus' brothers have wives, but not him, in . See also Clerical celibacy. It is now night. Mark says \\"That evening after sunset …,\\" one of his examples of redundancy as evening and after sunset are really the same thing repeated. Neither Luke and Matthew retain this redundancy. By this time word has spread and the people have brought the sick and possessed for Jesus to heal, which he does. Mark says the \\"whole city\\" came to see Jesus, which is probably an exaggeration. Both Luke and Matthew just state there were many people. The demons leaving the possessed people are not allowed to tell people who Jesus is, a common theme of Mark called the Messianic Secret. Jesus is able to cure every affliction of the people who come to see him. He then leaves town very early in the morning for solitary prayer. Mark says πρωι εννυχον λιαν (prōi ennycha lian, \\"very early, it being yet night\\",: Young's Literal Translation a complicated description of time employing three adverbs. His disciples find him and tell him that everyone is looking for him. He says \\"Let us go somewhere else\\", to the nearby villages and he will preach to them there also. He says \\"That is why I have come\\", using the word εξηλθον ('),Mark 1:38 - εξεληλυθα (exēlthuma) is used in the Textus Receptus with its ex- prefix focusing on the place from which he has come, which some see as meaning a statement about Jesus' divine mandate or possibly a rejection of Capernaum: there is no general agreement on these points. He then travels over all of Galilee, preaching and healing. He cures a leper who comes to him asking for a cure and tells him to show the priests and offer the cleaning sacrifices Moses had commanded (), but not to tell people that Jesus had done it. Jesus here seems to stress the importance of the Mosaic law, see also Expounding of the Law. This episode is also recorded in the Egerton Gospel 2:1-4. People have seen Jesus telling the man to be quiet about what had happened as related to the Messianic Secret, although it could be Jesus just telling the man to immediately go to the priests. Leprosy could mean many skin diseases, such as favus or psoriasis. Mark says Jesus had \\"compassion\\" for the man, although a few manuscripts say he was angry, and some have argued that angry was the original word intentionally changed to make Jesus look less angry, as he is described as giving a \\"stern\\", ', warning to the man in verse 43. Mark however also shows Jesus' anger in many other places, such as and the incident at the Temple, see also Expounding of the Law#Anger. Bruce Metzger's Textual Commentary on the Greek NT postulates a possible \\"confusion between similar words in Aramaic (compare Syriac ethraham, \\"he had pity,\\" with ethra'em, \\"he was enraged\\").\\" See also Aramaic primacy. The man then seems to disobey and spreads the news, increasing Jesus' popularity even more. Whether or not he ever made it to the priests Mark does not say. This is the first of many times in Mark that Jesus unsuccessfully tries to conceal his workings by telling people to keep what he has done a secret. Karris argues that one could also read it as Jesus \\"spreading the news\\", not the man. Verse 45 The chapter ends with Jesus returning to the \\"deserted\\" or \\"lonely\\" places, , ep eremois topois, which have been mentioned throughout the chapter (), but the people follow him there too. Comparison with other canonical gospels Matthew records these events in Matthew 3-4 without an explicit mention of the exorcism and the curing of Peter's mother-in-law. The curing of the leper then appears in Matthew 8:1-4 after the Sermon on the Mount, along with the healing of Peter's mother-in-law in . Luke largely has the same order as Mark in except that Jesus calls his disciples after meeting Peter and curing his mother-in-law. Luke also has Jesus going to Nazareth after his temptation and arguing with the people there. Matthew says he left Nazareth and went to Galilee, but does not relate what happened there. John records Jesus' baptism and calling of disciples in John 1. John also has Jesus' disciples baptising at the same time as John the Baptist and so has more occur before John's arrest than the Synoptics do.

Definitions vary widely for what constitutes a smallholder or small-scale farm, including factors such as size, food production technique or technology, involvement of family in labor and economic impact. Smallholdings are usually farms supporting a single family with a mixture of cash crops and subsistence farming. As a country becomes more affluent, smallholdings may not be self-sufficient, but are valued primarily for the rural lifestyle that they provide for the owners, who often do not earn their livelihood from the farm. As the sustainable food and local food movements grow in affluent countries, some of these smallholdings are gaining increased economic viability. There are an estimated 500 million smallholder farms in the world, supporting almost two billion people. Small scale agriculture is often in tension with industrial agriculture, which finds efficiencies by increasing outputs, monoculture, consolidating land under big agricultural operations, and economies of scale. Certain labor intensive cash-crops, such as cocoa production in Ghana or Cote d'Ivoire, rely heavily on small holders; globally, as of 2008 90% of cocoa is grown by smallholders. Similar supply chains exist in other crops like coffee, palm oil, and bananas. In other markets, the importance of small scale agriculture in local economies has also increased food system investment in small holders. Today some companies try to include smallholdings into their value chain, providing seed, feed or fertilizer to improve production. Some say that this model shows benefits for both parties. Because smallholding farms frequently require less industrial inputs and can be an important way to improve food security in less developed contexts, addressing the productivity and financial sustainability of small holders is an international development priority and measured by indicator 2.3 of Sustainable Development Goal 2. In some geographies, pressure from land grabbing by industrial agriculture and soil degradation can lead small holders seeking economic viability to destroy local ecosystems and biodiversity. Increasing productivity, especially amongst small holder farms, is an important way to decrease the amount of land needed for farming and slow environmental degradation through processes like deforestation. Since agriculture has such large impacts on climate change, Project Drawdown described \\"Sustainable Intensification for Smallholders\\" an important method for climate change mitigation.  Productivity  Small farms have many economic advantages. Local farmers generate a local economy in their rural communities. An American study showed that small farms with incomes of $100,000 or less spend almost 95 percent of their farm-related expenses within their local communities. The same study took in comparison the fact that farms with incomes greater than $900,000 spend less than 20 percent of their farm- related expenses in the local economy. Thus, small-scale agriculture supports local economy. Agricultural productivity is variously measured, and large- scale farming is often less efficient than small sustainable farms. Industrial single crop creates a high output per worker whilst, small-scale farmers produce more food per acre of land. Small-scale agriculture often sell products directly to the consumers. Disintermediation gives the farmer the profit that would otherwise go to the wholesaler, the distributor and the supermarket. About two thirds of the selling price would actually be lost for product marketing. Meanwhile, if farmers sell their products directly to consumers, they recover the totality of their product  Commonwealth countries  Smallholdings in Britain = In British English usage, a smallholding is a piece of land and its adjacent living quarters for the smallholder and stabling for farm animals. It is usually smaller than a farm but larger than an allotment, usually under . It is often established for breeding farm animals organically on free-range pastures. Alternatively, the smallholder may concentrate on growing vegetables by traditional methods or, in a more modern way, using plastic covers, polytunneling or cloches for quick growth. Generally, a smallholding offers its owner a means of achieving self- sufficiency for its family's needs. They may be able to supplement their income by selling surplus produce at a farmers' market or at a permanent shop on the smallholding. = Hobby farms in Australia = In Western Australia, many small acre farms were established under the Agricultural Land Purchase Act to encourage settlement. The government purchased large land grants held by absentee owners and subdivided them according to the best use for the land: the development of orchids in Coondle, viticulture, horse breeding, sheep grazing, and high density crops like corn, and broad acre crops like wheat. A hobby farm in Australia is a variety of smallholding that may be as small as 2 hectares up to a self-sustaining farm size, that allows the \\"city farmer\\" to have a house and a small number of animals or small crop fields or grape vines. In Western Australia, they are often termed Special Rural Properties for planning purposes. = Lifestyle blocks in New Zealand = In New Zealand, a lifestyle block is a smallholding valued primarily for the rural lifestyle it affords. Planning restrictions on subdividing farm land often lead to the creation of lifestyle blocks of minimum permissible size near urban areas.  Developing countries  In many developing countries, a smallholding is a small plot of land with low rental value, used to grow crops.Bunnett, R.B. (2002). Interactive Geography 4, pp. 125, 315. SNP Pan Pacific Publishing. . By some estimates, there are 525 million smallholder farmers in the world.Nagayets,Oksana (2005). The Future of Small Farms. International Food Policy Research Institute and Overseas Development Institute Vision 2020 Initiative, p. 356. Smallholders dominate production in certain key sectors such as coffee and cocoa. Various types of agribusinesses work with smallholding farmers in a range of roles including buying crops, providing seed, and acting as financial institutions.International Finance Corporation (2013). Working with Smallholders: A Handbook for Firms Building Sustainable Supply Chains, p. 12. http://www.farms2firms.org In low income countries, women make up 43 percent of small holding agricultural labor, but produce 60-80 of food crops. =Thailand= In 1975, there were 4.2 million smallholder farming households in Thailand. In 2013, Thailand had 5.9 million smallholder farming households. The average area of these smallholdings had shrunk from 3.7 hectares to 3.2 hectares over that period. Instead of farms getting larger and less numerous, as has been the case in the Global North, the reverse happened: they got smaller and more numerous.

He also won fame for his portrait work, winning the prestigious Archibald Prize for portraiture in 1939 and 1940. Early life Meldrum was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, son of Edward David Meldrum, chemist, and his wife Christine, née Macglashan. The family emigrated to Australia in 1889. Meldrum studied at the National Gallery School in Melbourne. In 1899, he won the Victorian Travelling Scholarship, under which he chose to complete his art education in Paris.Meldrum, Max. \\"The Science of Appearances\\", 1950. Soon after, he became dissatisfied with the academic conventions of the Paris schools and left them to study on his own.Colahan, Colin. \\"Max Meldrum:His Art and Views\\", 1925. He returned to Melbourne to his family in 1912, where he lived with his parents in East Melbourne, then at St Kilda. In 1915 he took a studio at 527 Collins Street, for a time sharing it with Harley Griffiths senior. Career He ran the Meldrum School of Painting there between 1916 and 1926. Among his students were Clarice Beckett, Colin Colahan, Auguste Cornels, Percy Leason, John Farmer, Polly Hurry, Justus Jorgensen and Arnold Shore, and had considerable influence on the work of his friend Alexander Colquhoun, whose son Archibald was also a Meldrum student at that time. In 1916-17 he was elected president of the Victorian Artists' Society, but was dropped from the position amidst controversy the following year, inspiring his students to form a breakaway group, the Twenty Melbourne Painters Society, which remains active in the Melbourne arts scene to this day. Drawing on Meldrum's principles, the group released a statement describing their central tenet: Meldrum influenced the young Albert Ernest Newbury. Personal life While living in France, he married Jeanne Eugenie Nitsch, a singer with the Opéra-Comique. Meldrum and his wife returned to Australia in 1931. Meldrum criticized Nora Heysen's 1938 Archibald win, saying that women could not be expected to paint as well as men. The following year, he won the Archibald prize himself. Death Meldrum died on 6 June 1955 in Kew, Victoria, aged 79.

Etymology  Medvejie is derived from the Russian word meaning \\"bear.\\" Most likely the lake's name comes as a holdover from Russian colonization of Alaska and the Sitka area. Also known as: *Bear Lake *Medvejia Lake Geography Medvejie Lake and the Medvejie Lake valley is nestled between the hulks of Bear Mountain and Cupola Peak at 243 feet (73 meters) of elevation. Little forested land exists between the mountains and shores of the lake owing to the precipitous rise of surrounding topography. As such, the geography of the area creates a narrow natural wind tunnel making blowdowns very common inside the valley. In the winter, with little or no water flowing into the lake due to all precipitation in the lake's watershed falling as snow, the lake usually freezes over and slowly shrinks into itself abandoning shards of ice that are strewn on the exposed former lakebottom. Medvejie Lake's outlet stream empties into Bear Cove, Silver Bay, and the Pacific Ocean. Temperature The temperature in the Medvejie Lake valley, partly due to sunlight blocked by surrounding peaks (but also because of air cooled by snow from surrounding mountains and icefields that flows into the valley basin), is roughly five degrees colder than Sitka or the Medvejie Fish Hatchery's temperature. A salmon hatchery sits at the mouth of Medvejie Lake's roughly mile-long outlet stream. Outdoor opportunities Medvejie Lake serves as a recreational gateway to inland destinations such as Peak 5390 and Indigo Lake. Medvejie Lake is also the beginning (or ending) segment of the Baranof Cross-Island Trail. Two modes exist to travel past the lake and up the valley: An untidy and bouldery hunter's trail along the north shore of the lake, and an assortment of communal canoes and paddles are located at the outlet of the lake.

Twelve people were killed, including seven crew on board the ship, and the five occupants of four cars which fell 45 m (150 feet) after driving off the bridge. Hobart was cut-off from its eastern suburbs, and the loss of the road connection had a major social impact. The ship’s master was officially penalised for inattention and failure to handle his vessel in a seamanlike manner.  Collision and collapse  Model showing the scene on the bottom of the Derwent River right The collision occurred at 9:27 p.m. (Australian Eastern Summer Time UTC+11) on Sunday 5 January 1975. The bulk carrier Lake Illawarra, carrying 10,000 tonnes of zinc ore concentrate, was heading up the Derwent River to offload its cargo to the Electrolytic Zinc Company at Risdon, upstream from Hobart and about 3 km from the bridge. The 1,025 m long main viaduct of the bridge was composed of a central main navigation span, two flanking secondary navigation spans, and 19 approach spans. The ship was off course as it neared the bridge, partly due to the strong tidal current but also because of inattention by the ship's master, Captain Boleslaw Pelc. Initially approaching the bridge at eight knots, Pelc slowed the ship to a 'safe' speed. Although the Lake Illawarra was capable of passing through the bridge's central navigation span, the captain attempted to pass through one of the eastern spans. Despite several changes of course, the ship proved unmanageable due to its insufficient speed relative to the current. In desperation the captain ordered 'full speed astern', at which point all control was lost. The vessel drifted towards the bridge midway between the central navigation span and the eastern shore, crashing into the pile capping of piers 18 and 19, bringing three unsupported spans and a 127 m section of roadway crashing into the river and onto the vessel's deck. The ship listed to starboard and sank within minutes in 35 m of water a short distance to the south. Seven crew members on the Lake Illawarra were trapped and drowned. The subsequent marine court of inquiry found that the captain had not handled the ship in a proper and seamanlike manner, and his certificate was suspended for six months. As the collision occurred on a Sunday evening, there was relatively little traffic on the bridge. While no cars were travelling between the 18th and 19th pylons when that section collapsed, four cars drove over the gap, killing five occupants. Two drivers managed to stop their vehicles at the edge, but not before their front wheels had dropped over the lip of the bridge deck. One of these cars contained Frank and Sylvia Manley. > Sylvia Manley: \\"As we approached, it was a foggy night ... there was no > lights on the bridge at the time. We just thought there was an accident. We > slowed down to about 40 km/h and I'm peering out the window, desperately > looking to see the car ... what was happening on the bridge. We couldn't see > anything but we kept on travelling. The next thing, I said to Frank, \\"The > bridge is gone!\\" And he just applied the brakes and we just sat there > swinging. As we sat there, we couldn't see anything in the water. All we > could see was a big whirlpool of water and apparently the boat was sinking. > So with that, we undid the car door and I hopped out.\\" > Frank Manley: \\"[Sylvia] said \\"The white line, the white line's gone.

There's a > big automatic transmission pan underneath [the car] – that's what it > balanced on.\\" The other car contained Murray Ling, his wife Helen and two of their children. They were driving over the bridge in the east-bound lanes when the span lights went out.\\"I knew something bad must have happened so I slowed down\\". Ling then noticed several cars ahead of him seemingly disappear as they drove straight over the edge and slammed his foot on the brakes. He stopped the car inches from the drop. A following car, caught unaware by the unexpected stop, drove into the rear of Ling's car, pushing its front wheels over the breach. He, too, eased himself and his young family out of the car, then stood there horrified as two other cars ignored his attempts to wave them down, raced past, one of which actually swerved around to avoid him, and hurtled over the edge into the river. A loaded bus full of people swerved and skidded slamming into the side railings after being waved down by Ling.http://messui.the- chronicles.org/incident/1975_hobart.pdf  Emergency response  Private citizens living nearby were on the scene early, even before the ship had sunk. Three of these were Jack Read in his H28 yacht Mermerus, David Read in a small launch, and Jerry Chamberlain, who had their boats moored in Montagu Bay close by. These and others, and many shore-based residents, were responsible for saving many of the crewmen from the Lake Illawarra. Those in small craft acted alone in very difficult circumstances with falling cement, live wires, and water from a broken pipe above, until the water police arrived on the scene. A large number of other organisations were involved in the emergency response, including police, ambulance service, fire brigade, Royal Hobart Hospital, Civil Defence, the Hobart Tug Company, Marine Board of Hobart, Public Works Department, Transport Commission, HydroElectric Commission, Hobart Regional Water Board, the Australian Army and the Royal Australian Navy. At 2:30 am, a 14-man Navy Clearance Diving Team flew to Hobart to assist Water Police in the recovery of the vehicles which had driven off the bridge. Two vehicles were identified on 7 January; one was salvaged that day and the second three days later. Another vehicle was found buried under rubble on 8 January. A comprehensive survey of the wreck of the Lake Illawarra was completed by 13 January. The divers operated in hazardous conditions, with little visibility and strong river currents, contending with bridge debris such as shattered concrete, reinforced steel rods, railings, pipes, lights, wire and power cables. Strong winds on the third day brought down debris from the bridge above, including power cables, endangering the divers working below. A total of 12 people died in the disaster: seven crew of the MV Lake Illawarra and five motorists.  A divided city  Geography of Hobart, showing the main part of the city on the west (green), and outer suburbs (blue) = Facilities = The collapse of Tasman Bridge isolated two sides of the city which had heavily relied upon it for most daily activities. 30% of Hobart's residents lived on the eastern shore and were effectively isolated. The day after the incident, as 30,000 residents set out for work, they found that the former three-minute commute over the bridge had turned into a 90-minute trip. Within an hour of the incident, the Sullivans Cove Ferry Company started services across the river, and continued its services throughout the night. Three private ferries and a government vessel were in place the next day. People on the eastern shore quickly became isolated, as most schools, hospitals, businesses and government offices were located on the western shore. Prior to the disaster, many services on the eastern shore were severely lacking. Access to medical services in particular posed problems for residents in the east, as services consisted only of local clinics. Hobart's hospitals—the Royal Hobart Hospital and the Calvary Hospital—were located on the western shore. What was previously a short drive across the river became a trip via the estuary's other bridge in Bridgewater. Most of Hobart's cultural activities, such as theatres, cinemas, the museum and art gallery, restaurants, meeting places, lecture theatres and the botanical gardens, were located on the western shore. = Social effects = The disaster caused a variety of social and psychological difficulties. Although comparatively minor in loss of life and damage, it presented a problem beyond the capacity of the community to resolve. The disaster had unique characteristics and occurred at a time when the effects of disasters on communities were not well understood. \\"Opportunities for the community to be involved in the response to the disaster and the physical restoration of infrastructure were minimal because of the nature of the event. It is likely that this lack of community involvement contributed to the enduring nature of the effects of the disaster on a number of individuals.\\" A study of police data found that in the six months after the disaster, crime rose 41% on the eastern shore, while the rate on the city's western side fell. Car theft rose almost 50% in the isolated community, and neighborhood quarrels and complaints rose 300%. Frustration and anger was directed towards the transport services. Visible progress on restoration of the bridge was slow because of the need for extensive underwater surveys of debris and the time required for design of the rebuilding. \\"The ferry queues did however provide some assistance by providing a forum where people with much in common could vent their frustration.\\" A sociological study described how the physical isolation led to debonding (the setting aside of bonds that constitute the fabric of normal social life). The loss of the Tasman Bridge in Hobart disconnected two parts of the city and had far-reaching effects on the people separated. The disaster was a major contributor to ferry services being the lifeline for people needing to cross the river for daily work. Bob Clifford was the major operator of ferries at the time, and quickly built more of his small aluminium craft, using his company Sullivans Cove Ferry Company. He later went on to become the major Tasmanian shipbuilder with a firm which continues today, called Incat.  Rebuilding  Repairing the bridge = View from the eastern shore showing the rebuilt pylon #18. Pylon #19 was not rebuilt. In March 1975, a Joint Tasman Bridge Restoration Commission was appointed to restore the Tasman Bridge. The Federal Government agreed to fund the project, which began in October that year. The reconstruction included modification of the whole bridge to accommodate an extra traffic lane, allowing for a peak period 'tidal flow' system of three lanes for major flow and two for the minor flow. Approximately one year after the bridge collapse, a temporary two lane Bailey bridge 788 m long, linking the eastern and western shores of the Derwent, was opened. Specialists in marine engineering undertook an extensive investigation to locate bridge debris. This survey took several months to complete, and parts of the bridge weighing up to 500 tons were accurately located using equipment developed by the University of Tasmania and the Public Works Department. Maunsell and Partners were appointed consultants for the rebuilding project. The firm John Holland was awarded the construction contract. Engineers decided not to replace pier 19 as there was too much debris on the site. The Tasman Bridge was re-opened on 8 October 1977, nearly three years after its collapse. The annual expenditures on the Tasman Bridge reconstruction were $1.7 m in 1974–75; $12.3 m in 1975–76; $13.2 m in 1976–77 and $6.1m in 1977–78. The engineering design of the Tasman Bridge provided impact absorbing fendering to the pile caps of the main navigation span capable of withstanding a glancing collision by a large ship, but all other piers were unprotected. This disaster shares some common features with the Skyway Bridge collapse in Florida in 1980, and the I-40 bridge disaster in Oklahoma in 2002, both involving collisions with ships. When river traffic \\"comprises large vessels, even at low speed, the consequences of pier failure can be catastrophic\\". In the field of structural engineering, the concept of ‘pier-redundant’ bridges refers to a bridge superstructure which does not collapse when a single pier is removed. Two ‘pier-redundant’ bridges have been constructed in Australia – over the Murray River at Berri and at Hindmarsh Island in South Australia. The probability of ship impact is now regularly evaluated by specialist consultants when designing major bridges. One solution is to protect bridge piers through strengthening or the construction of impact-resistant barriers. The disaster resulted in changes to the regulations pertaining to shipping movements on the Derwent River. In 1987, a system of sensors measuring river currents, tidal height, and wind speed was installed near the bridge to provide data for ship movements in the area. The Marine and Safety (Pilotage and Navigation) Regulations (2007) contains specific provisions dealing with the Bridge, e.g.: > \\"The master of a vessel approaching the Bridge to navigate it through a span > must (a) have the vessel fully under control; and (b) navigate the vessel > with all possible care at the minimum speed required to pass safely under > the bridge\\". Vessels above a certain size are required to be piloted, and vehicle movements on the bridge are temporarily halted when large vessels are to pass underneath the bridge. As an added precaution, it is now mandatory for most large vessels to have a tug in attendance as they transit the bridge in the event that assistance with steerage may be required. = Development on the eastern shore = 2005 panorama of Hobart illustrating the extent of the city's reliance on the Tasman Bridge The disaster stimulated development in Kingborough, a municipality south of Hobart on the western shore, because of the reduced travel times for western shore workers compared to the eastern shore. The eastern shore eventually became a more self-contained community, with a higher level of employment and improved services and amenities, than had been the case prior to the disaster. The previous imbalance between facilities and employment opportunities was redressed as a result of the disaster. A new bridge crossing the river, the Bowen Bridge, was completed in 1984, a few kilometres north of the Tasman Bridge.  Memorial  A plaque on the side of the eastern bridge support A small service, led by members of the Tasmanian Council of Churches, was held on the occasion of the reopening on Saturday 8 October 1977. A large memorial service was eventually held 25 years after the disaster, in January 2000. In his address to the gathering, the Tasmanian Premier Jim Bacon stated that some people were still struggling with the memories of its effects, and he commended the resilience of the community in coping with the disaster. The Governor at the time, Sir Guy Green, described the pain and loss of loved ones and the social and economic disruption. He paid tribute to the efforts of emergency services personnel in responding to the disaster. He said that the \\"eastern shore had emerged more self-sufficient in the wake of the tragedy\\" and that \\"Tasmanians were now stronger, more self- reliant and mature\\". A plaque commemorating the tragedy was affixed to the main bridge support on the eastern shoreline.  References  Further reading  * Lewis, T.

Weart published by Yale University Press in 1998. It examines political and military conflicts throughout human history and finds no exception to one of the claims that is made by the controversial democratic peace theory that well-established liberal democracies have never made war on one another. In addition to the democratic peace, Weart argues that there is also an oligarchic peace and provides a new explanation for both the democratic and oligarchic peace. The book is often mentioned in the academic debate and has received both praise and criticism.  Sources  The long time period made Weart often reliy on the works of other historians, but he consulted at least five works for even trivial crises involving democracies and oligarchies. Some cases have never been studied with that question in mind, and he then used primary sources, which included reading works in French, German (including Alemannic German), Italian (including the Tuscan dialect), Spanish, Greek, and Latin.  Definitions  The book classifies human societies into four broad groups: :Anocracies are societies in which central authority is weak or nonexistent. Kinship bonds extended by personal allegiances to notable leaders are the principal relations. A society may in theory be a state, but if the above applies, Weart classifies it as an anocracy. Examples include tribes, Somalia, and the medieval Italian cities in which influential families fought street battles and lived in fortified keeps. Importantly, there is no central authority that can effectively restrain personal violence such as raids, which often escalate by involving friends and relatives to vendettas and wars. Some anocratic tribes may have a form of democracy in the extended kinship group but no effective control of personal raids against non-kin groups. Examples include the Iroquois, who frequently raided and eventually destroyed most of the Hurons. :Autocracies are states in which opposition against the current rulers is suppressed. There may be frequent shifts back and forth between anocracy and autocracy if a leader temporarily gains enough power to suppress all opponents in a territory. :Oligarchies are states in which participation in government is restricted to an elite. Voting decides policy, and opposition is accepted within the elite. Voting is usually restricted to less than a third of the males. Examples include Sparta and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. :Democracies are states that are similar to oligarchies, but there is no sharp and clear distinction between an elite and the rest of the domestic population. Usually, more than two thirds of the males have the right to vote. A borderline case is the Athenian democracy, which excluded metics and slaves. Weart argues that it was a democracy since appearance alone did not decide who was a citizen, citizens became slaves and slaves became free, citizens could be poorer than slaves, and slaves could work such as in banking. The metics were even harder to tell from the citizens. Typically, the citizens and noncitizens worked together under similar conditions. Thus, noncitizens were so interwoven through the community that their views were probably represented by the citizens on most issues. Some aspects of the direct democracy that was practiced in Athens may have been more open and democratic than the representative democracy that is used today. In contrast, the Confederate States was an oligarchy. To help differentiate between oligarchies and democracies, Weart requires the classification not to differ from how the people at the time viewed the differences, the oligarchic elite should live in constant fear of a rebellion, and a war should not have been prevented if everyone had the vote in democracies. For example, it was the Greeks who first created the concepts of democracy and oligarchy and who classified Athens as a democracy while Sparta was an oligarchy. There was no mention in the historical record of fears of a revolt by the slaves in Athens, but such fears were frequent in Sparta and the Confederate States. Weart uses a broader definition of war than is usual in his research on the democratic peace theory and includes any conflict causing at least 200 deaths in organized battle by political units against one another. He requires the democracies and the oligarchies to have tolerated dissent for at least three years since he finds that time to be necessary for a political culture in a nation to change and to be reflected in foreign policy.  Results  Using those definitions, Weart finds numerous wars between the same and different kinds of societies but also two exceptions. Democracies have never fought one another, and oligarchies have almost never fought one another. Wars between democracies and oligarchies have, however, been common. The book argues that the pattern is sharply evident, for example in the 300 years of Ancient Greek history, the Swiss cantons since the 14th century, the County of Flanders during the 14th century, the three-and-a-half centuries of the Hanseatic League, and Renaissance Italy. Those periods included numerous societies that frequently changed types of regime. Those societies abruptly stopped fighting other oligarchies if they became oligarchies and abruptly stopped fighting other democracies if they became a democracies. That pattern immediately reversed if the regime type changed again. Weart argues that the only clear case of war between oligarchies is a 1656 battle between Bern and Lucerne, which was caused by religious fervor during the Reformation. The War of the Pacific may be another, but both Chile and Peru had strong anocratic tendencies in which family and personal loyalty formed much of the power base of the leaders. Toleration of political dissent was, at best, limited. Democracies have, a few times, issued formal declarations of war on other democracies, usually because of a war between a temporary allied nondemocracy and the other democracy. In such cases, the democracies have carefully avoided engaging in almost any real battle with one another. There seems to have been almost no deaths during the 369–362 BC war between Thebes and Athens, but at the same time, Sparta and Thebes fought numerous bloody battles. In the main battle in 362 BC, the Athenian infantry avoided joining the charge. Finland and the United Kingdom carefully avoided attacking one another during World War II despite a formal declaration of war.  Explanation  Weart's explanation for the democratic and the oligarchic peace is the human tendency to classify other humans into an ingroup and an outgroup, as has been documented in many psychological studies. Members of the outgroup are seen as inherently inferior and so exploitation of them is justified. Citizens of democracies include citizens of other democratic states in the ingroup. The elites of oligarchies include the elites of other oligarchies in the ingroup. However, the oligarchic elites and the democratic citizens view each other as an outgroup. Democracies viewing the elites as exploiting the rest of the population, and the oligarchic elites viewing democracies as governed by inferior men and are afraid that the democratic ideals may spread to their state. The democratic and oligarchic peace are also strengthened by the culture of arbitration and the respect for the ingroup opposition in both democracies and oligarchies. Similar policies are applied to foreign policy to deal with states belonging to the ingroup. In contrast, the leaders of autocracies are the survivors of a culture of violence against opponents. They use similar methods to deal with other states, which often cause wars. The book presents earlier statistical studies and case studies to show that democracies and oligarchies conduct diplomacy very differently from autocracies. Weart argues against explanations like more trade between democracies since he fjnds the pattern to change too abruptly for that to be the case. Earlier democracies and oligarchies did not include non-Europeans in the ingroup since they perceived them to be racially inferior and to be living in autocracies and anocracies. That allowed colonial and imperialistic wars and exploitation. The book also describes an \\"appeasement trap.\\" The autocratic leaders misunderstand the conciliatory methods used by democracies and oligarchies and see it as an admission of weakness that can be exploited with little risk. When the conciliatory methods are suddenly abandoned and the war arrives, autocratic leaders are often surprised and then conclude that the other side planned the war from the beginning.  Specific conflicts  Most of the book describes specific conflicts that are borderline cases in which critical features might be expected to show up. The following presents some of the conflicts mentioned and Weart's arguments for why they are not wars between well-established liberal democracies. * American Revolutionary War: the United States can be considered a liberal democracy after the Continental Congress but was less than three years old. The monarchy under George III was still the final arbiter of British policy in such matters as the appointment of colonial officials and the power to declare wars. The franchise was restricted to a small minority.Weart, 1998, p. 304–305. * Quasi-War, with less than 200 battle deaths, a few dozen. The franchise in the French Directory was restricted to a minority of wealthy Frenchmen. In 1797, a coup d'état used troops against the opposition, closed down opposing newspapers, canceled election results, and condemned hundreds of opponents to exile or death.Weart, 1998, p. 305–306. * War of 1812: the franchise in the United States was restricted to white men. The British prince regent still retained the final word on ministers and war. Open criticism was punishable as lèse majesté, and dissidents were driven into exile. The franchise was restricted to a small minority.Weart, 1998, p. 135–138, 184–186, 306. * Trail of Tears: the Cherokees had created a republican constitution in 1827 that theorically had many democratic rights. However, it allowed slaveholding and became increasingly authoritarian and eventuslly beat, censored and even murdered those advocating a voluntary removal. The state of Georgia decreed that the government was dissolved in 1828, three years after the creation of the constitution. No battle deaths.Weart, 1998, p. 225–226, 306–07. * Mexican–American War: Mexican President Mariano Paredes was a general who took power in a coup d'état.Weart, 1998, p. 201-204, 207, 214 * Sonderbund War: less than 200 battle deaths. Democracy was less than three years old in Zürich, which was the leading Protestant Canton. The Catholic cantons restricted the suffrage to Catholic men and often also to a group that descended from the original inhabitants. The Protestants and liberals attempted a rebellion in Catholic Lucerne but were defeated. Some fled what they called a Catholic \\"reign of terror.\\" Lucerne announced that Jesuits would be responsible for the educational system. That was perceived as evidence that Lucerne was now a regime under the thumb of the autocratic Pope. A private expedition of volunteers tried to \\"liberate\\" Lucerne but failed. The perceptions of lack of democracy was strengthened when the Catholic cantons refused to comply with the majority of the Swiss Federal Council and turned for aid to foreign Catholic powers, like the Habsburgs.Weart, 1998, p. 26–27, 309–310. * The war between the French Second Republic and the Roman Republic (19th century): both young democracies less than three years old. The Pope had promised to excommunicate those that took part in the elections, leaving only inexperienced radicals in the Roman government during the few months that it existed. The French President and later Emperor Louis Napoleon needed support from the conservative Catholics and the military. The young French assembly was led to believe that the French expedition was a simple police action to restore order in a chaotic regime and to protect Rome from foreign monarchies that planned an intervention. The army officers on the scene distrusted everything republican and, despite the unexpected, resistance launched an attack and conquered Rome without a mandate from the French assembly. The news caused violent uprisings in France. The critics called the military repression \\"the Roman expedition into the interior.\\"Weart, 1998, p. 156–160, 310–311. * The Confederate States of America was less than three years old at the start of the war. Less than two thirds of the adult male population could vote in the Confederacy, which was created to continue the suppression of black slaves. Wealthy planters played on racial fears to avoid criticism from poor whites. Abolitionists were censored and imprisoned even before Abraham Lincoln was elected, and he was not on the ballot in most of the South. In the first elections in the Confederacy, voters in many areas again had no choice of candidates.Weart, 1998, p. 114–119, 311. * War of the Pacific: only one man in fifty could vote in Chile and Peru.Weart, 1998, p. 67. * First Boer War: Britain was not a liberal democracy before Representation of the People Act 1884. The new Boer state was less than three years old, and the black population was excluded from the franchise.Weart, 1998, p. 307–308. * Spanish–American War: all males in Spain could vote, and the constitution theoretically protected many civil liberties. However, there was the turno system of corrupt officials manipulating the elections to return to office as many of their own party as they wished, dissidents were jailed, the monarchy retained important powers, and a military coup d'état was feared if Spain compromised during the negotiations.Weart, 1998, p. 141–42, 204–205, 311. * Fashoda Incident: no battle deaths.Weart, 1998, p. 311. * Philippine–American War: no democratic elections in the Philippines. The Philippine regime was less than three years old. One group of Filipinos had proclaimed a constitution, which explicitly gave the power to a small group of landowners and professionals. Emilio Aguinaldo was declared president without elections and was suspected of killing two of his main political rivals, and nearly all foreign observers saw no chance for genuine self-government but only different regional groups and bandits. US President William McKinley stated that it would be immoral to withdraw and to let the Filipinos either fight one another or be occupied by a European power.Weart, 1998, p. 207–210, 308–309. * Second Boer War: only a minority of white males had the right to vote in the Boer states. White Uitlanders were excluded from the franchise in Transvaal.Weart, 1998, p. 124–128, 308. * World War I: the German Reichstag was elected by all adult males and overwhelmingly voted to fund the war. However, German Kaiser retained most of the power. All appointments to bureaucracy, the armed forces, and the diplomatic forces were made at his sole discretion. It was common knowledge that the army strongly supported him and would arrest his opponents if he desired. Open criticisms could be and were punished as lese majesty. The German chancellor in 1913 ignored a vote of no confidence by explaining that he served at the discretion of the Kaiser alone. The Reichstag was not consulted regarding the declaration of war but only informed after the fact that its support was required to approve the allocation of funds for the defence against Tsarist Russia.Weart, 1998, p. 142–145, 191–195, 311–312. * Anglo-Irish War: Weart's argument is that the Irish state was less than three years old. The initial violence involved rebels acting on their own outside democratic control. Later, democratic control of the Irish Republican Army was doubtful and immediately after the war since part of it tried to overthrow the government during the Irish Civil War.Weart, 1998, p. 312. However, the war had the support of 73 of Ireland's 103 Westminster Members of Parliament.https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/easterrising/profiles/po18.shtml * Occupation of the Ruhr: no battle deaths.Weart, 1998, p. 164–171, 312–313. * Continuation War: eventually, the United Kingdom reluctantly issued a formal declaration of war on Finland because of pressure from Soviet Union. Britain sent bombers to impede mining under German control, but the British were not attacking the Finns. The formal declaration meant nothing but some financial restrictions and the seizure of shipping.Weart, 1998, p. 313. Also, Weart argues that Finland had become so authoritarian during the war that it was not a clear democracy anymore since had imprisoned opposition leaders in a secret prison, and most decisions were taken by a tiny clique of leaders.Weart, 1998, p. 313. * Cod Wars: no battle deaths.Weart, 1998, p. 315. * Turkish Invasion of Cyprus: initial hostilities occurred after a coup d'état in Cyprus. Both the later formally-democratic regime in Cyprus and that in Turkey were less than three years old. The military retained significant influence in both.Weart, 1998, p. 314–315. * Paquisha Incident: both young democracies less than three years old and lacked democratic control over the military. About 200 battle deaths occurred.Weart, 1998, p. 70, 316.  Crusade for democracy  Weart finds that nations have often tried to spread their political system to other nations. He finds many failed attempts to impose democracy by military intervention. For example, during the early part of the 20th century the United States sent soldiers to many nations in Central America to hold free elections but with little long-term success. The attempts that succeeded, like occupied Japan after World War II, involved drastic change of the whole political culture. Weart argues that it is generally better to spread democracy by diplomacy and by slowly promoting internal political change. Criticisms Reviews of the book have ranged from positiveNever at war: why democracies will not fight one another.

That would be very difficult to do if all of human history were included. The many statistical studies on that subject have almost always limited themselves to the period after 1815. There are prefabricated data sets available, which list for example all battle deaths for all nations. Weart instead uses a well-used method often used by historians: comparative case studies. Especially by looking at many ambiguous cases, it is possible to sift out a set of features that decide if a pair of regimes makes war or avoids it. =Critiques of methodology= Some find Weart's use of sources questionable, particularly regarding the conflicts in antiquity. He excludes the earlier wars of Rome, including the Punic Wars, bu stating that there are no primary sources and no reliable secondary sources, such as by a historian who could understand Punic, from Carthage, which makes it impossible to determine the exact form of government at the start of these wars. However, he uses Xenophon for other conflicts, who has also been doubted as a reliable source although not for the same reason. Also, many modern classicists agree that Rome and Carthage were oligarchic republics, \\"which suggests that excluding them was a largely arbitrary judgment that just happened to leave Weart's central claim intact.\\"Foreign Affairs - Never Say Never: Wishful Thinking on Democracy and War - Stephen M. Walt However, Weart states that there have been some wars between oligarchies and so they would add to his list, not disprove his statement. The Sicilian Expedition is sometimes mentioned as a war between somewhat-democratic states. Some democratic peace researchers have excluded the states in Ancient Greece because of the limited franchise and the use of allotment to select many government leaders. As noted earlier, Weart classifies Athens as a democracy and argues that the war was actually an example of a war between a democracy and an oligarchy. However, he also states, \\"The possibility that the Athenians were wrong suggests a qualification to our rule. Instead of saying that well-established democracies do not make war on their own kind, perhaps we should say that they do not make war on other states they perceive to be democracies.\\" Critics argue that there is no ancient evidence for this perception and that the major source on Syracuse democracy is Thucydides, an Athenian.(Response to Spencer Weart, Eric Robinson, Journal of Peace Research, Vol. 38, No. 5., Sep. 2001, p. 615-617) Weart states Aristotle, an Athenian metic, the only scholar who ever possessed the documents required to study the constitution of Syracuse, carefully avoided calling Syracuse a democracy. One of the main reasons for the Sicilian Expedition was that Syracuse was reported to have violent factional strife. Help from an inside group was essential since the Greeks lacked effective siege machinery, and the expedition was ill-suited for the alternative, a long wait to starve the defenders. In every other known case of cities being betrayed to an Athenian army, it was by a democratic faction. Furthermore, scholars have argued that Thucydides disliked democracy, which affected his descriptions and evaluations. Weart's argument on the Sicilian Expedition is similar to the position of the prominent scholar G.E.M. de Ste. Croix. The same review also includes a list of possible wars between Greek oligarchies, including the recurrent wars between Sparta and Argos. Weart mentions the wars in a footnote with references in which he states that Argos was a democracy. =Alternate explanations for democratic peace= JM Owen, in a generally- friendly review, questions Weart's conclusion that universal democracy will mean lasting peace. If Weart's explanation for the democratic peace is true and also depends on perception, democratic leaders may misperceive each other as authoritarian. More seriously, if the outgroup of oligarchs disappears, what will prevent the democracies from dividing into a new ingroup and outgroup?(John M Owen IV, Never at War (review), Political Science Quarterly, Volume 114, Number 2, 1 July 1999, p. 335-336) (Weart later suggested that there would be a tendency to promote an internal outgroup such as criminals, perverts, or terrorists.) There are many other proposed explanations for the democratic peace. For example, a game-theoretic explanation for the democratic peace is that the public and the open debate in democracies send clear and reliable information regarding the intentions to other states. In contrast, it is difficult to know the intentions of nondemocratic leaders, what effect concessions will have and if promises will be kept. Thus, there will be mistrust and unwillingness to make concessions if at least one of the parties in a dispute is not a democracy.https://mitpress.mit.edu/journals/pdf/jeea_2_1_1_0.pdf  See also  *List of wars between democracies ReferencesExternal links *The first chapter from the book Category:1998 non-fiction books Category:20th- century history books Category:History books about politics Category:History books about wars Category:Non-fiction books about diplomacy Category:Books about military history Category:Political books Category:Yale University Press books Category:Causes of war ","title":"Never at War"},{"id":"2765935","text":"Façade of the Lycée Janson de Sailly Lycée Janson de Sailly is a lycée located in the 16th arrondissement of Paris, France. The lycéens of Janson are called les jansoniens and they usually refer to their high school as Janson, or JdS. It is the biggest academic institution in the region: 3,200 boys and girls from 11 to 20 attend classes ranging from junior high school to Classes Préparatoires. History Monsieur Janson de Sailly was a wealthy Parisian lawyer, who found out that his wife had a lover. Therefore, he decided to disinherit her and to bequeath all of his fortune to the State, under the condition that it be used to establish a modern high school that would offer an excellent education and in which no women would be allowed. The lycée was built in the 1880s. Victor Hugo who lived nearby made a speech for the inauguration. A decade later it was opened to girls as well. The lycée Janson de Sailly was the first Republican lycée of France (the others started as royal or imperial establishments); it aimed at training the future French scientific, literary, military, industrial, diplomatic and political male élites of the young Third Republic. It gained a national reputation, and attracted students from around the country. It also became one of the lycées of Parisian high society. The motto of the lycée was Pour la Patrie, par le livre et par l'épée (For the Homeland, by the book and by the sword). Many alumni joined the military, and participated in the conquest of the French Colonial Empire, especially in Africa. In 1944, a few hundred Jansonians managed to leave the lycée and joined the French Free Forces (the 1st Army of Jean de Lattre de Tassigny): they founded le 2ème Bataillon de Choc, also known as Bataillon Janson-de-Sailly. They faced the German divisions in Alsace (especially in the battles of Masevaux and Colmar) during the counter-attack of Ardennes, and entered Germany with General Patton's forces in 1945. Commemorative plaques near the entrances of several classrooms and halls in the school buildings honor the memories of its alumni - including the war hero Roland Garros. Teaching Nowadays, the 3,200 students are equally divided into the three traditional formations of the French Education System : collège (30 classes with collégiens from 11 to 14), lycée (30 classes with lycéens from 14 to 18) and Classes Préparatoires aux Grandes écoles or prépas (30 classes with students from 18 to 20). In France, students must study two foreign or regional languages. The first choice at Janson is English or German. The second choice is larger: English, German, Spanish, Italian, Chinese or Russian. In classes préparatoires, there is even more choice with German, English, Arabic, Spanish, Italian, Russian as first language and all the aforementioned languages plus Japanese and Chinese as a second language. A student in Classes préparatoires can also take another second language not amongst those above. But those languages are available only through a partnership (the \\"Langues Inter-établissement\\") with other lycées with a wilder range of languages. The student would then study at Janson but go to another lycée to attend its foreign language class. For instance, the lycée Montaigne provides Portuguese and Polish and the lycée Buffon offers Hebrew and Swedish. The Lycée offers an ABIBAC section, with German history classes taught by a native speaker. The students taking part in the section will take the Abitur and the Baccalauréat exams at the end of 12th grade. Ranking Due to its geographical location, and to the number of its important alumni, Janson de Sailly has a high reputation. Its scholastic ranking puts it at or above the median for area schools.France Examen \\"Analyse des résultats En 2015, les candidats du lycée Janson De Sailly qui se sont présentés au bac ES (série économique et sociale) ont été 98,6 % à décrocher leur diplôme et 59,7 % à se voir décerner une mention.

This painting is in the Pilgrim Hall Museum, Plymouth, Massachusetts. Elizabeth Tilley (December 21, 1689) was one of the passengers on the historic 1620 voyage of the Mayflower and a participant in the first Thanksgiving in the New World. She was the daughter of Mayflower passenger John Tilley and his wife Joan Hurst and, although she was their youngest child, appears to be the only one who survived the voyage. She went on to marry fellow Mayflower passenger John Howland, with whom she had ten children and 88 grandchildren. Because of their great progeny, she and her husband have millions of living descendants today. Early life  Elizabeth Tilley was born in Henlow, Bedfordshire, England where she was baptized in August, 1607. According to parish records, she was the youngest of five children born to her parents. She also had an older step- sister, Joan, from her mother's first marriage to Thomas Rogers (no relation to the Mayflower passenger of the same name). It is likely that when she was a small girl, she moved with her parents to the Netherlands, where her parents and her uncle Edward Tilley are documented as members of the Leiden Separatist congregation. Edward's ward, Henry Samson, may also have been a member.  On the Mayflower and in the New World  Signing the Mayflower Compact 1620, a painting by Jean Leon Gerome Ferris 1899 William Bradford, in his memoirs, listed the Tilley family on the Mayflower as: \\"John Tillie, and his wife; and Elizabeth, their daughter.\\"Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691, (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), p. 406 Elizabeth would have been about 13 years old during the journey. \\"The Landing of the Pilgrims\\" (1877) by Henry A. Bacon. This painting is in the Pilgrim Hall Museum, Plymouth, Massachusetts. The Mayflower departed Plymouth, England on September 6/16, 1620. The small, 100-foot ship had 102 passengers and a crew of about 30-40 in extremely cramped conditions. By the second month out, the ship was being buffeted by strong westerly gales, causing the ship's timbers to be badly shaken with caulking failing to keep out sea water, and with passengers, even in their berths, lying wet and ill. This, combined with a lack of proper rations and unsanitary conditions for several months, attributed to what would be fatal for many, especially the majority of women and children. On the way there were two deaths, a crew member and a passenger.Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691, (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), p. 413 On November 9/19, 1620, after about 3 months at sea, including a month of delays in England, they spotted land, which was the Cape Cod Hook, now called Provincetown Harbor. After several days of trying to get south to their planned destination of the Colony of Virginia, strong winter seas forced them to return to the harbor at Cape Cod hook, where they anchored on November 11/21. The Mayflower Compact was signed that day.

This statue by Henry Hudson Kitson is not of a particular Pilgrim, but the subject represented most closely fits Elizabeth Tilley and Mary Chilton in age. Elizabeth's parents both died the first winter, as did her uncle, Edward Tilley, and aunt, Ann. This left Elizabeth an orphan and so she was taken in by the Carver family. The elder Carvers died about a year later, and part of their estate was inherited by their servant, John Howland, and Elizabeth became his ward.Caleb H.

She and John would go on to have ten children, all of whom would live to adulthood, and 88 grandchildren. Elizabeth outlived her husband by fifteen years, being one of the few original Pilgrims to live to see King Philip's War. =Children of John and Elizabeth Howland= #Desire was born about 1624 and died in Barnstable October 13, 1683.

Zinn wrote the play using Goldman's autobiography, correspondence between Goldman and fellow anarchist Alexander Berkman (Emma's lover, who also became a character in the play), and other research. As Zinn describes her in his introduction, \\"She seemed to be tireless as she traveled the country, lecturing to large audiences everywhere, on birth control ('A woman should decide for herself'), on the problems of marriage as an institution ('Marriage has nothing to do with love'), on patriotism ('the last refuge of a scoundrel'), on free love ('What is love if not free?'), and also on the drama — Shaw, Ibsen, Strindberg.\\"Howard Zinn, Emma, 2002 ed., pp. xvi, xix, South End Press, 138 pp. According to author Tom H. Hastings, the play shows the period of Goldman's \\"nonviolence and resistance to militarism\\", rather than her earlier \\"attachment to violent revolution\\". After someone accuses her of plotting to \\"blow up the fleet\\" in San Francisco harbor, she declares \\"Bombs are not my way\\", but she \\"would be happy to see the fleet sink to the bottom of the sea ... so that we, and our brothers and sisters in other countries, can live in peace.\\"  Plot summary  The action of the play takes place during the late 1880s, and focuses on the character of Emma Goldman as she grows from a simple textile factory worker to a revolutionary and anarchist. The outspoken advocacy of radical anarchist and populist ideals are followed through persecution and hardship to the beginnings of World War I. The play closes with the words of Goldman during an anti-conscription protest in 1917, just before her arrest on sedition charges.

He was the second son of 'Adud al-Dawla. The Abbasids recognized his succession and conferred upon him the title Samsam al-Dawla. He lacked the qualities of his father 'Adud al-Dawla and failed to have a grip upon his state affairs. His rule was marked by revolts and civil wars. BiographyEarly life and rise= The Buyid amirates in ca. 970 Abu Kalijar Marzuban was born in 963, he was the son of Adud al-Dawla and Sayyida ibn Siyahgil, a daughter of Siyahgil, a Gilite ruler. Thus making Abu Kalijar Marzuban distantly related to Ziyarid dynasty, who were descended from a sister of the Gilite ruler Harusindan, who was the father of Siyahgil. During 'Adud al- Dawla's lifetime, Abu Kalijar Marzuban was assigned the governorships of Buyid Oman and Khuzestan. Despite Marzuban's status as second son (Shirdil being the eldest), he was considered to be his father's heir. This issue was never completely clarified by 'Adud al-Dawla before his death, resulting in a succession crisis. Marzuban, who was in Baghdad when his father died, at first kept his death secret in order to ensure his succession. When he made the death of his father public, he took the title \\"Samsam al-Dawla\\". Shirdil also laid his claims to the succession, and from his province of Kerman invaded and captured Fars. He took the title \\"Sharaf al-Dawla\\". Sharaf al-Dawla's invasion of Fars provided two more of Samsam al-Dawla's brothers, Taj al-Dawla and Diya' al-Dawla, to set up their own rule in Basra and Khuzestan. In Diyar Bakr, a Kurd named Badh ibn Hasanwaih took power and forced Samsam al-Dawla to confirm him as its ruler. To the north, Samsam al-Dawla's uncle Fakhr al-Dawla ruled an extensive territory from Ray. The rulers of Basra and Khuzestan soon acknowledged Fakhr al-Dawla as senior amir, making the latter the most powerful of the Buyids and moving the senior amirate from Iraq to Jibal. =Early reign= Map of Iraq in the 9th–10th centuries Despite Fakhr al- Dawla's power, it was Sharaf al-Dawla who posed the largest threat to Samsam al-Dawla. He recovered Buyid Oman, which had earlier seceded to Samsam al- Dawla. In 983, the Turkic soldiers of Iraq betrayed Samsam al-Dawla, and went towards to the court of Sharaf al-Dawla. However, his relative from his mother's side Ziyar ibn Shahrakawayh managed to make most of them change their mind and stay loyal to Samsam al-Dawla. In 985, a Dailamite chief Saffar ibn Quddawiyah revolted against the authority of Samsam he joined with (Shirdil. Saffar lead a force against Samsam to Baghdad. Samsam sent a stronger force in retaliation consequently Saffar was defeated. In early 986 Samsam captured Basra and Khuzestan, forcing the two brothers to flee to Fakhr al-Dawla's territory. During the same period, another Dailamite named Asfar ibn Kurdawayh rebelled against Samsam al-Dawla, and changed his allegiance to Sharaf al- Dawla. However, Asfar quickly changed his mind, and declared allegiance to the latter's other brother Abu Nasr Firuz Kharshadh, who was shortly given the honorific epithet of \\"Baha' al-Dawla.\\" However, Samsam al-Dawla, with the aid of Fuladh ibn Manadhar, suppressed the rebellion, imprisoned Baha al-Dawla, and executed his supporters executed, including Bahram ibn Ardashir al-Majusi. Samsam al-Dawla then made peace with Sharaf al-Dawla, and agreed to release Baha al-Dawla. However, Sharaf betrayed Samsam, and quickly marched against him. Sharaf occupied Ahwaz, then sent his forces to Wasit which fell to him in 986 AD. From there Samsam marched to Baghdad. Before any confrontation could take place, there was a revolt in the army of Samsam. He was therefore defeated and forced to surrender. There upon Baghdad fell to Sharaf and Samsam was put in prison.The Buwayhid dynasty of Baghdad by M.Kabir =Regaining his lost position= Map of Fars and its surrounding regions in the 9th–10th centuries Sharaf al-Dawla's death in 988 or 989 provided Samsam al-Dawla with the opportunity to make a return to power. Despite having been partially blinded shortly before Sharaf al-Dawla's death, he managed to escape from prison and with the aid of Sharaf al-Dawla's former vizier Ala ibn Hasan, wrested control of Fars, Kerman and Khuzestan from his brother Baha' al-Dawla, who had succeeded Sharaf al-Dawla. Both Baha' al-Dawla and his brother found their positions threatened by Fakhr al-Dawla. The latter invaded Khuzestan in an attempt to split the two brothers' territories. This act prompted the both of them to draw up an alliance. Samsam al-Dawla recognized Baha' al-Dawla as the ruler of Iraq and Khuzestan, while he himself kept Arrajan, Fars and Kerman. Both promised to consider each other as equals, and took the title of \\"king\\". In 991 Baha' al-Dawla attempted to get rid of Samsam al-Dawla. He took the title of Shâhanshâh and invaded the latter's territory. His forces were defeated, however, and Samsam al-Dawla regained Khuzestan. He even gained control of the Buyid territories in Oman. In order to further strengthen his position, Samsam al-Dawla decided to recognise Fakhr al-Dawla as senior amir, submitting to his authority. =Losing power= Fakhr al-Dawla's death in 997, coupled with Samsam al-Dawla's increasing troubles within his realm, made Baha' al-Dawla the strongest of the Buyid princes. He gained the support of the Kurdish ruler Badr ibn Hasanwaih and prepared for the expedition. The invasion began in December of 998. Scarcely had the campaign begun, however, when Samsam al-Dawla was murdered by one of the sons of 'Izz al-Dawla near Isfahan while fleeing from Shiraz. Baha' al-Dawla took Shiraz, defeated 'Izz al-Dawla's sons, and reunited Iraq, Fars and Kerman.

He was raised in Yorkshire, graduated in medicine from Leeds School of Medicine in 1992 and worked in general medicine before commencing a career in journal editing in 1997, beginning with the BMJ, followed by the Bulletin of the World Health Organization and later the JRSM. He is a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh and the Royal College of Physicians of London. Abbasi has been a consultant editor for PLOS Medicine and has created e-learning resources for professional development of doctors, including BMJ Learning and the Royal Society of Medicine's video lecture service. He has authored books on cricket; Zindabad; The English Chronicles: a Modern History of Pakistan Cricket, published in 2012 and Englistan: An immigrant’s journey on the turbulent winds of Pakistan cricket in 2020. During the COVID-19 pandemic, he has written on the UK's response to COVID-19, including the provision of personal protective equipment for frontline staff.  Early life and education  Leeds School of Medicine Kamran Abbasi was born in Lahore, Pakistan and moved to Rotherham, Yorkshire in 1974. He completed his early education at Oakwood School before attending the Thomas Rotherham College, both in Rotherham, South Yorkshire. In 1992, he graduated in medicine from Leeds School of Medicine.  Career  In 1997, following five years in internal medicine in both Yorkshire and London, he joined the BMJ from the Royal London and St Bartholomew's Hospitals. He took up the post of editorial registrar and then assistant editor, before becoming deputy editor in 2002 and acting editor in 2004. He was influenced by editor Richard Smith. =Global health and politics= In 1999, he published a series of six articles in the BMJ looking at the role of the World Bank in global health. A year later, he was appointed editor of the Bulletin of the World Health Organization. Abbasi became the BMJ's executive editor for content, developing the journal's expansion internationally, digitally, and in print, particularly the BMJ International editions, which he considers his greatest achievement. The first of the themed issues was in 2003, and shortly after, he was one of the three main organisers of the BMJ’s first international theme issue on South Asia, where investment in primary care and particularly the education of girls in Sri Lanka and Kerala was shown to be beneficial. Their interest and continued work in South Asia has led to the BMJ offering a dedicated page to South Asia on their website since 2013. In October 2004, while he was acting editor of the BMJ, Abbasi became the recipient of an unusually large number of responses to a BMJ article written by Derek Summerfield, who published his personal view over what he saw as organised violations of the fourth Geneva Convention by the Israeli army in Gaza and their effects on public health. The reaction to that article was later analysed by Karl Sabbagh and revealed the hostility that editors can receive when publishing on a sensitive issue. In response to the messages sent to the journal's website and the over 1000 emails sent directly to Abbasi, a sample number were published on-line within 24 hours of submission. Sabbagh explained that the published messages \\"were a skewed sample of what had been received, as abusive and obscene contributions were not posted\\", In response to these messages, many of which \\"abused the BMJ or Abbasi personally\\", Abbasi published an editorial entitled: “Should journals mix medicine and politics?” Abbasi noted that the messages were \\"largely biased and inflammatory on both sides\\" and that a number of people felt that dialogue could resolve the conflict. He specified that “in a state of conflict [those] views will be sometime abrasive and unpalatable\\" and argued that medicine cannot exist in a political void. In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, he published his commentary on the \\"scandals of COVID-19\\", which included the topics of personal protective equipment for frontline NHS staff, the UK's preparedness for the pandemic, and the fear of going into hospital. In May 2020, he co-authored a paper titled \\"The UK’s public health response to covid-19\\". Together with Bobbie Jacobson from the Johns Hopkins University and Gabriel Scally, they described the UK's response to the COVID-19 pandemic as \\"too little, too late, too flawed\\", with no adequate plan for community-based case-finding, testing, and contact tracing. Their findings were published in the New Statesman, and discussed in Medscape, the British Journal of Social Psychology and the Practice Nurse. =Other journals= Abbasi has been editor of the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine since 2005. He also founded BMJ Learning, an e-learning resource.  Other roles He has been appointed visiting professor at the Department of Primary Care and Public Health, Imperial College, London, member of the General Advisory Council of the King's Fund, a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh and the Royal College of Physicians of London, and patron of the South Asian Health Foundation. He is a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh and the Royal College of Physicians of London. He has been a consultant editor for PLOS Medicine and has created three e-learning resources for professional development of doctors, including BMJ Learning and the Royal Society of Medicine's video lecture service. He has consulted for a number of organisations including Harvard University, the NHS, the World Health Organization and McKinsey & Co. He has also made contributions on radio and television, particularly with Mark Porter. In this role, Abbasi has acted as a sceptic to BBC Radio 4's weekly medical programme, Inside Health. He also writes for Dawn, a Pakistani English-language newspaper. Cricket Following cricket since the 1970s, Abbasi has been an international writer on Pakistan cricket since 1996, starting as a blogger for Cricinfo.com with a blog called Pak Spin, and with a particular interest in the politics of cricket. He was the first Asian columnist in an English cricket publication when he started writing for Wisden Cricket Monthly.

On Aug. 26, 1966, the largest crowd in the history of Batavia Downs — 15,118 — turned out for what was billed as The Pace of the Century. The race was won by Cardigan Bay. In the so-called \\"Revenge Pace\\" also set up by Yonkers, driver Frank Ervin's Bret Hanover beat Dancer and Cardigan Bay in a track record 1:58 3/5. Cardigan Bay was one of only two horses to have ever beaten Bret Hanover but it wasn't close that evening as Bret Hanover won the $25,000 race by three lengths en route to being named Horse of the Year for the third straight time. Dancer and the then 12-year-old Cardigan Bay returned to Batavia Downs in the summer of 1968. The Downs put up a $25,000 purse, and fans were expecting to watch history made with a victory by Cardigan Bay to top the $1 million mark. But Hervé Filion drove Good Time Boy to an upset victory as Cardigan Bay faded to fourth. The pacer topped the $1 million barrier one month later at Freehold in New Jersey and was retired.

Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. Version 16 November 2012. Wheat Genus Aegilops has played an important role in the taxonomy of wheat. The familiar common wheat (Triticum aestivum) arose when cultivated emmer wheat hybridized with Aegilops tauschii about 8,000 years ago.Jia, J., et al. (2013). Aegilops tauschii draft genome sequence reveals a gene repertoire for wheat adaptation. Nature 496, 91–95.Petersen, G., et al. (2006). Phylogenetic relationships of Triticum and Aegilops and evidence for the origin of the A, B, and D genomes of common wheat (Triticum aestivum). Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution 39(1), 70-82. Aegilops and Triticum are genetically similar, as evidenced by their ability to hybridize, and by the presence of Aegilops in the evolutionary heritage of many Triticum taxa. Aegilops is sometimes treated within Triticum. They are maintained as separate genera by most authorities because of their ecological characteristics, and because when united they do not form a monophyletic group.Yamane, K. and T. Kawahara. (2005). Intra- and interspecific phylogenetic relationships among diploid Triticum-Aegilops species (Poaceae) based on base-pair substitutions, indels, and microsatellites in chloroplast noncoding sequences. American Journal of Botany 92(11), 1887-98. Ecology Some Aegilops are known as weeds. A. cylindrica, which is commonly known as jointed goatgrass, infests wheat fields, where it outcompetes wheat plants, reducing yields. Its seeds mix with wheat grains at harvest, lowering the quality of the crop. It can also harbor pests such as the Russian wheat aphid (Diuraphis noxia) and pathogenic fungi. Other Aegilops are weeds of rangeland and wildland habitat.Aegilops. Encycloweedia Data Sheets. California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA). Prehistoric use as a wild food source During the Mesolithic era, nomadic peoples found goatgrasses (Aegilops) growing wild, along with wild wheats and barleys, and harvested them using bone sickles inset with sharp flakes of flint. The harvested plants were left to dry for a few days, then the edible grains were separated out from the rest of the plant material by beating the plants with a wooden flail, or by rolling them against a hard surface. The seeds were then carefully singed in the embers of a fire to burn away the remaining non-edible plant material. Some grains were accidentally burnt, and since the burnt grains do not biodegrade some have been found by modern archeologists.Thomson, Peter (2010). Seeds, sex, and civilization: How the hidden life of plants has shaped our world. Thames and Hudson. 12,13. Etymology The genus name Aegilops comes from the Greek ', which could mean \\"a goat\\", \\"goatlike\\", \\"a herb liked by goats\\", or perhaps \\"a grass similar to that liked by goats\\". The word \\"Aegilops\\" is claimed to be the longest word in the English language to have all of its letters in alphabetical order. Species Aegilops tauschii ; Accepted speciesAegilops.

The company was based in New York City, with production facilities in Fort Lee, New Jersey. In 1912, IMP merged with several other production companies to form Universal Film Manufacturing Company, later re-named Universal Pictures Company with Laemmle as president. History Advertisement for On the Shore (1912) The Independent Moving Pictures Company was founded in 1909 by Carl Laemmle, and was located at 573 11th Ave New York City, and with a studio in Fort Lee, New Jersey. The first movie produced by IMP was Hiawatha (1909) starring Gladys Hulette, a one-reel drama short based on the 1855 poem The Song of Hiawatha by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.Hiawatha at the Internet Movie Database. At a time when leading screen players worked anonymously, IMP performers Florence Lawrence, formerly known as \\"The Biograph Girl,\\" and King Baggot became the first \\"movie stars\\" to be given billing and screen credits, a marquee as well as promotion in advertising, which contributed to the creation of the star system. In the early 20th century, the Motion Picture Patents Company, or the Trust, was fought by the unlicensed independent films (dubbed \\"pirates\\" or \\"outlaws\\"), led by Laemmle. Others against the MPPC included Harry E. Aitken (Majestic Films), William Fox (founder of the Fox Film Corporation), and Adolph Zukor (Famous Players Film Company, a precursor to Paramount). The flexible, stealthy and adventurous independents avoided coercive MPPC restrictions (the requirement to use only Trust film stock and projectors, for example) by using unlicensed equipment, obtaining their own film materials, and making movies on the sly. After many of the independents, including IMP, organized their distribution subsidiaries into the Motion Picture Distributing and Sales Company in mid-1910, with Laemmle as their president, the Trust issued an injunction against Laemmle for the camera being used, claiming that it was an infringement on their patents,New York Times, Dec. 1, 1912, \\"How Carl Laemmle Succeeded In Breaking The Moving Picture Trust,\\" p. SM 14. but eventually lost. Before long, the independents began moving to Southern California, and opened up a West Coast movie-making industry. In 1910, IMP began production in Los Angeles, and had a studio in Hollywood at Sunset Boulevard and Gower Street, which became known as \\"Gower Gulch\\" due to the actors dressed as cowboys and Indians waiting on that corner to be cast in Westerns. By May, 1912, the Motion Picture Distributing and Sales Company began to collapse, its supporting production companies removing their distribution needs to other companies or under their own direction. On June 10, 1912, the assets of Independent Moving Pictures were transferred to the newly incorporated Universal Film Manufacturing Company, which undertook to distribute for several of the departing Sales Company producers in continued opposition to the Edison trust. IMP was corporately dissolved but its name continued to be used as a brand name for Laemmle's productions.

Martha Graham Center of Contemporary Dance is located in New York City and is the headquarters to the Martha Graham School of Contemporary Dance and the Martha Graham Dance Company, which is the oldest continually performing dance company in the world. The School is focused on teaching Graham's technique; some of its faculty were trained by Graham herself. The center was founded in 1926 by Martha Graham. Its first headquarters consisted of a small dance studio on Broadway. The center later moved to a two-story building at 316 East 63rd Street, New York. After Martha Graham's death in 1991, the center's leadership was debated. In her will, Martha Graham left Ron Protas as heir to her estate. Protas claimed ownership of the rights to Graham's name and choreographic oeuvre, and sued the Martha Graham Dance Company for trademark infringement. After years of legal battles, the Martha Graham Dance Company was ruled the owner of the Graham name and almost all of her repertoire. During the dispute, Protas was voted out of his position as artistic director of the company. In 2005, the center was among 406 New York City arts and social service institutions to receive part of a $20 million grant from the Carnegie Corporation, which was made possible through a donation that was given by the New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg.

History Perth's first electrified trains, the two-carriage A-Series, entered service in September 1991. The new three-carriage B-series were introduced on 4 October 2004 as part of the New MetroRail project. Thirty-one B-series sets were purchased to operate on the new Joondalup and Mandurah lines. They are mainly based at Nowergup depot but are occasionally stored at Claisebrook Depot. The B-series trains are cleared to operate on the Midland, Armadale/Thornlie and Fremantle lines and are regularly used on these lines alongside the older A-Series. However, not all stations on these lines are capable of handling six-car sets as the platforms are not long enough, so they are usually run as 3-car sets. There are reported problems with the acceleration/deceleration systems with the closely spaced stations. Platforms at the original stations on the Joondalup line had to be lengthened to accommodate the six-car trains, as did Platform 1 at Showgrounds and both platforms at West Leederville. The Mandurah line stations, along with Butler, Clarkson, Currambine and Greenwood on the Joondalup line, and the rebuilt Kelmscott station on the Armadale line were built with longer platforms. Additional sets In 2006, the Public Transport Authority ordered a second batch of 15 three-carriage B-series trains from Bombardier/EDI Rail to increase capacity on the Joondalup and Mandurah lines. The first entered service on 28 June 2009. These sets feature an upgraded communication system and brighter destination screens than the original B-series sets. Funding for a third batch of 15 sets was announced by the Government of Western Australia in the 2011/12 State Budget. The order was increased by two sets in August 2012 to service the planned Aubin Grove station, followed by a further five sets in November 2012.More new railcars for Perth Railway Express 14 November 2012Perth grapples with growth and funding challenges International Railway Journal 6 November 2013\\"Rolling Stock contracts and deliveries\\" Railway Digest December 2014 p. 47 Funding for an additional 10 sets was announced in the May 2016 state budget with delivery planned for 2018-20 these sets will provide additional capacity on the existing network as well as service the Forrestfield–Airport Link when it opens in 2021. The B series fleet will total 78 3-carriage sets. As of April 2019 all 78 3-car sets have been delivered with 78 3-car sets in serviceMore EMUs for Perth Railway Gazette International 23 June 2016 AccidentsAccident at Nowergup Depot= On 23 August 2006 at approximately 18:00, two B-series trains (sets BEA 053 and BEB 060) were involved in a head-on collision at Nowergup depot. Cars from both sets were damaged badly enough to be sent back to builders EDI's facility in Maryborough for repair. During these repairs, undamaged cars from both sets were re-formed into set 60, which then returned to service. The damaged cars were fixed and returned to service (as set 60) in time for the opening of the Mandurah line in December 2007. Additional accessories  Since early-2016, B-series sets 115 and onwards have been fitted with USB charging ports as part of a 6-month trial.https://thewest.com.au/news/australia/transperth-gives-power-to- commuters-ng-ya-137234 They are located below the emergency door release and aside from the intercarriage gangways.

Another name is also Tanjong Berlayer. It is the name given to the craggy granite outcrop that formerly stood in the gateway of Keppel Harbour in Singapore. The rocky outcrop served as navigational aids to ancient mariners sailing through the swift waters of the narrow channel between them, but was subsequently destroyed by the British in 1848 to widen the channel for larger vessels to sail through. In 2005, a symbolic replica was erected by the Singapore government near its original site to mark the role in the history.

She lives in Ashland, Oregon, with her husband, fellow spiritual teacher Eli Jaxon-Bear. Early life Gangaji was born Merle Antoinette Roberson (Toni) in Texas on June 11, 1942, and grew up in Mississippi. After graduating from the University of Mississippi she and her young family moved to San Francisco. After a divorce“The End of All Excuses” by Gangaji. she sought to change her life via political activism and spiritual practice. She took Buddhist Bodhisattva vows, practiced Zen and Vipassana meditation, helped in a Tibetan-Buddhist-style meditation center, and began a career as an acupuncturist in the San Francisco Bay area. Unfulfilled by her seemingly successful life, in 1989 she and Eli Jaxon-Bear moved to Hawaii.Gangaji; Roslyn Moore. Just Like You, An Autobiography, Do Publishing 2003 Papaji At this time she met Andrew Cohen, a spiritual teacher and student of Sri H.W.L. Poonja, also known as Papaji. Impressed by Cohen’s \\"enormous confidence\\", she returned to California to sit with him for two months.Hammond, Holly. \\"A Conversation with Gangaji\\", Yoga Journal, May-Jun 1994, p.41. In the meantime, Eli, who had become her second husband, met Papaji in India. Struck by the letters she received from Eli, Gangaji herself traveled to Lucknow, India to meet Papaji in 1990. In her autobiography Just Like You she wrote, \\"The extraordinary event in this life was that I met Papaji. Until then I looked everywhere for the transcendental or the extraordinary, but after meeting Papaji I began to find the extraordinary in every moment.\\"Roslyn Moore, p.137 Papaji gave her the name Gangaji, and asked her to share what she had directly realized with others.

For example, she says, \\"Fear is about survival. When you drop under that and experience the fear without trying to change it, just letting it be, then it becomes still. When you open your heart to fear, rather than trying to fight it or deny it or even overcome it, then you find it is just energy.\\" Shapiro, Ed and Deb (2009), p.94 Gangaji Foundation Since 1993 Gangaji’s work has been supported by The Gangaji Foundation, a non-profit headquartered in Ashland, Oregon. Its mission statement states: \\"The Gangaji Foundation serves the truth of universal consciousness, and the potential for the individual and collective recognition of peace inherent in the core of all being.

Personal life In October 2005, Gangaji's husband, Eli Jaxon-Bear, admitted to Gangaji that he had had a three-year affair with an adult female student and executive director of his organization, the Leela Foundation. After a brief separation, Gangaji and her husband reconciled their marriage in December 2005.

Policies  The economists Ludwig Bamberger and Georg von Siemens as well as the liberal politician Eugen Richter were among the prime movers of the fusion in the view of the coming accession of considered liberal Crown Prince Frederick William to the throne (which took place only in 1888). Richter aspired to build up a strong united liberal force in the Reichstag parliament, similar to the British Liberal Party under William Ewart Gladstone. The Free-minded Party supported the extension of parliamentarism in the German constitutional monarchy, separation of church and state and Jewish emancipation. Under party chairman Franz August Schenk von Stauffenberg along with his deputies Albert Hänel and Rudolf Virchow, the Free-minded Party received disappointing 17.6% of the votes in the 1884 federal election, representing a drop of 3.6% from the combined parties' results in the previous 1881 federal election. The main beneficiaries of this defection were the Conservative forces, supporting the protectionist, colonist and anti-socialist policies of Chancellor Otto von Bismarck. In the 1887 federal election, the party again lost half of their seats, dropping down to 32 Reichstag mandates. Though urged by his wife Princess Royal Victoria, Crown Prince Frederick William did not dare to meet trouble with Bismarck by openly taking the party's side. His early death in 1888 and the accession of his son William II terminated all liberal hopes. During the decay, the differences between progressives and centre-right liberals became inconsolable. Upon Bismarck's demission in 1890, the party members lost their common adversary. In 1893, the Free-minded Party split in conflict over Chancellor Leo von Caprivi's policies into the Free-minded People's Party and the Free-minded Union. A re-union took place in 1910, when both further weakened liberal parties merged with the German People's Party to form the Progressive People's Party.

Distillation is the separation or partial separation of a liquid feed mixture into components or fractions by selective boiling (or evaporation) and condensation. The process produces at least two output fractions. These fractions include at least one volatile distillate fraction, which has boiled and been separately captured as a vapor condensed to a liquid, and practically always a bottoms (or residuum) fraction, which is the least volatile residue that has not been separately captured as a condensed vapor. An alternative to continuous distillation is batch distillation, where the mixture is added to the unit at the start of the distillation, distillate fractions are taken out sequentially in time (one after another) during the distillation, and the remaining bottoms fraction is removed at the end. Because each of the distillate fractions are taken out at different times, only one distillate exit point (location) is needed for a batch distillation and the distillate can just be switched to a different receiver, a fraction-collecting container. Batch distillation is often used when smaller quantities are distilled. In a continuous distillation, each of the fraction streams is taken simultaneously throughout operation; therefore, a separate exit point is needed for each fraction. In practice when there are multiple distillate fractions, the distillate exit points are located at different heights on a fractionating column. The bottoms fraction can be taken from the bottom of the distillation column or unit, but is often taken from a reboiler connected to the bottom of the column. Each fraction may contain one or more components (types of chemical compounds). When distilling crude oil or a similar feedstock, each fraction contains many components of similar volatility and other properties. Although it is possible to run a small-scale or laboratory continuous distillation, most often continuous distillation is used in a large-scale industrial process. Industrial application Distillation is one of the unit operations of chemical engineering. Continuous distillation is used widely in the chemical process industries where large quantities of liquids have to be distilled. Such industries are the natural gas processing, petrochemical production, coal tar processing, liquor production, liquified air separation, hydrocarbon solvents production, cannabinoid separation and similar industries, but it finds its widest application in petroleum refineries. In such refineries, the crude oil feedstock is a very complex multicomponent mixture that must be separated and yields of pure chemical compounds are not expected, only groups of compounds within a relatively small range of boiling points, which are called fractions. These fractions are the origin of the term fractional distillation or fractionation. It is often not worthwhile separating the components in these fractions any further based on product requirements and economics. Industrial distillation is typically performed in large, vertical cylindrical columns (as shown in images 1 and 2) known as \\"distillation towers\\" or \\"distillation columns\\" with diameters ranging from about 65 centimeters to 11 meters and heights ranging from about 6 meters to 60 meters or more. Principle Image 3: Chemical engineering schematic of Continuous Binary Fractional Distillation tower. A binary distillation separates a feed mixture stream into two fractions: one distillate and one bottoms fractions. The principle for continuous distillation is the same as for normal distillation: when a liquid mixture is heated so that it boils, the composition of the vapor above the liquid differs from the liquid composition. If this vapor is then separated and condensed into a liquid, it becomes richer in the lower boiling point component(s) of the original mixture. This is what happens in a continuous distillation column. A mixture is heated up, and routed into the distillation column. On entering the column, the feed starts flowing down but part of it, the component(s) with lower boiling point(s), vaporizes and rises. However, as it rises, it cools and while part of it continues up as vapor, some of it (enriched in the less volatile component) begins to descend again. Image 3 depicts a simple continuous fractional distillation tower for separating a feed stream into two fractions, an overhead distillate product and a bottoms product. The \\"lightest\\" products (those with the lowest boiling point or highest volatility) exit from the top of the columns and the \\"heaviest\\" products (the bottoms, those with the highest boiling point) exit from the bottom of the column. The overhead stream may be cooled and condensed using a water-cooled or air-cooled condenser. The bottoms reboiler may be a steam-heated or hot oil-heated heat exchanger, or even a gas or oil-fired furnace. In a continuous distillation, the system is kept in a steady state or approximate steady state. Steady state means that quantities related to the process do not change as time passes during operation. Such constant quantities include feed input rate, output stream rates, heating and cooling rates, reflux ratio, and temperatures, pressures, and compositions at every point (location). Unless the process is disturbed due to changes in feed, heating, ambient temperature, or condensing, steady state is normally maintained. This is also the main attraction of continuous distillation, apart from the minimum amount of (easily instrumentable) surveillance; if the feed rate and feed composition are kept constant, product rate and quality are also constant. Even when a variation in conditions occurs, modern process control methods are commonly able to gradually return the continuous process to another steady state again. Since a continuous distillation unit is fed constantly with a feed mixture and not filled all at once like a batch distillation, a continuous distillation unit does not need a sizable distillation pot, vessel, or reservoir for a batch fill. Instead, the mixture can be fed directly into the column, where the actual separation occurs. The height of the feed point along the column can vary on the situation and is designed so as to provide optimal results. See McCabe–Thiele method. A continuous distillation is often a fractional distillation and can be a vacuum distillation or a steam distillation. Design and operation Design and operation of a distillation column depends on the feed and desired products. Given a simple, binary component feed, analytical methods such as the McCabe–Thiele method or the Fenske equation can be used to assist in the design. For a multi-component feed, computerized simulation models are used both for design and subsequently in operation of the column as well. Modeling is also used to optimize already erected columns for the distillation of mixtures other than those the distillation equipment was originally designed for. When a continuous distillation column is in operation, it has to be closely monitored for changes in feed composition, operating temperature and product composition. Many of these tasks are performed using advanced computer control equipment. =Column feed= The column can be fed in different ways. If the feed is from a source at a pressure higher than the distillation column pressure, it is simply piped into the column. Otherwise, the feed is pumped or compressed into the column. The feed may be a superheated vapor, a saturated vapor, a partially vaporized liquid-vapor mixture, a saturated liquid (i.e., liquid at its boiling point at the column's pressure), or a sub-cooled liquid. If the feed is a liquid at a much higher pressure than the column pressure and flows through a pressure let-down valve just ahead of the column, it will immediately expand and undergo a partial flash vaporization resulting in a liquid-vapor mixture as it enters the distillation column. =Improving separation= Image 4: Simplified chemical engineering schematic of Continuous Fractional Distillation tower separating one feed mixture stream into four distillate and one bottoms fractions Although small size units, mostly made of glass, can be used in laboratories, industrial units are large, vertical, steel vessels (see images 1 and 2) known as \\"distillation towers\\" or \\"distillation columns\\". To improve the separation, the tower is normally provided inside with horizontal plates or trays as shown in image 5, or the column is packed with a packing material. To provide the heat required for the vaporization involved in distillation and also to compensate for heat loss, heat is most often added to the bottom of the column by a reboiler, and the purity of the top product can be improved by recycling some of the externally condensed top product liquid as reflux. Depending on their purpose, distillation columns may have liquid outlets at intervals up the length of the column as shown in image 4. Reflux Large-scale industrial fractionation towers use reflux to achieve more efficient separation of products. Reflux refers to the portion of the condensed overhead liquid product from a distillation tower that is returned to the upper part of the tower as shown in images 3 and 4. Inside the tower, the downflowing reflux liquid provides cooling and partial condensation of the upflowing vapors, thereby increasing the efficacy of the distillation tower. The more reflux that is provided, the better is the tower's separation of the lower boiling from the higher boiling components of the feed. A balance of heating with a reboiler at the bottom of a column and cooling by condensed reflux at the top of the column maintains a temperature gradient (or gradual temperature difference) along the height of the column to provide good conditions for fractionating the feed mixture. Reflux flows at the middle of the tower are called pumparounds. Changing the reflux (in combination with changes in feed and product withdrawal) can also be used to improve the separation properties of a continuous distillation column while in operation (in contrast to adding plates or trays, or changing the packing, which would, at a minimum, require quite significant downtime). Plates or trays Image 5: Cross-sectional diagram of a binary fractional distillation tower with bubble-cap trays. (See theoretical plate for enlarged tray image.) Distillation towers (such as in images 3 and 4) use various vapor and liquid contacting methods to provide the required number of equilibrium stages. Such devices are commonly known as \\"plates\\" or \\"trays\\".Photographs of bubble cap and other tray types (Website of Raschig Gmbh) Each of these plates or trays is at a different temperature and pressure. The stage at the tower bottom has the highest pressure and temperature. Progressing upwards in the tower, the pressure and temperature decreases for each succeeding stage. The vapor–liquid equilibrium for each feed component in the tower reacts in its unique way to the different pressure and temperature conditions at each of the stages. That means that each component establishes a different concentration in the vapor and liquid phases at each of the stages, and this results in the separation of the components. Some example trays are depicted in image 5. A more detailed, expanded image of two trays can be seen in the theoretical plate article. The reboiler often acts as an additional equilibrium stage. If each physical tray or plate were 100% efficient, then the number of physical trays needed for a given separation would equal the number of equilibrium stages or theoretical plates. However, that is very seldom the case. Hence, a distillation column needs more plates than the required number of theoretical vapor–liquid equilibrium stages. Packing Another way of improving the separation in a distillation column is to use a packing material instead of trays. These offer the advantage of a lower pressure drop across the column (when compared to plates or trays), beneficial when operating under vacuum. If a distillation tower uses packing instead of trays, the number of necessary theoretical equilibrium stages is first determined and then the packing height equivalent to a theoretical equilibrium stage, known as the height equivalent to a theoretical plate (HETP), is also determined. The total packing height required is the number of theoretical stages multiplied by the HETP. This packing material can either be random dumped packing such as Raschig rings or structured sheet metal. Liquids tend to wet the surface of the packing and the vapors pass across this wetted surface, where mass transfer takes place. Unlike conventional tray distillation in which every tray represents a separate point of vapor–liquid equilibrium, the vapor–liquid equilibrium curve in a packed column is continuous. However, when modeling packed columns it is useful to compute a number of theoretical plates to denote the separation efficiency of the packed column with respect to more traditional trays. Differently shaped packings have different surface areas and void space between packings. Both of these factors affect packing performance. Another factor in addition to the packing shape and surface area that affects the performance of random or structured packing is liquid and vapor distribution entering the packed bed. The number of theoretical stages required to make a given separation is calculated using a specific vapor to liquid ratio. If the liquid and vapor are not evenly distributed across the superficial tower area as it enters the packed bed, the liquid to vapor ratio will not be correct in the packed bed and the required separation will not be achieved. The packing will appear to not be working properly. The height equivalent to a theoretical plate (HETP) will be greater than expected. The problem is not the packing itself but the mal-distribution of the fluids entering the packed bed. Liquid mal-distribution is more frequently the problem than vapor. The design of the liquid distributors used to introduce the feed and reflux to a packed bed is critical to making the packing perform at maximum efficiency. Methods of evaluating the effectiveness of a liquid distributor can be found in references.Random Packing, Vapor and Liquid Distribution: Liquid and gas distribution in commercial packed towers, Moore, F., Rukovena, F., Chemical Plants & Processing, Edition Europe, August 1987, p. 11-15Structured Packing, Liquid Distribution: A new method to assess liquid distributor quality, Spiegel, L., Chemical Engineering and Processing 45 (2006), p. 1011-1017 =Overhead system arrangements= Images 4 and 5 assume an overhead stream that is totally condensed into a liquid product using water or air-cooling. However, in many cases, the tower overhead is not easily condensed totally and the reflux drum must include a vent gas outlet stream. In yet other cases, the overhead stream may also contain water vapor because either the feed stream contains some water or some steam is injected into the distillation tower (which is the case in the crude oil distillation towers in oil refineries). In those cases, if the distillate product is insoluble in water, the reflux drum may contain a condensed liquid distillate phase, a condensed water phase and a non-condensible gas phase, which makes it necessary that the reflux drum also have a water outlet stream. Multicomponent distillation Beside fractional distillation, that is mainly used for crude oil refining, multicomponent mixtures are usually processed in order to purify their single components by mean of a series of distillation columns, i.e. the distillation train. =Distillation train= A distillation train is defined by a sequence of distillation columns arranged in series or in parallel whose aim is the multicomponent mixtures purification. =Process intensifying alternatives= The Dividing Wall Column unit is most common process-intensifying unit related to distillation. In particular, it is the arrangement in a single column shell of the Petlyuk configuration that has been proved to be thermodynamically equivalent. ExamplesContinuous distillation of crude oil= Petroleum crude oils contain hundreds of different hydrocarbon compounds: paraffins, naphthenes and aromatics as well as organic sulfur compounds, organic nitrogen compounds and some oxygen-containing hydrocarbons such as phenols. Although crude oils generally do not contain olefins, they are formed in many of the processes used in a petroleum refinery. The crude oil fractionator does not produce products having a single boiling point; rather, it produces fractions having boiling ranges. For example, the crude oil fractionator produces an overhead fraction called \\"naphtha\\" which becomes a gasoline component after it is further processed through a catalytic hydrodesulfurizer to remove sulfur and a catalytic reformer to reform its hydrocarbon molecules into more complex molecules with a higher octane rating value. The naphtha cut, as that fraction is called, contains many different hydrocarbon compounds. Therefore, it has an initial boiling point of about 35 °C and a final boiling point of about 200 °C. Each cut produced in the fractionating columns has a different boiling range. At some distance below the overhead, the next cut is withdrawn from the side of the column and it is usually the jet fuel cut, also known as a kerosene cut. The boiling range of that cut is from an initial boiling point of about 150 °C to a final boiling point of about 270 °C, and it also contains many different hydrocarbons. The next cut further down the tower is the diesel oil cut with a boiling range from about 180 °C to about 315 °C. The boiling ranges between any cut and the next cut overlap because the distillation separations are not perfectly sharp. After these come the heavy fuel oil cuts and finally the bottoms product, with very wide boiling ranges. All these cuts are processed further in subsequent refining processes. = Continuous distillation of cannabis concentrates = A typical application for distilling cannabis concentrates is butane hash oil (BHO). Short path distillation is a popular method due to the short residence time which allows for minimal thermal stress to the concentrate. In other distillation methods such as circulation, falling film and column distillation the concentrate would be damaged from the long residence times and high temperatures that must be applied.

He admitted to the aggravated murder and aggravated robbery in the death of Daniel L. Baker on 10 September 1996. He was executed by lethal injection at the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility after spending 8 years, three months, and 11 days on death row. Ashworth met Baker for the first time while drinking at the Wagon Wheel, a bar in Newark, Ohio. They went to another bar, and while returning to the Wagon Wheel at around 9 p.m., Ashworth took Baker into an alley where he beat him with his fists, feet and a 6-foot board. Ashworth would later say that Baker made unwanted sexual advances to him. Ashworth took $40 and three credit cards from Baker's wallet and went back to the Wagon Wheel. Later he took his then- girlfriend, Tanna Brett, to the alley and found Baker still alive. They went to another bar but Ashworth left, saying he would make sure Baker could not identify him. Brett returned to the alley and heard a metallic sound and found Baker's body near a metal loading dock door. A deputy-coroner would later testify that Baker's injuries were consistent with a high-speed traffic accident or plane crash. Baker's body was later found at 3:45 a.m. by a couple walking a dog. Thirty minutes later, Ashworth made an anonymous 9-1-1 call to inform police of the beating. The call was traced and Ashworth was arrested. He pleaded guilty at his trial and waived the right to present mitigating evidence. His defense lawyer did not cross-examine any witnesses. In May 2005, he dismissed his lawyers who were trying to keep him alive. On 31 August 2005 Ashworth refused to appear before a hearing of the Ohio Parole Board, which recommended that he be executed.

Engagements took place across vast areas of Anhui, Henan, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Hubei provinces over a period of four and a half months. This battle was the longest, largest and arguably the most significant battle in the early stages of the Second Sino-Japanese War. More than one million National Revolutionary Army troops from the Fifth and Ninth War Zone were put under the direct command of Chiang Kai-shek, defending Wuhan from the Central China Area Army of the Imperial Japanese Army led by Shunroku Hata. Chinese forces were also supported by Soviet Volunteer Group, a group of volunteer pilots from Soviet Air Forces. Although the battle ended with the eventual capture of Wuhan by the Japanese forces, it resulted in heavy casualties on both sides, as high as 1.2 million combined by some estimates. With the Japanese suffering their heaviest losses of the war, they decided to divert their attention to the north, prolonging the war until the attack on Pearl Harbor. The end of the battle signaled the beginning of a strategic stalemate in the war, shifting from large pitched battles to localised struggles. Background On 7 July 1937, the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) launched a full-scale invasion of China following the Marco Polo Bridge Incident. Both Beijing and Tianjin fell to the Japanese by July 30, exposing the rest of the North China Plain. To disrupt the invasion plans of the Japanese, the Nationalists decided to engage the Japanese in Shanghai, opening a second front. The fighting lasted from 13 August to 12 November, with the Chinese suffering major casualties including \\"70 percent of Chiang Kai-shek's young officers\\". After the fall of Shanghai, Nanjing, which was the capital of China, was threatened directly by the Japanese forces. The nationalists were thus forced to declare the capital as an open city while beginning the process of moving the capital to Chongqing. With the fall of three major Chinese cities (Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai), there was a large number of refugees fleeing the fighting in addition to the government facilities and war supplies that needed to be transferred to Chongqing. Due to inadequacies in the transport systems, the government was unable to complete the transfer. Wuhan thus became the \\"de facto wartime capital\\" of the Republic of China, due to its strong industrial, economic and cultural foundations. Assistance from the Soviet Union provided additional military and technical resources, including the Soviet Volunteer Group. On the Japanese side, the IJA forces were drained due to the large number and extent of military operations since the beginning of the invasion. Reinforcements were thus dispatched to boost forces in the area, but this placed a considerable strain on the Japanese peacetime economy. This caused then-Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe to reassemble his Cabinet in 1938 as well as to introduce the National Mobilization Law on 5 May that year, moving Japan into a wartime economic state. Although putting Japan's economy on a wartime footing slowed down the depletion of its treasury, the economic situation was not sustainable long-term, given the cost of maintaining a military that could deal with the Soviet Union in a border conflict. The Japanese government thus wished to force the Chinese into submission quickly in order to gather resources to move on with their decision over northward and southward expansion. For the Japanese commanders, it was decided that Chinese resistance should be put to an end at Wuhan. =Importance of Wuhan= Location of Wuhan within alt= Wuhan, located halfway upstream of the Yangtze River, was the second largest city in China with a population of 1.5 million in late 1938. The Yangtze River and the Hanshui River divides the city into three regions, which include Wuchang, Hankou and Hanyang. Wuchang was the political center, Hankou was the commercial district and Hanyang was the industrial area. After the completion of the Yuehan Railway, the importance of Wuhan as a major transportation hub in the interior of China was further established. It also served as an important transit point for foreign aid moving inland from the southern ports. Chiang Kai-Shek inspecting Chinese soldiers in Wuhan as Japanese forces approach the city After the Japanese capture of Nanjing, the bulk of Nationalist government agencies and military command headquarters were located in Wuhan despite the fact that the capital had been moved to Chongqing. Wuhan thus became the de facto wartime capital at the onset of the engagements in Wuhan. The Chinese war effort was thus focused on protecting Wuhan from being occupied by the Japanese. The Japanese government and the headquarters of the China Expeditionary Army expected Wuhan to fall along with the Chinese resistance \\"within a month or two\\". =Preparations for the battle= In December 1937, the Military Affairs Commission was created to determine the battle plan for the defense of Wuhan. After the loss of Xuzhou, approximately 1.1 million men or 120 divisions of the National Revolutionary Army were redeployed. The commission decided to organize the defense around the Dabie Mountains, Poyang Lake, and the Yangtze River against the 200,000 Japanese, or 20 divisions of the Imperial Japanese Army. Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi of the Fifth War Zone were assigned to defend the north of the Yangtze, while Chen Cheng of the Ninth War Zone was tasked with defending the south. The First War Zone, located in the west of the Zhengzhou-Xinyang section of the Pinghan Railway, was given the task of stopping the Japanese forces coming from the North China Plain. Finally, Chinese troops in the Third War Zone, located between Wuhu, Anqing and Nanchang, were given the task to protect the Yuehan Railway. Chinese troops crossing the Yellow River in June 1938, the river was deliberately flooded by Chinese forces to buy time for the defence of Wuhan After the Japanese occupied Xuzhou in May 1938, they sought to actively expand the scale of the invasion. The IJA decided to send a vanguard to first occupy Anqing for use as a forward base for an attack on Wuhan, then for its main force to attack the area north of the Dabie Mountains moving along the Huai River, eventually occupying Wuhan by way of the Wusheng Pass. After that, another detachment would move west along the Yangtze. However, due to the Yellow River flood, the IJA was forced to abandon the plan of attacking along the Huai, and decided to attack along both banks of the Yangtze instead. On 4 May, the commander of the IJA forces, Shunroku Hata, organised approximately 350,000 men of the Second and Eleventh Armies for the fighting in and around Wuhan. Under him, Yasuji Okamura commanded five and a half divisions of the Eleventh Army along both banks of the Yangtze in the main assault on Wuhan while Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni commanded four and a half divisions of the Second Army along the northern foot of the Dabie Mountains to assist the assault. These forces were augmented by 120 ships of the Third Fleet of the Imperial Japanese Navy under Koshirō Oikawa, more than 500 planes of the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service as well as five divisions of Japanese forces from the Central China Area Army to guard the areas in and around Shanghai, Beijing, Hangzhou, and other important cities, thus protecting the back of the Japanese forces and completing the preparation for the battle. Prelude A famous photo of a 15 years old teenage soldier pictured by Robert Capa in Hankow The Battle of Wuhan was preceded by a Japanese air strike on 18 February 1938. It was known as the \\"2.18 Air Battle\\" and ended with Chinese forces repelling the attack. On 24 March, the Diet of Japan passed the National Mobilization Law that authorized unlimited war funding. As part of the law, the National Service Draft Ordinance also allowed the conscription of civilians. On 29 April, the Japanese air force launched major air strikes on Wuhan to celebrate Emperor Hirohito's birthday. The Chinese, with prior intelligence, were well prepared. This battle was known as the \\"4.29 Air Battle\\" and was one of the most intense air battles of the Second Sino-Japanese War. Japanese armoured vehicles and pioneer troops approaching Wuhan After the fall of Xuzhou in May 1938, the Japanese planned an extensive invasion of Hankou and the takeover of Wuhan, intending to destroy the main force of the National Revolutionary Army. The Chinese, on the other hand, were building up their defensive efforts by massing troops in the Wuhan area. They also set up an defensive line in Henan to delay the Japanese forces coming from Xuzhou. However, due to the disparity in Chinese and Japanese troop strength, this line of defense collapsed quickly. In an attempt to win more time for the preparation of the defense of Wuhan, the Chinese opened up the dikes of the Yellow River in Huayuankou, Zhengzhou on 9 June. The flood, now known as the 1938 Yellow River flood, forced the Japanese to delay their attack on Wuhan. However, it also caused around 500,000 to 900,000 civilian deaths, flooding many cities in the north of China. Major engagementsSouth of the Yangtze River= Chinese mortars in Xinyang On 15 June, the Japanese made a naval landing and captured Anqing, signalling the onset of the Battle of Wuhan. On the southern bank of the Yangtze River, the Chinese Ninth War Zone had one regiment stationed west of Poyang Lake, and another regiment stationed in Jiujiang. On 24 June, the Japanese forces made a surprise landing in Madang, while the main force of the Japanese Eleventh Army attacked along southern shore of the Yangtze River. Madang quickly fell to the Japanese, which opened up the route to Jiujiang. The Chinese defenders tried to resist the Japanese advance, but they could not repel the landing force of the Japanese 106th Division from capturing Jiujiang on the 26th. The Japanese Namita detachment moved westward along the river, landing northeast of Ruichang on 10 August and mounting an assault on the city. The defending NRA 2nd Corps was reinforced by the 32nd Army Group and was initially able to halt the Japanese attack. However, when the Japanese 9th Division entered the fray, the Chinese defenders were exhausted, and Ruichang was captured on the 24th. The Japanese 9th Division and the Namita detachment continued to move along the river, while the Japanese 27th Division invaded Ruoxi at the same time. The Chinese 30th and 18th Corps resisted along the Ruichang-Ruoxi Road and the surrounding area, resulting in a stalemate for more than a month until the Japanese 27th Division captured Ruoxi on 5 October. The Japanese forces then turned to strike northeast, capturing Xintanpu in Hubei on the 18th and then moving towards Dazhi. In the meantime, other Japanese forces and the supporting river fleet continued their advance westwards along the Yangtze, encountering resistance from the defending Chinese 31st Army and 32nd Army Group west of Ruichang. When the town of Madang and Fujin Mountain, both in Yangxin County, were captured, the Chinese 2nd Corps deployed the 6th, 56th, 75th and 98th Armies along with the 30th Army Group to strengthen the defense of the Jiangxi region. The battle continued until 22 October when the Chinese lost other towns in Yangxin county, Dazhi and Hubei province. The Japanese 9th Division and Namita detachment were now approaching Wuchang. =Wanjialing= Advancing Chinese troops during the Battle of Wanjialing While the Japanese Army attacked Ruichang, the 106th Division moved along the Nanxun Railway (now known as Nanchang-Jiujiang) on the south side. The defending Chinese 4th Army, 8th Army Group, and 29th Army Group relied on the advantageous terrain of Lushan and north of Nanxun Railway to resist. As a result, the Japanese offensive suffered a setback. On 20 August, the Japanese 101st Division crossed the Poyang Lake from Hukou County to reinforce the 106th Division, breaching the Chinese 25th Army's defensive line and capturing Xinzhi. They then attempted to occupy De'an County and Nanchang together with the 106th Division to protect the southern flank of the Japanese Army which was advancing westward. Xue Yue, the commander-in-chief of the Chinese First Corps, used the 4th, 29th, 66th, and 74th Armies to link with the 25th Army and engage the Japanese in a fierce battle at Madang and north of De'an, bringing the battle to a stalemate. Towards the end of September, 4 regiments of the Japanese 106th Division circled into the Wanjialing region, west of De'an. Xue Yue commanded the Chinese 4th, 66th, and 77th Armies to flank the Japanese. The 27th Division of the Japanese Army attempted to reinforce the position but was ambushed and repulsed by the Chinese 32nd Army led by Shang Zhen in Baisui Street, west of Wanjialing. On 7 October, the Chinese Army mounted a final large-scale assault to encircle the Japanese troops. The fierce battle continued for three days, and all Japanese counter-attacks were repelled by the Chinese. By 10 October, the Japanese 106th Division as well as the 9th, 27th, and 101st Divisions which had gone to reinforce the 106th had all suffered heavy casualties. The Aoki, Ikeda, Kijima, and Tsuda brigades were also annihilated in the encirclement. With Japanese forces in the area losing combat command capabilities, hundreds of officers were airdropped into the area. Of the four Japanese divisions which had gone into the battle, only around 1,500 men made it out of the encirclement. This was later called the Victory of Wanjialing by the Chinese. After the war, in the year 2000, Japanese military historians admitted the heavy damages that the 9th, 27th, 101st and 106th Divisions and their subordinate units had suffered during the Battle of Wanjialing, multiplying the number of war dead honoured in Japanese shrines. It was also said that the damages were not admitted during the war in order to maintain public morale and confidence in the war effort. =North of the Yangtze River= In Shandong, 1,000 soldiers under Shi Yousan, who had defected multiple times to rivaling warlord cliques and was currently independent, occupied Jinan and held it for a few days. Guerrillas also held Yantai for a short period of time. The area east of Changzhou all the way to Shanghai was controlled by another non-government Chinese force led by Dai Li, employing guerrilla tactics in the suburbs of Shanghai and across the Huangpu River. This force was made up of secret society members of the Green Gang and the Tiandihui, killing spies and traitors. They lost more than 100 men during their operations. On 13 August, members of this force sneaked into the Japanese air base at Hongqiao, raising a Chinese flag. Chinese defenders around the Yangtze River during the Battle of Wuhan While these factions were active, the Japanese 6th Division breached the defensive lines of Chinese 31st and 68th Army on 24 July and captured Taihu, Susong, and Huangmei counties on 3 August. As the Japanese continued to move westward, the Chinese 4th Army of the Fifth War Zone deployed their main force in Guangji, Hubei and Tianjia Town to intercept the Japanese offensive. The 11th Army Group and the 68th Army were ordered to form a line of defense in Huangmei county, while the 21st and 29th Army Group, as well as the 26th Army, moved south to flank the Japanese. The Chinese recaptured Taihu on 27 August and Susong on 28 August. However, with Japanese reinforcements arriving on 30 August, the Chinese 11th Army Group and the 68th Army were unsuccessful in their counteroffensives. They retreated to the Guangji region to continue to resist the Japanese forces along with the Chinese 26th, 55th, and 86th Armies. The Chinese 4th Army Group ordered the 21st and 29th Army Groups to flank the Japanese from northeast of Huangmei, but they were unable to stop the Japanese advance. Guangji was then captured on 6 September. On 8 September, Guangji was recovered by the Chinese 4th Corps but Wuxue was lost on that same day. The Japanese Army then lay siege to Tianjia Town Fort. The Chinese 4th Corps sent the 2nd Army to reinforce the 87th Army, and the 26th, 48th, and 86th Armies to flank the Japanese. However, they were beaten back and suffered many casualties at the hands of the battle-hardened Japanese, who had greater firepower . The Tianjia Town Fort was captured on the 29th, and the Japanese continued to attack westwards. They captured Huangpo on 24 October and were now approaching Hankou. =Dabie Mountains= In the north of the Dabie Mountains, the Chinese 3rd Army Group of the Fifth War Zone stationed the 19th and 51st Army Groups and the 77th Army in the Liuan and Huoshan regions in Anqing. The 71st Army was tasked with the defense of Fujin Mountain and Gushi County in Henan. The Chinese 2nd Group Army was stationed in Shangcheng, Henan and Macheng, Hubei. The Chinese 27th Army Group and the 59th Army was stationed in the Yellow River region, and the 17th Army was deployed in the Xinyang region to organise the defensive works. The Japanese attacked in late August with the 2nd Army Group marching from Hefei on two different routes. The 13th Division, on the southern route, breached the Chinese 77th Army's defensive line and captured Huoshan, then turned towards Yejiaji. The nearby Chinese 71st Army and the 2nd Army Group made use of their existing positions to resist the Japanese onslaught, halting the Japanese 13th Division. The 16th Division was thus called in to reinforce the attack. On 16 September, the Japanese captured Shangcheng. The defenders retreated southwards out of the city, using their strategic strongholds in the Dabie Mountains to continue the resistance. On 24 October, the Japanese occupied Macheng. The 10th Division was the main force in the northern route. They breached the Chinese 51st Army's defensive line and captured Liuan on 28 August. On 6 September, they captured Gushi and continued their advance westwards. The Chinese 27th Army Group and the 59th Army gathered in the Yellow River region to resist. After ten days of fierce fighting, the Japanese crossed the Yellow River on 19 September. On the 21st, the Japanese 10th Division defeated the Chinese 17th Group Army and 45th Army, capturing Lushan. The 10th Division then continued to move westward, but met a Chinese counterattack east of Xinyang and was forced to withdraw back to Lushan. The Japanese 2nd Army Group ordered the 3rd Division to assist the 10th Division in taking Xinyang. On 6 October, the 3rd Division circled back to Xintang and captured the Liulin station of Pinghan Railway. On the 12th, the Japanese 2nd Army captured Xinyang and moved south of the Pinghan Railway to attack Wuhan together with the 11th Army. =Fighting in Guangzhou= Japanese marine troops destroying a Chinese pillbox during the Canton Operation Due to the continuing stalemate around Wuhan and the continued influx of foreign aid to Chinese forces from ports in the south, the IJA decided to deploy 3 reserve divisions to pressure the naval shipping lines. It was thus decided to occupy the Guangdong port by way of an amphibious landing. Because of the fighting in Wuhan, the bulk of Chinese forces in Guangzhou had been transferred away. As such, the pace of the occupation was much smoother than expected and Guangzhou fell to the Japanese on 21 October. The successive victories attained by the Japanese forces completed the encirclement of Wuhan. Since the loss of the Guangzhou area meant that no more foreign aid would be flowing in, the strategic value of Wuhan was lost. The Chinese Army, hoping to save their remaining forces, thus abandoned the city on 25 October. The Japanese Army captured Wuchang and Hankou on 26 October and captured Hanyang on the 27th, concluding the campaign in Wuhan. Use of chemical weapons According to Yoshiaki Yoshimi and Seiya Matsuno, Emperor Shōwa authorized, by specific orders (rinsanmei), the use of chemical weapons against the Chinese.Dokugasusen Kankei Shiryō II, Kaisetsu, Jūgonen sensō gokuhi shiryōshū, Funi Shuppankan, 1997, pp.25–29. During the battle of Wuhan, Prince Kan'in transmitted the emperor's orders to use toxic gas 375 times, from August to October, 1938,Yoshimi and Matsuno, ibid. p.28, \\"Japan's poison gas used against China\\", The Free Lance-Star, 6 Octobre 1984 despite the 1899 Hague Declaration IV, 2 - Declaration on the Use of Projectiles the Object of Which is the Diffusion of Asphyxiating or Deleterious Gases,Laws of War: Declaration on the Use of Projectiles the Object of Which is the Diffusion of Asphyxiating or Deleterious Gases; July 29, 1899 Article 23 (a) of the 1907 Hague Convention IV - The Laws and Customs of War on Land, and Article 171 of the Versailles Peace Treaty. According to another memo discovered by historian Yoshiaki Yoshimi, Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni authorized the use of poison gas against the Chinese on 16 August 1938.Wakabayashi, Bob Tadashi (1991). \\"Emperor Hirohito on Localized Aggression in China \\". Sino-Japanese Studies 4 (1), p.7. A resolution adopted by the League of Nations on 14 May condemned the use of toxic gas by the Imperial Japanese Army.Herbert Bix, Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan, Perennial, 2001, p.739 Japan made heavy use of chemical weapons against China to make up for lack of numbers in combat and because China did not have any poison gas stockpiles of its own to retaliate. Japan used poison gas at Hankow in the Battle of Wuhan to break fierce Chinese resistance after conventional Japanese assaults were repelled by Chinese defenders. Rana Mitter wrote Under General Xue Yue, some 100,000 Chinese troops pushed back Japanese forces at Huangmei. At the fortress of Tianjiazhen, thousands of men fought until the end of September, with Japanese victory assured only with the use of poison gas. Yet even now, top Chinese generals seemed unable to work with each other At Xinyang, Li Zongren's Guangxi troops were battered to exhaustion. They expected that the troops of Hu Zongnan, another general close to Chiang Kai-shek, would relieve them, but instead Hu led his troops away from the city. Japan also used poison gas against Chinese Muslim armies at the Battle of Wuyuan and Battle of West Suiyuan. Aftermath After four months of intense fighting, both the Chinese Air Force and the Navy were decimated as the IJA had successfully captured Wuhan. However, the main Chinese land force remained largely intact, while the IJA was significantly weakened. The battle of Wuhan bought more time for Chinese forces and equipment in Central China to move further inland to Chongqing, laying the foundation for an extended war of resistance. After the capture of Wuhan, the IJA advance in central China was slowed down significantly by multiple battles around Changsha in 1939, 1941, and 1942. No more major offensives were launched until Operation Ichi-Go in 1944, with limited offensives mounted for the sole purpose of training recruits. The Chinese managed to preserve their strength to continue resisting the weakened IJA, reducing its capability to respond to rising tensions between Japan and the Soviet Union at the borders in the Northeast.

Chapman's Peak is the name of a mountain on the western side of the Cape Peninsula, between Hout Bay and Noordhoek in Cape Town, South Africa. The western flank of the mountain falls sharply for hundreds of metres into the Atlantic Ocean, and a road, known as Chapman's Peak Drive, hugs the near-vertical face of the mountain, linking Hout Bay to Noordhoek. Tourists and locals often stop at viewpoints along this road, which offer views of Hout Bay, The Sentinel Peak and surrounds, as well as over Noordhoek Beach. Chapman's Peak Drive is part of the route of two of South Africa's biggest mass-participation races, the Cape Argus Cycle Race and the Two Oceans Marathon. History Prince Arthur of Conaught. Chapman's Peak is named after John Chapman, the pilot of an English ship becalmed in today's Hout Bay in 1607. The skipper sent his pilot ashore to find provisions, and the name was recorded as Chapman's Chaunce. Chapman's Peak Drive was hacked out of the face of the mountain between 1915 and 1922, and at the time was regarded as a major feat of engineering. The road was closed in the 1990s, after a rockfall caused a death and a subsequent lawsuit, and subsequently reopened after being re-engineered to protect motorists from falling rocks. It was reopened in 2005 as a toll road. The road was again closed for a number of months beginning on 19 June 2008 \\"as a result of risk areas identified on the mountain above the road\\". Geology Chapman's Peak Drive. The pass is built on top of a layer of granite, cut into the softer sedimentary rocks above. The top of Chapman's Peak consists of flat, sedimentary rocks related to those that form Table Mountain. The base of the mountain, however, consists of Cape Granite and the two formations meet at a geological unconformity that is world-famous amongst earth scientists. Two different endangered vegetation types can be found along this road, and correspond to the two main geological formations. They are Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos and Cape Granite Fynbos and they are both endemic to the city of Cape Town, occurring nowhere else. There is an old, abandoned manganese mine on the northwestern slopes of the peak. The remains of a jetty from which the ore used to be shipped are directly below the workings.

The river Spree flows through the village. Together with some smaller villages (Wehrsdorf, Taubenheim) it constitutes one of the biggest villages or communities with about 7,700 inhabitants. The most iconic monument of the village is the \\"Himmelsbrücke\\" (Heaven's Bridge); it is said that the bridge will break when someone tells a lie while standing on it.  Sights  In each of the three villages of the community one will find a Lutheran church. In Wehrsdorf a Baroque-style church was built in 1724. In Taubenheim is another from the 16th century (maybe one of the oldest Lutheran churches in Germany) and in Sohland a church whose oldest parts date from the 13th century. All these churches have a beautifully cultivated cemetery nearby. The region of Upper Lusatia, where Sohland can be found, is famous because of its special timber-frame houses which combine the Franconian and Slavic styles of wooden houses. They are built like \\"a house in a house\\". Many of these special buildings still stand there; most of them date from between 1870 and 1890. In Sohland there is also an old type of these houses which is several hundred years old. Today it is a small museum (Heimatmuseum) of the rural culture of the region.  Economic structure  Even though the economic situation in the whole of Eastern Germany and especially in the region of Upper Lusatia is not that good, Sohland is quite successful in economic things, at least in comparison with other towns and villages of the region. The infrastructure is not bad. There is direct access to Bundesstraße 96 and the village has a railway station. For some years now Sohland has had direct access to the Czech Republic by car (but no trucks are allowed). Because of the beauty of the village and abundant free space to build new houses many young families come to live here. There are also some new projects for renters and older people. This way the community was able to minimize the loss of inhabitants over the last fifteen years, even though eastern Saxony lost many of its people because of a high rate of unemployment and a negative birth-death-ratio. But maybe the emigration will come to a halt in the next years because of the extremely low number of newborn children. There are also some industrial firms in the village, they produce: *furniture (Wehrsdorfer Werkstätten) *plastic products (Jokey Plastic Sohland GmbH, Augst Kunststoff-Produkte Wehrsdorf GmbH, Schicketanz GmbH) *machines (Kran- und Stahlbau Paulick GmbH, Walterscheidt GmbH) *foods (Lausitzer Früchteverarbeitung GmbH) There are also some logistical firms and a lot of service firms too. One of the hopeful new industrial foundations of the last years is a small enterprise which produces fuels on the basis of agricultural goods.  Education  All three villages still have a \\"Grundschule\\" (class 1 to 4), a mixed Haupt-/Mittelschule (comparable with a lower High school) can be found nearby (Gerhard-Hauptmann- Schule). For further education pupils have to go to Wilthen, where it is possible to attend a Gymnasium (comparable with an upper High school). Most schools that existed before 1990 were closed in the last 15 years because of economic reasons and the now lower number of pupils.

Biography In the 1980s, Kendall was a recording engineer working for the British Broadcasting Corporation. He is credited with having rediscovered lost transcription recordings of several episodes of a BBC Radio science fiction programme, Journey into Space, which he carefully cleaned up and remastered. In 1988, he left and set up his own mastering studio in Wales, which has been fitted out with modern digital mastering equipment. Recently, he has been credited with having assembled a unique collection of the highest available quality source material from The Goon Show, which he once again carefully cleaned up and remastered using modern digital equipment and techniques. Pre- recorded sound effects on The Goon Show, played into each performance by 'Grams Operators', were taken from disc lacquers and shellac. The infamous 'Fred the Oyster' effect required declicking and decrackling as the source was a Columbia shellac 78. Kendall removed large and small clicks, and the crackle from all of The Goon Show sound effects, except those scratches which were part of the gag. Recently he has been responsible for the preparation of the Goon Show Compendium CD box sets, commencing in 2008 with Volume One. These include all of the Goon Shows from Series 5 onward plus bonus features, including the complete series of The Omar Khayyam Show on Volume Eleven. Nine episodes for which commercial rights were previously held by EMI appear out of sequence on Volume Twelve. Volume Thirteen contains the only surviving off-air recordings of episodes from series 2 and 3 and from the first half of series 4. Booklets included with the sets include Technical Notes by Kendall. The special \\"The Starlings\\", and the original version of \\"The Greatest Mountain in the World\\" (the only episode from Series 4 to survive in the BBC Archive) are expected to be included, together with the remaining off-air episode from that series, on Volume Fourteen (projected for 2018), although these have previously been issued on two-CD Goon Show compilations. He has used his CEDAR Series 2 rackmount units to restore a number of well-known recordings and performers such as Django Reinhardt and Harry James, and pioneering recordings of the Mahler symphonies. The Harry James album (Hep Records) was originally recorded onto 16\\" coarse-grooved vinyl discs, which were extremely noisy due to the medium and its age. Kendall was able to remove unwanted noise, ranging from light ticks to large scratches, with appropriate adjustment of his equipment. Kendall has also recently restored the first LP recordings of three Mahler symphonies. The performances by Charles Adler were originally recorded in Vienna during the 1950s for the American SPA label, and the recordings have a wide dynamic range. Kendall removed unwanted clicks and crackle and, with the aid of sophisticated equipment, smoothed odd patches of distortion.

It is meant to be a combination of the violin and the Hawaiian ukulele. It lost popularity prior to the 1970s because the instrument was difficult to play and often returned to the manufacturer before it had been completely paid for. History The history of the ukelin is hard to trace, since there were several instruments resembling the ukelin that were produced in the 1920s. Paul F. Richter filed the first known ukelin patent in December 1924, it was granted in April 1926. The Phonoharp Company, which merged with Oscar Schmidt, Inc. the same year, began producing ukelins in 1926. However, an instrument greatly resembling the ukelin had had its patent filed in 1923, a year before Richter filed his; yet the patent, filed by John Large, was not granted until after Richter's patent had already been given. Another similar instrument had a patent filed by Walter Schmidt in 1925. Because of these patents filed one after the other it is unclear who really invented the first ukelin.Buzas, Bob. “History.” Bob’s Ukelin Home. Accessed 22 September 2013. http://www.studiobobo.com/ukelin/ Violinist Henry Charles Marx was one of the first to sell what he called a violin-uke, among many other instruments he created to be manufactured by his company Marxochime Colony. He is thought to be the first to manufacture the instrument but soon had his design copied by International Music Company, who sold it under the name ukelin. The Phonoharp Company sold Richter's design before merging with Oscar Schmidt in 1926.“The Ukelin and Related Instruments.” In Encyclopedia Smithsonian. Smithsonian Information, 1997-. Accessed 23 September 2013. http://www.si.edu/Encyclopedia_SI/nmah/ukelin.htm. Marxochime and Oscar Schmidt International, Inc. sold their instruments door-to-door through traveling salesmen, often to poor rural families. The salesmen would purchase the instruments from the company, then sell them at an inflated price, often on a payment plan. These prices increased as the economy grew stronger after the Depression. The customers were sometimes told that they were buying the instrument at a reduced price compared to a music store, but there is no evidence that they were ever sold in music stores. The instruments were usually sold for $35-$40.“What is a ukelin (violin-uke)?” The National Music Museum. Accessed 28 September 2013. http://orgs.usd.edu/nmm/FAQ.html#ukelin. Playing The ukelin has sixteen melody strings and sixteen bass strings, divided into groups of four for playing accompanying chords. There is one large bass string in each group and three smaller chord strings. The ukelin is placed on the table in front of the player. The melody strings are played with a bow in the right hand, and the bass strings are plucked or strummed with the fingernails of the left hand or a pick. The ukelin is tuned to a C major scale, and unless tuned to include them, is unable to play chromatic notes; therefore, it is limited in what it can play. For ease of playing for amateurs, the strings are given numbers, and the booklets that were sold with the ukelin would give these numbers, a tabulature notation, instead of notes on a staff, for playing simple songs.“Directions for Playing the Ukelin.” Jersey City: International Musical Corp, 1925. Decline Ukelins were sold to people under the impression that the instrument was easy to play, but this was not the case. They were also quite limited as to what they were capable of playing because they were designed as diatonic instruments.Soble, Ronald L. “Sour Note on the Ukelin.” L.A. Times Collections (22 September 1998). Accessed on 26 September 2013. http://articles.latimes.com/1988-09-22/news/vw-3277_1_string-instrument. As a result, many instruments were returned to the manufacturers, who ended up with piles of instruments that they couldn't sell. Salesmen misrepresented the instruments to customers, who felt as if they had been tricked into buying a worthless instrument. Oscar Schmidt, Inc. stopped producing the ukelin in 1964 after the new owner, Glen Peterson, discovered the shady business practices of some of his salesmen. Between instrument returns and a declining interest in musical instruments due to the advent of television as a form of family entertainment, Marxochime was no longer able to produce the violin-uke and halted production in 1972.

He was well known in history for his accomplishments at a young age, but his main strengths might have been his abilities to find the right people for the right responsibilities, rather than his own personal military might.  Initial following of Liu Xiu  Deng first met Liu Xiu when both were visiting and studying in the Xin dynasty capital of Chang'an, perhaps in 12. He befriended Liu as both were from Nanyang Commandery (roughly modern Nanyang, Henan). Later, both went back home, and Liu Xiu would eventually be involved in his brother Liu Yan's rebellion against Xin in 22. Deng apparently was not involved in any revolutionary activities against Xin at this point. After Xin fell to the Gengshi Emperor's rebel armies in 23, Liu Xiu was commissioned by the Gengshi Emperor to pacify the territory north of the Yellow River. Deng, having heard this, and believing from his earlier experience with Liu Xiu that Liu Xiu was a capable man who could do great things, left home and chased Liu Xiu, finally catching him at Yecheng (鄴城, in modern Handan, Hebei). When Liu Xiu saw Deng, he asked Deng whether he was looking for a commission. Deng gave a famous reply: :What I want is that your power and grace be extended to all territory under the heaven, and that I may contribute in a minor but sufficient way, so that my name may be recorded in history. Liu was impressed, and requested Deng to remain and give him suggestions. Deng analyzed the situation and suggested to him that the Gengshi Emperor's administration would eventually fall, and that he should be ready to establish great things. Liu agreed. Deng was later part of Liu Xiu's train while fleeing the attacks of the pretender Wang Lang in 23-24, and contributed to Liu's eventual defeat of Wang. After Wang's defeat, it was at Deng's suggestion that Liu, who had decided to break away from the Gengshi Emperor by that point, entrusted his base of the He'nei (河內, modern northern Henan north of the Yellow River) region to Kou Xun () -- a key suggestion since Kou was an able administrator who turned He'nei into a wealthy territory capable of supplying Liu's subsequent campaigns.  Campaign in the west  As Liu began to increase his influence in the east, he was pondering whom to entrust with an army to head west to try to take over territories while Gengshi Emperor's forces battled the Chimei. In 24, he commissioned Deng with a relatively small force of 20,000. Deng was quickly able to capture the Hedong (河東, modern southern Shanxi) region for Liu. After Liu declared himself emperor in 25, he gave Deng the title of prime minister and created him the Marquess of Zhan—the same title as Xiao He, his ancestor Emperor Gao's famed prime minister—implicitly comparing Deng to Xiao. Deng, at age 23, was the youngest prime minister in Han history. As Chimei forces destroyed Gengshi Emperor's later that year, forcing Gengshi Emperor's surrender, Deng decided to let the militarily mighty but administratively inept Chimei generals wear themselves out, and chose not to engage them directly, but rather made raids to harass them and meanwhile pacified the modern northern Shaanxi region by treating the people with kindness. Although he became popular among the people who were tired and fearful of Chimei's pillages, Emperor Guangwu was not pleased with his failure to engage the Chimei. Deng, reluctantly, engaged the Chimei in a number of battles but had limited success, perhaps showing that his reluctance to engage the Chimei was correct. Eventually, as he predicted, the Chimei wore out their welcome in the Guanzhong region after they pillaged and destroyed wherever they went, and they were forced to retreat east. Forces led by Emperor Guangwu himself was able to corner the Chimei and force their surrender in 27.  Role in Emperor Guangwu's administration  After the surrender of the Chimei, Emperor Guangwu, seeing that Deng was more useful as a prime minister who governs and a strategist than a general himself, summoned Deng back to the capital to be the head of his administration. In 37, after Emperor Guangwu had largely reunified the entire empire, he created Deng the Marquess of Gaomi, with a large march—four counties. Deng, like a number of other generals, realizing that Emperor Guangwu wanted to preserve their status by not giving them major duties, resigned his prime minister post. He would remain a trusted advisor to Emperor Guangwu, however, throughout Emperor Guangwu's reign. After Emperor Guangwu died in 57, Deng, being recognized as chief among those who had contributed to Emperor Guangwu's reestablishment of Han Dynasty, was given the honorary post of imperial professor (太傅, taifu) by Emperor Guangwu's son Emperor Ming. Deng himself died in 58. In 60, when Emperor Ming honored those who had served his father well by painting their portraits on a palace tower, Deng's portrait was placed in the first position. His granddaughter Deng Sui would eventually become empress to Emperor He. References * Fan, Ye. Book of the Later Han (Houhanshu), Volume 16.

Gihon Spring () in Arabic نبع ام الدرج or Fountain of the Virgin is a spring in the Kidron Valley. It was the main source of water for the Pool of Siloam in Jebus and the later City of David, the original site of Jerusalem. One of the world's major intermittent springs – and a reliable water source that made human settlement possible in ancient Jerusalem – the spring was not only used for drinking water, but also initially for irrigation of gardens in the adjacent Kidron Valley, which provided a food source for the ancient settlement. The spring rises in a cave 20 feet by 7. Being intermittent, it required the excavation of the Pool of Siloam, which stored the large amount of water needed for the town when the spring was not flowing. Before the sinking of the water table due to overpumping in modern times, the spring used to flow three to five times daily in winter, twice daily in summer, and only once daily in autumn. This peculiarity is accounted for by the supposition that the outlet from the reservoir is by a passage in the form of a siphon.Easton's Bible Dictionary 1897 It has the largest output of water in the area - 600,000 cubic meters of water a year (compared to 125,000 cubic meters for the Lifta spring in West Jerusalem.Planned Western Wall train will threaten historic Jerusalem spring, report says, Haaretz The spring is under the control of the Israeli settler organization Ir David Foundation (\\"El'ad\\"); it is sometimes used by Jewish men as a sort of ritual bath (mikvah).Nir Hasson, \\"Settler organization granted control over spring in East Jerusalem\\", Haaretz, 12 June 2012 Etymology Virgin's Fountain in 1907 The name Gihon is thought to derive from the Hebrew Giha which means \\"gushing forth\\".The name Fountain of the Virgin derives from legend that here Mary washed the swaddling clothes of Jesus. History Descent to spring Three main water systems allowed water to be brought from the spring under cover, including natural, masonry-built, and rock-cut structures: * The Middle Bronze Age Siloam Channel – a fairly straight channel dating from the Middle Bronze Age, cut 20 feet into the ground, and then covered with slabs (which themselves were then hidden by foliage). This led from the spring to the oldest, or Upper Pool of Siloam, and can be defined as an aqueduct. * The Bronze Age Warren's Shaft system – a system of tunnels, dating from slightly later than the Middle Bronze Age channel, leading from the Well Gate at the top of Ophel above Gihon, down to the spring. This passage was for people to collect water from the spring. The actual, natural vertical \\"Warren's Shaft\\", paid no role in the water system. * The Iron Age Siloam Tunnel – a winding tunnel carved into the rock, leading from the spring to the Pool of Siloam. Dating from the time of Hezekiah or earlier, it was an aqueduct that effectively replaced the Middle Bronze Age channel. The Siloam inscription was found carved into its wall. Archaeology Siloam inscription, discovered in 1880 Gihon Spring and the Siloam Pool In 1997, while a visitor centre was being constructed, the spring was discovered to have been heavily fortified at dates then thought to be Middle Bronze Age, when archaeologists unexpectedly uncovered two monumental towers, one protecting the base of Warren's Shaft, and the other protecting the spring itself. =Inscription= During an archaeological dig in 2009, a fragment of a monumental stone inscription securely dated to the eighth century BCE was discovered. Although only fragments of Hebrew lettering survive, the fragment proves that the city had monumental public inscriptions and the corresponding large public buildings in the eighth century. =Dating= A 2017 study by the Weizmann Institute of Science has redated the constructions, reporting that “Scenarios for the construction of the tower during Middle Bronze Age (MB) and Iron Age II are considered, based on the new 14C data, yielding a series of dates, the latest of which falls in the terminal phases of the 9th century BCE, alongside previous excavation data.” Israel Finkelstein has suggested that the tower could still be Bronze Age but restored in the Iron Age adding that “In any event, a late 9th century date should come as no surprise, as there are other indications for the growth of the city at that time – from the Temple Mount (in my opinion the original location of the mound of Jerusalem) to the south, in the direction of the Gihon spring”.

She was a professor of classical philology and archaeology at Harvard University. Early life and education Emily Dickinson Townsend was born on August 11, 1928 in New York City to Clinton Blake Townsend and Eleanor Mary Meneely. She was named for her grandmother, a relative of the poet Emily Dickinson. She attended the Brearley School in New York City from 1934 to 1946. She received an undergraduate degree in Greek and philosophy from Bryn Mawr College in 1950. She earned a master's degree in classical archaeology from Radcliffe College in 1954, and a Ph.D. in Greek from Bryn Mawr in 1956. Her doctoral dissertation, supervised by Richmond Lattimore, was entitled \\"Bacchylides and Lyric Style.\\"  Career  Vermeule attended the American School of Classical Studies at Athens as a Fulbright Scholar in 1950–1951, where she took part in the excavation of a Mycenaean tomb. Three years later, in 1953–1954 she studied at St Anne's College, Oxford, Oxford University, as a Catherwood Fellow. She was the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1964–1965. She taught at Bryn Mawr and Wellesley College from 1956–1958, became an assistant professor of classics in 1958, and was hired as an associate professor, at Boston University in 1961. In 1965 she returned to Wellesley, holding the position of professor of Art and Greek until 1970. She was the James Loeb Visiting Professor of Classical Philology at Harvard University in 1969. In 1970, she was appointed the Samuel Zemurray, Jr. and Doris Zemurray Stone-Radcliffe Professor at Harvard University, where she taught in both the Department of Classics and the Department of the History of Art and Architecture. She retired from teaching in 1994. In 1995, Vermeule served as the president of the American Philological Association (now Society for Classical Studies). She delivered a presidential lecture at the 1995 annual meeting in San Diego entitled \\"Archaeology and Philology: The Dirt and the Word.\\" Vermeule excavated at many sites in Greece, Turkey, Cyprus and Libya, including Gordion in the early 1950s, and Kephallenia, Messenia, Coastal East Libya, Halicarnassus, and Thera-Santorini in the 1960s. She was director of the excavations at Toumba tou Skourou, Cyprus, from 1971 to 1974. = Excavation at Toumba tou Skourou = Considered her most significant expectation, Vermeule was the director of an excavation project co-sponsored by the Department of Antiquities of the Republic of Cyprus, Harvard University, and the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. Touma tou Skourou, near Mourphou, Cyprus, was a Late Bronze Age town that Vermeule uncovered which represented three different cultures coming together: Palestinian, Egyptian, and Minoan. Due to the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974, Vermeule was forced to abruptly end her excavation and leave the island. This expedition led to her publishing two books about the excavation and the artifacts found, Toumba tou Skourou: The Mound of Darkness (1974) and Toumba tou Skourou: A Bronze Age Potter's Quarter on Morphou Bay in Cyprus (1990).  Awards and honors  Vermeule was awarded the Radcliffe Graduate Society Gold Medal in 1968. In 1980, she received the American Philological Association's Charles J.

A multi-religious site, its primary deity was the Buddhist god Upulvan and at its zenith was one of the most celebrated religious sites of the island, containing a thousand statues of the various sects of Hinduism and Buddhism. Dating from the period of Dappula I, it was maintained primarily by Sinhalese kings and merchant guilds at the port town during its time as a popular pilgrimage destination and famed emporium, having extensive contacts with Asia, Africa, Europe and the Malabar Coast. The temple was built on vaulted arches on the promontory overlooking the Indian ocean.Horatio John Suckling.

Built to the Chera style of classical Dravidian architecture, it covered a vast area housing shrines to many Hindu deities including Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu. Its rediscovered statue images and ruins from the 5th-7th century CE reflect the high points of Pallava art. The central gopuram tower of the Vimana and the other gopura towers that dominated the town were covered with plates of gilded brass, gold and copper on their roofs, and the many shrines of the town were bordered with elaborate arches and gates, giving the entire temple complex an appearance of a city to sailors who visited the port to trade and relied on its light reflecting gopura roofs for navigational purposes.Henry W.

Three of his novels have been turned into feature films; Mōryō no Hako, which won the 1996 Mystery Writers of Japan Award, was also made into an anime television series, as was Kosetsu Hyaku Monogatari, and his book Loups=Garous was adapted into an anime feature film. Vertical have published his debut novel as The Summer of the Ubume.Vertical at the New York Anime Festival Background Kyogoku was born in Otaru, Hokkaido. After dropping out of Kuwasawa Design School, he worked as a publicity agent and established a design company. In 1994, Kodansha published his first novel . He has since written many novels, and received two Japanese literary prizes; Kyogoku won the 16th Yamamoto Shūgorō Prize for Nozoki Koheiji (覘き小平次) in 2003, and won the 130th Naoki Prize for Nochi no Kōsetsu Hyaku Monogatari (後巷説百物語) in 2004.Our R25 Days 2005. Most of his works are concerned with yōkai, creatures from Japanese folklore; he describes himself as a yōkai researcher. This preference was strongly influenced by Shigeru Mizuki (水木しげる), who is an eminent yokai specialist.Kyōgoku Natsuhiko Talk Collection Yōkai Large Preaching 2005. : pp.7-27 Kyogoku participates in Mizuki's World Yōkai Association and is a member of the Kanto Mizuki Association and the Research Institute of Mysterious and Marvelous East Asian phenomena. =Yōkai= Kyogoku considers yōkai folklore to be a form of sublimation and applied this idea to his novels.This is Our Kyōgoku Natsuhiko 2004. : pp.11-12 His works are often advertised as yōkai novels by the publisher, and their covers reflect this. Nevertheless, in his writing, yōkai themselves don't appear, except as fables, which serve to explicate the criminal characters' motives. For example, in The Summer of the Ubume, ubume is introduced as part of a ghostly expectant mother folklore, considered to be an expression of hate.Kyōgoku Natsuhiko Ubume no Natsu. 1994. However, ubume doesn't actually appear until the end. =Tsukimono-Otoshi= In Kyogoku's works, especially the Kyōgokudō (京極堂) Series, the main character solves a case by clearing up a possession; this technique is called Tsukimono-Otoshi, the most striking aspect of his novels. This term is from Onmyōdō: the exorcism of yōkai, demons or ghosts. Chuzenji does Tsukimono-Otoshi as part of his rhetoric he uses in exposing the criminal character's hidden pathos, and likens the emotion to a particular yōkai folklore. This often solves the mystery, but this result is only an unexpected by-product for Chuzenji. =Book Design= Another characteristic of his work is book design: cover, thickness and layout. As explained above, he has founded a design company before, and after he became a novelist, has been working as a designer too. Therefore, remarkably for novelists, he is always concerned with the binding process of his works directly, and sometimes designs other novelists' books, e.g., Gankyū Kitan (眼球綺譚), Yukito Ayatsuji (綾辻行人).Ayatsuji Yukito Gankyū Kitan (眼球綺譚). 1995. Cover Kyogoku's books' covers are elaborately designed to match their themes. In Kyōgokudō Series, the covers always represent yōkai featured in each weird story. In Kodansha Novels version of this series, the covers are illustrations drawn by Shirou Tatsumi (辰巳四郎) and Ayako Ishiguro (石黒亜矢子), and in Kodansha Bunko version, the covers are photographs of paper dolls made by Ryō Arai (荒井良). In Kosetsu Hyaku Monogatari Series, the covers also represent yōkai, and as for the first edition of this series, the reverse sides of covers are fearful ukiyo-e which connect the story, e.g., Ono no Komachi Kyūsōzu (小野小町九相図). On the other hand, unlike these horror works, in Dosukoi Series, because these novels are comedies burlesquing other Japanese novels, the covers always represent funny fat sumo wrestlers. Thickness Almost all Kyogoku's books, especially Kyōgokudō Series, are very thick in comparison with other Japanese novels. For example, Tesso no Ori (鉄鼠の檻) is 826 pages long, Jorōgumo no Kotowari (絡新婦の理) is 829 pages long, Nuribotoke no Utage, Utage no Shitaku (塗仏の宴 宴の支度) and Nuribotoke no Utage, Utage no Shimatsu (塗仏の宴 宴の始末), a novel in two volumes, is 1248 pages long in total. Because of the thickness, his books look like bricks or dice, and are often called \\"brick books\\" or \\"dice books\\". Layout The layout of Kyogoku's writing is arranged according to his own rules. A sentence never crosses over a page break. Moreover, every time a new version is published, Kyogoku always lays out the work again according to this rule. He explained the intention, \\"I made it possible for readers to stop reading whenever they want to. If one sentence steps over, readers who are weary of reading must turn over the page. I sense that is contemptible, because not interest to the story but physical factor force readers to read.\\"ほぼ日刊イトイ新聞 - 京極夏彦はいつ眠るのか。 Second, many kanji characters in his writing are invariably given kana characters alongside. Kyogoku can use DTP software perfectly, so he freely writes old-fashioned characters and ateji characters with the purpose of capturing old Japanese atmosphere in his novels. However, such characters are difficult even for Japanese people to read. Therefore, giving kana characters alongside kanji characters in his writing is essential for readers to be able to understand those characters' meaning. Third, sentences are marked out by entering null lines before and after them on purpose. That technique enables readers to perceive the curious blank where the important sentences are written. In these ways, Kyogoku always keeps readability in mind, and dedicates himself not only to sentences but also the layout. These qualities do not, however, carry over to the English translations of his books. Works in English translation ;Kyōgokudō series *The Summer of the Ubume (original title: Ubume no Natsu), trans.

When not held back by chains, they are sometimes referred to as just Chomps. Chain Chomps constantly strain against the chain holding them, attempting to break free and bite anything that passes close by.  Development  The Chomp was inspired by a childhood experience of Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto, where a dog tried to attack him. The dog lunged at him, but was jerked back by its leash just as the canine snapped at Miyamoto inches in front of his face. In a 2017 interview, it was revealed that Chain Chomps were originally going to be in Super Mario World, as evidenced by a prototype sprite sheet.  Appearances Super Mario series= The first 3D appearance of Chain Chomp, in the game Super Mario 64. The Chain Chomp is chained to a wooden poll, guarding a star behind bars, in the stage Bob-omb Battlefield. Chain Chomps made their debut in Super Mario Bros. 3. Chain Chomps and different variations appear in all of the Mario RPG games. In games such as Super Mario 64, Super Mario Sunshine, New Super Mario Bros., Super Paper Mario, New Super Mario Bros. Wii, and Super Mario Galaxy, Chain Chomps can be set free from their chains by ground pounding on their post. Otherwise, they are often indestructible. Chain Chomps also appeared in Mario Kart: Double Dash!! as a special item for Baby Mario and Baby Luigi and an obstacle on circuit courses, and reappeared as an obstacle in Mario Kart DS and Mario Kart Wii. Also in Mario Kart Wii, a Chain Chomp has its own battle arena known as Chain Chomp Wheel. Chain Chomps are also seen on Rainbow Road in Mario Kart 64, repeatedly biting their way over the course trying to hit the player. Chain Chomps also appear without chains, such as in Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island, where they are seen at first from afar, then lunge high into the air and drop down suddenly, creating a huge crater in the ground. There are also gigantic species called \\"Chomp Sharks,\\" in which the Chomps chase the player, by \\"eating\\" the platform Yoshi is running on until it hits a solid surface. Beginning in Super Mario Bros. 3, some games feature a version of the Chain Chomp appears that has fireballs for a chain and can fly known as Flame Chomps.GameXplain. (April 27, 2015).

During their twenty-year career, they have performed over 200 live shows for several European and Russian tours, as well as a North American tour. They are known for their use of traditional instruments to augment their sound, such as the bagpipe, banjo, and tin whistle. Biography Suidakra was formed in 1994 by guitarist Arkadius Antonik and drummer Stefan Möller under the name Gloryfication. The band recorded two demos with varying lineups, until finally solidifying its line-up with keyboardist Daniela Voigt, guitarist Marcel Schoenen and bassist Christoph Zacharowski. Later in the same year the band's name was changed to Suidakra (Arkadius spelled backwards). In 1997, the band released their first album, the self-published Lupine Essence. The album attracted the attention of German record company Last Episode. A deal was signed, and the band proceeded to record their second album Auld Lang Syne in 1998. Soon after the release bassist Nils Bross replaced Christoph Zacharowski. Lays from Afar and The Arcanum were released in 1999 and 2000, respectively. At this point, the sound of the band had developed into melodic death metal reminiscent of many Gothenburg area bands. Further lineup changes took place after the release of The Arcanum, as Daniela Voigt and Stefan Möller left the band and Marcel Schoenen retired his band position to concentrate on song writing. In 2001, SuidAkrA signed a deal with Century Media Records. Drummer Lars Wehner and guitarist Germano Sanna joined Antonik and Bross to record the follow-up to The Arcanum, titled Emprise to Avalon, released in 2002. This lineup didn't last long, as Bross left the band soon after recordings were complete. Marcus Riewaldt joined the band to take up the bass spot. A year later Marcel Schoenen returned to replace Sanna. The new lineup meant a change in the creative responsibilities. For the band's sixth studio album, Signs for the Fallen, all members took part in writing material. While the lineup remained the same for the next album, the band had run into disagreement with their label and eventually split. They went on to finance the next album on their own, and later signed a new recording deal with Armageddon Music. Command to Charge was released in 2005. Their eighth studio release, titled Caledonia was released on 2006-11-17. The Scottish themed album included some fairly prominent use of highland bagpipes, contributed by Axel Römer, who also appeared on some of the larger live performances. From 5–12 August 2007, some old tracks were re-recorded for a Best Of compilation titled 13 Years of Celtic Wartunes. Others tracks were remastered. This was released on 25 April 2008. together with a live DVD containing registrations of the Wacken 2007 performance as well as the acoustic show at the Kielowatt Festival in 2006. Release dates for other regions were 2008-04-28 (Europe) and 2008-06-10 (USA). Shortly after their performance on Ultima Ratio 3 in November 2007 the band announced that Marcel Schoenen had left the band for the second time, to concentrate on his job. Consequently a new live guitar player was recruited in the form of Tim Siebrecht, ex-member of the disbanded formation Sleeping Gods. The band returned to Gernhart recording studios in November 2008 to record their ninth studio album Crógacht. The album featured greater Celtic influences, taking its name from the Gaelic word for bravery. It was released on 20 February 2009 in Germany, 23 February in the rest of Europe, and 3 March in the USA. Suidakra supported this album with a US and European tour throughout 2009. In May 2009, Suidakra announced a Chinese tour, as well as informing fans that tour guitarist and backup vocalist, Sebastian Hintz, was promoted to full member. On 6 October 2010, the band announced that, after a short tour and some festival appearances, they would enter the studio to begin recording their tenth studio album, Book of Dowth. Early the next year, the band signed with AFM Records, and Book of Dowth was released through that label on 25 March 2011. Immediately after release of the album, the band embarked on a European tour. In February 2012, Suidakra played in India for the first time, appearing at VIT University in Vellore as well as performing in Bangalore at Summer Storm Festival (supporting Opeth). A tour of the United States followed, with Tim Siebrecht standing in for Marcus Riewaldt on bass. Siebricht would become the permanent bassist for the band. Suidakra returned to India in June to perform at Bangalore Open Air as a fill-in act for Iced Earth. The title of the band's eleventh album, Eternal Defiance, was announced in December 2012, with recordings finished by February 2013. Eternal Defiance was released on 24 May 2013 by AFM Records. In September of that year, Suidakra appeared on the Heidenfest Tour with fellow folk metal bands Equilibrium, Ensiferum, and Turisas. Songwriting for Suidakra's twelfth studio album, Realms of Odoric, began in January 2015. Realms of Odoric will be a collaboration with Kris Verwimp, who is doing lyrics for the album. Verwimp had previously done cover artwork for several of the band's albums.

His recordings as a pianist include concertos by Tchaikovsky, Maurice Ravel, Rachmaninoff, Saint-Saëns and others. Early life Philippe Entremont was born in Reims to musical parents, his mother being a Grand Prix pianist and his father an operatic conductor. Philippe first received piano lessons from his mother at the age of six. His father introduced him to the world of chamber and orchestral music. He studied in Paris with Marguerite Long, and entered the Conservatoire de Paris. He won prizes in sight-reading at age 12, chamber-music aged 14, and piano at 15. He became Laureat at the international Long-Thibaud Competition at the age of 16. Career He won a prize in the 1952 Queen Elisabeth Music Competition and then began his career of serious concert-giving at the piano. Philippe Entremont, 1958 photo dedicated on first of three acclaimed musical tours of Southern Africa organised by Hans Adler http://classicalmusicianstoza.blogspot.ca/2014/06/philippe-entremont-french- pianist.html Within five years he was hailed as a new and major voice in European pianism. He earned further recognition through tours of South America and the United States; organized by the National Music League and the Jeunesses Musicales International in 1953 and 1955. Eugene Ormandy auditioned him in 1954 and at once engaged him for his Philadelphia Orchestra debut, which took place in November 1956. His early Columbia recordings with Ormandy (c.1957–58), released in Europe by Philips Records (e.g. Rachmaninoff's Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini) preserve the mood of exhilaration which attended his European debuts. His recording of Rachmaninoff's Second Concerto with Leonard Bernstein on Columbia was considered an extraordinary reading at the time. He also recorded Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1, with the same forces. He recorded Rachmaninoff's First and Fourth Concertos with Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra. The Concertos Nos. 2 and 4 of Saint-Saëns with Ormandy are noteworthy as well. Entremont made a debut as both pianist and conductor (directing from the keyboard) in 1968 on a Columbia records release in which he played Mozart's Piano Concertos Nos. 13 and 17 and conducted the Collegium Musicum of Paris. He has also recorded many of Friedrich Kuhlau's songs. Entremont was Director of the New Orleans Symphony from 1980 to 1986. He served the Denver Symphony Orchestra as principal conductor from 1986 to 1988, and music director from 1988 to 1989. Entremont has also been chief conductor of the Vienna Chamber Orchestra, and is now its Conductor Laureate. He also holds the same title with the Israel Chamber Orchestra. Entremont founded the Biennial Santo Domingo Music Festival in 1997. Since 2002 he has been Principal Guest Conductor of China's Shanghai Broadcasting Symphony Orchestra. During the 2005–2006 Season, Entremont led the Munich Symphony Orchestra as both conductor and pianist for the orchestra's U.S. debut tour. In September 2007, Entremont returned to New Orleans as soloist to open the Louisiana Philharmonic Orchestra's second post-Katrina season with Ravel's Piano Concerto in G major.

Built between 1811 and 1816 as the southern wing of the Sydney Hospital, it was then known as the Rum Hospital. In 1854 a mint was established on the site with the hospital building used to house mint staff as well as providing a residence for the Deputy Mint Master. A coining factory was built at the rear. Both of these structures have exceptional heritage significance and have been associated with major events in the colonial history of New South Wales. Located in Sydney's central business district at 10 Macquarie Street, it is near many other famous Australian historical buildings including Hyde Park Barracks, St James' Church and Parliament House. The building is now the head office of the Historic Houses Trust of New South Wales and is listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register. Sections of the building are open to the public. HistoryGeneral Hospital and The Dispensary (1811-1854)= Model of the South Wing of the General Hospital In 1811, Governor Lachlan Macquarie commenced planning for a new general hospital in Sydney which was to be his first major public building. The contractors were paid with 45,000 gallons of rum hence the name Rum Hospital. Construction was completed in 1816. Its design is loosely based on ancient Greek architecture with its two tiers of columns made of cedar timber in the style of Doric mouldings. The columns are angled inwards creating an optical illusion imitating the Parthenon in Athens, Greece. A dispensary opened in 1842 replacing the south wing after which the rest of the site was used as a military hospital until 1854. Governor Macquarie signed an agreement with Garnham Blaxcell, Alexander Riley and D'Arcy Wentworth to build a new convict hospital in November 1810. In return, the three gentlemen received the monopoly on the purchase of spirits for three years. As a result, the building became known as the Rum Hospital. While the architect is unknown, the inspiration for the form of the buildings is thought to have come from Macquarie's time in India, especially the Madras Government House. The Hospital, however, is constructed to the standard institutional army plan of the time – as seen at Victoria Barracks. The Hospital was originally constructed with three wings, the northern wing is now part of Parliament House, the central wing has been demolished and the southern wing became the Mint. The foundation stone was laid almost a year later, in October 1811, but the hospital was not ready for patients until March 1816. This was largely due to the constant inquiries into claims of poor quality materials and construction. Henry Kitchen wrote to Commissioner Bigge \\"that one would really imagine that they had been built for the very purpose of exhibiting a striking effect which such a structure would produce when in ruins\\".Walker & Moore 1990v.2:10 Architect Francis Greenway also criticised the buildings, drawing up plans to strengthen the roof. Greenway's official report on the workmanship found that the joints in the structural beams were weak, the foundations poor, that corners had been cut during construction, there was rotting stonework and dry rot in the timbers. Even though Macquarie ordered the contractors to remedy these faults, many more did not come to light until the restoration works of the 1980s. Despite all this, it is the oldest extant building in central Sydney.Walker & Moore 1990, v.2:10 Commissioner Bigge's main complaint, however, was regarding the size and grandeur of the buildings, rather than anything else. These may have been justified in the early years of its existence as the Hospital could not be sustained on such a large scale. As a result, other Government agencies occupied various sections – the Legislative Council moved into the Principal Surgeon's Quarters in 1829, pushing the Principal Surgeon out by 1848. This wing today forms the northern facade of Parliament House. Other rooms were given over to the Principal Supervisor of Convicts and Sydney's first museum. This early uncertainty over tenure of the buildings effected the growth of the Sydney Infirmary and Dispensary, as it was known from 1844 until 1881, when it became Sydney Hospital. The southern wing was first used for the treatment of convict patients and also housed the assistant surgeons and the medical store. From late-1843 until 1848 the building was used by the Dispensary. The Dispensary was created in 1826, occupying a variety of buildings around the city before being given the southern wing. The purpose of the service was to treat, as outpatients, the free poor who could not afford medical care. In 1848 the Sydney Infirmary and Dispensary gave up the southern wing to ensure ownership of the current site of the Sydney Hospital. Little seems to have occurred with the buildings until 1853. The Legislative Council of New South Wales had begun petitioning the British Government for the establishment of a Mint in 1851. The gold rush had brought in to circulation large amounts of unrefined gold that was threatening the official currency. The British Government finally approved the establishment of a Mint in 1853, sending equipment and twenty staff. Captain F.C. Ward, appointed as Deputy Mint Master, designed the required buildings and stayed in England to order the equipment. C. Trickett as Superintendent of Coining, was sent to Sydney in 1853 to direct the erection of the factory buildings and machinery and to ensure adequate security. Ward, who had worked with Joseph Paxton on London's Crystal Palace, employed similar techniques in the construction of the Mint – prefabricated cast iron columns and trusses. It was Trickett who selected the site and modified Ward's plans to incorporate the southern wing of the Hospital as accommodation and offices with the remaining factory buildings forming the other three sides of a quadrangle. The short southern reach consisted of Carpenter's and Fitting Shops. To the east were the coining and rolling rooms and the Superintendent's Office. Attached to this block, further to the east, was the engine and boiler rooms. The northern block consisted of the melting house, an office and a store room. The courtyard created was geometrically landscaped around a central feature. The Factory buildings necessitated the demolition of the hospitals kitchen and outbuildings. Construction of the pre- fabricated buildings was undertaken by a contingent of trained Sappers and Miners (Royal Engineers). =Royal Mint and the Coining Factory (1855-1926)= The British Secretary of State gave acceptance to the colonial government to establish a mint in Sydney which was to be the first branch of the Royal Mint outside England. The rear side of the mint became the coining factory. There were frequently major upgrades on the mint during the late 1800s and the early 1900s. However, by 1926, with the Melbourne and Perth Mints having much better technology and being more profitable, the mint was closed. In 1854, 19-year- old William Stanley Jevons and Francis Bowyer Miller were appointed Assayers to the Mint. Captain Edward Wolstenholme Ward, of the Royal Engineers, was appointed Deputy Master and Chief Officer, Charles Elonis Superintendent of the Bullion Office, Joseph Trickett Superintendent of the Coining Department, Robert Huat First Clerk in the Bullion Office and Elliott Knipe Registrar and Accountant.1854 'COMMERCIAL INTELLIGENCE.', The Sydney Morning Herald (NSW : 1842 - 1954), 8 November, p. 8. , viewed 11 Oct 2016, http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article12959267 The Mint began operation on 14 May 1855. Now known simply as The Mint, its official title was the Royal Mint, Sydney Branch. The first five years of operation saw exports of gold fall sharply as over one million pounds worth of gold was converted into sovereign and half sovereign coins each year. In 1868 Sydney's coins were recognised as legal tender in all British colonies, but it was not until February 1886 that they were accepted in Britain. The coins were identical to those produced in Britain, except for a small mint mark. The Sydney Branch expanded its production in 1868 to bronze coins and again in 1879 to issue Imperial silver coinage. After federation, it was one of three mints to strike the new Commonwealth coins. Small alterations continued to be made to the buildings throughout the occupation of the Mint. In the early 1860s a new assay office and crushing room were added. In 1870–75 a series of residences were constructed facing Hospital Road. The chimney was renewed in 1889. The Mint continued to struggle with the deterioration of the buildings and in 1909 the Royal Commission for the Improvement of the City of Sydney recommended the Mint be demolished as Macquarie Street was increasingly seen as the seat of government. Federation encouraged the consolidation of minting activities in Canberra, Melbourne and , the facilities in Sydney deteriorated to such an extent that the Mint was closed in January 1927, due to ageing equipment and unprofitability.Abrahams, 2016, 9 During the operation of the Mint it formed the unofficial headquarters of the Philosophical Society of New South Wales. The majority of senior staff at the Mint were founding members. With the blessing of the Society's president, Sir William Denison, also Governor of New South Wales, the Mint building and equipment was used for a number of experiments and became the heart of the scientific community in Sydney. Experiments included the investigation of the strength and elasticity of native timbers and on the combustibility of coal from Tasmania and Bellambi. The Philosophical Society also fostered other important research into weather and seismic patterns. =Government offices, Law Courts and the Museum (1927-present)= The Government Insurance Office moved into the building as soon as the Mint closed. Soon other government offices followed, including the Local Government Superannuation Board, the Electrical Contractors and Licensing Board and the Family Endowment Department. Government offices kept arriving and going for another fifty years. Gradually these buildings were being demolished. On the departure of the Mint, a series of government departments sought office space in the buildings. Similar to the Barracks next door, with no security of tenure there was little incentive to maintain the buildings and, instead fibro buildings filled all available spaces to meet the requirements of the Family Endowment Department (1927–1940), State Headquarters of National Emergency Service (1940-1950s), Housing Commission of NSW (mid 1940s) and the Land Tax Office (mid 1940s). The Court Reporting Branch, District Courts and Parliamentary Library moved in during the 1950s. Fibro-lined courtrooms were created within the former Coining Factory for use by them. In the 1930s with an increasing use of the motor car, and demand for parking spaces, the Mint's Macquarie Street gates were removed, a common fate for the gates of public buildings at the time. They were eventually acquired by Barker College at Hornsby in 1937 following the efforts of its Council Chairman, Sir John Butters. This was not the first time a school had acquired significant city gates: St. Joseph's College at Hunters Hill had bought the Sydney Town Hall gates and fencing when they became redundant with construction of Town Hall Railway Station. Construction of a new District Court in 1956 had the greatest impact on the Factory buildings. Offices replaced the residences on Hospital Road, the Assay office and stores, as well as the eastern perimeter wall. In 1968 the quartz crushing room and associated shed, melting room and rolling room were also demolished to create a car park. Restoration of the buildings, announced in 1975, were undertaken in 1977-79, with the intended purpose of utilising at least the Mint as a Museum. In 1982 the Mint opened as a branch of the Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences. It was expected that law courts would be established after the demolitions, however, activists successfully led a campaign in 1979 to preserve the Mint buildings as well as Hyde Park Barracks. The Premier of New South Wales, Neville Wran, announced that the Mint would come under control of the Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences. The museum closed down in 1997 and the building's ownership was transferred to the Historic Houses Trust. The Mint was recently named as one of 30 projects that have reshaped the built environment since 1978. \\"The refurbishment project is an example of the Integration of services systems (by Steensen Varming ), to provide a modern, functional headquarters while minimising the impact on the heritage and archaeological fabric of a site.\\" In the 1980s an attempt was made to purchase the original gates back from Barker College, but they were by now firmly part of the College's history. Instead, copies of the gates were cast in iron for reinstatement at the Mint. This reconstruction came more than 40 years following their initial removal. It inspired restoration of similar entry gates at Trickett's cottage, \\"Banksia\\" in Double Bay, to introduce a new entrance and gates sympathetic to the house's style. Joseph Trickett worked as an engineer at the Sydney Royal Mint in 1855 and \\"Banksia\\" was built at the same time as the Sydney Mint building. The moulds used in the 1980s to reconstruct decorative parts of the gates of the Mint in Macquarie Street were located and re-used to cast decorative parts of 'Banksia's new gates, not only stylistically appropriate, but one in which the original owner Trickett himself would have participated. In 1998 ownership of the site was transferred to the Historic Houses Trust, who continued to operate a small museum, plus a cafe. In 2004 restoration and construction was undertaken to enable the HHT to use the site as a Head Office. The former Coining Factory was sympathetically remodelled into offices and the Superintendent's Office to hold the Caroline Simpson Library and Research Collection. A new theatrette and foyer were also added. The work was overseen by architect Richard Francis-Jones, of FJMT Architects; Clive Lucas Stapleton and Partners as conservation architects and Godden Mackay Logan as archaeologists. In July 2016 the Mint celebrated its 200th anniversary of continuous civic function with a symposium \\"A future for the past\\" as part of a programme of events.Liebermann, 2016, 6-7 Description There are four structures relating to the current Mint curtilage. Located at the front of the allotment, facing Macquarie Street, is a wing of the original Rum Hospital. Originally, the Mint buildings were constructed behind the Hospital to form a courtyard. The building on the northern boundary, which had been demolished has recently been replaced by the foyer to the new theatrette in the eastern range. =Hospital Wing= The original Rum Hospital is a two-storey sandstone structure with a double-tier verandah around northern, western and southern sides. Sandstone columns supporting the verandah and timber roof shingles are replacements, as is the \\"Chinoiserie\\" timber lattice balustrade on the upper verandah. The verandah has been enclosed on the eastern side to form toilet and washrooms on ground floor and bathroom and kitchen on the first floor, for what was the Deputy Mint Master's residence. Internally, the main building is been divided into seven spaces on the ground floor and six on the first floor. Two of these are stairwells with associated hall/lobby, located one third from both the northern and southern ends. Attached to the south-east corner is a one-storey rectangular room with a bay window facing Macquarie Street, formerly the Library for the Deputy Mint Master's residence, now part of the Historic Houses Trust office space. =Coining Factory= The Coining Factory buildings extend in a rough L from the former Library to form a courtyard with the Rum Hospital. The structure is iron-framed, with a sandstone-facade and corrugated iron roof. On the southern boundary, separated from the former Library by a covered breezeway is a one-storey building, originally the fitting shops and carpenters' workshops, now security centre and plant rooms for air-conditioning. The eastern reach of the quadrangle, the former Factory, has been renovated into offices for use by Historic Houses Trust staff. Works also included the construction of a theatrette and facilities in the north- eastern corner, forming an extension of the eastern quadrangle boundary. Central to the northern boundary, with covered breezeways on either side, a foyer/gallery completes the new works. The new sections are constructed of steel and glass box protected by cedar louvres and boarding, designed to mirror the Superintendent's Office. The theatrette allows an opportunity to view the eastern elevation of the Hospital in the context of Sydney's skyline.De Manincor 2005:82 The central courtyard has been landscaped with a raised grass area, highlighted by a single tree in the south-east corner. =Archaeology= Carol Powell, who was employed to compile archival information relating to the Mint and Hyde Park Barracks, also undertook the recording of archaeological deposits exposed by the renovation works between 1977 and 1979. Like the Hyde Park Barracks, it became apparent that the deposits were larger and more intact than expected and required a dedicated archaeologist. Wendy Thorp undertook test excavations during 1980, which focused on three areas. The first of these were cellars located under the Hospital, probably dug following construction and filled between 1854 and 1868 when the premise was converted into the Mint. The second focus was on the courtyard, where the Hospital's kitchen had been located. The third and final area of investigation was the under and between floor spaces in the Hospital building. Unlike the Hyde Park Barracks these spaces were barren, having been cleaned out in the mid-19th century and again when the Mint was moved to Canberra. Patricia Burritt's Stage II excavations revealed further cellars under the eastern verandah, which were probably filled at a later date than the first set. In the courtyard some evidence was found of the foundations of the Hospital kitchen, along with the base of the 19th century fountain and post-Mint additions. No evidence was found of the Hospital's outbuildings adjacent to Hyde Park Barracks, or of the southern industrial buildings. Excavation was limited, in comparison to the Hyde Park Barracks, as minimal documentary evidence was available to direct the location of trenches.Crook & Murray 2003: 14-15 Heritage listing The Mint is of State significance as evidence of two important phases in New South Wales history - the development of the Colony under Governor Macquarie and its progress towards independence. The Rum Hospital, built between 1811 and 1816, is evidence of early colonial architecture and building techniques, much of the original fabric and form of the building has been retained. The buildings demonstrate the evolution and adaptation of architectural forms to Australia, including colonial army buildings. The Coining Factory is an early surviving example of a pre- fabricated cast-iron structure in New South Wales. The site became the Royal Mint, Sydney Branch and began coining in 1855 as the first mint to be established in a British colony. The place is important as one of the three Australian mints at which the Commonwealth government minted the first Australian coins following the federation of the Australian colonies. The minting of Australian coins at the Sydney Mint commenced in 1916 and continued until the closure of the building as a mint in 1927. The Mint is uncommon evidence for manufacturing during the mid 19th century in central Sydney. The site retained its importance as District Courts and Government offices, before becoming a museum. The site is also significant for the archaeological potential to reveal further information about the Rum Hospital and the minting process during the 19th and early 20th century. Hyde Park Barracks, Sydney (inclusive of the Sydney Mint), was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. There is a diversity of structures which document the evolution of the Hyde Park Barracks complex from the late Georgian era to modern times: from the era of convict cell blocks and enclosed penal institutions, through to judicial courts and offices and present-day museum. It contains two fig trees on Macquarie Street which are symbolic of a number of significant town planning schemes throughout the 19th century, such as the creation of Chancery Square, (now known as Queen's Square). Within the complex are structures associated with the first purpose built government institution for the housing of convicts. It is associated with the development of the legal system in NSW being the location of the first meeting in 1830 of the bench of magistrates for the Court of General Sessions and the first location of the Metropolitan District Court established under the District Courts Act, 1958. It is associated with other historic landmarks in the area such as the former Rum Hospital, St James' Church, Hyde Park, the Domain, St Mary's Cathedral and Macquarie Street. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. It contains elements such as the perimeter walls, parts of the two gate lodges, one former pavilion and parts of another, some external and probably internal walls on the northern range of buildings which are associated with the convict architect Francis Greenway's design.

As an adjective, \\"silver spoon\\" describes someone who has a prosperous background or is of a well-to-do family environment, often with the connotation that the person does not appreciate or deserve his or her advantage, its having been inherited rather than earned.  Historical uses  Two silver-gilt strainer spoons and a cignus spoon decorated with a mythical marine creature. (4th century AD Roman spoons from the Hoxne Hoard.) Before the place setting became popular around the 18th century, people brought their own spoons to the table, carrying them in the same way that people today carry wallet and keys. In pre- modern times, ownership of a silver spoon was an indication of social class, denoting membership in the land-owning classes. In the Middle Ages, when farmers and craftsmen worked long hours and frequently got dirt under their fingernails, it was important to not be mistaken for a serf or escaped slave. Under these circumstances, a silver spoon served the functional equivalent of passport, driving license, and credit card. Since most members of the land- owning classes were smallhold farmers and craftsmen, the silver spoon was primarily a lower-middle-class cultural marker.  History in print  Georgian spoons The phrase \\"born with a silver spoon in his mouth\\" appeared in print in English as early as 1719, in Peter Anthony Motteux's translation of the novel Don Quixote: \\"Mum, Teresa, quoth Sancho, 'tis not all Gold that glisters [sic], and every Man was not born with a Silver Spoon in his Mouth.\\" Because the phrase is used as a translation of a Spanish proverb with a different literal meaning (\\"muchas veces donde hay estacas no hay tocinos,\\" literally: \\"often where there are hooks [for hanging hams] there are no hams\\"), it seems that the phrase was already considered proverbial in English at the time. The phrase next appears in a book of Scottish proverbs published in 1721, in the form \\"Every Man is no born with a Silver Spoon in his Mouth.\\"  Variants  There are similar expressions in other languages. For example, in Portuguese and Spanish, an expression translated as \\"born in a gold cradle\\" is equivalent to the English, \\"born with a silver spoon\\". The term \\"gold spoon\\" is much less commonly used, but finds occasional use, such as the 1840 American Gold Spoon Oration criticizing then-president Martin Van Buren for his supposedly luxurious lifestyle. In some languages, like Swedish and Finnish, the common expression is gold spoon rather than silver spoon, although both can be used. \\"Silver fork novels\\" are described by English professor Paola Brunetti to her husband Guido, in Donna Leon's fourth Commissario Guido Brunetti novel Death and Judgment aka A Venetian Reckoning (1995), chapter 22, as \\"books written in the eighteenth century, when all that money pored into England from the colonies, and the fat wives of Yorkshire weavers had to be taught which fork to use.\\" See also * Apostle spoon * Cignus * Cochlearium * Silver lining (idiom) * Silver tongue * Born in the purple * Spoon class theory  References  Category:English-language idioms Category:Spoons Category:Wealth concentration ","title":"Silver spoon"},{"id":"2766992","text":"Anthony Heilbut (born November 22, 1940) is an American writer, and record producer of gospel music. He is noted for his biography of Thomas Mann, and has also won a Grammy Award. Life Anthony Heilbut, the son of German Jewish refugees Bertha and Otto Heilbut, was born in New York. He has a doctorate in English from Harvard University. He received his Ph.D. from Harvard University when he was 25. For the next ten years he taught, first at New York University and then at Hunter College. Since 1976 he has been a full- time writer and record producer. Heilbut's first book, The Gospel Sound: Good News and Bad Times, was published in 1971 and has been updated several times since then; a \\"25th Anniversary Edition\\" appeared in 1997. James Baldwin said, > It's a very beautiful book, with love and precision, no pity -- a little > like a gospel song ... I didn't know that anybody knew that much about it, > or cared that much, or could be so tough and lucid. Counter-Punch magazine selected it as one of its top 100 books of the 20th century. Exiled in Paradise: German Refugee Artists and Intellectuals in America from the 1930s to the Present was published in 1983 and updated in 1997. It was a finalist for Los Angeles Times Book of the Year. In 2003, a conference entitled \\"Exiled in Paradise\\" was held at Los Angeles' Villa Aurora, the palatial residence of Lion Feuchtwanger, one of the best-known emigre writers. (Ironically Feuchtwanger's famous novel, The Oppermanns, was inspired by Otto Heilbut's cousin Wilfrid Israel. Wilfrid, whom Christopher Isherwood called \\"the greatest man I ever met\\", was also the inspiration for the character of Herr Landauer in Isherwood's Goodbye to Berlin.) Heilbut's Thomas Mann: Eros and Literature was published in 1996. The New York Times called the book \\"brilliant\\" and \\"astonishing\\". Colm Toibin in The London Review of Books called it \\"brilliantly perceptive\\", and the London Independent called it \\"endlessly illuminating\\". In 1997 it received the Randy Shilts Award for Gay Non-Fiction from the Publishing Triangle. He has written reviews and articles for, among others, Harper's Magazine, The New York Times Book Review, The Nation, Truthdig, The New Yorker, Dimensions, The Village Voice, The Daily Beast, The Believer, Los Angeles Times Book Review, Black Women in America, and The Encyclopedia of New York City. Heilbut's The Fan Who Knew Too Much, a collection of cultural essays published by Alfred A. Knopf in 2012, ranges from Thomas Mann to the gay and lesbian influence on gospel music.https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/review-of-anthony- heilbuts-the-fan-who-knew-too-much/2012/08/01/gJQAtfvHUX_story.html The book has won the \\"Deems Taylor ASCAP Award\\", and was chosen by Lorin Stein, editor of the Paris Review, as one of his seven recommended books of 2012. The book was released in paperback by Soft Skull Press in fall 2013. He has appeared in several documentaries including Rejoice and Shout (2011) and Sister Rosetta Tharpe: The Godmother of Rock and Roll (2011). Producer Heilbut is well known as a record producer. He has produced anthologies of jazz, country music, white gospel, and even opera (50 Great Moments in Opera has sold over 700,000 albums), but his specialty is black gospel music. Among his productions, How I Got Over (Columbia) by Mahalia Jackson has won a Grammy Award; Prayer Changes Things (Atlantic) by Marion Williams has won a Grand Prix du Disque; and Precious Lord: The Great Gospel Songs of Thomas A. Dorsey (Sony) was the first gospel album to be included in the Library of Congress' National Directory. He has produced albums for many labels. Since 1987 he has been the president, sole producer, literary editor, and janitor of Spirit Feel Records, which is distributed by Shanachie Records. He jokes that the critical reception has been \\"as full-throated as a gospel solo.\\" Ten Spirit Feel albums have received five-star reviews from Rolling Stone. The magazine even called Marion Williams, Heilbut's most heralded artist, \\"the greatest singer ever.\\" Thanks largely to her recordings for Spirit Feel, Williams received both the MacArthur Genius Award and the Kennedy Center Honor in 1993, tragically just a few months before her death. Other gospel acts Heilbut has produced include The Dixie Hummingbirds, Professor Alex Bradford, Dorothy Love Coates, Bessie Griffin, Reverend Claude Jeter, R. H. Harris, Inez Andrews, The Roberta Martin Singers, Sallie Martin, J. Robert Bradley, Robert Anderson, Willie Mae Ford Smith, The Stars of Faith and Delois Barrett Campbell. He says \\"it has been the thrill of my lifetime to work with my singing idols.\\" He has also produced reissues and career overviews of Edna Gallmon Cooke, The Fairfield Four, and his good friend Sister Rosetta Tharpe. He has written close to one hundred liner notes. In 2010 he produced a combination CD/DVD, How Sweet It Was: The Sights and Sounds of Traditional Gospel. In 2011 he annotated and co-produced Aretha Franklin The Great American Songbook. Spirit Feel albums have not sold well. The famous photographer David Gahr once quipped, \\"I never heard of a label getting such great reviews and selling so few records.\\" But the outlook is not totally bleak. In 2005, after Marion Williams album Remember Me was released, Heilbut was interviewed by Michele Norris on National Public Radio, and overnight, the album soared to #16 on amazon.com. Williams' Spirit Feel recordings, produced by Heilbut, have been featured in several films, most famously Fried Green Tomatoes and Mississippi Masala, as well as in the video game Scene It; as recently as January 2020 one was included in a Netflix film directed by Tyler Perry. That same month a Spirit Feel recording of Bessie Griffin was sampled in a Beyoncé commercial. And in April 2020, Bruce Springsteen compiled a 20-song tribute to the victims of the COVID-19 coronavirus, which included Marion Williams’ Trouble So Hard -- a track Heilbut composed and produced in 1990. Heilbut is an atheist.\\"People are amazed that a German Jewish atheist would be supposedly the world's expert on gospel music.\\" Anthony Heilbut interviewed by Barney Hoskyns, \\"The gospel according to Anthony\\", The Independent (London), June 24, 1996, Arts; Pg. 26.

It would be more aptly described today as an individual mobility association since it looks more broadly at all transport options ensuring individual mobility. Its seat is in Munich. The object of ADAC is “the representation, promotion and advocacy of motoring, motorsport and tourism interests.”ADAC Articles of Association (PDF; 193.16 kB). In: Impressum (Legal notice) ADAC e.V. Retrieved July 21, 2020/scroll down for English version of the Articles of Association. Its original and most well-known service is roadside assistance. The club also offers other products and services – directly or through subsidiaries, distributes city maps, road maps and road atlases and operates several driver safety centres. It works together closely with its Austrian counterpart ÖAMTC. Via its charitable subsidiary ADAC Luftrettung gGmbH, ADAC operates the largest fleet of ambulance helicopters in Germany. In 2019, the ADAC helicopters started into approx. 54,000 missions. ADAC is one of 78 select associations and federations in Germany eligible to bring test actions for declaratory judgment (Musterfeststellungsklage).  The work of ADAC  According to its Article of Association, ADAC’s responsibilities lie in the “representation, promotion and advocacy of motoring, motor sport (...) interests” and is dedicated to the progress of road traffic, road safety, road safety education and tourism and the protection of the road users their rights as consumers. Overview Both the ADAC, and its older rival AvD (the organizer of the German Grand Prix), are members of the FIA and the DMSB. The European Grand Prix, the former ADAC Eifelrennen, the 24 Hours Nürburgring and many other races are hosted by ADAC. The ADAC also operates a large fleet of mobile mechanics in yellow cars that assist motorists in trouble - the Yellow Angels. The ADAC runs its own modification center whereby ordinary vans are turned into mobile garages (pictures only depict Ford Galaxies) in 55 man- hours. In addition to this, the ADAC provides 55 air ambulance helicoptersfor urgent medical rescues in Germany, strategically placed so that any location can be reached within 15 minutes. Air ambulance jets are used by the ADAC to rescue their members with a \\"PLUS\\" membership or customers who own an ADAC international travel insurance from any location worldwide in the case of accident or extreme sickness. The ADAC also offers its membership to non German residents, having signed contracts with automobile clubs worldwide. In the UK, it is possible to have breakdown recovery through the local AA while having an ADAC membership. The ADAC is publisher of the magazine with one of the largest distribution in Germany, ADAC Motorwelt . The magazine is distributed four times a year to ADAC members containing features articles of common interest to all participants of public traffic, such as product tests, safe driving tips and also places to visit by car or motorbike. On June 3, 2008, the ADAC suspended its involvement with the FIA over the scandal surrounding Max Mosley and his subsequent retention as FIA president.  Organisation  ADAC is an Idealverein, an association with idealistic objectives , aligning its activities not along commercial objectives but along the interests and needs of its members. In the course of 2016, ADAC realigned its organisation. ADAC now has a 3-pillar structure comprising an association (ADAC e.V.), a Societas Europaea (ADAC SE) and a foundation (ADAC Stiftung). This structure had been adopted by the vote of 200 delegates during an extraordinary General Assembly in late 2014. The structure was finalised in detail during 2015. At the 2016 ADAC General Assembly in Lübeck, the delegates agreed to the reorganised structure. Organised as an association with idealistic objectives, ADAC e.V. provides core membership benefits such as roadside assistance and legal services, and is the home of functions such as consumer advocacy, motorsport, tourism and the club magazine ADAC Motorwelt. Commercial activities have been devolved to an autonomous public company limited by shares (ADAC SE), separate of the association. ADAC e.V. holds a 57.74% majority of the ADAC SE shares. Other shareholders include the ADAC foundation (25.10%) and – via private equity companies – several ADAC regional clubs (17.16%). The ADAC foundation is the third pillar in the ADAC structure (with ADAC e.V. and ADAC SE). The foundation pools ADAC’s charitable and for public benefit activities. The foundation’s objectives are aligned with those of ADAC e.V. They include the promotion and support of rescue in life- threatening situations, accident prevention, scholarship & research, education and charity. The 3-pillar structure was fully implemented by early 2017. = General Assembly = The ADAC General Assembly convenes annually. Every four years, it elects the members of the ADAC Committee. The General Assembly is composed of the delegates of the regional clubs, the members of the ADAC Administrative Council and the Committee. One delegate represents 100,000 regional club members (or fraction thereof). By unanimous vote, the Committee may bestow honorary membership on persons from Germany or abroad in recognition of special merits in the cause of motoring. They enjoy the same rights and privileges as regular members. In an extraordinary General Assembly on December 6, 2014, August Markl was elected ADAC President. Over 200 delegates at the General Assembly at Nürburgring in May 2019 voted Ulrich Klaus Becker (Vice President), Karsten Schulze (Technical Services President) and Gerhard Hillebrand (Transport President ) to their offices. Jens Kuhfuß was confirmed in the office of Finance President. With President August Markl, Hermann Tomczyk (ADAC Sport President), Kurt Heinen, Tourism President, they form the newly constituted seven-strong ADAC Committee. The extraordinary General Assembly in Munich in November 2019 adopted a new Premium membership which adds numerous features to the existing Plus membership. At this time, the membership fees for the available membership models were adjusted. This General Assembly also adopted generally amended Articles of Association. The aim of the amendments was to better differentiate between the club’s executive and advisory bodies and convey a clear assignment of responsibilities. = ADAC Administrative Council = The ADAC Administrative Council is composed of the members of the Committee and the 18 chairmen of the Regional Clubs or their deputies in the Regional Club Boards. Decisions of the Administrative Council are binding on all Regional Clubs. = ADAC Committee = The non- remunerated seven-strong ADAC Committee is elected by the General Assembly as defined in the Articles of Association of ADAC e.V (federal organisation). The Committee’s speaker is the ADAC President. The acting ADAC President is August Markl. The term of office of the Committee members is four years. They may be re-elected. Committee meetings are attended by the Chief Legal Adviser (currently Christian Reinicke, lawyer and notary public, elected in 2016). = Management and Executive Board = The ADAC e.V. Executive Board is the remunerated executive body, responsible for the club’s management. The ADAC e.V. Executive Board is composed of Dieter Nirschl, Lars Soutschka and Oliver Weissenberger. Marion Ebentheuer, Mahbod Asgari and Jörg Helten are the ADAC SE Executive Board Members. Andrea David is the Executive Director of the ADAC foundation. = ADAC e.V.: Business year 2018 = At the end of 2018, ADAC e.V. had 20.72 million members. The trend continued upward in the first months of 2019. End of April 2019 the number of ADAC members stood at 20.84 million. Despite rising membership, the receipts from membership fees do not cover the expenditure for assistance services such as roadside repair. In 2018, the result for membership benefits was -24.7 million EUR, up from -26.9 million the year before. ADAC’s future proficiency programme and improved efficiency address and counteract this negative development. The aim is to break even for membership benefits by the 2020 year end. Due to extraordinary expense items, the ADAC e.V. earnings for the year 2018 stood at 759.4 million EUR. This includes a distribution from ADAC SE capital reserves to ADAC e.V., profit from the sale of ADAC e.V. shares in ADAC SE to ADAC regional clubs and a payment of Regional club arrears for higher roadside assistance costs due to the application of insurance premium tax. After adjustment of these extraordinary expense items, the annual result for 2018 was -7.9 million EUR, i.e. approx. on the same level as in 2017. = ADAC SE = Having its registered office in Munich, ADAC SE is a company limited by shares under EU law offering mobility-oriented services and products to ADAC members, non- members and B2B customers. It comprises 28 affiliated companies and private equity firms including ADAC Versicherung AG (insurance), ADAC Finanzdienste GmbH (financial services), ADAC Autovermietung GmbH (car rental) and ADAC Service GmbH (vehicle-related services). A growth-oriented market player, ADAC SE progresses digital transformation across all its businesses relying on innovation and sustainable technologies. As part of its company object – the holding of interests in companies and the provision of business support services – ADAC SE also manages its subsidiaries’ shares in its possession. ADAC e.V. holds a 57.74% majority of the ADAC SE shares. Other shareholders include the ADAC foundation (25.10%) and – via private equity companies – several ADAC regional clubs (17.16%).  Affiliation  ADAC is affiliated to the following organisations: * FIA, the international automobile federation * FIVA, the international historic vehicles federation * Euro NCAP, a crash test consortium * Pro Mobilität, a Berlin-based lobbying organisation promoting the expansion and maintenance of the road network * Network European Movement Germany * EuropeNet24 (Europe-wide breakdown assistance for HGVs) History Founded on May 24, 1903 at the then Hotel Silber (hist. building) in Stuttgart, ADAC was originally named Deutsche Motorradfahrer-Vereinigung (German Motorcyclist Association) and re-named Allgemeiner Deutscher Automobil-Club (ADAC) in 1911. The Prussian eagle was selected as the emblem in the club’s badge in appreciation of the Prussian royal family’s support and patronage. Its most senior figure at the time was German Emperor and King of Prussia Wilhelm II. The ADAC break-down assistance service was launched in Germany in 1927. After 1933, in the process of Nazification – a.k.a. Gleichschaltung – of German society, the Nazis amalgamated all motoring organisations in Germany in the DDAC (Der Deutsche Automobil-Club e.V.), an umbrella association that was allowed to exist in the shadow of the NSKK (National Socialist Motor Corps). A DDAC appeal described the 1934 international Automobile Exhibition as a “show for the people” rather than an “exhibition for the more affluent bourgeois segment” of society. “Motoring for the people” (Volkskraftfahrt), it proclaimed, was more “in the spirit of the Führer”.Till Bastian: Das Jahrhundert des Todes (The century of death). Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, Göttingen 2000, , p. 101 (online) In 1954 Heinz Frölich became the first of (in that year) 56 ADAC patrolmen, equipped with a motorbike-sidecar combination, on which the side car consisted of a large compartment filled with tools and parts for roadside repairs. These original ADAC \\"Gelbe Engel\\" (\\"Yellow Angels\\") used \\"NSU Konsul\\" motorbikes. At the end of 1962 ADAC announced the retirement of their motor-bike-sidecar combinations which would be replaced by 40 appropriately equipped Volkswagen Beetles. Equipment on the new cars included a flashing roof-light, repair tools, a radio-based communication device, compressed air canisters, a spade and broom set, and a basic \\"doctor-kit\\" incorporating blood-plasma. In 1974 the organisation had 3.8 million members at a time when there were 19.0 million passenger cars registered in Germany: by 1990 membership had risen to 10.2 million, with 35.5 million passenger cars registered in the country, so that ADAC membership has grown more than twice as fast as national car ownership. Growth rates during the ensuing twenty years were greatly boosted by German reunification. May 2012 was when the organization welcomed its 18 millionth member, a further milestone being reached in May 2013 as the ADAC fitted out its 10,000th roadside assistance vehicle, a Volkswagen Touran, kitted out with several hundred different tools and replacement parts. In 1997, ADAC opened its new technical centre in Landsberg am Lech, Bavaria. At this site, 150 new cars are being tested and reviewed annually. In 2003, ADAC voiced criticism of the supervised driving at age 17 pilot in Lower Saxony and celebrated its 100th anniversary. The ADAC Stiftung “Gelber Engel” foundation was established in 2007. This foundation supports victims of road accidents in financial distress to help them regain their mobility. In addition, the foundation funds accident rescue and accident research initiatives and institutions. At the end of 2019 ADAC had 21.2 million members.  Administrative headquarters  Except for its first two years of existence, ADAC has had its seat and headquarters in Munich. For the longest period of time the address was Am Westpark 8. That office building had finally become too small and was torn down in mid-2012. The new building is a 93-metre office tower (initial design by architects Sauerbruch Hutton) in the borough of Sendling at Hansastrasse 19, built for approx. €350 million. ADAC staff started moving into the new facilities in December of 2011. The building was officially inaugurated on March 22, 2012. A tower rísing to 23-stories, of which 5 stories make up the star-shaped plinth section, it has 125,000sqm of usable floor area. The tower shares the grounds with a historic landmark building in the foreground. The Sander Villa is now known as the ADAC club house. It houses the ADAC library and several other collections and is used for meetings and conferences.  ADAC road patrol  The primary service provided by ADAC is roadside assistance. The ADAC road patrol dates back to 1928, when the ADAC-Straßen- Hilfsdienst (roadside assistance service) was established. Back then, the patrols used sidecar motorcycles. After World War II, during which ADAC was forced to stop operations, the provision of breakdown assistance services was resumed by establishing the ADAC Straßenwacht (road patrol) in 1954. In 1990, the road patrol started covering the New Länder. In 1951, ADAC also started to organise assistance outside Germany. ADAC operates a fleet of more than 1,700 yellow road patrol vehicles (yellow angels). In the 1960s and 1970s, the yellow Beetles were a fixture on German roads. Today, ADAC deploys MPVs, each carrying up to 290kg of equipment ranging from the right tools for any situation to a digital diagnostic tool to small parts and replacement batteries. In the case of a car breakdown, members can request assistance over the phone or emergency roadside telephone on the motorway, over the Internet or via smartphone app: A dispatcher at one of the five breakdown assistance centres takes down the necessary data and forwards them to the next available road patrol. The road patrol driver will call the member several minutes before arrival. ADAC also provides Europe-wide breakdown assistance for HGVs. In Germany, ADAC uses special breakdown assistance vehicles for HGVs. In other European countries, ADAC partners provide assistance. In 2019, the road patrols and ADAC mobility partners were dispatched in 3.7 million cases, i.e. almost 10,300 times a day. In keeping with the previous years, the breakdowns were usually due to problems with the automotive battery, the most frequent breakdown cause at nearly 42%.  Lobbying and public relations  ADAC is among Germany's most influential associations and one of the biggest lobbying associations worldwide. Public relations activities focus on topics such as maintaining motorised mobility, preventing speed limits, traffic law and fines, the safety of tunnels and car ferries as well as road safety education. In recent years, ADAC has developed a growing interest for other transport operators and modes, for instance, by conducting tests on local public transport and urban cycling. ADAC regularly issues press releases and publishes the ADAC Motorwelt club magazine to inform its approx. 21.2m members. In 2020, the ADAC Motorwelt has become a quarterly publication (four issues per year). In the first quarter of 2020, the Burda affiliate BCN started to handle everything from production and printing to editorial services to marketing to distribution of the ADAC Motorwelt; the mobility club continues to be its publisher, and editor-in-chief Martin Kunz continues to oversee the content. At the same time, ADAC enhances and expands its digital communication channels. Starting in 2020, the new ADAC Motorwelt is available at the ADAC local offices, travel agencies and driver safety locations as well as the EDEKA and Netto supermarkets. All members need to do to get a copy of the magazine is show their membership card.  Air medical services  ADAC Luftrettung gGmbH (established on November 25, 1981 as a regular German PLC or GmbH) with a staff of 190 operates 55 ambulance and intensive care helicopters. Of this fleet, two are EC 145, 28 EC 135 and 15 BK 117, stationed at 37 HEMS bases, two outside Germany. The organisation’s 2014 turnover was 90 million EUR. ADAC Luftrettung gGmbH is the largest civilian rotor-wing air medical organisation in Germany, followed by DRF Luftrettung. According to the pertinent register of companies, ADAC HEMS operations (ADAC-Luftrettung) were established on November 25, 1981 as a limited liability company (GmbH) named Arbeitskreis des ADAC zur Förderung der Luftrettung und zur Hebung der allgemeinen Verkehrssicherheit (ADAC-Luftrettung) Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung (ADAC working group to support air medical services and improve general road safety). On March 29, 2000, the organisation was renamed ADAC-Luftrettung GmbH and on August 26, 2013 ADAC Luftrettung gGmbH. In extension of its rotor-wing ambulance operations, ADAC holds shares in Aero- Dienst GmbH and is enabled to operate a small fleet of fixed-wing ambulance aircraft for mid-range medical repatriation: · 2 Dornier Fairchild 328-300JET · 1 Beechcraft King Air 350 · 1 Learjet 60  ADAC Stiftung „Gelber Engel“  The ADAC Stiftung „Gelber Engel“ gGmbH (yellow angel foundation) has been supporting the victims of road accidents since 2007. Its object is to provide assistance to people injured in road accidents. Its foundation capital is 10 million EUR. It is also used to fund research considered by ADAC to improve road safety. In September 2013, the foundation was registered as a gGmbH (charitable limited company under German law).  ADAC Stiftung Sport  ADAC Stiftung Sport is a foundation set up in 1998 to promote and support German racing talent. Young motor racers showing adequate potential are offered the opportunity to benefit from the support of experts and partners of the foundation. In addition to material backing, the grantees are also eligible to benefit from training and coaching in many fields. In addition, the foundation also devotes funds to increasing motor sport safety and supporting non- professional racers injured in accidents.  Tourism  ADAC offers a variety of tourism and travel-related information. This includes daily updates on travel-related topics in the Reise & Freizeit (travel & leisure) section of its website. ADAC tourist advice includes information on POI in the main holiday destinations, valuable details about the travel destination, rules of the road, toll roads, world-wide weather forecasts, travel and safety updates, mobility information related to city trips, material regarding the Carnet de Passages. Specialised information is available for the camping and boating communities. The ADAC tourism advisers also provide suggested tours for motorcyclists and drivers of historic vehicles. ADAC members may visit a local office to get their information and advice in person or access what they need on adac.de and specialised apps. ADAC champions automobile Tourism. In the course of German reunification, ADAC joined forces with the conservancy Schutzgemeinschaft Deutscher Wald (alliance for the protection of German forests) and the German tourism association Deutscher Tourismusverband to have the 2,500 kilometre Deutsche Alleenstraße tree-lined holiday route running the length of Germany designated.  Test & Technical Services  To bolster its means to conduct independent consumer protection research, ADAC established its own technical centre at Landsberg am Lech near Munich in 1997. This facility has given ADAC the capability of submitting vehicles, vehicle parts and accessories to technical tests revealing any safety-relevant flaws. Ever since, ADAC has conducted technical and mobility tests and published the test results in its media channels. Technical tests regularly include cars, tyres, child restraint systems, pedelecs, safety helmets and roof boxes etc. Of course, the ADAC test engineers look at new products such as wall boxes or e-scooters as soon as they become available. New technologies such as driver assistance systems all the way to autonomous driving are also under review as is data security in connected systems. ADAC mobility tests include consumer- oriented services and infrastructures testing, e.g. of intercity coach stations, charging infrastructures for e-vehicles, P&R; facilities, or the comparative pricing of public transport tickets. The majority of ADAC’s technical tests are conducted at its technical centre at Landsberg am Lech. The facilities include an exhaust gas testing lab and a crash-test facility. The German Federal Motor Transport Authority recognised these facilities as test labs as compliant with the DIN EN ISO/IEC 17025 standard. The testing operations are certified to ISO 9001:2015. Research ADAC is an active member for the European Road Assessment Program (EuroRAP) in Germany. ADAC regularly publishes maps showing safety characteristics of German roads. These maps based on EuroRAP's Road Protection Score Protocol (or Star Rating Protocol) is a measure of how well a road protects road users in the event of an accident. Data on road characteristics is gathered by driving through road inspections using a specially equipped RPS inspection vehicle (Straßentest in German). Trained assessors then rate the safety features and hazards on the inspected road and use standardised formula to produce a safety star rating, which is comparable across Europe. ADAC also undertakes road inspections on behalf of other EuroRAP members, including the Road Safety Foundation in the UK. Campaigning for Safe Road Design The European Campaign for Safe Road Design is a partnership between 28 major European road safety stakeholders that is calling for the EC to invest in safe road infrastructure initiatives which could cut deaths on European roads by 33% in less than a decade. ADAC is the campaign's partner in Germany.  Road safety  In expert events and articles, ADAC has taken position on issues such as road safety, transport law, transport policy and traffic planning as well as on environmental protection issues. In 2006, ADAC published a series of critical press releases on the issue of driving licence shopping – i.e. getting licensed in another country after having one's driving licence revoked in one’s home country – and advocated the speedy harmonisation of driver licensing in Europe. ADAC also offers driver safety training at 11 driver safety centres and 40 training facilities nationwide. The declared objective of the training is to increase driver confidence and make road users safer, raise awareness of critical situations and impart some theoretical instruction in vehicle technology. There are special car, motorcycle, van, bus and HGV training modules. Some ADAC positions are very controversial, questioning the benefit for road safety of some planned measures or rather implying the opposite. The club had argued its opposition to a general speed limit on German motorways by citing the finding that statistically the motorways are already the safest roads in Germany (in terms of accidents) and that a speed limit would not significantly reduce the severity of accidents. Supporters of a speed limit such as the Verkehrsclub Deutschland (VCD) argue that the measure would indeed reduce the risk and the severity of accidents and would help avoid motorway fatalities and severe injuries to the order of hundreds In the light of an ambivalent opinion both of the public at large and among ADAC members with regard to the implementation of a general speed limit on German motorways, ADAC will no longer make any recommendations to the policy makers on this issue. In fact, current studies and statistics had produced a very heterogeneous view on the effects of a speed limit both in respect of climate change mitigation and road safety.  Emergency key service  Since January 2019, ADAC members can call ADAC for assistance when they have locked themselves out of their homes. This is possible in a pilot project running in the urban areas of Munich, Berlin and Hamburg.  ADAC ridesharing club  The ADAC ridesharing club (Mitfahrclub) is a platform for ridesharing.  ADAC for the young generation  ADAC facilitates the young generation’s start into mobility and provides information on topics such as road safety, driver licensing, car buying etc. There are non-contributory membership models for youths, novice drivers and college and university students. Members in such schemes benefit from free practice with driving licence test questions, they can use breakdown and accident assistance and frontline legal advice.

Natural history At the end of the last ice-age boulders and clay moraine blocked off a tributary of the headwaters of the Arkansas River in what is now the state of Colorado. The two lakes which formed were named the \\"Twin Lakes\\" by the area's settlers. Both lakes held small greenback cutthroat trout from the early days of the Wild West, but in the mid-1880s reports circulated of much larger trout, up to in weight, with bright yellow fins. Discovery and naming In July 1889, Professor David Starr Jordan and G. R. Fisher visited Twin Lakes and published their discoveries in the 1891 Bulletin of the United States Fish Commission. They found both the greenback and what they proclaimed to be a new species the \\"yellowfin cutthroat\\". In the species description, published in the 1890 edition of the Proceedings of the United States National Museum,Jordan, David Starr and Evermann, Barton Warren. 1889. \\"Description of the yellow-finned trout of Twin Lakes, Colorado\\". Proceedings of the United States National Museum. Vol. XXI pages 453-454.Description of the yellow-finned trout of Twin Lakes, Colorado Jordan and Evermann described the fish as follows: > Color, silvery olive; a broad lemon yellow shade along the sides, lower fins > bright golden yellow in life, no red anywhere except the deep red dash on > each side of the throat. The subspecies was scientifically named macdonaldi after the US Fish Commissioner, Marshall McDonald. Jordan's specimens were re-examined by the fisheries biologist Robert J. Behnke, who commented, \\"I have no doubt that Jordan was correct; the yellowfin trout and the greenback trout from Twin Lakes were two distinct groups of cutthroat trout\\". Extinction Until about 1903, greenback and yellowfin cutthroats survived together in Twin Lakes, the populations remaining isolated as both breeders and feeders. The end for the yellowfin cutthroat came soon after the introduction of the rainbow trout to Twin Lakes. The greenback population interbred with the rainbows, resulting in cutbows, but the yellowfin disappeared completely. The yellowfin is now extinct.

Ziggy objects to being labelled as \\"homeless\\" as he chose his situation and does not ask for food, money or clothing and enjoys living in a public park. Ziggy gained press coverage in 2004, becoming a controversial issue in two consecutive local elections. Ziggy is well-known for tourists giving him ice cream. His favourite flavour is vanilla. Biography Despite the lack of information pertaining to his early life it is known that Zbigniew the umbrella man was born as Zbigniew Marian Wilczek in the early 1950s and was of a Polish nationality. His name was later changed to Tim Jenkins. While it is unknown when exactly he became homeless, he had been sighted in Jephson Street Toowong as early as 1989. He became known by the locals as either \\"Tim\\" or \\"Zbigniew\\". \\"Zbigniew the umbrella man\\" became his nickname throughout his ongoing media coverage. He entered public view in the year 2000 with the then Lord Mayor Jim Soorley protesting the complaints of several Toowong businesses requesting that he be removed on the grounds that he was bad for business and his low levels of hygiene attracted rats. Soorley claimed that he was completely within the law in his position. As he gained attention, he was in increased danger, with his small home being attacked several times by various groups demanding his removal from Toowong. His publicity only grew and since then has featured in local news reports several times. Early in 2004 he was the subject of \\"Operation Zbigniew\\", an effort by ABC presenter (from 612 AM) Spencer Howson to find him a home. After being interviewed on air, it was revealed that Zbigniew was not so willing to be a party to this scheme and so the plan collapsed. Later that year a portrait of him painted by local artist Bruce Chapman was entered in the Archibald Prize. His only requested payment was $8 worth of food, including ice cream, several biscuits and a bottle of soft drink. Zbigniew also gave an interview for a similar fee of $10.Interview with Zbigniew During July 2004, he is said to have had his first shower and his home became too messy by his own self-imposed rules; the police were called in to help clean up and Zbigniew promised to move by Christmas. He found a new spot in a local barbecue area, remaining in Toowong. After more attacks on him midway through 2005, new calls were made to have him taken off the streets, Lord Mayor Campbell Newman insists, just as his predecessor did, that Zbigniew is breaking no laws and will not be forced to move, despite Newman's personal hopes that he could be moved to a \\"proper place\\". In December 2005 his possessions were confiscated by police due to smell and vermin. In July 2006 Zbigniew moved on from his High Street location to a new spot at Oakman Park. Radio News reported that he moved because of attacks at his old location. He later moved to Toowong Creek. Zbigniew has most recently moved to a Taringa park between Morrow Street and Moggil Road.

It released two albums with RCA before breaking up in 1973. It's mostly known today as an early point in musician Doug Fieger's career, later the frontman of The Knack. History The group started out as their members finished high school in the Detroit, Michigan area. It consisted of Doug Fieger (bass, lead vocals), John Coury (guitar, backing vocals, keyboards), and Rob Stawinski (drums, backing vocals). Sky gained a local following after serving as an opening act for popular groups such as Jethro Tull, The Who, Joe Cocker, Bob Seger, and The Stooges. It also played with Traffic numerous times. The group put out two albums on RCA, 1970's Don't Hold Back and 1970's Sailor's Delight (both produced in England by the Rolling Stones' producer, Jimmy Miller). Their sound was country rock along the lines of The Grateful Dead's then current phase mixed with harmony and hard rock influences. Traffic also strongly influenced their style. Sky composed and performed the soundtrack music for Roger Corman's \\"Private Duty Nurses\\" in 1971, and appeared in the film as Sky, the band playing at Schlumpfelder's Bar.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067618/fullcredits/?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm Sky broke up shortly after their second album's release.

He initiated the beatification of Saint Olaf. On his return to England he became Bishop of Selsey and also for a time Bishop of Elmham. He was accused, by some, of being guilty of simony. Life Little is known of Grimketel's background.Barlow English Church 1000–1066 p. 76 The Norwegian Viking Olaf Haraldson spent several years in England supporting Æthelred the Unready against the Danish King Cnut. While in England Olaf was in contact with many Christians who seemed to have influenced him into converting to Christianity. Olaf was baptised at Notre-Dame, Rouen in 1012. When Olaf returned to Norway, with the intention of restoring power to his family, he took a group of English priests and advisors with him. One of his principle advisors was Grimketel. Olaf became King of Norway and Grimketel became the Bishop of Nidaros.Iversen Divine Office in the Latin Middle Ages pp. 401-405 Olaf and Grimketel proclaimed the earliest Norwegian church laws in about 1020 at the Moster þing.Sawyer Medieval Scandinavia p. 215 The structure of the law, devised by Grimketel, was similar to that of the laws in England at the time.Fernandez Alvarez and Manrique Anton \\"Anglo Saxon Influence\\" Multidisciplinary Studies pp. 44-47 Panel from Nidaros Cathedral showing Grimketel exhuming the body of Olaf and declaring him a saint. In 1028 an alliance of Olaf's countrymen and Cnut drove Olaf into exile. Cnut installed his son Swein as ruler with his mother Ælfgifu of Northampton.Lawson \\"Cnut\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Sigurd was installed as Bishop of Nidaros, in Grimketel's place. Then in 1030, Olaf returned from exile, and was killed by his country men at the Battle of Stiklestad while trying to reclaim his kingdom. However, after about a year the people of Norway rejected Swein and installed Olaf's son as king. Grimketel was asked to go to Nidaros and officially declare the former king a saint. Cnut is said to have brought Grimketel back to England. Grimketel then stayed at Canterbury until he was appointed Bishop of Selsey in late 1038 or in 1039. He was bishop of Selsey at the time Stigand was bishop of the see of Elmham. . Later authors claimed that Grimketel achieved the see of Selsey, as well as that of Elmham, through simony. There was a simple reference to this episode in the earlier recension of the Worcester Chronicle, which, according to the historian Susan Kelly, was later elaborated with some unreliable detail; the revised version states that Grimketel bought the Elmham see (the words pro auro, \\"for gold\\" have been substituted for pro eo, \\"for him\\") and that Stigand became bishop of Selsey, which Kelly feels is not credible.Kelly Charters of Selsey p. xciii According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle versions C, D, and E, Ælfric II, Bishop of Elmham died about Christmas 1038, and William of Malmesbury says that he was replaced by another Ælfric (Ælfric III), however in his chronicle, Florence of Worcester ignored Ælfric III, and has Stigand becoming Bishop of Elmham instead. He then records that Grimketel replaced Stigand at Elmham, when the latter was deposed in 1043. Grimketel's name was on two royal writs concerning Bury St Edmunds namely S. 1069 and S. 1070, that support his appointment as Bishop of Elmham.Whitlock Anglo Saxon Wills p. 182 The first writ (S. 1069) is known to be authentic and is dated around 1043, the second writ is thought to be spurious. Grimketel was then in turn deposed when Stigand was restored in 1044.Cowdray \\"Stigand\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Susan Kelly says that it is not clear whether there is justification for the rumours identifying Grimketel as a simonist; however, the historian Frank Barlow feels that he did purchase the office from King Harold Harefoot.Barlow English Church 1000–1066 p. 108 Grimketel died in 1047Fryde, et al.

Life  Edwin Lankester was born in 1814 in Melton, near Woodbridge in Suffolk, to 'poor but clever parents' according to his son E. Ray Lankester (Lester 1995). His father was a builder. Edwin married Phebe Pope in 1845, daughter of a former mill-owner. She was 19 at the time of marriage, became a botanist and microscopist, published books for children and wrote natural history articles. They had a total of eleven children of whom eight survived – four boys and four girls. Thomas Henry Huxley became a close friend of the family, and visited often. John Stevens Henslow, Darwin's tutor, was also a family friend. A born teacher, he introduced Edwin's son Ray to the delights of fossil collecting. Through his association with East Suffolk and his friendship with Henslow, Lankester became an early and active Honorary Member of the Ipswich Museum, of which his son Ray Lankester was afterwards President (1901–1929).Steven J. Plunkett, 'Ipswich Museum Moralities in the 1840s and 1850s', in C. Harper-Bill et al. (eds), East Anglia's History: Essays in Honour of Norman Scarfe (Boydell press with Centre of East Anglian Studies, Woodbridge 2002), 309–331. E. B. Ford, the ecological geneticist, said of Edwin: \\"Lankester was a close personal friend of Darwin's and was so deeply impressed by him that he was determined that one of his sons should become a great biologist, He named all three of his sons suitably: Forbes, Ray and Owen!\\" (p. 338 in Mayr and Provine). But, alas for this excellent story, Edwin had another son, his second, whom he named Rushton. Rushton emigrated to Java, married, and raised a family, the only one of Edwin's offspring to do so. The lack of productivity in this otherwise capable family was distinctly unusual at that time. Career Apprenticed at first to a Mr. Ginney, a surgeon of Woodbridge, in 1832 he became Assistant to Thomas Spurgin of Saffron Walden. Spurgin raised £300 to enable Edwin to study medicine and science from 1834–7 at the new University College London. He attended lectures by John Lindley (botany) and Robert Edmund Grant (zoology) – to whose post Edwin's eldest son E. Ray Lankester succeeded in 1875. Grant had been one of Darwin's tutors at Edinburgh. Edwin's friends at UCL included William Jenner and William Benjamin Carpenter. Edwin could not afford a complete degree course, so qualified as MRCS and Licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries. In 1837 he moved to Doncaster to become resident medical attendant and science tutor to the Woods family of Campsall Hall, recommended by Lindley. The Woods family were \\"indifferent to religion and fervent Owenites\\" as he mentioned in a letter home. Robert Owen actually visited Campsall Hall, and Lankester described the event in his diary. In 1839 Lankester left the Woods and travelled to Heidelberg to take his M.D., which he got in six months. Back in London, he befriended Edward Forbes and Arthur Henfrey, the botanist. He practised medicine and wrote articles on botany, medicine and surgery for the Penny Cyclopaedia. He contributed to the Biographical Dictionary, and wrote for other journals. As time went by, he became ever more fully absorbed in natural history. In 1841 his study of sulphur bacteria (then the 'glairine of sulphurous waters') was noteworthy, as was his microscopic examination of drinking water. His book the Aquavivarium (1856) had a great vogue. He co- founded the important Quarterly Journal of Microscopical Science (QJMS) in 1853, and co-edited it with George Busk, and later with his son Ray. Half- hours with the microscope (1857) was a best-seller, reprinted until 1918. Edwin Lankester was President of the British Association for 25 years, and the founder of the Biological Section of the BA. He was present at the infamous Wilberforce-Huxley encounter in 1860. He was the first Secretary of the Ray Society, with his wife as Assistant Secretary. In 1845 he was President of the Royal Microscopical Society, and that same year he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. Twenty years later he became the first President of the Quekett Microscopical Club. In addition, Lankester also served as coroner for Central Middlesex, succeeding the first medically qualified coroner to take up the position, Dr Thomas Wakley, in 1862. Dr. Lankester, like his predecessor, contributed greatly to our knowledge on the social problem of infanticide in nineteenth century Britain by producing a series of 'statistically detailed Annual Reports' on the phenomenon.Rose, Lionel 1986, Massacre of the Innocents: Infanticide in Great Britain 1800–1939 p. 62.  Cholera  The cause of London's cholera outbreaks had been identified by John Sutherland (1808–1891) and Dr John Snow (1813–1858; author of the famous map of water pumps near Broad Street). The matter was not decided until Lankester established a committee to look into the latest outbreak. The Committee's report (1854) had sections written by Snow and the Reverend Henry Whitehead, a local curate. They reached the conclusion that the outbreak was attributable to the use of impure water from the well in Broad Street. In 1866, twelve years after the event, Dr. Lankester wrote \\"The Board of Guardians met to consult what ought to be done. Of that meeting, the late Dr. Snow demanded an audience. He was admitted and gave it as his opinion that the pump in Broad Street, and that pump alone, was the cause of all the pestilence. He was not believed: not a member of his own profession, not an individual in the parish believed that Snow was right. But the pump was closed nevertheless and the plague was stayed.\\" Lankester later became the first Medical Officer of Health for the St. James's district, the area where the outbreak occurred. It still took years before the public authorities acted to ensure the purity of water supply; Snow had been dead for over 30 years when the Chief Medical Office of Health at last acknowledged that his work on the transmission of cholera was one of the most significant medical discoveries of the 19th century. Lankester's interest in this (beyond simple humanity) came through his microscopical examination of water, which is even today one of the standard tests of drinking water quality.

Challenging the ancient tradition that philosophy begins in wonder, Critchley argues that philosophy begins in disappointment. Two particular forms of disappointment inform Critchley's work: religious and political disappointment. While religious disappointment arises from a lack of faith and generates the problem of what is the meaning of life in the face of nihilism, political disappointment comes from the violent world we live in and raises the question of justice in a violently unjust world. In addition, to these two regions of research, Critchley's recent works have engaged in more experimental forms of writing on Shakespeare, Bowie, suicide, Greek tragedy and association football. Life and education Simon Critchley was born on 27 February 1960, in Hertfordshire, England, to a working-class family originally from Liverpool. He is a fan of Liverpool Football Club and has said that, it ‘maybe the governing passion of my life. My only religious commitment is to Liverpool Football Club.’ In grammar school, he studied history, sciences, languages (French and Russian) and English literature. During this time, he developed a lifelong interest in ancient history. After intentionally failing his school exams, Critchley worked a number of odd jobs, including in a pharmaceutical factory in which he sustained a severe injury to his left hand. During this time, he was a participant in the emerging Punk scene in England, playing in numerous bands that all failed. After studying for remedial 'O' and 'A' level exams at a community college while doing other odd jobs, Critchley went to university aged 22. He went to the University of Essex to study literature, but switched to philosophy.http://www.whatisitliketobeaphilosopher.com/simon-critchley Amongst his teachers were Jay Bernstein, Robert Bernasconi, Ludmilla Jordanova, Onora O’Neill, Frank Cioffi, Mike Weston, Roger Moss, and Gabriel Pearson. He also briefly participated in the Communist Students’ Society (where he first read Althusser, Foucault, and Derrida) as well as the Poetry Society. After graduating with First Class Honours and winning the Kanani Prize in Philosophy in 1985, Critchley went to the University of Nice where he wrote his M.Phil. on overcoming metaphysics in Heidegger and Carnap with Dominique Janicaud. His other teachers were Clement Rosset and André Tosel. In 1987, Critchley returned to the University of Essex to write his PhD, completed in 1988, which was to become the basis for The Ethics of Deconstruction. Critchley became a University Fellow at University College Cardiff in 1988. In 1989, he returned to the University of Essex as Lecturer and where he would become Reader in 1995 and Full Professor in 1999. During this time he serviced first as Deputy Director (1990–96) and then as Director (1997-2003) of the Centre for Theoretical Studies in the Humanities and Social Sciences. From 1998-2004, he was Directeur de Programme, College International de Philosophie. He has held visiting appointments at Johann Wolfgang Goethe Universität (1997–98, 2001), University of Nijmegen (1997), University of Sydney (2000), University of Notre Dame (2002), Cardozo Law School (2005), University of Oslo (2006) and University of Texas (2010). From 2009 to 2015, he ran a summer school at University of Tilburg. He is also a Professor of Philosophy at the European Graduate School. Since 2004, Critchley has been Professor of Philosophy at the New School for Social Research at which he became the Hans Jonas Professor of Philosophy in 2011. Since 2015, he has served on the board of the Onassis Foundation. Overview of philosophical work The Ethics of Deconstruction: Derrida and Levinas (1st ed., Blackwell, 1992; 2nd ed., Edinburgh University Press 1999; 3rd ed., EUP 2014) Since its original publication in 1992, The Ethics of Deconstruction has been an acclaimed work. Against the received understanding of Derrida as either a metaphysician with his own ‘infrastructure’ or as a value-free nihilist, Critchley argues that central to Derrida's thinking is a conception of ethical experience. Specifically, this conception of ethical experience must be understood in Levinasian terms in which the other calls into question one's ego, self-consciousness, and ordinary comprehension. Critchley argues that this Levinasian conception of ethical experience informs Derrida's deconstruction and develops the idea of clôtural reading. Very Little ... Almost Nothing: Death, Philosophy, Literature (Routledge, 1997/2nd expanded ed., Routledge 2004) Critchley's second monograph begins from the problem of religious disappointment, which generates the question of the meaning of life. Through a long preamble on nihilism, Critchley rejects the view that an affirmation of finitude can redeem the meaning of life. Instead, he argues that the ultimate mark of human finitude is that we cannot find meaning for the finite. Rather, for Critchley, an adequate response to nihilism consists in seeing meaninglessness as a task or achievement. Critchley then develops this thesis through discussions of Blanchot, Levinas, Cavell, German Romanticism, Adorno, Derrida, Beckett, and Wallace Stevens. Ethics-Politics-Subjectivity: Essays on Derrida, Levinas, & Contemporary French Thought (Verso, 1999) This collection brings together a number of previously published essays. Amongst these essays, Critchley discusses a variety of historical and contemporary figures (e.g., Hegel, Heidegger, Jean Genet, Derrida, Levinas, Richard Rorty, Laclau, Lacan, Jean- Luc Nancy, and Blanchot) as well as topics (e.g., politics, subjectivity, race (human categorization) in the Western philosophical canon, psychoanalysis, comedy, friendship, and others). Continental Philosophy: A Very Short Introduction (Oxford University Press, 2001) Critchley's Continental Philosophy: A Very Short Introduction sets out to establish three claims: (1) to demonstrate why Continental philosophy is a contested concept by looking at the history and meaning of the term as well as its relationship to analytic or Anglo-American philosophy; (2) to show how it can be understood as a distinct set of philosophical traditions that cover a range of problems; and (3) to argue that a more promising future for philosophy is to talk about philosophy as such without such professional squabbles between Continental and Anglo- American philosophy. Critchley defends these claims through discussions of such figures as Kant, Fichte, Hegel, Nietzsche, Husserl, Heidegger, Carnap, and others as well as such topics as the relationship between knowledge and wisdom, literature, science, politics, and nihilism. On Humour (Routledge, 2002) In On Humour, Critchley explores the central yet peculiar role that humour, jokes, laughter, and smiling play in human life. Specifically, he defends the two-fold claim that humour both (1) engages our shared practices and mutual attunement with one another, while also (2) challenging those very social practices and sensibilities, showing how they might be transformed and become otherwise then they presently are. Things Merely Are: Philosophy in the poetry of Wallace Stevens (Routledge, 2005) In Things Merely Are, Critchley argues for two claims: (1) that Wallace Stevens's poetry affords significant and illuminating philosophical insights and (2) that the best way to express such insights is poetically. Specifically, Critchley argues that Stevens's poetry offers readers a novel take on the relationship between mind, language and material things, which overcomes modern epistemology. The book also offers an extended engagement with the cinema of Terrence Malick. Infinitely Demanding: Ethics of Commitment, Politics of Resistance (Verso, 2007) Addressing the topic of political disappointment, Critchley argues for a conception of ethical experience and subjectivity. Challenging the modern Kantian association of ethics and autonomy, Critchley argues for a ‘hetero- affective’ conception of ethical experience in which the subject is split between herself and a moral demand, which she experiences and yet cannot entirely fulfill. From this picture, Critchley develops an account of the experience of conscience before reflecting on the relationship between one's conscience and political action. The book argues for an ethical informed neo- anarchism. The Book of Dead Philosophers (Granta Books, 2008 and Vintage, 2009) The Book of Dead Philosophers begins from the assumption that contemporary human life is not defined by a fear of death, but a terror of annihilation and what awaits us after death. Rejecting any escape from our death in either mindless accumulation of wealth or a metaphysical sanctuary, Critchley follows Cicero in exploring the view that ‘to philosophize is the learn how to die’. To that end, Critchley discusses the deaths (and lives) of philosophers ranging from Thales and Plato to Confucius and Avicenna (Ibn Sina), from Princess Elizabeth of Bohemia and Hegel to Heidegger and Frantz Fanon. On Heidegger's Being and Time (Routledge, 2008) On Heidegger’s Being and Time presents two ways of approaching Heidegger's text. Reiner Schürmann’s contribution reads Heidegger ‘backward’ from the later work to the earlier Being and Time. Alternatively, Critchley reads Heidegger ‘forward’ through Heidegger's inheritance of phenomenology. In his contribution, Critchley goes on to question the Heidegger's conception of inauthentic/authentic. How to Stop Living and Start Worrying: Conversations with Carl Cederström (Polity, 2010) How to Stop Living and Start Worrying consists of a series of interviews between Critchley and Carl Cederström based on a Swedish TV series. Here Critchley discusses his life and work through the themes of life, philosophy, death, love, humour, and authenticity. Impossible Objects (Polity, 2012) Impossible Objects is a series of interviews between Critchley conducted between 2000 and 2011. Critchley discusses his own work and development through a variety of topics (e.g., deconstruction, nihilism, politics, the literary, punk, tragedy, and more). The Faith of the Faithless: Experiments in Political Theology (Verso, 2012) In The Faith of the Faithless, Critchley rethinks faith as a political concept without succumbing to the temptations of the atheistic dismissal of faith or the theistic embrace of faith. To that end, Critchley discusses Rousseau, Badiou, St. Paul, Heidegger, and others. He also defends his view of nonviolence from Zizek’s criticism. Stay, Illusion! The Hamlet Doctrine (Pantheon, 2013) Co-authored with Jamieson Webster, Stay, Illusion! draws on various readings of Hamlet (e.g., Carl Schmitt, Walter Benjamin, Hegel, Freud, Lacan, and Nietzsche) with the aim of using this collection of interpretations to offer a close and compelling reading of Hamlet. The Problem with Levinas (Oxford University Press, 2015) Through four lectures, Critchley reflects on five questions concerning Levinas: (1) what method might we follow in reading Levinas?; (2) what is Levinas’ fundamental problem?; (3) what is the shape of that problem in his early writings?; (4) what is Levinas’ answer to that problem?; and (5) is Levinas’ answer the best available answer? The book attempts to give a heterodox reading of Levinas's work and a new understanding of its importance. ABC Of Impossibility (Univocal, 2015) ABC of Impossibility consists of fragments from an allegedly abandoned work, which largely date from 2004-06. The initial project was to develop a theory of impossible objects that would take the form of alphabetized entries. These entries would deal with various phenomena, concepts, qualities, places, sensations, persons and moods. Bowie (OR Books, 2014; Expanded Edition – Serpent’s Tail, 2016) In Bowie, Critchley discusses the influence David Bowie’s music has had on him throughout his life as well as reflects on the philosophical depth of Bowie's work. It is very much a fan's book that attempts to confer the appropriate aesthetic dignity on Bowie's work through a careful analysis of his lyrics and the exploration of themes of inauthenticity, isolation, truth and the longing for love. Memory Theatre (Fitzcarraldo, 2014) Memory Theatre is a semi-fictional autobiographical story about the art of memory inspired by the work of Frances Yates and Adolfo Bioy Casares, but at its core is a concern with memory in relation to Hegel’s Phenomenology of Spirit. It is concerned with the building of a memory theatre, the delusive attempt to control one's relation to mortality and the progressive dismantling of the standard image of the philosopher. Notes on Suicide (Fitzcarraldo, 2015) Against the prevailing tendency to either moralize against suicide or glorified self-murder, Critchley defends suicide as a phenomenon that should be thought about seriously and soberly. To that end, Critchley examines numerous suicides and reflects on the increase of suicide in our society. What We Think When We Think About Football (Profile Books/Penguin, 2017) Critchley argues that football occupies a particular place in society in that it at once originates from sociality and solidarity (e.g., that many teams formed from local churches or various community groups; the relation between a team and fans), while also being completely consumed by money, capital, and the dissolution and alienation of social life. It is an attempt to write a poetics of football. Tragedy, the Greeks, and Us (Pantheon/Profile Books, 2019) In Tragedy, the Greeks, and Us, Critchley argues that tragedy articulates a philosophical orientation that challenges the traditional authority of philosophy by giving voice to what is contradictory, constricting, and limiting about human beings. In developing tragedy's philosophy, he turns to the ancient sophist Gorgias and the sophistical practice of antilogia, which examines both sides of an issue so as to make the weaker argument appear stronger. In addition to Gorgias, Critchley discusses Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Plato, Aristotle, and others. Apply-degger (Onasis Foundation, 2020) Apply-degger is a long-form, deep dive into the most important philosophical book of the last 100 years. Each episode of this podcast series will present one of the key concepts in Heidegger’s philosophy. Taken together, the episodes will lay out the entirety of Heidegger project for people who are curious, serious and interested, but who simply don’t have the time to sit down and read the 437 densely-written pages of the book. It is our hope that this series will show how Heidegger’s thinking might be applied to one’s life in ways which are illuminating, elevating and beneficial. Apply- degger is available for free as an audiobook on the Onasis Youtube channel as well as iTunes, Stitcher, and Spotify. Other work The Stone: Since 2010, Critchley has moderated The Stone in The New York Times, writing many essays himself. Contributions have included such thinkers as Linda Martín Alcoff, Seyla Benhabib, Gary Gutting, Philip Kitcher, Chris Lebron, Todd May, Jason Stanley, Peter Singer, and many others. The forum has been extremely popular and generated two collections of essays, co-edited by Critchley and Peter Catapano: The Stone Reader: Modern Philosophy in 133 Arguments (W.W. Norton & Co., 2015) and The Stone Reader: Modern Ethics in 77 Arguments (W.W. Norton & Co., 2017). International Necronautical Society (INS): Together with writer Tom McCarthy, Critchley is a founding member of the INS and serves as Head Philosopher. In its founding manifesto (1999), the First Committee of the INS declared (1) that death is a space, which INS intends to explore and inhabit; (2) that there is no beauty without death; (3) that the task of INS is to bring death out into the world; and (4) that the chief aim is to construct a means of conveying us into death. The founding manifesto as well as a number of other documents can be found in The Mattering of Matter: Documents from the Archive of the International Necronautical Society (2013). Critchley and Simmons: Critchley is a part of the band Critchley and Simmons with John Simmons. They have released four albums: Humiliation (2004); The Majesty of the Absurd (2014); Ponders End (2017); and Moderate or Good, Occasionally Poor (2017). Their music is available on Spotify, iTunes, and Soundcloud. Guardian Commentary on Heidegger's Being and Time: In 2009, Critchley wrote a series of articles for The Guardian. Debate with Slavoj Zizek: Critchley engaged in a public debate with Zizek. In response to Infinitely Demanding (2007), Zizek's review (London Review of Books, 2007) challenged Critchley's argument that a politics of resistance should not reproduce the violence sovereignty such a politics opposes. Critchley responded to Zizek's objection in Naked Punch and his own The Faith of the Faithless (2012).

Literary career Blackman is involved in the North American goth, spoken word and transgressive literature scenes. Blackman self-published three now out-of-print chapbooks: Pretty, Sweet, and Nice, and were collected in Akashic Books' Blood Sugar. Her work as a performance artist include \\"Bloodwork\\" performed at The Kitchen/NYC in 2000, where she debuted her blood performance (and shook hands with the audience, bloodying them too), slipped secret messages into the audience's coat pockets, projected text on the street and created audio visual installations. Since then she has performed \\"Courtesan Tales\\" at PS122 art space in New York City, at The Andy Warhol Museum/Pittsburgh, and for three years at the Fierce Festival in Birmingham England. The \\"Courtesan Tales\\" are performances in which a blindfolded audience of one has a five-minute story whispered into their ear. She debuted \\"Harm's Way\\" (a multi-media performance of her email diary of working at Ground Zero) as a work in progress in New York. After being commissioned for an audio work, \\"Stay Away from Lonely Places,\\" by the British Arts Council for the UK's Art & Architecture Week in July 2006., she was again commissioned by the BAC to create a new work for the Fierce Festival—an audio tour of the Deritend neighborhood of Birmingham. Blackman also created the piece Beloved, commissioned by the Fierce Festival and British Arts Council as a site-specific performance and installation. The piece was created expressly for the Compton Verney Museum in the British West Midlands in April 2007. She is also a voice-over performer, and has been used in campaigns for Chrysler, Ford, Blockbuster, Lysol, and Verizon, and channels including Turner Classic Movies, Discovery Health Channel, Cartoon Network, Court TV, PBS and Cinemax. Music career Some of Blackman's poems have been recorded. Her first recording was a 7\\" single from Cleveland label Carcrashh (sic). Both tracks were recorded by Kramer (Bongwater, Shimmy Disc records). Some have been reworked into lyrics, most notably on The Golden Palominos' 1996 album Dead Inside, for which she wrote all the lyrics and did vocals on all eleven songs. Her vocal style leans more toward spoken word/chant rather than traditional pop music singing. She collaborated with Alan Wilder's Recoil project on Mute Records. She contributed to Recoil's 2000 Liquid album. Blackman opened on the 1995 U.S. Beat By Beat tour for KMFDM, and her piece \\"Indictment\\" was later re-recorded as \\"Dogma\\" on KMFDM's Xtort album (Wax Trax!/TVT). She was a featured spoken word performer at Lollapalooza in 1994, collaborated with Scanner, John Van Eaton, and Mark Blasquez in Europe, where she opened at festivals for Nick Cave in Belgium and Placebo in the Netherlands. She's also done a number of small tours for her spoken word performances in the U.S. and Europe. She refers to her style of spoken word as \\"broken word,\\" and in the late 1990s, she appeared frequently on Liza Richardson's \\"Man in the Moon\\" spoken word show on KCRW in Santa Monica. She is frequently invited to perform and teach at poetry workshops around the world.

Its average length was 30 cm (12 inches) and it was about 1.0 kilogram (2.2 pounds) in weight. Occurring only in Lakes Huron and Michigan, and inhabiting waters between 50 and 150 metres deep, it was difficult to distinguish from other ciscoes and was possibly the same species as the shortjaw cisco (Coregonus zenithicus). The deepwater cisco was distinguished by usually having fewer than 33 gill rakers, relatively long pectoral fins, and unpigmented jaws. It was a silvery colour with a pink or purple lustre and a green or blue back. It spawned in August and September, earlier than most other ciscoes. Not much is known about its specific behaviors. Its diet consisted of Mysis relicta, fingernail clams, and various aquatic insects. Because of its large size, the deepwater cisco was heavily fished commercially. The main reasons for its extinction was a combination of competition from the invasive alewife, predation by the introduced sea lamprey, and commercial fishing on the Great Lakes.  Commercial Fishing in 1930s  Part of the reason for the lack of information on this species could be attributed to the commercial fishing during the early 1930s, before deep water species were properly analysed. The deepwater cisco was abundant before the 1900s as, before large-scale commercial fishing commenced in Lake Michigan, the larger ciscoes had no natural predators. It was not until the 1930s that the species was subject to commercial fishing exploitation. The deepwater cisco, also known as chubs in fishing terms, was prized for its larger-than-normal size. During this exploitation, the numbers of this species declined dramatically. The last deepwater cisco specimens were recorded in Lake Michigan in 1951 and Lake Huron in 1952. The species was declared extinct shortly after. When a re-evaluation was conducted in several states bordering Lake Michigan in the 1960s, there were no identifiable specimens of the deepwater cisco in any of the samplings. This served to confirm its extinction, caused by a combination of commercial fishing and invasive predators such as the sea lamprey. References * Smith S.H. 1964.

It was founded in 1980 with a mission to 'help create a society that protects and promotes quality of life and human dignity for all' by means of ethical banking. Triodos Bank finances companies which it believes add cultural value and benefit both people and the environment. That includes companies in the fields of solar energy, organic farming or culture. As of 2020, Triodos Bank has 721,000 customers worldwide.  History  The name Triodos is derived from the Greek \\"τρὶ ὁδος - tri hodos,\\" meaning \\"three roads\\" (people, planet, profit). The bank was founded as an anthroposophical initiative and continues to honor the work of Rudolf Steiner as the inspiration for its approach to banking.Triodos Bank, Articles of Association 2017https://www.triodos.com/downloads/about-triodos-bank/corporate- governance/articles-of-association-triodos-bank.pdf In 1980 Triodos launched the first \\"green fund\\", a fund for environmentally friendly projects, on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange. Friends of the Earth in the Netherlands claims that transferring 10,000 euros in savings from a \\"climate laggard\\" such as ABN Amro to Triodos will effectively result in a carbon dioxide emissions saving equivalent to what would be achieved by not driving a car for six months. The bank compensates 100% of its own CO2 emissions. Triodos took over the British ethical bank Mercury Provident in 1994.Paul Gosling, \\"Ethical banks to merge\\", The Independent, 30 January 1994 The bank operations and customer relations are mainly based on the web, but adapt to local customs. In Spain, for example, physical offices are preferred by the clients and therefore several commercial offices have been opened in the major towns.  Policy  Savers can open conventional savings accounts, as well as ethical funds and venture capital. Triodos also offer conventional personal current accounts and business banking services. Triodos also has an active international department, supporting microfinance initiatives across the developing world. Triodos is the only commercial bank in the UK to provide an annual list of all the loans the bank has made. Triodos Bank maintains the following policy concerning the financial activities and investments: = Criteria for lending = Triodos is unusual in that it only lends to businesses and charities judged to be of social or ecological benefit. This \\"positive screening\\" extends its policies beyond those of ethical banks which solely avoid investing in companies judged to be doing harm (\\"negative screening\\"). The bank uses money deposited by close to 100,000 savers and lends it to hundreds of organisations, such as fair trade initiatives, organic farms, cultural and arts initiatives, renewable energy projects, and social enterprises. \\"[Triodos] does not lend to organisations, businesses and projects that are directly involved for more than 5% of its activities in non-sustainable products and services or non-sustainable working processes.

A chamois hunter and collector of crystals, Balmat completed the first ascent of Mont Blanc with physician Michel-Gabriel Paccard on 8 August 1786. For this feat, King Victor Amadeus III gave him the honorary title du Mont Blanc. Balmat and Paccard's ascent of Mont Blanc was a major accomplishment in the early history of mountaineering. C. Douglas Milner wrote \\"The ascent itself was magnificent; an amazing feat of endurance and sustained courage, carried through by these two men only, unroped and without ice axes, heavily burdened with scientific equipment and with long iron- pointed batons. The fortunate weather and a moon alone ensured their return alive.\\" Eric Shipton wrote \\"Theirs was an astounding achievement of courage and determination, one of the greatest in the annals of mountaineering. It was accomplished by men who were not only on unexplored ground but on a route that all the guides believed to be impossible.\\" Gaston Rébuffat praised Balmat's climbing abilities, describing him as \\"This man, robust, resolute, this crystal hunter who, as it turns out, possesses an extraordinary mountaineering sense, an unerring instinct for the crevasses and seracs of the glaciers ...\\" After the successful ascent, Balmat collected the reward offered 25 years before by Horace-Bénédict de Saussure to the first man who could climb Mont Blanc. On 3 August 1787 he assisted de Saussure himself to reach the summit with a party of about 17 people. During the Napoleonic Wars, Savoy fell under French control, and Citizen Jacques Balmat became a member of the council of the commune. He led an unsuccessful attempt to introduce Merino sheep into the Chamonix valley. Balmat was criticized for his autobiographical account of the climb, later published in English as Jacques Balmat, or The First Ascent of Mont Blanc, since his account downplayed the role of Dr. Paccard. Milner describes Balmat's story as \\"cloudily romantic and largely fictional\\" and quotes four analysts of mountaineering history who discovered errors in Balmat's version of events. Shipton describes Balmat as \\"boastful and conceited\\" and that \\"in character, he was both vain and mean. Success went to his head, and he soon began to amplify his part in the exploit.\\" Balmat died by falling off a cliff while prospecting for gold in the Sixt valley in 1834.

The village was originally called Hawley’s Corners, but in 1877 it was renamed to Metcalfe in honour of Charles Theophilus Metcalfe, Governor General of Canada from 1843 to 1846. In its early days, Metcalfe was a stop on the stagecoach route from Ottawa (known at the time as Bytown) to Cornwall. The village of Metcalfe was bypassed in the construction of railway lines, limiting its further growth. The railway line to Cornwall passed to the east, through the town of Russell, while another to Prescott passed to the west through Osgoode Village. By 1866, Metcalfe was a post village with a population of 250 of the township of Osgoode, nine miles from the Osgoode station on the Ottawa and Prescott Railway, and twenty miles from Ottawa. The village contained four general stores, an ashery, one wagon shop, five boot and shoe shops, and three carpenters. The 6th Division Court was held here, at the Victoria Hall. It contained the Metcalfe grammar school, and a common school; three churches, the Church of England, the Free Church of Scotland, and the Wesleyan Methodist. The Loyal Orange Lodge No. 205, met on the second Tuesday in each month while No. 688, met on the first Tuesday in each month.Ottawa City and counties of Carleton and Russell Directory, 1866-7 In the fall of 2008, parts of Metcalfe were used as sets in the filming of the Syfy television film Carny.

Sports The village is home to various sports facilities, most notably the Metcalfe Community Centre which bears the name of former Montreal Canadiens all-star defenceman Larry Robinson. The Centre's arena houses the local Junior B hockey team: the Metcalfe Jets. Notable Jets alumni include Larry Robinson and two of his brothers, as well as Boston Bruins' Marc Savard. It also hosts the Metcalfe skating club for figure skating and canskate. The small community also boasts the home to one golf course (Metcalfe Golf Club), seven baseball fields, a tennis court, curling club, and various soccer fields. Today The village today serves largely as a residential community for the City of Ottawa. The local agricultural fair, the Metcalfe Fair, has been held each fall since 1856.

Built upon Griffith's original collection of manuscripts and excavation records, it contains and preserves early copies of inscriptions, drawings, watercolours, old negatives, photographs, squeezes, and rubbings. Among some seventy major groups of material the Institute holds the papers of Sir Alan H. Gardiner, Battiscombe Gunn and Jaroslav Černý, records made by Howard Carter during his discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun in 1922, as well as the documentation from the Nubian expeditions of Griffith and Sir Henry Wellcome. The Institute edits and publishes two major research projects, the Topographical Bibliography of Ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphic Texts, Reliefs and Paintings, and the Online Egyptological Bibliography (OEB). It is also responsible for a number of important publications within the field of Egyptology, the best-known being Gardiner's Egyptian Grammar and Faulkner's A Concise Dictionary of Middle Egyptian.

The house is a center entrance four-story brick mansion in the Federal style, with entrances at both the front and sides, and two chimneys on each side. In shape it is a flattened cube, with five windows arranged symmetrically across both front and sides. Its main entry is crowned with a modest fanlight, echoed by a fan- shaped wooden motif atop the window above it. On the grounds, visitors will find a nineteenth-century garden, fruit trees, a privy, cobbled yard and carriage house. Within the house are fine collections of silver, furniture, portraits, clocks, needlework, antique fans, hatboxes, nineteenth century toys, and more from New England, Asia, and Europe. The China Trade Room displays early China Trade decorative arts including four Chinese coastal Hong paintings. An extensive clock collection includes examples made by local master clockmakers David Wood and Daniel Balch. In the canopy bedroom stands a carved seventeenth-century Dutch cradle and a three-sided crib. Many oil portrait paintings hang in the house, including a Cecilia Beaux portrait of Margaret Cushing and 1801 paintings by John Brewster, Jr., of Newburyport's Prince family. The museum also maintains a collection of area maps, photographs, and genealogical references. It is now the home of the Historical Society of Old Newbury and guided tours are offered between Memorial Day and Columbus Day. The house was declared a National Historic Landmark and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973, and included in the Newburyport Historic District in 1984. The house is deemed nationally significant for its association with Cushing, a 19th-century diplomat whose defining achievement was the Treaty of Wanghia, negotiated in 1844 with the Qing dynasty of China. This treaty was the first in which the United States secured equivalent rights to those of traditional colonial powers (in this case, the United Kingdom).
