Known as \\"Steady Eddie,\\" and later as \\"Concrete Eddie,\\" he was briefly a candidate for the 1973 Democratic nomination for Governor of New Jersey. Early life, education and military service Born June 20, 1916 in Milltown, New Jersey, he was the son of Milltown Councilman Joseph M. Crabiel and Helen Glock Crabiel. A brother, David Crabiel, was a longtime member of the Middlesex County Board of Freeholders and twice a candidate for Congress. Crabiel attended Milltown public schools, graduated from New Brunswick High School, and in 1936 received a BS in civil engineering from Rutgers University. In 1936 he joined the Franklin Construction Company as a civil engineer; he later served as president of Great Notch Granule Company and as president of F.E. Schroeder, Inc. He served in the U.S. Navy during World War II, where, as a member of the 70th Naval Construction Battalion attached to the Amphibious Corps, he was part of the Battle of Okinawa. He continued to serve in the U.S. Naval Reserves until his retirement in 1953. He was married for 52 years to Doris Young Crabiel; they had a daughter and three grandchildren. Political career Crabiel was elected Mayor of Milltown in 1947, at the age of 31. He was re-elected in 1949. He was an alternate delegate to the 1948 Democratic National Convention, pledged to Harry S. Truman. He was elected to the New Jersey General Assembly representing Middlesex County in 1953, and was re-elected in 1955, 1957, 1959, 1961 and 1963. During his twelve year as an Assemblyman, he served as Assistant Majority Leader (1962), Majority Leader (1963), and Minority Leader (1964 and 1965). In 1965 after the U.S. Supreme Court, in Reynolds v. Sims (more commonly known as One Man, One Vote), required redistricting by state legislatures for congressional districts to keep represented populations equal, as well as requiring both houses of state legislatures to have districts drawn that contained roughly equal populations, and to perform redistricting when needed. Because of its population, Middlesex County gained a second Senate seat. Crabiel was elected to the state senate in 1965, running on an at-large ticket with incumbent John A. Lynch Sr. in the new 7th Legislative District. They defeated Republicans Albert Ichel and Edward Hellriegel by a margin of nearly 3-1. Redistricting for the 1967 election gave Middlesex a third Senate seat. Running with Lynch and Assemblyman Norman Tanzman, he was re-elected in an election cycle that was less favorable toward Democrats (it was the mid-term election of the second term of Governor Richard J. Hughes, Crabiel won by a margin of sightly less than 8,000 votes over the top Republican vote=getter, Milltown GOP Chairman John A. Bradley. In his 1971 re-election campaign for a third term, Crabiel won by an impressive 31,000 vote margin. Crabiel served as the Senate Minority Leader from 1968 to 1973. Campaign for Governor of New Jersey On December 13, 1972, Crabiel announced that he would be a candidate for the 1973 Democratic nomination for Governor of New Jersey, seeking to challenge the Republican incumbent, William T. Cahill. Five weeks after Democratic presidential candidate George McGovern's landslide defeat, Crabiel cast himself as an organization centrist, saying in his announcement: \\"I'm an organization man from way back. I represent the center of my party, and in the recent presidential election the majority of the people overwhelmingly indicated that they want to move back to the center.\\" He became the second Democrat to enter the race, following former Assemblyman Vito Albanese (D-Bergen), who supported the legalization of marijuana and advocated an end to New Jersey's prohibition of abortion. Joining the race later were State Senator Ralph DeRose (D-Essex), former State Senator Richard J. Coffee (D-Mercer), former Senate Majority Leader John A. Waddington (D-Salem), and Assemblywoman Ann Klein (D-Morris). Another Democrat, Assemblyman Charles Yates (D-Burlington) also considered a gubernatorial bid. Less than two weeks after Crabiel's announcement, a plan to unite the 21 Democratic County Chairmen behind a single challenger to Cahill appeared to backfire as \\"reform-minded liberals\\"‚Äîmany of whom became active in Democratic politics by supporting Eugene MccCarthy and Robert F. Kennedy in 1968 and McGovern in 1972‚Äîattacked the move as \\"bossism\\" and called for the resignation of Democratic State Chairman Salvatore Bontempo. The move was supposed to solidify support behind DeRose, a conservative Democrat closely allied with the powerful Essex County Democratic Chairman, Harry Lerner. With liberals intent on nominating a gubernatorial candidate who was not a pawn of Democratic party bosses, by the end of January 1973 there was talk that Superior Court Judge Brendan Byrne was being asked to run. In March, Coffee attacked Crabiel, saying his nomination would be \\"disaster for the Democratic party in the November elections.\\" He cited \\"lucrative\\" state highway contracts to Crabiel's construction company, and Crabiel's refusal to release his personal financial information. On April 25, Byrne announced that he would run for governor, launching what was viewed as an eleventh hour campaign. He quickly picked up the backing of the powerful Hudson County Democratic Organization. On April 26, Coffee withdrew from the race and endorsed Byrne, and led to increased pressure for Crabiel to also drop out and help clear the field for Byrne. Byrne quickly won endorsements from Democratic organizations in Bergen and Mercer counties. On May 2, Crabiel dropped out and endorsed Byrne. That led to two county organizations that had been with Crabiel, Middlesex and Passaic, to back Byrne. Crabiel complained that it was too late for him to seek a fourth term in the state senate; his hand-picked successor, Edison Mayor Bernard J. Dwyer, was already in the race and the filing deadline had passed. Secretary of State On December 5, 1973, Governor-elect Byrne announced that he had picked Crabiel to serve in his cabinet as New Jersey Secretary of State. His nomination was confirmed by the state senate, and he took office in January, 1974. Indictment Just one month after taking office as secretary of state, law enforcement officials disclosed that Crabiel was \\"the principal target of a state grand jury investigation of corruption in New Jersey highway construction involving alleged collusive bidding and kickbacks to local politicians.\\" Crabiel immediately held a news conference professing his innocence, but he quickly became a political liability to Byrne. Byrne soon asked Crabiel to resign, but Crabiel told him to keep his suggestions to himself. Crabiel was essentially frozen out of the Byrne Administration. He was later indicted on charges that he conspired to control highway construction contracts. A judge eventually dismissed the charges because the statute of limitations had run out. Byrne eventually allowed Crabiel back into his circle of advisors. Crabiel resigned in July 1977‚Äîjust after staying long enough to qualify for his full state pension‚Äîwhile Byrne was seeking re-election and running well behind the Republican nominee, Raymond Bateman. Former New Jersey Secretary of State Lloyd B. Marsh, who served under two Republican Governors, was named as an unindicted co- conspirator the Crabiel indictment‚Äîthree years after Marsh had died.\\"Jersey Secretary of State Indicted for Bid-Rigging\\".

Highway Commissioner Two weeks after Byrne was re-elected, he announced Crabiel's nomination as a Commissioner of the New Jersey Turnpike Authority. In 1986, Governor Thomas Kean appointed him to serve on the New Jersey Wastewater Treatment Trust. Retirement and death After leaving office, Crabiel and his wife lived in Boca Raton, Florida. Crabiel died on June 19, 1992 at St. Peter's Medical Center in New Brunswick, where he had been admitted two weeks earlier after complaining of muscle disease. He was 75. The cause of death was acute respiratory failure. He died the day before his 76th birthday.

It is the causative agent of epizootic hemorrhagic disease, an acute, infectious, and often fatal disease of wild ruminants. In North America, the most severely affected ruminant is the white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), although it may also infect mule deer, black-tailed deer, elk, bighorn sheep, and pronghorn antelope. It is often mistakenly referred to as ‚Äúbluetongue virus‚Äù (BTV), another Orbivirus that like EHDV causes the host to develop a characteristic blue tongue due to systemic hemorrhaging and lack of oxygen in the blood. Despite showing clinical similarities, these two viruses are genetically distinct. Worldwide, eight serotypes of EHDV have been identified. Historically, only serotypes EHDV-1 and EHDV-2 have been found in North America, but recent research has discovered at least one more in the Midwest and Southern United States. EHDV can only be spread by an insect vector. In North America, the common vector is the biting midge (Culicoides variipennis). The first identified outbreak of EHDV in the United States in 1955 caused several hundred white-tailed deer to die in New Jersey and Michigan. Cases of EHDV-like die-offs have been reported prior to 1955 (as far back as 1890), but EHDV was not identified in these cases, as its existence was not yet known. Viral classification Order: Unassigned Family: Reoviridae Genus: Orbivirus Species: Epizootic hemorrhagic disease virusReoviruses (incl. Rotaviruses). (n.d.). Retrieved December 5, 2014, from Epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus belongs to the family Reoviridae, a family of double-stranded RNA viruses that includes familiar genera Rotavirus (the most common cause of viral gastroenteritis in children), Coltivirus (causative agent of Colorado tick fever), and Orbivirus. Besides EHDV and BTV, other orbiviruses include equine encephalosis virus and African horse sickness virus. Genome and structure Epizootic hemorrhagic disease viruss genome is about 18-31 kDa in length and consists of 10 segments, where each segment encodes a single protein. These proteins could be one of the seven structural proteins (VP1-VP7) or one of the four non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2, NS3a, or NS3b). The nonstructural proteins are encoded by gene segments 6, 8, and 10, and have been found to be highly conserved. The segmented genome of EHDV facilitates reassortment within species, and may be why EHDV breakouts occur every year. The virion outer layer is composed primarily of VP2 and VP5 trimers that are also involved in the virus's ability to attach to and penetrate a host cell. The outer core layer is formed by VP7, which provides a surface for VP2 and VP5 attachment, while the inner subcore layer is formed by VP3. The VP3 inner subcore layer self-assembles to control the size and organization of the capsid structure. The VP3 layer surrounds VP1, VP4, and VP6, in addition to the 10 linear double-stranded RNA segments. Eight serotypes of EHDV are proposed. Serotypes EHDV-1 (New Jersey strain) and EHDV-2 (Alberta strain) are the dominant forms of EHDV in the U.S., except for in 2012, when an outbreak of EHDV-6 accounted for 63% of the collected isolates from moribund or dead white-tailed deer in the environment. EHDV-6 is thought to be a hybrid form where each of the collected type-6 viruses were all reassortants containing VP2 and VP5 derived from an exotic EHDV-6, while the remaining structural and nonstructural proteins were obtained from the indigenous EHDV-2. EHDV-6 was originally described as originating from Australia, but it has been recognized as an emerging pathogen among cattle in several countries, and is now being considered as an endemic strain in certain parts of the U.S. Interaction with the host and associated diseases Epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus must be transmitted via bites from Culicoides gnats (C. verripennis) and cannot be transmitted directly from deer to deer. EHDV manifests itself as epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD), which has similar symptoms to adenovirus hemorrhagic disease (AHD), ‚Äúbluetongue‚Äù disease, and malignant catarrhal fever. Instead of being spread by a vector like EHDV, AHD is spread from animal to animal by direct contact and bodily fluids. EHDV is also antigenically different from ‚Äúbluetongue‚Äù disease but the clinical signs of each disease are very similar. EHDV causes deer to lose their fear of humans and causes weakness, excessive salivation, bloody diarrhea, fever, rapid pulse and rapid respiration rate. Hemorrhage and lack of oxygen in the blood results in a blue appearance of the oral mucosa, which is from where the name ‚Äúbluetongue‚Äù comes. Bodies of infected deer are frequently found in bodies of water, where they laid down in an attempt to lower their body temperature before becoming unconscious and dying. These symptoms develop about 7 days after the animal was exposed to the virus and 8‚Äì36 hours after the onset of initial observable signs; deer progress into a shock-like state, collapse and die. Examinations of infected deer suggest the virus interferes with normal blood circulation and normal blood clotting mechanisms. The characteristic hemorrhaging of all EHDV victims is caused by an interference with blood clotting mechanisms along with the degeneration of blood vessel walls in many organs and tissues throughout the body. Any alteration in the proteins such as fibrin that render them incapable of causing platelets to gather in a clot along a broken area of blood vessel wall will result in excessive bleeding outside of that vessel. All of this blood leaving blood vessels creates the hemorrhaging associated with this disease. Increased pericardial fluid and generalized edema consistently found in all cases of EHDV strongly suggest its interference with the normal circulation of blood. Since EHDV is transmitted by gnats, livestock can be exposed to the virus, as well. So far, livestock that have been exposed to this disease rarely show signs of infection. In cases where livestock have shown clinical symptoms, they are usually limited to symptoms such as fever, loss of appetite, lameness, and ulcers and crusty sores on the nose, mouth, and teats. Ibaraki virus, which is a strain of EHDV serotype 2, causes Ibaraki disease in cattle in Japan. Tropism Studies investigating the transmission of the disease have found that it can be transmitted to susceptible deer by inoculating them with infected material from diseased deer by subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, or oral routes in experimental settings. The specific tissues and organs that show hemorrhaging from EHDV vary animal to animal. The most common ones include the heart, liver, spleen, kidney, lung, and intestinal tract. Virus samples can be isolated from many kinds of tissues from infected animals, including blood, liver, spleen, kidney, lung, heart, and other muscles. Entry Infecting viral particles are able to enter the cell via an endosmal route. The believed mechanism for this has to do with an acidification of the endosome, similar to what is done in the influenza virus. Early acidification of the endosome is thought to release components from the virus core. These components are then released into the host cell cytoplasm. VP5 often catalyzes cell fusion, which facilitates the penetration of the endosomal membrane and consequently the release of outer capsid components. ALthough EHDV does not contain large concentrations of VP5, it is still able to infect cell systems. EHDV is able to be infectious due to the presence of VP7 as suggested by the binding of anti-bodies to the outer core protein VP7. The binding of EHDV to the cell surface via interaction of VP7 with glycosaminoglycans in addition to other receptors is the most probable entry mechanism. Replication and transmission Because EHDV is a double-stranded RNA virus, it needs to overcome a specific set of problems, the main one being the fact that double- stranded RNA is unable to be used as template strand during mRNA translation using host cell machinery. Therefore, EHDV must bring its own transcription enzymes into the cell, to survive and synthesize viral RNA and proteins. However, antiviral defense mechanisms are able to easily recognize and eliminate naked double-stranded RNA in the cell. The presence of the double- stranded RNA would trigger antiviral mechanisms such as apoptosis and interferon production. In order to bypass these host defenses, double-stranded RNA viruses such as EHDV ‚Äúhide‚Äù their genome and other translation machinery within closed protein capsids. These capsids are then delivered into the host cell cytoplasm, where they initiate transcription. The removal of viral proteins VP5 and VP2 during cell entry facilitates the transcription functions of the core, which allows EHDV to synthesize and cap full-length mRNA copies of up to 10 genome segments while they are still safely packaged with in the core. Release EHDV genome is assembled within the EHDV subcore, and core particles are assembled within protein capsids inside the cytoplasm of infected cells. The release of EHDV occurs through two main mechanisms: the common viral pathway of budding and by direct cell membrane penetration. The latter damages the cell, often leading to cell lysis. Budding is mediated by NS3.

It was sold in 1350 to the Confraternity of St Jerome and underwent reconstruction. In 1600, a member of the confraternity, Ippollito Pratonieri, after a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, set aside an endowment to reproduce the crypt of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. A reconstruction starting in 1646 led to the Baroque interiors we see today, designed by Gaspare Vigarani. The interior is peculiar, and consists of three oratories linked by corridors and stairs. One of these stairs, is meant to be a replica of the Scala Santa in Rome. A rectangular-shaped church is placed at the front portico; a second, circular Rotonda is designed with two tiers of colonnades placed one on top of the other, decorated with stucco statues of saints and a central altar.

For this accomplishment he is often referred to as \\"the Jackie Robinson of Classical Music\\".  Early life  Charles was born in Toledo, Ohio, and raised in depression-era Detroit, Michigan. In grade school, he excelled in music. When he was twelve years old, he heard the SFS under renowned conductor Pierre Monteux on his family's crystal radio, and vowed to one day play as a member of the orchestra under his direction.  Start of musical career  After high school, Burrell landed a job playing jazz at a club called B.J.'s in Detroit's Paradise Valley. At the start of World War II, he was drafted into an all-black naval unit located at Great Lakes Naval base near Chicago. He played in the unit's all-star band with Clark Terry, Al Grey, and O. C. Johnson,http://www.nwitimes.com/news/local/band-of- brothers/article_3370f418-af62-5e83-90b5-bc004adc1dfc.html and took classes at Northwestern University and with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.  Career as an orchestral and jazz musician  In 1949, Burrell joined his mother's relatives in Denver, Colorado, and was soon hired by the Denver Symphony Orchestra,.

Biography Sevastianos Rossolatos was born on 19 June 1944 at Ermoupoli, on the island of Syros, Greece. Like him, his family was Catholic, part of the ca. 200,000-strong Catholic community of Greece. There Catholics have a rather close relationship with the Orthodox Church, confession more widespread in the country, since the two Christian realities coexist for many centuries, and especially after the Second Vatican Council. There is also the Greek Byzantine Catholic Church, in communion with the bishop of Rome from the nineteenth century, which has about 3,000 faithful in Greece. Training and priestly ministry Rossolatos studied initially at the island of Syros, and then continued his education by attending the grammar school at the Greek-French Saint Paul School in Athens, managed the Society of Mary (Marists). He decided to follow his priestly vocation, so in 1962 he moved to Rome as a student at Sant'Atanasio College of the Greek Church and the Pontifical Gregorian University where he earned a BA in philosophy and theology. Then, at the end of six years of stay in Rome, he returned to his homeland, where on 21 July 1968 he was ordained a priest for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Syros and Milos.ekathimerini.com Rossolatos speaks Italian and French.cattoliciromani.com He was assigned to carry out the priestly ministry to the Virgin \\"Faneromeni\\" Sanctuary in Syros, also becoming the director of the diocesan magazine.

Nicknamed The Velvet Touch for his outside shooting, Ticzon played college ball at the Ateneo de Manila University. Playing career He was selected fourth overall by Pepsi Mega in the 1994 PBA draft. Ticzon was immediately traded to Purefoods along with second round picks in 1995 and 1996 for Dindo Pumaren and Dwight Lago. At Purefoods, he was reunited with his Ateneo coach, Chot Reyes. He showed his worth during the Commissioner's Cup finals against Alaska Milkmen by banging in treys propelling Purefoods' late rallies and finishing kicks. Beginning the 1996 season, Ticzon had trouble finding a team at the start of the year before hooking up with Shell in what could easily be the comeback story of the year. He went on to star in the team's surprise finals stint in the Commissioner's Cup, scoring a triple that tied the count with 10.5 seconds to go in the knockout game against Ginebra San Miguel and his game-winning fadeaway jumper late in Game Six of the finals against Alaska was one of the year's highlight plays. The comeback kid of the 1996 season made the most prolific season of his pro career as a starter for coach Chito Narvasa. With veteran Gerry Esplana arriving in the 1998 season following a trade, Richie's minutes on the playing court suffered a decline. In 1999, the former Ateneo scoring machine has gotten his release to play in the MBA via the Cagayan de Oro Amigos. He was then signed up by the Alaska Aces in 2001. Coaching career Ticzon would later turn to coaching after his playing years were over. He became an assistant coach at FEU, and would later serve as assistant to coach Junel Baculi at GlobalPort. Despite his lack of head coaching experience, team owner Mikee Romero installed him as the interim head coach for the Batang Pier after the team fired Baculi just a week before the start of the 2013-14 PBA season. In his only conference with the team, he compiled a 5-9 win-loss record and helped them reach the All-Filipino Conference quarterfinals as a seventh-seed team. He was then replaced by Pido Jarencio before the start of the next conference.

Name Ja Hu's name is very uncommon and was spelled in many different ways over time. Some of his descendants, many of whom still live in Cochise County, prefer to use \\"Jay Hugh\\", which was the name put on his replaced tombstone in the El Dorado Cemetery. However, the earliest known legal documents written by Stafford prove that his name was originally spelled \\"Jehu\\", after the prophet in the Hebrew Bible. Other variations of his name include \\"Ja Hu\\", which he used later in his life, \\"Jahu\\", and \\"J. Hugh\\", among others. Biography Ja Hu Stafford was born on June 2, 1834, in Davidson County, North Carolina, to John Wesley and Clementine Reid Stafford. When Ja Hu was still a boy, his family moved to Kentucky and then to Missouri, where he lived until joining the United States Army in 1852, stating his age as twenty-one. He spent the next five years at various posts in the Indian Territory, including Forts Towson, Arbuckle and Washita, before leaving the army to travel around the country. Ja Hu first went to Texas, then on to Arkansas and Kansas Territory, marrying his first wife Dorothy Francis Hicks, possibly in Illinois. He then drove a small herd of cattle up to Oregon and settled along the Powder River to become a rancher and farmer. After seven years of operating a saloon near Baker, Oregon, Ja Hu sold his property and went back to Kansas. In 1872, Ja Hu owned a large herd of cattle, which he sold a year later to purchase property in Garnett, Kansas. He left Garnett two years after that, but returned a short time later after continued financial difficulties. It was around this time he left his first wife, Dorothy, his daughter Alice, and his stepson Theodore to go to Colorado. In 1879, Ja Hu was in the town of Manti, Utah, where he met a Danish-born Mormon pioneer named Christoffer Madsen. Madsen, his wife, and his two daughters first traveled west to Salt Lake City in 1867 as part of a large Mormon wagon train, consisting of about sixty covered wagons. Both of Madsen's daughters died during the journey, but a third was born in western Wyoming and named Pauline Amelia Madsen. According to family tradition, Ja Hu met the twelve-year-old Pauline in the spring of 1880, when she arrived at his cabin to get warm, after herding cattle barefoot. A few months later, on June 3, 1880, Ja Hu and Pauline were baptized into the Mormon faith in Manti and probably married at the same time. Soon after, Ja Hu and his young wife left Utah to settle in Arizona Territory. Traveling with a small wagon train, Ja Hu arrived at Lee's Ferry on the Colorado River. Having much experience crossing rivers, he assisted the ferry operator in getting the wagon train across safely, for which he received a free crossing and one dollar in payment. In the latter half of 1880, Ja Hu arrived in the eastern part of Sulphur Springs Valley at the Riggs Ranch, established just a year or so before in what was still part of Pima County. There Ja Hu asked the owner of the ranch, Brannick Riggs, if he knew of a place he could settle nearby. Riggs suggested Bonita Canyon, to the east of the Riggs Ranch in the Chiricahua Mountains. Stafford found the area to his liking and immediately set about building a log cabin for the coming winter. The original log cabin was a small 14 square foot structure made with unpeeled logs, suggesting that it was built in a hurry. A second log room about the same size as the first was added sometime before 1885, followed by a small wooden-frame addition on the backside of the house around 1898 and a wooden-frame garage added around 1940. Ja Hu received his homestead certificate on April 6, 1886. Ja Hu spent the remainder of his life in Bonita Canyon raising a family and tending to his ranch and farm. He was soon joined by others, including the 10th Cavalry, which established a small camp in the canyon in 1885, and the family of Neil Erickson, which settled just to the west of the Stafford Homestead in 1887. Stafford's garden was large and productive, allowing him to sell his produce to the soldiers at nearby Fort Bowie and at Camp Bonita, as well as neighboring settlers. At the time, Bonita Canyon was still wild and remote. In the earliest years, Geronimo and his band of raiders were still active in the area, and the wildlife was abundant. On one occasion, Ja Hu had to shoot and kill a male jaguar that attacked one of his horses and which measured 6 feet and 8 inches in length. Bobcats also entered his home on at least two occasions and were killed by Ja Hu with his knife. He also killed at least one black bear that was threatening his property. An \\"Indian scare\\" occurred in Bonita Canyon in 1890, when the Apache renegade Massai and his pregnant wife traveled through the area. Massai was one of the Chiricahua prisoners that escaped the army's trains headed to Florida in 1886. He spent the rest of his life on the run in southern Arizona and northern Sonora in Mexico. One day in May 1890, Ja Hu was headed to a small corner in Bonita Canyon about three-quarters of a mile from his home that held his horses, so as to make a trip to Fort Bowie with a load of vegetables. Along the trail Ja Hu discovered a moccasin footprint. After stopping for a moment to think, Ja Hu returned to his home to protect his family. Later on, when he decided it was safe enough, he returned to his corral to find one of his horses missing. The horse, stolen by Massai, was eventually recaptured by the army and returned to Ja Hu later that year, but Massai escaped his pursuers into Mexico, after leaving his wife at the San Carlos Indian Reservation. Ja Hu died in 1913 and was buried alongside his wife in the El Dorado Cemetery, near the Riggs Ranch. He left behind five children from his second wife, Pauline, who died in childbirth in 1894. Ja Hu's original cabin, today known as the Stafford Cabin, is now part of the Faraway Ranch Historic District. In 1917, the owner of the neighboring Faraway Ranch, Lillian Erickson Riggs, became the owner of Stafford Cabin and incorporated it into her guest ranch business. It was later sold to the National Park Service to add to the Chiricahua National Monument. The cabin was individually listed to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975 and as part of the Faraway Ranch Historic District in 1980.

It is the only school building known to have been built by the community, and probably predates its formal establishment in 1866. It served as a school until 1943, and is now owned and cared for by the local historical society. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. Description and history The schoolhouse is a single-story wood frame structure, resting on a granite foundation, with a steeply pitched gable roof. A gabled vestibule area extends to the east, and there is a shed-roof outhouse addition to the rear. The building is located on the north side of Maine State Route 16, about southwest of its junction with Route 27 in Stratton. The interior is finished with wainscoting and pressed metal walls and ceilings, with a cornice featuring egg-and-dart patterning. The only known substantial changes since the 19th century are the alteration to the fenestration sometime before its closure in 1943. The foundation was rebuilt in 1996. The construction date of the building is unknown, in part because the early history of Coplin Plantation is poorly documented. Bloomfield Plantation, encompassing this area, was organized in 1841, and Coplin Plantation was established in 1866, at which time this building appears to have been standing. A local history asserts without evidence that it was built in the 1820s, but architectural evidence suggests a mid-19th century construction date. It is also possible that extensive renovations funded by the community in 1869 resulted in the construction of a new building; the community has only ever reported the existence of a single school building in its annual reports. The building was used as a school until 1943. The Coplin Plantation Historical Society was formed in 1985, expressly to see to the preservation and care of the building.

Its collection includes over 800 manuscripts in Arabic, Ottoman Turkish, and Persian; the oldest of which dates to the 12th century C.E. The institution was established in 1982 to serve primarily as a research library. In 1997, the institution reevaluated its mission to focus on promoting Palestinian literary heritage by engaging students in East Jerusalem and hosting cultural events for the local community. History The institution was organized largely by Ishaq al- Husayni, a scholar and member of the prominent al-Husayni family. Husayni partnered with the Dar Al-Tifl al-Arabi Institution to establish a research library and manuscript archive in the former mansion of Palestinian literary scholar, Issaf Nashashibi, in 1982. Restrictions on movement in and among Jerusalem, Israel, the West Bank, Gaza, and neighboring countries in which several million Palestinians reside, have severely limited scholarly access to the Center's collection. These impediments to access spurred the Center to reevaluate its mission in 1997. Attempting to be, first and foremost, a resource for scholars of Palestinian history, was deemed unfeasible considering the restrictions on movement and access. Today, the Center focuses on promoting Palestinian cultural heritage through events such as poetry readings and lectures aimed at engaging the population which has physical access to the Center‚Äîprimarily residents of East Jerusalem. Collection The bulk of the Isaaf Nashashibi Center's collection was donated by the al-Husayni family. The late Ishaq al-Husayni solicited the remainder of the collection from the personal libraries of other prominent Jerusalem families. Today the collection includes several thousand printed books, approximately 800 manuscripts, and a collection of local newspapers dating back to 1967. The printed books cover Islamic religion, history, and Arabic language literature. The Center lacks an online catalog of its print books. The majority of the manuscripts are in Arabic; 30 titles are written in Ottoman Turkish or Persian. According to the Center's chief archivist Basheer Barakat, as reported to the Palestinian American Research Center, the topics of the manuscripts can be categorized as follows: 500 titles on Islamic religion and Qu'ranic sciences, approximately 140 titles on Arabic literature, approximately 60 titles on the sciences, approximately 40 titles on history, and 6 titles on miscellaneous topics. The manuscripts are reportedly in good condition, though they could greatly benefit from modern preservation practices. The manuscript collection has been copied onto 16 mm microfilm.

Prizes In The 1000-Mile Trial of Motor-Cars their Iveagh phaeton completed the entire trial. In class D ‚Äî the most expensive for which a prize was given ‚Äî first prize went to Daimler and second to MMC. The gold medal for the most meritorious competitor was given to the Panhard of Hon C S Rolls. Liquidation The following report appeared on page 30 of The Automotor Journal of 7 January 1905: \\"Motor Manufacturing Company Limited In Liquidation Under the compulsory winding up order made last October against this company Mr H M Winearls (Assistant Receiver) has now issued his report to the creditors and shareholders. The statement of affairs shows total liabilities ¬£41,125 and assets valued at sufficient to yield a surplus of ¬£20,775 after payment of the debt. The account with the contributories discloses a deficiency of ¬£42,453. Mr Winearls reports that the company was formed in June 1902 to acquire and carry on the business which had been successively been carried on by the Great Horseless Carriage Company Limited registered in May 1896, Motor Manufacturing Company Limited registered January 1898 and a company of the same name registered March 1900. The capital of ¬£80,000 was divided into 320,000 shares of 5s each. The consideration for the sale was the undertaking by the new company to satisfy the liablilities of the old company amounting to ¬£38,000 and to pay the costs of liquidation of the old company and of forming the new company and to issue to the liquidator of the old company or his nominee 252, 966 shares of 5s each with 3s credited as paid. Only 136,562 of those shares were applied for but the remaining 116,404 were taken up in consideration of a payment of ¬£2,500 by the liquidator of the old company. During the first year the business was successful and several prizes were obtained by the company's cars. A dividend of 5 per cent was paid out of the first year's profits but during the following year the company was in need of working capital and issued debentures with the result that in June last Mr Frank E Beadle was appointed receiver and manager on behalf of the debenture holders. The failure of the company is attributed to want of working capital and pressure of creditors.\\" Disposal Shortly afterwards The Daimler Company reported that they had acquired at Coventry MMC's adjoining lease together with its plant and machinery.

Attie worked in a wide range of styles, illustrating everything from novels to magazine and album covers to the work of Truman Capote, and taking the best-known portraits of playwright Lorraine Hansberry. But he was best known in his lifetime for multiple imagery‚Äîhighly inventive, pre-Photoshop montages made by combining negatives in the darkroom‚Äîand also for a style of portraiture in which the subjects themselves controlled the exposure. His work received new attention with the 2015 publication of his Capote collaboration \\"Brooklyn: A Personal Memoir, With The Lost Photographs of David Attie,\\" a 2016-2018 exhibit at the Brooklyn Historical Society, and its inclusion many recent publications and documentaries. Early life and education Attie grew up in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn and graduated from Erasmus Hall High School, the same alma mater as Bobby Fischer, whom Attie later photographed. He briefly attended the Kansas City Art Institute and Cooper Union. During his Army service, Attie painted pinup-style portraits on the noses of combat planes; two of these are singled out as \\"gems\\" of the \\"nose-art\\" genre in Edward Young's book on the subject, B-24 Liberator Units of the CBI.Young, Edward M., B-24 Liberator Units of the CBI, 2011, Osprey Publishing: p86 and p95. Attie then worked as a commercial illustrator, often under the name Dave Attie; he drew Mad Men-era advertisements as well as the covers of magazines and \\"pulp\\" novels, some of which have been reprinted in recent books,McKnight-Trantz, Jennifer, The Look of Love: The Art of the Romance Novel, 2002, Princeton Architectural Press: p100. until he decided to pursue photography. Photographic career Attie began his photographic career as a student and protege of famed Harper's Bazaar art director Alexey Brodovitch, who had similarly mentored the careers of Richard Avedon, Irving Penn, Diane Arbus, and Attie's close friend (and Brodovitch classmate) Hiro. When Attie studied under Brodovitch, his legendary \\"Design Laboratory\\" course at The New School For Social Research -- which Brodovitch used to discover new talent for Bazaar -- was held in Avedon's photo studio. As Attie's son has written, his success in Brodovitch's famously difficult course was the result of a creative accident: \\"One night, [he] was developing film for his very first class assignment [photos of the original Penn Station], when he realized he‚Äôd underexposed every single frame. Class was the next day. In other words, he was toast -- and so was his new career. In a desperate panic, he started layering the negatives together, to create moody, impressionistic photo montages. His life must have been flashing before his eyes, and at the wrong exposure. Brodovitch loved the montages. He spent the entire class gushing over them.\\"Attie, Eli, afterword to Brooklyn: A Personal Memoir, 2015, The Little Bookroom: p101. On the final night of the course, Brodovitch gave Attie his first professional assignment, which was to create a series of photo montages to illustrate Truman Capote's newest work, Breakfast at Tiffany's, for Bazaar in 1958. But while Attie completed the montages, Capote began to clash with the publisher of Bazaar, the Hearst Corporation, over the tart language and subject matter of his novella. Alice Morris, the magazine's literary editor, later recounted that Capote agreed to make the changes Hearst wanted \\"partly because I showed him the layouts... six pages with beautiful, atmospheric photographs.\\"Clarke, Gerald, Capote: A Biography, 1988, Simon & Schuster: p308. But in the end, Hearst decided that Bazaar could not run Breakfast at Tiffany's anyway; its language and subject matter were still deemed \\"not suitable,\\" and there was concern that Tiffany's, a major advertiser, would react negatively.Plimpton, George, editor, Truman Capote, 1997, Doubleday: p162-163.Wise, Kelly, editor, Portrait: Theory, 1981, Lustrum Press: p7. When Capote resold the novella to Esquire, he specified that he \\"would not be interested if [Esquire] did not use Attie's [original series of] photographs.\\" He wrote to Esquire fiction editor Rust Hills, \\"I'm happy that you are using his pictures, as I think they are excellent.\\" But to Capote's disappointment, Esquire used just one full-page image of Attie's (though another was later used as the cover of at least one paperback edition of the novella). Attie's work on the project nonetheless launched his career, gaining him further assignments from both Bazaar and Brodovitch. Attie also went on to shoot portraits of Capote and to illustrate his essay Brooklyn Heights: A Personal Memoir for Holiday Magazine (later republished many times, including in Attie's recent photo book, Brooklyn: A Personal Memoir, Little Bookroom, 2015). Some of Attie's unused Breakfast at Tiffany's montages were later modified and used to illustrate Bill Manville's 1960 memoir Saloon Society, The Diary of a Year Beyond Aspirin, which was also designed by Brodovitch.Manville, Bill, Saloon Society, 1960, Duell, Sloan and Pearce. Brodovitch biographer Kerry William Purcell has described Attie's work on this book as \\"an inspired set of experimental images.\\"Purcell, Kerry William, Alexey Brodovitch, 2002, Phaidon: p180. From that point forward, Attie‚Äôs commercial work was prolific and wide-ranging ‚Äì including frequent covers and spreads for Vogue, Time, Newsweek, Playboy, and Bazaar; portraits of everyone from Bobby Fischer and Leonard Bernstein to Ralph Ellison and W.E.B. Du Bois and The Band; a variety of album covers (including at least one edition of Sammy Davis Jr. and Carmen McRae performing Porgy and Bess); and his own books of photographs, 1977's Russian Self-Portraits,Attie, David, Russian Self- Portraits, 1977, Harper and Row. and 1981's Portrait: Theory (together with Chuck Close, Robert Mapplethorpe and others).Wise, Kelly, editor, Portrait: Theory, 1981, Lustrum Press. Attie collaborated again with Brodovitch on a still-renowned special section of Harper's than ran in October 1959, \\"Writing in America,\\" which was edited by future New York Review of Books editor Robert B. Silvers and used Attie‚Äôs images to illustrate essays by Budd Schulberg, Kingsley Amis, Archibald MacLeish and others; it has been republished in book form, most recently in 2018. Attie also did the photos for a 1964 pinup book of Jayne Mansfield called Jayne Mansfield for President, on which he declined to put his name. As part of the promotion for Russian Self-Portraits, Attie appeared on a March, 1978 episode of the game show To Tell The Truth. Attie's April 1959 photo-shoot of Lorraine Hansberry for Vogue magazine, in the apartment at 337 Bleecker Street apartment where she had written A Raisin in the Sun, has become especially widely-published. In her award-winning Hansberry biography Looking for Lorraine: The Radiant and Radical Life of Lorraine Hansberry, Imani Perry writes that in his \\"gorgeous\\" images, \\"Attie captured her intellectual confidence, armor, and remarkable beauty.\\"Perry, Imani, Looking for Lorraine: The Radiant and Radical Life of Lorraine Hansberry, 2018, Beacon: p102. When Bobby Fischer arrived for his August 10, 1971 portrait session with Attie -- a shoot that was originally assigned to Richard Avedon, whom Fischer rejected because of his fashion background -- the eccentric chess master believed he looked unshaven and asked Attie to shave him. Attie obliged, and an 8mm home movie of the proceedings, shot by Attie's wife Dotty, was recently found by the family. In addition to his own work, Attie taught courses at Brodovitch's Design Laboratory in the 1960s, and at both the School of Visual Arts and The New School in the 1970's and '80s.Wise, Kelly, editor, Portrait: Theory, 1981, Lustrum Press: p172. While a number of Attie's portraits are in the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery, for some years after his passing, his work was not widely seen. In the past handful of years, however, Attie's work has experienced a significant revival. In 2014, New York Magazine published some of his previously-unseen portraits of Capote from 1958, as well as a 1959 portrait of pioneering Brill Building songwriters Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, which was originally shot for Vogue. Then a small selection of his music-related portraits became available through the online gallery Rock Paper Photo. Then a much broader selection of his work became available through Getty Images, leading to its publication in magazines and books around the world. Attie's work has appeared in a number of recent documentaries as well. His Hansberry portraits appear in Netflix's acclaimed 2015 Nina Simone documentary What Happened, Miss Simone?, in the Oscar- nominated 2016 James Baldwin documentary I Am Not Your Negro, and in director Tracy Strain's 2018 American Masters documentary about Hansberry herself, \\"Sighted Eyes/Feeling Heart.\\" His Leiber and Stoller portraits appear in HBO‚Äôs 2018 documentary ‚ÄúElvis Presley: The Searcher.‚Äù His 1969 studio portraits of The Band appear in Daniel Roher's upcoming Robbie Robertson documentary Once Were Brothers: Robbie Robertson and The Band, as well as having their own four-page spread in Harvey Kubernik and Ken Kubernik‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Story of the Band: From Big Pink to The Last Waltz‚Äù (Sterling Publishing, 2018). Most significantly, in November 2015, The Little Bookroom published a coffee-table book of Attie's portraits of Capote and his street photography taken in connection with Brooklyn Heights: A Personal Memoir, entitled Brooklyn: A Personal Memoir, With The Lost Photographs of David Attie. The book was well- reviewed in The New York Times and many other publications in America and around the world; The Independent named it one of the eight best art books of 2015 and wrote \\"when it comes to illustrated works, [this] one relatively slim volume stands out... a real gem of a find.‚Äù The book was also a finalist for a 2016 Indie Book Award. Its publication and reception have helped to bring considerable attention to Attie's work, including prominent supporters such as Bruce Weber and Mary Louise Parker, who called it an \\"extraordinary book,\\" and is seen leafing through it in the 2018 indie drama Golden Exits. In July 2016, the Brooklyn Historical Society opened a year-and-a-half-long exhibit of Attie's Brooklyn and Capote work, which gained wide press attention. In June 2018, Contact Photo LA opened an exhibit of Attie's long-unseen photo montages. In May 2019, Attie's Russian and American self-portraits were exhibited at the Wednesbury Museum and Art Gallery in the West Midlands of England, as part of the BLAST! Photo Festival, along with work he had influenced by artists from that region. Attie was a cousin of the visual artist Shimon Attie.

According to Donald J. Kochan, the federal government promised to transfer these lands to the State in the Utah Enabling Act of 1894. Federal lands in the 50 states , Utah has not yet filed suit to attempt to carry out the state law and the Devallier Law Group believes the Federal government is likely to \\"vigorously oppose\\" any lawsuit that Utah might bring, and would be expected to \\"use every legal means to stop it.\\"  History  Various Utah Federal elected officials have argued for \\"state rights concerning public lands\\" for at least several decades prior to 2012. More recently, State Representative Ken Ivory had been a strong supporter of states' rights and had frequently advocated for Utah to regain control of federal lands. In 2012, Ivory sponsored HB 148, The Utah Transfer of Public Lands Act, which asserted that the federal government must grant federal land back to the state of Utah after 2014. The legislature passed the bill. Governor Gary Herbert signed it into law on 23 March 2012, stating \\"This is only the first step in a long process, but it is a step we must take.\\" Though the bill was signed into law in 2012, federal lands remained in control of the Department of the Interior through December 2014, while the state attempted to \\"educate and negotiate\\" with Federal officials. , the Federal government had not agreed to enter negotiations. , the State of Utah began actions to obtain control of 31.2 million acres of federal land that lies within the state. The total land involved is more than half of the total of of land in the state. As of 2014 the state promised it would not use force to end federal control these lands, but instead would seek the transfer through a \\"four-step plan that the governor laid out\\": a program of education, negotiation, legislation, and litigation. The state set aside in 2014 to fund the initial phases of the plan. In December 2015, the Utah Commission for the Stewardship of Public Lands began the process of preparing a legal complaint that would form the basis for a lawsuit. Also in December 2015, University of Utah law professor Bob Keiter, with John Ruple, published a paper that argued the state would be unlikely to prevail in gaining the mineral rights to the disputed land, and that therefore the State would not be able to afford to manage the lands without additional sources of tax revenue. In late 2019, the Federal government proposed transferring a small amount of Federal land‚Äî-to the adjacent US State of Colorado that the Federal government had promised to Colorado, but never transferred, at the time of Colorado's statehood.  Analysis  =In favor= According to the Washington Times, \\"The federal government controls more than 50 percent of the land west of Kansas‚Äîin Utah‚Äôs case, it‚Äôs 64.5 percent, a situation that has increasingly resulted in tensions across the Rocky Mountain West.\\" Writing for the Federalist Society, Donald Kochan argues that the original Federal documents that created the State of Utah included promises that \\"the federal ownership would be of limited duration and that the bulk of those lands would be timely disposed of by the federal government into private ownership or otherwise returned to the State.\\" The State of Utah relies on the Property Clause and various Federal government court decisions‚Äîsome from about the time of Utah statehood‚Äîimplying that the federal Utah Enabling Act stating \\"...the federal ownership would be of limited duration and that the bulk of those lands would be timely disposed of by the federal government into private ownership or otherwise returned to the State.\\" must be interpreted as meaning at the very least the bulk of federal lands should have been transferred by today's date. \\"After citing the Property Clause, the Legislative Review Note relies on statements in United States v. Gratiot,{39 U.S. 526, 537 (1840)} Kleppe v. New Mexico,{426 U.S. 529 (1976)} and Gibson v. Chouteau.{80 U.S. 92 (1872)} ... there is a credible case that rules of construction favor an interpretation of the Utah Enabling Act that includes some form of a duty to dispose on the part of the federal government.\\" In March 2012, a Utah state law was passed the legislature and signed into law by the governor demanding that the \\"Federal government extinguish its title to an estimated more than 20 million (or by some reports even more than 30 million) acres of federal public lands in the State of Utah by December 31, 2014.\\" It also \\"call[ed] for the transfer of such acreage to the State and establishe[d] procedures for the development of a management regime for this increased state portfolio of land holdings resulting from the transfer.\\" The legal case of the State of Utah for demanding the lands back, though unprecedented in scale, has legal arguments based on precedent cases both pro and con, and no certainty as to the case outcome will be known before a variety of legal actions are litigated through the courts. \\"At the very least, there are open legal questions involved in the [Transfer of Public Lands Act] (TPLA)] that have never received definitive resolution in the courts. As such, critics cannot make a cut and dried case against the law. ... there are indeed serious legal questions to consider with the TPLA .\\" The state's legal case may hinge on somewhat arcane aspects of the Supremacy Clause and Property Clause of the US Constitution and how they interrelate with the Utah Enabling Act of July 16, 1894, although other legal \\"theories may also support the TPLA demand.\\" =Opposed= A 2014 study by professor Robert Keiter and research associate John Ruple of the University of Utah College of Law concluded that the state's effort is unlikely to succeed in court. The federal government's right to retain ownership of lands is characterized as \\"well established.\\" \\"The federal government has absolute control over federal public lands, including the constitutional authority to retain lands in federal ownership,\\" the study says. \\"Statutes authorizing Western states to join the Union required those same states to disclaim the right to additional lands, and that disclaimer cannot be spun into a federal duty to dispose.\\" The White Paper on the Transfer of Public Lands Movement was put together by the Wallace Stegner Center for Land, Resources and the Environment.  Economic analysis  The Federal government spent approximately managing land in Utah during 2012, about $8 per acre, and employed 2100 people (not including the National Park Service, which is not involved as Park Service lands are to remain with the Federal government, per the original legislation.) Some analysts expect management of the lands by state officials to be revenue positive‚Äîeven before any land would be sold off and thus begin generating tax revenue to the state‚Äîas income from recreation, oil and gas development, and other uses are expected to yield approximately per year to state government coffers under state management, assuming the price of oil doesn't go down. Other analysts say that if costs of management, including forest fires, were borne solely by the state, it could result in increased development, increased access fees, and decreased public oversight.http://www.newswise.com/articles/university-of-utah-researchers- federal-lands-takeover-would-harm-the-public \\"University of Utah Researchers: Federal Lands Takeover Would Harm the Public,\\" February 6, 2015  References   External links  * Utah House Bill 148, 2012. * US Senator Mike Lee on HB 148, 2012, video posted 7 November 2014 by the American Lands Council. * Enabling Act, Approved, July 16, 1894.

It was designed by architects Atkinson and Conrad and built from to 1929 by C. King. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 26 November 1999.  History  Balmoral's iconic timber fire station, designed by Atkinson and Conrad, was opened on 15 March 1927. Between 1860 and 1868 there were five attempts to form a fire fighting service for Brisbane. Each brigade struggled to survive unable to attract a viable subscription base and hampered by inadequate equipment and an unreliable water supply. The establishment of an effective fire service did not enjoy a high priority among civic and government leaders. A fifth brigade, the City Volunteer Fire Brigade, was established in 1868 under rules which provided for better financial control and management through the Fire Brigade Board. These arrangements were consolidated by the Fire Brigades Act of 1881 under which it was established that the Brigade was to be funded for fire services from contributions by the Queensland State Government, Brisbane Municipal Council, insurance companies and subscriptions. In 1889 the first full-time firemen were employed and a permanent fire brigade was established. A new headquarters, designed by H.W. Atkinson, was completed on the corner of Ann and Edwards Streets (on a corner of the Normal School site) in 1890. This began a long association between the Fire Brigade and the various architectural firms with whom he was associated. The fire fighting needs of the city increased as Brisbane continued to develop. A number of fire brigades were formed early after The Fire Brigades Act Amendment Act of 1902 allowed local authorities to establish boards and brigades. Those formed were voluntary bodies with only the superintendent and immediate assistants receiving a salary. The Fire Brigades Act of 1920 rationalised the network of fire brigades in Brisbane and suburbs, centralising control under the Metropolitan Fire Brigades Board in 1921. The idea of constructing a fire station in Balmoral was first mooted in the early 1920s when a residents group approached the Chief Officer of the Fire Brigade, Hinton, to inquire about the cost of erecting and fitting a station. The proposal was initially rejected as being too expensive, however the growth of the suburb eventually made it a necessity. A block of land extending from Pashen Street to Stephens Street was acquired for the use of the fire station, where the existing house and outbuildings were utilised as a temporary station from 30 June 1925 until March 1927 when the purpose-built station was opened. Plans and specifications for the new timber fire station were completed on 12 November 1926 by Atkinson and Conrad. Tenders were called on 10 November 1926, and the tender of W.B. Linsay of was accepted. The design of the building incorporated a central engine room with a three feet, six inch deep pit and a ramp leading to it from the street. A watch room, dormitory, workshop. kitchen, recreation room and bathroom were provided. The building had concrete foundations up to the brick piers. The specification called for called for a six-inch thick concrete foundation wall in the engine room and a five-inch thick floor. The external walls and gables were to be sheeted with hardwood weather boards and all floors, except the engine room, were wrought and tongue and groove pine (T and G). The roof was galvanised iron. A timber earth closet building, with a galvanised iron roof was erected at the rear of the station. The official opening of the Balmoral Fire Station was conducted by Albert Wright, MLA and member of the Fire Brigade Board on 15 March 1927. A number of local residents and members of the Fire Brigade attended the opening. The description of the building at this time was \\"neat, built of wood with a concrete base, 42 feet long and 37 feet wide\\". The final cost of construction was . Two permanent and four auxiliary staff were attached to the station. Additions were made to the fire station in 1929 to the design of architect S.W. Prior. The tender of C. King was accepted. A brick air raid shelter was constructed to the rear of the fire station during World War II. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour in December 1941 stunned the Australian populous, and in the weeks and months which followed fear of air raids and invasion dominated Australian society. On Christmas Eve, 1941, instructions were issued in each State by the State Emergency Committee for government, private employers and private households to immediately commence with the building of shelters. In Brisbane, three distinct categories of surface shelters were constructed: pill box, cantilever and special/site specific. Most of the shelters surviving today are of cantilever construction as these were purposely designed and located for conversion to public waiting sheds and shade structures after the war. The air raid shelter at the Balmoral Fire Station is of the pill box form, constructed by the State Government for the use of the firemen manning the Station. It was built to shelter approximately six adults. A tennis court was constructed on the property, and was the site of some of the local Fireman's Recreation Club activities. In 2002, it was decided that the building was too out-of-date for the needs of the fire service and a new location for a modern fire station was sought. The old fire station was sold and converted into a residence. It changed hands in April 2014 for $615,000. The air raid shelter still forms part of the property.  Description  The Balmoral Fire station is located at Pashen Street, Balmoral. The site is composed of the main fire station building, a grassed hose drying area, an old bomb shelter and clay base tennis court. The station building is a single storey timber framed building approximately long x wide. Constructed on concrete foundations and brick piers, the structure has a symmetrical appearance from the street with a simple gable roof extending the length of the building. The exterior walls are clad with timber weatherboards while the roof is sheeted with galvanised iron. Aluminium louvre shades have more recently been fitted to western windows. The interior space is structured around a central engine room which basically gives rise to the building's form. This space creates the spine of the building and has direct access to Pashen street via a large automated, panel lift door. Set either side of the engine room are ancillary spaces including a watch room, dormitory, officer's room (formerly a workshop), kitchen, recreation room and toilet and shower facilities. These ancillary spaces are lined with tongue and groove boarding. Similarly, the floors are also said to be tongue and groove, pine floor boards however, more recent floor coverings now conceal the nature of the original floor. The central engine room is set approximately below the floor level of side ancillary spaces, and access into these spaces is via small concrete steps located outside each doorway. Built into the steps are a series of drainage pipes which allow the central area to drain freely. At the rear of the central engine room a small locker room has been constructed. The area between the station and the front boundary is fully concreted. This hard stand area serves not only as the engine driveway into the station but also as a space for a couple of cars to park. Running around the perimeter of the station are a series of concrete paths and stormwater drains. Located to the west of the station building is a grassed area which is used for hose drying. This space is bounded by a simple concrete and steel fence to the Pashen Street boundary. Constructed to the rear of the station building on the eastern side of the site is a brick walled and concrete roofed air raid shelter of the \\"pill box\\" type. Apart from a more recent window which has been cut into one of the walls the structure is very intact and is now used as a storage space. Also located at the rear of the site on a higher level than the station building is a clay base tennis court. The original retaining walls to the court have been replaced by a system of interlocking landscape blocks which have been planted out with strawberry creepers. The court is surrounded by a combination of chain wire fencing and timber battens both set on a main timber frame. Located on the eastern side of the tennis court is a small timber framed and battened shelter shed. Generally the grounds are very well maintained.  Heritage listing  Balmoral Fire Station was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 26 November 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Balmoral Fire Station is important in demonstrating the growth and development of the Balmoral area during the 1920s. The air raid shelter constructed to the rear of the station during World War II demonstrates Australia's involvement in that conflict, and is testimony to the fear of attack and invasion by enemy forces following the attack on Pearl Harbour in December 1941 and the subsequent sweep of Japanese forces through Asia and into south-east Asia and the Pacific. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The Balmoral Fire Station demonstrates a rare aspect of Queensland's cultural heritage as one of the only 1920s fire stations still in operation in Brisbane. Both the exterior and interior of the building are substantially intact. The air raid shelter to the rear of the station is rare as one of few surviving structures built in Brisbane during the war for war-time purposes. War memorials and commemorated public facilities, such as community halls and swimming pools, are dedicated after the event of war ‚Äì air raid shelters are one of the few types of contemporary war-era structures surviving in Brisbane. While war memorials and commemorated public facilities such as community halls and swimming pools were constructed in the years following the war, air raid shelters are one of the few remaining structures built during the war for war- time purposes. The air raid shelter is also a rare example of a Queensland Government-built air raid shelter. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The Balmoral Fire Station demonstrates the principal characteristics of an early twentieth century suburban fire station. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The Balmoral Fire Station has aesthetic and architectural significance as a modest, functional civic building, sympathetic to its residential surroundings. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The Balmoral Fire Station is important for its association with the work of the architectural firm Atkinson and Conrad. Atkinson, through the firms he was associated with, sustained a long association with the Fire Services in Brisbane commencing in 1890 with his design for the new headquarters for the Brisbane Fire Brigade. His architectural practices were responsible for many of the fire stations throughout Brisbane.

Previously, she served as a Broward County Commissioner, representing the 3rd District from 2006 to the present. Prior to being elected to the Broward County Commission, Ritter served as a member of the Florida House of Representatives from 1996 to 2004, representing the 96th District. History Ritter was born in Washington, D.C., and moved to the state of Florida in 1974. She graduated from Piper High School, and later attended Rollins College, receiving her bachelor's degree in history in 1982, and Shepard Broad Law Center, the law school at Nova Southeastern University, receiving her Juris Doctor in 1985. Ritter worked as an attorney in private practice, specializing in probate work, and volunteered as a lobbyist with the National Council of Jewish Women, helping to convince then-Governor Lawton Chiles to veto a school prayer bill. Florida House of Representatives In 1996, when incumbent State Representative Benjamin Graber declined to seek another term in the legislature to instead run for Congress, Ritter ran to succeed him in the 96th District. She faced Broward County School Board Member Karen Dickerhoof in the Democratic primary, and campaigned on a \\"fresh approach,\\" which meant using in-line skates to go door-to-door within the district. She sold herself as a \\"political outsider\\" and criticized Dickerhoof for being \\"too close to Broward's political power brokers\\" while supporting \\"educational alternatives to reduce juvenile crime and strong growth management across [the county].\\" Ultimately, Ritter defeated Dickerhoof by a wide margin, winning 57% of the vote, and advanced to the general election, where she was opposed by Linda Blake, the Republican nominee. Once again, Ritter campaigned on reducing juvenile crime and controlling growth and emphasized her support for abortion rights. Ultimately, owing to the partisan breakdown of the district, Ritter defeated Blake in a landslide with 61% of the vote. When she ran for re-election in 1998, Ritter defeated her opponent, Republican nominee Kevin Norton, in a rout, winning 71% of the vote. She repeated her success in 2000, dispatching Republican Joe Kaufman with 68% of the vote. When she sought her final term in the legislature in 2002, she was opposed only by Libertarian nominee Roger Eckert, and won in yet another landslide, scoring 84% of the vote. Broward County Commission When Broward County Commissioner Benjamin Graber resigned from the county commission to run for the State Senate, a special election was held to replace him in the 1st District, and Ritter ran to succeed him. She won the Democratic primary unopposed, and faced John Irving Halpern, the Republican nominee, in the general election. Ritter campaigned on using casinos and gambling to replace property taxes as sources of revenue for the county; consolidating services in the engineering, finance, accounting, and legal departments at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport and Port Everglades; and promoting programs that assist minority-owned businesses. She ended up defeating Halpern in a landslide, winning 71% of the vote. In 2008, during the next regularly- scheduled general election, Ritter was re-elected to the County Commission without opposition. Ritter was accused of violating campaign finance law in 2010 by accepting campaign contributions without reporting and for using campaign funds to pay for personal expenses during her 2008 campaign. She admitted \\"sloppy bookkeeping,\\" but denied that she violated or intended to violate campaign finance laws, and in 2011, the Florida Elections Commission dropped most of the charges. In 2012, Ritter ran for re-election, and was opposed by Robert Sutton, the Republican nominee and a high school math teacher. Sutton attacked Ritter over her alleged ethical issues while Ritter campaigned on her successes in starting major construction projects in the county, including the building of another runway at the Fort Lauderdale- Hollywood International Airport, a new county courthouse, and installations at Port Everglades. Ritter ended up defeating Sutton in a landslide, winning re- election with 67% of the vote. In May 2016, Ritter was appointed president of the Greater Fort Lauderdale Convention & Visitors Bureau, despite objections from the county's Tourist Development Council.

He was the top vote- getter in the race for seven Assembly seats; he defeated, among others, Republican Assemblyman David Gelber. As an Assemblyman, Albanese created a major controversy when he alleged the Bergen County Prosecutor John J. Breslin and officials of the Bergen County Chamber of Commerce offered him a bribe to withdraw his proposed legislation to eliminate the Borough of Teterboro and divide it up into four adjacent municipalities. A special legislative committee formed to investigate Albanese's accusations said that Albanese's claim that he was offered a bribe was \\"wholly without support or corroboration\\" and accused him of McCarthyism. Albanese said the committee was putting \\"a coat of white paint on a pile of manure.\\" He was an early advocate of a State Income Tax. In 1967, Albanese was defeated in his bid for re- election to a second term. Running in the newly created Bergen County District 6B, he and his running mate, Assemblyman Arnold E. Brown, were defeated by Republicans Thomas Costa and Austin Volk. Albanese ran fourth, losing by nearly 11,000 votes. In 1969, Albanese ran again for the State Assembly, this time without the support of the Bergen County Democratic Organization. He lost the primary to Ernest Allen Cohen and Martin T. Durkin by more than 5,000 votes. Albanese sought the Democratic nomination for governor in 1973, supporting the legalization of marijuana and advocated an end to New Jersey's prohibition of abortion. During the campaign, he complained that the media was more interested in writing about his ownership of several bars in Bergen County and in New York City that were \\"frequented by homosexuals\\" than they were in covering his proposals. He finished fifth in the Democratic primary that was won by Brendan Byrne; Albanese won just 5,460 statewide (1.28%). In 1974, Albanese testified at the federal campaign fraud trial of his onetime rival, former Republican state chairman Nelson G. Gross, a former Bergen County GOP chairman, state senator, assemblyman, and 1970 Republican U.S. Senate nominee. The New York Times said that Albanese's \\"value as a witness appeared to be nullified under cross-examination.\\" Albanese grew up in Palisades Park before moving to Fort Lee. His brothers were politically active in Palisades Park including Vincent, a Republican, and Mario who was the Democratic Committee Chair. He died on April 13, 1998 at the age of 81 in Fort Lee.

It is also known as Colmslie Migrant Hostel, Fairmile Naval Base, Hans Continental Smallgoods Factory, and HMAS Moreton, Colmslie. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 7 December 2007.  History  The former Commonwealth Acetate of Lime Factory at Colmslie consists of a number of brick and timber buildings built between 1917 and 1920. Two timber demountable blocks were added as migrant accommodation c.1949. Since the early 1970s most of the site has been occupied by Hans Continental Smallgoods Pty Ltd, which has constructed a modern factory on the southern part of property. The remaining original buildings are used as offices and for storage. The riverfront fish markets have occupied the northern part of the original factory site since 1966. During World War One the Australian Commonwealth Arsenal developed its own defence factories, due to disruption of the supply of manufactured goods and armaments to Australia. By 1919 the defence factories included the Lithgow Small Arms Factory in Lithgow, New South Wales; a Clothing Factory in South Melbourne; and the Defence Explosive Factory Maribyrnong (Cordite) at Maribyrnong, Melbourne; a Government Woollen Mill; and the Acetate of Lime Factory at Colmslie, Brisbane. The latter provided acetate of lime for cordite production at Maribyrnong. After World War One the Australian government sought to protect the local steel, copper, chemical, and woollen textile industries, which had grown during the war, and to promote research and development. Government factories and laboratories were to provide a knowledge pool for the private sector, and the latter would then be able to help supply the country's defence needs in wartime. This policy of \\"Self Containment\\" led to Australia being able to supply itself with light weapons and ammunition by World War Two. The Munitions Supply Board (1921 to 1939) inherited the defence factories of the Commonwealth Arsenal, and its High Explosives and Filling Factory Group in Victoria became the centre of chemical engineering in Australia. Other Munitions Supply Board assets in the 1920s included the Ordnance Factory Group, Gun Ammunition Factory Group, and Small Arms Ammunition Factory in Victoria, and the Small Arms Factory Group in New South Wales. The Munitions Supply Board thus controlled the largest and most advanced factory system in Australia, and the largest industrial research laboratories, under the Munitions Supply Laboratories organisation. A committee from the Commonwealth Department of Home Affairs selected a site for the Acetate of Lime Factory at Colmslie in mid 1916, after Cairns was considered and rejected. Subdivisions 2 and 3 of Eastern Suburban Allotment 22, Parish of Bulimba, County of Stanley, covering were resumed on 21 September 1916 at a cost of . A plan drawn up by the Department of Home Affairs in November 1916, and signed \\"HJB\\", laid out the main built elements of the factory, and their function, as designed by the bacteriologist and chemist Auguste de Bavay. Born in Belgium, De Bavay had worked for a number of breweries (including Fosters, Swan, Cascade, Carlton and United), as well as working in the mining industry, and in the paper industry. He had designed the revolutionary ore-extraction technique of the \\"skin\\" or \\"film\\" flotation process, patented in 1905, to deal with \\"the Sulphide Problem\\". In 1914 de Bavay was asked by the Minister of Defence to investigate the manufacture of acetone for use in cordite manufacture, and in two weeks he had developed a process to ferment and distil molasses. He was later asked to build the Colmslie factory, which had a well-equipped chemical and bacteriological laboratory. His son, Francis Xavier de Bavay, became the first manager of the factory. The cost of the factory was about . Production began in 1918, with 30 employees, and continued after the war ended, in order to lay up reserve supplies. When production of acetate of lime (calcium acetate) ceased early in 1922, about had been made; enough to produce of acetone, leading to of cordite, or about 400 million rounds of rifle cartridges. The process of making acetate of lime started with molasses (from the Babinda and Mulgrave sugar mills) that had been shipped from Cairns to Brisbane. The molasses was pumped into a holding tank near the river, and was diluted with water. The liquid was then heated and cooled in the three-storey Agitator and Cooler House, to destroy foreign bacteria. In the two-storey Fermenting House yeast was added to large wooden temperature-controlled vats, with fermentation producing a dilute (8%) solution of alcohol (ethanol). The \\"wash\\" was transferred to vats on the top floor of the three-storey Settling House, where it was allowed to settle out. The wash was then transferred to the adjacent three-storey Acidifier House, where it was repeatedly pumped through wooden vats, which contained wood shavings and Bacterium Aceti. Over several days, the alcohol was converted into acetic acid (vinegar). The new wash was heated by steam coils, and the acetic acid and water was distilled off, in the two- storey Evaporator House. The acid distillate was neutralised with milk of lime to produce acetate of lime, and this solution was concentrated for evaporation on a heated revolving drum, where it was scraped off as solid flakes. The bagged product was then sent to Maribyrnong for conversion into acetone. Acetone enabled the combination of nitroglycerine and trinitrocellulose to form cordite. Alcohol distillation at the factory was approved in 1919, due to shortages of certain grades of concentrated alcohol, and the dilute alcohol produced by the fermentation of molasses was distilled to produce concentrated alcohol in the Alcohol Still House, a two-storey eastern extension to the Evaporator House. From early 1920 a pot still was used to produce alcohol for the ammunition factories, and in 1922 a continuous still was installed. Due to fears that oil resources were limited, alcohol produced from molasses was also considered as an alternative fuel. \\"Power alcohol\\" was manufactured at Colmslie from August 1924 to June 1926, before production was halted by concerns that the cost was too high. Approximately 800 kilolitres of this alcohol was made, and was mixed with benzol and ether to produce 1200 kilolitres of motor fuel. This fuel was used by the Post Master General's Department, in its postal vehicles in Brisbane and Melbourne, and by Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) vehicles in Victoria. From 1926 the factory was closed down to a reserve status, under a caretaker. In 1935 the factory's plant was moved to the Footscray and Maribyrnong factories in Melbourne, and the factory was handed over to the Department of the Interior in January 1936. In June 1936 the idea was floated that the Post Master General's Department could use a building for its frequency measuring equipment, using the chimney and water tower to mount aerials. The Department's Radio Broadcasting Branch, Wireless Experimental Section, occupied various buildings from 1937, including the Acidifier House and the Fitter's shop. The Wireless Experimental Section's peace and quiet was disturbed when an advance party of RAAF personnel arrived at the factory on 23 May 1939. Several factory buildings were required for billeting and storage purposes while the RAAF was awaiting the completion of huts at Archerfield. The Ordnance Service also staked a claim for storage space from February 1940 onwards, and the Field Hygiene Section of the Seventh Division occupied a number of buildings in late 1940. The Engineer's Supply Service branch arrived in April 1941, and the Allied Works Council was present in 1942. The 6th Anti Aircraft battery was a resident by June 1942 and the 2nd and 14th AA batteries by August 1943. The Post Master General, Ordnance Services, and the Anti Aircraft batteries were still using some buildings in October 1943, but from November 1942 onwards the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) gradually took over most of the complex, which became part of the Fairmile Naval Base (by 1948 the base was referred to as 'HMAS Moreton, Colmslie'). The factory's jetty became a refuelling wharf, and navy workshops and a repair slipway were built between the factory and the river. New tenants were soon to follow. In December 1943 Prime Minister Curtin had expressed the view that, for security reasons, Australia's population had to increase to 20 million. The Commonwealth Department of Immigration was created in 1945, and in 1946 the goal was to allow 70,000 migrants into Australia each year, (roughly 1% of Australia's population at the time). The United Kingdom-Australia Free and Assisted Passage Agreements became active in March 1947. Adults would only pay towards their passage, and children aged 14‚Äì18 would be charged . A shipping shortage handicapped the program until 1948, but from 1947 to 1958, of 457,898 migrants moving from the United Kingdom to Australia, 68% received assisted passage. In this period the British represented about a third of all migrants to Australia. The peak years of assisted British migration to Australia were between 1949 and 1952. In order to address labour shortages, the Australian Government also decided to use another source of immigrants: the mass of Displaced Persons in Europe. In July 1947 an agreement was reached with the United Nation's International Refugee Organisation, which would provide the ships to deliver a minimum of 12,000 Displaced Persons per year. This was the first assisted passage scheme for non-British migrants. The migrants included people from the Baltic States of Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania. Other Displaced Persons came from Eastern and Central Europe, including Czechs, Yugoslavs, Ukrainians, Hungarians and Poles. By 1951, about 170,000 Displaced Persons had moved to Australia. In 1949 the Migrant Accommodation Centres Division was formed within the Commonwealth Department of Immigration. It was decided that Displaced Persons would go to Holding Centres, where the dependants would stay until the \\"breadwinner\\" of the family, working in the vicinity of the Holding Centre, could afford accommodation elsewhere. However, if a worker was allocated to a Worker's Hostel that had room for dependants, the family might be able to live together at the hostel. Although the Department of Immigration administered Holding Centres, the Department of Labour and National Service administered Worker's Hostels. In June 1949 the Department of Immigration was planning to open four Holding Centres for \\"New Australians\\" in Queensland. Wacol opened 9 November 1949, on Army land; Stuart, on RAAF land south of Townsville (the former Operations and Signals Bunker at Stuart) opened 30 March 1950; Frazer's Paddock at Enoggera opened 14 April 1950, on Army land; and Cairns opened 19 August 1950, on acquired land. In 1952 the standard capacities of these camps were listed as: Wacol 1465; Stuart 500; Enoggera 515; and Cairns 370. At this time 13 Holding Centres were still active in Australia. By April 1960 Wacol was the only migrant Holding Centre left in Queensland. In mid 1948 the Director of Migrant Hostels had visited the old Acetate of Lime Factory, now acting as a naval barracks, with representatives from the Department of Labour and National Service, and the Department of Works and Housing. In December 1948 the Department of Labour and National Service had asked the RAN for the use of the factory buildings for Baltic Displaced Persons, and the site was transferred from the Department of Interior to the Department of Labour and National Service. However, the land near the river would be used by the Army. In June 1949 it was reported that there would be a Worker's Hostel at Colmslie with a projected capacity of 500 persons. The existing buildings of the Acetate of Lime Factory would provide accommodation, but a number of timber huts were also added the site, as illustrated on an April 1949 map by the Commonwealth Department of Works and Housing (the huts are not present on a 1948 site map prepared by the Department of the Interior). Two of these huts, which were used as six room sleeping blocks, remain on site today, to the north of the brick Engineer's Office and Fitter's shop. By December 1949 the term \\"Colmslie Migrant Hostel\\" was being used in correspondence. Initial government policy was that British migrants would not be sent to Holding Centres. The Immigration Depot at Yungaba, Kangaroo Point, was remodelled to receive the first post-World War Two British migrants to Queensland, who left Britain in May 1947. In general though, Yungaba was used as transit depot for those British migrants who had their own accommodation arranged. British migrants who needed longer-term accommodation would be housed at Workers' Hostels. In January 1952 \\"Commonwealth Hostels Limited\\" took over management of the Colmslie Migrant Hostel. Although it was policy that assisted British migrants should live at hostels, there were also non-British migrants at Colmslie in the late 1950s. According to one woman who lived there between 1959 and 1962, these included Germans, Finns, Danes, Yugoslavs, and Russians. Mr Flood, the hostel's Manager at the time, lived in a bungalow (no longer extant) surrounded by palm trees and hibiscus. This was originally the Factory manager's office and laboratory, situated south of the Evaporator House. As part of the Colmslie Migrant Hostel, the Acidifier House was used for accommodation, and as a dining room and kitchen. The Engineer's Office and Fitter's Shop became a baggage store and the Assistant Manager's quarters, and the Winch House became a tool room. The Evaporator House was used for accommodation, ablutions and recreation, and the Alcohol Still house was also used for accommodation. The Engine Room was used for accommodation and recreation, and the Boiler House was used as a laundry. The Lime Slacking Store became an office, and the Excise Office, Fertiliser House and Painter's Shop building (extended to the south around 1949) became a store. The desire to keep the British out of Holding Centres seems to have weakened over time, since by 1959 it was suggested that Wacol could be used for British migrants. Due to the June 1959 \\"Nest Egg Scheme\\", whereby British migrants with in savings could get assisted passage without an accommodation sponsor in Australia, there was a need for emergency accommodation. Yungaba and Colmslie were to be used first, but any extra British could join the Dutch migrants at Wacol. In November 1960 the RAN declared its remaining land near the hostel as surplus to requirements. The RAN workshops, slipway and jetty, which had been occupied by the Army's Small Boat Squadron since 1956, had been declared surplus by the Army by April 1960. The land adjoining the Hostel was thus transferred from the Department of Interior to the Department of Immigration in March 1962, and in 1966 this waterfront area, with the workshops, slipway, and part of the hostel grounds, was transferred to the Queensland Fish Board. The two-storied Fermentation House of the Acetate of Lime Factory still stands on this land, which now contains the Brisbane Fish Markets. In January 1963 the Colmslie Migrant Hostel had a capacity of 270, with 30 Families resident. It was closed on 31 March 1963. Those migrants who could not find new accommodation were allowed to go to Wacol, which Commonwealth Hostels was taking over from the Department of Immigration. It appears that the Hostel was briefly reactivated in 1965, before closing permanently. Hans Van der Drift, a Dutch-born chef, started Hans Continental Smallgoods in Ascot in 1960, and his company occupied the remainder of the Colmslie hostel site in the early 1970s. Although the molasses storage tanks and Montejus pit near the river were demolished before the end of World War Two, and the Agitator and Cooling House, Settling Tank House, and Laboratory/Bungalow have disappeared since World War Two, a number of the main buildings involved in the process of producing acetate of lime are still present on the site. However, the top two floors of the Acidifier House were removed some time after 1965, and with its modern cladding the building no longer resembles its earlier form.  Description  Chimney in 2015 The former Acetate of Lime Factory, now a part of the Hans Continental Smallgoods factory, is accessed from Colmslie Road. A large modern factory building occupies most of the southern part of the site. The original factory buildings are further north, and are stepped down the north face of the slope towards the Brisbane River. Elements of the Acetate of Lime Factory that still exist on the eastern side of the internal roadway include: the Lime Slacking Store and the Lime Slacking House; the Excise Office, Fertilizer House and Painters' Shop building; the Evaporator House and Alcohol Still House; the Engine Room; the Boiler House and Chimney; and a small latrine block. To the west of the internal road are: the ground floor of the Acidifier House; the Winch House, and the Engineers' Office and Fitters' Shop. To the north of the Engineers' Office and Fitters' shop are two huts that were introduced as extra migrant accommodation. The Lime Slacking Store is an L-shaped single-storey building, built of brick with a hipped roof clad in corrugated iron. It has been converted into a cold room. Some of the double-hung sash windows have been bricked over, while others have been painted over. A brick-lined gutter runs along the ground on the south side of the building. Just north of the store is the small, brick Lime Slacking House, which is visually obscured by a modern metal-clad extension to the south of the Alcohol Still House. Just to the west of the Lime Slacking Store is the T-shaped single storey timber Excise Office, Fertilizer House and Painters' Shop building, which is clad in weatherboards and has a hipped roof clad in corrugated iron. Between the Excise Office, Fertilizer House and Painters' Shop building and the Evaporator House is a concrete retaining wall. Further north, the Evaporator House/Alcohol Still House, Engine Room, and Boiler House are staggered down the hill towards the chimney, each constructed of English Bond red bricks. Although they are adjoined externally, they do not have an internal thoroughfare. The interior of the two storey Evaporator House and Alcohol Still House has been refurbished for use as offices, with a mezzanine level at the eastern end of the first floor. The original timber roof trusses survive above the office cubicles, there are small vents two thirds up the walls at regular intervals, and the ends of metal bolts can also be seen, ground-off flush with the brickwork. There is an outside stairway to the mezzanine level on the east face of the building, and there is a concrete ramp to the first floor entrance near the western end. Dormer windows have been added to the corrugated iron roof above the mezzanine floor. A modern kitchen extension, of Stretcher Bond brick, protrudes north from the mezzanine level of the Evaporator House, and a modern flat-roofed shed adjoins the north side of the Alcohol Still House. There is also a modern flat-roofed extension to the south of the Alcohol Still House, clad in metal sheeting. East of the Alcohol Still House is a small brick latrine, with bull nosed corners, that is now used for chemical storage. The Engine Room is used as a cold store, and the Boiler House is used as a storeroom. A modern cold-store extension conceals most of the lower floor of the Engine Room and Boiler House on the eastern side. The chimney has a steel ring encircling its summit, and it has a steel door on its lower north side, which was opened by swinging it completely away along a steel track. To the west of the internal road is the remaining floor of the Acidifier House, which appears to have been substantially modified, with modern cladding. To the north is the Engineers' Office and Fitters' shop, made with Stretcher Bond brick, of one-storey with a mezzanine floor. To its north is a skillion-roofed timber extension. Just to the east of the fitter's shop is the Winch House, also of Stretcher Bond brick. It is open on one side, and has an extended roof that serves as an entrance porch for the Fitters' shop. Two one-story wooden barracks stand to the north of the Engineers' Office and Fitters' shop. Raised on timber stumps, each is clad in weatherboards, with a skillion roof of galvanised iron, and timber-lined eaves. Each has six doors on the southern side. The southernmost hut has six windows on the northern side, but the northernmost hut has a sliding steel door in place of one of its windows. Any post 1970 structures and extensions on the site are not significant, nor are the post 1970 internal modifications to the factory buildings significant. The surviving ground floor of the Acidifier House is no longer significant.  Heritage listing  The former Commonwealth Acetate of Lime Factory was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 7 December 2007 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The remaining buildings of the Commonwealth Acetate of Lime Factory at Colmslie, built between 1917 and 1920 as part of the defence-factory program of the Australian Commonwealth Arsenal, demonstrate Queensland's role in Australia's early defence industry: using the products of sugar cane to contribute to Australian self-sufficiency in ammunition manufacture. Between 1943 and 1948 the factory was part of a Royal Australian Navy Base, illustrating how Commonwealth properties could be adapted for military use in a crisis. The use of the factory buildings as a hostel for migrants between 1949 and 1963, and c.1965, demonstrates the process of adapting Commonwealth defence properties to temporarily house migrants from Britain and Europe during Australia's post-World War Two period of mass immigration. In addition, the factory network of the Munitions Supply Board was related to a deliberate government effort to provide a scientific and technical knowledge base for Australian private industry. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The Acetate of Lime Factory at Colmslie was the only Commonwealth Arsenal/Munitions Supply Board Factory built in Queensland prior to World War Two, and was the only factory of its type in Australia. The two de-mountable timber huts on the site may be among the last remaining in-situ Queensland examples of the temporary accommodation provided on military properties for post-World War Two migrants. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The Acetate of Lime Factory at Colmslie has fine industrial aesthetic qualities and its relationship with the river is also aesthetically significant. In particular the brick chimney is an important landmark in the industrial river-scape of the Brisbane River. The place is important in demonstrating a high degree of creative or technical achievement at a particular period. An innovative process for manufacturing Acetate of Lime from molasses was developed for the Australian Government by the noted bacteriologist and chemist Auguste de Bavay, and the Colmslie factory was built to his specifications. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The factory buildings have a strong association with the chemist Auguste de Bavay. The factory is also associated with a number of Commonwealth government and military organisations of importance, including the Commonwealth Arsenal, the Munitions Supply Board, the Royal Australian Navy, the Commonwealth Department of Labour and National Service, and the Commonwealth Department of Immigration.

Personal life Gildiner was born in Lewiston, New York, was later raised in Niagara Falls, New York, and spent her teen years in Amherst near Buffalo. Gildiner's latest biographical segment describes her time at the University of Oxford's Trinity College starting in 1968 where she was one of only two female students (both American) studying literature, and where the clashes of American and British culture provided many interesting and entertaining episodes. She managed her entry into Oxford partly on the strength of a poem on Milton's Paradise Lost which she wrote after ingesting a friend's psycho-pharmaceutical that was supposed to keep her awake long enough to finish her essay. According to her autobiography, this was the only poem she'd \\"ever written before or since\\", and it allowed her to leave the US where she had been questioned by the FBI over her involvement with a boyfriend who was a part of the Black Panther Party movement. Her time in England included encounters with both Bill Clinton and Jimi Hendrix. After Oxford, Gildiner finished her bachelor's degree at Ohio University, followed by teaching at Thomas Paine High School, scene of recent race riots, where she successfully engaged black students that had been given up as a lost cause by some of her colleagues. A scholarship allowed her to attend Victoria College at the University of Toronto for her master's degree with leading Coleridge scholar Kathleen Coburn. First she shared student quarters with men that turned out to be allied with the FLQ, resulting in her being questioned again, this time by Canadian police, followed by free rent at a high-rise that was revealed as a centre for illegal drug trade.

It was designed by Frank Gibson Costello and built by Brisbane City Council. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 6 April 2005.  History  The Brisbane City Council built the concrete shelter at Morningside as an air raid shelter in 1942. In the months after the outbreak of the Pacific War Queensland became a support base for the conduct of the conflict. Australian and American personnel poured into Queensland and urgently required a wide range of new buildings and facilities. The population of Brisbane swelled dramatically. As it was the major city in Queensland, and the most northerly major population centre in Australia, military planning headquarters were set up in Brisbane, as were a number of important maintenance, communication, and supply facilities. General Douglas MacArthur, Commander in Chief of the Allied Forces, Southwest Pacific, was based in the AMP building at the corner of Queen Street and Edward Street in Brisbane, and General Sir Thomas Blamey, Commander in Chief of the Australian Forces, used the recently constructed University of Queensland buildings at St Lucia. Brisbane was obviously a strategic target for bombing, and rapid action had to be taken to protect the population in the event of air raids. The demand on materials, services and labour was enormous and military projects took precedence in their allocation. Heavy Anti-Aircraft batteries were built at Victoria Park, Hendra, Pinkenba, Fort Lytton, Hemmant and Balmoral, and coastal artillery batteries were established on Bribie and Moreton Islands. Before the war, Queensland had a small population and no heavy manufacturing industries. To help overcome these problems, some buildings were prefabricated and standard designs for many structures were used. Designs took into account the scarcity of skilled labour and of some materials. The Brisbane City Council took responsibility for Air Raid Precautions activities, including establishing an Air Raid Warden system, firefighting systems and constructing air raid shelters. Aboveground salt water pipes were laid along city streets to aid in firefighting. On Christmas Eve, 1941, each Australian State's Emergency Committee issued instructions for government, private employers and private households to immediately start building shelters. Slit trenches were built in parks and schoolyards, windows were taped, and brownouts were applied to buildings. In the Protection of Persons and Property Order No.1, gazetted 23 December 1941, Premier William Forgan Smith, with powers conferred by Regulation 35a, National Security (General) Regulations, ordered the Brisbane City Council to construct 200 public surface shelters in the city area. Work had already started on 15 December, and later another 75 shelters were ordered. However, only 235 air raid shelters were constructed, the building programme being 90% complete by June 1942. In addition, around three kilometres of covered trenches were constructed in public parks, in 13 projects, including of concrete-pipe covered trench in the Botanic Gardens, and of the same in Victoria Park. It was believed that one person could be accommodated by each foot of trench. In addition to the public shelters, the Brisbane City Council also constructed shelters for leased wharves and council properties, including at the Stanley Wharf, Circular Quay Wharves 2,3 and 4, Norman Wharf, and Musgrave Wharf. Shelters were built under the Story Bridge, for Kangaroo Point shipbuilding workers, and five shelters were constructed on behalf of the Bureau of Industry at the Howard Smith Wharves. The Protection of Persons and Property Order No.1 was applied statewide, and outside Brisbane another 24 Local Authorities in Queensland's coastal areas were ordered to produce surface or trench shelters for the public, to be built according to the Air Raid Shelter Code laid down in the Second Schedule of Order No.1. Initially, 20 of the Local Authorities were expected to construct a minimum total of 133 surface shelters, which were supposed to be able to withstand the blast of a 500-pound bomb bursting away. Four other Local Authorities would only build trenches. However, after plans were amended, 23 Local Authorities outside Brisbane, excluding Thursday Island, ended up possessing a total of 129 public shelters: 123 surface and six underground. This effort had cost . Where Local Authorities were unwilling or unable to build the required number of code- compliant shelters, in some cases because they had already begun erecting other shelters, the Department of Public Works became responsible for the shelters' construction. However, this led to problems when the Department tried to recoup half of the cost from the Local Authorities in question. Townsville, Toowoomba, Gladstone, and Ayr denied any liability for costs, and a Bill had to be passed in December 1942 to force their compliance. The Ayr Shire Council had claimed that the shelters would be death traps during an air raid. Of the 235 surface shelters built in Brisbane for the public, 21 survive and are still owned by the Brisbane City Council. One of the shelters, on Queens Wharf Road, is a site-specific \\"special\\" variation of the standard pillbox design. It is listed in the Queensland Heritage Register as part of the entry for the porphyry retaining wall on William Street. The other 20 public shelters owned by the Brisbane City Council can be divided into three types of pillbox intended for conversion after the war: \\"park\\", \\"bus\\", and \\"bus (stone)\\". They were designed to serve as structures such as bus waiting shelters or shade structures for parks, with some or all of the perimeter blast walls to be removed, leaving the concrete slab roof, floor slab and piers. The reusable pillboxes were designed to hold 70 people, as were the non- reusable standard pillboxes. F.G. Costello, Brisbane City Council City Architect between 1941 and 1952, was responsible for the design of the surface air raid shelters, and his variants of the standard pillbox were designed to provide a post-war utility for at least part of the Council's shelter building programme. In an address delivered to the Constitutional Club in Brisbane on February 1942, Costello noted that if the emergency for their use does not arise ... (unused shelters)... remain in brick and concrete, in many cases having no further value and being a possible source of nuisance. He added that I can assure you that wherever it is possible, without sacrificing the primary requirements of shelter from air attack, I have endeavoured in our Council buildings to so plan the shelters that they will fit into schemes of improvement which we hope will proceed immediately after the war. Costello's work was characterised by the use of an architectural language inspired by the modern movement in architecture. This movement pursued the rational use of modern materials and principles of functionalist planning and established a visual aesthetic largely inspired by the machine. It was part of an architecture employing the language of vertical and horizontal volumes and planes, floating flat roofs, masses set against voids and monumentality. Though modest in scale and form, the design of the shelters is characteristic of work in this idiom. The reusable shelters were often sited under fig trees, to aid in camouflage. The first of Costello's reusable designs is the pillbox with double- cantilevered roof slab, or \\"park\\" type shelter. In an original list of all the shelters constructed by the Brisbane City Council, these were simply labelled as \\"cantilever\\". They had four central piers supporting the roof slab, which allowed for the removal of the four blast walls after the war. There was an entrance at each end of the front wall, where an internal wall extended into the shelter. If the walls were made of brick, the shelter's dimension was by by high, and if concrete was used the dimensions were by by high. The difference was due to the fact that the brick walls finished in line with the top of the roof slab, covering the fascia, whereas the concrete walls finished at the soffit of the roof slab, flush with the fascia. The minimum wall thickness for brick was set at 13.5\\", and 12\\" for concrete. The roof slab was intended to have at least four inches of concrete. Of the 37 reusable shelters listed as being of the park type only 17 survive: one at Hefferan Park in Annerley; two at Albert Park; two at Wickham Park; one in Buranda Playground in Woolloongabba; two in Raymond Park in Kangaroo Point; and one each at Kelvin Grove, Morningside, Nundah, Stones Corner, and Windsor. Four other shelters stand on East Street and Wickham Street in Fortitude Valley. Most are used as simple park shelters, as intended, but the shelter at Nundah has been modified as a toilet block, and the shelter at Kelvin Grove is used as a bus shelter (as distinct from those shelters in the next category, which were specifically designed as \\"bus\\" type shelters). About half of the surviving park shelters had concrete blast walls, while half used brick. The second design was the pillbox with single-cantilevered roof slab, or \\"bus\\" type shelter, as it was called in the original Brisbane City Council list. These were designed so that the three brick blast walls could be removed after the war, leaving a concrete back wall and five brick piers at the front. Again, entrances were at each end of the front wall. Of the 19 \\"bus\\" types listed only two survive, at Newmarket and Newstead. The third design was also a \\"bus\\" type shelter, but it was built with a stone rear wall, instead of concrete, and six stone piers were later added, instead of five brick piers. The three brick blast walls could be removed as normal. Two of these \\"colonnade\\" types were built- referred to in the Brisbane City Council list as \\"bus (stone)\\"- and only one survives, at King Edward Park. Most of the Brisbane structures built for the war were removed at the end of World War Two. The saltwater mains, slit trenches, and sirens disappeared, as did the many standard pillboxes that had stood in the middle of the streets of the Central Business District. 156 standard pillboxes were built, but none of the surviving public shelters in Brisbane City Council ownership are of that design. Of the 21 special shelters, only the one on Queens Wharf Road survives. However, of Costello's 58 reusable public surface shelters, 20 have survived; the removal of their blast walls, as planned, had given them a renewed purpose. The worker's shelters at the Story Bridge Hotel and Howard Smith Wharves also still exist. The blast walls of the air raid shelter at Morningside were removed according to plan after World War Two, although evidence of the location of the walls is still visible. The shelter roof and piers have been painted and the floor slab has been covered with concrete pebble topping.  Description  The concrete structure in 2015 The Morningside air raid shelter is a rectangular concrete structure comprising a heavy floor slab, which is now covered by concrete pebbling, and a flat roof supported by concrete piers. There is also a coloured mosaic on the western side of the floor slab. There is evidence on the soffit of the two entrances on the Wynnum Road side. The shelter stands within a vegetated road reserve, west of the Morningside Railway Station, with a canopy of mature fig trees and camphor laurels. The roof of the shelter is painted maroon and the piers are painted cream.  Heritage listing  Morningside Air Raid Shelter was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 6 April 2005 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Morningside air raid is important as a part of the Air Raid Precaution activities that were implemented for the defence of Brisbane during World War Two. Designed to afford protection to the civilian population of Brisbane in the event of air raid attacks or other emergencies, the air raid shelter located at the corner of Wynnum Road and Thynne Road is important in demonstrating the impact of World War Two on the civilian population of Brisbane. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. Although many air raid shelters were constructed during World War Two in Queensland, comparatively few survive. Also, there are not many types of structures built by the Brisbane City Council during World War Two, for wartime purposes, which survive. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The shelter's solid construction, rectangular shape, and its siting near a population concentration, demonstrate the principal characteristics of a World War Two Brisbane public air raid shelter. The place is important in demonstrating a high degree of creative or technical achievement at a particular period. The Morningside air raid shelter, now used as a road reserve shelter, demonstrates the secondary uses that were part of the original design intention. The shelter is a durable example of innovative design and use of concrete technology during World War Two. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The air raid shelter is important as an example of the wartime work of the City Architect's Office and particularly the work of City Architect F.G. Costello.

It was designed by Francis Richard Hall and built from 1931 to 1934 by George Alexander Stronach. It was also known as the AMP Building. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992. The MacArthur Chambers building and sites adjacent to the building, comprising an entire city block, were redeveloped in the late 1990s, creating the shopping mall MacArthur Central. In 2016, MacArthur Chambers contains the MacArthur Chambers Apartment Hotel, the MacArthur Museum and an Apple Store.  History  This building was constructed between 1931 and 1934 as the Queensland headquarters of the Australian Mutual Provident Society (AMP), replacing two earlier AMP buildings on the site (built in 1877-1879 and 1885). The AMP Society was formed in Sydney, New South Wales in 1848-1849 under the Friendly Society's Act of 1843, and was one of a number of benefit and friendly societies established in the Australian colonies in the mid to late 19th century. Founded by a group of prominent Sydney philanthropists, the AMP Society initially offered life assurance policies, endowments and annuities aimed principally at ensuring that women and children were not left destitute on the death of the principal income earner. Growth in the early 1850s was slow, but in 1857 the Society was incorporated by act of parliament, and by the 1890s it was the most prominent of the Australian benefit and insurance societies, with a worldwide reputation. AMP Building built in 1885, prior to its demolition circa 1932 The first Queensland office (an agency) was opened in Brisbane in 1875. Purpose-designed offices were erected for the AMP in Brisbane in 1877-1879 and 1885 at the corner of Queen and Edward Streets, but these were replaced by the 1931-1934 building. It was a measure of the success of the society that its new Queensland headquarters were erected during the worst years of the 1930s depression. Designed by established Brisbane architects Francis Richard Hall and Harold M Cook, the offices were constructed by local master builder George A Stronach (overseer Thomas Percy) with technical supervision by consulting Brisbane structural engineer RJ McWilliam, for approximately . Contemporary reports described the quality Australian materials, the high standard of craftsmanship, and the modern engineering techniques employed. The marble used throughout the building came from New South Wales and the building was faced with Helidon freestone. The granite used for the base was tested by the University of Queensland before construction, and was declared to be the finest granite in existence, with a crushing strength of per square inch. Queensland company Evans Deakin & Co. Ltd manufactured the of steelwork used in the building. The five girders spanning the ground floor banking chamber have a span of and each weighs . Construction of the steel framework using bolts rather than rivets was considered particularly innovative in Brisbane in 1932. AMP Statuary on MacArthur Chambers, 2012 The emblematic statuary above the main entrance in Queen Street was carved by Fred Gowan of Sydney from Sicilian marble. The tableau illustrates the Society's motto Amicus certus in re incerta (a certain friend in uncertain times) and depicts an erect female figure, with a cornucopia by her right side, holding the palm of victory in her left hand. To her left is a seated woman and child; to her right a seated male. Until when the logo was changed, an Amicus tableau was erected on almost every AMP building, and usually was removed when the Society no longer occupied the premises. However, when the Society moved to new premises in Brisbane in 1978, the Amicus tableau remained on the Queen Street building. The ground floor contained the vestibule, the manager's office and a spacious banking chamber, . The board room with adjoining luncheon room was on the eighth floor and featured a parquetry floor of Queensland timbers. Staff offices and facilities were provided on the seventh, eighth and ninth floors. The remainder of the building was tenanted. The AMP building was one of several high-rise buildings erected in Queen Street in the 1920s and early 1930s. These included Ascot Chambers (1925), National Mutual Life Building (1926) and Colonial Mutual Life Building (1931, now the Manor Apartment Hotel). The AMP building was officially opened on Friday 2 March 1934 by the Queensland Governor, Sir Leslie Orme Wilson. General Douglas MacArthur and Mrs Jean Marie MacArthur, Brisbane, 1942 Because of its central location and reinforced concrete roof, the building was used as the headquarters of the Allied Forces in the South- West Pacific during the Second World War. Tenants were compulsorily evacuated under military orders from 21 July 1942 until 14 June 1945. The AMP Society reserved the basement and part of the ground floor, while the Commander-in- Chief of Allied Forces in South West Pacific Area, General Douglas MacArthur occupied the board room and his staff occupied the remainder of the building. After the Second World War the building reverted to its former use as the AMP's Queensland headquarters until February 1978 when the Society moved to AMP Place in Eagle Street. In 1979 the ground and mezzanine floors were refurbished and leased as retail premises and offices. The building was re- opened and named MacArthur Chambers in honour of General MacArthur. In November 1990 the Brisbane City Council acquired MacArthur Chambers. The MacArthur Chambers building and sites adjacent to the building, comprising an entire city block, were redeveloped in the late 1990s, creating the shopping mall MacArthur Central. In 2016, MacArthur Chambers contains the MacArthur Chambers Apartment Hotel, the MacArthur Museum and an Apple Store which was redeveloped and is owned by the Precision Group.  Description  MacArthur Chambers, an interwar commercial building, is located on the corner of Queen and Edward Streets. Comprising nine storeys with an attic and basement, the building has a concrete encased steel frame with an external shell consisting of a granite base and Helidon freestone facing. The street facades are arranged symmetrically. The openings on the ground level are all arched. The stone facing of the ground and first floor levels is separated into horizontal bands which radiate from around the arches imitating voussoirs. These continue up the side bays of the building to the top level. The central bays, between the second and seventh floors have flush stonework. The three central bays above the seventh floor have a Corinthian colonnade that corresponds to that on the ground level. A dentilled cornice line occurs above ground level above which is a plinth with balusters in front of the window openings. Another horizontal cornice line runs at the seventh floor level which has a plinth above it. The entablature has a large dentilled cornice supporting a parapet with a raised section corresponding to the three central bays. The Edward Street facade is longer but also symmetrical. The central window bays are flanked by rusticated bands of stonework in the central portion of the building. On each side are two other bays and a banded rusticated corner bay. At the ground floor level the entry is emphasised only by a portico of pilasters over these three bays. At the first floor level on both facades the windows in the flush bays are surmounted by pediments supported on brackets. The middle opening on this level of the Edward Street facade has a curved pediment, while the middle opening on the Queen Street facade has an archway with the emblematic statuary situated in front of it. The whole building is set on a polished grey granite plinth which incorporates stairs leading up to each entry. Internally the main banking chamber retains much of its plaster detailing but it has all been painted a cream colour. The entry vestibule to this space has a vaulted coffered ceiling. The Edward Street entry retains its original doors and apart from the lifts much of the original lobby with its marble staircase extending to the top level of the building remains. The window suites in the building are mostly original. On the eighth floor a section of the building has been set aside as a museum to commemorate MacArthur's occupancy.

Waddington (May 10, 1911 ‚Äì June 4, 1981) was an American Democratic Party politician who served as Majority Leader of the New Jersey State Senate. Early life He was a graduate of the University of Delaware. He was a teacher at Salem High School, and later worked as a personnel director for the du Pont Corporation of Delaware As a Quaker, Waddington claimed a religious exemption during World War II. After the war, he did relief and rehabilitation work in Italy with the American Friends Service Committee (Quakers). New Jersey State Assemblyman He was elected to the New Jersey General Assembly from the district encompassing Salem County in 1953. He defeated Republican Peter B. Hoff, who had served as an Assemblyman since 1944. New Jersey State Senator Waddington was elected to the New Jersey State Senate in 1955, representing Salem County. He defeated incumbent Republican Senator John M. Summerill by 1,138 votes, 9,836 (53.05%) to 8,698 (46.92%). He was re-elected in 1959, defeating former Assemblyman Hoff (whom Waddington unseated in the 1953 Assembly race) by 4,043 votes, 12,215 (59.92%) to 8,172 (40.08%). He won a third term in 1963, defeating Republican Joseph Narrow by 5,253 votes, 13,665 (61.86%) to 8,412 (38.08%). He had to run again in 1965 after the U.S. Supreme Court, in Reynolds v. Sims (more commonly known as One Man, One Vote), required redistricting by state legislatures for congressional districts to keep represented populations equal, as well as requiring both houses of state legislatures to have districts drawn that contained roughly equal populations, and to perform redistricting when needed. Because of its population, Salem and Cumberland counties were merged into one district (district 2) with one Senator. Cumberland County was represented by Senator Robert H. Weber, a Democrat from Greenwich Township. Since both Salem and Cumberland Counties were being merged, only one Democratic Senator could represent the party. In order to avoid a primary election fight between Waddington and Weber, the Democratic party bosses got together in a meeting and decided that Waddington would be the candidate. Weber was made Waddington's campaign manager. The Democrats, thinking that they had avoided a primary fight, were met with yet another surprise. Another Quaker who attended the Salem Friends Meeting with John Waddington, threw his hat in the ring in the Democratic Primary. He was Kenneth R. Jones of Greenwich. He was a school teacher from Bridgeton and had previously taught in Salem. He declared himself as an \\"Independent Democrat.\\" Mr. Jones carried a lot of support amongst the school teachers in both counties. However, Waddington beat Jones soundly in the June primary with Jones getting just under 1000 votes as compared to Waddington getting over 3000 votes. In the general election, John A. Waddington defeated Cumberland County Republican Chairman John J. Spoltore, a former Mayor of Bridgeton, by 7,902 votes, 32,292 (56.92%) to 24,390 (42.99%). He won Salem County by a 2-1 margin, and carried Cumberland by a narrow 577 vote margin. Waddington served as Senate Minority Leader in 1958 and 1966, and as the Senate Majority Leader in 1967. New rounds of court battles and redistricting forced Waddington to run again in 1967, in an election cycle that was less favorable toward Democrats (it was the mid-term election of the second term of Democratic Governor Richard J. Hughes). This time Waddington ran in the 3rd district, specifically Assembly district 3A, which included all of Salem County and part of Gloucester County. He was defeated by two-term Republican Assemblyman John L. White (R-Gloucester) by 4,830 votes, 28,456 (54.6%) to 23,635 (45.4%). Waddington won Salem County by 3,328 votes, but White's margin in the Gloucester County part of the district was 8,149. Salem County Freeholder After losing his Senate seat, Waddington was elected to the Salem County Board of Freeholders and served as Freeholder Director. Candidate for Governor of New Jersey In 1973, Waddington explored a bid for the Democratic nomination for Governor of New Jersey. He was one of five candidates to be interviewed by a special committee of ten Democratic County Chairmen formed by Democratic State Chairman Salvatore Bontempo in an effort to unite the party establishment behind a single challenger to Republican Governor William T. Cahill. Waddington decided against entering the race, which was ultimately won by Brendan Byrne. New Jersey Director of Motor Vehicles Governor Byrne appointed him to serve as the Director of the New Jersey Division of Motor Vehicles in 1974. His nomination was confirmed by the State Senate 39-0. Death Waddington died in 1981, at age 70.

It is also known as Naval Brigade Stores and Naval Depot. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992. Brisbane-based adventure company, Riverlife Adventure Centre, operates from the Naval Stores premises.  History  Naval stores, seen from the Brisbane River (historic) The original Naval Stores comprised a pair of two-storeyed iron-clad stud-framed buildings and a wharf, which were constructed between 1886 and 1888. The complex has been used throughout its naval and army history for two main purposes, as a storage depot and for training. Naval stores, as seen from the Brisbane River, 2015 In 1884, at the height of the Russian war scare, the Queensland colonial government commissioned two gunboats, the Gayundah and Paluma. In 1885 the gunboats arrived and with the government's acquisition of other vessels the development of a naval depot for storage, repairs and training became necessary. The Naval Stores were built on the site of a former Kangaroo Point quarry (now known as the Kangaroo Point Cliffs). The ground floor of Store No 1 contained the battery and lecture rooms used for training. The four rooms upstairs were used for stores and carpenters' shops. By 1913 upstairs was partitioned to provide for an orderly room, instructors' mess room and several small storerooms. Store No 2 originally consisted of two large rooms on either floor, with workshops on the ground floor. The first floor storerooms included the torpedo store room. After the 1893 floods, Store No 1 boat shed was replaced with a detached shed, a bridge linking the two stores was built, and an extension to the cliff stairs was added. About 1900 several additions to the site included the paint store, magazine, turntable between the stores and some first floor ceilings were lined. The wooden stairs provide access up the cliff to Amesbury Street and St Mary's Anglican Church which has been the Naval Chapel for many years. The stairs have been extended over the years. As the Queensland Naval Brigade developed, further depots were located at Maryborough, Rockhampton, Townsville, Cairns and Cooktown. Other colonies also developed their naval and military forces. The depot was the base of the Queensland Navy until the formation of the Royal Australian Navy after Federation. Radio communication history was made in 1903 when the first Australian ship to use wireless telegraphy, the Gayundah, sent signals from Moreton Bay to the Stores. Alterations to the stores and additional structures were built during the occupation of the site by the Royal Australian Navy. The RAN Reserve vacated the site in 1959 and it was occupied by the Australian Army till 1984. In 1984, two breech-loading Armstrong forward guns from the Gayundah and Paluma were recovered. One gun and its mount have been lent to the Queensland Maritime Museum Association. The flagpoles, semaphore and several other structures have disappeared since 1984. In 1987 the property was purchased by the Brisbane City Council, tenders were called for its development and a fire partially destroyed Store No 1. The unoccupied Store No 2 has suffered degradation from vandals and white ant infestation.  Description  The complex stands on a narrow strip of river flat with steep cliffs and includes the following items: * Store No 1 (1886‚Äì88), the ground floor and charred remnants of the first floor are all that remain as a result of the 1987 fire. Prior to the fire, style and construction were similar to that of Store No 2. * Store No 2 (1886‚Äì88) is smaller in floor size. It has two gablets with hoists and two pairs of ventilators. There are pairs of board doors and a set of wooden stairs inside and outside provides access to the first floor. It has a hardwood frame clad with corrugated iron. The ground floor is concrete with concrete footings and stone plinths and the roof has twin gables. Sash windows are multi-paned and protected by sunhoods. Walls and ceilings are lined with tongue and groove boards. At the northern end is a skillion roofed smithy and forge. * Wharf (1887‚Äì88) is an integral part of the stores. Wooden piles support the wooden decking and stanchions. The wharf has been resheeted with diagonal boarding over the original. * Wooden stairs (c.1890) connect various parts of the complex and are currently in a very dilapidated state and unsafe for public use. * Turntable (c.1900), for manoeuvring guns to and from ships. Only the outline remains. * Paint store (c.1900), a one room timber structure on stumps with a corrugated iron hip roof. * Magazine (c.1900), a single room weatherboard structure with corrugated iron gable roof and brick stumps. * Slip (c.1900) is concrete and has been extended over the years. * Duty hut, a one room weatherboard structure with corrugated iron pyramid roof that is lined internally. * Changing rooms, timber with sloping corrugated iron roof; built on the foundations of the 1890s boat shed. * Toilet facilities, a timber and corrugated iron structure. The site remains a strong visual element of the riverscape.  Heritage listing  Naval Stores (former) was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The former Naval Stores provide evidence of the Queensland Marine Defence Force which was an integral part of the Queensland colonial defences. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The former Naval Stores are significant as part of the historic cityscape at Kangaroo Point which includes the former Kangaroo Point quarry, St Mary's Church group and the linking cliff face stairs. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Stores are significant for their continuous association with both colonial and Commonwealth defence forces.

Plot Elena (Nina Dobrev) asks Damon (Ian Somerhalder) what he knows about Stefan (Paul Wesley) but Damon tells her that Stefan is gone. Elena tries to convince him that since Stefan called her is a sign that he is not gone. When Damon refuses to help her, she goes to Alaric (Matt Davis) and she finds out what Stefan and Klaus (Joseph Morgan) are doing; tracking werewolves. Carol (Susan Walters) puts vervain into Tyler‚Äôs (Michael Trevino) coffee to test if he is a vampire and she is relieved when she sees that it does not affect him. She then calls Bill (Jack Coleman) for help while Tyler meets Elena to help her gather information about werewolves. Tyler shows her a location in Tennessee where werewolves might be and Elena asks Alaric to go with her at the Smokey Mountains otherwise she will go alone leaving him no choice. The two of them start their trip and while being on the road, Damon appears since Alaric called him and told him about Elena‚Äôs plan. Stefan and Klaus are still at Tennessee reaching at Ray‚Äôs pack at the Smokey Mountains with Ray (David Gallagher) still being dead. Klaus introduces himself to the pack and explains what he wants from them. When Ray wakes up, he makes him complete his transformation and then Klaus makes the rest of the werewolves hybrids as well. After the transformation, something is not right and all the new hybrids eventually die with Klaus not understanding what went wrong. In the meantime, Ray runs away and Stefan goes to find him but Ray bites him and runs away again. Elena, Alaric and Damon run into Ray and Ray attacks Damon. The three of them manage to knock him down and tie him up on the tree to protect themselves. Ray starts to transform sooner than what they thought and they start running to get out of the mountains the sooner as possible. Ray (as wolf) gets to them and Damon makes him chase him to keep Elena and Alaric safe. The two start fighting when Stefan arrives and kills Ray. Stefan asks Damon again to stop searching for him, take Elena home and make her forget about him. Matt (Zach Roerig) and Tyler talk while Tyler drinks from the coffee Matt brought him. He feels the same weird taste he felt in the morning and Matt tells him that it is the taste of vervain. Tyler realizes that his mother was testing him and he asks her why. When he realizes that she knows about Caroline (Candice Accola) but not about him being a werewolf, he takes her to the Lockwood old property to see him while he transforms into a wolf. When Tyler gets back to his human form, Carol promises him that she will make sure nothing will happen to Caroline. She calls Bill to tell him not to hurt Caroline but he disagrees. Jeremy (Steven R. McQueen) tells Matt that he saw Vicki (Kayla Ewell) again asking him to help her. He convinces Matt to help him contact her to find out what she needs. When Vicki appears again, she tells Jeremy that she can come back but she needs his help to do it. Right after, Anna (Malese Jow) appears to tell Jeremy not to bring Vicki back. The episode ends with Damon visiting Elena to tell her that he was wrong about Stefan and that he will help her bring him back and Caroline waking up tied up in a basement. She calls for help and when Bill appears it is revealed that he is her father.

(Other union territories don't have an elected government and legislative assembly. Puducherry, National Capital Territory of Delhi and Jammu and Kashmir (union territory) are the three territories which have democratically elected governments like Indian states.)  Government and administration  = Lieutenant Governor = The Lt. Governor is appointed by the President for a term of five years. The executive and legislative powers lie with the Chief Minister and his council of ministers, who are appointed by the President. The Governors of the states and territories of India have similar powers and functions at the state level as that of the President of India at Union level. Only Indian citizens above 35 years of age are eligible for appointment. Governors discharge all constitutional functions such as the appointment of the Chief Minister, sending reports to the President about failure of constitutional machinery in a state, or with respect to issues relating to the assent to a bill passed by legislature, exercise or their own opinion. Kiran Bedi is the present governor. The Governor enjoys many different types of powers: #Executive powers related to administration, appointments and removals. #Legislative powers related to lawmaking and the state legislature. #Discretionary powers to be carried out according to the discretion of the Governor. Raj Niwas, Puducherry, official residence of the Lieutenant Governor of Puducherry The legislative branch comprises the governor and the legislative assembly, which is the highest political organ in state. The governor has the power to summon the assembly or to close the same. All members of the legislative assembly are directly elected, normally once in every five years by the eligible voters who are above 18 years of age. The current assembly consists of 30 elected members and 3 members nominated by Central Government.The elected members select one of its own members as its chairman who is called the speaker. The speaker is assisted by the deputy speaker who is also elected by the members. The conduct of meeting in the house is the responsibility of the Speaker. The main function of the assembly is to pass laws and rules. Every bill passed by the house has to be finally approved by the governor before it becomes applicable. The normal term of the legislative assembly is five years from the date appointed for its first meeting.

Every judge including the Chief Justice is appointed by the President of India by Warrant under his hand and seal. Every permanent and additional judge will continue in office until the age of 62. =Executive= Puducherry Legislative Assembly Building Like in other Indian states, the Executive arm of the state is responsible for the day-to-day management of the state. It consists of the Governor, the Chief Minister and the Council of Ministers. The Chief Minister and the council of ministers also have been appointed by the governor.

It was designed by Robin Dods and built from 1851 to 1930s. It is also known as Anzac Hostel, Ravenscott, and Shafston International College. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 7 February 2005.  History  Shafston House comprises a group of buildings constructed between 1851 and the 1930s, set in substantial grounds with frontage to the Brisbane River. The main house was constructed in several stages between 1851 and 1904. The southern part of Kangaroo Point along the riverfront as far as Norman Creek was surveyed into acreage allotments by James Warner in mid-1850. The Rev. Robert Creyke (Church of England) purchased from the Crown two of these allotments (eastern suburban allotments 44 and 45) containing just over 10 acres with frontage to the Brisbane River, just within the Brisbane town boundary. A deed of grant was issued to him in November 1851. On portion 44 he constructed a single-storeyed house that he called Ravenscott. Creyke joined a number of Brisbane's early gentry and pastoralists from the hinterland who, in the 1840s and 1850s, established town estates along the Brisbane River, most of them just outside the official town boundaries. These included Newstead House (1846) near Breakfast Creek, Toogoolawah (later Bulimba House), (1849‚Äì50) across the river from Newstead, Riversdale (now Mowbray Park, early 1850s), Milton House ( or 1853) just beyond the western town boundary and Eskgrove (1853) downstream from Shafston and Riversdale. An 1851, sketch of Ravenscott attributed to visiting artist Conrad Martins shows a long, single-storeyed, low-set residence with verandahs and hipped roof, overlooking the Brisbane River. The grounds were mostly cleared and included outbuildings, the whole enclosed by a post and rail fence. In December 1852, Creyke's Kangaroo Point property was transferred to Darling Downs pastoralist and politician Henry Stuart Russell, who in his memoirs states that he \\"completed\\" the house and renamed it Shafston, likely after his wife's birthplace in Jamaica. This implies that the core of Shafston House incorporates the earlier Ravenscott. Russell also purchased a number of neighbouring blocks to create a town riverine estate of over 44 acres (17.6 hectares). In April 1854, Russell advertised Shafston for letting or sale. At this time the house, constructed of brick and stone, contained a drawing room and dining room separated by folding doors, five large bedrooms, closets and a roomy pantry. A passage long ran nearly the length of the house. Beneath the drawing room was a stone dairy, larder and wine-cellar high. There was a verandah in length. At the rear, attached via a covered way, was a brick service block, which included a large kitchen (stone flagged), two servants' bedrooms, large laundry, store rooms and offices. Off the laundry was a drying yard enclosed by a paling fence. A large brick outbuilding contained a two- stall stables, coach-house, harness room and 2 grooms' rooms, with a loft over all. Other improvements included a fowl-house, well and a garden of about 3 acres enclosed by a paling fence. The whole property, which comprised approximately 44 acres, was enclosed with a four-rail hardwood fence. Most of the improvements had been made within the previous 18 months (that is, since late 1852 when Russell had acquired the property). Shafston did not sell in 1854 and was offered for sale again in October 1855. By this time Russell had vacated the premises and it was operating as a boarding house. The ground floor comprised 8 rooms, staircase and china closet and had hardwood joists and flooring. There was a verandah front and back, the front verandah being long and wide, under which there were three spacious cellars. French doors opened onto the front verandah. The dining and drawing rooms were separated by folding doors. The attic contained three rooms, two of which were large enough to make suitable bedrooms \\"if required\\". This suggests that the 5 bedrooms mentioned in the 1854 advertisement were all located on the ground floor. Attached was a kitchen, servants' rooms and pantry, with a verandah at the front. There was a substantial stable . Again the property did not sell. Tenants in the 1850s included Nehemiah Bartley and Brisbane solicitor Daniel Foley Roberts and his family. A sketch of Shafston dated shows a substantial, single-storeyed house with a front verandah, a high-pitched roof, attic rooms and three dormer windows overlooking the Brisbane River. Title to the estate was transferred to grazier and sugar-grower Louis Hope in October 1859. It appears that Hope did not reside at Shafston. Gilbert Eliot, Speaker of the Queensland Parliament, tenanted Shafston House from 1860 to 1871 and tenants in the 1870s included William Barker of Telemon Station and Dr and Mrs Henry Challinor. In 1875, Hope subdivided the property and in late 1876, during William Barker's tenancy, Shafston House on just over 4 acres (1.6 hectares) of riverfront land was advertised for sale. The house contained 9 rooms on the ground floor and had changed little since 1854: a brick and stone house with a roof of hardwood shingles and iron, drawing room (\\"the largest and coolest to be found in any private family in this colony\\"), dining room, five bedrooms, closets, dressing and bath rooms, kitchen and about six servants' apartments, a large brick stable with two stalls, coach-house, man's room and hay-house and galvanised iron and underground water storage tanks. No sale was transacted at this time and in August 1881 the same advertisement was run in the Brisbane Courier. In mid-1883 Shafston House was transferred to Mary Jane Foster, wife of Charles Milne Foster of Brisbane ironmongers Foster and Kelk. Foster had learnt the family ironmongery business in Lincoln, Yorkshire and after emigrating to Queensland he established in Brisbane with his brother-in- law the successful ironmongery firm of Foster and Kelk. The Fosters, who resided at Shafston House until 1896, reputedly remodelled the house in the early 1880s, the architect for this work thought to be former Queensland Colonial Architect, FDG Stanley. The remodelling at this period appears to have included replacing the verandahs in their present form, adding the entry portico and more elaborate and picturesque Gothic detailing. The bay windows also were probably added at this time. In the late 1890s and early 1900s the house was occupied sequentially by tenants E. B. Bland, manager of the BISN Company; John F McMullen; and William Gray of Webster & Co. Building detail, 2015 By 1903 pastoralist James Henry McConnel of Cressbrook in the Brisbane River Valley, had occupied Shafston House as his family's town house. Title to the property was transferred to him in 1904 and in that year he commissioned noted Brisbane architect Robin Smith Dods to undertake a third renovation of the house. Dods' contribution appears to have been the elaborate timber work in the front hall and the two main public rooms (drawing and dining rooms) and likely the windows in the dormers. His work includes decorative elements like the fireplaces, timber fretwork to the entrance and the cupboard below the stair. Shafston House remained the McConnel home until and in 1915 it was leased to the Creche and Kindergarten Association as a teacher training centre. In 1919, in the aftermath of the Great War of 1914-1918, the property was acquired by the Commonwealth government and converted into an Anzac Hostel for the care and treatment of totally and permanently incapacitated ex- servicemen. Anzac Hostels were established in most Australian states at this period. At this time the property consisted of the main house, kitchen block, stables and a bush house. The 1919 alterations were extensive. The main house initially served both hostel and administrative functions, with the former drawing room being converted into a ward, the dining room retaining its original function and the bedrooms occupied as nurses room, matron's room, etc. A study and a bedroom at the western end of the house were combined by the removal of a wall to create a recreation room. The attic level, which in 1919 was a single open space, was partitioned into bedrooms for nurses and a box room, with the landing retained as a common room. The kitchen courtyard was roofed and two new rooms were constructed in that space. A timber laundry block was constructed to the south of the kitchen and the stables were converted into orderlies' quarters. To accommodate the returned servicemen a large open-sided ward block was erected in the terraced front grounds to the northeast of the house in 1919, connected to the house via a covered way. This single-storeyed building was high-set on stumps with an attached ablutions block on the eastern side. It demonstrated aspects of public health theory, especially the benefits of fresh air in the recuperative process and in maintaining good health, popular at the time. Theory was translated into practice in a number of government designs for public buildings such as open- sided school blocks and hospital wards in the 1910s and early 1920s. Anzac Hostel received its first patients on 19 July 1920 and functioned as a repatriation hospital until . In the late 1920s and 1930s the Commonwealth subdivided and sold the southern part of the property, reducing the house grounds to just over 2 acres (0.8 hectare). At this time the early brick stables building, which was located on the subdivided land, was demolished and replaced in 1928 by a small timber building constructed to the northwest of the house as quarters for orderlies working at the hostel. This building comprised three rooms and a verandah and toilets at the rear. The 1919 laundry block was moved to a position just east of the kitchen block and a new garage was constructed in the southwest corner of the remaining grounds, near Thorn Street. In 1937 the East Brisbane Postal Depot was constructed for the Postmaster General's Department in the southwest corner of the property, between Thorn Street and the hostel garage. It comprised a single room, . A large 'L'-shaped extension was erected in 1951, for use as a mail sorting room. From 1969 to 1987 the property was occupied by the Royal Australian Air Force. The change in use necessitated a number of alterations to the fabric of the place, including rearrangements of offices, installation of a bar and fire-escapes, upgrading of bathroom facilities, new floor finishes, enclosure of verandahs and the enclosing of the previously open sub-floor in the main house. A garage and store were erected between the ward block and the river. Work to the grounds included new paving, new fences along the street frontages, new street entrances, new driveways, parking areas and tree planting along the Castlebar Street and southern boundaries. By 1981 the main house was used as an administrative headquarters and mess and as offices for the RAAF police; a Movement Control Centre had been established in the ward block; the headquarters of the Queensland Air Training Corps was located in the former kitchen block; the RAAF Public Relations and Photographic Section was accommodated in the garage/former postal depot; and the former orderlies building had been converted into a tavern. In 1978 the cultural heritage significance of Shafston House was recognised by its inclusion in the Commonwealth Register of the National Estate and in the 1980s conservation work carried out on the main house. In 1988 Shafston House was leased to a Brisbane entrepreneur under two consecutive ninety-nine year leases. After failing to gain local government approval for use of the property as a restaurant and function venue, the house was refurbished as a residence. The 1919 laundry was demolished and a new garage constructed adjacent to the early kitchen building. The ward block was refurbished, additional bathrooms installed in the house and changes were made to landscaping. In 1994 the lease was transferred to another entrepreneur and in 1995/96 the property was redeveloped as part of the Shafston International College. The main house was refurbished, with some loss of reconstructed colour schemes, and the link to the kitchen wing enclosed with a new sitting room. Further substantial works were carried out to the grounds and other buildings in the grounds, including enclosure of the open-air ward. A concrete board walk and new retaining walls were installed on the river frontage to Brisbane City Council requirements. The property was converted to freehold title between 1998 and 2002.  Description  View from riverside lawn, 2015 Shafston house stands on a large site which slopes down to the Brisbane river at Kangaroo Point. Buildings include the original house and its kitchen (1851), the former ward block (1919), the former orderlies' accommodation (1928), the former postal depot (1936), a recent garage and a very recent two-storeyed adjacent to the kitchen. The one-storey brick and stone residence features a highly pitched gabled roof, attic rooms and cellars. The walls rest on foundations of Brisbane tuff and the roof, once shingled and then slated, is clad with terracotta tiles. To the rear is the original detached brick service wing, also on a Brisbane tuff stone foundation. The style is Gothic-revival, with exterior decoration including: elaborate plaster mouldings to bargeboards; timber pendants in the gables; dormers; and quoining to the projecting front gables. The southern front projection features a bay window with corrugated iron roof and awning. At the northern end, French doors open onto a faceted balcony with a steeply-pitched iron roof and cast-iron balustrading of a circle and cross-brace pattern. The main entrance is defined by a rendered masonry portico off-set to the south of the small front verandah. Internal walls are mostly rendered brick and the floorboards are of pine. The main reception rooms feature coffered ceilings. The ornate friezes, cornices and dados in the principal rooms, which were restored in the early 1980s, are thought to date from the 1880s. Joinery throughout is of cedar, with the early twentieth century renovations reflecting the influence of the Art Nouveau movement. The extent of RS Dods changes are not known but the fireplaces and much of the internal joinery and panelling, especially in the stairwell and doorways, are attributed to him. Dods probably added the diagonally glazed window panes in the upper windows. A number of other structures have been erected in the grounds, the most significant of which is the large ward block constructed in 1919. This is a single-storey low-set timber building on stumps. The ward was designed as open-sided, but has since been excavated under to allow for the construction of new accommodation, enclosed and extended and substantial changes made to the immediate setting. The fine entrance gateway from Castlebar Street with cast iron gates and posts and adjoining cast iron fence set on sandstone plinths and pillars survive as some of the early fencing. The form of the driveway sweeping around the front of the house from Castlebar to Thorn Street can be distinguished, but these have been paved and parking bays added. Some stone paving from the kerb to the property boundary at Castlebar Street remains. The terraced lawn between the house and the river remains reasonably intact, but remaining areas have been much altered to provide paving and parking. Some large and mature trees on the northwest boundary survive including a fig tree near the former orderlies cottage. Close to the river some brick and stone retaining walls of an apparently early date survive.  Heritage listing  Shafston House was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 7 February 2005 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Constructed as a single-storeyed house in 1851 with significant modifications -53, early 1880s and 1904, Shafston House is one of a small group of riverine estate residences surviving in Brisbane from the pre-separation period and is important in demonstrating the early pattern of Queensland's history. The house is situated in an elevated position and maintains strong visual links with the river looking over a large terraced lawn, the general form of which remains intact. Of the surviving 1840s and 1850s riverine houses in Brisbane, only Newstead House (1846) and Shafston House (1851) retain this relationship with the river. The house retained its status as a gentleman's residence for over 60 years during which time it was associated with a number of prominent persons who helped shape the pattern of development of Queensland, including Rev. Robert Creyke who began construction of the house in 1851, Darling Downs pastoralist and politician Henry Stuart Russell who completed the house in 1852 in its Gothic form and named the property \\"Shafston\\", the Hon. Louis Hope who owned the property from 1859 to the early 1880s, the Foster family (of ironmongers Foster & Kelk) who reputedly remodelling the house in the early 1880s and pastoralist James Henry McConnel of Cressbrook whose family commissioned the architect RS Dods to further modify the house. The property is significant also for its later development and function as an Anzac Hostel (1919-) for the care and treatment of totally and permanently incapacitated ex-servicemen, illustrating the impact of the first and second world wards on Australia and how this nation dealt with that impact. It was the only Anzac Hostel in Queensland developed as a long term hostel for totally and permanently incapacitated servicemen returning from the Great War and is one of only two remaining former first world war repatriation hospitals in Queensland, the other being Rosemount at Windsor. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. Shafston House has rarity value as one of the earliest houses surviving in Brisbane. It is probably the third oldest house in the metropolitan area, after Newstead House (1846) and Bulimba House (1849-50) and a rare surviving remnant of a riverine estate of a type typical in the early development of Brisbane. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. Evidence of the 1850s house lies within the existing structure and has potential to reveal evidence of 1850s construction methods in Queensland, which is uncommon. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. With its stone cellars, attic rooms, detached brick service block, terraced grounds and river frontage, its decorative detailing and demarcation between public and private spaces and between \\"family\\" and \\"servant\\" areas, Shafston House is important in demonstrating in its form, materials, design, layout, size and detailing the principal characteristics of its class: an evolving, substantial, mid-19th century middle-class riverine house. Since 1851 the house has retained its original siting in an estate overlooking the river, a river frontage and the visual link between the house and the river. The main rooms, in particular the drawing room and dining room contain rare evidence of elaborate high Victorian taste with painted dados and friezes and elaborate joinery and mantlepieces. The character of the internal refurbishment by Dods also survives. The drawing room and dining room contain the best evidence of Dods internal refurbishment but also contain bay windows attributed to Stanley. Decorative elements like the fireplaces, timber fretwork to the entrance and the cupboard below the stair and upstairs details, including the dormers, have been attributed to Dods. Several outbuildings associated with the repatriation hospital were constructed during this period, including an open-air ward (1919), garage () and orderlies' quarters (1928). These are important to our understanding of how the place functioned as a hospital. The former Ward Block built in 1919 in a pavilion form demonstrates the plan typical of smaller hospitals of the time providing two wards separated by smaller rooms and is typical in its lightweight timber construction. The siting to catch breezes and enhance airflow characterises health practices that were considered important at the time. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Shafston House is an evolving house with major renovations in the 1850s, 1880s and 1900s, that has maintained a cohesive aesthetic appeal. The aesthetic significance is engendered principally by the picturesque values of the Victorian Gothic style of architecture (including the decorative detailing) and the garden layout and riverside setting. Although overlaid by the later work of the architects Stanley and Dods, the characteristics of the style remain. The verandahs and entrance porch introduced in the 1880s and the interior joinery introduced in the early 1900s make further aesthetic contributions. The place is a landmark along the Brisbane River and in views from New Farm across the river and makes a significant aesthetic contribution to the Brisbane riverscape.

History  Zuhair Fayez Partnership was established in 1975 as Zuhair Fayez and Associates and started with a small number of professional architects, engineers, planners, and support staff. The growing number of commissions and projects eventually prompted the organization to open an office in London to meet the demand. Eight departments were initially formed: Design, Architectural Production, Structural Engineering, Civil Engineering, HVAC, Specifications, and Quantity Surveying departments. However, the demand for professional management and supervision of large scale projects led to the creation of the Project Management and Construction Management departments to effectively monitor and control all contractors and subcontractors' work on any construction project. In 1991, the organization launched its Information Technology division to provide clients with software and hardware. The division handled the software integration of Maintenance Management Systems (MMS), Geographical Information Systems (GIS), and Facilities Management Systems (FMS) into a single Graphical User Interface (GUI). In the same year, the Engineering Information Systems division was formed and is responsible for on-site implementation and provision of GIS, MMS, and FMS based on the clients' needs and requirements. ZFP partnered with Avaya in May 2011 to create a virtual computing environment (VCE). The purpose is to enable the organization to provide virtual services in a cloud-based environment that would serve 3000 users in 5 branches and 20 remote sites and maximize the efficiency of its existing IT resources. In July 2012, SNC-Lavalin acquired ZFP's industrial division in Khobar to form SNC- Lavalin Fayez Engineering, a joint-venture with ZFP, in response to Saudi Aramco's General Engineering Services Plus (GES+) initiative. In 2014, Zuhair Fayez Partnership was assigned to build a new campus for the American International School of Jeddah to accommodate 1,700 students. The announcement was made at ZFP's main headquarters during the groundbreaking ceremony.

He is an advocate for gender equality and transgender rights in Muslim communities. Early life Tynan Power was born in 1970 in Washington, D.C. to Carol Cargill and James Power. His mother was an applied linguistics professor and his father was a federal mediator and, previously, a Catholic priest. The couple divorced when Power was a baby. Power spent most of his life in Tampa, Florida before moving to Massachusetts in 1999, where he remains today. He was raised Catholic, but converted to Islam in 1985 at age fourteen. Although he was designated female at birth, he recognized that he identified as male at an early age and transitioned from female to male as an adult. =Education= Power attended the University of South Florida in Tampa briefly in 1987, but moved to Morocco partway through his undergraduate education. After moving back to the United States, he returned to the University of South Florida and received his Bachelor of Arts in English in 1995. In 2000, at the University of South Florida in St. Petersburg, he received his Master of Arts in Mass Communication-Journalism. Work and activism Power was a co-coordinator for the Muslim Alliance for Sexual and Gender Diversity (MASGD) from 2012 to 2014, and is still currently on the steering committee and head of the Communications Committee. The MASGD mission statement, which advocates for freedom from sexism and misogyny, was also developed by a team which Power was a part of. In addition, Power served as co-chair for the LGBT Muslim Retreat (a project by MASGD) for two years and served on the Retreat planning team for five. Before his work with MASGD, Power was an early member of Al-Fatiha Foundation, a similar organization that disbanded in 2005, and served on its Shura, or advisory council, along with being a moderator for the organization's email list. In 1999, at the Al Fatiha conference in New York City, Power served as a facilitator for a women's caucus and presented on a panel, \\"Transgender and Feminism.\\" In 2005, he also facilitated for the Al Fatiha conference, this time in Atlanta, Georgia, for a trans caucus about sexism. Also in 1999, Power started a grassroots networking group called Iman, specifically for lesbian and bisexual Muslim women and Muslim transgender people. The group addressed sexism in queer Muslim communities and addressed ways to build feminist empowerment. The group was ended in 2001. From 1999 to 2001, Power was the Muslim liaison for American Boyz, Inc., an organization that hosted the True Spirit Conference for female-to-male transgender people and their family and loved ones. Power also served on the board for the organization in 2000 and 2001. From 2012 to 2014, Power coordinated Muslim programming at the Philadelphia Trans Health Conference, where he led Muslim religious services In July 2015, Power was an invited speaker at the National Interfaith Service held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as part of the LGBT 50th celebration. He joined Bishop Gene Robinson, Rev. Jeffrey H. Jordan- Pickett, Rabbi Linda Holtzman, Rabbi Margot Stein, Rev. Timothy Safford, Rev. Susan Richardson and singer Jonathan Allen at the event. In 2010, he founded Pioneer Valley Progressive Muslims (PVPM), leading the organization in regular meetings for prayer, education, discussion and social networking. PVPM offers a space for people who might not traditionally be able to access religious leadership, such as women, gay men, transgender people, Muslim converts, and members of Muslim minority sects. He is currently the moderator for the TransMuslims email group, and is working with TransFaith to develop its Internet pages concerning transgender and Islam. =Awards= Power received the Queen Esther Human Rights Award of Beit Ahavah in 2012. Beit Ahavah is a reform synagogue in Northampton, Massachusetts. Occupation Currently, Power works for Smith College School for Social Work as a Communications Specialist. He also gives speeches about transgender and Islam, LGBT Muslims, and progressive Muslims. He has spoken at Northampton Transgender Day of Remembrance in 2010, Philadelphia Trans Health Conference in 2012, and in 2013 at CLPP conference and at Brown University. Feminist work Power is a strong advocate for female religious leadership and empowerment of women, transgender and gender non-conforming individuals in the Muslim community. Power is committed to elevating the profile of women whose faith leadership is often overlooked or under-valued, and has taken part in and led mixed-gender prayer. In 2010, he served as muezzin, or someone who makes the call to prayer, at a controversial public Muslim prayer meeting led by a female imam, Pamela Taylor. Personal life Power is married with two adult sons, Yahya and Justyn, and has two dogs and one cat. He is an avid runner, participating regularly in the Hot Chocolate Run for Safe Passage, an annual event which benefits a domestic violence service organization in Northampton, MA.

Badis ibn Habus, the third Berber king of the Taifa of Granada and the founder of the Alhambra palace, ruled between 1038 and 1073. A member of the Berber Zirid dynasty, Badis ibn Habus succeeded to the throne of the Taifa of Granada upon the death of his father, Habbus al- Muzaffar, in spite of a conspiracy on the part of the Granada court that supported his cousin Yaddair ben Hubasa as a successor to Habbus. The plot failed, however, thanks to Habbus's vizier, the Jew, Samuel ibn Naghrillah, who made certain that Badis succeeded Habbus, thus reinforcing his own position in the kingdom. In 1038, following a confrontation with Zuhayr, the king of the Taifa of Almer√≠a, Badis ibn Habus took control of the territory of the Taifa of Almeria and the following year managed to curb the expansionist ambitions of the king of the Taifa of Seville, Abu al-Qasim, whom he defeated in battle at √âcija, in alliance with the Taifa of M√°laga and the Badajoz. In 1057, Badis ibn Habus won the Taifa of M√°laga, annexing that kingdom and installing his firstborn son, Buluggin ibn Badis, as its governor. Nevertheless, Buluggin ibn Badis would not succeed his father as head of the Taifa of Granada, since he died in 1064 as a result of poisoning. The death of the firstborn placed Badis ibn Habus's second child, Maksan ibn Badis, as heir to the throne. After the death of the vizier Joseph ibn Nagrela, the position of vizier to the king was occupied by the Arab Al-Naya. After Al-Naya's assassination by Abu-l-Rabbi, a Moz√°rab, Abu-l-Rabbi successfully maneuvered Badis ibn Habus to appoint his grandson Abdallah ibn Buluggin as his successor, rather than his son Maksan, who had lost Ja√©n at the hands of the Taifa of Seville, and was a refugee in the Taifa of Toledo. Abdallah ibn Buluggin finally succeeded Badis when he died in 1073.

The period is named after the capital city established by Akhenaten, son of Amenhotep III. Akhenaten started his reign as Amenhotep IV, but changed his name when he discarded all other religions and declared the Aten or sun disc as the only god. He closed all the temples of the other Gods and removed their names from the monuments. Smenkhkare, then Tutankhamun, succeeded Akhenaten. Discarding Akhentenn's religion believes, Tutankhamun returned to the traditional gods. He died young and was succeeded by Ay. Many kings did their best to remove all traces of the period from the records. The Amarna art is very distinctive: the royal family was portrayed with extended heads, long necks and narrow chests. They had skinny limbs, but heavy hips and thighs, with a marked stomach.  Kings in the Amarna period  = Akhenaten = Akhenaten started his reign as the king of Egypt around 1353 BC. The reign of his father, Amenhotep III, had been long and wealthy with international diplomacy largely replacing the persistent military campaigning of the kings before him. The reign ended in a series of wonderful anniversary pageants celebrated in Thebes, the capital of Egypt at the time and home to the official god Amun-Re. The new king was named as Amenhotep IV (meaning 'Amun is content') and temple construction began immediately in the name of the new king. Akhenaten's 'great king's wife' was Nefertiti and they had six daughters. There were also other wives, including the enigmatic Kiya who may have been the mother of Tutankhamun. = Smenkhkare = Smenkhkare was a king (reigned 1335‚Äì32 bce) in the 18th Dynasty of ancient Egypt. Smenkhkare's beginning and identity from the vague issues of the Amarna period. The short- lived Smenkhkare appears only at the end of Ahkenaton's reign in a few monuments at Amarna. He shares the same coronation name, Ankhkheperure, with another royal individual called Neferneferuaton. Since coronation names are generally exceptional to one individual, it has been suggested that Smenkhkare is Nefertiti herself, raised herself to kingly status to share the throne with her husband at the end of his life. In one tomb at Akhetaton, Smenkhkare is shown with the eldest daughter of Akhenaton, Meritaton, then elevated to the status of queen. The only dated document of Smenkhkare's reign is a graffito from a Theban tomb, which notes his third regnal year. = Tutankhamun = Tutankhamun was born during the Amarna period. The identity of his parents is doubtful but they were perhaps Akhenaten and his wife Kiya; he was a royal prince and began his reign at the age of about eight years. Tutankhamun married Ankhesenpaaten, daughter of Akhenaten and Nefertiti. Tutankhamun, the 11th king of the 18th dynasty of Ancient Egypt, is famous due to the discovery of tomb by the British archaeologist Howard Carter in 1922. The discovery of his mummy shown that he was about 17 when he died. He is thought to have been the son of Akhenaten. When Tutankhamun began hid region, his management restored the old religion and moved the capital from Akhetaten back to its traditional home at Memphis. He changed his name from Tutankhaten--'living image of Aten [the sun god]'--to Tutankhamun. His queen, Ankhesenpaaten, also changed the name on her throne to read Ankhesenamun. Although the reign of Tutankhamun is thought to have little historical importance, his monuments tell a different story. He built his tomb in the Valley of the Kings, and one colossal statue still survives of the mortuary temple he began to build at Medinet Habu. He also continued building at the temple of Karnak and finished the second of a pair of red granite lions at Soleb. Doubt still surrounds his death. He may have been killed, or died as the result of an injury happened while hunting.  Royal women in the Amarna period  = Nefertiti = Nefertiti, whose name means \\"the beautiful one has come,\\" was the queen of Egypt and wife of king Akhenaten. She and her husband established the religion of Aten, and promoted Egyptian art that was very different. Nefertiti was one of the most iconic symbols of Egypt. Little is known about the origins of Nefertiti, but her legacy of beauty and power continue to intrigue scholars today. Other theories have suggested that she was born in a foreign country. The exact date when Nefertiti married Amenhotep IV, is unknown. It is believed she was 15 which may have been before Akhenaten began his reign. They had six daughters, with rumor that they may have also had a son. Art from the day depicts the couple and their daughters in an unusually naturalistic style, more so than from earlier art. It has been stated that the couple may have had a genuine romantic connection. Nefertiti and the king took an active role in establishing the religion of the Aten as the most important god and only one worthy of worship in Egypt. Amenhotep IV changed his name to Akhenaten to honor the God. Nefertiti changed her name to Neferneferuaten-Nefertiti, meaning \\"beautiful are the beauties of Aten, a beautiful woman has come,\\" as a respect for the new religion. Nefertiti was perhaps one of the most powerful women that have ever ruled. Her husband has done a lot to show her as equal to him. In several reliefs she is shown wearing the crown of a king. She disappears after year 17 of her husband's reign. The reason for her disappearance is unknown.  Religion in the Amarna period  The Egyptians used to have a whole list of Gods who were worshipped during this period of time. These Gods were always represented in the form of humans or animals or as animal-headed humans. Some of these gods were specific to certain places or cities for example while others were more general and were worshipped on a larger scale. From early periods of the Egyptian kingdom solar gods such as Re had played a very important role in Egyptian state religion. This is mainly because the idea of the sun as a distant yet universal power was close enough to the prevailing ideas of the supreme power of the king both inside Egypt and beyond its borders. In the New Kingdom, the prominence and power of solar gods increased again. One of the most popular ones was the Aten, the visible sun- disk which can be seen traversing the sky each day. Akhenaten raised the Aten to the position of 'sole god', and it was represented as a disk with rays of light terminating in hands which reach out to the royal family, it was usually perceived as if it was offering the hieroglyphic sign for life. Akhenaten and his family are usually displayed while worshipping the Aten or even indulging in everyday activities beneath the disk that represents Aten. Art and test during this period always stressed on the idea of the tie between the king and the God. The king represents the link between the god and ordinary people. As a result, ordinary people had to focus on worshipping Akhenaten and the royal family instead of the Aten. And with worshipping the king they are getting closer to the god Aten. It is highly probable that Akhenaten's religion is not monotheistic. Even though the Aten is actually the only God worshipped and provided with temples during this period, other gods still existed and are sometimes mentioned in inscriptions. However, these solar gods are personifications of abstract concepts. This might be well understood as sometimes even the names of the Aten, which are written in cartouches like king's names, consist of a statement describing the Aten in terms of other gods. The idea of traditional gods was not highly tolerated by the majority of ordinary people however, teams of workmen were sent around the temples of Egypt where they called out the names and images of these gods wherever they occurred. A number of hymns to the Aten were composed during Akhenaten's reign in order to praise the Aten. These hymns provide an overview of what James Allen has described as the 'natural philosophy' of Akhenaten's religion. The wonders of the natural world are described to praise the universal power of the sun. All creatures celebrate when the sun rises and the nature becomes beautiful. While nasty things happen = at night when the sun is not present. Akhenaten decided that the worship of the Aten required a new location which is uncontaminated by the cults of traditional gods. That's why; he chose a site in Middle Egypt for a new capital city which he called Akhetaten, 'Horizon of the Aten'. It is a faraway site in the desert surrounded on three sides by cliffs and to the west by the Nile and is known today as el-Amarna. In the cliffs surrounding the city the king left a series of monumental inscriptions in which he explained his reasons for the move to this new site and his architectural intentions for the city in the form of lists of buildings that he either built or intended to build.  Art in the Amarna period  Early in his reign, Akhenaten used art in order to emphasize his intentions of doing things very differently unlike his precedents. Colossi and wall-reliefs from the Karnak Aten Temple are highly exaggerated and almost grotesque when compared to the Egyptian royal and elite art during the millennium preceding Akhenaten's birth. Art before Akhenaten was characterized by its formality and restraint. Since art during Akhenaten period such as Karnak Temple is strangely beautiful today, it is hard for us to understand the shocking effect that such representations must have had on the senses of people who were never exposed to any similar art before. It was quite striking for them to find such extravagant art after being used to the traditional formal Egyptian art. With the move to Amarna, art becomes less exaggerated, it is often described as 'naturalistic' however, it remains highly stylized in its portrayal of the human figure. The royal family members are usually shown with elongated skulls and pear-shaped bodies with skinny torsos and arms but fuller hips, stomachs and thighs. Although formal worshipping scenes of the king while worshipping the Gods remain important, there was an increase emphasis on ordinary, day-to-day activities. Some of the very interesting portrayals were those intimate portrayals of Akhenaten and Nefertiti while playing with their daughters under the rays of the Aten. Also, there were portrayals of animals and birds playing under the sun rays in the decoration of the royal tomb. While traditional Egyptian art tends to emphasize the idea of eternity, Amarna art focuses on the small details of life which only occur because of the light of the sun that gives the living power to all living beings. Not only Akhenaten is famous for the changes he made in the religious practices and art but he also was known for the changes in temple architecture and building methods. He shifted to smaller blocks of stone set in a strong mortar in order to create his stone structure. Even official inscriptions changed from the old-fashioned language used in traditional earlier periods to monumental texts to reflect the spoken language of the time.

After the German reunification, between November 1990 and December 1997, he was regional Minister of Food, Agriculture and Forestry in Brandenburg. His name hit the headlines in 1997 over the \\"Bake-oven affair\\" which ended his ministerial career and eventually, in 2004, left him with an eleven-month suspended sentence for \\"Subsidy Fraud\\" (\\"Subventionsbetrug\\"). Life =Early years= Edwin Zimmermann was born in the Sch√∂na district of Dahme, some 100 km (62 miles) south of Berlin in the Soviet occupation zone of what had been Germany, a region which was by now becoming the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). His parents were farmers. He attended the Polytechnic Secondary School in nearby Hohenbucko and then undertook an apprenticeship as a tractor and agricultural machinery mechanic at the Science and Technical Centre (WTZ) in Schlieben. He worked as a mechanic in 1967/68 before undertaking his military service in 1968/69. =Agriculture industry= Between 1969 and 1970 he worked as a lathe operator with the PGH Agricultural Machinery factory in Dahme and then in 1970 was briefly employed in an administrative function with the local police in Herzberg District. In 1970/71 Zimmermann worked as a mechanic with the Agricultural Production Cooperative (LPG) in Sch√∂na and then as a master craftsman for spinning technology in yarn machinery production between 1972 and 1975. He then returned to education, undertaking an engineering course in Berlin in 1974/75. From 1975 he attended the Engineering College in Friesack, emerging in 1978 with an Engineering Degree in Agricultural Technology. From 1976 till 1990 Edwin Zimmermann was in charge of transport and Materials Logistics at the Agro-technical Centre in Hohenseefeld. 1990 was the year in which everything changed for East Germany, and Zimmermann entered politics at this time. However, he retired from politics in 1998 and became an independent business consultant. From December 1999 till 2004 he served as President of the Regional Sports League in Brandenburg.Welt online vom 13. Dezember 2003: Ex-Agrarminister Edwin Zimmermann kandidiert nicht mehr als LSB-Pr√§sident =Politics= The succession of events leading to German reunification can be dated from November 1989 when the wall through Berlin was breached, and this was also the month in which Zimmermann participated in the refounding of the SPD (party) in Dahme and in the surrounding Luchau district. In April 1990 he became chairman of the party's regional board in Cottbus, and at the same time he was elected deputy SPD party chairman for Brandenburg. On 1 November 1990, after German reunification had become a reality, he was appointed Minister for Food, Agriculture and Forestry for Brandenburg, in the regional government headed up by Manfred Stolpe. He became a member of the Brandenburg Regional Assembly (Landtag) on 19 March 1992 when he took over the seat of Gustav Just following the latter's resignation. In 1994 and 1999 he was re-elected to the assembly, representing the \\"Dahme-Spreewald II\\" electoral district. In the assembly he was, following his ministerial resignation, a member of the Committee on Food, Agriculture and Forestry between 1997 and 1999. From 1999 till 2004 he was a member of the Committee for Education, Youth and Sport and also of the Committee for European Affairs and Development policy. =Bake-oven affair= Allegations of bad faith and cheating were made against Zimmermann in connection with the so-called \\"Bake-oven affair\\", over which he resigned his ministerial office on 14 November 1997. The controversy involved the allocation of European Union Support grants and contracts allocated during his time in office, of which approximately ‚Ç¨244,000 had gone to a Job creation project for a commercial \\"Show-bakery\\" and its new industrial-scale wood- fueled oven. However, the Show-bakery in question was the Zimmermann family bakery, run by Edwin Zimmermann's wife, brother and daughter. Early in 1998 the Brandenburg regional government demanded a partial repayment of the subsidy. At the end of 1998 the Potsdam district prosecutor launched proceedings against Zimmermann, alleging \\"Deception and Subsidy Fraud\\" (\\"Untreue und Subventionsbetrug\\"). The former minister's offices were searched, but he firmly rejected the charges. The trial was initially dropped, but proceedings were restarted in Summer 2000. On 22 February 2002 Edwin Zimmermann, together with two other defendants, was acquitted by the Potdam District Court. The Prosecutor appealed the verdict, however, and at a further hearing that ended in April 2003 the acquittal was revoked. In February 2004, after a further trial lasting fifteen days, the Potsdam District Court gave Zimmermann an eleven-month suspended sentence and ordered him to pay ‚Ç¨5,000 to a charitable organisation. On 16 June 2005 the Federal Court upheld the conviction and rejected Zimmermann's appeal.

It is located to the south-east of Lagos city. Lekki is a naturally formed peninsula, adjoining to its west Victoria Island and Ikoyi districts of Lagos, with the Atlantic Ocean to its south, Lagos Lagoon to the north, and Lekki Lagoon to its east; however, the city's southeast which ends around the western edge of Refuge Island, adjoins the eastern part of Ibeju-Lekki LGA. The city is still largely under construction; As of 2015, only phase 1 of the project has been completed, with phase 2 nearing completion. The peninsula is approximately 70 to 80 km long, with an average width of 10 km. Lekki currently houses several Estates, gated residential developments, agricultural farmlands, areas allocated for a Free Trade Zone, with an airport, and a sea port under construction. The proposed land-use master plan for the Lekki envisages the Peninsula as a \\"Blue-Green Environment City\\", expected to accommodate well over 3.4 million residential population and an additional non-residential population of at least 1.9 million. Part of the Lekki peninsula was formerly known as Maroko, a slum, before it was destroyed by the Raji Rasaki led Lagos State military Government. One of its suburbs Lekki phase 1 has got a reputation as an area with some of the most expensive real estate in Lagos State. History Overview left In 2006, the Master Plan of Lekki Free Trade Zone, covering a total area of 155 square kilometres at the easternmost end of the peninsula, was initiated and prepared by the State Government of Lagos. The Plan defined the free zone as a special multi-functional economic zone and a new modern city with several south-west and north‚Äìsouth traffic corridors. Later in July 2008, the blueprint of developing the entire Lekki Peninsula into a 'Blue- Green Environment City' was proposed by the state Government, which covers an additional area of 600 square kilometres. The Lekki City plan was prepared by Messrs Dar al Handersah, Shair and Partners, for Lagos State Ministry of Urban Planning and Physical Development. Based on the proposed land-use plan, Lekki city, excluding the Lekki Free Zone, will be divided into 4 linear development zones; the North Urban Zone which will be largely residential, the Natural Park Zone which will consist environmental and nature conservation park, the South Urban Zone which will include the existing and new residential developments along with commercial and mixed uses, as well as light industry, and the Atlantic Coastal Zone which will mainly be developed for tourism and recreational activities. The land-use master plan will stipulate a total built-up area of about 100 square kilometres, which can accommodate a residential population of about 3.4 million and non-residential population (touristic, hotels, commercial, offices, medical and industrial) of about 1.9 million. Several institutions, estates and new investments are springing up along the Lekki axis that has been described as \\"the fastest growing corridor in west African sub-region\\". =Lekki Free Trade Zone= Detailed plan for the Lekki Free Trade Zone Lekki Free Trade Zone (Lekki FTZ) is a free zone situated at the eastern part of Lekki, which covers a total area of about 155 square kilometres. The first phase of the zone has an area of 30 square kilometres, with about 27 square kilometres for urban construction purposes, which would accommodate a total resident population of 120,000. According to the Master Plan, the free zone will be developed into a new modern city within a city with integration of industries, commerce and business, real estate development, warehousing and logistics, tourism, and entertainment. Lekki FTZ is divided into three functional districts; the residential district in the north, industrial district in the middle and commercial trading/warehousing & logistics district in the southeast. The \\"sub-centre\\" located in the south of the Zone is to be developed first. The region is close to the customs supervisory area, and it is mainly for commercial trading, logistics and warehousing operations. The second phase is located in the north of the Zone adjacent to E9 Road (Highway) which will serve as central business district of the free zone. The area along E2 Road will be developed for financial and commercial businesses, estate properties & supporting facilities, high-end production service industries and so on, which will link it to the sub-centre the Zone. The area along E4 Road will be utilized mainly for the development of logistics and industrial manufacturing/processing. A number of connection axes are also planned in-between the principal axis and the sub-axis, with multi-functional service nodes to serve the whole of Lekki FTZ. Dangote Refinery is currently being built in the Lekki Free Zone. In the start-up area of the Lekki Free Trade Zone, there will be a Commercial & Logistics Park which will cover a total area of 1.5 square kilometres.

Cultural =Lekki Conservation Centre= Lekki Conservation Centre (LCC) is one of the major Nigerian Conservation Foundation (NCF) conservation sites. It covers a land area of 78 hectares in Lekki. The Conservation Centre was established in the 1990, before the development of Lekki, for the conservation of wildlife found in southwest coastal environment of Nigeria, in the face of sprawling urban development. The project has promoted environmental protection and worked against poaching by surrounding communities as well as serve as a tourist centre for local and international visitors. Over two million tourists of more than 100 nationals have visited Lekki Conservation Centre since its establishment. Most of NCF's School Conservation Clubs were established following the impact of individual visit to the centre. LCC land area is divided into two sections: LCC Complex and the nature reserve. The LCC Complex comprises multi-purpose Rotunda surrounded by four office blocks, containing project staff offices, gift shop, canteen and the drivers‚Äô office. The nature reserve consists of a mosaic of vegetation types, which includes: secondary forest, swamp forest and Savanna grassland.

Semantic queries enable the retrieval of both explicitly and implicitly derived information based on syntactic, semantic and structural information contained in data. They are designed to deliver precise results (possibly the distinctive selection of one single piece of information) or to answer more fuzzy and wide open questions through pattern matching and digital reasoning. Semantic queries work on named graphs, linked data or triples. This enables the query to process the actual relationships between information and infer the answers from the network of data. This is in contrast to semantic search, which uses semantics (the science of meaning) in unstructured text to produce a better search result. (See natural language processing.) From a technical point of view, semantic queries are precise relational-type operations much like a database query. They work on structured data and therefore have the possibility to utilize comprehensive features like operators (e.g. >, < and =), namespaces, pattern matching, subclassing, transitive relations, semantic rules and contextual full text search. The semantic web technology stack of the W3C is offering SPARQL to formulate semantic queries in a syntax similar to SQL. Semantic queries are used in triplestores, graph databases, semantic wikis, natural language and artificial intelligence systems.  Background  Relational databases represent all relationships between data in an implicit manner only. For example, the relationships between customers and products (stored in two content-tables and connected with an additional link-table) only come into existence in a query statement (SQL in the case of relational databases) written by a developer. Writing the query demands exact knowledge of the database schema. Linked-Data represent all relationships between data in an explicit manner. In the above example, no query code needs to be written. The correct product for each customer can be fetched automatically. Whereas this simple example is trivial, the real power of linked-data comes into play when a network of information is created (customers with their geo-spatial information like city, state and country; products with their categories within sub- and super-categories). Now the system can automatically answer more complex queries and analytics that look for the connection of a particular location with a product category. The development effort for this query is omitted. Executing a semantic query is conducted by walking the network of information and finding matches (also called Data Graph Traversal). Another important aspect of semantic queries is that the type of the relationship can be used to incorporate intelligence into the system. The relationship between a customer and a product has a fundamentally different nature than the relationship between a neighbourhood and its city. The latter enables the semantic query engine to infer that a customer living in Manhattan is also living in New York City whereas other relationships might have more complicated patterns and \\"contextual analytics\\". This process is called inference or reasoning and is the ability of the software to derive new information based on given facts.

The Alderman Newtons Girls School was set up at the \\"Wyggestone School\\" building in another part of Leicester. The boys school continued at the Greyfriars premises until 1999. Alderman Newton's Boys School was a school in Leicester, England. It was a grammar school then it became a secondary school. The original school was opened in 1784, thanks to money bequeathed by a former Mayor of Leicester, Gabriel Newton. Land at Greyfriars acquired by the school in 1863 later proved to be the site of the Greyfriars friary church which contained the site of the grave of King Richard III. The school building has been converted to house the King Richard III Visitor Centre Its pupils were known as Newtonians. They wore a uniform of green coats, which later became a Green Blazer with red piping around the cuffs and coat tails. The lower school, on the opposite side to the Cathedral and Greyfriars was where the 1st and 2nd year juniors were located. In the post war years well into the 1970s the lower school boys had to wear short grey trousers, the green school blazer and the green cap with red cords. All lower school boys had to wear the cap for fear of detention whilst walking between the lower and main school or the dinner block opposite the lower school. They also had to \\"Doff\\" their caps at any \\"Masters\\" who they met along the street. The teachers (called \\"Masters\\") mostly wore the black graduate gowns. On special occasions, such as the annual prize-giving which was held at the Cathedral, the Masters would also wear their University stoles or colours which denoted their university of graduation. Some of these entailed quite elaborate faux fur collars. The school was closed in 1999 when it was merged by the local authority with two other local schools to form a single school.

Aside from being six inches tall, they just about invert the Victorian concept of mystical and refined fairies, and hark back to the fairies of folklore, who were generally seen as occasionally helpful thieves and pests. The Nac Mac Feegles' skin appears blue because it is heavily tattooed and covered with woad, and all have red hair. The tattoos identify a Feegle's clan. Wings or similar features of any kind are out of the question. Their speech can only be described as some sort of variation on the Scots language, usually Glaswegian in the clans encountered so far, although William the Gonnagle (from a different clan) has a softer, Highland accent. They are notably strong and resilient, which comes in handy given that (almost all) male Feegles tend to be notoriously rowdy as a lifestyle. The Feegles spend their time drinking, fighting and stealing, alone or in various combinations. The immense strength and rowdiness of these pictsies means that they will fight anything, and they have a particular fondness for headbutting creatures far larger than themselves. In a good fight, a Feegle will take on all comers, including his fellow Feegles (or, in their absence, themselves), with such enthusiasm that makes missing someone hazardous (\\"Crivens! I kicked meself in ma ain heid!\\"). Some clans have an apparently superstitious fear of their names being written lest they appear on unwelcome legal documents. Some of the upland clans have mastered the concept of law as a weapon however, and note that it is a good idea \\"neever tae sign a feegle contract; six inch high people write verra small print\\". Beware the cry, \\"We've got a cheap lawyer an' we're not afraid to use him!\\" The Feegles' swords glow blue in the presence of lawyers. History In The Art of Discworld, Pratchett identifies The Little Grey Men and Down the Bright Stream, both by \\"BB\\", the nom-de-plume of Denys Watkins- Pitchford, as possible inspiration, featuring fairies that could talk to animals, but \\"there was nothing tinkly about them; they lived in a world of dangers\\". The Guardian notes that \\"The Nac Mac Feegle embody the stereotypical Scotsman to great comic effect\\". The Nac Mac Feegle are often confused with pixies, because they refer to themselves as Pictsies. According to their own history, the Nac Mac Feegle rebelled against the wicked rule of the (or possibly \\"a\\") Queen of the Fairies, and were therefore exiled from Fairyland. According to everyone else (including the Nac Mac Feegle themselves if they forget this story), they were kicked out for causing fights and being drunk at two in the afternoon. The Nac Mac Feegle have an innate ability to cross dimensions, which they call \\"the crawstep\\". There appears to be no limit on what worlds they can cross into like this, including worlds that exist only in a person's imagination (although they cannot use it to travel within a world‚Äîfor this, we are assured, they have \\"feets\\"). Though they do not exclusively dwell on the Discworld plane, this is where they are most commonly spotted. Or, to be more accurate, where the highest concentration of their victims exist. As the Big Man of the Chalk Hill Gang, Rob Anybody, proudly states: \\"We've been robbin' an' runnin' aroound on all kinds o' worrlds for a lang time.\\" The Nac Mac Feegle take pride in being able to get into, or out of, anywhere (although getting out of pubs presents something of a difficulty). In A Hat Full of Sky, they claim \\"the crawstep\\" is \\"all in the ankle, ye ken\\". Those who have actually witnessed \\"the crawstep\\" report that the Mac Feegles simply stick one leg straight out in front of them, wiggle their foot, and are suddenly gone. The Ramtops have many legends about the Nac Mac Feegle. One, similar to the legend of Wayland's Smithy, says that if you leave sixpence and an unshod horse at a certain Feegle cairn overnight, then in the morning the coin will be gone, and you will never see your horse again either. Another says that if you leave a saucer of milk out for the pictsies, they will break into your house and take everything in the drinks cabinet. Despite their usual policy of non-contact with bigjobs (humans), Feegles have been known to hire out their services. One of the buzzards, Morag, owned by Officer Buggy Swires of the Ankh Morpork City Watch was trained by the Feegles, for the price of several crates of strong liquor. Among very few other things, they have the rare ability to scare Nanny Ogg's cat Greebo. Social structure Nac Mac Feegles possess a eusocial culture similar to bees, termites and other social insects. The clan is made up of hundreds of brothers, and one mother, called a kelda. When a Clan's kelda dies, another is imported from a different clan. The new kelda chooses her husband, known as the Big Man, from among her adopted Clan when she arrives, and soon begins the lifelong task of begetting the next generation, often up to one hundred tiny baby Feegles at a time. Depending on how long the kelda has been kelda, the majority of the tribe will either be her brothers-in-law (i.e., the sons of the previous kelda) or her sons. Daughters are very rare and, on coming of age, leave to become kelda of another tribe, taking some brothers, probably including a gonnagle (see below) with her. Young keldas are slim, but older keldas are virtually spherical. They also enjoy the odd nip of Special Sheep Liniment (which on no account should ever be given to sheep). Essentially, the role of the kelda is to do the thinking. The Big Man is responsible for commanding his fellow Feegles and trying to maintain some semblance of order, but in truth the kelda decides what will be done and the Big Man works out the fine (for a Feegle's plans) details‚Äîalthough no Big Man shown so far would go on a serious expedition and not bring along the clan gonnagle, (who tend to be much brighter than the other male Feegles and have a fund of lore, stories, and ideas they can draw upon.) Male Feegles are in dread of losing their kelda because there will be no one 'tae take care o' us'. To help her with this, she is given, before leaving her birth clan, a bottle of water from her mother's leather cauldron‚Äîwhich, of course, contains some of the water from her mother's cauldron, and so on. Theoretically, (and on the Discworld theories of this nature tend to work, even if they are not actually right, owing to narrative causality), the bottle contains water from the cauldrons of Nac Mac Feegle keldas since before history. By mixing a little of the water into her own cauldron, and drinking the result, the kelda can connect with the memories of those who have gone before her‚Äîand, more mysteriously, with those who are yet to come. (Compare with Reverend Mothers from Dune universe.) The males of the clan do not question this, accepting that keldaring is full of secrets (hiddlins) they are not expected to understand. They are warriors, hunters and foragers; Nac Mac Feegle foraging consists of taking anything that is not nailed down (if it is nailed down, they will prise it loose and take the nails as well), up to and including quite large cows if enough foragers can be gathered to do the lifting. If one were to see a sheep rise off the ground six inches and move backward rapidly, four Feegles are sure to be responsible. As Nanny Ogg testifies: \\"Four; one under each hoof, I seen em do it. You see a cow standin' in a field, mindin' its own business, next minute the grass is rustlin'. Some little bugger shouts \\"Hup, hup, hup!\\" and the poor beast goes by, voom!, without its legs movin'; backwards, sometimes. They're stronger than cockroaches. You step on a pictsie, you best be wearin' thick soles.\\" Fighting is likewise a group effort of the clan. When encountering a foe much larger than themselves, (which is most anything the Nac Mac Feegle pick a fight with,) the clan will stack themselves up like a pyramid, until the top one is high enough to punch the enemy or, preferably, head-butt them. Once an enemy is brought to the ground, the entire clan will spring into action, attacking the foe as a single, united force. As stated in The Folklore of Discworld, \\"once they go down, it's all over bar the kicking.\\" =The Clan Gonnagle= Among the warriors of each clan is a gonnagle; a bard or war-poet, whose job is to create terrible poetry that is recited during battles to demoralise the enemy, (see William McGonagall.) A well-trained gonnagle can even make the enemy's ears explode and is equipped with \\"mousepipes\\" (bagpipes made from mouseskin, often with the ears still attached.) In A Hat Full of Sky, the gonnagle, Awf'lly Wee Billy Bigchin, can play the mousepipes so sadly that it will start to rain outside. A gonnagle tends to be somewhat more intelligent and level-headed than most other male Feegles, and often acts as an advisor to the Big Man. Some of them travel from clan to clan, making sure the old songs and stories are still remembered and sharing the new ones. Culture and beliefs Despite their criminal tendencies, the Nac Mac Feegle do possess a sense of honour. They see no sport in fighting the weak. They may take one cow from a man with a herd of fifty; however, they will not steal an old woman's only pig, or an old man's only pair of false teeth. They claim it was a difference of opinion over when to stop stealing that led to their exile by the Queen of the Fairies. As a rule, the Nac Mac Feegle will never steal from the truly poor. The Nac Mac Feegle clans that have appeared in the books are the Long Lake Clan, who settled in Lancre in Carpe Jugulum (but were not named until A Hat Full of Sky) and the Chalk Hill Clan who feature in the Tiffany Aching books. The Chalk Hill Clan had, until the arrival of their new kelda Jeannie from Long Lake, a superstition that anything written down could be used against you in a court of law, and each of them carried swords that glowed blue in the presence of lawyers. The Long Lake Clan have similar superstitions about writing and lawyers, but believe it's possible to beat them at their own game and are famed for their \\"verra com-plic-at-ed documents\\". Nac Mac Feegle clans tend to occupy ancient burial mounds. They avoid humans if at all possible, as they are worried this might lead to folklorists and archaeologists invading their privacy and writing things down. Since they can move approximately ten times faster than a human, they find it easy to go unseen when they wish to do so. The Nac Mac Feegle males treat witches with a nervous mix of fear and respect. All witches, regardless of age, are called \\"hags\\". A very important witch, such as Granny Weatherwax, is acknowledged as the \\"hag o' hags\\". Feegles seem to know enough about witches to spot and respect a good one, and just as they accept that their keldas know things they do not, they are willing to believe that \\"the haggin'\\" has its own secrets. They comically fear witches who know about them, with large amounts of dread being reserved for \\"the Foldin' o' the Arms\\", \\"the Pursin' o' the Lips\\", and the \\"Tappin' o' the Feets\\", followed by \\"the Explainin\\". One witch nearly panics them when she harangues them in their own dialect, which they called \\"the knowin' o' the speakin\\". The fearlessness of Nac Mac Feegle warriors in combat is derived from their religious belief that they cannot be killed, because they are already dead; they believe that they are in the afterlife, and that any Feegle who is killed has simply been reincarnated into the world where they have already lived before. They reason that Discworld, with the sunshine, flowers, birds, trees, things to steal and people to fight, must be some sort of heaven, because \\"a world that good couldn't be open to just anybody\\". They consider it a kind of Valhalla, where brave warriors go when they are dead. So, they reason, they have already been alive somewhere else, and then died and were allowed to come to the Discworld because they have been so good. Thus, they do not mourn the loss of Mac Feegles who have died in battle on the Discworld, according to The Wee Free Men: \\"Oh, they've gone back to the land o' the livin'. It's nae as good as this one, but they'll bide fine and come back before too long. No sense in grievin'.\\" Indeed, any grieving a Feegle might do over fallen family members is never about their actual death, but rather over the fact that he did not get to spend more time with them before they rejoined the land of the living. Despite carrying swords that are nearly as large as they themselves (which is not outlandish, given the already-documented history of Mac Feegle feats of strength), their preferred weapons are the boot and the head; this results in most Feegles' noses being broken. =Language= The Nac Mac Feegle language is a mix of Morporkian (English), the Glaswegian dialect (\\"Crivens! Whut aboot us, ye daftie\\") and elements of Irish and Scottish Gaelic, for example Tir-far-th√≥inn and geas. The kelda in Wee Free Men states that \\"in our tongue you'd be Tir- far-th√≥inn\\" (an alternative name for T√≠r na n√ìg),MacLeod, Rev. Malcolm T√¨r nan √íg in The Active Gael, being Papers read before the Gaelic Society of Glasgow (1934) suggesting that in private their speech may be closer to Irish or Scottish Gaelic. This is also hinted at in Wintersmith, where Nanny Ogg's Place is given as Tir Nani Ogg, exhibiting Goidelic-type head-initial compounding. They also use the Yan Tan Tethera in counting occasionally. In Carpe Jugulum, their speech is almost undecipherable and has to be translated by Nanny Ogg; however, by the time they meet Tiffany Aching, they are somewhat more understandable to \\"bigjobs\\". In reality, since the books featuring the Nac Mac Feegle are targeted at young adults, \\"the simpler language of a children's book accounts for the readability of the Nac Mac Feegle's speech in the Tiffany Aching books\\". Nac Mac Feegle tend to have human names, usually abbreviated and with some sort of modifier (Rob Anybody, Daft Wullie, Big Aggie, Wee Jock), though their respect for inheriting and repeating famous names limits them a bit (No'-as-big-as-Medium-Sized-Jock-but-bigger-than-Wee- Jock Jock).

Once attacked Death by headbutting him, to Death's annoyance (Death picked Rob out of his hood and asked Tiffany ?). *Jeannie: The current kelda of the Chalk clan, originally from the Long Lake clan. Married to Rob Anybody. Mixed feelings about Tiffany Aching. *Fion: Ill- tempered only female of the Chalk clan. Now a kelda of another clan. *Daft Wullie: Not too bright, but a good feegle and champion stealer nonetheless. Only ever said the Right Thing once in his lifetime, before having said just the wrong thing on many occasions. Has an affectionate relationship with Horace the Cheese, adopting him as a kind of pet. *Big Yan: Mighty warrior of the Chalk clan who, at a height of 7 inches, is notably taller than most of the other Feegles. Less trusting than the rest, too. Suspicious of everybody. Name possibly a reference to Billy Connolly. In The Art of Discworld, cover artist Paul Kidby acknowledged Connolly as the inspiration for Yan's look. *Awfully Wee Billy Bigchin: He came with Jeannie from the Long Lake clan and is the new gonnagle for Chalk clan. He is notably smaller than many of the other Feegles, partly because he's just young and partly because he's just short. When Miss Level remarks how short he is in A Hat Full of Sky, he replies, \\"Only fra my height, Mistress.\\" *Hamish: a Feegle that flies on the back of a buzzard named Morag with a pair of Tiffany Aching's underwear as a parachute. *William the Gonnagle: Gonnagle in Wee Free Men before his retirement. *No'-As-Big-As-Medium-Sized-Jock-But-Bigger-than-Wee-Jock Jock: Gonnagle-in-training of the Chalk clan for a time, before following Fion to her new clan. *Wee Dangerous Spike: A young and inexperienced Feegle who goes to the Underworld for the first time in Wintersmith. *Wee Mad Arthur: First seen in Feet of Clay, where he becomes a watchman, and originally described as a gnome, however, it was revealed in I Shall Wear Midnight that he is a Feegle, that was raised by gnomes who found him after he'd been snatched by sparrowhawk and were very happy to let him stay \\"What with being able to bite foxes to death and everything\\". *Horace the Cheese: A large, ambulatory Lancre Blue cheese, made by Tiffany. An accomplished thief and troublemaker in his own right, Horace was made a member of the Chalk Clan in Wintersmith and now sports their tartan. At one point, he attempts to sing Row, Row, Row Your Boat along with the Feegles, but, being a cheese, all he can manage to sing is, \\"Mnamnamnam\\". *The Toad: A talking, intelligent toad, onetime witch's familiar and former lawyer (he achieved his present state after taking a case against a particularly unforgiving fairy godmother), who has taken up residence in the Clan's barrow and gives advice on legal and other civilised matters in exchange for shelter, flies and beetles. Gnomes Besides the Nac Mac Feegle, the Disc is home to a range of small creatures called gnomes. Ranging in size from six inches to two feet, they are, Pratchett says, more or less interchangeable with the Feegles. A gnome is a pictsie living underground, while a pictsie is a gnome fighting. Despite this, there remains some ambiguity as to whether the more general gnomes, such as Buggy Swires, should be considered of the same race. Gnomes and the Nac Mac Feegle share a lot of the same characteristics, such as immense strength, bellicose personality and the use of tamed birds as lookouts. However, they are also described by Wee Mad Arthur as \\"making and repairing shoes for hundreds of years\\" similar to several children's stories. In the Discworld Companion, Pratchett describes Wee Mad Arthur, an Ankh Morpork gnome, as an urbanised Nac Mac Feegle, (however, he is later revealed to be a Feegle (see above)) and Paul Kidby's illustration of Buggy Swires in The Art of Discworld is indistinguishable from the pictsies on the cover of The Wee Free Men. However, as yet no gnome has shown evidence of the Nac Mac Feegle's fairy abilities like the crawstep (the ability to cross into dreams and parallel dimensions), or of their bee-like social structure. Rincewind and Twoflower meet a gnome in The Light Fantastic. Twoflower is disappointed, believing he should be dressed in brightly coloured clothes and \\"more sort of... jolly\\". Rincewind explains: \\"He's six inches high and lives in a mushroom, of course he's a bloody gnome.\\" Gnomes are able to make a good living as rat-catchers, because as well as being able to chase the rats into spaces where humans cannot, they can make several good meals, and indeed warm clothes, from a rat. Gnomes also tend to be surprisingly strong for their height, described as \\"the strength of a man compressed into a body six inches tall\\". Gnomes are also featured in the short story Theatre of Cruelty, in which a children's entertainer forces them to perform as a Punch and Judy show. This story also reveals the existence of gnomes dogs and alligators. Response The Nac Mac Feegle have inspired a number of critical observations. Eileen Donaldson, writing in The Gothic Fairy Tale in Young Adult Literature: Essays on Stories from Grimm to Gaiman, notes that Pratchett \\"satirizes our expectation of fairy-folk (wings, flowers, and \\"tinklyness\\") through the Feegles who curse, drink, fight, steal, cause chaos and are feared by everyone\\". Lawrence Watt-Evans notes that one's \\"first impression is that they're a cross between Smurfs and soccer hooligans\\". Stephen Briggs' audiobook rendering of the Nac Mac Feegle has been cited as a strong point of his work.

It belongs to the deanery of Wallasey, the archdeaconry of Chester and the diocese of Chester. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History Until the 19th century Seacombe was an agricultural community, and in the 1840s wealthy businessmen from Liverpool began to build large houses in the area. St Paul's was built at an early stage in this development, and was intended to serve both communities. The church occupies a prominent site in the area, and is raised on a plateau overlooking the ferry terminal. It was built in 1846‚Äì47 and was designed by John Hay, a Liverpool architect. The church was consecrated on 12 October 1847, and the spire was completed in 1849. The south aisle was added in 1859, and in 1891 the north aisle, Lady Chapel, and west gallery were built. During the Second World War the east end of the church was damaged by bombs and had to be rebuilt. Also, in the middle of the 20th century, the fabric of the spire had become unsafe. The top of the spire were removed, and were replaced by a crown of thorns made by Cammell Laird of Birkenhead. In 2013‚Äì14 the spire was dismantled, a stainless steel frame was built, and the spire was reconstructed, re-using the stone up to the former level, and adding new material to the top of the spire to restore it to its original height. Architecture =Exterior= St Paul's is built in sandstone with Welsh slate roofs. Its architectural style is that of 1300. The plan consists of a seven-bay nave, a south aisle, also of seven bays, a south porch, a north aisle of six bays, a north transept containing a Lady Chapel, a two-bay chancel, a north vestry, and a steeple at the northwest corner. Around the church are buttresses and between them, along the sides of the church, are tall pointed windows containing geometrical and curvilinear tracery. The east window has three lights, and the west window has four lights with a trefoil window above. Along the roof of the south aisle are gabled dormers with trefoil windows. The south porch is gabled, and contains stone benches and narrow windows. At the west end is a hexagonal stair turret leading to the west gallery. The steeple consists of a three-stage tower and a spire. The tower contains a west door, and at its top are pinnacles and small gables. The top of the spire consists of the new material added during its reconstruction. =Interior= The interior of the church is plastered. Between the nave and the aisles are five-bay arcades with clustered piers and carved capitals. The roof of the nave has scissor-braced trusses with pendants, and is supported by corbels carved as angels. The chancel arch is moulded, the chancel ceiling is panelled and painted, and around the chancel is a painted dado. The stone pulpit is to the left of the chancel arch, it incorporates marble shafts, and is inscribed with Alpha and Omega symbols and the IHS Christogram. The sandstone font dates from the early 20th century. The organ was made by Henry Willis & Sons. Appraisal The church was designated as a Grade II listed building on 12 March 2009.

The studies last at least seven years after the baccalaur√©at and end with an exertion thesis giving the right to the state diploma of veterinary physician. The course starts with two years of scientific studies at the end of which students spend a national contest to enter into a veterinary school, where studies will then continue over five years. France was the first country where the teaching of veterinary medicine has become institutionalized, through the establishment of the first veterinary schools in the eighteenth century. Claude Bourgelat, pioneer of veterinary education  Veterinary Doctorate State Diploma (Dipl√¥me d'Etat de docteur v√©t√©rinaire (DEV)) education  = Preliminary studies and preparation = The entry into a veterinary school is possible via a nationwide contest accessible after two years of preliminary undergraduate scientific studies, which number of places is about 550 per year (the exact number is set each year by the French ministry of Agriculture). The contest is organized by the department of agronomic and veterinary contests. The number of attempts to the contest is limited to two per person, across all entryways. There are five possible contests after which admitted students formulate their integration vows in the four schools by order of preference, places are then filled by order of merit.  Preparatory class BCPST  This classe pr√©paratoire aux grands √©coles, BCPST pathway (standing for biology, chemistry, physics and earth science), is open to students with a scientific baccalaur√©at, and allows to attempt the A BCPST contest. This preparation is accessible after a selection based on application which take into account the school reports of the two last years of high school. These two years of preparatory class are not specific to the education of veterinarians, indeed they also allows to attempt other contests to enter into agri-food, horticulture, geology, chemistry, and physics engineering schools, as well as into the √©coles normales sup√©rieures (in biology and geology pathways). All students therefore receive extensive training in various fields, which may not be directly related to veterinary medicine, such as plant biology, physics, chemistry, geology, and mathematics.  DUT, BTS and BTSA   L2 Bachelor of Life Science   Preparatory class TB   Reorientation  = Studies in the veterinary schools = In France, there are four veterinary schools: * Oniris Nantes * The National Veterinary School of Alfort * The National Veterinary School of Toulouse * VetAgro Sup Lyon All these are public institutions under supervision of the ministry of Agriculture. The only existing classification of these schools is given indirectly by the rank of the last called at the end of the entrance examination. This ranking reflects only the popularity of schools among students passing the examination, it may be consistent with reality or not. Schools of Lyon and Alfort are thus often the two schools that enjoy greater prestige among these students. This prestige can be explained by the age of these schools which were founded in the eighteenth century, as opposed to schools of Toulouse and Nantes, newer and therefore that have less impregnated collective imagination. The duration of studies in veterinary school is 5 years.  Core curriculum  Basic training lasts 4 years divided into 8 semesters. The first 3 years are rather theoretical, the fourth year is more clinical. This common core ends with the veterinary fundamental studies degree (DEFV), a diploma giving the master's degree. During the first 3 years, future veterinarians study numerous subjects. Among them there are disciplines describing the state and the normal functioning of the body, such as anatomy, histology, physiology and immunology; disciplines describing pathogens, such as bacteriology, virology, parasitology and mycology; disciplines dealing with pathological functioning of the body, such as pathology and pathophysiology; disciplines for understanding the mechanisms and characteristics of diseases, such as infectiology and pathology; practical disciplines, such as propaedeutic and surgery; disciplines focused on diagnostic support and treatment, such as medical imaging, clinical biology and pharmacology; as well as disciplines on particular apparatus such as ophthalmology, dermatology, rheumatology and theriogenology (gynecology and obstetrics). Secondary disciplines are also studied, but this can vary from one school to another. These disciplines include: food science, genetics, statistics, analytical chemistry (mass spectrometry, IR, NMR), health biotechnology, ethnology (domestication, breeds), scientific ecology, veterinary legislation, management, housing livestock, quality and safety of food, hog, poultry, fish and rabbit production, English, and sometimes other modern languages. During the fourth year, students perform clinical rotations in different departments of the Veterinary Teaching Hospital at their school.  In-depth study  The fifth year is a year of deepening that allows students to learn more about a particular subject. This deepening year should not be confused with a specialization, which comes after the seven years of study leading to the Veterinary Doctorate State Diploma (Dipl√¥me d'Etat de docteur v√©t√©rinaire (DEV)). There are deepening in clinical pathways and in non-clinical pathways.  Specialization  = Internship = = Residence =  History  = Eighteenth century = King Council decision that allows the Veterinary School of Lyon to take the title of Royal Veterinary School Claude Bourgelat is considered the founder of scientific veterinary medicine in France and around the world.Article History of the veterinary profession on the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons' website (UK) By his willingness to provide instruction to blacksmiths, who were until then the only people to treat diseases of domestic animals, he was at the origin of the training of veterinarians in France.

But these inscriptions are of different types. Considering their locations and their appearances, for the ease of studying, they are classified as follows: # Cave Inscriptions # Rock Inscriptions Galpotha inscription # Slab Inscriptions # Pillar Inscriptions From the name itself it's easy to understand what type of these inscriptions are. Cave inscriptions can be found in Mihintala, Wessagiriya, Sithulpawwa, and Ritigala. Some examples for the rock inscriptions are the Galwala inscription, the bilingual inscription found in Gadaladeniya and the Alawala inscription. Polonnaruwa galpotha inscription, the Mihintale slab inscription and the Thonigala inscription are examples for the slab inscriptions. Badulla inscription and the Katugahagalge inscription are classified under pillar inscriptions. Cave inscriptions are found to be the oldest type of inscriptions. They are inscribed below the drip ledge (katarama) of caves. These are seen almost in every cave belonging to the early period. At the beginning the inscriptions had two or three short lines containing the information about donations made to bhikkus. But after the 2nd century A.C according to the Mihintale inscription, Jethavanaramaya sanskrit inscription and Badulla pillar inscription the inscriptions have got lengthy descriptions. The inscription on Abhayagiri terrace has 16 long lines. The inscription on the terrace of Dakunu Vihara is spread out on 17 slabs. Some inscriptions were produced in multiple copies. Thirteen copies of the Vevalkatiya inscription of Udaya IV were placed in various part of the Rajarata. After the 10th century A.C these have become more descriptive because they contained appreciations made for some kings. Some of the uses of these inscriptions are, * to fill the gaps in some historic factsA pillar inscription * to get evidence for the historic facts * to know information which have not been written in books * to know about the ancient methods of controlling the temples * to know the ancient methods of administrating the countries * to know the old social traditions and customs * to get information about the economy of ancient sri lanka * to get a knowledge about the evolution of the language and the letters * to get other cultural records * to know different symbols used for different purposes * to know sinhala grammar * to know the names o the kings, rural kings and princes * to know the designations of the royal officers * to get an idea about the trade and industries in ancient country * to get information about the religious activities and other religious beliefs  Evolution  At the beginning the inscriptions had two or three short lines containing the information about donations made to bhikkhus. But after the 2nd century A.C according to the Mihintale inscription, Jethavanaramaya sanskrit inscription and Badulla pillar inscription the inscriptions have got lengthy descriptions.

Thirteen copies of the Vevalkatiya inscription of Udaya IV were placed in various part of the Rajarata. After the 10th century A.C these have become more descriptive because they contained appreciations made for some kings. When considering the letters and the symbols used in the inscriptions, inscriptions written in different languages have been found. It is clear that people have used brahmi letters, Pali and Sanskrit to write these inscriptions. Here from these inscriptions information can be gathered in order to get a knowledge about the evolution of the sinhala letters and the development of the language, grammar rules, and structure.

Because of these people could know the donar and his/her title, genealogy, profession, and status. When studying these inscriptions, it is clear that donation was not limited to kings and royalty, but also people of different classes. These form of inscriptions written in pre- and post-brahmi letters have been found in places such as Rajagirikanda and Aanaikkuttikanda.  Economy  A single inscription can yield information on many different subjects. These inscriptions provide information about the economy of ancient Sri Lanka. Information like the old trade methods, the occupations and the economic stability of people, ownership of lands, types of taxes which cannot be extracted from the literary resources can be found from them. For example, Godawaya pillar inscription says about the taxes levied in the Godapawatha Harbour, Badulla Pillar Inscription says about the administration of an old market and Perimiyankulam inscription provides information about old trade grades and industries.  Society  Stone inscriptions give facts about the spread of Buddhism, spread of the civilization and spread of the stone inscriptions. Moreover they help us to understand how far the kings had power over the country. Inscriptions reveal information that is not written in literary sources. For example, Kaduruwewa inscription says about five generations of ministers. When taking about the religious background, inscriptions provide information about bhikkhus, various religious beliefs and customs, administration of the temples, the lands owned by the temples and privileges. Mihintale pillar inscription, Abayagiriya sanskrit inscription and Kaludiya pokuna inscription tell about the administration of the temples and Sithulpawwa inscription says how the income gained by the judiciary was given to the temples. One of the most important uses of these inscriptions is that the information contained in these are contemporary to a particular incident. Therefore the information written in the literary sources can be proven by the inscriptions.

A pupil of Theodor Kullak, Fay traveled to Europe to study with Franz Liszt. Her letters home from Germany, including descriptions of her training and the concerts she attended, were published in 1880 as Music Study in Germany. These memoirs include a comprehensive biographical sketch of Liszt. Fay was born in 1844 in Bayou Goula, Louisiana. She was the third of six daughters and the fifth of nine children of the Rev. Charles Fay and Emily (Hopkins) Fay of Louisiana and St. Albans, Vermont. She was Charles Jerome Hopkins's niece. Her sister Rose Emily Fay married the conductor Theodore Thomas, and her sister Melusina Fay Peirce was the wife the American philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce. Amy Fay studied piano under Professor John Knowles Paine of Harvard and at the New England Conservatory of Music. From 1869 to 1875, she continued her lessons in Germany, where she studied with the most prominent teachers of Europe; pianists Carl Tausig, Theodor Kullak, Franz Liszt, and Ludwig Deppe. Deppe's technique for piano revolutionized her playing and served as the method she herself was to use for her students in the years to come. On returning to Boston, Fay became well known for her \\"piano conversations\\": recitals preceded by short lectures. She moved to Chicago and New York, where she was associated with the Women's Philharmonic Society of New York. She died on November 9, 1928.

It is not known when the infantry barracks were established but it is accepted that the artillery barracks were built in the aftermath of the Irish Rebellion and completed at the end of the 18th century. During the First World War the artillery barracks, at that time known as the cavalry barracks, served as the 1st cavalry depot providing accommodation for the 5th Royal Irish Lancers, the 9th Queen's Royal Lancers, the 12th Royal Lancers, the 16th The Queen's Lancers, the 17th Lancers and the 21st Lancers. During the Irish Civil War the barracks were seized by the anti- treaty forces; however in the ensuing battle there were many direct hits from gunfire. By the end of the Irish Civil War the infantry barracks were in a very dilapidated state and the artillery barracks had been largely destroyed when a direct hit exploded in the magazine. The artillery barracks were gone by the 1930s and were replaced by St. Carthage's Avenue.

He was born in Haugesund, and settled in Oslo from 1987. He has specialized on creating comics series based on classical literature. Among his early albums are De knyttede never from 1993 based on a novel by √òvre Richter Frich, and four volumes of Amputerte klassikere. He was awarded the Brage Prize for non-fiction in 2013, for the biography Munch, a collection of his albums based on the life of painter Edvard Munch. Munch has been translated into several languages, including French, Dutch, German, Polish, Danish and Korean, supported by Norla, the foundation for Norwegian Literature Abroad. Early publications  Kverneland published the comics strip Peer Grynt in the magazine Konk in 1980, when he was sixteen years old. In 1982 his strip Den moderne Odysseen, with the character \\"Karsten Zarathustra\\", was published in the magazine Brage, under pen name \\"S. Susej\\". During the period 1989-1991 he published various comics strips in the magazine Norsk MAD. Among these were Rotta Rolf, Ynglinge Saga, and Trikkekondukt√∏ren. He also contributed to the newspapers Dagbladet and Dag og Tid, and to the magazines Vagant and Inside Data. Adaptation of literary works Among Kverneland's specialties is the adaptation of classical literary texts into comics strips or albums. His album De knyttede never was awarded the Sproing Award in 1993. Further, he developed a series of \\"amputated classics\\", from 1994 onwards. =The clenched fists= Front cover of the comics album De knyttede never from 1993. De knyttede never () is an action novel from 1911, written by √òvre Richter Frich. It is the first of a series of 21 novels about the character \\"Jonas Fjeld\\", an athletic physician and adventurer. Kverneland had the first pages of his adaptation published in the magazine TEGN in 1991. The album was issued in 1993, and earned him the Sproing Award for best Norwegian comics series in 1993. During the creation process Kverneland had to do some historical research in order to get buildings, interior, clothing, historical setting etc. as correct as possible. He visited Bank of Norway to prepare for the bank robbery scene, and studied photos of old trains for the scenes from the recently opened Bergen Line. The \\"new\\" City hall, location for a reception held for the South Pole Expedition described in the novel, was pure fictional, as there was no new City Hall in Oslo in 1911. =Amputated classics= Front cover of the comics album Amputerte klassikere II from 1996. * Amputerte klassikere (album, 1994) * Amputerte klassikere II (album, 1996) * Amputerte klassikere III (album, 1999) * Garborg & co (2001) * Amputerte klassikere IV (album, 2001) Comics biographies Kverneland received a two years public grant in 2003. =Olaf Gulbransson= Front cover of the comics album Olaf G. from 2004.

SamƒÅdhƒÅna, which develops mental concentration, is one of the six virtues (shad sampat) that a seeker after truth is expected to develop so as to cultivate the attitude of detachment from all selfish-ends; it develops the ability to hold the mind on a single point. For achieving this qualification the mind is required to be sufficiently trained, and is achieved by the combination of the other five virtues ‚Äì sama, dama, uparati, titiksha and ≈õraddhƒÅ. Shankara defines it as a state of poise and tranquility that the mind gains when it is trained to revel continuously in the concept of a perfect ideal, at once universal and omnipotent. SamƒÅdhƒÅna is the single- pointedness of the mind (‡§ö‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡•à‡§ï‡§æ‡§ó‡•ç‡§∞‡§§‡§æ); it is the state of the mind which one has with a single goal in sight which is gained on the strength of the control of the mind and the senses, withdrawal from worldly pursuits, endurance of life-pangs and faith in the scriptures and teacher‚Äôs instructions. It is one of the four requisites for realization of Brahman (sadhana Chatushtaya) that directs the energy of consciousness towards moksha ('liberation') and not towards siddhi or vibhuti ('accomplishments'). In the Mahabharata(277:6), samƒÅdhƒÅna is explained as the absorption of meditation or as that state of mind in which one has no longer any affection for the world. In his Vivekachudamani (Sloka 27), Shankara explains that:- :‡§∏‡§Æ‡•ç‡§Ø‡§ó‡§æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§•‡§æ‡§™‡§®‡§Ç ‡§¨‡•Å‡§¶‡•ç‡§ß‡•á‡§É ‡§∂‡•Å‡§¶‡•ç‡§ß‡•á ‡§¨‡•ç‡§∞‡§π‡•ç‡§Æ‡§£‡§ø ‡§∏‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡§¶‡§æ  :‡§§‡§§‡•ç‡§∏‡§Æ‡§æ‡§ß‡§æ‡§®‡§Æ‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡•Å‡§ï‡•ç‡§§‡§Ç ‡§® ‡§§‡•Å ‡§ö‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø ‡§≤‡§æ‡§≤‡§®‡§Æ‡•ç  the perfect establishment of the buddhi always in the pure (nirguna) Brahman (free from all limitations) is said to be samƒÅdhƒÅna, not the indulgence of the mind (not giving free rein to the mind to stray at will).

The highway is maintained by Rijkswaterstaat. Route description In the Netherlands, E 22 starts in southwestern Amsterdam at De Nieuwe Meer Interchange where A4 starts its course and branches off from the A10, the ring road around Amsterdam. E 22 runs north concurrent with Ring A10. After a few exits A5 joins E 22/A10 just before E 22/A10, concurrent, pass under the IJsselmeer using a group of tunnels called the first and second Coen Tunnel. Through the Coen Tunnels, E 22/A10/ have extra lanes only used in rush hour. Shortly after they get to Coenplein-Noord Interchange, where Ring A10 continues east and E 22 branches of to the northwest, now concurrent with A8. After the first and only exit of the section where E 22 and A8 run concurrently, A8 has extra lanes used in rush hour only, these extra rush hour lanes are also present on the next road, A7, until Purmerend, that crosses A8 at Zaandam Interchange, and that E 22 starts running concurrently with from there on to the northeast. From Purmerend, the E 22/A7 runs about north, passing by Hoorn and Medemblik, until it reaches Den Oever, where the southwestern end of the Afsluitdijk is located. E 22/A7 continues over the Afslutidijk for about with no exits, with the Wadden Sea on the left and the IJsselmeer on the right. After running over the Afsluitdijk, the road continues to the southeast, passing by Bolsward and Sneek until it reaches the town of Joure. In Sneek though, A7 turns into N7 to function as the southern part of the ring road around Sneek, with a lowered speed limit. In Joure, A6 joins E 22/A7 from the south on a traffic circle which also functions as an exit allowing traffic from Joure to enter the motorway. It is the last traffic circle in the Netherlands on a motorway with no grade separated ramps, though it will be upgraded from 2015 to 2017 to half a stack interchange. From Joure E 22/A7 continues to the north east, passing by Heerenveen and Drachten, where near both cities it crosses A32 and N31 respectively, both of the interchanges are built as cloverleaf interchanges. After passing by Drachten, the road continues to Groningen, where it touches the border between the Groningen and Drenthe provinces, but doesn't enter Drenthe. In Groningen, A7 becomes N7 and functions as the southern part of the ring road around Groningen, and is designed as freeway with some at grade intersections, and traffic lights at Julianaplein Interchange, where E 232/A28 arrives from the south and has its northern terminus here in Groningen. N7 continues running to the east in Groningen until it reaches N46 at Interchange Euvelgunne, where you have to make a right to stay on E 22/N7 going to the southeast. From here on, it is only about to the German border. Before that, it passes by Hoogezand-Sappemeer and Winschoten, and between the two it crosses N33 at a partial cloverleaf interchange. Continuing east it finally arrives at the town of Nieuweschans, located at the Dutch side of the border. This is the eastern terminus of A7, and E 22 continues east in Germany, here concurrent with the German A280. History =European route alignment history = * In 1950, when the e-roads were first aligned, part of E10 and part of E35 followed the current alignment of E22 in the Netherlands. E10 from Amsterdam to Groningen, though in Friesland following N31 / A31 instead of N7 / A7 as E22 does nowadays. And E35 from Groningen to the German border. E22, back then, ran from Berlin in Germany to Przemysl in the USSR. * In 1954, E10, originally running from Paris, through Brussels, Antwerpen, Breda, Rotterdam, Amsterdam, Leeuwarden and Groningen, now had its Northern terminus in Amsterdam and thereby no longer followed any section of the current E22 in the Netherlands. * In 1963, E10 was back to its 1950 alignment, putting its northern terminus back in Groningen and following the current alignment of E22. * In 1975, E22 was realigned from its route that it followed then, from Germany to the USSR, to its current alignment from Amsterdam to the German border east of Groningen (the part in the Netherlands). E10, the road that used to follow E22's current alignment was no longer in use (it would be used in a few years, but not on E22's current alignment). E35 was realigned to a totally different course from Hoek van Holland to Arnhem in the Netherlands (and to Cologne, Frankfurt am Main, Basel and Rome beyond that). =Dutch underlying road construction history= In 1950, when E10 and E35 followed the course of current E22, most of the underlying road wasn't constructed yet. There were only the N7 from Hoorn-Noord to Lambertschaag, from Middenmeer in North Holland to Bolsward in Friesland over the Afsluitdijk, from Sneek to Heerenveen and from Sappemeer to Scheemda, and the provincial road S14 from Zaandijk to Purmerend-Zuid, all with at grade intersections and one lane in each direction.  In North Holland  From 1966 to 1975, motorway A10, the ring road around Amsterdam was constructed with grade separated intersections and mostly three lanes in each direction between E22's western terminus in the Netherlands at Interchange De Nieuwe Meer and Interchange Coenplein (now known as Interchange Coenplein-Noord), where E22 will stop following A10 and starts running over A8's alignment to the northwest. Between 1966 and 1968 A8, the road E22 runs concurrently with between Amsterdam and Zaandam, was constructed with grade separated intersections and two lanes in each direction. In 1959, a missing link between two parts of N7 was constructed, from Lambertschaag to Middenmeer, with at grade intersections and one lane in each direction. Between 1976 and 1982, the last missing link in N7/A7 in North Holland was constructed as A7, in parts, between Purmerend-Zuid and Hoorn-Noord, with grade separated intersections and two lanes in each direction. By 1985, the entire road from Interchange Zaandam to Zurich, east of the Afsluitdijk, the part of N7/A7 in North Holland, was upgraded to A7 with grade separated intersections and two lanes in each direction. Between 2007 and 2014, a second tunnel, the second Coentunnel, under the IJ was constructed, widening A10 here to three lanes in each direction with two additional reversible lanes to help traffic flow in rush hour. A8 between Coenplein Interchange and Zaandam Interchange was widened to three lanes in each direction in 1990, and then widened again to four lanes in each direction in 2013. In 2015, a fifth southbound lane was added between Zaandam Interchange and Coenplein Interchange, and northbound between a gas station just north of exit Oostzaan and Zaandam Interchange, which are narrower and only opened in rush hour.  Between Zurich and Joure  In Friesland, N7 was extended east beyond Bolsward to Nijland as A7 with grade separated intersections and two lanes in each direction. Between 1972 and 1978, all of N7 between Zurich and Joure Interchange was opened and/or upgraded to A7 with grade separated intersections and two lanes in each direction, except for the section that was the southern part of the ring road around Sneek, which remained N7 with a much lower maximum speed, though with grade separated intersections as well. The part of N7 that functions as the ring road around Sneek was upgraded again between 2008 and 2010, and now has two lanes in each direction.  Between Joure and the German border  Between 1956 and 1960, N7 was extended east from Heerenveen to Groningen, and the part between Sappemeer and Scheemda was also extended in both directions between 1955 and 1957 and would then run between Hoogezand and Winschoten, all with at grade intersections and one lane in each direction. In 1969 N7 was opened between Winschoten and the German border near Nieuweschans with grade separated intersections and one lane in each direction. Between 1972 and 1973, the missing link between Groningen and Hoogezand was opened as A7 with grade separated intersections and two lanes in each direction, though with a slightly different course through Groningen than it has nowadays, it used to go over the Europaweg, until Euvelgunne Interchange was opened in 2009. Between 1972 and 1983, N7 between Heerenveen and western Groningen was upgraded to A7 with grade separated intersections and two lanes in each direction. Between 1988 and 1993, N7 between Hoogezand and the German border was upgraded to A7 with grade separated intersections and two lanes in each direction. It was also then realigned to go north of Scheemda instead of through it. In 2009, as before mentioned, Euvelgunne Interchange was opened, and N7 would now approach this interchange from the west and then go south to Engelbert, with two lanes in each direction, grade separated intersections, but a lowered speed, meaning it would still be called N7.  Future  Owing to increasing numbers of commuters, a number of upgrades will be seen before 2030 from the western terminus of E22, where it is concurrent with A10, to the city of Purmerend, comprising the roads A10, A8 and A7. The Coentunnels currently only use 8 of their 10 lanes, when A7 and A8 will be upgraded, all lanes in the Coentunnel might have to be used to funnel through all the extra traffic. A8 will see an upgrade to six lanes in each direction between Coenplein Interchange and Zaandam interchange. Between Zaandam Interchange and exit Purmerend Zuid, A7 will be upgraded from its current two lanes in each direction to four lanes in each direction. Money for the project is already reserved by the Dutch government and will be available in 2023. Interchange Joure, where A6 meets E22, that is concurrent with A7 there, is currently build as a traffic circle. It has no grade separated parts which results in some traffic being favoured over other traffic. This is why a new interchange is being constructed between 2015 and 2017, which will be half a stack interchange. It will be placed southwest of the current traffic circle and traffic from A6 from the south will get onto A7 without having to use an exit, thus being the dominant route. When arriving from the west on A7/E22, this means you have to use ramps to stay on A7/E22. A new exit, Joure, will be created just south of where the current traffic circle is now, since an exit used to be incorporated in the traffic circle.

It was designed by Alexander Brown Wilson and built from to . It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Lamb House, circa 1904 This substantial, two-storeyed brick residence was erected for John Lamb, co-proprietor of the successful Queen Street drapery establishment of Edwards & Lamb, and a businessman with enlightened attitudes toward his employees. The house was designed by established Brisbane architect Alexander Brown Wilson and was constructed over a twelve-month period by builder W Anthony at a contract price of . Kangaroo Point was Brisbane's earliest suburb, dating from the 1840s. From at least the 1860s, the higher land at Kangaroo Point attracted middle class residents who erected substantial homes overlooking the Brisbane River. The construction of this house in the early 1900s illustrates the continued attraction of this quiet but centrally located suburb for the middle class - a trend which was sustained into the 1920s. The house remains the property of the Lamb family.  Description  Lamb House is a large, two-storeyed, red brick residence with a multi-gabled roof clad in terracotta tiles. Conspicuously situated above the Kangaroo Point Cliffs at the southern end of the suburb, overlooking the South Brisbane and Town reaches of the Brisbane River, The house is an inner city landmark, prominent from many parts of the Brisbane central business district, the river and the Captain Cook Bridge and Pacific Motorway. Queen Anne influences are evident in the timber and roughcast gable infill designs, the ornate cement mouldings to the entrance portico- cum-observation tower, and the elaborate chimney stacks and tall terracotta chimney pots. Verandahs on three sides at both levels have timber posts, arches and weatherboard friezes. The original plans indicate vestibule and stairwell, dining, drawing and morning rooms, kitchen and service areas on the ground floor, and six bedrooms and a bathroom on the first floor. The residence has substantial grounds with mature trees and gardens. Wrought iron entrance gates and the decorative masonry fence to Leopard Street are original. Externally the building presents a highly intact Federation period facade in a prominent riverside and garden setting.  Heritage listing  Home was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Its construction illustrates the sustained development of Kangaroo Point as a residential suburb from the 1840s, and in particular the continued appeal to middle class residents of the high land overlooking the Brisbane River at Kangaroo Point, contributing to our understanding of residential and social hierarchies in Brisbane, and of the role of the Brisbane River within this structure. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. Lamb House, erected , is a rare surviving example of a grand, intact Federation period residence in the Brisbane district. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Lamb House is a most accomplished building in its architectural design, materials, workmanship and setting, and is significant as a major example of the domestic work of notable Brisbane architect Alexander B Wilson. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The prominently situated residence has landmark quality and makes a strong aesthetic contribution to the townscape along the Kangaroo Point cliffs. Significant also are the views from Lamb House of the Brisbane River and central business district, which appear to have influenced the siting and design of the house. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history.

Ali emerged into prominence as an able fiscal administrator and deputy to his older brother Ahmad. Eventually he came to lead one of the two major and rival court factions during al- Muqtadir's caliphate, the Banu'l-Furat, the other being the group of officials around the commander-in-chief Mu'nis al-Muzaffar and the vizier Ali ibn Isa al-Jarrah. He played an important role in the selection of al-Muqtadir as caliph in 908, going on to serve as vizier in 908‚Äì912, during which time he succeeded in re-incorporating Fars into the Caliphate and to restore a measure of authority over the Sajids of Adharbayjan. After a second tenure in 917‚Äì918 he was imprisoned by his successor, and was released in 923, becoming vizier for the third and last time soon after. His brutality towards his rivals during his third tenure, coupled with military failures against the Qarmatians, caused his deposition and execution, along with his son al- Muhassin, on 18 July 924. Life Map showing the Abbasid Caliphate after al- Mu'tadid's campaigns of consolidation, ca. 900: areas under direct Abbasid control in dark green, areas under loose Abbasid suzerainty, but under autonomous governors, in light green Ali's family had been of some prominence at Baghdad already in the early 9th century, but it was his father Muhammad ibn Musa who first occupied an important administrative post. Ali began his career alongside his brother Ahmad during the late caliphate of al-Mu'tamid (reigned 870‚Äì892) and the regency of al-Muwaffaq. Both were prot√©g√©s of the fellow Shi'ite Isma'il ibn Bulbul, who, after becoming vizier to both al- Mu'tamid and al-Muwaffaq in 885, brought them into the administration as fiscal experts and entrusted them with the department of land revenue of the Sawad. Following Ibn Bulbul's dismissal, Ahmad was imprisoned for a while, but at the accession of al-Mu'tadid (r. 892‚Äì902) in 892, he was released and entrusted once more with the fiscal department of the Sawad, and later of all the land tax departments, with Ali as his deputy. The Ibn al-Furat brothers and their supporters came to form one of the two major groups that would dominate the Abbasid bureaucracy over the next decades, the Banu'l-Furat or Furatids. Their main rivals were another group of secretarial families, the Banu'l-Jarrah or Jarrahids, headed by Muhammad ibn Dawud and his nephew Ali ibn Isa al-Jarrah, who replaced the Banu'l-Furat as heads of the fiscal departments in 899. The two groups represented simply different factions in a struggle for office and power, but there are indications of \\"ideological\\" differences as well: many of the Banu'l-Jarrah families hailed from converted Nestorian families and employed Christians in the bureaucracy, in addition to maintaining closer ties with the military, while the Banu'l-Furat tried to impose firm civilian control of the army and (not quite openly) favoured Shi'ism. The rivalry between the two groups was intense but mostly restrained as their fortunes shifted repeatedly, but torture and the forced confiscation of a deposed official's possessions were commonplace under the old-established system known as mu·π£ƒÅdara, which forced deposed officials to return the money they had embezzled; in effect, however, it practically forced officials to embezzle while on office so as to be able to provide the requisite sums during the mu·π£ƒÅdara inquest. The two brothers continued to serve as heads of the fiscal departments in the caliphate of al-Muktafi (r. 902‚Äì908). After his brother's death in 904, Ali became the chief aide to the vizier al-Abbas ibn al-Hasan al-Jarjara'i. The death of al-Muktafi in 908 left the issue of the succession open, and the vizier al-Abbas sought the advice of the most important bureaucrats on the choice of a successor. Following Ali's advice, the senior bureaucrats opted for al-Muktafi's 13-year-old brother Ja'far, who was seen as week, pliable, and easy to be manipulated by the senior officials. The choice of al-Muqtadir (r. 908‚Äì932) was, in the words of historian Hugh N. Kennedy, \\"a sinister development\\" and inaugurated one \\"of the most disastrous reigns in the whole of Abbasid history [...] a quarter of a century in which all of the work of [al-Muqtadir's] predecessors would be undone\\". Following the abortive coup by the supporters of Ibn al-Mu'tazz on 17 December, on 19 December 908 Ali was himself appointed vizier. Gold dinar of al-Muqtadir, 910/11 His first tenure as vizier was one of near absolute authority, with only a small group of palace officials, the caliph's mother and some court eunuchs, providing some checks to his authority, and this only from a distance. Among the successes of the period were the recovery of Fars, and the recognition of Abbasid suzerainty by the Sajid ruler of Adharbayjan, Yusuf ibn Abi'l-Saj, in exchange for a‚Äîrather modest‚Äîannual tribute of 120,000 dirhams. Grateful for the settlement, Yusuf henceforth considered Ali his protector, and even included his name in his coinage. Soon, however, Ali began to abuse his power and embezzle large sums from the treasury, which led to his dismissal and arrest on 21 July 912. He was replaced by Muhammad ibn Ubayd Allah al-Khaqani. He was re-appointed to the vizierate on 3 June 917, succeeding his old rival Ali ibn Isa, but his second tenure was troubled by the rebellion of Yusuf, who had begun withholding the tribute to Baghdad and has seized a number of Samanid-ruled provinces in north-western Iran. Ali tried to intercede on Yusuf's behalf, but to no avail: he was dismissed in November 918, and Yusuf was defeated and taken prisoner to Baghdad by the Abbasid commander-in-chief, Mu'nis al-Muzaffar, in 919. Ali's successor was Hamid ibn al-Abbas, an ambitious man, but already over eighty years old and utterly unfamiliar with administrative affairs. During his vizierate, real power was exercised by his deputy, who was none other than Ali ibn Isa. Ali remained imprisoned in the caliphal palace throughout the period, being released only after Ibn al-Abbas's dismissal in 923, and was re-appointed to the vizierate for a third and final time on 7 August. Ali's last tenure, from August 923 to June 924 is unanimously condemned by Arab historians as a dark period, the \\"year of destruction\\". Instead of treating his deposed rivals with clemency, as he had during his previous two tenures, Ali, assisted by his son al-Muhassin, seized the opportunity to avenge himself on anyone who had wronged him, and liberally employed violence to extort large sums from those appointed to office under Hamid. To further bolster his own position, he sent the powerful Mu'nis al-Muzaffar to semi-exile in Raqqa. The government's authority was further undermined by the sudden and dramatic resurgence of the Qarmatian threat, with the sack of Basra in 923 and the destruction of the returning caravan of hajj pilgrims in April/May the next year. Unable to stop nor to effectively respond to these attacks, Ali's popularity among the populace plummeted, leading to riots in Baghdad. At the same time, his brutality caused resentment among the bureaucracy and the financial straits of the Caliphate meant that he could not pay the army's salaries regularly. As a result, increasing pressure was put on the Caliph by members of the court and the military to act. Finally, in early June 924 al-Muqtadir had Ali and his son arrested. Al-Muqtadir retained much sympathy for the man who had been his mentor, and whose intelligence and ability he respected, but when the former vizier and his son were brought before the Caliph to stand trial, but Ali lost whatever goodwill he retained by his insolent attitude. Ali and al-Muhassin were promptly executed on 18 July 924. Of the mighty Banu'l-Furat, Ali's nephew al-Fadl managed to regain high office after 927, even serving as vizier briefly in 932 and in 937. Character and assessment Ali ibn al-Furat was a complex personality. Well-educated and highly cultured, he was very intelligent and remarkably eloquent. He distinguished himself as an extremely able fiscal administrator, \\"committed to the reform of abuse and the raising of state revenues without oppression\\" (Hugh Kennedy) and able to \\"solve rapidly what appeared to be the most complicated problems\\" (Dominique Sourdel). As a courtier, he exercised power in the style of a \\"grand seigneur\\" (Kennedy), having an affinity for luxury and dispensing extravagant largesse on his followers to enhance his own image. At the same time, his primary loyalty was not to the state or the caliph, but to the advancement and enrichment of himself and his followers, which formed almost a Twelver Shia \\"secret politicoreligious party\\" (Sourdel) within the heart of the Sunni Caliphate. Furthermore, despite combating corruption in others, he was not above breaking the law for his own profit, and was \\"to an extent ruthless and unscrupulous when it came to furthering his own interests\\" (Kennedy).

Origins The high cliffs separating the two towns (then villages) were a major obstacle to economic development in the 19th century. Because of the remoteness of the area, and rugged geography, villagers had to rely on the sea for most deliveries of coal, lime, foodstuffs and other essentials, which had then to be carried by packhorses and carts up the steep hill to Lynton. The cliffs also posed problems for the burgeoning tourist industry. Holiday makers began to arrive at Lynmouth on paddle steamers from Bristol, Swansea and other Bristol Channel ports, from about 1820. Ponies, donkeys and carriages were available for hire, but the steep gradients led to the animals having only short working lives. The first proposals for a rail-based lift, able to carry passengers and goods, were made in 1881, although this first scheme was to have been steam powered. Construction The water-powered railway was designed by George Croydon Marks (later Baron Marks of Woolwich), and paid for mainly by his business partner, the publisher Sir George Newnes. Newnes, who owned a large residence at nearby Hollerday Hill, also backed the Lynton & Barnstaple Railway in 1898, and the Lynton Town Hall in 1900. Construction work ‚Äì relying entirely on manual labour ‚Äì began in 1887 and was completed in less than three years. The railway uses clifftop railway cars designed to operate like lifts. The railway comprises two cars, each capable of transporting 40 passengers, joined by a continuous cable running around a 5 ft 6 in (1.676 m) pulley at each end of the incline. Water feeds through 5-inch (127 mm) pipes from the West Lyn River ‚Äì over a mile away ‚Äì into tanks under the floor of the upper car. Each car has a 700-imperial-gallon (3,182 L; 841 US gal) tank mounted between the wheels. Water is discharged from the lower car, until the heavier top car begins to descend, with the speed controlled by a brakeman traveling on each car. The parallel 3 ft 9 in (1,143 mm) gauge[2] tracks (which bow out at the centre point, to allow the cars to pass) rise 500 feet (152.4 m) and are 862 feet (262.7 m) long, giving the line a gradient of 1:1.724 (58%). Operations An Act of Parliament formed the Lynmouth & Lynton Lift Company in 1888, and a further Act gave the company perpetual rights to the water from the Lyn Valley. Opened on Easter Monday in 1890, the railway has been in continuous use ever since. It is a private railway and not part of National Rail. The station has two platforms, a cafe and plenty of room for crowded days. Trains run frequently to Lynmouth Bay. An unusual feature for such a line is a halt just below Lynton station, with road access, at North Walk. This was used to transport larger freight items (the car bodies can be removed to provide a flat load bed). Early motor cars were carried up the hill in this way. During rail replacement over the winter of 2006, the halt was used extensively for access and material storage.Lynton & Barnstaple Railway Magazine, Spring 2007 The railway is now classified as a listed monument.

It was equipped with four 0.5 inch (12.7 mm) M2 Browning machine guns in an M45 Quadmount. 2700 were produced by White Motor Company from May 1943 to March 1944, with 568 M13 MGMCs and 109 T10 half-tracks being converted into M16s as well. The chassis was derived from the T1E2 chassis, an earlier version of the M13. Based on an M3 half-track chassis, it replaced the M13 MGMC half-track after early 1944. As aircraft became more advanced, the usefulness of the M16 was reduced. In the Korean War, it was relegated primarily to the ground- support role, being put out of service in the U.S. Army in 1954. Nicknamed the \\"Meat Chopper\\", the M16 was famous for its effectiveness against low-flying aircraft and infantry, making it extremely popular with soldiers. It was used by the United States Army, the British Commonwealth, and South Korea. A similar version of the M16, the M17, was based on the M5 half-track and exported via Lend-Lease to the Soviet Union.  Specifications  The specifications of the M16 were similar to those of the M3 half-track. It was 21 ft 4 in (6.5 m) long (with a wheelbase of ), 7 ft 1 in (2.16 m) wide, and 7 ft 8 in (2.34 m) high and weighed 9.9 short tons (9 t).Ness (2002), p. 202. It had suspension consisting of vertical volute spring suspension for the tracks and leaf springs for the wheels. It was powered by a 128-horsepower (95 kW) White 160AX 386 cubic inch (6,300 cc) 6-cylinder gasoline engine. It had a compression ratio of 6.3:1 and a 60 US gallon (230 l) fuel tank. It could reach a top speed of 41.7 mph (67.1 km/h) and a range of 175 miles (282 km) and a power to weight ratio of 15.8 horsepower per tonne.Berndt (1993), p. 152. It had a main armament of four 0.5 in (12.7 mm) machine guns in a M45 Quadmount and 12 millimeters of armor on the front and the sides.  Development  An M16 in March 1951, during the Korean War The M16 was an improvement on the twin .50 caliber M2 Browning heavy machine gun equipped M13 MGMC and M14 MGMC (built on an M3 and M5 half-track chassis respectively). It was based on an earlier model of the M13 (the T1E2), but the M33 Maxson mount was replaced with the M45 Quadmount and the M2 half-track chassis was replaced by the M3 chassis. This prototype was originally designated as the T61 MGMC, but after trials at Aberdeen it was accepted as the M16 Multiple Gun Motor Carriage. A few corrections were made on a pilot vehicle in early 1943 (including the addition of a gun shield) before production started.Hunnicutt (2002), pp. 140‚Äì142. A total of 2,877 were produced by the White Motor Company during the period from May 1943 to March 1944, while 568 M13s and 109 T10 half-tracks were also converted into M16s.Ness (2002), p. 196.Doyle (2011), pp. 394‚Äì395. Further production of the M13 and M14 was ceased in favor of production of the M16 and M17 (an M16 built on a M5 half-track chassis).Hunnicutt (2010), p. 123.  Service history  A damaged M16 half- track at a German museum in 2004 The M16 MGMC entered service in early 1944, with the M13 taken out of action soon after. The M16 was nicknamed \\"The Meat Chopper\\" for its deadly firepower, and was extremely popular with troops. In addition to its anti-aircraft role, the M16 was used in an infantry support role, frequently accompanied by the M15 half-track. The M17 MGMC primarily served with the Soviet Union as part of Operation Bagration and a few other battles.Berndt (1994), pp. 35‚Äì37 The M16 saw service with U.S. forces in the Italian Campaign, and Operation Overlord, the Battle of Arracourt, and the Ardennes Offensive in northern Europe.Zaloga (1994), p. 39.Zaloga (1994), p. 40. Small numbers were supplied to the United Kingdom and France under Lend- Lease. The vehicle was also used widely in the Korean War by the South Korean army, the United States Marine Corps, and the U.S. Army. As aircraft became more advanced over the M16's lifetime, its role as a mobile anti-aircraft weapon became limited. During the Korean War, it served mainly in the ground- support role, at which it was highly effective. In late 1951, it was declared as \\"limited standard\\" and largely taken out of service from the U.S. Army in Korea, although a few examples served until the end of the war.Bowers & Greenwood (2011), p. 405.

On December 27, 2014 she succeeded the term-limited Cedric Glover, her fellow Democrat, in the highest position in Shreveport municipal government. She failed in her bid for a second term in the runoff election held on December 8, 2018, having been defeated by another Democrat, Adrian Perkins. Education and politics Tyler is the seventh of nine children of Leroy and Ida Haley Spearman. She was born in Blanchard and reared on a dairy farm. She picked cotton as a girl and ironed and cleaned a residence to earn her lunch money. She graduated as valedictorian from Herndon High School in Belcher and earned a National Merit Scholarship to the Grambling State University, from where she received a Bachelor of Science degree. She taught at Youree Drive Middle School for twenty-three years until she was appointed as the school's first female African-American principal. She obtained a Master of Education degree from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. She completed forty-two graduate hours through Southern University at Shreveport, Louisiana State University at Shreveport, and Northwestern State University in Natchitoches.. In addition to Shreveport, she has resided in New York City, in Houston and Killeen. In 1994 the Caddo Parish School Board named Tyler Director of Middle Schools and elevated her to deputy superintendent. In 2000, Tyler became deputy superintendent/chief academic officer for the New Orleans city public schools where she served for three years. In 2003, she returned to the Caddo Parish School Board in Shreveport as the parish superintendent. In 2004 she was a member of the education transition team for incoming governor of Louisiana Kathleen Blanco. In 2007 she was named \\"Louisiana Superintendent of the Year\\". In 2007 Tyler assumed the position as Deputy State Superintendent of Education under state superintendent Paul Pastorek. Tyler served as interim Louisiana state education superintendent; having served in that capacity from May 2011 to January 2012 between the appointments of Pastorek and John C. White. In the runoff election for mayor of Shreveport that took place on December 6, 2014, Tyler handily defeated an Independent candidate, teacher Victoria Provenza. Tyler received 34,208 votes (63.4 percent) to Provenza's 19,781 (36.6 percent). A third candidate, State Representative Patrick C. Williams, was eliminated in the primary election with 12,880 votes (21.7 percent). Tyler had led in the primary as well with 26,017 votes (43.7 percent) to Provenza's 15,155 (25.5 percent). Tyler is included among the \\"Ten Most Influential Women in Northwest Louisiana.\\" In her bid for a second term as mayor, in the nonpartisan blanket primary held on November 6, 2018, Tyler faced Democrats Adrian Perkins and Steven Jackson and Republicans Lee O. Savage Jr. and Jim Taliaferro. Tyler trailed in the primary with 24 percent of the vote and faced fellow Democrat Adrian Perkins in the runoff primary. Because Savage and Taliaferro divided the Republican vote, 34 percent of the primary total, the GOP was shut out of the mayoral runoff. In the runoff election, Tyler lost to Perkins, who polled 25,138 votes (64.4 percent) to Tyler's 13,895 (35.6 percent). Personal life Tyler became the focus of controversy near the end of her first mayoral campaign when she confirmed reports uncovered by the political consultant Elliott Stonecipher and others that she had shot her first husband, Clyde Edward Harris, to death with a pistol at her parent's residence at 1807 Ebony Street in Shreveport on August 5, 1968. Tyler claimed that Harris had repeatedly beaten her. She was twenty-three at the time; he was twenty-four, and they had an infant son. Tyler told police at the time that she suspected Harris had been unfaithful to her and that the two had been estranged for much of their brief marriage. They lived at 1433 Harvard Street. The death was ruled an \\"accidental and justifiable homicide,\\" and the Caddo Parish district attorney never charged Ollie Tyler with a crime. Tyler much later accused her father of domestic abuse and blamed him largely for an unhappy childhood. Tyler is the widow of the Reverend James C. Tyler (1941-1990), whom she wed in 1972. He was employed by Melton Truck Lines and was an associate of the minister and civil rights figure Herman Farr, one of the first African Americans elected to the Shreveport City Council in 1978, when the chamber was converted to the single- member district concept. A native of DeSoto Parish, James Tyler is interred at the Upper Zion Baptist Church Cemetery in Blanchard. Tyler has one son, Bruce Anthony \\"Tony\\" Tyler, who was born in 1968, the same year as the shooting of his father, Clyde Harris. Tony Harris was adopted by James Tyler and reared as Tyler's own son. Ollie Tyler also has a stepdaughter and two grandchildren.

The exterior, the large antique loom (1830) and the interior, are testimony of the once flourishing textile industry (and trade) around Leiden, in particular during the 16th and 17th century, when many home weavers supplied the draper's guild with high quality woolen cloth.

The museum has a weaver available most days to demonstrate the craft on a large loom. Products made during demonstrations are for sale. The museum is a short walking distance from the old Draper's guild, part of Museum De Lakenhal (Dutch for Cloth Hall) today. History of the building Located on a spot which had always been used as a laborer's home, the house fell almost victim to a great plan to modernize the city in the 1960s (which never materialized due to opposition). It was never granted the rijksmonument status. In the 1970s it attracted the attention of a small group of local historians and they formed Het Kleine Leidse Woonhuis in 1976 to save small old buildings in Leiden such as this one. The building was consolidated (not renovated) as a house in a neck-gable style around 1900. The mostly intact interior reflects living arrangements for workers in the early 20th-century in Leiden. An original cellar exists under the house and parts of the interior date back to the 17th-century.

Soil Compaction. In: Jakobsson, Christine: Ecosystem Health and Sustainable Agriculture 1: Sustainable Agriculture. Uppsala University. URL: www.balticuniv.uu.se/index.php/component/docman/doc_download/1256-chapter-28-soil- compaction- (accessed November 14th 2014). Compaction can adversely affect nearly all physical, chemical and biological properties and functions of soil.Whalley, W.R., Dumitru, E. & Dexter, A.R. (1995). Biological effects of soil compaction. Soil and Tillage Research, 35, 53‚Äì68. Together with soil erosion, it is regarded as the \\"costliest and most serious environmental problem caused by conventional agriculture.\\"FAO (2003). Soil Compaction - an unnecessary form of land degradation. p. 2. URL: http://www.fao.org/ag/ca/doc/Soil_compaction.pdf (accessed November 15th 2014) In agriculture, soil compaction is a complex problem in which soil, crops, weather and machinery interact. External pressure due to the use of heavy machinery and inappropriate soil management can lead to the compaction of subsoil, creating impermeable layers within the soil that restrict water and nutrient cycles. This process can cause on-site effects such as reduced crop growth, yield and quality as well as off-site effects such as increased surface water run-off, soil erosion, greenhouse gas emissions, eutrophication, reduced groundwater recharge and a loss of biodiversity. Unlike salinization or erosion, soil compaction is principally a sub-surface problem and therefore an invisible phenomenon.FAO (unknown). Conservation of natural resources for sustainable agriculture: what you should know about it. See page 2. URL: http://www.fao.org/ag/ca/training_materials/cd27-english/sc/soil_compaction.pdf (accessed November 14th 2014). Special identification methods are necessary to locate, monitor and manage the problem appropriately. History and current state Soil compaction is not a recent issue. Before the beginning of mechanized agriculture, the usage of plough-pans was associated with soil compaction.Batey, T. (2009). Soil compaction and soil management ‚Äì a review. In: Soil Use and Management, 12, 25, 335-345. See page 335. However, multiple studies have shown that modern farming techniques increase the risk of harmful soil compaction.Stalham, M.A., Allen, E.J. & Herry, F.X. (2005). Effects of soil compaction on potato growth and its removal by cultivation. Research review R261 British Potato Council, Oxford. The historic data basis for global soil compaction is generally very weak as there are only measurements or estimates for certain regions/countries at certain points in time. In 1991, it was estimated that soil compaction accounted for 4% (68.3 million hectares) of anthropogenic soil degradation worldwide.Oldeman, L.R., Hakkeling, R.T.A. and Sombroek, W.G. (1991). World map of the status of human-induced soil degradation. An explanatory note. ISRIC, Wageningen, UNEP, Nairobi. In 2013, soil compaction was regarded a major reason for soil degradation in Europe (appr. 33 million ha affected), Africa (18 million ha), Asia (10 million ha), Australia (4 million ha), and some areas of North America. More specifically, in Europe approximately 32% and 18% of the subsoils are highly and moderately vulnerable to compaction respectively. Mechanism In healthy, well- structured soils, particles interact with each other forming soil aggregates. The resulting soil structure increases in stability with the number of interactions between soil particles. Water and air fills the voids between soil particles, where water interacts with soil particles forming a thin layer around them. This layer can shield particle-particle interaction thus reducing the stability of soil structure.Hartge, Karl Heinrich and Horn, Rainer (1991). Einf√ºhrung in die Bodenphysik, Enke Verlag. 2. Auflage, p. 25-115 Mechanic pressure applied to the soil is counterbalanced by an increase of soil particle interactions. This implies a reduction in soil volume by reducing the voids in between soil particles. As a consequence water and air is displaced and soil bulk density increases, resulting in a reduced permeability for water and air.Jones, Robert JA and Spoor, G and Thomasson, AJ (2003). Vulnerability of subsoils in Europe to compaction: a preliminary analysis, Soil and Tillage Research. Vol. 73, 1, 131‚Äì143. Susceptibility of soil to compaction depends on several factors, which influence soil particle interactions: * Soil texture, with fine textured soils (high clay content) being more susceptible to compaction than coarse textured soils.Saffih-Hdadi, Kim and D√©fossez, Pauline and Richard, Guy and Cui, Y-J and Tang, A-M and Chaplain, V√©ronique (2009). A method for predicting soil susceptibility to the compaction of surface layers as a function of water content and bulk density, Soil and Tillage Research. Vol. 105, 1, 96‚Äì103 * Soil structure, with angular, heterogeneous structures being more stable. * Soil water content, a high water content increases susceptibility to compaction as the layer of water on the surface of soil particles shields interactions between soil particles * Initial bulk density, dense soils are more resistant to compaction as the number of particle interactions is higher.Saffih-Hdadi, K and D√©fossez, Pauline and Richard, Guy and Cui, Y-J and Tang, A-M and Chaplain, V√©ronique (2009).

The most relevant human-induced causes of soil compaction in agriculture are the use of heavy machineries, tillage practice itself, inappropriate choice of tillage systems, as well as livestock trampling. Use of large and heavy machineries for agriculture often causes not only topsoil but subsoil compaction. Subsoil compaction is more difficult to be regenerated than topsoil compaction. Not only may the weight of machineries i.e. axle load, but also velocity and number of passages affect the intensity of soil compaction.Taghavifar, H. and Mardani, A. (2014). Effect of velocity, wheel load and multipass on soil compaction, Journal of the Saudi Society of Agricultural Sciences 13 : 57 - 66.Hamza, M. and Anderson, W. (2005). Soil compaction in cropping systems: A review of the nature, causes and possible solutions , Soil and Tillage Research 82 : 121 ‚Äì 145. Inflation pressure of wheels and tyres also plays an important role for the degree of soil compaction.Batey, T. (2009). Soil compaction and soil management - a review, Soil Use and Management 25 : 335 - 345. Whether heavy machinery is in use or not, tillage practice itself can cause soil compaction. While the major cause of soil compaction in a tillage activity nowadays is due to machineries, the influence of compaction resulting from lighter equipments and animals to the topsoil should not be neglected.J. DeJong-Hughes, J. F. Moncrief, W. B. Voorhees, and J. B. Swan. 2001. Soil compaction: causes, effects and control. http://www.extension.umn.edu/agriculture/tillage/soil-compaction/#density- effects. (last accessed: 19.11.2014) Moreover, inappropriate choices of tillage systems may cause unnecessary soil compaction.FAO. 2014. Machinery, tools and equipment, 2. Soil tillage in Conservation Agriculture. http://www.fao.org/ag/ca/3b.html (last accessed: 20.11. 2014) It should however be noted that tillage activity could reduce topsoil compaction compared to no tillage activity in the long term.Alvarez, R. and Steinbach, H. (2009). A review of the effects of tillage systems on some soil physical properties, water content, nitrate availability and crops yield in the Argentine Pampas , Soil and Tillage Research 104 : 1 - 15. Significant livestock trampling resulting from livstock farming on meadows and agricultural land is also viewed major cause of soil compaction.Mulholland, B. and Fullen, M. A. (1991). Cattle trampling and soil compaction on loamy sands, Soil Use and Management 7 : 189-193. This is not affected whether the grazing is continuous or short term,Donkor, N. T., Gedir, J. V., Hudson, R. J., Bork, E. W., Chanasyk, D. S. and Naeth, M. A. (2002). Impacts of grazing systems on soil compaction and pasture production in Alberta, Canadian Journal of Soil Science 82 : 1-8. however it is affected by the intensity of grazing.Mapfumo, E., Chanasyk, D. S., Naeth, M. A. and Baron, V. S. (1999). Soil compaction under grazing of annual and perennial forages, Canadian Journal of Soil Science 79 : 191-199. Effects =On-site effects= Major effects on soil properties due to soil compaction are reduced air permeability and reduced water infiltration.Whalley, W., Dumitru, E. and Dexter, A. (1995). Biological effects of soil compaction , Soil and Tillage Research 35 : 53 - 68. Main physical negative effects to plants are restricted plant root growth and accessibility of nutrients due to increase in bulk density and reduced soil pore size. This may lead to an extremely dry topsoil and eventually causes soil to crack because the roots absorb water requiring for transpiration from the upper part of the soil where plants can penetrate with their restricted root depth. Soil chemical properties are influenced by change in soil physical properties. One possible effect is a decrease in oxygen diffusion that causes anaerobic condition. Together with anaerobic condition, increases in soil water saturation can increase denitrification processes in the soil. Possible consequences are an increase in N2O emission, decreases in available nitrogen in soil and reduced efficiency of nitrogen usage by crops.Ruser, R., Flessa, H., Russow, R., Schmidt, G., Buegger, F. and Munch, J. (2006). Emission of N2O, N2 and CO2 from soil fertilized with nitrate: effect of compaction, soil moisture and rewetting , Soil Biology and Biochemistry 38 : 263 - 274. This may cause in an increase of fertilizer use. Soil biodiversity is also influenced by reduced soil aeration. Severe soil compaction may cause reduced microbial biomass.Pengthamkeerati, P., Motavalli, P. and Kremer, R. (2011). Soil microbial activity and functional diversity changed by compaction, poultry litter and cropping in a claypan soil , Applied Soil Ecology 48 : 71 - 80. Soil compaction may not influence the quantity, but the distribution of macro fauna that is vital for soil structure including earthworms due to reduction in large pores.Frey, Beat and Kremer, Johann and R√ºdt, Andreas and Sciacca, Stephane and Matthies, Dietmar and L√ºscher, Peter (2009). Compaction of forest soils with heavy logging machinery affects soil bacterial community structure, European journal of soil biology. Vol. 45, 4, 312-320. All these factors affect plant growth negatively, and thus lead to reduced crop yields in most cases.McKenzie, R. H., (2010) Agricultural Soil Compaction: Causes and Management, Alberta Agriculture and Rural Development Research Division, 1,2. As soil compaction is persistent, loss of crop yield as one of the \\"soil compaction costs\\"Arvidsson, J. and H√•kansson, I. (1991). A model for estimating crop yield losses caused by soil compaction , Soil and Tillage Research 20 : 319 - 332. may lead to a concern of long term economic loss. =Off-site effects= Soil compaction and its direct effects are closely interrelated with indirect off-site effects that have a global impact, visible only in the long-term perspective. Accumulating effects may result in complex environmental impacts contributing to ongoing global environmental issues such as erosion, flooding, climate change and loss of biodiversity in soil.O‚ÄôSullivan, M.F., Simota C. (1995). Modelling the environmental impacts of soil compaction: a review. Soil& Tillage Research, 35, 69‚Äì84. doi:10.1016/0167-1987(95)00478-B Food security Soil compaction causes reductions in crop growth, yield and quality. Locally, these effects may have minor impacts on food security. If one aggregates the losses in food supply due to soil compaction, however, compaction may threaten food security. This is especially relevant for regions that are prone to droughts and floodings. Here, compacted soil may contribute to dry topsoil and increased surface runoff. In addition, climate change can worsen adverse of soil compaction. This is because climate change features events such as heat waves and storms that can increase the risk of droughts and floodings and drainage systems. Climate change and Energy use Soil is a storage of greenhouse gases (GHG). It is seen as a major terrestrial pool of carbon.Batjes, N.H., (1996). Total carbon and nitrogen in the soils of the world. European Journal of Soil Science, 47, 151‚Äì163. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2389.1996.tb01386.x Providing nutrient cycling and filtering services, soil regulates GHG fluxes. The loss of gases from soil to the atmosphere is often enhanced by the influence of soil compaction on permeability and changes in crop growth. When compacted soils are waterlogged or have an elevated water content, they tend to cause methane (CH4) losses to the atmosphere due to an increased bacteria activity. The release of the GHG nitrous oxide (N2O) originates also from microbiological processes in soil and is reinforced by the use of nitrogen fertilizer on arable land.Watson, R.T., Noble, I. R., Bolin, B., Ravindranath, N. H., Verardo D.J., Dokken, D.J. (2000). Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry - IPCC Cambridge University Press: Cambridge. http://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/sres/land_use/index.php?idp=23 (15.11.2014, chapter 1.2.3) Furthermore, compacted soil requires an extra energy input. More fuel and fertilizer are used for cultivation compared to uncompacted soil due to restrictions in crop growth resulting from a decreased efficiency in nitrogen use. The production of nitrogen fertilizer is highly energy demanding. Erosion, Flooding and Surface Water The reduced permeability of compacted soil can result in local flooding. When water cannot infiltrate, ponding and water logging pose a general risk for soil erosion by water.Soane, B.D., van Ouwerkerk, C., (1995). Implications of soil compaction in crop production for the quality of the environment. Soil & Tillage Research, 35, 5-22. doi:10.1016/0167-1987(95)00475-8 On compacted soils, wheel tracks are often the starting point for runoff and erosion. Soil erosion is likely to appear on sloping fields or especially hilly land. This might lead to a transfer of sediments [56] . Except for direct negative effects for farmers, the risk of surface runoff close to wheel tracks affects the off-farm environment indirectly, as it for example redistributes ‚Äúsediment, nutrients and pesticides within the field and beyond‚Äù. Especially when the risk of surface soil erosion is heightened, eutrophication of surface waters becomes a big problem due to an increased amount of nutrients.Vitousek, M. P.; Aber, J. D.; Howarth, R. W.; Likens, G. E.; Matson, P. A.; Schindler, D. W.; Schlesinger, W. H.; Tilman, D. G. (1997). Human Alteration Of The Global Nitrogen Cycle: Sources and Consequences. Ecological Applications, 7, 737‚Äì750. On high risk areas, such as wet soils on slopes, applied slurry can runoff easily. This results in a loss of ammonia, which is polluting surface waters, as it creates a lack of oxygen. Leading so to the death of many species, soil erosion caused by compaction is responsible for a decline in habitat quality and therefore species loss. Groundwater Another off-site effect can be seen with regard to groundwater. The infiltration rate of grassland soil without traffic is five times higher than on soil with severe traffic.Soane, B.D., van Ouwerkerk, C., (1995). Implications of soil compaction in crop production for the quality of the environment. Soil & Tillage Research,35, 5-22. doi:10.1016/0167-1987(95)00475-8 A consequence might be a reduced recharge of groundwater. Especially in dryer regions suffering from a lack of water reserves, this poses a crucial risk. In regions where ‚Äúthe subsoil provides a significant proportion of the water required by crops to meet transpiration demands‚Äù,Batey, T. (2009). Soil compaction and soil management ‚Äì a review. In: Soil Use and Management, 12, 25, 341. often being dependent on agriculture, this danger of compaction is most present. Moreover, the amount of fertilizer that is used on compacted soils is more than plants can take up. Thus, the surplus of nitrate in soil tends to leach into groundwater resulting in pollution. Due to a declining filter ability of soil, microbial decomposition of pesticides is restrained and also pesticides are more likely to reach groundwater. Identification methods Soil compaction can be identified either in the field, the laboratory or via remote sensing. In order to get reliable data and results a combination of different methods is necessary as \\"there is no single universal method available to identify compact soils\\".Batey, T.; McKenzie, D. C. (2006). Soil compaction: identification directly in the field. In: Soil Use and Management, June 2006, 22, 123-131. doi: 10.1111/j.1475-2743.2006.00017.x In the field Phenomena like waterlogging on the surface or in subsurface layers, visible reduction in porosity and changes of soil structure, soil moisture and soil colour are indicators of soil compaction in the field. A blue-grey soil colour and a smell of hydrogen sulphide can occur in the top soil due to extenuated aeration . An increase in soil strength can be measured with a penetrometer, which is basically a device for measuring the resistance of a soil. Another important indicator of soil compaction is the vegetation itself. By means of patterns of crop growth, pale leaf colours and root growth, it is possible to draw conclusions to the extent of compaction. Especially when trying to identify soil compaction in the field with the measurements mentioned above it has been considered particularly important to make a comparison between potentially compacted soil and uncompacted soil nearby. In the laboratory Soil bulk density, pore-size distribution, water permeability and the relative apparent gas diffusion coefficient give a good overview of the permeability of soils to air and water and therefore on the degree of compaction. Since the coarse pores are most important for water infiltration, gas exchange and transport, focusing on them when measuring the porosity and the diffusion coefficient is recommended.Frey, B.; Kremer, J.; R√ºdt, A.; Sciacca, S.; Matthies, D. and L√ºscher, P. (2009). Compaction of forest soils with heavy logging machinery affects soil bacterial community structure, European Journal of Soil Biology 45: 312 - 320. Data gained at a laboratory are reliable as long as a certain amount of samples has been analyzed. That is why it is necessary to gather a large number of soil samples throughout the entire sample plot that is of interest. Remote sensing Remote sensing helps to recognize alterations of soil structure, root growth, water storage capacities and biological activity. ‚ÄúDetection of these features directly on the surface of bare soil or indirectly by the vegetation lead to identification of this type of degradation.‚Äú.Gli≈Ñski, J.; Horabik, J.; Lipiec, J. (Eds.) (2011). Encyclopedia of Agrophysics. Springer Verlag, Hamburg. see page 767. This is especially helpful for large areas. As a prevention of soil compaction remote sensing can model the susceptibility of soils by considering soil texture, slope value, water regime and economic factors like the type of farming or the machinery being used. Limitations Soil compaction is often local and depends on many factors that may vary within a few squaremeters. This makes it very hard to estimate susceptibility of soils to compaction at a large scale. Since methods of remote sensing are not able to identify soil compaction directly there are limitations to identification, monitoring and quantifying, especially on a global scale. Identification methods mentioned above are insufficient for large areas since it is not possible to get a large enough sample size without harming the soil and keeping financial afford to a reasonable level. Avoidance and mitigation It takes several decades for a partial restoration of compacted soil and therefore it is extremely important to take active measures in order to regenerate soil functions.Sch√§ffer, J. (2012). Bodenstruktur, Bel√ºftung und Durchwurzelung befahrener Waldb√∂den ‚Äì Prozessstudien und Monitoring. Schriftenreihe Freiburger Forstliche Forschung, Band 53. Since soil compaction is very hard to identify and reverse, special attention has to be paid on avoidance and alleviation. =Public policy responses= The United Nations General Assembly has agreed to jointly combat land degradation. In particular, member states committed themselves to ‚Äúuse and disseminate modern technology for data collection, transmission and assessment on land degradation‚Äù.United Nations General Assembly (1994). ELABORATION OF AN INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION TO COMBAT DESERTIFICATION IN COUNTRIES EXPERIENCING SERIOUS DROUGHT AND/OR DESERTIFICATION, PARTICULARLY IN AFRICA. URL: http://www.unccd.int/Lists/SiteDocumentLibrary/conventionText/conv-eng.pdf (accessed November 2014) The European Union addresses soil compaction by means of the Seventh EU Environment Action Programme, which entered into force in 2014. It recognises that soil degradation is a serious challenge and states that by 2020 land is supposed to be managed sustainably in the entire Union.Decision No 1386/2013/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council. URL: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32013D1386 National governments have regulated agriculture practices in order to mitigate the effect of soil compaction. For instance, in Germany farmers operate under the Federal Soil Conservation Law. The law states that farmers have the obligation of precaution towards soil compaction according to acknowledged good practices.Bundes-Bodenschutzgesetz vom 17. M√§rz 1998 (BGBl. I S. 502). URL: http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bbodschg/BJNR050210998.html Good practices may vary from case to case, involving a variety of biological, chemical and technical methods. =Biological methods= The introduction of deep rooting plants are a natural way to regenerate compacted soils. Deep rooting crops provide crop induced wetting and drying cycles that crack the soil, break up impermeable layers of soil by root penetration and increase organic matter[80] . The za√Ø techniqueZai-system describes a system planting pits that are being dug into poor soil. These pits, with an average diameter of 20‚Äì40 cm and a depth of 10‚Äì20 cm, are filled with organic matter then seeded after the first rain of the season. This technique conserves soil, captures water, and gradually rehabilitates the structure and health of the underlying soil. A systematic way to regenerate degraded soil (e.g. compacted soil) in the long run is the transformation of conventional farming to agroforestry. Agroforestry systems aims at the stabilization of the annual yield as well as the healthy maintenance of the ecosystem by combining the cultivation of crop plants and trees on the same site [81] =Chemical methods= Since soil compaction can lead to a reduced crop growth and therefore to a reduced economic yield the use of fertilizer, especially nitrogen and phosphorus, is increasing. This growing demand causes several problems. Phosphor occurs in marine deposits, magmatic deposits or in Guana, which are recent depositions of seabird excreta. Phosphor extracted from marine deposits contains cadmium and uran. Both elements can have toxic effects on soil, plants and hence for humans or animals as consumer. Another opportunity to increase soil fertility besides from using mineral fertilizer is liming. Through liming the pH level and base saturation should be raised to a level more suitable for microorganisms and especially earth worms in the topsoil. Through an increased activity of soil fauna a loosening of the soil and following a higher porosity and improved water and air permeability should be reached.Sch√§ffer, J.; Gei√üen, V.; Hoch, R.; Wilpert, K. v. (2001). Waldkalkung belebt B√∂den wieder. In: AFZ/Der Wald, 56, 1106-1109. =Technical methods= Technical methods mainly aim to reduce and control the pressure applied on soil by heavy machinery. First, the idea of controlled wheel traffic is to separate the wheeled tracks and area for plant rooting.Hamza, M. and Anderson, W. (2005). Soil compaction in cropping systems: A review of the nature, causes and possible solutions , Soil and Tillage Research 82 : 121 - 145. Expected is a reduction of area compacted by tyres, reducing negative effects on crop growth. In some areas, GIS-based technology was introduced to better monitor and control the traffic paths. Low tyre pressure is another way to distribute the pressure applied on a greater surface and soften the overall pressure. For an integrated management, computer-based modelling of crop yard for vulnerability to compaction is recommended in order to avoid driving over vulnerable soil.Saffih-Hdadi, K., D√©fossez, P., Richard, G., Cui, Y.-J., Tang, A.-M. and Chaplain, V. (2009). A method for predicting soil susceptibility to the compaction of surface layers as a function of water content and bulk density , Soil and Tillage Research 105 : 96 - 103. No tillage may contribute to better soil condition as it conserves more water than traditional tillage, however as tillage is a preparation of crop yard for coming seeding or planting process, no tillage does not necessary give a positive result in all cases. Loosening of already compacted soil layers by deep ripping may be beneficial for plant growth and soil condition.

They are mainly found in the districts of Lower Assam and in Barak Valley like Hailakandi and Karimganj and some parts of Arunachal Pradesh. Barman Kachari is one of the ancient ethnic groups of North-East India. Since the 2002 Amendment act, many Barman Kacharis in Assam are referred to as 'Barman'. They are mainly found in the districts of Udalguri, Baksa, Chirang, Kokrajhar, Darrang, Kamrup, Goalpara, Nagaon, Lakhimpur, Dhemaji, Cachar and Barpeta.  History  Barmans are called Kacharis because of their Kachari origin. They are spread diffusely, in Assam and in places such as Meghalaya, Tripura and the Nagaland. Barman Kachari villages are scattered over the state of Meghalaya like Garo Hills and Khasi Hills and also in Tripura. Prior to Indian independence, several Barman Kachari settlements existed in the Mymensing and Sylhet districts of present-day Bangladesh. Partition of the country had resulted in the migration of these people to then undivided Assam. In 1708, during the reign of Tamradhaj, Kachari people adopted Hindu custom. By 1825, in the days of Govinda Chandra, the Kachari king along with some noble families had to flee Khaspur, migrating to Mymensing and Sylhat. This was due to the attack of the Ahoms and Manipuri armies as well as frequent attacks by Burma. In 1826, the Kachari king returned to his homeland after signing the Treaty of Yandaboo with the British, though the treaty stipulated that Assam be placed under British rule. Kachari King Govinda Chandra died in 1830.  Linguistics  The language that is associated with the Barman Kacharis is the Barman language, or Barman Thar (IPA: /b…î…æm…în tha…æ/), where ‚Äúthar‚Äù means language. It is a highly endangered language. It is a Tibeto-Burman language that belongs to the Bodo-Garo sub- group. Though the population of the Barman Kachari community is 24,237, according to a 2017 census, only a small part of this population speaks the language.http://www.tezu.ernet.in/wmcfel/pdf/Barman_Thar_CFEL.pdf  Demographics  Barman Kacharis of Assam are classified as Scheduled Tribe(Plains) in the valley of Barak (however, the Barman Kacharis of Brahmaputra Valley remain unscheduled till date). The Barman Kacharis number some 24,237 persons, according to a 2017 census. Out of this number, 12,555 are males and 11,503 are females. Their literacy rate is estimated at 4 percent. The level of literacy of males and females is 2.5% and 1.5%, respectively.  Culture  Barman Kacharis are patrilineal. Marriage within a clan is prohibited among the Barman Kachari tribe. Barman Kacharis have their traditional dresses and attires. They wear a kind of long gamsa with langti. Elderly Barman Kacharis wear suria, while the girls and women (maifu) wear a garment upon the chest (dafna) and wrap a gamsa around the neck (duma). A gamsa may also be tied at the waist takara. = Chiga Matthaisa = The traditional village headman at the top of the village administration is the Chiga Matthaisa or matbar. He has executive and judiciary powers. No community function in the village can be performed without his approval. = Beliefs = Though Barmans follow Hindu rites and rituals, they have their own sacred beliefs. Their rituals include Basto Puja, Lakshmi Puja and Padma Puja. The place of worship is called thaowl. Barman Kacharis perform Magh Bihu, which they call 'pusura'. The influence of Vaisnavite Chaitanya dev's religion has enabled them to adopt some Bengali culture, rites and rituals. = Festivals = Barman Kachari tribes celebrate the indigenous traditional Bihu festival of the indigenous Assamese community. Bihu is the traditional festival for the Barman Kacharis, which is celebrated in mid-April. The traditional dance of Barman is called meshak, which is performed in fairs and festivals such as Bohag Bihu, Magh Bihu and in pujas. The day of Uruka is called 'Aarbish' by Barmans. On Aarbish cattle are bathed and worshiped and offered Gourd-Brinjal, Pitha, and younger Barmans pay their respects to the elder members of the family and pray for blessings for the whole year. The youths, male and female, old man and women wear traditional dresses to sing and dance. Barman Kachari use musical instruments such as kherem, khambak, charinda and singaa. = Bamboo = Barman Kacharis use many tools made of bamboo, such as Jakoi (Jakha/Jakhei), Khaloi (Khokki/Khok), and Pal (which are used for fishing). Every Barman Kachari house has a Dheki (handmade grinder). In Barman, the Dheki is pronounced Dhengki, or container of salt (Khamba). Barman Kachari men prepare Hukas (Dhaba) which they use for smoking. = Perspective = Barman- Kacharis are a peaceful people. Living among the people of various cultures for two and a half centuries, they have maintained their ethnic identity, although cultural assimilation and acculturation and Sanskritisation has taken place. The impact of modernisation has transformed Barman society, but has not destroyed the core Barman Kachari culture. The Barman Kacharis are one of the most colorful ethnic groups of Assam, maintaining their own culture and traditions. They recognize their place among the different indigenous Assamese ethnic groups of Assam.  Economy  Agriculture is the main occupation of Barman-Kacharis. Inhabitants of foothill areas sell firewood. Many farmers work as share-croppers. They cultivate rice, wheat, pulses, and mustard, among other crops. They grow vegetables such as potato, chilli, and brinjal. Their produce also includes betel nut, mango, jackfruit and coconut. Barman-Kacharis have little formal education, limiting their ability to work in government. Most of the males are carpenters or masons. Barman-Kachari women play an important role in the economic life of the house. They raise livestock, including cattle, goats, pig, hens-ducks and pigeons. Many Barman wives work as labourers in neighbouring communities. Some women weave cloth using traditional looms. Unlike other tribes, Barman Kachari women help in the paddy fields.

The road runs concurrently with three other motorways over its entire length, starting on Rijksweg 10 (A10) around Amsterdam, then A2 from southern Amsterdam up to Utrecht, and the last part on A12 until it reaches the German border in the east. The highway is maintained by Rijkswaterstaat. Route description E 35 approaching exit 117 from the west, concurrent with A10 =Amsterdam= E 35 begins in northern Amsterdam at an interchange with A10 / E 22 and A8 / E 22, where it runs to the south-east concurrently with A10, the orbital road around Amsterdam. The highway follows the route of A10 through eastern Amsterdam where it runs southwards under the Buiten-IJ using the Zeeburgertunnel, and then using the Zeeburgerbrug over the IJmeer, Nieuwe Diep and Amsterdam-Rhine Canal. After running across these waters, the road approaches the Watergraafsmeer interchange, where A1 / E 231 starts at its western terminus. The road continues around Amsterdam and runs westwards to the Amstel interchange just before bridging over the Amstel river. At this interchange, E 35 splits off of A10, which is also signed E 19 from this point on, and continues onto the emerging A2 southwards. =Amsterdam to Utrecht= Looking north over the Oudernrijn interchange where E 35 enters from the north and continues eastwards On A2, the highway leaves Amsterdam and continues southwards to get to the Holendrecht interchange with A9.

At the second part, also a trumpet interchange, A9 splits off of the road again and continues to the west. Exit 2, an incomplete exit of A2 with a northbound exit and southbound entrance to Amsterdam-Zuidoost, can be found in the latter part of this interchange.

He is in favor of recruiting Arabic-speaking Christians in the army, police and for sherut leumi (national service): \\"Why do the Druze serve? Why do the Bedouin serve? But not the Christians?\\" Naddaf asked during a Times of Israel interview. \\"Because they are scared.\\" And that, he suggested, had to change. \\"It is time to say in a loud and clear voice: enough.\\" On 16 October 2012, a conference was held in Nazareth, designed to encourage recruitment of young Christians into the army and for national service. The conference was organized by the Ministry of Defense and the Municipality of Nazareth, at the request of the Christian Community mobilization Forum and its spiritual leader, Father Naddaf. The conference was attended by 121 young Arab Christians and some Muslims, Bedouins, and Druze, who expressed a desire to join the Israel Defense Forces IDF.Israeli Christians seek more integration into country The second conference was held and organized by Naddaf and the Christian IDF Forum in June 2013. It was reported that the rate of recruitment of young Christians in the IDF tripled between 2010-2013, although it is still a very small in absolute numbers. On August 5, 2013, the office of the Prime Minister reported that: \\"Last year there was an increase in the number of Christian IDF recruits, from 35 recruits a year ago to 100 this year, and 500 other young people from the community are doing national service.\\" On 1 May 2014, at a conference in Nazareth, attended by Deputy Defense Minister Danny Danon, it was reported that in 2013 the numbers of Arabic-speaking Christians IDF recruits continued to increase further, and was about 150 people, in addition to national service. It was reported that the number of IDF recruits in only the first quarter of 2014, up to and including March 2014 was around 100 people.

He was called: \\"Zionist agent, traitor, crazy, man running after money and recruiting young people into the army of occupation\\" on Arab sites and posted links to a Facebook page that displays a \\"black list\\" of priests, soldiers and security personnel from the Christian community who support and encourage young people to join the IDF.ŸÜÿØÿßŸÅ..

MK Haneen ZoabiIsraeli Priest Gabriel Naddaf Confident of Greater Christian Recruitment Into IDF. The Algemeiner (Balad) and MK Ahmed Tibi (United Arab List) have written open letters and talked and rallied against Naddaf. Representatives from the Palestinian Authority paid a visit to the Greek Orthodox Patriarch in June 2013, following the second conference of recruits Christians IDF and national service and ordered him to fire Naddaf immediately, providing letters from a number of Arab MKs, including Haneen Zoabi, Muhammad Barakeh, and Basel Ghattas. According to MK Ghattas: \\"Patriarch should explain Naddaf that it's not his job. Please take off his cape and join the Likud or Yisrael Beiteinu. He wants to bring the Christian community to the status of the Druze community, and take it out of its national affiliation\\". In addition patriarch was sent letters on the matter from leaders of the Arab sector councils. In mid-June 2013, the Patriarch Theophilus III published in the Israeli Arab media a severe condemnation of activities organized by Naddaf. A week later, he summoned him to have a personal conversation. It has been speculated that its original purpose was probably to fire him from his position. The meeting itself was held on June 25, 2013, and lasted for hours, but the counter- pressure exerted by the heads of the Israeli establishment, including Justice Minister Tzipi Livni, and Interior Minister Gideon Sa'ar, apparently persuaded the Patriarch not to fire Naddaf during that meeting . On 6 May 2014, a spokesman for the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate, Father Issa Mesleh, published a statement that: \\"the Patriarch Theophilus III decided to revoke all the powers of the Father Naddaf at his church and oust him from his position as head of the Orthodox Church in Yafia\\"; within two weeks the spokesman turned out to be a speaker from the Palestinian Authority who published things on his own and that the Patriarchate did not reject the authority of Father Naddaf. In May 2016, Israeli television station Channel 2 reported accusations that Naddaf had sought sexual favours from young people he had come into contact with through his IDF recruitment work, and that he had helped to arrange Israeli entry visas for Palestinians for illicit business purposes: Naddaf denied the claims. Verbal and physical assault At the beginning of December 2013, Naddaf filed a complaint, along with the movement Im Tirtzu with the Knesset Ethics Committee against MK Basel Ghattas (Balad), claiming that the MK: \\"exploits his immunity to incite against me and threaten me very intensely to make it easier for someone lacking all come and physically hurt me\\". Naddaf noted that in parallel, he filed another complaint on the same subject at the Nazareth police against MK Ghattas.◊™◊ú◊ï◊†◊î: \\"◊ó◊ë◊® ◊î◊õ◊†◊°◊™ ◊®◊ï◊ì◊£ ◊ê◊ï◊™◊ô ◊ï◊û◊ê◊ô◊ô◊ù ◊¢◊ú◊ô◊ô\\".

Incitement passed yesterday from verbal threats to physical violence, as their purpose is to intimidate me and my family. My wife is afraid to go out, and my second 15-year-old son refuses to go out, fearful that radical activists will also hurt him.\\" Support  Despite all the threats, boycotts, and defamation, the Israeli establishment has woken up and begun to stand beside Naddaf. In November 2012, a month after the first conference of the Christian IDF Forum, the director of the National Civic Service, Sar-Shalom Gerbi, came to Nazareth: \\"to express his support to Naddaf for his steadfastness and unwavering support for encouraging young Christians to integrate into the community in Israel\\". Gerbi said at that meeting, that: \\"this is a courageous act, a man of letters, undeterred by threats and pressures and insists on serving the country... I hope that law enforcement authorities will act decisively to stop the campaign of incitement and de- legitimization of Naddaf and against the young men and women doing national service\\". About two weeks later, Gerbi met with the Greek Orthodox Patriarch Theophilus III, who promised him that Naddaf will not be boycotted by the Church.◊î◊§◊ò◊®◊ô◊ê◊®◊ö ◊î◊ô◊ï◊ï◊†◊ô ◊ú◊û◊†◊õ\\"◊ú ◊î◊©◊ô◊®◊ï◊™ ◊î◊ú◊ê◊ï◊û◊ô: ◊ú◊ê ◊î◊ó◊®◊û◊™◊ô ◊ê◊™ ◊î◊õ◊ï◊û◊® ◊©◊™◊û◊ö ◊ë◊©◊ô◊®◊ï◊™ On February 2013, MK Ayelet Shaked met with Naddaf; in June 2013, Justice Minister Tzipi Livni and Interior Minister Gideon Sa'ar met with him as did Deputy Defense Minister Danny Danon on July 2.◊û◊©◊®◊ì ◊î◊ë◊ô◊ò◊ó◊ï◊ü ◊†◊í◊ì ◊î◊û◊°◊ô◊™◊ô◊ù ◊†◊í◊ì ◊©◊ô◊®◊ï◊™ ◊ë◊¶◊î\\"◊ú On August 5, 2013, Naddaf met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who directed the establishment of a joint forum with participation of the government and the Christian community which will promote the recruitment of members of the community to the IDF and national service, and their integration into national life. This forum should work to integrate the Christian community according to the Law of Equal Burden and oversee administrative and legal aspects necessary for this purpose, such as protecting the supporters of recruitment and recruits from violence and threats and increased enforcement of the law against rioters and those inciting violence. He added that: \\"we should allow for the Christian community to join the IDF. You are loyal citizens who want to defend the country and I salute you and support you. We will not tolerate threats to you and we will enforce the law firm hand against persecute you. I will not accept attempts to undermine the country from within.

However, as his parents were first cousins Donald Balloch Mackay was therefore barred by canon law from succeeding as chief to his father's estates. Historian Angus Mackay does designate Donald Balloch as 13th of Strathnaver,Mackay, Angus (1906). p. 97. (page showing family tree). but shows that the true successor of Iye Du Mackay was Huistean Du Mackay, 13th of Strathnaver who was the eldest son from Iye Du's second marriage to Christian, daughter of John Sinclair of Duns, Caithness. Donald Balloch disputed the chiefship with his younger half-brother Huistean Mackay, 13th of Strathnaver,Mackay, Angus (1906). p. 108. and later he was banished from Strathnaver and Sutherland for the killing of one James Mackroy, thus retiring himself to the Earl of Caithness, chief of the Clan Sinclair who was then at feud with the Gordon Earl of Sutherland.Gordon, Sir Robert (1813). pp. 202-203. In 1590 Donald Balloch Mackay commanded a company of archers in support of the Earl of Caithness and against the Earl of Sutherland at the Battle of Clynetradwell. Historian Angus Mackay states that Donald Balloch played the part of a skilful and gallant leader, saving the situation for the Earl of Caithness.Mackay, Angus (1906). pp. 286 - 287. Even the Gordon of Sutherland account states that Donald Balloch Mackay played the part of a good commander. The Earl of Caithness was however defeated and Donald Balloch Mackay was imprisoned in Dunrobin Castle by the Earl of Sutherland.Gordon, Sir Robert (1813). p. 204. He was later released with the consent of his half brother, Huistean Mackay, 13th of Strathnaver and from then on Donald Balloch Mackay supported the Earl of Sutherland like Huistean did.

The earliest recipe was collected in 1841; the last in 1897. The book was edited by the artist Catherine Frances Frere, who had seen two other cookery books through to publication, at the request of Clark's husband. The book is considered a valuable compilation of Victorian era recipes. Lady Clark obtained the recipes by asking hostesses or cooks, and then testing each one at Tillypronie. She documented each recipe's source with the name of her source, and often also the date. There is comprehensive coverage of plain British cooking, especially of meat and game, but the book has sections on all aspects of contemporary cooking including bread, cakes, eggs, cooking for invalids, jams, pies, sauces, sweets (puddings) and vegetables. She had lived in Italy and France, and the cuisines of these countries are represented by many dishes, as is Anglo-Indian cooking with a section called \\"Curries\\". The book was enjoyed by Virginia Woolf and acted as a source of inspiration to the cookery writer Elizabeth David. Context Tillypronie is a Victorian era house between Ballater and Strathdon in Scotland, just east of the Cairngorms National Park, overlooking the valley of the River Dee; the gardens are open to the public. Lady Clark collected thousands of recipes for her own use between 1841 and 1897; among her house-guests in the 1870s was Henry James, who commented in a letter \\"I bless the old house on the mountain and its genial and bountiful tenants\\". Lady Clark was married to the diplomat Sir John Forbes Clark, second baronet.‚ÄòCLARK, Sir John Forbes‚Äô, Who Was Who, A & C Black, 1920‚Äì2015; online edition, Oxford University Press, 2014. Retrieved 19 December 2014 Sir John worked in Paris (seeing the 1848 revolution there), moving to Brussels in 1852 and Turin from 1852 to 1855; he married Charlotte in 1851. Living in Europe gave Lady Clark a detailed insight into Italian and French cooking ‚Äì there are five recipes for Tartare sauce; and she was well informed about Anglo-Indian cookery, with dishes such as \\"Rabbit Pish-pash\\". Her approach was to ask her hostess or the cook how any interesting or unusual dish was made, and then to try out the recipe back at Tillypronie to ensure that it worked. After Lady Clark's death in 1897, her widower invited Catherine Frances Frere (1848‚Äì1921), daughter of Sir Henry Bartle Frere, to assemble them into a book, asking: Frere was born in Malcolm Peth, Bombay on 25 September 1848. In later life she lived in Westbourne Terrace, London. The Cookery Book was not Frere's first publication; at the age of 20 she had illustrated her sister Mary's book, Old Deccan Days, Or, Hindoo Fairy Tales Current in Southern India, a compilation of folk tales; their father was at the time Governor of Bombay. The book was popular, going into four editions between first publication in 1868 and 1889. In the Preface to the Cookery Book she denies \\"the special knowledge of cookery with which Sir John so kindly credits me\\", but admits she has always been interested in the \\"study\\", and that she had seen \\"two other cookery books through the press for my friend the late Miss Hilda Duckett\\": these were Hilda's Where is it? of Recipes (1899) and Hilda's Diary of a Cape Housekeeper (1902), both published by Chapman and Hall; but Frere's name had not appeared on their title pages.Frere, 1909. pp. viii‚Äìix Book =Structure= The first edition is of xviii + 584 pages. It is divided into sections as follows, starting immediately after the Table of Contents with no preamble : There are no illustrations. There is an Appendix, under Frere's name, with sections summarized from the RSPCA on how \\"To spare animals unnecessary pain\\" and \\"Bad meat\\" (which gives advice on the best ways to kill rabbits and birds). The index runs to 31 pages in two columns of small type. =Approach= Timbale a la Reginald\\" (on page 273), attributed to a Mrs. Stubbington, 1888 Each recipe is presented quite plainly, with a title which is numbered if there is more than one recipe for a given dish. There is no list of ingredients: each recipe begins at once, as for instance \\"Pound the slightly scalded fish, pound also 1/2 lb. of suet shred very fine, and 2 ozs. of stale bread-crumbs, and 1 egg well beaten.\\"Frere, 1909. p. 127 Many recipes have a named source, sometimes with a date, as in \\"Rhubarb Jam. (Mrs. Davidson, Coldstone Manse. 1886.)\\"Frere, 1909. p. 176 Some of Lady Clark's recipes are very brief, forming little more than notes to herself, as in her It can be seen that instructions, ingredients and comments are intermixed. The recipes in each section are listed alphabetically. Some entries are cross- references, for example \\"'Zucchetti √† la Milanaise' and '√† la Piedmontaise.'

Reception =Contemporary= Lord Houghton contributed one for a mutton and oyster pudding. The feminist author Virginia Woolf reviewed the book in the Times Literary Supplement in 1909, writing that \\"Cookery books are delightful to read... A charming directness stamps them, with their imperative 'Take an uncooked fowl and split its skin from end to end' and their massive commonsense which stares frivolity out of countenance\\". The Spectator review in 1909 speculates that Lady Clark inherited the \\"practical study of cookery\\" from her father, \\"Mr. Justice Coltman\\" who though \\"abstemious himself\\" was \\"careful to provide a well-furnished table for his guests\\". The review remarks on =Modern= The cookery writer Elizabeth David describes one of Lady Clark's recipes in her 1970 book Spices, Salt and Aromatics in the English Kitchen as follows: Sue Dyson and Roger McShane, reviewing the book on foodtourist.com, call it \\"a valuable collection of British recipes\\" and Dyson and McShane state (after discussing the contents) that \\"The recipes are not difficult as Lady Clark preferred simplicity and was annoyed with contrivance.\\" They write that \\"The recipes on meat and poultry are very strong and range over the normal meats such as beef and pork and then on to many game dishes as would be expected of someone living in the highlands of Scotland.\\" They conclude with the recommendation \\"An excellent addition to your food library!\\" Vanessa Kimbell of the Sourdough School writes that Frere carefully catalogued all the recipes, removing any that she could trace to a published source, and comments that they \\"are all delightfully straight forward\\". She explains: Kimbell concludes that \\"This extraordinary book is a delight to cook from. [Frere's] diligence in putting together this vast collection of recipes resulted in one of the most charming, straightforward and thorough recipe books of the late nineteenth century with recipes that are still remarkably very useable today.\\" In her introduction to the 1994 edition, Geraldene Holt writes that while most cooks collect recipes, Holt observes of the book that In her book A Caledonian Feast, Annette Hope calls Lady Clark \\"admirable\\" and writes that her Hope adds that Lady Clark's Notes References Bibliography * Frere, Catherine Frances (editor).

His wife, Tanomogi Koma, was a noted violinist and professor of music at the Tokyo Academy of Music. Early life Tanomogi was born in what is now part of Fukuyama, Hiroshima, and his surname at birth was Inoue. In 1903, he was adopted into the Tanomogi family by marriage. After graduating from the First Higher School in Tokyo, he travelled to the United States for studies, and after his return to Japan found employment with the H≈çchi Shimbun newspaper in 1896. In 1899 he founded his own newspaper, the Ch≈çn≈ç Shimbun, but returned to the H≈çchi Shimbun in 1901 and was instrumental in the expansion of that firm in a major national newspaper with increased business coverage, hiring Japan‚Äôs first woman journalist, page 220 and the issuing of an evening edition in 1906. Also in 1906 he travelled to the United States and Europe on an inspection tour of the overseas newspaper business and on his return to Japan almost three years later in 1908, he founded a press club the Japan Press Agency. He also established a company to import raw film for photo journalism, and footage of the assassination of It≈ç Hirobumi in 1910 created a sensation. Tanomogi was elected as an assemblyman from Asakusa Ward in Tokyo in 1911. In the 1915 General Election, Tanomogi was elected to the House of Representatives of Japan under the Rikken D≈çshikai political party. He was elected a total of nine times, changing his party affiliation to the Kenseikai (where he was Chairman of the Policy Affairs Research Council), and the Rikken Minseit≈ç (where he was Secretary-General and Director of General Affairs). He became Undersecretary of Communications under the Kat≈ç administration and the first Wakatsuki administration, and was subsequently Communications Minister in the Hirota administration from March 1936 to February 1937. During his tenure as Communications Minister, Tanomogi promulgated an aggressive five-year shipbuilding plan to expand Japan‚Äôs merchant fleet by six million tons with government subsidies. He also promoted the complete nationalization of Japan‚Äôs electric power industry, with the state assuming complete managerial control without actually seizing ownership. The plan was based on fascist economic theories and had the benefit to the government of enabling state control without the expense of compensating owners. Although the plan had the support of the Imperial Japanese Army, who say it as a stepping stone to further state control of the economy, strong opposition by the business community delayed its implementation until after Tanomogi left office in 1938. page 45-46 Tanomogi was also instrumental in creating laws under which only the D≈çmei Tsushin was allowed to receive and send overseas telegraph messages, thus giving D≈çmei a monopoly from which every Japanese newspaper was forced to obtain its news. page 151 In 1938, Tanomogi returned to the H≈çchi Shimbun as its president. In 1939, he was elected Mayor of Tokyo. He died while in office and his grave is at Yanaka Cemetery in Tokyo.

Stefan and Klaus return to the bar but Elena is not able to inject Stefan who tells her to go back home and forget about him. Inside the bar, Damon and Klaus get into a fight but Gloria stops Klaus before he kills Damon. She also tells Klaus that to find answers to his questions about the hybrids, they have to contact the Original Witch and Rebekah is the only one who can help them with that. Back in Mystic Falls, Bill (Jack Coleman) still keeps Caroline (Candice Accola) tied up and tortures her claiming that he does it to \\"fix\\" her. Despite Caroline trying to explain that she is not hurting anyone and that she learned how to control her urges, Bill keeps saying that she needs to be \\"fixed\\". On his way out the basement, Liz (Marguerite MacIntyre) waits for him while pointing a gun on him. With Bill unable to do anything, Tyler (Michael Trevino) unties Caroline and along with Liz, they take her back home. In another flashback to the 1920s, it is revealed that Klaus compelled Stefan to forget about him and Rebekah, after an attack from someone who hunts Klaus and Rebekah down for years. Klaus tells Rebekah that they found them and they have to run but when Rebekah refuses to go with him but wants to stay with Stefan, he stabs her with the dagger and puts her in the coffin. When he grabs her, Rebekah‚Äôs necklace falls without her noticing it. Stefan sees the necklace and picks it up while it is revealed that is the same necklace he gave to Elena when they first met. When Stefan got the necklace, Katherine was also at the bar and saw him picking it up. Back in present, Klaus removes the dagger from Rebekah‚Äôs heart so she will wake up. When she does, Klaus also compels Stefan to remember him and Rebekah from the ‚Äò20s and he reunites with her. Klaus tells her that they need to contact the Original Witch and Rebekah starts searching for her necklace, saying that it is the thing that they need to make the contact possible. The episode ends with Elena and Damon getting back home and Damon talks with Katherine again. He asks where she is but she refuses to tell him. When they hang up, it is revealed that Katherine is in Chicago.

Carrie Raisler from The A.V. Club gave the episode and A- rating saying that it was another great episode that \\"signals just how much season three is shaping up to be potentially something really special. Not only are the performances strong, the writing excellent, and the overall arc of the season intriguing, but all of the plots are so much more emotionally complicated than they have been in the past.\\" Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic rated the episode with 4/5 saying that the episode had much information around Klaus. \\"...the flashbacks were as fun and engrossing as ever and they culminated in a fascinating new trio [Klaus, Stefan and Rebekah].\\" Diana Steenbergen from IGN rated the episode with 8/10 saying that the episode gave plenty of information and some surprising twists. \\"[The episode] was extremely flashback heavy and the scenes in the 1920s contained an unexpected amount of information [...] This particular episode, with its potentially game-changing revelations, benefited by focusing in on half the usual number of characters.\\" Robin Franson Pruter of Forced Viewing rated the episode with 3/4 saying that the episode shows off both the strengths and the limitations of the show but the strengths outweigh the limitations. \\"Overall, I like the background the series is laying out for Klaus, how this most powerful being is constantly thwarted by his own actions, which are rooted in deep psychological needs. [...] The flaws in the episode prevent me from giving it four stars, but I appreciate the track it lays for the upcoming season and look forward to going along for the ride.\\" Caroline Preece from Den of Geek gave a good review to the episode saying that the episode had its great moments. \\"It's another strong instalment, but things need to move quickly if it can hold the attention of those hoping for more of the promised relationship drama. Rebecca looks like a solid addition to the Stefan saga, but now they need to think of something for Elena and Damon to do.\\" References External links * Category:2011 American television episodes Category:The Vampire Diaries (season 3) episodes ","title":"The End of the Affair (The Vampire Diaries)"},{"id":"44627382","text":"McCracken King Poston Jr. (also known as McCracken Poston or \\"Ken\\" Poston; born October 24, 1959), is an American criminal defense attorney, former politician and part-time juvenile court judge. He gained national attention for several notable cases which were featured on TV series specials such as CNN Presents, Dateline NBC, A&E;'s American Justice and Forensic Files. Poston is a practicing defense attorney in Georgia and Tennessee. Poston was elected and served as a state representative in the Georgia House of Representatives from 1989 to 1997. Early life and education McCracken Poston was born and raised in Northwest Georgia. After attending public schools in Catoosa County, Poston attended the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga for his undergraduate studies, and then he went on to receive his J.D. degree from the University of Georgia Law School where he was president of his class. Career Poston is a former Democratic state representative. Previously, Poston was an assistant district attorney for Lookout Mountain Judicial Circuit and the former president of Catoosa Country Chamber of Commerce. He was also an adjunct professor of American government at University of Tennessee-Chattanooga. Poston is an active juvenile court judge and practices criminal law. =Political career= In 1988, Poston was elected to the Georgia House of Representatives from a district in Catoosa County where remained for a tenure of eight years. During his term, Poston was a member of the Defense and Veterans Affairs, Education, and Judiciary committees. After four terms, Poston left the state legislature and ran for the United States Congress as the Democratic nominee in the 9th district. He was defeated in the general election by incumbent Nathan Deal, a former Democrat who had turned Republican. To date, Poston is the last Democrat to even win 30 percent of the vote in this district. =Legal career= In 1984 he interned in the office of Congressman George Darden.LinkedIn Profile From 1985 to 1986 and from 1988 to 1989 he was in private practice. From 1986 to 1988 he was an assistant district attorney in the Lookout Mountain Judicial Circuit District Attorney's Office. Poston started a solo law firm in 1989 after briefly working for the Offices of Clifton Patty, and he has served as a juvenile court judge since 1997. Notable cases Throughout his career, Poston has had several high-profile cases including the following: =Alvin Ridley= Poston represented Alvin \\"The Zenith Man\\" Ridley in an eight-day trial in January 1999. Ridley's wife, Virginia, had been found dead in their home after not being seen in public for nearly three decades. Virginia Gail Ridley () (April 18, 1948 ‚Äì October 4, 1997) was a woman who lived with her husband on the outskirts of Ringgold, Georgia, in a dilapidated, cockroach-infested house‚Äîthough, according to Ridley's lawyer, they made an effort to keep the house clean. Virginia's family claimed Alvin prevented all attempts by them to contact her. Eight months after her death, Ridley was arrested and later charged with murder, but claimed his epileptic wife died in her sleep. Ridley claimed the reason why no one in Ringgold knew of her condition was because of her family's opposition to their marriage, as well as Virginia's fear she would have a seizure in public, and therefore, she decided to live as a recluse. Ridley maintained he and Virginia were happy and he never harmed her. He shared with Poston Virginia's journal, an evidentiary treasure trove consisting of 10,000 pages written over three decades. During the trial, Poston presented the courtroom with hundreds of notes and scraps of paper that Virginia journaled on about their reclusive life together. After the testimony of defense witness Dr. Braxton Wannamaker, an expert on seizure disorders, and the lack of a motive from the prosecution, the jury acquitted Ridley of all charges. The case was featured on the A&E; network series American Justice episode \\"Death in a Small Town\\",IMDB: \\"American Justice\\" Death in a Small Town (2001) as well as episodes of Extra and Forensic Files. The radio storytelling program Snap Judgment had Poston explaining how he defended Ridley and discovered Virginia's documents in the episode \\"Dirty Work\\" on November 27, 2015.Dirty Work podcast at snapjudgment.org. Her writing reflected a happy marriage, with details of meals and TV programs the couple enjoyed. She wrote prayers and observations from her Bible study, along with a never-submitted script for Unsolved Mysteries. Attorney Poston theorized that Virginia‚Äîwho suffered from agoraphobia and epilepsy‚Äîdied of an epileptic seizure as had Florence Griffith-Joyner, whose autopsy he submitted as evidence. He argued that her hypergraphia could be part of her epileptic condition. The prosecution maintained that Ridley suffocated her, citing his strange, seemingly unemotional behavior upon reporting Virginia's death and speaking about her to others. =Byron \\"Low Tax\\" Looper= Poston represented Byron \\"Low Tax\\" Looper in the Cumberland County case of the murder of Tennessee State Senator Tommy Burks in 1998. Looper was the local tax assessor in neighboring Putnam County who had won his position after changing his middle name from \\"Anthony\\" to \\"Low Tax.\\" Looper was challenging the incumbent Senator Burks (D-Monterey), until Burks was found shot to death on his farm just days before the election. A write-in campaign elected the Senator's wife, Charlotte Burks to the seat. Looper was attested to be an atrociously obnoxious and difficult client by the six previous attorneys who had attempted to represent him. When the judge lost patience from the slew of delays, Looper was finally represented through trial by Poston and Ron Cordova of California. Looper was convicted of the murder of Senator Burks in 2000, and received a life without parole sentence. Looper was found dead in his prison cell in 2013, a death that Poston has cited as \\"suspicious.\\" The case was featured on episodes of American Justice ('Eliminating the Competition') and Primetime Thursday ('The Last Campaign'). =The Tri-State Crematory Cases= In 2002, Poston represented Ray Brent Marsh of the Tri-State Crematory who had been charged with two counts theft by deception for each body that was identified on his property in Noble, Georgia. 334 bodies and remains of the deceased had been discovered at the Tri-State Crematory, a family-owned business that Marsh had been managing after his father's health failed. Marsh was cited with 787 felony counts, amounting to a possible sentence of thousands of years in prison. Poston put forth an aggressive defense for Marsh, threatening to require Walker County to conduct and pay for a costly trial that could potentially take months, and was partially successful in a change of venue effort in securing that the jury would be acquired from out of the area, which would have added great additional cost to Walker County. Poston also attacked the theories of prosecution that the state was utilizing, questioning how a human body could be the subject of a \\"fiduciary\\" relationship, and how a dead human body could be given the requisite monetary value to ascertain whether each body represented a misdemeanor or felony. The Georgia Supreme Court agreed with Poston of the need to clarify these issues and certified the questions for pre-trial appeal. After the high court ruling, Poston was able to arrange for Marsh to accept a plea deal of a 12-year sentence in prison, with eligibility for parole. The case appeared on an episode of Crossfire ('Should government increase regulations on funeral'). =\\"Operation Meth Merchant\\"= Poston represented a number of South Asian-born defendants and revealed many problems inherent in \\"Operation Meth Merchant\\" ‚Äì a joint Federal and State task force targeting South Asian owned and operated convenience stores in Northwest Georgia. An operative would attempt to purchase pseudoephedrine from the stores while uttering something that the government stated informed the clerks that the operative intended to manufacture methamphetamine with the pseudoephedrine. Poston attacked the scheme, pointing out that many of the clerks do not understand English sufficiently to ascertain what the operative was talking about. Furthermore, Poston began to attack the method of the task force in identifying the clerks, which was a scanning of license plates and acquisition of registration and drivers licenses of the owners of the cars, followed by presenting the license photos to the operative to identify the suspects. Poston filed a number of \\"Alibi\\" notices in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia in his cases. Poston was able to prove the operation's methods were so faulty that there were three of his clients misidentified by the government operative. Poston proved that one of his clients was picking up her child from daycare several miles away in another state when the government claimed she was selling the operative pseudoephedrine. On another client Poston proved that the man was in India when the government said he was in Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia. Finally, for another young client arrested upon the return from his honeymoon Poston was able to prove he was working in a Subway sandwich shop on Long Island, New York when the government said he was in North Georgia, \\"knowingly\\" selling pseudoephedrine for use in the manufacture of methamphetamine. The case was detailed and featured on an episode of Asia Today ('Meth Persecutions of Indians in Georgia'). =Murray County, Georgia Judicial Corruption \\"The Judge Cochran case\\"= In July 2012, Poston undertook to assist a woman from Murray County, Georgia, in filing a complaint against Murray County Chief Magistrate Judge Bryant Cochran. The woman charged that when she was in the Judge's office in April, 2012, the elected Chief Magistrate solicited a sexual relationship from her that he told her would result a \\"good outcome\\" in a criminal case the woman was seeking to initiate against three assailants that had attacked her on Easter Sunday, 2012. The woman did not comply with the requests for the sexual relationship, but had a brief texting relationship with the judge, and sent him one photo of herself in her underwear, at the judge's request. The Georgia Judicial Qualifications Commission (JQC) started to investigate the judge, after meeting the woman in Poston's office, and in the course of the investigation also found a stack of pre-signed search warrant blanks in the Magistrate Court Office. These were pre-signed warrants that the judge had left in the court's office for law enforcement to pick up and use if he was not in. This not only violated the law, but destroyed the notion of a \\"neutral and detached magistrate\\" - making the requisite finding of probable cause to issue such warrants a rubber stamp of law enforcement. While Judge Cochran won the 2012 reelection handily during the investigation, the discovery of the pre-signed warrants started speculation that the Chief Magistrate would step down. Before this happened, however, Poston's client was stopped in her car at night near her home by a Murray County deputy, who was almost immediately joined by his Sergeant, the judge's cousin. When the first officer's drug dog failed to signal the presence of any illegal drugs, the officers turned off their lapel microphones and called the embattled Chief Magistrate Judge. Just after the call, one of the officers walked directly to a certain spot and reached under the car. A magnetized tin-box was found under the woman's car containing methamphetamine. In her first court appearance, Poston represented the woman and challenged the arrest in open court, and convinced the District Attorney's office to invite the Georgia Bureau of Investigation and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to look into Poston's allegations that the drugs had been planted at the behest of Chief Magistrate Judge Cochran. Cochran resigned from office the following day, insisting that his resignation was \\"only\\" due to the pre-signed warrants issue. Poston and his client worked closely with the GBI and FBI and quickly provided them a suspect who later admitted planting the methamphetamine on his client's car. He was a tenant and handyman of Judge Cochran. Poston was joined in the effort by Chattanooga attorney Stuart James, who filed a civil suit on behalf of their client. After three years, and with an intervening second arrest of his client, all known conspirators were brought to justice in federal criminal proceedings. The civilian who planted the drugs and the two officers first on the scene who found the drugs pleaded guilty in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia for their roles in the set-up of Poston's client. Poston had publicly stated that his client was a methamphetamine addict, which made her the more vulnerable to the set-up, and that the second arrest - although ostensibly legitimate - was a desperate attempt to again discredit his client, this time just weeks before Cochran's trial. The subsequent arrest ultimately made his client a better witness for the government, having made her realize the issues that she had that made her vulnerable to the Judge. Former Chief Magistrate Bryant Cochran was tried in the same court in December, 2014 and found guilty of all charges. He was sentenced in 2015 to a five-year sentence.

T.L.Saaty. McGraw-Hill 1970 or Lone Chooser) is a protocol for proportional division of a cake. Its main advantage is that it can work in an online fashion, without knowing the number of partners in advance. When a new partner joins the party, the existing division is adjusted to give a fair share to the newcomer, with minimal effect on existing partners. Its main disadvantage is that, instead of giving each partner a single connected piece, it gives each partner a large number of \\"crumbs\\".  Protocol  We describe the protocol inductively for an increasing number of partners. When partner #1 enters the party, he just takes the entire cake. His value is thus 1. When partner #2 comes, partner #1 cuts the cake to two pieces that are equal in his eyes. The new partner chooses the piece that is better in his eyes. The value of each partner is thus at least 1/2 (just like in the divide and choose protocol). When partner #3 joins, both partners #1 and #2 cut their share to 3 pieces that are equal in their eyes. The new partner chooses one piece from each partner. The value of each of partners #1 and #2 is at least 2/3 of their previous value, which was 1/2. Hence their new value is at least 1/3. The value of partner #3 is at least 1/3 from the piece of #1 and 1/3 from the piece of 2, which gives him at least 1/3 of the total cake. In general, when partner #i enters the party, the previous i-1 partners divide their share to i equal pieces and the new partner picks a piece from each pile. Again it is possible to prove that the value of each partner is at least 1/n of the total, so the division is proportional.  Number of cuts  Straightforward use of the algorithm would generate n! pieces, but in fact only about n^3/3 are needed as each partner only really needs to do n-1 cuts when the nth partner comes along.  Applications  Fink's protocol is used in a subroutine in other cake-cutting protocols: * Woodall's protocol for super-proportional division for n players. * Austin moving-knife procedure, giving each partner a piece that he values as exactly 1/n of the total.

The church was declared a National Historical Landmark by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines in 2008. History The church of Ivana was first established by the Dominicans as a chapel in 1787. Originally, there were three mission chapels in Said, Kadpidan and Radiwan in Ivana. The present stone church and convent was built in Radiwan under the direction of Father Francisco de Paula Esteban, OP, in 1795, while the bell tower was constructed during the term of Father Fausto de Cuevas, OP from 1814 to 1817. The church was intended to serve the people of Ivana, Sabtang and Uyugan. The residents of Sabtang had been forcibly resettled in Ivana, but were later allowed to return to their island, reducing the size of the congregation. In 1844, space in the church's nave that was no longer needed was closed off. The fa√ßade was renovated during the term of Father Fabian Martin, OP, from 1866 to 1869. The church was partially destroyed due to an earthquake in 2000 and was later renovated during the term of Father Gumersindo Hernandez, OP, in 2001. Filipino revolutionaries waved the Katipunan flag in the church's bell tower on September 18, 1898. Architectural features The church's fa√ßade was built alongside the shortening of its nave in 1854. When the population decreased in the 1840s due to the return of the Isabtang to Sabtang, the rear portion of the church was closed. Today, ruins of the abandoned portion of the church can still be seen. It also has a crenellated bell tower supported by unusual buttresses. Its convent, which is part of the church complex, has an unusual circular masonry work near the stairway.

History and variants  The first buses of 700 series were produced during the 1970s. These were only functional samples and prototypes, which were designed for different tests (including comparisons with then produced Karosa ≈† series). The very first bus from 700 series became functional sample of intercity bus Karosa C 733 in 1973. Serial production of 700 series begin in 1981. The first (and main) representative was Karosa C 734 (intercity bus). This was followed by Karosa B 731 (city bus with automatic transmission), B 732 (suburban bus with manual gearbox), intercity bus C 735 and long distance touring types LC 735 and LC 736. Also manufactured were articulated vehicles of the type C 744 (intercity) and B 741 (city). In the early 90s, a coach with a raised floor was developed that was marked as Karosa LC 737 (as well as HD 11) and LC 757 (HD 12). In 1996 that was replaced with an upgraded 900 series and production of buses 700 series was finally completed a year later. A total of 37,166 of buses 700 and 800 was made. The buses were sold in addition to Czechoslovakia and other markets. Probably most of them were exported to the Russia, where was even in 2001 built a statue to Karosa C 734. To Russia were exported and buses known as 800 series, which were based on a 700 series.  Designation  For new buses of Karosa 700 series, before number were one or two letters (as recommended by CMEA). * Letter: car type - B (urban and suburban bus English 'b' us), C (and intercity bus line in English 'c' oach), LC (remote and coach, English 'l' ong distance 'c' oach) * First figure: 7 - stands in the segment numbering (nomenclature engineering products) bus Karosa, however, there has been a shift in meaning and thus marked the first digit '7' 0s, when the bus was designed and constructed * Second figure: the length of the bus - 3 = 11 m, 4 = 17 m, 12 m = 5 * Third digit: ** Vehicles B \\"1\\" model B 731 originally marked the category B1 bus, later in the development of type B 732 marked the third digit type of gearbox (1 = automatic 2 = mechanical) ** C vehicles: 3 = regional bus with an automatic transmission, 4 = intercity manual transmission, 5 = intercity with manual transmission and a larger luggage compartment (for longer lines or tours) ** LC vehicles: numbers 5, 6 or 7 indicate the level of comfort (the higher the number, the more luxurious bus) ** Doors: 1 door, 2 door or 3 doors (normal) or 2 doors, 3 doors or 4 doors (articulated)  Construction  Like their predecessors, ≈† series, 700 series buses were built using prefabricated buildings. This technology consists in the production of six separate panels (frame, chassis, hips, body, roof, front and rear panel) to separate welding lines, which were then surface treated and assembled together. A significant change was the production of frames, hips and roof from industrially produced hollow. On the previous row with these parts were molded parts. This solution nowadays makes easier repairs after accidents. Compared to Karosa ≈† series, which had engine between the wheels, 700 series had engine and transmission stored behind the rear axle. 700 series was developed by engineers Ivan Mervart, Josef Nalezenec and Ladislav Klime≈° and designed by Jan Tatou≈°ek and Zdenƒõk Ros√°k.  Special buses  Some buses of 700 series were adapted directly from the factory for special purposes. It is worth mentioning buses for transporting prisoners, measuring vehicle for 'Electric companies' or bus for the town library in Prague. For the production of these buses was responsible for first development workshop, later, since 1991, custom workshop. Some buses of 700 series have been produced for the customer special design.

He serves as a deputy to the LXIII Legislature of the Mexican Congress, representing Veracruz's 15th electoral district, which includes the city of Orizaba. He also served as a deputy in the LXI Legislature. He is the incumbent chairman of the Tiburones Rojos de Veracruz. Political and business career Kuri Grajales was born on 24 February 1962 in Orizaba and pursued an undergraduate degree in business administration, which he abandoned in 1981. He started his political career in the 1990s in the PRI, becoming president of a municipal committee. He also was involved in various transportation and other business chambers. From 1998 to 2000, Kuri served on the LVIII Legislature of the Congress of Veracruz, presiding over the Public Works and Communications Commission and serving on the Territorial Limits and Civil Protection Commissions. During this time, he was a substitute deputy to the LVII Legislature. He would be a substitute local deputy to the LX Legislature of Veracruz; during this time, he was part of the PRI's Veracruz State Directive Committee and assisted in get out the vote efforts for PRI deputies in the lead-up to the 2006 general elections. He also started a business career, becoming director general of Transmilenia, a construction company. In 2009, while Kuri was serving his first term as a federal deputy, his company was criticized for abandoning paving work on a highway in Nogales, Veracruz. A reputation for incomplete projects has continued to dog Transmilenia; one 2015 report called it the company's \\"hallmark\\". In 2009, Kuri was elected to serve what would be the first of two terms in the federal Chamber of Deputies, representing Veracruz's 15th electoral district. During his first tour in San L√°zaro, he sat on the Youth and Sports, Communications, Citizen Participation, Tourism and Gender Equality Commissions. Three years after the end of the LXI Legislature, Kuri returned to the Chamber of Deputies, representing the same electoral district for the PRI. He currently sits on the Sports, Finances and Public Credit, and Housing Commissions of the Chamber of Deputies; he is the chairman of the former. In 2017, Kuri Grajales launched a campaign to become mayor of the city of Veracruz. Sports Kuri Grajales has owned several soccer teams. In 2008, he bought his local team, the Albinegros de Orizaba, who played in the Liga de Ascenso. In 2011, he transferred the franchise to the state government, which moved it to Veracruz as the Tiburones Rojos. Kuri then bought the Reboceros de La Piedad, which earned promotion to the Liga MX in 2013. The team was relocated from Michoac√°n to Veracruz to become the most recent incarnation of the Tiburones Rojos, effectively promoting the Veracruz team. When they won the Copa MX in April 2016, Kuri allowed H√©ctor Yunes Landa, the PRI's candidate for governor, to hoist the cup. In 2015, Proceso reported that the deal to move to Veracruz had occurred by way of an indefinite contract, in which Governor Javier Duarte sold Kuri's company, Promotora Deportiva del Valle de Orizaba, A.C., the rights to the name, logo, stadium and practice facilities at no cost. This contract was never signed by the state congress and legally expired in January 2014, though Kuri continues to profit from the club's intellectual property. The Mexican Football Federation suspended Kuri Grajales from all soccer-related activities in January 2016 and imposed a fine of 146,000 pesos for being involved in an altercation with the head of the referees, Edgardo Codesal. He had previously been fined in 2014 for criticism of referees. In September 2016, after a match in Puebla, Kuri, still banned by the FMF, entered the press area and confronted a local reporter, earning him an 8-month extension to his suspension. Journalists who witnessed the confrontation noted that Kuri was drunk. In May 2016, Kuri Grajales became the center of controversy when he threatened to move the Tiburones Rojos if the PRI did not win the impending gubernatorial elections; Tamaulipas, Sinaloa and Yucat√°n were floated as potential landing pads for the franchise. These statements ran contrary to Article 7 of the Code of Ethics of the Mexican Football Federation, which require team owners to \\"maintain a neutral position in political and religious matters\\". One week later, Kuri changed his mind and announced that, even though the PRI had lost the election, the Tiburones Rojos would remain in Veracruz. Kuri was additionally criticized during his Veracruz mayoral campaign for using the team as part of his campaign, including a logo featuring a shark, mixing team and campaign messages on his personal account, and the campaign slogan Veracruz de primera, which also refers to the team remaining in Liga MX.

The tissue ruptures as a result of the vapor bubble produced by the laser; the temperature required to produce this effect is between 100 and 305 ¬∞C. Because the infrared laser is invisible to the surgeon's eye, typically a companion HeNe laser is used in conjunction. However, the eye lens acts as a prism, so the infrared light bends at a shallower angle than the red light, causing chromatic aberration. This means the area highlighted by the HeNe laser is not precisely the area being affected Nd:YAG laser, and therefore some surgical lasers have an added adjustment to compensate. The first successful use of photodisruption was in 1972, on a case of trabecular meshwork. Photodisruption came to wide use in the early 1980s for the treatment of extracapsular cataract extraction. The technique is most commonly used for lithotripsy of urinary calculi and the treatment of posterior capsulotomy of the lens. When used in corneal surgery, picosecond and nanosecond disruptors are used on the lamellae of the corneal stroma, and the method may be preferable as it leaves the epithelium and Bowman's membrane unharmed. This modifies the outer corneal curvature, which affects the refractive property of the eye. References Category:Eye surgery ","title":"Photodisruption"},{"id":"44627635","text":"Charles W.

In its heydey, ECAT was one of the most powerful of all trade representation bodies for the private sector in the United States alongside the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. In that context, ECAT played a significant role in international negotiations. Most ECAT staff were former trade diplomats at the USTR, which is part of the Executive Office of the President of the United States. In 2016, ECAT dissolved. The former ECAT website is possible to view on archive.org.  History  Arthur K. Watson, founder of ECAT. Former CEO of IBM, 21st United States Ambassador to France ECAT was founded in 1967 by a consortium of American CEOs, who were interested in forwarding free trade and in curbing the trend towards protectionism in U.S. political circles. Arthur Watson, CEO of IBM was the founding President of ECAT. Watson was joined by a group of U.S. CEOs including David Rockefeller (Chase Manhatten Bank), George Moor (First City National Bank), William Hewitt (Deere & Co), Robert Ingersoll (Borg-Warner Corp), James Linen (Time Inc.), David Packard (James Roche (General Moters Corp), Thomas Taylor (International Packers, Ltd.), Charles B.

ECAT was very active in bilateral and regional negotiations of the United States, such as the Free Trade Area of the Americas treatyU.S. Free Trade Agreement with Central America and the Dominican Republic, U.S. International Trade Commission (FTAA), the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) negotiations. ECAT was also active in negotiations for the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) and the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TTP).  Members  In recent decades, ECAT has not published their membership lists. In 2015, an ECAT press-release stated that, \\"ECAT is an organization of the heads of leading U.S. international business enterprises representing all major sectors of the American economy, with annual worldwide sales exceeding $2.7 trillion and with employment exceeding 6.5 million workers.\\" In 2017, it's known that Rex Tillerson was a Member of ECAT, in his capacity as Chairman of ExxonMobil, until 2017.

The so- called Bayonne Legion (a French Foreign Legion infantry unit which consisted of ethnic Polish volunteers) clashed with troops of the Imperial German Army, defending the hill of Vimy, located 10 kilometers north of Arras, France. In August 1914, after the outbreak of the Great War, several ethnic Poles living in France volunteered to join French Foreign Legion, hoping that a separate, Polish unit would be created within that formation. On August 21, 1914, French authorities agreed to the request of Committee of Polish Volunteers, and soon afterwards, two Polish units were formed. Some volunteers were sent to Bayonne, where a company of some 180 soldiers was formed and trained. This company came to be called the Bayonne Legion, and it became 2nd Company of 1st Foreign Legion Regiment (1st Infantry Division). Its officers were French, while Poles served in lower ranks. Other volunteers were sent to Rueil, where a second company was formed. On October 22, 1914, the Bayonne Legion was sent to the frontline in Champagne, where they took positions near Sillery, Marne, as part of Moroccan Infantry Division. Until April 1915, the Poles kept their positions along the Aisne river. On May 9, the Legion attacked the hill of Vimy, located some ten kilometers from Arras. They managed to capture German trenches, but with very heavy losses, reaching 75% of the manpower. Only some 50 soldiers remained alive after the battle, and all officers died, including commandant of the Legion, major Osmonde. As a result of these losses, remnants of the unit were withdrawn to the rear. On June 16 near Souchez, several soldiers died in a clash with German forces, and in the summer of 1915, the company was dissolved. Most of the survivors in 1917 joined the Blue Army.

He was first an anarchist and then a socialist. He founded and wrote in the newspaper La Guerre sociale and the satirical weekly Le Bonnet rouge. During World War I (1914‚Äì18) he engaged in dubious business dealings that brought him considerable wealth. He became engaged in a struggle with right-wing forces, and was eventually arrested on the grounds of being a German agent. He died in prison at the age of 34, almost certainly murdered. He was the father of the film director Jean Vigo. Early years Eug√®ne Bonaventure Jean-Baptiste Vigo was born on 5 January 1883 in B√©ziers, H√©rault. His father was engaged in trade, born in Saillagouse, and his mother Marguerite Aim√©e Sales was a seamstress from Perpignan. The family originated in Err, Pyr√©n√©es-Orientales. His grandfather, from a family of minor nobility, was the magistrate and military chief of Andorra. His father died young. His mother moved back to Perpignan, where she married Gabriel Aub√®s, a photographer. Eug√®ne Bonaventure remained with his mother's parents when his mother and stepfather moved to the Dordogne and then to Paris. He joined them there at the age of fifteen, and Aub√®s helped him gain an apprenticeship as a photographer. He struggled to make a living, but found friends in anarchist circles, including the slightly older Fernand Despr√®s, for which he became known to the police. Eug√®ne Vigo was arrested in May 1900, ostensibly as an accessory in the receipt of stolen goods, but in fact for his anarchist activity. He served two months in prison at la Petite Roquette. It was here that he changed his name to \\"Miguel Almereyda\\". \\"Almereyda\\" is an anagram of \\"y'a la merde!\\" (there's shit) After being released he found work with a photographer on the Boulevard Saint-Denis, and published his first article in Le Libertaire in which he described plans to attack the judge who had convicted him with a bomb. This fizzled out, but in the summer of 1901 the police found explosives in his room. Almereyda was sentenced to a year in prison. He was released after serving most of his sentence, and again found work with a photographer. Militant journalist La Guerre Sociale 1 August 1914: \\"National Defense First!\\" Almereyda again began writing for Le Libertaire, and by the start of 1903 was one of the most prolific of the journal's writers. In March 1903 he gave up photography to devote himself to journalism and political activism. Around this time he fell in love with Emily Cl√©ro, a young militant, and they began to live together. The Ligue antimilitariste was founded in December 1902 by the anarchists Georges Yvetot, Henri Beylie, Paraf-Javal, Albert Libertad and √âmile Janvion. This became the French section of the Association internationale antimilitariste (AIA), which was the subject of intense police surveillance. In 26‚Äì28 June 1904 the AIA held its founding congress in Amsterdam, with a 12-member delegation from France. Yvetot and Almereyda led the French section and sat on the AIA committee. The congress was dominated by anarchists, but also included syndicalists and communists. The question of whether refusal of military service should be AIA strategy was hotly debated. In April 1905 Almereyda's companion Emily Cl√©ro gave birth to a son, whom they called Jean. In the fall of 1905 Almereyda and Gustave Herv√© plastered AIA posters all over Paris urging young men to resist conscription with violence if needed. They were charged for this, and on 30 December 1905 were found guilty and sent to Clairvaux prison. They and others were freed on 14 July 1906 in an amnesty. At the end of 1906 Almereyda and Eug√®ne Merle founded La Guerre Sociale (The Social War), a weekly paper, with Hervƒó as the principal editor. In April 1908 Almereyda was sentenced to two years in prison for praising the mutiny of the 17th Battalion at Narbonne, with another year added for having criticized the French expedition to Morocco. Almereyda remained in prison until August 1909. After his release he began discussing formation of a Revolutionary Party. He was leader of the \\"Liabeuf\\" affair, in which a large crowd demonstrated over the execution of a young cobbler, and a detective was killed. Herv√© was arrested for an article defending Liabeuf and was given a long prison sentence. During the railway strike of October 1910 Almereyda and Merle formed a group to organize sabotage, and were arrested and imprisoned until March 1911. On his release Almereyda founded the revolutionary group les Jeunes gardes r√©volutionnaires. La Guerre Sociale steadily became less revolutionary and more a supporter of left-wing republican ideals to be achieved legally. In December 1912 Almereyda joined the Socialist Party. By 1913 La Guerre Sociale had a circulation of 50,000, and Almereyda had a growing reputation in respectable liberal circles. Almereyda launched Le Bonnet rouge, a satirical anarchist publication, on 22 November 1913. The journal, \\"organ of the Republican defense\\", was the sworn enemy of the right-wing monarchist political movement Action Fran√ßaise. It began as a weekly paper, and quickly became popular. It became a daily in March 1914. Le Bonnet rouge published articles at the request of the Finance Minister Joseph Caillaux that defended his wife, Henriette Caillaux. She was accused of murdering Gaston Calmette, director of Le Figaro. Calmette had led a violent campaign against Caillaux, whom he accused of a policy of rapprochement with the Germans. Madame Caillaux had murdered him in a moment of madness. World War I Le Bonnet Rouge: \\"The Kings of the Republic\\" With the outbreak of war Le Bonnet Rouge and La Guerre Sociale accepted the need to fight to defend the country. After visiting the battlefields, Almereyda became convinced of the horrors of war, which he discussed in his articles, but also of the need to defend the republic and the government against extreme right-wing forces. The Interior Minister Louis Malvy gave a subsidy to Almereyda and Le Bonnet Rouge on the grounds that although they would criticize the war they would discourage violent opposition to the war, a tactic he called co-opting the left. Almereyda began to use Le Bonnet Rouge to advance various business interests, using the money for his personal use and to support the paper. Thus, he abandoned a campaign against alcohol when Pernod began giving the paper subsidies. By 1915 he was leading a lavish lifestyle, with a car, mistresses and a private mansion. Almereyda suffered from nephritis. His health deteriorated and he began taking morphine to relieve pain. In June 1915 Almereyda became involved in an increasingly vicious struggle with the L'Action Fran√ßaise movement. L√©on Daudet, editor of the movement's journal L'Action Fran√ßaise, described Almereyda as \\"Vigo the Traitor\\" and made vague insinuations about Almereyda's reasons for using a pseudonym. Le Bonnet Rouge became more and more critical of the conduct of the war. It made much of US President Woodrow Wilson's effort to have the belligerents declare their goals in preparation for a peace conference. It published Lenin's explanations of his goals in Russia. To the right wing, Lenin was a German agent. The paper lost its government subsidy and was subject to growing censorship. Between July 1916 and July 1917, when Le Bonnet Rouge was closed down, the censors blanked out 1,076 of the paper's articles. In July 1917 the business administrator of Le Bonnet Rouge was arrested on his return from a trip to Switzerland, and was found to have a check on a German bank account for 100,000 francs. Almereyda faced a furious attack from the far right and from Georges Clemenceau. Almereyda's political allies Louis Malvy and Joseph Cailloux were accused of commerce with the enemy. Almerayda was arrested and sent to La Sant√© Prison in the 14th arrondissement. Due to his health problems he was transferred to Fresnes Prison outside Paris. In the morning of 14 August 1917 he was found dead in his cell, strangled with his bootlaces. The cause of death was given as suicide, but he had almost certainly been murdered. The autopsy found that his abdomen was full of pus and he was struggling with a burst appendix. Almereyda's son Jean Vigo later became a well-known film director. He had been profoundly affected by his turbulent childhood, and was always convinced that his father was innocent. The influence of Almereyda shows clearly in several of Vigo's films such as √Ä propos de Nice, Z√©ro de conduite and L'Atalante.

History German glider pilots and designers have made many contributions to the development of glider aerodynamics and flight techniques. The Wasserkuppe has been a gliding site since about 1910 and was closely associated with the emergence of gliding as a sport during the interwar period. In particular it hosted the annual series of gliding competitions, started in 1920, that became known as the Rh√∂n contests. Initially national, they became international events. Because of its long association with the sport, it seemed a natural home for a national gliding museum, an idea conceived in 1970 with the 50th anniversary of the first Rh√∂n contest. The Deutsches Segelflugmuseum mit Modellflug was officially opened in August 1987 in a purpose built hall. By 2014 the collection included more than sixty aircraft, all German, showing their development from Otto Lilienthal's hang gliders through wooden machines to the earliest glassfibre aircraft of the 1960s. There are also photographic records, focussing on the series of Rh√∂n contests, with aircraft pilots and designers. The museum has a store for aircraft which are not currently on display and a workshop for restoring them. In 2014 these held some twenty-five aircraft.

African Books Collective) Butterfly Burning is a novel by Zimbabwean writer Yvonne Vera that was first published on January 1, 1998. Set in the late 1940s, it is about the voice of the people under colonialism in Zimbabwe. It is a romantic story that follows the life of construction worker Fumbatha, who falls in love with Phephelaphi, a much younger woman.  Synopsis  Phephelaphi seems to view Fumbatha as though in a fantasy world, as she wades out of the waterway in the township of Makokoba. The two fall in love, but Phephelaphi soon tires of his devotion, even while living with him. Prior to her mother's murder, Phephelaphi studied to become self-sufficient. After gaining a position at a neighbourhood nursing school, she learns she is pregnant and no longer qualified for the class. Therefore, she induces an abortion to be able to apply for the program. Questioning his love for her, he ends up cheating on her. At some point, he later admits to an affair with another woman.  Characters  There are two main characters in this novel: Phephelaphi: A young, independent, educated woman with ambition and dreams. Her mother was killed by her ex-lover, a white policeman. She lives with her mother's friends, but soon leaves to live with Fumbatha. She gains a nursing position, but then finds out that she is pregnant and decides to perform her own abortion. Fumbatha: A middle-aged male construction worker who is relatively poor. He falls in love with Phephelaphi, and they live together in a one-bedroom apartment. Tension between the couple arises when Fumbatha finds out that Phephelaphi plans on performing her own abortion. At the end she sets herself on fire as Fumbatha enters their house.  Reception  Butterfly Burning received enthusiastic critical attention, with World Literature Today describing it as \\"richly poetic while also brutally realistic...a compelling work of fiction\\", and Michelle Cliff writing in the Voice Literary Supplement: \\"Vera explodes myths of womanhood and romance, and realistically and unsentimentally depicts the price women may pay for their longing to become someone, to decolonize themselves.\\"\\"Butterfly Burning\\" at The Complete Review.

The Greek Orthodox Church also built a small chapel inside the fortress dedicated to Saint Arsenius. Today there is no trace of these temples.[Afr.Agoropoulou- Mpirmpili: The Architecture of Corfu Latin Churches and position of the fabric of the city during the Venetian practical VII panioniou Lefkada Conference 26‚Äì30 May 2002 Volume II Athens 2004] Regarding the founding date of the new cathedral the information is not clear. In the place where today the church of the 15th century there was a ruined church and between 1431 and 1454 members of the brotherhood of the Saints James and Christopher asked permission from the then archbishop Martinus Bernardini to build there a guesthouse - a hospital for the needy, the sick and travelers members from brotherhood. The act of the Archdiocese was approved by papal bull on July 7, 1466 which required the fraternity to recruit priest and administrator at the same time offered the archbishop each year on February 2 liters a candle to commemorate the transfer of images of Saints James and Christopher on that day the church of St. Francis where they were in the new temple. In another version it was built only two chapels dedicated to Saint Jason and Sosipater. On December 31, 1533 the Latin Archbishop Jacobus Cocco consecrated the temple.[Dim.Chr.Kapadochou: Tribute to History of Corfu Athens 2001] During the second Turkish siege in 1571 the church suffered damages. The Historical Archive of Venice saved draft of the 1622 proposal showing extension of the building because it was too small for the needs of a cathedral. In 1658 it was renovated fundamentally from the Latin Archbishop Carclus Labia at his own expense. During his days Labia added as archbishop of Corfu the official celebration of Saint Spyridon's memory. After the reconstruction of this temple it was declared a Catholic Cathedral in August 1632. By order of the provveditore generale Philip Pasqualligo to the then Latin Bishop Benodictus Bragadinus (1620-1623) it was transferred to the Diocese bones of St. Arsenius and which remained until 1944 when he returned to the Orthodox Church.[Afr.Agoropoulou- Mpirmpili: The Architecture of Corfu Latin Churches and position of the fabric of the city during the Venetian practical VII panioniou Lefkada Conference 26‚Äì30 May 2002 Volume II Athens 2004] On October 23, 1709 the church was renovated again by the Latin Archbishop Augustinus Zacco (1706-1723) and was the center of Catholic worship rituals of the island. The last surgery before the war was done by Engineer Serpieri that in 1905 reformed outside the Temple. On the night of September 13, 1943 after German bombing it was completely destroyed the exterior of the church. Final form of the building Interior The final form of the building after the additional extensions is an aisled wooden roof basilica with three side chapels on each side (covered with monastic vaults and communicate with the main aisle with arched openings) and polygonal sanctuary particularly impressive size. Before repairing the temple seems that the main altar was once located deep in the Sanctuary and covered with ciborium reported as configured by parts, with architectural elements and sculptures from the Temple of the Annunciation. The total area of the Temple (Temple and aisles) than to 600 sq.m. The access to the temple is from the west side close three doorways, a main central and two symmetrically arranged this. Inner side is shaped balcony narrow for the body (has been rebuilt from reinforced concrete). The floor of which rested before the destruction of the monument on four marble columns with paliotatous trunks coming in the publications or the Cathedral of the Old Fortress or from an ancient temple and which capitals were later 17th century. The roof of the main temple is situated at a height of 9.20 meters from the floor, around the base of the gable roof, which nests beams indicated in the plans of the stent, even specified that before the war was decorated with pictures of Christ, the Virgin Mary and the Apostles.[Sp.K.Papageorgiou: History Ekklisias of Kerkyras.Kerkyra 1920] The exterior of the church was reformed in the early 20th century. The central part of the face, which comprises three members, organized on rates (Tuscan pilasters) in two-storey layout and results in a triangular pediment. Curved blades are connecting the ends and lower parts of the central. The device reminds some example of Late Baroque churches of Venice which are based on the solution of the church of Iisy of Vignola. The face is accompanied by Tower Gothic morphology, while the bell steeple, a relatively small amount and with pyramidal ending, at the back next to the sanctuary.[Afr.Agoropoulou- Mpirmpili: The Architecture of Corfu Latin Churches and position of the fabric of the city during the Venetian practical VII panioniou Lefkada Conference 26‚Äì30 May 2002 Volume II Athens 2004] Chapels inside the church * Chapel of Saint Spyridon and Saint Arsenic inside the church * Chapel with the Byzantine icon of Our Lady of Health * Chapel of St. Theresa of Lizzie * Chapel of Saint Spyridon and Saint Arsenic * Chapel of Immaculate Conception of Mary * Chapel of Panachrantos Sacrament of the Eucharist Sources * https://web.archive.org/web/20150313150014/http://www.catholic-church- corfu.org/duomo.html References James and Christopher Category:Buildings and structures in Corfu (city) Category:Italianate architecture in Greece ","title":"Cathedral of Saint James and Saint Christopher"},{"id":"44627990","text":"Will St Leger is a street artist/artivist, Radio DJ and Gay Rights activist living in Dublin, Ireland.

From 1914 to 1962, Samoa was governed as the Western Samoa Trust Territory by the United Kingdom and New Zealand. During this time, awards of the British honours system were made to select individuals. For example, the first Prime Minister of Samoa, Fiame Mata'afa Faumuina Mulinu'u II was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire and Le Mamea Matatumua Ata, a framer of the constitution of Samoa, was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire on the New Zealand list in the 1960 Birthday Honours. Established by the act of 1992 and reaffirmed by the act of 1999, the Honours and Awards Committee is a part of the Ministry of the Prime Minister and Cabinet Office. The committee is responsible for considering those who may be eligible for awards or honorary awards and recommending those deemed worthy of awards to the Cabinet. The committee also reviews those who are prior award recipients and may recommend the granting of subsequent higher awards where deemed appropriate. History After the independence of Samoa, the first award created was the Grand Order of Vailima. This order was intended to be Samoa's highest decoration of honour. The order was first awarded to Queen Elizabeth II when she visited Samoa on 11 February 1977 during the Silver Jubilee Pacific tour. On 28 May 1992, the Parliament of Samoa passed AN ACT to provide for the conferring or granting of awards in recognition of acts of heroism or meritorious service to Western Samoa, known as the Merit Act 1992/1993. This act set up the administrative mechanisms to manage the recommending and presentation of awards. It set forth that the Head of State, acting upon the advice of the cabinet, could make awards to worthy individuals. It further established the Merit Board to consider individuals eligible for awards and making recommendations to the cabinet of those persons. Individuals deemed worthy of recognition who were not Samoan citizens could be granted an honorary award. Holders of honorary awards do not figure into the total number of award holders. The act further spelled out monetary payments that were to be made to recipients upon being granted an award. The act set forth the following awards: *Malietoa Tanumafili II Distinguished Service Order (M.T.II.D.S.O.) ‚Äì Conferred for exceptional bravery or heroism in the preservation of life or order, or the preservation of property or things needed for the national interest in the face of any disaster or emergency. This award is the only one that may be made posthumously. The order is limited to no more than 15 living recipients. Individuals who have been awarded the Malietoa Tanumafili II Distinguished Service Order are also awarded a tax exempt payment of $1,500. *Western Samoa Order of Tiafau (W.S.O.T.) ‚Äì Conferred for long and outstanding public and private service to Samoa. It could also be awarded to leaders of corporations, foreign states, or organizations who have provided lengthy valuable service and friendship to Samoa. Eligible foreign leaders would be Heads of state, Governors, Prime Ministers, Cabinet Ministers or holders of equivalent offices. The Western Samoa Order of Tiafau is limited to 20 living recipients. Samoan recipients were awarded a tax exempt payment of $1,000. *Western Samoa Order of Merit (W.S.O.M.) ‚Äì Conferred for outstanding achievement which brings a direct or indirect benefit to Western Samoa, or brings credit to Western Samoa. Eligible individuals are Members of Parliament or Ministers of State, members of an organization devoted to the welfare of Samoa or Samoans, a self-employed person, an employee, a volunteer, an academic or student, those engaged in literary activity, those engaged in the arts or crafts, and sports persons. The Western Samoa Order of Merit was limited to 20 living recipients. Samoan recipients were awarded a tax exempt payment of $1,000. *Western Samoa Certificate of Excellence (W.S.C.E.) ‚Äì Conferred for exceptionally high achievement which brings a direct or indirect benefit to Western Samoa, or brings credit to Western Samoa. Eligible individuals are Members of Parliament or Ministers of State, members of an organization devoted to the welfare of Samoa or Samoans, a self-employed person, an employee, a volunteer, an academic or student, those engaged in literary activity, those engaged in the arts or crafts, and sports persons. The Western Samoa Certificate of Excellence may is limited to 20 awards per year. Samoan recipients were awarded a tax exempt payment of $500. Current honours and awards The current honours system came about on 25 August 1999 with the passage of AN ACT to repeal the Merit Act 1992/1993, No. 3 and to consolidate the system for the conferring of awards in recognition of meritorious service to Samoa or acts of bravery. also known by its short title as the Honours and Awards Act 1999. This act did away with all of the awards of the Merit Act 1992/1993, but left in place many of the mechanisms for administering and awarding its honours. Among them is the retaining of the Merit Board, but renaming it the Honours and Awards Committee. The honours awarded under the Merit Act 1992/1993 are still considered valid and they maintain their status and recognition. There is a further section that states any honours not attached to the Merit Act 1992/1993 are also still valid and maintain their status and recognition. Monetary awards are limited to only the top two gallantry awards under the act of 1999. The Honours and Awards Act 1999 divides awards into two distinct categories: awards for civil service and awards for bravery and gallantry. The act defines civil service as, \\"...service of Samoa in any capacity, and includes service in the private and religious sectors.\\" The awards established by the act are as follows, in their order of precedence: ;Awards for Civil Service *Grand Order of Samoa ‚Äì Special Class (G.O.S.) *Order of Samoa ‚Äì Poloaiga Sili a Samoa *Order of Samoa ‚Äì First Class (O.S.) *Companion to the Order of Samoa ‚Äì Second Class (C.O.S.) *Order of Merit (O.M.) *Officer of the Order of Samoa ‚Äì Third Class (O.S.) *Member of the Order of Samoa ‚Äì Fourth Class (M.S.) *Head of State's Service Order (H.S.S.O.) *Head of State's Service Medal (H.S.S.M.) ;Awards for Bravery and Gallantry *Malietoa Cross (M.C.) *Samoa Cross (S.C.) *Samoa Medal of Honour (S.M.H.) *Head of State's Medal for Valour (H.S.M.V.)

The number of northern white rhinos was already considered to be only around 700 animals in the wild. For many environmentalists, leaving the animals in nature was the only acceptable way of preserving the already rare subspecies. The Dv≈Ør Kr√°lov√© Zoo and their Chipperfield partners were then criticized for the capture. The zoo was specialising in African fauna and already had their largest collection out of Africa. Life in the Czech Republic In 1975 the group including Sudan was shipped to the Dv≈Ør Kr√°lov√© Zoo for their northern white rhinoceros display. The zoo was the only one in the world where northern white rhinos have successfully given birth, with the last calf being born in 2000.

The Conservation Breeding Specialist Group of the IUCN met in 1986 in Dv≈Ør Kr√°lov√© Zoo to discuss the ways to preserve the dwindling number of northern white rhinos. The efforts to save the subspecies included the import of Ben (an older male from London) in 1986 and the return of Saut (a calf from the original 1975 group) from San Diego Zoo in 1998 to Dv≈Ør Kr√°lov√© Zoo. Attempts to join the group with several southern rhinos met only with mixed success.

The meeting of the Czech Zoo with IUCN African Rhino Specialist Group (AfRSG), World Zoo and Aquarium Association WAZA, Berlin institute IZW as well as experts from Vienna Veterinary institute and the European Zoo and Aquarium Association EAZA recommended to move Sudan and his group from the Czech Republic to Africa. Substantial debate succeeded and strong objections were raised against this proposal, especially given the fact that expert and scientific organisations were available in Europe and insemination efforts could have continued in the Czech Republic.https://ekolist.cz/cz/zpravodajstvi/zpravy/nosorozci-na-hrane-zaniku- zoo-dvur-kralove-chce-svoje-nejvzacnejsi-zvirata-prevezt-do-afriky Return to Africa Sudan in 2015In December 2009 the rhinos were moved to the Ol Pejeta Conservancy for a \\"Last Chance To Survive\\" breeding program, along with three other northern white rhinoceroses.

After a series of conquests by the Song dynasty, Chen, who was a vassal to Song, believed that it would be wise for him to surrender his realm, and did so. He subsequently remained honored as a Song general until his death.  Background and service under Liu Congxiao  Chen Hongjin was born in 914.History of Song, vol. 483. His ancestors were said to be originally from Linhuai (Ëá®Ê∑Æ, in modern Suqian, Jiangsu), but had relocated south and settled at Xianyou (‰ªôÈÅä, in modern Putian, Fujian), and thus Chen was said to be from Xianyou.Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms, vol. 93. Chen was said to be ambitious and studious in his youth, particularly spending attention to military strategies. When he grew older, he was known for an impressive stature and bravery, and became a soldier at Quan Prefecture (Ê≥âÂ∑û, in modern Quanzhou, Fujian), which Xianyou belonged to. In a siege of Ting Prefecture (Ê±ÄÂ∑û, in modern Longyan, Fujian), Chen successfully climbed up the city wall first, and after the battle, became a deputy commander of the Quan army (ÂâØÂÖµÈ¶¨‰Ωø, Fu Bingma Shi). (It is not completely clear which battle this reference was to. As this was before the subsequent events described here, it might have been referring to a 941 incident where then-ruler of Min, Wang Xi (Emperor Jingzong), concerned that his younger brother Wang Yanxi () the prefect of Ting was getting ready to join the cause of another brother, Wang Yanzheng, who had risen against his rule at Jian Prefecture (Âª∫Â∑û, in modern Nanping, Fujian), sent the general Xu Renqin () with 3,000 men to launch a surprise attack on Ting, capturing Wang Yanxi.)See Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 282. As of 944, the Min state was in turmoil, as the general Zhu Wenjin had just assassinated the emperor Wang Yanxi (Emperor Jingzong) and seized the throne, and was battling with Wang Yanxi's younger brother Wang Yanzheng (who had earlier declared himself the emperor of a new branch state of Yin) for the control of the realm. Zhu, after his coup, sent the general Huang Shaopo () to serve as the prefect of Quan. The officer Liu Congxiao encouraged other officers, including Wang Zhongshun (), Zhang Hansi, and Dong Si'an () to join him in a plot against Huang, arguing that they, having been the long-term subjects of Min's ruling Wang family, could not stand by and allow Zhu to take over. They agreed, and they assassinated Huang and supported Wang Yanzheng's nephew Wang Jixun () to serve as the acting prefect, pledging their allegiance to Wang Yanzheng. Liu sent Chen to deliver Huang's head to Wang Yanzheng at Jian. When he got to Youxi (Â∞§Ê∫™, in modern Sanmin, Fujian), he was intercepted by a Fu detachment that was taking position at Youxi. Chen declared to them, \\"The righteous forces have already killed Zhu at Fu. I am going to pay homage to the new emperor. Why are you still defending this position?\\" He also showed Huang's head to them. Upon seeing Huang's head, the Fu detachment scattered and fled, and several of the officers accompanied him to Jian to pay homage to Wang Yanzheng. Wang Yanzheng commissioned Wang Jixun as the prefect of Quan, and commissioned Liu, Wang Zhongshun, Dong, and Chen all as commanders of the Quan army.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 284. After Wang Yanzheng himself was attacked by and surrendered to Southern Tang, Quan came under allegiance to Southern Tang. In 946, Liu, alleging that Wang Jixun was incompetent, removed him; Southern Tang's emperor Li Jing then summoned Wang Jixun to the capital Jinling and left Liu in control of Quan.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 285. After Li subsequently commissioned Liu as the military governor (Jiedushi) of Qingyuan Circuit, Chen, serving as the commander of the army, shared the command with Zhang, who became deputy military governor, and Chen was said to have frequent battlefield accomplishments.  Seizure and rule of Qingyuan Circuit  Liu Congxiao apparently died in 962. Under the account given in the Xu Zizhi Tongjian (also adopted in the Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms), after Liu Congxiao's death, as Liu Shaoji was then on a tributary mission sent by Liu Congxiao to the Southern Tang court, Liu Shaozi took over as acting military governor. However, not long after, Chen Hongjin seized him and falsely accused him of planning to submit to Wuyue, and then delivered him to Southern Tang and supported Zhang Hansi, who was then the deputy military governor, as the new acting military governor.Xu Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 2. Under the account in Liu's biography in the History of Song, the coup happened before Liu Congxiao's death, and therefore (implicitly) Liu Shaozi never controlled the circuit‚Äîbut under Chen's biography, it gave the same account as the Xu Zizhi Tongjian (i.e., the coup was during Liu Shaozi's rule). It was said, though, that Zhang, on account of his old age, was incapable of governing the circuit, and most of the matters ended up being decided by Chen, whom he made the deputy military governor. Zhang was apprehensive about Chen's hold over the governance, and held a feast, intending to set a trap for Chen at the feast and kill him. Before the ambush could occur, however, an earthquake happened, shocking Zhang's adherents, who then informed Chen. Chen immediately left the feast before he could be ambushed. Zhang, now fearing that Chen would act first, had his own headquarters put under heavy guard. In summer 963, Chen took his soldiers and headed for Zhang's headquarters. When arriving at the headquarters, rather than attacking it, he simply ordered Zhang's guards to disperse, and the guards, apparently intimidated, did so. He then entered the headquarters and, finding Zhang in the inner chambers, locked the inner chambers, stating to him, \\"The soldiers and the civilian administrators all thought you, Lord, to be senile and crazy. They asked me, Chen Hongjin, to take over on an acting basis. You cannot resist the will of the people. Please yield your seal.\\" Zhang, surprised and not able to think what else to do, turned his seal to Chen, who then announced the transition to the officers and administrators and took over control of the circuit. Chen moved Zhang to a retreat home and put him under house arrest there, under heavy guard. Zhang died of natural causes several years later.Xu Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 3. Chen reported the events to Li Jing's son and successor Li Yu, who then commissioned him as the military governor of Qingyuan. However, he also secretly sent the officer Wei Renji () to Song‚Äîwhich controlled the Central Plains region and had by that point forced Southern Tang into submission as a vassal‚Äîasking to directly submit to Song's Emperor Taizu (as Liu Congxiao had). The Song emperor accepted Chen's submission, and also wrote an edict to Li Yu explaining his decision in accepting a direct submission from Li Yu's subject. Li Yu responded, \\"Chen Hongjin is treacherous, like a rat looking in both directions. He is not worth listening to.\\" Emperor Taizu issued a second explanatory edict to Li Yu, and Li Yu then acquiesced. In 964, then, Emperor Taizu commissioned Chen as the military governor‚Äîand changed the name of the circuit to Pinghai (). He also commissioned Chen's sons Chen Wenxian () as deputy military governor and Chen Wenhao () as the prefect of Zhang Prefecture (Êº≥Â∑û, in modern Zhangzhou, Fujian). In summer 964, Chen Hongjin's mother died, but Emperor Taizu then formally recalled him to governmental service. It was said that Chen levied heavy taxes on the people and allowed the rich to substitute mandatory labor with money, in order to submit rich tributes to the Song emperor. Further, his administration was plagued by corruption, and the people were distressed. In 975, Song conquered Southern Tang by force. In 976, Wuyue's king Qian Chu went to the Song capital Kaifeng to pay homage to Emperor Taizu.Xu Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 8. These events caused Chen to become apprehensive about his position. He sent Chen Wenhao to submit a tribute of frankincense, ivory, and dipterocarps. Emperor Taizu then summoned him to Kaifeng, and he decided to go. However, when he reached South Jian Prefecture (ÂçóÂäçÂ∑û, in modern Nanping), news arrived that Emperor Taizu had died. He then turned back to Quan and declared a period of mourning for the emperor, rather than proceeding to Kaifeng to pay homage to Emperor Taizu's brother and successor Emperor Taizong. In 977, Chen decided to go to Kaifeng to pay homage to the new emperor. Emperor Taizong sent the official Cheng Deyuan () to meet him at Su Prefecture (ÂÆøÂ∑û, in modern Suzhou, Anhui) to welcome him. Once Chen arrived at Kaifeng, he was welcomed in a grand ceremony. Chen, then, under the advice of his staff member Liu Changyan (), decided to surrender his territory (Pinghai Circuit, consisting of Quan and Zhang Prefectures) to the Song emperor completely. Emperor Taizong accepted, ending the semi-independence of the region. (Chen's surrender of the territory helped persuade Qian Chu to do the same with his Wuyue kingdom later in the year.)Xu Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 9.  After surrender to Song  Emperor Taizong commissioned Chen Hongjin as the military governor of Wuning Circuit (Ê≠¶ÂØß, headquartered in modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu), and gave him the honorary chancellor designation of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (). (However, by this point, military governorships were gradually waning in authority due to Emperor Taizu's centralization of the army.) He kept Chen at the capital Kaifeng, and awarded Chen a large award of platinum and a mansion. Chen's sons were made prefects of prefectures not far from the capital. In 979, Chen accompanied Emperor Taizong on his campaign to conquest Northern Han. In 981, he was created the Duke of Q«ê. In 984, he was created the greater title of Duke of Q√≠ (note different tone). Chen, in his old age by this point, then requested formal retirement. Emperor Taizong thereafter excused him from attendance of imperial meetings. He died of illness in 985, and was given posthumous honors.

When connected to the cloud, robots can benefit from the powerful computation, storage, and communication resources of modern data center in the cloud, which can process and share information from various robots or agent (other machines, smart objects, humans, etc.). Humans can also delegate tasks to robots remotely through networks. Cloud computing technologies enable robot systems to be endowed with powerful capability whilst reducing costs through cloud technologies. Thus, it is possible to build lightweight, low cost, smarter robots with an intelligent \\"brain\\" in the cloud. The \\"brain\\" consists of data center, knowledge base, task planners, deep learning, information processing, environment models, communication support, etc. Components A cloud for robots potentially has at least six significant components: * Offering a global library of images, maps, and object data, often with geometry and mechanical properties, expert system, knowledge base (i.e. semantic web, data centres)Ôºõ * Massively-parallel computation on demand for sample-based statistical modelling and motion planning, task planning, multi-robot collaboration, scheduling and coordination of systemÔºõ * Robot sharing of outcomes, trajectories, and dynamic control policies and robot learning supportÔºõ * Human sharing of \\"open-source\\" code, data, and designs for programming, experimentation, and hardware constructionÔºõ * On-demand human guidance and assistance for evaluation, learning, and error recovery; * Augmented human‚Äìrobot interaction through various way (Semantics knowledge base, Apple SIRI like service etc.).  Applications  ;Autonomous mobile robots: Google's self-driving cars are cloud robots. The cars use the network to access Google's enormous database of maps and satellite and environment model (like Streetview) and combines it with streaming data from GPS, cameras, and 3D sensors to monitor its own position within centimetres, and with past and current traffic patterns to avoid collisions. Each car can learn something about environments, roads, or driving, or conditions, and it sends the information to the Google cloud, where it can be used to improve the performance of other cars. ;Cloud medical robots: a medical cloud (also called a healthcare cluster) consists of various services such as a disease archive, electronic medical records, a patient health management system, practice services, analytics services, clinic solutions, expert systems, etc. A robot can connect to the cloud to provide clinical service to patients, as well as deliver assistance to doctors (e.g. a co-surgery robot). Moreover, it also provides a collaboration service by sharing information between doctors and care givers about clinical treatment. ;Assistive robots: A domestic robot can be employed for healthcare and life monitoring for elderly people. The system collects the health status of users and exchange information with cloud expert system or doctors to facilitate elderly peoples life, especially for those with chronic diseases. For example, the robots are able to provide support to prevent the elderly from falling down, emergency healthy support such as heart disease, blooding disease. Care givers of elderly people can also get notification when in emergency from the robot through network. ;Industrial robots: As highlighted by the German government's Industry 4.0 Plan, \\"Industry is on the threshold of the fourth industrial revolution. Driven by the Internet, the real and virtual worlds are growing closer and closer together to form the Internet of Things. Industrial production of the future will be characterised by the strong individualisation of products under the conditions of highly flexible (large series) production, the extensive integration of customers and business partners in business and value-added processes, and the linking of production and high-quality services leading to so-called hybrid products.\\" In manufacturing, such cloud based robot systems could learn to handle tasks such as threading wires or cables, or aligning gaskets from a professional knowledge base. A group of robots can share information for some collaborative tasks. Even more, a consumer is able to place customised product orders to manufacturing robots directly with online ordering systems. Another potential paradigm is shopping-delivery robot systems. Once an order is placed, a warehouse robot dispatches the item to an autonomous car or autonomous drone to deliver it to its recipient.  Research  ' was funded by the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development projects, specifically to explore the field of cloud robotics. The goal of RoboEarth is to allow robotic systems to benefit from the experience of other robots, paving the way for rapid advances in machine cognition and behaviour, and ultimately, for more subtle and sophisticated human-machine interaction. RoboEarth offers a Cloud Robotics infrastructure. RoboEarth‚Äôs World-Wide-Web style database stores knowledge generated by humans ‚Äì and robots ‚Äì in a machine-readable format. Data stored in the RoboEarth knowledge base include software components, maps for navigation (e.g., object locations, world models), task knowledge (e.g., action recipes, manipulation strategies), and object recognition models (e.g., images, object models). The RoboEarth Cloud Engine includes support for mobile robots, autonomous vehicles, and drones, which require lots of computation for navigation. Rapyuta is an open source cloud robotics framework based on RoboEarth Engine developed by the robotics researcher at ETHZ. Within the framework, each robot connected to Rapyuta can have a secured computing environment (rectangular boxes) giving them the ability to move their heavy computation into the cloud. In addition, the computing environments are tightly interconnected with each other and have a high bandwidth connection to the RoboEarth knowledge repository. KnowRob is an extensional project of RoboEarth. It is a knowledge processing system that combines knowledge representation and reasoning methods with techniques for acquiring knowledge and for grounding the knowledge in a physical system and can serve as a common semantic framework for integrating information from different sources. ' is a large-scale computational system that learns from publicly available Internet resources, computer simulations, and real-life robot trials. It accumulates everything robotics into a comprehensive and interconnected knowledge base. Applications include prototyping for robotics research, household robots, and self-driving cars. The goal is as direct as the project's name‚Äîto create a centralised, always-online brain for robots to tap into. The project is dominated by Stanford University and Cornell University. And the project is supported by the National Science Foundation, the Office of Naval Research, the Army Research Office, Google, Microsoft, Qualcomm, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and the National Robotics Initiative, whose goal is to advance robotics to help make the United States more competitive in the world economy. MyRobots is a service for connecting robots and intelligent devices to the Internet. It can be regarded as a social network for robots and smart objects (i.e. Facebook for robots). With socialising, collaborating and sharing, robots can benefit from those interactions too by sharing their sensor information giving insight on their perspective of their current state. ' is funded by the INTERREG IVA France (Channel) ‚Äì England European cross-border co-operation programme. The project aims to develop new technologies for handicapped people through social and technological innovation and through the users' social and psychological integrity. Objectives is to produce a cognitive ambient assistive living system with Healthcare cluster in cloud with domestic service robots like humanoid, intelligent wheelchair which connect with the cloud. ROS (Robot Operating System) provides an eco-system to support cloud robotics. ROS is a flexible and distributed framework for robot software development. It is a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behaviour across a wide variety of robotic platforms. A library for ROS that is a pure Java implementation, called rosjava, allows Android applications to be developed for robots. Since Android has a booming market and billion users, it would be significant in the field of Cloud Robotics. DAVinci Project is a proposed software framework that seeks to explore the possibilities of parallelizing some of the robotics algorithms as Map/Reduce tasks in Hadoop. The project aims to build a cloud computing environment capable of providing a compute cluster built with commodity hardware exposing a suite of robotic algorithms as a SaaS and share data co-operatively across the robotic ecosystem. This initiative is not available publicly. C2RO (C2RO Cloud Robotics) is a platform that processes real-time applications such as collision avoidance and object recognition in the cloud. Previously, high latency times prevented these applications from being processed in the cloud thus requiring on-system computational hardware (e.g. Graphics Processing Unit or GPU). C2RO published a peer-reviewed paper at IEEE PIMRC17 showing its platform could make autonomous navigation and other AI services available on robots- even those with limited computational hardware (e.g. a Raspberry Pi)- from the cloud. C2RO eventually claimed to be the first platform to demonstrate cloud-based SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) at RoboBusiness in September 2017. Noos is a cloud robotics service, providing centralised intelligence to robots that are connected to it. The service went live in December 2017. By using the Noos-API, developers could access services for computer vision, deep learning, and SLAM. Noos was developed and maintained by Ortelio Ltd. Rocos is a centralized cloud robotics platform that provides the developer tooling and infrastructure to build, test, deploy, operate and automate robot fleets at scale. Founded in October 2017, the platform went live in January 2019.  Limitations of cloud robotics  Though robots can benefit from various advantages of cloud computing, cloud is not the solution to all of robotics. * Controlling a robot‚Äôs motion which relies heavily on (real-time) sensors and feedback of controller may not benefit much from the cloud. * Tasks that involve real-time execution require on-board processing. * Cloud-based applications can get slow or unavailable due to high-latency responses or network hitch. If a robot relies too much on the cloud, a fault in the network could leave it ‚Äúbrainless.‚Äù  Challenges  The research and development of cloud robotics has following potential issues and challenges: *Scalable parallelisation-grid-computing, parallelisation schemes scale with the size of automation infrastructure. *Effective load balancing: Balancing operations between local and cloud computation. *Knowledge bases and representations *Collective learning for automation in cloud *Infrastructure/Platform or Software as a Service *Internet of Things for robotics *Integrated and collaborative fault-tolerant control *Big Data: Data, collected and/or disseminated over large, accessible networks can enable decisions for classification problems or reveal patterns. *Wireless communication, Connectivity to the cloud *System architectures of robot cloud *Open-source, open-access infrastructures * Workload-sharing * Standards and Protocols  Risks  *Environmental security - The concentration of computing resources and users in a cloud computing environment also represents a concentration of security threats. Because of their size and significance, cloud environments are often targeted by virtual machines and bot malware, brute force attacks, and other attacks. *Data privacy and security - Hosting confidential data with cloud service providers involves the transfer of a considerable amount of an organisation's control over data security to the provider. For example, every cloud contains a huge information from the clients include personal data. If a household robot is hacked, users could have risk of their personal privacy and security, like house layout, life snapshot, home-view, etc. It may be accessed and leaked to the world around by criminals. Another problems is once a robot is hacked and controlled by someone else, which may put the user in danger. *Ethical problems - Some ethics of robotics, especially for cloud based robotics must be considered. Since a robot is connected via networks, it has risk to be accessed by other people. If a robot is out of control and carries out illegal activities, who should be responsible for it.  History  The term \\"Cloud Robotics\\" first appeared in the public lexicon as part of a talk given by James Kuffner in 2010 at the IEEE/RAS International Conference on Humanoid Robotics entitled \\"Cloud-enabled Robots\\". Since then, \\"Cloud Robotics\\" has become a general term encompassing the concepts of information sharing, distributed intelligence, and fleet learning that is possible via networked robots and modern cloud computing. Kuffner was part of Google when he delivered his presentation and the technology company has teased its various cloud robotics initiatives until 2019 when it launched the Google Cloud Robotics Platform for developers. From the early days of robot development, it was common to have computation done on a computer that was separated from the actual robot mechanism, but connected by wires for power and control. As wireless communication technology developed, new forms of experimental \\"remote brain\\" robots were developed controlled by small, onboard compute resources for robot control and safety, that were wirelessly connected to a more powerful remote computer for heavy processing. The term \\"cloud computing\\" was popularized with the launch of Amazon EC2 in 2006. It marked the availability of high- capacity networks, low-cost computers and storage devices as well as the widespread adoption of hardware virtualization and service-oriented architecture. In a correspondence with Popular Science in July 2006, Kuffner wrote that after a robot was programmed or successfully learned to perform a task it could share its model and relevant data with all other cloud-connected robots: Some publications and events related to Cloud Robotics (in chronological order): * The IEEE RAS Technical Committee on Internet and Online Robots was founded by Ken Goldberg and Roland Siegwart et al. in May 2001. The committee then expanded to IEEE Society of Robotics and Automation's Technical Committee on Networked Robots in 2004. * James J. Kuffner, a former CMU robotics professor, and research scientist at Google, now CTO of Toyota Research Institute, spoke on cloud robotics in IEEE/RAS International Conference on Humanoid Robotics 2010. It describes \\"a new approach to robotics that takes advantage of the Internet as a resource for massively parallel computation and sharing of vast data resources.\\" * Ryan Hickman, a Google Product Manager, led an internal volunteer effort in 2010 to connect robots with the Google's cloud services. This work was later expanded to include open source ROS support and was demonstrated on stage by Ryan Hickman, Damon Kohler, Brian Gerkey, and Ken Conley at Google I/O 2011. * National Robotics Initiative of US announced in 2011 aimed to explore how robots can enhance the work of humans rather than replacing them. It claims that next generation of robots are more aware than oblivious, more social than solitary. * NRI Workshop on Cloud Robotics: Challenges and Opportunities- February 2013. * A Roadmap for U.S. Robotics From Internet to Robotics 2013 Edition- by Georgia Institute of Technology, Carnegie Mellon University Robotics Technology Consortium, University of Pennsylvania, University of Southern California, Stanford University, University of California‚ÄìBerkeley, University of Washington, Massachusetts Institute of TechnologyUS and Robotics OA US.

Life Map of the Arab‚ÄìByzantine frontier zone in the 8th‚Äì10th centuries Rustam was appointed to the post of governor of Tarsus and of the Cilician border zone (ath-thughur ash-Shamiya) with the Byzantine Empire on 20 August 905. In this capacity he supervised a prisoner exchange with the Byzantines on the Lamos River soon after. The exchange had already been arranged by his predecessor, Abu'l-Asa'ir Ahmad ibn Nasr, and began on 27 September, but was interrupted after four days after only about 1,200 Arab prisoners had been exchanged, with the Arabs blaming the Byzantines for violating the truce terms. In late October 906, he accompanied the general Ahmad ibn Kayghalagh in an invasion of Byzantine territory. The Abbasid army captured the town of Salandu (Selinus) and advanced even up to the Halys River, where they met and defeated a Byzantine force, capturing 5,000 prisoners according to al-Tabari. At about this time (ca. 905/907), he concluded a written treaty with the Byzantine envoy Leo Choirosphaktes, according to which the two sides would continue fighting for two more years but conclude a truce and carry out a prisoner exchange on the third. When the Byzantine general Andronikos Doukas, falling victim to the machinations of the eunuch Samonas and facing charges of insubordination against emperor Leo VI the Wise, sought refuge in the fortress of Kabala, the emperor sent the general Gregoras Iberitzes to convince Andronikos and his relatives and followers to surrender, but the latter sought the aid of the Arabs of Tarsus. Rustam left Tarsus in February/March 907 with his troops. He reached Kabala, bringing back both Andronikos and his son Constantine Doukas to Arab territory, and torched Iconium on his way. In summer 908, Rustam supervised another prisoner exchange at the Lamos River, with ca. 2,800‚Äì3,000 Muslim men and women ransomed. He is last mentioned in 911/2, when, alongside the Byzantine renegade Damian of Tarsus, he led an unsuccessful siege of the stronghold of the Armenian military leader Melias, who had entered Byzantine service in the borderlands. Eventually, the two Muslim commanders broke off the siege and instead raided the suburbs of the fortress of Kyzistra. He was succeeded in 912/3 by Bishr al-Afshini.

With construction dating to the late 1780s, the main house exemplifies the evolution of a frontier property. It is also significant as the birthplace of financier John A. Poor (1808-1871) and financial analyst Henry Varnum Poor (1812-1905), the latter of whom was responsible for its transformation into a summer estate in the late 19th century. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Description and history The main portion of the Merrill-Poor House is a large 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, resting on a granite foundation, with a hip roof and a large central chimney. This structure was built between 1788 and 1792 by Ezekiel Merrill, a veteran of the American Revolutionary War who had been granted the land for his service. The main facade is a five-bay center-entry configuration typical of the period, although it has been embellished with a Queen Anne portico. Merrill's construction originally had symmetrically placed twin chimneys; the change to a central chimney was part of the 1890s alterations. Ezekiel Merrill's daughter Mary married Sylvanus Poor, and this couple inherited his property. Their children included Henry Varnum Poor (1812-1905), who started a firm that continues today as part of Standard and Poors, and John A. Poor (1808-1871), a lawyer and businessman who was instrumental in the development of the railroad in Maine, particularly the Grand Trunk Railway. Henry purchased the family homestead from relatives in 1890, and transformed the property into a summer estate, working in consultation with architect Edward Clarke Cabot and landscape designer Frederick Law Olmsted. Cabot's alterations to the main house included creation of a large dining room running the width of the rear of the house, and the construction of a maze of bedrooms in the second story, as well as the relocation of a service ell. The largest addition, however, was the construction of a great hall in 1896, a massive two-story structure built on the site of the old barn.

After showing some promise when winning one of her four starts as a two-year-old in 2002, she emerged as one of the best North American fillies of her generation in the following summer with wins in the Kentucky Oaks and the Acorn Stakes. She also finished second in the Test Stakes and the Beldame Stakes before being retired at the end of the season with a record of four wins in twelve races. Background Bird Town is a bay mare bred in Kentucky by her owner Marylou Whitney, the widow of Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney. She was from the first crop of foals sired by Cape Town, whose five wins included the 1998 Florida Derby. His other progeny have included the Monmouth Oaks winner Capeside Lady and the Lone Star Derby winner Southern Africa. Bird Town's dam Dear Birdie won two minor races but became a very successful broodmare, producing several other winners including the Belmont Stakes winner Birdstone. Whitney sent her filly into training with Nick Zito. Racing career =2002: two-year-old season= Bird Town began her track career at Keeneland on October 9 in a maiden race over seven furlongs in which she was ridden by Pat Day and finished second of the eleven runners behind Star of Atticus. A month later she was again partnered by Day when she was moved up in distance to contest a maiden over one and one sixteenth miles at Churchill Downs. Starting favourite against ten opponents, she took the lead from the start and won by six and three quarter lengths from Throne. Two weeks later over the same course and distance, she started the 0.4/1 favorite for an allowance race, but was beaten three quarters of a length by In Case of Wind. Bird Stone ended her first season, by traveling to Florids for the Three Rings Stakes at Calder Race Course. Ridden by Eibar Coa, she started the 1.4/1 favorite, but after contesting the early lead she weakened in the closing stages and finished third, beaten three quarters of a length and a neck by Dakota Light and Never Fail. =2003: three-year-old season= Bird Town remained in Florida in early 2003, running twice at Gulfstream Park. In an allowance race on January 16 the filly was ridden by Day led into the straight before finishing second, beaten a neck by the Shug McGaughey-trained favorite Yell. On February 23 Bird Town, ridden by Coa, was moved down in the distance for the seven furlong Charon Stakes and won by twelve and a half lengths from Crafty Brat, after taking the lead on the penultimate turn. The filly prepared for the Kentucky Oaks with a run in the Grade II Beaumont Stakes over seven furlongs at Keeneland on April 10. Ridden by Coa, she started the 3.3/1 second favorite and contested the lead from the start before finishing second, one and a quarter lengths behind the winner My Boston Gal. On 2 May, Bird Town was one of twelve fillies to contest the 129th running of the Kentucky Oaks in front of a 100,523 crowd at Churchill Downs in which she was ridden for the first time by Edgar Prado. Her opponents included My Boston Gal, Yell and In Case of Wind as well as Elloluv and Lady Tak, first and second in the Ashland Stakes and Santa Catarina (runner-up to Storm Flag Flying in the Frizette Stakes). Lady Tak started favorite ahead of Elloluv and My Boston Gal, with Bird Town being made an 18.2/1 outsider. Bird Town stumbled exiting the starting gate before being settled by Prado in eighth place on the outside. She turned into the stretch in sixth before making a sustained late run, taking the lead from Santa Catarina approaching the final furlong and going clear to win by three and a quarter lengths. Yell took third place ahead of Elloluv and My Boston Gal. After the race Zito said \\"What heart this filly has. She never runs a bad race. Consistency makes you great\\". Whitney, whose late husband had won the race four times between 1936 and 1975 said \\"I love my homebreds. We buy horses, too. But homebreds mean so much to me\\". On her next appearance Bird Town was matched against Lady Tak and the 2002 American Champion Two-Year-Old Filly Storm Flag Flying in the Grade I Acorn Stakes over one mile at Belmont Park on June 6. Starting at odds of 2.65/1 the filly was sent into the lead by Prado soon after the start and held off a sustained challenge form Lady Tak to win by a head, with the favored Storm Flag Flying finishing sixth of the seven runners. Bird Town dropped back to seven furlongs for the Grade I Test Stakes at Saratoga in July. Starting the 1.75/1 favorite she raced just behind the leaders but on this occasion proved no match for Lady Tak and finished second, beaten four and a half lengths by the winner. Three weeks later, the filly started second favorite for the Alabama Stakes over ten furlongs at the same track but failed to recover after being bumped in the early stages and finished fifth of the six runners behind Island Fashion. Zito was unable to account for the filly's poor run, saying \\"It just wasn't our day. She's been running all year, so who knows?\\" At Belmont on October 4, Bird Town was matched against older fillies and mares for the first time in the Grade I Beldame Stakes over nine furlongs. Ridden by Aaron Gryder, she took the lead soon after the start and set the pace before being overtaken on the final turn by the favored Sightseek and finished second, four and a half lengths behind the older filly. Despite her defeat, Zito praised his filly saying \\"I can't be more thrilled... I don't care what anybody tells me, Bird Town is the best three-year-old filly right now. We put up a good fight and that's all I cared about.\\" Her retirement was announced three days later. Assessment and awards In the Eclipse Awards for 2003, Bird Town was named American Champion Three-Year-Old Filly beating the French-trained Six Perfections by 96 votes to 94. Breeding record Bird Town was retired from racing to become a broodmare at her owner's stud farm. She has produced the following foals: *Elusive Bird, 2006 bay filly by Elusive Quality.

The purpose of regularization is to enforce conditions, for example sparsity or smoothness, that can produce stable predictive functions. For example, in the more common vector framework, Tikhonov regularization optimizes over : \\\\min_x \\\\Ax - y\\\\^2 + \\\\lambda \\\\x\\\\^2 to find a vector x that is a stable solution to the regression problem. When the system is described by a matrix rather than a vector, this problem can be written as : \\\\min_X \\\\AX - Y\\\\^2 + \\\\lambda \\\\X\\\\^2, where the vector norm enforcing a regularization penalty on x has been extended to a matrix norm on X. Matrix regularization has applications in matrix completion, multivariate regression, and multi-task learning. Ideas of feature and group selection can also be extended to matrices, and these can be generalized to the nonparametric case of multiple kernel learning.  Basic definition  Consider a matrix W to be learned from a set of examples, S=(X_i^t,y_i^t), where i goes from 1 to n, and t goes from 1 to T. Let each input matrix X_i be \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{DT}, and let W be of size D \\\\times T. A general model for the output y can be posed as : y_i^t = \\\\langle W, X_i^t \\\\rangle_F, where the inner product is the Frobenius inner product. For different applications the matrices X_i will have different forms, but for each of these the optimization problem to infer W can be written as : \\\\min_{W \\\\in \\\\mathcal{H}} E(W) + R(W), where E defines the empirical error for a given W, and R(W) is a matrix regularization penalty. The function R(W) is typically chosen to be convex and is often selected to enforce sparsity (using \\\\ell^1-norms) and/or smoothness (using \\\\ell^2-norms). Finally, W is in the space of matrices \\\\mathcal{H} with Frobenius inner product \\\\langle \\\\dots \\\\rangle_F.  General applications  = Matrix completion = In the problem of matrix completion, the matrix X_i^t takes the form : X_i^t = e_t \\\\otimes e_i', where (e_t)_t and (e_i')_i are the canonical basis in \\\\mathbb{R}^T and \\\\mathbb{R}^D. In this case the role of the Frobenius inner product is to select individual elements w_i^t from the matrix W. Thus, the output y is a sampling of entries from the matrix W. The problem of reconstructing W from a small set of sampled entries is possible only under certain restrictions on the matrix, and these restrictions can be enforced by a regularization function. For example, it might be assumed that W is low-rank, in which case the regularization penalty can take the form of a nuclear norm. : R(W) = \\\\lambda \\\\W\\\\_* = \\\\lambda \\\\sum \\\\sigma_i, where \\\\sigma_i, with i from 1 to \\\\min D, T, are the singular values of W. = Multivariate regression = Models used in multivariate regression are parameterized by a matrix of coefficients. In the Frobenius inner product above, each matrix X is : X_i^t=e_t\\\\otimes x_i \\\\, such that the output of the inner product is the dot product of one row of the input with one column of the coefficient matrix. The familiar form of such models is : Y=XW+b \\\\, Many of the vector norms used in single variable regression can be extended to the multivariate case. One example is the squared Frobenius norm, which can be viewed as an \\\\ell^2-norm acting either entrywise, or on the singular values of the matrix: : R(W)=\\\\lambda \\\\W\\\\_F^2=\\\\lambda \\\\sum\\\\sum w_{ij}^2=\\\\lambda \\\\operatorname{Tr}(W^*W)=\\\\lambda \\\\sum \\\\sigma_i^2. In the multivariate case the effect of regularizing with the Frobenius norm is the same as the vector case; very complex models will have larger norms, and, thus, will be penalized more. = Multi-task learning = The setup for multi-task learning is almost the same as the setup for multivariate regression. The primary difference is that the input variables are also indexed by task (columns of Y). The representation with the Frobenius inner product is then : X_i^t=e_t\\\\otimes x_i^t. The role of matrix regularization in this setting can be the same as in multivariate regression, but matrix norms can also be used to couple learning problems across tasks. In particular, note that for the optimization problem : \\\\min_W \\\\XW-Y\\\\_2^2 + \\\\lambda \\\\W\\\\_2^2 the solutions corresponding to each column of Y are decoupled. That is, the same solution can be found by solving the joint problem, or by solving an isolated regression problem for each column. The problems can be coupled by adding an additional regulatization penalty on the covariance of solutions : \\\\min_{W,\\\\Omega} \\\\XW-Y\\\\_2^2 + \\\\lambda_1 \\\\W\\\\_2^2 + \\\\lambda_2 \\\\operatorname{Tr}(W^T \\\\Omega^{-1} W) where \\\\Omega models the relationship between tasks. This scheme can be used to both enforce similarity of solutions across tasks, and to learn the specific structure of task similarity by alternating between optimizations of W and \\\\Omega. When the relationship between tasks is known to lie on a graph, the Laplacian matrix of the graph can be used to couple the learning problems.  Spectral regularization  Regularization by spectral filtering has been used to find stable solutions to problems such as those discussed above by addressing ill-posed matrix inversions (see for example Filter function for Tikhonov regularization). In many cases the regularization function acts on the input (or kernel) to ensure a bounded inverse by eliminating small singular values, but it can also be useful to have spectral norms that act on the matrix that is to be learned. There are a number of matrix norms that act on the singular values of the matrix. Frequently used examples include the Schatten p-norms, with p = 1 or 2\\\\. For example, matrix regularization with a Schatten 1-norm, also called the nuclear norm, can be used to enforce sparsity in the spectrum of a matrix. This has been used in the context of matrix completion when the matrix in question is believed to have a restricted rank. In this case the optimization problem becomes: : \\\\min \\\\W\\\\_* subject to W_{i,j}=Y_{ij}. Spectral Regularization is also used to enforce a reduced rank coefficient matrix in multivariate regression. In this setting, a reduced rank coefficient matrix can be found by keeping just the top n singular values, but this can be extended to keep any reduced set of singular values and vectors.  Structured sparsity  Sparse optimization has become the focus of much research interest as a way to find solutions that depend on a small number of variables (see e.g. the Lasso method). In principle, entry-wise sparsity can be enforced by penalizing the entry-wise \\\\ell^0-norm of the matrix, but the \\\\ell^0-norm is not convex. In practice this can be implemented by convex relaxation to the \\\\ell^1-norm. While entry-wise regularization with an \\\\ell^1-norm will find solutions with a small number of nonzero elements, applying an \\\\ell^1-norm to different groups of variables can enforce structure in the sparsity of solutions. The most straightforward example of structured sparsity uses the \\\\ell_{p,q} norm with p=2 and q=1: : \\\\W\\\\_{2,1}=\\\\sum \\\\w_i\\\\_2. For example, the \\\\ell_{2,1} norm is used in multi-task learning to group features across tasks, such that all the elements in a given row of the coefficient matrix can be forced to zero as a group. The grouping effect is achieved by taking the \\\\ell^2-norm of each row, and then taking the total penalty to be the sum of these row-wise norms. This regularization results in rows that will tend to be all zeros, or dense. The same type of regularization can be used to enforce sparsity column-wise by taking the \\\\ell^2-norms of each column. More generally, the \\\\ell_{2,1} norm can be applied to arbitrary groups of variables: : R(W)=\\\\lambda \\\\sum_g^G \\\\sqrt{\\\\sum_j^{G_g} w_g^j^2}=\\\\lambda \\\\sum_g^G \\\\w_g\\\\_g where the index g is across groups of variables, and G_g indicates the cardinality of group g. Algorithms for solving these group sparsity problems extend the more well-known Lasso and group Lasso methods by allowing overlapping groups, for example, and have been implemented via matching pursuit: and proximal gradient methods. By writing the proximal gradient with respect to a given coefficient, w_g^i, it can be seen that this norm enforces a group-wise soft threshold : \\\\operatorname{prox}_{\\\\lambda,R_g}(w_g)^i=\\\\left(w_g^i-\\\\lambda \\\\frac{w_g^i}{\\\\w_g\\\\_g}\\\\right)\\\\mathbf{1}_{\\\\w_g\\\\_g\\\\geq \\\\lambda}. where \\\\mathbf{1}_{\\\\w_g\\\\_g\\\\geq \\\\lambda} is the indicator function for group norms \\\\geq \\\\lambda. Thus, using \\\\ell_{2,1} norms it is straightforward to enforce structure in the sparsity of a matrix either row-wise, column-wise, or in arbitrary blocks. By enforcing group norms on blocks in multivariate or multi- task regression, for example, it is possible to find groups of input and output variables, such that defined subsets of output variables (columns in the matrix Y) will depend on the same sparse set of input variables.  Multiple kernel selection  The ideas of structured sparsity and feature selection can be extended to the nonparametric case of multiple kernel learning. This can be useful when there are multiple types of input data (color and texture, for example) with different appropriate kernels for each, or when the appropriate kernel is unknown. If there are two kernels, for example, with feature maps A and B that lie in corresponding reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces \\\\mathcal{H_A},\\\\mathcal{H_B}, then a larger space, \\\\mathcal{H_D}, can be created as the sum of two spaces: : \\\\mathcal{H_D}: f=h+h'; h\\\\in \\\\mathcal{H_A}, h'\\\\in \\\\mathcal{H_B} assuming linear independence in A and B. In this case the \\\\ell_{2,1}-norm is again the sum of norms: : \\\\f\\\\_{\\\\mathcal{H_D},1}=\\\\h\\\\_{\\\\mathcal{H_A}}+\\\\h'\\\\_{\\\\mathcal{H_B}} Thus, by choosing a matrix regularization function as this type of norm, it is possible to find a solution that is sparse in terms of which kernels are used, but dense in the coefficient of each used kernel. Multiple kernel learning can also be used as a form of nonlinear variable selection, or as a model aggregation technique (e.g. by taking the sum of squared norms and relaxing sparsity constraints). For example, each kernel can be taken to be the Gaussian kernel with a different width.

Settlements in Greifensee date back to 4000 BC. In 1975, the Neolithic stilt house village located on the northern lakeshore area called B√∂schen was discovered by recreational divers. Initially, they found ceramics, lavishly decorated pots and bowls, and simple, large food tanks. In scientific dives, the remains of a village with 24 huts have been revealed. The excellent condition of the timber relicts allows dendrochronological dating to the year 1051 BC.

Geography  Ferdinand Keller The former site around 1500 AD Located on the then-swampland between Limmat and Lake Zurich around Sechsel√§utzenplatz on small islands and peninsulas in Z√ºrich, the settlements were set on piles to protect against occasional flooding by the Linth and Jona Rivers. Because the lake has grown in size over time, most of the original piles are now around to under the water level of , giving modern observers the false impression that they always had been underwater.

It was neighbored by the settlements at Kleiner Hafner and Grosser Hafner on a then peninsula respectively island in the effluence of the Limmat, within an area of about in the city of Z√ºrich.  Description  Alpenquai in the city of Z√ºrich is one of the most important Late Bronze Age lakeside settlements in Central Europe; its huge size and its almost uninterrupted occupation from 1050 BC to 800 BC, rich imports, and the excellent state of preservation of the layers with unique organic finds and architectural elements, mark it as a cultural heritage site of worldwide importance. In addition, the final phase dates from the transition to the Iron Age, a period otherwise rarely found.  Finds  La T√®ne ceramics from the Lindenhof oppidum On the occasion of construction works, investigation conducted by probes and probing ditches occurred in 1970. Despite the dredging for the construction of the Seequai between 1916 and 1919, an amazingly big area of approximately with two cultural layers was preserved. Both, the upper and the lower cultural layer, were separated by an about cm thick layer of lake marl composed of several layers of different materials. There were found pile shoes at different altitudes in the cultural layers and rich bar decoration of ceramics occurred exclusively in the lower layer, while the decoration on cannelure groups was limited to the upper layer, as well as some graphite- decorated fragments. Potin coin of the Z√ºrich Type So-called Potin lumps, of which the largest weighs , were found at Alpenquai in 1890. They consist of a large number of fused Celtic coins, which are mixed with charcoal remnants. Some of the about 18,000 coins originate from Eastern Gaul, while others are of the Z√ºrich type, that were assigned to the local Helvetii, and date to around 100 BC. The find is so far unique, and the scientific research assumes that the melting down of the lumps was not completed, and therefore the aim was to form cultic offerings. The site of the find was at that time at least from the lake shore, and probably to deep in the water.Keltisches Geld in Z√ºrich: Der spektakul√§re ¬´Potinklumpen¬ª.

Since 2010 there is being produced a hybrid version, and from 2013, there is a purely electric version. It has a length of 12.0 metres, replacing the Neoplan N4016. History =Solaris Urbino 12= Solaris Urbino 12 Solaris Urbino 12 series were the first of the new series of Solaris 12.0 metre buses. It is the most popular model series in the history of the brand. Urbino 12 debuted in mid-1999 during an International Trade Fair. Since the turn of 2001-2002 the series produced its second generation. Since 2005 the series had produced the third generation of the bus. During the Transexpo Trade Fair in 2008 in Kielce the new prototype for the Solaris Urbino series was branded as the New Edition Generation 3.5\\". The structure for the fourth generation uses the same one like that of the third generation of buses. The refurbished interior has more lighting located behind the green overhead panels. The panel extends for the entire length of the bus roof in the central part of the bus. Another innovative solution was to hide the engine compartment with first passengers of the bus. Solaris Urbino 12 series buses are produced in diesel versions (which meet the standard for Euro VI). Since 2005, there is a variety of LPG CNG. The most sold with diesel engines are from DAF Trucks. Less frequently used sold were MAN engines. They have been used mainly to 2004, and again for a short period from 2006, but due to the policy of the company to only supply vehicles only tailored for CNG. Alternatively, the manufacturer began to use the Cummins ISBe4 250B type diesel engines with the standard Euro IV and ISBe5 250B in Euro V. The Urbino 12 LE buses are produced for low-entry suburban variety with diesel, CNG or biogas power. Graphic symbol of Solaris Urbino 12 model is green dachshund, placed on most buses, always on the front wall on the right side of the vehicle. With the introduction of the third-generation models the look of the graphic symbol has been slightly modified. =Solaris Urbino 12 Hybrid= Solaris Urbino 12 Hybrid In the second half of 2009, a prototype Solaris Urbino 12 Hybrid based on third generation of Solaris Urbino 12 was built. The model made its debut at the Busworld Trade Fair in Kortrijk in October 2009. The series production began in 2010. The Solaris Urbino 12 Hybrid uses a parallel hybrid system HDU made by the American company Eaton. It comprises inter alia with a 6-speed Eaton automatic gearbox and one electric motor with maximum power of 44 kW (60 hp). In normal traffic movement the power is on about 28 kW (38 hp). It operates with a Cummins ISB6.7EV 225B diesel engine, meeting the requirements of the EEV standard, with a maximum power of 165 kW (225 hp) and the volume of 6.7 dm. The Eaton gearbox transmits power to the rear axle. All batteries are lithium-ion (Li-Ion) made by the Japanese company Hitachi which have been placed under the platforms inside the vehicle. By this the appearance of the bus has changed and the look is different when compared with the traditional diesel engine powered buses. The cost of this system is about 70 thousand Euros. The graphic symbol of the Solaris Urbino 12 Hybrid buses is a green dachshund with two overlapping hearts symbolising the dual drive system. =Solaris Urbino 12 √ú= Solaris Urbino 12 √ú Solaris Urbino 12 √ú buses are typically used for urban and interurban commuter public transportation services, the model made its debut at the IAA Nutzfahrzeuge Trade Fair in Hannover in September 2012. Instead of the classic box shaped look, the front and whole look has a bow shape. The mainly used MAN D2066 LUH 48 engine has a capacity of 10.5 dm3 and a maximum power of 265 kW (360 hp) and which works with the automatic transmission Voith DIWA.5 or ZF EcoLife. The front axle is independently suspended ZF RL 75 EC, and the drive axle is ZF AV 132. The number of seats increased to 44, located on the sides. Options include a Webasto Spheros air conditioning system. =Solaris Urbino 12 electric= Solaris Urbino 12 electric At the IAA Nutzfahrzeuge Fair Trade in Hannover in September 2012 the new Solaris Urbino 12 electric was shown which debuted as electric prototype from the Solaris Urbino 12 family. In the third quarter of 2013, the bus was manufactured and was delivered to the Braunschweiger Verkehrs-AG company, in Braunschweig, Germany. This was done as part of a program to research and implement new technology into public transportation services, the project was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Transport. The prototype bus was equipped with an innovative system of Bombardier PRIMOVE, allowing inductive charging without connecting cables. The drive system uses an electric drive system by Vossloh Kiepe GmbH made in D√ºsseldorf. The motor was centrally mounted by 4 poles with the asynchronous motor which has a maximum power output of 160 kW (1400 Nm) and allows the use of standard axles: ZF AV 132, and the independently sprung axle ZF RL 75 EC. Energy recovered during braking is stored in the lithium-ion batteries with a capacity of 210 kWh. The vehicle is also equipped with a plug-in connector that allows you to connect additional to an external energy source. All devices in the vehicle, which are usually powered by a diesel engine have been electrified. The air conditioning system has a built-Konvekta UL500EM CO2 heat pump, which is also used for heating the vehicle. . Trademark symbol Green Dachshund. The trademark symbol for the Urbino bus series is a green dachshund. Different versions of buses have symbols with different details. Dachshund hybrid models have two hearts symbolising a dual drive system, and ecological models in EEV version have a dachshund holding a flower in its mouth. The dachshunds on part of the models sold to Krak√≥w wear a rogatywka.

It has been held by the Tate Gallery since 1946, acquired through The Art Fund. Painter William Holman Hunt was a British painter, who co-founded the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood (1848), along with Dante Gabriel Rossetti and John Everett Millais. The Pre- Raphaelite Brotherhood advocated a return to spirituality and sincerity of the arts, despising academic painting, which they considered a mere repetition of clich√©s.Despite these beliefs, the group created a number of works for institutes of higher learning in England. Under the Victorian era (1837‚Äì1901) the conservative academic aspect was represented by the Royal Academy. Among the more radical options was the movement Arts and Crafts, led by William Morris. William Holman Hunt was somewhere in the middle. Although he studied at the Royal Academy of Arts, he rejected the style imposed by its founder Sir Joshua Reynolds. Painting After Holman Hunt's painting The Hireling Shepherd was acquired by William Broderip, this work was commissioned by Broderip's cousin, Charles Theobald Maud, as reproduction of the sheep in the background. Maud was persuaded to accept a more adventurous composition. He worked en plein air at the location depicted between August and December 1852, despite cold and rainy weather. The painting combines features from different vantage points, with butterflies added in the studio modelled from life.Our English Coasts, 1852 (‚ÄòStrayed Sheep‚Äô), Tate Gallery The painting depicts a flock of sheep lining the picturesque coast of Sussex. The scenic location painted rests on the cliffs at Fairlight Glen, beside Covehust Bay near Hastings, called the Lovers' Seat. The painting is painted in many layers, with brilliant colours, as many of Hunt's paintings are painted. It was exhibited at the Royal Academy summer exhibition in 1853 under the title Our English Coasts, but the frame bore the inscription \\"The Lost Sheep\\", and it was renamed Strayed Sheep when it was exhibited at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1855. It was acquired by the Tate Gallery in 1946, through The Art Fund. On 30 July 2019, after the British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson visited Wales, cartoonist Steve Bell parodied the painting in The Guardian newspaper.

In South America, it occurs on bushes and rocks in Chile; reported from Colchaqua (Valley) and Santiago Spjut, R. W. 1996. Niebla and Vermilacinia (Ramalinaceae) from California and Baja California. Sida The epithet is in regard to absence of the black transverse bands often seen in other species such as V. leopardina, V. tigrina and V. zebrina. Distinguishing Features Vermilacinia leonis is classified in the subgenus Cylindricaria in which it is distinguished from related species by a flaccid to subflaccid thallus divided into numerous narrow cylindrical branches that produce soredia, powdery masses of green alga and white fungal cells that form in pincushion-like heads (capitate), also called soralia (soralium singular) because of their regular shape. The soredia erupt through a relatively thin cortex, 10‚Äì40 ¬µm thick. The soralia are round in outline, and less than the width of the branch, in contrast to soralia in the related V. cephalota and V. zebrina that have a diameter greater than the width of the branch. The lichen substances include the usual triterpene zeorin and diterpene (-)-16-hydroxykaurane with or without salazinic acid and other unknowns may be present that include a T3 compound that is generally recognized as characteristic of the genus, and probably bourgeanic acid. Two other sorediate species, described in the genus Niebla, one of which is similar to some forms of V. cephalota, was distinguished by dot-like (‚Äúpunctiform‚Äù) soralia that develop on terminal acicular branchlets; another has a flattened thallus similar to Ramalina lacera, but referred to Niebla by the presence of the depside methyl 3,5 dichlorolecanorate;Sipman, H.J.M. 2011. New and notable species of Enterographa, Niebla, and Sclerophyton s. lat. from coastal Chile. Bibliotheca Lichenologica 106: 297-308. however, it reportedly lacks pycnidia, generally present in all other species of Vermilacinia but not always in all thalli of a species (e.g., V. zebrina). Taxonomic History Vermilacinia leonis was described in 1996, but also perceived to be a synonym (taxonomy) under an extremely broad species and genus concept; one that essentially combines all species of Vermilacinia that grow on trees and shrubs, including two sorediate species, under one species name, Niebla ceruchis,Bowler, P. and J.

The genus Vermilacinia is distinguished from Niebla by the absence of chondroid strands in the medulla,Chondroid strands in the genus Niebla appear as tiny threads or cords running lengthwise in the medulla, interconnected diagonally or crosswise by other freely branched solitary hyphal cells. There are usually many such cords in the Niebla medulla. The medulla of Vermilacinia subgenus Cylindricaria has long flexible hyphal cells united at frequent intervals into knots. They are referred to as fascicles of hyphal cells. There are many such fascicles in a single medulla. It appears that when a thallus takes in moisture, the hyphal cells bend outwards, and as they dry they come together.

From left to right in the picture are Thomas, born 1740 and dressed in skirts as was typical for small boys until they were breeched, Henrietta, Anna Maria and Richard.Note the children are misidentified in Einberg's Manners & Morals, corrected in her Hogarth the Painter. Infant mortality in Britain was high in the eighteenth century, even for the children of the wealthy, and Thomas had died before the painting was completed. Hogarth used a study, probably completed after Thomas's death, as the basis for his image. With its numerous references to death and the passage of time, it may be that the painting is a form of memorial for Thomas.Postle, Martin. (2005) \\"The Age of Innocence: Child Portraiture in Georgian Art and Society\\", in Pictures of Innocence: Portraits of Children from Hogarth to Lawrence. Bath: Holburne Museum of Art, p. 73. The children are painted life size, surrounded by plush furnishings and fabrics that reflect the family's wealth. A gilded bird cage is suspended from a cord and Thomas sits in an ornate baby cart with a fine silver fruit bowl at his feet. Richard plays a tune on a bird-organ, apparently making the bird sing. The French Rococo was at its height in the 1730s and its influence can be seen in the painting despite Hogarth not visiting France until 1743.Einberg, Elizabeth. (1997) Hogarth the Painter.

The girl's aprons form serpentine S's, vertically in the oldest child, ending as it falls over her arm, and horizontally in the younger girl. A similar shape can be seen in the falling curtain on the right. The heads of the children and the cat create another noticeable S shape. The fruit bowl, a common subject in Rococo art, has been described as a \\"bravura piece of still-life painting\\" untypical of Hogarth's work. Study of Thomas Graham, William Hogarth, c. 1742. Black and red chalk on grey paper, British Museum, London. 22 x 27 cm. Themes David Bindman described The Graham Children as having a theme worthy of a history painting.Bindman, David. (1981) Hogarth. London: Thames & Hudson, p. 144. Hogarth turned what could have been a simple family scene, even one with a tragic edge, into a parable about the ‚Äúpassing of time and the vulnerability of innocence‚Äù. The picture plays with time with different parts moving at different speeds. The boys are captured in mid movement, like the cat and bird, while the girls seem to be completely still, so that the picture is both a snap shot of a fleeting moment and a static portrait simultaneously. The oldest, Henrietta, holds the wrist of the youngest, perhaps indicating her future role as a mother, but not tightly and neither exchange looks, but neither do any of the children. Henrietta, instead, looks at the spectator, indicating her awareness of the adult world that she will soon join. The other children, however, remain in the innocent bubble of childhood. Thomas is fascinated by the glistening cherries held by his sister, which in Christian iconography represent the fruit of Paradise and the antidote to original sin, and for Henrietta symbolise the challenges she will soon face as she enters adulthood. Anna Maria practices the dance steps and curtseys that will be required of her in society, and Richard enjoys the musical performance of the finch. His bird-organ bears an image of Orpheus from Greek mythology, referring to the temporary harmony of man and nature that cannot last.Einberg, Elizabeth. (1987) Manners & Morals: Hogarth and British Painting 1700‚Äì1760. London: Tate Gallery, p. 141. Lindsey, Jack. (1977) Hogarth: His Art and his World. London: Hart-Davis, MacGibbon, p. 118. On the clock stands a small winged figure with scythe and hour glass representing the passage of time, while the smiling cat eyes the caged bird, referring to the fragility of life. A wooden bird adorns the baby cart, like the caged bird unable to take flight. The crossed flowers at the baby's feet refer to the Christian legend that pink carnations sprang from the earth at the spot where Mary's tears fell after she saw Jesus carrying the cross, thus making the flower a symbol of motherly love. Hogarth included wit and pathos in the same scene by audaciously placing the predatory cat in one corner and the recently deceased child in the other. The reaction of Thomas's parents to this combination, which might have been seen as in poor taste, is unknown. The painting remained in Richard Graham's possession until at least 1816. =Details= File:Cat and bird, The Graham Children, Hogarth.jpgThe cat and its prey File:Orpheus The Graham Children, Hogarth.jpgOrpheus on the bird-organ File:Cupid with scythe The Graham Children.jpgTime with scythe and hourglass File:Still life, The Graham Children, Hogarth.jpgThe fruit basket File:Bird on the carriage, The Graham Children, Hogarth.jpgThe flightless bird on the baby cart Antecedents The Five Eldest Children of Charles I, Anthony van Dyck, 1637. Oil on canvas, Royal Collection, London. The Graham Children invited comparison with Anthony Van Dyck's The Five Eldest Children of Charles I (1637). Postle, p. 10. Both included animals for comic effect and took care to give each child an individual character. However, while Van Dyck (1599‚Äì1641) was commissioned by King Charles I to paint royalty, Hogarth's portraits were mainly of the rising middle class, and he never broke through to become a court painter. Unlike the children of Charles I, there is nothing aristocratic about The Graham Children, despite their affluence, and the allusion to the earlier work may have been a deliberate attempt by Hogarth to flatter his middle class client. Hogarth's paintings of children From around the 1730s, Hogarth developed a genre of playful conversation pieces far removed from the grand history paintings that he really wanted to produce but for which he had no commissions.Waterhouse, Ellis. (1994) Painting in Britain: 1530‚Äì1790. 5th edition. New Haven and London: Yale University Press, pp. 168‚Äì169. He was working against a background of what has been called a \\"new world\\" of childhood where the attitude to children was becoming more liberal. Family groups in painting became less formal and began to show parents and children enjoying recreational activities together. Portraits of individual children became more common than they had been in the seventeenth century and the idea of the \\"innocence\\" of childhood began to take root based on the view that the child was an uncorrupted blank slate as advocated by John Locke in his book Some Thoughts Concerning Education (1693).Postle, pp. 8 & 11.Plumb, J.H. \\"The New World of Children in Eighteenth-Century England\\", Past & Present, No. 67, May 1975, pp. 64‚Äì95. If the child was now innocent, however, the picture remained the product of a commercial transaction between the client and the artist and continued to fulfil a social function of demonstrating the happy family life and social status enjoyed by the customer. It also stood in a tradition of portrait painting of adults and children that had well established conventions.Postle, p. 9. In 1730, Hogarth had produced the \\"before and after\\" pair The House of Cards and The Tea Party where various minor mishaps occur relating to a house of cards and a doll's tea party. Numerous clues in both works suggest a more serious message about broken marriage hopes and loss but the full facts are not known.Description by Elizabeth Einberg in Postle, pp. 28‚Äì29. The Cholmondeley Family of 1732 also included similar ingredients of impending disaster as a playful child goes to push over a pile of books while the older generation sit by, frozen, to be reanimated when the books fall. But in this work it is the mother who is included despite having died prior. Well stocked bookcases line the background which the adults can use to civilise the wild children.Postle, pp. 12 & 30.

It displays an early blocking of the pre-Anglian Thames Valley, at a time when the River Thames followed a more northerly course, resulting in the formation of a lake. This was overrun by a second advance of ice during the Anglian glaciation around 450,000 years ago, which diverted the Thames to its present course and initiated Colne drainage in the area.

Yukos‚Äô claim in the ECHR argued that the company's rights, protected by the European Convention on Human Rights, were violated in Russian courts, which led to its bankruptcy and liquidation; it also argued that Yukos has been singled out for discriminatory treatment. Yukos officials complained that their rights were breached under several articles of the Convention, specifically: > ‚ÄúUnder Article 6 (right to a fair trial) of the Convention, the applicant > company complains about various defects in the proceedings concerning its > tax liability for the year 2000. Under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 > (protection of property), taken alone and in conjunction with Articles 1 > (obligation to respect human rights), 13 (right to an effective remedy), 14 > (prohibition of discrimination) and 18 (limitation on use of restrictions on > rights) of the Convention, it complains about the lawfulness and > proportionality of the 2000‚Äì2003 Tax Assessments and their subsequent > enforcement, including the forced sale of OAO Yuganskneftegaz. Lastly, the > applicant company complains, under Article 7 (no punishment without law) of > the Convention, about the lack of proper legal basis, selective and > arbitrary prosecution and the imposition of double penalties in the Tax > Assessment proceedings for the years 2000‚Äì2003.‚Äù Following an admissibility assessment that took five years, the court declared the Yukos application admissible on 29 January 2009. The Court declares admissible only less than 5% of all submitted applications. Proceedings The hearing on merits of the Yukos Oil Company v Russia case in the European Court of Human Rights took place on 4 March 2010. Yukos Oil Company was represented by Piers Gardner, Barrister of Monckton Chambers. The Russian side was represented by a team of lawyers, which included Georgy Matyushkin, Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights, and British lawyer Michael Swainston. The claim before the ECHR amounted to US$98 billion ‚Äì as majority shareholders did in the arbitration case before the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague ‚Äì but later reduced the claim.\\"Moscow ordered to pay Yukos shareholders ‚Ç¨1.9bn\\", by Neil Buckley, Financial Times, July 31, 2014. This was the largest claim to be brought in the court's history. The claim was an estimate of what the value of Yukos would have been if its assets had not been stripped away and the company had not been liquidated in 2007. The decision was announced on September 20, 2011. The court announced that the Russian state violated the human rights of Yukos by agreeing there had been a violation of Yukos' right to fairness in legal proceedings in relation to a tax re-assessment for 2000. The court also established that there had been a violation of the right to protection of property through enforcement proceedings carried out over tax assessments from 2000 to 2003. The interpretation of the tax liabilities which were applied to Yukos was foreseeable, but the court still noted that the crux of the case was the rapid and inflexible enforcement of those liabilities. Yukos had been effectively paralysed because all of its assets were frozen from the first assessment. The court held that two factors in particular contributed to Yukos' demise and violated Article 1 of Protocol No. 1: '1. The bailiff's choice of Yukos' principal subsidiary as the first target for auction, without considering the implications for the company's future: this dealt Yukos a 'fatal blow';'' 2\\\\. The Russian authorities were unyielding and inflexible in response to requests for time to pay and the bailiffs imposed additional fines amounting to ‚Ç¨1.15 Bn, which had to be paid before the taxes, but the payment of which was prohibited under the freezing orders.\\" The court did however note that the tax assessments themselves were not considered disproportionate. It was agreed that there was not enough evidence to suggest that Yukos had been treated differently from other companies and so no violation of Article 14 was found. The court denied an allegation that Russia misused legal procedures to dismantle Yukos despite the court's nine-judge panel finding that Russia violated three articles of the European Convention on Human Rights. Both sides claimed victory over the ruling. No monetary amount was awarded after the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) found the question of damages as \\"not ready for decision\\". Both parties subsequently had three months to reach a settlement. The ECHR ruling became final on March 8, 2012 when the ECHR Grand Chamber did not accept the request of the Yukos Oil company to have its application to the court referred to the Grand Chamber. The ECHR invited a claim for 'just satisfaction', or compensation, from Yukos, which sought compensation of just under 38 billion euros. These damages were being sought on behalf of all Yukos shareholders. There are around 55,000 named Yukos shareholders, some of which are funds representing a number of shareholders. On July 31, 2014, the ECHR awarded shareholders and their heirs ‚Ç¨1.87 billion ($2.6 billion), finding Russia failed to strike a \\"fair balance\\" in its treatment of Yukos Oil Company. The ECHR also ruled Russia should pay 300,000 euros in costs and expenses, plus any tax. The award fell well short of the ‚Ç¨37.98 billion in damages Yukos had asked for. It was also significantly less than the $50 billion in damages that its former majority owners were awarded by a tribunal at the Permanent Court of Arbitration earlier that same week.Gabriele Steinhauser and Gregory L.

(formerly Group Menatep), the former owner of 60 percent of Yukos, filed a lawsuit under the Energy Charter Treaty before a tribunal at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague. The Permanent Court of Arbitration handled the following cases: * Hulley Enterprises Limited (Cyprus) v. The Russian Federation * Yukos Universal Limited (Isle of Man) v. The Russian Federation * Veteran Petroleum Limited (Cyprus) v. The Russian Federation The Energy Charter Treaty aims to promote international investment and co-operation in the energy industry, and to stimulate foreign direct investment and global trade, in part by reassuring potential international investors that their investment will receive fair treatment. GML drew on two main provisions for its case - :* The treaty does not prevent governments from seizing or nationalizing commercial assets. However it requires that the investors must be fairly compensated if their assets are unfairly seized. :* Investors may seek arbitration for such claims against signatory governments, and rulings are legally binding and enforceable for both parties (subject to any appeal). Although Russia did not ultimately ratify the full treaty, these clauses were still agreed as legally binding for a number of years, as part of the draft framework. European investments in Russian energy projects that took place before Russia agreed to leave the treaty still fall under the treaty's provision of protecting investments.Nikita Jolkver and Markian Ostaptschuk, \\"Ex-Yukos owners demand compensation from Russia\\", Deutsche Welle, July 28, 2014.

L√º Chen Chung is best known for his 30-year endeavor translating the Bible to a Chinese language version. Early life and education L√º was born in Nan'an county of Southern Fujian, China. In 1906, due to a plague that ravaged in China, he and his two cousins were orphaned when he was eight. With full support from British Presbyterian missionary Alan S. Moore Anderson, the three orphans enrolled into Pei Yuan Middle School in Quanzhou, which Anderson had established in 1904. With exceptional results from his studies, L√º received scholarship to study at University of Hong Kong in 1916 and graduated with a bachelor of arts degree in 1921. He went back to his alma mater, Pei Yuan Middle School to teach for one year and married his wife Huang Luo Qi () then. In 1922, he went to Yenching University (a.k.a. Yanjing University) to read Theology and graduated in 1925. While he was in Yenching, he also studied Hebrew and Greek, which allowed him to be an effective Hebrew Bible translator later in life. Career Upon graduating from Yenching in 1925, L√º returned to Fujian and took up the vice-principal position at in Gulangyu, Xiamen. During his 14-year tenure, he taught prospective pastors and research the original text of the Bible when needed. In 1939, with the backdrop of the Second Sino-Japanese War and increasing frequency of conflicts in Xiamen, traffic between Xiamen mainland and the Gulangyu International Settlement was restricted. During this tumultuous times, L√º received a revelation and was inspired to start translating the Bible. In 1940, L√º went to back to his alma mater, Yenching University with his family to start the translation work. Additionally, he took up teaching Greek language in the university. When the university closed its doors between 1941 and 1945 due to the war, L√º and his family was hosted by Philippe de Vargas in Beiping, and L√º continued his translation efforts. L√º returned to Yenching in autumn of 1945 when it reopened after the surrender of Japanese occupation forces. In 1946, the initial edition of his New Testament translation was published by Yenching University with 500 copies in circulation. L√º encouraged criticism and suggestions to be delivered to him at the university in his foreword so that he could revise the translation further. To further his understanding of the Bible and his translation efforts, he enrolled into Union Theological Seminary in New York in 1946 and later at Westminster College in England. He was ordained in 1948. He returned to Beiping in autumn of 1948 to continue his translation efforts. However, he developed a severe case of asthma and could not tolerate the cold winter there. He and Huang returned back to Fujian and temporarily worked at Fukien Christian University.

In recognition of his translation efforts, he received an honorary Doctor of Divinity degree from Hong Kong University in 1973. = Bible translation sources = The first translation of New Testament which started in 1940, was translated from Alexander Souter's New Testament: Oxford Greek Testament. For the 1970 translation of the Bible which was published in Hong Kong, the revised translation of the New Testament, was translated from the 17th edition of Eberhard Nestle's Novum Testamentum Graece, while the Old Testament relied on various texts such as the Masoretic Text. Personal life and demise L√º was married to Huang Luo Qi () in 1921. Huang was afflicted with Alzheimer's disease in 1975 and passed away in 1978 in Hong Kong.

He originated the concept of teaching about the care of the patient that would be applicable to all medical specialties.Reminiscences of Alfred Worcester 1938, http://thegardencottage.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/dr-alfred-worcester- reminiscences.pdf. Accessed November 7, 2014. Manuscripts preserved at the Harvard University Archives and the Francis A. Countway Library of Medicine He was an early adopter of appendectomy for appendicitis and of Caesarean section for complicated labor. He advocated for compassionate medical care and counseling for college students and was Harvard College's second Professor of Hygiene. He was a prolific writer and speaker and was deeply religious. He gave lectures and sermons across the United States and Canada. Because of his innovations, he was often involved in controversy. He suffered several life- threatening illnesses, including appendicitis, which informed his approach to patient care. Scientific medicine was on the rise while he advocated preserving humanistic medicine. Including practical experience in home care during nurses' training, which he organized at the Waltham Training School for Nurses, was frowned upon by hospital-based nursing school administrators of the day. APPENDECTOMY: In the 1880s, appendicitis was treated expectantly, by waiting for a walled-off abscess to form, with incision and drainage via anterior or posterior approach, and was often fatal. The innovation that Worcester adopted was to operate earlier and earlier in the course of the disease and to enter the peritoneum to do so. At first, this was by open lavage of the peritoneal cavity and removal of what was left of the ruptured appendix. Later, he found that he could usually operate before the appendix had ruptured, and prevent generalized peritonitis and abscess formation, and greatly reduce morbidity and mortality. The reports of his cases and the controversy between him and the surgeons of Boston demonstrate the evolution of medical and surgical practice and the contribution of generalists to specialty care.Worcester A.

Early life Arthur Algernon Capell was the son of Hon. John Thomas Capel and Lady Caroline Paget (eldest daughter of Henry Paget, 1st Earl of Uxbridge). He was the grandson of William Capell, 4th Earl of Essex from William's second marriage to Harriet Bladen. He was given the name of Arthur Algernon Capel at birth, but the spelling of the family name was legally changed by Royal Licence to Capell on 23 July 1880. Arthur Algernon Capell's half-uncle, George Capel- Coningsby, 5th Earl of Essex, died in 1839 without any heirs, and the succession of the title passed to Arthur. Arthur's father, John Thomas Capel, was the half-brother of the 5th Earl and the nearest male sibling. John Thomas had died in 1819 and so the title passed to Arthur upon George's death on 23 April 1839. He also held the titles of 6th Viscount Malden and 7th Baron Capell of Hadham. Career The game of Croquet, popularised by the 6th Earl of Essex Cassiobury House (1888), as it appeared during the 6th Earl's life St Mary's Parish Church, Watford The 6th Earl enjoyed a number of philanthropic and leisure pursuits and took a keen interest in a wide range of subjects. In the 1860s, he developed an enthusiasm for the new game of croquet. The gardens of Cassiobury House, the Capell family seat in Watford, Hertfordshire, was one of the first places in Britain in which croquet was played, and the Earl hosted lavish croquet parties there. A particular variant of the game was developed there, as detailed in Rules of the Eglinton Castle and Cassiobury Croquet, published in 1865 by Routledge, and the Earl even launched his own Cassiobury brand croquet set, made in his own sawmills in Watford. Capell took an interest in the practice of homoeopathy which was growing in popularity at the time. He supported the activities of the British Homeopathic Association and served as a Vice President of the London Homeopathic Hospital. Like many landowners of his time, the Earl also took an active interest in agriculture and developed a model farm, Home Farm, to the north of Cassiobury House.Rabbits & Priestly He was first president of the West Hertfordshire Agricultural Society, and in August 1864 he held first exhibition of the Watford and Leavesden Horticultural Society in the gardens at Cassiobury. He also held positions of Lay Rector of the Parish and president of the Watford and Bushey Volunteer Fire Brigade. The Earl also opened up the grounds of Cassiobury to the local residents of Watford, allowing the public free access to the park, on the condition that they did not hold picnics there (opening grounds to the public was now a common practice among landowners, such as at the parks of Arundel Castle, Hatfield House, Blenheim Palace and Alnwick Castle, all of continue to offer free access to local residents today). The park played host to cricket matches and parades of the Hertfordshire Yeomanry. The prime minister of the day, Sir Robert Peel, offered to the Earl the position of Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, an appointment he declined due to ill health. The 6th Earl was also an amateur painter, and a watercolour by Capell depicting the grand staircase at Cassiobury House now hangs in the Watford Museum. Personal life Capell married three times. His first marriage was on 14 July 1825 to Lady Caroline Janetta Beauclerk, daughter of William Beauclerk, 8th Duke of St Albans and Maria Janetta Nelthorpe. Before her death on 22 August 1862, they were the parents of: * Hon. Arthur de Vere Capell, Viscount Malden (1826‚Äì1879), who married Emma Martha Meux, third daughter of Sir Henry Meux, 1st Baronet, in 1853. * Lady Adela Caroline Harriet Capell (1828‚Äì1860), who married, as his second wife, Archibald Montgomerie, 13th Earl of Eglinton, in 1858. * Hon. Reginald Algernon Capel (1830‚Äì1906), who married Mary Eliza Fazakerley, daughter of John Nicholas Fazakerley of Burwood Park, in 1858. * Hon. Randolph Alfred Capell (1831‚Äì1857), a Lieutenant in the Royal Navy who died at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. After her death, he married Lady Louisa Caroline Elizabeth Boyle on 3 June 1863. Lady, the eldest daughter of Charles Boyle, Viscount Dungarvan and Lady Catherine St. Lawrence (eldest daughter of William St Lawrence, 2nd Earl of Howth), was the sister of Richard Boyle, 9th Earl of Cork. Her father was the eldest son and heir apparent of Edmund Boyle, 8th Earl of Cork. Before her death on 5 May 1876, they were the parents of two children: * Hon. Arthur Algernon Capell (1864‚Äì1940), who married Isabel Anne Wilson, a daughter of Col. Townshend Wilson, in 1890. * Lady Beatrice Mary Capell (1870‚Äì1954), who married Edmund Banbury, a son of Frederick Banbury of Shirley House and brother to Frederick Banbury, 1st Baron Banbury of Southam, in 1913. His third marriage was on 25 April 1881 to Louisa Elizabeth (n√©e Heneage) Paget, widow of Lord George Paget and daughter of Charles Fieschi Heneage and Hon. Louisa Elizabeth Graves (daughter of Thomas Graves, 2nd Baron Graves). They had no children and Louisa outlived Capell by 22 years. Arthur Algernon Capell died on 11 September 1892 at age 89. His eldest son, Arthur de Vere Capell, Viscount Malden, had died in 1879 aged 52 and so the Earl of Essex title passed to Arthur Algernon's grandson, George Capell. =Legacy= Photographic portraits of the 6th Earl are held in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery, London and the Library of Congress in the United States.

A super-proportional division is better than a proportional division, in which each partner is guaranteed to receive at least 1/n (V \\\\geq 1/n). However, in contrast to proportional division, a super-proportional division does not always exist. When all partners have exactly the same value functions, the best we can do is give each partner exactly 1/n. A necessary condition for the existence of a super- proportional division is, therefore, that not all partners have the same value measure. A surprising fact is that, when the valuations are additive and non- atomic, this condition is also sufficient. I.e., when there are at least two partners whose value function is even slightly different, then there is a super-proportional division in which all partners receive more than 1/n.  Conjecture  The existence of a super-proportional division was first conjectured as early as 1948: ::It may be stated incidentally that if there are two (or more) partners with different estimations, there exists a division giving to everybody more than his due part (Knaster); this fact disproves the common opinion that differences estimations make fair division difficult.  Existence proof  The first published proof to the existence of super- proportional division was as a corollary to the Dubins‚ÄìSpanier convexity theorem. This was a purely existential proof based on convexity arguments.  Protocol  A protocol for finding a super-proportional division was presented in 1986. = Single piece of disagreement = Let C be the entire cake. The protocol starts with a specific piece of cake, say X ‚äÜ C, which is valued differently by two partners. Call these partners Alice and Bob. Let a=VAlice(X) and b=VBob(X) and assume w.l.o.g. that b>a. = Two pieces of disagreement = Find a rational number between b and a, say p/q such that b > p/q > a. Ask Bob to divide X to p equal parts and divide C \\\\ X to q-p equal parts. By our assumptions, Bob values each piece of X as more than 1/q and each piece of C \\\\ X as less than 1/q. But for Alice, at least one piece of X (say, Y) must have a value of less than 1/q and at least one piece of C\\\\X (say, Z) must have a value of more than 1/q. So now we have two pieces, Y and Z, such that: :VBob(Y)>VBob(Z) :VAlice(Y)Alice(Z) = Super-proportional division for two partners = Let Alice and Bob divide the remainder C \\\\ Y \\\\ Z between them in a proportional manner (e.g. using divide and choose). Add Z to the piece of Alice and add Y to the piece of Bob. Now each partner thinks that his/her allocation is strictly better than the other allocation, so its value is strictly more than 1/2. = Super-proportional division for n partners = The extension of this protocol to n partners is based on Fink's \\"Lone Chooser\\" protocol. Suppose we already have a super-proportional division to i-1 partners (for i‚â•3). Now partner #i enters the party and we should give him a small piece from each of the first i-1 partners, such that the new division is still super-proportional. Consider e.g. partner #1. Let d be the difference between partner #1's current value and (1/(i-1)). Because the current division is super-proportional, we know that d>0. Choose a positive integer q such that: d > \\\\frac{1}{(i-1)i(q(i-1)-1)} Ask partner #1 to divide his share to qi-1 pieces which he considers of equal value and let the new partner choose the q pieces which he considers to be the most valuable. Partner #1 remains with a value of \\\\frac{(qi-1)-q}{qi-1} = \\\\frac{q(i-1)-1}{qi-1} of his previous value, which was \\\\frac{1}{i-1} + d (by definition of d). The first element becomes \\\\frac{q(i-1)-1}{(i-1)(qi-1)} and the d becomes \\\\frac{1}{i(i-1)(qi-1)}; summing them up gives that the new value is more than: \\\\frac{(qi-1)(i-1)}{(i-1)i(qi-1)} = \\\\frac{1}{i} of the entire cake. As for the new partner, after having taken q pieces from each of the first i-1 partners, his total value is at least: \\\\frac{q}{qi-1} > \\\\frac{1}{i} of the entire cake. This proves that the new division is also super-proportional.

It is the second-oldest quilt museum in the United States. It houses special and permanent exhibits, a library, a museum shop, and classrooms. Collections are strong in 19th century quilts, with a geographic focus on New England.Danilov, V. J. (2005). Women and museums: A comprehensive guide. Lanham, MD: AltaMira Press. History The museum opened in 1987, and was founded and staffed by quiltmakers. It has been since its start committed to both craft and fine arts quilts, with exhibits and classes incorporating contemporary as well as traditional fiber arts approaches. The museum moved into its current space in 1994, after a flood in its previous building. The new space, the historic Lowell Institute for Savings building, gave the museum more room for exhibits, collection storage and preparation, classrooms, a museum shop, and events. It is now part of the Lowell National Historical Park, which highlights Lowell's centrality to the 19th century textile trade and Industrial Revolution in the United States. Activities In 2000, the museum founded the Lowell Quilt Festival, which has expanded to involve multiple partners across the city and region. IMAGES, a top juried show that began in 1983, is also part of the festival; entries are from across the United States and Canada. The Lowell Quilt Festival was held for the last time in 2014. MassQuilts, a volunteer-led statewide project to document the history of quilts, holds sessions at the museum the second Thursday of every month. Please call the Museum to make an appointment. MassQuilts started in 1994, and has documented more than 7,000 quilts. Massachusetts, as an early colonial port, is important because fabrics from England and France were also incorporated into early quilts. MassQuilts has also developed traveling shows, exhibits for the museum, and Massachusetts Quilts, Our Common Wealth a university press book on the history of Massachusetts quilts, and exhibits for the museum.

It is commonly known as brown soft scale. It has a cosmopolitan distribution and feeds on many different host plants. It is an agricultural pest, particularly of citrus and commercial greenhouse crops. Description The adult female scale insect is oval and dome-shaped, about long. It retains its legs and antennae throughout its life. Its cuticle is made of chitin but it does not produce the copious quantities of wax that armoured scales do. It is a pale yellowish-brown or greenish-brown colour with brown irregular speckles, and darkens with age. Male brown soft scale insects are rarely found. Hosts The brown soft scale is polyphagous, meaning it feeds on many species of plants. It attacks a wide variety of crops, ornamental and greenhouse plants. In Hawaii, host plants include citrus, loquat, papaya, rubber trees and orchids. Biology The brown soft scale is ovoviviparous and produces young mostly by parthenogenesis. Over the course of her life, the female may produce up to 250 eggs, a few being laid each day. The eggs are retained inside the insect until they hatch, at which time small nymphs emerge and are brooded for a few hours before dispersing. These first-stage nymphs are known as crawlers and move a short distance from the mother before settling and starting to feed. They have piercing and sucking mouthparts and feed on the host plant's sap. They are largely sedentary for the rest of their lives and pass through two more nymphal stages before becoming adults. A generation takes about two months, and there may be three to seven generations in a year, depending on temperature. Males are occasionally produced and these pass through four nymphal stages before becoming winged adults. In order to obtain all the nutrients they need, the scale insects ingest large quantities of sap. They then secrete the excess sugary fluid as honeydew. This is attractive to ants which often tend the scale insects, driving away predators. The brown soft scale does not normally kill the host plant, but the loss of sap probably causes it to grow more slowly and crop less heavily. The main disadvantage to the host is the sooty mould which grows on the honeydew. This reduces the area of leaf available for photosynthesis, and spoils the appearance of the plant, its flowers and fruits. Control Traditionally, brown soft scale has been controlled by the use of pesticides, but these have the disadvantage that other insects, friends and foes alike, are also killed. Another approach in citrus is to eliminate ants from the trees, either by preventing the ants from climbing the trunks or by destroying their nests. This allows natural predators to flourish and keep the scale insects under control, although this may lead to a temporary increase in the production of sooty mould on the honeydew that the ants no longer collect. Fungicides can be used to prevent the sooty mould from taking hold. Alternatively, the use of such entomopathogenic fungi, such as Lecanicillium lecanii, has been successfully used in the laboratory. An alternative approach is integrated pest management in which the natural enemies of the scale insects are encouraged. A further possibility is the use of growth regulators such as the hormone hydroprene which disrupts the moulting of juvenile scale insects.

W. 1996. Niebla and Vermilacinia (Ramalinaceae) from California and Baja California. Sida The species is also reported to occur in Chile, based on a single specimen mounted on a large index card off to one corner with the type (biology) of Usnea tumidula (variant of V. ceruchis) in the center and bottom (plate 45.2 in Spjut 1996); it is possible that the specimen of V. leopardina was from North America and placed on the card for the purpose of making a comparison to the type for Usnea tumidula, which was annotated Ramalina ceruchis var. gracilior Muell.Arg., a name of uncertain status. The epithet, leopardina, is in reference to the black transverse bands and irregularly shaped black spots commonly seen on the thallus branches that obviously imply a similarity to the leopard animal, while also making comparative distinctions to other black banded species: V. tigrina and V. zebrina, obviously to a tiger and zebra, and to V. leonis, obviously a lion, which has no black stripes. Distinguishing Features Vermilacinia leopardina is classified in the subgenus Cylindricaria in which it is distinguished from related species by thallus divided into narrow tubular branches that often bear saucer shaped to slightly cup-shaped apothecia just below the apex; a short spine-like branch often extends from the apothecia. The branches often have irregularly shaped black spots and regularly shaped black transverse bands that appear to constrict the thallus branches where they develop. The bands are thought to be a fasciation of the pycnidia as a result of aborting development. This is contrast to the pycnidiaPycnidium (pycnidia plural) is a small flash-shaped structure (200‚Äì300 ¬µm wide near the base) that produces conidia, which escape through an opening (ostiole) at the top and function in reproduction, asexually or sexually in V. nylanderi that are abundantly produced but hardly conspicuous because they are immersed in the cortex but evident by the bump- like elevated area of the cortical surface; their abundance is conspicuous when the thallus is sectioned and examined under a microscope. Also, pycnidia in V. nylanderi are abundantly fertile; i.e., they produce what appear to be viable conidia (conidium singular), which ‚Äúare specialized, non-motile fungal spores,‚Äù that appear to function as re-establishing the lichen with an ‚Äúappropriate photobiont,‚Äù a form of asexual reproduction,Bungartz, F. 2002.

They differ more by the lichen substances. Vermilacinia tigrina‚Äîfirst described from thalli in South America that grew on soil on Cerro Moreno in the Antofagasta Province of Chile‚Äîwas distinguished by having the lichen substance psoromic acid,Follmann, G. 1966. Eine neue Ramalina-Art uas der Ceruches-Gruppe. Willdenowia 4(2): 225‚Äì233. which is a minor constituent to the terpenoid compounds, while it was also distinguished from other related species that produce methyl, 3,5 dichlorolecnorate (tumidulin). Subsequently, the species circumscription of V. tigrina was broadened to include thalli in North America that had additional lichens substances of depsidones‚Äîhypoprotocetraric acid, salazinic acid, nortstictic acid, or hypoprotocetraric acid‚Äîwhich a thallus may have anyone of the depsidones accessory to the terpenoid compounds zeorin and (-)-16-hydroxykaurane that are constantly present. Vermilacinia leopardina differs in being deficient in depsidones. Vermilacinia leopardina may appear to intergrade morphologically with V. corrugata;Rundel, P., P. A. Bowler and T. W. Mulroy. 1972. A fog-induced lichen community in northwestern Baja California, with two new species of Desmazieria. The Bryologist 75: 501‚Äì508, p.504, ‚Äútypical smooth, shiny and irregularly blackened thalli of D. ceruchis in central California intergrade into a larger lacunose form in Baja Califonirnia. Both morphologies are present at Bah√≠a de San Quint√≠n.‚Äù however, the species are easily distinguished by differences in the lichen terpenoid substances. On the northern half of the Baja California peninsula, Vermilacinia leopardina occurs nearer the ocean or where fog lingers more during the day, in contrast to V. corrugata, lacking (-)-16-hydroxykaurane, occurring where there is less moisture from fog, such as near the perimeter of the fog zone. Vermilacinia leopardina was described in 1996, but also has been perceived to be a synonym (taxonomy) under an extremely broad species and genus concept; one that essentially combines all species of Vermilacinia that grow on trees and shrubs, including two sorediate species, under one species name, Niebla ceruchis,Bowler, P. and J. Marsh. 2004. Niebla. ‚ÄòLichen Flora of the Greater Sonoran Desert' 2: 368‚Äì380 an epithet that is based on a type (biology) specimen for a species interpreted to grow on earth in South America, recognized as Vermilacinia ceruchis, one that is also endemic to South America.Spjut R.

Peine, eds., Koeltz Scientific Books: Koenigstein, pp. 337-351. The listing of seven different species names under ‚ÄúNiebla ceruchis‚Äù that includes V. leopardina, for example as one synonym (biology) of the seven synonyms does not mean that they are equal to N. ceruchis, as sometimes indicated on web sites and in literature,Enlichenment, ‚ÄúNiebla ceruchis‚Äù, three images, Palos Verdes Bluffs, Bluff Cove; top image shows thallus with lobes enlarged terminally, a characteristic feature of Vermilacinia cerebra, the lower two images show yellow green thalli with soralia, characteristic traits of Vermilacinia zebrina; these names are not synonymous as may be envisioned in the Lichen Flora of the Greater Sonoran Desert 2: 372 (2004), while one may also continue to debate whether they represent two different species, or just one species; accessed 6 December 2014; http://www.waysofenlichenment.net/lichens/Niebla%20ceruchis. especially when the listing of synonyms provide no scientific basis for reaching such a conclusion, and when the species already had been substantiated as distinct by their differences in morphology, chemistry, ecology, and geography. The genus Vermilacinia is distinguished from Niebla by the absence of chondroid strands in the medulla,Chondroid strands in the genus Niebla appear as tiny threads or cords running lengthwise in the medulla, interconnected diagonally or crosswise by other freely branched solitary hyphal cells. There are usually many such cords in the Niebla medulla. The medulla of Vermilacinia subgenus Cylindricaria has long flexible hyphal cells united at frequent intervals into knots. They are referred to as fascicles of hyphal cells. There are many such fascicles in a single medulla. It appears that when a thallus takes in moisture, the hyphal cells bend outwards, and as they dry they come together. Medulla hyphae in a herbarium specimen may lose elasticity over time, and all the fascicles may appear as a single cord and by the major lichen substance predominantly of terpenes.

In the twenty-one years since the first Magic: The Gathering World Championship, he is the only person to have won the competition more than once, winning the tournament in 2013 and 2014.  Magic: The Gathering  =Career= Introduced to Magic: The Gathering in 2007 at age 14, Shenhar quickly picked up the game at a competitive level, and played his first Pro Tour in 2011, Pro Tour Paris. A 38th-place finish qualified him for the next Pro Tour, and later that season, in San Diego, he reached the top eight of a Grand Prix event for the first time. He ended up winning the event, beating Richard Bland in the final. Less than six months later, at Grand Prix Salt Lake City, Shenhar won his second Grand Prix title. Thanks to his performances, he reached Platinum status in the Pro Players Club at the end of the 2011‚Äì12 season. In the 2012‚Äì13 season, Shahar posted his best Pro Tour finish to date, a 22nd-place finish at Pro Tour Gatecrash in Montreal. He made an additional two Grand Prix top eights, at Columbus and Verona, and was at the end of the season rewarded with an invitation to the 2013 World Championship, as well as the 2013 World Magic Cup as the captain of the Israeli national team. Despite being the youngest participant in the event, Shenhar made it all the way to the top four, where he defeated Ben Stark in the semifinal before facing Reid Duke in the final. Duke's Hexproof deck was considered a heavy favorite against Shenhar's Blue-White-Red Control deck. Duke took a 2‚Äì0 lead in the best-of- five match, but Shenhar won the next three games to win the match 3‚Äì2. As such, Shenhar was crowned the 2013 World Champion. At the World Magic Cup, Shenhar finished 16th with the Israeli team, losing to eventual champions France in the last round to miss the top eight. Though Shenhar's performances at the Pro Tour during the 2013‚Äì14 season were unspectacular, with his best finish being 74th place at Pro Tour Journey into Nyx in Atlanta, he did win his third Grand Prix event, Grand Prix Houston, and qualified for the 2014 World Championship as the reigning champion, as well as the 2014 World Magic Cup as the Israeli captain. Finishing 4th after the Swiss rounds, beating Shaun McLaren on tiebreakers, Shenhar advanced to the top four, where he faced the winner of the 2012 event, Yuuya Watanabe. A 3‚Äì1 winner, Shenhar then faced Hall of Famer Patrick Chapin in the final. Shenhar ended up defeating Chapin 3‚Äì0 to claim his second World Championship title. This made Shenhar both the first repeat winner and the first to win it in consecutive years. At the World Magic Cup, Israel again came close to a top eight finish, but lost to South Korea in the final round to finish 10th. Shenhar and his 2013‚Äì14 win were featured in the documentary Enter the Battlefield - Life on the Magic: The Gathering Pro Tour. Shenhar posted stellar results at the 2014‚Äì15 Pro Tours, finishing 22nd, 51st, 96th and 47th in consecutive events. However, a Pro Tour top eight still eluded him. Alongside teammates Tom Martell and Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa, Shenhar finished second at Grand Prix Nashville, and he also put up a fifth-place finish at Grand Prix Ottawa. As the World Champion, he was automatically granted Platinum status at the end of the season, but he would have had enough points even if this wasn't the case. Shahar is one of only four players to have reached Platinum status every season since the 2012 Professional Play changes, the others being Josh Utter-Leyton, Owen Turtenwald and Yuuya Watanabe.

It was designed by Gregory Mechonoshin and Cavanagh and Cavanagh and built from 1935 to 1950s by B Robinson. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The Russian Orthodox Cathedral of St Nicholas was erected in 1935-1936. It was the first purpose-built Russian Orthodox church in Australia, and one of the earlier parishes established in the post-1917 Russian Diaspora, yet its construction came comparatively late in the history of Russian emigration to Queensland. A trickle of Russian emigration to Queensland had been sustained through the 19th century, with numbers increasing substantially from the 1880s. These immigrants were popular with the Queensland government, assimilating rapidly. Most moved into rural occupations, and those who remained in Brisbane gained employment principally in the railways, meatworks and factories. By 1911, Russians comprised the fourth largest ethnic group in Brisbane, congregating in South Brisbane- Woolloongabba. Queensland's largest intake of Russian immigrants took place in the years 1911-1914. Many were radicals and revolutionaries seeking asylum from tsarist political repression in the final chaotic years of the Russian Empire; considerable numbers were Jews escaping state-inspired pogroms. They had fled Russia via Siberia and Northern China, most making their way to Harbin, in Manchuria, then taking passage from the port of Dalian to Townsville or Brisbane, the first Australian ports of call. Partly because they were scattered throughout the state, and partly because many pre-1920s immigrants associated Russian Orthodoxy with the tsarist system they were fleeing, no formal Russian Orthodox parish was established in Queensland during this period. Queensland's encouragement of Russian immigration ceased in 1918. During the First World War (1914‚Äì18) Australia was allied with Imperial Russia, and although the Russian Empire collapsed in March 1917, Australia, like most Western nations, supported the provisional government, in an attempt to keep Russia engaged in the war. Following the Bolshevik coup of October 1917 and Russia's withdrawal from the war, however, capitalist nations reversed their Russian policies, regarding the new Soviet regime with hostility. From mid-1918 to 1922, a period of violent civil war in Russia, almost all Russian immigration to Queensland was prohibited. With large numbers of White √©migr√© Russians (monarchists and anti-communists) fleeing the Soviet Union during this period and applying to emigrate to Australia, the Queensland Government was forced to relax its immigration restrictions. Along with this influx of White Russian emigres to Brisbane in the early 1920s, the city's first Russian Orthodox parish was established. Father Alexander Shabasheff, who had fled Russia via China, arrived in Brisbane in 1923, and through the assistance of Canon David John Garland of the Church of England, obtained the use of St Thomas' Church of England, at the corner of Grey Street and Fish Lane, South Brisbane, where Russian Orthodox immigrants could worship. From this beginning in 1923 a Russian Orthodox parish was created at South Brisbane in 1925, and in 1925-26 a cottage at 330 Vulture Street, Woolloongabba (site of the present cathedral) was purchased by the parish and converted into a church. In 1926, Father Shabasheff was appointed officially to the parish, by the Administration of the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad. In 1930, the parish was registered as St Nicholas Russian Orthodox Church. Most of the White Russian emigres who arrived in Brisbane in the 1920s had moved immediately to rural areas in search of work. By the mid-1930s, despite the depression, many had made sufficient money to enable them to return to Brisbane, where they were less isolated, and where Russian culture was sustained by the local emigre community. The construction of a purpose- designed Russian Orthodox church became a priority for Brisbane's Russian community. With the appointment in 1933 of Father Valentine Antonieff to the parish of St Nicholas, fund raising for a new church commenced. It was to be erected on the site of the existing church, and would be a memorial to the last Russian tsar, Nicholas II. Engineer and local parishioner Gregory Mechonoshin drew up a basic plan for the new church. This was approved by the parish council, who then commissioned architects Cavanagh and Cavanagh, of Brisbane and Perth, to prepare formal plans. Tenders were called in mid-1935, and the contract was let to builder B Robinson. Assistance in the technical construction of the cupola was given by another parishioner and engineer, Mr Golovznin. Construction commenced in 1935, and when finished (probably early in 1936), the building was consecrated with lesser rites by the local priest. On 4 October 1936, the church was consecrated with full rites by Greek Orthodox Archbishop Timotheos, there being no Russian Orthodox bishop yet appointed in Australia. The iconostasis (timber screen separating the sanctuary from the nave) and royal gates were constructed and decorated by local Russian immigrants. The movable icons and chandelier are of Russian or Chinese origin, and were donated by the widow of Father Tourchinsky. Interior fittings included a shrine to Tsar Nicholas II. The Maltese Cross on the front tower of the building was incorporated not for liturgical reasons, but because it formed part of the Queensland state emblem. The front fence, extant by May 1939, was constructed a few years after the new church was erected, replacing an earlier picket fence. The work was financed by Alexander Bardin, who had a cattle property near Roma, as a memorial to his wife and parents. It was constructed by local parishioner Michael Zakrjevsky. The Diocese of Australia was established in December 1946, with Bishop Theodore (Rafalsky) appointed as its head. At the time there were only two Russian Orthodox parishes in Australia, St Nicholas in Brisbane, established in 1925, and St Vladimir's in Sydney, established in 1938. As St Vladimir's Church was only a converted house, and St Nicholas Church had been purpose-built, Bishop Theodore was to be located in Brisbane. After immigration delays, the bishop finally arrived in Brisbane in late 1948, and consecrated St Nicholas Church at Woolloongabba as Australia's first Russian Orthodox Cathedral, on 5 November 1948. The seat of Russian Orthodoxy in Australia remained in Brisbane only a short time. In 1950, Bishop Theodore was appointed Archbishop of Australia and New Zealand, and relocated to Sydney, which was geographically more central to the diocese, and contained a larger post-Second World War Russian immigrant population than Brisbane. Several vicar bishops occupied the Brisbane bishopric between 1950 and 1976, but the position has remained vacant since. At some time after 1950, the building was extended at each side. The Russian Orthodox Cathedral of St Nicholas remains integral to the survival of Russian culture and religion in Brisbane, despite the more recent establishment of two other Russian Orthodox parishes: St Seraphim's at Woolloongabba (1950s) and a church at Rocklea (1960s). Services are conducted in the liturgical language, Church Slavonic, although every two months an English-language service is held as well, and for many years the church has maintained an important library of Russian works. A large part of Russian cultural identity in Brisbane remains bound with the traditions of Russian Orthodoxy and St Nicholas Cathedral.  Description  Spire, 2015 St Nicholas Russian Orthodox Cathedral is situated with its main face to Vulture Street, in a setting of tall mature trees. On the site which rises gently from Vulture Street, and flanked to each side and to the rear by high-set single storey timber buildings of domestic scale, the church building is the central, commanding building in the group. With its white finished walls resembling masonry, symmetrical facade and distinctive towers, the church stands quite tall and contributes significantly to the streetscape in this part of Vulture Street. In plan, the church is a simple rectangle, with a square attached tower over the front entry and an attached rectangular aisle at each long side. There are three symmetrically placed entry porches at the front Vulture Street facade, with roof forms and bargeboards shaped to the profile of a cupola and surmounted by ball and cross finials. A three-sided apse is centrally located at the rear. The square tower houses a choir space directly above the main entry, and a belfry above that, accessed by a series of simple timber ladders. Above the altar and centrally placed in the main roof is a smaller six-sided tower and cupola. Constructed on a rendered masonry base, the building is timber framed with a roughcast rendered fibro exterior, save for the western aisle which has been built in rendered masonry subsequent to 1950. The main roof is sheeted in corrugated galvanised iron, and the cupolas and tapering roof to the square tower are made up of flat and curved pieces of galvanised sheeting. Rendered masonry steps provide access to each of the three front entry doors, which have two leaves in a round-headed opening. A path runs from the central entry to a metal gate, centrally placed in a rendered masonry fence along the street frontage. This fence comprises pillars with incised crosses and ball finials, between which are masonry panels and steel tube and wire infill panels. The interior has a wooden floor and a ceiling which follows the line of the rafters, lined with fibro and VJ boards. In this building the simple geometric forms, crowned with cupolas and punctuated with tall round-headed windows, are an expression of the canon of Russian religious architecture that dates from Byzantium and that has been constructed here in response to local materials, time and place.  Heritage listing  St Nicholas Russian Orthodox Cathedral was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Russian Orthodox Cathedral of St Nicholas at Woolloongabba, erected 1935-36, was the first purpose-built Russian Orthodox church in Australia, and was consecrated in 1948 as the first Russian Orthodox cathedral in Australia. From St Nicholas Cathedral, the Russian Orthodox Diocese of Australia and New Zealand was administered from late 1948 to early 1950. The establishment of St Nicholas Russian Orthodox Church in Brisbane can be contextualised within the wider pattern of Russian emigration following the Bolshevik coup of 1917, and the establishment of the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad, and remains an important link between Queensland and the most significant political upheaval of the 20th century The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Its simple geometric forms, crowned with cupolas and punctuated with tall round-headed windows, and the interior arrangement of liturgical elements, including the iconostasis and royal gates, are an expression of the canon of Russian religious architecture that dates from Byzantium and that has been constructed here in response to local materials, time and place. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. With its distinctive towers, the church contributes significantly to the streetscape in this part of Vulture Street. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. St Nicholas Cathedral has had a close association with the maintenance of Russian cultural identity and tradition in both Brisbane and Queensland, and is important in illustrating the pluralism of 20th century Queensland/Brisbane society.

Polymer blends are typically described by coarse, unstable phase morphologies. This results in poor mechanical properties. Compatibilizing the system will make a more stable and better blended phase morphology by creating interactions between the two previously immiscible polymers. Not only does this enhance the mechanical properties of the blend, but it often yields properties that are generally not attainable in either single pure component. Block or graft copolymers as compatibilizing agents Block or graft copolymers are commonly used as compatibilizing agents. The copolymer used is made of the two components in the immiscible blend. The respective portions of the copolymer are able to interact with the two phases of the blend to make the phase morphology more stable. The increased stability is caused by reducing the size of the phase-separated particles in the blend. The size reduction comes from the lower interfacial tension, due to accumulating block copolymers at the many interfaces between the two copolymers. This helps the immiscible blends break up into smaller particles in the melt phase. In turn, these phase separated particles will not be as inclined to consolidate and grow because the interfacial tension is now much lower. This stabilizes the polymer blend to a usable product. An example of this are Ethylene/propylene copolymers. They are able to act as good compatibilizing agents for blends of polypropylene and low density polyethylene. In this specific application, longer ethylene sequences are preferred in the copolymer. This is because cocrystallization also factors into this case, and the longer ethylene sequences will retain some residual crystallinity. Reactive compatibilization Reactive compatibilization is a procedure in which immiscible polymer blends are compatibilized by creating copolymers in the solution or melt state. Copolymers are formed when the proper functional groups in each component of the immiscible blend interact in the compatibilization process. These interactions include hydrogen, ionic or covalent bonding. The functional groups that cause these interactions can be the end groups that are already present in the blend polymers (e.g., carboxylic acids or alcohols on polyesters, or amine groups on nylons). Another approach is to add functional groups to the component chains by grafting. The many possible functional groups allow for many types of commercial polymer blends, including polyamide/polyalkene blend systems. There are a number of advantages reactive compatibilization has over using the traditional block or graft copolymer as the compatibilizing agent. Unlike the latter approach, reactive compatibilization does not rely on diffusing pre- formed copolymers. Copolymers form at the interfaces of the two immiscible blends and do not need to be dispersed. In the traditional approach the system needs to be well mixed when adding the copolymers. Reactive compatibilization is also much more efficient than traditional compatibilization. This is because in reactive compatibilization, functional groups are either already present, or easily grafted on the blend components. In the traditional compatibilization, copolymers must be synthesized on a case by case basis for the components to blend.

Davis was born in Madison, Georgia. He and his family moved to Gary, Illinois, and then to Englewood, New Jersey, where he completed his high school education. Being musically gifted, he was accepted into the Juilliard School in New York to study piano and composition, his fees being paid by a benefactress. In the late 1930s or early 1940s he wrote the song \\"Lover Man (Oh, Where Can You Be?)\\" with Ram Ramirez but could not initially place it, until he offered it to Billie Holiday in 1942. Because of the 1942‚Äì44 musicians' strike Holiday didn't record the song until October 1944, and although at first only a minor hit it soon achieved widespread success and went on to become a jazz standard, recorded by numerous artists including Linda Ronstadt, Barbra Streisand and Petula Clark. During the early 1940s Davis struggled to make a living as a songwriter and supplemented his meagre royalties by giving piano lessons. He was drafted in 1942, but Davis, a member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), refused to be enlisted into a segregated regiment and demanded either exemption or service in the nonsegregated Canadian army. After a series of unsuccessful representations to the authorities, which drew press coverage and the support of several public figures, he decided not to report for duty and was imprisoned. His morale and health suffered in prison, as he revealed in letters to the writer and poet Langston Hughes (with whom he would maintain a 25-year correspondence until Hughes died in 1967), and he eventually relented and joined the army. In March 1945, Davis, then an officer attached to an army musical unit, was sent to France for six months, where he registered for a course on French language and culture open to American soldiers at the University of Paris. He wrote to Hughes that Paris \\"was exactly what the doctor ordered\\". Upon his return to the United States at the end of 1945 he was discharged from the army and left for Hollywood, where he joined the Actors' Laboratory Theatre, taking a course on acting. He tried to pursue a career in acting but was offered only stereotypical racial roles, and at the end of 1947 he emigrated to France. Davis was warmly welcomed in Paris, partly due to the fame of the song \\"Lover Man\\", and was described by the influential French critic and writer Boris Vian in Jazz Hot as \\"the youngest and most sympathetic of the American composers\\". He began to style himself Jimmy \\"Lover Man\\" Davis and entered a highly creative period, writing a number of songs and placing them with major French performers, such as Yves Montand (\\"J'ai de la veine\\"), Maurice Chevalier (\\"Trinque, trinque [√Ä la tienne]\\"), and Jos√©phine Baker (\\"You're the Greatest Love\\"). His songwriting royalties were still insufficient to live on, so he began singing his own songs in solo performances, touring through France, Italy, Holland, Spain, Switzerland and other countries. In 1957 he released an album, Jimmy \\"Loverman\\" Davis Chante Jimmy \\"Loverman\\" Davis, featuring songs all co-written by himself, backed by a quartet that included his friend and fellow expatriate Aaron Bridgers on piano and the French saxophonist Michel de Villers. Apart from his musical work, Davis appeared in plays, including Pas de week-end pour un espion and Des souris et des hommes (Of Mice and Men), and in the films La Putain respectueuse (1952, uncredited), M√©lodie en sous-sol (Any Number Can Win) (1962, as Sam), and Je t'aime moi non plus (1976, as Mo√Øse). Davis died in Paris in 1997. After a funeral service at the American Church in Paris, his ashes were interred in a cemetery in Auvergne.

As of November 2014, it is in phase III clinical trials. Cebranopadol is unique in its mechanism of action as an opioid, binding to and activating all four of the opioid receptors; it acts as a full agonist of the Œº-opioid receptor (Ki = 0.7 nM; EC50 = 1.2 nM; IA = 104%), and Œ¥-opioid receptor (Ki = 18 nM; EC50 = 110 nM; IA = 105%), and as a partial agonist of the nociceptin receptor (Ki = 0.9 nM; EC50 = 13.0 nM; = 89%) and Œ∫-opioid receptor (Ki = 2.6 nM; EC50 = 17 nM; IA = 67%). The EC50 values of 0.5‚Äì5.6 ¬µg/kg when introduced intravenously and 25.1 ¬µg/kg after oral administration. Cebranopadol shows highly potent and effective antinociceptive and antihypertensive effects in a variety of different animal models of pain. Notably, it has also been found to be more potent in models of chronic neuropathic pain than acute nociceptive pain compared to selective Œº-opioid receptor agonists. Relative to morphine, tolerance to the analgesic effects of cebranopadol has been found to be delayed (26 days versus 11 days for complete tolerance). In addition, unlike morphine, cebranopadol has not been found to affect motor coordination or reduce respiration in animals at doses in or over the dosage range for analgesia. As such, it may have improved and prolonged efficaciousness and greater tolerability in comparison to currently available opioid analgesics. As an agonist of the Œ∫-opioid receptor, cebranopadol may have the capacity to produce psychotomimetic effects, dysphoria, and other adverse reactions at sufficiently high doses, a property which could potentially limit its practical clinical dosage range, but would likely reduce the occurrence of patients taking more than their prescribed dose.

It originally aired on October 6, 2011. The episode was written by Brian Young and directed by Wendey Stanzler. Plot Stefan (Paul Wesley) and Klaus (Joseph Morgan) take Rebekah (Claire Holt) for shopping and when Stefan gets out of the store, he sees Katherine (Nina Dobrev). When he asks her what she is doing there, Katherine tells him that she knows the necklace Klaus is looking for, is the one that he gave to Elena. Stefan says that he will make sure Klaus will not find out about it. Liz (Marguerite MacIntyre) tells Damon (Ian Somerhalder) about Bill (Jack Coleman) and what he did to Caroline (Candice Accola) and that she wants him to erase his memory. They get to the basement, and when Damon makes sure that Bill does not have any more vervain in his system, he compels him to forget everything about Caroline being a vampire. Elena, Caroline and Bonnie (Kat Graham) are cooking for the Founder‚Äôs Party when Elena feels her necklace burning her. That is because Gloria (Charmin Lee) casts a spell trying to find out where the necklace is. When Bonnie tries to catch it, she feels the magic and she tries later to find out what is going on with it. She discovers that the necklace has its own magic while Gloria hides from Klaus what she felt when she was doing the spell and asks for more time. Stefan goes back later alone to check what Gloria really saw and she confesses that she heard three girls talking about him. She explains that the reason she did not tell Klaus is because she wants the necklace for herself and asks Stefan where is it. Stefan denies to tell her and she uses her magic to paralyze him and then torture him. Stefan does not talk but Gloria manages to see Elena through his mind and she finds out that she is the doppelganger who was supposed to be dead and that is why Klaus cannot make hybrids. As soon as she finds out, Katherine appears and kills her. Katherine asks Stefan what his plan is and why he stays with Klaus. He explains that in the ‚Äò20s, Klaus and Rebekah were running from someone they feared and he wants to know who. Katherine wants to help him find out but Stefan says he is alone on this and leaves. He returns to Klaus and tries to make Rebekah tell him who is after them but Rebekah realizes that something is not right and tells Klaus. Klaus decides to bring Stefan back to Mystic Falls to see what he is hiding. Jeremy (Steven R. McQueen) sees Anna (Malese Jow) who tells him that he should not help Vicki come back because everytime Vicki talks to him, she feels something bad. Later on, Bonnie asks his help to find out more about the necklace but as they start reading the old books something sets them on fire. Jeremy decides to talk to Bonnie about his visions who gets upset for not telling her sooner. At the Founder‚Äôs Party, Bill appears at the end of the council meeting and wants to take over the council. Damon‚Äôs compulsion seems like it did not work since Bill remembers everything. Damon tells that to Elena and Alaric informing them that he has to kill Bill. Both tell him not to do it but Damon breaks Alaric‚Äôs neck (after seeing him wearing his Gilbert ring) and leaves to kill Bill. Elena calls Caroline and tells her about it. Caroline fights with Damon and takes her father away to save him. Katherine returns to Mystic Falls. Pretending to be Elena, she manages to take the necklace from Bonnie and then goes to Damon offering him a road trip. Damon accepts despite not knowing where they will go. In the end, Klaus talks to Stefen about his suspicion that he was hiding something and he was determined to find out. Klaus proceeds to open the trucks garage to reveal that he had brought Stefen back to Mystic Falls.

It can be ignited in air or other gases in a wide range of pressures, including atmospheric. Due to the compactness and the efficiency of the piezoelectric transformer, this method of plasma generation is particularly compact, efficient and cheap. It enables a wide spectrum of industrial, medical and consumer applications.  Background  Cold non- equilibrium atmospheric-pressure plasmas can be produced by high voltage discharges in the atmospheres of various working gases. The following 3 types of electric discharges found most applications in industrial processes: * Electric arc discharges are self-sustaining DC discharges characterized by high electric currents, which are drawn from the cathode by intensive thermionic and field emission. Due to the intense currents, the volume of the arc reaches thermal equilibrium with temperatures of 6.000 ‚Äì 12.000 C. While the arc discharge can be sustained in the DC mode, a pulsed operation is more stable against imperfections of a quickly eroding cathode surface. * Corona discharges occur in the regions of high electric fields with high field gradients, present near sharp edges of high voltage electrodes. To prevent sparking, such electrodes should be far from the electric grounds. While corona discharges require rather high voltages, the emitted electric currents are low, resulting in a low discharge power. Although the DC operation is standard for the corona discharge, the AC operation increases its power. * Dielectric barrier discharge occurs between two electrodes separated by a dielectric when the electrodes are biased by a sine-wave or pulsed high voltage. The discharge current is sourced from the surface of the dielectric. The power of the dielectric barrier discharge is significantly higher than that of the corona discharge, but smaller comparing to the arc discharge. All these types of electric discharges require high voltage electronics and high voltage cabling. Those are bulky, expensive, and in the case of AC power can be very inefficient due to dielectric losses. Moreover, industrial applications often require high power of the order 1 kW. This imposes strict safety requirements on the high voltage enclosures with open electrodes. A construction based on multiple low-power high voltage modules might improve safety aspects. Likewise, incorporation of the high voltage generator and the discharge electrode into a single module should reduce dielectric losses in the cables. However, so far no cost-effective solution to the system based on low-power modules was found.  Principles of PDD  Piezoelectric direct discharge uses a piezoelectric transformer as a generator of AC high voltage. The high voltage side of this transformer acts as an electrode generating electric discharges in the air or other working gases producing atmospheric- pressure plasmas.M. Teschke and J. Engemann, Contrib. Plasma Phys. 49, 614 (2009)M. Teschke and J. Engemann, US020090122941A1, U.S. Patent application The piezoelectric transformer is very compact and requires only a source of a low power low voltage AC. This allows the whole plasma generator to be made exceptionally compact and cheap, enabling construction of hand-held plasma generators or cost-effective plasma generator arrays. Piezoelectric transformers of the Rosen type, which can be made of lead zirconate titanate, convert the electric energy in the form of low voltage AC into mechanical oscillations.C.A. Rosen, K.A. Fish, H.C.Rothenberg, U.S. Patent No. 2,830,274 (April 1958)C.A. Rosen, in Solid State Magnetic and Dielectric Devices, edited by H. W. Katz (John Wiley & Sons, Inc., London, 1959) pp. 170‚Äì197 Consequently, these mechanical oscillations produce high voltage AC at the other end of the transformer. The highest amplitude is achieved at mechanical resonances, which occur at the frequencies typically between 10 kHz and 500 kHz. The dimensions of the piezoelectric crystal define the resonance frequency, while its dielectric environment can cause small shifts of the resonance. The low voltage electronics continuously adjusts the frequency to keep the transformer operating within the resonance. At the resonance, such transformers offer very high voltage conversion factors up to 1000 with voltages of 5 ‚Äì 15 kV.  Properties of the plasma  Electric discharges produced in the gas from the high voltage side of the piezoelectric transformer have properties found also in the corona discharges and in the dielectric barrier discharges. While the former mode occurs when the high voltage side of the piezoelectric transformer is operated far from the electric grounds, the latter mode occurs when it is operated close to the electric grounds separated by a dielectric. Near the open electric grounds, the piezoelectric transformer produces periodic sparks. Transition to the electric arc does not occur because of the limited power of the transformer. The typical power of such transformers is of the order of 10 W. The efficiency of the plasma generation reaches 90%, while the remaining 10% of the power is lost due to mechanical heating of the piezoelectric transformer. Due to low electric currents, typical for the dielectric barrier and the corona discharges, the piezoelectric direct discharge produces a non-equilibrium plasma. This means that its constituent electrons, ions and the neutral gas particles have different kinetic energy distributions. Temperature of the neutral gas within the plasma volume remains lower than 50 C. At the same time, the electrons and the ions reach energies of 1 ‚Äì 10 eV. This is 300 ‚Äì 3000 times higher than the average energy of the neutral gas particles. The densities of the electrons and the ions reach 10‚àí16 ‚Äì 10‚àí14 m‚àí3. Since most of the plasma volume consists of the cold neutral gas, the plasma is cold. However, the very energetic electrons and ions excite atoms and molecules producing large amounts of short-lived chemical species, making this plasma chemically very active.  Applications  Properties of the piezoelectric direct discharge plasmas enable a large spectrum of applications in medical technology, microbiology and clinical research.A. Fridman, G. Friedman, \\"Plasma Medicine\\", Wiley; 1 edition (February 11, 2013) Typical industrial applications include ultra-fine cleaning and plasma activation of metal, ceramic, glass and plastic surfaces.

Punjabi kabaddi, also called circle style kabaddi,Debates; Official Report, Volume 23, Issues 1‚Äì11. Punjab (India). Legislature. Legislative Council is a contact sport that originated in the Punjab region, in the northern part of the Indian subcontinent. There are a number of traditional Punjabi kabaddi styles traditionally played in the Punjab region. Like standard kabaddi, circle style kabaddi is played at state and international levels, through various governing bodies such as Kabaddi World Cup (Circle style). Name The term kabaddi may be derived from the Punjabi word \\"kauddi\\" () which is chanted to play kabaddi or, it is derived from \\"katta\\" (calf) () and \\"vaddi\\" (to chopped) () which together has become kabaddi. Traditional Punjabi kabaddi styles =Lambi kauddi= In lambi kauddi (/‡®≤‡©∞‡®¨‡©Ä ‡®ï‡©å‡®°‡©Ä) there are 15 players with a circular pitch of 15‚Äì20 feet. There is no outer limit. The players can run as far they can. There is no referee. The raider will say \\"kauddi, kauddi\\" throughout the attack. =Saunchi kauddi= Saunchi kauddi (/‡®∏‡©å‡®Ç‡®ö‡©Ä ‡®ï‡©å‡®°‡©Ä)Punjab Diyan Virasiti Kheda by Suhdev Maudhupuri. Chetna Parkashan (also called Saunchi pakki/) can best be described as being similar to boxing. It is popular in the Malwa area of Punjab. It is unlimited players with a circular playing pitch. A bamboo with red cloth is dug into the ground which is paraded by the winner. In sauchi kabaddi, the raider will hit the defender but only on the chest. The defender will then hold the raiders wrist. A foul is declared if any other part of the body is grabbed. If the defender holds the raiders wrist and restricts his movement, he will be declared the winner. If the raider loses the grip of the defender, then the raider will be the winner. =Goongi kabaddi= A popular style is Goongi kabaddi (/‡®ó‡©Ç‡©∞‡®ó‡©Ä ‡®ï‡®¨‡©±‡®°‡©Ä) (silent kabaddi) where a raider player does not speak and say the word kabaddi but just touches the opponent's team player and the whom he touches only that player will try to stop the player. The struggle will continue till he reaches the starting line or acknowledge the defeat and loses a point, or if he safely reaches the starting line, he will get the point. =Other traditional styles= * Chhe handhi (); * Shamiali wali (); * Peer kauddi (); * Parh kauddi (); * Badhi (); * Baithvi (); * Burjia wali (); * Ghorh kabaddi (); * Daudhey (); * Cheervi (); * Chatta wali (); * Dhair kabaddi () popular in Majha area of Punjab; * Ambarsari (); * Ferozpuri (); * Lahori (); * Multani (); * Lyallpuri (); * Bahwalpuri (); and * Ambalvi ().Kissa Kabaddi da by Sarwan Singh Sangam Publications Punjab Circle style =History and development= Kabaddi is the regional sport of the Punjab region and was referred to as Punjabi kabaddi in India and Pakistan. However, with the formation of the states of Haryana and Punjab in India, the same game was referred to as Punjab kabaddi and Haryana kabaddi. This caused confusion and therefore, in 1978, the Amateur Circle Kabaddi Federation of India was formed and the syle of kabaddi played in the Punjab region was named circle kabaddi. Punjab circle kabaddi, also known as \\"diarey wali kabaddi\\" (/‡®¶‡®æ‡©≤‡®ø‡®∞‡©á ‡®µ‡®æ‡®≤‡©Ä ‡®ï‡®¨‡©±‡®°‡©Ä) incorporates the kabaddi styles of the Punjab region. =Rules= In the Punjab region, kabaddi is played on a circular pitch of a diameter of 22 meters and an inner circle with a line through the middle of the pitch: the pitch is called \\"kaudi da bharha\\". There are two teams of 8 players; one on one raid; and no player leaves the field. If 2 stoppers attack a player, a foul is declared. Punjab style kabaddi does not require the raider saying \\"kabaddi, kabaddi\\" throughout the raid. The game lasts for 40 minutes with a change in sides after 20 minutes. In the Punjab Circle Style form of Kabaddi, whenever any player is touched (out), he does not go out of the court, but stays inside, and one point is awarded to the team that touched him. This game is also played on a time basis, i.e. the time is 30 sec.

It was built from to 1920s. It is also known as Dr Wright's House. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 28 July 2000.  History  Sunnyside was constructed in the mid-1890s, on land owned by Joseph Thompson, a Sydney businessman who held substantial property assets on Kangaroo Point. The house functioned as a rental property until acquired by Dr Robert Wright, a Brisbane dentist, in 1920. The site was part of a larger parcel of land (3 acres 2 roods 39 perches) acquired in three allotments (1-3) by Thomas Adams, a North Brisbane solicitor, at the first sale of Brisbane suburban allotments at Kangaroo Point held in December 1843. The purchased blocks were on the western side of Main Street, extending from the road to the Brisbane River. Kangaroo Point at this period was emerging not only as Brisbane's first suburb, but also as a rival to South Brisbane, attracting industry (a boiling down works and wool store) and shipping. All of the 1843 allotments were located near the wharf reserve, and were offered at a premium upset price of ¬£5 per acre. Most had been cleared by 1837 as part of a former convict farm, but suburban allotments 1 and 2 were still covered in brush. Adams' land passed to a trustee in March 1846, and in March 1861 two of the subdivisions (suburban allotments 1 and 2 - comprising 2 acres 1 rood 33 perches) were conveyed to Sydney businessman Joseph Thompson. Thompson held this and (reputedly) other Kangaroo Point property, until his death in 1902, but did not reside there. He developed the eastern half of the site, fronting Main Street, with investment houses, including an 1860s duplex Silverwells and Sunnyside (1890s). From mid-1891 Thompson leased the western half of the land, with its river frontages, to the Australasian United Steam Navigation Company (initially held on a 25-year lease). The AUSN Co. established their workshops here and erected a wharf on the riverbank, directly opposite their Mary Street wharf, on the city side of the Brisbane River. From photographic evidence and Queensland Post Office Directories, it appears that the house known by 1904 as Sunnyside, and later as Dr Wright's House, was erected in the mid-1890s, possibly occupied by 1896. It is not known who designed the house, but the style and materials suggest perhaps a Sydney architect. By the late 19th century, Kangaroo Point, with its ferry access to the adjacent Brisbane central business district, had become a fashionable residential address, particularly with central city business persons. A number of substantial homes were erected here in the late 19th/early 20th centuries, including Leckhampton for Brisbane jeweller Charles Snow and Lamb House for Brisbane draper John Lamb. The construction of Sunnyside in the mid-1890s, so much later than the adjacent 1860s residence, illustrates the continued popularity of Kangaroo Point with middle class residents. From until , 255 Main Street was tenanted by Charles M Foster of Foster and Foster, ironmongers - Foster had moved here from Shafston House at Kangaroo Point, which he apparently still owned. The Schureck family occupied the house from to . Julius Schureck was an Adelaide Street retailer. Following Joseph Thompson's death at Woolloomooloo in Sydney in May 1902, his Kangaroo Point property passed to his son, civil engineer William Mann Thompson of Sydney. In 1920 WM Thompson subdivided and sold the property. Title to 255 Main Street (subdivision 3 of suburban allotments 1 & 2, par South Brisbane (38.3 perches)) was transferred from Thompson to Robert Wright, a Fortitude Valley dentist, in October 1920. Wright undertook some small alterations to the place, and erected a garage in the grounds. He may also have been responsible for the addition of the large pavilion room (originally perhaps a sleeping verandah) at the rear of the house. The house has remained in the Wright family since. Title was transferred from Robert Wright to Wright and his three surviving children (Robert James, Edgar David and Eveline Violet) in 1945. Following the death of Robert Wright in 1952, Robert James Wright (the eldest son, who had followed his father into dentistry) applied to the Brisbane City Council in 1957-58 to convert the house into two flats. It is understood he occupied one half of the house, and later his sister-in-law took the other. From 1964, title was held solely by Dr RJ Wright, who died in the early 1990s. RJ Wright was the Chilean Consul in Brisbane, possibly from just after the Second World War until his death. He resided most of his life at Sunnyside, which served as the Chilean Consulate in Brisbane for over 40 years. Sunnyside is once again a single home, currently occupied by a grand-niece of RJ Wright.  Description  Sunnyside is a substantial, single-storeyed masonry residence located in Main Street, Kangaroo Point, on a sloping block overlooking the Brisbane River and the Brisbane central business district. While the property does not extend to the riverbank, the house behind is at a much lower level and the land on the river bank below is now part of a Brisbane City Council-owned public park, hence the views of the city have not been built out. Immediately adjacent to Sunnyside on the south boundary is the heritage-listed Silverwells. The house is of face brick work, but only the north side wall remains unpainted. It has a rectangular core with a projecting gable with a decorative bay window in the front (eastern) elevation. There is a verandah across the remainder of the front facade and returning along the south side of the house. The verandah posts, aluminium \\"lace\\" valances, and tiled concrete verandah floors, are much later than the core. There is a formerly detached brick kitchen house at the rear, with a brick croft or cellar below, where the land slopes to the river. Also at the rear, opening off both the kitchen house and the core, is a large timber pavilion dating probably to the 1910s or 1920s, and since enclosed. The core, kitchen house and pavilion roof each has a separate, hipped roof of corrugated iron. The whole, including the timber extension, rests on brick piers. The interior has plastered masonry walls; high ceilings with decorative pressed metal panelling; well-detailed joinery (all now painted); and timber flooring (coated with a polyurethane finish). Many of the walls have been wallpapered (much appears to date from the 1960s or 1970s) and in some rooms paint has been applied over the wallpaper. The interior is that of a solid middle-class rental property, well-detailed, nicely finished, with generously- sized rooms and high ceilings, but without the ornate entrance vestibule common to more flamboyant owner-occupier, late 19th century residences. The front door opens directly into the main hallway, which runs east-west, off which are the former front parlour and dining room to the right. These rooms do not open into each other, but have back-to-back fireplaces which share a double chimney. The parlour has an early grey marble fireplace surround, but that in the dining room is a later and unsympathetic brick surround. A door in the rear (west) wall of the dining room opens onto a service passageway which leads to the kitchen house at the rear, and off which, to the right, are a small china pantry adjacent to the dining room, and a maid's room beyond this. The service passageway, which also runs east-west, leads to the now enclosed verandah which ran east-west beside the detached kitchen house. It is not clear whether a rear verandah initially ran the width (north-south) of the main building, but there is evidence of a former verandah between the maid's room in the core and the kitchen. This space has been enclosed as a bathroom; it has weatherboards externally on the north side and a s interior. Off the main hallway to the left are two bedrooms, but the doorways which once would have led from the hall into each bedroom have been bricked in and plastered (probably during the conversion to two flats), and there is no longer any evidence in the skirting boards of where these doorways were located. At its western end the main hallway opens into a cross-passage which leads on the right to the service passage and on the left originally to a bedroom door - this also has been bricked-in and plastered. In-filling the L-shape formed by the main building and the kitchen house is one large room which appears to have been a former semi-open pavilion. This extension is clad externally with wide weatherboards to sill height. Above the sill the weatherboards are narrower and likely to be later in-fill, and in this are several aluminium- framed windows which are understood to have replaced earlier casements. The narrow hardwood floorboards of this room are arranged in a pattern which reputedly mirrored the original lattice ceiling above, extant but now covered with a recent plaster ceiling. Opening into this room is an external entrance accessed from the south side verandah. The southern side of the house, the original bedroom wing, shows the greatest evidence of the alterations to form two flats. Access to the southern flat is now via the side entrance into the rear pavilion room. The third bedroom, formerly at the rear of the house, has been partitioned to form a bathroom, toilet and passageway leading from the pavilion room to the two front bedrooms, which are connected via an original doorway. In other words, the front bedroom can now only be accessed by passing through the second bedroom. The front bedroom has two step-out or telescopic windows opening onto the front verandah, and the second bedroom has a double sliding glass door of vintage opening onto the southern verandah, in the place of a former window. The single window to the third bedroom has been replaced by small, high windows to the bathroom and toilet. Another room, possibly a small fourth bedroom or servant's bedroom at the rear of the main building, has been converted into a kitchen. The wall between this room and the pavilion room (which currently functions as a combined dining and living room) has been almost totally removed, and it is no longer clear whether this room was accessed originally from a rear verandah, or from the cross or service passages in the middle of the house. Attached to the kitchen house at the rear is a single-storeyed, skillion-roofed extension with a brick north wall, but open on the south side. Beside this is a larger skillion-roofed, weatherboard- clad double garage, again, open on the south side. Both these structures have concrete flooring. A concreted driveway leads from the street along the southern side of the property to the garages at the rear. The front garden has an early path layout (extant by 1923) but s planting and garden elements, including a stone water fountain, stone-edged garden beds, concrete blockwork front fence, and perimeter bamboo planting which acts as a screen to Main Street and to neighbouring properties.  Heritage listing  Sunnyside was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 28 July 2000 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Sunnyside, Kangaroo Point, is important in illustrating the pattern of development of Kangaroo Point, Brisbane's first suburb, which from the 1850s attracted middle class residents who erected substantial homes overlooking the Brisbane River. The construction of Sunnyside in the 1890s illustrates the continued attraction of this quiet but centrally located suburb for the middle classes - a trend which was sustained into the 1920s. It is important also in illustrating the role of southern capital in developing Queensland from an early period. The place also has historical and social significance as the Chilean Consulate in Brisbane during the second half of the 20th century. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The place is significant as a rare, late 19th century, single-storeyed brick residence in Brisbane, of a design and materials more commonly found in Sydney at this period. The place also is now rare as one of few 19th century residences surviving in Kangaroo Point, which has undergone enormous change since the construction of the Story Bridge and viaduct in the 1930s, the expansion of the shipbuilding industry on the point from the 1940s to the 1960s, and rapid and substantial residential re-development since the 1980s. Sunnyside and an adjacent 1860s brick duplex Silverwells are the last remaining 19th century residences in the block between Bright and Scott Streets, and together with the nearby Story Bridge Hotel (erected ) make an important historical contribution to the character of Kangaroo Point. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places.

The battle involved a combined task force of South Vietnamese Marine and armored units that tried to gain a foothold at the Cua Viet Port just as the ceasefire was about to take effect on January 28 in accordance with the Paris Peace Accords. The South Vietnamese forces were finally forced to retreat by a North Vietnamese counterattack with considerable losses on both sides.Oral History Interview of Enemy Proselyting Department Colonel Luu Dinh Mien, 13 June 2007, Hanoi\\", Vietnam Interviews Project, retrieved on December 8, 2014. Background In late October 1972 as part of the counteroffensive to the Easter Offensive launched by the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN), the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) began attacks north of Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã to try to regain positions along the south bank of the Cam L·ªô/C·ª≠a Vi·ªát River. The attacks were met with stiff PAVN resistance and were stopped at the Th·∫°ch H√£n River. A further attack from the coast by the Vietnamese Marines in November made limited gains. By the end of 1972 the Marines and ARVN occupied positions 5 km south of the river. As the ongoing peace negotiations would soon lead to a ceasefire, the South Vietnamese Joint General Staff sought the most advantageous battlefield positions possible and so ordered a further effort to regain the south bank of the Cam L·ªô/C·ª≠a Vi·ªát River. Opposing forces Since March 1972, the C·ª≠a Vi·ªát base had been controlled by PAVN, particularly the 5th Regiment of the People's Navy of Vietnam. On 15 January 1973 planning began for a final assault on C·ª≠a Vi·ªát . A special combined unit called Task Force Tango was organized, consisting of the 3rd, 4th and 5th Marine Battalions and elements of the 1st Armored Brigade. The task force was put under the command of Colonel Nguyen Thanh Tri, Deputy Commander of the Republic of Vietnam Marine Division. Battle The operation began at 06:55 on 26 January with Task Force Tango advancing in two columns. Besides ARVN firepower, twelve B-52 bombers from the US Air Force and naval gunfire of the United States Seventh Fleet was used to soften the target and hinder PAVN reinforcements. The PAVN put up fierce resistance to the attack, destroying 26 M-48s and M-113s with AT-3 missiles and shooting down two Republic of Vietnam Air Force planes with SA-7 missiles. At 01:45 on 28 January the Marines made a final assault and by 07:00 had broken through the PAVN lines to recapture the base. At 08:00 in accordance with the Paris Peace Accords the ceasefire came into effect and the U.S. stopped all support for Task Force Tango. On the evening of 29 January, the PAVN launched a counterattack against Task Force Tango, and by the next day had succeeded in cutting off its lines of communication and began bombarding the encircled Marines. A Republic of Vietnam Navy LCM was destroyed as it tried to resupply the Marines. The Marines attempted to break out on the early morning of 31 January and the PAVN recaptured the base. Aftermath South Vietnamese losses were recorded as 40 casualties and 20 armored vehicles destroyed in the battle between 28‚Äì31 January.

The term is widely used in constructivist approaches to counseling psychology and psychotherapy,For example: ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; especially during bereavement in which people attribute some sort of meaning to an experienced death or loss.For example: ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; The term is also used in educational psychology.For example: ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; In a broader sense, meaning- making is the main research object of semiotics, biosemiotics, and other fields. Social meaning-making is the main research object of social semiotics and related disciplines.: \\"... the description of a community's communicative practices cannot adequately be accomplished within the confines of any single discipline in the human and social sciences. Such an enterprise is necessarily a transdisciplinary one, drawing on the insights of sociology, ethnology, linguistics, anthropology, social psychology, and so on, in order to develop a unified conceptual framework for talking about social meaning-making (Gumperz 1992).\\" History Viktor Frankl, author of Man's Search for Meaning Psychiatrist and holocaust survivor Viktor Frankl, founder of logotherapy in the 1940s, posited in his 1946 book Man's Search for Meaning that the primary motivation of a person is to discover meaning in life. Frankl insisted that meaning can be discovered under all circumstances, even in the most miserable experiences of loss and tragedy. He said that people could discover meaning through doing a deed, experiencing a value, and experiencing suffering. Although Frankl did not use the term \\"meaning-making\\", his emphasis on the making of meaning influenced later psychologists.A Google Scholar search for citations of Frankl's work shows that Man's Search for Meaning is cited by some of the most influential psychologists and psychotherapists of the 20th century; it is cited in Aaron T. Beck's Cognitive Therapy of Depression; Albert Ellis's New Guide to Rational Living; Richard S. Lazarus and Susan Folkman's Stress, Appraisal, and Coping; Carl Rogers's Freedom to Learn; and thousands of other texts. Neil Postman and Charles Weingartner, both of whom were educational critics and promoters of inquiry education, published a chapter called \\"Meaning Making\\" in their 1969 book Teaching as a Subversive Activity. In this chapter, they described why they preferred the term \\"meaning making\\" to any other metaphors for teaching and learning: By the end of the 1970s, the term \\"meaning-making\\" was used with increasing frequency,As can be seen in a Google Ngram of the term \\"meaning-making\\" in Google Ngram Viewer, usage of the term \\"meaning-making\\" in the Google Books database jumps just before 1980 and increases thereafter. especially in constructivist learning theory which posits that knowledge is something that is actively created by people as they experience new things and integrate new information with their current knowledge. Developmental psychologist Robert Kegan used the term \\"meaning-making\\" as a key concept in several widely cited texts on counseling and human development published in the late 1970s and early 1980s.For example: ; ; Kegan wrote: \\"Human being is meaning making. For the human, what evolving amounts to is the evolving of systems of meaning; the business of organisms is to organize, as Perry (1970) says.\\"; Kegan was referencing The term \\"meaning- making\\" has also been used by psychologists influenced by George Kelly's personal construct theory.For example: In a review of the meaning-making literature published in 2010, psychologist Crystal L. Park noted that there was a rich body of theory on meaning-making, but empirical research had not kept pace with theory development. In 2014, the first Congress on the Construction of Personal Meaning was held as part of the eighth Biennial International Meaning Conference convened by the International Network on Personal Meaning. Learning as meaning-making The term meaning-making has been used in constructivist educational psychology to refer to the personal epistemology that people create to help them to make sense of the influences, relationships and sources of knowledge in their world. For example, psychologist Robert Kegan developed a theoretical framework that posited five levels of meaning-making; each level describes a more advanced way of understanding experiences, and people may come to master each level as they develop psychologically. Similarly, according to the transformative learning theory of sociologist and educator Jack Mezirow, adults interpret the meaning of their experiences through a lens of deeply held assumptions.; When they experience something that contradicts or challenges their way of negotiating the world they have to go through the transformative process of evaluating their assumptions and processes of making meaning. Experiences that force individuals to engage in this critical self-reflection, or what Mezirow called \\"disorienting dilemmas\\", can be events such as loss, trauma, stressful life transitions or other interruptions. In bereavement With the experience of a death, people often have to create new meaning of their loss. Interventions that promote meaning-making may be beneficial to grievers, as some interventions have been found to improve both mental health and physical health.: \\"In their study of bereaved parents, Murphy et al. (2003) showed that finding meaning was related to lower mental distress, higher marital satisfaction, and better physical health. Similar links to better adjustment have been found in other samples of bereaved parents (Keesee et al., 2008) and adults who lost loved ones through violent means (i.e., accidents, homicide, and suicide; Currier, Holland, & Neimeyer, 2006).\\" However, according to some researchers, \\"for certain individuals from challenging backgrounds, efforts after meaning might not be psychologically healthy\\" when those efforts are \\"more similar to rumination than to resolution\\" of problems. Some researchers report that meaning-making can help people feel less distressed, and allows people to become more resilient in the face of loss.For example: ; ; On the converse, failing to attribute meaning to death leads to more long-term distress for some people. There are various strategies people can utilize for meaning-making; many of them are summarized in the book Techniques of Grief Therapy. One study developed a \\"Meaning of Loss Codebook\\" which clusters common meaning-making strategies into 30 categories. Amongst these meaning- making strategies, the most frequently used categories include: personal growth, family bonds, spirituality, valuing life, negative affect, impermanence, lifestyle changes, compassion, and release from suffering. =Family bonds= Individuals using existing family bonds for meaning-making have a \\"change in outlook and/or behavior towards family members\\". With this meaning-making strategy, individuals create meaning of loss through their interactions with family members, and make more efforts to spend more time with them. When individuals use family to give meaning to loss, more meaning- making strategies emerge within the family system. A couple of strategies that family members use to help each other cope are discussing the legacy of the deceased, and talking to non-family members about the loss. When family members are able to openly express their attitudes and beliefs, it can lead to a better well-being and less disagreement in the family. Meaning-making with one's family also increases marital satisfaction by reducing family tension, especially if the deceased was another family member. =Spirituality and religiosity= Meaning-making through spirituality and religiosity is significant because it helps individuals cope with their loss, as well as develop their own spiritual or religious beliefs. Spirituality and religiosity helps grievers think about a transcendental reality, share their worldview, and feel a sense of belonging to communities with shared beliefs. When individuals with a divinity worldview make meaning through spirituality and religiosity, those \\"individuals perceive the divine to be involved in a major stressful life event\\" and use the divine to develop a meaning for the loss. There are three main ways in which a theistic individual may create meaning through religion: benevolent religious reappraisals, punishing God reappraisals, and reappraisals of God's power. Benevolent religious reappraisals cast God in a positive light and grievers may see the death as a part of God's plan. Punishing God reappraisals cast God in a dark light and grievers may blame God for the loss or feel punished by God. Reappraisals of God's power questions God's ability to intervene on the situation. All of these appraisals contribute to how the griever may create meaning of their loss. Another meaning-making strategy people use is to create meaning by valuing their own life. People who create meaning in this way may try to cherish the life they have, try to find their purpose, or change their lifestyles. =Philanthropy= Grievers can make meaning of death through philanthropic services such as charities, foundations, and organizations. Meaning-making through philanthropy can create financial support, social support, emotional support, and helps create positive results from the negative experience of the death. For example, one couple that lost a child described how they developed \\"Nora's Project\\" after their daughter with a disability died, in order to help provide wheelchairs for children with disabilities around the world. The mother said: \\"With Nora's Project, I am also healing. I am able to turn something that was horrific, the way she died, into something that will do good in the world\\". Like this mother, it is common for individuals to want to create or do something positive for others. Philanthropy helps people make meaning by continuously and altruistically honoring a life while simultaneously helping others going through a similar experience.

Life Helmut Aris was the son of Julius Aris, a metal worker originally from East Prussia, and his wife Recha Aris, n√©e Stein. He was born in the Striesen district of Dresden in Saxony during the first decade of the twentieth century, a period of rapid industrialisation and social tensions. He attended the academically focused King George Gymnasium (a school in Dresden named after the local king) and then, in 1925, embarked on an apprenticeship on the commercial side of the textile business with a firm called \\"Hirsch & Co.\\", for whom he worked till 1929. He worked in the textile sector till 1938. Aris married Susanne Reinfeld in 1933. Two children were born to the couple, named Heinz-Joachim and Renate. In November 1938 Aris was arrested. This was a manifestation of the anti- Jewish policies of the Nazi Party which had taken power in January 1933. Helmut Aris was Jewish. However, his wife Susanne came from an Evangelical Christian family and for this reason he was, at this stage released. A period of unemployment followed, after which, between 1940 and 1945, Aris was placed under a forced labour regime in a succession of businesses. His father died in 1940 and his mother was deported to Riga where she was murdered in 1942. Helmut Aris was scheduled to be deported on 16 February 1945, but it was never carried out on account of the very heavy bombing to which the city was subjected that week by British and American bombers. In May 1945 World War II ended and his hometown of Dresden found itself in that part of what had been Germany that was now designated by the winning side as the Soviet occupation zone (SBZ). Membership of (non-Nazi) political parties was no longer illegal and Aris joined the newly formed Social Democratic Party (SPD). However, the Soviet Military Administration had a plan for what now began to mutate into the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). The plan involved a return to a one-party state, and in 1946 the SPD merged with the former Communist Party of Germany (KPD): members of both parties were invited, with a simple signature, to switch their party allegiance to the Socialist Unity Party (SED). In 1946 Helmut Aris joined the SED. Aris worked as CEO of a succession of industrial concerns from 1945, and till 1965 he also served as Executive Director at the Dresden-based Institute for the Chemical Industry businesses. In the immediate post-war years Aris worked to rebuild what remained of the Jewish community and in 1953 he became a member of the Central Saxony Community Leadership council in succession to Leon L√∂wenkopf, the Union of Persecutees of the Nazi Regime (VVN) founder who had been imprisoned since 1950 (following a denunciation) and fled to the west in 1953. Aris was also elected to leadership of the Dresden Community Leadership in succession to Hans Ogrodek who had fled East Germany. It was reported that following the vast scale of the state mandated killings and deportations there were only 5,000 Jews remaining in what was becoming East Germany, of whom perhaps 10% were active in the communities. In 1952 Aris was a co-founder of the Association of Jewish Communities in the German Democratic Republic. He became the association's vice-president in 1958 and in 1962 he succeeded Hermann Baden as president of the Association of Jewish Communities in the German Democratic Republic. From March 1954 to July 1956 he is listed in the Stasi records among the country's thousands of Informal collaborators (IM) under the code name \\"IM Lanus\\", but he later denied having provided reports to the Security Services on Jewish Community members. Between 1962 and 1987 Aris was a member of the presidium for the National Council of the National Front which was an alliance of minor political parties and mass movements that were represented on a quota basis in the National Assembly and controlled through the National Front by the country's ruling SED party. He was also a member of the East German committee for the \\"Fight against Racism Decade\\", the central leadership of the East German Committee of Anti-Fascist Resistance fighters, of the East German \\"League for the United Nations\\" and of the presidium of the .

Its members met while attending Lyceum 34 in Kostroma, and formed the group in 2000. After an education in art and music, they began creating pastel murals and founded a record company in 2001. History The four became friends at school, formed a band and created an pastel mural (their first) on the stucco wall of a children's nature center. After it was damaged by fire several times, it was dismantles a few years later. Two band members also painted the walls around the Kostroma rail station. Although the pastels were fragile, the technique allowed their fingers direct contact with the wall; their drawing skills were developed with crayons. After recording an unreleased first album the group switched to breakbeat, recording samples from cassette tape, radio and LPs from the collection of Apollo's father, Archpriest Andrei Logvinov. In addition to samples, Apollo recorded bass guitars, keyboards and drum-machine software. CDs were distributed to friends and family members, and the band performed at Kostroma State University in December 2003. The purchase of their first mixing console and microphone in 2004 improved the quality of their recorded music. After the 22nd album, Anna Glinina and Ilya Pick (flute and vocals) joined the band; around that time, they participated in rap festivals in Ivanovo. By 2007, Komba BAKH members were Apollo (guitars, vocals), Ilya Pick (flute, vocals), Beanpole (bass, vocals), Sergei Tsimliakov (bass, domra), Anna Glinina-Tsimliakova (vocals), Potup (vocals, keyboards), Kvadra (vocals, trumpet) and Ivan Bolotov (drums). They rehearsed at night at a local music school. Early performances included a Kostroma song festival in December, 2007 and January 2008 and a February 14, 2008 show in Belgorod. Journalist Alexandre Gorbachev wrote several articles about the group, and they were mentioned in Zavtra. Komba BAKH performed in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Yekaterinburg and Yaroslavl. The band's membership changed several times; Natalia Eremina joined in 2013, and Anna and Sergei Tsimliakov, Nikolai Morosov (guitar) and Valentin Filippov (bass, percussion) left. A Korg D-888 portable studio enhanced their live performances. 54 Live The group increased its performance repertoire to 54 songs, including instrumentals. By its 54th online release, Komba BAKH decided to perform all its compositions live using a Fender Rhodes electric piano. The elaborate program was performed in Moscow, St. Petersburg and Kostroma, where it was recorded and filmed. Painting Komba BAKH was influenced artistically by the 14th-century painter Andrei Rublev and his colleague, Daniel Chorny. Their paintings have carpet-like filling with a number of motifs (flowers, animals, decorations, landscapes, fantasy, architecture and occasionally portraits) copied from photographs and drawings by other artists. In addition to crayons and pastels, they use oil and acrylic. The ephemeral street art was eventually destroyed or painted over. Apollo was commissioned to paint a board fence in oil. The group's largest work was a wall around a football pitch in Belarus. It was painted from August to October 2011. In May 2014, nine Komba BAKH works were shown in an exhibition by young painters.

In 1924 she was purchased by Gustav Erikson's shipping company in Mariehamn, √Öland, Finland. She was used for transport and schooling ship for young sailors until 1932 when a squall completely broke her rig on the Southern Ocean and she was sunk as breakwater near the town of Stenhouse Bay in South Australia. '''' Hougomont had a crew of 24 men. The name \\"Hougomont\\" is derived from Ch√¢teau d'Hougoumont where the Battle of Waterloo was fought. While seaworthy she sailed to Peru, Florida, Canada, Australia, England, Ireland, and Sweden among other destinations. She had two sister ships, Nivelle (stranded in 1906) and Archibald Russell. History Hougomont was unfortunate and damaged on several occasions while at sea.http://www.samemory.sa.gov.au/site/page.cfm?c=6667 In March 1903 she ran aground at Allonby on the Cumbrian coast. She was bound for Liverpool from San Francisco and had been driven off course by heavy weather. Her cargo included 32,000 cases of tinned pears and 24,000 cases of salmon, which the villagers of Allonby 'harvested' from the shore. Wigton Advertiser, 7 March 1903 In 1910 nine men were washed overboard when a rogue wave hit her stern in a hurricane. Five of the men were washed back on board by the next wave, but the remaining four were never seen again. In November 1927 her rig sustained damage in the Bay of Biscay, and she took refuge at the port of Lisbon, Portugal, where she was repaired in order to continue her voyage to Melbourne, Australia. In 1931 several of her sails were torn to shreds in a storm near Cape Horn. On 20 April 1932 at 01:00 she was dismasted by a squall in a storm in the Southern Ocean south of Cape Borda in South Australia. She was at the time on her 111th day at sea, carrying deadweight, on her way to a port in Spencer Gulf, west of Adelaide, Australia.http://www.wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?52323 The wreckage of the damaged rig battered the ship severely and it took the crew 30 hours to free her from it. She was coincidentally spotted by a steamer that wirelessly telegraphed about the distress to Adelaide, and the steam tug Wato was sent to assist. However, by the time Wato had reached Hougomont, Hougomont‚Ä≤s crew had managed to build a jury rig and she was sailing slowly forward. Her captain, Ragnar Lindholm, refused all offers of assistance from the tug as he wanted to avoid salvage fees. Nineteen days later, on 8 May 1932, she reached the anchorage immediately off Semaphore in Adelaide. It was estimated that she was damaged beyond repair, so everything valuable on her was removed and shipped to Mariehamn on Herzogin Cecilie in December 1932. She was sold to the Waratah Gypsum Company for scuttling as a breakwater. In January 1933, Wato towed her to Stenhouse Bay for scuttling. She was scuttled there on 8 January 1933. Today she lies underwater in Stenhouse Bay. Her stern and prow are still standing somewhat upright, but most of her hull has collapsed. Her figurehead, a blonde lady dressed in a white gown, is displayed in √Öland Maritime Museum in Mariehamn. The wreck site is officially located at .

It was built from 1860s circa to 1860s circa. It is also known as Bishopcroft, Blairgowie, and Morningside. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The land on which these semi-detached houses stand was acquired in 1861 by Sydney merchant Joseph Thompson. It is believed he purchased a number of Kangaroo Point properties on which he erected various dwellings in the 1860s, and that the semi-detached houses were amongst these rental investments. No precise date of construction has been identified, but the houses are prominent in a photograph of Kangaroo Point taken between 1867 and the mid 1870s. As Edward Lamb, an occupant in the 1870s, was resident in Main Street in 1867-8, it is possible that the pair was constructed by then. Thompson retained the property until his death in 1902, when it passed to William Mann Thompson, who subsequently subdivided the land. Since 1924 the houses have been held under separate title, with the northern house generally owner-occupied, but the southern one being a rental property from the 1930s to the 1950s. Over more than one hundred and twenty years the houses have maintained their status as genteel accommodation, whose tenants have numbered amongst Brisbane's more successful business, legal and political figures.  Description  This pair of two- storeyed semi-detached brick houses stands in a garden setting between the Story Bridge and the Town Reach of the Brisbane River, with city views from the rear of the property. They rest on a foundation of Brisbane tuff and share a common hipped roof and a central double chimney which rises above the party wall. The roof is clad with corrugated galvanised iron, but is likely to have been shingled or slated originally. Console brackets beneath narrow eaves define the lower roofline. The Georgian-styled rendered exterior is scored to resemble ashlar, and presents a symmetrical front facade to Main Street. Entrances are set back at either end under small pedimented porticos, and the upper storey of each house features narrow, round-headed windows either side of large French doors. These open onto a small balcony above a projecting ground floor bay. All the second level windows and doors are protected by curved drip moulding and full-length shutters. Detailing is unusual in the use of round or diamond-shaped holes \\"punched\\" through the pediments, window heads and balconies. Front verandahs at ground floor level are separated by a masonry wall and feature discrete concave, corrugated iron awnings supported by broad timber posts. A set of French doors opens onto each verandah from the drawing rooms. Internally each house is a mirror image of the other, with ground floor hall, drawing room and dining room, a bathroom at the first landing, and bedrooms on the top floor. Ceilings at the lower level are () high and an archway with folding cedar doors separates the drawing and dining rooms. Cellars lie beneath the ground floors. At the rear remain the detached single-storey service wings, each formerly containing kitchen and maid's room. The northern kitchen has been modernised internally, and the southern one has been refitted as a guest suite. The rear verandah of the southern house has been remodelled as the kitchen. 1970s renovation of the northern house also resulted in the installation of an attic bedroom with a small balcony at the rear, enclosure and extension of the back verandah to create a living space, and the addition of a terrace and pool to the back yard. Despite the alterations, the pair presents a highly intact and cohesive exterior, with the semi-detached relationship not immediately apparent.  Heritage listing  Silverwells was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Silverwells is associated with the 1860s development of the higher ground at Kangaroo Point as a genteel address. Silverwells is possibly the oldest residential building remaining at Kangaroo Point. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. Silverwells is a rare Brisbane semi-detached brick housing, more common in Sydney in the 1860s. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The residence contributes aesthetically to the highly intact, stylish and cohesive facade of the Kangaroo Point townscape.

The film stars Roy Dupuis, Clara Furey, Louis Negin, Jacques Nolot, Charlotte Rampling, Udo Kier, Gregory Hlady, Sparks, Karine Vanasse, Mathieu Amalric, Maria de Medeiros and Geraldine Chaplin. Plot The film's frame story, and the narrative it returns to the most, concerns a submarine crew transporting a volatile substance that will explode if they ever resurface. As the crew struggle to survive with low oxygen levels, a woodsman (Roy Dupuis) mysteriously forces his way onto the vessel; the crew believe his sudden appearance may lead to an escape from their predicament. The men navigate a labyrinth of rooms and passageways while trying to access the captain's chamber. Along the way, they recount stories that lead to other stories, which unfold in a complex and layered manner. The most important of these \\"sub- stories\\" shows the woodsman and his fellow \\"sapling-jacks\\" trying to rescue a woman named Margot from depraved kidnappers. Other sub-stories involve: a surgeon kidnapped by a team of \\"women skeletons\\" who work as insurance defrauders; a madman on a train under the charge of a womanizing psychiatrist; a mustache that seeks to comfort the widow of the man whose face it used to adorn; and a doctor cursed by a bust of Janus. The submarine crew finally reach the captain's \\"forbidden room\\", only to find him incapacitated. Most of the men die of asphyxiation, but the woodsman finds that the volatile cargo has transformed into his love, Margot. A passionate kiss leads into a montage of proposed endings from \\"The Book of Climaxes\\", and an abrupt, inconclusive ending to the film itself.

It was built from 1936 to 1937. It is also known as Cliffiside Flats. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 27 February 2004.  History  Cliffside Apartments, a five-storey masonry building prominently located on the cliffs at Kangaroo Point, was built in 1936-37 to the design of architect and engineer Ronald Martin Wilson. The building is sited on two blocks originally part of an early land purchase by John and George Harris in 1855. The land passed through the hands of several owners until it was purchased by Mrs Doris Regina Booth at the beginning of 1930. At the time that Mrs Booth bought the site it was a sheer cliff of solid porphyry with a railway and wharves at its base. Mrs Booth was born in 1895 in a house named Cliffside next to the railway gates on the Kangaroo Point Cliffs. She married Captain Charles Booth in 1919 and together they travelled to New Guinea in 1920. Mrs Booth distinguished herself by breaking convention and securing her own miner's right and then becoming a licensed recruiter of labour. She was the only resident white woman in the Bulolo Valley and stayed there alone (in her house, also named Cliffside) while her husband prospected at Edie Creek. From September 1926 to January 1927 she organized and managed a racially segregated bush hospital to control a dysentery epidemic. She received an O.B.E for this work in 1928. Later that year in London, she recorded these and other adventures in her book, Mountains, Gold and Cannibals, which was written with the assistance of M. O'Dwyer. Mrs Booth returned to New Guinea in 1929 and gradually wrested control over the family business affairs from her husband, from whom she separated in 1932. The Booths became embroiled in an acrimonious court case when in 1933 Charles Booth sued in the Central Court of the Territory of New Guinea for restitution of property. The case was a test case as no mandated territory law explicitly safeguarded married women's property rights. Judge F. B. Phillips held that British and Australian Acts passed before 1921 superseded the common law notion of male control of joint property and gave Mrs Booth the verdict. The judgement was upheld in a subsequent appeal in the High Court of Australia and territorial law was amended by the Status of Married Women Ordinance 1935-36. Booth returned to prospecting and Mrs Booth went on to become a successful mine manager and company director and amongst other achievements was appointed as the sole woman member of the first and second Legislative Councils of Papua and New Guinea in 1951-57. The construction of Cliffside in 1936-37 attested to Doris Booth's extraordinary independent effort and acumen. After securing the land adjacent to her childhood home, Mrs Booth granted power of attorney to her sister Mrs Selma Dore who took responsibility for supervising the design and construction of the building. Work on the ambitious project began in late 1935 when R. Martin Wilson began his first drawings. Wilson was both an architect and engineer and it is possible that he was commissioned on the basis of his engineering expertise, a skill that would obviously be required on this job. However, both Wilson and Doris Booth had close connections with Burns Philp & Company and it is possible that this connection brought them together. Burns Philp had financed the Booths' first foray into the goldfields of New Guinea and Wilson and his father had provided extensive architectural services to the company. A tender notice appeared in the Architects and Builders Journal of Queensland in June 1936, and George Mitchell's tender was accepted in July. A Special Note in the Bill of Quantities stated that \\"Contractors are advised to visit and inspect the site and satisfy themselves as to the nature of excavations to be carried out, as it is anticipated rock will be met with. No blasting will be allowed. All excavations in rock to be done by the use of an air compressor.\\" Wilson went on to specify that all rock and fill from the excavations was to be re-used to form terraces, steps and paving. Cliffside was considered the height of modernity when it was opened in June 1937. The Telegraph reported on 7 June that \\"Cliffside Flats at River Terrace, Kangaroo Point, have given Brisbane an example of the most advanced flat design in Australia.\\" Although the practice of converting houses to flats was well established in Brisbane, the development of the purpose-designed flat was slower in Brisbane than in other parts of the country. The Telegraph described that \\"Until quite recently the flat-habit was looked on by Brisbane with mixed feelings of disfavour and doubt, but now the general desire for easier living, coupled with the acute problem of obtaining competent domestics, is spreading the flat-habit over a wider field.\\" The article went on to expound the virtues of properly designed and planned flats, of which Cliffside was the foremost example. Cliffside was equipped with all modern conveniences including built-in furniture, dining nooks and serverys, electric refrigerators, electric hot water, water softening and incinerator and laundry chutes. The design of the building maximised privacy, views, light and the flow of air. Each of the eight flats had their own private entrance and floors were sound-proofed. The slope of the site was used to advantage so that no more than one and a half flights of stairs had to be scaled to gain access to any one of them. Plumbing connections were housed in a special duct with access from outside the building so that maintenance and repairs could take place without bothering the tenants. A caretaker's quarters was part of the original design, as was the provision of lock-up garages. The building was designed in the popular interwar style of English Revival or Tudor Revival with elements such as eaves and bay windows having a half-timbered appearance. As the promotional literature stated, Cliffside was \\"the newest, the best and the most attractive offering in Brisbane\\". At the opening of Cliffside on 10 June, Alderman Louis Luckins announced that the Brisbane City Council was introducing new bylaws to regulate the standards of construction and design of flat buildings, emphasising, however, that not everyone would be able to achieve the \\"heights of quality embodied in Cliffside\\". These ordinances were ratified by the Executive Council of Brisbane City Council in August 1937 and dealt with issues such as plot ratios, sanitation and fire rating. 1936-37 was the peak time for interwar flat construction in Queensland. In the following years, construction decreased due to the uncertain investment climate created by the threat of war in Europe as well as the refusal of banking institutions to lend on flat constructions. Cliffside is a fine example of the work of R. Martin Wilson and demonstrates his skill in the fields of both architecture and engineering. Born in Brisbane in 1886, he was the son of architect Alexander Brown Wilson and studied and worked with his father from 1902-8. He received a Bachelor of Engineering at the University of Queensland in 1915 and won the Walter and Eliza Hill Travelling Fellowship allowing him to study architectural engineering in the United States from 1915 to 1917. He went on to London and studied at the Architectural Association as well as completing a town planning course at London University. From 1919, he lectured in engineering at University of Queensland and was the first person to gain a Masters in Engineering at that institution. He practised with his father as Alex B. and R. Martin Wilson, Architects and Architectural Engineers, Brisbane from 1920, becoming a registered architect in 1929. He was active in professional bodies such as the Institute of Architects and the Town Planning Association. Alex Wilson retired in 1928 and R. M. Wilson was later joined by his son, Blair in the firm of R. M. Wilson and Son. Mrs Booth retired to Brisbane in 1960. She sold Cliffside in 1966 to Giuseppe and Angelo Angelino, whose family company retains ownership of the building.  Description  Building in 2015 Cliffside Apartments is a five-story, masonry building located on the cliff at Kangaroo Point overlooking Garden's Point and the City Botanic Gardens. The building is of load-bearing cavity brick construction finished alternately in face brickwork and cement render. Concrete construction is used in retaining walls and car parking structures on the southern side of the building. The northern elevation facing the Brisbane River is dominated by large hexagonal bay windows projecting from the corners of the building. This elevation also has a number of smaller, faceted bay windows and a central, decorated bay window spanning two floors and housing a large sign inscribed \\"Cliffside\\". The large hipped roof is clad in terracotta tiles with a small brick chimney from the former incinerator. Timber casement windows with concrete sills are to be found throughout the building and many have concrete shades supported by concrete corbels projecting from the lintel. The main entrance to the building is from Lower River Terrace and is marked with an iron entry gate. Steps and paths edged with Brisbane tuff drawn from the site encircle the building and lead to the various front doors of individual flats. There are a number of types of stonework in the garden including low, coursed walls of squared rubble construction and random rubble walls as well as garden beds edged with shards of vertical stone. An expanse of lawn overlooks the river on the level of the first floor flats and laundry area and is retained with a large concrete and tuff sloping wall. The lawn is fenced and has a flagpole, planting includes a jacaranda and mature frangipani. The building contains seven flats, six of which were designed with two bedrooms and one single bedroom flat. The former caretaker's quarters is located under the garages, within a concrete framed building with tall concrete posts. Each of the flats have their own front doors. Entry doors are high mid-rail timber with decorative leadlight upper panels, some having complimentary windows located close by. Back doors are located on the southern elevation, accessed by landings off a central dogleg stair housed within a timber, fibro and lattice stairwell. The interiors of the flats are characterised by dark, stained timber panelling, plate rails and joinery with white decorative plaster ceilings, ornate cornices and dark, polished hardwood floors. Features include a number of built-in storage units and a kitchen- dining room servery with leadlight windows. The kitchens have basic timber joinery and dining nooks of two bench seats and a table. Bathrooms have terrazzo floors and original tiling around the combined shower and bath. A shared laundry area is situated on the ground floor towards the eastern end of the building. On the southern side of the building are two car parking structures. A timber and fibrous-cement shed is located above the caretakers flat on the western end of the site. On the eastern side, a concrete structure accommodates two carpark spaces with car parking above.  Heritage listing  Cliffside Apartments was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 27 February 2004 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Cliffside Apartments is important for demonstrating the pattern of residential development in Brisbane during the interwar period when large numbers of flat buildings were constructed. The increase in the number of flats in the mid 1930s demonstrates the rapid growth of Brisbane's population and the subsequent high demand for accommodation due to a shortage of housing. It also reflects changing community attitudes towards new forms of housing. The principal investor in Cliffside was a woman, illustrative of the growing connection between women and property investment and flats in the interwar period. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Cliffside Apartments demonstrates the principal characteristics of a substantial, architect-designed, interwar apartment building including features such as built-in storage, dining nooks, caretaker's quarters and lock-up garages that are particularly characteristic of early purpose-designed flats. Cliffside is a prominent and highly intact example of the domestic work of Brisbane architect RM Wilson. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Cliffside has aesthetic and architectural significance. Occupying a dramatic and difficult site, Cliffside's superior standards of design and finish represent a highpoint in the quality and resolution of flat design in Brisbane. The building has strong landmark qualities deriving from its prominent siting at Kangaroo Point between the South Brisbane and Town Reaches of the Brisbane River overlooking the city and Botanic Gardens.

T. compactum erinaceum was a bearded, hairy rachis, red-chaffed wheat named for its appearance similar to that of a hedgehog. T. compactum erinaceum was thought to have disappeared before 1822.Davis, Horace. 1894. California Breadstuffs. (Chicago. The University of Chicago Press.) However data from the United States Department of Agriculture indicates two additional specimen that were discovered and identified as T. compactum erinaceum more than a hundred years after their presumed disappearance. The new specimen indicate that T. compactum erinaceum was grown in the United States until the dust bowl era, at which point it presumably disappeared. There have only been four recorded specimens of T. compactum erinaceum.George W. Hendry, and Margaret P. Kelly. December 1970. The Plant Content of Adobe Bricks: With a Note on Adobe Brick Making. California Historical Society Quarterly. p. 366 Identification T. compactum erinaceum has a small short brush. Its stem is usually white, but sometimes faintly purple on lower internodes. T. comactum erinaceum has awned spikes (2 to 5 cm long) and a brown, wide, glabrous glume. T. comactum erinaceum usually has rounded shoulders and wide incurved beaks (1 to 4 mm long). The kernels of T. comactum erinaceum are red, short, soft, ovate, humped and curved. Its germ is small and its crease medium to wide and shallow. Its cheeks are usually angular. History T. compactum erinaceum was grown alongside other species of wheat by Jesuit Monks in Monterey County California during the late eighteenth century. T. comactum erinaceum was presumed extinct after 1822, but proved to exist when in the summer of 1917 when it was rediscovered by E. F. Gaines, of the Washington Agricultural Experiment Station growing in the vicinity of May View, Washington. Again In 1929 T. compactum erinaceum was reported to be growing, in Douglas County, Oregon, on 322 acres.

It is the second most popular (after the Solaris Urbino 12) Solaris model in terms of the number of units sold. Since 2005, the third generation of the Urbino 18 is produced. In addition to the basic model, which is powered by an diesel engine which meets the Euro 5 emission standard, there are versions produced to meet the EEV and fueled with CNG or the second generation hybrid bus model. History Neoplan N4021 On 2 August 1994, Neoplan Polska company was established in Poland. 5 September of the same year, the first low-floor buses Neoplan N4020 (15 metre long) were ordered by Warsaw. 5 October 1995, the day after signing the contract for the supply of buses to Pozna≈Ñ, it was decided to build a factory in Bolechowo near Pozna≈Ñ. Between 1996-2000 Neoplan Polska built the Neoplan N4000-series buses. In 1999, the company even as Neoplan Polska started to independently produce buses under the brand Solaris, but the offer was not yet available for the short 9 or 10 metre buses. Therefore, the Neoplan K4010TD low-entry midibus with two doors was built with a length of 9.5 metres. However, only 3 were built and all were sold to ≈öwidnica. The Solaris Urbino 9 replaced three of the shortest in the Neoplan N4000-series: N4007, N4009 and N4010. In 2001 Neoplan was taken over by MAN, but Neoplan Polska became a separate company as Solaris Bus & Coach, which has preserved the company tradition and assets - including models of the buses - of the Polish branch of Neoplan. Solaris Urbino 18 First Generation in PKA Gdynia livery. =First generation (1999-2002)= The first generation Solaris Urbino 18 was produced from the second half of 1999. This model was to supplement Solaris' offer on large buses, 18-metre buses for public transportation services. The first Solaris Urbino 18 bus unit went to PKA Gdynia in 1999, it was also the only new low-floor articulated bus bought in 1999 by transport companies in Poland. Initially, the 18-metre buses did not sell well because the transportation companies preferred smaller and cheaper 15-metre vehicles. The bus market expanded between 1996-2002, which resulted in the later increase in demand for 18-metre buses. In total, cities in Poland bought 12 units of the Solaris Urbino 18 First Generation. Articulated vehicles were mainly built for export, most Solaris Urbino 18 were bought by a company from Berlin and Riga. A characteristic feature of the bus are the painted railings instead of clear varnish yellow paint. =Second Generation (2002-2005)= Solaris Urbino 18 Second Generation. From the first half of 2002 Solaris produced the second-generation models, the vehicles were treated as a temporary solution before the target model of third generation buses. Since the spring of 2005 the company produced the third generation of the bus. On the basis of structure of the Solaris Urbino 18 the tram Solaris Trollino 18 is being built in Bolechowo. =Third Generation= Third generation Solaris Urbino 18 in Riga A major order by MZA Warsaw in 2005, resulted in the significant increase of the sale of the Solaris Urbino 18 in Poland. In December 2006, Olsztyn was the first Polish city to receive 8 units of the Solaris Urbino 18 model which meets the Euro 5 qualification, which came as standard for new vehicles in 2009. =Solaris Urbino 18 CNG= Since 2005, there are variants of using LPG and CNG. The first Solaris Urbino 18 CNG went to Lublin in November 2006, in October 2009 another was sold to Radom in Poland. The second bus was intended to go to Norway, but the contract was reversed, and it is used as a test vehicle. A low-entry version was built which is named Solaris Urbino 18 CNG LE. Like the previous vehicle, it now serves as a test vehicle. =Solaris Urbino 18 Hybrid= Solaris Urbino 18 Hybrid. The first generation of Solaris Urbino 18 Hybrid was built between 2006-2008. From the second half of 2008, the models are built in the second generation. They have been produced by the use of the similarities of the Solaris Urbino 18. The characteristic of the Urbino 18 is a green dachshund. Various hybrid versions include specific symbols. The hybrid models have a dachshund which is in between two hearts which symbolise the two type of power. During the production of the Solaris Urbino 18 Hybrid model, there have been implemented four types of hybrid power systems. The different versions can be distinguished by the difference in the interior, like that of the Paris transportation system BRT type - BHNS, which differentiates from the Solaris Urbino series bus family. From the autumn of 2010, 18 buses have been produced with the Allison I or Allison II systems. =Solaris Urbino 18 Fourth Generation= Fourth generation in Vilnius On the 24 September 2014, after ten years of production of the third generation Solaris Urbino, Solaris Bus & Coach unveiled a new generation of Solaris buses. During this year's trade fair in Hannover at the world premiere (end of September) and at the Transexpo Trade Fair in Kielce in early October Solaris showed two prototypes - Urbino 12 and Urbino 18 in their fourth generation, and will in the future include other models in this generation like the Urbino LE and Urbino Hybrid. The new buses are more durable, lighter and more refined in terms of design and construction when compared to the previous generation models. The noise was also reduced and there is no vibration throughout the vehicle. The entire vehicle is illuminated by lights with LED technology.

Begun by a French military mission in 1955, its 100-man companies were placed under command of the local Military Region commander when trained. By 1 September 1959, 20 ADC companies were in training, and there were 16,000 ADC soldiers nationwide. When Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) operatives Theodore Shackley, James William Lair and others slipped into the Kingdom of Laos in the early 1960s, they instituted an American version of the ADC dependent on pre-packed airdropped materiel. Using a three-day training schedule in Operation Momentum, Shackley, Lair and others, worked with Vang Pao to raise a guerrilla force of 5,000 troops in several months. The ADC concept's success helped it spread. The Royal Lao Government (RLG) set up its own version. U.S. Special Forces (USSF) copied the ADC for Operation White Star and Operation Pincushion, and to organize the Degar in South Vietnam. In 1967, Royal Thai Special Forces belatedly began their own ADC program along the Thai-Lao border. As the Laotian Civil War continued, ADC troops began to assume the role of regular light infantry. They were gathered into larger units such as ad hoc battalions. In many cases, the village militia was transferred away from their home villages. They were assigned to such non-guerrilla tasks as defending or attacking fixed positions. They were conscripted into regular units of the RLA. Their numbers dwindled in the confusion of warmaking; the ADC faded in importance until only 6,000 remained in service by war's end.  The French Auto Defense de Choc  Although the French lost the First Indochina War, they were bound by the 1954 Geneva Agreement to provide the newly independent Kingdom of Laos with a trained military.Anthony, Sexton, p. 11. As part of the Lao military establishment the French raised a paramilitary force, the AD Corps, in 1955. They disbanded it in 1958, only to reconstitute it the following year. The AD Corps was supposed to be a nationwide network of 16,000 volunteers for local village self- defense. Assets from an earlier Garde Nationale (National Guard) and some prior commando companies were rolled into the new organization. The Royal Lao Government (RLG) planned to use most of the AD Corps for part-time village self-defense; these were the Auto-Defense Ordinaire (Ordinary Self Defense) troops. However, some members of the new Corps were designated for full-time service against a burgeoning Pathet Lao communist movement; these were designated Auto Defense de Choc (Self-Defense Shock) troops. The 4,000 Hmong located in Xam Neua between the Pathet Lao and their North Vietnamese backers were such.Conboy, Morrison, p. 23. The AD Corps was designed to consist of 100 man companies. These companies contained four platoons. In turn, each platoon was supposed to have three assault squads and one heavy weapons squad. AD Corps companies were under the command of their local military region. On 1 September 1959, RLG plans called for creation of 20 Auto Defense companies by month's end, with an additional 20 companies trained by the end of October. The various military regions of Laos were training recruits: Military Region 1 had 5,000 trainees; MR 2 had 3,700; MR 3 had 3,000; MR 4 had another 3,000 recruits; MR 5 had 1,300.Conboy, Morrison, p. 29.  The American Auto Defense de Choc  A Auto Defense de Choc (ADC) Hmong guerrilla company assembles at Phou Vieng, Spring 1961. = Operation Momentum = The Central Intelligence Agency's undercover entry into Laos would result in an American version of the ADC. CIA agent Bill Lair contacted Vang Pao in early January 1961. The Hmong officer offered to raise and train a clandestine army of 10,000 hill tribes guerrillas via the ADC program. Lair, who had trained the Thai Police Aerial Resupply Unit to Special Forces standards, got permission from his seniors to staff Operation Momentum and supply it from the Programs Evaluation Office.Warner, pp. 33‚Äì34, 47. The first CIA-backed training session for ADC was at Padong, located back in the hills 17 kilometers south of the communist- occupied Plain of Jars. Key to the success of this ADC program was the pre- packed supplies that could be parachuted into obscurely located training camps.Conboy, Morrison, p. 61.Warner, p. 64. The ADC program was relatively inexpensive; for instance, the Lao soldiers were paid about ten cents per day.Hamilton-Merritt, p. 177. Because the training was located a three-day march from the nearest People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) troops, a three-day curriculum was set up. On day one, three parachuted pre-packed loads were broken down and issued to recruits; they then learned to use rifles and light crew-served weapons. Day two saw the new soldiers learn the skills of ambushing the enemy; first they practiced setting squad-size ambushes, then moved up to using platoons. The third day covered squad, platoon, and company- size ambushes, as well as booby traps. The first two ADC companies in Momentum graduated on 20 January 1961. The following day, 20 of the graduates ambushed and killed 15 Lao communist soldiers. By the 22nd, both companies cut Route 4 20 kilometers south of Xieng Khouang.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 61‚Äì65. Building on that success, more ADC companies began training, while more American support was poured into the ADC program. As ADC companies graduated, they dispersed and trained other troops. More training camps were opened, being located to surround the Plain of Jars and to interpose between the PDJ and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam border. On 24 February 1961, 385 Thai technicians and specialists were authorized to be in Laos by the end of the month. PARU teams were rapidly infiltrated into Laos to serve as trainers. Six more CIA agents arrived to aid Bill Lair in supervising the PARU. Among them were Tony Poe, Bill Young, and Tom Fosmire. With aerial support from both Air America and BirdAir, Lima sites began to be carved out of the jungled ridges of Laos so that short takeoff and landing aircraft could resupply ADC camps. Even as the ADC effort burgeoned, communist troops began to locate and attack some camps, though with no real result. Instead of defending the bases, the Lao irregulars simply moved and started over, littering their line of retreat with booby traps. Within two months of their founding, by the end of March 1961, Momentum ADC companies ringed the PDJ; they mustered 5,000 troops. By that time, they were funded to raise a total of 7,000 irregulars.Ahern, p. 53. = Operation Pincushion and road watch teams = The successful ADC effort also attracted another sort of support. The U.S. Army pressured the CIA into allowing the introduction of Operation White Star training teams into the ADC program. The White Star teams were subsets of U.S. Special Forces A Teams. They founded one such ADC program apart from Momentum, placing it on the Bolovens Plateau in southern Laos, and dubbed it Operation Pincushion. However, the Green Berets did not enjoy quite the training success as the PARU had. They found that their raw Hune recruits were not as aggressive as the Hmong. Just as the Hmong were, the Hune were scorned by lowland Lao, and thus neglected by the Royalist government. The new Hune soldiers had difficulty loading the M1 Garand. They also lacked the physical strength to hand carry the 57 mm recoilless rifle from place to place. They also lacked the ethnic cohesiveness of the Hmong. Out of the 12 ADC companies trained in Pincushion, half of one deserted, and another was wracked to uselessness by internal dissension.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 66‚Äì68, 85‚Äì88. Operation White Star was closed out by 28 September 1962, in accordance with the International Agreement on the Neutrality of Laos; the Green Berets left Laos.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 95‚Äì96. They left behind 12 subterranean caches stocked with ammunition, weapons cleaning supplies, rice, and grenades in the vicinity of Paksong and Houei Kong.Conboy, Morrison, p. 87. Another operation in the Laotian panhandle was the road watch teams. The original ADC program in southern Laotian Khammouane Province began in 1959; it produced 1,765 militiamen for the RLG. In December 1960, the CIA-sponsored PARU Team C took over training to revive the ADC program. After Team C was pressured out of the province by enemy activity in February 1962, CIA agent Mike Deuel was left with nine ADC companies. Based at Phou Sang, he used them as road watch teams spying upon the Ho Chi Minh Trail during May and June; then PAVN troops closing in forced an evacuation and closure of the base. Deuel would reconstitute his road watch program in October 1963 as Operation Hardnose. Conboy, Morrison, pp, 117‚Äì118.  Further developments of ADC  While Operation White Star was concluded as part of the American military leaving Laos, Operation Momentum went into suspended animation. Nevertheless, the CIA tried to maintain contact with the 13,500 ADC troops it had trained in northern Laos. Much to the disgust of Vang Pao, the CIA's supply of munitions to his Hmong guerrillas was suspended. To conserve his trained manpower, he gathered 500 of his ADC guerrillas into the first of his Special Guerrilla Units (SGU).Conboy, Morrison, pp. 97‚Äì99. From this time on, the ADC forces would dwindle in importance drained off its best troops into organized larger units; within a year, a third of the 30,000 ADC soldiers were serving in SGUs.Prados, p. 231. Efforts also began to replace the foreign instructors with Lao; the new training took place at Phitsanulok, Thailand. The Lao Special Operating Teams were modeled after the PARU, but consisted of 12 man teams.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 88, 97. On 10 April 1963, President John F. Kennedy ordered resumption of U.S. support by the newly established Requirements Office to the ADCs. By this time, many non-CIA ADC units were assigned to work as militia in conjunction with the Royal Lao Army (RLA). They were spread out among all five Laotian military regions. In the northwest, Military Region 1 hosted 35 ADC units. In the northeast, around the Plain of Jars, MR 2 held 23 ADC units besides the independent Hmong companies. MR 3, the north end of the Lao panhandle, had 34 ADC units on strength. South of it, MR 4 contained 21 ADC units; that was not including the Pincushion dozen, which had disbanded. Military Region 5, around Vientiane, contained only 9 ADC units. In January and February 1964, the ADC defended three of its sites from fixed positions as though they were light infantry. Four other sites were evacuated under attack. In April, the ADC suffered another setback as the PAVN finally overran Phou Nong.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 125‚Äì126. For Operation Triangle in late July 1964, CIA-backed ADC units were attached to regular units of the RLA. On 29 July, elements of Special Guerrilla Unit 1, as well as a Hmong ADC company, swooped in unexpectedly via helicopter to capture the road intersection that was the Royalist objective, thus ending the battle.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 111‚Äì112.Warner, p. 139-141. For the first few months of 1965, Vang Pao planned an expansion of the Operation Momentum ADC program to the north and west of the Pathet Lao capital of Xam Neua. To do this, in a break from prior practice, the Hmong general transferred some of his ADC troops away from their home villages. Some of these ADC troops were dispersed in a skirmish line forward of the troops. The end result was a force of 5,120 ADC troopers, backed by 5,500 ADO militia stationed in friendly villages.Conboy, Morrison, p. 131. In a further blurring of the distinction between ADC guerrillas and Lao regulars, the RLA began to skim off promising militia men to beef up Royalist units.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 131, 138.  ADC absorbed  As the war continued, the ADC program still ran as designed in Military Region 1 in far western and northwestern Laos. Belatedly begun by Royal Thai Army (RTA) instructors in late 1967 near Xieng Lom, it graduated its first three companies by 31 October 1967. They swept southwest, pushing communist guerrillas ahead of them. The RTA crossed the border into Laos and attacked the band of communists.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 316‚Äì317. However, Forces Guerrilla West, the western ADC program, suffered numerous difficulties by 1969. The CIA discovery of the large number of \\"phantom troops\\" carried on payroll led to reforms, including arrest of corrupt commanders and retraining of existing ADC. In one case, only 45 of 300 troops were present in one base. As Hmong recruits became scarce, attempts were made to train other ethnic minorities. Animosity was aroused by this, and dissension arose even to the point of mutiny. As a result, 300 dissident Hmong ADC troopers were relocated to Military Region 2. Matters were somewhat better in Forces Guerrilla Northwest, which was based at Nam Yu on the Chinese border. CIA agent Tony Poe oversaw junior agents assigned to work with various ethnic minorities. By the time Poe departed in 1970, ADC companies segregated by ethnicity had been trained and were being formed into makeshift Special Guerrilla Units (SGU) battalions. Nor were Nam Yu's the only ADC irregulars being co-opted into regular service. In Military Region 2, they were stationed at Phou Pha Thi as defensive light infantry to guard Lima Site 85 and took part in the Battle of Lima Site 85.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 189‚Äì197. Elsewhere in Laos, ADC units were part of Kou Kiet,Conboy, Morrison, pp. 215‚Äì216. Operation Counterpunch, Operation Maeng Da,Conboy, Morrison, pp. 261‚Äì267. and Operation Honorable Dragon.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 276‚Äì278. In one case, even the ADC militia used for home defense was pressed into regular offensive operations in Military Region 4 for Operation Diamond Arrow.Conboy, Morrison, p. 223. As the end of hostilities neared, the Royal Lao Government still carried 6,000 ADC troopers in its order of battle.Conboy, Morrison, p. 403.

Its provisions cover three areas: * Stop political bribery by overhauling lobbying and ethics laws * End secret money by dramatically increasing transparency * Fix our broken elections by ending gerrymandering and modernizing voting and election funding laws.

FEC and Buckley v. Valeo. = Tallahassee Anti-Corruption Act = In 2014, voters in Tallahassee, Florida approved a city charter amendment modeled after the AACA. The referendum, which passed with 67 percent of the vote, established a city ethics board, created public rebates for political donations up to $25, instructed the board to create an ethics code within six months of the referendum's passage, and lowered the acceptable value of political contributions to city candidates to $250 per donor. The initiative passed with the support of a politically diverse coalition of local advocates, including the Chair of the Florida Tea Party Network, the former President of the Florida League of Women Voters, and the Chairman of Florida Common Cause. = Registration Fee and Monthly Reports for Expenditure Lobbyists, Proposition C: San Francisco = On November 3, 2015, voters in San Francisco passed Proposition C with 74.83% approval. The Proposition, put on the ballot by the San Francisco Ethics Commission, requires lobbyists to register with the city's Ethics Commission, pay a $500 registration fee, and file monthly disclosure reports of their lobbying activities. It also expands the definition of a lobbyist to include a new category‚Äîan ‚Äúexpenditure lobbyist‚Äù‚Äîthat includes persons who spend more than $2,500 in a month to influence legislation or city administrative action. In addition, Proposition C prohibits expenditure lobbyists from making gifts worth more than $25 to city officers. = Honest Elections Seattle = In 2015, voters in Seattle, Washington approved Initiative 122, the \\"Honest Elections Seattle\\" initiative, which made alterations and additions to Seattle's election code. Amended sections include SMC 2.04.165 and SMC 2.04.370, which respectively cover the statement of personal financial affairs and contribution limits. New sections to the city's election code and their titles are as follows: * SMC 2.04.601‚ÄîLimits Contributions from City Contractors * SMC 2.04.602‚ÄîLimit Contributions from Persons Who Pay City Lobbyists * SMC 2.04.606‚ÄîPaid Signature Gatherers * SMC 2.04.607‚ÄîFormer Elected Officials * SMC 2.04.620-690‚ÄîDemocracy Voucher Program I-122 established a voucher program that gave each Seattle voter four $25 ‚Äúdemocracy vouchers,‚Äù which they could donate to the candidates of their choice, as long as the candidate in question adheres to certain campaign contribution limits established by the law. The voucher system is funded by an increase in the city's property tax rate. I-122 also created or strengthened several limits on campaign contributions. The maximum campaign contribution limit was lowered from $700 to $500. I-122 prohibits campaign contributions from any person or entity which currently has, or within the past two years has had, more than $250,000 in contracts with the city. Candidates are now additionally prohibited from accepting contributions from people who have spent $5,000 lobbying the city within the past 12 months. Furthermore, various reporting and compliance standards were implemented by the law. Measure I-122 increased the brackets for candidate income disclosures, moving the top bracket from ‚Äúabove $25,000‚Äù to ‚Äúabove $5,000,000.‚Äù I-122 also mandates that paid signature gatherers must display a sign or badge reading: ‚ÄúPaid Signature Gatherer.‚Äù Finally, penalties for violating election laws were increased from $10 per day to $75 per day. Additional penalties ranging from $250 to $1,000 per day were created to punish infractions within 30 days of an election. Finally, I-122 prohibits elected officials and their staff from lobbying the city government within three years of their departure from office. Initiative I-122 implemented several reforms, including new contribution limits on contractors that lobby the city, revolving door restrictions for city officials, and electronic disclosure requirements.[8] The initiative's backers cite the AACA as \\"the single most influential model [they] drew from\\" when crafting I-122.[9] I-122 passed with approval by 63.19% of voters. = Establishing Reporting Requirements for Political Consultants: Portland, Oregon = On April 20, 2016, voters in Portland Oregon voted to pass Ordinance 187680, thereby adding Chapter 2.14 to the city charter. According to the city's website, ‚ÄúThe purpose of the program is to improve transparency by requiring Political Consultants advising City elected officials to meet certain registration and reporting requirements.‚Äù The program is administered by the city auditor's office. Ordinance 187680 mandated disclosures for political consultants: * If providing Political Consultant services to a covered client, the Political Consultant must report the date services began, and related information. A covered client includes a City elected official, a successful candidate for City office, or either individual's principal campaign committee. * If the Political Consultant also provides services for a City-referred ballot measure, the measure information and date services began must be reported. * When no longer providing services to a covered client, the Political Consultant must provide a termination of services form within 15 days. = Miami-Dade County = On May 17, 2016, county commissioners passed a memorandum requiring that all candidates register when they raise money for PACs. = Proposition T Restricting Gifts and Campaign Contributions from Lobbyists = On November 8, 2016, voters in San Francisco passed Proposition T. The measure, which passed with 87.26% of voter support, requires lobbyists to identify which agencies and officials they intend to target during the city's registration process, prohibits them from making campaign contributions to officials they are registered to lobby and making gifts to any city elected official, and prohibits the facilitation of third-party donations by lobbyists: a process known as ‚Äúbundling.‚Äù = Revision of South Dakota State Campaign Finance and Lobbying Laws = In November, 2016, voters in South Dakota approved Initiated Measure 22, also known as the Revision of State Campaign Finance and Lobbying Laws, and referred to by supporters as the South Dakota Anti-Corruption Act. IM-22 passed with 51.83% voter support. The major features of IM-22 were campaign finance reform, including lowering contribution limits and requiring additional disclosures; the creation of a public financing program for state and legislative candidates; the creation of an ethics commission; and the implementation of ‚Äúcooling off‚Äù periods that establish a duration former legislators must wait before taking work as a lobbyist. The measure made significant alterations to existing campaign finance laws in the state. Per the State Attorney General explanation: ‚ÄúThis measure extensively revises State campaign finance laws. It requires additional disclosures and increased reporting. It lowers contribution amounts to political action committees; political parties; and candidates for statewide, legislative, or county office. It also imposes limits on contributions from candidate campaign committees, political action committees, and political parties. The measure creates a publicly funded campaign finance program for statewide and legislative candidates who choose to participate and agree to limits on campaign contributions and expenditures. Under the program, two $50 ‚Äúcredits‚Äù are issued to each registered voter, who assigns them to participating candidates. The credits are redeemed from the program, which is funded by an annual State general-fund appropriation of $9 per registered voter. The program fund may not exceed $12 million at any time. The measure creates an appointed ethics commission to administer the credit program and to enforce campaign finance and lobbying laws. The measure prohibits certain State officials and high-level employees from lobbying until two years after leaving State government. It also places limitations on lobbyists‚Äô gifts to certain state officials and staff members.‚Äù  Repeal  On December 8, 2016, Judge Mark Barnett of South Dakota‚Äôs Sixth Circuit enjoined IM-22 on the grounds that it was unconstitutional and violated single-subject law. On February 2, 2017, South Dakota Governor, Dennis Daugaard, signed House Bill 1069, effectively repealing IM-22. Because HB 1069 was signed with an emergency clause, it prevented IM-22 from returning to the ballot. On March 10, 2017, Governor Daugaard signed into effect five bills he claimed were meant to replace concepts from IM-22: HB 1073, which restricts lobbyist gifts to legislators; HB 1076, which establishes a government accountability board; HB 1052, an act to provide certain protections for public employees; HB 1165, an act to provide for annually updated financial interest statements for any person elected to statewide or local office; and SB 131, an act revising certain provisions concerning the period of time certain persons are prohibited from lobbying after leaving office. = Measure 26-184: Multnomah County, Oregon = On November 8, 2016, voters in Multnomah County, Oregon passed Measure 26-184, which ‚Äúlimits contributions, expenditures, (and) requires disclosure in Multnomah County candidate elections. The measure created a charter provision, implemented by county ordinance, and went into effect September 2017. The ballot measure, which passed with 89% of voter support, makes significant alterations to campaign finance law at the county level. Prior to Measure 26-184, there had been no limits to county officials‚Äô ability to accept donations. Measure 26-184 established a $500 limit for individuals and political committees. It also allowed for the creation of ‚Äúsmall donor committees,‚Äù which can accept no more than $100 from an individual within a year and can contribute unlimited amounts to candidates or independent expenditures. The measure further limits independent expenditures in county races to $5,000 per individual and $10,000 per political committee. The measure additionally increases reporting standards. It requires entities that spend ‚Äúmore than $750 per election cycle on independent expenditures,‚Äù to register as political committees and report the sources of their funding. Communications to voters that are related to county elections must disclose their ‚Äúfive largest true original sources of funding (in excess of $500) for the communication.‚Äù = Open and Accountable Elections: Portland, Oregon = On December 14, 2016, the City Council of Portland, Oregon approved a small- donor matching program, dubbed Open and Accountable Elections. The program allows city candidates who qualify to have their donations matched by public funds. The first $50 will be matched 6:1 by the city, meaning that a donation of $50 would be worth $350 to a candidate and a $100 donation would be worth $400 to a candidate. In order to qualify, candidates must meet several conditions: * They must not accept donations from anyone living outside of Portland, OR * They must not accept donations exceeding $250 * Commission candidates would first need to raise $2,500 from 250 individuals * Mayoral candidates would first need to raise $5,000 from 500 individuals Participating candidates are required to cap overall spending at $550,000 for a commission race, allocating up to $250,000 for the primary and up to $300,000 for the general election. Participating mayoral candidates‚Äô spending is capped at $950,000; they can spend up to $380,000 in the primary and up to $570,000 in the general election. = Anti-Corruption Resolutions = Anti-Corruption Resolutions are public mandates calling for Anti-Corruption legislation at the state and federal level. On July 14, 2014, Princeton, NJ, \\"became the first municipality in the country to adopt an Anti-Corruption Resolution sponsored by Represent.Us\\". The Princeton resolution mentions six of the eleven provisions in the original AACA draft Anti-Corruption Resolutions have been passed in the following locales: * Princeton, New Jersey * Genoa, Illinois * Massachusetts State House District 2 * Massachusetts State Senate District 19 * Ewing Township, New Jersey * DeKalb County, Illinois * Winnebago County, Illinois * Roanoke, Virginia * South Brunswick, New Jersey * Leverett, Massachusetts * Lawrence Township, New Jersey * Cocoa, Florida * Southfield, Michigan * Boone County, Illinois * McHenry County, Illinois * Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania * Luzerne County, Pennsylvania * Pittston, Pennsylvania * Lexington, Massachusetts * Rockport, Massachusetts * Stephenson County, Illinois * Acton, Massachusetts * South Hadley, Massachusetts * Carrboro, North Carolina * Concord, Massachusetts * Whately, Massachusetts * Nahant, Massachusetts * Marblehead, Massachusetts * Stoneham, Massachusetts * Colrain, Massachusetts * Hadley, Massachusetts * Cummington, Massachusetts * Montague, Massachusetts * Plainfield, Massachusetts * Shutesbury, Massachusetts * Conway, Massachusetts * Andover, Massachusetts * Hatfield, Massachusetts * Longmeadow, Massachusetts * Amherst, Massachusetts * Swampscott, Massachusetts * Southampton, Massachusetts * North Andover, Massachusetts * Williamsburg, Massachusetts * Pleasant Ridge, Michigan * Burnsville, North Carolina * West Windsor, New Jersey * South Abington, Pennsylvania * Ferndale, Michigan * Yancey County, North Carolina * Cranbury Township, New Jersey * Cook County, Illinois * Erie City, Pennsylvania * Kingston Township, Pennsylvania * Foster Township, Pennsylvania * Tempe, Arizona * Northumberland County, Pennsylvania * Nescopeck Township, Pennsylvania * Sunderland, Massachusetts * Ohio * Sudbury, Massachusetts * Pelham, Massachusetts * DuPage County, Illinois * Bridgeport, Connecticut * Vinton, Virginia *Hopewell, New Jersey  Survey results  An opinion poll commissioned by Represent.Us found that 90 percent of respondents support tighter limits on campaign finance, and 97 percent would support stronger anti-corruption measures. \\"The poll also tested the popularity of some potential reforms, giving respondents a menu of 11 options and asking them to pick three. Forty-seven percent picked barring politicians from taking money from industries they regulate ... . Thirty-seven percent picked dramatically reducing the amount of money lobbyists can give to candidates and parties, while 31% picked putting tough limits on super PACs\\", according to the MSNBC summary of the survey.

The columns were painted by Greek immigrant Tom Stefopoulos between 1948 and 1952. In 1999, the viaduct was demolished but the columns were spared due to the efforts of the architectural group Rigga. For the next five years, attempts to restore the columns were unsuccessful and they remained in storage beneath the Fremont Bridge. In 2005, two of the original columns were resited at Northwest 10th Avenue between Everett and Flanders Streets. The Regional Arts & Culture Council was searching for photographs showing the murals in their original location for an ongoing restoration project. In 2006, Randy Shelton reconstructed the artworks on the columns using the photographs for reference. Description and history The Lovejoy Columns supported the Lovejoy Ramp, a viaduct that stretched from Northwest 14th Avenue and Lovejoy Street to the Broadway Bridge. It was constructed in 1927‚Äì1928. Between 1948 and 1952, Athanasios Efthimiou \\"Tom\\" Stefopoulos (died 1971), a Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway night watchman, artist and master calligrapher in the copperplate style, drew upon the columns in chalk and later painted them. His work was spontaneous and not commissioned. Stefopoulos painted Greek mythology and Americana imagery in a calligraphic style; the designs depicted \\"fanciful\\" owls, landscapes \\"bedecked with homespun aphorisms\\", and ancient Greek philosopher Diogenes of Sinope navigating the streets of Athens with a lantern. He painted around a dozen murals, though photographic evidence does not exist for each of them. The paintings became a local landmark and quickly gained Stefopoulos notoriety and media coverage. alt=A car and two bicyclists going across a viaduct In the late 1990s, developer Homer Williams persuaded the city to demolish the viaduct to open up dozens of blocks in the redeveloping Pearl District. Preservation efforts began immediately. In 1998, Georgiana Nehl completed a painting of the columns called Guardians: Under the Lovejoy Ramp to \\"catch a small flavor of these 'guardians,' while they were still in place in their surprising location‚Äîbefore they were lost in the name of progress\\". In 1999, James Henderson took a series of photographs of the remaining pigments of the original paintings; he recorded the murals using cross-polarized lighting and used digital enhancement to restore the colors.Regional Arts & Culture Council:  The Regional Arts & Culture Council administers at least six of Henderson's photographs, which were printed in 2002 and each called Lovejoy Column.Regional Arts & Culture Council:  =Demolition= The viaduct was removed in 1999, but the architectural group Rigga persuaded the city to preserve the paintings and the columns. Rigga said that if the murals had been removed from the columns, \\"much of their magic would be lost\\". The City of Portland's Office of Transportation earmarked funds to remove ten columns; an ad hoc committee called Friends of the Columns was formed to raise money for their storage, restoration and public display, which was estimated to cost $460,000. City Commissioner Charlie Hales said, \\"Saving the Lovejoy columns and the artwork provides a real bridge between the rich history of this industrial area and its future as a residential neighborhood. I am pleased that we are able to save these columns and look forward to them being placed on some of the park spaces in the River District.\\" According to the James M. Harrison Art and Design Studio, \\"Extracting the columns both captured the space created by Tom and preserved a ruin that would continue to tell a story. The fragile paintings preserved the mighty concrete.\\" During the next five years, attempts by the city, and non-profit and entrepreneurial groups to restore the columns were unsuccessful. Boora Architects' Northwest Marshall Street Pedestrian Bridge Feasibility Study (2001), funded by the Portland Development Commission, proposed installing the columns at the intersection of Northwest 9th Avenue and Naito Parkway. alt=A man wearing a long-sleeved black shirt and watch; his arms and crossed, resting on the back of a chair. The columns were featured in a 2003 article by the Getty Conservation Institute called \\"The Conservation of Outdoor Contemporary Murals\\", which described best practices for preserving murals and included photographs of the columns during the demolition phase, with conservator J. Claire Dean assessing one of them. From August 10 to September 4, 2004, Portland-based artist and filmmaker Vanessa Renwick exhibited a paper and video installation called Lovejoy Lost, featuring camera work by her and Gus Van Sant, for the PDX Window Project. In November 2004, Willamette Week reported that the columns were being held at a storage yard at Northwest 14th Avenue and Savier Street, beneath the Fremont Bridge. The paper said, \\"[h]alf-covered in blue tarps, their rusted steel girders sticking out of concrete like veins from a freshly amputated arm, they await the political momentum to rescue them from rot\\". Real estate developer John Carroll hoped to site the columns at the Elizabeth Lofts, but former Rigga member James Harrison said he was reluctant to believe it would happen, given their history. Harrison told Willamette Week, \\"[t]hese things can turn on a dime\\". =Resiting= Carroll's and Harrison's efforts were realized in 2005 when two of the ten original columns were resited at Northwest 10th Avenue between Everett and Flanders streets. The columns featured a majority of Stefopoulos' paintings. Harrison reportedly watched with \\"something like fatherly joy\\" during the installation and said, \\"[w]e're installing a ruin\\". Carroll said displaying the columns as public art \\"will preserve an element of the city‚Äôs past for current and future generations\\" and acknowledged support from the neighborhood, Friends of the Columns and the Portland Development Commission. The Regional Arts & Culture Council was searching for photographs showing the murals in their original location for a restoration project, which would be completed the following summer. In 2006, the columns were reconstructed from the photographs by Randy Shelton. The City of Portland's Bureau of Planning said the resited columns \\"[celebrate] a period in the district‚Äôs history, showcasing the art for a broader audience\\". Note: Adopted by the Portland City Council 1996. Amended November 1998, November 2008. Ordinance 182319. An event called \\"Public Space Invasion\\" was held in the plaza containing the columns in 2011, inviting guests to \\"explore the legal limits of Portland's more peculiar public spaces\\". It advertised \\"crafts among the condos\\" and the opportunity to \\"picnic beside a freeway\\". In 2013, a bicycle tour called \\"Lovejoy Columns and Tom\\" focused on the conservation of the columns, the \\"almost forgotten history\\" of Stefopoulos and the rise of the Pearl District. The tour was narrated by Harrison on behalf of Friends of the Columns and guided by \\"Portland's Museum Lady\\" Carye Bye; it raised money for a gravestone for Stefopoulos' unmarked grave at Rose City Cemetery. It included a guided tour at the Hellenic-American Cultural Center and Museum, which was exhibiting Master Penworks of Tom Stefopoulos to view pen-and-ink art by Stefopoulos. It also included a viewing of Renwick's unfinished film Lovejoy and an optional visit to Stefopoulos' grave.\\"Lovejoy Columns and Tom Bike Ride\\":  * In her documentary, Renwick chronicled the effort to save the columns and restore the paintings. Depictions and reception The columns in 2016 The Daily Journal of Commerce called the columns a Portland \\"urban legend\\". According to Richard Speer of Willamette Week, \\"generations of Portlanders grew up counting the Lovejoy columns as one of the city's most unique attractions\\". Speer also said the columns were once \\"postcard favorites and seemed as much a part of the city's landscape as the Hawthorne Bridge\\" and have an \\"endearing, perspectiveless style\\". The murals appeared in Van Sant's film Drugstore Cowboy (1989), Foxfire (1996) and a music video featuring Elliott Smith. The resited columns have been included in published walking tours of Portland. In her 2006 book Walking Portland: 30 Tours of Stumptown's Funky Neighborhoods, Historic Landmarks, Park Trails, Farmers Markets, and Brewpubs, Becky Ohlsen said, \\"Whatever you make of the artwork, the inspired effort that went into preserving it‚Äînot to mention the awesome spectacle of those massive columns ripped free, their rebar guts exposed to the air‚Äîis damned impressive\\".

She married an Algerian, considered herself Algerian, and was involved in the struggle for Algeria's independence from France. Her work shows her love of the Aur√®s Mountains where she grew up, and her strong political beliefs. Life Colette Anna Gr√©goire was born on 14 March 1931 in Batna, Algeria. She grew up in Mena√¢, a small town in the Aur√®s Mountains, in a Chaoui Berber community. She was from a third-generation French family in Algeria, and was the only child of a family of progressive teachers who were very integrated into the Muslim culture. Her father taught elementary school. She became very conscious of the discrimination and injustice of the colonial system. As an adolescent she was extremely poor, but was helped by the community. Colette Gr√©goire attended university in Paris, but returned to Algeria before graduating to assist in the struggle for independence. She joined the Parti Communiste Alg√©rien (PCA). In 1955 she was a communist at a time when the communist party was banned. She always also fought for equal rights for women. Gr√©goire was arrested in April 1957 and imprisoned in Algiers at the Barberousse prison. Women here were beaten, abused and tortured with water and electricity. She was sent to an internment camp, and in 1958 was deported, probably because of her French origins. Colette Gr√©goire married in 1960. Her husband was an Algerian named Melki. Her pen-name Anna Gr√©ki is formed from their two last names. After independence in 1962 Colette Gr√©goire returned to Algeria. In 1963 she was one of the few Europeans to point out the discrimination in the law of 1963 which said that both parents should be from a paternal line born in Algeria and should be Muslim. In 1965 she obtained her BA in French Literature and became a high school teacher in Algiers. She taught in the Lyc√©e Abdelkader. Colette Gr√©goire died on 6 January 1966 during childbirth, at the age of 34. Work Anna Gr√©ki's poetry reflects her love of her native land, the Aur√®s, and her political beliefs. She wrote of her native country, Anna Gr√©ki's poetry was among the best to be produced during the Algerian war of independence. She praised the women who had the courage to join the struggle for freedom, and was optimistic about the future.

Life and career  Born 1939 in Rapperswil on the Obersee lakeshore in the canton of St. Gallen in Switzerland, the son of an organ builder made his studies in London and Fribourg, after a training as an export clerk. Later, he worked in his father's company Sp√§th Orgelbau in Rapperswil. Thereafter, Gerold Sp√§th undertook several trips and a longer stay in Ireland. Gerold Sp√§th lives and writes mainly in Rapperswil. Sp√§th Orgelbau, Giessi in Rapperswil Gerold Sp√§th's three central works are thematically connected: \\"Unschlecht\\" (1970), \\"Balzapf oder als ich auftauchte\\" (1977) and \\"Barbarswila\\" (1988), in which Rapperswil gave model to the fictitious localities Spiessb√ºnzen, Molchg√ºllen and Barbarswila, the satirical depictions of a typical Swiss small-town. A new narrative form was introduced with Commedia (1980), in a certain way basing on Dante's Inferno, for which Sp√§th was awarded with the German book prize Alfred-D√∂blin-Preis. Sp√§th's literally cosmos is characterized by love, lust and vices, and a propensity to the blazing sensuality and baroque awareness of the transience of everything earthly. He dominates all the stops by the comical and humorous to the tragic. Tales of Sp√§th's home town of Rapperswil and the region around Z√ºrichsee form a central motif of his work. The Swiss films Der Landvogt von Greifensee (1979) and V√∂llerei oder Inselfest (1980) base on Gerold Sp√§th's novels. Gerold Sp√§th's novels and short stories were translated in various languages, inter alia by Alice Ceresa the Italian-language edition of the novel \\"Unschlecht\\" (Italian: L'incredibile storia di Johann il Buono) in 1977. Gerold Sp√§th's self-image as author is palpable to his organ builder family, as he told on occasion of a dramatic reading: it's important that an organ will still be in 200 years a good organ. This results in a great care in writing, which he ironically called team inability. He wants no lecturer, independence in writing is the most important. Also of great importance to his literary works are the different residences ‚Äì Rapperswil, Ireland and Italy ‚Äì life abroad is deteriorating views of Switzerland. Anyway, Switzerland and his childhood in Rapperswil, which Gerold Sp√§th compares with Mark Twain's Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn, as he grew up with the so-called Seebuebed√ºtsch (Z√ºrichsee children language, meaning also 'wild') and to write on the people's mouth. His 'staff' is reduced to four family members, among them his wife Christine L√∂tscher.  Work  = Books (excerpt) = * 1979: Unschlecht. Arche, Z√ºrich 1970, ASIN B002PDE5W4. * 1979: Commedia.

At 17 days, primordial follicles, each of consists of a small oocyte (with no zona pellucida) and a single layer of flattened pre-granulosa cells, can first be observed in the cortical layer of the ovary. The follicles begin to proliferate, and are abundant by day 22. Even though primordial follicles will continue to form, between days 33 and 54 increasing numbers begin to degenerate, along with a decrease in ovarian cortical width. By day 36, primordial follicles occupy a narrow peripheral region of the ovarian cortex, while the rest of the cortical tissue is composed of degenerate primordial follicles, anovular cords and epitheloid cells. By 120 days, primary follicles have formed, each containing a small oocyte with a zona pellucida, and a single layer of cuboidal granulosa cells. Secondary follicles contain two or more layers of cuboidal granulosa cells, as well as an oocyte greater than 100 um in diameter. Follicular fluid synthesis occurs in tertiary follicles, which can be seen on days 120-160 post birth. Therefore, the time necessary for the recruitment of primordial follicles to tertiary follicles is approximately 70‚Äì150 days in the prepubertal dog.

It was located on the main line south of Jamaica Avenue. The station opened as a pair of sheltered sheds on June 28, 1916 and a ticket office at street level. The station's original name was High Bridge. Westbridge was out of service on January 1, 1939 and was discontinued as a station stop. However, Westbridge last appeared in an employee timetable on September 18, 1938. In 1916 there was a complaint by the Westbridge Civic Association to have one train in each direction to stop at Westbridge as they do at Forest Hills and Kew Gardens. There are still remnants of this station; at the south end crossing of Jamaica Avenue you can see where the platforms used to be, the concrete footstones are still there and can be seen along the westbound side. Westbridge used to operate as a freight station after its closing. There is currently some old wood which lays alongside the outer edge of the roadbed which is most likely from the Wooden shelter that used to be on the platform. Some current maps and atlases still have Westbridge listed as a freight only station to this day; quite to the contrary that freight is no longer used here. While this station was open, one could see BMT trains on the BMT Jamaica Line overhead from the main line tracks when the trains ran to 168th Street.

One challenge came during a game against Bradley, which elected to play with a triangle-and-two defense that Bradley coach Dick Versace called the \\"Bird Cage\\". The alignment was effective in containing Bird, who scored four points (his lowest total for Indiana State) on two field goal attempts; the Sycamores, however, managed to win. By February 13, the Sycamores were the top-ranked team in the country, and they held that position in the final rankings. Indiana State won all 16 of its games against MVC competition. The Sycamores were the number one in the Midwest region of the NCAA Tournament, and began their run in the event with an 86‚Äì69 second-round win over Virginia Tech. A 93‚Äì72 win over Oklahoma followed, and a two-point victory against Arkansas gave Indiana State a Final Four spot. In the national semifinal against DePaul, Bird made 16 of 19 field goal attempts and had 16 rebounds and 9 assists. In a close game, Indiana State won to reach the final without a loss on the season, at =Michigan State= Coached by Jud Heathcote, Michigan State featured sophomore Magic Johnson, who had been instrumental in helping the team win the Big Ten Conference championship the previous season. It was their first solo conference title since 1958‚Äì59; the Spartans reached the regional finals at the 1978 NCAA Tournament, but lost by three points to eventual champion Kentucky.Davis, pp. 11‚Äì12. The team also had Greg Kelser, who was later chosen in the first round of the NBA draft. Writer Michael Wilbon said that entering the season, the team was \\"talented but seemed just a little less than they should have been in the Big Ten.\\" The Spartans began the season with three straight wins, then lost by a point, 70‚Äì69, at North Carolina. Michigan State followed that defeat with six consecutive wins, and was top-ranked in the AP poll in early January. However, the team lost consecutive games to Illinois and Purdue (both losses coming on jumpers in the closing seconds), causing it to fall five places in the poll. Afterwards, the Spartans posted a blowout victory over Indiana and a win in overtime over Iowa. Ranked third in the AP poll following those games, the Spartans lost at Michigan 49‚Äì48, as Keith Smith made the winning free throw with no time remaining.Davis, pp. 95‚Äì99. In their next game, an unheralded Northwestern team handed Michigan State its worst defeat of the season, beating them 83‚Äì65 for their fourth loss in six games.Davis, pp. 101‚Äì102. After that game, they faced Ohio State in a contest that required overtime; the Spartans emerged with an 84‚Äì79 win. That led to a winning streak; Michigan State ran off wins in their next nine games, defeating four of the teams that had beaten them in the process. Wisconsin snapped the Spartans' streak in their final game before the NCAA tournament, winning 83‚Äì81 on a long-range shot at the buzzer. The Spartans' 13‚Äì5 Big Ten record put them in a three-way tie with Iowa and Purdue for first in the conference, and they won 21 of 27 games in all regular season play;Emmerich, chapter 5, p. 1. their final AP poll ranking was third. Michigan State was awarded the second seed in the Mideast Regional for the NCAA Tournament, and defeated the Lamar Cardinals 95‚Äì64 in their first game, held in the second round. The Spartans advanced to the regional semifinal, where they topped third-seeded LSU 87‚Äì71. In the regional final, the Spartans defeated the Mideast region's top seed, Notre Dame, by a 12-point margin to advance to the Final Four, where they faced Penn. Michigan State won in the national semifinals 101‚Äì67 to gain a berth in the NCAA title game. Johnson had a triple-double in the contest, posting 29 points, 10 assists, and 10 rebounds. Entering the national championship game, they had a 25‚Äì6 record. Broadcasting The 1979 NCAA Final Four, which included the national championship game, was televised by NBC. Announcing duties were performed by Dick Enberg, Al McGuire, and Billy Packer, while the halftime show was hosted by Bryant Gumbel. The Nielsen ratings for the championship game were 24.1; this figure is the highest for any basketball game in the United States as of 2017. The estimated audience was around 40 million people in 18 million households, and the number of viewers increased 20 percent from the 1978 NCAA Tournament final. Game summary The Special Events Center served as the site of the 1979 NCAA Tournament final. The national championship game took place on March 26. The Spartans gained control of the ball after the opening tip-off, only for Johnson to commit a traveling violation by making contact with the feet of Indiana State's Brad Miley. The Sycamores scored the first basket of the game, which was made by Steve Reed. The two teams played a close game in the early stages; a successful shot by Bird gave Indiana State a one-point advantage, and Michigan State called a timeout after his shot.Bird, Johnson, and MacMullan, pp. 54‚Äì55. The Spartans took a 9‚Äì8 lead on a basket by guard Terry Donnelly four minutes and twenty- six seconds into the contest. Michigan State used that play to begin a scoring run, outpointing Indiana State 9‚Äì0 during the stretch, which included a three- point play by guard Mike Brkovich. The Spartans' game plan on defense was to converge on Bird when he neared the baseline, in an effort to prevent him from receiving the ball. In addition, their strategy led to multiple instances in which Bird became uncertain as to whether he should pass or attempt a shot. Bird's effectiveness was limited, but Michigan State's players committed numerous personal fouls; both Johnson and Kelser had three fouls in the first half and were forced to leave the game. Despite their foul issues, the Spartans extended their lead over the Sycamores to 12 as the first half neared its end. After 20 minutes of play, Michigan State held a 37‚Äì28 advantage. To begin the second half, Kelser made a shot six feet from the basket. Including those two points, the Spartans scored seven consecutive points to bring their lead to 16. Donnelly contributed four straight field goals as the Spartans' lead climbed to 50‚Äì34. Indiana State began to rally at this point, with two made field goal attempts each for Bird and Bob Heaton. While Michigan State's lead remained around 10 points, Kelser's foul troubles worsened when he committed his fourth of the game 4:27 into the second half. Michigan State was forced to remove him for reserve Jay Vincent, who was suffering from a foot bruise. In 19 overall minutes of playing time, Vincent had four fouls himself. Indiana State focused on playing close to the opposing basket while Kelser was out of the game, and Bird keyed a Sycamores scoring run with two field goals and a free throw. With 10:05 remaining, the Spartans' lead had been cut to 52‚Äì46. Kelser was brought into the game in response to the run, and did not commit another foul until the end. He and Johnson were responsible for the next eight points scored by the Spartans. The run included a four-point play by Johnson; he had a slam dunk while being fouled by Heaton, and sank two free throws that were awarded because Heaton was judged to have undercut him. For the last five minutes of the game, the Spartans held the ball for long periods to burn time off the clock. Bird received a technical foul call for one play in which he illegally stole the ball from Johnson while he was attempting an inbounds pass and attempted to score.Bird, Johnson, and MacMullan, p. 57. Behind an offense that missed only 4 of 16 second half field goal attempts, Michigan State clinched its first men's basketball national championship by a 75‚Äì64 final score. Johnson was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player, having scored 53 points on 17-of-25 shooting during the Final Four. Statistical summary Johnson led all scorers in the national championship game with 24 points on 8-of-15 shooting. Kelser added 19 points and led the Spartans with 8 rebounds, one more than Johnson. Donnelly was the only other Michigan State player to score in double figures; he made all five of his field goal attempts and ended the game with 15 points. Ron Charles, Vincent, and Mike Brkovich were the other Spartans players to score points; each player contributed between five and seven points to Michigan State's total. Overall, the Spartans made 26 of their 43 shots. For the Sycamores, Bird was the team's leading scorer with 19 points, but missed on two-thirds of his 21 field goal attempts. Bird was also the top rebounder for either side in the game, recording 13 rebounds. Nicks made half of his 14 shots and scored 17 points, while Heaton added 10 points. Four other players contributed points for Indiana State, but the team was successful on only 27 of its 64 field goal attempts. The Sycamores' free throw shooting was worse than Michigan State's; Indiana State missed 12 of its 22 attempts, while the Spartans had 10 misses in 33 free throws taken. The free throw scoring differential was thus greater than the margin of victory. Aftermath Wilbon has credited the 1979 NCAA championship game with increasing interest in the NCAA Tournament, which underwent two field expansions in the following decade. Bird and Johnson both turned professional after the 1978‚Äì79 college season, and wound up playing for the Boston Celtics and Los Angeles Lakers, respectively. The 1979 NCAA championship game was the first encounter in a rivalry that developed as the two continued their careers. The Celtics and Lakers met three times in the NBA Finals during the 1980s, and the pair helped to increase national interest in the NBA. ESPN's Andy Katz wrote that Bird and Johnson \\"helped create the interest in the Final Four and they made today's NBA.\\" Footnotes References Bibliography  * * NCAA Division I Basketball Championship Game NCAA Division I Basketball Championship Game Category:Basketball in Salt Lake City Category:College sports in Utah Category:Indiana State Sycamores men's basketball Category:Magic Johnson Category:Michigan State Spartans men's basketball Category:NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship Games Category:Sports competitions in Salt Lake City ","title":"1979 NCAA Division I Basketball Championship Game"},{"id":"44630772","text":"Charles Henry Parnther (1 October 1813 ‚Äì 10 November 1854) was an English civil servant and cricketer who played first-class cricket for Cambridge University, Marylebone Cricket Club, the Gentlemen and All-England teams between 1832 and 1836.Cricketarchive puts his death as 11 October, but the Morning Post of 18 November 1854 records it as 10 November. He was born at Westminster, London and died at Walham Green, also in London. Parnther was educated at Eton College and Trinity College, Cambridge. As a cricketer, he was an all-rounder: generally a middle-order batsman and a bowler, though it is not known what his batting or bowling styles were. His best bowling match was for Cambridge University against the Cambridge Town Club in 1834 when he opened the batting and top-scored for the university with 31 in the second innings, and took at least seven of the 10 Town wickets, and caught one of the others: the full figures for the game are not available. His best batting came in another good all-round game for him: playing for MCC against Cambridge University in 1835, he scored 17 and an unbeaten 43, and also took seven university wickets, with five in the second innings. He played in the Gentlemen v Players matches of 1834, 1835 and 1836 without much success, and in three games for the All-England team (which played as \\"England\\") he made only one run and took no wickets at all.

He trained in Antwerp and subsequently worked for extensive periods in Italy and the Dutch Republic.Jan Baptist Wolfaerts at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Life Wolfaerts was born in Antwerp as the son of Artus Wolfaerts, a prominent painter of religious and mythological scenes. His father was likely his first teacher. When Jan Baptist was 16 years old, his father died. it is believed he then traveled to Rome via Paris. There is no evidence for this trip but the italianate aspects in some of his early works from between 1644 and 1646 make such a trip likely. Shepherds with their cattle in a hilly river landscape In 1647 he was recorded in Haarlem where he joined the local Guild of Saint Luke. A decade later the artist was in Rome as evidenced by a document of 1658 referring to him as Giovanbattista Ulfard, fiamengo. The next year he was back in Haarlem where he remained until 1671. He bought on 11 January 1659 a house at the Koningstraat in Haarlem. In July 1661 he had a son out of wedlock. There are reports that in the mid-60's his mental health deteriorated and he went back to his family in Antwerp. By 1665 he had returned to Haarlem, but his mental health problem made him move back to Antwerp once more. In september 1671 there are further reports on the artist who was back in Haarlem about his continuing confused state of mind. That his work was highly regarded in his time is borne out by its presence in contemporary Dutch inventories. His works were sold through the Amsterdam dealer Van Meldert who carried five examples in 1653 and were in the collection of artist and art collector Abraham de Pape of Leiden. It is not clear when or when he died but it may have been in Antwerp. Work Shepherdesses tending their flock Jan Baptist Wolfaerts was a specialist landscape painter who is known for his Italianate landscapes with figures. His early works included italianate townscapes. His principal subject was pastoral landscapes with shepherds and their herds. Such landscapes would on occasion include depictions of Italianate buildings. He also painted some more typically Dutch landscapes with fewer figures, which are closer to his Haarlem contemporaries. Haarlem painters Nicolaes Berchem and Salomon Rombouts were clearly influential on the artist.

It was designed by Frank Gibson Costello and built by Brisbane City Council. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 6 April 2005.  History  The Brisbane City Council built the concrete shelter at Raymond Park (west) as an air raid shelter in 1942. On 7 December 1941, the United States of America entered World War II following the bombing of the American fleet at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii by Japanese carrier-borne aircraft. England and its Commonwealth had been at war with Germany since September 1939, but now the war was truly global. The Japanese first bombed Darwin on 19 February 1942 and 14,000 Australians were taken prisoner following the fall of Singapore. Plans to defend Australia from an anticipated Japanese invasion and to use Queensland as a support base for the conduct of the Pacific war were implemented quickly. Australian and American personnel poured into Queensland and urgently required a wide range of new buildings and facilities. The population of Brisbane swelled dramatically. As it was the major city in Queensland, and the most northerly major population centre in Australia, military planning headquarters were set up in Brisbane, as were a number of important maintenance, communication, and supply facilities. General Douglas MacArthur, Commander in Chief of the Allied Forces, Southwest Pacific, was based in the AMP building at the corner of Queen Street and Edward Street in Brisbane, and General Sir Thomas Blamey, Commander in Chief of the Australian Forces, used the recently constructed University of Queensland buildings at St Lucia. Brisbane was obviously a strategic target for bombing, and rapid action had to be taken to protect the population in the event of air raids. The demand on materials, services and labour was enormous and military projects took precedence in their allocation. Heavy Anti-Aircraft batteries were built at Victoria Park, Hendra, Pinkenba, Fort Lytton, Hemmant and Balmoral, and coastal artillery batteries were established on Bribie and Moreton Islands. Before the war, Queensland had a small population and no heavy manufacturing industries. To help overcome these problems, some buildings were prefabricated and standard designs for many structures were used. Designs took into account the scarcity of skilled labour and of some materials. The Brisbane City Council took responsibility for Air Raid Precautions activities, including establishing an Air Raid Warden system, firefighting systems and constructing air raid shelters. Aboveground salt water pipes were laid along city streets to aid in firefighting. On Christmas Eve, 1941, each Australian State's Emergency Committee issued instructions for government, private employers and private households to immediately start building shelters. Slit trenches were built in parks and schoolyards, windows were taped, and brownouts were applied to buildings. In the Protection of Persons and Property Order No.1, gazetted 23 December 1941, Premier William Forgan Smith, with powers conferred by Regulation 35a, National Security (General) Regulations, ordered the Brisbane City Council to construct 200 public surface shelters in the city area. Work had already started on 15 December, and later another 75 shelters were ordered. However, only 235 air raid shelters were constructed, the building programme being 90% complete by June 1942. In addition, around three kilometres of covered trenches were constructed in public parks, in 13 projects, including of concrete-pipe covered trench in the Botanic Gardens, and of the same in Victoria Park. It was believed that one person could be accommodated by each foot of trench. In addition to the public shelters, the Brisbane City Council also constructed shelters for leased wharves and council properties, including at the Stanley Wharf, Circular Quay Wharves 2,3 and 4, Norman Wharf, and Musgrave Wharf. Shelters were built under the Story Bridge, for Kangaroo Point shipbuilding workers, and five shelters were constructed on behalf of the Bureau of Industry at the Howard Smith Wharves. The Protection of Persons and Property Order No.1 was applied statewide, and outside Brisbane another 24 Local Authorities in Queensland's coastal areas were ordered to produce surface or trench shelters for the public, to be built according to the Air Raid Shelter Code laid down in the Second Schedule of Order No.1. Initially, 20 of the Local Authorities were expected to construct a minimum total of 133 surface shelters, which were supposed to be able to withstand the blast of a 500-pound bomb bursting away. Four other Local Authorities would only build trenches. However, after plans were amended, 23 Local Authorities outside Brisbane, excluding Thursday Island, ended up possessing a total of 129 public shelters: 123 surface and six underground. This effort had cost ¬£56,596. Where Local Authorities were unwilling or unable to build the required number of code-compliant shelters, in some cases because they had already begun erecting other shelters, the Department of Public Works became responsible for the shelters' construction. However, this led to problems when the Department tried to recoup half of the cost from the Local Authorities in question. Townsville, Toowoomba, Gladstone, and Ayr denied any liability for costs, and a Bill had to be passed in December 1942 to force their compliance. The Ayr Shire Council had claimed that the shelters would be death traps during an air raid. Of the 235 surface shelters built in Brisbane for the public, 21 survive and are still owned by the Brisbane City Council. One of the shelters, on Queens Wharf Road, is a site-specific \\"special\\" variation of the standard pillbox design. It is listed in the Queensland Heritage Register as part of the entry for the porphyry retaining wall on William Street. The other 20 public shelters owned by the Brisbane City Council can be divided into three types of pillbox intended for conversion after the war: \\"park\\", \\"bus\\", and \\"bus (stone)\\". They were designed to serve as structures such as bus waiting shelters or shade structures for parks, with some or all of the perimeter blast walls to be removed, leaving the concrete slab roof, floor slab and piers. The reusable pillboxes were designed to hold 70 people, as were the non-reusable standard pillboxes. F.G. Costello, Brisbane City Council City Architect between 1941 and 1952, was responsible for the design of the surface air raid shelters, and his variants of the standard pillbox were designed to provide a post-war utility for at least part of the Council's shelter building programme. In an address delivered to the Constitutional Club in Brisbane on February 1942, Costello noted that if the emergency for their use does not arise ...(unused shelters)... remain in brick and concrete, in many cases having no further value and being a possible source of nuisance. He added that I can assure you that wherever it is possible, without sacrificing the primary requirements of shelter from air attack, I have endeavoured in our Council buildings to so plan the shelters that they will fit into schemes of improvement which we hope will proceed immediately after the war. Costello's work was characterised by the use of an architectural language inspired by the modern movement in architecture. This movement pursued the rational use of modern materials and principles of functionalist planning and established a visual aesthetic largely inspired by the machine. It was part of an architecture employing the language of vertical and horizontal volumes and planes, floating flat roofs, masses set against voids and monumentality. Though modest in scale and form, the design of the shelters is characteristic of work in this idiom. The reusable shelters were often sited under fig trees, to aid in camouflage. The first of Costello's reusable designs is the pillbox with double-cantilevered roof slab, or \\"park\\" type shelter. In an original list of all the shelters constructed by the Brisbane City Council, these were simply labelled as \\"cantilever\\". They had four central piers supporting the roof slab, which allowed for the removal of the four blast walls after the war. There was an entrance at each end of the front wall, where an internal wall extended into the shelter. If the walls were made of brick, the shelter's dimension was by by high, and if concrete was used the dimensions were by by high. The difference was due to the fact that the brick walls finished in line with the top of the roof slab, covering the fascia, whereas the concrete walls finished at the soffit of the roof slab, flush with the fascia. The minimum wall thickness for brick was set at 13.5\\", and 12\\" for concrete. The roof slab was intended to have at least four inches of concrete. Of the 37 reusable shelters listed as being of the park type only 17 survive: one at Hefferan Park in Annerley; two at Albert Park; two at Wickham Park; one in Buranda Playground in Woolloongabba; two in Raymond Park in Kangaroo Point; and one each at Kelvin Grove, Morningside, Nundah, Stones Corner, and Windsor. Four other shelters stand on East Street and Wickham Street in Fortitude Valley. Most are used as simple park shelters, as intended, but the shelter at Nundah has been modified as a toilet block, and the shelter at Kelvin Grove is used as a bus shelter (as distinct from those shelters in the next category, which were specifically designed as \\"bus\\" type shelters). About half of the surviving park shelters had concrete blast walls, while half used brick. The second design was the pillbox with single-cantilevered roof slab, or \\"bus\\" type shelter, as it was called in the original Brisbane City Council list. These were designed so that the three brick blast walls could be removed after the war, leaving a concrete back wall and five brick piers at the front. Again, entrances were at each end of the front wall. Of the 19 \\"bus\\" types listed only two survive, at Newmarket and Newstead. The third design was also a \\"bus\\" type shelter, but it was built with a stone rear wall, instead of concrete, and six stone piers were later added, instead of five brick piers. The three brick blast walls could be removed as normal. Two of these \\"colonnade\\" types were built-referred to in the Brisbane City Council list as \\"bus (stone)\\" and only one survives, at King Edward Park. Most of the Brisbane structures built for the war were removed at the end of World War Two. The saltwater mains, slit trenches, and sirens disappeared, as did the many standard pillboxes that had stood in the middle of the streets of the Central Business District. 156 standard pillboxes were built, but none of the surviving public shelters in Brisbane City Council ownership are of that design. Of the 21 special shelters, only the one on Queens Wharf Road survives. However, of Costello's 58 reusable public surface shelters, 20 have survived; the removal of their blast walls, as planned, had given them a renewed purpose. The worker's shelters at the Story Bridge Hotel and Howard Smith Wharves also still exist. The blast walls of the air raid shelter at Raymond Park (West) were removed according to plan after World War Two, although evidence of the location of the walls is still visible. The shelter roof and piers have been painted.  Description  Shelter in 2015 The Raymond Park (West) air raid shelter is a rectangular concrete structure comprising a heavy floor slab and a flat roof supported by concrete piers. The piers and the roof are painted green. The shelter stands behind the Pineapple Hotel on Baines Street at the west end of Raymond Park. There is a run of cat's paw prints and woman's shoeprints across the concrete floor slab.  Heritage listing  Raymond Park (West) Air Raid Shelter was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 6 April 2005 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Raymond Park (west) air raid shelter is important as a part of the Air Raid Precaution activities that were implemented for the defence of Brisbane during World War Two. Designed to afford protection to the civilian population of Brisbane in the event of air raid attacks or other emergencies, the air raid shelter located in Raymond Park (west) is important in demonstrating the impact of World War Two on the civilian population of Brisbane. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. Although many air raid shelters were constructed during World War Two in Queensland, comparatively few survive. Also, there are not many types of structures built by the Brisbane City Council during World War Two, for wartime purposes, which survive. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The shelter's solid construction, rectangular shape, and its siting near a population concentration, demonstrate the principal characteristics of a World War Two Brisbane public air raid shelter. The place is important in demonstrating a high degree of creative or technical achievement at a particular period. The Raymond Park (west) air raid shelter, now used as a park shelter, demonstrates the secondary uses that were part of the original design intention.

They were prominent yangban families during Korea's Joseon dynasty originating from Andong, North Gyeongsang province, during the Goryeo dynasty. The clans produced many individuals who passed the gwageo, as well as three queens. Both clans derive from the Gim clan of Gyeongju. Type =Andong Kim clan (old)= The old Andong Kim clan was founded during the Goryeo dynasty by the grandson of Gyeongsun of Silla, Sukseung. In 2000, the old Gim clans of Andong were found to number at around 425,000 individuals. =Andong Kim clan (new)= Kim Seon- pyung(ÈáëÂÆ£Âπ≥), the founder of Andong Kim clan was one of the founding contributors of Goryeo dynasty. Before being founding contributor he was castellan of Andong province. He was given a new surname by Taejo of Goryeo with other founding contributors because of his contribution and became a founder of new Andong Kim clan. But after the founding of Goryeo dynasty, nevertheless members of new Andong Kim clan were the offsprings of founding contributor, no one could pass the Gwageo during the Goryeo dynasty among them and they were just satisfied by inheriting their land in Andong province. It was from Kim Deuk-woo(ÈáëÂæóÈõ®) that new Andong Kim clan began to prosper, who is 7th generation descendant of Kim seon-pyung the founder. In his grandson generation the first Gwageo passer of new Andong Kim clan produced. Kim beon(ÈáëÁí†), Kim deuk-woo's 5th generation descendant resided in Seoul, and beon's offsprings lived there for generations til they downfelled. Who came to exert a great deal of influence and power through intermarriage with the royal family and dominated the royal court once at the end of the Joseon dynasty are them, Kim beon's descendants. But what is important is that those who did what was said above were only an offshoot of new Andong Kim clan. In fact, after Kim sang-heon(ÈáëÂ∞ôÊÜ≤), great-grandson of Kim beon, new Andong Kim clan became an authorized Yangban family with pedigree and through this background one of them could did what was said above. During Joseon dynasty, they all were basically yangban family so they married with other great yangban families. In 2000, the number of the new Andong Kim clan amounted to about 48,000 individuals. Downfall Heungseon Daewongun removed much of the Andong Kim clan's power during the 19th century. During the Gabo Reform, the yangban class was abolished.
